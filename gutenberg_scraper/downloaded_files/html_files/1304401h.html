<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Chapter 1. Fortune and Major
Sands</h2>
<p>Major Sands, conscious of his high deserts, was disposed to
receive with condescension the gifts which he perceived that
Fortune offered him. She could not bribe him with them into a
regard for her discernment. He had seen her shower favours upon the
worthless and defraud the meritorious of their just reward. And she
had kept him waiting. If at last she turned to him, he supposed
that it was less from any gracious sense of justice in herself than
because Major Sands had known how to constrain her.</p>
<p>This, from all the evidence I have sifted, I take to have been
the complexion of his thoughts as he lounged beside the day-bed set
for Miss Priscilla Harradine under the awning of brown sailcloth
which had been improvised on the high poop of the
<i>Centaur</i>.</p>
<p>The trim yellow ship lay at anchor in the spacious bay of Fort
Royal, which she had made her first port of call after the short
run from Barbados. They were taking fresh water aboard, and this
was providing an occasion to induce them to take other things. In
the forechains the Negro steward and the cook were receiving a
bombardment of mangled English and smooth French from a cluster of
periaguas, laden with fruit and vegetables, that bumped and scraped
alongside, manned by whites, half-castes, Negroes and Caribs, all
of them vociferous in their eagerness to sell.</p>
<p>At the head of the entrance ladder stood Captain Bransome in a
stiff-skirted coat of dark blue with tarnished gold lace, refusing
admission to the gabardined and persistent Jew in the cockboat at
the foot of it, who was offering him bargains in cocoa, ginger, and
spices.</p>
<p>Inshore, across the pellucid jade green waters of the bay,
gently ruffled by the north-easterly breeze that was sweetly
tempering the torrid heat of the sun, rose the carnage of masts and
spars of the shipping riding there at anchor. Beyond this the
little town of Fort Royal showed sharply white against the emerald
green undulating slopes of Martinique, slopes dominated in the
north by the volcanic mass of Mont Pele which thrust its rugged
summit into the cobalt sky.</p>
<p>Captain Bransome, his glance alternating between the Jew who
would not be dismissed, and a longboat that half a mile away was
heading for the ship, removed his round black castor. Under this
his head was swathed in a blue cotton handkerchief, as being cooler
than a periwig. He stood mopping his brow whilst he waited. He was
feeling the heat in the ponderous European finery which, out of
regard for the dignity of his office of master, he donned whenever
putting into port.</p>
<p>On the poop above, despite the breeze and the shadow of the
awning, Major Sands, too, was feeling the heat, inclining as he did
to a rather fleshly habit of body, and this despite a protracted
sojourn in the Tropic of Cancer. He had come out five years ago
whilst King Charles II was still alive. He had volunteered for
service overseas in the conviction that in the New World he would
find that fortune which eluded him in the Old. The necessity was
imposed upon him by a dissolute father who had gamed and drunk the
broad family estates in Wiltshire. Major Sands' inheritance,
therefore, had been scanty. At least, it did not include--and for
this he daily returned thanks to his Maker--the wasteful,
improvident proclivities of his sire. The Major was no man for
hazards. In contrast with his profligate father, he was of that
cold and calculating temperament which, when allied with
intelligence, will carry a man far. In Major Sands the intelligence
was absent; but like most men in his case he was not aware of it.
If he had not realized his hopes strictly in accordance with the
expectations that had sent him overseas, he perceived that he was
about to realize them very fully, nevertheless. And however
unforeseen the circumstances to which the fact was due, this nowise
troubled his perception that the achievement proceeded from his own
merit and address. Hence his disdainful attitude towards Fortune.
The issue, after all, was a simple one. He had come out to the West
Indies in quest of fortune. And in the West Indies he had found it.
He had achieved what he came to achieve. Could cause and effect be
linked more closely?</p>
<p>This fortune which he had won, or the winning of which awaited
now his pleasure, reclined on a day-bed of cane and carved oak, and
was extremely good to look upon. Slim and straight, clean-limbed
and moderately tall, Priscilla Harradine displayed an outward grace
of body that was but the reflection of an inner grace of mind. The
young face under the shadow of the wide-brimmed hat was of a
winning loveliness; it was of that delicate tint that went with the
deep golden of her hair, and it offered little evidence of long
years spent in the blistering climate of Antigua. If there was
spirit in her resolute little chin and firmly modelled lips, there
was only tenderness and candour in the eyes, wide-set and
intelligent and of a colour that was something between the deep
blue of the sky and the jade-green of the sea on which they gazed.
She wore a high-waisted gown of ivory-coloured silk, and the
escalloped edges of her bodice were finely laced with gold.
Languidly she waved a fan, fashioned from the vivid
green-and-scarlet of parrots' feathers, in the heart of which a
little oval mirror had been set.</p>
<p>Her father, Sir John Harradine, had been actuated by motives
similar to those of Major Sands in exiling himself from England to
a remote colonial settlement. His fortunes, too, had been at a low
ebb; and as much for the sake of his only and motherless child as
for his own, he had accepted the position of Captain-General of the
Leeward Islands, the offer of which a friend at court had procured
for him. Great opportunities of fortune came the way of an alert
colonial governor. Sir John had known how to seize them and squeeze
them during the six years that his governorship had lasted, and
when at last he died--prematurely cut off by a tropical fever--he
was in a position to make amends to his daughter for the years of
exile she had shared with him, by leaving her mistress of a very
substantial fortune and of a very fair estate in his native Kent
which a trustworthy agent in England had acquired for him.</p>
<p>It had been Sir John's wish that she should go home at once to
this, and to his sister who would guide her. On his deathbed he
protested that too much of her youth already had she wasted in the
West Indies through his selfishness. For this he begged her pardon,
and so died.</p>
<p>They had been constant companions and good friends, she and her
father. She missed him sorely, and might have missed him more,
might have been dejected by his death into a deeper sense of
loneliness, but for the ready friendship, attention, and service of
Major Sands.</p>
<p>Bartholomew Sands had acted as the Captain-General's
second-in-command. He had lived at Government House with them so
long that Miss Priscilla had come to look upon him as one of the
family, and was glad enough to lean upon him now. And the Major was
even more glad to be leaned cupon. His hopes of succeeding Sir John
in the governorship of Antigua were slight. Not that in his view he
lacked the ability. He knew that he had ability to spare. But court
favour in these matters, he supposed, counted for more than talent
or experience; and court favour no doubt would be filling the
vacant post with some inept fribble from home.</p>
<p>The perception of this quickened his further perception that his
first duty was to Miss Priscilla. He told her so, and overwhelmed
the child by this display of what she accounted an altruistic
nobility. For she was under the assumption that his natural place
was in her father's vacant seat, an assumption which he was far
from wishing to dispel. It might well be so, he opined; but it
could matter little when weighed against her possible need of him.
She would be going home to England now. The voyage was long,
tedious, and fraught with many perils. To him it was as
inconceivable as it was intolerable that she should take this
voyage unaccompanied and unprotected. Even though he should
jeopardize his chances of the succession of the governorship as a
consequence of leaving the island at such a time, yet his sense of
duty to herself and his regard for her left him no choice. Also, he
added, with impressive conviction, it was what her father would
have wished.</p>
<p>Overbearing her gentle objections to this self-sacrifice, he had
given himself leave of absence, and had appointed Captain Grey to
the lieutenant-governorship until fresh orders should come from
Whitehall.</p>
<p>And so he had shipped himself with her aboard the
<i>Centaur</i>, and with her at first had been her black
waiting-woman Isabella. Unfortunately, the Negress had suffered so
terribly from seasickness that it was impossible to take her across
the ocean, and they had been constrained to land her at Barbados,
so that henceforth Miss Priscilla must wait upon herself.</p>
<p>Major Sands had chosen the <i>Centaur</i> for her fine roominess
and seaworthy qualities despite the fact that before setting a
course for home her master had business to transact farther south
in Barbados. If anything, the Major actually welcomed this
prolongation of the voyage, and consequently of this close and
intimate association with Miss Priscilla. It was in his calculating
nature to proceed slowly, to spoil nothing by precipitancy. He
realized that his wooing of Sir John Harradine's heiress, which,
indeed, had not begun until after Sir John's death had cast her, as
it were, upon his hands, must be conducted yet some little way
before he could account that he had won her. There were certain
disadvantages to be overcome, certain possible prejudices to be
broken down. After all, although undoubtedly a very personable
man--a fact of which his mirror gave him the most confident
assurances--there was an undeniable disparity of age between them.
Miss Priscilla was not yet twenty-five, whilst Major Sands had
already turned his back on forty, and was growing rather bald under
his golden periwig. At first he had clearly perceived that she was
but too conscious of his years. She had treated him with an almost
filial deference, which had brought him some pain and more dismay.
With the close association that had been theirs and the suggestive
skill with which he had come to establish a sense of approximate
coevality, this attitude in her was being gradually dispelled. He
looked now to the voyage to enable him to complete the work so well
begun. He would be a dolt, indeed, if he could not contrive that
this extremely desirable lady and her equally desirable fortune
should be contracted to him before they cast anchor in Plymouth
Roads. It was upon this that he had staked his slender chances of
succession to the governorship of Antigua. But, as I have said,
Major Sands was no gambler. And this was no gambler's throw. He
knew himself, his personableness, his charms and his arts, well
enough, to be confident of the issue. He had merely exchanged a
possibility for a certainty; the certainty of that fortune which he
had originally come overseas to seek, and which lay now all but
within his grasp.</p>
<p>This was his settled conviction as he leaned forward in his
chair, leaned nearer to tempt her with the Peruvian sweetmeats in
the silver box he proffered, procured for her with that touching
anticipation of her every possible wish which by now she must have
come to remark in him.</p>
<p>She stirred against the cushion of purple velvet with its gold
tassels, which his solicitous hands had fetched from the cabin and
placed behind her. She shook her head in refusal, but smiled upon
him with a gentleness that was almost tender.</p>
<p>'You are so watchful of my comfort, Major Sands, that it is
almost ungracious to refuse anything you bring. But...' She waved
her green-and-scarlet fan.</p>
<p>He feigned ill-humour, which may not have been entirely feigned.
'If I am to be Major Sands to you to the end of my days, faith,
I'll bring you nothing more. I am called Bartholomew, ma'am.
Bartholomew.'</p>
<p>'A fine name,' said she. 'But too fine and long for common
everyday use, in such heat as this.'</p>
<p>His answer to that was almost eager. Disregarding her rallying
note, he chose to take her literally 'I have been called Bart upon
occasion, by my friends. It's what my mother called me always. I
make you free of it, Priscilla.'</p>
<p>'I am honoured, Bart,' she laughed, and so rejoiced him.</p>
<p>Four couplets sounded from the ship's belfry. It brought her to
sit up as if it had been a signal.</p>
<p>'Eight bells, and we are still at anchor. Captain Bransome said
we should be gone before now.' She rose. 'What keeps us here, I
wonder.'</p>
<p>As if to seek an answer to her question, she moved from the
shadow of the awning. Major Sands, who had risen with her, stepped
beside her to the taffrail.</p>
<p>The cockboat with the baffled Jew was already on its way back to
the shore. The periaguas were falling away, their occupants still
vociferous, chopping wit now with some sailors who leaned upon the
bulwarks. But the longboat, which Captain Bransome had been
watching, was coming alongside at the foot of the entrance ladder.
One of the naked brown Caribs by whom she was manned knelt in the
prow to seize a bight of rope and steady her against the vessel's
side.</p>
<p>From her stern-sheets rose the tall, slim, vigorous figure of a
man in a suit of pale blue taffetas with silver lace. About the
wide brim of his black hat curled a pale blue ostrich plume, and
the hand he put forth to steady himself upon the ladder was gloved
and emerged from a cloud of fine lace.</p>
<p>'Odds life!' quoth Major Sands, in amazement at this modishness
off Martinique. 'And who may this be?'</p>
<p>His amazement increased to behold the practised agility with
which this modish fellow came swiftly up that awkward ladder. He
was followed, more clumsily, by a half-caste in a cotton shirt and
breeches of hairy, untanned hide, who carried a cloak, a rapier,
and a sling of purple leather, stiff with bullion, from the ends of
which protruded the chased silver butts of a brace of pistols.</p>
<p>The newcomer reached the deck. A moment he paused, tall and
commanding at the ladder's head; then he stepped down into the
waist, and doffed his hat in courteous response to the Captain's
similar salutation. He revealed a swarthy countenance below a
glossy black periwig that was sedulously curled.</p>
<p>The Captain barked an order. Two of the hands sprang to the main
hatch for a canvas sling, and went to lower it from the
bulwarks.</p>
<p>By this the watchers on the poop saw first one chest and then
another hauled up to the deck.</p>
<p>'He comes to stay, it seems,' said Major Sands.</p>
<p>'He has the air of a person of importance,' ventured Miss
Priscilla.</p>
<p>The Major was perversely moved to contradict her. 'You judge by
his foppish finery. But externals, my dear, can be deceptive. Look
at his servant, if that rascal is his servant. He has the air of a
buccaneer.'</p>
<p>'We are in the Indies, Bart,' she reminded him.</p>
<p>'Why, so we are. And somehow this gallant seems out of place in
them. I wonder who he is.'</p>
<p>A shrill blast from the bo'sun's whistle was piping the hands to
quarters, and the ship suddenly became alive with briskly moving
men.</p>
<p>As the creak of windlass and the clatter of chain announced the
weighing of the anchor, and the hands went swarming aloft to set
the sails, the Major realized that their departure had been delayed
because they had waited for this voyager to come aboard. For the
second time he vaguely asked of the north-easterly breeze: 'I
wonder who the devil he may be?'</p>
<p>His tone was hardly good-humored. It was faintly tinged by the
resentment that their privacy as the sole passengers aboard the
<i>Centaur</i> should be invaded. This resentment would have been
less unreasonable could he have known that this voyager was sent by
Fortune to teach Major Sands not to treat her favours lightly.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Chapter 2. Monsieur de
Bernis</h2>
<p>To say that their curiosity on the subject of the newcomer was
gratified in the course of the next hour, when they met him at
dinner, would not be merely an overstatement, it would be in utter
conflict with the fact. That meeting, which took place in the great
cabin, where dinner was served, merely went to excite a deeper
curiosity.</p>
<p>He was presented to his two fellow passengers by Captain
Bransome as Monsieur Charles de Bernis, from which it transpired
that he was French. But the fact was hardly to have been suspected
from the smooth fluency of his English, which bore only the
faintest trace of a Gallic accent. If his nationality betrayed
itself at all, it was only in a certain freedom of gesture, and, to
the prominent blue English eyes of Major Sands, in a slightly
exaggerated air of courtliness. Major Sands, who had come prepared
to dislike him, was glad to discover in the fellow's personality no
cause to do otherwise. If there had been nothing else against the
man, his foreign origin would have been more than enough; for Major
Sands had a lofty disdain for all those who did not share his own
good fortune of having been born a Briton.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis was very tall, and if spare he yet conveyed a
sense of toughness. The lean leg in its creaseless pale blue
stocking looked as if made of whipcord. He was very swarthy, and
bore, as Major Sands perceived at once, a curious likeness to his
late Majesty King Charles II in his younger days; for the Frenchman
could be scarcely more than thirty-five. He had the same hatchet
face with its prominent cheek-bones, the same jutting chin and
nose, the same tiny black moustache above full lips about which
hovered the same faintly sardonic expression that had marked the
countenance of the Stuart sovereign. Under intensely black brows
his eyes were dark and large, and although normally soft and
velvety, they could, as he soon revealed, by a blazing directness
of glance, be extremely disconcerting.</p>
<p>If his fellow passengers were interested in him, it could hardly
be said that he returned the compliment at first. The very quality
of his courtesy towards them seemed in itself to raise a barrier
beyond which he held aloof. His air was preoccupied, and such
concern as his conversation manifested whilst they ate was directed
to the matter of his destination.</p>
<p>In this he seemed to be resuming an earlier discussion between
himself and the master of the <i>Centaur</i>.</p>
<p>'Even if you will not put in at Mariegalante, Captain, I cannot
perceive that it could delay or inconvenience you to send me ashore
in a boat.'</p>
<p>'That's because ye don't understand my reasons,' said Bransome.
'I've no mind to sail within ten miles o' Guadeloupe. If trouble
comes my way, faith, I can deal with it. But I'm not seeking it.
This is my last voyage, and I want it safe and peaceful. I've a
wife and four children at home in Devon, and it's time I were
seeing something of them. So I'm giving a wide berth to a pirate's
nest like Guadeloupe. It's bad enough to be taking you to Sainte
Croix.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that...' The Frenchman smiled and waved a long brown hand,
tossing back the fine Mechlin from his wrist.</p>
<p>But Bransome frowned at the deprecatory gesture. 'Ye may smile,
Mossoo. Ye may smile. But I know what I knows. Your French West
India Company ain't above suspicion. All they asks is a bargain,
and they don't care how they come by it. There's many a freight
goes into Sainte Croix to be sold there for a tenth of its value.
The French West India Company asks no questions, so long as it can
deal on such terms as they And it don't need to ask no questions.
The truth's plain enough. It shrieks. And that's the fact. Maybe ye
didn't know it.'</p>
<p>The Captain, a man in middle life, broad and powerful, ruddy of
hair and complexion, lent emphasis to his statement and colour to
the annoyance it stirred in him by bringing down on the table a
massive freckled hand on which the red hairs gleamed like fire.</p>
<p>'Sainte Croix since I've undertaken to carry you there. And
that's bad enough, as I say. But no Guadeloupe for me.'</p>
<p>Mistress Priscilla stirred in her seat. She leaned forward. 'Do
you speak of pirates, Captain Bransome?'</p>
<p>'Aye!' said Bransome. 'And that's the fact.'</p>
<p>Conceiving her alarmed, the Major entered the discussion with
the object of reassuring her.</p>
<p>'Faith, it's not a fact to be mentioned before a lady. And
anyway, it's a fact for the timorous only nowadays.'</p>
<p>'Oho!' Vehemently Captain Bransome blew out his cheekss.</p>
<p>'Buccaneers,' said Major Sands, 'are things of the past.'</p>
<p>The Captain's face was seen to turn a deeper red. His
contradiction took the form of elaborate sarcasm. 'To be sure, it's
as safe cruising in the Caribbean today as on any of the English
lakes.'</p>
<p>After that he gave his attention to his dinner, whilst Major
Sands addressed himself to Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>'You go with us, then, no farther than Sainte Croix?' His manner
was more pleasant than it had yet been, for his good-humour was
being restored by the discovery that this intrusion was to be only
a short one.</p>
<p>'No farther,' said Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>The laconic answer did not encourage questions. Nevertheless
Major Sands persisted.</p>
<p>'You will have interests in Sainte Croix?'</p>
<p>'No interests. No. I seek a ship. A ship to take me to France.'
It was characteristic of him to speak in short, sharp
sentences.</p>
<p>The Major was puzzled. 'But, surely, being aboard so fine a ship
as this, you might travel comfortably to Plymouth, and there find a
sloop to put you across the Channel.'</p>
<p>'True,' said Monsieur de Bernis. 'True! I had not thought of
it.'</p>
<p>The Major was conscious of a sudden apprehension that he might
have said too much. To his dismay he heard Miss Priscilla voicing
the idea which he feared he might have given to the Frenchman.</p>
<p>'You will think of it now, monsieur?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis' dark eyes glowed as they rested upon her;
but his smile was wistful.</p>
<p>'By my faith, mademoiselle, you must compel a man to do so.'</p>
<p>Major Sands sniffed audibly at what he accounted an expression
of irrepressible impudent Gallic gallantry. Then, after a slight
pause, Monsieur de Bernis added with a deepening of his wistful
smile:</p>
<p>'But, alas! A friend awaits me in Sainte Croix. I am to cross
with him to France.'</p>
<p>The Major interposed, a mild astonishment in his voice.</p>
<p>'I thought it was at Guadeloupe that you desired to be put
ashore, and that your going to Sainte Croix was forced upon you by
the Captain.'</p>
<p>If he thought to discompose Monsieur de Bernis by confronting
him with this contradiction, he was soon disillusioned. The
Frenchman turned to him slowly still smiling, but the wistfulness
had given place to a contemptuous amusement.</p>
<p>'But why unveil the innocent deception which courtesy to a lady
thrust upon me? It is more shrewd than kind, Major Sands.'</p>
<p>Major Sands flushed. He writhed under the Frenchman's superior
smile, and in his discomfort blundered grossly.</p>
<p>'What need for deceptions, sir?'</p>
<p>'Add, too: what need for courtesy? Each to his nature, sir. You
convict me of a polite deceit, and discover yourself to be of a
rude candour. Each of us in his different way is admirable.'</p>
<p>'That is something to which I can't agree at all. Stab me if I
can.'</p>
<p>'Let mademoiselle pronounce between us, then,' the Frenchman
smilingly invited.</p>
<p>But Miss Priscilla shook her golden head. 'That would be to
pronounce against one of you. Too invidious a task.'</p>
<p>'Forgive me, then, for venturing to set it. Well leave the
matter undecided.' He turned to Captain Bransome, 'You said, I
think, Captain, that you are calling at Dominica.' Thus he turned
the conversation into different channels.</p>
<p>The Major was left with an uncomfortable sense of being
diminished. It rankled in him, and found expression later when with
Miss Priscilla he was once more upon the poop.</p>
<p>'I do not think the Frenchman was pleased at being put down,'
said he.</p>
<p>At table the Major's scarcely veiled hostility to the stranger
had offended her sense of fitness. In her eyes he had compared
badly with the suave and easy Frenchman. His present smugness
revived her irritation.</p>
<p>'Was he put down?' said she. 'I did not observe it.'</p>
<p>'You did not...' The prominent pale eyes seemed to swell in his
florid face. Then he laughed boisterously. 'You were day-dreaming,
Priscilla, surely. You cannot have attended. I let him see plainly
that I was not to be hoodwinked by his contradictions. I'm never
slow to perceive deceit. It annoyed him to be so easily
exposed.'</p>
<p>'He dissembled his annoyance very creditably.'</p>
<p>'Oh, aye! As a dissembler I give him full credit. But I could
see that I had touched him. Stab me, I could. D'ye perceive the
extent of his dissimulation? First it was only that he had not
thought of crossing the ocean in the <i>Centaur</i>. Then it was
that he has a friend awaiting him in Sainte Croix, and I, knowing
all the while that Sainte Croix was forced upon him by the Captain
who could not be persuaded to land him, as he wished, at
Guadeloupe. I wonder what the fellow has to hide that he should be
so desperately clumsy?'</p>
<p>'Whatever it is, it can be no affair of ours.'</p>
<p>'You make too sure, perhaps. After all, I am an officer of the
Crown, and it's scarcely less than my duty to be aware of all that
happens in these waters.'</p>
<p>'Why plague yourself? In a day or two he will have left us
again.'</p>
<p>'To be sure. And I thank God for 't.'</p>
<p>'I see little cause for thanksgiving. Monsieur de Bernis should
prove a lively companion on a voyage.'</p>
<p>The Major's brows were raised. 'You conceive him lively?'</p>
<p>'Did not you? Was there no wit in his parries when you engaged
him?'</p>
<p>'Wit! Lord! I thought him as clumsy a bar as I have met.'</p>
<p>A black hat embellished by a sweeping plume of blue appeared
above the break of the quarter-deck. Monsieur de Bernis was
ascending the companion. He came to join them on the poop.</p>
<p>The Major was disposed to regard his advent as an unbidden
intrusion. But Miss Priscilla's eyes gleamed a welcome to the
courtly Frenchman; and when she moved aside invitingly to the head
of the day-bed, so as to make room for him to sit beside her, Major
Sands must mask his vexation as best he could in chill
civilities.</p>
<p>Martinique by now was falling hazily astern, and the
<i>Centaur</i> under a full spread of canvas was beating to
westward with a larboard list that gently canted her yellow
deck.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis commended the north-easterly breeze in terms
of one familiar with such matters. They were fortunate in it, he
opined. At this season of the year, the prevailing wind was from
the north. He expressed the further opinion that if it held they
should he off Dominica before tomorrow's dawn.</p>
<p>The Major, not to be left behind by Monsieur de Bernis in the
display of knowledge of Caribbean matters, announced himself
astonished that Captain Bransome should he putting in at an island
mainly peopled by Caribs, with only an indifferent French
settlement at Roseau. The readiness of the Frenchman's answer took
him by surprise.</p>
<p>'For freights in the ordinary way I should agree with you,
Major. Roseau would not be worth a visit; but for a Captain trading
on his own account it can he very profitable. This, you may suppose
to be the case of Captain Bransome.'</p>
<p>The accuracy of his surmise was revealed upon the morrow, when
they lay at anchor before Roseau, on the western side of Dominica.
Bransome, who traded in partnership with his owners, went ashore
for a purchase of hides, for which he had left himself abundant
room under hatches. He knew of some French traders here, from whom
he could buy at half the price he would have to pay in Martinique
or elsewhere; for the Caribs who slew and flayed the beasts were
content with infinitely less than it cost to procure and maintain
the Negro slaves who did the work in the more established
settlements.</p>
<p>Since the loading of the hides was to delay them there for a day
or two, Monsieur de Bernis proposed to his fellow passengers an
excursion to the interior of the island, a proposal so warmly
approved by Miss Priscilla that it was instantly adopted.</p>
<p>They procured ponies ashore, and the three of them, attended
only by Pierre, de Bernis' half-caste servant, rode out to view
that marvel of Dominica, the boiling lake, and the fertile plains
watered by the Layou.</p>
<p>The Major would have insisted upon an escort. But Monsieur de
Bernis, again displaying his knowledge of these regions, assured
them that they would find the Caribs of Dominica a gentle, friendly
race, from whom no evil was to be apprehended.</p>
<p>'If it were otherwise,' he concluded, 'the whole ship's company
would not suffice to protect us, and I should never have proposed
the jaunt.'</p>
<p>Priscilla rode that day between her two cavaliers; but it was
the ready-witted de Bernis who chiefly held her attention, until
Major Sands began to wonder whether the fellow's remarkable
resemblance to his late Majesty might not extend beyond his
personal appearance. Monsieur de Bernis made it plain, the Major
thought, that he was endowed with the same gifts of spontaneous
gallantry; and the Major was vexed to perceive signs that he
possessed something of King Charles' attraction for the opposite
sex.</p>
<p>His alarm might have gone considerably deeper but for the
soothing knowledge that in a day or two this long-legged,
gipsy-faced interloper would drop out of their lives at Sainte
Croix. What Miss Priscilla could discern in the man, that she
should bestow so much of her attention upon him, the Major could
not imagine. As compared with his own solid worth, the fellow was
no better than a shallow fribble. It was inconceivable that
Priscilla should be dazzled by his pinchbeck glitter. And yet,
women, even the best of them, were often, he knew, led into error
by a lack of discernment. Therefore it was matter for thankfulness
that this adventurer's contact with their own lives was destined to
be so transient. If it were protracted, the rascal might become
aware of the great fortune Miss Priscilla had inherited, and
undoubtedly he would find in this an incentive to exert all the
arts of attraction which such a fellow might command.</p>
<p>That he was an adventurer Major Sands was persuaded. He
flattered himself that he could read a man at a glance, and his
every instinct warned him against this saturnine rascal. His
persuasions were confirmed that very evening at Roseau.</p>
<p>On the beach there, when they had relinquished their ponies,
they came upon a burly, elderly, rudely clad Frenchman, who reeked
of rum and tobacco, one of the traders from whom Captain Bransome
was purchasing his hides. The man halted before them as if
thunder-struck, and stared in round-eyed wonder al Monsieur de
Bernis for a long moment. Then a queer grin spread upon his
weather-beaten face, he pulled a ragged hat from a grizzled,
ill-kempt head, with a courtesy rendered ironical by
exaggeration.</p>
<p>Major Sands knew no French. But the impudently familiar tone of
the greeting was not to be mistaken.</p>
<p>'C'est bien toi, de Bernis? Pardieu! Je ne croyais pas te
revoir.'</p>
<p>De Bernis checked to answer him, and his reply reflected the
other's easy, half-mocking tone. 'Et toi, mon drôle? Ah, tu fais le
marchand de peaux maintenant?'</p>
<p>Major Sands moved on with Miss Priscilla, leaving de Bernis in
talk with his oddly met acquaintance. The Major was curiously
amused.</p>
<p>'A queer encounter for our fine gentleman. Most queer. Like the
quality of his friends. More than ever I wonder who the devil he
may be.</p>
<p>But Miss Priscilla was impatient of his wonder and his
amusement. She found him petty. She knew the islands better, it
seemed, than did he. She knew that colonial life could impose the
oddest associations on a man, and that only the rash or the
ignorant would draw conclusions from them.</p>
<p>She said something of the kind.</p>
<p>'Odds life, ma'am! D'ye defend him?'</p>
<p>'I've not perceived him to be attacked, unless you mean to
attack him, Bart. After all, Monsieur de Bernis has never pretended
that he comes to us from Versailles.'</p>
<p>'That will be because he doubts if it would carry conviction.
Pish, child! The fellow's an adventurer.'</p>
<p>Her agreement shocked and dismayed him more than contradiction
could have done.</p>
<p>'So I had supposed,' she smiled distractingly. 'I love
adventurers and the adventurous.'</p>
<p>Only the fact that de Bernis came striding to overtake them
saved her from a homily But her answer, which the Major accounted
flippant, rankled with him; and it may have been due to this that
after supper that night, when they were all assembled in the great
cabin, he alluded to the matter of that meeting.</p>
<p>'That was a queer chance, Monsieur de Bernis, your coming face
to face with an acquaintance here on Dominica.'</p>
<p>'A queer chance, indeed,' the Frenchman agreed readily. 'That
was an old brother-in-arms.'</p>
<p>The Major's sandy brows went up. 'Ye've been a soldier,
sir?'</p>
<p>There was an odd light in the Frenchman's eyes as for a long
moment they considered his questioner. He seemed faintly amused.</p>
<p>'Oh, after a fashion,' he said at last. Then he swung to Bransome,
who sat at his ease now, in cotton shirt and calico drawers, the
European finery discarded. 'It was Lafarche, Captain. He tells me
that he is trading with you.' And he went on: 'We were on Santa
Catalina together under the Sieur Simon, and amongst the very few
who survived the Spanish raid there of Perez de Guzman. Lafarche
and I and two others, who had hidden ourselves in a maize field,
when all was lost, got away that night in an open boat, and
contrived to reach the Main. I was wounded, and my left arm had
been broken by a piece of langrel during the bombardment. But all
evils do not come to hurt us, as the Italians say. It saved my
life. For it was my uselessness drove me into hiding, where the
other three afterwards joined me. They were the first wounds I
took. I was under twenty at the time. Only my youth and my vigour
saved my arm and my life in the trials and hardships that followed.
So far as I know we were the only four who escaped alive of the
hundred and twenty men who were on Santa Catalina with Simon. When
Perez took the island, he ruthlessly avenged the defence it had
made by putting to the sword every man who had remained alive. A
vile massacre. A wanton cruelty.'</p>
<p>He fell pensive, and might have left the matter there but that
Miss Priscilla broke the ensuing silence to press him for more
details.</p>
<p>In yielding, he told her of the colony which Mansvelt had
established on Santa Catalina, of how they had gone to work to
cultivate the land, planting maize and plantains, sweet potatoes,
cassava, and tobacco. Whilst she listened to him with parted lips
and softened eyes, he drew a picture of the flourishing condition
which had been reached by the plantations when Don Juan Perez de
Guzman came over from Panama, with four ships and an overwhelming
force, to wreak his mischief. He told of Simon's proud answer when
summoned to surrender: that he held the settlement for the English
Crown, and that sooner than yield it up, he and those with him
would yield up their lives. He stirred their blood by the picture
he drew of the gallant stand made by that little garrison against
the overwhelming Spanish odds. And he moved them to compassion by
the tale of the massacre that followed and the wanton destruction
of the plantations so laboriously hoed.</p>
<p>When he reached the end, there was a smile at once grim and
wistful on his lean, gipsy-tinted face. The deep lines in it, lines
far deeper than were warranted by his years, became more
marked.</p>
<p>'The Spaniards paid for it at Porto Bello and at Panama and
elsewhere. My God, how they paid! But not all the Spanish blood
that has since been shed could avenge the brutal, cowardly
destruction of the English and the French who were in alliance at
Santa Catalina.'</p>
<p>He had impressed himself upon them by that glimpse into his past
and into the history of West Indian settlements. Even the Major,
however he might struggle against it, found himself caught in the
spell of this queer fellow's personality.</p>
<p>Later, when supper was done, and the table had been cleared,
Monsieur de Bernis went to fetch a guitar from among the effects in
his cabin. Seated on the stern-locker, with his back to the great
window that stood open to the purple tropical night, he sang some
little songs of his native Provence and one or two queerly moving
Spanish airs set in the minor key, of the kind that were freely
composed in Malaga.</p>
<p>Rendered by his mellow baritone voice they had power to leave
Miss Priscilla with stinging eyes and an ache at the heart; and
even Major Sands was moved to admit that Monsieur de Bernis had a
prodigious fine gift of song. But he took care to make the
admission with patronage, as if to mark the gulf that lay between
himself and his charge on the one hand and this stranger, met by
chance, on the other. He accounted it a necessary precaution,
because he could not be blind to the impression the fellow was
making upon Miss Priscilla's inexperience. It was also, no doubt,
because of this that on the morrow the Major permitted himself a
sneer at Monsieur de Bernis' expense. It went near to making a
breach between himself and the lady in his charge.</p>
<p>They were leaning at the time upon the carved rail of the
quarterdeck to watch the loading, conducted under the jealous eyes
of Captain Bransome, himself, who was not content to leave the
matter to the quartermaster and the boatswain.</p>
<p>The coamings were off the main hatch, and by slings from the
yardarm the bales of hides were being hoisted aboard from the rafts
that brought them alongside. In the waist a dozen hairy seamen,
naked above their belts, heaved and sweated in the merciless heat,
whilst down in the stifling, reeking gloom of the hold others
laboured at the stowage. The Captain, in cotton shirt and drawers,
the blue kerchief swathing his cropped red head, his ruddy,
freckled face agleam with sweat, moved hither and thither,
directing the hoisting and stowing, and at times, from sheer
exuberance of energy, lending a powerful hand at the ropes.</p>
<p>Into this sweltering bustle stepped Monsieur de Bernis from the
gangway that led aft. As a concession to the heat he wore no coat.
In the bulging white cambric shirt with its wealth of ruffles,
clothing him above a pair of claret breeches, he looked cool and
easy despite his heavy black periwig and broad black hat.</p>
<p>He greeted Bransome with familiar ease, and not only Bransome,
but Sproat, the boatswain. From the bulwarks he stood surveying the
rafts below with their silent crews of naked Caribs and noisily
directing French overseers. He called down to them--Major Sands
assumed it to be some French ribaldry--and set them laughing and
answering him with raucously merry freedom. He said something to
the hands about the hatchway, and had them presently all agrin.
Then, when the trader Lafarche came climbing to the deck, mopping
himself, and demanding rum, there was de Bernis supporting the
demand, and thrusting Bransome before him to the after gangway,
whilst himself he followed, bringing Lafarche with him, an arm
flung carelessly about the villainous old trader's shoulder.</p>
<p>'A raffish fellow, without dignity or sense of discipline,' was
the Major's disgusted comment.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla looked at him sideways, and a little frown
puckered her brow at the root of her daintily chiselled nose.</p>
<p>'That is not how I judge him.'</p>
<p>'No?' He was surprised. He uncrossed his plump legs, took his
elbows from the poop-rail, and stood up, a heavy figure rendered
the more ponderous by an air of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>'Yet seeing him there, so very much at ease with that riff-raff,
how else should he be read? I should be sorry to see myself in the
like case. Stab me, I should.'</p>
<p>'You stand in no danger of it.'</p>
<p>'I thank-you. No.'</p>
<p>'Because a man needs to be very sure of himself before he can
condescend so far.' It was a little cruel. But his sneering tone of
superiority had annoyed her curiously.</p>
<p>Astonishment froze him. 'I...I do not think I understand. Stab
me if I do.'</p>
<p>She was as merciless in her explanation, unintimidated by his
frosty tone.</p>
<p>'I see Monsieur de Bernis a man placed by birth and experience
above the petty need of standing upon his dignity.'</p>
<p>The Major collected the wits that had been scattered by angry
amazement. After a gasping moment, he laughed. Derision he thought
was the surest corrosive to apply to such heresies.</p>
<p>'Lord! Here's assumption! And birth, you say. Fan me, ye winds!
What tokens of birth do you perceive in the tawdry fellow?'</p>
<p>'His name; his bearing; his...'</p>
<p>But the Major let her get no further. Again he laughed. 'His
name? The "de," you mean. Faith, it's borne by many who have long
since lost pretensions to gentility, and by many who never had a
right to it. Do we even know that it is his name? As for his
bearing, pray consider it. You saw him down there, making himself
one with the hands, and the rest. Would a gentleman so comport
himself?'</p>
<p>'We come back to the beginning,' said she coolly. 'I have given
you reason why such as he may do it without loss. You do not answer
me.'</p>
<p>He found her exasperating. But he did not tell her so. He curbed
his rising heat. A lady so well endowed must be humoured by a
prudent man who looks to make her his wife. And Major Sands was a
very prudent man.</p>
<p>'But, dear Priscilla, it is because you will not be answered.
You are a little obstinate, child.' He smiled to humour her. 'You
should trust to my riper judgement of men. You should so, stab me.'
And then he changed his tone. 'But why waste breath on a man who
tomorrow or the next day will have gone, and whom we shall never
see again?'</p>
<p>She sighed, and gently waved her fan. It may be that her next
words were uttered merely to plague and punish him. 'I take no
satisfaction in the thought. We meet so few whom we are concerned
ever to meet again. To me Monsieur de Bernis is one of those
few.'</p>
<p>'In that case,' said he, holding himself hard to keep his voice
cool and level, 'I thank God the gentleman is so soon to go his
ways. In these outlandish settlements you have had hale chance, my
dear, of learning--ah--discrimination in the choice of associates.
A few months in England will give you a very different
outlook.'</p>
<p>'Yes. That is probable,' said she, with a sweet submissiveness.
'Until now I have been compelled to accept the associations which
circumstance has thrust upon me. In England it will be mine to
choose.'</p>
<p>This was a little devastating in its ambiguity. If he was left
in doubt of her real meaning, he was in no doubt that, before
England was reached and the choice afforded her, he would have
placed her beyond the need of exercising it in so far as a husband
was concerned.</p>
<p>But she had not yet completed her task of chastening his
superciliousness.</p>
<p>'As for Monsieur de Bernis, it yet might be possible to persuade
him to make the voyage with us. Good company upon a voyage is not
to be disdained. The time can he monstrous tedious.'</p>
<p>He stared at her, his florid face inflamed. She smiled up at him
over the edge of her fan, very sweetly.</p>
<p>'Will you try to persuade him, Bart?'</p>
<p>'I? Persuade him?' He spoke in horror. 'Stab my vitals! Persuade
him? I? You jest, Of course.'</p>
<p>She laughed a trilling little enigmatic laugh, and was content
to leave the matter there.</p>
<p>Later, whilst still they lingered on the quarter, they were
sought by Monsieur de Bernis. He came laden with a basket woven of
palmetto, containing fresh oranges and limes. He brought it as an
offering to Miss Priscilla, announcing that he had sent Pierre, his
half-caste servant, ashore to gather the fruit for her that
morning. Graciously she accepted, thanking him. He waved the thanks
aside.</p>
<p>'A very trifling gift.'</p>
<p>'In gifts, sir, it is the thought that counts.'</p>
<p>The Major was left considering that he must practise
thoughtfulness in future. He remained silent and brooding, whilst
Monsieur de Bernis hung there in talk with Miss Priscilla. The
Frenchman was gay, witty, and amusing, and to the Major it seemed
that Miss Priscilla was very easily moved to laughter. His
stolidity leaving him little skill in the lighter social arts, he
became increasingly uneasy. What if this French adventurer, growing
too conscious of Miss Priscilla's attractions, were after all to
decide to make the voyage to Europe on the <i>Centaur</i>? What if
Miss Priscilla, whose laughter and general manner seemed in the
Major's jaundiced eyes to be almost tinged with wantonness, should
so far forget her dignity as, herself, to invite de Bernis to such
a course?</p>
<p>Major Sands, inwardly cursing the delays resulting from these
loadings of hides, was surly and uneasy all that day. His chance,
however, and his revenge upon the man who had occasioned him these
pangs was unexpectedly to be vouchsafed him that evening at
supper.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>Chapter 3. Bransome's
Prayer</h2>
<p>The <i>Centaur</i> left Dominica a little before sunset, and
with the wind on her starboard quarter set a westerly course for
the Isle of Ayes, so as to give a wide berth to Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>Having conned the ship, the Captain went below to supper, and
came in high good-humour to the spacious cabin, flanked to port and
starboard by the lesser cabins which his passengers were now
occupying.</p>
<p>The great horn windows in the stem stood wide to the air and to
the green receding mass of the island, which Captain Bransome
announced without a sigh that he would never see again. His
good-humour was rooted in the fact that his last call made and his
cargo safely stowed, he was now definitely setting his face towards
home and the serene ease in the bosom of a family that scarcely
knew him. Nevertheless, he went in confidence that, like himself,
this family looked forward joyously to his retirement from the sea
and to assisting him in garnering the reward for all these years of
labour bravely shouldered and for all the perils and hardships
confronted without shrinking.</p>
<p>Contentment made him more than ordinarily loquacious, as he sat
there in shirt and drawers, a burly, jovial figure at the head of
his own table, with Sam, the white-jacketed Negro steward, in
attendance and Monsieur de Bernis' servant lending him assistance.
A feast was spread that evening. There was fresh meat and turtle
and vegetables taken aboard that day, and the roasted flesh of a
great albacore that Monsieur de Bernis had caught in the course of
the afternoon; and in honour of what to him was a great occasion,
Captain Bransome regaled them with a sweet Peruvian wine which his
own rude taste accounted very choice.</p>
<p>In this wine Monsieur de Bernis pledged his safe return and many
happy years in the bosom of that family of which so far the Captain
had seen so little.</p>
<p>'Seems queer,' the Captain said, 'that a man should scarcely
know his own children. Unnatural. There's four fine lads well-nigh
grown to manhood, and all but strangers to me that got 'em.' A
pensive smile lighted the broad ruddy features of his good-humoured
face. 'But the future is ours now, and it'll have to make amends to
me for the past. Aye, and to that sweet patient woman o' mine who
waits at Babbicombe. I'll be beside her now to show her that the
years I've been away ha'n't been wasted. And this last voyage o'
mine'll prove the most prosperous of all. There's a mort o' money
in them hides when we comes to market them at home. Old Lafarche
has served me well this trip.'</p>
<p>The mention of the old French trader shifted the current of his
thoughts. He looked at Monsieur de Bernis, who sat alone on one
side of the board, his back to the light, opposite the Major and
the lady who were side by side on the master's right.</p>
<p>'Queer, your meeting the old buccaneer again like that, by
chance, after all these years. And queer, too, that I should not
have remembered who ye were, for all that your name was kind of
familiar, until old Lafarche reminded me.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' de Bernis quietly agreed. 'Life is a matter of queer
chances. It made me feel old to meet him and to see into what he
has grown. That's the result of beginning life whilst most men are
still at school.'</p>
<p>The Major had pricked up his ears. Here were interesting facts.
Facts to be investigated.</p>
<p>'D'ye say that French trader was once a buccaneer?'</p>
<p>It was de Bernis who answered him. 'Faith, we were little better
at Santa Catalina. And after that we sailed with Morgan.'</p>
<p>'With Morgan?' The Major could hardly believe his ears. 'D'ye
mean Henry Morgan?'</p>
<p>'Sir Henry Morgan. Yes. He that is now Governor of Jamaica.'</p>
<p>'But...' The Major paused, frowning. 'D'ye say that you, too,
sailed with him? With Morgan?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis did not seem to remark the incredulity in the
other's voice. He answered simply and naturally.</p>
<p>'Why, yes. And I marched with him, too. I was at Porto Bello
with him, and at Panama. At Panama I was in command of the French
contingent of his forces. We took a proud vengeance then for the
blood that was shed at Santa Catalina.'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla looked brightly alert and eager. Without
knowledge of West Indian affairs to perceive the implications that
had shocked the Major, she was aware only that here was another
story of brave doings, and hoped that Monsieur de Bernis would he
induced to tell it. But the Major's face was blank and seemed to
have lost some of its high colour. He reflected with satisfaction
upon his own shrewdness which had discerned this man's true quality
under his airs and graces, his swaggering gallantry and his
troubadour arts. In dubbing him an adventurer he had erred on the
side of charity.</p>
<p>There fell a long pause, during which Monsieur de Bernis helped
himself to a slab of guava cheese and poured himself another cup of
the Peruvian wine. He was setting down the squat bottle when at
last the Major exploded.</p>
<p>'So that ye're just...just a damned pirate! A damned pirate!
And, stab me, ye've the effrontery to confess it!'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla and the Captain cried out upon him simultaneously
in alarm.</p>
<p>'Bart!' ejaculated the lady.</p>
<p>'Major Sands, sir!' exclaimed the Captain.</p>
<p>Condemnation was in the voice of each. But Monsieur de Bernis
showed no resentment. He smiled upon their dismay and waved a long
fine hand to pacify them.</p>
<p>'A pirate?' Almost he seemed amused. 'Ah, no, A filibuster,
please. A buccaneer.'</p>
<p>The Major curled his heavy lip. 'And the difference?'</p>
<p>'The difference? Oh, but all the difference in the world.'</p>
<p>Captain Bransome came to the rescue with the explanation which
Monsieur de Bernis seemed to disdain to offer. The buccaneers had a
sort of charter behind them. They had been encouraged by the
Governments of both England and France, because they had kept in
check the rapacity of Spain, confining their raids to Spanish ships
and Spanish settlements.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis was moved by this to take up the tale. 'And
doing it as I'll swear none others could have done it. You would
not sneer, Major Sands, had you crossed Darien with us.'</p>
<p>He was launched upon reminiscences. He began to tell them of
that incredibly arduous journey made partly on foot and partly by
water on the Chagres River. He described the hardships they had
confronted and overcome: how for eight days they had gone without
food, save an occasional evil-tasting musk-flavoured alligator's
egg; how they had been constrained to eat strips of hide, consuming
even their own belts to cheat their famished stomachs; and how it
was in a spent condition that at last they had staggered into sight
of Panama, which, forewarned, had mobilized to receive them, with
guns and horses, outnumbering them in men by three to one.</p>
<p>'If the Spaniards had only driven in their cattle from the
savannah where we lay the night before the battle, starvation must
have made us an easy prey to them. I should not now be telling you
of these things. But the cattle were there, the steers and horses,
and we took and killed what we required, and ate the flesh almost
raw And so, by the grace of God, we found the strength to deliver
the attack, and carry the town in the teeth of its defenders.'</p>
<p>'By the grace of God!' said the Major, scandalized. 'It is
blasphemy, sir.'</p>
<p>De Bernis was singularly patient.</p>
<p>'Ye're intolerant, Major,' was all he said.</p>
<p>'Of thieving rogues? To be sure, I am. I call a thing by its
proper name. Ye can throw no glamour over the sack of Panama, sir.
With whatever arts you tell the tale of it, it remains a thieving
raid, and the men who took part in it--Morgan and his
cut-throats--were just bloodthirsty, thieving scoundrels.'</p>
<p>Before such direct offensiveness Captain Bransome became deeply
alarmed. Whatever Monsieur de Bernis might be today, it was certain
that, since once he had followed the trade of a buccaneer, there
must be wild blood in him. If it were roused, there might he
mischief done; and he wanted none of that aboard the
<i>Centaur</i>. He was considering intervention, when the
Frenchman, who, whatever he may have felt, still betrayed no
outward sign of irritation, forestalled him.</p>
<p>'By my faith, Major, do you realize that what you say is almost
treason? It is a reproach to your King, who does not share your so
sensitive honesty. For if he regarded Henry Morgan as you describe
him, he would never have raised him to the dignity of knighthood
and made him Governor of Jamaica.'</p>
<p>'And that's the fact,' Captain Bransome supported him, hoping to
curb the Major's rashness. 'And ye should also be told that
Monsieur de Bernis here holds the appointment of Sir Henry Morgan's
lieutenant, to help him keep order upon the seas.'</p>
<p>Contradiction came not from the Major, but from Monsieur de
Bernis himself.</p>
<p>'Ah, but that is over now. I have resigned my post. Like
yourself, Captain, I am going home to enjoy the rest I have
earned.'</p>
<p>'No matter for that. The fact that ye held the post, held the
King's commission in spite of Panama and Porto Bello and the rest,
should be answer enough for Major Sands.'</p>
<p>But Major Sands was not to be put down. 'Ye know very well that
was but setting a thief to catch a thief. You may sing the praises
of your buccaneers never so eloquently, sir. But you know they had
become such a pest that to deliver the seas of them your friend
Henry Morgan was bribed with a knighthood and a King's commission
to turn upon his old associates.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis shrugged, and sank back into his chair,
quietly sipping his wine. His manner, faintly contemptuous, showed
that he withdrew from the discussion. Captain Bransome took it up
in his place.</p>
<p>'However it may have been, we've Sir Henry Morgan to thank for
it that we can sail in safety now. That at least will be something
to his credit.'</p>
<p>Major sneered. 'He's been constrained to it,' was his grudging
admission. 'They've had him home once, and very nearly hanged him
for the disloyal way in which he neglected the duty for which he
was paid and commissioned. As if loyalty were to be looked for in
such men. It was only that danger awakened him to the necessity to
keep faith with those who had paid him in advance. I'll own that
since then he seems to have gone more vigorously about the business
of sweeping the seas clean. But that don't make me forget that it
was he and his kind who fouled them.'</p>
<p>'Don't grudge him his due, Major,' Bransome pleaded. 'It's to be
doubted if another could ha' done what he has done. It needed him
with his own lads behind him to tackle the disorders afloat, and
put an end to them.'</p>
<p>But the Major would not yield. In the heat of argument and
exasperation he plunged recklessly into matters from which,
yesterday, concern for Priscilla had made him steer them. 'Put an
end to it? I seem to have heard of a buccaneering villain named Tom
Leach who still goes roaring up and clown the Caribbean, setting
Morgan at defiance.'</p>
<p>Bransome's face darkened. 'Tom Leach, aye. Rot his soul! But
Morgan'll get him. It's known from Campeche to Trinidad and from
Trinidad to the Bahamas that Morgan is offering five hundred pounds
for the head of the last of the buccaneers.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis stirred. He set down his wine-glass.</p>
<p>'That is not a buccaneer, Captain. It offends me to hear you say
it. Tom Leach is just a nasty pirate.'</p>
<p>'And that's the fact,' Bransome approved him. 'As wicked a
cut-throat as was ever loose upon the seas. An inhuman beast,
without honour and without mercy, making war upon all, and intent
only upon robbery and plunder.'</p>
<p>And he fell to relating horrors of Leach's performance, until de
Bernis raised a long graceful hand to check him.</p>
<p>'You nauseate Miss Priscilla.'</p>
<p>Made aware of her pallor, the Captain begged her pardon, and
closed the subject with a prayer.</p>
<p>'God send that filthy villain may soon come to moorings in
execution dock.'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla intervened.</p>
<p>'You have talked enough of pirates,' she censured them, and
rendered the Major at last aware of his enormity.</p>
<p>She leaned across to Monsieur de Bernis, smiling up at him,
perhaps all the more sweetly because she desired to reward him for
his admirable patience and self-restraint under provocation that
had been gross. 'Monsieur de Bernis, will you not fetch your
guitar, and sing to us again?'</p>
<p>The Frenchman rose to do her bidding, whilst Major Sands was
left to marvel ill-humouredly that all that had been revealed
touching this adventurer's abominable antecedents should have made
so little impression upon the lady in his charge. Decidedly she was
in urgent need of a season of the sedate dignity of English county
life to bring the world into correct perspective to her eyes.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>Chapter 4. The Pursuit</h2>
<p>The historical truth of the situation, as it concerned Sir Henry
Morgan and the notorious Tom Leach, emerges so clearly from that
conversation in the cabin of the <i>Centaur</i> that little remains
to be added by a commentator.</p>
<p>Morgan had certainly been shaken up by the authorities at home
for his lack of zeal in the prosecution of the task entrusted to
him of exterminating the sea-brigands who infested the Caribbean.
He had been admonished with more severity than justice; for, after
all, in the short time that had elapsed since his own retirement
from the Brotherhood of the Coast, he had wrought miracles in the
discharge of the duty assumed. The very force of his example had in
itself gone far. The very fact that he had ranged himself under the
banners of law and order, with the consequent disbanding of the
buccaneer fleet of which he had been the admiral, had compelled the
men who had followed him to drift back gradually to the peaceful
arts of logwood-cutting, planting, and boucanning proper. Many more
had been induced to quit the seas by the general amnesty Morgan had
been authorized to proclaim, backed by a grant of twenty-five acres
of land to every filibuster who should choose to take advantage of
it. Those who defiantly remained afloat he pursued so actively and
relentlessly as to have deserved better of the Government than a
reprimand and the threat of deposition and worse. Because in spite
of his endeavours there were some sea-robbers who still eluded him,
the authorities at home did not scruple to suggest that Morgan
might be playing a double game and might be receiving tribute from
those who still remained at large.</p>
<p>Sir Henry was not merely enraged by the insinuation; he was
fearful of a solid indictment being built upon it which might end
by depriving him of his head. It made the old pirate realize that
in accepting a knighthood and the King's commission he had given
stern hostages to Fortune. And whilst he may have cursed the one
and the other, he addressed himself fearfully to the business of
satisfying his terrible taskmasters. The business was rendered
heavy by the lawless activities of his old associate Tom Leach,
whom Major Sands had named. Tom Leach, as crafty a seaman as he was
a brutal, remorseless scoundrel, had gathered about him a host of
those buccaneers who were reluctant to forsake their old ways of
life, and with these, in a powerful forty-gun ship, the <i>Black
Swan</i>, he was in strength upon the Caribbean and wreaking
fearful havoc. Being outlawed now, an Ishmael with every man's hand
against him, he practised none of the old discrimination of the
Brethren of the Coast, as the buccaneers had been called. He was
just a brigand, making war upon every ship that sailed, and caring
nothing what flag was flown by the vessels he captured, stripped,
and sank.</p>
<p>For four anxious months, Morgan had been hunting him in vain,
and so as to encourage others to hunt him, he had put the price of
five hundred pounds upon the ruffian's head. Not only had Leach
eluded him and grown ever more defiant in his depredations, but two
months ago off Granada, when two ships of the Jamaica squadron had
cornered him, he had delivered battle so successfully that he had
sunk one of the Government frigates and disabled the other.</p>
<p>Well might Captain Bransome have uttered his prayer that this
evil villain should soon come to moorings in execution dock. The
following morning was to bring him the urgent dread that, if the
prayer was to be answered at all, it was not likely to be answered
in time to be of profit to the <i>Centaur</i>.</p>
<p>Going early on deck to take the air and summon his fellow
passengers to breakfast, Monsieur de Bernis found the Captain on
the poop, levelling a telescope at a ship some three or four miles
away to eastward on their starboard quarter. Beside him stood Major
Sands in his burnt-red coat and Miss Priscilla very dainty in a
gown of lettuce-green with ivory lace that revealed the lissom
beauty of her milk-white neck.</p>
<p>The wind which had veered to the north had freshened a little
since dawn, and swept the ship with a grateful coolness. With
topsails furled, and a considerable list to larboard, the
<i>Centaur</i> was rippling through the sea on a course almost due
west. She was still some leagues south-east of Ayes, and land was
nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>The master lowered his telescope as de Bernis came up. Turning
his head, and seeing the Frenchman, he first pointed with the
glass, then proffered it.</p>
<p>'Tell me what you make of her, Mossoo.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis took the glass. He had not observed the grave
look in Bransome's eyes, for he displayed no urgency in complying.
He paused first to exchange a greeting with Miss Priscilla and the
Major. But when at last he did bear the glass to his eye, he kept
it there for an unconscionable time. When he lowered it, his
countenance reflected the gravity worn by the Captain's. Even then
he did not speak. He stepped deliberately to the side, and setting
his elbows on the rail for steadiness, levelled the glass once
more. This time his observations were even more protracted.</p>
<p>He scanned the tall black hull of that distant ship and the
black beak-head carved in the shape of a swan with a gilded crest.
He attempted to count the gun ports on her larboard flank as far as
this was revealed by the course she was steering. With the same
leisureliness he surveyed the mountain of canvas under which she
moved, with every sail unfurled, and above which flew no flag.</p>
<p>So long was he in this inspection that at last the Captain's
hard-held patience slipped from him.</p>
<p>'Well, sir? Well? What dye make of her?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis lowered the glass again, and faced his
questioner. He was calm and smiling.</p>
<p>'A fine, powerful ship,' he said casually, and turned to the
others. 'Breakfast waits in the cabin.'</p>
<p>The Major, whose appetite was never feeble, required no further
invitation. He departed, taking Miss Priscilla with him.</p>
<p>As they disappeared into the gangway leading aft, the smile left
the face of Monsieur de Bernis. Solemnly his long dark eyes met the
Captain's uneasily questioning glance.</p>
<p>'I desired not to alarm the lady. It is as I think you already
suspect. Tom Leach's ship. The <i>Black Swan</i>.'</p>
<p>'Ye're certain?'</p>
<p>'As certain as that she's steering to cross your course.'</p>
<p>The Captain swore in his red beard. 'And this on my last
voyage!' he complained. 'Fate might ha' let me end my sailing days
in peace. Ye think...D'ye think she means to attack me?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis shrugged. 'It is Tom Leach. And he steers to
cross your course.'</p>
<p>The Captain fell to ranting and swearing as a man will who is
spirited and yet conscious of impotence when beset. 'The
black-hearted, blackguardly swine! What's your fine Sir Henry
Morgan doing to leave him loose upon the seas? What for did the
King knight him and make him Governor of Jamaica?'</p>
<p>'Sir Henry will get him in the end. Be sure of that.'</p>
<p>The Frenchman's calm in the face of this overwhelming peril
served only to increase the Captain's fury. 'In the end! In the
end! And how will that help me? What's to be done?'</p>
<p>'What can you do?'</p>
<p>'I must fight or run.'</p>
<p>'Which would you prefer?'</p>
<p>Bransome considered, merely to explode in exasperation. 'How can
I fight? She carries twice my guns, and, if it comes to boarding,
her men outnumber mine by ten to one or more.'</p>
<p>'You will run, then?'</p>
<p>'How can I run? She has twice my canvas.' Bransome was grim.</p>
<p>In the waist some of the hands newly descended from aloft were
shading their eyes to survey the distant ship, but idly, without
suspicion yet of her identity.</p>
<p>De Bernis returned to the study of her through the telescope. He
spoke presently with the glass still to his eye. 'For all her
canvas, her sailing's laboured,' he pronounced. 'She's been
overlong at sea. Her bottom's foul. That's plain.' He lowered the
glass again. 'In your place, Captain, I should come a point or two
nearer to the wind. You'ld beat up against it a deal more nimbly
than will she in her present stale condition.'</p>
<p>The advice seemed to exasperate Bransome. 'But whither will that
lead me? The nearest landfall on that course is Porto Rico, and
that over two hundred miles away.'</p>
<p>'What matter? If this breeze holds, she'll never gain on you to
windward. She'll sail her worst close-hauled. You may even outsail
her. But if you do no more than keep the present distance, you are
safe.'</p>
<p>'That's if the breeze holds. And who's to warrant me the
breeze'll hold? It's an unnatural wind for this time o' year.' He
swore again in his frenzy of indecision. 'If I was to go about, and
run for Dominica again? It's none so far, and safest, after
all.'</p>
<p>'But it's down wind, and down wind, with all her canvas spread,
she'll overhaul you quickly for all her foulness.'</p>
<p>Bransome, however, was rendered obstinate by panic, and another
hope had come to vitiate his reasoning. 'Towards Dominica we're
likeliest to meet other shipping.' Without waiting for the
Frenchman's answer, he stepped to the poop-rail and bawled an order
to the quartermaster at the whipstaff to put down the helm.</p>
<p>And now it was de Bernis who departed from his calm. He rapped
out an oath in his vexation at this folly, and began an argument
which Bransome cut short with the reminder that it was he who
commanded aboard the <i>Centaur</i>. He would listen to advice; but
he would take no orders.</p>
<p>With a lurching plunge the <i>Centaur</i> luffed alee, then came
even on her keel and raced south before the wind.</p>
<p>The seamen in the waist, who had fallen agape at this abrupt
manoeuvre, were ordered aloft again to unfurl, not only the
topsails which they had just come down from furling, but also the
topgallants. Even as they sprang to the ratlines, in obedience, the
great black ship, now left astern on the larboard quarter, was seen
to alter her course and swing in pursuit, thus dispelling any
possible doubt that might have lingered on the score of her
intentions.</p>
<p>At once it became clear aboard the <i>Centaur</i> that they were
running before an enemy. Unaccountably, as il seemed, realization
spread through the ship. The hands came tumbling from the
forecastle in alarm, and stood about the hatch-coaming in the
waist, staring and muttering.</p>
<p>Bransome, now on the quarter-deck, whither de Bernis had
followed him, remained a long while with the telescope to his eye.
When at last he lowered it, he displayed a face of consternation,
from which most of the habitual ruddy colour had departed.</p>
<p>'You was right,' he confessed. 'She's overhauling us fast. We'll
do better, though, when the topsails are spread. But even so we'll
never make Dominica before that hell-hound is on our rudder. What's
to do, Mossoo? Shall I go about again?'</p>
<p>In the obvious urgency of his need, humbled by the realization
that if he had taken de Bernis' advice in the first instance, he
would now be in better case, he appealed again to that experienced
fighting seaman.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis took time to answer. He was plunged in
thought, a heavy frown between narrowed eyes. Bransome assumed him
to be making mental calculations, and the assumption seemed
confirmed when the Frenchman spoke.</p>
<p>'It is too late,' he said at last. 'Consider the time you would
lose, and the way, whilst she with the weather-gauge of you, would
need to veer but a point or two so as to steer athwart your hawse.
No, Captain. You are committed to your present course. It means now
that you must not only run, but fight.'</p>
<p>'God of Heaven! In what case am I to fight? To fight such a ship
as that?'</p>
<p>'I've seen victory snatched against longer odds.'</p>
<p>Bransome took heart from the other's grim calm. 'And, anyhow,'
said he 'with his back to the wall, a man has no choice but to
fight, no matter the odds. Have ye anything in mind, Mossoo?'</p>
<p>Thus plainly invited, Monsieur de Bernis became brisk and
authoritative.</p>
<p>'What hands do you muster?'</p>
<p>'Twenty-six all told, including quartermaster and bo'sun.
Leach'll have three hundred or more.'</p>
<p>'Therefore, he must be allowed no chance to board us. Give me
charge of your guns, and I'll show you how a main deck should be
fought, so long as you provide me with the chance to fight it.'</p>
<p>The Captain's gloom was further lightened. 'I'm in luck, at
least, in having you aboard, Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>'I hope it may prove as lucky for me in the end,' was the
sardonic answer.</p>
<p>He summoned Pierre, the half-caste, from the bulkhead below
against which he was leaning, awaiting his master's orders.</p>
<p>'Tiens, mon fils.' Monsieur de Bernis stripped off the sky-blue
coat he was wearing, the fine cambric shirt with its delicate
ruffles, his hat, his periwig, his shoes and stockings, delivering
all to Pierre with orders to bestow them in his cabin. Then, naked
above the waist, displaying a lean, muscular brown torso, and with
a scarf tied about his cropped head, he was ready to take the
command of the gun-deck which Bransome so very gladly made over to
him.</p>
<p>By this time the crew was fully aware of what was coming. The
steadiness of the men, displayed when Sproat, the bo'sun, piped
them to their quarters, was at least encouraging.</p>
<p>Eight of them, with Purvey, the master-gunner, were told off to
compose a gun-crew. Captain Bransome addressed them briefly. He
informed them that Monsieur de Bernis would take command on the
gun-deck, and that it was upon the gun-deck that this fight would
be fought, so that the safety of all was in their hands.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, now sharply authoritative, ordered them at
once below to clear the gun-tackles, to load and run out the guns.
Before following, he had a last word with the Captain. Standing by
the ornately carved rail of the quarter-deck, at the head of the
companion, he spoke incisively.</p>
<p>'You've placed the responsibility on us. I will do my part. You
may depend on that. But it rests with you to give me the
opportunity of doing it. Here timorousness, caution, will not
serve. The odds are heavily against us in this gamble. That we must
accept. We stake all--your ship, our lives--upon a lucky shot or
two between wind and water. Handle your ship so as to give me every
chance of it you can. You will have to take great risks. But take
them boldly. Audacity, then, Captain! All the audacity you can
command.'</p>
<p>Bransome nodded. His face was set, his air resolute. 'Aye, aye,'
he answered.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis' bold dark eyes pondered him a moment, and
approved him. A glance aloft, where every stitch of canvas now
wooed the breeze, a glance astern, over the larboard quarter where
the pursuing ship came ploughing after them, and de Bernis went
down the companion and crossed the waist, to lower himself through
an open scuttle to the deck below.</p>
<p>He dropped from the brilliant blaze of a cloudless day into a
gloom that was shot at regular intervals by narrow wedges of
sunlight from the larboard gunports.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Purvey, the guns were being run out and
made fast.</p>
<p>Stooping almost double in that confined space, with the reek of
spun yarn in his nostrils, de Bernis busied himself in taking stock
of the material with which he was to endeavour to command the
fortunes of the day.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>Chapter 5. Board and Board</h2>
<p>In the great cabin, Miss Priscilla and Major Sands broke their
fast, happily ignorant of what was coming. They marvelled a little
at the absence of the Captain, and they marvelled a little more at
the absence of their fellow passenger. But rendered sharp-set by
the sea air, and having waited a reasonable time to satisfy the
demands of courtesy, they yielded to Sam's soft invitation to
table, and with the Negro to wait upon them fell to with an
appetite.</p>
<p>They saw the soft-footed Pierre enter and pass into his master's
cabin, bearing a bundle. To the question Miss Priscilla addressed
to him, he answered after his usual laconic fashion that Monsieur
de Bernis was on deck and would breakfast there. He collected from
Sam some food and wine, and went off, to bear it to his master on
the gun-deck.</p>
<p>They thought it odd, but lacked curiosity to investigate.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Miss Priscilla went to sit on the cushioned
stern-locker under the open ports. Monsieur de Bernis' guitar still
lay there, where last night he had left it. She took it up, and ran
inexpert fingers carelessly across the strings, producing a jangle
of sound. She swung sideways upon the locker, and turned her gaze
seaward.</p>
<p>'A ship!' she cried, in pleased excitement, and by the cry
brought Major Sands to stand beside her and to stare with her at
the great black ship driving forward in their wake.</p>
<p>The Major commented upon the beauty of the vessel with the sun
aslant across her yards, lending a cloud effect to the billowing
canvas under which she moved; and for some time they remained
there, watching her, little suspecting the doom with which her
black flanks were pregnant.</p>
<p>Neither of them observed the altered course of the
<i>Centaur</i>, obvious though it was rendered by the position of
the sun. Nor at first did they give heed to the sounds of unusual
bustle that beat upon the deck overhead, the patter of feet, the
dragging of tackles, or again to the noisier movements in the
wardroom immediately underneath them, where the two brass culverins
that acted as stern-. chasers were being run out under the orders
of Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>Down there in the sweltering gloom, where men moved bowed like
apes for lack of head room, the Frenchman had been briskly at
work.</p>
<p>The ten guns with which he was to challenge the <i>Black
Swan's</i> forty, waited, their leaden aprons removed, their
touch-holes primed, all ready to be touched off.</p>
<p>De Bernis had laid them himself, approximately, so as to fire
high and sweep the shrouds of the pursuer. The broad target of her
sails offered him an infinitely better chance of crippling her than
he could hope to achieve by a shot aimed at her hull of which so
little would he presented to him. If he could thus injure her
sailing power, it would afterwards be theirs to elect whether to be
content to escape, or whether to stay to tackle her with the
advantage of unimpaired mobility.</p>
<p>From the wardroom ports astern, crouching beside one of the
brass stern-chasers which had moved his scorn, Monsieur de Bernis
watched the pirate racing after them and rapidly lessening the gap
between. Thus an hour passed, counting from the moment when the
<i>Centaur</i> had gone about. The <i>Black Swan</i> was
overhauling its prey even more swiftly than Monsieur de Bernis had
reckoned possible. Very soon now she was less than half a mile
astern, and Monsieur de Bernis judged that they were within
range.</p>
<p>He sent the wardroom gunner forward, to warn Purvey to stand
ready, and waited in growing impatience for Bransome to put up his
helm. But moments passed, and still the <i>Centaur</i> held to her
course, as if Bransome had no thought but to continue running.</p>
<p>Then from below the pirate's beak-head came a white bulge of
smoke, followed half a heart-beat later by the boom of a gun. A
shower of spray was flung up by a round shot, taking the water
fifty yards astern of the <i>Centaur</i>.</p>
<p>To de Bernis this was like a call to action, and so he judged
that it must be to Bransome. Quitting his observation post, he sped
forward to the gun-deck, where the matches glowed in the gloom, as
the gunners blew upon them. And there he waited for the <i>Black
Swan</i> to come into view of the larboard gunports.</p>
<p>In the cabin above, that single shot had disturbed the
complacency of the watchers on the stern-locker. They stared
blankly at each other in their uneasy surprise, the soldier
vehemently desiring his vitals to be stabbed. Then Miss Priscilla
sprang to her feet, and together they went on deck to seek an
explanation.</p>
<p>They were allowed, however, to go no farther than the waist,
where they were met by the grim faces of the mustered seamen. They
needed no other confirmation of their fears that here all was not
well. They received it, nevertheless, in the order to return at
once below, roared at them by the Captain from the
quarter-deck.</p>
<p>The Major's face empurpled. He spoke between remonstrance and
indignation. 'Captain! Captain!' And then he added the question:
'What is happening here?'</p>
<p>'Hell is happening!' he was fiercely informed. 'Take the lady
out of it. Get below decks, where she'll be under cover.'</p>
<p>The Major threw a chest, and advanced a step on legs that were
stiff with dignity. 'I demand to know...' he began. And there the
thunder of another gun interrupted him. This time the spray from
the shot rattled against the timbers of their larboard quarter.</p>
<p>'Will you stay until a falling spar or worse strikes you across
your foolish head? D'ye need to be told that were in action? Get
the lady under cover, man.'</p>
<p>Priscilla tugged at the Major's red sleeve. She was very white,
undoubtedly afraid. Yet all that she said to him was: 'Come, Bart.
We embarrass them. Take me back.'</p>
<p>Despite simmering resentment of the tone the Captain had taken
with him, he obeyed her without further argument. The suddenness of
this troubling of their serenity bewildered him. Also, although
Major Sands was brave enough ashore, he experienced here a daunting
clutch at his heart from his sense of helplessness on an element
that was foreign to him and in a form of warfare of which knew
nothing. Nor did the presence of Miss Priscilla help to encourage
him. The sense of responsibility for her safety increased his
discomfort. Before he had reconducted her, a seaman standing by had
muttered to him that they were being chased by that hell's bastard
Tom Leach.</p>
<p>Back in the great cabin, staring once more from her stern-ports
at the oncoming enemy, the Major dissembled his dismay with the
laudable aim of reassuring Miss Priscilla. He strove to quiet her
alarm with assurances in which he, himself, had no faith.</p>
<p>And at the same time, on the quarter-deck, de Bernis, who in
furious impatience had come up from below, was demanding to know
what Bransome might be waiting for, and peremptorily ordering him
to reef his topsails and bring the <i>Centaur</i> up to the wind so
that her guns might come into action.</p>
<p>'You're surely mad,' the Captain answered him. 'She'll be upon
us before we can get under way again.'</p>
<p>'That's because ye've delayed overlong already. Ye've increased
the risk, That's all. But we must take it. We stake all now upon my
chance to cripple her sailing power. Come, man! There's no more
time to lose. Never mind reeling. Put up your helm, and leave the
rest to me.'</p>
<p>Between an instinctive reluctance to a manoeuvre that was a pure
gambler's throw and resentment aroused by the Frenchman's hectoring
tone, Captain Bransome was perversely indignant.</p>
<p>'Get off my quarter-deck!' he roared. 'Do you command this ship,
sir, or do I?'</p>
<p>De Bernis clutched the Captain's arm and pointed astern. 'Look,
man! Look!'</p>
<p>The pirate was lowering and raising her fore topsail. It was the
signal to heave to. Instantly de Bernis' quick mind had seen what
advantage might he taken of it.</p>
<p>'It's your chance, man! Heaven-sent! You've but to pretend to
comply. She'll be off her guard.' He flung an arm upwards to point
to the Union flag aloft. 'Strike your colours, and heave to across
her bows. Then leave it to me to put a whole broadside athwart her
hawse.'</p>
<p>The Captain, however, shared none of the Frenchman's eager
hopes. He seemed only alarmed by a proposal so redolent of
buccaneering treachery.</p>
<p>'By God's death!' he answered. 'She'll sink us in reply.'</p>
<p>'If I shear away her shrouds, she'll be in no case to bring her
guns to bear.'</p>
<p>'And if ye don't?'</p>
<p>'Things will be not a whit worse than they already are.'</p>
<p>Under the Frenchman's dark, compelling eyes the Captain's
opposition visibly weakened. He saw that this was their last
desperate chance. That there was no longer any choice. As if
reading his mind, de Bernis urged him once again.</p>
<p>'Heave to, Captain. Give the word.'</p>
<p>'Aye, aye. It's all that's left to do, I suppose.'</p>
<p>'To it, then!' De Bernis left him, leapt down to the waist, and
vanished once more through the scuttle to the deck below.</p>
<p>Even as he disappeared, Tom Leach, grown impatient, sent a
charge of langrel from his fore-chasers through the shrouds of the
<i>Centaur</i>, so as to quicken her master's compliance with his
signals. In a tangle of cordage, a couple of spars came crashing to
the deck.</p>
<p>Below, de Bernis heard the thuds and conjectured what had
happened. He was not at all dismayed. The event, he concluded, must
put an end to any lingering hesitation of Captain Bransome. He
ordered his gunners to stand ready. Himself he snatched from one of
them a linstock, and, crouching by the middle one of the five
larboard guns, waited for the <i>Centaur</i> to go about.</p>
<p>Whilst he waited thus, he heard again the boom of cannon, and
felt the vessel shudder under the heavy impact of a hit astern.
Then he was flung violently against a bulkhead as the
<i>Centaur</i> wildly yawed.</p>
<p>He recovered his balance, and for a moment his hopes ran high.
She was heaving to. He perceived that she was veering. He saw the
face of the waters shifting below. But he waited in vain for a
sight of the pursuing ship. Only an empty sea confronted him. And
at last he reached the exasperating conclusion that, in heaving to,
Bransome had put his helm to starboard. Cursing him for a lubberly
fool, de Bernis sped aft to the wardroom to verify his suspicion.
Here he found a dismayed explanation of what was happening. That
hit, of which he had felt the impact, had, by a monstrous chance,
smashed the head of the <i>Centaur's</i> rudder, throwing her
steering-tackles out of action. As if it did not suffice a
malignant Fate that with damaged shrouds she should rapidly be
losing way, now, with the helm out of control, she was left to yaw
this way and that, as the wind took her.</p>
<p>Through the stern-ports the <i>Black Swan</i> was now visible to
de Bernis, bearing down upon them at an alarming rate, and this,
although she was already shortening sail, preparatory to
boarding.</p>
<p>Bransome had waited too long to make the only throw that it was
theirs to make. When at last he was willing to obey Monsieur de
Bernis' persuasions, he suffered the common fate of him who will
not when he may. A lucky shot from one of the pirate's powerful
fore-chasers had rendered him helpless.</p>
<p>The wardroom gunner, a fair-haired, vigorous lad, returned a
scared face upon Monsieur de Bernis when he came up to view the
damage.</p>
<p>'We're beat, sir. They have us surely now.'</p>
<p>For a moment de Bernis stooped there, considering the tall ship
that was scarcely five hundred yards astern. His lean, lined,
swarthy face was set; his dark eyes steady and impassive. He went
down on one knee beside one of the brass culverins, and laid it
again. He laid it carefully, calm and unhurried, realizing that
this slenderest of chances was the last one of which the
<i>Centaur</i> still disposed. At this short range it was possible
that the little brass cannon, which earlier had aroused his scorn,
might be effective.</p>
<p>Rising, he took the smouldering match from the gunner's hand,
blew upon it, touched off the gun, and stepped nimbly aside to
avoid the recoil, But even as the gun went off, the <i>Centaur</i>
yielding to a puff of wind, yawed again, swinging her stern a point
or two alee. The <i>Centaur</i> fired her first and last shot into
the void.</p>
<p>De Bernis looked at the young gunner, squatting there on his
naked heels, and laughed in grim bitterness.</p>
<p>'C'est fini, mon gars. All is over. Next we shall have the
grappling-hooks aboard, and then...' He shrugged, and tossed the
useless match through the port.</p>
<p>White-faced, the lad swore through his strong young teeth. He
raved a little about Tom Leach, desiring a red-hot hell for
him.</p>
<p>'It looks as if it would be our turn first,' sighed de Bernis.
Then he, too, broke out passionately for a moment. 'Ah! Sang de
Dieu! What was needed here was a fighting seaman on the poop; not a
lubberly merchant master. I should have stayed with him, and made
him handle her as she should have been handled. Then any fool might
have served these guns. But what use to talk now?'</p>
<p>He stood squarely in the port, in the space which the gun's
recoil had left, watching the pirate's advance. She had further
shortened sail, and she was creeping forward slowly now, but
nonetheless surely, upon a prey no longer able to escape her. She
held her fire, and waited to board, so as to do no further
damage.</p>
<p>From where he stood, de Bernis could see the men on her bowsprit
busy with the gaskets of her spritsail, and two others standing in
the fore-chains holding the grapnels ready.</p>
<p>The gunner heard him muttering between his teeth. Then he
turned, suddenly brisk.</p>
<p>'Up above with you, my lad, and bid the others on the gun-deck
up with you. There's no more to be done down here.'</p>
<p>As for Monsieur de Bernis, himself, he took a short cut. He
crawled out through the square port, steadying himself precariously
against one of the stanchions of the shallow gallery over the
counter.</p>
<p>Then, facing inwards, his bare feel upon the sill, he drew
himself upright, and raised his right arm, so as to clutch one of
the posts, which was within easy reach. Then, with the strength and
agility of an ape, he swung clear and hoisted himself until he
could bring his left hand to clutch the gallery rail. He heaved
again nimbly, and his right hand followed. Another heave, and his
elbow was on a level with the rail. He threw a leg over it, and so
disappeared from the view of the amazed young gunner below.</p>
<p>To Miss Priscilla and the Major came then the most terrifying of
all their experiences of that dreadful morning, when they beheld
this half-naked figure clambering through the stern-windows of the
coach.</p>
<p>The Major, who had meanwhile armed himself for eventualities,
laid a hand to his sword, and would have drawn it had not the
Frenchman's speech made it known to them that it was indeed he,
taking this shortest way to reach his cabin. His aspect was
terrifying, with face and hands and naked torso befouled by sweat
and powder. His voice came harsh with scorn.</p>
<p>'The fight is fought. The lubberly Bransome was well advised to
think of turning farmer. He should have thought of it before.
Better for him, and better for those who sail with him. The fool
never gave me a chance to use the guns. In God's name, why do such
men go to sea? It's as if I took holy orders. Leach is saving
gunpowder because he wants the ship. That's plain. He's going to
board.'</p>
<p>From what he had told them, they were left to surmise the part
which the momentarily forgotten Frenchman had played in the
action.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla, assuming that her only resource now lay in the
help of Heaven, fell on her knees to pray. The Major looked on,
helplessly, foolishly fierce.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, however, displayed in this desperate pass
neither fear nor helplessness.</p>
<p>'Ah, but courage, mademoiselle. Compose yourself. I am here. It
may be that you are in no danger. It may be. I can do things
sometimes. You shall see. Have faith in me. A little faith.'</p>
<p>He flung away on that, into his own cabin, calling for Pierre,
who was there, awaiting him.</p>
<p>Priscilla rose from her knees to question the Major.</p>
<p>In his heart Major Sands could not suppose that the Frenchman
was anything but vaingloriously boastful. A theatrical fellow who
would attitudinize in the very face of death. But he made gallant
shift to stifle that conviction, so as to comfort her distress.</p>
<p>'I do not know what he can do. Stab me, I don't. But he seems
confident. A resourceful fellow, I should judge. Remember, too,
that he has been a buccaneer, and knows their ways. Dog don't eat
dog, they say.'</p>
<p>Thus, vaguely, he mumbled on, though in his heart there was no
hope. From what they had heard as lately as last night of the ways
of Tom Leach, he could only assume that death would be his portion,
and only pray that it might be a swift one. Fearful as the prospect
might be, yet a deeper agony clawed him on behalf of Priscilla
Harradine. Beholding her, so sweet and lovely in her distress, he
feared for her the worse fate of being allowed to live, the prey of
such a beast as Leach. It even crossed his agonized mind to kill
her where she stood, considering this, in the pass to which things
were come, the highest and noblest proof he could give of his love
and reverence. But the thought took no root in his will. Inert he
remained standing by the locker on which she sat, conscious for
once of his own utter futility, and offering her cheerlessly vague
words of comfort.</p>
<p>Thus, until the sunlight was eclipsed for them by the bulk of
the great black ship. She came, her bulwarks lined with men,
gliding up astern on their larboard quarter, and so cast her
chilling, sinister shadow athwart the stern-ports where Miss
Priscilla sat. Across the short gap of water came a trumpet call
from the pirate's deck. They heard, too, the roll of drums, and
presently there was a volley of musketry.</p>
<p>It brought Miss Priscilla quivering to her feet, and urged the
Major to set a protecting arm about her slimness.</p>
<p>And then from his cabin Monsieur de Bernis re-emerged at last
followed by his servant. He came now, not merely cleansed of his
grime, but restored to his normal courtly habit. He had resumed his
curled black periwig, his fine ruffled shirt, and his doublet of
violet taffetas with its deep cuffs reversed in black and the
buttonholes richly laced with silver. In addition, he was booted in
fine black Cordovan leather, and he had armed himself, not only
with a long rapier, but with a pair of pistols, slung before him,
after the fashion of the buccaneers, in the ends of a stole, which,
like his baldrick, was of purple leather stiff with silver
bullion.</p>
<p>They stared at him in wonder. That he should have been at such
pains with his toilet at such a time was surprising enough. But the
ease of his bearing was more surprising still.</p>
<p>He smiled upon their wide-eyed wonder. He explained himself.
'Captain Leach is a great man. The last of the great buccaneers. He
is to be received with ceremony.'</p>
<p>He was moving forward towards them when the deck under their
feet shuddered to a thudding, crashing impact, followed by rending
of timbers, the ringing-clank of grapnels, the snapping of spars,
and the long, harsh rattle of volley upon volley of musketry.</p>
<p>Flung forward, Monsieur de Bernis clutched the table to steady
himself. The Major dropped to his knees, whilst Miss Priscilla
hurtling across the cabin, found refuge in the Frenchman's
arms.</p>
<p>'Save me!' she gasped. 'Save me!'</p>
<p>Holding her, the man's tight lips under the little black
moustache softened into a smile. One of his long shapely hands
stroked the golden head that lay against his breast, and it may be
that the firm calm touch of him soothed her more than his actual
words.</p>
<p>'I hope to do so. It may well be possible.'</p>
<p>Deeply resentful of a situation which gave the Frenchman license
for the intimacy of his attitude, the Major, gathering himself up,
glared at him.</p>
<p>'Why, what can you do?' he growled ungraciously.</p>
<p>'We are going to see. Perhaps much. Perhaps little. But to do
much, it is necessary that you obey me.' His manner became stern.
'Contradict nothing that I say, whatever it may be, and whatever
you may think. Remember that, if you please, or you may destroy us
all.'</p>
<p>Overhead a thunder of feet went rolling across the deck, to
inform them that the pirates were aboard the <i>Centaur</i>. A
babel of shouts and screams, mingled with a din of pistol shots and
musketry fire, and, under all, the deeper diapason of the
inarticulate muttering of men in conflict made up the hideous,
terrifying sound of battle joined. Something dark and bulky flashed
downwards past the stern-ports. They realized that it was the body
of a man flung overboard from the poop. Another, and yet another,
followed.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla, in a fresh access of fear, clung yet more
closely to Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>'It will not last,' he said, his voice quiet. 'Leach has three
hundred men at least; the <i>Centaur</i> little more than a
score.'</p>
<p>His straining ears caught an approaching sound, and he added on
a firmer note: 'You will obey me? Implicitly? Give me your word. It
is important.'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes. Whatever you may say.'</p>
<p>'And you, Major Sands?'</p>
<p>Gloomily the Major gave the demanded promise. He had scarcely
uttered it when along the gangway from the waist came the padding
of a score of naked feet and a raucous mutter of voices quickly
growing louder and nearer.</p>
<p>Overhead the sounds, if they had not diminished in volume, had
changed in character, at least to the attentive, expert ears of
Monsieur de Bernis. There were still the stamping and the shouting.
But they were mixed now with sounds of horrible, obscene laughter,
and a firing of muskets which de Bernis knew to be no more than
wanton sporting, the triumphant joy-fire of the buccaneers.</p>
<p>The brief fight was over. The invaders had swept like a tidal
wave across the decks of the <i>Centaur</i> cutting down all
resistance.</p>
<p>The padding feet and muttering voices in the gangway, drowning
now more distant sounds, announced to him the approach of those who
came below to appraise the value of their capture, and to deal with
any who might still be found alive under decks.</p>
<p>The cabin door was flung violently inwards upon its hinges to
crash against a bulkhead. Through the dark gap swarmed a little mob
of half-naked men, most of them with gaudily swathed heads, their
sunburned, bearded faces alight with evil exultation. They came
with weapons in their hands and foulness on their lips.</p>
<p>Beholding the four tenants of the cabin--for Pierre stood in the
background, simulating impassivity, despite a greyness
overspreading his deep tan--the ruffians checked a moment. Then one
of them, at sight of the girl, loosed a hideous view-holloa, and on
that they were surging forward again, when Monsieur de Bernis, calm
to the point of seeming contemptuous, put himself in their way.</p>
<p>His hands were on the silver-mounted butts of the pistols in his
stole; but the fact that he did not trouble to draw them lent him
an added authority.</p>
<p>'Hold! I'll burn the brains of the first man who advances
farther. I am de Bernis. Fetch your Captain Leach to me.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>Chapter 6. The Partnership</h2>
<p>Whether because they knew the name of this man who once had
sailed with Morgan, a name which he announced in a tone to imply
its high significance, or whether because his very manner; so cool
and assured, had an intimidating effect upon them, those evil
ruffians stood arrested, at gaze, their leader balancing a
bloodstained machete in his powerful hand. Thus, whilst a man might
have counted ten. Then, as they were beginning to mutter lewdly
decked demands that this man who stood so boldly before them should
explain himself, a fellow of middle height, whose body and
movements held something of the lithe strength of the panther, came
thrusting through them to the front. It was Tom Leach.</p>
<p>He was breeched in red, and his blood-smeared shirt hung open
from neck to waist, the sleeves rolled high to display the powerful
muscles of his long hairy arms. Black curls clustered about a low,
animal brow; his nose, a thin, cruel beak, was set close between a
pair of quick-moving eyes that were almost black. Instead of the
cutlass or machete more generally favoured on boarding occasions by
such men, Leach was armed with a rapier, a weapon with which to his
abiding pride he was accounted of a deadly skill.</p>
<p>'What in hell's here?' he cried, as he advanced.</p>
<p>But when he stood clear and slightly ahead of that press of
scoundrels, he checked as they had done before the elegant,
commanding figure, so straight and tall that was confronting him.
In his coppery face the little eyes flashed as if in surprise, and
then narrowed like a cat's. He caught his breath for an
ejaculation.</p>
<p>'May I be sunk into everlasting hell if it isna Topgallant
Charley!' And he added a foul oath in token of his profound
amazement.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis took a step forward. He removed a hand from a
pistol-butt, and proffered it.</p>
<p>'Well met, my friend. You were always to be found where you were
wanted. But never more opportune than now. You come to save me
trouble. You arrive just as I am on my way to seek you. On my way
to Guadeloupe, for a ship and men to sail to find you. And behold,
Tom! You have the complacency to drop from the skies to our deck.
C'est charmant!'</p>
<p>With eyes still narrowed, his attitude slightly crouching, as if
his muscles were gathered for a spring, the ruffian disregarded the
proffered hand.</p>
<p>'Will ye cozen me, de Bernis? Thee was always a sly rogue, thee
was. But not sly enough for Tom Leach.'</p>
<p>Born on the banks of the Lune, which he had quitted so as to
follow a calling on the seas, which he had originally intended
should be honest, his speech retained the broad burr of the north
country, just as his nature retained its dour mistrustfulness. 'I
last heeard tell o' ye wi' Morgan. Morgan's right-hand man ye was
when ye quit th' Brotherhood o' th' Coast, along o' that
treacherous turncoat.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis displayed the mild amusement he might bestow
upon absurdity. 'Of course, I was given to choose,' he said with
irony. 'A fine choice: between that and execution dock. As long as
I was in Morgan's hands, I had to dance to the tune he piped. But
you knew nothing of de Bernis if you supposed his heart was in the
jig. I took my first chance to slip away and join you. And behold
me.'</p>
<p>'To join me? To join me, d'ye say? I never knew as ye loved
me.'</p>
<p>'We always love those we need. And, faith, I need you. And I
don't come empty-handed. You're the only leader left with men
enough and spirit enough for the enterprise I'm set on. I bring you
fortune, Tom. Fortune such as ye may have met in dreams, but never
waking. Something better than poor merchantmen like this, with
paltry cargoes of hides and logwood, over which the French traders
at Guadeloupe or Sainte Croix will impudently swindle you.'</p>
<p>Leach advanced a step, holding his rapier, like a whip, in his
two hands at the end of his lowered arms. 'What's th'
enterprise?'</p>
<p>'A plate fleet, Tom. No less. To sail in a month from now.'</p>
<p>There was the faintest kindling of interest tempering the
mistrust in those watchful little eyes. 'Sailing whence?'</p>
<p>The Frenchman laughed, and shook his head. 'Nay, now. We'll leave
that till later.'</p>
<p>Leach understood. But his lips tightened. 'I'll need to know
more o' this or ever I says aught to it.'</p>
<p>'Of course you shall know more. Enough to make you
sharp-set.'</p>
<p>The pirate's view of Miss Priscilla, partly screened hitherto by
the bulk of Major Sands, happened to be left clear at this moment
by a movement of the Major's. His eyes quickened evilly.</p>
<p>'Who be these? Who be th' doxy?' He would have advanced, but de
Bernis stood resolutely in his way.</p>
<p>'My wife and her brother. I was taking them to Guadeloupe, to
await there my return.'</p>
<p>The foolish Major cleared his throat to repudiate a relationship
which offended him. But Priscilla, intuitively guessing the mad
intention, warned him against it by a violent clutch upon his
arm.</p>
<p>'Your wife?' The pirate's manner was a trifle daunted. His
glance turned sour. 'I never heard tell you was married.'</p>
<p>'It happened lately. In Jamaica.' Airily de Bernis dismissed the
matter. 'It's not important, Tom. We have this other business to
settle now that we are met, so oddly opportune.'</p>
<p>Tom Leach considered him. 'It'll need a deal to make me believe
you're honest, de Bernis. And if I find ye're not...'</p>
<p>De Bernis interrupted him. 'Suspicion makes you stupid, Tom. It
was always the flaw in your nature. What manner of fool must I be
not to be honest with you when I'm in your hands?'</p>
<p>Still considering him, Leach stroked his thin nose. 'Maybe.
Maybe. But, by God, Charley, if thee looks to get spry wi' me,
thee'll end by wishing thee'ld ne'er been born. D'ye call to mind
Jack Clavering? He was just such another dawcock as thee, Charles,
and thought he could make a fool o' Tom Leach. Ye may ha' heard
tell how I plucked his feathers, until the poor bastard screamed to
be let die. Thee's clever, Charley. Morgan always reckoned thee was
clever. Artful as Old Nick hisself. But I's artful, too. Thee'd
best remember it.'</p>
<p>'Ye're wasting breath,' said de Bernis contemptuously.</p>
<p>'Maybe. An' I've ways o' wasting other men's, too.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his resolve was taken, as he now showed. Abruptly
he turned upon the ruffians waiting like hounds in leash behind
him.</p>
<p>'Away wi' y' all. All but you, Wogan. And tell Mike to go
through th' cargo so as he'll report to me when I come up.'</p>
<p>They went out noisily. Leach watched them depart, then he
advanced to the table, pulled out a chair and sat down, laying his
slim sword on the board before him. 'Now, Charley. We'll hear more
o' this plate fleet o' yours.' Yet as he spoke it was not at de
Bernis that he looked, but at Miss Priscilla, over by the
stern-locker with the Major; and his glance was neither nice nor
reassuring.</p>
<p>Behind him stood Wogan, the buccaneer with the machete, who had
led the invasion of the cabin: a tall, powerful, flat-featured
scoundrel, black-bearded, with greasy black curls fringing the red
scarf about his head and the bluest of eyes under thick black
brows. He wore a gaping red shirt and loose breeches of rawhide, in
the belt of which he carried a brace of pistols.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, entirely at his ease, moving with the
authority of a man in his own house, went to open the door of one
of the starboard cabins.</p>
<p>'Come, Priscilla,' he said quietly. 'And you, too, Bart.'</p>
<p>Instantly, and in relief, she moved to obey him.</p>
<p>Tom Leach stared annoyance and grumbled. 'What's this? Who says
they shouldn't stay here?'</p>
<p>'By your leave, Captain,' was all that de Bernis answered him,
with a chill dignity that seemed to exclude all argument. He held
the door for his supposed wife and brother-in-law; and he closed it
after they had passed out.</p>
<p>'Eh, by God!' said Leach, with an unpleasant little laugh.
'Seems you give yourself airs, like. Act as if thee was master
here. Give orders, eh?'</p>
<p>'Only where my wife is concerned,' said the Frenchman quietly.
He pulled a chair to the table, and paused by it to address his
waiting servant. 'The rum, Pierre.'</p>
<p>The buccaneer's malevolent, suspicious eyes followed the
loose-limbed half-caste as he moved to the carved buffet set
against the forward bulkhead.</p>
<p>'Be you another member o' thee family?' His sneering tone seemed
to carry a menace.</p>
<p>De Bernis did not appear to observe it. 'He is my servant.' He
sat down so as to face the buccaneer across the table. His air as
he talked now was entirely genial, the air of a man chatting with
friends and associates.</p>
<p>'We're in luck, Tom. That's plain. Otherwise you and I wouldn't
be sitting here now in the cabin of the <i>Centaur</i>. If she had
been handled by a man with fighting experience, if I, now, had been
handling her today, ye'ld never have come board and board with
her.'</p>
<p>'Would I not? Clever, isn't he, Wogan? Ye reckons ye can fight a
ship better than me, eh? Thee's o'ermodest, Charley.'</p>
<p>De Bernis shook his head. 'I should never have stayed to fight.
I'ld have shown you a dwindling counter, my lad. I'ld have beaten
up wind; and foul and barnacled as you are, I'ld easily have
outsailed you if it came to tacking. Ye've been overlong at sea,
Tom. But it was always your way to take no risks except those you
shouldn't take.'</p>
<p>Captain Leach opened wide now his wicked little eyes in genuine
admiration.</p>
<p>'Thee's got good eyesight, by God, to ha' seen I'm
barnacled.'</p>
<p>Pierre set before them a tray bearing a jack of rum, a jar of
tobacco, pipes, a tinder-box, and three drinking-cans. Then he fell
back to the buffet again, and remained there in attendance.</p>
<p>They poured for themselves in turn, and Wogan came to sit at the
table's end, and filled himself a pipe of fine leaf. De Bernis did
the same. But Tom Leach waved the jar disdainfully away when it was
proffered to him.</p>
<p>'What's this business o' a plate fleet? Come, now. Let's have
it.'</p>
<p>'Faith, it's soon told. Three Spanish ships due to sail for
Cadiz in a month's time: a galleon of thirty guns as the
treasure-ship, with two twenty-gun frigates to escort her. The
treasure is as big as any that's ever been ventured in one bottom.
Gold and silver worth over five hundred thousand pieces of eight,
and bushels of pearls from the Rio de la Hacha, besides other
baubles.'</p>
<p>Wogan stood arrested in the act of applying to his pipe the
flame he had kindled. Both he and Leach stared with fallen jaws and
faces almost awestricken at the mention of a treasure so fabulous.
If this were true, there would be enough in their shares as Captain
and mate to make them rich for life. At the end of a gaping pause,
Leach vented incredulity in oaths. Then flatly he added:</p>
<p>'I's not believing it. Sink me into hell if I can.'</p>
<p>'Nor I, neither, on my soul,' said Wogan.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis smiled his quiet scorn of them. 'I said it
was something ye may have met in dreams, but never waking. But it's
true, for all that. Perhaps you'll understand, now, why I should
have been on my way to Guadeloupe to find a ship in which to seek
you, so that you might bear a hand in this; and also why I should
account it a bounty of Providence that we're met as we are, with
the second ship we'll need for the venture ready found for us,
here, under our feet.'</p>
<p>It was a question-begging argument, in which two equally
unbelievable statements were urged each in support of the other.
Yet to the buccaneers, dazzled by the vastness of the prize and the
cupidity it aroused in them, each of the Frenchman's incredible
allegations served to lessen the incredibility of the other.</p>
<p>Tom Leach pulled his chair closer to the table, and set his bare
elbows on it. 'Let us know more o' this. How did ye come to learn
of it?'</p>
<p>'By one of those chances--of which our meeting is another--sent
by the gods to those they favour.' And he told his tale: a smooth,
well-knit, convincing story.</p>
<p>A month ago he had been cruising off the Caymans with Morgan.
Morgan was looking for Tom Leach at the time, and de Bernis was in
command of one of two frigates that accompanied Sir Henry's
flagship. At daybreak one morning, after a stormy night, some five
or six leagues south of the Grand Cayman, they came upon a sloop so
battered by the gale that her timbers had parted and she was
foundering. They were no more than in time to take off her crew The
men they rescued proved to be Spaniards. One of them was a
gentleman of some consequence, a Spanish officer named Ojeda, who
was in a frenzy to get to Hispaniola, whither the sloop had been
steering when the gale caught her and blew her out of her course.
This Spaniard's urgency was rendered the more desperate because he
had been seriously injured the night before. A falling yardarm had
pinned him to the deck. He swore that his back was broken. Anyway,
he was certainly in great bodily pain and in almost equal pain of
soul, for fear that he might not live to reach San Domingo and the
Spanish Admiral there, for whom he had a message of the first
importance.</p>
<p>'You'll be supposing,' said de Bernis, 'as I supposed, that the
message must be fully as important as he announced it, to be giving
so much preoccupation to a man in his desperate case. You'll
understand that my curiosity was aroused. I offered to bear the
message for him if he would entrust it to me, or convey it in a
letter if he would write it. He repelled the offer with a terrified
vehemence which only went to increase my curiosity. But the
suggestion that he should write a letter remained working in his
mind. Later in the day, persuaded that his end was near, he sent
for me again, and begged me to fetch the master of the foundered
sloop and to supply him with writing materials. I did this readily
enough. I was not to guess that the cunning and scholarly don had
hit upon a device that should render the letter meaningless to rude
unlettered seamen, most of whom could not even read their own
mother-tongue. He dictated it in Latin. I suppose that he must have
spelled out each word to the master of the sloop, who must,
himself, have remained in ignorance of what he wrote. It was
crafty, and it must fully have succeeded but for that curiosity of
mine.</p>
<p>'That evening the don quietly died. He fell into his last sleep
with a mind completely at ease, since he was persuaded that his
death would leave no duty unfulfilled. A very gallant
gentleman.</p>
<p>'That night the master of the Spanish sloop met with an accident
that was never explained. He fell overboard. At least, so it was
supposed next morning, when he could not be found. As no one but
myself knew anything about the vital letter, his loss, whilst
regretted, created no great excitement. But the letter was not
lost. Fearing that some mischance might overtake him, I had taken
the precaution of removing it from the lining of one of his
sea-boots, where, for greater safety, he had stowed it.'</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the approving, crowing laughter of the two
buccaneers. The delicate humour in which he had veiled an obvious
deed of murder was of a kind they could savour fully. He smiled his
acknowledgements of their appreciative understanding, and pursued
his tale.</p>
<p>'It was then that I discovered the trick that the dead don had
played us. I am not by any means an unlettered man, and once my
knowledge of Latin was considerable. But at sea a man forgets these
things. Besides, as I now know, the Latin used by the don was very
pure and difficult--what scholars call classical. I could make
nothing of it beyond some Roman numerals, which at first I supposed
to be dates, and an odd word here and there. But back in Port Royal
a week later, I sought a French priest of my acquaintance, and from
him I had a translation of the document.'</p>
<p>He paused there and looked into those dark faces which his tale
had rendered quick with eager interest. 'That should satisfy you,'
he said, 'as to how the knowledge reached me. Once I possessed it,
I saw that the time had come to quit Morgan and the service of the
English Crown. But I should need assistance for what was to do, and
at once I thought of you, and of how together we might reap this
rich harvest. To old Morgan my tale was that I was hungering for
France and home after all these years of wandering. And Morgan,
suspecting nothing, let me go. I was sure that at Guadeloupe I
should still find a few French adventurers willing to join me, and
a ship that would serve to support you when I found you. And I also
thought it likely that I should get a hint of your whereabouts. I
knew, as Morgan knew, that you had been trading your prizes there
of late.'</p>
<p>He ceased, and refreshed himself with a sip of rum.</p>
<p>Leach stirred on his seat, and took his elbows from the table.
'Aye, aye,' he growled, more in impatience than agreement. 'And th'
information?'</p>
<p>'You have that already. A plate fleet, with the treasure I told
you, sails for Cadiz in a month's time, when the trade winds will
serve best. The letter giving the details, so as to impress the
Spanish Admiral at San Domingo with the need implicitly to obey the
request, desired him to hold two ships of war in readiness, further
to strengthen the escort for the ocean crossing to Spain. That is
all.'</p>
<p>'All, man? All, d'ye say? But where'll this plate fleet sail
from?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, in the act of taking up the tinder-box,
smiled as he answered: 'From somewhere between Campeche and
Trinidad.'</p>
<p>The pirate's brow grew dark. 'Why not say between the North Pole
and the South?' His tone was angry. 'D'ye mean ye don't know? If so
be, what good's rest o' thee knowledge?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis' smile became more bland. 'To be sure I know.
But that is my secret. That is what I bring to the
association.'</p>
<p>He struck flint and steel, kindled a match and applied it to his
pipe, ignoring the scowls of the buccaneers, who were stricken
speechless. 'One thing more,' he added presently. 'From what I know
of them, the three Spanish ships will scarcely carry more than a
total of two hundred and fifty men. With two such ships as we now
possess and the following you have, we should be more than a match
for them.'</p>
<p>''Tisn't that as bothers me. What I want to know, and at once,
is where this fleet is to be looked for: north, south, east, or
west.'</p>
<p>The Frenchman shook his head. 'Ye don't need to know that,
because I am here to lead you to the spot, as I will so soon as the
articles are signed between us.'</p>
<p>'Thee's sure we'll be signing articles.'</p>
<p>'If I were not, I must be sure that you're a fool, Tom. D'ye
dream ye'll ever have the chance again of such a fortune?'</p>
<p>'And d'ye dream I'll go hoodman-blind into a venture?'</p>
<p>'There's no hoodman-blind in this. You know all that's
necessary. If you refuse, if you haven't the stomach for it, put me
ashore at Guadeloupe. I don't doubt I'll...'</p>
<p>'Look'ee, Bernis, my stomach's high enough, as thee well knows.
And ye should know, too, that I've ways to make men talk. Ye'll not
be the first as I've woolded; not by a many. Or thee may have a
match between toes if thee prefers it.'</p>
<p>De Bernis looked down his nose at him, and spoke with languid
disdain.</p>
<p>'Why, you poor kestrel, if I were not a patient man, I'ld pistol
you for that.'</p>
<p>'What d'ye say?' The pirate put a hand to the sword that lay on
the table before him.</p>
<p>De Bernis paid no heed to the threatening movement. 'To suppose
that I am of the stuff that is to be woolded into talking! If you
want to lose your every chance of ever seeing a real of that
treasure, talk to me again of woolding. I may be in need of you,
but if the plate fleet tempts you at all, your need of me is far
more urgent, and, perhaps, not only to lead you to it. I've told
you I was on my way to Guadeloupe to find another ship for you. But
since you've seized the <i>Centaur</i>, we have all we now require.
That is, all but the man to command her. I am that man. You should
know that I can fight a ship with anyone. So there it is. Will you
take this chance of a fortune on which to quit? Or will you wait
until the Jamaica squadron hunts you from the seas, or until Morgan
sinks you, as he surely will if you wait long enough?' He paused,
to add:</p>
<p>'Now, Captain, shall we talk of terms, like sensible men?'</p>
<p>Wogan at least was conquered. He moistened his lips with his
tongue, and intervened. 'On me soul, Cap'n, Charley's none so
unreasonable when all's said. Isn't he doing just what you'ld be
after doing in his place?'</p>
<p>De Bernis sat back and pulled at his pipe, strengthened in the
perception that the cupidity he had awakened would make the mate of
the <i>Black Swan</i> an ally who would curb in his Captain
excesses which might result in the loss of this fabulous chance.
Already the Irishman's expostulation was not without its effect
upon Leach.</p>
<p>'What terms d'ye propose?' he asked in a surly voice.</p>
<p>'For myself a fifth share of the prize when we have it.'</p>
<p>'A fifth share!' Leach got to his feet in his indignation. He
loosed a bombardment of blasphemy at the Frenchman, then swung to
Wogan. 'Is this your reasonable man, Ned?'</p>
<p>'The treasure,' de Bernis blandly reminded him, 'is worth
perhaps a million pieces of eight. And it's not the sort of mangy
cargo ye have to trade in Guadeloupe for a tenth of its worth.'</p>
<p>They fell to wrangling after that like a couple of hucksters,
and they might have come to quarrelling but that Wogan, with his
mind on the main issue, was intent upon keeping the peace at all
costs. At long last, it was Leach who yielded, and this largely in
consequence of Wogan's pacificatory persuasions.</p>
<p>Pen, ink, and paper were fetched, and Pierre was sent on deck,
to summon any three men as representatives of the crew, to come and
settle with the leaders, and to sign on the men's behalf, the terms
of the articles, to be drawn in accordance with buccaneering
custom.</p>
<p>Leach and his fellows all departed together when it was done,
leaving de Bernis alone in the cabin to stay or follow as he
pleased.</p>
<p>The buccaneer Captain went out in a villainous mood, with the
sense of having been worsted in the deal, and recklessly he vented
his humour upon Wogan whom he largely blamed.</p>
<p>'Och, now, Captain, darling,' the mate mollified him, 'would ye
be growing hot about nothin' at all. If he'ld asked for a half
share, I'ld have promised it, so I would. For what's a promise,
now?'</p>
<p>Leach checked in the ship's waist, which was now a shambles
slippery with blood. For the horrors spread there about the main
hatch, he had no thought or care. He had long since grown callous
to the sight of slaughtered men. His mind was entirely on what
Wogan had just said.</p>
<p>He looked up questioningly into the tall Irishman's face. Wogan
looked down at him and grinned. 'When we've gutted the plate fleet
and the treasure's under hatches, sure it's another talk we'll be
having with Master Charley. Maybe he'll be more reasonable then.
And what odds if he's not? There's the doxy, too, Captain. A trim
little craft, so she is. I saw ye'd an eye for her, small blame to
ye.'</p>
<p>The Captain's close-set little eyes flashed evilly.</p>
<p>'The French,' said Wogan, 'have a proverb that all things come to
him who knows how to wait. It's knowing how to wait is the art of
it, Captain.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' said Captain Leach. 'I think I'll know how to wait. Seems
to me as if we'd captured more nor a cargo o' hides today.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>Chapter 7. Topgallant</h2>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis removed the pistol-bearing stole from about
his neck, lifted over his head the baldrick, to the carriages of
which his long rapier was attached, and delivered one and the other
to Pierre, with orders to bestow them in his cabin. They had been
assumed chiefly for decorative purposes, and they had served their
turn.</p>
<p>Next he went to open the door of the cabin into which he had
ushered his fellow voyagers, and invited them to come forth
again.</p>
<p>They came, Miss Priscilla pale and shaken, yet making a spirited
attempt to conceal her feelings, the Major, also pallid, but
truculent, and with no notion of dissembling.</p>
<p>'Perhaps you'll tell us, sir, precisely what you intend by us,'
he demanded aggressively.</p>
<p>They might have observed had they looked more closely that de
Bernis, himself, wore the strained, jaded air of a man who has
passed through an ordeal. But not on that account did his patience
desert him. He ignored the Major, however, and addressed himself
entirely to the lady, who had come to lean against the table.</p>
<p>'Be assured, at least, that I intend the best that I can
do.'</p>
<p>But Major Sands did not mean to be ignored. 'Why should you?' he
demanded. 'Being what you are, why should you?'</p>
<p>De Bernis smiled wearily. 'I see that you've been eavesdropping.
I can but assure you, and you, mademoiselle, that in spite of what
I am, you shall be as safe as I can contrive to make you.'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla looked at him with troubled eyes. 'Was it true,
what you told that pirate? Are you, indeed, associating yourself
with those...those men?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis took time to answer her. 'The question
implies a doubt. You find it incredible. From you that is a
compliment. I thank you for it. But I may not encourage it.'</p>
<p>'Then your service to Captain Bransome, your taking command on
the gun-deck, was a pretence?'</p>
<p>'A reasonable inference.' He shrugged. 'It is useless to argue
against facts. Remembering that, you will perhaps remember that it
is also a fact that, for the time being at least, I have made you
safe from Captain Leach and his crew. If the word of a buccaneer
counts for anything with you, believe that it will be my aim to
send you safely home to England. Unfortunately, this is not
possible at once. Delays are unavoidable now. And there may be
anxieties and discomforts. But I hope--and, indeed, I am
confident--nothing worse. Meanwhile, I will beg you to keep the
cabin, where I shall contrive that you are private.'</p>
<p>Upon that he left them to go on deck.</p>
<p>In the gloom of the gangway he only just saved himself from
tripping over a body. It proved to be that of Sam the steward, who
had been caught there and cut down by the buccaneers when they had
been on their way to invade the cabin. Monsieur de Bernis verified
that the Negro was dead, and passed on.</p>
<p>He came out into the horrible shambles of the waist, still
strewn with the bodies of the fallen men who had composed the crew
of the <i>Centaur</i> and of three or four buccaneers whom they had
cut down before being, themselves, overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Captain Bransome lay, with a cloven skull, where he had fallen
at the foot of the companion, so that to go up to the quarter-deck
de Bernis had to step over the body of that good-natured burly
fellow, who last night had been rejoicing in the thought that this
was his last voyage. His last voyage it had proved, indeed, and it
had ended sooner far than he had been expecting.</p>
<p>If de Bernis thought of this and bestowed an inward sigh on that
honest life, so ruthlessly and wantonly extinguished in the very
moment of reaching for the reward of its industry and courage, his
countenance remained nevertheless set and impassive, as he went up
the companion, a brave, jaunty figure in his violet and silver.</p>
<p>From a knot of men gathered about the main hatch, from which the
coaming had been removed, came a hailing cheer for him in a sudden
cry of:</p>
<p>'Topgallant! Topgallant!'</p>
<p>It informed him that the news of his presence and identity and
of the enterprise to which he was to lead them had already spread
through the ranks of Tom Leach's followers.</p>
<p>The cry was taken up by others on the forecastle. It drowned the
sounds of merriment that were emerging from the galley, to tell of
ruffians finding entertainment there.</p>
<p>De Bernis paused, midway in his ascent of the companion, and
half-turned to wave a hand in acknowledgement to his acclaimers.
Then he went on, and stepped upon the quarter-deck, to meet the
lowering glance of Leach. The Captain engaged there with Wogan and
a score of hands, considering the tangle overhead which had
resulted from the boarding, and dictating measures for disengaging
the two vessels, which now, with yards almost bare, were drifting
slowly before the breeze. Aboard both ships hands were already
aloft, clearing the yards of the <i>Black Swan's</i> foremast from
those of the <i>Centaur's</i> mizzen. In boarding, the buccaneers
had grappled their fore-chains to the after-chains of the
<i>Centaur</i>, so as to avoid coming alongside her gun-ports,
lest, as a last act of despairing rage, the merchantman should have
fired a broadside when in touch, even at the risk of herself being
sunk. A gangway still connected the forecastle of the <i>Black
Swan</i> with the poop of the <i>Centaur</i>.</p>
<p>It was in the articles that Monsieur de Bernis had signed with
Captain Leach that the Frenchman should take command of the
captured vessel with a prize crew from the <i>Black Swan</i>. De
Bernis had insisted upon this, claiming it as due to a leader of
his distinction among buccaneers. Grudgingly Captain Leach had
yielded the point. But now that de Bernis came on deck to exercise
his command, he was to learn that the other had found a way to
curtail it.</p>
<p>'Wogan stays aboard wi' you,' he was curtly informed. 'Ye'll
need a lieutenant. And ye'll have Halliwell for your
sailing-master.'</p>
<p>De Bernis was under no delusion as to his real intention. These
men were placed here by the pirate's suspicious nature to keep him
honest. He displayed, however, no sign of resentment.</p>
<p>'That suits me very well, provided it is understood they take
their orders from me.' And he proceeded immediately to the
assertion of his authority. 'We'll begin at once by getting the
carpenters to work on the rudder-head, and swabbers to clean up the
mess you've made on these decks. I like a tidy ship.'</p>
<p>Leach eyed him malevolently, with the suspicion of a sneer, but
offered him no hindrance. Within ten minutes a score of hands were
at the work. The grim evidences of the fight were heaved overboard,
and with pails and swabs, a dozen bare-legged fellows were sluicing
and swabbing the waist, the quarter-deck, and the poop, whilst from
below came the sounds of the carpenters' hammers to announce the
progress of repairs upon the rudder-head, so that the
steering-tackles might be restored.</p>
<p>With the same brisk authority de Bernis took in hand the
disentangling of the fouled rigging, himself ordering the raising
and lowering of yards and spars so as to clear them, displaying in
all that he did his practical seamanship, and ignoring Halliwell,
the sailing-master, whom Leach had summoned.</p>
<p>An hour later, when the two ships were ready to part company,
and none but the crew of a hundred men appointed to the
<i>Centaur</i> remained aboard her, Leach himself was disposed to
return to his own vessel.</p>
<p>On the point of doing so, he must, of course, require at last of
de Bernis to be informed of their destination.</p>
<p>'We steer a course due south-west, for the islands at the mouth
of the Gulf of Maracaybo,' he was answered. 'If we should become
separated, our rendezvous is off Cape de la Vela.'</p>
<p>'Is that our destination? Do we wait there for the plate fleet?'
Keenness gleamed in the little dark eyes of the buccaneer as they
watched de Bernis' countenance.</p>
<p>'Oh, no,' he was answered. 'That is merely the first stage of
our voyage.'</p>
<p>'And from there?' Leach pressed him.</p>
<p>'That you shall learn when we get there.'</p>
<p>Leach's annoyance displayed itself. Look'ee, Bernis'...he was
beginning with some vehemence. Then he checked, shrugged, turned on
his heel, and so departed to his own ship, there to wait until the
restoration of the <i>Centaur's</i> steering-tackles and repairs to
her yards should enable them to proceed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Black Swan</i> was warped away by sweeps from
the other vessel, and stood by, hove to.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla and Major Sands were first made aware of this
manoeuvre by the sudden growth of daylight in the cabin following
upon the withdrawal of the great screen formed by the hull of the
<i>Black Swan</i> on their larboard quarter. It led to the breaking
of the silence which had endured between them for some time. The
Major, filled by what he conceived a just resentment of Miss
Priscilla's obstinate reluctance fully to accept his definite
conclusions concerning Monsieur de Bernis, had sat moodily sulking
for the last half-hour.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla, listless on the stern-locker, leaning sideways
against a bulkhead, now called his attention to the other vessel's
withdrawal.</p>
<p>He rose from his seat at the table, where he had been fortifying
himself out of the rum left there by the buccaneers, and crossed in
silence to her side.</p>
<p>'Heaven knows what it means for us,' she said.</p>
<p>His answer was first a dismal sigh, and then, since what fills a
man's mind excessively must be flowing over, he began again upon a
theme which had already led them as near the edge of disagreement
as was possible for two persons so closely allied by a common
peril.</p>
<p>'It is incredible that you should for a moment have believed in
this man, Priscilla. Incredible, stab me! Let it serve you as a
warning against your own inexperience. Another time perhaps you
will trust to my riper judgement.'</p>
<p>'There may not be another time,' she reminded him.</p>
<p>'Indeed, I fear that there may not be.'</p>
<p>'If there is, it will be thanks to Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>This was to reopen the discussion at its bitterest point. It
looked as if it would lead again to sharp disagreement.</p>
<p>'To Monsieur de Bernis? To him! Thanks to him?' The Major turned
away in his annoyance. He strode across the cabin and back again.
He and Miss Priscilla were alone there, Pierre having withdrawn to
the little pantry that had been the unfortunate Samuel's stronghold
at the forward end of the cabin on the starboard side.</p>
<p>'You can still put trust in him? In this pirate rogue?'</p>
<p>'I can put trust in no one else. If he fails us...' She made a
little gesture of helplessness to complete her meaning.</p>
<p>Major Sands would have given years of his life to have been able
to reproach her with her lack of trust in himself. Since the
circumstances denied him this consolation, he grew increasingly
bitter.</p>
<p>'You can still say this after all that we have overheard?
Knowing the devilry now afoot? Knowing that this rascal is making
common cause with these other scoundrels? You can say this when he
had the insolence to pass you off as his wife?'</p>
<p>'In what case should we be if he had not? That was something
done to save me.'</p>
<p>'You are quite sure of that? 'Slife! Then ye're singularly
trusting.'</p>
<p>Her pallor deepened before the implication of his sneer. But she
flashed defiance of his mistrust. During the silence that had
prevailed between them, she had been thinking deeply, reviewing the
whole situation; and she had perceived at least one little feature
that told strongly in de Bernis' favour. She mentioned it now.</p>
<p>'If his motives were as base as you imply, why did he trouble to
spare you? Why did he pass you off as his brother-in-law?'</p>
<p>To the Major it was a startling question, to which at the moment
he could discover no plausible answer. In that, however, he saw no
reason why he should depart from his settled conviction, and admit
an explanation favourable to de Bernis. 'Can I guess his base
intentions?'</p>
<p>'Yet you are guessing them. Guessing them to be base. Why?' She
smiled a little wanly. 'If he had let them cut your throat, you
could not now be speaking evil of him.'</p>
<p>'Gadslife, madam!' He grew almost apoplectic. 'For obstinacy
commend me to a woman. I hope the sequel may justify this stubborn,
unreasonable belief in a blackguard. I hope it may. But, to be
frank, I cannot hold the hope with confidence. Stab me if I
can!'</p>
<p>'Now that is brave in you, Major Sands. Brave--is it not?--to
have so little regard for the anxieties of a woman in my case.'</p>
<p>He was stung to penitence. 'Oh, forgive me, Priscilla. It is
just my anxiety for you that goads me on. Blunderingly, perhaps. I
would give my life for you, my dear...'</p>
<p>It was Monsieur de Bernis that interrupted him. 'Let us hope, my
dear Major, that so much may not be required of you.'</p>
<p>Startled, Major Sands swung round, to see the Frenchman standing
within the cabin doorway. He entered, and closed the door. He
advanced towards them, his manner quietly assured. 'All is now
arranged,' he informed them, in his pleasant, level voice. 'I am in
command of this ship, and you will regard yourselves as my
guests.'</p>
<p>'And Captain Bransome, sir?' she asked him, her voice a little
out of control, her eyes watching him the while.</p>
<p>His dark, saturnine face, however, was entirely unrevealing. It
was as expressionless as his tone when he answered her after a
perceptible pause.</p>
<p>'Captain Bransome did his duty by his ship. Had he behaved as
bravely earlier, he might now be alive.'</p>
<p>'Dead! He is dead?' The horror of it drove her white to the very
lips. It seemed so impossible that a man so vigorous and hearty, so
full of life, going home in such fond expectancy of reunion with
his wife and the family which scarcely knew him, should have been
cut off so abruptly and cruelly.</p>
<p>De Bernis slightly inclined his head. 'He said last night that
this was his last voyage. Oddly prophetic; yet falsely so. He is at
peace. He looked to the future, he said, to make amends to him for
the past. He is spared the discovery that the future can never do
that.'</p>
<p>'My God!' cried the Major, 'this is horrible! And you can talk
of it so? You might have saved that poor fellow...'</p>
<p>'Ah, that, no,' de Bernis interrupted. 'When I went on deck, it
was already too late. Indeed, the fight was ended before Leach came
down here.'</p>
<p>'And the others? The crew?'</p>
<p>In the same colourless voice de Bernis replied: 'It is not the
practice of Captain Leach to take prisoners.'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla uttered a groan, and sank her face into her
hands. She was assailed by a feeling of nausea, of faintness. As
from a distance she heard that level, pleasantly modulated voice
speaking in its stiff, faultless English faintly softened by a
Gallic accent. 'Let my sense of hospitality reassure you both. Here
you are in no danger, beyond that of a little delay and
inconvenience. Now that all is arranged, I can repeat the assurance
with confidence.'</p>
<p>Hotly contemptuous came the answer from Major Sands: 'What is it
worth, sir, this assurance from you who usurp the place of that
murdered man?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis preserved an unruffled urbanity. 'Whatever it
may be worth, it is all that I have to offer. You would be wise to
rest content with it.'</p>
<p>He turned aside, to summon Pierre and give him orders to lay
dinner for five persons. He explained this, addressing himself to
Miss Priscilla. 'My lieutenant and my sailing-master will take
their meals with us. I would have spared you this but that it would
scarcely be prudent. Beyond that, however, you need fear no
invasion of your privacy, and, except during meals, this cabin will
be exclusively your own.'</p>
<p>Her clear blue eyes considered him steadily and searchingly,
from out of her pallid face. But his aloof and rather chilling
impassivity baffled scrutiny. She inclined her head.</p>
<p>'We are in your power, sir. It only remains for us to thank-you
for any consideration you may show us.'</p>
<p>A little frown puckered his dark brow. 'In my power? Oh, that!
Say, rather, under my protection.'</p>
<p>'Is there a difference?'</p>
<p>'When we are all in the power of circumstances, Priscilla.'</p>
<p>She imagined the beginnings of a disclosure in this, and would
have pursued it, but the Major must at that moment come blundering
in, indignantly.</p>
<p>'You make very free with Miss Harradine's name, sir.'</p>
<p>'Of necessity. Like the rest. Is she not my wife? And are you
not my brother-in-law, my dear Bartholomew?'</p>
<p>The Major quivered, and glared at him. Perceiving the one and
the other, Monsieur de Bernis stiffened as if he had been struck.
He spoke now with an incisive edge to his tone. 'You embarrass me
damnably. Another in my place might end it quickly. Pray remember
that, Bartholomew. And be good enough, both of you, to address me
as Charles, unless you want to endanger your necks with my own. The
intimacy may be distasteful to you, Bartholomew. But less
distasteful, I hope, than to find yourself swinging from a yardarm.
That is not at all amusing.'</p>
<p>On that he went out again, leaving the Major in a fever of
indignation.</p>
<p>'By God! That cut-throat had the audacity to threaten me, I
think.' From that reckless beginning he would have continued
recklessly to pour out his wrath had Priscilla not collected wit
and strength to check him, her eyes on the lean, soft-footed
half-caste, who was busy with the table.</p>
<p>'After all, Bart,' she reminded him, 'Monsieur de Bernis did not
invite Captain Leach to come aboard the <i>Centaur</i>.'</p>
<p>'But he welcomed him! He associates himself with this
bloodthirsty scoundrel! He has confessed that it was his intention
to join that murderer, and that the ruffian's assault of us was
timely. What better is he?'</p>
<p>'I wonder?' said Miss Priscilla.</p>
<p>Amazement brimmed his pale eyes. 'You wonder? After what you've
just heard? When you know him to be in command here in the place of
that poor murdered Bransome?'</p>
<p>'Oh, but that proves nothing--as against all the rest.'</p>
<p>'Nothing? It proves that he's a damned pirate, a cut-throat
villain...'</p>
<p>She was on her feet to check him; for Pierre, who had
momentarily passed into the pantry, was coming forth again. 'And
you prove that you're a fool,' was her interruption. 'And unless
you can succeed in concealing it, you'll come by a fool's end
before long, and you may drag others with you.'</p>
<p>He could only gasp and stare, shocked, scandalized beyond all
expression that a child, so meek and gentle as he had always
supposed Priscilla, should bring herself to address him--a man of
his parts, an officer of his consequence--in such outrageous terms.
It passed all understanding. He could but suppose that the events
of that terrible morning must have unbalanced her reason. When he
had recovered breath, he began remonstrances, which she cut short
with the same incredible new-found manner. In a moment of Pierre's
absence, she stepped close up to him, caught his arm in a tight
grip, and muttered swiftly: 'Will you rant so before that man of
his? Have you no sense or discretion?'</p>
<p>If she thus made him aware that she was justified of her
apprehensions, nothing in his view could justify the terms she
chose in which to convey her warning to him. He was profoundly
annoyed, his sense of fitness outraged. He said so, pompously. And
having said so lapsed again into a sullen silence in which she
judged it best to leave him, since in that mood at least he could
do no damage.</p>
<p>Thus until Monsieur de Bernis returned, accompanied now by the
tall Irishman Wogan, and an extremely corpulent but nevertheless
powerful-looking man, of middle height with enormous shoulders, an
enormous dewlap, and features that were by contrast ridiculously
small. He presented him as Halliwell, the sailing-master.</p>
<p>They got to table, and Pierre, ever swift and silent in his
movements, a very shadow of a man, came forth to wait upon
them.</p>
<p>De Bernis took the chair in which the ill-starred Bransome had
sat, so care-free and good-humoured, as lately as last night. He
placed Miss Priscilla and the Major on his right, with their backs
to the light, Wogan on his immediate left, and the elephantine
sailing-master beyond him.</p>
<p>It was a gloomy meal. At first the pirates were disposed to be
hilarious. But something compelling in de Bernis' cold manner and
the silent aloofness of the supposed Madame de Bernis and her
supposed brother gradually damped their humour. Wogan's dark,
flat-featured face became mask-like in sullen resentment. The
sailing-master, however, a man of voracious appetite, considering
nothing at table of an importance to compare with the victuals,
discovered here all the entertainment he could desire in the fresh
meat and vegetables in which the <i>Centaur</i> was well-found.
Noisy and repulsive in his feeding, he paid little heed to anything
else.</p>
<p>The Major curbed himself with difficulty from reproving the
fellow's abominable table-manners. As for Miss Priscilla, overcome
by the horrors of the day upon which these table companions placed
a culminating horror, secretly racked by fears, and entirely
miserable, yet bravely dissembling it, she made a pretence of
eating that could have deceived no one who had been concerned to
observe it.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>Chapter 8. In Command</h2>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis paced the high poop of the <i>Centaur</i> in
the starlit, moonless, tropical night. His tall figure could be
seen by those in the waist below, sharply silhouetted in black
against the golden glow of the great poop-lamp as in his pacings he
crossed and recrossed the ambit of its light.</p>
<p>The wind had dropped at sunset to the merest breeze, but without
changing its quarter, and with her sails spread to receive it, the
<i>Centaur</i>, her steering-tackles restored and spars repaired,
led the way on that south-westerly course which Monsieur de Bernis
had laid. An eighth of a mile or so astern three tall poop-lamps
showed where Tom Leach followed in the <i>Centaur's</i>
phosphorescent wake.</p>
<p>As a result of the softened wind, the night was hot, and most of
the buccaneers who now made up her crew were above-decks. They
swarmed in the waist and under the booms amidships on which the
boats were stowed. There slush-lamps glowed like gigantic
fireflies. About these they were gathered in groups, at
seven-and-eleven, and intermittently the rattle of dice in the
pannikins that did duty as dice-boxes would merge into the noise of
their chatter and laughter with an occasional explosive oath or the
loud calling of a main. On the forecastle someone scraped a fiddle,
providing a discordant accompaniment to a bawdy song which,
although by no means new to the audience, had not yet lost its
power of provoking coarse hilarity.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis heard little and heeded less of all this. His
mind was preoccupied, turning inwards, away from his senses, to
resolve a problem with which he was confronted.</p>
<p>Towards midnight he came down the companion, and took his way
towards the gangway leading to the cabin. Near the entrance to
this, Wogan and Halliwell leaned against a bulkhead at the break of
the poop in muttered talk. They fell silent at his approach, and
gave him good night as he passed them.</p>
<p>The entrance to the gangway was a black cavern. The slush-lamp
swinging there to light it had been extinguished, and as de Bernis
stepped into the gloom he was aware--for his perceptions were now
restored to their normal keenness--that something moved there very
softly. He checked, to be instantly reassured by a voice, breathing
a word with ghostly softness.</p>
<p>'Monsieur!'</p>
<p>He went on, following the invisible and inaudible Pierre who had
stood sentinel, and who, he surmised, would have been responsible
for the fact that the lamp there was extinguished.</p>
<p>In the light of the cabin, after the door had been closed, the
young half-caste's keen-eyed face with its prominent cheek-bones
looked grave. He spoke swiftly, in French, his voice soft and
liquid. He had been on his way to the deck to take the air, when,
as he reached the entrance of the gangway, he had heard the voices
of Halliwell and Wogan; and Wogan had mentioned the name of de
Bernis in a tone that in itself had been informing to Pierre. He
had gone quietly back, and had extinguished the light, so that he
should not be seen. Then he had crept up to the entrance, and had
stood there listening to the conversation of those two. It had
disclosed to him the treachery in the minds of those whom Monsieur
de Bernis had now joined, and Captain Leach was in it. The
intention was to let him guide them to the plate fleet, and then
pay him his share of the plunder in cold steel. Wogan had disclosed
this to allay Halliwell's grumbling at the fifth share which under
the articles de Bernis claimed for himself. Halliwell had accounted
the claim preposterous and was blaming Leach for having agreed such
terms. Wogan had laughed at him for being such a fool as to believe
that the terms would be kept. De Bernis should take what they chose
to give him. If that didn't satisfy him--and there was no cause to
be overgenerous--they'ld slit his throat for him, and so make an
end of an impudent swaggering dawcock.</p>
<p>Halliwell, however, was not so easily to be reassured. De Bernis
had always been known for a tricky, slippery devil, who had a way
of defeating brute force by artifice. He called to mind more than
one trick that de Bernis had played on the Spaniards at Panama, and
but for which Morgan might never have had the town. He called to
mind that it was de Bernis' wit had found a way to deal with the
herd of wild bulls which the Spaniards had goaded into charging the
buccaneers on the savannah. Halliwell had been there. He talked of
what he had seen; and he knew the opinion in which de Bernis was
held. It was not merely for his pimpish foppishness that they
called him the Topgallant. In a tight place de Bernis knew how to
supply just the little more that made all the difference to their
sailing powers. Did Wogan and Leach suppose that de Bernis would
not be fully aware of the possibility of just what they
proposed?</p>
<p>'Sure now he may be aware of it. But it's the risk he has to
take. How could he be helping himself?'</p>
<p>'I don't know,' said Halliwell. 'If I did, I should be as spry
as de Bernis himself. Ye'll not persuade me he don't know what he's
doing, and just what we might do.'</p>
<p>'Why shouldn't he be trusting us to keep faith?' Wogan had
countered confidently. 'He's a buccaneer of the old sort. They
respected articles. And we'll do nothing to alarm him. Until we
have the plate fleet gutted, we'll just be humouring him and
suffering all his impudence. But if there's too much of it, sure
we'll be keeping the score, so we will. And it's the fine reckoning
we'll be presenting at the end.'</p>
<p>And then Monsieur de Bernis had come down the companion, and the
talk had ceased.</p>
<p>The Frenchman heard his servant out. He stood by the table, chin
in hand, his face thoughtful, but neither surprised nor
alarmed.</p>
<p>'Bien, mon fils,' he said, when Pierre had ended. And he added,
after a moment: 'It is just what I supposed would happen.'</p>
<p>His calm seemed to fill his servant with alarm. 'But the danger,
monsieur?'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes. The danger.' Monsieur de Bernis smiled upon the
other's gravity. 'It is there. At the end of the voyage, Until
then, we have something in hand. Until the plate fleet is gutted,
as they say, they will humour me and suffer all the impudence I may
show them. I may show them a good deal of it.' He laid a hand on
the slim lad's shoulder. 'Thanks, Pierre, for your diligence. But
no more of it. You take risks, and it is not necessary. Preserve
yourself against my real need of you. And now, to bed with you. It
has been a heavy day for us all.'</p>
<p>In the interests of his fellow voyagers, or, perhaps, purely
from a chivalrous interest in Miss Priscilla, Monsieur de Bernis
displayed next morning some of the impudence which Wogan and
Halliwell condemned in him. Coming early on deck, and finding the
two together there, he addressed to them as a command what might
better have been preferred as a request.</p>
<p>'Madame de Bernis is in delicate health. Sometimes she sleeps
late. I desire that the cabin be left to her in the morning, so
that she may not be disturbed. You understand?'</p>
<p>Wogan's face darkened as he looked at the Frenchman standing
before him so straight and aloof and with such airs of master.
'Sure now, I don't understand at all,' said he. 'What of breakfast?
We must eat, I suppose, by your gracious leave.'</p>
<p>'You'll break your fast in the wardroom, or where else you
choose. But not in the cabin.'</p>
<p>He did not wait for an answer, but passed on to make a round of
inspection of the ship.</p>
<p>When he was out of earshot, Wogan breathed gustily in his
indignation. 'Airs and graces, by God! It's not fine enough we are,
you and me, Ned, for madam. The delicate piece! Well, well! Maybe
there'll be another opinion before all's done. The delicate piece
may have to learn to be less delicate, so she may. Meanwhile, what
shall we be doing?'</p>
<p>'Same as you said last night,' grumbled the corpulent
ship-master. 'Humour him. Pay out rope. So long as we break our
fast, what odds where we breaks it? To tell you my mind, I found it
none so joyful at table with them yesterday. Madam with as many
simpers as a court-slut from Whitehall, and her brother mute but
for grunts, and this Bernis with his fine, pimpish manners. Bah! I
wonder the food didn't turn sour on my stomach.' He spat
ostentatiously. 'Give me the wardroom by all means, says I. I likes
to be at my ease at table.'</p>
<p>Wogan slapped him on the shoulder: 'And it's entirely right ye
are, Ned. And, faith, we'll let him know it.'</p>
<p>So, presently, when de Bernis was returning, he found an
Irishman awaiting him arrayed in sarcasm.</p>
<p>''Twas a fine notion yours, Charley, of the wardroom for Ned and
me. We're much obliged. So well do we like it that we'll not be
troubling your lively madam and her hilarious brother with any more
of our company at all. Ye understand?'</p>
<p>'Perfectly You have my leave to keep to the wardroom.' And he
passed on, up the companion, to the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>The shipmaster and the lieutenant remained staring at each other
a little dumbfounded.</p>
<p>'He gives us leave!' said Wogan at last. Did ye hear that now?
He gives us leave. Glory be! I wonder if he has his match afloat
for impudence.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, now on the poop, leaning on the taffrail, and
observing the <i>Black Swan</i> where she followed in their wake,
her yards squared to the breeze, Monsieur de Bernis was
thoughtfully frowning. It would be a half-hour or so later when he
roused himself from his deep abstraction. As he took his elbows
from the rail and suddenly drew himself erect, the deep lines of
thought were smoothed out of his face. Into their place crept the
creases of a speculative smile.</p>
<p>He turned, and came briskly down to the quarter-deck, where
Halliwell was at the moment conning the ship and instructing the
quartermaster at the whip staff below.</p>
<p>He surprised him by commanding him to heave to and to signal to
the <i>Black Swan</i> to heave to also. Further, he desired a boat
to be manned and launched to take him aboard Tom Leach's ship. He
had a word to say to her Captain.</p>
<p>He was obeyed, of course, and a half-hour later he was climbing
up the side of the <i>Black Swan</i>, on which the paint was
blistering and cracked, to be received by Leach with a volley of
blasphemous questions touching the purpose of this morning call and
the time it wasted.</p>
<p>'As for time, we have time to spare. And even if we had not, it
would still be my way to go surely rather than swiftly.'</p>
<p>He stood at the head of the entrance-ladder, tall, commanding,
and oddly elegant for a buccaneer. Others of his kind had attempted
modishness in their exteriors, but none had ever achieved it so
completely as de Bernis. He had an instinctive sense of the value
of dress and appointments, and of the authority and the aloofness
necessary to authority which these can lend a man. It was just such
a sense as this which had led Sir Henry Morgan to aim at splendour
of apparel, but, lacking the inbred refinements of de Bernis' mind
and the restraints which it imposes, he had never achieved more
than a gaudy ostentation.</p>
<p>By contrast with the Frenchman, Leach in his gaping shirt and
red breeches, wearing his own black hair in short clustering greasy
curls, looked a coarse ruffian capable of commanding only by
aggressiveness and noisy, blustering self-assertion.</p>
<p>'It would be your way, would it? Thee's come to give orders,
then?'</p>
<p>'I've come to discuss with you our precise destination,' was the
answer in that cold, level voice, a voice which seemed constantly
to announce that, whatever emotions might be excited in its owner,
fear would never be one of them.</p>
<p>The hands crowding the waist looked on with interest, and even
with a certain admiration for de Bernis, an admiration by no means
due only to his fine exterior and impressive manner, but nourished
by all those legends which had come to be woven about his name as a
result of his activities when he had sailed and marched with
Morgan.</p>
<p>His answer meanwhile had curbed the aggressiveness of Leach. If
there was one piece of information the pirate craved at that
moment, it was just this which de Bernis announced that he came to
give him. Once in possession of that, he would soon know how to
change the Frenchman's tone.</p>
<p>'Come below,' he said shortly, and led the way.</p>
<p>As they went, he beckoned first to one and then to another of
the buccaneers to follow, and when they came to the spacious but
unclean and untidy cabin, de Bernis made the acquaintance of the
mate and the sailing-master of the <i>Black Swan</i>. Both were
short, sturdy scoundrels. Ellis, the mate, elected to take the
place previously held there by Wogan, was a red flame of a man,
with fiery hair and beard and red rims to a pair of pale cruel eyes
that seemed to have no eyelashes. Bundry, the sailing-master, was
dark with a pock-marked face that was of the colour of clay He wore
clothes of a decent, sober cut, and affected a certain
fastidiousness of person and quiet dignity of manner.</p>
<p>They sat down, and an elderly Negro, clad only in a pair of
cotton drawers and with the mark of the branding-iron on his
shoulder, brought a punch of rum and limes and sugar, and then
withdrew at a growl from Leach.</p>
<p>'Now, Charley,' the Captain invited his visitor, 'we's
waiting.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis sat forward, leaned his elbows on the stained
table, which was of solid, heavy oak, and faced Leach squarely. His
opening was unexpected.</p>
<p>'I've been observing your sailing,' he said. 'Not that it was
necessary, or that it told me much more than I had discerned
yesterday. I've already said, as you may remember, that you've been
overlong at sea.'</p>
<p>'And that's a fact,' Bundry cut in. 'Ye don't need to be a
seaman to perceive it.'</p>
<p>'Ye'll talk when I bid you,' Leach growled at him, as if annoyed
by this early agreement with anything that de Bernis might say.
'What next?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis paused a moment before continuing. Bundry's
confirmation of his opening statement was as encouraging to him as
it was unexpected, and as it had been irritating to the Captain. He
was strengthened by the quick perception that he had here an ally
in what he came to do, and that, therefore, his task was suddenly
rendered lighter than he could have hoped.</p>
<p>'I told you yesterday that so foul is your bottom that if I had
been in command of the <i>Centaur</i> you'ld never have boarded
her. In fact, Tom, you'ld still be chasing me if by now I hadn't
sunk you, although you've forty fine guns and the <i>Centaur</i>
only half that number of poor pieces.'</p>
<p>After a moment's surprise, Tom Leach received the statement with
a loud, jeering laugh. Ellis grinned broadly. But Bundry's
countenance, which the scarring of the smallpox had rendered
naturally expressionless, remained grave, as de Bernis
observed.</p>
<p>'Ye was ever a ruffling, fleering coxcomb, Charley, puffed up
wi' your own conceit. But this beats anything I've ever heard even
from you. There's a great fighting seaman, to be sure. The devil of
a topgallant, high above all other canvas. Maybe thee'll tell us
how thee'ld ha' done this miracle.'</p>
<p>'Your sailing-master isn't laughing,' said de Bernis.</p>
<p>'Eh?' Leach scowled inquiry at the solemn Bundry.</p>
<p>'That's because he guesses what's in my mind,' de Bernis
continued. 'He's not without intelligence. He knows that if the
<i>Centaur</i> with her well-greased keel had beaten up against the
wind, she would probably have outsailed you.'</p>
<p>'Outsailing me is one thing, sinking me another. You spoke o'
sinking me.'</p>
<p>'A ship that can be outsailed may be sunk if the other is
skilfully and resolutely handled. In a sea-fight mobility is all.
To swing into position swiftly, to loose a broadside, and to be off
again, with masts in line, showing the narrowest mark to your
opponent, that is the whole art of sea-fighting. And this the
<i>Centaur</i> could have done, and would have done, had I been in
her master's place. I'ld have turned and twisted about you like a
panther about an elephant, taking my chance to strike before ever
your barnacled keel would answer the helm to ward the blow.'</p>
<p>Leach shrugged contemptuously. 'Maybe ye would, and maybe ye
wouldn't. But whether ye would or whether ye wouldn't, what's this
to do with our destination?'</p>
<p>'Aye,' said the fiery-faced Ellis. 'Let's hear something besides
boasting from you.'</p>
<p>'You'll hear something very uncivil from me, unless you practice
civility yourself,' he was coldly answered.</p>
<p>Leach smote the table with his fist. 'Hell!' he roared. 'Is it
just to be talk and talk until we fall to quarrelling, or are we to
come to business? I ask thee again, Charley, what's all this to do
wi' our destination?'</p>
<p>'Everything. What I've been saying is meant to show you that you
are in no case to go into serious action; and ye're not to make the
mistake of underrating the ships or the men of the plate fleet.
They will be stout, well-found, well-manned frigates. The two ships
we possess will readily account for them if properly handled. But
you must first put yourself in case to handle them properly. The
stake we play for is too heavy to admit of risks.'</p>
<p>'Ye said they would have no more nor two hundred and fifty men
atween 'em.'</p>
<p>'But they've seventy guns to our sixty, and better guns than
ours, and they are three keels to two; clean, nimble keels. Will
you go shackled into the fight?'</p>
<p>Some of the aggressiveness departed out of Leach. But not all of
it. He still sought to swagger. 'Od rot you! Why make
difficulties?'</p>
<p>'I don't make them. They exist. I desire them removed.'</p>
<p>'Removed?'</p>
<p>'Removed. Ye must careen the <i>Black Swan</i> before we come to
this engagement.'</p>
<p>'Careen!' Leach was aghast. 'Careen?' he repeated, his brow
black with disagreement.</p>
<p>'Ye've no choice unless you want to court disaster.'</p>
<p>Bundry nodded, and his lips parted, obviously, it seemed, to
express agreement. But Leach did not give him time.</p>
<p>'Sink me, man! Does thee think I needs to be taught my
trade?'</p>
<p>'If ye refuse to careen, you'll prove that you do.'</p>
<p>'That's what thee says. But what thee says isn't gospel. With
the <i>Black Swan</i> as she is, I'ld be quite ready to face your
three Spaniards; aye, and account for them. Don't let me hear any
more about careening. If ye weren't a fool, ye'ld realize that
there's no time for it.'</p>
<p>'Time and to spare. We've a full month before the plate fleet
sails. And that's more than you need to scour and grease your
keel.'</p>
<p>To prove him wrong again, as de Bernis had done, was merely to
drive Leach to entrench himself in obstinacy, which is ever the
last refuge of a stupid man. 'Whether we've time or not, I'm not
minded to do it. I'm not afeared enough of any Spaniard afloat. So
leave that out. Let's come to business now. There's been enough
idle talk. What's our destination?'</p>
<p>For a long moment de Bernis calmly considered him across the
table. Then he tossed off the punch in his pannikin, pushed back
his chair, and rose.</p>
<p>'Since ye're determined, that's the end of the matter. To engage
the plate fleet with a ship in the foul state of the <i>Black
Swan</i> is, as I said before, to court disaster. And that is
something I never court. As for your destination, you may make it
what you please.'</p>
<p>The three of them stared up at him in stupefaction,
incredulously, reluctant to believe what he seemed to convey.</p>
<p>'What d'ye mean?' cried Ellis at last.</p>
<p>'That if Captain Leach chooses to sail his ships and his men to
destruction, I'll be no party to it. You can seek other
enterprises: merchantmen like the <i>Centaur</i>, with cargoes of
logwood and hides, cocoa and spices. I'll be wishing you good
day.'</p>
<p>'Sit down!' Leach bawled at him. The Captain had come to his
feet in his anger.</p>
<p>But Monsieur de Bernis remained standing. 'Do you wish to
reconsider?'</p>
<p>'It's thee as had better consider. Thee'd better consider how we
stand. Ye're aboard my ship, and, by God, I'll have no mutineers.
Ye're here for a purpose, and that purpose ye'll fulfil.'</p>
<p>'In my own way. On my own terms,' said de Bernis, still
imperturbable.</p>
<p>'In my way, dost hear? In my way. I am master here.'</p>
<p>'Ah? And if I refuse?'</p>
<p>'Ye'll maybe end on the yardarm. Maybe worse.'</p>
<p>'So!' said de Bernis. He raised his brows. He looked down his
nose at Leach, considering him as he might have considered some
curious and not too pleasant specimen. 'Do you know, Captain, that
I have a suspicion that this crew of yours takes an interest in me,
particularly since they've learnt I am to bring them to Spanish
gold? They'll require to know why you are hanging me, Tom. What
shall you tell them? That it is because I refuse to let you lead
them to destruction? That it is because I insist that you shall
take measures to make victory assured? Is that what you will tell
them?'</p>
<p>He watched the dark, evil face before him; saw the expression
change; saw a lessening of the colour glowing through his tan. He
looked at the other two. In the face of Ellis he saw a reflection
of the Captain's discomfiture. Bundry's looked almost distressed,
and it was Bundry who spoke.</p>
<p>'When all's said, Captain, Bernis isn't altogether wrong.'</p>
<p>'I care nothing...' Leach was beginning, rallying his obstinacy,
when Ellis interrupted him.</p>
<p>'We have to care, Captain. Damme! We have to. And that's the
fact. Hell and the devil! Where's the sense o' quarrelling when our
interests are all the same. Bernis wants to do his best for us all
as well as for himself. What if his courage be less than your own,
Tom?'</p>
<p>'Caution isn't altogether a fault,' came from Bundry. 'As a
seaman I know him to be right about the state of the ship and the
rest. If we was pressed for time, we might take a chance. But since
we've time in hand, a' God's name let us spend it in making her
properly seaworthy.'</p>
<p>Thus Leach found himself abandoned by his own officers, and by
this defection realized that at present it was de Bernis who held
the trumps. By the secret in his possession of the whereabouts of
that plate fleet, he could constrain them to his ways and they
could use no constraint with him.</p>
<p>He controlled himself. He stamped down his anger, flung over it
a pretence almost of bonhomie.</p>
<p>'Aye, ye're right. Where's the sense o' quarrelling? I can admit
a fault. It's the way ye goes about things, Charley. Thee's all
quills like a hedgehog. A God's name, sit down, and fill your can,
and let's agree things friendly.' He pushed the jack of rum across,
with a propitiatory grin. Then he sat down again.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis allowed himself to be propitiated. He
permitted no faintest expression of triumph to escape him. He
inclined his head a little, in acknowledgement, resumed his seat,
and poured as he was invited.</p>
<p>'You agree, then, to careen? That is settled?'</p>
<p>'Why, since not only you but Bundry here also thinks it's
necessary, I suppose we must. Though frankly I'm not o' your ways
o' thinking. But there...It's agreed, yes.'</p>
<p>'In that case,' said de Bernis, 'the destination I came to
discuss with you, our immediate destination, should be the
Albuquerque Keys. There's an island there--Maldita--uninhabited,
and well known to me of old, with a cove in which you can hide a
dozen ships, and a long shelving beach that was made for careening.
There's not a better place in all the Caribbean. You can lie snug
there, and unsuspected, and it's convenient for another reason...'
He paused, raising an impressive forefinger. 'It lies within an
easy two days' sail of the spot at which I mean to intercept the
Spanish plate fleet.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>Chapter 9. Interlude</h2>
<p>It was on a Tuesday of the first week in June that the
<i>Centaur</i> was captured by Tom Leach. As a result of Monsieur
de Bernis' interview with him early on the following morning, the
two ships were brought a point or two nearer to the northerly wind
which continued to prevail, and steered a course WSW. Consequently
their progress became more leisurely. Nevertheless, by sunset on
Thursday the watchman in the cross-trees sighted land. It was Cape
de la Vela, a mere haze in the distance, abeam to larboard.
Daybreak on Sunday showed them ahead the low-lying group of the
Albuquerques, which was their immediate destination.</p>
<p>The five days of that voyage had passed so quietly and
uneventfully aboard the <i>Centaur</i> that it almost began to seem
to Priscilla Harradine and Major Sands as if there were, indeed, as
Monsieur de Bernis had assured them, no grounds for anxiety beyond
those begotten of this vexatious postponement of their return to
England.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, coming back from that successful trial of
strength with Captain Leach, derived from it an added confidence.
Although little or nothing of this was to be discerned on that
surface of his being, which he had schooled himself to preserve
unruffled whatever wind might blow, yet it existed in the depths of
him, and lent an added if indefinable force to his authority.</p>
<p>From this, however, he knew how and when to unbend.</p>
<p>Among buccaneers, whether ashore or afloat, there was little
discipline or regard for authority save only when in action. At all
other times the latest recruit shipped considered himself the equal
of his officers. This, indeed, was the theory of their relations.
But in practice some of the authority acquired by a captain in the
course of engagements and in matters concerned with the handling
and organization of a ship still clung to him at other times, and
to preserve it for its own sake they would hold themselves as far
aloof as they might without coming under suspicion of assumptions
of personal superiority.</p>
<p>In this respect de Bernis presented a curious mixture. Stern,
reserved, and cold of manner in all that concerned, however
remotely, his command aboard the <i>Centaur</i>, as if he had been
an officer of the Crown instead of a buccaneer leader, yet at other
times he could so far unbend as completely to cast off the mantle
of his rank and fraternize with the men. He would jest and laugh
with them, drink with them, and even dice with them, and at
seven-and-eleven he revealed himself formidable by the speed which
practice had given him in the reckoning-up of chances. Once Wogan
beheld him seated on a coil of rope on the forecastle with a crowd
of buccaneers about him, listening in rapt silence, broken now and
then by bursts of laughter, to his lively account of the taking of
the Spanish Fort of San Lorenzo on the Chagres River. On another
occasion--that was towards the end of the first dog-watch on the
evening on which they had sighted Cape de la Vela--he fetched his
guitar, and perched himself on the hatch-coaming, under the new
moon, with those wild ruffians swarming about him to listen to the
gay, tuneful little Spanish songs with which he enraptured
them.</p>
<p>And yet, so delicately did he walk that tight-rope between
familiarity and authority that none presumed upon his easy
graciousness. Whilst the men came swiftly to an increased
admiration, yet they did not entirely lose their awe of him, or a
particle of the sense of his superiority inspired by his record,
and supported by his bearing, his dress and appointments, and his
precise, cultured speech.</p>
<p>Priscilla Harradine had been shrewdly right when she had told
Major Sands that she perceived in Monsieur de Bernis a man placed
by experience and natural endowments above the petty need of
standing upon his dignity.</p>
<p>Wogan looked on in wonder and mistrust, vainly seeking to probe
the secret of the magic in which de Bernis appeared to deal. The
Irishman knew how to be one with the men at need--he could be as
foul and lewd as the vilest of them--and he knew, at need, how to
drive them. But he did not know by what arts a man could
successfully do both at the same time. He consulted Halliwell upon
this mystery. The shipmaster was prompt and contemptuous with an
explanation.</p>
<p>'French tricks,' was his terse summary, which shed no light
whatever upon Wogan's resentful darkness.</p>
<p>Major Sands was another interested and scornful observer.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis had afforded him facilities for observation.
On his return from that visit, on Wednesday morning, to the
<i>Black Swan</i>, he had informed Miss Priscilla of the
arrangements he had made with his lieutenant and his shipmaster. In
future they would take their meals in the wardroom, so that her
privacy in the cabin would not again be invaded.</p>
<p>'I would relieve you of my own company at the same time,' he
added gravely. 'But the relationship in which it is prudent that we
should appear to stand demands that I continue to intrude upon
you.'</p>
<p>She protested with some vehemence against the underlying
assumption.</p>
<p>'Can you suppose, sir, that I should be so ungracious as to
desire it?'</p>
<p>'It would not be unreasonable when all is considered. After all,
I am no better than these men.'</p>
<p>The steady glance of her blue-green eyes seemed to repudiate the
statement with indignation. 'I should be sorry, indeed, to be of
that opinion, sir.'</p>
<p>'Yet Major Sands, there, will tell you that it is the only
opinion possible.'</p>
<p>The Major, in the background, cleared his throat. But he said
nothing. It was certainly not in his mind to contradict the
Frenchman. Nor could he think that Priscilla need have been so
excessively courteous as to have troubled to do so. He was a little
shocked, therefore, to hear her not merely persisting, but actually
answering for him.</p>
<p>'Major Sands, like myself, has only gratitude for the
consideration you have shown us. For all that you have done. He
does not deceive himself as to what must have happened to us but
for you. I beg you to believe it, sir.'</p>
<p>He smiled as he inclined his periwigged head. 'I do believe it.
Major Sands leaves one in no doubt of his warm sincerity.' The
Major's colour deepened under the buffet of that irony. But,
without looking at him, Monsieur went on. 'I came to tell you also
that there is no reason why you should keep to the cabin. You may
without apprehension take the air on deck when you please. None
will venture to molest you; though if any should I'll make an
example of him that will not encourage others. I have had your
awning set for you again on the poop.'</p>
<p>She thanked him, and he went out.</p>
<p>'I wonder,' said Major Sands, 'what the sarcastic hound expects
of me.'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla looked at him without approval. 'A little
graciousness, perhaps,' she ventured.</p>
<p>'Graciousness? I am to be gracious to him?' He curbed resentment
to become pedantic. 'Shall we preserve, even amid these troubles,
our sense of proportion, Priscilla? Shall we consider precisely
where this man stands and what he has done?'</p>
<p>'By all means. Let us consider, for instance, that he has
preserved our lives. Is that nothing? Does it deserve no
thanks?'</p>
<p>He spread his hands. 'That is to consider one side only of the
question.'</p>
<p>'Is that not enough for us? With that side to consider, would a
generous mind consider any other?'</p>
<p>The asperity of her tone pulled him up sharply. This, he
perceived, would not do at all. Trouble and difficulty enough arose
out of the events. He must certainly not allow them to jeopardize
those dearest hopes of his, which had been blossoming with promise
of so rich a fruition. He must remember that women were curious
creatures, addicted to eccentricities of vision, allowing emotional
influences to deflect the light of reason. There was no prevailing
with them by hard common sense alone. It provoked their hostility.
He saw signs of this in Priscilla, and unless he changed his course
to humour her, unless he addressed himself to her emotions, rather
than to her intelligence, which he perceived to lie dormant, the
argosy of his hopes might founder under him in these very difficult
waters.</p>
<p>He assumed an air of gentle, patient melancholy.</p>
<p>'Dear Priscilla, do you realize, I wonder, the wrong you do me?'
He sighed. 'You find me wanting in generosity. You are right. And
yet how far from right. You are only halfway down my feelings.
There are depths you have not suspected. Not suspected, stab me!
You imagine, perhaps, that concern for myself is to be found down
there; that this makes me impatient--ungracious, as you say. My
dear! For myself I care nothing. For myself I could be gracious
enough to this man. I should consider only that he has preserved my
life. But my thought is all for you. All for you, stab me! If I am
impatient, ungracious, it is because of my concern for you; for the
distress, the anxieties, the fears that are afflicting you. How can
I be patient in the face of this? Damme, Priscilla! How can I?'</p>
<p>Her indignation melted before this display of noble concern
which held no thought of self. The fundamental sweetness of her
nature welled up to make her ashamed.</p>
<p>'I am sorry, Bart. I am very stupid sometimes. Forgive me,
dear.' She held out a hand to him in appeal.</p>
<p>He came nearer, gently smiling, and took it between both his
own. He was suddenly inspired by the note of tenderness which
penitence had brought into her voice. Dimly he recalled a line
heard in a play, a line written by some poet or other, one of those
absurd ranters who expressed themselves in stilted, pompous
phrases, in which sometimes, Major Sands confessed to himself, one
found a grain of sense amid a deal of nonsense. He marvelled at the
queer opportuneness with which the line came now to the surface of
his memory, not perceiving that it was his own commonplace thought
which borrowed for itself the majestic robe of that expression:
'There is a tide in the affairs of man which taken at the flood
leads on to fortune.'</p>
<p>Here now was the tide running strongly in his favour. Let him
take it at the flood.</p>
<p>'My dear! What man in my place, loving you as I do, could have
any other thought?'</p>
<p>'Dear Bart, I understand. I should have understood before.' She
looked up with soft entreaty in her candid eyes.</p>
<p>He stroked the hand he held. Gently by that hand he began to
draw her nearer. She suffered him to have his way.</p>
<p>'Do you suppose that it is easy for me to have patience, with
such circumstances surrounding the woman I love?'</p>
<p>His tone had sunk to a fond, crooning murmur. Suddenly she
seemed to freeze where she stood, almost in his arms. Her breath
quickened, the colour ebbed from her face, and the candid eyes,
that a moment ago had been so tender, held only alarm.</p>
<p>'What are you saying, Bart?' Her right hand was withdrawn from
between his fondling palms; her left pushed him gently away. 'Are
you...' she choked a little. 'Are you making love to me?'</p>
<p>In profound dismay he spread his hands. 'My dear!' he cried,
protesting vaguely.</p>
<p>'Oh! How could you? How could you at such a time?'</p>
<p>What he understood from this came mercifully to temper his
dismay. It was the time that was ill-chosen. He had been deceived,
then. The tide, after all, was not yet at the flood. Her mind,
distraught by peril, could hold the thought of nothing else. He had
blundered by precipitancy. He had startled her. It only remained to
beat a retreat in good order, and await a more propitious season
for his next advance.</p>
<p>'At such a time!' he echoed. 'But--stab me!--it is just that. It
is the time...the dreadful events...these terrible circumstances
that quicken my tenderness, my urgent wish to have you know that
you have beside you a man ready, as I have said before, to give his
life for you. If I did not owe this to my affection for you, damme,
there was my friendship for your father, my sense of duty to his
memory. What is there here to dismay you?'</p>
<p>The trouble in her mind--reflected in her eyes--was hardly
lessened; but it had changed its course. Her glance faltered.
Confused, she turned away, and moved to the stern-ports through
which the sunlight was now flooding.</p>
<p>With anxious eyes he followed the slim figure, admiring the
graceful lines of it, the quiet elegance of her movements, and so
waited. She spoke presently, when she had mastered herself.</p>
<p>'Forgive me, Bart. To be sure, I am a little fool. Don't let me
appear also an ungrateful one. I owe you so much. I must have died,
I think, but for the knowledge that you were standing by me in this
awful time. You have made me realize it. It should not have been
necessary.'</p>
<p>'It is not necessary now,' said he, very noble. 'Sink me if it
is.' And then, being a fool, he must go on to spoil it. 'But I
rejoice to hear, at least, that you are no longer in the persuasion
that you owe everything to this French rogue.'</p>
<p>Now that is just what, in her generous anxiety to make amends
for the injustice of her assumption, she had been in danger of
forgetting. His words, acting as a sharp reminder, tempered her
penitence. But she did not pursue the matter, intent at the moment
upon making her peace with him.</p>
<p>She turned, and smiled a little shyly in the consciousness of
the enormity of her late assumptions. 'Shall we take the air on
deck, Bart?'</p>
<p>They went, and beyond the leering eyes of Wogan and Halliwell,
on the quarter-deck, following her passage thence to the poop, none
seemed to notice them.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis was in the Captain's cabin, which he had now
made his own, astern, on the summit of the poop. He sat with open
doors on account of the heat. Seeing their approach, he rose, and
came forth, bringing cushions for her day-bed which she found set
for her under the awning of sailcloth as it had been before the
invasion of the <i>Centaur</i> by her present crew.</p>
<p>When this was done, he lingered on in amiable talk with them,
like a courteous host. He mentioned their altered course, expressed
a hope that the breeze might hold, spoke of their destination and
the purpose for which they sought the Albuquerque Keys, and in
answer to Miss Priscilla's questions regretted that circumstances
would delay them there for the best part of a month.</p>
<p>The Major, morose, sat on the tail of the day-bed, of which Miss
Priscilla occupied the head, making no contribution to the talk.
The notion of spending a month at the Albuquerques filled him with
disgust and indignation, and it was only by the exercise of all his
powers of repression that he avoided saying so. The cool tone in
which de Bernis made the announcement appeared to him as a climax
of impudence. And it added fuel to his indignation to observe that
Miss Priscilla did not appear to share his feelings. She seemed to
accept the situation with a resignation that went very near
complacency. His disgust reached its apex at a question which he
heard her ask in a tone of quiet wonder.</p>
<p>'Monsieur de Bernis, how did you become a buccaneer?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis seemed startled by this question, coming so
abruptly. He smiled a little as he looked down at her.</p>
<p>'You ask almost as if the fact were difficult to understand. It
is a compliment, I suppose. But can you really be interested to
know?'</p>
<p>'Should I ask such a question if I were not? The interest must
be strong that drives me to an impertinence.'</p>
<p>'Not an impertinence,' he protested quietly. 'Most pertinent
since your present situation depends so much upon the fact.' He
paused a moment, and the long narrow face was overcast with
thought, the dark eyes grew almost wistful. 'After all, there is so
little that you do not know already. Did I not tell you that the
Sieur Simon, he whom the Spaniards killed on Santa Catalina, was my
uncle? I had come out with him to the New World, in quest of the
liberty of action denied me at home in the Old. But there was no
thought of lawlessness in my mind. We are Huguenots, we Bernis,
from the Toulousain, and for a Eluguenot in France there was only
toleration. Today, since the King has revoked the Edict of Nantes,
there is not even that. But already when I was a boy there were few
opportunities for a Huguenot to find advancement in any career that
was open to a gentleman.</p>
<p>'I was the youngest of seven sons, and a career was necessary to
me. And so I took the chance my uncle offered me of seeking it in
the New World. When he was killed at Santa Catalina, I was alone
out here, without possessions and without friends, saving those
poor fellows who had escaped with me. With them I went to join
Morgan. Nothing else offered. Besides, the massacre on Santa
Catalina had bred in me such a hatred of Spaniards that I was glad
enough to march in any company that was hostile to Spain.</p>
<p>'With Morgan my rise was rapid. Birth, if it does nothing else
for a man, will at least equip him for leadership. Opportunity
served me, and I knew how to seize it. I showed Morgan that I knew
how to make men follow me. My nationality, too, once I had
displayed the gift of leadership, made me valuable to Morgan with
whom there was always a considerable French contingent. I became
his lieutenant, in command of his French following. With him, too,
I learned to fight a ship, and I doubt if there was ever a higher
school than his for that.</p>
<p>'When England's affairs ceased to justify her encouragement of
the buccaneers, and Morgan decided to accept the governorship of
Jamaica, I went with him, and took service with him under the
English Crown. After all, there was no man living to whom I owed
greater loyalty; and probably no man living whom Morgan trusted as
fully as he trusted me.' He smiled down upon her as he ceased.
'That is all,' he said.</p>
<p>'So that,' she commented thoughtfully, 'your career is hardly to
be spoken of as lawless, seeing that you ceased to be a buccaneer
once buccaneers were declared without the law.'</p>
<p>But this was too much for Major Sands. 'If that was true once,'
was his frosty interjection, 'it is unfortunately true no
longer.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis laughed, as he turned to depart. 'But why
unfortunately, Major? You, at least, should regard it as extremely
fortunate.'</p>
<p>The Major had no answer for that. His look was foolish, and he
reserved his comments upon what the Frenchman had told them until
Monsieur de Bernis had gone down to the quarter-deck, where
Halliwell stood taking the height of the sun.</p>
<p>'Morgan's trust in him hasn't prevented him from betraying it so
as to return to piracy,' the Major condemned him.</p>
<p>But Miss Priscilla, wistfully pensive, either did not hear or
did not heed him, for she made no answer. And the Major,
remembering in time how the topic of Monsieur de Bernis invariably
now led to the frontiers of acrimony, did not pursue the
subject.</p>
<p>But he returned to it more than once before they reached the
Albuquerques. His scorn of de Bernis was stimulated by that man's
free and easy association with the ruffians who made up the crew, a
matter to which he missed no opportunity of drawing Miss
Priscilla's attention, so as to justify himself in her eyes for the
feelings she was disposed to condemn in him.</p>
<p>That night when on the forecastle, under the new moon, de Bernis
was singing to his audience of pirates, the Major and the lady were
enjoying the cool on the poop. Across the length of the ship
floated that mellow, moving baritone voice.</p>
<p>'It passes belief,' said the Major, in tones of disgust, 'that a
man should make so free with a gang of cut-throats. Stab me, it
does!'</p>
<p>He never knew whether Priscilla's words were intended for an
answer.</p>
<p>'How beautifully he sings.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>Chapter 10. Careened</h2>
<p>At last, on the Sunday, they threaded the channel that ran among
the islands of the Albuquerque group, and dropped anchor in ten
fathoms, in the wide basin of the lagoon on the eastern side of
Maldita, the northernmost of the keys. It was this, which, at the
instances of de Bernis, had been selected for the careening of the
<i>Black Swan</i>.</p>
<p>The cove was as secret and sheltered a place as he had
represented it, and in every particular Leach was compelled to
admit that it could not be better suited to the purpose for which
they came.</p>
<p>The lagoon was a pear-shaped basin, narrowing at the neck,
between a reef that fringed the southern half of its sweep and a
considerable scrub-crowned bluff that screened it from the north.
Sea-birds nested on the heights of this bluff and it offered a fine
emplacement for guns to defend the entrance. Leach, however,
without experience of fortifications and of fighting on land, gave
no thought to these possibilities, and de Bernis did not appear to
be disposed to school him in them.</p>
<p>The half-moon of beach, running from bluff to reef, shelved so
gradually that the anchorage was four or five cable's length from
high-water mark. This beach was divided near the bluff by a
freshwater stream of considerable proportions for so small an
island. At the summit of this beach, which was wide and very
silvery and along which turtles scuttled clumsily when the clatter
of the anchor chains came to disturb them, rose a green wall of
palm and pimento, and the air was heavily fragrant with the scent
of spices, which the hot sun was drawing from the trees. The
island, less than a mile in width and little more than two miles
long, was densely wooded from end to end.</p>
<p>The two ships having come to anchor side by side, Leach lost no
time. The boats were lowered from both of them, and men went ashore
to fell timber for the building of stout rafts required for the
work of lightening the <i>Black Swan</i>. This lightening occupied
a full three days, in which time she was completely dismantled of
all save her masts. Not only her forty ponderous guns, but
everything else moveable, or that could be rendered moveable, went
over the side, to be floated ashore on the rafts. Finally, eased of
her ballast, she was ready to careen.</p>
<p>The work was merrily and briskly conducted by those lawless men.
They brought to it a schoolboy zest. Seeing them wading to their
armpits to receive and draw ashore the heavily laden rafts,
maintaining the while a running fire of jest and laughter, like
honest, care-free labourers, it was difficult to believe them men
of blood and violence, predatory and ruthless, holding life as
cheap as honour.</p>
<p>When at last the <i>Black Swan</i> was ready for beaching, the
two hundred and fifty men who now composed her crew set about
preparing themselves quarters ashore. There was more felling of
trees to provide poles for the vast sailcloth pavilions which they
erected along the summit of the beach in the neighbourhood of the
fresh water. For their Captain and his officers they built with
incredible rapidity a roomy log hut thatched with palmetto; and
they fitted it with hammocks and furnished it with tables and
chairs that had been taken from the ship. And whilst the main body,
industrious as a colony of ants, were about these operations,
others were at work at the boucan fires which they had lighted and
over which they were curing the turtles which they had caught.</p>
<p>At last, as the short Caribbean tide began to flow on the
morning of the third day, which was Wednesday, the <i>Black
Swan</i> slipped her anchor cables, which were picked up by the
waiting boats, and the business of warping her ashore was taken in
hand.</p>
<p>Almost naked, and sweating in the blistering sun, they toiled at
the capstan in gangs, chanting as they slowly circled it and wound
about it the straining, creaking hawsers which had been lashed to
trees at the head of the beach. The very easy gradient and the fine
soft sand assisting them, they made good progress at first. Then,
as the water grew shallower, followed a spell of slow Herculean
toil until they could bring rollers into action, and so render it
comparatively easy again.</p>
<p>Most of the day was spent before at last the great black ship
was careened, high and dry, one side of her heavily barnacled and
weeded lower hull exposed, as she lay over on the other.</p>
<p>After this the buccaneers rested and feasted, and a couple of
days of comparative idleness followed whilst they waited for the
hot sun to do its work of drying the fouled keel, so as to make it
easy to burn away the foulness.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis meanwhile took his ease aboard the
<i>Centaur</i>, where she rode at anchor in the limpid blue-green
waters of the lagoon; and with him remained the members of his
supposed family undisturbed until Wogan and Halliwell inspired
Leach to disturb them.</p>
<p>The hundred men of the <i>Centaur's</i> prize crew went daily
ashore to bear their part in the work, and returned nightly to
their hammocks and sleeping-mats aboard. And there in the cool of
the lovely tropical nights, after the heat and labours of the day,
de Bernis would be moving freely amongst them, like a gay
troubadour, to charm them with tale and song, thus deepening at
once the contempt of Major Sands and the mistrust of Halliwell and
Wogan.</p>
<p>Major Sands, ever intent to justify to Priscilla that scorn of
his for the Frenchman which he knew offended her, took him to task
for it on the day after the careening was complete.</p>
<p>It was just after eight bells, and the three of them were at
dinner in the great cabin with Pierre to wait upon them, and to
regale them with the fresh turtle and yams which one of the hands
had brought aboard last night as a present for de Bernis. Save for
the half-dozen buccaneers composing a watch, such as Leach insisted
should be kept, the men were all ashore at the time, and all was
quiet on the ship. It was nearing high water, and through the open
stern-ports they had a view of the palm-fringed beach, three
hundred yards away, deserted now, for the men were at meat in the
shade of their pavilions.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis listened patiently to the stuttered sentences
in which the Major expressed his wonder that the Frenchman could
find satisfaction in intimate association with the vile ruffians
whom Leach had put aboard the <i>Centaur</i>.</p>
<p>'Satisfaction?' was the word that de Bernis took up, echoing it
interrogatively. The narrow, saturnine face looked more saturnine
than ever. 'Which of us does only that in which he takes
satisfaction? He is fortunate, indeed, who can find real
satisfaction in anything that he does. It has not often happened to
me, Major. If it has often happened to you, your lot is
enviable.'</p>
<p>'You mean, sir?'</p>
<p>'Why, that most of the things we do in this life, we do from
sheer necessity: to ease pain, remove discomfort, preserve our
lives, or earn a livelihood. These are the chief activities that
engage most men. Do you not agree?'</p>
<p>'Stab me! You may be right. That may be the general rule of
life. I hadn't thought of it. But here, now, what necessity do you
obey when you go amongst these fellows?'</p>
<p>'But isn't it plain? I am sure that Miss Priscilla understands
me.'</p>
<p>Calmly she met the gaze of his dark eyes. 'I think I do. You
obey the necessity of disposing them favourably towards you.'</p>
<p>'And not merely towards me, but towards us all. Must I tell you
that this Leach is a treacherous, headstrong, violent beast?
Although I have associated myself with him, and although I believe
that I hold him fast in the bonds of cupidity, yet I cannot be sure
that perversity, stupidity, or the sheer evil that is in the fellow
may not drive him to burst his bonds. Do not, therefore, turn the
eye of scorn upon me because I am concerned to forge myself a
buckler against the day of need. That buckler lies in winning the
regard, even the affection, of these men.'</p>
<p>The Major made a wry face of disgust. 'Affection!' he
deprecated. 'Lord! There are some things that can be too dearly
bought.'</p>
<p>'You may be right. For myself, I am slow to reach conclusions in
these matters. But there is a detail to which you may not have
given attention. If there should be an end of me, Major, there will
certainly be an end of you and of Miss Priscilla. You will include
no illusion on that score among the many illusions from which I
have observed you to suffer.' He smiled upon the sudden utter
blankness of the Major's countenance. 'Be sparing, therefore, in
your contempt of the means by which I ensure your preservation with
my own from any of the accidents to which such a nature as Captain
Leach's might expose it.'</p>
<p>With that, and without awaiting any answer from Major Sands, he
adroitly turned the conversation into other channels, addressing
himself to Miss Priscilla whose eyes gleamed curiously as they now
met his own. Almost, he could have supposed, she took satisfaction
in the unanswerable rebuke which he had administered to the pompous
soldier.</p>
<p>At about the same time and upon the very same topic, Wogan and
Halliwell were entertaining Leach, who sat at dinner with them and
with the fiery-faced Ellis and the quiet-mannered, pock-marked
Bundry, in the log cabin that had been built for them.</p>
<p>Leach was not impressed at first. 'What's the odds?' he growled.
'Let him do as he likes until he brings us to the Spaniards. Then
it'll be my turn, as he'll find out.'</p>
<p>To Ellis and Bundry there was news in this dark hint; for unlike
Wogan and Halliwell they were not yet in the Captain's confidence
as to how he intended to square matters with de Bernis for his
intransigence over the articles. There was a queer kindling in the
furnace of Ellis' countenance. But Bundry's eyelids drooped slowly
like the membrane of a bird, and his face, with its clay-coloured
pallor upon which the ardour of the sun could make no impression,
grew more like a mask than ever.</p>
<p>The corpulent Halliwell leaned forward across the table. He
spoke quietly. 'Can ye suppose, Cap'n that possibility don't occur
to him?'</p>
<p>'What if it do? He's here, isn't he? We've got him, haven't we?
How's he to get away from us?'</p>
<p>Halliwell's little eyes were screwed up and almost disappeared
into his bulging cheeks. 'Came and put himself into your hands,
very trusting like, didn't he?' quoth his sly voice.</p>
<p>'Couldn't help his self as things fell out.' Leach was still
contemptuous.</p>
<p>'Just so,' said Halliwell. 'Just so. 'Twas in his mind, as he
told ye, to ha' gone to Guadeloupe for a ship and men wi' which to
join us. But things fell out so as he didn't need to. It don't
follow that he welcomes it. If he'd ha' joined us wi' a ship o' his
own arming, and men o' his own recruiting, he'ld not be as helpless
as he is now, would he? And ye're not supposing that Mossoo de
Bernis of all men alive isn't awake to that and to what may happen
to him.'</p>
<p>'Suppose he is. What, then? How in hell can he mend it?'</p>
<p>Impatiently Wogan flung into the discussion, so as to shed more
light on the Captain's dullness.</p>
<p>'Och, now, don't ye see that's just what he may be trying to
do?'</p>
<p>Leach sat up as if he had been stung. Wogan elaborated.</p>
<p>'There he is aboard yon ship wi' a hundred stout lads, and us
careened here, high and dry, and as helpless as if our hands was
tied behind our backs. What for is he at such pains to be making
friends with them? Putting a spell on them with tales of his brave
doings as a rover, and howling Spanish ditties to them in the
moonlight, like a love-sick tom-cat? Will ye trust him with them?
Or them with him, if it comes to that? There's Ned and me might
wake up to find we've had our throats cut in our sleep, and him
sailing away with the ship and the lads to try their luck by
theirselves against the Spaniards and keep the treasure to
theirselves. And you, Tom, careened. Careened here, with devil a
ship in which to follow him and devil a notion which way to follow
if ye had a ship.'</p>
<p>'By God!' roared Leach, and came to his feet on the oath. It was
as if a pit had suddenly yawned at his feet. What manner of
trusting fool had he been not to have seen this danger for
himself?</p>
<p>He was flinging out of the cabin in a passion of suddenly
aroused suspicions when the corpse-like Bundry seemed to come to
life.</p>
<p>'Whither away, Captain?'</p>
<p>The cold, harsh voice checked the other's haste. Bundry was
probably the only man amongst them all with power to do that. There
was something oddly compelling about this cold, emotionless,
calculating shipmaster.</p>
<p>'I am going to put it beyond Charley's power to play any of his
tricks on us.'</p>
<p>Bundry was on his feet now 'But ye'll remember that we depend
upon him to bring us to the Spaniards?</p>
<p>'I's not like to forget aught that matters.'</p>
<p>Content, Bundry let him go, and almost at once they heard him
bawling for hands to man one of the boats and take him out to the
<i>Centaur</i>. Before stepping into her, however, he summoned
Wogan from the hut, and gave him brisk orders, which made him
suddenly busy ashore.</p>
<p>And so it fell out that, as dinner was coming to an end in the
great cabin of the <i>Centaur</i>, the door opened and Captain
Leach walked in upon them unannounced.</p>
<p>He appeared less formidable than on the only other occasion when
Miss Priscilla had seen him. Then he had been bare-legged and
bare-armed, his shirt had hung open and was splashed with blood,
and his hawk-like face had looked inexpressibly evil in the
bloodlust it reflected. Today, at least his dress was reasonably
decent. He wore no doublet, but his shirt was clean, and he was
neatly shod in grey leather, with stockings also of grey.</p>
<p>He stood a moment within the doorway of the cabin observing
them. His dark glance lingered on the neat virginal figure of
Priscilla, and passed on only to be constantly returning to her,
until she grew conscious of it and uncomfortable under its bold
scrutiny which held for her something which if indefinable was
nevertheless horrible and chilling. This, however, did not happen
all at once.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, with an inaudible intake of breath, rose
from his chair. If he had the scent of danger breast-high,
nevertheless--indeed, perhaps, because of it--his manner was of a
perfect and urbane serenity.</p>
<p>'Ah, Captain! You honour us unexpectedly.' He drew out a vacant
chair and proffered it, smiling.</p>
<p>Captain Leach came forward. 'No need to sit. What I's come to
say's soon said.' He nodded to Major Sands, who accounting it
prudent to copy de Bernis' example had also risen; and he bowed to
Miss Priscilla. Repressing a shiver at the glance that accompanied
the bow, she acknowledged it by a slight inclination of her
head.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis looked on with half-closed, languid eyes.</p>
<p>The Captain turned to him. 'I've given orders to have quarters
got ready ashore for the crew o' th' <i>Centaur</i>. They're to
stop ashore until the <i>Black Swan</i> is ready for sea.' His keen
little eyes were intent for the slightest flicker on the face of de
Bernis. 'Ye understand?' he snapped.</p>
<p>'The order, yes. But not the reason. The men were very
comfortable here, and it was convenient.'</p>
<p>'Mebbe. But it's not as I wish it.' Slyly he added, 'I likes my
own men under my own hand, Charley.'</p>
<p>'But of course,' said de Bernis.</p>
<p>This apparent indifference disappointed Leach. But it merely
deepened his mistrust. He remembered having heard it said of
Morgan's French lieutenant that he was never more alert than when
he was looking languid, and he could swear there was a languor now
in the Frenchman's air.</p>
<p>There was a pause. The buccaneer's eyes slid once more to Miss
Priscilla. He bowed a little again, with affectations of gallantry
as he addressed her.</p>
<p>'I trust, ma'am, my next order will not displease or
inconvenience you. I've good reason for 't.' Slowly, as if
reluctant to depart from the contemplation of her, his eyes
returned to de Bernis. 'I've also ordered them to build a hut for
you ashore.'</p>
<p>But now, at last, de Bernis really displayed a flash of
vexation. 'Is so much necessary? We are very comfortable here.'
Contemptuously, as if to show Leach that he perfectly read his
motives, he added, 'We can hardly run away with the ship.'</p>
<p>Leach stroked his chin and smiled. 'There's three of ye aboard:
you and him and your servant yonder. I've knowed three men to sail
a boat as big as this afore now.'</p>
<p>De Bernis raised his brows. 'By God, Leach, you want to laugh, I
think.'</p>
<p>'Mebbe,' said Leach. But I mind me as, after all, 'twas by
chance I came on ye. And if thee was to take it into thee head to
be off, I'm in no case to go after thee. So thee'll come ashore
this evening, and ashore thee'll stay.' He turned again to
Priscilla. 'Ye'll forgive me, ma'am, for this, I hope. I'll see
ye're made comfortable. Ye may bring what furniture ye please so as
to make sure o' that. Ashore I'll be seeing something of ye, I
hope.'</p>
<p>When at last he had gone, the Major and Priscilla beheld for the
first time a departure in de Bernis from an imperturbability which
they had been supposing irrefragable.</p>
<p>He stood with his chin buried in the lace at his throat, his
countenance pale and disordered by anger, his hands clenched so
that the knuckles showed white. Thus in silence which they did not
venture to break. Then with a softly rapped oath, he turned on his
heel and strode the length of the cabin to the stern-ports. He
stood there looking out over the water to the beach where all was
now activity. Then again he turned and came slowly back. At last he
threw up his head with a shrug and a laugh, like a man who has
found what he was seeking.</p>
<p>'I don't understand at all,' said the Major at last. 'Stab my
vitals, if I do.'</p>
<p>De Bernis flung him a glance like a blow in its undisguised
contempt.</p>
<p>'What is there to puzzle you? The dog feared that I should
corrupt the crew he had put aboard here. He perceived the
possibility which you had not the wit to perceive, else you would
have spared me your discourtesies awhile ago.'</p>
<p>For once in his profound amazement the Major forgot to be
resentful of an offensive tone. 'As God's my life!' he ejaculated.
'D'ye mean it was in your mind?'</p>
<p>De Bernis answered him in a tone made hard by impatience.</p>
<p>'It's not my mind I am disclosing to you. But Tom Leach's. And
it's not a nice mind. Not at all a nice mind.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>Chapter 11. Ashore</h2>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis surprised Captain Leach by following him
almost immediately ashore. To the buccaneer's questions he rendered
a ready account of his purpose.</p>
<p>'Since your timorous suspicions constrain Madame de Bernis to
leave her quarters aboard, I will at least see that those prepared
for her ashore are suitable. She is in delicate health.'</p>
<p>'I marvel, then, ye should ha' brought her roving wi' ye.'</p>
<p>De Bernis answered him impatiently. 'God mend your wit! I told
you it was my intention to leave her in Guadeloupe, in her
brother's care. Could I have left her in Jamaica, when I don't
intend to return there?'</p>
<p>Leach perceived the reasonableness of this, and became amiable.
Let de Bernis make what arrangements he accounted fit.</p>
<p>The Frenchman went amongst the men, and issued his orders. They
were to build a log but at the southern extremity of the beach,
where the reef began, placing it just within the shelter of the
trees. In its neighbourhood they were to place a tent for Madame's
brother and another for de Bernis' servant, Pierre. At that
distance from the buccaneer encampment, with practically the whole
length of that long beach between, Madame should be reasonably safe
from disturbance.</p>
<p>Going to work with that speed which their numbers and experience
made possible, all was ready before sunset. The timber, felled on
the very edge of the jungle, made there an embayed clearing among
the trees in which, by de Bernis' instructions, the hut was built.
Thus it was screened from view except directly in front. The two
small sailcloth tents were placed one on each horn of this little
bay.</p>
<p>Some furniture brought from the ship: a table, four chairs, the
day-bed from the poop, a tarred sheet to spread upon the ground, a
couple of rugs wherewith partly to cover this, a slush-lamp to hang
from the rafters that carried the palmetto thatch, and some other
odds and ends by means of which the cabin's single room was
rendered reasonably inhabitable.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla, despite her anxieties, displayed pleased
surprise when she stood there that evening, and expressed her
gratitude to Monsieur de Bernis for the pains he had taken to
ensure her comfort. The quarters provided for her were so much
better than anything that she had expected.</p>
<p>Nor was de Bernis, it appeared, the only one solicitous for her.
Soon after her arrival, Tom Leach came to assure himself that all
that was possible had been done for her comfort. He had assumed an
ingratiating manner; he was all apologies for any inconvenience she
might suffer in this change of quarters, and all solicitude to
reduce this as far as might be possible. He ordered various odds
and ends to be brought from among the landed furniture of the
<i>Black Swan</i>, and desired her to use all frankness in telling
him of anything further that might be done for her well-being. He
lingered on in amiable, jocular talk awhile with her and with de
Bernis and the Major who were in attendance, and finally went off
with smirking expressions of good-will.</p>
<p>De Bernis, who had remained impassive, looked at the Major whose
bearing throughout had suggested that Tom Leach emitted an
offensive smell.</p>
<p>'Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,' he murmured.</p>
<p>'Ye know I don't speak French,' said the Major irritably, and he
wondered why Miss Priscilla laughed.</p>
<p>He wondered that she could laugh at all, whatever the occasion,
considering their circumstances. Himself he could perceive in them
only grounds for despair. This despair was rendered the more acute
by that morning's revelation that de Bernis, upon whom alone he
could base such slender hopes as might be entertained of an
ultimate deliverance, was by no means on the perfectly harmonious
terms with that other scoundrel Leach which seemed necessary if
this hope was not to be entirely illusory.</p>
<p>But there were worse vexations in store for Major Sands. When
they came to retire that night, after the supper cooked by Pierre
and served to them in the hut, the Major standing with Monsieur de
Bernis in the open under the stars before the tent which had been
provided for him, was suddenly moved to ask him what provision he
had made for sleeping-quarters for himself. There was a moment's
pause before the Frenchman answered him.</p>
<p>'It follows naturally, sir, that I share those prepared for my
wife.'</p>
<p>The Major made a gurgling noise in his throat, as he swung to
confront the Frenchman squarely.</p>
<p>'What security do you imagine the lady would enjoy if it were
shown that she is not my wife? You have eyes, I suppose; and you
saw the way Tom Leach looked at her when he came smirking round her
here this evening with his loathsome affability.'</p>
<p>The Major tugged at his neck-cloth. He felt as if he were
choking.</p>
<p>'God's death!' he got out at last, in a voice thick with
passion. 'And what, pray, is there to choose between Tom Leach and
you?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis sucked in his breath quite audibly. His face
showed white in the gloom. 'Runs your mind so?' he said at last.
'But what a poor, lame mind it is with which to run at conclusions!
I wonder whither it will bear you in the end.' He uttered a short
laugh. 'If I were what you are supposing, if my aims were such as
you flatter me by deeming them, your carcase, my dear Bartholomew,
would by now be feeding the crayfish in that lagoon. Let the
thought give you assurance of my honesty. Good night!'</p>
<p>He was turning away when the Major caught him by the sleeve.</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon, de Bernis. Stab me! I should have seen that
without being told.' Convinced by the other's clear argument, it
was out of the depth of his relief that contrition rose. 'I've done
you a monstrous wrong, damme! I admit it frankly.'</p>
<p>'Pshaw!' said de Bernis, and he moved off.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla's hut had not been supplied with a door, this
being deemed unnecessary. In its place, and to act as a curtain,
Pierre had hung across the entrance a heavy rug which entirely
screened the interior. From between the logs composing the walls
the light was still gleaming when presently de Bernis approached
it, having left his doublet with Pierre and carrying now a cloak
and a pillow which his servant had given him.</p>
<p>He went down on one knee before the entrance, to dig a hole in
the fine sand.</p>
<p>'Who is there?' came Priscilla's voice from beyond the
curtaining rug.</p>
<p>'It is I,' de Bernis answered. 'You have no cause for alarm. I
shall be on guard. Sleep in peace.'</p>
<p>There was no answer from within.</p>
<p>De Bernis completed his digging. Then, wrapping himself in the
cloak, he lay down fitting his hip into the hole, and disposing
himself to slumber.</p>
<p>In the distance, at the other end of the beach, the fires over
which the buccaneers had done their cooking were dying down. The
noise of their voices had ceased, and all was quiet in their
encampment. The moon, almost a half-disc by now, came up and the
lagoon became a quivering sheet of quicksilver. The silken rustle
of the incoming tide as its wavelets broke upon the fine sand was
presently the only sound upon the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>But all were not asleep. A corner of the curtain masking the
entrance of the hut, in which the light had been extinguished, was
slowly, noiselessly, raised, and the faint moonlight beat down upon
the white face of Priscilla.</p>
<p>Cautiously she looked out, and almost at once her eyes fell upon
the long dark form of Monsieur de Bernis, stretched there at her
very feet, with the deep, regular breathing of sleep.</p>
<p>Not at once was her head withdrawn. For some moments it remained
visible as she pondered this sleeper, who made of his body a
barrier for her protection. Then, very quietly the curtain fell
again, and within the hut Priscilla sought her couch, and delivered
herself up to slumber in the peaceful conviction that she was well
guarded.</p>
<p>She was guarded more completely even than she knew. For in his
tent a dozen yards away, Major Sands, disdaining to use the hammock
provided for him, lay prone upon the sand, his head in shadow, but
near the entrance of the tent, whence, himself sleepless, he could
watch the sleeping custodian of the lady whom he had chosen for his
wife. From which it would seem that the conviction which
momentarily had moved the Major into penitence had been thrust out
by the doubts that will beset a man in his circumstances.</p>
<p>Next day the Major paid the price of that unnecessary
pernoctation. The morning found him blear-eyed, morose, and sullen.
In the afternoon, he slept, partly because he could no longer
combat drowsiness, partly because he realized the necessity of
fortifying himself against another night of vigilance.</p>
<p>But after a second night of it, with a still drowsier day to
follow, and an aching head which the heat, suddenly grown intense,
rendered almost intolerable, the Major realized that this state of
things could not continue. Whatever the Frenchman might be, the
honesty of his intentions towards Miss Priscilla might now be
considered tested. Besides, when all was said, the Major was within
easy call, less than a dozen yards away, and he could trust himself
not to sleep through an outcry.</p>
<p>And now followed arduous days for the buccaneers, hard-driven by
Leach to the work awaiting them upon the hull of the careened ship.
But drive them as he might, the heat retarded the operations, and
despite the many hands at his command, only a comparative few could
be employed at once in the task of burning off the barnacles and
weeds. From sunrise until a little before noon, the men worked
willingly enough. But when they had dined, they insisted upon
sleeping, and let Leach storm and rant as he chose, they would not
raise a finger during those torrid afternoons in which the sun beat
down so pitilessly, and never a breath of wind came to temper the
appalling heat.</p>
<p>In this they received a measure of encouragement from the
attitude adopted by de Bernis. He was going freely amongst them
here ashore, as he had done aboard the <i>Centaur</i>. He would
saunter over to the encampment during the afternoon idleness, to
laugh and joke with them, to regale them with stories of past deeds
upon the Main in which he had borne a part, and, more often now, to
fire their fancy on the score of the Spanish gold to which he was
to lead them.</p>
<p>It was well for him, perhaps, that Major Sands did not hear him
then, or he would have borne reports to Priscilla which must have
destroyed her growing trust and confidence in de Bernis.</p>
<p>He painted word pictures for the men calculated to fire the
gross appetites which he knew to be theirs, appetites which soon
now they would have the means to glut. He thrilled them with the
anticipation of the coarse delights which so much wealth would buy.
They listened avidly in lawless, lewd anticipations he excited, and
laughed with the unholy glee of the monstrous wicked, lawless
children that they were at heart. It might be cruel to toil in this
furnace, but soon there would be a golden unguent for their
blistered backs. And, after all, they could take things easily.
There was plenty of time before them. The plate fleet would not be
putting to sea for another three weeks or so, and here at the
Albuquerques they were within little more than a day's sailing of
the spot where it was to be intercepted.</p>
<p>In this manner de Bernis intoxicated them with the prospect of
the wealth that would be coming to each of them, and kept it
clearly before the eyes of their minds that it was he, and nobody
but he, would lead them to it.</p>
<p>Tom Leach, coming to learn that it was largely as a result of
the statements made by de Bernis that he found the men mutinously
opposed to work during the heat of the day, came raging to him on
the subject.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was not perturbed; he was airily platitudinous
with proverbs about going surely by going slowly. He exasperated
Leach by the opinion that there was plenty of time before them.</p>
<p>'Plenty o' time, ye daft loon? Time for what?'</p>
<p>'Before the plate fleet sails.'</p>
<p>'Damn the plate fleet!' swore Leach. 'Be that th' only fleet
afloat? What of others as goes up and down the seas?'</p>
<p>'I see. You're afraid of being found here? Pshaw! You want to
laugh, my friend. Be at ease. No ship is likely to come prowling
into this cove.'</p>
<p>'Mebbe not. But if any did? What then, eh? Does thee think as
I's comfortable here wi' ship high and dry, all helpless like?
Plenty o' time, says you! Hell, man! I want to be on my keel again
without no loss o' time. So I'll trouble thee not to go putting
thee daft notions into folks' heads.'</p>
<p>De Bemis gave the required promise so as to pacify him. He gave
it the more readily because the mischief was already done.
Dilatoriness in that tropic heat accorded too well with the men's
natural inclinations not to be indulged now that they had de
Bernis' authoritative assertion that there was no need for any
sweltering urgency.</p>
<p>Apart from that minor explosion from Leach, the first ten days
on Maldita passed peacefully enough. By the end of that time, the
burning and scraping on the hull was ended, and the carpenters
could now get to work at caulking the seams, skilled labour this,
which left the main body of the hands idle until they should
presently come to the tarring and finally the greasing of the
keel.</p>
<p>It was a time that naturally hung heavily upon the hands of
Major Sands and Miss Priscilla, and more heavily perhaps on the
soldier's than on the lady's. The Major, feeling the heat acutely
as a result of his fleshly habit of body, waited in a condition of
more or less complete inertness for the passage of time to bring
him deliverance. The result of this was that his temper, naturally
inclining to irascibility and querulousness, did not improve or
dispose him to optimism concerning the future. Miss Priscilla,
however, contrived to find for herself some occupation. She busied
herself with Pierre in the preparation and cooking of food. She
went out onto the reef with him, when he went fishing, and herself
joined and found entertainment in the sport. Or she would go for
excursions with him into the woods, in quest of yams and plantains,
and once she crossed the island with him to its western side by a
path which the half-caste had found over a long bald strip of
ground reached within four or five hundred yards of the beach; a
strip which thenceforward clove the dense jungle like an avenue,
where only a thin layer of soil covered the rock, and, ascending
towards the island's middle, sloped thence to the western shore,
giving a backbone to Maldita.</p>
<p>Nor did she always take an escort on her excursions. In the
early days on the island, she had wandered away by herself,
climbing the reef and following the beach beyond it. Along this she
had come upon a barrier of rock that rose like a wall some eight or
nine feet high to bar her progress. Yet not to be so easily
defeated, she had climbed the shallow bluff which rose here above
the beach. From the summit, crowned with palms, with arnotto roses
and scarlet hibiscus clustering about the boles, she had looked
down into a little rockbound cove and a limpid, sheltered pool
within the embrace of it.</p>
<p>She must have come at least a mile from the encampment. She was
quite alone; none ever came this way; and there was no remotest
danger of surprise. So she yielded to the cool invitation of that
pool, descended from the bluff, shed her light clothing on the sand
where an overhanging rock made a sheltering canopy, and dived into
the crystalline depths.</p>
<p>She came forth not only refreshed and invigorated, but
enheartened by the discovery she had made. Under the friendly rock
where her clothing lay, a rock which whilst giving shade was itself
still hot from the passage of the sun, she let her body dry in the
warm air, then resumed her garments, and made her way back to the
encampment. Daily thereafter in the middle of the morning she would
disappear unostentatiously and alone. Making sure each time that
she was not followed, she went to visit the bathing-pool of her
discovery.</p>
<p>The disgruntled Major observing her comings and goings, or
listening to her light chatter with Pierre when she was at work
with him, or with de Bernis when he came to take his meals in the
hut, marvelled that she could endure this state of things with so
little apparent heaviness of heart. At moments he would ask himself
whether such equanimity in adversity were not the result of an
utter insensibility, an utter failure to apprehend the dangers by
which she was surrounded and by which the Major was oppressed on
her behalf. She could even laugh and at moments approach the
borders of pertness with Tom Leach on those occasions, and they
were none so rare, when he walked the length of the beach to pay
them a visit.</p>
<p>If Monsieur de Bernis was not always there on these occasions,
he had an uncanny trick of appearing suddenly amongst them, which
the Major thought was just as well, for it saved him from the
necessity of joining the conversation with that hawk-faced
blackguard. He would sit sullenly by when Leach was with them, and
if the pirate addressed him, as he occasionally did, the Major
would answer gruffly in monosyllables, outraged in the soul of him
that prudence should place him under the necessity of being even
civil to such a scoundrel.</p>
<p>It was perhaps fortunate for him that Leach repaid contempt with
contempt, regarding the Major as a negligible flabbiness without
justification to existence save in the fact that he was brother to
the delectable Madame de Bernis; though how this should happen,
Leach could not begin to imagine. There was, he perceived, little
resemblance to be traced between them. He startled them one day by
saying so, adding, however, with heavy jocularity, that this was
something for which the lady should daily give thanks to her
Maker.</p>
<p>He made no attempt to dissemble his admiration for her, even
when de Bernis was at hand. Nor did he confine himself to clumsy
compliments. His attentions would take the shape now of a few
bottles of Peruvian wine, now of a box of guava cheese, or of
almonds preserved in sugar, or some other delicacy from the landed
stores of the <i>Black Swan</i>.</p>
<p>To Major Sands these attentions were infuriating, but not so
infuriating as the apparent complacency with which Priscilla
received them; for he lacked the wit to perceive the prudence which
dictated her attitude towards the pirate. As for Monsieur de
Bernis, he would lounge there at his ease, in the main indifferent
and languid, but ever and anon pointedly asserting his position as
a husband, and sometimes interposing it suddenly as a barrier when
Leach's attentions approached the borders of excessiveness.</p>
<p>And Leach, thus checked, would turn upon him with the beginnings
of a snarl, like that of a dog which sees a bone being snatched
away from it. But under the languid, narrowed eyes of the long,
saturnine Frenchman, the snarl would become a smile, half-mocking,
half-cringing.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>Chapter 12. The Guardian</h2>
<p>The infatuation of Tom Leach for the supposed Madame de
Bernis--to employ a euphemistic indication of the emotions astir in
his wild breast--became apparent to his officers. It was being
treated by them with indifference, as merely a subject for lewd
jests, until the shrewd-sighted Bundry pointed out the
disadvantages that might result from it.</p>
<p>Alarmed by his cold reasoning, they improvised a council of war
in the matter one day after dinner when the four of them were
assembled with Leach in their hut.</p>
<p>Bundry was their spokesman, chosen because as fearless as he was
passionless, he was the only one amongst them who dared to beard on
so delicate a matter the violent Captain. The scarring by smallpox
of his clay-coloured face had reduced it to a mask-like
expressionlessness, which in itself made men apprehensive of him,
for save in the twist of his lips or the gleam of his eyes, and
this only when he so chose, he gave no indication of what might be
passing in his mind. He had a clammy, chill, almost reptilian air,
seeming utterly emotionless and as impervious to physical as to
spiritual heat. In speech he was deliberate and precise, and he
dressed his powerful stocky figure with a sober neatness, retained
from the days when he had been a Captain of merchantmen.</p>
<p>In that cold, deliberate voice of his and with that cold,
deliberate manner he plainly and succinctly laid before the Captain
their disapproval of the course his conduct appeared to be
steering.</p>
<p>Leach flung into a hideous passion, roaring and snarling and
threatening to rip the bowels out of any man who stood between him
and his desires whatever they might be.</p>
<p>Wogan, Halliwell, and Ellis sat cowed under his ranting
violence, beginning to regret that they should have brought up the
subject.</p>
<p>But Bundry fixed him coldly with an eye as expressionless as a
snake's, in the depths of which there dwelt perhaps some of that
mesmeric power attributed to the colubrine gaze.</p>
<p>'Breathe your lungs, Captain. Breathe 'em freely. It may let out
some o' the heat in ye. When ye're cooler, maybe ye'll listen to
reason.'</p>
<p>'Reason? Damn reason!'</p>
<p>'That's what ye're doing,' said Bundry.</p>
<p>'Doing what?'</p>
<p>'Damning reason. And reason, I've noticed, ends by damning him
that damns it. That's what'll happen to you, Captain, unless ye
shorten sail.'</p>
<p>To Leach this sounded like a threat. If it did not diminish his
wrath, at least it abated his noise. He sat down again, and
considered the pallid, almost sinister face before him with a
malevolent glance.</p>
<p>'I's able enough to mind my own affairs, and I's not letting
anyone else mind them for me. Understand that?'</p>
<p>'If it was a matter of your own affairs only,' said the
phlegmatic Bundry, 'we'ld let you run aground, and be damned to
you, Tom. But it happens also to be the affair of all of us. We're
all in this bottom together, and we're not going to let any folly
o' yours sink the ship before we've cast anchor in the golden
harbour o' that Spanish treasure.'</p>
<p>'So it's by your leaves I move now, is it? It's what you'll let
me do I must be minding, eh? By God, I wonder I don't pistol thee
where thee sits, just to show who's master here.' He ran his wicked
eyes over the others. 'And ye're all o' the same mind, I see,' he
jeered at them.</p>
<p>It was Halliwell who nerved himself to answer. He slewed his
corpulence forward on his chair, and leaned a massive arm on the
table.</p>
<p>'Ye got to listen to reason, Cap'n. D'ye suppose Topgallant
Charley don't notice what we're all noticing. And d'ye suppose he's
the man to play tricks with? As dangerous a fellow under his
pimpish clothes and cuckoldy fine manners as ever sailed the seas,
and as ye should know, Tom.'</p>
<p>'Ah, bah! He's smooth enough wi' me. He dursn't be aught
else.'</p>
<p>'Och, now, don't be deceiving yourself, Captain, darling,' flung
in Wogan. 'Smooth he is, to be sure. But it's the smoothness of
steel, not of velvet.'</p>
<p>'Why, ye poor gabies, he has a windpipe, I suppose.'</p>
<p>'What, then?' snapped Bundry, his voice harsh and dry.</p>
<p>'It'll slit as easily as another's. And that's what'll happen to
it if Charley gets spry wi' me.'</p>
<p>'That,' said Bundry, 'is just what mustn't happen to it. He
comes to us with the chance and secret of a fortune, and that's not
to be put in jeopardy by any love-sick humours o' yours, Tom. Ye'd
best remember it, and leave that woman of his alone.'</p>
<p>'And that's the fact,' said the fiery-faced Ellis. 'Until the
treasure's under our hatches, ye'll have to curb your humours,
Captain.'</p>
<p>'After that,' said Wogan to conciliate him, 'sure there's no
one'll keep the doxy from you if you want her. It's only a little
patience we're after asking of ye, Captain.'</p>
<p>Wogan laughed on that, and Ellis and Halliwell laughed with him,
loud and heartily, thus breaking the restraint that had been
growing there, and drawing, at last, an answering wicked smile from
Leach.</p>
<p>But Bundry did not laugh. He was as rarely moved to laughter as
to the display of any other emotion. His countenance remained a
mask, his eyes--eyes that looked unnaturally black against the grey
pallor of his seared face--riveting the Captain with that
snake-like gaze, a queer, cold, compelling menace. This he
maintained until with a jeer, representing it as a concession to
their weak stomachs, Leach growled a contemptuous acquiescence in
the circumspect course they thrust upon him.</p>
<p>The better to keep to his undertaking, the Captain did not that
afternoon pay his usual visit to de Bernis' hut. When the next day
came and went without his having crossed the brook which supplied a
natural boundary to the buccaneer encampment, Priscilla ventured a
comment upon it. She hoped that she might congratulate herself upon
the Captain's abandonment of a habit which was as unpleasant as any
experience that had yet been hers.</p>
<p>They had supped, and they were sitting in the little green bay
before the hut, glad to breathe the cooling air of sunset. Neither
of the men offered any comment upon Miss Priscilla's thanksgiving.
A little spell of silence followed. But it appeared from the
question presently asked by the Major that her words had touched
off a train of thought in his mind. He turned to de Bernis, who sat
on the lady's other side. The tone of this sorely tried man was
querulous.</p>
<p>'Will you tell me, sir--it has long been in my mind to ask
you--what you intend by us when you sail away on your thieving
cruise against this Spanish fleet?'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla frowned slightly in displeasure at the Major's
tone and at the ruffling terms in which he chose to express
himself.</p>
<p>As for Monsieur de Bernis, he seemed for once utterly taken
aback by the soldier's question. It was a long moment before he
commanded himself and smiled his queer, slow smile. Then he spoke,
but to evade, rather than to answer.</p>
<p>'Ah, Major! Are you very brave, I wonder; or just very
stupid?'</p>
<p>'Sink me, sir!' spluttered the Major. 'I'll trouble you to
explain yourself.'</p>
<p>'I mean, that sometimes you baffle me by the fanfaronade behind
your foolish words.'</p>
<p>It took the Major a moment to recover his breath. 'Sir,' he
said, 'I'll not take that from any man.'</p>
<p>'Indeed? You possess, then, the sole right to be provocative? A
dangerous privilege. Especially here.' He rose to his feet, but
lazily, half-stretching himself. 'I have already pointed out to
you, my dear Bartholomew, that your preservation is the strongest
proof you could possess of my good faith. But you should not abuse
it.'</p>
<p>'Abuse it, sir?' The Major got up fuming, shaking off the
restraining hand that the lady placed upon his arm. 'I asked you a
plain question, and one to which both Miss Priscilla and I have the
right, or so it seems to me, to an answer.'</p>
<p>'You asked it,' de Bernis answered him composedly, 'in uncivil
and aggressive terms.'</p>
<p>'I call things by their proper names. By their proper names,
blister me!'</p>
<p>De Bernis looked him over. 'Well, well! Be thankful that I don't
return the compliment.'</p>
<p>He bowed in leave-taking to Miss Priscilla, put on his plumed
hat, and sauntered off in the direction of the buccaneer
encampment.</p>
<p>By the time the Major had recovered, de Bernis was twenty yards
away. Even then he might have gone after him but for Miss
Priscilla's almost stern command to him to sit down. He obeyed her
mechanically, exploding as he did so.</p>
<p>'It's not be borne. Stab me! I'll not endure his insolence.'</p>
<p>'Why do you provoke it?' Miss Priscilla's cool voice asked him.
'Why not practise courtesy with him? Or don't you think that we owe
him enough to warrant it?'</p>
<p>Her sarcasm added fuel to his anger. 'You defend the knave! It
is all that was wanting. You defend him, and against me. Me! In
God's name, ma'am, what is he to you, this swaggering pirate
hound?'</p>
<p>But Miss Priscilla remained as cool as if she had taken de
Bernis for her model in deportment.</p>
<p>'That is not at all the question. The question is what he may be
to you if you spare no pains to offend him. He has already made
clear to you what should have been plain: that if he were indeed
what you insist upon supposing him, he would already have disposed
of your inconvenient and ungracious person.'</p>
<p>'Fan me, ye winds!' cried Major Sands, and stamped off before he
should utter in the presence of a lady that which a gentleman might
afterwards regret.</p>
<p>He found her utterly exasperating. The question that he had
asked de Bernis was one that concerned her very closely. Life and
death and even more might be involved in it; and yet, as if she did
not understand the gravity of the case, she was attaching
importance only to his manner, as if that were of any consequence
where the matter was so perilous.</p>
<p>But in this the Major did her a serious injustice. She had
certainly attached importance to his manner, and she censured it,
because she realized the futility of alienating, perhaps
exasperating, Monsieur de Bernis, upon whose good-will they
depended so entirely, a good-will in which her belief was something
more than instinctive. At the same time she had perceived not only
the importance of the question asked by Major Sands, but also
Monsieur de Bernis' evasion of it; and she was left wondering
whether this evasion were simply the result of an irritation caused
by the tactless tone the Major adopted, or whether there might be a
deeper reason for it. Anxieties which had grown dormant lately, in
this peaceful interlude, reawakened in her. She sought to allay
them.</p>
<p>That night whilst de Bernis was sleeping at his post before the
curtain of her hut, a hand descended gently upon his shoulder.
Light as the touch was, he awakened so instantly that it was plain
some part of his senses remained on guard even whilst he slept. In
the instantaneous act of sitting up, he flung wide the cloak in
which he was wrapped, and the moonlight gleamed lividly upon a
naked blade. He slept with his drawn sword beside him.</p>
<p>He found Miss Priscilla leaning over him, vaguely visible, a
finger to her lips. He looked round swiftly in quest of what might
have alarmed her. But all was still; the soft thud and rustle of
the tide upon the beach and the resonant snores from the Major's
tent were the only sounds upon the stillness of the night. 'What is
it?' he softly asked, one leg already drawn under him to bring him
to his feet.</p>
<p>A sibilant 'Hush!' reassured him. His muscles, gathered for the
spring, relaxed. 'I want to talk to you, Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>'At your service,' said he.</p>
<p>He changed his position, so as to come to sit with his back to
the hut, and she sat down beside him. It was a moment or two before
she found opening words.</p>
<p>'Bart asked you a question today. You did not answer it. The
terms he chose may be to blame. Naturally they offended you.'</p>
<p>'Ah, no,' he answered softly, subduing his voice to the pitch of
her own. 'If a man is an oaf he offends himself, not me.'</p>
<p>She began to explain the Major, to make excuses for him, to
account for his peremptoriness on the ground partly of the ways of
life he had trodden, partly of the anxieties which were racking him
on her behalf.</p>
<p>'This is not necessary, Miss Priscilla,' he presently
interrupted her. 'I am not seriously perturbed; in fact, I am not
perturbed at all. "Prevail by patience," is the motto of my house,
and I have taken it for the guiding maxim of my life. I am not a
man of senseless rages and swift fury, I do assure you.'</p>
<p>'There is not the need to assure me,' said she. 'I had observed
it.'</p>
<p>She observed also now the oddness of this situation in which she
found herself, and the oddness of hearing a man who had lived by
lawlessness and who even now was a self-confessed pirate planning a
raid upon a Spanish fleet, speaking demurely of his house and its
lofty motto. The oddness lay in that whilst glaringly incongruous
it seemed to hold no incongruity.</p>
<p>She did not, however, dwell upon the thought. She had sought him
here for a definite purpose, and this purpose she now pursued.</p>
<p>'You did not answer Bart's question,' she said again. 'It
concerned, you'll remember, your intentions for us when you depart
with these men upon this raid. Will you give me the answer
now?'</p>
<p>That answer came after a thoughtful pause.</p>
<p>'I wait upon events.'</p>
<p>'Yet you must have some plan in mind, some project,' she pressed
him. And after another pause in which he did not reply, she added
softly: 'Hitherto I have completely trusted you. It is in this that
I have found such peace as is possible in these conditions.'</p>
<p>'And now you trust me no longer.'</p>
<p>'Oh, not that. I should be in despair if that were so. But
you'll understand my anxieties even if I have spared you the
display of them.'</p>
<p>'You have been very brave in that. Oh, but singularly brave.'
There was admiration approaching reverence in his tone. 'Your
courage has helped me more than you suppose. Continue by it to help
me, you will be helping me to help you.'</p>
<p>'Yet you will tell me nothing of your intentions? The knowledge
would be a strength to me.'</p>
<p>'I have said that I wait upon events. But this I'll add: I
firmly and honestly believe that you have no cause for any
apprehension. It is my belief that I shall bring you safely
through. I swear to do so if I live.'</p>
<p>'If you live!'</p>
<p>In the gloom he heard the catch in her breath, the sudden
tremulousness of her tone. He made haste to reassure her. 'I should
not have added that. It is idle to introduce a fresh doubt of your
fate among all the anxieties troubling you.' And with a firm
confidence he added: 'I shall live. Don't doubt it.'</p>
<p>'A fresh doubt of my fate!' she echoed. A half-laugh escaped
her. 'How meanly you think of me!'</p>
<p>'Meanly?' he cried, his accent a protest. He did not understand.
Nor did she enlighten him, although her next question was concerned
with his preservation.</p>
<p>'Can you trust these men to keep faith with you? When the
Spanish fleet is taken?'</p>
<p>He laughed softly. 'I am sure that I cannot. Once there was
honour among buccaneers. But today...And this beast Leach! He knows
as much of honour as of mercy or of decency. Oh, no. They have no
intention to keep faith with me.'</p>
<p>Alarm and bewilderment robbed her of breath. 'But then? If that
is so, what hope have you?'</p>
<p>'The hope of prevailing by my wits. A very confident hope.
Opportunity will present itself. It always does; but we do not
always recognize it unless we are watching for it. And I am
watching. Dismiss your alarms, madam. Only an extraordinary
malignity of Fortune could thwart me. And Fortune surely could
never be malign to you.'</p>
<p>'You will tell me nothing more?'</p>
<p>'At present there is nothing more to tell. But again I bid you
to have faith in me, and to be confident that I shall bring you
through unharmed.'</p>
<p>She was silent awhile. Then she sighed. 'Very well,' she
breathed. 'Good night, Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>Long after she had gone, he still sat there, thoughtful, where
she had left him. His mind was busy with a problem, seeking the
explanation of her outcry: 'How meanly you think of me!' Unless she
meant that he thought meanly of her in thinking that her concern
for his life was grounded solely in concern for her own, what else
could she mean? And how could she possibly mean that?</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>Chapter 13. Lacrimae Rerum</h2>
<p>On the following morning, whilst Major Sands was sulking, like
Achilles, in his tent, a shadow fell across the entrance, and
Monsieur de Bernis stood before him in black silhouette against the
sunlight. He carried his sheathed rapier tucked under his arm.</p>
<p>'I have observed, Major, that you grow too fat,' was the
greeting with which he startled the soldier. 'You need to sweat a
little, and to stretch your limbs. It will mend your humours. Take
up your sword, and come with me.'</p>
<p>The Major, remembering the sharp words that had passed between
them yesterday, conceived in this a derisory invitation to an
adjustment of their differences. He got to his feet, with quickened
breath and deepening colour.</p>
<p>'Blister me, sir! D'ye seek to put a quarrel on me? Have ye
thought what will happen if I kill you?'</p>
<p>'I never build conjectures on the impossible.'</p>
<p>'By God, sir, your insolence is not to be borne! Not to be
borne!' He snatched up sword and sword-belt. 'Have with you, then,
whatever the consequences.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis sighed. 'Always will you be misunderstanding
me. I propose exercise, and you talk of killing.'</p>
<p>'Whatever you propose, I am your man, stab me.' They went out
together, the Major breathing gustily, de Bernis calm, and
apparently amused.</p>
<p>Their departure was unwitnessed by Miss Priscilla, and so that
it should go unperceived by others, de Bernis penetrated the woods
for some little distance; then, under cover of the trees, led the
way along a line parallel with the shore.</p>
<p>They went in silence until the Major, suspecting that they were
being followed, halted to look behind him.</p>
<p>'It is only Pierre,' said de Bernis, without looking round. 'He
comes to see that we are not interrupted.'</p>
<p>The Major plunged on, mystified, indignant, yet with no thought
of avoiding an encounter upon which the other appeared determined,
whatever might be the consequences. He panted up the rising ground
that ran inwards from the bluff, and was bathed in perspiration by
the time de Bernis had brought him out onto the little beach beyond
it, and screened by it from the encampment of the buccaneers. On
the summit of the bluff the Major saw now the figure of Pierre, and
understood that he was posted there on guard.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis removed his baldrick and drew his sword. The
Major copied him in silence. Then from his pocket the Frenchman
took a piece of wood that was shaped like a tiny pear, with a slot
opened at its apex. Into this slot, under the Major's bulging,
uncomprehending eyes, he fitted the point of his sword, then tapped
down the little wooden pear securely with a stone which he picked
up from the beach.</p>
<p>'What the devil's this?' quoth the Major.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis brought forth a second wooden object like the
first and proffered it.</p>
<p>'Did you suppose I brought you on a blood-letting? Our situation
will hardly admit of it, whatever may be your feelings. I told you
you need to breathe your lungs, and stretch your limbs, and sweat a
little.'</p>
<p>But now the Major, who was already sweating freely and at every
pore, and who conceived himself mocked, flung into a real
passion.</p>
<p>'What the devil do you mean, sir? D'ye rally me? D'ye practise
jests upon me?'</p>
<p>'Oh, but a little calm,' the other begged. 'The need for
bloodletting may yet be thrust upon us. We rust for lack of
practice. I do, if you do not, Major. That is all.' And more
insistently he proffered the wooden pear again.</p>
<p>Between doubt and understanding the Major slowly took the
object.</p>
<p>'I see,' he said, which was an obvious overstatement. 'It is for
practice that you bring me here?' And he grumbled: 'You should have
made it plainer.'</p>
<p>'Could I suppose that it was not plain?' De Bernis was beginning
to remove his doublet.</p>
<p>The Major was glad enough to copy him in this. Then, as the
thought of what they came to do grew upon him, a certain grim
satisfaction grew with it. He had notions of himself as a
swordsman. In younger days, at home, he had been the deadliest
blade of his regiment. He would show this Frenchman something that
would let him see that Major Sands was not a man with whom it was
prudent to take liberties.</p>
<p>At last, stripped to the waist, they faced each other and came
on guard.</p>
<p>The Major intent upon a brave display, attacked at once and
fiercely. But whether he thrust or lunged, he remained always
outside the guard of an opponent, who never once broke ground,
however pressed. Notwithstanding this, the Frenchman remained so
strictly upon the defensive as to leave the Major under the
delusion that the ardour of his attack was so constraining his
opponent. Thus until he found himself sharply admonished.</p>
<p>'More speed, Major. More speed, I beg. Press harder. You are
giving me nothing to do.'</p>
<p>Goaded by what seemed a taunt, Major Sands momentarily increased
the ferocity of his onslaught. But it spent itself idly against
that guard, which, so swift, seemed yet so effortless.</p>
<p>Winded by his supreme exertion, the Major fell back to breathe,
and lowered his point. The sweat ran from his cropped head--for
they had removed their periwigs together with their upper garments.
He dashed it from his brow with the back of his hand, and glared at
the tall, lithe Frenchman, who remained so cool and whose breathing
scarcely appeared to have quickened. Of what was the man made, that
neither heat nor movement could leave an impression upon him?</p>
<p>He smiled into the Major's flushed, choleric face. 'You realize
how urgent was your need to exercise yourself. I was right, you
see. You are in even worse case than I. Lack of practice has made
you slow.'</p>
<p>Sullenly the Major admitted it. And he knew it to be true. But
he also began to suspect that at his speediest and best he would
never have got past that guard, and the suspicion left his spirit
wounded and resentful.</p>
<p>Presently when he had regained his breath they resumed. But now
de Bernis' tactics were quite different. Again the Major opened by
attacking. But this time, in meeting a low thrust with a
counter-parry which restored the blades to the line of the original
engagement, the Frenchman straightened his arm in a riposte that
made the Major jump backwards so as to avoid the point.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis laughed. 'Too much effort,' he criticized.
'Play closer, Major. Keep the elbow nearer to your flank.' He went
in to engage him, deflected a thrust intended to stop him, extended
himself in a lunge, and hit the Major full upon the stomach.</p>
<p>They fell on guard again, and again, with the same ease de
Bernis touched him. After that a series of swift disengages reduced
the Major to utter impotency, at the culmination of which de Bernis
inside his guard touched him upon his defenceless breast with the
utmost deliberation.</p>
<p>'Assez,' he said, straightening himself. His own breath was
coming more quickly now. 'For today, it is enough. I am less rusty
than I feared. But not as keen as I should be; as I may need to be.
Tomorrow we will try again, as much for your sake as for mine,
Major. In your present condition I should tremble for you if you
were opposed to a swordsman of any force at all.'</p>
<p>The Major was trembling for himself; trembling with suppressed
anger. He had the sense to perceive that the expression of it must
merely render him ridiculous. He sat down upon the beach to let his
overheated body cool before resuming his clothes whilst de Bernis,
divesting himself of what garments he still retained, plunged into
the sea to refresh himself.</p>
<p>They came back towards noon for dinner, with little said between
them, the Major's indignation still simmering. It was not merely
that he was under the humiliation of having been made to realize
that the swordsmanship he had imagined so expert was rendered
puerile by contrast with that of his opponent, but that he
nourished a strong suspicion that Monsieur de Bernis had
deliberately invited him to that passage at arms so as to
intimidate him with an exposition of what must happen to him if he
should permit acrimony seriously to embroil them.</p>
<p>By this conviction and the resentment springing from it, Major
Sands added to the contempt in which he already held de Bernis for
a thieving, cut-throat pirate, a further measure of contempt for
being a posturing mountebank.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, the indignation, which only their
circumstances compelled him to repress, was diminished, together
with that first impression of the Frenchman's motives, when on each
of the next three mornings he was invited and went to repeat that
practice in swordsmanship. Gradually he was brought to change his
view and to believe that, after all, de Bernis had no object to
serve beyond perfecting himself by practice against emergencies and
inducing the Major to do the same. In this growing conviction he
became more tolerant of the Frenchman's hints and criticisms, and
even began to seek to profit by them. But underneath it all a
certain resentment still remained at the manner which de Bernis had
adopted at the outset, and this prevented any softening of the
Major's deep-rooted dislike for him.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the growing friendliness between de Bernis and
Miss Priscilla contributed little or nothing to these feelings. The
easy and, in the Major's view, impudent familiarity of the
Frenchman's bearing towards her, and her own apparent lack of
resentment of this, was an irritation to him, it is true. But this
merely because he perceived it to spring from a less perfect
dignity on the part of Priscilla than he desired in the lady who
was destined one day to become his wife. Jealousy never even tinged
his emotions. It was too inconceivable that Miss Priscilla should
ever lose sight of the social abyss that separated her from such a
man as de Bernis.</p>
<p>He did not know--for he slept soundly now--that ever since that
first occasion when anxiety had urged her, it had become her
nightly habit, when all was still, to slip out of the tent, and to
sit and talk there with the guardian of her threshold. Possibly it
would not deeply have exercised him if he had known of it, provided
that he had known at the same time of what they talked. For
certainly these interviews were innocent of obvious tenderness.
Commonly they were concerned with the events of the day. Nor were
these always as trivial as might be supposed. One day, for
instance--it was a Saturday, their fourteenth day upon Maldita--a
riot had broken out among the buccaneers, which at one moment had
threatened to split them into two opposing factions. One of the men
had stabbed another, as a result of a quarrel over dice. Sides had
been taken, and anger spreading like wildfire amongst those lawless
men, a battle had begun to rage upon the beach.</p>
<p>Leach and his officers had flung themselves into the melee, and
with voice and fists had sought to quell the riot. If they had not
completely succeeded in restoring peace, at least they had secured
an armistice, during which Leach might hear the facts and pronounce
upon them. But Leach had refused to do anything of the kind,
refused to listen to the pleas either of those who demanded the
life of the murderer, whose name was Shore, or of those who
asserted that the murdered man was to blame for having accused
Shore of cheating and smothered him in intolerable insult.</p>
<p>'It's no time to fall a-quarrelling among ourselves,' he had
told them. 'Keep your tempers and your knives for the Spaniards. No
more o' this now.'</p>
<p>But they surged angrily clamant about him. As their Captain it
was his place to pass judgement. Unless he did so they would,
themselves, do justice.</p>
<p>Leach's reluctance sprang from his perception that, however he
delivered himself, he would have to face the hostility of the party
opposed to his decision.</p>
<p>'There's a man dead,' he growled at them. 'Rot you in hell!
Isn't that enough?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, surging amongst them, no man knew whence,
was speaking, and they fell silent to hear what he might have to
say, the regard which he had known how to inspire in them asserting
itself.</p>
<p>'There's a simple way of resolving the dispute, Tom,' said
he.</p>
<p>'Ah! And what may that be?' Leach displayed no satisfaction at
this uninvited intervention.</p>
<p>'The only fit judges are those who were witnesses to the
quarrel.'</p>
<p>A roar approved him. When it had ceased, he continued:</p>
<p>'They are here, a full score of them. The dispute concerns none
else. Let them decide whether Shore is to be hanged or not. Let it
be decided on a show of hands, with the undertaking from the rest
that they'll abide by the decision.'</p>
<p>It was a way out that commended itself to Leach, for it
delivered him from the undesired responsibility. To his question
based on de Bernis' suggestion, they readily gave their assent to
abide by the decision of the majority, and by this they abode with
that queer loyalty to a contract which the buccaneers could
observe. The show of hands went against Shore. He was taken and
hanged forthwith, and peace was at once restored in the
encampment.</p>
<p>It was the mystery of this which Monsieur de Bernis expounded
that night to Miss Priscilla, who could not understand the
submissiveness of those who had so violently taken up the cudgels
on the murderer's behalf.</p>
<p>'It was not his life that had concerned them,' he explained.
'Life is cheap enough amongst them at all times. It was the
principle involved that mattered and over which they were
quarrelling. The vote offered an equitable solution, and they had
bound themselves to accept it.'</p>
<p>This led to questions from her and a lengthy dissertation from
him upon the bonds and engagements recognized and respected by even
the most lawless among buccaneers. Thus, since he was led into
delving into past experiences of his own, she drew him into
reminiscences which afforded her further glimpses of what his life
had been. For always was it of himself that she contrived to make
him talk.</p>
<p>One night--the seventeenth spent upon Maldita as he afterwards
remembered, the date being fixed in his memory by that which
happened on the morrow--she directly questioned him upon his
future. Was it his intention indefinitely to prolong this dangerous
roving life?</p>
<p>'Ah, that, no. Already you may account it closed. This business
upon which I am now embarked will certainly see the end. I am
troubled with nostalgy. It has been growing of late. It is quite
true that I told Morgan my only desire is to quit the Caribbean and
return home. At need I'll even change my religion, like Henry IV,
so that I may tread the blessed soil of France again, see the vines
and olives growing upon the hillside and hear the sweet accent of
the Toulousain.'</p>
<p>He spoke in a softened, wistful voice, ended on a sigh, and fell
silent, musing.</p>
<p>'I understand,' she said gently. 'But to change your religion?
The call of country must be strong.'</p>
<p>He considered that, and suddenly laughed, but muting his mirth
so as not to disturb the Major who slept in his tent a dozen yards
away.</p>
<p>'It is as if a naked man were to speak of changing his coat.
What hypocrites most of us are where faith is concerned. With the
life that lies behind me I can still dwell on mine, and speak of
changing it, as if some sacrifice were entailed.'</p>
<p>It was the first time that she had heard from him even an
implied disparagement of his past. Hitherto he had spoken of it
almost with complacency, as if piracy were a normal career, as if
he saw in it nothing at which to take shame.</p>
<p>'You are still young enough,' she said, answering that thought
of hers rather than his last words, 'to build anew.'</p>
<p>'But what shall I build me out of the materials I take with me
from the Old World? Every man, remember, builds his future from the
materials supplied him by his past.'</p>
<p>'Not entirely, surely. There are the materials he finds in his
path as he advances. These may suffice him. You will make a family
for yourself...'</p>
<p>He interrupted her at the very beginning of her picture of that
future.</p>
<p>'A family? I?'</p>
<p>'But why not, then?'</p>
<p>'Do you conclude that all that may once have been decent and
sound in me has been utterly stifled by the wild life I have
lived?'</p>
<p>'I know the contrary.'</p>
<p>'How do you know it?'</p>
<p>'I have the evidence of my senses. I know you. I have come to
know you a little, I think, in these few weeks. But what has that
to do with my question?'</p>
<p>'This. What sort of a mother am I to find for my children?'</p>
<p>'I don't understand. That surely is matter for your own
decision.'</p>
<p>'It is not. It has been decided for me. My past decides it.
Unless I am to woo in disguise, pretending myself something that I
am not. I have killed. I have plundered. I have done dreadful
things, unutterable things. I have even amassed some wealth. I own
lands, in Jamaica and elsewhere, with plantations and the like. My
proper mate among women would be some unfortunate soulless drab who
would be indifferent to the source of the money that will support
us. I am not so lost--lost though I may be--as to give such a
mother to my children. Nor yet am I so lost as to presume to woo
any woman of another kind. It is the only honesty remaining me; the
last frail link with honour. If that were to snap, then should I be
damned, indeed. No, no, sweet lady, whatever I may find to build in
the Old World if I reach it, certainly it will not be a
family.'</p>
<p>He had spoken with a deep, moving bitterness, different far from
his habitual manner which alternated between hardness and
flippancy, and commonly presented a blend of the two. A silence
followed, and endured for some time. It endured until something
light and moist dropped upon his left hand where it rested on his
knee.</p>
<p>Startled he turned to her, sitting so close to him and leaning a
little forward and sideways.</p>
<p>'Priscilla!' he breathed, tremulously, touched in his turn to
discover that he should so profoundly have moved her pity.</p>
<p>She rose swiftly, hastily, as if in confusion. 'Good night!' she
murmured in a small, quick voice. The heavy curtain rustled, and he
was alone.</p>
<p>But with his head turned to the entrance, he called softly after
her.</p>
<p>'I thank you for that tear dropped on the grave of a lost
soul.'</p>
<p>Then he bore that left hand of his to his lips, and held it
there.</p>
<p>Long afterwards, he was to confess that when he fell asleep that
night under the stars, it was with the feeling that some of the
vileness had been washed from him by a woman's compassionate
tear.</p>
<p>In the Toulousain a hundred and fifty years before there had
been a de Bernis who was a poet of some merit. I suspect that
something of his spirit survived in this buccaneering descendant of
his.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>Chapter 14. The Nymph and the
Satyr</h2>
<p>When Major Sands and Monsieur de Bernis came to break their fast
in the hut next morning, Miss Priscilla met de Bernis with a
complaint concerning Pierre.</p>
<p>This was the third morning in succession that the half-caste had
been absent when breakfast was to be prepared, with the result that
she had been alone in preparing it.</p>
<p>'He is nowhere to be seen. Each day he does not appear again
until close upon noon. What can he be doing? Where does he go?'</p>
<p>'He is seeking yams, perhaps,' de Bernis replied casually.</p>
<p>'If so, he never seems to find any. Both yesterday and the day
before I saw him return, and he came empty-handed from the
woods.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps the yams are becoming scarce, and he is driven farther
afield in his search for them.'</p>
<p>His apparent indifference to his servant's evasion of duty
seemed curious to her, as he might have read in the glance with
which she searched his face.</p>
<p>'Could he not leave those quests until after we have broken our
fast?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps he likes to find the yams still moist with morning
dew.' At this absurdity her stare became more marked. 'I wonder why
you should jest about it.'</p>
<p>'In our situation there are so few things that lend themselves
for jesting that I may surely be forgiven if I neglect none of
these few But I will speak to Pierre. I will see what can be
arranged.'</p>
<p>This, she thought, was an oddly offhand way to treat the matter,
of slight importance though it might be. And to say no more in
conclusion than to promise to see what could be arranged, when a
simple word from him could remove the cause of her complaint,
seemed almost discourteously casual. She pressed the matter no
further; but a sense of annoyance remained with her.</p>
<p>Later in the course of the morning, the Major and the Frenchman
went off to their daily secret swordplay beyond the bluff.</p>
<p>Captain Leach was strolling alone at the time on the damp firm
sands at the very edge of the receding tide, a vivid figure in his
scarlet suit. Impatient to be afloat again, and so safe from
surprise, he came from urging the men in the completion of the
work; for now that the tarring of the hull was finished, only the
greasing remained to be done, and in three days, or four at the
most, the <i>Black Swan</i> should be ready for launching
again.</p>
<p>From where he paced he saw the two men move away from their
sequestered little camp and disappear into the woods. He had
already observed these morning absences of theirs, and he halted,
wondering vaguely whither they went. When his attention was
attracted by the green-clad figure of Priscilla Harradine coming
forth from her hut. From the distance he watched that trim,
graceful shape with eyes of kindling admiration. He watched her
turn to the right, and set out briskly, like one who was guided by
a definite purpose. She proceeded for some little way along the
summit of the beach, then she, too, vanished into the wood.</p>
<p>From wondering whither she might be going so unfalteringly and
definitely, he reached almost at once the desire to ascertain.
Resentment of the barrier raised against his attentions to the lady
had never ceased to smoulder in him; and it was accompanied by a
growing impatience for the time when, the business of the Spanish
plate fleet being concluded, this barrier would definitely be
removed. It had not often happened to Tom Leach to be under the
necessity of restraining his lusts, and he remained unschooled as a
savage in the art of it. Also, as is the way of unruly,
undisciplined men, he must ever be preferring that which lay under
his hand at the moment to the greater things that might be achieved
by planning and waiting. It is an indication of his rudimentary
intelligence.</p>
<p>It is doubtful, therefore, whether in obeying now the unreasoned
instinct to follow her, he was prompted only by curiosity on the
score of her movements.</p>
<p>In long, swift strides he crossed the beach diagonally, straight
to the palm tree with the arnotto roses clustering about its stem
by which he had marked the spot at which she had vanished into the
wood. Once, himself under the shelter of the trees, he had little
difficulty in picking up her trail. It was plainly marked in the
undergrowth, thinner on the edges of this jungle than in the depths
of it.</p>
<p>Cautiously, unhurried, but purposefully now as a hound upon a
spoor he followed. The trail led upwards over rising ground. At the
summit of this, the hard dry earth between the sparser palms was
almost bare, and the trail lost its distinctness; he quested there
for some moments, to be led eventually towards the open by signs
which might be those of someone's recent passage that way. But
having reached the edge of the bluff, he was entirely at fault. She
was nowhere to be seen. Below him, like a gigantic emerald set in a
vast cup of rock, he beheld a pool so clear that through its
smooth, unruffled surface he could see the fish moving in the
depths of it. Saving the unsuspected little platform under the
black canopy of rock immediately beneath him, he could survey not
merely the beach of this tiny cove, but long stretches of sand
beyond the barriers of rock on either side of it, and nowhere in
sight was Miss Priscilla.</p>
<p>He concluded that she must have continued through the wood, and
went back to endeavour to pick up the trail again. Ahead, where the
ground began gently to slope once more and the undergrowth
increased again, he saw signs that it had been trampled, and
cursing the time he had wasted, he was moving forward, when
suddenly a splash below, too loud to have been made by any leaping
fish, arrested him.</p>
<p>He turned. He saw wavelets moving outwards in widening circles,
from some point which the rock screened from his gaze, rippling the
mirror-like surface of the pool. A moment later, whilst he was
staring frowning inquiry, he saw that which made him catch his
breath, and instinctively drop upon hands and knees amongst the
trees so as to avoid, himself, being seen. A nymph of an incredible
whiteness was swimming out across the tiny lagoon. As beheld
through the water, her limbs seemed of marble.</p>
<p>Leach, so pale through his tan that his countenance seemed
almost green, feasted hot eyes upon that vision of incredible
loveliness. At one moment he made an animal noise, something
between a grunt and a groan, and held his nether lip thereafter
caught in his strong white teeth.</p>
<p>As she turned to swim back, he dropped still lower, into a
supine position. In this, wriggling upon his belly like a snake, he
thrust himself forward to the very edge of the bluff, above which,
had she looked up, she would have beheld no more than his head from
the eyes upwards. Thus he remained until she had passed again under
the screening canopy.</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet then, and took off his hat to dash the
perspiration from his face. That face, leering now like a satyr's,
was at the same time overcast with thought. His little eyes were
narrowed and calculating. There was blood on his lip where his
teeth had fastened on it, and a little trickle of blood was on his
black tuft of beard.</p>
<p>In that moment de Bernis, the Spanish plate fleet, his officers,
his lawless followers and the account they might demand of him if
the enterprise of the plate fleet were now wrecked, had ceased to
be of any deterring account. All that he considered was whether he
should leap down from that bluff or fall back and wait here among
the friendly shelter of the trees. In the end he decided for the
trees, and went recklessly crashing through the undergrowth to
conceal himself amongst them.</p>
<p>Livid, panting, his heart beating in his throat, he crouched
there waiting, a beast in ambush for its prey.</p>
<p>At last she came. He saw first her head, that golden head about
which the sunlight seemed now to place an aureole, and then her
bust, and gradually the whole of her, as, demurely clad once more
in her gown of green, she reached the summit of the bluff, from
which the path ran back to the encampment.</p>
<p>His pulses galloped. Pausing there just beyond the screen of
trees, she whipped up by that pause his intolerable impatience. But
he knew that he could afford to wait a little moment longer, wait
until she had come within that green shelter, when she would no
longer be within range of any stray eyes from the encampment.</p>
<p>But, as if further to try his patience, she remained poised
there, looking away to her left, down the southern slope. And when
at last she stepped under, within shadow of the palms, she was
still half-turning to the left, and as she advanced, to his
unutterable rage and horror, she flung up an arm as if in greeting
and beckoning, and he heard her voice suddenly raised to call.</p>
<p>'Pierre! D'ou viens tu a cette heure-ci?'</p>
<p>A moment later his furious eyes beheld the half-caste advancing
rapidly with that long, loping stride of his, and answering her as
he came, though what he said, Leach in his seething, baffled rage,
neither heard nor cared.</p>
<p>Not until Pierre was at last level with her did she turn to her
right, and set out along the path by which she had come, the tall,
lithe half-caste, in his cotton shirt and rawhide breeches,
trotting after her.</p>
<p>Tom Leach made animal noises through his clenched teeth as he
stepped forth from his ambush, and moved to follow them. For once
he was utterly without weapons, otherwise it is possible that he
might in his madness have added murder to what else he
contemplated. As it was, the long athletic limbs of the half-caste
made him think twice about falling upon him with his bare
hands.</p>
<p>He paused a moment on the path, watching them as they receded
and widened the distance between themselves and him. Then, without
precautions, since he was no longer the stalker, he set out to
follow. Instantly the head of the alert Pierre was turned to look
over his shoulder. Having seen who came, and no doubt reported it,
the two went on without change of pace, whilst Leach with a
leisurely step kept in their wake, carrying hell in his evil
soul.</p>
<p>By the time the Captain came level with the hut, Miss Priscilla
had already entered it. From his tent, a little farther on, Pierre
was in the act of taking the fresh-water cask, to go and replenish
it. He delayed but a moment over this, and was off again, almost at
once, along the beach.</p>
<p>The Captain checked in renewed hope. Opportunity, it seemed, was
to serve him, after all.</p>
<p>He allowed Pierre to go some little way, before deliberately
advancing to come and place himself before the entrance of the hut,
from which the heavy curtain was lifted.</p>
<p>Within stood Miss Priscilla with comb in one hand and a
hand-mirror in the other, to repair the disorder in her moist hair.
As the buccaneer's shadow fell across the threshold, she looked up
quickly Seeing him, his face still oddly pallid, his eyes glowing
curiously, she stood at gaze, incomprehensibly perturbed.</p>
<p>He showed his white teeth in a wide smile, and doffed the hat
from his short curly black hair.</p>
<p>'God save ye, mistress,' was his odd greeting.</p>
<p>And then before she could even answer him, the crisp voice and
light, ready laugh of Monsieur de Bernis sounded close at hand,
reassuringly to herald his opportune return.</p>
<p>In the darkening brows and harshly twisted features of Tom Leach
she read the need for that reassurance.</p>
<p>As the Captain stepped back, Monsieur de Bernis and Major Sands
came up.</p>
<p>'Ah, Tom,' was the Frenchman's easy greeting, 'were you seeking
me?'</p>
<p>'Seeking thee?' the other was beginning in scornful, fierce
repudiation. But he controlled himself in time. 'Aye,' he added
slowly.</p>
<p>'What is it?'</p>
<p>'Why, naught. I were just passing by, so thought I'd see if thee
was here. We never sees thee at th' camp nowadays. We hasn't seen
thee for days.'</p>
<p>After that, dissembling ever, he spoke grumblingly of the
progress of the work. It went slowly. It would be another four
days, perhaps five, before they could get the ship afloat again.
Was de Bernis quite certain that they were not behind time?</p>
<p>De Bernis reassured him. The appointed date for the sailing of
the plate fleet was the third of July. It was certain that it would
not sail before that date, probable that it would not sail until a
few days later. No Spaniard was ever known to be ahead of time.
Procrastination was in the blood of Spain. In twenty-four hours
Leach could easily reach the point at which de Bernis proposed to
intercept the Spanish ships, and he would prefer not to take the
seas any earlier than was necessary.</p>
<p>With mutterings of reassurance, Leach took his departure. But de
Bernis did not immediately turn, or immediately speak when he had
gone. He remained standing there, looking after him with brooding,
thoughtful eyes. He had discovered something queer, something
uncomfortable, furtive, and constrained in the Captain's manner,
qualities these not usually displayed by him.</p>
<p>At last Monsieur de Bernis turned to Priscilla. 'Of what was he
speaking when we arrived?' he abruptly asked her.</p>
<p>'You did not give him time to speak of anything. You were here
as soon as he had greeted me.' She laughed as she answered him, and
scarcely knew why. All that she knew was that she wanted to laugh,
in the sudden relief from the indefinable fear which the sight of
Captain Leach's face had inspired in her.</p>
<p>'I have spoken to Pierre about his morning absences,' she went
on to say. 'But he gives me no satisfaction.'</p>
<p>'He has returned?' said de Bernis; and added sharply, 'Where is
he?'</p>
<p>'He has gone for water. He will be here soon.'</p>
<p>'Gone for water?' de Bernis echoed, and his tone had changed.
The eagerness that momentarily had gleamed in his eyes died out of
them again. He shrugged as he turned away, leaving her alone with
the Major.</p>
<p>She had missed none of this, being naturally alert. Trifling
though it seemed, there was something odd in it, and it left her
preoccupied, returning vague answers to the Major's idle chatter,
as he sat there cooling himself in the shade of the hut.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis had gone to Pierre's tent. He remained there
until Pierre returned, bearing the refilled water-cask on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>Watching and listening, she heard de Bernis greet him.</p>
<p>'Eh bien?' And the Frenchman's dark eyes might almost have
seemed anxious as they scanned the half-caste's face.</p>
<p>Pierre lowered his water-cask to the ground. 'Still nothing,
monsieur,' Miss Priscilla heard him reply in French.</p>
<p>'Sh!' De Bernis dropped his voice, and muttered rapidly, almost
it seemed impatiently, ill-humouredly. She wondered was his master
speaking to Pierre about his early absences. But from the manner in
which the conversation had opened, she could hardly suppose it. She
strained her ears. Probably it never crossed her mind that she was
spying; had it done so, she would have accounted that all the
circumstances justified it. The Major's chatter prevented her from
hearing more than the murmur of those rapid voices. But in a pause
he made, she caught again the voice of de Bernis.</p>
<p>'We have still five days, according to Leach, and the weather is
fine.'</p>
<p>'Too fine, perhaps,' said Pierre. 'It may be that.'</p>
<p>Again they became inaudible, and so continued until de Bernis
turned away, and came slowly back, his fingers tugging thoughtfully
at his nether lip.</p>
<p>If de Bernis had admonished Pierre at all about his absences,
the admonition produced no change in his habits. For when on the
following morning, being dressed, Miss Priscilla lifted the curtain
from her door, and called Pierre, it was de Bernis who came from
his tent, dressed only in shirt and breeches, and carrying a tray
that was laden with the requisites for breakfast.</p>
<p>'Monsieur de Bernis!' she cried. 'But where is Pierre
again?'</p>
<p>Smiling and speaking easily, Monsieur de Bernis replied: 'I have
sent him on an errand, Priscilla. But I will help you to contrive
without him.'</p>
<p>'You have sent him on an errand? But on what errand could you
send him?'</p>
<p>'Lord! Here's curiosity!' he laughed. 'Shall I indulge it?
Faith, not I. He has gone on an errand. That is all. Come, let us
make ready before that ravenous wolf the Major awakens to be
fed.'</p>
<p>And that was all she could elicit from him, to her annoyance and
even uneasiness; for her environment and circumstance were not such
as made it possible to bear with equanimity a mystery, however
trivial it might seem.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>Chapter 15. Pearls</h2>
<p>Tom Leach, deliberately and calculatingly watchful, observed
from a distance the departure that morning of Major Sands and de
Bernis. He recognized it to be in accordance with a daily habit
that had become established, just as he knew that their absence
commonly endured for a couple of hours. Curiosity as to whither
they went so regularly had never really pricked him. After all,
within the limits of Maldita it could have no significance.</p>
<p>If curiosity had not been aroused before, it was certainly not
aroused this morning. Since yesterday the buccaneer had been
wrapped in a moody absorption which seemed to render him
indifferent to his surroundings. The disturbing vision of the
bathing-pool abode with him so that he could see nothing else.
Before his eyes swam ever the incredible beauty of that slim form,
with limbs, seen through water, as white and smooth as alabaster, a
loveliness such as Tom Leach had never suspected to exist in
nature. To the feverish, gloating contemplation with the eyes of
memory of that irresistibly alluring vision was added an
unreasoning, savage, torturing rage at the chance frustration
yesterday of his intentions, and an unreasoning, savage, blind
resolve to take amends for that at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Congreve had not yet written that line so apposite to Captain
Leach's case: 'Woman is a fair image in a pool; he who leaps at her
is sunk.' But if he had written it, and Captain Leach, acquainted
with it, had perceived in it a warning to him now, in a double
sense of which the poet had no thought, he must still have
disregarded it. For if, contrary to custom where his lusts were
concerned, the buccaneer may have chanced to weigh the consequences
of what he contemplated, it follows that they did not daunt
him.</p>
<p>It was within those consequences--unless he were exceptionally
fortunate--that he would have to reckon with de Bernis. But when
had he ever shrunk from a reckoning? What man had ever made him
quail, or deviate by a hand's breadth from an evil goal? He would
take a short way with that impudent, supercilious Frenchman whose
days, indeed, were already numbered.</p>
<p>To Bartholomew Sands he did not even give a thought. The fellow
was utterly negligible. And he would have accounted de Bernis just
as negligible save that the consequences of quieting him would
involve abandoning the enterprise of the Spanish plate fleet. This
might make trouble with the buccaneers. But Leach would justify
himself with the tale that de Bernis had attacked him, and that he
had killed him in self-defence. Very probably, he thought, with a
grin, the tale would be true.</p>
<p>As for the loss to himself of his share of the Spanish gold,
what was all the treasure of Spain to him compared with this other
treasure which lay here ready to his hand, tormenting him with its
irresistible allurement?</p>
<p>In his madness either he did not reflect, or else he was
impatient of the reflection, that, by the exercise of patience and
by proceeding according to the intentions which Wogan had first
inspired in him, he might reduce into possession both the treasure
and the girl. Patience was in the eyes of Tom Leach a weakness,
almost a form of cowardice.</p>
<p>And so you see him purposefully crossing that beach, so soon as
Monsieur de Bernis and his companion had passed into the wood, and
gaining the threshold of the hut, in the shade of which Priscilla
sat now alone.</p>
<p>Something in his attitude, above all the leer with which,
bareheaded, he appeared before her, instantly shattered that sense
of security in her which had seemed so solidly founded on the
manifest chivalry of Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>Looking up, she strove to conceal the sudden alarmed flutter in
her breast. If her eyes dilated a little, at least she compelled
her utterance to be calm, level, and unhurried.</p>
<p>'You seek my husband, sir. He is not here.'</p>
<p>The leer broadened. 'I know that. I saw him go. So, ye see, it's
not him I's seeking.'</p>
<p>On that he paused. His close-set eyes were pondering her, so
white and slim and golden. They stripped away the long-waisted gown
of green taffetas with the ivory-coloured lace bordering the
low-cut line of neck, and glowed as they beheld her once again as
he had seen her yesterday in the pool. And yet, for all his ardour,
he faltered a little, now that he was face to face with her, now
that his eyes met the clear, candid gaze of eyes from which she
spiritedly banished every trace of fear. He knew no way of wooing
that was not rough, direct, and brutal, like all else that he did.
Yet here instinct informed him that something other was demanded;
that too rude a grasp might merely crush this fruit for which he
thirsted.</p>
<p>He was glad, therefore, of an inspiration which had come to him
that morning and which was responsible for the line he took. From
an inner pocket of his faded scarlet coat he drew a little leather
bag. He untied the neck of it as he came forward to stand by the
table.</p>
<p>'I've brought thee a little gift,' he said. He opened the mouth
of the bag, and, placing his right hand as a barrier on the table
to prevent the contents from rolling too far, he poured forth a
dozen shimmering, lustrous pearls of price.</p>
<p>'Beauties, isn't they?' Still leaning over the table, he grinned
up at her in expectancy, for she had risen from her seat.</p>
<p>He had experience of the queer fascination such toys can
exercise upon a woman. More than once he had seen covetousness
gleam in a woman's eyes as they considered those lovely, lightly
iridescent spheres, and a hunger of possession whose gratification
was not to be denied, whatever the cost. He had memories of
reluctances defeated in Campeche, in Tortuga, in Mariegalante and
elsewhere by just a couple of these seductive baubles. Never yet
had he poured out as a gift to a woman so incredible a cascade as
this; but then never yet had he seen a woman so incredibly
desirable.</p>
<p>Every man's view of life is based upon his own experiences. Like
drawing like into its intimacies, the vile man meets only vileness
and therefore accounts the world vile. So it was with some
confidence that this crude animal displayed his dazzling
offering.</p>
<p>The result, however, was not at all what he expected. If for a
moment--breathless to him--her eyes were caught and held by those
gleaming orbs, in the next they were regarding him so oddly and
coldly that it was clear she had entirely escaped their
fascination.</p>
<p>'I do not think my husband would wish me to accept a gift.' So
that was it. She went in fear of that pestilent husband.</p>
<p>'Damn husband! There's pearls. Aye, and beauties. Fit for thee
neck they is. They mind me of you, sink me. Just as sleek and
lovely as thee, my pearly lass.'</p>
<p>Frozen in a make-believe composure, she coldly answered him:
'I'll tell my husband that you think so.'</p>
<p>'Eh?' The leering smile faded from his swarthy hawk-like face.
He gaped at her, momentarily nonplussed. Then he laughed outright
to cover a certain sense of discomfiture. His tone was of a grossly
playful gallantry. 'Can ye not forget this plaguey husband for a
while?'</p>
<p>She curbed a desire to answer sharply. Although fear grew in
her, it did not cloud her wits. She must humour this horror of a
man, fence with him as best she could, so as to ward off
indignities. And she must maintain an air of fearlessness.
Therefore, lest her tremors should betray her real feelings, she
sat down.</p>
<p>'Were you never married, Captain Leach?' she asked him, with
significance.</p>
<p>But this merely opened for him a line of direct attack. 'Not I.
Ye see, it isn't many of us has th' luck o' Topgallant Charley, to
find such a rare lass as thee. If that had happened to me, I might
well ha' done the same as him.'</p>
<p>'I'll tell my husband what you say. It will flatter him.'</p>
<p>His colour darkened. She began to exasperate him with this
persistent mention of her husband, and he was not deceived as to
her motive, nor did she desire that he should be. 'Thee's
well-matched with him in pertness, lass,' he growled. Then he, too,
began to play comedy, and covered his rising anger with a mask of
playfulness. 'But that's naught against thee. Odds fish! I loves a
lass o' spirit, and I hates your mealy-mouthed sickly doxies, I
does.' He flung himself down on the ground at her feet. 'Now
where's harm o' praising thee beauty? Dunnot thee like a man to
speak his mind?'</p>
<p>She answered him readily out of her simulated boldness. 'That
depends upon what's in it.'</p>
<p>'Ye should be able to guess what's in mine, if anybody could.'
Leaning upon his elbow, he looked up at her, leering again. 'Shall
I tell thee? Shall I?'</p>
<p>'I am not curious, Captain Leach.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless he answered his own question. 'Thee self,' said he.
'Just thee self. There's been little else in my mind since first I
seen thee, that day we took <i>Centaur</i>.'</p>
<p>His ardent, watchful eyes observed a growing agitation in her
bosom, which argued to him that at last he was upon the course that
led to port. He was pleased with himself for having adopted now
these tactics. Although this form of dalliance was entirely new to
him, yet it was clear that his instincts steered him shrewdly.
'There's naught I wouldn't do for thee, lass. Naught as ye could
ask me.'</p>
<p>'Is that really so?'</p>
<p>'Try me. Put me to th' test.'</p>
<p>'Very well. I ask you to leave me, sir, and to take your pearls
with you.'</p>
<p>He flushed again. Under his little black moustache his lip
curled in a vicious grin that laid bare a dog-tooth. 'And is that
so? Is that all ye can ask o'me? Odds fish! Happen you ask the one
thing I canna be granting. See? As for th' pearls, I want to see
them worn against thee neck. Thee whiteness'll set t'm off, or
maybe shame them. For thee's wondrous white. White as a lily thee
is, from head to foot, as I should know.'</p>
<p>She threw up her chin sharply, her brows knit, her voice stern.
'As you should know?'</p>
<p>He gloated over the answer it was his to return to that pert
question. He laughed a little. 'If a man may believe his eyes.' He
came up on his knees, suddenly to confront her, and she observed
that he had lost colour, that his eyes smouldered as if a fever
raged in him, whilst his full lips writhed in a smile that made her
shudder. 'Dunnot be afeared. I seen thee yesterday, whiles ye swam
in the pool yonder, the loveliest sight as ever I saw. D'ye marvel
now, lass, that I bring pearls to deck thee loveliness?'</p>
<p>Slowly the colour rose in her until her face and neck were a
scarlet flame. She attempted to stand up. But his arms were
suddenly across her knees, pinning her to her chair, his face was
close to her breast.</p>
<p>It was only then, under that intolerable contact, that she
realized the full horror of her situation, alone there, with
Monsieur de Bernis, Major Sands, and Pierre all absent and not
likely to return for perhaps an hour.</p>
<p>Bravely she sought to struggle with her mounting fears, to
preserve control of herself that thus she might still perhaps
preserve control of him. By an effort she kept her voice firm and
hard.</p>
<p>'Captain Leach, let me go. Let me go!' Then, fear beginning to
conquer prudence, 'Let me go, you beast!' she added.</p>
<p>She attempted to elude the pressure of his arms, so as to thrust
back her chair, and rise. But Leach was suddenly rendered mad by
rage at this clearly expressed loathing of him. He told himself
that he had been a fool to waste time and words with this cold
proud piece. He was rightly served for his folly by her insult. He
should have taken the short way with her from the outset instead of
wasting patience in this mawkish dalliance.</p>
<p>'Beast, am I? Well, well, my lass, mebbe I'll give thee cause to
call me that. Mebbe thee'll be less likely to call me that when
I've done so. I've tamed hawks as proud as thee afore now, made
them that tame they'd coo like turtle doves. Mebbe thee'll learn to
coo as gently. And if thee dunnot, what odds?'</p>
<p>Still kneeling before her, so that she could feel the buckle of
his belt pressing against her knees, he held her now firmly
imprisoned in the coil of his right arm. His left hand seized and
crushed lace and silk at the line of her throat. With a snarling
laugh he tore the summit of the bodice.</p>
<p>'There's pearls!' he exulted. 'Pearls!'</p>
<p>She drowned his words in a scream drawn from her by his brutal
violence.</p>
<p>'Thee'd best save thee breath, lass. Screeching won't help.
Cooing may, though.'</p>
<p>Slobbering and snarling, he drew her irresistibly towards him,
out of the chair, which he intended to knock from under her.</p>
<p>Her livid face was distorted now into a grin of stark terror.
'God! O God!' she cried, and never was prayer more fervent.</p>
<p>Nor was ever answer more prompt. Suddenly before her dilating,
terrified eyes, as they looked over the shoulder of Captain Leach,
surged the tall figure of Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>Providentially that morning, as he was proceeding with the Major
to their practice-ground beyond the bluff, it had occurred to him
to step down to the beach for a word with the men at work upon the
hull of the careened ship, and so as to see for himself precisely
the stage which their work had reached.</p>
<p>Standing there in the open, the distant scarlet figure of
Captain Leach had caught his eye. He had seen him moving swiftly
across the shore in the direction of Priscilla's hut, and he had
seen him vanish into it. Without apprehending anything approaching
the truth, it had yet seemed to him that it might be as well if he
were to return and join them. Under the eyes of the buccaneers he
had begun by sauntering casually back towards his own encampment,
followed by the Major, who, having observed nothing, went plaguing
him with questions as to this change of intention. Midway, Monsieur
de Bernis had suddenly lengthened his stride, and left the Major,
to whom hurry was distasteful in that heat, to follow at his
leisure.</p>
<p>In those long, swift strides of his that made no sound upon the
sand, Monsieur de Bernis reached the hut to see for himself how
urgently his coming was required.</p>
<p>Captain Leach, too absorbed to observe the shadow cast by this
newcomer, was startled by a sudden sharp tap upon the shoulder.</p>
<p>'You are at your prayers, I perceive, Captain. I am desolated to
disturb you. But Madame de Bernis is not an object for your so
immediate adoration.'</p>
<p>Tom Leach leapt up and round with the athletic agility of a cat,
his hand going by instinct to his belt.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis had stepped a little aside, so as to leave
the entrance clear. His face was very white, and it wore a smile
rendered terrible by the expression of his eyes.</p>
<p>'By all means continue in your worship of Madame de Bernis. I
desire it so. But at a distance. At a distance in the future, if
you please. Let your worship of her be such as you might bestow
upon a saint in heaven. Thus it will be better for you, safer for
all.'</p>
<p>Imperiously he waved an arm in dismissal, indicating by it the
exit which he had left clear, but beyond which the sturdy figure of
Major Sands was looming.</p>
<p>Leach, with his back turned now upon Priscilla, stood, breathing
hard, crouching a little as if gathering his muscles for a spring.
He spoke in a thick voice that rage was strangling. 'By God! You
grinning jackanapes! D'ye know what happens to them as gets spry
wi' Cap'n Leach?'</p>
<p>'You would do better to ask yourself what may happen to him who
gets spry with Madame de Bernis.' And again it was his gesture that
uttered dismissal.</p>
<p>'Hellfire! I admire thee boldness! But don't carry it too far
with me. See?' He slunk a step or two towards the door and the
round-eyed Major, but keeping his glance the while on de Bernis.
'Thee's a tall fine figure o' a man, so thee is. But I've made
carrion o' finer fellows than thee, Charley, and don't thee be
forgetting it.'</p>
<p>'I'll remember it,' said de Bernis grimly. 'Meanwhile, you'ld
best go while my patience lasts. Ye may have heard that it's not
eternal.'</p>
<p>'Ye threaten, do ye! Well, well! I wonder is there another man
alive who can boast that?'</p>
<p>He stepped out of the hut, and, coming suddenly against Major
Sands, thrust him roughly, vigorously out of his way, glad to find
something under his hand upon which to express in violence the rage
that was choking him. But before he had gone six paces, de Bernis'
voice arrested him again.</p>
<p>'You've forgotten something.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis stood at the entrance of the hut, holding in
his hand the pearls which he had swept up from the table. As he
spoke, he flung them at the Captain.</p>
<p>Some of them struck him, and some did not, but all of them--a
dozen pearls that he would not have sold for a thousand pieces of
eight, but which in his stormy condition he had forgotten--were
scattered in the sand.</p>
<p>After a breathless, raging moment, he went down on hands and
knees spitting and snarling like a cat to grovel for them without
any thought for the ridiculous, ignominious anti-climax which this
supplied.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>Chapter 16. The Apple of
Discord</h2>
<p>Whilst Tom Leach grovelled there, ignominiously, within a dozen
paces of the hut and in full view of those within it, and whilst
Major Sands looked on in bewilderment, his indignation at the
manner in which Leach had handled him partly soothed by the
spectacle of the buccaneer's discomfiture, Monsieur de Bernis was
turning to Priscilla, where she stood, her left hand instinctively
repairing the disorder of her bodice.</p>
<p>It was a Monsieur de Bernis whom she had never seen until this
moment. Hitherto she had beheld him so calm and saturnine in the
face of everything that she had come to consider him utterly
imperturbable, a man of a self-control that nothing could abate.
She beheld him now so pale and shaken that she understood by what
an effort he had commanded himself so long as Tom Leach had stood
before him.</p>
<p>He stepped up to her in quick concern, and she felt the
trembling of the hand he set upon her arm, heard the faltering
quiver of his muffled voice as he uttered her name. With a deep,
shuddering sigh, she sank against him, limp and helpless now that
the strain was overpast. His arm went round her, to support her.
And it supported her morally as well as physically. Her spirit was
uplifted to feel herself thus, within the compass of an arm, as if
within a protecting, sheltering wall. For a moment he held her so,
tenderly, reverently. Then, commanding himself, he spoke and his
voice vibrated oddly.</p>
<p>'I trust, I pray, that animal did not unduly frighten you.'</p>
<p>She shuddered against him. 'Thank God, oh, thank God that you
came!' The very fervour of her thankfulness seemed to feed his
wrath.</p>
<p>'Let that evil dog, too, give thanks. For had I delayed, I must
certainly have killed him.'</p>
<p>She clutched his hand, and looked up at him in a new fear, her
face close to his own. 'You will do nothing more? You will not
pursue it?'</p>
<p>His pale lips twisted in a smile of bitter self-mockery. 'I dare
not,' he confessed. 'In all my life I have never known the need for
so much self-control, to prevent me from doing that which might
have ruined us all. But it was hard, dear God! It was hard! To see
you held so by that foul beast! Priscilla!'</p>
<p>It was a cry from the depth of a man's soul. Into that utterance
of her name he seemed to have packed a dozen emotions: there were
anger, grief, tenderness, renunciation, and something too of
heartbreak. All this and more she heard in it, and to the spirit in
that cry she made surrender of her own spirit. She nestled closer,
softly murmuring to him: 'Do not leave me alone again while we are
here! Promise me.'</p>
<p>'Can you suppose it?' he answered passionately. 'Can you dream I
should ever again leave you exposed to that?'</p>
<p>He bent down to the golden head that rested against his breast,
and reverently touched it with his lips, scarcely aware of what he
did, as he thus expressed an overmastering emotion into which his
fears for her had betrayed him.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the Major, a spectator in whom
amazement had been piled upon amazement, accounted it necessary to
interfere, before Priscilla, newly wrenched from the importunate
arms of one buccaneer, should melt too completely into those of
another.</p>
<p>'Stab me!' quoth he, rolling forward, 'what's here?'</p>
<p>The indignation rumbling in his voice, awakened de Bernis to
realities, arrested him in that easy and increasing surrender to
emotion. His recovery of his ready wits was abrupt and complete.
Without relaxing his hold upon the girl, or making the least change
in his attitude, he spoke swiftly through his teeth.</p>
<p>'Will you ruin all, you fool? What are you supposing? Is she not
my wife in the eyes of that man who is gaping at us at this moment?
I have a part to play, sir. Begone! Leave me to play it.'</p>
<p>The Major gaped, relieved.</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon, de Bernis.' He hung there, hesitating. 'As
her brother, it is natural I, too, should remain to comfort. I have
done nothing to betray you.'</p>
<p>But Miss Priscilla evidently considered that the comedy had gone
far enough. As if also recalled to realities, she disengaged
herself from de Bernis' arm, moved away to a chair, and sat down,
like one exhausted. She was still very white, and dark shadows had
gathered under her eyes. Her left hand was still clutching to her
breast the tattered portions of the bodice.</p>
<p>'If you would both leave me for a little while,' she begged
them.</p>
<p>Understanding, they went. They paced the beach awhile, the Major
inveighing furiously but impotently, and seeming to embrace
Monsieur de Bernis together with Tom Leach in the scope of that
windy invective. Monsieur de Bernis, heeding him not at all, indeed
scarcely hearing him, paced beside him in moody abstraction. He
awakened from that at last to hear the Major saying:</p>
<p>'Of late, sir, I have been giving you my trust. But I warn you
that, unless you can keep these cut-throat friends of yours in
order, that trust will be destroyed.'</p>
<p>'In such a case, sir, you would have my sympathy,' said de
Bernis, and upon that abruptly quitted the Major's side.</p>
<p>Looking round for an explanation of a conduct that seemed to him
so odd, Major Sands saw Pierre emerging from among the trees. It
was towards him that de Bernis was hurrying. The Major followed,
grumbling ever.</p>
<p>He heard the faint mutter of Pierre's rapid French as de Bernis
approached him, and at what the half-caste said, his master's
shoulders sagged a little, and he stood very still and very
pensive, his lip between finger and thumb.</p>
<p>After a moment, by when Major Sands was at his elbow, he spoke,
but whether to himself or to Pierre, who stood before him, waiting,
was not plain. Even the Major's scant knowledge of French enabled
him to understand what de Bernis said.</p>
<p>'Nevertheless, it is necessary to do something.'</p>
<p>After which he paced away slowly towards the hut, and then, like
a man who takes a sudden resolve, swung on his heel, and set out
briskly to walk across the beach towards the buccaneer
encampment.</p>
<p>As he approached it, a couple of men who were boucanning turtle
over a fire, looked up and greeted him with the friendly
familiarity which he had encouraged in them. But for once he swung
past them without noticing it.</p>
<p>It was already a little after noon, and in the Captain's hut,
the leaders were sitting down to dinner, when Monsieur de Bernis
suddenly made his appearance among them, his aspect stem and
forbidding.</p>
<p>Tom Leach, who by now had cooled to a state of viciousness that
superficially at least was normal, eyed him furtively and at first,
startled by that sudden entrance, in apprehension. But the emotion
was not one that ever lasted long with Leach. It passed in a flash,
leaving him armed in brazen impudence to meet the attack which he
had every cause to expect.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis came to the empty foot of the table, directly
facing Leach who occupied the head. On the Frenchman's right were
Bundry and Halliwell, on his left Ellis and Wogan. All four of them
looked up from their meat, to gape at his preternatural
gravity.</p>
<p>His voice was cold and hard and brisk, his speech direct and
peremptory.</p>
<p>'You may have some notion of what brings me, Captain. I have a
warning for you. I need waste no unnecessary words upon it. If the
plate fleet matters to you and you wish me to bring you to it,
you'll be civil henceforth, and you'll avoid my quarters.'</p>
<p>'By God...' Leach was beginning, half-rising in his seat.</p>
<p>'Wait!' thundered de Bernis, and by tone and gesture thrust him
back momentarily silenced. The Frenchman swung to Leach's officers.
'If the plate fleet matters to you, and you desire that I bring you
to it, you'll see that he obeys my injunction. If I have a
repetition of what happened this morning, if Tom Leach ventures
within twenty yards of my encampment again, come what may, I
dissociate myself from you, and I vow to you here that not a single
piece of eight of all that treasure will any one of you ever touch.
If I am to respect my articles, Tom Leach shall respect my wife,
and you others shall see that he respects her.'</p>
<p>The Captain's dark eyes gleamed their hatred and malice as they
met the bold, challenging glance of de Bernis across the length of
the table.</p>
<p>From the others there were mutterings of resentment provoked by
the Frenchman's arrogant tone and air. But one there was who spoke
out, and this was the impassive, clay-faced Bundry. He turned his
shoulder to de Bernis, so as to face the Captain.</p>
<p>'So you've neglected the warning we gave you, Captain?' he said,
in that level voice of his that could be so threatening in its
iciness.</p>
<p>The momentary flash of de Bernis' eyes might have betrayed the
discovery made to him by those words. But at the time all were
looking at the Captain, awaiting his reply. Surprised, however, by
Bundry's cold, obvious challenge, Leach was momentarily at a loss;
whilst de Bernis, encouraged by signs of a support he had not
suspected, took advantage of the pause to turn the sword in the
wound, which, exceeding all expectations, he perceived he had
made.</p>
<p>'I have this to add, Tom, and you would do well to reflect upon
it, and to take it for a compass by which to steer your course: To
the success of this enterprise against the Spaniard, I am
necessary. You are not. The enterprise can quite well go forward
without you. It cannot go forward without me. I say no more. But if
you have any prudence in your foul head, Tom, you'll use it to rake
together some scraps of decency, and put them in your conduct. That
is all. The quarrel may end here if you so choose; or it may go
forward if you choose. I leave you to decide it.'</p>
<p>And without giving Leach time to assemble words in which to
reply, he turned on his heel and departed as abruptly as he had
come, leaving ferment behind him.</p>
<p>Leach was on his feet, ordures of speech on his writhing lips,
and Wogan was supplying a chorus to him, when Bundry's contemptuous
voice interrupted both.</p>
<p>'Quiet, Wogan, you fool! There's mischief enough without your
adding to this hell's brew. As for you, Tom, you've heard, and I
suppose ye've sense enough left in yourself to recognize sense when
ye hear it.'</p>
<p>'Rot you in hell, Bundry! Does thee suppose I'll stomach the
impudence o' yon pimpish ape? Does thee suppose...'</p>
<p>'I suppose ye know the plate fleet matters to us more than you!'
thundered Bundry, getting to his feet, losing control of himself
for once, and banging the table before him.</p>
<p>A silence followed until broken by the Captain's voice, soft,
sly, unutterably wicked. 'Be that so, Bundry? Be that so?' His hand
was groping slowly round his belt, his eyes never leaving Bundry's
masklike face.</p>
<p>It began to look as if Monsieur de Bernis had flung the apple of
discord amongst them to some purpose, as if in a moment blood would
be shed over that table and those buccaneer leaders would be at one
another's throats. It was Halliwell who averted it. He rose and
leaned forward, so that his great bulk was interposed between the
Captain and Bundry.</p>
<p>'In the name of God, Tom, come to your senses. Will ye ruin all
out o' impatience for a whey-faced doxy who'll be safely under your
hand once the pieces of eight are under ours?'</p>
<p>There was promise here as well as admonition. Leach, with all
his impatiences quenched at the moment by other matters, was
steadied by it, at least far enough to look at the others. Bundry's
mind, he knew. Ellis' he read in the scowl of disapproval with
which the mate of the <i>Black Swan</i> was regarding him.
Halliwell, it was plain, would join them if it came to a trial of
strength on this issue. The only one upon whom Leach could count in
that moment seemed to be Wogan, and how long Wogan would remain on
the weaker side was not a matter in which Leach could put much
faith.</p>
<p>With inward rage, which he strove to dissemble, the Captain
perceived only defeat ahead of him if he persisted. Topgallant
Charley, that sly French devil, had been too clever for him, and
had so shifted the quarrel that it now lay between Leach and his
officers.</p>
<p>'Aye, aye,' he growled, 'mebbe I's acted foolish like. There's
sense in what thee says, Ned. But there's poison in what yon
Bundry's said.' He fetched a whine into his voice. 'To say that th'
plate fleet matters more to you than I does!'</p>
<p>''Twas ill said, Bundry,' Wogan censured him. 'So, God save me,
'twas ill said.'</p>
<p>'So ill said that it's my right to ask satisfaction.' Leach was
looking at the pallid shipmaster.</p>
<p>If Bundry trembled in the heart of him, aware of the vaunted
deadly swordsmanship of his Captain, and of what might betide him
if Leach were to succeed in making of this affair a personal
quarrel with himself, his countenance remained unmoved.</p>
<p>'Ye've afforded it,' he said, 'when ye confessed that ye may
have acted foolish. Let it rest there.'</p>
<p>Leach perceived fear in Bundry's desire to drop the matter. He
perceived also that the others held aloof now, and took no sides in
the personal issue which he had given the matter. By this he took
heart again.</p>
<p>'That's easy said, Bundry. But will it rest? After all, here's a
deal o' pother about naught, made up by that slippery devil Bernis.
Am Ito turn t'other cheek to him, or slink about before him like a
cur wi's tail atween his legs no matter what he may do or say, just
because he's got th' secret o' th' plate fleet? Sink me into hell!
That's no gait for a Captain, and it's not th' way o' Tom Leach.
Let it be understood. So long as Charley's civil, I'll keep the
peace; but not a moment longer, plate fleet or no plate fleet. And
if ye expects more o' me, you, Bundry, or any other of ye--a God's
name say so plainly now, and let's know where we stand.'</p>
<p>'Sure that's reasonable enough,' Wogan supported him.</p>
<p>Ellis and Halliwell, whilst saying nothing, showed by their
attitude that they were not disposed to dispute a matter which
Leach had found a way to render personal with any one of them who
might oppose him. United they must easily have subdued him. But the
mistrust of each for his neighbour dissolved the momentary bond
that had existed amongst them, and no one of them would take it
upon himself to bell the cat, lest he should find himself suddenly
abandoned by the others.</p>
<p>Bundry perceived clearly the crude subtlety and cunning by which
Leach had caught him; and he knew that it would be suicidal to
pursue the matter as a personal quarrel with his formidable
Captain. So he abandoned the position which he had so boldly taken
up.</p>
<p>'No one could expect more of ye, Captain. But ye'll remember
that we expect that much.'</p>
<p>'That much ye shall have. Ye can be sure of it.'</p>
<p>Upon which, with peace restored, they sat down to resume their
interrupted meal.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>Chapter 17. Temptation</h2>
<p>That night, wakeful under the stars, Monsieur de Bernis waited
in vain for Miss Priscilla to lift the curtain of her but and come
to sit in talk beside him. The events of the day seemed to have
created the need for so much to be said between them. There was so
much that he felt the need to explain. But apparently, on her side,
there was no corresponding need to hear these explanations; for the
night wore on, and the curtain remained closed.</p>
<p>At last, understanding that this must be by design and not by
chance, he fell to speculating in distress as to the reason. He
could conceive that he had offended her. When he had taken her so
tenderly in his arms, he had perhaps overstepped the boundaries of
the relations she was disposed to tolerate between them. And yet
surely she must have perceived the almost unavoidable need to
create that appearance of uxoriousness, and by this have deflected
any resentment.</p>
<p>Lest it should be so, indeed, the need to explain became of an
increasing urgency. He ended by softly calling her. Three times he
repeated that call before the curtain was raised. Nevertheless,
despite the urgency, prudence compelled him to keep down his voice.
It followed, therefore, since she heard him, that she, too, was
awake.</p>
<p>'You called?' she said between question and assertion, and
added: 'Is anything amiss?'</p>
<p>He had risen, and stood with the long enveloping cloak hanging
loose from his shoulders.</p>
<p>'That is what I desired to ask you. I was led to fear it from
this breach of custom. I mean your absence. Will you not sit?'</p>
<p>'You have something to say to me?'</p>
<p>She heard his muted, whimsical laugh. 'That seems to have been
my constant affliction. But tonight I have something more than
usual.'</p>
<p>She lowered herself to the cushion which served him for a
pillow, and which as usual he had set for her, and he sank down
beside her. 'Be frank,' he invited. 'You did not come, you would
not have come had I not called you, because you are offended with
me.'</p>
<p>'Offended? I? How could that be?' But her voice had the frosty
tone of one who fences.</p>
<p>'It should not be. But there is always the danger of being
misunderstood. I feared I had incurred it. You might have conceived
that I made too free today. It was that...'</p>
<p>'This is unnecessary,' she interrupted. 'There is no
misunderstanding. None is possible. I heard your explanation to
Major Sands. It was comedy you played for the information of
Captain Leach. I perceived the necessity.'</p>
<p>Yet there was nothing gracious in her tone, no lessening of its
distant frostiness. It puzzled him.</p>
<p>'And you condone it?' he asked.</p>
<p>'But, of course. You play comedy very well, Monsieur de
Bernis.'</p>
<p>'Ah?'</p>
<p>'So well that for a moment you misled me. For a moment I
actually conceived that your alarm and your concern were
genuine.'</p>
<p>'I assure you that they were,' he protested.</p>
<p>'But...hardly to the extent which I was so foolish as to
suppose.' He was betrayed by that complaint into a display of
fervour.</p>
<p>'Whatever the extent to which you may have supposed me moved,
your assumption will hardly have done justice to the fact.'</p>
<p>'And yet the fact left you under the necessity to play comedy so
as to provide all that you conceived the situation to require.'</p>
<p>'Ah, mon Dieu!' he exclaimed, lapsing into his native tongue as
he sometimes did when deeply moved. 'Can you mean...' He checked
himself in time. He was about to add: 'Can you mean that you are
aggrieved because what I uttered of tenderness was uttered only in
make-believe?'</p>
<p>'What were you going to say?' she asked him, as he fell silent.
'Something unutterable.'</p>
<p>Her tone softened a little. 'If you were to utter it, we might
reach the truth between us.'</p>
<p>'There are truths that it is better not to reach. Truths that
are like the forbidden fruit on the Tree of Knowledge.'</p>
<p>'This is not Paradise, Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>'I cannot be so sure on that. In these last days it has grown
nearer to Paradise for me than any I have known in life.'</p>
<p>This created a silence, which endured so long that he began to
fear he had now, indeed, offended. And then at last, in a small
voice, looking straight before her down the pallid beach to the
dusky shimmer of water beyond, and the shadowy silhouette of the
<i>Centaur</i> where she rode at anchor in the lagoon, she answered
him with a question.</p>
<p>'Do they play comedy in your paradise, Monsieur de Bernis?'</p>
<p>If he had doubted until now, he could doubt no longer on what it
was that she desired his frank avowal. The invitation could
scarcely have been more plain had it been plainly uttered. He
passed a hand across his brow and found it moist. True, the night
was warm. But not warm enough to draw the sweat from such a frame
as his. It sprang, he knew, from the labours of his mind.</p>
<p>He answered, at last, slowly, in a voice which being of
necessity muted was thereby the more easily kept level.</p>
<p>'Priscilla, count it my saving grace that I know where the
frontiers of reality are set for me.'</p>
<p>'Can you think only of yourself?'</p>
<p>'It is perhaps my only unselfishness.'</p>
<p>Again there was silence; of frustration for her, of agony for
him. And then, woman-like, she came back to the beginning.</p>
<p>'Then it was not comedy you played today? Not quite?' Her voice
was coaxing.</p>
<p>'What else? I am I; you are you. The only bridge that Fate can
fling between us is a bridge of make-believe.'</p>
<p>'Fate, perhaps. But you, yourself. You...you build no bridges?'
Almost roughly he answered her. 'There is none would bear me. I am
too heavily laden.'</p>
<p>'Can you throw off no part of this load?'</p>
<p>'Can a man throw off his past? His nature? It is from these I
derive my load of shame.'</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly. She leaned against him, as she
answered.</p>
<p>'Your nature is not so laden. I have studied it. As for the
past... What is the past?'</p>
<p>'Our heritage in the present.'</p>
<p>'May not a man discard his heritage?'</p>
<p>'Not when he inherits from himself. It is a part of him.'</p>
<p>She sighed. 'How obstinate you are! Are you quite sure that your
humility is not a form of pride?'</p>
<p>'Pride?' he echoed in repudiation, and upon the word fell
silent, thoughtful, to say at last: 'Perhaps it is. An obstinate
pride to serve Honour at last, that in serving it I may be worthy
at least of the passing thought you have bestowed on me.'</p>
<p>'And if it were not passing?' she softly asked him.</p>
<p>'It must be.' His voice was firm. He drew away a little, as if
so that the warm, sweet contact of her arm upon his own should not
enfeeble his stout purpose. 'Later--soon--when you are restored to
your own people and to the ways of life to which you belong, you
will look back on this adventure as upon some incredible nightmare
from which you have happily awakened. Take nothing from it with you
into that waking future to mar its sweet serenity.'</p>
<p>'Charles!' She set a hand upon his, where it rested on his
knee.</p>
<p>His hand turned in her grasp to close upon her own and press it.
Still holding it he rose, and drew her up with him.</p>
<p>'I shall remember, Priscilla; always shall I remember; and I vow
to you here that I shall be the better for remembering. So much as
you have given I shall treasure till I die. But you shall give no
more.'</p>
<p>'If it should be my will to give?' she asked him, scarcely above
her breath.</p>
<p>His reply came instantly and firmly.</p>
<p>'This pride of mine will not suffer me to take such gifts. You
are you, and I am I. Think well what this means: what you are, and
what I am. Good night, my dear.' He raised her hand, and bending
his head pressed his lips upon it. Then he released it, and lifted
the curtain for her.</p>
<p>'Tomorrow this will be a sweet dream that I have dreamed here
under the stars and you on your couch in there from which I should
not have summoned you.'</p>
<p>For a long moment she remained standing before him, her face a
white blur in which the dark pools of her eyes were turned towards
him. Then, bowing her head a little, she passed into the hut
without another word. Her demeanour next morning, when again he
came to act as deputy for the mysteriously absent Pierre, accorded
with his injunction that what had passed between them in the night
should be regarded as a dream. If she was pale and of a heaviness
about the eyes that argued lack of sleep, her manner at least was
normally bright, and it was of the absence of Pierre that she
spoke. As usual he evaded her questions on the subject. He could
not again pretend to have sent the half-caste on an errand. He met
her with assumptions that Pierre had taken a fancy for early
morning wandering and a curious disposition to indulge Pierre in
any such fancies, however discomposing in their consequences.</p>
<p>After breakfast there was that day no question of the usual
sword practice with the Major. Following upon the events of
yesterday it was tacitly agreed that the two men should never both
be absent at the same time from their encampment.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis wandered off to the northern end of the beach
to observe the progress of the work upon the careened hull. The
tarring was nearing its conclusion. By tomorrow, the men told him,
as he mingled with them, they would start the greasing that marked
the end of their toil. They would be thankful, they asserted with
many a foul oath, to have the <i>Black Swan</i> afloat again. He
jested with them, as usual, and encouraged them again with a
reminder of the golden harvest they would sail away to garner. He
was still in talk with them when Leach sauntered up.</p>
<p>There was a deliberate, sly, and wickedly purposeful air about
the Captain as he joined them. It coloured the manner in which he
growled at the men, reminding them that progress with the work was
slow enough without their suspending it to stand idly in talk. Did
they want him to spend the remainder of his life on Maldita? Then
he obscenely invited Monsieur de Bernis to find other employment,
and not to stand there wasting the time of the hands.</p>
<p>Curbing himself before the Captain's calculatedly offensive
manner, Monsieur de Bernis shrugged, and began to move away without
other answer. But this did not satisfy the Captain, who came
briskly after him.</p>
<p>'D'ye shrug your shoulders at me, Bernis?' he demanded, loud
enough to be heard by the men.</p>
<p>Over his shoulder, without checking in his stride, de Bernis
answered him: 'What else would you have me do?'</p>
<p>'I'ld have ye attend. I'll have ye know I'm Captain here, and
when I speak I expects an answer.'</p>
<p>'I obeyed your wishes. Is not that answer enough?'</p>
<p>He halted now, confronting Leach. They had moved out of earshot
of the men. But they were still under their eyes, and those eyes
were watchful. The buccaneers had sensed the beginnings of a very
pretty quarrel in the Captain's opening words, and it being in
their natures to love a fight, they looked on; hopefully without
even a pretence of attending to their work.</p>
<p>Leach considered the Frenchman with an eye of cordial
dislike.</p>
<p>'Ye shrugged at me,' he complained truculently. 'I'll have no man
shrug at me when I gives orders. Least of all a French pimp.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis considered him in his turn. Himself armed, he
observed that Leach, too, had hung a rapier at his side. Nor did a
certain eagerness in Leach escape him.</p>
<p>'I see,' he said. 'Ye want to put a quarrel on me. But ye dare
not do it openly, lest your followers should call you to account
for it. So ye think to provoke me into striking you, with Wogan
looking on up yonder. That, you suppose, will justify you in their
eyes. Do I read you aright, Tom?'</p>
<p>The other's furious countenance told him that he did.</p>
<p>'Be sure as I reads thee aright, Charley. Thee's just a cowardly
cuckold, impudent so long as thee counts theeself sheltered.'</p>
<p>But de Bernis laughed aloud. 'Maybe you are right,' said he
shamelessly. Then he sobered. 'There's a day for everything, Tom.
Ye may be athirst for my blood. But this is not the time to drink
it. The draught would poison you. Haven't they warned you of
it--Bundry and the others?'</p>
<p>In words at least Leach could vent some of the hatred into which
de Bernis had come with him. 'Ye pitiful, tale-bearing craven!' he
said, and spat deliberately in token of his contempt. Then turned
on his heel, and moved away, in the direction whence Wogan was
uneasily advancing. But he went ready to swing round at the first
sound behind him, confidently expecting de Bernis to throw caution
to the winds before that crowning insult.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, however, disappointed him. He remained
looking after that leisurely departing scarlet figure, with
narrowing, calculating eyes, and the faintest shadow of a smile
under his little dark moustache, until the Captain was joined by
Wogan. Then he, too, moved away, returning to his own side of the
beach.</p>
<p>And meanwhile there was Wogan confronting Leach, arms akimbo and
remonstrance in his lean, crafty face.</p>
<p>'Och, now Captain, darling, I was afeard you'ld be letting your
temper run away with you. Bad cess to it!'</p>
<p>Leach laughed at him, his countenance baffled and unpleasant.
'See thee, lad! Leave me to settle my own affairs in my own
way.'</p>
<p>'Faith, but I'll be reminding you that this is the affair of all
of us, so it is.'</p>
<p>'When I settles it, I'll not forget that.'</p>
<p>'But if ye were to kill Charley, there would...'</p>
<p>Scornfully Leach interrupted him.</p>
<p>'Kill him?' He laughed aloud, contemptuous repudiation of the
notion. 'I's no bungler. I know what's to do. I's not killing him.
But, by God, I'll cut his poxy comb, for him. I'll mutilate him,
make him helpless so as he'll not swagger any more.'</p>
<p>'But that's as bad now.' Wogan's alarm was clear.</p>
<p>'Is it?' Leach closed an eye slowly. 'Thee's no faith in me. Once
I have him powerless, crippled, does thee think I've no ways to
squeeze this secret o' th' plate fleet from him? Woolding mayn't do
it, nor a match between his toes. But there's things we might do to
that proud cold piece of his, to Mistress de Bernis, things we
might do under his eyes, the threat o' which would mebbe loosen his
stubborn tongue. There's more ways nor one o' persuading the
dumbest man to talk.'</p>
<p>Wogan's eyes grew round in wonder. 'The Saints preserve us, Tom!
It's a devil ye are.' But his tone was one of admiration.</p>
<p>They departed arm-in-arm, to their own quarters.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis found Miss Priscilla, who was now reduced to
being her own tire-woman, occupied with needlework within the hut.
The Major had been seated there, too, in talk with her. But at
sight of the approaching Frenchman, he rose and went forth to meet
him.</p>
<p>'Will you walk, sir?' he invited him. 'Since we do not fence
this morning, we might saunter here awhile within reach of
Priscilla. I have something to say to you.'</p>
<p>There was an unusual geniality in his manner which took Monsieur
de Bernis almost by surprise. Of late the Major had been more
friendly; but never genial. There was always in his bearing a
certain aloofness, suggesting that he never lost sight of the fact
that he was a gentleman of family holding the King's commission and
that de Bernis was just a pirate rogue towards whom necessity alone
prescribed a certain degree of civility.</p>
<p>'At your service,' said Monsieur de Bernis, and they fell into
step and paced on towards the southern rampart of rock, beyond
which, unknown to them, lay Priscilla's bathing-pool into which she
was not likely again to venture.</p>
<p>'I am distressed, stab me! I tell you frankly, de Bernis, I am
distressed. You seem at odds with these buccaneer rogues, Leach and
the rest of them. I ask myself, if harm should come to you, what is
to become of us, or, rather, what is to become of Priscilla.'</p>
<p>'Can you suppose, sir, that I am not considering it?'</p>
<p>'You are? You relieve me a deal. Yet not altogether.' The Major
was very grave. 'Bear with me a moment, de Bernis. You were
impatient with me once before when I asked you what is your
intention by us when you sail away on this Spanish raid. Yet now
that the time is drawing near, I am driven to ask this again. To
ask it again. You cannot surely intend that we should sail with
you. It would be--ah--unthinkable, stab me, that you should take
Miss Priscilla into the horrors and the dangers of a
sea-fight.'</p>
<p>'You might remain here at Maldita until I return to take you
off,' said de Bernis.</p>
<p>'Ah!' Some of the gloom lifted from the Major's countenance.
'Yes.' His tone was musing. 'It is what I had thought possible.
Yet...' He paused, stood still, and confronted his companion. 'What
if you should not return, Monsieur de Bernis?'</p>
<p>'You mean?'</p>
<p>'You go into danger. You go into a deal of danger as it seems to
me. There is danger from the Spaniards, and then there is danger
from your associates. You are making bad blood with them, I fear.
Bad blood. At least, after what happened yesterday with this
blackguard Leach...'</p>
<p>'Would you have had me civil to him?'</p>
<p>'Sir! Sir! Can you suppose it? Stab me!' The Major became
consequential. 'You bore yourself as I would have borne myself in
your place. Do not misunderstand me, I implore you. Do not
misunderstand me. What happened could not have been avoided. But it
alters things between you and Leach. It occurs to me that he may
curb his rancour only just so long as it suits his ends. And that
once you have led him to the plate fleet, once you have parted with
your secret, he may take a revenge upon you. Perhaps this had not
occurred to you.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis smiled. 'My dear Major, do you suppose that
it is from blindness to the obvious that I have contrived to
survive all the perils of such a life as mine?'</p>
<p>The Major did not like his tone, and the reflection it contained
upon his own acumen. His manner lost some of its geniality.</p>
<p>'You mean that it had already occurred to you?'</p>
<p>'And not merely as a possibility. Long before our yesterday's
disagreement, I have known that it is not the intention of Leach to
keep faith with me. He has confidently been counting upon slitting
my throat and possessing himself of Miss Priscilla once I have led
him to the plate fleet.'</p>
<p>'Oh, my God!' said the Major in a horror that blotted everything
else from his mind. 'Then...Then...' He was utterly at a loss. He
had stood still again. His heavy face was pale as he turned it upon
de Bernis. 'But if this is so...' Still he could find no conclusion
to his sentence. There was a sort of chaos in his dull mind.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis smiled. 'It is something to be forewarned.
Things may not fall out quite as Tom Leach expects them. Indeed,
they may fall out very differently. I, too, have my intentions and
my plans.'</p>
<p>The Major stared, his mind in labour. 'I suppose you think you
can depend upon his followers, upon the leaders?'</p>
<p>'What I think is of no great account. It is what I know that
matters. And what I know is that I depend upon myself. Not for the
first time, Major Sands.'</p>
<p>Considering him, so straight and calm and resolute, Major Sands
came nearer to admiring him than he had yet done. This, after all,
seemed to be a man upon whom it was good to lean in an awkward
situation.</p>
<p>'You have no anxieties, then?'</p>
<p>'Oh, yes. I have anxieties. Few things are certain in this life,
however shrewdly a man may plan. And too great a confidence is,
they say, unlucky, which possibly is true because it makes a man
careless. That, at least, you may depend that I shall not be.
Hitherto, Major, you have placed no great trust in me, I know. At
least let my deep devotion to Priscilla and my deep concern for her
assure you that I have no thought but to make her safe. In that
safety you will share.' His eyes travelled up the beach towards the
hut, as if following his thought. 'Ah, there is Pierre returning,'
he said, and on that left the Major where he stood and strode
rapidly across the sands.</p>
<p>The Major stared after him with a brow of thunder. 'His deep
devotion to Priscilla!' he said, speaking aloud. 'Damnation take
his impudence!'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, unconscious of the resentment he had loosed
behind him, was overtaking the half-caste as he entered his tent.
But before he could ask the question that trembled on his lip, the
half-caste presented a blank countenance to him, thrust out a
nether lip, shook his head, and shrugged.</p>
<p>'Rien du tout,' he said dismally.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis' eyes dilated under a frowning brow.</p>
<p>'Ah! But this becomes serious.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>Chapter 18. The
Assault-at-Arms</h2>
<p>On the following morning, Monsieur de Bernis, a little grey of
face and with the deep lines in it more marked than usual, sat
brooding alone on a little knoll at some distance from the hut,
staring out over the sunlit lagoon at the <i>Centaur</i>, riding
there with bare trees.</p>
<p>A fresh breeze had sprung up from the north at dawn, and the
fronds of the palms were rustling softly behind him. From the
northern end of the beach came the voices of the men labouring
about the hull of the <i>Black Swan</i> which so soon now would be
afloat again. Three days, at the utmost, was all that remained of
this sojourn on Maldita. And it was this imminence of departure
that was so deeply fretting Monsieur de Bernis, that had stripped
him of that air of assured confidence which hitherto he had
worn.</p>
<p>Pierre, as usual, was absent. In the last two days this absence
had not merely been confined as previously to the morning, but had
been repeated again in the late afternoon. According to the custom
he had established, his return was not to be expected until midday.
But now, suddenly, although it could not yet be nine o'clock, he
appeared at Monsieur de Bernis' side, to arouse his master from his
preoccupations. So effectively did the mere sight of him move
Monsieur de Bernis that he was on his feet before Pierre had even
spoken. His expression so strained as to be almost scared, he
clutched the half-caste's wrist, and stared questioningly into his
face.</p>
<p>Pierre grinned and nodded, showing signs of excitement. 'Enfin,'
he said. 'Les voila!'</p>
<p>'C'est bien vrai?' Monsieur de Bernis demanded, like a man
afraid to believe, lest his hopes should fool him.</p>
<p>'Venez donc voir, vous-même.' Pierre drew a telescope from inside
his cotton shirt, which once had been white but now was grey, and
handed it to de Bernis.</p>
<p>Then the two of them turned, and set off up the beach, Monsieur
de Bernis observing that the Major was with Miss Priscilla, and
satisfied that he would remain there on guard. They vanished into
the woods, taking the path across the island by which Pierre had
once conducted Miss Priscilla.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour they came out upon the western shore,
and halted on the very edge of the sands to gaze out to sea in the
direction in which the exultant Pierre was pointing.</p>
<p>Less than five miles away three great ships were beating up to
eastward, close-hauled to the northerly breeze and listing to
starboard under the weight of it until the edges of their white
bellies showed below their red hulls.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis levelled the telescope and for some moments
stood carefully scanning them. They flew no flag; but their lines
left him in no doubt of their identity.</p>
<p>As he closed the telescope, a grim smile was stamped on his
dark, narrow face. 'In an hour they will have the island abeam.
Come. There's no time to be lost.'</p>
<p>They sped back as swiftly as they had come. In all they had not
been absent above an hour when they stepped out of the woods again
beside their hut. There Monsieur de Bernis paused. From under his
arm he took the telescope, which he had retained until now, and
handed it to Pierre, who went off with it to his tent.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis stepped into the hut, where the Major sat
drowsily watching Priscilla, who was again busy with her needle.
They looked up as he entered and went to take down his sword and
baldrick from the hook where it was hung.</p>
<p>'Why that?' the girl asked him sharply.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis shrugged. 'Feeling running as it does, it is
well to go prepared.' He passed the heavily encrusted baldrick over
his head, and settled it on his shoulder. 'It inspires respect. It
acts as an inducement to civility.'</p>
<p>Reassured by that smiling explanation and his easy manner, they
let him go.</p>
<p>Outside the hut he paused. Knowing what he went to do, he was
moved to a last word with Priscilla, a last instruction to the
Major in case the worst should befall him. Instead, however, after
an instant's thought, he passed on to the half-caste's tent.</p>
<p>'Pierre, if the worst should happen to me, see to Miss
Priscilla. You should meet few difficulties.'</p>
<p>Pierre's eyes, dark and soft as velvet, were filled with alarmed
concern. 'Monsieur! Could you not wait? Is there no other way?'</p>
<p>'No way so sure as this. Besides, I owe it to myself.'</p>
<p>'Sure?' the half-caste echoed. 'But not sure for you.'</p>
<p>'Eh, pardieu! But yes. Sure enough for me.'</p>
<p>Pierre clutched his master's hand. He bore it to his lips. 'Dieu
vous garde, monsieur!' he prayed.</p>
<p>De Bernis patted the bowed head. 'Sois tranquille, mon fils.'
And upon that he departed resolutely.</p>
<p>Chance favouring his design, he came upon Tom Leach walking with
Wogan within fifty yards of the buccaneer encampment. He gave them
a friendly good day; gave it deliberately, with a flourish. Tom
Leach looked him over without friendliness.</p>
<p>'What d'ye want here?'</p>
<p>'What I want?' Monsieur de Bernis displayed only surprise, to
mask his satisfaction at finding the Captain so readily disposed to
create the situation which the Frenchman desired. 'What I want?' he
said again, his eyebrows up, his lip curling, his eyes looking down
his nose at the buccaneer.</p>
<p>The very insolence of his attitude was steel to the flint of
Leach's humour. 'Aye, what ye want. If thee's come to make mischief
again, thee'd better ha' stayed away.'</p>
<p>They were making excellent progress, thought Monsieur de Bernis.
He stepped close up to Leach, with arms akimbo, whilst Wogan looked
on inscrutably. 'I don't think ye're civil, Tom.'</p>
<p>'Civil?' The Captain spat with deliberate offensiveness. 'I sees
no call for civility.'</p>
<p>'So? In fact, Tom, I find you damned provocative.'</p>
<p>'Provocative! Ha! He finds me provocative, Mike! 'Slife! Are you
to be provoked? Seems to me yours is the kind o' courage that likes
to have a shelter, to make cat's-paws for itself.'</p>
<p>'That is what you know of me, is it?'</p>
<p>'It's what I's seen.'</p>
<p>Wogan accounted it time to make a pretence of intervening. 'Och,
now, will ye be remembering what's ahead of us? Won't ye be making
the peace, now, both of ye, and working together like good Brethren
of the Coast. Come, now.'</p>
<p>'It is what I most desire, Wogan,' lied Monsieur de Bernis.
'I've been thinking that yesterday Tom said that to me which hurt
my honour. If he'll unsay it now, I am ready to forget it.'</p>
<p>Thus, in his desire that the provocation should appear to come
entirely from the other side, he gambled upon his knowledge of the
Captain's mood and nature. The result did not disappoint him.</p>
<p>'Honour!' Leach crowed derisively. 'Your honour! Faith! That's
good! That's very good for thee!' And he laughed, his eyes inviting
Wogan to join him in his derisory mirth.</p>
<p>But the tall, lanky Irishman preserved a preternatural gravity.
Nor was he entirely without anxiety. He was almost as solemn as
Monsieur de Bernis, who was asking in solemn tones: 'Will you tell
me what's to laugh at, Captain?'</p>
<p>'You! You and your honour, you cuckoldy jackanapes!'</p>
<p>In the next moment he was reeling under the sound and unexpected
cuffing he received from the Frenchman. Monsieur de Bernis,
accounting that things had gone far enough, and that Leach's words
were more than sufficient to justify him, had acted quickly before
Wogan could intervene.</p>
<p>Leach, recovering his balance, momentarily unsettled, fell back
a pace or two, aghast and furious. His eyes blazed in his livid
face. He began to unfasten his coat. 'By the living God! I'll cut
your liver out for that, you French kite.'</p>
<p>'Steady, Captain! Holy Virgin! Steady, now!' cried Wogan.</p>
<p>Leach turned some of his rage upon him. 'Does thee think I'll
take a blow from any man? I'll be steady when I's skewered his
lousy vitals!' There was froth on his lips, madness in his
eyes.</p>
<p>Wogan wrung his hands in distress. 'Och, now, Charley, what have
ye done, ye fool?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, following the example set him by Tom Leach,
was already peeling off his coat of fine violet taffetas. 'What I
had no choice but do. I'll ask you to bear witness to it, Wogan.
Could I have my honour mocked by that dirty cut-throat, that foul
son of a dog?'</p>
<p>In sheer amazement Leach suspended his preparations. Not in
years had any man dared apply such terms to him in his hearing, and
the last man in the world from whom he would have expected it was
this Frenchman who only yesterday had swallowed his insults with
such cowardly meekness. When he recovered from that gasping
astonishment, he loosed a volley of obscenity, at the end of which
came blood-curdling menaces.</p>
<p>'I'll flay thee bones for that, thee French pimp! I'll carve
thee lousy hide into ribbons or ever I kills thee, thou dawcock!'
He drew his sword with a vicious flourish, and flung scabbard and
sword-belt from him. 'Guard thee self!' he snarled, and bounded in,
to attack.</p>
<p>So treacherously swift and sudden was the action that Monsieur
de Bernis was almost taken unawares. His sword was no more than
half out of the sheath when that murderous lunge was aimed at him.
He parried in the last fraction of a second with the half-drawn
blade, still holding in his left hand the scabbard from which the
baldrick trailed. Having parried, he broke ground, so as to
disencumber himself. He cast scabbard and baldrick from him, and
came on guard again promptly to meet the pursuing onslaught.</p>
<p>Fifty yards away the men at work on the hull of the <i>Black
Swan</i> had seen these preliminary signs of an assault-at-arms.
Now, as the blades clashed and ground together, the swordsmen
feeling each other's strength, tools were dropped, and the
buccaneers came swarming across the beach. Others who had been at
rest leapt up to join them. They came laughing and shouting like
children to a show For there was no spectacle in the world they
loved better than this which was now offered to them. The gold of
the plate fleet which might be lost to them by the issue of that
combat, if remembered at all, weighed for nothing at the moment by
comparison with the combat itself.</p>
<p>Halliwell and Ellis, who came running up with them, perceived
this, and paused to restrain Bundry, who was angrily insisting that
the fight must at all costs be stopped. That pause for argument
destroyed any chance that Bundry might have had of successfully
interfering. By the time he and his two companions reached the
scene, the buccaneers had formed a dense ring about the combatants
through which the shipmaster sought in vain to break. The
perception of his intention was enough to increase the resistance
of the men, and after that it was idle of Bundry to attempt to
assert authority with scoundrels who recognized no authority, bowed
to no discipline, save only when in action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gleefully watching the fight, the buccaneers laughed
and cheered and flung their comments freely at the fighters, as if
this were just some game or friendly contest being played for their
amusement.</p>
<p>The display was certainly a brave one, fully deserving the
enthusiasm it aroused in the spectators.</p>
<p>The swordsmanship of Tom Leach was his one redoubtable
accomplishment. Often in the past had it been tested; for having
come to account himself invincible, it had afforded keenest delight
to his crude, feral nature to observe the growing consciousness of
helplessness, the agony of assured defeat and inevitable death in
the opponent with whom he toyed before finally dispatching him. He
had been at pains to acquire his skill, and he supplemented it at
need by a half-dozen tricks picked up in different parts of the
world.</p>
<p>So it was with an exultant confidence that he engaged this
detested de Bernis, whose arrogant existence alone offended his
self-love, rendering him hideously conscious of his own defects,
and for whose wife he was stark mad with covetousness. As Wogan
knew, it was not the Captain's intention to kill the Frenchman.
But, having defeated and disabled him, he would use this attack
which de Bernis had made upon him as a pretext for cancelling the
articles between them and for having recourse to those fiendish
measures which he had yesterday disclosed to Wogan. Thus, without
further preamble he would end the existing situation. He would
squeeze the secret of the Spanish plate fleet from de Bernis and
possess himself of de Bernis' wife. In the circumstances none would
deny him, but, if any did, Leach would know how to deal with
him.</p>
<p>For forty-eight hours now this had been the evil dream of Tom
Leach, as he had shown Wogan yesterday when he opened his mind to
him so as to deflect the Irishman's opposition.</p>
<p>And now, at last, his cunning had found a way to provoke the
Frenchman into single combat, and here was de Bernis before his
point, at his mercy.</p>
<p>In that spirit Tom Leach went into the engagement. And because
of all that hung upon it, despite his confidence, he went into it
cautiously and craftily. He knew that de Bernis enjoyed some repute
as a swordsman. But there was nothing in this to intimidate Tom
Leach. He had faced in his time other swordsmen of repute, and
their repute had availed them little before his own superb
mastery.</p>
<p>Agile as a cat in all his movements, and crouching a little as
he fought, he advanced and retreated by little leaps, testing the
other's guard at each disengage.</p>
<p>Erect and easily poised, parrying closely, and making no attempt
to break ground, de Bernis mocked his antics, and sent a shiver of
laughter through the spectators.</p>
<p>'Are we fighting, Captain, or are we dancing a fandango?'</p>
<p>The jest, combined with the easy firmness of the Frenchman's
close guard, which depended upon the play of the wrist alone,
momentarily angered Leach, and urged him to attack with greater
fury and vigour. But when at the culmination of this attack, a
swift, sudden unexpected counter drove him back, he recovered his
poise and grew calm again by instinctive perception of the
necessity for it. He was realizing by now that he had to do with a
swordsman of more than ordinary strength, and that he must go
cautiously to work.</p>
<p>But he lost none of his confidence in the skill with which it
had thrilled him in the past to send many a tall fellow to his
account.</p>
<p>He advanced again; and again the blades sang together. He thrust
high. De Bernis parried lightly, using the forte of the blade with
great effect, and countered promptly. Leach beat the blade aside
with his left hand, and lunged with confidence, so as to take the
other in the shoulder, but only to find his own blade set aside in
the same manner. This brought them close to each other, each within
the other's guard. Thus a moment they stood, eye to eye; then Leach
recovered, and leapt nimbly back. Even as he did so, de Bernis'
point whirled after him, swift as lightning. He parried; but he
parried late. The point driven straight at his breast, was swept by
him up and outwards; but not swiftly enough. It ploughed a furrow
in his right cheek.</p>
<p>Infuriated by that first hit and even more by his near escape of
worse, he crouched lower than ever. He was breathing hard, and his
face had become livid save for that crimson line from which the
blood was running down his neck.</p>
<p>He heard the excited chatter of the crowd, and the thought of
this humiliation suffered in the eyes of his followers served to
steady him. The disgrace of that wound must be wiped out. He had
been rash. He had underestimated his antagonist. He must go more
carefully to work. He must wear down that infernally close guard
from which de Bernis derived his plaguey speed, before attempting
his gradual subjugation. Hitherto he had led the onslaught and had
not spared himself. He had better now leave that to the other, let
the Frenchman spend himself in vain attack. And as if yielding to
his wishes, it was now de Bernis who advanced upon him, and the
Frenchman's glittering point was everywhere at once to dazzle him.
It seemed to break up into two, four, six, several points that came
at Leach at one and the same time, so that whilst Leach
instinctively circled his blade so as to cover himself from this
terrible ubiquity, yet, pressed as he was, he found himself falling
back, again and yet again, for very life's sake.</p>
<p>It was only when at the end of a half-dozen such disengages, de
Bernis failing to follow the Captain's last backward leap, Tom
Leach could at last pause for breath, that the realization began to
break upon him, in furious surprise and mortification, that at last
he, in whom past victories had bred the insolent conviction of
invincibility, had met his master.</p>
<p>Whilst he knew nothing of the assiduous practice with which de
Bernis had been exercising and keeping alive his skill, yet he
began to realize that he, himself, had rusted for lack of
sword-play, and that, too confident of himself, he had neglected to
preserve his speed in the only way in which a swordsman may
preserve it.</p>
<p>Into his soul crept now the horrible, paralysing anticipation of
defeat and death which in the past he had with such gloating
inspired in others. As he realized it, a change came over his face,
which was grey and smeared with sweat and blood. In his eyes de
Bernis read the despair that told of his conviction of defeat, and
feared that perhaps, as a last treachery, Leach might throw down
his sword in the hope thereby of forcing his men to intervene. Lest
this should happen, de Bernis gave him now no time, but by a
vigorous renewal of the attack compelled him desperately to guard
himself. And now, as in the course of that forlorn defence, the
Captain continued to fall back, de Bernis mocked and insulted him
again.</p>
<p>'Will you stand your ground, you mangy dog? Or must I follow you
round the island in this heat? Name of God! D'ye call yourself a
swordsman? Stand, you cur! Stand for once, and fight!'</p>
<p>Thus apostrophized, fury mounting above his terror, Leach not
merely stood, but bounded forward like a panther, but only to waste
his energy upon space; for de Bernis, side-stepping to avoid his
charge, made him instantly spin upon his feet to meet the thrust
with which from his disengage the Frenchman riposted.</p>
<p>The promptitude of his own recovery from that position of
disadvantage revived Leach's fading courage. It was an evidence of
his strength and skill. He had despaired too soon. There was no
reason for it. He might yet prevail. All that he must abandon was
that hope of reducing, as he had intended, a swordsman so
formidable as this opponent. That, however, was no reason why he
should not succeed in killing him. There were tricks he knew. He
had never yet had reason to have recourse to any one of them. But
he had reason now. He would show this Frenchman something.</p>
<p>In his new-found confidence, he fenced closely until he found
the position he desired, following upon a parried thrust. He
feinted in the high lines, aiming at de Bernis' throat, and as the
Frenchman's blade moved up, Leach went swiftly under his guard, and
with that feline agility he commanded stretched himself in a lunge;
but it was not an ordinary lunge; it was an extension of it in the
Italian manner, in which the whole body of the lunger is parallel
with the ground and supported immediately above it upon his left
hand. Thus, like a snake, almost upon his belly, he sent his point
ripping upward under de Bernis' guard, assured that he must spit
him like a lark, for there is no straight parry that will deflect
such a lunge once it is well launched.</p>
<p>But de Bernis was no longer there when the other's point drove
home. Pivoting slightly to the left, he averted his body by making
in his turn a lunging movement outward upon the left knee. So
hard-driven had Leach made his lunge in his confidence of sending
it home, that, meeting no resistance, he was momentarily off his
balance. A full second at least must be delayed in his recovery.
But that recovery was never made. For in that unguarded second, de
Bernis, whose queer, unacademic movement had placed him low upon
his opponent's flank, passed his sword from side to side through
the Captain's extended body.</p>
<p>There was an outcry simultaneously from the crowd of buccaneers,
then utter silence, as Monsieur de Bernis, having withdrawn his
sword, placing one foot for the purpose against the body of his
fallen opponent, stood erect and grim, breathing a little hard and
mopping the sweat from his brow with the sleeve of his fine cambric
shirt.</p>
<p>Standing over Tom Leach as he lay coughing out his evil life
upon the sands, Monsieur de Bernis ruefully shook his head, and in
the silence his voice rang clear.</p>
<p>'Too fine an end for such as you, my Captain.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>Chapter 19. The Head of Tom
Leach</h2>
<p>The last choking cough of the buccaneer was uttered; the
twitchings of his body had ceased, and he lay on his back grinning
up at the blue sky that was like a dome of polished steel, before
there was any movement in the surrounding crowd. After that single
outcry, when their Captain had gone down, an awed silence had
fallen upon those wild men. Accustomed though they were to scenes
of violence and to sudden and bloody deaths, there was something in
this abrupt passing of their leader to inspire awe in those wild
breasts.</p>
<p>Leach had been of such vitality, and had come scatheless through
so many fierce encounters that he had seemed almost immortal to the
men he led. And here, almost in the twinkling of an eye, behold him
stretched stiff and stark. Wonder, too, now that the thing was
done, was stirring in their minds as to what must be the
consequences to themselves of their Captain's death.</p>
<p>The silence endured until Bundry roughly now broke his way
through the ranks which yielded as readily as earlier they had
resisted him. Ellis and Halliwell followed through the gap his
passage made.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis looked up at their approach. He was not
entirely without alarm, although he contrived to conceal it; but in
the main he conceived himself sufficiently protected by the
circumstances. Standing where he did, with one shoulder to the sea
and the other to the woods, he commanded a wide field of vision.
Twenty yards away and above him on the beach, he beheld Miss
Priscilla and the Major standing at gaze, and he conceived the
fears that must be distressing her, if not on his account, at least
on her own, since even now, if this affair should find issue in the
avenging upon him of the Captain's death, she must suppose that she
would be left at the mercy of these ruffians.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, the buccaneers still made no movement.
Perhaps they considered that the matter was one beyond their
judgement, and they were content to leave it to those four leaders
who were now confronting Monsieur de Bernis within the space they
ringed about. For Wogan was there, too, having been there indeed
throughout the combat, and it was Wogan whom de Bernis immediately
cited as a witness in his own defence when Bundry challenged
him.</p>
<p>'How did this happen?' Bundry had asked, his tone harsh, his
countenance forbidding, his eyes piercing as gimlets.</p>
<p>'It was forced upon me. I take Wogan here to witness.'</p>
<p>Bundry turned to question Wogan with his eyes, and Wogan blinked
nervously and answered, as de Bernis counted that he would answer.
He might have been less confident had he known of the understanding
that had existed between Wogan and the Captain. But the Captain
being dead, Wogan swiftly made up his mind that, since Leach's plot
had failed, it only remained to ensure the preservation of one upon
whom depended the capture of the Spanish plate fleet.</p>
<p>'Aye, it's the truth. Bad cess to it! Ye all know how the
Captain was feeling towards him, and this morning his humour
bubbled over, and he put this quarrel upon him. In fact, as some of
ye may have seen, he attacked him before he had even got his sword
out, and if Charley hadn't been quick and active, it's murder there
would ha' been.'</p>
<p>Encouraged by this to greater self-assertion, Monsieur de Bernis
supplemented that assurance.</p>
<p>'It would have been unlucky for all of you if things had fallen
out otherwise. There would have been no Spanish gold, no broad
pieces of eight for you if Leach had killed me as he intended. The
dog might have thought of you if he had no thought for his own
share of the treasure before yielding to his thirst for my blood.
Well, well!' He touched the body with his foot. 'There he lies as
he deserves, for his treachery to you and to me.'</p>
<p>And Bundry, grim-faced ever, and seeing no profit in going
against de Bernis at present, nodded slowly. 'I warned him. But he
was ever a headstrong fool. Maybe he's best quieted.'</p>
<p>And by the men, who had listened and who had been persuaded by
what they heard, this seemed to be accounted a sufficient funeral
oration, and closed the matter.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis had been reasonably confident that ultimately
he must prevail with them, by means of the prospect of that Spanish
gold. But he had expected at the outset a violent explosion of
passion over the death of their leader, and he had been bracing
himself to meet it. It took him by surprise to discover how little
any such effort would be required of him. In the circumstances in
which it had befallen, Tom Leach's death was no calamity to any of
those predatory rogues who followed him. What mattered was that the
man who was to lead them to fortune had been preserved.</p>
<p>And so, with scarcely a lowering glance to follow him, Monsieur
de Bernis was permitted to sheathe his sword and resume his
garments.</p>
<p>The buccaneers broke up the circle and fell into babbling
groups, busily discussing the event, its details and its
consequences. Already even sounds of laughter began to punctuate
their arguments, whilst the dead man lay there almost at their
feet, staring up at them from glazing eyes. Wogan actually came to
help Monsieur de Bernis into his coat.</p>
<p>They were at some little distance from the others, and Wogan,
with his back to them, muttered so that only de Bernis could hear
him.</p>
<p>'You'll come to the hut presently. We'll be after electing a new
Captain, and you'll be needed.' More softly still he added: 'Ye'll
not be forgetting how I stood your friend, Charley, just now when
ye called upon me, and that but for me ye might be carrion this
minute. Sure, now, didn't your life hang upon my answer?'</p>
<p>'Did it so? I thought it hung upon the Spanish plate fleet. But
if ye covet dead men's shoes, ye may have them for me. I'll follow
presently.'</p>
<p>He turned from the Irishman, and went briskly up the beach to
the three who remained there still at gaze.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla watched his approach with eyes that were almost
of awe. He was so calm, so entirely master of himself, so
apparently unruffled, as if he came from some normal daily task.
Was he made of iron that he could bear himself thus within a few
moments of, himself, facing death and after killing a man?</p>
<p>At closer quarters, when at last he stood before them, she saw
that he was very pale under his tan and she was thankful,
relieved--though she scarcely knew why--to discover in him at least
this sign of feeling.</p>
<p>'I hope that you were not unduly alarmed,' she heard him saying,
in his pleasant, level voice. 'It was my wish that you should be
spared that spectacle.' Then he was addressing the Major, who stood
there goggle-eyed and loose-mouthed with little of his usual colour
in his florid face. 'Our practices were not in vain, you see. I had
a presentiment that I should need them before we left Maldita.'</p>
<p>'Have you...Is he dead?' the Major asked him, stammering.</p>
<p>'I do not do things by halves, Major.'</p>
<p>There was a significance in this that prompted an awed question
from Priscilla.</p>
<p>'You meant to kill him? You sought him for that purpose?'</p>
<p>He sensed the recoil in her. 'It had become necessary. For some
days, indeed. But I had to wait. I had to wait until the time was
ripe for it. It was not easy waiting; for he had become a danger.
Above all, he had become a danger to you, Priscilla.'</p>
<p>'Was that...Was that why you killed him?' she asked in a hushed,
faltering voice.</p>
<p>He considered her gravely an instant before replying. 'Not
entirely. But if it did not supply all the reason, it supplied all
the desire.</p>
<p>Because of you, and because of what he had dared and what he
hoped I killed him without compunction.'</p>
<p>She set a hand upon his arm. At the impulsive gesture, the Major
frowned a little and looked down his nose. But no heed was paid to
him.</p>
<p>'I was afraid--so afraid--that I supplied the only reason. If
you had fallen...' She seemed to choke. When she recovered, she
continued on another thought. 'Afterwards, I was even more afraid.
I thought his men would have torn you in pieces. I still do not
understand. It seemed to me you must be in great danger.'</p>
<p>'I am in danger,' he answered quietly. 'But I was in no danger
there. The danger is still to come.'</p>
<p>As he spoke, Pierre, from a pace or two in the background, leapt
suddenly forward.</p>
<p>'Monsieur!'</p>
<p>De Bernis turned to face the sea. Into view round the shoulder
of the bluff, a cable's length beyond the entrance of the cove came
three tall red ships, sailing almost abreast, and taking in sail as
they majestically advanced into fuller view. Across the water came
the creak of blocks and the rattle of spars.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis appeared to stiffen. 'It has come, this
danger,' he said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>On the beach below them the buccaneers stood staring out across
the lagoon in an utter stricken silence, as if suddenly paralysed.
Thus for a half-dozen heart-beats. Then, as the Union flag broke
from each main-truck, and the ships began to swing into line to
starboard, heading straight for the entrance of the lagoon, it was
as if hell had vomited all its devils onto the shore. Shouting,
cursing, raging all together, the groups broke up and the men ran
this way and that, blindly, aimlessly scattering. Thus had de
Bernis seen rats scamper and run when into the dark hold of a ship
a light had suddenly been lowered.</p>
<p>In that first sudden panic, only a few of them were purposeful
in their flight, and ran deliberately for cover behind the careened
hull of the <i>Black Swan</i>. For the thought in the minds of all
must have been that these heavily armed vessels, obviously hostile,
and probably belonging to Morgan's Jamaica squadron, which for
months had been scouring the seas in quest of Tom Leach, would
presently be sweeping the beach with their guns.</p>
<p>It was Wogan who led the way to cover, whilst Bundry stood and
cursed him for a loathly coward and a fool, who by his very conduct
was betraying them all to observant eyes upon the ships. For Bundry
kept his head, and succeeded, when that first spasm of surprised
terror had spent itself, in recalling the main body of the
buccaneers to their senses and to some semblance of order.</p>
<p>'What's to alarm you, you rats?' he roared at them, straining a
voice that was anything but powerful until it cracked upon his
words. 'What's to alarm you? Whoever these may be, what can they
know of us? What can they see here except a ship careened, and
another riding peacefully at anchor?'</p>
<p>Men paused, steadied themselves, and came clustering about him
to hear him.</p>
<p>'Keep your heads,' he bade them. 'Why should these ships be
hunting us? They may be coming here for fresh water. How should
they have known we are here? Don't you see this is but a chance
arrival? Even if they be Morgan's ships, how should they recognize
the <i>Black Swan</i>, careened as she is? If they see you
scuttling to cover like those who've followed that fool Wogan,
they'll learn the very thing we must conceal from them. Calm, then,
in hell's name. Let 'em land, if so be that wants to. We'll see
where we stand then, and what's to be done.'</p>
<p>Thus he harangued them, and thus restored, gradually, some of
their spilled courage. Ellis and Halliwell, themselves encouraged
by Bundry's obvious common sense, went to his assistance in this
task of restoring order. The buccaneers broke into groups again,
and squatted on the sands or moved now, as if unalarmed, like men
whose consciences are at ease. Thus, until the leading ship, a
powerful vessel of forty guns, being within the neck of the lagoon,
swung broadside on, and revealed open gun-ports with the guns run
out ready for action.</p>
<p>At this the buccaneers fell again to muttering ominously, their
adopted calm dissolving before that menacing sight. Still, Bundry
held them in leash.</p>
<p>'A pox on you, you fools! What if she shows her teeth? What
then? Not knowing who we are or what we may intend, she puts
herself on guard. That's all.'</p>
<p>But, to give him the lie, a white cauliflower of smoke broke
suddenly upon the flank of that leading ship, followed instantly by
the boom of a gun, and simultaneously with this the <i>Centaur</i>
staggered where she rode so peacefully at anchor, and, with a
crash, there was a flight of splinters from her bulwarks where they
had been struck high up by that shot at short range.</p>
<p>A cloud of gulls rose from the bluff, and circled mewing in
affright at this sudden shattering of the silence. And like those
white birds, the buccaneers too started up again in panic from the
calm into which Bundry had laboured to bring them.</p>
<p>A second shot, following hard upon the first, to batter the
bulwarks of the <i>Centaur</i>, riveted them there at gaze,
awe-stricken and momentarily silent, expecting a broadside to
follow that should sink the appropriated merchantman.</p>
<p>But none came. That second shot evoking no response from the
<i>Centaur</i>, her gun-ports remaining closed, and her decks
displaying no sign of life, the newcomer held her fire. She had
taken in sail by now, as had the other two; and in the queer,
uncanny silence rang the rattle of chains and the creaking of
windlasses. They were coming to anchor there in the roadstead,
within a half-dozen cables' length of the shore.</p>
<p>That the buccaneers had to deal with a foe, and with a foe who
was well-informed of their identity, they could doubt no longer in
view of that demonstration against the <i>Centaur</i>. What
particular action would be taken by these ships when they had
anchored, these men could not surmise. But that it would be action
to their undoing they were assured, and in their rage at finding
themselves thus trapped, helpless here ashore, in the very
situation that Leach had always feared, they cast about them for a
scapegoat, as stupid men will in their anger.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that presently there was a surge of them up the
beach to the spot where Monsieur de Bernis was standing, with Miss
Priscilla on his left, the Major on her other side, and Pierre,
with a strained and anxious look on his coppery countenance, in the
immediate background.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis, who never in all his adventurous life had
been more alert and watchful than in the last few moments,
expecting precisely this development, and exercising his wits as to
how to meet the onslaught when it came, drew closer to Miss
Priscilla until his arm touched her shoulder.</p>
<p>'It comes now, this danger,' she heard him murmur. 'Stand firm,
and do not be afraid.'</p>
<p>With that he stepped forward boldly to meet this human wave that
was sweeping forward to engulf him. Very straight he stood, his
chin high, his plumed hat slightly cocked, his left hand resting on
the hilt of his long rapier, so that the weapon standing out behind
him made a right angle with his body.</p>
<p>Wildly clamouring that fierce wave--that mob of close upon two
hundred men--came to break and recoil a little at his very feet. A
sea of angry, evil faces confronted him; curses and foulnesses
almost deafened him; brawny bare arms were outflung towards him;
fists were shaken in his face, and one there was at fairly close
quarters who brandished a machete as if to cut him down.</p>
<p>He stood like a rock before it all, dominating them by his
height and his intrepidity. His voice rang like a trumpet, clear
and sharp, audible even above their howls.</p>
<p>'What's here?' he demanded. 'You fools! Do you attack the only
man with the wit to save you from this danger?'</p>
<p>Their noise fell to a mutter, a rumble as of receding waters,
and presently it was still so that they might hear him before they
made an end of him. Bundry, he saw, was trying to break his way
through to the front rank. And presently that clay-faced, resolute
shipmaster struggled up to him, and there turned to wave the
assailants back. Bundry, after all, had a practical mind. He was
not a man to be swept by passion into blindness. Never in any
situation did he lose sight of the essential thing.</p>
<p>'Wait! Back there!' he croaked at them. 'Give us air! Let's hear
what Charley has to say.' And he turned to de Bernis. 'What are
these ships? Do you know?'</p>
<p>'Don't you? The leader there is the <i>Royal Mary</i>, Morgan's
flagship. They are all three of the Jamaica squadron. We've Morgan
on our hands. Sir Henry Morgan. But he comes too late for what he
seeks. It's Tom Leach he's hunting.'</p>
<p>They roared at him that they, themselves, still remained to be
brought to account, and how did he suppose that they would fare at
Morgan's hands?</p>
<p>'I know how I shall fare,' he answered them, and he actually
laughed as he spoke, though with more than a touch of bitterness.
'There's no doubt at all on that score. No need to be a prophet to
foretell it. So if ye want to cut my throat, so as to thwart Morgan
of the pleasure of hanging me, by my faith, ye're welcome. I dare
say it will be the pleasanter end.'</p>
<p>This reminder that, whatever might betide any of them at
Morgan's hands, he, who had been Morgan's lieutenant, and who,
deserting, had taken to the sea again and gone a-roving in their
company, would certainly meet with no mercy, gave them sudden
pause. Here was something they had overlooked. There was no
argument by which he could have made a stronger appeal to their
sympathy.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, Wogan came sliding through them. He had come
from cover with several fellows at his heels, intent as most of the
men were intent upon making a scapegoat of de Bernis; intent that,
since destruction perhaps awaited most of them, de Bernis should
certainly not escape, but should be the first to pay.</p>
<p>And there he stood, tall and lanky, threshing the air with his
long arms in his excitement as he poured forth his venom.</p>
<p>'Let him talk as he pleases, it's Topgallant Charley we've to
thank for this. It was he brought us here! It's his fault, so it
is, that we're caught with never a keel under us: trapped like rats
in a gin, and helpless at the mercy of Morgan!' He flung out an
accusing arm, so that his hand almost struck Monsieur de Bernis in
the face. 'It's Charley's doing! Bad cess to him!'</p>
<p>With that he thought to destroy de Bernis, and might have
destroyed any man less prompt and resolute. As it was, and as he
was presently to learn, he merely supplied de Bernis with a weapon
at once defensive and offensive.</p>
<p>Before the rage which Wogan fanned in those wild ruffianly souls
could blaze forth, de Bernis was answering him, and by tone and
manner and very words was compelling attention.</p>
<p>'Will you make a scapegoat of me for your own blundering
incompetence, you lubberly oaf?'</p>
<p>He paused upon that question which struck Wogan dumb with
amazement and arrested the attention of all. Then, with an
increasing vehemence, with a simulation of indignation, he went on
to scarify the Irishman.</p>
<p>'If we are helpless as you say, the fault lies between you and
that dead cut-throat Tom Leach whose worthy lieutenant you are. If
either of you had known anything of your trade, there would be guns
emplaced on that bluff with which to have given Morgan a warm
welcome.'</p>
<p>Again he paused, and this time no fear of interruption made him
hurry to resume. He knew that what he had said must whet the men's
appetite for more. It was something that leapt to the eye when
uttered. One and all of them must perceive the force of it, and,
perceiving this, they would wait for his amplification of the
charge he brought, he, the accused, turned suddenly accuser.</p>
<p>'Pardieu! You come bleating here to make it seem that I am to
blame, you numbskull! Ha! Why, you and Tom Leach between you were
never fit to command anything, afloat or ashore! And here's the
proof of it: in the disaster to which we are now betrayed. And you
say it was I. I brought Leach to careen here because there is no
better beach than this for careening in all the Caribbean. But I
did not tell him to take no precautions against surprise. I did not
tell him to pile his guns there on the shore like so much rotten
dunnage.' He pointed to the spot where the guns had been stacked
when first they were landed from the <i>Black Swan</i>. 'How do you
know that I did not warn him? Do you suppose that I did not advise
him to set up earthworks on the bluff there, and mount guns to
command the entrance of the lagoon? We dispose of sixty guns
between the two ships. With those we could have defied the whole
Jamaica squadron. We could have sunk any ship that tried to force
an entrance here. But how did he receive my advice?'</p>
<p>He was never allowed to tell them. For here, Wogan, quivering
with fury, interrupted him. 'It's a lie! Don't be listening to him!
He never advised it at all! It's a lie!'</p>
<p>'Is it?' quoth de Bernis, and now he was actually smiling, if
very grimly. 'We will agree it is a lie. We will agree I never
warned him; I never told him or you that guns should be emplaced
there.' And now his voice suddenly swelled up. 'But, my faith, what
were you doing, what were you and he doing, that you did not think
of it for yourselves? He was the Captain and you were his
lieutenant, Wogan; and between you lay the responsibility for the
safety of your men. How does it happen that neither you nor he
thought of placing this cove in a state of fortification? Can you
shift the blame for that on to any other shoulders? Leach is dead,
and cannot answer. But you are alive, and you can answer. There are
your men: the men who, through your carelessness and incompetent
leadership, are now trapped here as you say. Answer to them, then!
Answer them!'</p>
<p>And from the throats of those buccaneers whom de Bernis'
indictment had lashed into sudden fury came in a raucous roar the
demand: 'Answer! Answer!'</p>
<p>'Holy Virgin!' screamed Wogan, in sudden affright to see the
storm so swiftly and craftily deflected upon his own head. 'Will ye
be listening to this liar? Have ye never heard tell of Topgallant
Charley's artfulness, that ye'll be deceived by it? Will ye be the
dupes of his foxy, cozening tongue? I tell you he's...'</p>
<p>'Tell us why ye mounted no guns on the bluff!' a buccaneer
interrupted him.</p>
<p>'Answer for your cuckoldy self!' cried another, and--'Answer as
he bids you, you son of a slut!' a third demanded, whereafter in a
roar he was assailed by the cry 'Answer! Answer!'</p>
<p>Quaking and livid, he stood before them, accounting himself
lost, seeing himself in fancy already torn to pieces. But de
Bernis, having used Wogan as a lightning conductor so as to deflect
their frenzy from himself, could now afford to despise and spare
him. He stepped forward once more to claim and hold attention.</p>
<p>'Let the fool be!' he admonished them. 'After all, considering
where the blame lies will not save us from this danger. It's how to
meet it we must consider.'</p>
<p>That made them all attentive. He saw the round moon face of
Halliwell turned upon him, and the fiery Ellis at the ponderous
shipmaster's elbow. Bundry, dry and snappy, at his side made an
interjection.</p>
<p>'Faith! It'll need a mort of considering!'</p>
<p>'Courage, Bundry! There's no reason yet to despond.'</p>
<p>'I don't want for courage,' Bundry snapped back. 'But I don't
want for sense either.'</p>
<p>'A man may have both, and yet want for invention,' said de
Bernis.</p>
<p>'If ye can invent anything as'll help us, Charley,' cried
Halliwell, 'we'll follow you to hell after this!' And from the men
came a roar of confirmation to encourage de Bernis. His brow was
dark with thought. He turned his shoulders upon Wogan, who, shaken
and still trembling from the fright he had sustained, had fallen
back a little, and waited white-faced and half-numbed for whatever
might follow now that he had shot his bolt and found it turned into
a boomerang.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis was smiling wistfully as he replied. 'I doubt
if Topgallant Charley will lead any buccaneers after today,
whatever may betide the rest of you. And yet, voyons, it is
possible that I may save myself with you; for you, I think, I
certainly can save.'</p>
<p>There came from that villainous multitude an inarticulate sound
such as is made by a great wave against a rock. It was a gasp
expressive of their incredulity before such an announcement. And
then, as the sound of it was dying down, a gun boomed from the
flagship, to turn them startled towards the sea once more.</p>
<p>The shot had been fired high to draw their attention. The ball
crashed into the palm trees beyond them. And now, as they looked,
they saw the reefed foretopsail being raised and lowered. Monsieur
de Bernis, with his eyes upon that signalling, was quietly
counting.</p>
<p>'It is a call to send a boat.'</p>
<p>They turned to him again for direction. He took command, quite
naturally. 'We must obey, or we shall be swept with langrel. Some
of you launch the longboat. See to it, Halliwell.'</p>
<p>'D'ye want me to go?' quoth Halliwell, aghast.</p>
<p>'No, no. But be launching the boat, so as to let them see that
we are obeying. Thus they will hold their fire. Take your time in
doing it.'</p>
<p>Halliwell picked out six or eight men for the task, and these
reluctantly departed, stifling their curiosity to hear what de
Bernis might have to propose, by what means it was in his mind to
work this miracle he had promised them.</p>
<p>The Frenchman addressed himself particularly to Bundry, but
spoke so that all might hear him.</p>
<p>'You are to remember that there is one thing that Morgan wants,
and that he wants it desperately; one thing that he is seeking, one
thing for which, in the name of the English Crown, he has offered
five hundred pounds. That is what he offers. But if I know him at
all, to secure that thing which so long he has coveted, he would
pay even more; a deal more. It might be possible even to drive such
a bargain with him as would secure the lives and liberty of all of
us in exchange for that one thing. Fortunately we are in a position
to offer him this to him so precious object. It is the head of Tom
Leach.'</p>
<p>Bundry sucked in his breath in surprise. He understood; but he
was mistrustful. Not so the men; there was a stir among them, even
a laugh or two. They perceived a grim humour in such a bargain as
Monsieur de Bernis proposed to drive; an ingenious swindle,
diverting to the rascals that were to profit by its perpetration;
for Morgan was not to know that Leach was dead already.</p>
<p>And then Ellis, stepping forward, showed a difficulty.</p>
<p>'Aye, aye. That may well be. But who's to bear him that offer?
Which of us would be safe in Morgan's lousy hands? I knows the
mangy old wolf of old. If any of us was to go to him with this,
that one'ld never return. Morgan'Id hang him from a yardarm and
demand Tom's head as well. That's if held consent to the bargain at
all.'</p>
<p>'He'll never consent,' said Bundry, with sudden conviction. 'Why
should he? He has us all at his mercy. The old wolf'll ask
unconditional surrender, and you should know it, de Bernis. Ye're a
fool to think otherwise, and we're fools to listen to you.'</p>
<p>There was a momentary start from de Bernis. But he recovered at
once.</p>
<p>'Fools, maybe. But not because you listen. Are you so sure he
has us at his mercy? What if we take to the woods? Will he dare to
land a force and follow us? Has he no ambush to fear? And how long
would he take to starve us into surrender?' He felt about him a
revival of the hope which Bundry had momentarily damped. 'What I
propose may be a forlorn chance. Morgan may utterly reject it, as
you fear. But at least let us try him with this bargain. Remember
how desperately he covets the head of Tom Leach; in what danger he
stands of disgrace with his Government until he gets it.'</p>
<p>The men loudly insisting, Bundry was overborne. He shrugged.
'Very well. But, as Ellis says, who's to bear that message? Which
of us can trust himself in Morgan's hands? Unless we send Wogan.
And, faith, why not? It's Wogan is to blame next to Leach for this
situation.'</p>
<p>'Me?' cried Wogan. 'Rot you, ye swine, Bundry! Ye're as much to
blame yourself!'</p>
<p>'I'm but a shipmaster, not a fighting seaman,' Bundry answered
him.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis interposed. 'Wait! Wait!' He half-turned and
looked at Priscilla, who, with the Major's protecting arm about her
waist, stood there aloof, with all the sense of living through an
ugly, terrifying dream.</p>
<p>'There is my wife,' he said. 'Morgan does not make war on women.
He never did, not even before he came to be Governor of Jamaica.
Nor can he treat a woman as a buccaneer. She will be safe in his
hands. Her brother and my servant Pierre will suffice to man the
longboat and pull her out across the lagoon. That resolves the
difficulty. She shall bear our message, our offer to Morgan: our
lives and liberty, with freedom to depart from here in our ships,
in exchange for the head of Tom Leach.'</p>
<p>'Can ye hope he'll accept?' quoth Bundry, his beady dark eyes
searching the calm face of the Frenchman.</p>
<p>'But why not?' He spoke confidently. 'He looks upon Leach as the
soul and brain of you all. It is his conviction that, if Leach were
taken, this company would disband. Moreover, as I've said--and it
is upon this I stake all--he fears that unless he can shortly
report to the Government that he has made an end of Tom Leach, the
Government may make an end of him.'</p>
<p>There was some muttering and some considering among the men,
some argument between Ellis and Bundry.</p>
<p>But whatever they considered, it certainly played no part in
their deliberations whether Morgan would be as tender of Madame de
Bernis as her husband hoped. If they thought he took too sanguine a
view of that, they did not allow the thought to weigh. What
mattered was that here was someone who would bear the message. What
might afterwards befall her was purely the affair of de Bernis who
had proposed it.</p>
<p>And so in the end it was even with a measure of gratitude, and a
deal of admiration for the wit which had discovered this possible
way of escape, that they urged de Bernis to put his plan into
execution.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>Chapter 20. Sir Henry
Morgan</h2>
<p>Miss Priscilla went down the beach to the boat which Halliwell's
men had launched. She walked between Monsieur de Bernis and Major
Sands, with Ellis and Bundry hanging on either flank, Pierre
following at their heels, and a few of the buccaneers straggling
after them; and she walked as she had walked in dreams, her mind
clouded by a mist of unreality.</p>
<p>Few words had been employed. When the matter was settled between
Monsieur de Bernis and the buccaneers, the Frenchman had stepped up
to her.</p>
<p>'You have heard what is required of you, Priscilla?' he had
said, and he was gently smiling encouragement.</p>
<p>She nodded. 'I have heard,' she said, and there checked, staring
at him, her face blenched, deepest trouble in her clear eyes.</p>
<p>Gravely he answered that look: 'You have nothing to fear. Sir
Henry Morgan will treat you with consideration.'</p>
<p>'I could not suppose that you would send me unless you were
convinced of that,' she answered steadily. Then she asked the
question that revealed the real source of her fear. 'But you?'</p>
<p>'I?' His smile deepened a little. He shrugged. 'I am in the
hands of Fate. I do not think he will treat me unkindly. It depends
now upon you.'</p>
<p>'Upon me?'</p>
<p>'Upon your bearing this message for us and upon how you deliver
it.'</p>
<p>'If that is really so; if this is really for your good, you can
depend upon me indeed.'</p>
<p>He inclined his head in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>'Come, then. We have no time to lose. The boat is ready. I will
recite the message for you as we go.'</p>
<p>Thus they had set out, the Major silent, endeavouring to
preserve a stolidity upon his broad florid countenance, least he
should betray his surprise and satisfaction at beholding the
opening of a door of escape from circumstances which to him had
been intolerable as a nightmare.</p>
<p>As they went, Monsieur de Bernis gave her the terms of the
message she was to deliver, and he desired Major Sands' attention
to it also. They were simply to offer Morgan the head of Tom Leach,
upon which he had placed the price of five hundred pounds, in
exchange for the lives and freedom to depart, at their own leisure
in their own ships, of all those now upon Maldita. If more were
needed, and as an earnest of their good faith and their intention
to quit piracy, they would disarm their ships, and cast their guns
into the sea under Morgan's eyes.</p>
<p>If Morgan would not agree these terms, then let him know that,
abundantly supplied with provisions and ammunition, they would take
to the woods, and if he chose to pursue them there, he would do so
at his peril. In such circumstances, they would be in a position to
hold out indefinitely.</p>
<p>At his request, she repeated the words after him, as did also
Major Sands. Ellis and Bundry nodded their gloomy approval of the
message, and so they came to the wet sand at the water's edge,
where half a dozen men, knee-deep in the sea, held the longboat in
readiness.</p>
<p>Halliwell offered to carry the lady to the boat, the Major and
Pierre could wade for themselves.</p>
<p>But now Priscilla, white and trembling, turned suddenly fully to
face de Bernis, and caught him by the arms above the elbow.</p>
<p>'Charles!' was all that she could say. 'Charles!' But there was
agony in her voice, a haunting fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>He bowed his tall uncovered head, and a smile of encouragement,
sweet and rather wistful, irradiated the swarthy gloom of it.</p>
<p>'Child! I repeat, you have nothing to fear. Nothing. Morgan does
not make war upon women.'</p>
<p>There was a flash that was almost of anger from her eyes. 'Have
you not yet understood that it is not for myself that I am afraid?
Must you always think so meanly of me?'</p>
<p>The smile passed from his face; pain was reflected in it; his
eyes, considering her, grew sad.</p>
<p>'Brave little soul...' he began, and there checked. He turned to
Ellis and Bundry who stood by. 'Sirs, give us leave apart a moment.
It is possible that I may never see her again.'</p>
<p>Ellis made shift to move away. But the cold, calculating Bundry
resolutely stood his ground. He tightened his thin lips, and shook
his head.</p>
<p>'It will not serve, Charley. We know the message that she
carries now. We don't know the message she may carry if you speak
to her apart.'</p>
<p>'You don't trust me?' He seemed genuinely taken aback.</p>
<p>Bundry spat thoughtfully. 'I'ld rather trust myself if it comes
to trusting anybody.'</p>
<p>'But what could I do? What other message could I possibly send?
What bargain could I drive for myself, since that must be what's in
your mind?'</p>
<p>'I don't know. But, not knowing, we'll keep on the safe side.
Come, man. Take your leaves here. What the devil! You're man and
wife, ain't ye? What need to be so coy?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis sighed, and smiled again, a little sadly. 'So,
Priscilla. There is no more to say. It is perhaps just as well.' He
bent and kissed her. It was his intention to kiss her cheek; but
she turned her lips fully to meet his own.</p>
<p>'Charles!' she said again, in that low, anguished voice.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis stepped back, and waved to Halliwell. The
corpulent shipmaster obeying the signal picked her up in his arms,
and waded out to bestow her in the stern-sheets of the waiting
boat. Then the Major and Pierre followed, swung each a leg over the
side, took their places on the thwarts, and got out the sweeps. The
buccaneers gave the boat a forward thrust, and so she was launched
upon her voyage, a little white flag of truce fluttering in her
bows.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis stood with the wavelets rustling at his feet
watching the boat for a little while. Priscilla did not look back.
She sat in the stern-sheets, with her shoulders to the shore, a
little crumpled figure in green. At last he turned, and very
slowly, with his chin sinking into the ruffles at his throat, he
moved up the beach, Bundry and Ellis following him with no word
spoken.</p>
<p>In the longboat Priscilla was softly weeping, so that at last
Pierre, who sat beyond the Major, was moved to comfort her. He
spoke to her over the Major's shoulder.</p>
<p>'Mademoiselle,' he begged her in French, 'do not weep. There is
no need. All will be well with Monsieur de Bernis. He knows what he
is doing. Believe me, all will be well with him.'</p>
<p>'And, anyway,' said the Major, 'it's no great matter if it
isn't.'</p>
<p>Thus he expressed the bitterness aroused in him by that little
scene he had witnessed at the water's edge. It provided a fitting,
exasperating climax to all that he had been constrained to endure
in this past month. It was high time, he thought, to restore things
to their proper places in their lives, high time that Priscilla
should recover the perspective which she appeared, from her latest
conduct, utterly to have lost. The vision of that kiss was
something that haunted the Major, and set his memory shuddering
with horror. Roughly, then, did he attack the business of
correcting the focus of Miss Priscilla's mental sight.</p>
<p>His words certainly had the immediate effect of checking her
tears. Momentarily, at least, her concern, anxiety, and grief were
overcome by indignation. From a white, tear-stained face her eyes
blazed as they encountered the Major's.</p>
<p>'What do you dare to say?' she asked him, with such scornful
anger that he would not have had the temerity to repeat his words
even if she had given him time. 'Is that how you speak of a man who
has placed himself in danger, who has pledged his very life to
ensure our safety, to provide us with a means of escape?'</p>
<p>The Major, meeting resentment with resentment, answered
sullenly.</p>
<p>'I don't perceive that at all. Stab me if I do.'</p>
<p>'You don't? Then you are even more stupid than I have been
supposing you.'</p>
<p>'Priscilla!' He stopped rowing in his unutterable
stupefaction.</p>
<p>Pierre's oars, sweeping rhythmically forward, struck his own
suspended ones, and jarred him unpleasantly, and almost knocked him
off his thwart. But he paid little heed to that. Recovering his
balance mechanically, he sat with fallen jaw and goggling eyes,
staring incredulously at this fledgeling who had dared to say such
a thing to him. It was the end of the world. Only the realization
that, overwrought, she was not responsible for her words enabled
him to condone it. He smiled with the patient, exasperatingly
indulgent amusement of noble minds. 'How rash you are in your
conclusions! You display the intolerance of youth and
inexperience.'</p>
<p>'Better than the mean intolerance of age from which you appear
to be suffering, sir.'</p>
<p>This was a cruel thrust under the Major's guard. But, having
recovered from one stupefaction, he was now prepared for anything.
In the same indulgent tone he continued.</p>
<p>'This pirate fellow is using us for his own ends. If you can't
see that, you must be purblind, Priscilla. Consider the terms of
the message...'</p>
<p>'There is nothing to consider but what he is doing. No
perversity, no meanness, can change the appearance of that. He has
had no thought but to deliver us. It is noble of him. It justifies
all my steady faith in him.'</p>
<p>The Major permitted himself to laugh at this. Looking at his
face, distorted by that sardonic hilarity, she considered it the
most repulsive she had ever seen.</p>
<p>'Noble!' he mocked, and went on to explain his point of view.
'That nobility is rooted in concern for his own skin. Finding
himself caught, this thieving pirate hopes to make terms; and he
counts himself lucky to have us under his hand, so that he may send
us with his message. That's his nobility, as you shall see,
child.'</p>
<p>From behind him came the gentle voice and the imperfect English
of Pierre.</p>
<p>'If Monsieur de Bernis escape himself from t'is, he shall be
tol' what a good opinion you 'ave of him.'</p>
<p>'Why, so he shall! I shall tell him so, myself,' the Major
snorted, in fresh anger at this further opposition.</p>
<p>Ill-humouredly he bent to the oars again, and after that an
angry silence reigned in the boat, Priscilla disdaining to push the
argument further.</p>
<p>In this mood they came bumping alongside of the <i>Royal
Mary</i>, Morgan's flagship, until Pierre, standing at the bows,
steadied the longboat at the foot of the entrance-ladder.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla, disdaining the assistance of the Major's
proffered hand, but accepting that which Pierre extended, was the
first to climb the tall red side of the ship, with Major Sands
following close behind to save her from falling, in case of
need.</p>
<p>At the head of the ladder she was received by a middle-aged,
overdressed man of an almost obese habit of body, whose yellow
fleshly face, adorned by a pair of drooping moustaches, was coarse
and unprepossessing. This was Sir Henry Morgan. From the bulwarks
he had watched her ascent of the accommodation ladder with a
scowling stare. He advanced to hand her down into the waist of the
ship. Having done so he stood back a pace to survey her. Behind
him, beyond the main-hatch stood a score of musketeers drawn up in
file, a youthful-looking officer standing a few paces in front of
them. Like Morgan they, too, stared, when they saw the lady
standing at the head of the accommodation ladder.</p>
<p>'Save us! What's here?' he asked, when he stood level with her
in the waist. 'In God's name, who may you be, madam?'</p>
<p>She answered him steadily. 'I am Priscilla Harradine, daughter of
Sir John Harradine, who was lately Captain-General of the Leeward
Islands.' And she added: 'You will be Sir Henry Morgan?'</p>
<p>He removed his gaudily plumed hat from his heavy periwig, and
made a leg. There was something ponderously sardonic in his manner,
yet with a hint of gallantry behind it, as if in that obese and
sagging body still smouldered embers of the romantic fires of
sprightlier days.</p>
<p>'To serve you, madam. But what may Miss Priscilla Harradine be
doing in the blackguardly company of Tom Leach and his crew? Odd
company that for a Captain-General's daughter.'</p>
<p>'I come as an ambassador, Sir Henry.'</p>
<p>'From those cut-throats? Od rot me, madam! But how do you happen
amongst them?'</p>
<p>The Major who had meanwhile climbed the ladder, and for a moment
had paused at the head of it, stepped down into the waist and
thrust himself forward self-sufficiently. At last he found himself
among men who could not ignore his rank and consequence.</p>
<p>'I am Major Sands,' he announced. 'Major Bartholomew Sands,
second-in-command at Antigua to the late Sir John Harradine.'</p>
<p>The dark eyes of Morgan considered him, and the Major was not
reassured. He found those eyes of a singular, mocking malevolence.
The heavy face, darkened by a frown at the root of the prominent
predatory nose, reflected none of the deference the Major had hoped
to command by the announcement of his name and rank.</p>
<p>'That being so, and Sir John being dead, what the devil are you
doing so far from your command? Were you both kidnapped from
Antigua by any chance? If so, I hadn't heard of it.'</p>
<p>In dignified resentment of Sir Henry's manner, the Major
answered loftily. 'We were on our way to England on a ship named
the <i>Centaur</i>. She's over there.' He pointed to her where she
rode within the lagoon. 'With us travelled a French ruffian named
de Bernis, who once, I believe, was your lieutenant.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' the dull yellow face lighted suddenly with interest. The
sneering malevolence of its expression seemed to deepen. 'That
ruffian de Bernis, eh? Continue, pray.'</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla would here have interrupted the Major. But he
would not be interrupted. He swept on headlong with his tale of the
boarding of the <i>Centaur</i> by Tom Leach, and the manner in
which de Bernis had revealed himself to the pirates. He was still
sketching what had followed and abusively qualifying de Bernis'
name at every mention of it, when Sir Henry, standing before him
with wide-planted feet and arms akimbo, roughly interrupted
him.</p>
<p>'If ye're telling me the truth,' he said, 'seems to me this de
Bernis has saved your lives and perhaps more.'</p>
<p>'<i>If</i> I am telling you the truth?' quoth the Major, with
immense dignity. '<i>If</i> I am telling you the truth, do you say,
Sir Henry? That is very nearly to give me the lie
circumstantial.'</p>
<p>'Devil take your vapours, sir,' Morgan roared at him. 'What
then? Unless you're a liar, you're the meanest pimp I've met in
years.'</p>
<p>The Major, going red and white by turns, drew himself up. 'Sir
Henry, I have the honour to hold the King's commission, and...'</p>
<p>'Why, so have I, sir. So have I. And so has many another
scoundrel. That proves nothing.' He made a repudiating gesture with
an enormous freckled hand. 'We're wasting time. What I desire to
know is how you come here aboard my ship, and why.' He swung to the
lady with a smirk and a bow. 'Perhaps you will tell me, madam.'</p>
<p>Eagerly she complied, glad that the poison Major Sands had been
pouring forth was stemmed at last. 'We bring you a message, Sir
Henry, from Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' He was all attention, ignoring the Major, who had fallen
back, and livid with anger was biting his lip.</p>
<p>'An offer of terms, Sir Henry.'</p>
<p>'Terms?' He blew out his enormous cheeks. 'Terms!' He turned
with a hoarse, fat laugh to the officer behind him. 'There's
impudence! An offer of terms when we have them at the
pistol-muzzle. Well, well! A God's name! What are these terms?'</p>
<p>She began to explain to him, as she had been instructed, that
the buccaneers were not quite at the pistol-muzzle; that they could
take to the woods, where they might not be followed save at great
peril. She was still eloquently at this when he interrupted her, a
rude, overbearing man.</p>
<p>'The terms! The terms!' he demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>She stated them. Monsieur de Bernis offered to give up Tom
Leach, alive or dead, to disarm the ships and fling their guns into
the sea, in return for the honours of war in other respects and
freedom for the buccaneers to depart in their own time. Those were
the terms. But she did more than state them; her tone pleaded for
their acceptance as if she were advocating the cause of Monsieur de
Bernis.</p>
<p>The dark eyes embedded in those bulging cheeks watched her
curiously the while, the keen ears and keen wits missing nothing.
Then Sir Henry looked at the livid Major, leaning with affectations
of wounded dignity against the bulwarks, and under cover of his
drooping moustache his heavy lips writhed with sardonic mirth.</p>
<p>'The honours of war!' he echoed slowly, a man infinitely
amused.</p>
<p>It provoked from her a resumption of the argument of what the
buccaneers could still do if their terms were not accepted. This
time he listened to her, the fleshly face creased in a sly
amusement that she found almost exasperating. This fat, oily,
sinister man was without mercy; a man who loved cruelty for its own
sake. She saw this plainly, and yet, faint and nauseated, she
gallantly held her ground before him, fighting the battle of
Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>'Ah!' he said, when she had done. 'Madam, you are well delivered
out of your dangers, and so are you, Major. I congratulate you both
upon that. It is no wonder, madam, that you plead the case of that
rascal de Bernis so eloquently. I perceive and respect the
gratitude that moves you.'</p>
<p>'And you will agree his terms?' In her eagerness she stepped
close up to him.</p>
<p>He smiled down upon her, and again there was in his manner that
hint of gallantry. Then his eyes travelled beyond her to the Major.
'You, sir, are not so deeply concerned, I think?'</p>
<p>'At the risk of being misunderstood again,' the Major answered
importantly, 'I must confess that I am not. Right is right, and
wrong is wrong. I have a clear perception, I hope, of one and the
other. As for gratitude, I do not perceive the occasion for it.
This fellow de Bernis has found us convenient tools for his work.
There was no man of all that crew of cut-throats who would have
ventured within your reach to deliver his message.'</p>
<p>The great body shook with sudden laughter. 'That I can believe,
by God! They've a respect for my yardarms. You may be right, Major.
You may be right.' He turned abruptly to the young officer in
command of the musketeers.</p>
<p>'Take a dozen men, Sharples, and go ashore with a white flag.
Tell those sons of dogs that before I'll so much as discuss terms
with them, I demand the surrender, not only of Tom Leach, but of
this rascal de Bernis as well. When I have those two aboard here,
I'll consider what's to do. Not before. And tell them that my guns
are trained on the beach, and that if I see any sign of a movement
towards the woods, I'll sweep them to hell with langrel. Is that
clear? Away with you.'</p>
<p>The fair-faced lieutenant's salute was eloquent of
understanding. His fresh young voice rang out in a sharp command.
Musketeers stepped briskly forward in obedience, and filed towards
the entrance-ladder.</p>
<p>The Major was smiling. For this he could forgive Morgan
everything. The fellow might be a rude scoundrelly turncoat pirate,
but he knew how to handle a situation.</p>
<p>Miss Priscilla, white now to the lips, took a stumbling step
towards Sir Henry, and laid a timid, trembling hand upon his
massive arm.</p>
<p>'Sir...Sir...' she stammered pleadingly.</p>
<p>Peremptorily the stout gentleman waved his officer away, and
turned to hear her. 'Your servant, madam.'</p>
<p>'Sir, what the Major has said is scarcely true. I am sure that,
in sending us, Monsieur de Bernis' main thought was to deliver us
from danger. I owe so much to him...so very much. He has behaved so
gallantly...so gallantly...'</p>
<p>Sir Henry laughed a deep, throaty laugh that made her shudder.
Then he frowned and the frown brought back that evil, sinister
wrinkle to the base of his nose.</p>
<p>'Oh, oh! To be sure. To be sure. Vastly gallant fellows these
Frenchmen. And who more gallant than de Bernis? Oh, I'll be sworn
he behaved gallantly. He was never the man to waste opportunities.'
And Sir Henry winked at the Major, who thought him a fellow of
unspeakable vulgarity and accounted it an outrage that such a man
should hold a knighthood and a governorship.</p>
<p>'Sir, you misunderstand me!' cried Priscilla, distraught.</p>
<p>'Not I, madam. Not I. That ruffian de Bernis was never the man
to waste his opportunities, any more than I was when I was no
better than is he. I understand perfectly. May I be flayed else.
Oh, and sympathetically. I grow fat and old, madam; but I carry a
young heart under all this blubber.'</p>
<p>She thought him disgusting, and she shuddered under his leering
eyes. But bravely she stifled her feelings.</p>
<p>'Sir Henry, I desire you to hear me. I implore you to hear
me.'</p>
<p>'Be sure, ma'am, that beauty never implored Harry Morgan in
vain.' He seemed to laugh inwardly, as if at memories. 'You would
say, madam?'</p>
<p>'It is of Monsieur de Bernis, sir. I owe life and more than life
to him...'</p>
<p>'Why, so I had understood.' The dark eyes twinkled odiously. She
ignored the interruption. 'My father was a loyal and valued servant
of the Crown. Surely, Sir...Surely the service rendered by Monsieur
de Bernis to my father's daughter should weigh for something in his
favour. Should be accounted to him in any judgement.'</p>
<p>He considered her with mock-gravity. Then the horrible fellow
was moved again to mirth. 'It's a romantical plea and a novel. Od's
heart! I rendered in my day services to many a father's daughter;
but none ever counted them to my credit. I lacked your advocacy,
madam.' He was turning away.</p>
<p>'But, Sir Henry...' She began again in desperation.</p>
<p>But Sir Henry could not stay. 'No more now, madam.'
Unceremoniously he turned on his heel, and rolled away on his
elephantine legs, bawling for bos'n and gunner, and issuing orders
right and left.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>Chapter 21. The Surrender</h2>
<p>In miserable dejection Miss Priscilla watched the hands mustered
for shore go over the side, followed by Lieutenant Sharples. From
the bulwarks she saw them board the longboat in which Pierre
waited, saw it cast off and draw away towards the beach.</p>
<p>An officer came to her with Sir Henry's compliments and would
she and Major Sands accept the Admiral's hospitality in the great
cabin.</p>
<p>Major Sands supported the invitation kindly, gentle concern now
replacing in him an indignation which he perceived could nothing
profit him.</p>
<p>Moreover a link between them that had almost snapped was
restored by his sense that they were fellow victims of the
overbearing vulgarity of that pirate-knight Sir Henry Morgan. Then,
too, the Major was disposed to be magnanimous and to forgive all
offence out of regard for the fact that the offender was a woman,
young and tender, who had been tried beyond all endurance. It was
therefore in a tone of solicitude that he said:</p>
<p>'You will be better in the cabin, Priscilla.'</p>
<p>'I thank-you,' she answered coldly. 'I am well enough here.'</p>
<p>The officer bowed and withdrew. She remained leaning on the
bulwarks, her gaze following the boat in its swift journey towards
the beach, where the buccaneers waited. She could make out quite
clearly amongst them, well in the foreground, the tall, commanding
figure of Monsieur de Bernis. Bundry Halliwell, and Ellis were with
him, and the four of them made a group apart from the rest.</p>
<p>Major Sands stood at her elbow. 'My dear Priscilla, this is the
end of the adventure, and we have deep cause for thankfulness that
it should end so. Deep cause.'</p>
<p>'We have,' she miserably agreed with him. 'For thankfulness to
Charles de Bernis.'</p>
<p>This was not at all the answer he desired. But he realized the
futility of argument with a mind obsessed and obstinate. It could
lead only to acrimony, and acrimony was the last thing the Major
desired between them. He could afford, after all, he reflected, to
be generous. The nightmare composed of all the happenings since
they had first seen de Bernis climbing the accommodation ladder of
the <i>Centaur</i> in Fort Royal Bay, a month ago, was now at an
end. Soon, now this swaggering, posturing pirate would pay the
price of his misdeeds; they would be on their way to England at
last, with all this happily behind them, an ugly, fantastic
interlude in their well-ordered lives which time would rapidly
erase from the tablets of their memories. Priscilla would be
restored to the sanity disturbed in her by the passage across her
tender life of that ruffling filibuster. Magnanimously Major Sands
would forget the incident, and all would be again as it had been
before this disastrous adventure.</p>
<p>Thus Major Sands reassured himself and took confident comfort,
whilst Miss Priscilla watched the boat's progress towards land.</p>
<p>Its keel grated on the fine shingle, and Lieutenant Sharples
stepped ashore alone, leaving his musketeers in the boat with their
firelocks at the ready. Miss Priscilla could distinctly make out
the officer in his long red coat, standing stiffly before Monsieur
de Bernis and his three companions. In the background the main body
of the buccaneers was assembled. They were drawn up with some
semblance of order in their ranks, and it was obvious that they
were attentive to what was passing between their leaders and the
representative of Sir Henry Morgan.</p>
<p>In this group it was clear that the Lieutenant's message was
creating some excitement. Bundry, Ellis, and Halliwell appeared to
be talking all at once and with some violence of gesture. Monsieur
de Bernis remained a little aloof looking on whilst his own fate
was being decided. One only attempt he had made to sway the
decision, and that was when first Lieutenant Sharples had delivered
Morgan's message, demanding de Bernis' own surrender. With some
heat he had taken it upon himself to reply, as well he might since
he was concerned so closely.</p>
<p>'Go you back to Morgan,' he had said before any of the others
had time to speak, 'and tell him that if that's his last word, we
can take to the woods and...'</p>
<p>There, however, he had been interrupted by Halliwell. Thrusting
him aside almost roughly with his elbow, the corpulent shipmaster
had stepped forward.</p>
<p>'Hell!' he had growled. 'There's no sense in that. Morgan can
sink the <i>Centaur</i> and riddle the <i>Black Swan</i> until
she's just a wreck of timber, leaving us here to rot and maybe
starve.'</p>
<p>'Steady! Steady!' Bundry had interposed. 'We're not so easily
snuffed. We've timber in plenty and the means and the ability to
build.'</p>
<p>'You would be wise to remember that Sir Henry is a determined
man,' the Lieutenant had stiffly answered. 'You will not defeat him
so easily, as you should know. If you defy him, be sure that he
will leave a ship here to harass you, and to see that not one of
you departs the island. Your only hope lies in compliance now.
Deliver up Leach and de Bernis, and you may find Sir Henry merciful
to the rest of you. But those two he will have; and he'll certainly
have the rest of you as well, if you attempt to resist him.'</p>
<p>Argument followed. Wogan whiningly supported Sir Henry's envoy.
'Och now, what else can we do but comply? Sure, it's a hateful
thing, so it is, to surrender Charley. But when it's either that or
surrendering every mother's son of us, what choice have we?'</p>
<p>'And that's the plaguey fact,' Halliwell cordially agreed.</p>
<p>But Bundry, of tougher fibre and further vision, was for
resistance. If he could keep de Bernis with them and with their
ships unimpaired, even if they lost their guns, they might still
try conclusions with the Spanish plate ships. Buccaneers had
overcome far heavier odds in their time. So cursing his companions
for a pair of spiritless rats, he pleaded that Morgan should remain
content with Leach only. Leach they would surrender at once. Ellis,
swayed by him, supplemented his arguments. But the Lieutenant
remained unmoved. He answered shortly that he had no authority to
haggle or parley, that he had delivered his message, and that the
rest was their affair. It was in vain that Bundry and Ellis begged
him at least to carry their answer to Morgan. Lieutenant Sharples
declared it idle. The very lack of unanimity amongst them
strengthened his determination. Finally he summoned them to make up
their minds without further delay; and threatening to depart and
leave them to their fate, he finally broke down their
resistance.</p>
<p>Bundry turned his clay-coloured face to de Bernis, thrusting out
a lip and shrugging his disgust.</p>
<p>'I've done what I could, Charley. You've heard.'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis was very solemn. 'I've heard. I understand.
It is finished, then.' He, too, shrugged. 'The fortune of war.'
Himself he lifted over his head the silver-encrusted baldrick that
carried his sword, and proffered it to Sharples in token of
surrender.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant took it, inclining his head a little in
acknowledgement, and handed it to one of his men who stood by the
bow of the stranded longboat.</p>
<p>'And now Tom Leach, if you please,' he said, looking round as he
spoke, wondering, perhaps, that he had not yet seen that
redoubtable pirate, and that he should not have been present at
this parley.</p>
<p>'Ah, yes,' said Bundry grimly. 'Tom Leach, to be sure.' He
hesitated a moment, his piercing eyes upon the fair young face of
the lieutenant. 'Dead or alive was the condition,' he said, between
question and assertion.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Sharples stared. 'What? Is he dead already?'</p>
<p>Bundry nodded, turned, and started off up the beach towards the
massed buccaneers and what lay behind them, screened by them.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis went after him, caught and held him a moment
by the shoulder whilst he murmured something to him. It was
something that made that pallid mask momentarily change its set
expression. Then, with a grin and a nod, Bundry went on, and de
Bernis came slowly back, and at a word from Sharples entered the
waiting boat.</p>
<p>Watching ever from the red bulwarks of the <i>Royal Mary</i>,
Priscilla saw and understood. A little moan escaped her.</p>
<p>'The cowards! The treacherous cowards!' she cried. 'They have
surrendered him. Surrendered him to save their vile skins.'</p>
<p>The Major, careful to betray no satisfaction, answered
colourlessly 'Naturally. Could anything else have been expected of
them?' He set an arm about her to steady and comfort her as she
faltered there, suddenly overcome, her senses swimming.</p>
<p>Tenderly he supported her as far as the main-hatch, and gently
lowered her to sit upon the coaming. There, with her elbows on her
knees, she took her head in her hands, abandoning herself to silent
misery. The Major sat down beside her, and his arm was soothingly
placed again about her shoulders. He could go so far as to stifle
jealous resentment of this overwhelming grief. But he had no
consoling words to offer her.</p>
<p>An officer, pacing by the rail of the quarter-deck, looked down
upon them, as did, too, from the other side, some of the hands
lounging on the forecastle. But Miss Priscilla heeded nobody and
nothing. Grief and horror dazed her senses. It was as if some part
of her had been violently wrenched away.</p>
<p>She was aroused at last by the gusty passage of the large gaudy
figure of the Admiral, who crossed the waist with elephantine
tread, a couple of men following him. As in a dream she remembered
having just heard someone say that Sharples was returning. She
looked up to see Sir Henry reach the bulwarks and then she heard
his brazen voice raised in passion.</p>
<p>'Where the hell's Leach, then? Sharples hasn't got him, after
all. Damn him for a fool! Below there, Aldersly. Bid Benjamin stand
by with his gun-crew. He'll be needed in a moment. I'll sweep them
all to hell! I'll teach the dogs! Do they think they can get gay
with Henry Morgan?'</p>
<p>He leaned far over the bulwarks to speak to someone immediately
below.</p>
<p>'What the devil's this, Sharples? Where's Tom Leach?'</p>
<p>'A moment, Sir Henry!' sang the Lieutenant's voice from
below.</p>
<p>The boat scraped and bumped against the sides of the <i>Royal
Mary</i> as it brought up at the foot of the ladder. A pause
followed, and then the staring, fearful eyes of Priscilla beheld
the figure of Monsieur de Bernis gradually rising above the
bulwarks, until he stood there, steadying himself by a ratline, at
the head of the entrance-ladder. Calm and smiling, as she had ever
known him in the face of every peril, did he now appear. It was
incredible that a man should meet his fate so gallantly.</p>
<p>Sir Henry, standing below him and a little aside, looked up to
meet the Frenchman's debonair smile with a scowl, whilst the head
and shoulders of de Bernis' servant Pierre began to come into view
as he climbed close in his master's wake.</p>
<p>'Where the hell is Leach, then?' Sir Henry trumpeted. 'What does
this mean?'</p>
<p>Steadying himself ever by the ratline, Monsieur de Bernis
half-turned to Pierre, and held out his left hand. The half-caste
proffered him a bundle in coarse sailcloth, the natural grey of
which was smeared and stained with blood. Monsieur de Bernis took
it, balanced it a moment, and then tossed it forward. It fell at
Sir Henry's feet, with a soft thud. The Admiral looked down at it,
and then up at Monsieur de Bernis, frowning.</p>
<p>'That is all of him you need,' said Monsieur de Bernis. 'All of
him you asked for. The head, on which you set the price of five
hundred pounds.'</p>
<p>Sir Henry breathed gustily. 'Good God!' His face empurpled. He
looked down again at the gruesome bundle from which a stain was
slowly spreading on the yellow deck. Then he touched it with a foot
that was shod in a gaudily rosetted shoe. He touched it gingerly at
first, then kicked it vigorously aside.</p>
<p>'Take that away!' he roared to one of the men who attended him,
and upon that gave his attention once more to de Bernis.</p>
<p>'Ye're damned literal, Charles,' he snorted.</p>
<p>De Bernis leapt lightly down to the deck.</p>
<p>'Which is only another way of saying that I am as good as my
word. Or as good as my boast, if you prefer it. It needs a thief to
catch a thief, as Major Sands there thinks they knew who made you
Governor of Jamaica.'</p>
<p>Sir Henry looked across at Major Sands where he had come to his
feet in his bewilderment. He stood beside Miss Priscilla, who
remained seated staring, scarcely daring to believe what was
suddenly being made plain at least in part.</p>
<p>'Oh? Him!' said Sir Henry. 'He thinks that, does he? Bah!' And
he shrugged the pompous Major out of his further consideration.
'We've other things to think of. There's a deal here that needs to
be explained.'</p>
<p>'You shall have all the explanation you could wish when you've
paid me the five hundred for that head, and the other five hundred
you wagered me that I could not get it for you.'</p>
<p>Morgan made a wry face. 'Aye. You never doubt yourself, do you,
Charles?'</p>
<p>'I've never had occasion to. But I have been doubting you for
three mortal days. Three days late you are at the rendezvous here,
and for three days I've been in hell from anxiety, and forced to
endure that dead dog's intolerable insults. But I paid him in full
when you hove in sight this morning. It was necessary, too, so that
I might be literal, as you say.'</p>
<p>'We are quits on that, anyway,' grumbled Morgan. 'For ye'ld be
in mortal anxiety now but for my stratagem to bring you safely out
of their hands. Where would ye be if I hadn't demanded that they
should give you up?'</p>
<p>'Where I should deserve to be for trusting to a fool. For only a
fool would have overlooked anything so obvious.'</p>
<p>Morgan blew out his cheeks. 'Oddsfish! I've never known the like
of your assurance.'</p>
<p>'Don't I justify it? Have I done less than I undertook?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I'll confess to that. Be damned to you. I take it luck
favoured you.'</p>
<p>'A little. It saved me the trouble of going after Leach as I
intended. He just came blundering across my path whilst I was on my
way to Guadeloupe. But it would have made no difference if he
hadn't, except that I've saved the Government the expense of
fitting a ship in which to go looking for him.'</p>
<p>'Come below,' said Morgan. 'I want to hear about it.'</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>Chapter 22. The Madness of
Priscilla</h2>
<p>In the great cabin of the <i>Royal Mary</i> sat Miss Priscilla
with Major Sands, Sir Henry Morgan, and Monsieur de Bernis. It was
by the Frenchman's request that those other two had been brought
below, so that they might learn at the same time what yet remained
to be learnt in explanation of events which they had so closely
shared.</p>
<p>They were seated about the table, and with them sat Captain
Aldridge, a spare, lantern-jawed, middle-aged man of a sallow
complexion, who, under the Admiral, Sir Henry Morgan, commanded the
<i>Royal Mary</i>.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis was quietly talking, giving them closer
details of the adventure and of the manner in which he had gone
about carrying out his undertaking to secure the coveted head of
Tom Leach.</p>
<p>Priscilla, so abruptly lifted out of her terrible apprehensions,
sat with senses still swimming from the shocks they had sustained
that morning, scarcely daring to credit what she heard and what she
had seen. Major Sands was wrapped in gloom. His feelings were mixed
and fraught with apprehensions. He could not even pretend that he
rejoiced in this solution, although he could scarcely yet analyse
his true feelings.</p>
<p>Morgan alone was in high glee, despite the fact that he had lost
a wager of five hundred pounds. Relieved of the shadow that had
been hanging over him, the dread of drastic action against him at
Whitehall if Tom Leach were to continue his ravages upon the seas,
he was boisterously hilarious. Once or twice he interrupted the
narrative with ribald comments delivered in explosions of laughter,
and in the sing-song tones that proclaimed his Welsh origin.</p>
<p>He was loudest in his hilarity when de Bernis gave him the facts
of the boarding of the <i>Centaur</i> by Leach and the manner in
which he had met the pirate.</p>
<p>'Oddsfish! If ever there was a rogue who knew how to pluck
victory from defeat, how to win advantage from disaster, you are
that rogue, indeed, Charles. It's not the first time ye've pushed
back the springs of a gin that held ye. Ye may thank the ready
fertility of your lying. Faith! Ye've a great gift of it,
whatever.'</p>
<p>'If ye mean the fable of the Spanish plate fleet,' said de
Bernis, 'you are not to suppose that was an invention of the
moment. It had been long premeditated. It was the lure with which
from the outset I had meant to draw Leach to Maldita. The fact that
he was in need of careening was no more than I expected of him. He
always was; for he was always a bad seaman.'</p>
<p>When the tale was done, and whilst Sir Henry was ladling out a
punch of rum and limes and sugar which the steward had prepared for
them, Captain Aldridge stirred in his chair to ask a question.</p>
<p>'You have made all clear but one thing. What I don't understand
is why you should have fought Leach this morning when we were
already off Maldita. Since you knew that we had but to close our
grip so as to hold him, why the devil should you have risked your
life against him?'</p>
<p>'Risk?' Monsieur de Bernis was contemptuous. 'That was no risk.
Leach may have been a swordsman to pirates; to a swordsman he was
just a pirate.'</p>
<p>'Ye'll need a better answer, Charles,' Morgan admonished him.
For once de Bernis appeared self-conscious. He hesitated; then
shrugged.</p>
<p>'Oh, there were reasons, of course. For one thing I owed it to
him.' Almost unconsciously his dark eyes travelled to Priscilla,
who was steadily regarding him, then back again to Morgan's great
yellow countenance. 'He had used expressions to be answered in no
other way, and he had done things payment for which I choose to
regard as my personal concern. Besides, Morgan, if Leach had been
alive when you hove in sight, be sure there would have been no such
tame surrender. His was a very desperate spirit.'</p>
<p>'Ah, bah! What could he have done, trapped here?'</p>
<p>'He could have taken to the woods with his men, just as I told
you in the message Miss Priscilla bore you; and there you could not
have pursued him. He might have lived to recommence. Even if he did
not, before he came by his end he might have wrought such evil as I
must have accounted beyond repair.'</p>
<p>'Why, what could he have done? What evil?' Morgan pressed
him.</p>
<p>Again Monsieur de Bernis hesitated a little. Then, with an
abrupt gesture, he indicated Major Sands and Miss Priscilla
Harradine.</p>
<p>'This gentleman and this lady would have remained in his hands
if he had chosen defiance. And that from the nature of him he
certainly would have chosen.'</p>
<p>Morgan's brows went up, as he looked at the Major. It was as if
he marvelled that de Bernis should have been moved to risks for
that popinjay. But they came down again when his glance travelled
on to Miss Priscilla. He guffawed his sudden understanding, and
slapped the table with his great hand.</p>
<p>'So! So! Damme, it becomes plain. There was a rivalry between
ye. Madam said you had been mighty gallant.'</p>
<p>His elephantine body shook with laughter. The roar of it
reverberated through the cabin. The Major coughed and scowled. Miss
Priscilla's face flamed scarlet, and her troubled, indignant eyes
reproved the indecent mirth. The lean, leathern face of Aldridge
was distended in a sour grin.</p>
<p>Only Monsieur de Bernis remained entirely impassive. He waited
patiently until the Admiral's laughter had diminished. Then he
spoke icily.</p>
<p>'The King may have made you a knight and he may have made you
Governor of Jamaica; but in spite of it, Morgan, you remain just
what God made you, and why He should have made you at all remains
inscrutable. Pray pay no heed to him, Priscilla. Though he sits in
the cabin, by his manners his proper place is the forecastle.'</p>
<p>'Damn your sour tongue, whatever!' Morgan answered him, without
malice, laughter still bubbling in him. He raised his glass to the
lady. 'No offence, ma'am. My homage to you. I toast your happy
deliverance, oh, and yours, Major Shore.'</p>
<p>'Major Sands, sir,' snapped the soldier, looking his disgust of
the old buccaneer.</p>
<p>'Same thing,' laughed Morgan, to increase that disgust.</p>
<p>Captain Aldridge cleared his throat, and sat squarely to the
table. 'Shall we come to business, Sir Henry? What's to be done
with these rascals ashore?'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes, indeed. To be sure.' He looked at de Bernis. 'What
should you say, Charles?'</p>
<p>Monsieur de Bernis answered promptly. 'First send a crew to take
possession of the <i>Centaur</i> and repair the damage you've done
to her. Then order the guns of the <i>Black Swan</i> to be hauled
to the head of the bluff and cast into the sea. When that's done,
open fire on the hull where she lies careened ashore, and demolish
her. After that we can go home.'</p>
<p>'And leave those cut-throats free?' cried Aldridge,
scandalized.</p>
<p>Nor was he the only one to experience that emotion. The Major,
emboldened by a gust of indignation, ventured to interpose.</p>
<p>'That is the advice of a pirate! Stab me, it is! The advice of a
pirate! Monsieur de Bernis has the fellow-feeling of one buccaneer
for another. That's plain.'</p>
<p>An utter silence of amazement followed that explosion. Very
slowly Sir Henry Morgan turned his eyes upon the speaker. He slewed
his bulk round on his chair, so that he might the more squarely
confront the soldier.</p>
<p>'And who the devil desired your views?' he asked.</p>
<p>The Major got up in a heat, outraged that any one of these
ruffians should take such a tone with him. 'You seem to overlook,
sir, that I hold the King's commission, and that...'</p>
<p>'Hold what the hell you please, sir,' Morgan trumpeted to
interrupt him. 'I ask you how the devil this concerns you?'</p>
<p>'I am telling you, sir, that I hold the King's commission.'</p>
<p>'The King has my sympathy, by God! Sit down, man. You're
interrupting business. Sit down!'</p>
<p>But the Major was not disposed to be browbeaten, particularly in
the presence of Miss Priscilla. Circumstances of late had compelled
him to submit to play a part in which there was no glory and little
dignity. But from those circumstances he was now happily delivered.
He was no longer on an island, at the mercy of a gang of
cut-throats; but on board a vessel of the Crown, where his rank
must be recognized and respected, so that he insisted upon his
due.</p>
<p>'You shall hear me, sir,' he answered, and was not deterred by
the deepening scowl on Sir Henry's brow. 'It is my right to be
heard. My right. As an officer of the Crown it is my duty to
protest--to protest with all the vehemence at my command--against a
proposal which is nothing short of dishonouring to the King's
Majesty.'</p>
<p>Sir Henry, glooming up at him, with a heavy sneer that not even
his heavy moustaches could conceal, spoke with ominous quiet in the
pause the Major made. 'Have ye done, sir?'</p>
<p>'I have not yet begun,' he was answered.</p>
<p>'That was but the exordium,' said de Bernis.</p>
<p>But Morgan crashed his fist down on the table. 'Must I remind
you, Major, that by the rank ye're flaunting you owe me obedience?
You'll speak when you're bidden.'</p>
<p>'You forget, sir...'</p>
<p>'I forget nothing,' Sir Henry bawled. 'Sit down, sir, as I bid
you. Show me defiance and--Od's my life!--I'll have you in irons.
Sit down!'</p>
<p>The Major's prominent eyes still looked defiance for a second.
Then they faltered under the overbearing gaze of Sir Henry. With a
contemptuous shrug he flung himself into his chair again, at some
little distance from the table and crossed his legs.</p>
<p>Sir Henry turned to de Bernis.</p>
<p>'Now, Charles?'</p>
<p>'Captain Aldridge thinks we should not leave the crew of the
<i>Black Swan</i> at liberty. But I perceive no danger or
inconvenience in that. Marooned here, without ship or guns, their
leader dead, they are rendered harmless enough. If eventually they
get away, they are hardly likely to recommence. The lesson will
have been too severe.'</p>
<p>'Faith, I am disposed to agree with you,' said Morgan, and as he
spoke he cast a malevolent glance at the Major. What next he added
leads us to suspect that the Major's presumptuous opposition may
have helped to dispose Sir Henry to agree. 'And that in spite of
the opinions of Major Beach.'</p>
<p>The Major irritably uncrossed his legs, and sat forward. 'I have
told you, sir, that my name is Sands.'</p>
<p>'Well?' Morgan leered at him. 'Beach is Sands, isn't it?' He got
up. 'Come on, Aldridge. Let's to work. We'll take Charles' advice.
It's the easiest way to end the matter.'</p>
<p>Aldridge rose to accompany him. As he was turning to go, the
Admiral paused to speak to Miss Priscilla. 'I'll send my steward to
prepare quarters for you, and for you, Charles, and you,
Major.'</p>
<p>The Major and de Bernis had both risen. The Major bowed with
cold and distant formality. But Monsieur de Bernis had a word to
say.</p>
<p>'If you will give me leave, Morgan, I will travel back to
Jamaica on one of the other ships. Perhaps I might take charge of
the <i>Centaur</i> for you.'</p>
<p>Morgan stared at him, and then from him to the others. Almost
despite himself, a little gasp of relief had escaped the Major,
whilst Miss Priscilla had suddenly looked up and on her countenance
there had been a momentary expression of bewildered dismay. Sir
Henry thrust out a heavy lip, stroked his long moustache
reflectively for an instant. 'What the devil...' he was beginning.
Then he shrugged.</p>
<p>'Oh, but just as you please, Charles. Just as you please. Come,
Aldridge.'</p>
<p>He rolled out of the cabin with the lean Captain following at
his heels, leaving Monsieur de Bernis alone with his two fellow
adventurers. Before he could utter the expressions for which he was
seeking words, Miss Priscilla had risen. She was very quiet, very
pale.</p>
<p>'Bart,' she said, 'would you oblige me by going on deck for a
while?'</p>
<p>The Major started forward briskly, proffering his arm. 'My
dear!' he exclaimed.</p>
<p>She shook her head. 'No, no. I mean you to go alone. I have a
word to say to Monsieur de Bernis.'</p>
<p>His jaw fell. 'You have a word to say to him? What word? To what
purpose?'</p>
<p>'To my purposes, Bart. Does it not seem to you that there is
something to be said between us after all that has happened? I
think you, yourself, might find something to say to him. We are a
little in his debt, I think. Don't you?'</p>
<p>The Major was in confusion. Emotions conflicted in him.</p>
<p>'To be sure, my obligation to Monsieur de Bernis is...very real.
Stab me, very real! I confess that I have been mistook in him. At
least to some extent. And...'</p>
<p>'Please say no more,' Monsieur de Bernis checked him. 'You will
only make matters worse.'</p>
<p>'You may say it afterwards,' Miss Priscilla added. 'Pray leave
us now.'</p>
<p>'But...' Major Sands hung there, racked by misgivings. 'But do
you think...Surely you can have nothing to say to Monsieur de
Bernis to which I cannot be a witness, in which I cannot join. It
is no more than natural, my dear Priscilla, that I should wish to
unite with you in expressing...'</p>
<p>'I have something to say in which you cannot join me, Bart. In
which you are not concerned at all.'</p>
<p>Alarm painted a foolish look upon his face. 'But surely,
Priscilla...'</p>
<p>'Oh, please go! Please go!' Her tone grew impatient.</p>
<p>He spread his hands. 'Very well. If it is your wish. Monsieur de
Bernis, I am sure, will not abuse the situation. He will
remember...'</p>
<p>And now it was Monsieur de Bernis who interrupted him.</p>
<p>'The only abuse that is threatened, sir, is your own abuse of
the lady's patience.'</p>
<p>Reassured a little by this, but still extremely disgruntled and
uneasy, the Major moved to the door of the cabin. 'I shall be
within call, if you want me, Priscilla.'</p>
<p>'I do not think that I shall want you,' he was answered.</p>
<p>When at last Major Sands had gone, she moved from the table to
the long carved locker under the stern-ports. She was pale, and
perceptibly troubled. She did not look at Monsieur de Bernis, who
pivoted where he stood so that he might continue to face her, and
waited for her to speak.</p>
<p>She sat down before doing so, her back to the light and the
sunlit waters of the lagoon. Calmly then she looked up at him, at
last.</p>
<p>'Charles,' she said quietly, 'will you tell me frankly why you
desire to travel back to Jamaica on one of the other ships?'</p>
<p>'Frankly,' he said, 'so that you may be relieved at last of a
presence of which in the past month you may have had a
surfeit.'</p>
<p>'Is this your frankness? Will you still play comedy with me, or
is it that you are not at all concerned with my own wishes in the
matter?'</p>
<p>The question disturbed him. He sank his chin to his ruffles, and
paced across the cabin and back.</p>
<p>'Major Sands has sufficiently indicated what your wishes should
be where I am concerned.'</p>
<p>'Major Sands?' There was a faint warmth of indignation in her
tone. 'What have I to do with Major Sands?'</p>
<p>'He is your only mirror of the world to which you belong.'</p>
<p>'I see,' she said. A silence followed, which he made no attempt
to break. At last, 'Needs that weigh with you?' she asked him.</p>
<p>'It must, since it should weigh with you.'</p>
<p>'It does not weigh with me.'</p>
<p>'I said it should.' He smiled upon her a little wistfully. 'You
are to remember, Priscilla, that Major Sands is right when he calls
me a pirate.'</p>
<p>'A pirate? You?'</p>
<p>'It is what I have been. The brand of it remains upon me.'</p>
<p>'I do not perceive it. And if I did, I should not care. You are
the bravest, noblest man I have ever known.'</p>
<p>'You will not have known many,' said Monsieur de Bernis.</p>
<p>She looked straight into his countenance, and again there was a
long pause. At last she slewed round on the locker, turning her
shoulder to him and her face seawards, so that he might not see the
tears that were gathering in her eyes. Still she was silent a
little while, so as to regain control of her voice.</p>
<p>'Perhaps...perhaps, after all, I was mistook as to your motives
for going on one of the other ships. Perhaps I was wrong to wish to
ask you to remain.'</p>
<p>But the break in her voice, faint though it was, reached his
ears and cut him like a sword, betrayed him into saying what he had
vowed to himself that he would never say.</p>
<p>'Ah, mon Dieu! You were not mistook.' He crossed to her, and set
a knee upon the locker on which she sat. 'Attend to me, Priscilla,'
he said gravely, 'I go because, as I told you that night when we
talked ashore there, under the stars, I am what I am and you are
what you are. I run away from you, which is what you supposed. I
run away from you for your own sake. I would not have you betrayed
into a weakness because you may perceive that I have the
presumption to love you. I tell you this, just as I might place a
wreath upon a grave. Do you understand?'</p>
<p>'I am not dead yet, Monsieur de Bernis. And whilst I live you
have a certain claim to me. Only today you risked your life for me.
I understood. Don't suppose that I did not. What that odious Sir
Henry said was true. You killed Leach, you faced death from him, so
as to make sure of delivering me whatever happened.'</p>
<p>'That was a duty.'</p>
<p>'To me?' She swung to face him fully, looking up at him.</p>
<p>'To myself. To honour. To chivalry.'</p>
<p>'Honour? Chivalry? Ha! And you a pirate!' She laughed from moist
eyes. 'You speak of your love as a presumption. But if I account it
no presumption? What then?'</p>
<p>'Then? Why, then--mon Dieu!--you are mad.'</p>
<p>'And if I am content to be mad? Consciously wilfully mad? Shall
you gainsay me?'</p>
<p>His dark face was grave to the point of sadness. He shook his
head solemnly. 'You torture me with temptation,' he complained.</p>
<p>She rose and stood against him, her breast touching his.</p>
<p>'You may end the torture by yielding to the temptation.'</p>
<p>'And afterwards?' he asked her. 'If you and I should marry, your
world...'</p>
<p>She stopped his mouth with her hand. 'If you and I should marry,
my world will be your world, and there we may both find
happiness.'</p>
<p>'I do a dreadful, lovely thing,' he said, and took her in his
arms.</p>
