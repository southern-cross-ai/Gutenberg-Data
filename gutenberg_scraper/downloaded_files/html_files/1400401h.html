  <h2>PREFACE. &mdash; RIDING RECOLLECTIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">As in the choice of a horse and a wife a man must please
  himself, ignoring the opinion and advice of friends, so in the governing of
  each it is unwise to follow out any fixed system of discipline. Much depends
  on temper, education, mutual understanding and surrounding circumstances.
  Courage must not be heated to recklessness, caution should be implied rather
  than exhibited, and confidence is simply a question of time and place. It is
  as difficult to explain by precept or demonstrate by example how force,
  balance, and persuasion ought to be combined in horsemanship, as to teach the
  art of floating in the water or swimming on the back. Practice in either case
  alone makes perfect, and he is the most apt pupil who brings to his lesson a
  good opinion of his own powers and implicit reliance on that which carries
  him. Trust the element or the animal and you ride aloft superior to danger;
  but with misgiving comes confusion, effort, breathlessness, possibly collapse
  and defeat. Morally and physically, there is no creature so nervous as a man
  out of his depth.</p>

  <p>In offering the following pages to the public, the writer begs
  emphatically to disclaim any intention of laying down the law on such a
  subject as horsemanship. Every man who wears spurs believes himself more or
  less an adept in the art of riding; and it would be the height of presumption
  for one who has studied that art as a pleasure and not a profession to
  dictate for the ignorant, or enter the lists of argument with the wise. All
  he can lay claim to is a certain amount of experience, the result of many
  happy hours spent with the noble animal under him, of some uncomfortable
  minutes when mutual indiscretion has caused that position to be reversed.</p>

  <p>If the few hints he can offer should prove serviceable to the beginner he
  will feel amply rewarded, and will only ask to be kindly remembered hereafter
  in the hour of triumph when the tyro of a riding-school has become the pride
  of a hunting-field,&mdash;judicious, cool, daring, and skilful&mdash;light of
  hand, firm of seat, thoroughly at home in the saddle, a very Centaur</p>

  <p>"Encorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; KINDNESS.</h2>

  <p class="first">In our dealings with the brute creation, it cannot be too
  much insisted on that mutual confidence is only to be established by mutual
  good-will. The perceptions of the beast must be raised to their highest
  standard, and there is no such enemy to intelligence as fear. Reward should
  be as the daily food it eats, punishment as the medicine administered on rare
  occasions, unwillingly, and but when absolute necessity demands. The horse is
  of all domestic animals most susceptible to anything like discomfort or
  ill-usage. Its nervous system, sensitive and highly strung, is capable of
  daring effort under excitement, but collapses utterly in any new and strange
  situation, as if paralysed by apprehensions of the unknown. Can anything be
  more helpless than the young horse you take out hunting the first time he
  finds himself in a bog? Compare his frantic struggles and sudden prostration
  with the discreet conduct of an Exmoor pony in the same predicament. The one
  terrified by unaccustomed danger, and relying instinctively on the speed that
  seems his natural refuge, plunges wildly forward, sinks to his girths, his
  shoulders, finally unseats his rider, and settles down, without further
  exertion, in the stupid apathy of despair.</p>

  <p>The other, born and bred in the wild west country, picking its scanty keep
  from a foal off the treacherous surface of a Devonshire moor, either refuses
  altogether to trust the quagmire, or shortens its stride, collects its
  energies, chooses the soundest tufts that afford foothold, and failing these,
  flaps its way out on its side, to scramble into safety with scarce a quiver
  or a snort. It has been there before! Herein lies the whole secret. Some day
  your young one will be as calm, as wise, as tractable. Alas! that when his
  discretion has reached its prime his legs begin to fail!</p>

  <p>Therefore cultivate his intellect&mdash;I use the word
  advisedly&mdash;even before you enter on the development of his physical
  powers. Nature and good keep will provide for these, but to make him man's
  willing friend and partner you must give him the advantage of man's company
  and man's instruction. From the day you slip a halter over his ears he should
  be encouraged to look to you, like a child, for all his little wants and
  simple pleasures. He should come cantering up from the farthest corner of the
  paddock when he hears your voice, should ask to have his nose rubbed, his
  head stroked, his neck patted, with those honest, pleading looks which make
  the confidence of a dumb creature so touching; and before a roller has been
  put on his back, or a snaffle in his mouth he should be convinced that
  everything you do to him is right, and that it is impossible for _you_, his
  best friend, to cause him the least uneasiness or harm.</p>

  <p>I once owned a mare that would push her nose into my pockets in search of
  bread and sugar, would lick my face and hands like a dog, or suffer me to
  cling to any part of her limbs and body while she stood perfectly motionless.
  On one occasion, when I hung in the stirrup after a fall, she never stirred
  on rising, till by a succession of laborious and ludicrous efforts I could
  swing myself back into the saddle, with my foot still fast, though hounds
  were running hard and she loved hunting dearly in her heart. As a friend
  remarked at the time, "The little mare seems very fond of you, or there might
  have been a bother!"</p>

  <p>Now this affection was but the result of petting, sugar, kind and
  encouraging words, particularly at her fences, and a rigid abstinence from
  abuse of the bridle and the spur. I shall presently have something to say
  about both these instruments, but I may remark in the mean time that many
  more horses than people suppose will cross a country safely with a loose
  rein. The late Colonel William Greenwood, one of the finest riders in the
  world, might be seen out hunting with a single curb-bridle, such as is called
  "a hard-and-sharp" and commonly used only in the streets of London or the
  Park. The present Lord Spencer, of whom it is enough to say that he hunts one
  pack of his own hounds in Northamptonshire, and is always _in the same field
  with them_, never seems to have a horse pull, or until it is tired, even lean
  on his hand. I have watched both these gentlemen intently to learn their
  secret, but I regret to say without avail.</p>

  <p>This, however, is not the present question. Long before a bridle is fitted
  on the colt's head he should have so thoroughly learned the habit of
  obedience, that it has become a second instinct, and to do what is required
  of him seems as natural as to eat when he is hungry or lie down when he wants
  to sleep.</p>

  <p>This result is to be attained in a longer or shorter time, according to
  different tempers, but the first and most important step is surely gained
  when we have succeeded in winning that affection which nurses and children
  call "cupboard love." Like many amiable characters on two legs, the quadruped
  is shy of acquaintances but genial with friends. Make him understand that you
  are his best and wisest, that all you do conduces to his comfort and
  happiness, be careful at first not to deceive or disappoint him, and you will
  find his reasoning powers quite strong enough to grasp the relations of cause
  and effect.</p>

  <p>In a month or six weeks he will come to your call, and follow you about
  like a dog. Soon he will let you lift his feet, handle him all over, pull his
  tail, and lean your weight on any part of his body, without alarm or
  resentment. When thoroughly familiar with your face, your voice, and the
  motions of your limbs, you may back him with perfect safety, and he will move
  as soberly under you in any place to which he is accustomed as the oldest
  horse in your stable.</p>

  <p>Do not forget, however, that education should be gradual as moon-rise,
  perceptible, not in progress, but result. I recollect one morning riding to
  covert with a Dorsetshire farmer whose horses, bred at home, were celebrated
  as timber-jumpers even in that most timber-jumping of countries. I asked him
  how they arrived at this proficiency without breaking somebody's neck, and he
  imparted his plan.</p>

  <p>The colt, it seemed, ran loose from a yearling in the owner's straw-yard,
  but fed in a lofty out-house, across the door of which was placed a single
  tough ashen bar that would not break under a bullock. This was laid on the
  ground till the young one had grown thoroughly accustomed to it, and then
  raised very gradually to such a height as was less trouble to jump than
  clamber over. At three feet the two-year old thought no more of the obstacle
  than a girl does of her skipping-rope. After that, it was heightened an inch
  every week, and it needs no ready reckoner to tell us at the end of six
  months how formidable a leap the animal voluntarily negotiated three times a
  day. "It's never put no higher," continued my informant; "I'm an old man now,
  and that's good enough for me."</p>

  <p>I should think it was! A horse that can leap five feet of timber in cold
  blood is not likely to be pounded, while still unblown, in any part of
  England I have yet seen.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Dorsetshire farmer's plan of teaching horses to jump
    timber.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Now the Dorsetshire farmer's system was sound, and based on common sense.
  As you bend the twig so grows the tree, therefore prepare your pupil from the
  first for the purpose you intend him to serve hereafter. An Arab foal, as we
  know, brought up in the Bedouin's tent, like another child, among the
  Bedouin's children, is the most docile of its kind, and I cannot but think
  that if he lived in our houses and we took as much notice of him, the horse
  would prove quite as sagacious as the dog; but we must never forget that to
  harshness or intimidation he is the most sensitive of creatures, and even
  when in fault should be rather cautioned than reproved.</p>

  <p>An ounce of illustration is worth a pound of argument, and the following
  example best conveys the spirit in which our brave and willing servant should
  be treated by his lord.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, when he hunted the Cottesmore country, Sir Richard
  Sutton's hounds had been running hard from Glooston Wood along the valley
  under Cranehoe by Slawston to Holt. After thirty minutes or so over this
  beautiful, but exceedingly stiff line, their heads went up, and they came to
  a check, possibly from their own dash and eagerness, certainly, at that pace
  and amongst those fences, _not from being overridden_.</p>

  <p>"Turn 'em, Ben!" exclaimed Sir Richard, with a dirty coat, and Hotspur in
  a lather, but determined not to lose a moment in getting after his fox. "Yes,
  Sir Richard," answered Morgan, running his horse without a moment's
  hesitation at a flight of double-posts and rails, with a ditch in the middle
  and one on each side! The good grey, having gone in front from the find, was
  perhaps a little blown, and dropping his hind legs in the farthest ditch,
  rolled very handsomely into the next field. "It's not _your_ fault, old man!"
  said Ben, patting his favourite on the neck as they rose together in mutual
  good-will, adding in the same breath, while he leapt to the saddle, and
  Tranby acknowledged the line&mdash;"Forrard on, Sir Richard!&mdash;Hoic
  together, hoic! You'll have him directly, my beauties! He's a Quorn fox, and
  he'll do you good!"</p>

  <p>I had always considered Ben Morgan an unusually fine rider. For the first
  time, I began to understand _why_ his horse never failed to carry him so
  willingly and so well.</p>

  <p>I do not remember whether Dick Webster was out with us that day, but I am
  sure if he was he has not forgotten it, and I mention him as another example
  of daring horsemanship combined with an imperturbable good humour, almost
  verging on buffoonery, which seems to accept the most dangerous falls as
  enhancing the fun afforded by a delightful game of romps. His annual
  exhibition of prowess at the Islington horse show has made his shrewd comical
  face so familiar to the public that his name, without farther comment, is
  enough to recall the presence and bearing of the man&mdash;his quips and
  cranks and merry jests, his shrill whistle and ready smile, his strong seat
  and light, skilful hand, but above all his untiring patience and unfailing
  kindness with the most restive and refractory of pupils. Dick, like many
  other good fellows, is not so young as he was, but he will probably be an
  unequalled rider at eighty, and I am quite sure that if he lives to the age
  of Methuselah, the extreme of senile irritability will never provoke him to
  lose his temper with a horse.</p>

  <p>Presence of mind under difficulties is the one quality that in riding
  makes all the difference between getting off with a scramble and going down
  with a fall. If unvaried kindness has taught your horse to place confidence
  in his rider, he will have his wits about him, and provide for _your_ safety
  as for his own. When left to himself, and not flurried by the fear of
  punishment, even an inexperienced hunter makes surprising efforts to keep on
  his legs, and it is not too much to say that while his wind lasts, the
  veteran is almost as difficult to catch tripping as a cat. I have known
  horses drop their hind legs on places scarcely affording foothold for a goat,
  but in all such feats they have been ridden by a lover of the animal, who
  trusts it implicitly, and rules by kindness rather than fear.</p>

  <p>I will not deny that there are cases in which the _suaviter in modo_ must
  be supplemented by the _fortiter in re_. Still the insubordination of
  ignorance is never wholly inexcusable, and great discretion must be used in
  repressing even the most violent of outbreaks. If severity is absolutely
  required, be sure to temper justice with mercy, remembering that, in brute
  natures at least, the more you spare the rod, the less you spoil the
  child!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; COERCION.</h2>

  <p class="first">I recollect, in years gone by, an old and pleasant comrade
  used to declare that "to be in a rage was almost as contemptible as to be in
  a funk!" Doubtless the passion of anger, though less despised than that of
  fear, is so far derogatory to the dignity of man that it deprives him
  temporarily of reason, the very quality which confers sovereignty over the
  brute. When a magician is without his talisman the slaves he used to rule
  will do his bidding no longer. When we say of such a one that he has "lost
  his head," we no more expect him to steer a judicious course than a ship that
  has lost her rudder. Both are the prey of circumstances&mdash;at the mercy of
  winds and waves. Therefore, however hard you are compelled to hit, be sure to
  keep your temper. Strike in perfect good-humour, and in the right place. Many
  people cannot encounter resistance of any kind without anger, even a
  difference of opinion in conversation is sufficient to rouse their bile; but
  such are seldom winners in argument or in fight. Let them also leave
  education alone. Nature never meant them to teach the young idea how to shoot
  or hunt, or do anything else!</p>

  <p>It is the cold-blooded and sagacious wrestler who takes the prize, the
  calm and imperturbable player who wins the game. In all struggles for
  supremacy, excitement only produces flurry, and flurry means defeat.</p>

  <p>Who ever saw Mr. Anstruther Thompson in a passion, though, like every
  other huntsman and master of hounds, he must often have found his temper
  sorely tried? And yet, when punishment is absolutely necessary to extort
  obedience from the equine rebel, no man can administer it more severely,
  either from the saddle or the box. But whether double-thonging a restive
  wheeler, or "having it out" with a resolute buck-jumper, the operation is
  performed with the same pleasant smile, and when one of the adversaries
  preserves calmness and common sense, the fight is soon over, and the victory
  gained.</p>

  <p>It is not every man, however, who possesses this gentleman's iron nerve
  and powerful frame. For most of us, it is well to remember, before engaging
  in such contests, that defeat is absolute ruin. We must be prepared to fight
  it out to the bitter end, and if we are not sure of our own firmness, either
  mental or physical it is well to temporise, and try to win by diplomacy the
  terms we dare not wrest by force. If the latter alternative must needs be
  accepted, in this as in most stand-up fights, it will be found that the first
  blow is half the battle. The rider should take his horse short by the head
  and let him have two or three stingers with a cutting whip&mdash;not
  more&mdash;particularly, if on a thorough-bred one, as low down the flanks as
  can be reached, administered without warning, and in quick succession,
  sitting back as prepared for the plunge into the air that will inevitably
  follow, keeping his horse's head well-up the while to prevent buck-jumping.
  He should then turn the animal round and round half-a-dozen times, till it is
  confused, and start it off at speed in any direction where there is room for
  a gallop. Blown, startled, and intimidated, he will in all probability find
  his pupil perfectly amenable to reason when he pulls up, and should then coax
  and soothe him into an equable frame of mind once more. Such, however, is an
  extreme case. It is far better to avoid the _ultima ratio_. In equitation, as
  in matrimony, there should never arise "_the first quarrel_." Obedience, in
  horses, ought to be a matter of habit, contracted so imperceptibly that its
  acquirement can scarcely be called a lesson.</p>

  <p>This is why the hunting-field is such a good school for leaping. Horses of
  every kind are prompted by some unaccountable impulse to follow a pack of
  hounds, and the beginner finds himself voluntarily performing feats of
  activity and daring, in accordance with the will of his rider, which no
  coercion from the latter would have induced him to attempt. Flushed with
  success, and if fortunate enough to escape a fall, confident in his
  lately-discovered powers, he finds a new pleasure in their exercise, and,
  most precious of qualities in a hunter, grows "fond of jumping."</p>

  <p>The same result is to be attained at home, but is far more gradual,
  requiring the exercise of much care, patience, and perseverance.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when we consider the inconvenience created by the vagaries
  of young horses in the hunting field, to hounds, sportsmen, ladies,
  pedestrians, and their own riders, we must admit that the Irish system is
  best, and that a colt, to use the favourite expression, should have been
  trained into "an accomplished lepper," before he is asked to carry a
  sportsman through a run.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rarey, no doubt, thoroughly understood the nature of the animal with
  which he had to deal. His system was but a convenient application of our
  principle, viz., Judicious coercion, so employed that the brute obeys the man
  without knowing why. When forced to the earth, and compelled to remain there,
  apparently by the mere volition of a creature so much smaller and feebler
  than itself, it seemed to acknowledge some mysterious and over-mastering
  power such as the disciples of Mesmer profess to exercise on their believers,
  and this, in truth, is the whole secret of man's dominion over the beasts of
  the field. It is founded, to speak practically, on reason in both, the larger
  share being apportioned to the weaker frame. If by terror or resentment, the
  result of injudicious severity, that reason becomes obscured in the stronger
  animal, we have a maniac to deal with, possessing the strength of ten human
  beings, over whom we have lost our only shadow of control! Where is our
  supremacy then? It existed but in the imagination of the beast, for which, so
  long as it never tried to break the bond, a silken thread was as strong as an
  iron chain.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this is the theory of all government, but with the conduct and
  coercion of mankind we have at present nothing to do.</p>

  <p>There is a peculiarity in horses that none who spend much time in the
  saddle can have failed to notice. It is the readiness with which all
  accommodate themselves to a rider who succeeds in subjugating _one_. Some men
  possess a faculty, impossible to explain, of establishing a good
  understanding from the moment they place themselves in the saddle. It can
  hardly be called hand, for I have seen consummate horsemen, notably Mr.
  Lovell, of the New Forest, who have lost an arm; nor seat, or how could
  Colonel Fraser, late of the 11th Hussars, be one of the best heavy-weights
  over such a country as Meath, with a broken and contracted thigh? Certainly
  not nerve, for there are few fields too scanty to furnish examples of men who
  possess every quality of horsemanship except daring. What is it then? I
  cannot tell, but if you are fortunate enough to possess it, whether you weigh
  ten stone or twenty, you will be able to mount yourself fifty pounds cheaper
  than anybody else in the market! Be it an impulse of nature, or a result of
  education, there is a tendency in every horse to make vigorous efforts at the
  shortest notice in obedience to the inclination of a rider's body or the
  pressure of his limbs. Such indications are of the utmost service in an
  emergency, and to offer them at the happy moment is a crucial test of
  horsemanship. Thus races are "snatched out of the fire," as it is termed, "by
  riding," and this is the quality that, where judgment, patience, and
  knowledge of pace are equal, renders one jockey superior to the rest. It
  enables a proficient also to clear those large fences that, in our grazing
  districts especially, appear impracticable to the uninitiated, as if the
  horse borrowed muscular energy, no less than mental courage, from the
  resolution of his rider. On the racecourse and in the hunting field,
  Custance, the well-known jockey, possesses this quality in the highest
  degree. The same determined strength in the saddle, that had done him such
  good service amongst the bullfinches and "oxers" of his native Rutland,
  applied at the happy moment, secured on a great occasion his celebrated
  victory with King Lud.</p>

  <p>There are two kinds of hunters that require coercion in following hounds,
  and he is indeed a master of his art who feels equally at home on each. The
  one must be _steered_, the other _smuggled_ over a country. As he is never
  comfortable but in front, we will take the rash horse first.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose you have not ridden him before, that you like his
  appearance, his action, all his qualities except his boundless ambition, that
  you are in a practicable country, as seems only fair, and about to draw a
  covert affording every prospect of a run. Before you put your foot in the
  stirrup be sure to examine his bit&mdash;not one groom in a hundred knows how
  to bridle a horse properly&mdash;and remember that on the fitting of this
  important article depends your success, your enjoyment, perhaps your safety,
  during the day. Horses, like servants, will never let their master be happy
  if they are uncomfortable themselves. See that your headstall is long enough,
  so that the pressure may lie on the bars of the horse's mouth and not crumple
  up the corners of his lips, like a gag. The curb-chain will probably be too
  tight, also the throat-lash; if so, loosen both, and with your own hands; it
  is a pleasant way of making acquaintance, and may perhaps prepossess him in
  your favour. If he wears a nose-band it will be time enough to take it off
  when you find he shows impatience of the restriction by shaking his head,
  changing his leg frequently, or reaching unjustifiably at the rein.</p>

  <p>I am prejudiced against the nose-band. I frankly admit a man in a minority
  of one _must_ be wrong, but I never rode a horse in my life that, to my own
  feeling, did not go more comfortably when I took it off.</p>

  <p>Look also to your girths. For a fractious temper they are very irritating
  when drawn too tight, while with good shape and a breast-plate, there is
  little danger of their not being tight enough. When these preliminaries have
  been carefully gone through mount nimbly to the saddle, and take the first
  opportunity of feeling your new friend's mouth and paces in trot, canter, and
  gallop. Here, too, though in general it should be avoided for many reasons,
  social, agricultural, and personal, a little "larking" is not wholly
  inexcusable. It will promote cordiality between man and beast. The latter, as
  we are considering him, is sure to be fond of jumping, and to ride him over a
  fence or two away from other horses in cold blood will create in his mind the
  very desirable impression that you are of a daring spirit, determined to be
  in front.</p>

  <p>Take him, however, up to his leap as slow as he will permit&mdash;if
  possible at a trot. Even should he break into a canter and become impetuous
  at last, there is no space for a violent rush in three strides, during which
  you must hold him in a firm, equable grasp. As he leaves the ground give him
  his head, he cannot have "too much rope," till he lands again, when, as soon
  as possible, you should pull him back to a trot, handling him delicately,
  soothing him with voice and gesture, treating the whole affair as the
  simplest matter of course. Do not bring him again over the same place, rather
  take him on for two or three fields in a line parallel to the hounds. By the
  time they are put into covert you will have established a mutual
  understanding, and found out how much you _dislike_ one another at the worst!
  It is well now to avoid the crowd, but beware of taking up a position by
  yourself where you may head the fox! No man can ride in good-humour under a
  sense of guilt, and you _must_ be good-humoured with such a mount as you have
  under you to-day.</p>

  <p>Exhaust, therefore, all your knowledge of woodcraft to get away on good
  terms with the hounds. The wildest romp in a rush of horses is often
  perfectly temperate and amenable when called on to cut out the work. Should
  you, by ill luck, find yourself behind others in the first field, avoid, if
  possible, following any one of them over the first fence. Even though it be
  somewhat black and forbidding, choose a fresh place, so free a horse as yours
  will jump the more carefully that his attention is not distracted by a
  leader, and there is the further consideration, based on common humanity,
  that your leader might fall when too late for you to stop. No man is in so
  false a position as he who rides over a friend in the hunting field, except
  the friend!</p>

  <p>Take your own line. If you be not afraid to gallop and the hounds _run
  on_, you will probably find it plain sailing till they check. Should a brook
  laugh in your face, of no unreasonable dimensions, you may charge it with
  confidence, a rash horse usually jumps width, and there will be plenty of
  "room to ride" on the far side. It takes but a few feet of water to decimate
  a field. I may here observe that, if, as they cross, you see the hounds leap
  at it, even though they fall short, you may be sure the distance from bank to
  bank is within the compass of a hunter's stride.</p>

  <p>At timber, I would not have you quite so confident. When, as in
  Leicestershire, it is set fairly in line with the fence and there is a good
  take-off, your horse, however impetuous, may leap it with impunity in his
  stroke, but should the ground be poached by cattle, or dip as you come to it,
  beware of too great hurry. The feat ought then to be accomplished calmly and
  collectedly at a trot, the horse taking his time, so to speak, from the
  motions of his rider, and jumping, as it is called, "to his hand." Now when
  man and horse are at variance on so important a matter as pace, the one is
  almost sure to interfere at the wrong moment, the other to take off too soon
  or get too close under his leap; in either case the animal is more likely to
  rise at a fence than a rail, and if unsuccessful in clearing it a binder is
  less dangerous to flirt with than a bar. Lord Wilton seems to me to ride at
  timber a turn slower than usual, Lord Grey a turn faster. Whether father and
  son differ in theory I am unable to say, I can only affirm that both are
  undeniable in practice. Mr. Fellowes of Shottisham, perhaps the best of his
  day, and Mr. Gilmour, _facile princeps_, almost walk up to this kind of leap;
  Colonel, now General Pearson, known for so many seasons as "the flying
  Captain," charges it like a squadron of Sikh cavalry; Captain Arthur Smith
  pulls back to a trot; Lord Carington scarcely shortens the stride of his
  gallop. Who shall decide between such professors? Much depends on
  circumstances, more perhaps on horses. Assheton Smith used to throw the reins
  on a hunter's neck when rising at a gate, and say,&mdash;"Take care of
  yourself, you brute!"&mdash;whereas the celebrated Lord Jersey, who gave me
  this information of his old friend's style, held his own bridle in a vice at
  such emergencies, and both usually got safe over! Perhaps the logical
  deduction from these conflicting examples should be not to jump timber at
  all!</p>

  <p>But the rash horse is by this time getting tired, and now, if you would
  avoid a casualty, you must temper valour with discretion, and ride him as
  skilfully as you _can_.</p>

  <p>He has probably carried you well and pleasantly during the few happy
  moments that intervened between freshness and fatigue; now he is beginning to
  pull again, but in a more set and determined manner than at first. He does
  not collect himself so readily, and wants to go faster than ever at his
  fences, if you would let him. This careless, rushing style threatens a
  downfall, and to counteract it will require the exercise of your utmost
  skill. Carry his head for him, since he seems to require it, and endeavour,
  by main force if necessary, to bring him to his leaps with his hind legs
  under him. Half-beaten horses measure distance with great accuracy, and "lob"
  over very large places, when properly ridden. If, notwithstanding all your
  precautions, he persists in going on his shoulders, blundering through his
  places, and labouring across ridge and furrow like a boat in a heavy sea,
  take advantage of the first lane you find, and voting the run nearly over,
  make up your mind to view the rest of it in safety from the hard road!</p>

  <p>Ride the same horse again at the first opportunity, and, if sound enough
  to come out in his turn, a month's open weather will probably make him a very
  pleasant mount.</p>

  <p>The "slug," a thorough-bred one, we will say, with capital hind-ribs, lop
  ears, and a lazy eye, must be managed on a very different system from the
  foregoing. You need not be so particular about his bridle, for the coercion
  in this case is of impulsion rather than restraint, but I would advise you to
  select a useful cutting-whip, stiff and strong enough to push a gate. Not
  that you must use it freely&mdash;one or two "reminders" at the right moment,
  and an occasional flourish, ought to carry you through the day. Be sure, too,
  that you strike underhanded, and not in front of your own body, lest you take
  his eye off at the critical moment when your horse is measuring his leap. The
  best riders prefer such an instrument to the spurs, as a stimulant to
  increased pace and momentary exertion.</p>

  <p>You will have little trouble with this kind of hunter while hounds are
  drawing. He will seem only too happy to stand still, and you may sit amongst
  your friends in the middle ride, smoking, joking, and holding forth to your
  heart's content. But, like the fox, you will find your troubles begin with
  the cheering holloa of "Gone away!"</p>

  <p>On your present mount, instead of avoiding the crowd, I should advise you
  to keep in the very midst of the torrent that, pent up in covert, rushes down
  the main ride to choke a narrow handgate, and overflow the adjoining field.
  Emerging from the jaws of their inconvenient egress, they will scatter, like
  a row of beads when the string breaks, and while the majority incline to
  right or left, regardless of the line of chase as compared with that of
  safety, some half dozen are sure to single themselves out, and ride straight
  after the hounds.</p>

  <p>Select one of these, a determined horseman, whom you know to be mounted on
  an experienced hunter; give him _plenty of room_&mdash;fifty yards at
  least&mdash;and ride his line, nothing doubting, fence for fence, till your
  horse's blood is up, and your own too. I cannot enough insist on a jealous
  care of your leader's safety, and a little consideration for his prejudices.
  The boldest sportsmen are exceedingly touchy about being ridden over, and not
  without reason. There is something unpleasantly suggestive in the bit, and
  teeth, and tongue of an open mouth at your ear; while your own horse,
  quivering high in air, makes the discovery that he has not allowed margin
  enough for the yawner under his nose! It is little less inexcusable to pick a
  man's pocket than to ride in it; and no apology can exonerate so flagrant an
  assault as to land on him when down. Reflect, also, that a hunter, after the
  effort to clear his fence, often loses foothold, particularly over ridge and
  furrow, in the second or third stride, and falls at the very moment a
  follower would suppose he was safe over. Therefore, do not begin for yourself
  till your leader is twenty yards into the next field when you may harden your
  heart, set your muscles, and give your horse to understand, by seat and
  manner, that it must be in, through, or over.</p>

  <p>Beware, however, of hurrying him off his legs. Ride him resolutely,
  indeed, but in a short, contracted stride; slower in proportion to the
  unwillingness he betrays, so as to hold him in a vice, and squeeze him up to
  the brink of his task, when, forbidden to turn from it, he will probably make
  his effort in self-defence, and take you somehow to the other side. Not one
  hunter in a hundred can jump in good form when going at speed; it is the
  perfection of equine prowess, resulting from great quickness and the
  confidence of much experience. An arrant refuser usually puts on the steam of
  his own accord, like a confirmed rusher, and wheels to right or left at the
  last moment, with an activity that, displayed in a better cause, would be
  beyond praise. The rider, too, has more command of his horse, when forced up
  to the bit in a slow canter, than at any other pace.</p>

  <p>Thoroughbred horses, until their education is complete, are apt to get
  very close to their fences, preferring, as it would seem, to go into them on
  this side rather than the other. It is not a style that inspires confidence;
  yet these crafty, careful creatures are safer than they seem, and from
  jumping in a collected form, with their hind-legs under them, extricate
  themselves with surprising address from difficulties that, after a little
  more tuition, they will never be in. They are really less afraid of their
  fences, and consequently less flurried, than the wilful, impetuous brute that
  loses its equanimity from the moment it catches sight of an obstacle, and
  miscalculating its distance, in sheer nervousness&mdash;most fatal error of
  all&mdash;takes off too soon.</p>

  <p>I will now suppose that in the wake of your pilot you have negotiated two
  or three fences with some expenditure of nerve and temper, but without a
  refusal or a fall. The cutting-whip has been applied, and the result,
  perhaps, was disappointing, for it is an uncertain remedy, though, in my
  opinion, preferable to the spur. Your horse has shown great leaping powers in
  the distances he has covered without the momentum of speed, and has doubled
  an on-and-off with a precision not excelled by your leader himself. If he
  would but jump in his stride, you feel you have a hunter under you. Should
  the country be favourable, now is the time to teach him this accomplishment,
  while his limbs are supple and his spirit roused. If he seems willing to face
  them, let him take his fences in his own way; do not force or hurry him, but
  keep fast hold of his head without varying the pressure of hand or limb by a
  hairsbreadth; the least uncertainty of finger or inequality of seat will
  spoil it all. Should the ditch be towards him, he will jump from a stand, or
  nearly so, but, to your surprise, will land safe in the next field. If it is
  on the far side, he will show more confidence, and will perhaps swing over
  the whole with something of an effort in his canter. A foot or two of extra
  width may cause him to drop a hind-leg, or even bring him on his
  nose;&mdash;so much the better! no admonition of yours would have proved as
  effectual a warning&mdash;he will take good care to cover distance enough
  next time. Dispense with your leader now, if you are pretty close to the
  hounds, for your horse is gathering confidence with every stride. He can
  gallop, of course, and is good through dirt&mdash;it is also understood that
  he is fit to go; there are not many in a season, but let us suppose you have
  dropped into a run; if he carries you well to the finish, he will be a hunter
  from to-day.</p>

  <p>After some five and twenty minutes, you will find him going with more dash
  and freedom, as his neighbours begin to tire. You may now ride him at timber
  without scruple, when not too high, but avoid a rail that looks as if it
  would break. To find out he may tamper with such an obstacle is the most
  dangerous discovery a hunter can make. You should send him at it pretty
  quick, lest he get too near to rise, and refuse at the last moment. He may
  not do it in the best of form, but whether he chances it in his gallop, or
  bucks over like a deer, or hoists himself sideways all in a heap, with his
  tail against your hat, at this kind of fence this kind of horse is most
  unlikely to fall.</p>

  <p>The same may be said of a brook. If he is within a fair distance of the
  hounds, and you see by the expression of his ears and crest that he is
  watching them with ardent interest, ride him boldly at water should it be
  necessary. It is quite possible he may jump it in his stride from bank to
  bank, without a moment's hesitation. It is equally possible he may stop short
  on the bank, with lowered head and crouching quarters as if prepared to
  drink, or dive, or decline. He will do none of these. Sit still, give him his
  head, keep close into your saddle, not moving so much as an eyelash, and it
  is more than probable that he will jump the stream standing, and reach the
  other side, with a scramble and a flounder at the worst!</p>

  <p>If he should drop his hind-legs, _shoot_ yourself off over his shoulders
  in an instant, with a fast hold of the bridle, at which tug hard; even though
  you may not have regained your legs. A very slight help now will enable him
  to extricate himself, but if he is allowed to subside into the gulf, it may
  take a team of cart horses to drag him out.</p>

  <p>When in the saddle again give him a timely pull; after the struggle you
  will be delighted with each other, and have every prospect of going on
  triumphantly to the end.</p>

  <p>I have here endeavoured to describe the different methods of coercion by
  which two opposite natures may be induced to exert themselves on our behalf
  in the chase. Every horse inclines, more or less, to one or other extreme I
  have cited as an example. A perfect hunter has preserved the good qualities
  of each without the faults, but how many perfect hunters do any of us ride in
  our lives? The chestnut is as fast as the wind, stout and honest, a safe and
  gallant fencer, but too light a mouth makes him difficult to handle at blind
  and cramped places; the bay can leap like a deer, and climb like a goat,
  invincible at doubles, and unrivalled at rails, but, as bold Lord Cardigan
  said of an equally accomplished animal, "it takes him a long time to get from
  one bit of timber to another!" While the brown, even faster than the
  chestnut, even safer than the bay, would be the best, as he is the
  pleasantest hunter in the world&mdash;only nothing will induce him to go near
  a brook!</p>

  <p>It is only by exertion of a skill that is the embodiment of thought in
  action, by application of a science founded on reason, experience and
  analogy, that we can approach perfection in our noble four-footed friend.
  Common-sense will do much, kindness more, coercion very little, yet we are
  not to forget that man is the master; that the hand, however light, must be
  strong, the heel, however lively, must be resolute; and that when persuasion,
  best of all inducements, seems to fail, we must not shrink from the timely
  application of force.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE USE OF THE BRIDLE.</h2>

  <p class="first">The late Mr. Maxse, celebrated some fifty years ago for a
  fineness of hand that enabled him to cross Leicestershire with fewer falls
  than any other sportsman of fifteen stone who rode equally straight, used to
  profess much comical impatience with the insensibility of his servants to
  this useful quality. He was once seen explaining what he meant to his
  coachman with a silk-handkerchief passed round a post.</p>

  <p>"Pull at it!" said the master. "Does it pull at you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered the servant, grinning.</p>

  <p>"Slack it off then. Does it pull at you now?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well then, you double-distilled fool, can't you see that your horses are
  like that post? If you don't pull at _them_ they won't pull at _you_!"</p>

  <p>Now it seems to me that in riding and driving also, what we want to teach
  our horses is, that when we pull at them they are _not_ to pull at us, and
  this understanding is only to be attained by a delicacy of touch, a harmony
  of intention, and a give-and-take concord, that for lack of a better we
  express by the term "hand." Like the fingering of a pianoforte, this
  desirable quality seems rather a gift than an acquirement, and its rarity has
  no doubt given rise to the multiplicity of inventions with which man's
  ingenuity endeavours to supply the want of manual skill.</p>

  <p>It was the theory of a celebrated Yorkshire sportsman, the well-known Mr.
  Fairfax, that "Every horse is a hunter if you don't throw him down with the
  bridle!" and I have always understood his style of riding was in perfect
  accordance with this daring profession of faith. The instrument, however,
  though no doubt producing ten falls, where it prevents one, is in so far a
  necessary evil, that we are helpless without it, and when skilfully used in
  conjunction with legs, knees, and body by a consummate horseman, would seem
  to convey the man's intentions to the beast through some subtle agency,
  mysterious and almost rapid as thought. It is impossible to define the nature
  of that sympathy which exists between a well-bitted horse and his rider, they
  seem actuated by a common impulse, and it is to promote or create this mutual
  understanding that so many remarkable conceits, generally painful, have been
  dignified with the name of bridles. In the saddle-room of any hunting-man may
  be found at least a dozen of these, but you will probably learn on inquiry,
  that three or four at most are all he keeps in use. It must be a stud of
  strangely-varying mouths and tempers which, the snaffle, gag, Pelham, and
  double-bridle are insufficient to humour and control.</p>

  <p>As it seems from the oldest representations known of men on horseback, to
  have been the earliest in use, we will take the snaffle first.</p>

  <p>This bit, the invention of common-sense going straight to its object,
  while lying easily on the tongue and bars of a horse's mouth, and affording
  control without pain, is perfection of its kind. It causes no annoyance and
  consequently no alarm to the unbroken colt, champing and churning freely at
  the new plaything between his jaws; on it the highly trained charger bears
  pleasantly and lightly, to "change his leg,"&mdash;"passage"&mdash;or
  "shoulder in," at the slightest inflection of a rider's hand; the hunter
  leans against it for support in deep ground; and the race-horse allows it to
  hold him together at nearly full-speed without contracting his stride, or by
  fighting with the restriction, wasting any of his gallop in the air. It
  answers its purpose admirably _so long as it remains in the proper place_,
  but not a moment longer. Directly a horse by sticking out his nose can shift
  this pressure to his lips and teeth, it affords no more control than a
  halter. With head up, and mouth open, he can go how and where he will. In
  such a predicament only an experienced horseman has the skill to give him
  such an amount of liberty without license as cajoles him into dropping again
  to his bridle, before he breaks away. Once off at speed, with the conviction
  that he is master, however ludicrous in appearance, the affair is serious
  enough in fact.</p>

  <p>Many centuries elapsed, and a good deal of unpleasant riding must have
  been endured, before the snaffle was supplemented with a martingale. Judging
  from the Elgin Marbles, this useful invention seems to have been wholly
  unknown to the Greeks. Though the men's figures are perfect in seat and
  attitude through the whole of that spirited frieze which adorned the
  Parthenon, not one of their horses carries its head in the right place. The
  ancient Greek seems to have relied on strength rather than cunning, in his
  dealings with the noble animal, and though he sat down on it like a workman,
  must have found considerable difficulty in guiding his beast the way he
  wanted to go.</p>

  <p>But with a martingale, the most insubordinate soon discover that they
  cannot rid themselves of control. It keeps their heads down in a position
  that enables the bit to act on the mouth, and if they must needs pull,
  obliges them to pull against that most sensitive part called the bars. There
  is no escape&mdash;bend their necks they must, and to bend their necks means
  to acknowledge a master and do homage to the rider's will.</p>

  <p>It is a well-known fact, and I can attest it by my own experience, that a
  _twisted_ snaffle with a martingale will hold a runaway when every other
  bridle fails; but to guide or stop an animal by the exercise of bodily
  strength is not horsemanship, and to saw at its mouth for the purpose cannot
  be expected to promote that sympathy of desire and intention which we
  understand by the term.</p>

  <p>If we look at the sporting prints of our grandfathers and
  great-grandfathers, as delineated, early in the present century, we observe
  that nine out of every ten hunters were ridden in plain snaffle bridles, and
  we ask ourselves if our progenitors bred more docile beasts, or were these
  drinkers of port wine, bolder, stronger, and better horsemen than their
  descendants. Without entering on the vexed question of comparative merit in
  hounds, hunters, pace, country and sport, at an interval of more than two
  generations, I think I can find a reason, and it seems to me simply this.</p>

  <p>Most of these hunting pictures are representations of the chase in our
  midland counties, notably Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, then only
  partially inclosed; boundary fences of large properties were few and far
  between, straggling also, and ill-made-up, the high thorn hedges that now
  call forth so much bold and so much timid riding, either did not exist, or
  were of such tender growth as required protection by a low rail on each side,
  and a sportsman, with flying coat-tails, doubling these obstacles neatly, at
  his own pace, forms a favourite subject for the artist of the time. Twenty or
  thirty horsemen, at most, comprised the field; in such an expanse of free
  country there must have been plenty of room to ride, and we all know how soon
  a horse becomes amenable to control on a moor or an open down. The surface
  too was undrained, and a few furlongs bring the hardest puller to reason when
  he goes in over his fetlocks every stride. Hand and heel are the two great
  auxiliaries of the equestrian, but our grandfathers, I imagine, made less use
  of the bridle than the spur.</p>

  <p>With increased facilities for locomotion, in the improvement of roads and
  coaches, hunting, always the English gentleman's favourite pastime, became a
  fashion for every one who could afford to keep a horse, and men thought
  little of twelve hours spent in the mail on a dark winter's night in order to
  meet hounds next day. The numbers attending a favourite fixture began to
  multiply, second horses were introduced, so that long before the use of
  railways scarlet coats mustered by tens as to-day by fifties, and the
  _crowd_, as it is called, became a recognized impediment to the enjoyments of
  the day.</p>

  <p>Meantime fences were growing in height and thickness; an improved system
  of farming subdivided the fields and partitioned them off for pastoral or
  agricultural purposes; the hunter was called upon to collect himself, and
  jump at short notice, with a frequency that roused his mettle to the utmost,
  and this too in a rush of his fellow-creatures, urging, jostling, crossing
  him in the first five minutes at every turn.</p>

  <p>Under such conditions it became indispensable to have him in perfect
  control, and that excellent invention, the double-bridle, came into general
  use.</p>

  <p>I suppose I need hardly explain to my reader that it loses none of the
  advantages belonging to the snaffle, while it gains in the powerful leverage
  of the curb a restraint few horses are resolute enough to defy. In skilful
  hands, varying, yet harmonising, the manipulation of both, as a musician
  plays treble and bass on the pianoforte, it would seem to connect the rider's
  thought with the horse's movement, as if an electric chain passed through
  wrist, and finger, and mouth, from the head of the one to the heart of the
  other. The bearing and touch of this instrument can be so varied as to admit
  of a continual change in the degree of liberty and control, of that
  give-and-take which is the whole secret of comfortable progression. While the
  bridoon or snaffle-rein is tightened, the horse may stretch his neck to the
  utmost, without losing that confidence in the moral support of his rider's
  hand which is so encouraging to him if unaccompanied by pain. When the curb
  is brought into play, he bends his neck at its pressure to a position that
  brings his hind-legs under his own body and his rider's weight, from which
  collected form alone can his greatest efforts be made. Have your curb-bit
  sufficiently powerful, if not high in the _port_, at any rate long in the
  _cheek_, your bridoon as _thick_ as your saddler can be induced to send it.
  With the first you bring a horse's head into the right place, with the
  second, if smooth and _very_ thick, you keep it there, in perfect comfort to
  the animal, and consequently to yourself. A thin bridoon, and I have seen
  them mere wires, only cuts, chafes, and irritates, causing more pain and
  consequently more resistance, than the curb itself. I have already mentioned
  the fineness of Mr. Lovell's hand (alas! that he has but one), and I was
  induced by this gentleman to try a plan of his own invention, which, with his
  delicate manipulation, he found to be a success. Instead of the usual
  bridoon, he rode with a double strap of leather, exactly the width of a
  bridle-rein, and twice its thickness, resting where the snaffle ordinarily
  lies, on the horse's tongue and bars. With his touch it answered admirably,
  with mine, perhaps because I used the leather more roughly than the metal, it
  seemed the severer of the two. But a badly-broken horse, and half the hunters
  we ride have scarcely been taught their alphabet, will perhaps try to avoid
  the restraint of a curb by throwing his head up at the critical moment when
  you want to steady him for a difficulty. If you have a firm seat, perfectly
  independent of the bridle,&mdash;and do not be too sure of this, until you
  have tried the experiment of sitting a leap with nothing to hold on
  by&mdash;you may call in the assistance of the running-martingale, slipping
  your curb-rein, which should be made to unbuckle, through its rings. Your
  _curb_, I repeat, contrary to the usual practice, and _not your snaffle_. I
  will soon explain why.</p>

  <p>The horse has so docile a nature, that he would always rather do right
  than wrong, if he can only be taught to distinguish one from the other;
  therefore, have all your restrictive power on the same engine. Directly he
  gives to your hand, by affording him more liberty you show him that he has
  met your wishes, and done what you asked. If you put the martingale on your
  bridoon rein you can no longer indicate approval. To avoid its control he
  must lean on the discomfort of his curb, and it puzzles no less than it
  discourages him, to find that every effort to please you is met, one way or
  the other, by restraint. So much for his convenience; now for your own. I
  will suppose you are using the common hunting martingale, attached to the
  breast-plate of your saddle, not to its girths. Be careful that the rings are
  too small to slip over those of the curb-bit; you will be in an awkward
  predicament if, after rising at a fence, your horse in the moment that he
  tries to extend himself finds his nose tied down to his knees.</p>

  <p>Neither must you shorten it too much at first; rather accustom your pupil
  gradually to its restraint, and remember that all horses are not shaped
  alike; some are so formed that they must needs carry their heads higher, and,
  as you choose to think, in a worse place than others. Tuition in all its
  branches cannot be too gradual, and nature, whether of man or beast, is less
  easily driven than led. The first consideration in riding is, no doubt, to
  make our horses do what we desire; but when this elementary object has been
  gained, it is of great importance to our comfort that they should accept our
  wishes as their own, persuaded that they exert themselves voluntarily in the
  service of their riders. For this it is essential to use such a bridle as
  they do not fear to meet, yet feel unwilling to disobey. Many high-couraged
  horses, with sensitive mouths, no uncommon combination, and often united to
  those propelling powers in hocks and quarters that are so valuable to a
  hunter, while they scorn restraint by the mild influence of the snaffle,
  fight tumultuously against the galling restriction of a curb. For these the
  scion of a noble family, that has produced many fine riders, invented a
  bridle, combining, as its enemies declare, the defects of both, to which he
  has given his name.</p>

  <p>In England there seems a very general prejudice against the Pelham,
  whereas in Ireland we see it in constant use. Like other bridles of a
  peculiar nature it is adapted for peculiar horses; and I have myself had
  three or four excellent hunters that would not be persuaded to go comfortably
  in anything else.</p>

  <p>I need hardly explain the construction of a Pelham. It consists of a
  single bit, smooth and jointed, like a common snaffle, but prolonged from the
  rings on either side to a cheek, having a second rein attached, which acts,
  by means of a curb-chain round the lower jaw, in the same manner, though to a
  modified extent, as the curb-rein of the usual hunting double-bridle, to
  which it bears an outward resemblance, and of which it seems a mild and
  feeble imitation. I have never to this day made out whether or not a keen
  young sportsman was amusing himself at my expense, when, looking at my
  horse's head thus equipped, he asked the simple question: "Do you find it a
  good plan to have your snaffle and curb all in one?" I _did_ find it a good
  plan with that particular horse, and at the risk of appearing egotistical I
  will explain why, by narrating the circumstances under which I first
  discovered his merits, illustrating as they do the special advantages of this
  unpopular implement.</p>

  <p>The animal in question, thoroughbred, and amongst hunters exceedingly
  speedy, was unused to jumping when I purchased him, and from his unaffected
  delight in their society, I imagine had never seen hounds. He was active,
  however, high-couraged, and only too willing to be in front; but with a
  nervous, excitable temperament, and every inclination to pull hard, he had
  also a highly sensitive mouth. The double-bridle in which he began his
  experiences annoyed him sadly; he bounced, fretted, made himself thoroughly
  disagreeable, and our first day was a pleasure to neither of us. Next time I
  bethought me of putting on a Pelham, and the effect of its greater liberty
  seemed so satisfactory that to enhance it, I took the curb-chain off
  altogether. I was in the act of pocketing the links, when a straight-necked
  fox broke covert, pointing for a beautiful grass country, and the hounds came
  pouring out with a burning scent, not five hundred yards from his brush. I
  remounted pretty quick, but my thoroughbred one&mdash;in racing language, "a
  good beginner"&mdash;was quicker yet, and my feet were hardly in the
  stirrups, ere he had settled to his stride, and was flying along in rather
  too close proximity to the pack. Happily, there was plenty of room, and the
  hounds ran unusually hard, for my horse fairly broke away with me in the
  first field, and although he allowed me by main force to steady him a little
  at his fences, during ten minutes at least I know who was _not_ master! He
  calmed, however, before the end of the burst, which was a very brilliant
  gallop, over a practicable country, and when I sent him home at two o'clock,
  I felt satisfied I had a game, good horse, that would soon make a capital
  hunter.</p>

  <p>Now I am persuaded our timely _escapade_ was of the utmost service. It
  gave him confidence in his rider's hand; which, with this light Pelham bridle
  he found could inflict on him no pain, and only directed him the way he
  delighted to go. On his next appearance in the hunting-field, he was not
  afraid to submit to a little more restraint, and so by degrees, though I am
  bound to admit, the process took more than one season, he became a steady,
  temperate conveyance, answering the powerful conventional double-bridle with
  no less docility than the most sedate of his stable companions. We have seen
  a great deal of fun together since, but never such a game of romps as our
  first!</p>

  <p>Why are so many brilliant horses difficult to ride? It ought not to be so.
  The truest shape entails the truest balance, consequently the smoothest paces
  and the best mouth. The fault is neither of form nor temper, but originates,
  if truth must be told, in the prejudices of the breaker, who will not vary
  his system to meet the requirements of different pupils. The best hunters
  have necessarily great power behind the saddle, causing them to move with
  their hind-legs so well under them, that they will not, and indeed cannot
  lean on the rider's hand. This the breaker calls "facing their bit," and the
  shyer they seem of that instrument, the harder he pulls. Up go their heads to
  avoid the pain, till that effort of self-defence becomes a habit, and it
  takes weeks of patience and fine horsemanship to undo the effects of
  unnecessary ill-usage for an hour.</p>

  <p>Eastern horses, being broke from the first in the severest possible bits,
  all acquire this trick of throwing their noses in the air; but as they have
  never learned to pull, for the Oriental prides himself on riding with a
  "finger," you need only give them an easy bridle and a martingale to make
  them go quietly and pleasantly, with heads in the right place, delighted to
  find control not necessarily accompanied by pain.</p>

  <p>And this indeed is the whole object of our numerous inventions. A
  light-mouthed horse steered by a good rider, will cross a country safely and
  satisfactorily in a Pelham bridle, with a running martingale on the _lower_
  rein. It is only necessary to give him his head at his fences, that is to
  say, to let his mouth alone, the moment he leaves the ground. That the man he
  carries can hold a horse up, while landing, I believe to be a fallacy, that
  he gives him every chance in a difficulty by sitting well back and not
  interfering with his efforts to recover himself, I know to be a fact. The
  rider cannot keep too quiet till the last moment, when his own knee touches
  the ground, then, the sooner he parts company the better, turning his face
  towards his horse if possible, so as not to lose sight of the falling mass,
  and, above all, holding the bridle in his hand.</p>

  <p>The last precaution cannot be insisted on too strongly. Not to mention the
  solecism of being afoot in boots and breeches during a run, and the cruel tax
  we inflict on some brother sportsman, who, being too good a fellow to leave
  us in the lurch, rides his own horse furlongs out of his line to go and catch
  ours, there is the further consideration of personal safety to life and limb.
  That is a very false position in which a man finds himself, when the animal
  is on its legs again, who cannot clear his foot from the stirrup, and has let
  his horse's head go!</p>

  <p>I believe too that a tenacious grasp on the reins saves many a broken
  collar-bone, as it cants the rider's body round in the act of falling, so
  that the cushion of muscle behind it, rather than the point of his shoulder,
  is the first place to touch the ground; and no one who has ever been "pitched
  into" by a bigger boy at school can have forgotten that this part of the body
  takes punishment with the greatest impunity. But we are wandering from our
  subject. To hold on like grim death when down, seems an accomplishment little
  akin to the contents of a chapter professing to deal with the skilful use of
  the bridle.</p>

  <p>The horse, except in peculiar cases, such as a stab with a sharp
  instrument, shrinks like other animals from pain. If he cannot avoid it in
  one way he will in another. When suffering under the pressure of his bit, he
  endeavours to escape the annoyance, according to the shape and setting on of
  his neck and shoulders, either by throwing his head up to the level of a
  rider's eyes, or dashing it down between his own knees. The latter is by far
  the most pernicious manoeuvre of the two, and to counteract it has been
  constructed the instrument we call "a gag."</p>

  <p>This is neither more nor less than another snaffle bit of which the
  head-stall and rein, instead of being separately attached to the rings, are
  in one piece running through a swivel, so that a leverage is obtained on the
  side of the mouth of such power as forces the horse's head upwards to its
  proper level. In a gag and snaffle no horse can continue "boring," as it is
  termed against his rider's hand; in a gag and curb he is indeed a hard puller
  who will attempt to run away.</p>

  <p>But with this bridle, adieu to all those delicacies of fingering which
  form the great charm of horsemanship, and are indeed the master touches of
  the art. A gag cannot be drawn gently through the mouth with hands parted and
  lowered on each side so as to "turn and wind a fiery Pegasus," nor is the
  bull-headed beast that requires it one on which, without long and patient
  tuition, you may hope to "witch the world with noble horsemanship." It is at
  best but a schoolmaster, and like the curbless Pelham in which my horse ran
  away with me, only a step in the right direction towards such willing
  obedience as we require. Something has been gained when our horse learns we
  have power to control him; much when he finds that power exerted for his own
  advantage.</p>

  <p>I would ride mine in a chain-cable if by no other means I could make him
  understand that he must submit to my will, hoping always eventually to
  substitute for it a silken thread.</p>

  <p>All bridles, by whatever names they may be called, are but the
  contrivances of a government that depends for authority on concealment of its
  weakness. Hard hands will inevitably make hard pullers, but to the animal
  intellect a force still untested is a force not lightly to be defied. The
  loose rein argues confidence, and even the brute understands that confidence
  is an attribute of power.</p>

  <p>Change your bridle over and over again, till you find one that suits your
  hand, rather, I should say, that suits your horse's mouth. Do not, however,
  be too well satisfied with a first essay. He may go delightfully to-day in a
  bit that he will learn how to counteract by to-morrow. Nevertheless, a long
  step has been made in the right direction when he has carried you pleasantly
  if only for an hour. Should that period have been passed in following hounds,
  it is worth a whole week's education under less exciting conditions. A horse
  becomes best acquainted with his rider in those situations that call forth
  most care and circumspection from both.</p>

  <p>Broken ground, fords, morasses, dark nights, all tend to mutual good
  understanding, but forty minutes over an inclosed country establishes the
  partnership of man and beast on such relations of confidence as much
  subsequent indiscretion fails to efface. The same excitement that rouses his
  courage seems to sharpen his faculties and clear his brain. It is wonderful
  how soon he begins to understand your meaning as conveyed literally from
  "hand to mouth," how cautiously he picks his steps amongst stubs or
  rabbit-holes, when the loosened rein warns him he must look out for himself,
  how boldly he quickens his stride and collects his energies for the fence he
  is approaching, when he feels grip and grasp tighten on back and bridle,
  conscious that you mean to "catch hold of his head and send him at it!" while
  loving you all the better for this energy of yours that stimulates his
  own.</p>

  <p>And now we come to a question admitting of no little discussion, inasmuch
  as those practitioners differ widely who are best capable of forming an
  opinion. The advocates of the loose rein, who though outnumbered at the
  covert-side, are not always in a minority when the hounds run, maintain that
  a hunter never acquits himself so well as while let completely alone; their
  adversaries, on the other hand, protest that the first principle of
  equitation, is to keep fast hold of your horse's head at all times and under
  all circumstances. "You pull him into his fences," argues Finger. "_You_ will
  never pull him out of them," answers Fist. "Get into a bucket and try to lift
  yourself by the handles!" rejoins Finger, quoting from an apposite
  illustration of Colonel Greenwood's, as accomplished a horseman as his
  brother, also a colonel, whose fine handling I have already mentioned. "A
  horse isn't a bucket," returns Fist, triumphantly; "why, directly you let his
  head go does he stop in a race, refuse a brook, or stumble when tired on the
  road?"</p>

  <p>It is a thousand pities that he cannot tell us which of the two systems he
  prefers himself. We may argue from theory, but can only judge by practice;
  and must draw our inferences rather from personal experience than the
  subtlest reasoning of the schools.</p>

  <p>Now if all horses were broke by such masters of the art as General
  Lawrenson and Mr. Mackenzie Greaves, riders who combine the strength and
  freedom of the hunting field with the scientific exercise of hands and limbs,
  as taught in the _haute &eacute;cole_, so obedient would they become to our
  gestures, nay, to the inflection of our bodies, that they might be trusted
  over the strongest lordship in Leicestershire with their heads quite loose,
  or, for that matter, with no bridle at all. But equine education is usually
  conducted on a very different system to that of Monsieur Baucher, or either
  of the above-named gentlemen. From colthood horses have been taught to
  understand, paradoxically enough, that a dead pull against the jaws means,
  "Go on, and be hanged to you, till I alter the pressure as a hint for you to
  stop."</p>

  <p>It certainly seems common sense, that when we tug at a horse's bridle he
  should oblige us by coming to a halt, yet, in his fast paces, we find the
  pull produces a precisely contrary effect; and for this habit, which during
  the process of breaking has become a second nature, we must make strong
  allowances, particularly in the hurry and excitement of crossing a country
  after a pack of hounds.</p>

  <p>It has happened to most of us, no doubt, at some period to have owned a
  favourite, whose mouth was so fine, temper so perfect, courage so reliable,
  and who had so learned to accommodate pace and action to our lightest
  indications, that when thus mounted we felt we could go tit-tupping over a
  country with slackened rein and toe in stirrup, as if cantering in the Park.
  As we near our fence, a little more forbidding, perhaps, than common, every
  stride seems timed like clockwork, and, unwilling to interfere with such
  perfect mechanism, we drop our hand, trusting wholly in the honour of our
  horse. At the very last stride the traitor refuses, and whisks round. "_Et tu
  brute!_" we exclaim&mdash;"Are _you_ also a brute?"&mdash;and catching him
  vigorously by the head, we ram him again at the obstacle to fly over it like
  a bird. Early associations had prevailed, and our stanch friend disappointed
  us, not from cowardice, temper, nor incapacity, but only from the influence
  of an education based on principles contrary to common sense.</p>

  <p>The great art of horsemanship, then, is to find out what the animal
  requires of us, and to meet its wishes, even its prejudices, half-way. Cool
  with the rash, and daring with the cautious, it is wise to retain the
  semblance, at least, of a self-possession superior to casualties, and equal
  to any emergency, from a refusal to a fall. Though "give and take" is the
  very first principle of handling, too sudden a variation of pressure has a
  tendency to confuse and flurry a hunter, whether in the gallop or when
  collecting itself for the leap. If you have been holding a horse hard by the
  head, to let him go in the last stride is very apt to make him run into his
  fence; while, if you have been riding with a light hand and loosened rein, a
  "chuck under the chin" at an inopportune moment distracts his attention, and
  causes him to drop short. "How did you get your fall?" is a common question
  in the hunting-field. If the partner at one end of the bridle could speak,
  how often would he answer, "Through bad riding;" when the partner at the
  other dishonestly replies, "The brute didn't jump high enough, or far enough,
  that was all." It is well for the most brilliant reputations that the noble
  animal is generous as he is brave, and silent as he is wise.</p>

  <p>I have already observed there are many more kinds of bridles than those
  just mentioned. Major Dwyer's, notably, of which the principle is an exact
  fitting of bridoon and curb-bits to the horse's mouth, seems to give general
  satisfaction; and Lord Gardner, whose opinion none are likely to dispute,
  stamps it with his approval. I confess, however, to a preference for the
  old-fashioned double-bridles, such as are called respectively the Dunchurch,
  Nos. 1 and 2, being persuaded that these will meet the requirements of nine
  horses out of ten that have any business in the hunting-field. The first,
  very large, powerful, and of stronger leverage than the second, should be
  used with discretion, but, in good hands, is an instrument against which the
  most resolute puller, if he insists on fighting with it, must contend in
  vain. Thus tackled, and ridden by such a horseman as Mr. Angerstein, for
  instance, of Weeting, in Norfolk, I do not believe there are half-a-dozen
  hunters in England that could get the mastery. Whilst living in
  Northamptonshire I remember he owned a determined runaway, not
  inappropriately called "Hard Bargain," that in this bridle he could turn and
  twist like a pony. I have no doubt he has not forgotten the horse, nor a
  capital run from Misterton, in which, with his usual kindness, he lent him
  thus bridled to a friend.</p>

  <p>I have seen horses go very pleasantly in what I believe is called the
  half-moon bit, of which the bridoon, having no joint, is shaped so as to take
  the curve of the animal's mouth. I have never tried one, but the idea seems
  good, as based on the principle of comfort to the horse. When we can arrive
  at that essential, combined with power to the rider, we may congratulate
  ourselves on possessing the right bridle at last, and need have no scruple in
  putting the animal to its best pace, confident we can stop it at will.</p>

  <p>We should never forget that the faster hounds run, the more desirable is
  it to have perfect control of our conveyance; and that a hunter of very
  moderate speed, easy to turn, and quick on its legs, will cross a country
  with more expedition than a race-horse that requires half a field to "go
  about;" and that we dare not extend lest, "with too much way on," he should
  get completely out of our hand. Once past the gap you fancied, you will never
  find a place in the fence you like so well again.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE ABUSE OF THE SPUR.</h2>

  <p class="verse">"You may ride us,<br>
  With one soft kiss, a thousand furlongs, ere<br>
  With spurs we heat an acre."</p>

  <p class="first">Says Hermione, and indeed that gentle lady's illustration
  equally applies to an inferior order of beings, from which also man derives
  much comfort and delight. It will admit of discussion whether the "armed
  heel," with all its terrors, has not, on the race-course at least, lost more
  triumphs than it has won.</p>

  <p>I have been told that Fordham, who seems to be first past the judges'
  chair oftener than any jockey of the day, wholly repudiates "the tormentors,"
  arguing that they only make a horse shorten his stride, and "shut up," to use
  an expressive term, instead of struggling gallantly home. Judging by analogy,
  it is easy to conceive that such may be the case. The tendency of the human
  frame seems certainly to contract rather than expand its muscles, with
  instinctive repugnance at the stab of a sharp instrument, or even the
  puncture of a thorn. It is not while receiving punishment but administering
  it that the prize-fighter opens his shoulders and lets out. There is no doubt
  that many horses, thoroughbred ones especially, will stop suddenly, even in
  their gallop, and resent by kicking an indiscreet application of the spurs. A
  determined rider who keeps them screwed in the animal's flanks eventually
  gains the victory. But such triumphs of severity and main force are the last
  resource of an authority that ought never to be disputed, as springing less
  from fear than confidence and good-will.</p>

  <p>It cannot be denied that there are many fools in the world, yet, regarding
  matters of opinion, the majority are generally right. A top-boot has an
  unfinished look without its appendage of shining steel; and, although some
  sportmen assure us they dispense with rowels, it is rare to find one so
  indifferent to appearances as not to wear spurs. There must be some good
  reason for this general adoption of an instrument that, from the days of
  chivalry, has been the very stamp and badge of a superiority which the man on
  horseback assumes over the man on foot. Let us weigh the arguments for and
  against this emblem of knighthood before we decide. In the riding-school, and
  particularly for military purposes, when the dragoon's right hand is required
  for his weapon, these aids, as they are called, seem to enhance that pressure
  of the leg which acts on the horse's quarters, as the rein on his forehand,
  bringing his whole body into the required position. Perhaps if the boot were
  totally unarmed much time might be lost in making his pupil understand the
  horseman's wishes, but any one who has ridden a perfectly trained charger
  knows how much more accurately it answers to the leg than the heel, and how
  awkwardly a horse acquits himself that has been broke in very sharp spurs;
  every touch causing it to wince and swerve too far in the required direction,
  glancing off at a tangent, like a boat that is over ready in answering her
  helm. Patience and a light switch, I believe, would fulfil all the purposes
  of the spur, even in the _man&eacute;ge_; but delay is doubtless a drawback,
and
  there are reasons for going the shortest way on occasion, even if it be not
  the smoothest and the best.</p>

  <p>It is quite unnecessary, however, and even prejudicial, to have the rowels
  long and sharp. Nothing impedes tuition like fear; and fear in the animal
  creation is the offspring of pain.</p>

  <p>Granted, then, that the spur may be applied advantageously in the school,
  let us see how far it is useful on the road or in the hunting-field.</p>

  <p>We will start by supposing that you do not possess a really perfect hack;
  that desirable animal must, doubtless, exist somewhere, but, like Pegasus, is
  more often talked of than seen. Nevertheless, the roadster that carries you
  to business or pleasure is a sound, active, useful beast, with safe, quick
  action, good shoulders, of course, and a willing disposition, particularly
  when turned towards home. How often in a week do you touch it with the spurs?
  Once, perhaps, by some bridle-gate, craftily hung at precisely the angle
  which prevents your reaching its latch or hasp. And what is the result of
  this little display of vexation? Your hack gets flurried, sticks his nose in
  the air, refuses to back, and compels you at last to open the gate with your
  wrong hand, rubbing your knee against the post as he pushes through in
  unseemly haste, for fear of another prod. When late for dinner, or hurrying
  home to outstrip the coming shower, you may fondly imagine that but for "the
  persuaders" you would have been drenched to the skin; and, relating your
  adventures at the fire-side, will probably declare that "you stuck the spurs
  into him the last mile, and came along as hard as he could drive." But, if
  you were to visit him in the stable, you would probably find his flanks
  untouched, and would, I am sure, be pleased rather than disappointed at the
  discovery. Happily, not one man in ten knows _how_ to spur a horse, and the
  tenth is often the most unwilling to administer so severe a punishment.</p>

  <p>Ladies, however, are not so merciful. Perhaps because they have but one,
  they use this stimulant liberally, and without compunction. From their seat,
  and shortness of stirrup, every kick tells home. Concealed under a
  riding-habit, these vigorous applications are unsuspected by lookers-on; and
  the unwary wonder why, in the streets of London or the Park, a ladies' horse
  always appears to go in a lighter and livelier form than that of her male
  companion. "It's a woman's hand," says the admiring pedestrian. "Not a bit of
  it," answers the cynic who knows; "it's a woman's heel."</p>

  <p>But, however sparing you may be of the spurs in lane or bridle-road, you
  are tempted to ply them far too freely in the anxiety and excitement of the
  hunting-field. Have you ever noticed the appearance of a white horse at the
  conclusion of some merry gallop over a strongly fenced country? The pure
  conspicuous colour tells sad tales, and the smooth, thin-skinned flanks are
  too often stained and plastered with red. Many bad horsemen spur their horses
  without meaning it; many worse, mean to spur their horses at every fence, and
  _do_.</p>

  <p>A Leicestershire notability, of the last generation once dubbed a rival
  with the expressive title of "a hard funker;" and the term, so happily
  applied, fully rendered what he meant. Of all riders "the hard funker" is the
  most unmerciful to his beast; at every turn he uses his spurs cruelly, not
  because he is _hard_, but because he _funks_. Let us watch him crossing a
  country, observing his style as a warning rather than an example.</p>

  <p>Hesitation and hurry are his principal faults, practised, with much
  impartiality, in alternate extremes. Though half-way across a field, he is
  still undecided where to get out. This vacillation communicates itself in
  electric sympathy to his horse, and both go wavering down to their fence,
  without the slightest idea what they mean to do when they arrive. Some ten
  strides off the rider makes up his mind, selecting, probably, an extremely
  awkward place, for no courage is so desperate as that which is founded on
  fear. Want of determination is now supplemented by excessive haste and, with
  incessant application of the spurs, his poor horse is hurried wildly at the
  leap. That it gets over without falling, as happens oftener than might be
  supposed, seems due to activity in the animal rather than sagacity in the
  rider, and a strong instinct of self-preservation in both; but such a
  process, repeated again and again during a gallop, even of twenty minutes,
  tells fearfully on wind and muscle, nor have many hunters sufficient powers
  of endurance to carry these exacting performers through a run.</p>

  <p>Still the "h. f." would be nothing without his spurs, and I grant that to
  him these instruments are indispensable, if he is to get from one field to
  another; but of what use are they to such men as Mr. Gilmour, Captain
  Coventry, Sir Frederic Johnston, Captain Boyce, Mr. Hugh Lowther, and a host
  more that I could name, who seem to glide over Leicestershire, and other
  strongly-fenced countries, as a bird glides through the air. Day after day,
  unless accidentally scored in a fall, you may look in vain for a spur-mark on
  their horses sides. Shoulders and quarters, indeed, are reddened by gashes
  from a hundred thorns; but the virgin spot, a handsbreadth behind the girths,
  is pure and stainless still. Yet not one of the gentlemen I have named will
  ride without the instrument he uses so rarely, if at all; and they must
  cherish, therefore, some belief in its virtue, when called into play, strong
  enough to counterbalance its indisputable disadvantages&mdash;notably, the
  stabbing of a hunter's side, when its rider's foot is turned outwards by a
  stake or grower, and the tearing of its back or quarters in the struggle and
  confusion of a fall. There is one excellent reason that, perhaps, I may have
  overlooked. It is tiresome to answer the same question over and over again,
  and in a field of 200 sportsmen you are sure to be asked almost as many
  times, "Why don't you wear spurs?" if you set appearances at defiance by
  coming into the hunting-field without them.</p>

  <p>In my personal recollection I can only call to mind one man who
  systematically abjured so essential a finish to the horseman's dress and
  equipment. This was Mr. Tomline of Leigh Lodge, a Leicestershire farmer and
  horse-dealer, well-known some thirty years ago as one of the finest riders
  and straightest goers that ever got into a saddle. His costume, indeed, was
  not of so careful a nature that want of completeness in any one particular
  could spoil the general effect. He _always_ hunted in a rusty, worn
  pilot-jacket, drab breeches with strings untied, brown-topped boots, and a
  large ill-fitting hat, carrying in his hand a ground-ash plant, totally
  useless for opening a gate if he did not happen to jump it. Yet thus
  accoutred, and generally on a young one, so long as his horse's condition
  lasted, he was sure to be in front, and, when the fences were rougher than
  common, with but two or three companions at most.</p>

  <p>I have not yet forgotten the style in which I once saw him coax a
  four-year-old to jump a "bottom" under Launde, fortified by a high post and
  rail&mdash;down-hill&mdash;a bad take off&mdash;and almost a ravine on the
  far side! With his powerful grip and exquisite handling, he seemed to
  persuade the pupil that it was as willing as the master.</p>

  <p>My own spurs were four inches long, and I was riding the best hunter in my
  stable, but I don't think I would have had the same place for fifty
  pounds!</p>

  <p>A paradox, like an Irishman's bull, will sometimes convey our meaning more
  impressively than a logical statement. It seems paradoxical, yet I believe it
  is sound sense to say that no man should arm his heels with spurs unless he
  is so good a rider as to be sure they shall not touch his horse. To punish
  him with them involuntarily is, of course, like any other blunder totally
  inadmissible, but when applied with intention, they should be used sparingly
  and only as a last resource. That there _are_ occasions on which they rouse a
  horse's energies for a momentary effort, I am disposed to admit less from my
  own experience than the opinion of those for whose practical knowledge in all
  such matters I have the greatest respect. Both the Messrs. Coventry, in
  common with other first-rate steeple-chase riders, advocate their use on rare
  occasions and under peculiar circumstances. Poor Jem Mason never went hunting
  without them, and would not, I think, have hesitated to apply them pretty
  freely if required, but then these could all spur their horses in the right
  place, leaning back the while and altering in no way the force and bearing of
  hand or seat. Most men, on the contrary, stoop forward and let their horses'
  heads go when engaged in this method of compulsion, and even if their heels
  _do_ reach the mark, by no means a certainty, gain but little with the rowels
  compared to all they lose with the reins.</p>

  <p>There is no fault in a hunter so annoying to a man whose heart is in the
  sport as a tendency _to refuse_. It utterly defeats the timid and damps the
  courage of the bold, while even to him who _rides_ that he may hunt rather
  than _hunts_ that he may _ride_, it is intensely provoking, as he is apt to
  lose by it that start which is so invaluable in a quick thing, and, when a
  large field are all struggling for the same object, so difficult to regain.
  This perversity of disposition too, is very apt to be displayed at some fence
  that will not admit of half-measures, such as a rail low enough to jump, but
  too strong to break, or a ditch so wide and deep that it must not be
  attempted as a standing leap. In these cases a vigorous dig with the spurs at
  the last moment will sometimes have an excellent effect. But it must not be
  trusted as an unfailing remedy. Nearly as many hunters will resent so broad a
  hint, by stopping short, and turning restive, as will spring generously
  forward, and make a sudden effort in answer to the appeal. For this, as for
  every other requirement of equitation, much depends on an insight into his
  character, whom an enthusiastic friend of mine designates "the bolder and
  wiser animal of the two."</p>

  <p>Few men go out hunting with the expectation of encountering more than one
  or two falls in the best of runs, although the score sometimes increases very
  rapidly, when a good and gallant horse is getting tired towards the finish.
  Twenty "croppers" in a season, if he is well-mounted, seems a high average
  for the most determined of bruisers, but a man, whom circumstances impel to
  ride whatever he can lay hands on, must take into consideration how he can
  best rise from the ground unhurt with no less forethought than he asks his
  way to the meet or inquires into the condition of his mount. To such a bold
  rider the spur may seem an indispensable article, but he must remember that
  even if its application should save him on occasion, which I am not
  altogether prepared to admit, the appendage itself is most inconvenient when
  down. I cannot remember a single instance of a man's foot remaining fixed in
  the stirrup who was riding without spurs. I do not mean to say such a
  catastrophe is impossible, but I have good reason to know that the buckle on
  the instep, which when brightly polished imparts such a finish to the
  lustrous wrinkles of a well-made boot, is extremely apt to catch in the angle
  of the stirrup iron, and hold us fast at the very moment when it is most
  important to our safety we should be free.</p>

  <p>I have headed this chapter "The Abuse of the Spur," because I hold that
  implement of horsemanship to be in general most unmercifully abused, so much
  so that I believe it would be far better for the majority of horses, and
  riders too, if it had never come into vogue. The perfect equestrian may be
  trusted indeed with rowels sharp and long as those that jingle at the
  Mexican's heels on his boundless prairies, but, as in the days of chivalry,
  these ornaments should be won by prowess to be worn with honour; and I firmly
  believe that nine out of every ten men who come out hunting would be better
  and more safely carried if they left their spurs at home.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; HAND.</h2>

  <p class="first">What is it? Intellect, nerve, sympathy, confidence, skill?
  None of these can be said to constitute this quality; rather it is a
  combination of all, with something superinduced that can only be called a
  magnetic affinity between the aggressive spirit of man and the ductile nature
  of the beast.</p>

  <p class="verse">"He spurred the old horse, and he held him tight,<br>
  And leaped him out over the wall,"</p>

  <p class="first">says Kingsley, in his stirring ballad of "The Knight's Last
  Leap at Alten-ahr;" and Kingsley, an excellent rider himself, thus described
  exactly how the animal should have been put at its formidable fence. Most
  poets would have let their horse's head go&mdash;the loose rein is a
  favourite method of making play in literature&mdash;and a fatal refusal must
  have been the result. The German Knight, however, whose past life seems to
  have been no less disreputable than his end was tragic, had not</p>

  <p class="verse">"Lived by the saddle for years a score,"</p>

  <p class="first">to fail in his horsemanship at the finish, and so, when he
  came to jump his last fence, negotiated it with no less skill than
  daring&mdash;grim, quiet, resolute, strong of seat, and firm of hand. The
  latter quality seems, however, much the rarer of the two. For ten men who can
  stick to the saddle like Centaurs you will hardly find one gifted with that
  nicety of touch which horses so willingly obey, and which, if not inborn,
  seems as difficult to acquire by practice as the draughtsman's eye for
  outline, or the musician's ear for sound. Attention, reflection, painstaking,
  and common sense, can, nevertheless, do much; and, if the brain will only
  take the trouble to think, the clumsiest fingers that ever mismanaged a
  bridle may be taught in time to humour it like a silken thread.</p>

  <p>I have been told, though I never tried the experiment, that if you take
  bold chanticleer from his perch, and, placing his bill on a table, draw from
  it a line of chalk by candle-light, the poor dazed fowl makes no attempt to
  stir from this imaginary bondage, persuaded that it is secured by a cord it
  has not strength enough to break. We should never get on horseback without
  remembering this unaccountable illusion; our control by means of the bridle
  is, in reality, little more substantial than the chalk-line that seems to
  keep the bird in durance. It should be our first consideration so to manage
  the rein we handle as never to give our horse the opportunity of discovering
  our weakness and his own strength.</p>

  <p>How is this to be effected? By letting his head go, and allowing him to
  carry us where he will? Certainly not, or we should have no need for the
  bridle at all. By pulling at him, then, with main strength, and trying the
  muscular power of our arms against that of his shoulders and neck? Comparing
  these relative forces again, we are constrained to answer, Certainly not; the
  art of control is essentially founded on compromise. In riding, as in
  diplomacy, we must always be ready to give an inch that we may take an ell.
  The first principle of horsemanship is to make the animal believe we can rule
  its wildest mood; the next, to prevent, at any sacrifice, the submission of
  this plausible theory to proof. You get on a horse you have never seen
  before, improperly bitted, we may fairly suppose, for few men would think of
  wasting as many seconds on their bridle as they devote minutes to their boots
  and breeches. You infer, from his wild eye and restless ear that he is "a bit
  of a romp;" and you observe, with some concern, that surrounding
  circumstances, a race, a review, a coursing-meeting, or a sure find, it
  matters little which, are likely to rouse all the tumultuous propensities of
  his nature. Obviously it would be exceedingly bad policy to have the
  slightest misunderstanding. The stone of Sisyphus gathered impetus less
  rapidly than does a horse who is getting the better of his rider; and John
  Gilpin was not the first equestrian, by a good many, for whom</p>

  <p class="verse">"The trot became a gallop soon,<br>
  In spite of curb and rein."</p>

  <p>"I am the owner, I wish I could say the _master_, of the four best hunters
  I ever had in my life," wrote one of the finest horsemen in Europe to a
  brother proficient in the art; and although so frank an avowal would have
  seemed less surprising from an inferior performer, his friend, who was also
  in the habit of riding anything, anywhere, and over everything, doubtless
  understood perfectly what he meant.</p>

  <p>Now in equitation there can be no divided empire; and the horse will most
  assuredly be master if the man is not. In the interests of good government,
  then, beware how you let your authority literally slip through your fingers,
  for, once lost, it will not easily be regained.</p>

  <p>Draw your reins gently to an equal length, and ascertain the precise
  bearing on your horse's mouth that seems, while he is yet in a walk, to
  influence his action without offending his sensitiveness. But this cannot be
  accomplished with the hands alone; these members, though supposed to be the
  prime agents of control, will do little without the assistance of legs and
  knees pressing the sides and flanks of the animal, so as to urge him against
  the touch of his bit, from which he will probably show a tendency to recoil,
  and, as it is roughly called, "forcing him into his bridle."</p>

  <p>The absence of this leg-power is an incalculable disadvantage to ladies,
  and affords the strongest reason, amongst many, why they should be mounted
  only on temperate and perfectly broken horses. How much oftener would they
  come to grief but that their seat compels them to ride with such long reins
  as insure light hands, and that their finer sympathy seems fully understood
  and gratefully appreciated by the most sympathetic of all the brute
  creation!</p>

  <p>The style adopted by good horsewomen, especially in crossing a country,
  has in it much to be admired, something, also, to be deprecated and deplored.
  They allow their horses plenty of liberty, and certainly interfere but little
  with their heads, even at the greatest emergencies; but their ideas of pace
  are unreasonably liberal, and they are too apt to "chance it" at the fences,
  encouraging with voice and whip the haste that in the last few strides it is
  judicious to repress. It seems to me they are safer in a "bank-and-ditch"
  country than amongst the high strong fences of the grazing districts, where a
  horse must be roused and held together that he may jump well up in the air,
  and extend himself afterwards, so as to cover the wide "uncertainties" he may
  find on the landing side. For a bank he is pretty sure to collect himself
  without troubling his rider; and this is, perhaps, why Irishmen, as a general
  rule, use such light bridles.</p>

  <p>Now, a woman cannot possibly bring her horse up to a high staked-and-bound
  fence, out of deep ground, with the strength and resolution of a man, whose
  very grip in the saddle seems to extort from the animal its utmost energies.
  Half measures are fatal in a difficulty, and, as she seems unable to
  interfere with good effect she is wise to let it alone.</p>

  <p>We may learn from her, however, one of the most effective secrets of the
  whole art, and that is, to ride with long reins. "Always give them plenty of
  rope," said poor Jem Mason, when instructing a beginner; and he certainly
  practised what he preached. I have seen his hands carried so high as to be
  level with his elbows, _but his horse's head was always in the right place_;
  and to this must be attributed the fact that, while he rode to hounds
  straighter than anybody else, he got comparatively few falls. A man with long
  reins not only affords his horse greater liberty at his fences, but allows
  him every chance of recovery should he get into difficulties on landing, the
  rider not being pulled with a jerk on the animal's neck and shoulders, so as
  to throw both of them down, when they ought to have got off with a
  scramble.</p>

  <p>Let us return to the horse you have lately mounted, not without certain
  misgivings that he may be tempted to insubordination under the excitement of
  tumult, rivalry, or noise. When you have discovered the amount of repression,
  probably very slight, that he accepts without resentment, at a walk, increase
  your pace gradually, still with your legs keeping him well into his bridle,
  carrying your hands low down on his withers, and, if you take my advice, with
  a rein in each. You will find this method affords you great control of your
  horse's head, and enables you, by drawing the bit through his mouth, to
  counteract any arrangement on his part for a dead pull, which could have but
  one result. Should you, moreover, find it necessary to jump, you can thus
  hold him perfectly straight at his fences, so that he must either decline
  altogether or go exactly _where you put him_. Young, headstrong horses are
  exceedingly apt to swerve from the place selected for them, and to rise
  sideways at some strong bit of timber, or impracticable part of a bullfinch;
  and this is a most dangerous experiment, causing the worst kind of falls to
  which the sportsman is liable.</p>

  <p>Riding thus two-handed, you will probably find your new acquaintance
  "bends" to you in his canter better than in his trot, and if so, you may
  safely push him to a gallop, taking great care, however, not to let him
  extend himself too much. When he goes on his shoulders, he becomes a free
  agent; so long as his haunches are under him, you can keep him, as it is
  called, "in your hand."</p>

  <p>There is considerable scope for thought in this exercise of manual skill,
  and it is always wise to save labour of body by use of brain. Take care then,
  to have your front clear, so that your horse may flatter himself he is
  leading his comrades, when he will not give you half so much trouble to
  retain him in reasonable bounds. Strategy is here required no less than
  tactics, and horsemanship even as regards the bridle, is quite as much a
  matter of head as hand. If you are out hunting, and have got thus far on good
  terms, you will probably now be tempted to indulge in a leap. We cannot,
  unfortunately, select these obstacles exactly as we wish; it is quite
  possible your first fence may be high, strong, and awkward, with every
  probability of a fall. Take your horse at it quietly, but resolutely, in a
  canter, remembering that the quicker and _shorter_ his strides, while
  gathering _impetus_, the greater effort he can make when he makes his spring.
  Above all, measure with your eye, and endeavour to show him by the clip of
  your thighs, and the sway of your body, exactly where he should take off. On
  this important point depends, almost entirely, the success of your leap. Half
  a stride means some six or seven feet; to leave the ground that much too soon
  adds the width of a fair-sized ditch to his task, and if the sum total prove
  too much for him you cannot be surprised at the result. This is, I think, one
  of the most important points in horsemanship as applied to riding across a
  country. It is a detail in which Lord Wilton particularly excels, and
  although so good a huntsman must despise a compliment to his mere riding, I
  cannot refrain from mentioning Tom Firr, as another proficient who possesses
  this enviable knack in an extraordinary degree.</p>

  <p>Many of us can remember "Cap" Tomline, a professional "rough rider,"
  living at or near Billesdon, within the last twenty years, as fine a horseman
  as his namesake, whom I have already mentioned, and a somewhat lighter
  weight. For one sovereign, "Cap," as we used to call him, was delighted to
  ride anybody's horse under any circumstances, over, or into any kind of fence
  the owner chose to point out. After going brilliantly through a run, I have
  seen him, to my mind most injudiciously, desired to lark home alongside,
  while we watched his performance from the road. He was particularly fond of
  timber, and notwithstanding that his horse was usually rash, inexperienced,
  or bad-tempered, otherwise he would not have been riding him, I can call to
  mind very few occasions on which I saw him down. One unusually open winter,
  when he hunted five and six days a week from October to April, he told me he
  had only fifteen falls, and that taking the seasons as they came, thirteen
  was about his average. Nor was he a very light-weight&mdash;spare, lengthy,
  and muscular, he turned twelve stone in his hunting clothes, which were by no
  means of costly material. Horses rarely refused with him, and though they
  often had a scramble for it, as seldom fell, but under his method of riding,
  sitting well down in the saddle, with the reins in both hands, they never
  took off wrong, and in this lay the great secret of his superiority. When I
  knew him he was an exceedingly temperate man; for many years I believe he
  drank only water, and he eschewed tobacco in every form. "The reason you
  gentlemen have such _bad nerves_," he said to me, jogging home to Melton one
  evening in the dusk that always meets us about Somerby, "is because you smoke
  so much. It turns your brains to a kind of vapour!" the inference was
  startling, I thought, and not complimentary, but there might be some truth in
  it nevertheless.</p>

  <p>We have put off a great deal of time at our first fence, let us do it
  without a fall, if we can.</p>

  <p>When a hunter's quarters are under him in taking off, he has them ready to
  help him over any unforeseen difficulty that may confront him on the other
  side. Should there be a bank from which he can get a purchase for a second
  effort, he will poise himself on it lightly as a bird, or perhaps, dropping
  his hind-legs only, shoot himself well into the next field, with that
  delightful elasticity which, met by a corresponding action of his rider's
  loins, imparts to the horseman such sensations of confidence and dexterity as
  are felt by some buoyant swimmer, wafted home on the roll of an incoming
  wave. Strong hocks and thighs, a mutual predilection for the chase, a bold
  heart between the saddle-flaps, another under the waistcoat, and a pair of
  light hands, form a combination that few fences after Christmas are strong
  enough or blind enough to put down.</p>

  <p>And now please not to forget that soundest of maxims, applicable to all
  affairs alike by land or sea&mdash;"While she lies her course, let the ship
  steer herself." If your horse is going to his own satisfaction, do not be too
  particular that he should go entirely to yours. So long as you can steady
  him, never mind that he carries his head a little up or a little down. If he
  shakes it you know you have got him, and can pull him off in a hundred yards.
  Keep your hands quiet and not too low. It is a well-known fact, of which,
  however, many draughtsmen seem ignorant, that the horse in action never puts
  his fore-feet beyond his nose. You need only watch the finish of a race to be
  satisfied of this, and indeed the Derby winner in his supreme effort is
  almost as straight as an old-fashioned frigate, from stem to stern, while a
  line dropped perpendicularly from his muzzle would exactly touch the tips of
  his toes. Now, if your hands are on each side of your horse's withers, you
  make him bend his neck so much as to contract his stride within three-quarter
  speed, whereas when you carry them about the level of your own hips, and
  nearly as far back, he has enough freedom of head to extend himself without
  getting beyond your control, and room besides to look about him, of which be
  sure he will avail himself for your mutual advantage.</p>

  <p>I have ridden hunters that obviously found great pleasure in watching
  hounds, and, except to measure their fences, would never take their eyes off
  the pack from field to field, so long as we could keep it in sight. These
  animals too, were, invariably fine jumpers, free, generous, light-hearted,
  and as wise as they were bold.</p>

  <p>I heard a very superior performer once remark that he not only rode every
  horse differently, but he rode the same horse differently at every fence.</p>

  <p>All I can say is, he used to ride them all in the same place, well up with
  the hounds, but I think I understand what he meant. He had his system of
  course, like every other master of the art, but it admitted of endless
  variations according to circumstances and the exigencies of the case. No man,
  I conclude, rides so fast at a wall as a brook, though he takes equal pains
  with his handling in both cases, if in a different way, nor would he deny a
  half-tired animal that support, amounting even to a dead pull, which might
  cause a hunter fresh out of his stable to imagine his utmost exertions were
  required forthwith. Nevertheless, whether "lobbing along" through deep ground
  at the punishing period, when we wish our fun was over, or fingering a rash
  one delicately for his first fence, a stile, we will say, downhill with a bad
  take-off, when we could almost wish it had not begun, we equally require such
  a combination of skill, science, and sagacity, or rather common-sense, as
  goes by the name of "hand." When the player possesses this quality in
  perfection it is wonderful how much can be done with the instrument of which
  he holds the strings. I remember seeing the Reverend John Bower, an
  extraordinarily fine rider of the last generation, hand his horse over an
  ugly iron-bound stile, on to some stepping-stones, with a drop of six or
  seven feet, into a Leicestershire lane, as calmly as if the animal had been a
  lady whom he was taking out for a walk. He pulled it back into a trot,
  sitting very close and quiet, with his hand raised two or three inches above
  the withers, and I can still recall, as if I had seen it yesterday, the curve
  of neck and quarters, as, gently mouthing the bit, that well-broken hunter
  poised lightly for its spring, and landing in the same collected form, picked
  its way daintily, step by step, down the declivity, like a cat. There was a
  large field out, but though Leicestershire then, as now, had no lack of bold
  and jealous riders, who could use heads, hands, and beyond all, their heels,
  nobody followed him, and I think the attempt was better left alone.</p>

  <p>Another clergyman of our own day, whose name I forbear mentioning, because
  I think he would dislike it for professional reasons, has the finest
  bridle-hand of any one I know. "_You good man_," I once heard a foreigner
  observe to this gentleman, in allusion to his bold style of riding; "_it no
  matter if you break your neck!_" And although I cannot look on the loss of
  such valuable lives from the same point of view as this Continental moralist,
  I may be permitted to regret the present scarcity of clergymen in the
  hunting-field. It redounds greatly to their credit, for we know how many of
  them deny themselves a harmless pleasure rather than offend "the weaker
  brethren," but what a dog in the manger must the weaker brother be!</p>

  <p>I have never heard that these "hunting parsons," as they are called,
  neglect the smallest detail of duty to indulge in their favourite sport, but
  when they _do_ come out you may be sure to see them in the front rank. Can it
  be that the weaker brother is jealous of his pastor's superiority in the
  saddle? I hope not. At any rate it seems unfair to cavil at the enjoyment by
  another of the pursuit we affect ourselves. Let us show more even-handed
  justice, if not more charity, and endeavour at least to follow the good man's
  example in the parish, though we are afraid to ride his line across the
  fields.</p>

  <p>It would be endless to enter on all the different styles of horsemanship
  in which fine hands are of the utmost utility. On the race-course, for
  instance, it seems to an outsider that the whole performance of the jockey is
  merely a dead pull from end to end. But only watch the lightest urchin that
  is flung on a two-year-old to scramble home five furlongs as fast as ever he
  can come; you will soon be satisfied that even in these tumultuous flights
  there is room for the display of judgment, patience, though briefly tried,
  and manual skill. The same art is exercised on the light smooth snaffle, held
  in tenacious grasp, that causes the heavily-bitted charger to dance and
  "passage" in the school. It differs only in direction and degree. As much
  dexterity is required to prevent some playful flyer recently put in training
  from breaking out in a game of romps, when he ought to be minding his
  business in "the string" as to call forth the well-drilled efforts of a
  war-horse, answering wrist and leg with disciplined activity, ready to "rein
  back," "pass," "wheel,"&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"And high curvet that not in vain,<br>
  The sword-sway may descend amain<br>
  On foeman's casque below."</p><br>

  <p>Chifney, the great jockey of his day, wrote an elaborate treatise on
  handling, laying down the somewhat untenable position, that even a racehorse
  should be held as if with a silken thread.</p>

  <p>I have noticed, too, that our best steeplechase riders have particularly
  fine hands when crossing a country with hounds; nor does their professional
  practice seem to make them over-hasty at their fences, when there is time to
  do these with deliberation. I imagine that to ride a steeplechase well, over
  a strong line, is the highest possible test of what we may call "all-round"
  horsemanship. My own experience in the silk jacket has been of the slightest;
  and I confess that, like Falstaff with his reasons, I never fancied being
  rattled quite so fast at my fences "on compulsion."</p>

  <p>One of the finest pieces of riding I ever witnessed was in a steeplechase
  held at Melton, as long ago as the year 1864, when, happening to stand near
  the brook, _eighteen feet of water_, I observed my friend Captain Coventry
  come down at it. Choosing sound ground and a clear place, for it was already
  beginning to fill with numerous competitors, he set his horse going, at about
  a hundred yards from the brink; in the most masterly manner, increasing the
  pace resolutely but gradually, so as not to flurry or cause the animal to
  change his leg, nearly to full speed before he took off. I could not have
  believed it possible to make a horse go so fast in so collected a form; but
  with the rider's strength in the saddle, and perfectly skilful hands, he
  accomplished the feat, and got well over, I need hardly say, in his
  stride.</p>

  <p>But, although a fine "bridle-hand," as it is called, proves of such
  advantage to the horseman in the hurry-skurry of a steeplechase or a very
  quick thing with hounds, its niceties come more readily under the notice of
  an observer on the road than in the field. Perhaps the Ride in Hyde Park is
  the place of all others where this quality is most appreciated, and, shall we
  add? most rarely to be found. A perfect Park hack, that can walk or canter
  five miles an hour, no light criterion of action and balance, should also be
  so well broke, and so well ridden, as to change its leg, if asked to do so,
  at every stride. "With woven paces," if not "with waving arms," I have seen
  rider and horse threading in and out the trees that bisect Rotten Row,
  without missing _one_, for half a mile on end; the animal leading with near
  or off leg, as it inclined to left or right, guided only by the inflection of
  the rider's body, and the touch, too light to be called a pressure, of his
  knee and leg. How seldom does one see a horse ridden properly round a corner.
  He is usually allowed to turn on his shoulders, with his hind-legs too far
  back to be of the slightest assistance if he slips or stumbles, and should
  the foothold be greasy, as may happen in London streets, down he comes flat
  on his side. Even at a walk, or slow trot, he should be collected, and his
  outer flank pressed inwards by his rider's heel, so that the motive power in
  hocks and thighs is kept under his own body, and the weight on his back. In
  the canter it stands to reason that he should lead with the inner leg,
  otherwise it is very possible he may cross the other over it, and fall like a
  lump of lead.</p>

  <p>I remember seeing the famous Lord Anglesey ride his hack at that pace
  nineteen times out of Piccadilly into Albemarle Street, before it turned the
  corner exactly to his mind. The handsome old warrior who _looked_ no less
  distinguished than he _was_, had, as we know, a cork leg, and its oscillation
  no doubt interfered with those niceties of horsemanship in which he
  delighted. Nevertheless at the twentieth trial he succeeded, and a large
  crowd, collected to watch him, seemed glad of an opportunity to give their
  Waterloo hero a hearty cheer as he rode away.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the finest pair of hands to be seen amongst the frequenters of the
  Park in the present day belong to Mr. Mackenzie Greaves, a retired cavalry
  officer of our own service, who, passionately fond of hunting and everything
  connected with horses, has lately turned his attention to the subtleties of
  the _haute &eacute;cole_, nowhere better understood, by a select few, than
in Paris,
  where he usually resides. To watch this gentleman on a horse he has broken in
  himself, gliding through the crowd, as if by mere volition, with the
  smoothness, ease, and rapidity of a fish arrowing up a stream, makes one
  quite understand how the myth of the Centaur originated in the sculpture and
  poetry of Greece.</p>

  <p>In common with General Laurenson, whose name I have already mentioned as
  just such another proficient, his system is very similar to that of Monsieur
  Baucher, one of the few lovers of the animal either in France or England, who
  have so studied its character as to reduce equine education to a science. Its
  details are far too elaborate to enter on here, but one of its first
  principles, applied in the most elementary tuition, is never to let the horse
  recoil from his bridle.</p>

  <p>"Drop your hands!" say nine good riders out of ten, when the pupil's head
  is thrown up to avoid control. "Not so," replies Baucher. "On the contrary,
  tighten and increase your pressure more and more, keeping the rebel up to his
  bit with legs and spurs if necessary, till _he_ yields, not you; then on the
  instant, rapidly and dexterously, as you would strike in fly-fishing, give to
  him, and he will come into your hand!"</p>

  <p>I have tried his method myself, in more than one instance, and am inclined
  to think it is founded on common sense.</p>

  <p>But in all our dealings with him, we should remember that the horse's
  mouth is naturally delicate and sensitive though we so often find it hardened
  by violence and ill-usage. The amount of force we apply, therefore, whether
  small or great, should be measured no less accurately than the drops of
  laudanum administered to a patient by the nurse. Reins are intended for the
  guidance of the horse, not the support of his rider, and if you do not feel
  secure without holding on by something, rather than pluck at his mouth,
  accept the ridicule of the position with its safety, and grasp the mane!</p>

  <p>Seriously, you may do worse in a difficulty when your balance is in
  danger, and instinct prompts you to restore it, as, if a horse is struggling
  out of a bog, has dropped his hind-legs in a brook, or otherwise come on his
  nose without actually falling, nothing so impedes his endeavours to right
  himself as a tug of the bridle at an inopportune moment.</p>

  <p>That instrument should be used for its legitimate purposes alone, and a
  strong seat in the saddle is the first essential for a light hand on the
  rein.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; SEAT.</h2>

  <p class="first">Some people tell you they ride by "balance," others by
  "grip." I think a man might as well say he played the fiddle by "finger," or
  by ear. Surely in either case a combination of both is required to sustain
  the performance with harmony and success. The grip preserves the balance,
  which in turn prevents the grip becoming irksome. To depend on the one alone
  is to come home very often with a dirty coat, to cling wholly by the other is
  to court as much fatigue in a day as ought to serve for a week. I have more
  than once compared riding to swimming, it seems to require the same buoyancy
  of spirits, the same venture of body, the same happy combination of
  confidence, strength, and skill.</p>

  <p>The seat a man finds easiest to himself, says the inimitable Mr. Jorrocks,
  "will in all humane probability be the easiest to his 'oss!" and in this, as
  in every other remark of the humorous grocer, there is no little wisdom and
  truth. "If he go smooth, I am,"[95-1] said a Frenchman, to whom a friend of
  mine offered a mount, "if he go rough, I shall not remain!" and doubtless the
  primary object of getting into a saddle, is to stay there at our own
  convenience, so long as circumstances permit.</p>

  <p>[95-1] _J'y suis._</p>

  <p>But what a number of different attitudes do men adopt, in order to insure
  this permanent settlement. There is no position, from the tongs in the
  fender, to the tailor on his shop-board, into which the equestrian has not
  forced his unaccustomed limbs, to avoid involuntary separation from his
  beast. The dragoon of fifty years ago was drilled to ride with a straight
  leg, and his foot barely resting on the stirrup, whereas the oriental cavalry
  soldier, no mean proficient in the management of horse and weapon, tucks his
  knees up nearly to his chin, so that when he rises in the saddle, he towers
  above his little Arab as if he were standing rather than sitting on its back.
  The position, he argues, gives him a longer reach, and a stronger purchase
  for the use of sword and spear. If we are to judge by illuminated copies of
  Froissart, and other contemporary chronicles, it would seem that the
  armour-clad knight of the olden time, trusting in the depth and security of
  his saddle, _rode so long_ as to derive no assistance whatever from his
  stirrups, sitting down on his horse as much as possible, in dread, may be,
  lest the point of an adversary's lance should hoist him fairly out of his
  place over a cantle six inches high, and send him clanging to the ground, in
  mail and plate, surcoat, helmet and plumes, with his lady-love, squires,
  yeomen, the marshals of the lists, and all his feudal enemies looking on!</p>

  <p>Now the length of stirrup with which a man should ride, and in its
  adjustment consists much of the ease, grace, and security of his position,
  depends on the conformation of his lower limbs. If his thighs are long in
  proportion to his frame, flat and somewhat curved inwards, he will sit very
  comfortably at the exact length that raises him clear of his horse's withers,
  when he stands up in his stirrups with his feet home, and the majority of men
  thus limbed, on the majority of horses, will find this a good general rule.
  But when the legs are short and muscular, the thighs round and thick, the
  whole frame square and strong, more like wrestling than dancing, and many
  very superior riders are of this figure, the leathers must be pulled up a
  couple of holes, and the foot thrust a little more forward, to obtain the
  necessary security of seat, at a certain sacrifice of grace and even ease. To
  look as neat as one can is a compliment to society, to be safe and
  comfortable is a duty to oneself.</p>

  <p>Much also depends on the animal we bestride. Horses low in the withers,
  and strong behind the saddle, particularly if inclined to "catch hold" a
  little, require in all cases rather shorter stirrups than their easier and
  truer-shaped stable-companions, nay, the varying roundness of barrel at
  different stages of condition affects the attitude of a rider, and most of us
  must have remarked, as horse and master get finer drawn towards the spring,
  how we let out the stirrups in proportion as we take in waistbelt, and saddle
  girths. Men rode well nevertheless, witness the Elgin marbles, before the
  invention of this invaluable aid to horsemanship; and no equestrian can be
  considered perfect who is unable in a plunge or leap to stick on his horse
  bare-backed. Every boy should be taught to ride without stirrups, but not
  till he is tall and strong enough to grasp his pony firmly between his knees.
  A child of six or seven might injure itself in the effort, and ten, or
  eleven, is an early age enough for our young gentleman to be initiated into
  the subtleties of the art. My own idea is that he should begin without reins,
  so as to acquire a seat totally independent of his hands, and should never be
  trusted with a bridle till it is perfectly immaterial to him whether he has
  hold of it or not. Neither should it be restored, after his stirrups have
  been taken away, till he has again proved himself independent of its support.
  When he has learnt to canter round the school, and sit firm over a leaping
  bar, with his feet swinging loose, and his hands in his pockets, he will have
  become a better horseman than ninety-nine out of every hundred who go out
  hunting. Henceforward you may trust him to take care of himself, and _swim
  alone_.</p>

  <p>In every art it is well to begin from the very first with the best method;
  and I would instil into a pupil, even of the tenderest years, that although
  his legs, and especially his knees, are to be applied firmly to his pony's
  sides, as affording a security against tumbling off, it is _from the loins_
  that he must really ride, when all is said and done.</p>

  <p>I dare say most of us can remember the mechanical horse exhibited in
  Piccadilly some ten or twelve years ago, a German invention, remarkable for
  its ingenuity and the wonderful accuracy with which it imitated, in an
  exaggerated degree, the kicks, plunges, and other outrages practised by the
  most restive of the species to unseat their riders. Shaped in the truest
  symmetry, clad in a real horse's skin, with flowing mane and tail, this
  automaton represented the live animal in every particular, but for the pivot
  on which it turned, a shaft entering the belly below its girths, and
  communicating through the floor with the machinery that set in motion and
  regulated its astonishing vagaries. On mounting, the illusion was complete.
  Its very neck was so constructed with hinges that, on pulling at the bridle,
  it gave you its head without changing the direction of its body, exactly like
  an unbroken colt as yet intractable to the bit. At a word from the inventor,
  spoken in his own language to his assistants below, this artificial charger
  committed every kind of wickedness that could be devised by a fiend in equine
  shape. It reared straight on end; it lunged forward with its nose between its
  fore-feet, and its tail elevated to a perpendicular, awkward and ungainly as
  that of a swan _in reverse_. It lay down on its side; it rose to its legs
  with a bounce, and finally, if the rider's strength and dexterity enabled him
  still to remain in the saddle, it wheeled round and round with a velocity
  that could not fail at last to shoot him out of his seat on to the floor,
  humanely spread with mattresses, in anticipation of this inevitable
  catastrophe. It is needless to say how such an exhibition _drew_, with so
  horse-loving a public as our own. No gentleman who fancied he could "ride a
  bit" was satisfied till he had taken his shilling's worth and the mechanical
  horse had put him on his back. But for the mattresses, Piccadilly could have
  counted more broken collar-bones than ever did Leicestershire in the blindest
  and deepest of its Novembers. Rough-riders from the Life-Guards, Blues,
  Artillery, and half the cavalry regiments in the service, came to try
  conclusions with the spectre; and, like antagonists of some automaton
  chess-player, retired defeated and dismayed.</p>

  <p>For this universal failure, one could neither blame the men nor the
  military system taught in their schools. It stands to reason that human wind
  and muscle must sooner or later succumb to mechanical force. The inventor
  himself expressed surprise at the consummate horsemanship displayed by many
  of his fallen visitors, and admitted that more than one rough-rider would
  have tired out and subjugated any living creature of real flesh and blood;
  while the essayists universally declared the imitation so perfect, that at no
  period of the struggle could they believe they were contending with
  clock-work, rather than the natural efforts of some wild unbroken colt.</p>

  <p>But those who succeeded best, I remarked (and I speak with some little
  experience, having myself been indebted to the mattresses in my turn), were
  the horsemen who, allowing their loins to play freely, yielding more or less
  to every motion of the figure, did not trust exclusively for firmness of seat
  to the clasp of their knees and thighs. The mere balance rider had not a
  chance, the athlete who stuck on by main force found himself hurled into the
  air, with a violence proportioned to his own stubborn resistance; but the
  artist who judiciously combined strength with skill, giving a little _here_
  that he might get a stronger purchase _there_, swaying his body loosely to
  meet and accompany every motion, while he kept his legs pressed hard against
  the saddle, withstood trick after trick, and shock after shock creditably
  enough, till a hint muttered in German that it was time to displace him, put
  such mechanism in motion as settled the matter forthwith.</p>

  <p>There was one detail, however, to be observed in the equipment of the
  mechanical horse that brings us to a question I have heard discussed amongst
  the best riders with very decided opinions on either side.</p>

  <p>Formerly every saddle used to be made with padding about half an inch
  deep, sewn in the front rim of the flap against which a rider rests his knee,
  for the purpose, as it would seem, of affording him a stronger seat with its
  resistance and support.</p>

  <p>Thirty or forty years ago a few noted sportsmen, despising such
  adventitious aid, began to adopt the open, or plain-flapped saddle; and,
  although not universal, it has now come into general use. It would certainly,
  of the two, have been the better adapted to the automaton I have described,
  as an inequality of surface was sadly in the way when the figure in its
  downward perpendicular, brought the rider's foot parallel with the point of
  its shoulders. The man's calf then necessarily slipped over the padding of
  his saddle, and it was impossible for him to get his leg back to its right
  place in time for a fresh outbreak when the model rose again to its proper
  level.</p>

  <p>As I would prefer an open saddle for the artificial, so I do for the
  natural horse, and I will explain why.</p>

  <p>I take it as a general and elementary rule, there is no better position
  for a rider than that which brings shoulder, hip, knee, and heel into one
  perpendicular line. A man thus placed on his horse cannot but sit well down
  with a bend in his back, and in this attitude, the one into which he would
  naturally fall, if riding at full speed, he has not only security of seat,
  but great command over the animal he bestrides. He will find, nevertheless,
  in crossing a country, or otherwise practising feats of horsemanship
  requiring the exercise of strength, that to get his knee an inch or two in
  advance of the correct line will afford such leverage as it were for the rest
  of his body as gives considerable advantage in any unusual difficulty, such
  as a drop-leap, for instance, with which he may have to contend. Now in the
  plain-flapped saddle, he can bend his leg as much as he likes, and put it
  indeed where he will.</p>

  <p>This facility, too, is very useful in smuggling through a gap by a tree,
  often the most convenient egress, to make use of which, with a little skill
  and prudence, is a less hazardous experiment than it looks. A horse will take
  good care not to graze his own skin, and the space that admits of clearing
  his hips is wide enough for his rider's leg as well, if he hangs it over the
  animal's shoulder just where its neck is set on to the withers. But I would
  caution him to adopt this attitude carefully and above all, in good time. He
  should take his foot out of the stirrup and make his preparatory arrangements
  some three or four strides off at least, so as to accommodate his change of
  seat to the horse's canter before rising at the leap, and if he can spare his
  hand nearest the tree, so as to "fend it off" a little at the same time, he
  will be surprised to find how safely and pleasantly he accomplished a transit
  through some awkward and dangerous fence.</p>

  <p>But he must beware of delaying this little manoeuvre till the last moment,
  when his horse is about to spring. It is then too late, and he will either
  find himself so thrown out of his seat as to lose balance and grip too, or
  will try to save his leg by shifting it back instead of _forward_, when much
  confusion, bad language, and perhaps a broken knee-pan will be the
  result.</p>

  <p>Amongst other advantages of the open saddle we must not forget that it is
  cheaper by twenty shillings, and so sets off the shape of his forehand as to
  make a hunter look more valuable by twenty pounds.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it is still repudiated by some of our finest horsemen, who
  allege the sufficient reason that an inch or so of stuffing adds to their
  strength and security of seat. This, after all is, the _sine qua non_, to
  which every article of equipment, even the important items of boots and
  breeches, should be subservient, and I may here remark that ease and freedom
  of dress are indispensable to a man who wishes to ride across a country not
  only in comfort, but in safety. I am convinced that tight, ill-fitting
  leathers may have broken bones to answer for. Many a good fellow comes down
  to breakfast, stiff of gait, as if he were clothed in buckram, and can we
  wonder that he is hurt when thus hampered and constrained, he falls stark and
  rigid, like a paste-board policeman in a pantomime.</p>

  <p>I have already protested against the solecism of saving yourself by the
  bridle. It is better, if you _must_ have assistance, to follow the example of
  two or three notoriously fine riders and grasp the cantle of the saddle at
  the risk of breaking its tree. But in my humble opinion it is not well to be
  in the wrong even with Plato, and, notwithstanding these high authorities, we
  must consider such habits, however convenient on occasion, as errors in
  horsemanship. To a good rider the saddle ought to be a place of security as
  easy as an armchair.</p>

  <p>I have heard it asserted, usually by persons of lean and wiry frames, that
  with short legs and round thighs, it is impossible to acquire a firm seat on
  horseback; but in this, as in most matters of skill, I believe nature can be
  rendered obedient to education. Few men are so clumsily shaped but that they
  may learn to become strong and skilful riders if they will adopt a good
  system, and from the first resolve to sit _in the right place_; this, I
  think, should be in the very middle of the saddle, while bending the small of
  the back inwards, so that the weight of the body rests on that part of a
  horse's spine immediately behind his withers, under which his fore feet are
  placed, and on which, it has been ascertained, he can bear the heaviest load.
  When the animal stands perfectly still, or when it is extended at full speed,
  the most inexperienced horseman seems to fall naturally into the required
  position; but to preserve it, even through the regulated paces of the riding
  school demands constant effort and attention. The back-board is here, in my
  opinion, of great assistance to the beginner, as it forces him into an
  attitude that causes him to sit on the right part of his own person and his
  horse's back. It compels him also to carry his hands at a considerable
  distance off the horse's head, and thus entails also the desideratum of long
  reins.</p>

  <p>The shortest and surest way, however, of attaining a firm seat on
  horseback is, after all, to practise without stirrups on every available
  opportunity. Many a valuable lesson may be taken while riding to covert and
  nobody but the student be a bit the wiser. Thus to trot and canter along, for
  two or three miles on end is no bad training at the beginning of the season,
  and even an experienced horseman will be surprised to find how it gets him
  down in his saddle, and makes him feel as much at home there as he did in the
  previous March.</p>

  <p>The late Captain Percy Williams, as brilliant a rider over a country as
  ever cheered a hound, and to whom few professional jockeys would have cared
  to give five pounds on a race-course, assured me that he attributed to the
  above self-denying exercise that strength in the saddle which used to serve
  him so well from the distance home. When quartered at Hounslow with his
  regiment, the 9th Lancers, like other gay young light dragoons, he liked to
  spend all his available time in London. There were no railroads in those
  days, and the coaches did not always suit for time; but he owned a sound,
  speedy, high-trotting hack, and on this "bone setter" he travelled backwards
  and forwards twelve miles of the great Bath Road, with military regularity,
  half as many times a week. He made it a rule to cross the stirrups over his
  horse's shoulders the moment he was off the stones at either end, only to be
  replaced when he reached his destination. In three months' time, he told me,
  he had gained more practical knowledge of horsemanship, and more muscular
  power below the waist, than in all the hunting, larking, and riding-school
  drill of the previous three years.</p>

  <p>Grace is, after all, but the result of repressed strength. The loose and
  easy seat that seems to sway so carelessly with every motion, can tighten
  itself by instinct to the compression of a vice, and the "prettiest rider,"
  as they say in Ireland, is probably the one whom a kicker or buck-jumper
  would find the most difficult to dislodge. No doubt in the field, the ride,
  the parade, or the polo-ground a strong seat is the first of those many
  qualities that constitute good horsemanship. The real adept is not to be
  unseated by any catastrophe less conclusive than complete downfall of man and
  beast; nay, even then he parts company without confusion, and it may be said
  of him as of "William of Deloraine," good at need in a like
  predicament&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Still sate the warrior, saddle fast,<br>
  Till, stumbling in the mortal shock,<br>
  Down went the steed, the girthing broke,<br>
  Hurled in a heap lay man and horse."</p>

  <p>But I have a strong idea Sir William did not let his bridle go even
  then.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; VALOUR.</h2>

  <p class="first">"He that would venture nothing must not get on horseback,"
  says a Spanish proverb, and the same caution seems applicable to most manly
  amusements or pursuits. We cannot enter a boat, put on a pair of skates, take
  a gun in hand for covert shooting, or even run downstairs in a hurry without
  encountering risk; but the amount of peril to which a horseman subjects
  himself seems proportioned inversely to the unconsciousness of it he
  displays.</p>

  <p>"Where there is no fear there is no danger," though a somewhat reckless
  aphorism, is more applicable, I think, to the exercise of riding than to any
  other venture of neck and limbs. The horse is an animal of exceedingly
  nervous temperament, sympathetic too, in the highest degree, with the hand
  from which he takes his instructions. Its slightest vacillation affects him
  with electric rapidity, but from its steadiness he derives moral
  encouragement rather than physical support, and on those rare occasions when
  his own is insufficient, he seems to borrow daring and resolution from his
  rider.</p>

  <p>If the man's heart is in the right place, his horse will seldom fail him;
  and were we asked to name the one essential without which it is impossible to
  attain thorough proficiency in the saddle, we should not hesitate to say
  nerve.</p>

  <p>_Nerve_, I repeat, in contradistinction to _pluck_. The latter takes us
  into a difficulty, the former brings us out of it. Both are comprised in the
  noble quality we call emphatically valour, but while the one is a brilliant
  and imposing costume, so is the other an honest wear-and-tear fabric, equally
  fit for all weathers, fine and foul.</p>

  <p>"You shiver, Colonel&mdash;you are afraid," said an insubordinate Major,
  who ought to have been put under arrest then and there, to his commanding
  officer on the field of Prestonpans. "I _am_ afraid, sir," answered the
  Colonel; "and if you were as much afraid as I am, _you would run away_!"</p>

  <p>I have often thought this improbable anecdote exemplifies very clearly
  that most meritorious of all courage which asserts the dominion of our will
  over our senses. The Colonel's answer proves he was full of valour. He had
  lots of pluck, but as he was bold enough to admit, a deficiency of nerve.</p>

  <p>Now the field of Diana happily requires but a slight per-centage of daring
  and resolution compared with the field of Mars. I heard the late Sir Francis
  Head, distinguished as a soldier, a statesman, an author, and a sportsman,
  put the matter in a few words, very tersely&mdash;and exceedingly to the
  point. "Under fire," said he, "there is a guinea's-worth of danger, but it
  comes to you. In the hunting-field, there is only three-ha'p 'orth, but _you
  go to it_!" In both cases, the courage required is a mere question of degree,
  and as in war, so in the chase, he is most likely to distinguish himself
  whose daring, not to be dismayed, is tempered with coolness, whose heart is
  always stout and hopeful, while he never loses his head.</p>

  <p>Now as I understand the terms pluck and nerve, I conceive the first to be
  a moral quality, the result of education, sentiment, self-respect, and
  certain high aspirations of the intellect; the second, a gift of nature
  dependent on the health, the circulation, and the liver. As memory to
  imagination in the student, so is nerve to pluck in the horseman. Not the
  more brilliant quality, nor the more captivating, but sound, lasting,
  available for all emergencies, and sure to conquer in the long run.</p>

  <p>We will suppose two sportsmen are crossing a country equally well mounted,
  and each full of valour to the brim. A, to quote his admiring friends, "has
  the pluck of the devil!" B, to use a favourite expression of the saddle-room,
  "has a good nerve." Both are bound to come to grief over some forbidding
  rails at a corner, the only way out, in the line hounds are running, and
  neither has any more idea of declining than had poor Lord Strathmore on a
  similar occasion when Jem Mason halloaed to him, "Eternal misery on this side
  my lord, and certain death on the other!" So they harden their hearts, sit
  down in their saddles, and this is what happens:&mdash;</p>

  <p>A's horse, injudiciously sent at the obstacle, _because_ it is awkward, a
  turn too fast, slips in taking off, and strikes the top-rail, which neither
  bends nor breaks, just below its knees. A flurried snatch at the bridle pulls
  its head in the air, and throws the animal skilfully to the ground at the
  moment it most requires perfect freedom for a desperate effort to keep on its
  legs. Rider and horse roll over in an "imperial crowner," and rise to their
  feet looking wildly about them, totally disconnected, and five or six yards
  apart.</p>

  <p>This is not encouraging for B, who is obliged to follow, inasmuch as the
  place only offers room for one at a time, but as soon as his leader is out of
  the way, he comes steadily and quietly at the leap. His horse too, slips in
  the tracks of its fallen comrade, but as it is going in a more collected
  form, it contrives to get its fore-legs over the impediment, which catches
  it, however, inside the hocks, so that, balancing for a moment, it comes
  heavily on its nose. During these evolutions, B sits motionless in the
  saddle, giving the animal complete liberty of rein. An instinct of
  self-preservation and a good pair of shoulders turn the scale at the last
  moment, and although there is no denying they "had a squeak for it" in the
  scramble, B and his horse come off without a fall.</p>

  <p>Now it was pluck that took both these riders into the difficulty, but
  nerve that extricated one of them without defeat.</p>

  <p>I am not old enough to have seen the famous Mr. Assheton Smith in the
  hunting-field, but many of my early Leicestershire friends could remember him
  perfectly at his best, when he hunted that fine and formidable country, with
  the avowed determination, daily carried out, _of going into every field with
  his hounds_!</p>

  <p>The expenditure of valour, for it really deserves the name necessary to
  carry out such a style of riding can only be appreciated by those who have
  tried to keep in a good place during thirty or forty minutes, over any part
  of the Quorn and Cottesmore counties lying within six miles of Billesdon.
  Where should we be but for the gates? I think I may answer, neither there nor
  thereabouts! I have reason to believe the many stories told of "Tom Smith's"
  skill and daring are little, if at all, exaggerated. He seems admitted by all
  to have been the boldest, as he was one of the best, horsemen that ever got
  into a saddle with a hunting-whip in his hand.</p>

  <p>Though subsequently a man of enormous wealth, in the prime of life, he
  lived on the allowance, adequate but not extravagant, made him by his father,
  and did by no means give those high prices for horses, which, on the
  principle that "money makes the mare to go," are believed by many sportsmen
  to ensure a place in the front rank. He entertained no fancies as to size,
  action, above all, peculiarities in mouths and tempers. Little or big, sulky,
  violent, or restive, if a horse could gallop and jump, he was a hunter the
  moment he found himself between the legs of Tom Smith.</p>

  <p>There is a namesake of his hunting at present from Melton, who seems to
  have taken several leaves out of his book. Captain Arthur Smith, with every
  advantage of weight, nerve, skill, seat, and hand, is never away from the
  hounds. Moreover, he always likes his horse, and his horse always seems to
  like him. This gentleman, too, is blessed with an imperturbable temper, which
  I have been given to understand the squire of Tedworth was _not_.</p>

  <p>Instances of Tom Smith's daring are endless. How characteristic was his
  request to a farmer near Glengorse, that he would construct such a fence as
  should effectually prevent the field from getting away in too close proximity
  to his hounds. "I can make you up a stopper," said the good-natured yeoman,
  "and welcome; but what be you to do yourself, Squire, for I know you like
  well to be with 'em when they run?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind me," was the answer, "you do what I ask you. I never saw a
  fence in this country I couldn't get over _with a fall_!" and, sure enough,
  the first day the hounds found a fox in that well-known covert, Tom Smith was
  seen striding along in the wake of his darlings, having tumbled neck-and-crop
  over the obstacle he had demanded, in perfect good humour and content.</p>

  <p>If valour then, is a combination of pluck and nerve, he may be called the
  most valorous sportsman that ever got upon a horse, while affording another
  example of the partiality with which fortune favours the bold, for although
  he has had between eighty and ninety falls in a season, he was never really
  hurt, I believe, but once in his life.</p>

  <p>"That is a _brave_ man!" I have heard Lord Gardner say in good-humoured
  derision, pointing to some adventurous sportsman, whose daring so far
  exceeded his dexterity as to bring horse and rider into trouble; but his
  lordship's own nerve was so undeniable, that like many others, he may have
  undervalued a quality of which he could not comprehend the want.</p>

  <p>Most hunting-men, I fancy, will agree with me, that of all obstacles we
  meet with in crossing a country, timber draws most largely on the reserve
  fund of courage hoarded away in that part of a hero's heart which is nearest
  his mouth. The highest rails I ever saw attempted were ridden at by Lord
  Gardner some years ago, while out with Mr. Tailby's hounds near the Ram's
  Head. With a fair holding scent, and the pack bustling their fox along over
  the grass, there was no time for measurement, but I remember perfectly well
  that being in the same field, some fifty yards behind him, and casting
  longing looks at the fence, totally impracticable in every part, I felt
  satisfied the corner he made for was simply an impossibility.</p>

  <p>"We had better turn round and go home!" I muttered in my despair.</p>

  <p>The leap consisted of four strong rails, higher than a horse's withers, an
  approach down hill, a take-off poached by cattle, and a landing into a deep
  muddy lane. I can recall at this moment, the beautiful style in which my
  leader brought his horse to its effort. Very strong in the saddle, with the
  finest hands in the world, leaning far back, and sitting well down, he seemed
  to rouse as it were, and concentrate the energies of the animal for its last
  half-stride, when, rearing itself almost perpendicularly, it contrived to get
  safe over, only breaking the top rail with a hind leg.</p>

  <p>This must have lowered the leap by at least a foot, yet when I came to it,
  thus reduced, and "made easy," it was still a formidable obstacle, and I felt
  thankful to be on a good jumper.</p>

  <p>Of late years I have seen Mr. Powell, who is usually very well mounted,
  ride over exceedingly high and forbidding timber so persistently, as to have
  earned from that material, the _nom de chasse_ by which he is known amongst
  his friends.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the late Lord Cardigan, the last of the Brudenells, afforded
  in the hunting-field, as in all other scenes of life, the most striking
  example of that "pluck" which is totally independent of youth, health,
  strength, or any other physical advantage. The courage that in advanced
  middle-age governed the steady manoeuvres of Bulganak, and led the death-ride
  at Balaclava, burned bright and fierce to the end. The graceful seat might be
  less firm, the tall soldier-like figure less upright, but Mars, one of his
  last and best hunters, was urged to charge wood and water by the same bold
  heart at seventy, that tumbled Langar into the Uppingham road over the
  highest gate in Leicestershire at twenty-six. The foundation of Lord
  Cardigan's whole character was valour. He loved it, he prized it, he admired
  it in others, he was conscious and proud of it in himself.</p>

  <p>So jealous was he of this chivalrous quality, that even in such a matter
  of mere amusement as riding across a country, he seemed to attach some vague
  sense of disgrace to the avoidance of a leap, however dangerous, if hounds
  were running at the time, and was notorious for the recklessness with which
  he would plunge into the deepest rivers though he could not swim a
  stroke!</p>

  <p>This I think is to court _real_ danger for no sufficient object.</p>

  <p>Lord Wolverton, than whom no man has ridden straighter and more
  enthusiastically to hounds, ever since he left Oxford, once crossed the
  Thames in this most perilous fashion, for he, too, has never learnt to swim,
  during a run with "the Queen's." "But," said I, protesting subsequently
  against such hardihood, "you were risking your life at every stroke."</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that," was the answer, "till I got safe over, and it
  was no use bothering about it then."</p>

  <p>Lord Cardigan however, seemed well aware of his danger, and, in my own
  recollection, had two very narrow escapes from drowning in these uncalled-for
  exploits.</p>

  <p>The gallant old cavalry officer's death was in keeping with his whole
  career. At threescore years and ten he insisted on mounting a dangerous
  animal that he would not have permitted any friend to ride. What happened is
  still a mystery. The horse came home without him, and he never spoke again,
  though he lived till the following day.</p>

  <p>But these are sad reflections for so cheerful a subject as daring in the
  saddle. Red is our colour, not black, and, happily, in the sport we love,
  there are few casualties calling forth more valour than is required to
  sustain a bloody nose, a broken collar-bone, or a sound ducking in a wet
  ditch. Yet it is extraordinary how many good fellows riding good horses find
  themselves defeated in a gallop after hounds, from indecision and
  uncertainty, rather than want of courage, when the emergency actually arises.
  Though the danger, according to Sir Francis Head, is about a hap'orth, it
  might possibly be valued at a penny, and nobody wants to discover, in his own
  person, the exact amount. Therefore are the chivalry of the Midland Counties
  to be seen on occasion panic-stricken at the downfall or disappearance of a
  leader. And a dozen feet of dirty water will wholly scatter a field of
  horsemen who would confront an enemy's fire without the quiver of an
  eye-lash. Except timber, of which the risk is obvious, at a glance, nothing
  frightens the _half_-hard, so much as a brook. It is difficult, you see, to
  please them, the uncertainty of the limpid impediment being little less
  forbidding than the certainty of the stiff!</p>

  <p>But it does require dash and coolness, pluck and nerve, a certain spice of
  something that may fairly be called valour, to charge cheerfully at a brook
  when we have no means of ascertaining its width, its depth, or the soundness
  of its banks. Horses too are apt to share the misgivings of their riders, and
  water-jumping, like a loan to a poor relation, if not done freely, had better
  not be done at all.</p>

  <p>The fox, and consequently the hounds, as we know, will usually cross at
  the narrowest place, but even if we can mark the exact spot, fences, or the
  nature of the ground may prevent our getting there. What are we to do? If we
  follow a leader, and he drops short, we are irretrievably defeated, if we
  make our own selection, the gulf may be as wide as the Thames. "Send him at
  it!" says valour, "and take your chance!" Perhaps it is the best plan after
  all. There is something in luck, a good deal in the reach of a horse's stride
  at a gallop, and if we _do_ get over, we _rather_ flatter ourselves for the
  next mile or two that we have "done the trick!"</p>

  <p>To enter on the subject of "hard riding," as it is called, without
  honourable mention of the habit and the side-saddle, would in these days
  betray both want of observation and politeness; but ladies, though they seem
  to court danger no less freely than admiration, possess, I think, as a
  general rule, more pluck than nerve. I can recall an instance very lately,
  however, in which I saw displayed by one of the gentlest of her sex, an
  amount of courage, coolness, and self-possession, that would have done credit
  to a hero. This lady, who had not quite succeeded in clearing a high
  post-and-rail with a boggy ditch on the landing side, was down and under her
  horse. The animal's whole weight rested on her legs, so as to keep her in
  such a position, that her head lay between its fore and hind feet, where the
  least attempt at a struggle, hemmed in by those four shining shoes, must have
  dashed her brains out. She seemed in no way concerned for her beauty, or her
  life, but gave judicious directions to those who rescued her as calmly and
  courteously as if she had been pouring out their tea.</p>

  <p>The horse, though in that there is nothing unusual, behaved like an angel,
  and the fair rider was extricated without very serious injury; but I thought
  to myself, as I remounted and rode on, that if a legion of Amazons could be
  rendered amenable to discipline they would conquer the world.</p>

  <p>No man, till he has tried the experiment, can conceive how awkward and
  powerless one feels in a lady's seat. They themselves affirm that with the
  crutch, or second pommel on the near side, they are more secure than
  ourselves; but when I see those delicate, fragile forms flying over wood and
  water, poised on precipitous banks, above all, crashing through strong
  bullfinches, I am struck with admiration at the mysteries of nature, among
  which not the least wonderful seems the feminine desire to excel. And they
  _do_ excel when resolved they will, even in those sports and exercises which
  seem more naturally belonging to the masculine department. It was but the
  other day, a boatman in the Channel told me he saw a lady swimming alone more
  than half a mile off shore. Now that the universal rink has brought skating
  into fashion, the "many-twinkling feet," that smoothest glide and turn most
  deftly, are shod with such dainty boots as never could be worn by the
  clumsier sex. At lawn-tennis the winning service is offered by some seductive
  hoyden in her teens; and, although in the game of cricket the Graces have as
  yet been males, at no distant day we may expect to see the best batsman at
  the Oval bowled out, or perhaps caught by a woman!</p>

  <p>Yes, the race is in the ascendant. It takes the heaviest fish,&mdash;I
  mean _real_ fish&mdash;with a rod and line. It kills its grouse right and
  left&mdash;in the moor among the heather. It shoulders a rifle no heavier
  than a pea-shooter, but levels the toy so straight that, after some cunning
  stalk, a "stag of ten" goes down before the white hand and taper finger, as
  becomes his antlers and his sex. Lastly, when it gets upon Bachelor, or
  Benedict, or Othello, or any other high-flyer with a suggestive name, it
  sails away close, often too close, to the hounds, leaving brothers, husbands,
  even admirers hopelessly in the rear.</p>

  <p>Now, I hope I am not going to express a sentiment that will offend their
  prejudices, and cause young women to call me an old one, but I do consider
  that, in these days, ladies who go out hunting _ride a turn too hard_. Far be
  it from me to assert that the Field is no place for the fair; on the
  contrary, I hold that their presence adds in every respect to its charms.
  Neither would I protest against their jumping, and relegate them to the
  bridle-roads or lanes. Nothing of the kind. Let the greatest care be taken in
  the selection of their horses; let their saddles and bridles be fitted to
  such a nicety that sore backs and sore mouths are equally impossible, and let
  trustworthy servants be told off to attend them during the day. Then, with
  everything in their favour, over a fair country, fairly fenced, why should
  they not ride on and take their pleasure?</p>

  <p>But even if their souls disdain to follow a regular pilot (and I may
  observe his office requires no little nerve, as they are pretty quick on to a
  leader if he gets down), I would entreat them not to try "cutting out the
  work," as it is called, but rather to wait and see one rider, at least, over
  a leap before they attempt it themselves. It is frightful to think of a woman
  landing in a pit, a water-course, or even so deep a ditch as may cause the
  horse to roll over her when he falls. With her less muscular frame she is
  more easily injured than a man; with her finer organisation she cannot
  sustain injury as well. It turns one sick to think of her dainty head between
  a horse's hind-legs, or of those cruel pommels bruising her delicate ribs and
  bosom. It is at least twenty to one in _our_ favour every time we fall,
  whereas with her the odds are all the other way, and it is almost twenty to
  one she must be hurt.</p>

  <p>What said the wisest of kings concerning a fair woman without discretion?
  We want no Solomon to remind us that with her courage roused, her ambition
  excited, all the rivalry of her nature called into play, she has nowhere more
  need of this judicious quality than in the hunting-field.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; DISCRETION.</h2>

  <p class="first">It has been called the better part of valour, and doubtless,
  when wanting, the latter is as likely to sustain irretrievable reverses as a
  ship without a rudder, or a horse without a bridle. The two should always
  travel together; but it appears to me that we meet the cautious brother most
  frequently on our journey through life.</p>

  <p>In the chase, however, they seem to share their presence impartially
  enough. Valour is very much to the front at the covert side, and shows again
  with great certainty after dinner; but discretion becomes paramount and
  almost ubiquitous when the hounds run, being called on indeed to act for us
  in every field. Sometimes, particularly when countries are blind early in
  November, we abandon ourselves so entirely to its guidance as little by
  little to lose all our self-reliance, till at last we feel comfortable
  nowhere but in the high road; and most of us, I dare say, can recall
  occasions on which we have been so utterly discomfited by an early
  disappointment (in plain English a fence we were afraid to jump) as to give
  in without an effort, although the slightest dash of valour at the right
  moment would have carried us triumphantly out of defeat.</p>

  <p>Never mind. Like a French friend of mine, who expresses his disinclination
  to our _chasse au renard_ by protesting, "_Monsieur, je ne cherche pas mes
  &eacute;motions &agrave; me casser le cou_," when we are avowedly in pursuit
of pleasure we
  ought to take it exactly as suits us best. There are two ends of the string
  in every run with hounds. Wisdom pervades each of these, but eschews the
  various gradations between. In front rides valour with discretion; in rear,
  discretion without valour; and in the middle a tumultuous throng, amongst
  whom neither quality is to be recognised. With too little of the one to fly,
  not enough of the other to creep, they waver at the fences, hurry at the
  gaps, get in each other's way at the gates, and altogether make exceedingly
  slow progress compared to their efforts and their excitement.</p>

  <p>Valour without discretion, I had almost forgotten to observe, was down and
  under his horse at the first difficulty.</p>

  <p>We will let the apex of the pyramid alone for the present, taking the
  safest and broadest end of the hunt first.</p>

  <p>If, then, you have achieved so bad a start that it is impossible to make
  up your lee-way, or if you are on a hack with neither power nor intention to
  ride in the front rank, be sure you cannot take matters too coolly should you
  wish to command the line of chase and see as much as possible of the fun.</p>

  <p>I am supposing the hounds have found a good fox that knows more than one
  parish, and are running him with a holding scent. However favourable your
  start, and fate is sure to arrange a good one for a man too badly mounted to
  avail himself of it, let nothing induce you to keep near the pack. At a mile
  off you can survey and anticipate their general direction, at a quarter that
  distance you must ride every turn. Do not be disordered by the brilliancy of
  the pace should their fox go straight up wind. If he does not sink it within
  five minutes he means reaching a drain, and another five will bring the
  "who-whoop!" that marks him to ground. This is an unfailing deduction, but
  happily the most discreet of us are apt to forget it. Time after time we are
  so fooled by the excitement of our gallop that even experience does not make
  us wise, and we enjoy the scurry, exclaiming, "What a pity!" when it is over,
  as if we had never been out hunting before. It would be useless to distress
  your hack for so short a spin, rather keep wide of the line, if possible, on
  high ground, and calculate by the wind, the coverts, and the general aspect
  of the country, where a fox is most likely to make his point.</p>

  <p>I have known good runs in the Shires seen fairly, from end to end, by a
  lady in a wagonette.</p>

  <p>When business really begins, men are apt to express in various ways their
  intention of taking part. Some use their eyes, some their heels, and some
  their flasks. Do you trust your brains, they will stand you in better stead
  than spurs, or spectacles, or even brandy diluted with cura&ccedil;oa. Keep
your
  attention fixed on the chase, watch the pack as long as you can, and when
  those white specks have vanished into space, depend on your own skill in
  woodcraft and knowledge of country to bring you up with them again. Above
  all, while they are actually in motion, distrust the bobbing hats and spots
  of scarlet that you mark in a distant cluster behind the hedge. What are they
  but the field? and the field, if it is _really_ a run, are pretty sure to be
  _out of it_.</p>

  <p>The first flight you will find very difficult to keep in view. At the most
  it consists of six or seven horsemen riding fifty or a hundred yards apart,
  and even its followers become so scattered and detached that in anything like
  an undulating country they are completely hidden from observation. If you
  _do_ catch a glimpse of them, how slow they seem to travel! and yet, when you
  nick in presently, heaving flanks, red faces, and excited voices will tell a
  very different tale.</p>

  <p>Trotting soberly along, then, with ears and eyes wide open, carefully
  keeping down wind, not only because the hounds are sure to bend in that
  direction, but also that you can thus hear before you see them, and take
  measures accordingly, you will have ridden very few miles before you are
  gladdened by the cheerful music of the pack, or more probably a twang from
  the horn. The scent is rarely so good as to admit of hounds running for
  thirty or forty minutes without a check; indeed, on most days they are likely
  to be at fault more than once during the lapse of half an hour, when the
  huntsman's science will be required to cast them, and, in some cases, to
  assist them in losing their fox. Now is your time to press on with the still
  undefeated hack. If you are wise you will not leave the lanes to which I give
  you the credit of having stuck religiously from the start. At least, do not
  think of entering a field unless the track of an obvious bridle-road leads
  safely into the next.</p>

  <p>A man who never jumps at all can by no possibility be "pounded," whereas
  the easiest and safest of gaps into an inclosure may mean a bullfinch with
  two ditches at the other end.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you will find yourself ahead of every one as the hounds spread,
  and stoop and dash forward with a whimper that makes the sweetest of music in
  your ears. Perhaps, as they swarm across the very lane in which you are
  standing, discretion may calmly open the gate for valour, who curses him in
  his heart, wondering what business he has to be there at all.</p>

  <p>There is jealousy even in the hunting-field, though we prefer to call it
  keenness, emulation, a fancy for riding our own line, and I fear that with
  most of us, in spite of the kindly sympathies and joyous expansion of the
  chase, "_ego et praeterea nihil_" is the unit about which our aspirations
  chiefly revolve.</p>

  <p>"What is the use?" I once heard a plaintive voice lamenting behind a
  blackthorn, while the hounds were baying over a drain at the finish of a
  clipping thirty minutes on the grass. "I've spoilt my hat, I've torn my coat,
  I've lamed my horse, I've had two falls, I went first, I'll take my oath,
  from end to end, and there's that d&mdash;d fellow on the coffee-coloured
  pony gets here before me after all!"</p>

  <p>There are times, no doubt, when valour must needs yield the palm to
  discretion.</p>

  <p>Let us see how this last respectable quality serves us at the other and
  nobler extremity of the hunt, for it is there, after all, that our ambition
  points, and our wishes chiefly tend.</p>

  <p>"Are you a hard rider?" asked an inquiring lady of Mr. Jorrocks.</p>

  <p>"The hardest in England," answered that facetious worthy, adding to
  himself, "I may say that, for I never goes off the 'ard road if I can help
  it."</p>

  <p>Now instead of following so cautious an example, let us rather cast
  overboard a superfluity of discretion, that would debar us the post of honour
  we are fain to occupy, retaining only such a leavening of its virtue as will
  steer us safely between the two extremes. While the hounds are racing before
  us, with a good scent, in an open country, let our gallant hunter be freely
  urged by valour to the front, while at the same time, discretion holds him
  hard by the head, lest a too inconsiderate daring should endanger his rider's
  neck.</p>

  <p>If a man has the luck to be on a good timber-jumper, now is the time to
  take advantage freely of its confidential resources. If not pulled about, and
  interfered with, a hunter that understands his business leaps this kind of
  fence, so long as he is fresh, with ease to himself and security to his
  rider. He sees exactly what he has to do, and need not rise an inch higher,
  nor fling himself an inch farther than is absolutely necessary, whereas a
  hedge induces him to make such exertions as may cover the uncertainty it
  conceals. But, on the other hand, the binder will usually bear tampering
  with, which the bar will _not_, therefore _if_ your own courage and your
  horse's skill tempt you to negotiate rails, stiles, or even a gate&mdash;and
  this last is _very_ good form&mdash;sound discretion warns you to select the
  first ten or fifteen minutes of a run for such exhibitions, but to avoid them
  religiously, when the deep ground and the pace have begun to tell.</p>

  <p>Assheton Smith himself, though he scouted the idea of ever turning from
  anything, had in so far the instinct of self-preservation, that when he
  thought his horse likely to fall over such an obstacle, he put him at it
  somewhat _a-slant_, so that the animal should get at least one fore-leg
  clear, and tumble on to its side, when this accomplished rider was pretty
  sure to rise unhurt with the reins in his hand.</p>

  <p>Now this diagonal style of jumping, judiciously practised, is not without
  its advantages at less dangerous fences than the uncompromising bit of timber
  that turns us over. It necessarily increases the width of a bank, affording
  the horse more room for foothold, as it decreases the height and strength of
  the growers, by taking them the way they lie, and may, on occasion, save a
  good hunter from a broken back, the penalty for dropping both hind legs
  simultaneously and perpendicularly into some steep cut ditch he has failed to
  cover in his stride.</p>

  <p>Discretion, you observe, should accompany the hardest riders, and is not
  to be laid aside even in the confusion and excitement of a fall.</p>

  <p>This must prove a frequent casualty with every man, however well-mounted,
  if the hounds show sport and he means to be with them while they run. It
  seems a paradox, but the oftener you are down, the less likely you are to be
  hurt. Practice soon teaches you to preserve presence of mind, or, as I may be
  allowed to call it, discretion, and when you know exactly where your horse
  is, you can get away from him before he crushes you with the weight of his
  body. A foot or a hand thrust out at the happy moment, is enough to "fend you
  off," and your own person seldom comes to the ground with such force as to do
  you any harm, if there is plenty of dirt. In the absence of that essential to
  sport, hunters are not distressed, and therefore do not often fall.</p>

  <p>If, however, you have undertaken to temper the rashness of a young one
  with your own discretion, you must expect occasional reverses; but even thus,
  there are many chances in your favour, not the least of which is your pupil's
  elasticity. Lithe and agile, he will make such gallant efforts to save
  himself as usually obviate the worst consequences of his mistake. The
  worn-out, the under-bred, or the distressed horse comes down like a lump of
  lead, and neither valour nor discretion are much help to us then.</p>

  <p>From the pace at which hounds cross a country, there is unfortunately no
  time to practise that most discreet manoeuvre called "leading over," when the
  fence is of so formidable a nature as to threaten certain discomfiture, yet I
  have seen a few tall, powerful, active men, spring off and on their horses
  with such rapidity as to perform this feat successfully in all the hurry of a
  burst. The late Colonel Wyndham, who, when he commanded the Greys, in which
  regiment he served at Waterloo, was said by George the Fourth to be the
  handsomest man in the army, possessed with a giant's stature the pliant
  agility of a harlequin. A finer rider never got into a saddle. Weighing
  nineteen stone, I have seen him in a burst across Leicestershire, go for
  twenty minutes with the best of the light-weights, occasionally relieving his
  horse by throwing himself off, leaping a fence alongside of it, and vaulting
  on again, without checking the animal sufficiently to break its stride.</p>

  <p>The lamented Lord Mayo too, whose tall stalwart frame was in keeping with
  those intellectual powers that India still recalls in melancholy pride, was
  accustomed, on occasion, thus to surmount an obstacle, no less successfully
  among the bullfinches of Northamptonshire than the banks and ditches of
  Kildare. Perhaps the best rider of his family, and it is a bold assertion,
  for when five or six of the brothers are out hunting, there will always be
  that number of tall heavy men, answering to the name of Bourke in the same
  field with the hounds, Lord Mayo, or rather Lord Naas (for the best of his
  sporting career closed with his succession to the earldom), was no less
  distinguished for his daring horsemanship, than his tact in managing a
  country, and his skill in hunting a pack of hounds. That he showed less
  forethought in risking a valuable life than in conducting the government of
  an empire, we must attribute to his personal courage and keen delight in the
  chase, but that he humorously deplored the scarcity of discretion amongst its
  votaries, the following anecdote, as I had it from himself, sufficiently
  attests.</p>

  <p>While he hunted his own hounds in Kildare, his most constant attendant,
  though on foot, was a nondescript character, such as is called "a tight boy"
  in Ireland, and nowhere else, belonging to a class that never seem to do a
  day's work, nor to eat a plentiful meal, but are always pleasant, obliging,
  idle, hungry, thirsty, and supremely happy. Running ten miles on foot to
  covert, Mick, as he was called, would never leave the hounds till they
  reached their kennels at night. Thus, plodding home one evening by his
  lordship's horse, after an unusually long and fatiguing run, the rider could
  not help expostulating with the walker on such a perverse misapplication of
  strength, energy, and perseverance. "Why, look at the work you have been
  doing," said his lordship; "with a quarter of the labour you might have
  earned three or four shillings at least. What a fool you must be, Mick, to
  neglect your business, and lose half your potatoes, that you may come out
  with my hounds!"</p>

  <p>Mick reflected a moment, and looked up, "Ah! me lard," replied he, with
  such a glance of fun as twinkles nowhere but in the Irish blue of an Irish
  eye, "it's truth your lardship's spakin' this night; _'av there was no fools,
  there'd be sorra few fox-hunters!_"</p>

  <p>Let us return to the question of Discretion, and how we are to combine it
  with an amusement that makes fools of us all.</p>

  <p>While valour, then, bids us take our fences as they come, discretion
  teaches us that each should be accomplished in the manner most suitable to
  its peculiar requirements. When a bank offers foothold, and we see the
  possibility of dividing a large leap by two, we should pull back to a trot,
  and give our horse a hint that he will do well to spring on and off the
  obstacle in accordance with a motion of our hand. If, on the contrary, his
  effort must be made at a black and forbidding bullfinch, with the chance of a
  wide ditch, or even a tough ashen rail, beyond, it is wise, should we mean
  having it at all, to catch hold of the bridle and increase our pace, for the
  last two or three strides, with such energy as shall shoot us through the
  thorns like a harlequin through a trap-door, leaving the orifice to close up
  behind, with no more traces of our transit than are left by a bird!</p>

  </div>

  <p>Perhaps we find an easy place under a tree, with an overhanging branch,
  and sidle daintily up to it, bending the body and lowering the head as we
  creep through, to the admiration of an indiscreet friend on a rash horse who
  spoils a good hat and utters an evil execration while trying to follow our
  example. Or it may be, rejoicing to find ourselves on arable land, that
  actually rides light, and yet carries a scent,</p>

  <p class="verse">"Solid and tall, The rasping wall"</p>

  <p class="first">challenges us a quarter of a mile off to face it or go home,
  for it offers neither gate nor gap, and seems to meet the sky-line on either
  side. I do not know whether others are open to the same deception, but to my
  own eye, a wall appears more, and a hedge less, than its real height at a
  certain distance off. The former, however, is a most satisfactory leap when
  skilfully accomplished, and not half so arduous as it looks.</p>

  <p>"Have it!" says Valour. "Yes, but very slow," replies Discretion. And,
  sure enough, we calm the free generous horse into a trot, causing him to put
  his very nose over the obstacle before taking off; when bucking into the air,
  like a deer, he leaves it behind him with little more effort than a girl puts
  to her skipping-rope. The height an experienced wall-jumper will clear seems
  scarcely credible. A fence of this description, which measurement proves to
  be fully six feet, was jumped by the well-known Colonel Miles three or four
  years ago in the Badminton country without displacing a stone, and although
  the rider's consummate horsemanship afforded every chance of success, great
  credit is due to the good hunter that could make such an effort with so heavy
  a man on its back.</p>

  <p>The knack of wall-jumping, however, is soon learned even by the most
  inexperienced animals, and I may here observe that I have often been
  surprised at the discretion shown by young horses, when ridden close to
  hounds, in negotiating fences requiring sagacity and common sense. I am aware
  that my opinion is singular, and I only give it as the result, perhaps
  exceptional, of my own limited experience; but I must admit that I have been
  carried by a pupil, on his first day, over awkward places, up and down banks,
  in and out of ravines, or under trees, with a docility and circumspection I
  have looked for from the veterans in vain. Perhaps the old horse knows me as
  well as I know him, and thinks also that he knows best. I am bound to say he
  never fails me when I trust him, but he likes his head let alone, and insists
  on having it all his own way. When his blood is really up, and the hero of a
  hundred fights considers it worth while to put forth his strength, I am
  persuaded he is even bolder than his junior.</p>

  <p>Not only at the fences, however, do we require discretion. There is a
  right way and a wrong of traversing every acre of ground that lies between
  them. On the grass, we must avoid crossing high ridge-and-furrow in a direct
  line; rather let us take it obliquely, or, if the field be not too large, go
  all the way round by the headland. For an unaccustomed horse there is nothing
  so trying as those up-and-down efforts, that resemble the lurches of a boat
  in a heavy sea. A very true-shaped animal will learn to glide smoothly over
  them after a season or two, but these inequalities of surface must always be
  a tax on wind and muscular powers at best. The easiest goer in
  ridge-and-furrow that we have yet seen is a fox. Surely no other quadruped
  has nature gifted with so much strength and symmetry in so small a
  compass.</p>

  <p>Amongst the ploughs, though the fences are happily easier, forethought and
  consideration are even more required for ground. After much rain, do not
  enter a turnip-field if you can help it, the large, frequent roots loosen the
  soil, and your horse will go in up to his hocks; young wheat also it is well
  to avoid, if only for reasons purely selfish; but on the fallows, when you
  find a _wet_ furrow, lying the right way, put on steam, splash boldly ahead,
  and never leave it so long as it serves you in your line. The same may be
  said of a foot-path, even though its guidance should entail the jumping of
  half-a-dozen stiles. Sound foothold reduces the size of any leap, and while
  you are travelling easily above the ground, the rest of the chase, fox and
  hounds too, as well as horses, though in a less degree, are labouring through
  the mire.</p>

  <p>When your course is intersected by narrow water-cuts, for purposes of
  irrigation, by covered drains, or deep, grass-grown cart-ruts, it will be
  well to traverse them obliquely, so that, if they catch the stride of his
  gallop, your horse may only get one foot in at a time. He will then right
  himself with a flounder, whereas, if held by both legs, either before or
  behind, the result is a rattling fall, very dangerous to his back in the one
  case, and to your own neck in the other.</p>

  <p>Valour of course insists that a hunter should do what he is bid, but there
  are some situations in which the beast's discretion pleads reasonably enough
  for some forbearance from its master. If a good horse, thoroughly experienced
  in the exigencies of the sport, that you have ridden a season or two, and
  flatter yourself you understand, persistently refuses a fence, depend upon it
  there is sufficient reason. The animal may be lame from an injury just
  received, may have displaced a joint, broken a tendon, or even ruptured an
  artery. Perhaps it is so blown as to feel it must fall in the effort you
  require. At any rate do not persevere. Horses have been killed, and men also,
  through a sentiment of sheer obstinacy that would not be denied, and humanity
  should at least think shame to be out-done in discretion by the brute. A
  horse is a wise creature enough, or he could never carry us pleasantly to
  hounds. An old friend of mine used to say: "People talk about size and shape,
  shoulders, quarters, blood, bone, and muscle, but for my part, give me a
  hunter with brains. He has to take care of the biggest fool of the two, and
  think for both!"</p>

  <p>Discretion, then, is one of the most valuable qualities for an animal
  charged with such heavy responsibilities, that bears us happy and triumphant
  during the day, and brings us safe home at night. Who would grudge a journey
  across St. George's Channel to find this desirable quality in its highest
  perfection at Ballinasloe or Cahirmee? for indeed it is not too much to say
  that whatever we may think of her natives, the most discreet and sagacious of
  our hunters come over from the Emerald Isle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; IRISH HUNTERS.</h2>

  <p class="first">"An' niver laid an iron to the sod!" was a metaphor I once
  heard used by an excellent fellow from Limerick, to convey the brilliant
  manner in which a certain four-year-old he was describing performed during a
  burst, when, his owner told me, he went clean away from all rivals in his
  gallop, and flew every wall, bank, and ditch, in his stride.</p>

  <p>The expression, translated into English, would seem to imply that he
  neither perched on the grass-grown banks, with all four feet at once, like a
  cat, nor struck back at them with his hind legs, like a dog; and perhaps my
  friend made the more account of this hazardous style of jumping, that it
  seemed so foreign to the usual characteristics of the Irish horse.</p>

  <p>For those who have never hunted in Ireland, I must explain that the
  country as a general rule is fenced on a primitive system, requiring little
  expenditure of capital beyond the labour of a man, or, as he is there called,
  "a boy," with a short pipe in his mouth and a spade in his hand. This
  light-hearted operative, gay, generous, reckless, high-spirited, and by no
  means a free worker, simply throws a bank up with the soil that he scoops out
  of the ditch, reversing the process, and filling the latter by levelling the
  former, when a passage is required for carts, or cattle, from one inclosure
  to the next. I ought nevertheless to observe, that many landlords, with a
  munificence for which I am at a loss to account, go to the expense of
  erecting massive pillars of stone, ostensibly gate-posts, at commanding
  points, between which supports, however, they seldom seem to hang a gate,
  though it is but justice to admit that when they do, the article is usually
  of iron, very high, very heavy, and fastened with a strong padlock, though
  its object seems less apparent, when we detect within convenient distance on
  either side a gap through which one might safely drive a gig.</p>

  <p>It is obvious, then, that this kind of fence, at its widest and deepest,
  requires considerable activity as well as circumspection on a horse's part,
  and forbearance in handling on that of a rider. The animal must gather itself
  to spring like a goat, on the crest of the eminence it has to surmount, with
  perfect liberty of head and neck, for the climb, and subsequent effort, that
  may, or may not be demanded. Neither man nor beast can foresee what is
  prepared for them on the landing side, and a clever Irish hunter brings
  itself up short in an instant, should the gulf be too formidable for its
  powers, balancing on the brink, to look for a better spot, or even leaping
  back again into the field from which it came.</p>

  <p>That the Irishman rides with a light bridle and lets it very much alone is
  the necessary result. His pace at the fences must be slow, because it is not
  a horse's nature, however rash, to rush at a place like the side of a house;
  and instinct prompts the animal to collect itself without restraint from a
  rider's hand, while any interference during the second and downward spring
  would only tend to pull it back into the chasm it is doing its best to
  clear.</p>

  <p>The efforts by which an Irish hunter surmounts these national impediments
  is like that of a hound jumping a wall. The horse leaps to the top with
  fore-and-hind feet together, where it dwells, almost imperceptibly, while
  shifting the purchase, or "changing," as the natives call it, in the shortest
  possible stride, of a few inches at most, to make the second spring. Every
  good English hunter will strike back with his hind legs when surprised into
  sudden exertion, but only a proficient bred, or at least, taught in the
  sister island, can master the feat described above in such artistic form as
  leads one to believe that, like Pegasus, the creature has wings at every
  heel. No man who has followed hounds in Meath, Kilkenny, or Kildare will ever
  forget the first time, when, to use the vernacular of those delightful
  countries, he rode "an accomplished hunter over an intricate lep!"</p>

  <p>But the merit is not heaven-born. On the contrary, it seems the result of
  patient and judicious tuition, called by Irish breakers "training," in which
  they show much knowledge of character and sound common sense.</p>

  <p>In some counties, such as Roscommon and Connemara, the brood mare indeed,
  with the foal at her foot, runs wild over extensive districts, and, finding
  no gates against which to lean, leaps leisurely from pasture to pasture,
  pausing, perhaps, in her transit to crop the sweeter herbage from some bank
  on which she is perched. Where mamma goes her little one dutifully follows,
  imitating the maternal motions, and as a charming mother almost always has a
  charming daughter, so, from its earliest foalhood, the future hunter acquires
  an activity, courage, and sagacity that shall hereafter become the admiration
  of crowded hunting-fields in the land of the Saxon far, far away!</p>

  <p>But whereas in many parts of Ireland improved agriculture denies space for
  the unrestrained vagaries of these early lessons, a judicious system is
  adopted that substitutes artificial education for that of nature. "It is
  wonderful we don't get more falls," said one of the boldest and best of lady
  riders, who during many seasons followed the pilotage of Jem Mason, and but
  for failing eye-sight, could sometimes have gone before him, "when we
  consider that we all ride half-broken horses," and, no doubt, on our side of
  the Channel, the observation contained a great deal of truth. But in this
  respect our neighbours show more wisdom. They seldom bring a pupil into the
  hunting-field till the elementary discipline has been gone through that
  teaches him when he comes to his fence _what to do with it_. He may be three,
  he may be four. I have seen a sportsman in Kilkenny so unassumingly equipped
  that instead of boots he wore wisps of straw called, I believe, "_sooghauns_"
  go in front for a quarter of an hour on a two-year old! Whatever his age, the
  colt shows himself an experienced hunter when it is necessary to leap. Not
  yet _mouthed_, with unformed paces and wandering action, he may seem the
  merest baby on the road or across a field, but no veteran can be wiser or
  steadier when he comes within distance of it, or, as his owner would say,
  when he "challenges" his leap, and this enthusiast hardly over-states the
  truth in affirming that his pupil "would change on the edge of a razor, and
  never let ye know he was off the Queen's high-road, God bless her, all the
  time!"</p>

  <p>The Irishman, like the Arab, seems to possess a natural insight into the
  character of a horse; with many shortcomings as grooms, not the least of
  which are want of neatness in stable-management, and rooted dislike to hard
  work, except by fits and starts, they cherish extraordinary affection for
  their charges, and certainly in their dealings with them obviously prefer
  kindness to coercion. I do not think they always understand feeding
  judiciously, and many of them have much to learn about getting horses into
  condition; but they are unrivalled in teaching them to jump.</p>

  <p>Though seldom practised, there is no better system in all undertakings
  than "to begin with the beginning," and an Irish horse-breaker is so
  persuaded of this great elementary truth that he never asks the colt to
  attempt three feet till it has become thoroughly master of two. With a
  cavesson rein, a handful of oats, and a few yards of waste ground behind the
  potato-ground or the pig-styes, he will, by dint of skill and patience, turn
  the most blundering neophyte into an expert and stylish fencer in about six
  weeks. As he widens the ditch of his earthwork, he necessarily heightens its
  bank, which his simple tools, the spade and the pipe, soon raise to six or
  seven feet. When the young one has learned to surmount this temperately, but
  with courage, to change on the top, and deliver itself handsomely, with the
  requisite fling and freedom, on the far side, he considers it sufficiently
  advanced to take into the fields, where he leads it forthwith, leaving behind
  him the spade, but holding fast to the corn, the cavesson, and the pipe. Here
  he soon teaches his colt to wait, quietly grazing, or staring about, while he
  climbs the fence he intends it to jump, and almost before the long rein can
  be tightened it follows like a dog, to poke its nose in his hand for the few
  grains of oats it expects as a reward.</p>

  <p>Some breakers drive their pupils from behind, with reins, pulling them up
  when they have accomplished the leap; but this is not so good a plan as
  necessitating the use of the whip, and having, moreover, a further
  disadvantage in accustoming the colt to stop dead short on landing, a habit
  productive hereafter of inconvenience to a loose rider taken unawares!</p>

  <p>When he has taught his horse thus to _walk_ over a country, for two or
  three miles on end, the breaker considers it, with reason, thoroughly trained
  for leaping, and has no hesitation however low its condition, in riding it
  out with the hounds. Who that has hunted in Ireland but can recall the
  interest, and indeed amusement, with which he has watched some mere baby,
  strangely tackled and uncouthly equipped, sailing along in the front rank,
  steered with consummate skill and temper by a venerable rider who looks sixty
  on horseback, and at least eighty on foot. The man's dress is of the
  shabbiest and most incongruous, his boots are outrageous, his spurs ill put
  on, and his hat shows symptoms of ill-usage in warfare or the chase; but he
  sits in the saddle like a workman, and age has no more quenched the courage
  in his bright Irish eye, than it has soured the mirth of his temperament, or
  saddened the music of his brogue. You know instinctively that he must be a
  good fellow and a good sportsman; you cannot follow him for half a mile
  without being satisfied that he is a good rider, and you forget, in your
  admiration of his beast's performance, your surprise at its obvious youth,
  its excessive leanness, and the unusual shabbiness of its accoutrements.
  Inspecting these more narrowly, if you can get near enough, you begin to
  grudge the sums you have paid Bartley, or Wilkinson and Kidd, for the neat
  turn-out you have been taught to consider indispensable to success. You see
  that a horse may cross a dangerous country speedily and in safety, though its
  saddle be pulpy and weather-stained, with unequal stirrup-leathers, and only
  one girth; though its bridle be a Pelham, _with_ a noseband, and _without_ a
  curb-chain, while one rein seems most untrustworthy, and the other, for want
  of a buckle, has its ends tied in a knot. And yet, wherever the hounds go,
  thither follow this strangely-equipped pair. They arrive at a seven-foot
  bank, defended by a wide and, more forbidding still, an enormously deep ditch
  on this side and with nothing apparently but blue sky on the other. While the
  man utters an exclamation that seems a threat, a war-cry, and a shout of
  triumph combined, the horse springs to the summit, perches like a bird, and
  disappears buoyantly into space as if furnished, indeed, with wings, that it
  need only spread to fly away. They come to a stone-gap, as it is termed;
  neither more nor less than a disused egress, made up with blocks of granite
  into a wall about five feet high, and the young one, getting close under it,
  clears the whole out of a trot, with the elasticity and the very action of a
  deer. Presently some frightful chasm has to be encountered, wide enough for a
  brook, deep enough for a ravine, boggy of approach, faced with stone, and
  offering about as awkward an appearance as ever defeated a good man on his
  best hunter and bade him go to look for a better place.</p>

  <p>Our friend in the bad hat, who knows what he is about, rides at this
  "yawner" a turn slower than would most Englishmen, and with a lighter hand on
  his horse's mouth, though his legs and knees are keeping the pupil well into
  its bridle, and, should the latter want to refuse, or "renage," as they say
  in Ireland, a disgrace of which it has not the remotest idea, there is a slip
  of ground-ash in the man's fingers ready to administer "a refresher" on its
  flank. "Did ye draw now?" asks an Irishman when his friend is describing how
  he accomplished some extraordinary feat in leaping, and the expression,
  derived from an obsolete custom of sticking the cutting-whip upright in the
  boot, so that it has come to mean punishment from that instrument, is nearly
  always answered&mdash;"I did _not_!" Light as a fairy, our young, but
  experienced hunter dances down to the gulf, and leaves it behind with scarce
  an effort, while an unwashed hand bestows its caress on the reeking neck that
  will hereafter thicken prodigiously in some Saxon stable on a proper
  allowance of corn. If you are riding an Irish horse, you cannot do better
  than imitate closely every motion of the pair in front. If not, you will be
  wise, I think, to turn round and go home.</p>

  <p>Presently we will hope, for the sake of the neophyte, whose condition is
  by no means on a par with his natural powers, the hounds either kill their
  fox, or run him to ground, or lose, or otherwise account for him, thus
  affording a few minutes' repose for breathing and conversation. "It's an
  intrickate country," observes some brother-sportsman with just such another
  mount to the veteran I have endeavoured to describe; "and will that be the
  colt by Chitchat out of Donovan's mare? Does he 'lep' well now?" he adds with
  much interest. "The beautifullest ever ye see!" answers his friend, and
  nobody who has witnessed the young horse's performances can dispute the
  justice of such a reply. It is not difficult to understand that hunters so
  educated and so ridden in a country where every leap requires power, courage,
  and the exercise of much sagacity, should find little difficulty in
  surmounting such obstacles as confront them on this side of the Channel. It
  is child's play to fly a Leicestershire fence, even with an additional rail,
  for a horse that has been taught his business amongst the precipitous banks
  and fathomless ditches of Meath or Kildare. If the ground were always sound
  and the hills somewhat levelled, these Irish hunters would find little to
  stop them in Leicestershire from going as straight as their owners dared
  ride. Practice at walls renders them clever timber-jumpers, they have usually
  the spring and confidence that make nothing of a brook, and their careful
  habit of preparing for something treacherous on the landing side of every
  leap prevents their being taken unawares by the "oxers" and doubles that form
  such unwelcome exceptions to the usual run of impediments throughout the
  shires. There is something in the expression of their very ears while we put
  them at their fences, that seems to say, "It's a good trick enough, and would
  take in most horses, but my mother taught me a thing or two in Connemara, and
  you don't come over me!" Unfortunately the Shires, as they are called _par
  excellence_, the Vale of Aylesbury, a perfect wilderness of grass, and indeed
  all the best hunting districts, ride very deep nine seasons out of ten, so
  that the Irish horse, accustomed to a sound lime-stone soil and an unfurrowed
  surface in his own green island, being moreover usually much wanting in
  condition, feels the added labour, and difference of action required,
  severely enough. It is proverbial that a horse equal to fourteen stone in
  Ireland is only up to thirteen in Leicestershire, and English purchasers must
  calculate accordingly.</p>

  <p>But if some prize-taker at the Dublin Horse Show, or other ornament of
  that land which her natives call the "first flower of the earth and first gem
  of the sea," should disappoint you a little when you ride him in November
  from Ranksborough, the Coplow, Crick, Melton-Spinney, Christmas-Gorse,
  Great-Wood, or any other favourite covert in one of our many good hunting
  countries, do not therefore despond. If he fail in deep ground, or labour on
  ridge and furrow, remember he possesses this inestimable merit that _he can
  go the shortest way_! Because the fence in front is large, black, and
  forbidding, you need not therefore send him at it a turn faster than usual;
  he is accustomed to spring _from his back_, and cover large places out of a
  trot. If you ride your own line to hounds, it is no slight advantage thus to
  have the power of negotiating awkward corners, without being "committed to
  them" fifty yards off, unable to pull up should they prove impracticable; and
  the faculty of "jumping at short notice," on this consideration alone, I
  conceive to be one of the choicest qualities a hunter can possess. Also, even
  in the most favoured and flying of the "grass countries," many fences require
  unusual steadiness and circumspection. If they are to be done at all, they
  can only be accomplished by creeping, sometimes even _climbing_ to the
  wished-for side. The front rank itself will probably shirk these unaccustomed
  obstacles with cordial unanimity, leaving them to be triumphantly disposed of
  by your new purchase from Kildare. He pokes out his nose, as if to inspect
  the depth of a possible interment, and it is wise to let him manage it all
  his own way. You give him his head, and the slightest possible kick in the
  ribs. With a cringe of his powerful back and quarters, a vigorous lift that
  seems to reach two-thirds of the required distance, a second spring,
  apparently taken from a twig weak enough to bend under a bird, that covers
  the remainder, a scramble for foothold, a half stride and a snort of
  satisfaction, the whole is disposed of, and you are alone with the
  hounds.</p>

  <p>Though, under such circumstances, these seem pretty sure to run to ground
  or otherwise disappoint you within half-a-mile, none the less credit is due
  to your horse's capabilities, and you vow next season to have nothing but
  Irish nags in your stable, resolving for the future to ride straighter than
  you have ever done before.</p>

  <p>But if you are so well pleased now with your promising Patlander, what
  shall you think of him this time next year, when he has had twelve months of
  your stud-groom's stable-management, and consumed ten or a dozen quarters of
  good English oats? Though you may have bought him as a six-year old, he will
  have grown in size and substance, even in height, and will not only look, but
  feel up to a stone more weight than you ever gave him credit for. He can jump
  when he is blown _now_, but he will never be blown _then_. Condition will
  teach him to laugh at the deep ground, while his fine shoulders and true
  shape will enable him, after the necessary practice, to travel across ridge
  and furrow without a lurch. He will have turned out a rattling good horse,
  and you will never grudge the cheque you wrote, nor the punch you were
  obliged to drink, before his late proprietor would let you make him your
  own.</p>

  <p>Gold and whisky, in large quantities and judiciously applied, may no doubt
  buy the best horses in Ireland. But a man must know where to look for them,
  and even in remote districts, will sometimes be disappointed to find that the
  English dealers have forestalled him. Happily, there are so many good horses,
  perhaps I should say, so few _rank bad ones_, bred in the country, that from
  the very sweepings and leavings of the market, one need not despair of
  turning up a trump. A hunter is in so far like a wife, that experience alone
  will prove whether he is or is not good for nothing. Make and shape, in
  either case, may be perfect, pedigree unimpeachable, and manners blameless,
  but who is to answer for temper, reflection, docility, and the generous
  staying power that accepts rough and smooth, ups and downs, good and evil,
  without a struggle or a sob? When we have tried them, we find them out, and
  can only make the best of our disappointment, if they do not fully come up to
  our expectations.</p>

  <p>There is many a good hunter, particularly in a rich man's stable, that
  never has a chance of proving its value. With three or four, we know their
  form to a pound; with a dozen, season after season goes by without furnishing
  occasion for the use of all, till some fine scenting day, after mounting a
  friend, we are surprised to learn that the flower of the whole stud has
  hitherto been esteemed but a moderate animal, only fit to carry the
  sandwiches, and bring us home.</p>

  <p>I imagine, notwithstanding all we have heard and read concerning the
  difficulty of buying Irish horses in their own country, that there are still
  scores of them in Cork, Limerick, and other breeding districts, as yet
  unpromised and unsold. The scarcity of weight-carriers is indisputable, but
  can we find them here? The "light man's horse," to fly under sixteen stone,
  is a "black swan" everywhere, and if _not_ "a light man's horse," that is to
  say, free, flippant, fast, and well-bred, he will never give his stalwart
  rider thorough satisfaction; but in Ireland, far more plentifully than in
  England, are still to be found handsome, clever, hunting-like animals fit to
  carry thirteen stone, and capital jumpers at reasonable prices, varying from
  one to two hundred pounds. The latter sum, particularly if you had it with
  you in _sovereigns_, would in most localities insure the "pick of the
  basket," and ten or twenty of the coins thrown back for luck.</p>

  <p>I have heard it objected to Irish hunters, that they are so accustomed to
  "double" all their places, as to practise this accomplishment even at those
  flying fences of the grazing districts which ought to be taken in the stride,
  and that they require fresh tuition before they can be trusted at the
  staked-and-bound or the bullfinch, lest, catching their feet in the growers
  as in a net, they should be tumbled headlong to the ground. I can only say
  that I have been well and safely carried by many of them on their first
  appearance in Leicestershire, as in other English countries, that they seemed
  intuitively to apprehend the character of the fences they had to deal with,
  and that, although being mortal, they could not always keep on their legs, I
  cannot remember one of them giving me a fall _because_ he was an Irish
  horse!</p>

  <p>How many their nationality has saved me, I forbear to count, but I am
  persuaded that the careful tuition undergone in youth, and their varied
  experience when sufficiently advanced to follow hounds over their native
  country, imparts that facility of powerful and safe jumping, which is one of
  the most important qualities among the many that constitute a hunter.</p>

  <p>They possess also the merit of being universally well-bred. This is an
  advantage no sportsman will overlook who likes to be near hounds while they
  run, but objects to leading, driving, or perhaps _pushing_ his horse home.
  Till within a few years, there was literally _no_ cart-horse blood in
  Ireland. The "black-drop" of the ponderous Clydesdale remained positively
  unknown, and although the Suffolk Punch has been recently introduced, he
  cannot yet have sufficiently tainted the pedigrees of the country, to render
  us mistrustful of a golden-coated chestnut, with a round barrel and a strong
  back.</p>

  <p>No, their horses if not quite "clean-bred," as the Irish themselves call
  it, are at least of illustrious parentage on both sides a few generations
  back, and this high descent cannot but avail them, when called on for
  long-continued exertion, particularly at the end of the day.</p>

  <p>Juvenal, hurling his scathing satire against the patricians of his time,
  drew from the equine race a metaphor to illustrate the superiority of merit
  over birth. However unanswerable in argument, he was, I think, wrong in his
  facts. Men and women are to be found of every parentage, good, bad, and
  indifferent; but with horses, there is more in race than in culture, and for
  the selection of these noble animals at least, I can imagine no safer guide
  than the aristocratic maxim, "Blood will tell!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THOROUGH-BRED HORSES.</h2>

  <p class="first">I have heard it affirmed, though I know not on what
  authority, that if we are to believe the hunting records of the last hundred
  years, in all runs so severe and protracted as to admit of only one man
  getting to the finish, this exceptional person was in _every_ instance,
  riding an old horse, a thorough-bred horse, and a horse under
  fifteen-two!</p>

  <p>Perhaps on consideration, this is a less remarkable statement than it
  appears. That the survivor was an old horse, means that he had many years of
  corn and condition to pull him through; that he was a little horse, infers he
  carried a light weight, but that he was a thorough-bred horse seems to me a
  reasonable explanation of the whole.</p>

  <p>"The thorough-bred ones never stop," is a common saying among sportsmen,
  and there are daily instances of some high-born steed who can boast</p>

  <p class="verse">"His sire from the desert, his dam from the north,"</p>

  <p class="first">galloping steadily on, calm and vigorous, when the country
  behind him is dotted for miles with hunters standing still in every
  field.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that a breed, reared expressly for racing purposes, must be
  the fastest of its kind. A colt considered good enough to be "put through the
  mill" on Newmarket Heath, or Middleham Moor, whatever may be his shortcomings
  in the select company he finds at school, cannot but seem "a flyer," when in
  after-life he meets horses, however good, that have neither been bred nor
  trained for the purpose of galloping a single mile at the rate of an express
  train. While these are at speed he is only cantering, and we need not
  therefore be surprised that he can keep cantering on after they are reduced
  to a walk.</p>

  <p>In the hunting-field, "what kills is the pace." When hounds can make it
  good enough they kill their fox, when horses _cannot_ it kills _them_, and
  for this reason alone, if for no other, I would always prefer that my hunters
  should be quite thorough-bred.</p>

  <p>Though undoubtedly the best, I cannot affirm, however, that they are
  always the _pleasantest_ mounts; far from it, indeed, just at first, though
  subsequent superiority makes amends for the little eccentricities of gait and
  temper peculiar to pupils from the racing-stable in their early youth.</p>

  <p>An idle, lurching mover, rather narrow before the saddle, with great power
  of back and loins, a habit of bearing on its rider's hand, one side to its
  mouth, and a loose neck, hardly inspires a careful man with the confidence
  necessary for enjoyment; coming away from Ranksborough, for instance,
  down-hill, with the first fence leaning towards him, very little room, his
  horse too much extended, going on its shoulders, and getting the better of
  him at every stride!</p>

  <p>But this is an extreme case, purposely chosen to illustrate at their
  worst, the disadvantages of riding a thorough-bred horse.</p>

  <p>It is often our own fault, when we buy one of these illustrious cast-offs,
  that our purchase so disappoints us after we have got it home. Many men
  believe that to carry them through an exhausting run, such staying powers are
  required as win under high weights and at long distances on the turf.</p>

  <p>Their selection, therefore, from the racing-stable, is some young one of
  undeniably stout blood, that when "asked the question" for the first time,
  has been found too slow to put in training. They argue with considerable show
  of reason, that it will prove quite speedy enough for a hunter, but they
  forget that though a fast horse is by no means indispensable to the chase, a
  _quick_ one is most conducive to enjoyment when we are compelled to jump all
  sorts of fences out of all sorts of ground.</p>

  <p>Now a yearling, quick enough on its legs to promise a turn of speed, is
  pretty sure to be esteemed worth training, nor will it be condemned as
  useless, till its distance is found to be just short of half-a-mile. In plain
  English, when it fails under the strain on wind and frame, of galloping at
  its very best, eight hundred and seventy yards, and "fades to nothing" in the
  next ten.</p>

  <p>Now this collapse is really more a question of speed than stamina. There
  is a want of reach or leverage somewhere, that makes its rapid action too
  laborious to be lasting, but there is no reason why the animal that comes
  short of five furlongs on the trial-ground, should not hold its own in front,
  for five miles of a steeple-chase, or fifteen of a run with hounds.</p>

  <p>These, in fact, are the so-called "weeds" that win our cross-country
  races, and when we reflect on the pace and distance of the Liverpool, four
  miles and three-quarters run in something under eleven minutes, at anything
  but feather-weights, and over all sorts of fences, we cannot but admire the
  speed, gallantry, and endurance, the essentially _game_ qualities of our
  English horse. And here I may observe that a good steeple-chaser, properly
  sobered and brought into his bridle, is one of the pleasantest hunters a man
  can ride, particularly in a flying country. He is sure to be able to "make
  haste" in all sorts of ground, while the smooth, easy stride that wins
  between the flags is invaluable through dirt. He does not lose his head and
  turn foolish, as do many good useful hunters, when bustled along for a mile
  or two at something like racing pace. Very quick over his fences, his style
  of jumping is no less conducive to safety than despatch, while his courage is
  sure to be undeniable, because the slightest tendency to refuse would have
  disqualified him for success in his late profession, wherein also, he must
  necessarily have learnt to be a free and brilliant water-jumper.</p>

  <p>Indeed you may always take _two_ liberties with a steeple-chase horse
  during a run (not more). The first time you squeeze him, he thinks, "Oh! this
  is the brook!" and putting on plenty of steam, flings himself as far as ever
  he can. The second, he accepts your warning with equal good will. "All
  right!" he seems to answer, "This is the brook, coming home!" but if you try
  the same game a third time, I cannot undertake to say what may happen, you
  will probably puzzle him exceedingly, upset his temper, and throw him out of
  gear for the day.</p>

  <p>We have travelled a long way, however, from our original subject, tuition
  of the thorough-bred for the field, or perhaps I should call it the task of
  turning a bad race-horse into a good hunter.</p>

  <p>Like every other process of education this requires exceeding
  perseverance, and a patience not to be overcome. The irritation of a moment
  may undo the lessons of a week, and if the master forgets himself, you may be
  sure the pupil will long remember which of the two was in fault. Never begin
  a quarrel if it can possibly be avoided, because, when war is actually
  declared, you must fight it out to the bitter end, and if you are beaten, you
  had better send your horse to Tattersall's, for you will never be master
  again.</p>

  <p>Stick to him till he does what you require, trusting, nevertheless, rather
  to time than violence, and if you can get him at last to obey you of his own
  free will, without knowing why, I cannot repeat too often, you will have won
  the most conclusive of victories.</p>

  <p>When the late Sir Charles Knightley took Sir Marinel out of training, and
  brought him down to Pytchley, to teach him the way he should go (and the way
  of Sir Charles over a country was that of a bird in the air), he found the
  horse restive, ignorant, wilful, and unusually averse to learning the
  business of a hunter. The animal, was, however, well worth a little
  painstaking, and his owner, a perfect centaur in the saddle, rode him out for
  a lesson in jumping the first day the hounds remained in the kennel. At two
  o'clock, as his old friend and contemporary, Mr. John Cooke informed me, he
  came back, having failed to get the rebel over a single fence. "But I have
  told them not to take his saddle off," said Sir Charles, sitting down to a
  cutlet and a glass of Madeira, "after luncheon I mean to have a turn at him
  again!"</p>

  <p>So the baronet remounted and took the lesson up where he had left off.
  Nerve, temper, patience, the strongest seat, and the finest hands in England,
  could not but triumph at last, and this thorough-bred pair came home at
  dinner-time, having larked over all the stiffest fences in the country, with
  perfect unanimity and good will. Sir Marinel, and Benvolio, also a
  thorough-bred horse, were by many degrees, Sir Charles has often told me, the
  best hunters he ever had.</p>

  <p>Shuttlecock too, immortalized in the famous Billesdon-Coplow poem,
  when</p>

  <p class="verse">"Villiers esteemed it a serious bore, That no longer could
  Shuttlecock fly as before,"</p>

  <p class="first">was a clean thorough-bred horse, fast enough to have made a
  good figure on the race-course, but with a rooted disinclination to jump.</p>

  <p>That king of horsemen, the grandfather of the present Lord Jersey, whom I
  am proud to remember having seen ride fairly away from a whole Leicestershire
  field, over a rough country not far from Melton, at seventy-three, told me
  that this horse, though it turned out eventually one of his safest and
  boldest fencers, at the end of six weeks' tuition would not jump the
  leaping-bar the height of its own knees! His lordship, however, who was
  blessed in perfection, with the sweet temper, as with the personal beauty and
  gallant bearing of his race, neither hurried nor ill-used it, and the time
  spent on the animal's education, though somewhat wearisome, was not thrown
  away.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gilmour's famous _Vingt-et-un_, the best hunter, he protests, by a
  great deal that gentleman ever possessed, was quite thorough-bred. Seventeen
  hands high, but formed all over in perfect proportion to this commanding
  frame, it may easily be imagined that the power and stride of so large an
  animal made light of ordinary obstacles, and I do not believe, though it may
  sound an extravagant assertion, there was a fence in the whole of
  Leicestershire that could have stopped _Vingt-et-un_ and his rider, on a good
  scenting day some few years ago. Such men and such horses ought never to grow
  old.</p>

  <p>Mr. William Cooke, too, owned a celebrated hunter called Advance, of
  stainless pedigree, as was December, so named from being foaled on the last
  day of that month, a premature arrival that lost him his year for racing
  purposes by twenty-four hours, and transferred the colt to the
  hunting-stables. Mr. Cooke rode nothing but this class, nor indeed could any
  animal less speedy than a race-horse, sustain the pace he liked to go.</p>

  <p>Whitenose, a beautiful animal that the late Sir Richard Sutton affirmed
  was not only the best hunter he ever owned, but that he ever saw or heard of,
  and on whose back he is painted in Sir F. Grant's spirited picture of the
  Cottesmore Meet, was also quite thorough-bred. When Sir Richard hunted the
  Burton country, Whitenose carried him through a run so severe in pace and of
  such long duration, that not another horse got to the end, galloping, his
  master assured me, steadily on without a falter, to the last. By the way, he
  was then of no great age, and nearer sixteen hands than fifteen-two! This was
  a very easy horse to ride, and could literally jump anything he got his nose
  over. A picture to look at, with a coat like satin, the eyes of a deer, and
  the truest action in his slow as in his fast paces, he has always been my
  ideal of perfection in a hunter.</p>

  <p>But it would be endless to enumerate the many examples I can recall of the
  thorough-bred's superiority in the hunting-field. Those I have mentioned
  belong to a by-gone time, but a man need not look very narrowly into any knot
  of sportsmen at the present day, particularly _after_ a sharpish scurry in
  deep ground, before his eye rests on the thin tail, and smoothly turned
  quarters, that need no gaudier blazon to attest the nobility of their
  descent.</p>

  <p>If you mean, however, to ride a thorough-bred one, and choose to _make_
  him yourself, do not feel disappointed that he seems to require more time and
  tuition than his lower-born cousins, once and twice removed.</p>

  <p>In the first place you will begin by thinking him wanting in courage!
  Where the half-bred one, eager, flurried, and excited, rushes wildly at an
  unaccustomed difficulty, your calmer gentleman proceeds deliberately to
  examine its nature, and consider how he can best accomplish his task. It is
  not that he has less valour, but more discretion! In the monotonous process
  of training, he has acquired, with other tiresome tricks, the habit of doing
  as little as he can, in the different paces, walk, canter, and gallop, of
  which he has become so weary. Even the excitement of hunting till hounds
  _really_ run, hardly dissipates his aristocratic lethargy, but only get him
  in front for one of those scurries that, perhaps twice in a season turn up a
  fox in twenty minutes, and if you _dare_ trust him, you will be surprised at
  the brilliant performance of your idle, negligent, wayward young friend. He
  bends kindly to the bridle he objected to all the morning, he tucks his
  quarters in, and _scours_ through the deep ground like a hare, he slides over
  rather than jumps his fences, with the easy swoop of a bird on the wing, and
  when everything of meaner race has been disposed of a field or two behind, he
  trots up to some high bit of timber, and leaps it gallantly without a pause,
  though only yesterday he would have turned round to kick at it for an
  hour!</p>

  <p>Still, there are many chances against your having such an opportunity as
  this. Most days the hounds do _not_ run hard. When they do, you are perhaps
  so unfortunate as to lose your start, and finally, should everything else be
  in your favour, it is twenty to one you are riding the wrong horse!</p>

  <p>Therefore, the process of educating your young one, must be conducted on
  quieter principles, and in a less haphazard way. If you can find a pack of
  harriers, and _their master does not object_, there is no better school for
  the troublesome or unwilling pupil. But remember, I entreat, that
  horsebreaking is prejudicial to sport, and most unwelcome. You are there on
  sufferance, take care to interfere with nobody, and above all, keep wide of
  the hounds! The great advantage you will find in harehunting over the wilder
  pursuit of the fox, is in the circles described by your game. There is plenty
  of time to "have it out" with a refuser, and indeed to turn him backwards and
  forwards if you please, over the same leap, without fear of being left
  behind. The "merry harriers" are pretty sure to return in a few minutes, and
  you can begin again, with as much enthusiasm of man and horse as if you had
  never been out of the hunt at all! Whip and spur, I need hardly insist,
  cannot be used too sparingly, and anything in the shape of haste or
  over-anxiety is prejudicial, but if it induces him to jump in his stride, you
  may ride this kind of horse a turn faster at his fences, than any other. You
  can trust him not to be in too great a hurry, and it is his nature to take
  care of himself. Till he has become thoroughly accustomed to his new
  profession, it is well to avoid such places as seem particularly distasteful
  and likely to make him rebel. His fine skin will cause him to be a little shy
  of thick bullfinches, and his sagacity mistrusts deep or blind ditches, such
  as less intelligent animals would run into without a thought. Rather select
  rails, or clean upright fences, that he can compass and understand. Try to
  imbue him with love for the sport and confidence in his rider. After a few
  weeks, he will turn his head from nothing, and go straighter, as well as
  faster, and longer than anything in your stable.</p>

  <p>An old Meltonian used to affirm that the first two articles of his creed
  for the hunting season were, "a perfectly pure claret, and thorough-bred
  horses." Of the former he was unsparing to his friends, the latter he used
  freely enough for himself. Certainly no man gave pleasanter dinners, or was
  better carried, and one might do worse than go to Melton with implicit
  reliance on these twin accessories of the chase. All opinions must be agreed,
  I fancy, about the one, but there are still many prejudices against the
  other. Heavy men especially declare they cannot find thorough-bred horses to
  carry them, forgetting, it would seem, that size is no more a criterion of
  strength than haste is of speed. The bone of a thorough-bred horse is of the
  closest and toughest fibre, his muscles are well developed, and his joints
  elastic. Do not these advantages infer power, no less than stamina, and in
  our own experience have we not all reason to corroborate the old-fashioned
  maxim, "It is action that carries weight"? Nimrod, who understood the subject
  thoroughly, observes with great truth, that "'Wind' is strength; when a horse
  is blown a mountain or a mole-hill are much the same to him," and no
  sportsman who has ever scaled a Highland hill to circumvent a red-deer, or
  walk up to "a point," will dispute the argument. What a game animal it is,
  that without touch of spur, at the mere pleasure and caprice of a rider,
  struggles gallantly on till it drops!</p>

  <p>There used to be a saying in the Prize Ring, that "Seven pounds will lick
  the best man in England." This is but a technical mode of stating that,
  _caeteris paribus_, weight means strength. Thirty years ago, it was a common
  practice at Melton to weigh hunters after they were put in condition, and
  sportsmen often wondered to find how the eye had deceived them, in the
  comparative tonnage, so to speak, and consequently, the horse-power of these
  different conveyances; the thorough-bred, without exception, proving far
  heavier than was supposed.</p>

  <p>An athlete, we all know, whether boxer, wrestler, pedestrian, cricketer or
  gymnast, looks smaller in his clothes, and larger when he is stripped.
  Similarly, on examining in the stable, "the nice little horse" we admired in
  the field, it surprises us to find nearly sixteen hands of height, and six
  feet of girth, with power to correspond in an animal of which we thought the
  only defect was want of size. A thorough-bred one is invariably a little
  bigger, and a great deal stronger than he looks. Of his power to carry
  weight, those tall, fine men who usually ride so judiciously and so straight,
  are not yet sufficiently convinced, although if you ask any celebrated
  "welter" to name the best horse he ever had, he is sure to answer, "Oh!
  little So-and-so. He wasn't up to my weight, but he carried me better than
  anything else in the stable!" Surely no criterion could be more satisfactory
  than this!</p>

  <p>It may not be out of place to observe here, as an illustration of the
  well-known maxim, "Horses can go in all shapes," that of the three heaviest
  men I can call to mind who rode perfectly straight to hounds, the best hunter
  owned by each was too long in the back. "Sober Robin," an extraordinary
  animal that could carry Mr. Richard Gurney, riding twenty stone, ahead of all
  the light-weights, was thus shaped. A famous bay-horse, nearly as good,
  belonging to the late Mr. Wood of Brixworth Hall, an equally heavy man, who
  when thus mounted, never stopped to open a gate! had, his owner used to
  declare, as many vertebrae as a crocodile, and Colonel Wyndham whose size and
  superiority in the saddle I have already mentioned, hesitated a week before
  he bought his famous black mare, the most brilliant hunter he ever possessed,
  because she was at least three inches too long behind the saddle!</p>

  <p>I remember also seeing the late Lord Mayo ride fairly away from a Pytchley
  field, no easy task, between Lilbourne and Cold Ashby, on a horse that except
  for its enormous depth of girth, arguing unfailing wind, seemed to have no
  good points whatever to catch the eye. It was tall, narrow, plain-headed,
  with very bad shoulders, and very long legs, all this to carry at least
  eighteen stone; but it was nearly, if not quite, thorough-bred.</p>

  <p>We need hardly dwell on the advantages of speed and endurance, inherited
  from the Arab, and improved, as we fondly hope, almost to perfection, through
  the culture of many generations, while even the fine temper of the
  "desert-born" has not been so warped by the tricks of stable-boys, and the
  severity of turf-discipline, but that a little forbearance and kind usage
  soon restores its natural docility.</p>

  <p>In all the qualities of a hunter, the thorough-bred horse, is, I think,
  superior to the rest of his kind. You can hardly do better than buy one, and
  "make him to your hand," should you be blessed with good nerves, a fine
  temper, and a delicate touch, or, wanting these qualities, confide him to
  some one so gifted, if you wish to be carried well and pleasantly, in your
  love for hunting, perhaps I should rather say, for the keen and stirring
  excitement we call "riding to hounds."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; RIDING TO FOX-HOUNDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">"If you want to be near hounds," says an old friend of mine
  who, for a life-time, has religiously practised what he preaches, "the method
  is simple, and seems only common sense&mdash;_keep as close to them as ever
  you can_!" but I think, though, with his undaunted nerve, and extraordinary
  horsemanship, he seems to find it feasible enough, this plan, for most
  people, requires considerable management, and no little modification.</p>

  <p>I grant we should never let them slip away from us, and that, in nine
  cases out of ten, when defeated by what we choose to call "a bad turn" it is
  our own fault. At the same time, there are many occasions on which a man who
  keeps his eyes open, and knows how to ride, can save his horse to some
  purpose, by travelling inside the pack, and galloping a hundred yards for
  their three.</p>

  <p>I say _who keeps his eyes open_, because, in order to effect this economy
  of speed and distance, it is indispensable to watch their doings narrowly,
  and to possess the experience that tells one when they are _really_ on the
  line, and when only flinging forward to regain, with the dash that is a
  fox-hound's chief characteristic, the scent they have over-run. Constant
  observation will alone teach us to distinguish the hounds that are right; and
  to turn with them judiciously, is the great secret of "getting to the
  end."</p>

  <p>We must, therefore, be within convenient distance, and to ensure such
  proximity, it is most desirable to get a good start. Let us begin at the
  beginning, and consider how this primary essential is to be obtained.</p>

  <p>Directly a move is made from the place of meeting, it is well to cut short
  all "coffee-house" conversation, even at the risk of neglecting certain
  social amenities, and to fix our minds at once on the work in hand. A good
  story, though pleasant enough in its way, cannot compare with a good run, and
  it is quite possible to lose the one by too earnest attention to the
  other.</p>

  <p>A few courteous words previously addressed to the huntsman will ensure his
  civility during the day; but this is not a happy moment for imparting to him
  your opinion on things in general and his own business in particular. He has
  many matters to occupy his thoughts, and does not care to see you in the
  middle of his favourites on a strange horse. It is better to keep the second
  whip between yourself and the hounds, jogging calmly on, with a pleasant view
  of their well-filled backs and handsomely-carried sterns, taking care to pull
  up, religiously murmuring the orthodox caution&mdash;"Ware horse!" when any
  one of them requires to pause for any purpose. You cannot too early impress
  on the hunt servants that you are a lover of the animal, most averse to
  interfering with it at all times, and especially in the ardour of the chase.
  If the size and nature of the covert will admit, you had better go into it
  with the hounds, and on this occasion, but no other, I think it is
  permissible to make use of the huntsman's pilotage at a respectful distance.
  Where there are foxes there is game, where game, riot. A few young hounds
  must come out with every pack, and the _rate_ or _cheer_ of your leader will
  warn you whether their opening music means a false flourish or a welcome
  find. Also where he goes you can safely follow, and need have no misgivings
  that the friendly hand-gate for which he is winding down some tortuous ride
  will be nailed up.</p>

  <p>Besides, though floundering in deep, sloughy woodlands entails
  considerable labour on your horse, it is less distressing than that gallop of
  a mile or two at speed which endeavours, but usually fails, to make amends
  for a bad start; whereas, if you get away on good terms, you can indulge him
  with a pull at the first opportunity, and those scenting days are indeed rare
  on which hounds run many fields without at least a hover, if not a check.</p>

  <p>Some men take their station outside the covert, down wind, in a commanding
  position, so as to hear every turn of the hounds, secure a front place for
  the sport, and&mdash;head the fox!</p>

  <p>But we will suppose all such difficulties overcome; that a little care,
  attention, and common sense have enabled you to get away on good terms with
  the pack; and that you emerge not a bowshot off, while they stream across the
  first field with a dash that brings the mettle to your heart and the blood to
  your brain. Do not, therefore, lose your head. It is the characteristic of
  good manhood to be physically calm in proportion to moral excitement.
  Remember there are two occasions in chase when the manner of hounds is not to
  be trusted. On first coming away with their fox, and immediately before they
  kill him, the steadiest will lead you to believe there is a burning scent and
  that they cannot make a mistake. Nevertheless, hope for the best, set your
  horse going, and if, as you sail over, or crash through, the first fence, you
  mark the pack driving eagerly on, drawn to a line at either end by the pace,
  harden your heart, and thank your stars. It is all right, you may lay odds,
  you are in for a really good thing!</p>

  <p>I suppose I need hardly observe that the laws of fox-hunting forbid you to
  follow hounds by the very obvious process of galloping in their track.
  Nothing makes them so wild, to use the proper term, as "riding on their
  line;" and should you be ignorant enough to attempt it, you are pretty sure
  to be told _where_ you are driving them, and desired to go there
  yourself!</p>

  <p>No; you must keep one side or the other, but do not, if you can help it,
  let the nature of the obstacles to be encountered bias your choice. Ride for
  ground as far as possible when the foothold is good; the fences will take
  care of themselves; but let no advantages of sound turf, nor even open gates,
  tempt you to stray more than a couple of hundred yards from the pack. At that
  distance a bad turn can be remedied, and a good one gives you leisure to pull
  back into a trot. Remember, too, that it is the nature of a fox, and we are
  now speaking of fox-hunting, to travel down wind; therefore, as a general
  rule, keep to leeward of the hounds. Every bend they make ought to be in your
  favour; but, on the other hand should they chance to turn up wind, they will
  begin to run very hard, and this is a good reason for never letting them get,
  so to speak, out of your reach. I repeat, as a _general rule_, but by no
  means without exception. In Leicestershire especially, foxes seem to scorn
  this fine old principle, and will make their point with a stiff breeze
  blowing in their teeth; but on such occasions they do not usually mean to go
  very far, and the gallant veteran, with his white tag, that gives you the run
  to be talked of for years, is almost always a wind-sinker from wold or
  woodland in an adjoining hunt.</p>

  <p>Suppose, however, the day is perfectly calm, and there seems no sufficient
  reason to prefer one course to the other, should we go to right or left? This
  is a matter in which neither precept nor personal experience can avail. One
  man is as sure to do right as the other to do wrong. There is an intuitive
  perception, more animal than human, of what we may call "the line of chase,"
  with which certain sportsmen are gifted by nature, and which, I believe,
  would bring them up at critical points of the finest and longest runs if they
  came out hunting in a gig. This faculty, where everything else is equal,
  causes A to ride better than B, but is no less difficult to explain than the
  instinct that guides an Indian on the prairie or a swallow across the sea. It
  counsels the lady in her carriage, or the old coachman piloting her children
  on their ponies, it enables the butcher to come up on his hack, the
  first-flight man to save his horse, and above all, the huntsman to kill his
  fox.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Beaufort possesses it in an extraordinary degree. When so
  crippled by gout, or reduced by suffering as to be unable to keep the saddle
  over a fence, he seems, even in strange countries, to see no less of the
  sport than in old days, when he could ride into every field with his hounds.
  And I do believe that now, in any part of Gloucestershire, with ten couple of
  "the badger-pyed" and a horn, he could go out and kill his fox in a
  Bath-chair!</p>

  <p>Perhaps, however, his may be an extreme case. No man has more experience,
  few such a natural aptitude and fondness for the sport. Lord Worcester, too,
  like his father, has shown how an educated gentleman, with abilities equal to
  all exigencies of a high position that affords comparatively little leisure
  for the mere amusements of life, can excel, in their own profession, men who
  have been brought up to it from childhood, whose thoughts and energies,
  winter and summer, morning, noon, and night, are concentrated on the business
  of the chase.</p>

  <p>This knack of getting to hounds then&mdash;should we consider genius or
  talent too strong terms to use for proficiency in field sports&mdash;while a
  most valuable quality to everybody who comes out hunting, is no less rare
  than precious. If we have it we are to be congratulated and our horses still
  more, but if, like the generality of men, we have it _not_, let us consider
  how far common sense and close attention will supply the want of a natural
  gift.</p>

  <p>It was said of an old friend of mine, the keenest of the keen, that he
  always rode as if he had never seen a run before, and should never see a run
  again! This, I believe, is something of the feeling with which we ought to be
  possessed, impelling us to take every legitimate advantage and to throw no
  possible chance away. It cannot be too often repeated that judicious choice
  of ground is the very first essential for success. Therefore the
  hunting-field has always been considered so good a school for cavalry
  officers. There seems no limit to the endurance of a horse in travelling over
  a hard and tolerably level surface, even under heavy weight, but we all know
  the fatal effect of a very few yards in a steam-ploughed field, when the
  gallant animal sinks to its hocks every stride. Keep an eye forward then, and
  shape your course where the foothold is smooth and sound. In a hilly country
  choose the sides of the slopes, above, rather than below, the pack, for, if
  they turn away from you, it is harder work to gallop up, than down. In the
  latter case, and for this little hint I am indebted to Lord Wilton, do not
  increase your speed so as to gain in distance, rather preserve the same
  regular pace, so as to save in wind. Descending an incline at an easy canter,
  and held well together, your horse is resting almost as if he were standing
  still. It is quite time enough when near the bottom to put on a spurt that
  will shoot him up the opposite rise.</p>

  <p>On the grass, if you _must_ cross ridge-and-furrow, take it a-slant, your
  horse will pitch less on his shoulders, and move with greater ease, while if
  they lie the right way, by keeping him on the crest, rather than in the
  trough of those long parallel rollers, you will ensure firm ground for his
  gallop, and a sounder, as well as higher take-off for the leap, when he comes
  to his fence.</p>

  <p>I need hardly remind you that in all swampy places, rushes may be trusted
  implicitly, and experienced hunters seem as well aware of the fact as their
  riders. Vegetable growth, indeed, of any kind has a tendency to suck moisture
  into its fibres, and consequently to drain, more or less, the surface in its
  immediate vicinity. The deep rides of a woodland are least treacherous at
  their edges, and the brink of a brook is most reliable close to some pollard
  or alder bush, particularly on the upper side, as Mr. Bromley Davenport knew
  better than most people, when he wrote his thrilling lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Then steady, my young one! the place I've selected<br>
  Above the dwarf willow, is sound, I'll be bail;<br>
  With your muscular quarters beneath you collected,<br>
  Prepare for a rush like the limited mail!"</p>

  <p>But we cannot always be on the grass, nor, happily are any of us obliged,
  often in a life time, to ride at the Whissendine!</p>

  <p>In ploughed land, choose a wet furrow, for the simple reason that water
  would not stand in it unless the bottom were hard, but if you cannot find
  one, nor a foot-path, nor a cart-track trampled down into a certain
  consistency, remember the fable of the hare and the tortoise, pull your horse
  back into a trot, and never fear but that you will be able to make up your
  leeway when you arrive at better ground. It is fortunate that the fences are
  usually less formidable here than in the pastures, and will admit of creeping
  into, and otherwise negotiating, with less expenditure of power, so you may
  travel pretty safely, and turn at pleasure, shorter than the hounds.</p>

  <p>There _are_ plough countries, notably in Gloucestershire and Wilts, that
  ride light. To them the above remarks in no way apply. Inclosed with stone
  walls, if there is anything like a scent, hounds carry such a head, and run
  so hard over these districts, that you must simply go as fast as your horse's
  pace, and as straight as his courage admits, but if you have the Duke of
  Beaufort's dog-pack in front of you, do not be surprised to find, with their
  extraordinary dash and enormous stride, that even on the pick of your stable,
  ere you can jump into one field they are half-way across the next.</p>

  <p>In hunting, as in everything else, compensation seems the rule of daily
  life, and the very brilliancy of the pace affords its own cure. Either hounds
  run into their fox, or, should he find room to turn, flash over the scent,
  and bring themselves to a check. You will not then regret having made play
  while you could, and although no good sportsman, and, indeed, no kind-hearted
  man, would overtax the powers of the most generous animal in creation, still
  we must remember that we came out for the purpose of seeing the fun, and
  unless we can keep near the hounds while they run we shall lose many
  beautiful instances of their sagacity when brought to their noses, and
  obliged to hunt.</p>

  <p>There is no greater treat to a lover of the chase than to watch a pack of
  high-bred fox-hounds that have been running hard on pasture, brought suddenly
  to a check on the dusty sun-dried fallows. After dashing and snatching in
  vain for a furlong or so, they will literally quarter their ground like
  pointers, till they recover the line, every yard of which they make good,
  with noses down and sterns working as if from the concentrated energy of all
  their faculties, till suspicion becomes certainty, and they lay themselves
  out once more, in the uncontrolled ecstasy of pursuit.</p>

  <p>Now if you are a mile behind, you miss all these interesting incidents,
  and lose, as does your disappointed hunter, more than half the amusement you
  both came out to enjoy. The latter too, works twice as hard when held back in
  the rear, as when ridden freely and fearlessly in front. The energy expended
  in fighting with his rider would itself suffice to gallop many a furlong and
  leap many a fence, while the moral effect of disappointment is most
  disheartening to a creature of such a highly-strung nervous organisation.
  Look at the work done by a huntsman's horse before the very commencement of
  some fine run, the triumphant conclusion of which depends so much on his
  freshness at the finish, and yet how rarely does he succumb to the labour of
  love imposed; but then he usually leaves the covert in close proximity to his
  friends the hounds, every minute of his toil is cheered by their
  companionship, and, having no leeway to make up he need not be overpaced when
  they are running their hardest, while he finds a moment's leisure to recover
  himself when they are hunting their closest and best. In those long and
  severe chases, to which, unhappily, two or three horses may sometimes be
  sacrificed, the "first flight" are not usually sufferers. Death from
  exhaustion is more likely to be inflicted cruelly, though unwittingly on his
  faithful friend and comrade, by the injudicious and hesitating rider, who has
  neither decision to seize a commanding position in front, nor self-denial to
  be satisfied with an unassuming retirement in rear. His valour and discretion
  are improperly mixed, like bad punch, and fatal is the result. A timely pull
  means simply the difference between breathlessness and exhaustion, but this
  opportune relief is only available for him who knows exactly how far they
  brought it, and where the hounds flashed beyond the line of their fox at a
  check.</p>

  <p>I remember in my youth, alas! long ago, "the old sportsman"&mdash;a
  character for whom, I fear, we entertained in my day less veneration than we
  professed&mdash;amongst many inestimable precepts was fond of propounding the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Young gentleman, nurse your hunter carefully at the beginning of a run,
  and when the others are tired he will enable you to see the end."</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">...We can but stop to listen, take counsel of a
    countryman</p>
  </div>

  <p>Now with all due deference to the old sportsman, I take leave to differ
  with him _in toto_. By nursing one's horse, I conclude he meant riding him at
  less than half-speed during that critical ten minutes when hounds run their
  very hardest and straightest. If we follow this cautious advice, who is to
  solve the important question, "Which way are they gone?" when we canter
  anxiously up to a sign-post where four roads meet, with a fresh and eager
  horse indeed, but not the wildest notion towards which point of the compass
  we should direct his energies? We can but stop to listen, take counsel of a
  countryman who unwittingly puts us wrong, ride to points, speculate on
  chances, and make up our minds never to be really on terms with them
  again!</p>

  <p>No, I think on the contrary, the best and most experienced riders adopt a
  very different system. On the earliest intimation that hounds are "away,"
  they may be observed getting after them with all the speed they can make. Who
  ever saw Mr. Portman, for instance, trotting across the first field when his
  bitches were well out of covert settling on the line of their fox?&mdash;and
  I only mention his name because it occurs to me at the moment, and because,
  notwithstanding the formidable hills of his wild country and the pace of his
  flying pack, he is always present at the finish, to render them assistance if
  required, as it often must be, with a sinking fox.</p>

  <p>"The first blow is half the battle" in many nobler struggles than a
  street-brawl with a cad, and the very speed at which you send your horse
  along for a few furlongs, if the ground is at all favourable, enables you to
  give him a pull at the earliest opportunity, without fear lest the whole
  distant panorama of the hunt should fade into space while you are considering
  what to do next.</p>

  <p>Not that I mean you to over-mark, or push him for a single stride, beyond
  the collected pace at which he travels with ease and comfort to himself; for
  remember he is as much your partner as the fairest young lady ever trusted to
  your guidance in a ball-room: but I _do_ mean that you should make as much
  haste as is compatible with your mutual enjoyment, and, reflecting on the
  capricious nature of scent, take the chance of its failure, to afford you a
  moment's breathing-time when most required.</p>

  <p>At all periods of a fox-chase, be careful to _anticipate a check_. Never
  with more foresight than when flying along in the ecstasy of a quick thing,
  on a brilliant hunter. Keep an eye forward, and scan with close attention
  every moving object in front. There you observe a flock of sheep getting into
  line like cavalry for a charge&mdash;that is where the fox has gone. Or
  perhaps a man is ploughing half-a-mile further on; in all probability this
  object will have headed him, and on the discretion with which you ride at
  these critical moments may depend the performance of the pack, the difference
  between "a beautiful turn" and "an unlucky check." The very rush of your
  gallop alongside them will tempt high-mettled hounds into the indiscretion of
  over-running their scent. Whereas, if you take a pull at your horse, and give
  them plenty of room, they will swing to the line, and wheel like a flock of
  pigeons on the wing.</p>

  <p>Always ride, then, to _command_ hounds if you can, but never be tempted,
  when in this proud position, to press them, and to spoil your own sport, with
  that of every one else.</p>

  <p>If so fortunate as to view him, and near enough to distinguish that it is
  the hunted fox, think twice before you holloa. More time will be lost than
  gained by getting their heads up, if the hounds are still on the line, and
  even when at fault, it is questionable whether they do not derive less
  assistance than excitement from the human voice. Much depends on
  circumstances, much on the nature of the pack. I will not say you are never
  to open your mouth, but I think that if the inmates of our deaf and dumb
  asylums kept hounds, these would show sport above the average, and would
  seldom go home without blood. Noise is by no means a necessary concomitant of
  the chase, and a hat held up, or a quiet whisper to the huntsman, is of more
  help to him than the loudest and clearest view-holloa that ever wakened the
  dead "from the lungs of John Peel in the morning."</p>

  <p>We have hitherto supposed that you are riding a good horse, in a good
  place, and have been so fortunate as to meet with none of those reverses that
  are nevertheless to be expected on occasion, particularly when hounds run
  hard and the ground is deep. The best of hunters may fall, the boldest of
  riders be defeated by an impracticable fence. Hills, bogs, a precipitous
  ravine, or even an unlucky turn in a wood may place you at a mile's
  disadvantage, almost before you have realised your mistake, and you long for
  the wings of an eagle, while cursing the impossibility of taking back so much
  as a single minute from the past. It seems so easy to ride a run when it is
  over!</p>

  <p>But do not therefore despair. Pull yourself well together, no less than
  your horse. Keep steadily on at a regulated pace, watching the movements of
  those who are with the hounds, and ride inside them, every bend. No fox goes
  perfectly straight&mdash;he must turn sooner or later&mdash;and when the
  happy moment arrives be ready to back your luck, and _pounce_! But here,
  again, I would have your valour tempered with discretion. If your horse does
  not see the hounds, be careful how you ride him at such large places as he
  would face freely enough in the excitement of their company. Not one hunter
  in fifty is really fond of jumping, and we hardly give them sufficient credit
  for the good-humour with which they accept it as a necessity for enjoyment of
  the sport. Avoid water especially, unless you have reason to believe the
  bottom is good, and you can go in and out. Even under such favourable
  conditions, look well to your egress. There is never much difficulty about
  the entrance, and do not forget that the middle is often the shallowest, and
  always the soundest part of a brook. When tempted therefore to take a horse,
  that you know is a bad water-jumper, at this serious obstacle; you are most
  likely to succeed, if you only ask him to jump half-way. Should he drop his
  hind-legs under the farther bank, he will probably not obtain foothold to
  extricate himself, particularly with your weight on his back.</p>

  <p>We are all panic-stricken, and with reason, at the idea of being
  submerged, but we might wade through many more brooks than we usually
  suppose. I can remember seeing the Rowsham, generally believed to be
  bottomless, forded in perfect safety by half-a-dozen of the finest and
  heaviest bullocks the Vale of Aylesbury ever fattened into beef. This, too,
  close to a hunting-bridge, put there by Baron Rothschild because of the depth
  and treacherous nature of the stream!</p>

  <p>A hard road, however, though to be avoided religiously when enjoying a
  good place with hounds, is an invaluable ally on these occasions of
  discomfiture and vexation, if it leads in the same direction as the line of
  chase. On its firm, unyielding surface your horse is regaining his wind with
  every stride. Should a turnpike-gate bar your progress, chuck the honest
  fellow a shilling who swings it back and never mind the change. We hunt on
  sufferance; for our own sakes we cannot make the amusement too popular with
  the lower classes. The same argument holds good as to feeing a countryman who
  assists you in any way when you have a red coat on your back. Reward him with
  an open hand. He will go to the public-house and drink "fox-hunting" amongst
  his friends. It is impossible to say how many innocent cubs are preserved by
  such judicious liberality to die what Charles Payne calls "a natural
  death."</p>

  <p>And now your quiet perseverance meets its reward. You regain your place
  with the hounds and are surprised to find how easily and temperately your
  horse, not yet exhausted, covers large flying fences in his stride. A
  half-beaten hunter, as I have already observed, will "lob over" high and wide
  places if they can be done in a single effort, although instinct causes him
  to "cut them very fine," and forbids unnecessary exertion; but it is "the
  beginning of the end," and you must not presume on his game, enduring
  qualities too long.</p>

  <p>The object of your pursuit, however, is also mortal. By the time you have
  tired an honest horse in good condition the fox is driven to his last
  resources, and even the hounds are less full of fire than when they brought
  him away from the covert. I am supposing, of course, that they have not
  changed during the run. You may now save many a furlong by bringing your
  common sense into play. What would you do if you were a beaten fox, and where
  would you go? Certainly not across the middle of those large pastures where
  you could be seen by the whole troop of your enemies without a chance of
  shelter or repose. No; you would rather lie down in this deep, overgrown
  ditch, sneak along the back of that strong, thick bullfinch, turn short in
  the high, double hedgerow, and so hiding yourself from the spiteful crows
  that would point you out to the huntsman, try to baffle alike his experienced
  intelligence and the natural sagacity of his hounds. Such are but the
  simplest of the wiles practised by this most cunning beast of chase. While
  observing them, you need no further distress the favourite who has carried
  you so well than is necessary to render the assistance required for finishing
  satisfactorily with blood; and here your eyes and ears will be far more
  useful than the speed and stamina of your horse.</p>

  <p>Who-whoop! His labours are now over for the day. Do not keep him standing
  half-an-hour in the cold, while you smoke a cigar and enlarge to sympathising
  ears on his doings, and yours, and theirs, and those of everybody concerned.
  Rather jog gently off as soon as a few compliments and congratulations have
  been exchanged, and keep him moving at the rate of about six miles an hour,
  so that his muscles may not begin to stiffen after his violent exertions,
  till you have got him home. Jump off his honest back, to walk up and down the
  hills with him as they come. He well deserves this courtesy at your hands. If
  you ever go out shooting you cannot have forgotten the relief it is to put
  down your gun for a minute or two. And even from a selfish point of view,
  there is good reason for this forbearance in the ease your own frame
  experiences with the change of attitude and exercise. If you can get him a
  mouthful of gruel, it will recruit his exhausted vitality, as a basin of soup
  puts life into a fainting man; but do not tarry more than five or six minutes
  for your own luncheon, while he is sucking it in, and the more tired he
  seems, remember, the sooner you ought to get him home.</p>

  <p>If he fails altogether, does not attempt to trot, and wavers from side to
  side under your weight, put him into the first available shelter, and make up
  your mind, however mean the quarters, it is better for him to stay there all
  night than in his exhausted condition to be forced back to his own stable.
  With thorough ventilation and plenty of coverings, old sacks, blankets,
  whatever you can lay hands on, he will take no harm. Indeed, if you can keep
  up his circulation there is no better restorative than the pure cold air that
  in a cow-shed, or out-house, finds free admission, to fill his lungs.</p>

  <p>You will lose your dinner perhaps. What matter? You may even have to sleep
  out in "the worst inn's worst room," unfed, unwashed, and without a change of
  clothes. It is no such penance after all, and surely your first duty is to
  the gallant generous animal that would never fail _you_ at your need, but
  would gallop till his heart broke, for your mere amusement and caprice.</p>

  <p>Of all our relations with the dumb creation, there is none in which man
  has so entirely the best of it as the one-sided partnership that exists
  between the horse and his rider.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; RIDING _AT_ STAG-HOUNDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">I have purposely altered the preposition at the heading of
  this, because it treats of a method so entirely different from that which I
  have tried to describe in the preceding chapter. At the risk of rousing
  animadversion from an experienced and scientific majority, I am prepared to
  affirm that there is nearly as much intelligence and knowledge of the animal
  required to hunt a deer as a fox, but in following the chase of the larger
  and higher-scented quadruped there are no fixed rules to guide a rider in his
  course, so that if he allows the hounds to get out of sight he may gallop
  over any extent of country till dark, and never hear tidings of them again.
  Therefore it has been said, one should ride _to_ fox-hounds, but _at_
  stag-hounds, meaning that with the latter, skill and science are of little
  avail to retrieve a mistake.</p>

  <p>Deer, both wild and tame, so long as they are fresh, seem perfectly
  indifferent whether they run up wind or down, although when exhausted they
  turn their heads to the cold air that serves to breathe new life into their
  nostrils. Perhaps, if anything, they prefer to feel the breeze blowing
  against their sides, but as to this there is no more certainty than in their
  choice of ground. Other wild animals go to the hill; deer will constantly
  leave it for the vale. I have seen them fly, straight as an arrow, across a
  strongly enclosed country, and circle like hares on an open down. Sometimes
  they will not run a yard till the hounds are at their very haunches;
  sometimes, when closely pressed, they become stupid with fear, or turn
  fiercely at bay. "Have we got a good deer to-day?" is a question usually
  answered with the utmost confidence, yet how often the result is
  disappointment and disgust. Nor is this the case only in that phase of the
  sport which may be termed artificial. A wild stag proudly carrying his "brow,
  bay, and tray" over Exmoor seems no less capricious than an astonished hind,
  enlarged amongst the brickfields of Hounslow, or the rich pastures that lie
  outstretched below Harrow-on-the-Hill. One creature, familiar with every inch
  of its native wastes, will often wander aimlessly in a circle before making
  its point; the other, not knowing the least where it is bound, will as often
  run perfectly straight for miles.</p>

  <p>My own experience of "the calf," as it has been ignominiously termed, is
  limited to three packs&mdash;Mr. Bissett's, who hunts the perfectly wild
  animal over the moorlands of Somerset and North Devon; Baron Rothschild's, in
  the Vale of Aylesbury; and Lord Wolverton's blood-hounds, amongst the combes
  of Dorsetshire and "doubles" of the Blackmoor Vale. With her Majesty's hounds
  I have not been out more than three or four times in my life.</p>

  <p>Let us take the noble chase of the West country first, as it is followed
  in glorious autumn weather through the fairest scenes that ever haunted a
  painter's dream; in Horner woods and Cloutsham Ball, over the grassy slopes
  of Exmoor, and across the broad expanse of Brendon, spreading its rich mantle
  of purple under skies of gold. We could dwell for pages on the associations
  connected with such classical names as Badgeworthy-water, New-Invention,
  Mountsey Gate, or wooded Glenthorne, rearing its garlanded brows above the
  Severn sea. But we are now concerned in the practical question, how to keep a
  place with Mr. Bissett's six-and-twenty-inch hounds running a "warrantable
  deer" over the finest scenting country in the world?</p>

  <p>You may ride _at_ them as like a tailor as you please. The ups and downs
  of a Devonshire _coombe_ will soon put you in your right place, and you will
  be grateful for the most trifling hint that helps you to spare your horse,
  and remain on any kind of terms with them, on ground no less trying to his
  temper and intelligence than to his wind and muscular powers.</p>

  <p>Till you attempt to gallop alongside you will hardly believe how hard the
  hounds are running. They neither carry such a head, nor dash so eagerly, I
  might almost say _jealously_, for the scent as if they were hunting their
  natural quarry, the fox. This difference I attribute to the larger size, and
  consequently stronger odour, of a deer. Every hound enjoying his full share,
  none are tempted to rob their comrades of the mysterious pleasure, and we
  therefore miss the quick, sharp turns and the _drive_ that we are accustomed
  to consider so characteristic of the fox-hound. They string, too, in
  long-drawn line, because of the tall, bushy heather, necessitating great size
  and power, through which they must make their way; but, nevertheless, they
  keep swinging steadily on, without a check or hover for many a mile of
  moorland, showing something of that fierce indomitable perseverance
  attributed by Byron to the wolf&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"With his long gallop that can tire<br>
  The hound's deep hate and hunter's fire."</p>

  <p>If you had a second Eclipse under you, and rode him fairly with them, yard
  for yard, you would stop him in less than twenty minutes!</p>

  <p>Yet old practitioners, notably that prince of sportsmen the Rev. John
  Russell, contrive to see runs of many hours' duration without so entirely
  exhausting their horses but that they can travel some twenty miles home
  across the moor. Such men as Mr. Granville Somerset, the late Mr. Dene of
  Barnstaple, Mr. Bissett himself, though weighing twenty stone, and a score of
  others&mdash;for in the West good sportsmen are the rule, not the
  exception&mdash;go well from find to finish of these long, exhausting chases,
  yet never trespass too far on the generosity and endurance of the noble
  animal that carries them to the end. And why? Because they take pains, use
  their heads sagaciously, their hands skilfully, and their heels scarcely at
  all. To their experience I am indebted for the following little hints which I
  have found serviceable when embarked on those wide, trackless wastes, brown,
  endless, undulating, and spacious as the sea.</p>

  <p>There are happily no fences, and the chief obstructions to be defeated, or
  rather _negotiated_, are the "combes"&mdash;a succession of valleys that
  trend upward from the shallow streams to the heathery ridges, narrowing as
  they ascend till lost in the level surface of the moor. Never go down into
  these until your deer is sinking. So surely as you descend will you have to
  climb the opposite rise; rather keep round them towards the top, watching the
  hounds while they thread a thousand intricacies of rock, heather, and
  scattered copse-wood, so as to meet them when they emerge, which they will
  surely do on the upper level, for it is the nature of their quarry to rise
  the hill aslant, and seek safety, when pressed, in its speed across the
  flat.</p>

  <p>A deer descends these declivities one after another as they come, but it
  is for the refreshment of a bath in their waters below, and instinct prompts
  it to return without delay to higher ground when thus invigorated. Only if
  completely beaten and exhausted, does it become so confused as to attempt
  scaling a rise in a direct line. The run is over then, and you may turn your
  horse's head to the wind, for in a furlong or two the game will falter and
  come down again amongst its pursuers to stand at bay.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Coast your "combes," therefore, judiciously, and spare your horse; so
  shall you cross the heather in thorough enjoyment of the chase till it leads
  you perhaps to the grassy swamps of Exmoor, the most plausible line in the
  world, over which hounds run their hardest&mdash;and now look out!</p>

  <p>If Exmoor were in Leicestershire, it would be called a bog, and cursed
  accordingly, but every country has its own peculiarities, and a North Devon
  sportsman more especially, on a horse whose dam, or even grandam, was bred on
  the moor, seems to flap his way across it with as much confidence as a
  bittern or a curlew. Could I discover how he accomplished this feat I would
  tell you, but I can only advise you to ride his line and follow him yard for
  yard.</p>

  <p>There are certain sound tracks and pathways, no doubt, in which a horse
  does not sink more than fetlock deep, and Mr. Knight, the lord of the soil,
  may be seen, on a large handsome thorough-bred hunter, careering away as
  close to the pack as he used to ride in the Vale of Aylesbury, but for a
  stranger so to presume would be madness, and if he did not find himself
  bogged in half a minute, he would stop his horse in half a mile.</p>

  <p>Choose a pilot then, Mr. Granville Somerset we will say, or one of the
  gentlemen I have already named, and stick to him religiously till the welcome
  heather is brushing your stirrup-irons once more. On Brendon, you may ride
  for yourself with perfect confidence in the face of all beholders, bold and
  conspicuous as Dunkery Beacon, but on Exmoor you need not be ashamed to play
  follow my leader. Only give him room enough to fall!</p>

  <p>As, although a full-grown or warrantable stag is quickly found, the
  process of separating it from its companions, called "tufting," is a long
  business, lasting for hours, you will be wise to take with you a feed of corn
  and a rope halter, the latter of which greatly assists in serving your horse
  with the former. You will find it also a good plan to have your saddles
  previously well stuffed and repaired, lined with smooth linen. The weather in
  August is very hot, and your horse will be many hours under your weight,
  therefore it is well to guard against a sore back. Jump off, too, whenever
  you have the chance; a hunter cannot but find it a delightful relief to get
  rid of twelve or thirteen stone bumping all day against his spine for a
  minute or two at a time. I have remarked, however, with some astonishment
  that the heavier the rider the more averse he seems to granting this
  indulgence, and am forced to suppose his unwillingness to get down proceeds,
  as my friend Mr. Grimston says, from a difficulty in getting up again! This
  gentleman, however, who, notwithstanding his great weight, has always ridden
  perfectly straight to hounds, over the stiffest of grass countries,
  obstinately declines to leave the saddle at any time under less provocation
  than a complete turn over by the strength of a gate or stile.</p>

  <p>To mention "the Honourable Robert" brings one by an irresistible
  association of ideas into the wide pastures of that grassy paradise which
  mortals call the Vale of Aylesbury. Here, under the excellent management of
  Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, assisted by his brother Mr. Leopold, the _carted_
  deer is hunted on the most favourable terms, and a sportsman must indeed be
  prejudiced who will not admit that "ten mile points" over grass with one of
  the handsomest packs of hounds in the world, are most enjoyable; the object
  of chase, when the fun is over, returning to Mentmore, like a gentleman, in
  his own carriage, notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>Fred Cox is the picture of a huntsman. Mark Howcott, his whip, fears
  nothing in the shape of a fence, and will close with a wicked stag, in or out
  of water, as readily as a policeman collars a pickpocket! The horses are
  superb, and so they ought to be, for the fences that divide this grazing
  district into fields of eighty and a hundred acres grow to the most
  formidable size and strength. Unless brilliantly mounted neither masters nor
  servants could hold the commanding position through a run that they always
  seem to desire.</p>

  <p>In riding to these hounds, as to all others, it is advisable to avoid the
  crowd. Many of the hedgerows are double, with a ditch on each side, and to
  wait for your turn amongst a hundred horsemen, some too bold, some too
  cautious, would entail such delay as must prove fatal with a good scent.
  Happily, there are plenty of gates, and a deer preferring timber to any other
  leap, usually selects this convenient mode of transit. Should they be
  chained, look for a weak place in the fence, which, being double, will admit
  of subdividing your leap by two, and your chance of a fall by ten.</p>

  <p>At first you may be somewhat puzzled on entering a field to find your way
  out. I will suppose that in other countries you have been accustomed to
  select the easiest place at once in the fence you are approaching, and to
  make for it without delay, but across these large fields the nature of an
  obstacle deceives your eye. The two contiguous hedges that form one boundary
  render it very difficult to determine at a distance where the easiest place
  _is_, so you will find it best to follow the hounds, and take your chance.
  The deer, like your horse, is a large quadruped, and, except under unusual
  circumstances, where one goes the other can probably follow.</p>

  <p>This, I fear, is a sad temptation to ride on the line of hounds. If you
  give way to it, let the whole pack be at least two or three hundred yards in
  front, and beware, even then, of tail hounds coming up to join their
  comrades.</p>

  <p>Be careful also, never to jump a fence in your stride, till you see the
  pack well into the next field. A deer is very apt to drop lightly over a wall
  or upright hedge just high enough to conceal it, and then turn short at a
  right angle under this convenient screen. It would be painful to realise your
  feelings, poised in air over eight or ten couple of priceless hounds, with a
  chorus of remonstrances storming in the rear! It is no use protesting you
  "Didn't touch them," you "Didn't mean it," you "Never knew they were there."
  Better ride doggedly on, over the largest places you can find, and apologise
  humbly to everybody at the first check.</p>

  <p>When a fox goes down to water he means crossing, not so the deer. If at
  all tired, or heated, it may stay there for an hour. On such occasions,
  therefore, you can take a pull at your horse and your flask too if you like,
  while you look for the best way to the other side. When induced to leave it,
  however, the animal seems usually so refreshed by its bath, as to travel a
  long distance, and on this, as on many other occasions in stag-hunting, the
  run seems only beginning, when you and your horse consider it ought to be
  nearly over.</p>

  <p>Directly you observe a deer, that has hitherto gone straight, describing a
  series of circles, you may think about going home.</p>

  <p>It is tired at last, and will give you no more fun for a month. You should
  offer assistance to the men, and, even if it be not accepted, remain, as a
  matter of courtesy, to see your quarry properly taken, and sent back to the
  paddock in its cart.</p>

  <p>With all stag-hounds, the same rules would seem to apply. Never care to
  view it, and above all, unless expressly requested to do so for a reason,
  avoid the solecism of "riding the deer." On the mode in which this sport is
  conducted depends the whole difference between a wild exhilarating pastime
  and a tame uninteresting parade. Though prejudice will not allow it is the
  _real_ thing, we cannot but admit the excellence of the imitation, and a man
  must possess a more logical mind, a less excitable temperament, than is
  usually allotted to sportsmen, who can remember, while sailing along with
  hounds running hard over a flying country, that he is only "trying to catch
  what he had already," and has turned a handsome hairy-coated quadruped out of
  a box for the mere purpose of putting it in again when the fun is over!</p>

  <p>Follow every turn then, religiously, and with good intent. You came out
  expressly to enjoy a gallop, do not allow yourself to be disappointed. If
  nerve and horse are good enough, go into every field with them, but, I
  intreat you, ride like a sportsman, and give the hounds plenty of room.</p>

  <p>This last injunction more especially applies to that handsome pack of
  black-and-tans with which Lord Wolverton, during the last five or six
  seasons, has shown extraordinary sport for the amusement of his neighbours on
  the uplands of Dorset and in the green pastures that enrich the valley of the
  Stour. These blood-hounds, for such they are, and of the purest breed, stand
  seven or eight-and-twenty inches, with limbs and frames proportioned to so
  gigantic a stature. Their heads are magnificent, solemn sagacious eyes,
  pendent jowls, and flapping ears that brush away the dew. Thanks to his
  Lordship's care in breeding, and the freedom with which he has drafted, their
  feet are round and their powerful legs symmetrically straight. A spirited and
  truly artistic picture of these hounds in chase, sweeping like a whirlwind
  over the downs, by Mr. Goddard, the well-known painter, hangs on Lord
  Wolverton's staircase in London, and conveys to his guests, particularly
  after dinner, so vivid an idea of their picturesque and even sporting
  qualities as I cannot hope to represent with humble pen and ink.</p>

  <p>One could almost fancy, standing opposite this masterpiece, that one heard
  _the cry_. Full, sonorous, and musical, it is not extravagant to compare
  these deep-mouthed notes with the peal of an organ in a cathedral.</p>

  <p>Yet they run a tremendous pace. Stride, courage, and _condition_ (the last
  essential requiring constant care) enable them to sustain such speed over the
  open as can make a good horse look foolish! While, amongst enclosures, they
  charge the fences in line, like a squadron of heavy dragoons.</p>

  <p>Yet for all this fire and mettle in chase, they are sad cowards under
  pressure from a crowd. A whip cracked hurriedly, a horse galloping in their
  track, even an injudicious _rate_, will make the best of them shy and sulky
  for half the day. Only by thorough knowledge of his favourites, and patient
  deference to their prejudices, has Lord Wolverton obtained their confidence,
  and it is wonderful to mark how his perseverance is rewarded. While he hunts
  them they are perfectly handy, and turn like a pack of harriers; but if an
  outsider attempts to "cap them on," or otherwise interfere, they decline to
  acknowledge him from the first; and should they be left to his guidance, are
  quite capable of going straight home at once, with every mark of
  contempt.</p>

  <p>In a run, however, their huntsman is seldom wanting. His lordship has an
  extraordinary knack of _galloping_, getting across a field with surprising
  quickness on every horse he rides, and is not to be turned by the fence when
  he reaches it, so that his hounds are rarely placed in the awkward position
  of a pack at fault with no one to look to for assistance. He has acquired,
  too, considerable familiarity with the habits of his game, and has a holy
  horror of going home without it, so perseveres, when at a loss, through many
  a long hour of cold hunting, slotting, scouring the country for information,
  and other drawbacks to enjoyment of his chase. As he says himself, "The worst
  of a deer is, you can't leave off when you like. Nobody will believe you if
  you swear it went to ground!"</p>

  <p>Part of the country in his immediate neighbourhood seems made for
  stag-hunting. Large fields, easy slopes, light fences, and light land, with
  here and there a hazel copse, bordering a stretch for three or four miles of
  level turf, like Launceston Down, or Blandford race-course, must needs tempt
  a deer to go straight no less than a horseman, but the animal, as I have
  said, is unaccountably capricious, and if we could search his lordship's
  diary I believe we should find his best runs have taken place over a district
  differing in every respect from the above.</p>

  <p>As soon as the leaves are fallen sufficiently to render the Blackmoor Vale
  rideable, it is his greatest pleasure to take the blood-hounds down to those
  deep, level, and strongly-enclosed pastures, over which, notwithstanding the
  size and nature of the fences, he finds his deer (usually hinds) run
  remarkably well, and make extraordinary points. Ten miles, on the ordnance
  map, is no unusual distance, and is often accomplished in little more than an
  hour. For men who enjoy _riding_ I can conceive no better fun. Not an acre of
  plough is to be seen. The enclosures, perhaps, are rather small, but this
  only necessitates more jumping, and the fences may well satisfy the
  hungriest, or as an Irishman would say, the _thirstiest_, of competitors!
  They are not, however, _quite_ so formidable as they look. To accomplish two
  blind ditches, with a bank between, and a hedge thereon, requires indeed
  discretion in a horse, and cool determination in its rider, but where these
  exist the large leap is divided easily by two, and a good man, who _means
  going_, is not often to be _pounded_, even in the Blackmoor Vale.</p>

  <p>Nothing is _quite_ perfect under the sun, not your own best hunter, nor
  your wife's last baby, and the river Stour, winding through them in every
  direction, somewhat detracts from the merit of these happiest of
  hunting-grounds. A good friend to the deer, and a sad hindrance to its
  pursuers, it has spoilt many a fine run; but even with this drawback there
  are few districts in any part of England so naturally adapted to the
  pleasures of the chase. The population is scanty, the countrymen are
  enthusiasts, the farmers the best fellows on earth, the climate seems
  unusually favourable; from the kindness and courtesy of Sir Richard Glynn and
  Mr. Portman, who pursue the _legitimate_ sport over the same locality, and
  his own personal popularity, the normal difficulties of his undertaking are
  got over in favour of the noble master, and everybody seems equally pleased
  to welcome the green plush coats and the good grey horses in the midst of the
  black-and-tans.</p>

  <p>If I were sure of a fine morning and a _safe mount_, I would ask for no
  keener pleasure than an hour's gallop with Lord Wolverton's blood-hounds over
  the Blackmoor Vale.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; THE PROVINCES.</h2>

  <p class="first">A distinguished soldier of the present day, formerly as
  daring and enthusiastic a rider as ever charged his "oxers" with the
  certainty of a fall, was once asked in my hearing by a mild stranger,
  "Whether he had been out with the Crawley and Horsham?" if I remember
  right.</p>

  <p>"No, sir!" was the answer, delivered in a tone that somewhat startled the
  querist, "I have never hunted with any hounds in my life but the Quorn and
  the Pytchley, and I'll take d&mdash;d good care I never do!"</p>

  <p>Now I fancy that not a few of our "golden youth," who are either born to
  it, or have contrived in their own way to get the "silver spoon" into their
  mouths, are under the impression that all hunting must necessarily be dead
  slow if conducted out of Leicestershire, and that little sport, with less
  excitement, is to be obtained in those remote regions which they
  contemptuously term the provinces.</p>

  <p>There never was a greater fallacy. If we calculate the number of hours
  hounds are out of kennel (for we must remember that the Quorn and Belvoir put
  two days into one), we shall find, I think, that they run hard for fewer
  minutes, in proportion, across the fashionable countries than in apparently
  less-favoured districts concealed at sundry out-of-the-way corners of the
  kingdom.</p>

  <p>Nor is this disparity difficult to understand. Fox-hunting at its best is
  a wild sport; the wilder the better. Where coverts are many miles apart,
  where the animal must travel for its food, where agriculture is conducted on
  primitive principles that do not necessitate the huntsman's horror, "a man in
  every field," the fox retains all his savage nature, and is prepared to run
  any distance, face every obstacle, rather than succumb to his relentless
  enemy, the hound. He has need, and he seems to know it, of all his courage
  and all his sagacity, as compelled to fight alone on his own behalf, without
  assistance from that invaluable ally, the crowd.</p>

  <p>A score of hard riders, nineteen of whom are jealous, and the twentieth
  determined not to be beat, forced on by a hundred comrades all eager for the
  view and its stentorian proclamation, may well save the life of any fox on
  earth, with scarce an effort from the animal itself. But that hounds are
  creatures of habit, and huntsmen in the flying countries miracles of
  patience, no less than their masters, not a nose would be nailed on the
  kennel-door, after cub-hunting was over, from one end of the shires to the
  other.</p>

  <p>Nothing surprises me so much as to see a pack of hounds, like the Belvoir
  or the Quorn, come up _through_ a crowd of horses and stick to the line of
  their fox, or fling gallantly forward to recover it, without a thought of
  personal danger or the slightest misgiving that not one man in ten is master
  of the two pair of hoofs beneath him, carrying death in every shoe. Were they
  not bred for the make-and-shape that gives them speed no less than for
  fineness of nose, but especially for that _dash_ which, like all victorious
  qualities, leaves something to chance, they could never get a field from the
  covert. It does happen, however, that, now and again, a favourable stroke of
  fortune puts a couple of furlongs between the hounds and their pursuers. A
  hundred-acre field of well saturated grass lies before them, down go their
  noses, out go their sterns, and away they scour, at a pace which makes a
  precious example of young Rapid on a first-class steeple-chase horse with the
  wrong bridle in its mouth.</p>

  <p>But how differently is the same sport being carried out in his father's
  country, perhaps by the old gentleman's own pack, with which the young one
  considers it slow to hunt.</p>

  <p>Let us begin at the beginning and try to imagine a good day in the
  provinces, about the third week in November, when leaves are thin and
  threadbare on the fences, while copse and woodland glisten under subdued
  shafts of sunlight in sheets of yellow gold.</p>

  <p>What says Mr. Warburton, favoured of Diana and the Muses?</p>

  <p class="verse">"The dew-drop is clinging<br>
  To whin-bush and brake,<br>
  The sky-lark is singing,<br>
  Merry hunters, awake!<br>
  Home to the cover,<br>
  Deserted by night,<br>
  The little red rover<br>
  Is bending his flight&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Could words more stirringly describe the hope and promise, the joy, the
  vitality, the buoyant exhilaration of a hunting morning?</p>

  <p>So the little red rover, who has travelled half-a-dozen miles for his
  supper, returns to find he has "forgotten his latch-key," and curls himself
  up in some dry, warm nook amongst the brushwood, at the quietest corner of a
  deep, precipitous ravine.</p>

  <p>Here, while sleep favours digestion, he makes himself very comfortable,
  and dreams, no doubt, of his own pleasures and successes in pursuit of prey.
  Presently, about half-past eleven, he wakes with a start, leaps out of bed,
  shakes his fur, and stands to listen, a perfect picture, with one pad raised
  and his cunning head aslant. Yes, he recognized it from the first. The "Yooi,
  wind him, and rouse him!" of old Matthew's mellow tones, not unknown in a
  gin-and-water chorus when occasion warrants the convivial brew, yet clear,
  healthy, and resonant as the very roar of Challenger, who has just proclaimed
  his consciousness of the drag, some five hours old.</p>

  <p>'Tis an experienced rover, and does not hesitate for an instant. Stealing
  down the ravine, he twists his agile little body through a tangled growth of
  blackthorn and brambles, crosses the stream dry-footed with a leap, and,
  creeping through the fence that bounds his stronghold, peers into the meadow
  beyond. No smart and busy whip has "clapped forward" to view and head him.
  Matthew, indeed, brings out but one, and swears he could do better without
  _him_. So the rover puts his sharp nose straight for the solitude he loves,
  and whisking his brush defiantly, resolves to make his point.</p>

  <p>He has been gone five minutes when the clamour of the find reaches his
  ears, twice that time ere the hounds are fairly out of covert on his line;
  so, with a clear head and a bold heart, he has leisure to consider his
  tactics and to remember the main earth at Crag's-end in the forest, twelve
  miles off as the crow flies.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"Come up horse!"</p>
  </div>

  <p>Challenger, and Charmer his progeny, crash out of the wood together,
  fairly howling with ecstasy as their busy noses meet the rich tufted herbage,
  dewy, dank, and tainted with the maddening odour that affords such
  uncontrolled enjoyment. "_Harve art_ him, my _lards_!" exclaims old Matthew,
  in Doric accents, peculiar to the kennel. "Come up, horse!" and, having
  admonished that faithful servant with a dig in the ribs from his horn, blows
  half-a-dozen shrill blasts in quick succession, sticks the instrument, I
  shudder to confess it, in his boot, and proceeds to hustle his old white nag
  at the best pace he can command in the wake of his favourites. "Dang it!
  they're off," exclaims a farmer, who had stationed himself on the crest of
  the hill, diving, at a gallop, down a stony darkling lane, overgrown with
  alder, brambles, honeysuckle, all the garden produce of uncultivated nature,
  lush and steaming in decay. The field, consisting of the Squire, three or
  four strapping yeomen, a parson, and a boy on a pony, follow his example, and
  making a good turn in the valley, find themselves splashing through a
  glittering, shallow streamlet, still in the lane, with the hounds not a
  bowshot from them on the right.</p>

  <p>"And pace?" inquires young Rapid, when his father describes the run to him
  on Christmas-eve. "Of course you had no pace with so good a point?"</p>

  <p>"Pace, sir!" answers the indignant parent; "my hounds _run_ because they
  can _hunt_. I tell you, they were never off the line for an hour and
  three-quarters! Matthew _would_ try to cast them once, and very nearly lost
  his fox, but Charmer hit it off on the other side of the combe and put us
  right. He's as like old Challenger as he can stick; a deal more like than
  _you_ are to _me_."</p>

  <p>Young Rapid concedes the point readily, and the Squire continues his
  narrative: "I had but eighteen couple out, because of a run the week
  before&mdash;I'll tell you about it presently,&mdash;five-and-thirty minutes
  on the hills, and a kill in the open, that lamed half the pack amongst the
  flints. You talk of pace&mdash;they went fast enough to have settled the best
  of you, I'll warrant! but I'm getting off the line&mdash;I've not done with
  the other yet. I never saw hounds work better. They came away all together,
  they hunted their fox like a cluster of bees; swarming over every field, and
  every fence, they brought him across Tinglebury Tor, where it's always as dry
  as that hearth-stone, through a flock of five hundred sheep, they rattled him
  in and out of Combe-Bampton, though the Lower Woods were alive with
  riot&mdash;hares, roe, fallow-deer, hang it! apes and peacocks if you like;
  had old Matthew not been a fool they would never have hesitated for a moment,
  and when they ran into him under Crag's-end, there wasn't a man-jack of them
  missing. Not one&mdash;that's what I call a pack of hounds!</p>

  <p>"The best part of it? So much depends on whether you young fellows go out
  to hunt, or to ride. For the first half-hour or so we were never off the
  grass&mdash;there's not a ploughed field all the way up the valley till you
  come to Shifner's allotments, orchard and meadow, meadow and orchard,
  fetlock-deep in grass, even at this time of year. Why, it carries a
  side-scent, like the heather on a moor! I suppose you'd have called _that_
  the best part. I didn't, though I saw it _well_ from the lane with Matthew
  and the rest of us, all but the Vicar, who went into every field with the
  hounds&mdash;I thought he was rather hard on them amongst those great blind,
  tangled fences; but he's such a good fellow, I hadn't the heart to holloa at
  him&mdash;it's very wrong though, and a man in his profession ought to know
  better.</p>

  <p>"I can't say they checked exactly in the allotments, but the manure and
  rubbish, weeds burning, and whatnot, brought them to their noses. That's
  where Matthew made such a fool of himself; but, as I told you, Charmer put us
  all right. The fox had crossed into Combe-Bampton and was rising the hill for
  the downs.</p>

  <p>"I never saw hounds so patient&mdash;they could but just hold a line over
  the chalk&mdash;first one and then another puzzled it out, till they got on
  better terms in Hazlewood Hanger, and when they ran down into the valley
  again between the cliffs there was a cry it did one's heart good to hear.</p>

  <p>"I had a view of him, crossing Parker's Piece, the long strip of waste
  land, you know, under Craven Clump; and he seemed as fresh as you are
  now&mdash;I sat as mute as a mouse, for six-and-thirty noses knew better
  where he'd gone than I did, and six-and-thirty-tongues were at work that
  never told a lie. The Vicar gave them plenty of room by this time, and all
  our horses seemed to have had about enough!</p>

  <p>"'I wish we mayn't have changed in the Hanger,' said Matthew, refreshing
  the old grey with a side-binder, as they blundered into the lane, but I knew
  better&mdash;he had run the rides, every yard, and that made me hope we
  should have him in hand before long.</p>

  <p>"It began to get very interesting, I was near enough to watch each hound
  doing his work, eighteen couple, all dogs, three and four season hunters, for
  I hadn't a single puppy out. I wish you had been there, my boy. It was a real
  lesson in hunting, and I'll tell you what I thought of them, one by &mdash;.
  Hulloh! Yes. You'd better ring for coffee&mdash;Hanged if I don't believe
  you've been fast asleep all the time!"</p>

  <p>But such runs as these, though wearisome to a listener, are most enjoyable
  for those who can appreciate the steadiness and sagacity of the hound, no
  less than the craft and courage of the animal it pursues. There is an
  indescribable charm too, in what I may call the _romance_ of
  hunting,&mdash;the remote scenes we should perhaps never visit for their own
  sake, the broken sunlight glinting through copse and gleaming on fern, the
  woodland sights, the woodland sounds, the balmy odours of nature, and all the
  treats she provides for her votaries, tasted and enjoyed, with every faculty
  roused, every sense sharpened in the excitement of our pursuit. These
  delights are better known in the provinces than the shires, and to descend
  from flights of fancy to practical matters of &eacute; _s._ _d._, we can
hunt in the
  former at comparatively trifling expense.</p>

  <p>In the first place, particularly if good horsemen, we need not be nearly
  so well-mounted. There are few provincial countries in which a man who knows
  how to ride, cannot get from one field to another, by hook or by crook, with
  a little creeping and scrambling and blundering, that come far short of the
  casualty we deprecate as "a rattling fall!" His horse must be in good
  condition of course, and able to gallop; also if temperate, the more willing
  at his fences the better, but it is not indispensable that he should possess
  the stride and power necessary to cover some twenty feet of distance, and
  four or five of height, at every leap, nor the blood that can alone enable
  him to repeat the exertion, over and over again, at three-quarter speed in
  deep ground. To jump, as it is called, "from field to field," tries a horse's
  stamina no less severely than his courage, while, as I have already observed,
  there is no such economy of effort, and even danger, as to make two small
  fences out of a large one.</p>

  <p>I do not mean to say that there are any parts of England where, if hounds
  run hard, a hunter, with a workman on his back, has not enough to do to live
  with them, but I do consider that, _caeteris paribus_, a good rider may
  smuggle a moderate horse over most of our provincial countries, whereas he
  would be helpless on the same animal in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire.
  There, on the other hand, an inferior horseman, bold enough to place implicit
  confidence in the first-class hunter he rides, may see a run, from end to
  end, with considerable credit and enjoyment, by the simple process of keeping
  a good hold of his bridle, while he leaves everything to the horse. But he
  must not have learned a single letter of the noble word "Funk." Directly his
  heart fails, and he interferes, down they both come, an _imperial crowner_,
  and the game is lost!</p>

  <p>Many of our provincial districts are also calculated, from their very
  nature, to turn out experienced sportsmen no less than accomplished riders.
  In large woods, amongst secluded hills, or wild tracts of moor intersected by
  impracticable ravines, a lover of the chase is compelled by force of
  circumstances to depend on his own eyes, ears, and general intelligence for
  his amusement.</p>

  <p>He finds no young Rapid to pilot him over the large places, if he _means
  going_; no crafty band of second-horsemen to guide him in safety to the
  finish, if his ambition is satisfied with a distant and occasional view of
  the stirring pageant; no convenient hand-gate in the corner, no friendly
  bridge across the stream; above all, no hurrying cavalcade drawn out for
  miles, amongst which to hide, and with whom pleasantly to compare notes
  hereafter in those self-deceiving moments, when</p>

  <p class="verse">"Dined, o'er our claret, we talk of the merit,<br>
  Of every choice spirit that rode in the run.<br>
  But here the crowd, Sir, can talk just as loud, Sir,<br>
  As those who were forward enjoying the fun!"</p><br>

  <p>No. In the provinces our young sportsman must make up his mind to take his
  own part, to study the coverts drawn, and find out for himself the points
  where he can see, hear, and, so to speak, command hounds till they go away;
  must learn how to rise the hill with least labour, and descend it with
  greatest dispatch, how to thread glen, combe, or dale, wind in and out of the
  rugged ravine, plunge through a morass, and make his way home at night across
  trackless moor, or open storm-swept down. By the time he has acquired these
  accomplishments, the horsemanship will have come of itself. He will know how
  to bore where he cannot jump, to creep where he must not fly, and so manage
  his horse that the animal seems to share the intentions and intelligence of
  its rider.</p>

  <p>If he can afford it, and likes to spend a season or two in the shires for
  the last superlative polish, let him go and welcome! He will be taught to get
  clear of a crowd, to leap timber at short notice, to put on his boots and
  breeches, and that is about all there is left for him to learn!</p>

  <p>In the British army, though more than a hundred regiments constitute the
  line, each cherishes its own particular title, while applying that general
  application indiscriminately to the rest.</p>

  <p>I imagine the same illusion affects the provinces, and I should offend an
  incalculable number of good fellows and good sportsmen, were I to describe as
  _provincial_ establishments, the variety of hunts, north, south, east, and
  west, with which I have enjoyed so much good company and good fun. Each has
  its own claim to distinction, some have collars, all have sport.</p>

  <p>Grass, I imagine, is the one essential that constitutes pre-eminence in a
  hunting country, and for this the shires have always boasted they bear away
  the palm, but it will surprise many of my readers to be told that in the
  south and west there are districts where this desideratum seems now more
  plentiful than in the middle of England. The Blackmoor Vale still lies almost
  wholly under pasture, and you may travel to-day forty miles by rail, through
  the counties of Dorset and Somerset, in general terms nearly from Blandford
  to Bath, without seeing a ploughed field.</p>

  <p>What a country might here be made by such an enthusiast as poor "Sam
  Reynell," who found Meath without a gorse-covert, and drew between thirty and
  forty "sure finds" in it before he died!</p>

  <p>Independently of duty, which ought to be our first consideration, there is
  also great convenience in hunting from home. We require no large stud, can
  choose our meets, and, above all, are indifferent to weather. A horse comes
  out so many times in a season; if we don't hunt to-day we shall next week.
  Compare this equable frame of mind with the irritation and impatience of a
  man who has ten hunters standing at the sign of "The Hand-in-Pocket," while
  he inhabits the front parlour, without his books, deprived of his usual
  society and occupations, the barometer at set fair, and the atmosphere
  affording every indication of a six-weeks' frost!</p>

  <p>Let us see in what the charm consists that impels people to encounter bad
  food, bad wine, bad lodgings, and above all, protracted boredom, for a
  campaign in those historical hunting-grounds, that have always seemed to
  constitute the rosiest illusion of a sportsman's dream.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; THE SHIRES.</h2>

  <p class="verse">"Every species of fence every horse doesn't suit,<br>
  What's a good country hunter may here prove a brute,"</p>

  <p class="first">Sings that clerical bard who wrote the Billesdon-Coplow
  poem, from which I have already quoted; and it would be difficult to explain
  more tersely than do these two lines the difference between a fair useful
  hunter, and the flyer we call _par excellence_ "a Leicestershire horse!"</p>

  <p>Alas! for the favourite unrivalled over Gloucestershire walls, among
  Dorsetshire doubles, in the level ploughs of Holderness, or up and down the
  wild Derbyshire hills, when called upon to gallop, we will say, from Ashby
  pastures to the Coplow, after a week's rain, at Quorn pace, across Quorn
  fences, unless he happens to possess with the speed of a steeple-chaser, the
  courage of a lion and the activity of a cat! For the first mile or two
  "pristinae virtutis haud immemor" he bears him gallantly enough, even the
  unaccustomed rail on the far side of an "oxer," elicits but a startling
  exertion, and a loud rattle of horn and iron against wood, but ere long the
  slope rises against him, the ridge-and-furrow checks his stride, a field,
  dotted with ant-hills as large as church-hassocks and not unlike them in
  shape, to catch his toes and impede his action, changes his smooth easy swing
  to a laborious flounder, and presently at a thick bullfinch on the crest of a
  grassy ridge, out of ground that takes him in nearly to his hocks, comes the
  crisis. Too good a hunter to turn over, he gets his shoulders out and lets
  his rider see the fall before it is administered, but down he goes
  notwithstanding, very effectually, to rise again after a struggle, his eye
  wild, nostril distended, and flanks heaving, thoroughly pumped out!</p>

  <p>He is a good horse, but you have brought him into the wrong country, and
  this is the result.</p>

  <p>It would be a hopeless task to extract from young Rapid's laconic phrases,
  and general indifference, any particulars regarding the burst in which, to
  give him his due, he has gone brilliantly, or the merits of the horse that
  carried him in the first flight without a mistake. He wastes his time, his
  money, his talents, but not his words. For him and his companions, question
  and answer are cut short somewhat in this wise:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Did you get away with them from the Punchbowl?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was among the lucky ones."</p>

  <p>"Is, 'The King of the Golden Mines' any use?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy he is good enough."</p>

  <p>And yet he is reflecting on the merits of Self and Co. with no little
  satisfaction, and does not grudge one shilling of the money&mdash;a hundred
  down, and a bill for two hundred and fifty&mdash;that the horse with the
  magnificent name cost him last spring.</p>

  <p>Their performance, I admit, does them both credit. I will endeavour to
  give a rough sketch of the somewhat hazardous amusement that puts him out of
  conceit with the sport shown by his father's hounds.</p>

  <p>Let us picture to ourselves then, Rapid junior, resplendent in the whitest
  of breeches and brightest of boots, with a single-breasted, square-cut
  scarlet coat, a sleek hat curly of brim, four feet of cane hunting-whip in
  his hand, a flower at his breast, and a toothpick in his mouth, replaced by
  an enormous cigar as somebody he doesn't know suggests they are not likely to
  find. Though he looks so helpless, and more than half-asleep, he is
  wide-awake enough in fact, and dashes the weed unlighted from his lips, when
  he spies the huntsman stand up in his stirrups as though on the watch. There
  lurks a fund of latent energy under the placidity of our friend's demeanour,
  and, as four couple of hounds come streaming out of cover, he shoots up the
  bank rather too near them, to pick his place without hesitation in an ugly
  bullfinch at the top. Two of his own kind are making for the same spot at the
  same moment, and our young friend shows at such a crisis, that he knows how
  to ride. Taking "The King of the Golden Mines," hard by the head, he changes
  his aim on the instant, and rams the good horse at four feet of strong
  timber, leaning towards him, with an energy not to be denied. Over they go
  triumphantly, "The King," half affronted, "catching hold" with some
  resentment, as he settles vigorously to his stride. What matter? most of the
  pack are already half-way across the next field, for Leicestershire hounds
  have an extraordinary knack of flying forward to overtake their comrades. His
  father would be delighted with the performance, and would call it "scoring to
  cry," but young Rapid does not trouble himself about such matters. He is only
  glad to find they are out of his way, and thinks no more about it, except to
  rejoice that he can "put the steam on," without the usual remonstrance from
  huntsman and master.</p>

  <p>The King can gallop like a race-horse, and is soon at the next
  leap&mdash;a wide ditch, a high staked-and-bound hedge, coarse, rough and
  strong, with a drop and what you please, on the other side. This last treat
  proves to be a bowed-out oak-rail, standing four feet from the fence. "The
  King," full of courage, and going fast, bounds over the whole with his hind
  legs tucked under him like a deer, ready, but not requiring, to strike back,
  while two of Rapid's young friends with whom he dined yesterday, and one he
  will meet at dinner to-day, fly it in similar form, nearly alongside. An
  ugly, overgrown bullfinch, with a miniature ravine, or, as it is here called,
  "a bottom," appears at the foot of the hill they are now descending, and, as
  there seems only one practicable place, these four reckless individuals at
  once begin to race for the desirable spot. The King's turn of speed serves
  him again; covering five- or six-and-twenty feet, he leaps it a length in
  front of the nearest horse, and a couple of strides before the other two,
  while loud reproachful outcries resound in the rear because of Harmony's
  narrow escape&mdash;the King's forefoot, missing that priceless bitch by a
  yard!</p>

  <p>Our young gentleman, having got a lead now, begins to ride with more
  judgment. He trots up to a stile and pops over in truly artistic form; better
  still, he gives the hounds plenty of room on the fallow beyond, where they
  have hovered for a moment and put down their noses, holding his hand up to
  warn those behind, a "bit of cheek," as they call this precautionary measure,
  which he will be made to remember for some days to come!</p>

  <p>He is not such a fool but that he knows, from experience in the old
  country, how a little patience at these critical moments makes the whole
  difference between a good day's sport and a bad. It would be provoking to
  lose the chance of a gallop now, when he has got such a start, and is riding
  the best horse in his stable, so he looks anxiously over his shoulder for the
  huntsman, who is "coming," and stands fifty yards aloof, which he considers a
  liberal allowance, that the hounds may have space to swing.</p>

  <p>To-day there is a good scent and a good fox, a combination that happens
  oftener than might be supposed. Harmony, who, notwithstanding her recent
  peril, has never been off the line, though the others over-shot it, scours
  away at a tangent, with the slightest possible whimper, and her stern down,
  the leading hounds wheeling to her like pigeons, and the whole pack driving
  forward again, harder than before.</p>

  <p>It is a beautiful turn; young Rapid would admire it, no doubt, were his
  attention not distracted by the gate out of the field, which is chained up,
  and a hurried calculation as to whether it is too high for the King to
  attempt.</p>

  <p>The solution is obvious. I need hardly say he jumps it gallantly in his
  stride. It would never do, you see, to let those other fellows catch him, and
  he sails away once more with a stronger lead than at first. What a hunting
  panorama opens on his view!&mdash;a downward stretch of a couple of miles,
  and a gentle rise beyond of more than twice that distance, consisting wholly
  of enormous grass fields, dotted here and there with single trees, and
  separated by long lines of fences, showing black and level on that faded
  expanse of green. The smoke from a farm-house rises white and thin against
  the dull sky in the middle distance, and a taper church-spire points to
  heaven from behind the hill, otherwise there is not an object for miles to
  recall everyday life; and young Rapid's world consists at this moment of two
  reeking pointed ears, with a vision of certain dim shapes, fleeting like
  shadows across the open&mdash;swift, dusky, and noiseless as a dream.</p>

  <p>His blood thrills with excitement, from the crown of his close-cropped
  head to his silken-covered heel, but education is stronger than nature, and
  he tightens his lips, perhaps to repress a cheer, while he
  murmurs&mdash;"Over the brook for a hundred! and the King never turned from
  water in his life."</p>

  <p>Two more fences bring him to the level meadow with its willows. Harmony is
  shaking herself on the farther bank, and he has marked with his eye the spot
  where he means to take off. A strong pull, a steady hand, the energy of a
  mile gallop condensed into a dozen strides, and the stream passes beneath him
  like a flash. "It's a _rum_ one!" he murmurs, standing up in his stirrups to
  ease the good horse, while one follower exclaims "Bravo! Rapid. Go along, old
  man!" as the speaker plunges overhead; and another, who lands with a
  scramble, mutters, "D&mdash;n him, I shall never catch him! my horse is done
  to a turn _now_."</p>

  <p>"The King," his owner thinks, is well worth the &eacute;350 that has
_not_ been
  paid. The horse has caught his second wind, and keeps striding on, strong and
  full of running, though temperate enough now, and, in such a country as this,
  a truly delightful mount.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The King of the Golden Mines.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is no denying that our friend is a capital horseman, and bold as
  need be. "The King of the Golden Mines," with a _workman_ on his back, can
  hardly be defeated by any obstacle that the power and spring of a quadruped
  ought to surmount. He has tremendous stride, and no less courage than his
  master, so fence after fence is thrown behind the happy pair with a sensation
  like flying that seems equally gratifying to both. The ground is soft but
  sound enough; the leaps, though large, are fair and clean. One by one they
  are covered in light, elastic bounds, of eighteen or twenty feet, and for a
  mile, at least, the King scarcely alters his action, and never changes his
  leg. Young Rapid would ask no better fun than to go on like this for a
  week.</p>

  <p>Once he has a narrow escape. The fox having turned short up a hedgerow
  after crossing it, the hounds, though running _to kill_, turn _as_ short, for
  which they deserve the praise there is nobody present to bestow, and Rapid,
  charging the fence with considerable freedom, just misses landing in the
  middle of the pack. I know it, because he acknowledged it after dinner,
  professing, at the same time, devout thankfulness that master and huntsman
  were too far off to see. Just such another turn is made at the next fence,
  but this time on the near side. The hounds disappear suddenly, tumbling over
  each other into the ditch like a cascade. Peering between his horse's ears,
  the successful rider can distinguish only a confused whirl of muddy backs,
  and legs, and sterns, seen through a cloud of steam; but smothered growls,
  with a certain vibration of the busy cluster, announce that they have got
  him, and Rapid so far forgets himself as to venture on a feeble
  "Who&mdash;whoop!"</p>

  <p>Before he can leap from the saddle the huntsman comes up followed by two
  others, one of whom, pulling out his watch, with a delighted face repeats
  frantically, "Seven-and-twenty minutes, and a kill in the open! _What_ a good
  gallop! Not the ghost of a check from end to end. Seven-and-twenty minutes,"
  and so on, over and over again.</p>

  <p>While the field straggle in, and the obsequies of this good fox are
  properly celebrated, a little enthusiasm would be justifiable enough on the
  part of a young gentleman who has "had the best of it" unquestionably through
  the whole of so brilliant a scurry. He might be expected to enlarge volubly,
  and with excusable self-consciousness, on the pace, the country, the straight
  running of the fox, the speed and gallantry of the hounds; nor could we blame
  him for praising by implication his own determined riding in a tribute to
  "The King of the Golden Mines."</p>

  <p>But such extravagancies are studiously repudiated and repressed by the
  school to which young Rapid belongs. All he _does_ say is this&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I wonder when the second horses will come up? I want some luncheon before
  we go and find another fox."</p>

  <p>I have already observed that in the shires we put two days into one. Where
  seventy or eighty couple of hounds are kept and thirty horses, to hunt four
  times a week, with plenty of country, in which you may find a fox every five
  minutes, there can be no reason for going home while light serves; and really
  good scenting days occur so rarely that we may well be tempted to make the
  most of one even with jaded servants and a half-tired pack of hounds. The
  field, too, are considerably diminished by three or four o'clock. One has no
  second horse, another must get home to write his letters, and, if within
  distance of Melton, some hurry back to play whist. Everything is comparative.
  With forty or fifty horsemen left, a huntsman breathes more freely, and
  these, who are probably enthusiasts, begin to congratulate themselves that
  the best of the day is yet to come. "Let us go and draw Melton Spinney," is a
  suggestion that brightens every eye; and the Duke will always draw Melton
  Spinney so long as he can see. It is no unusual thing for his hounds to kill,
  and, I have been told, they once _found_ their fox by moonlight, so that it
  is proverbial all over his country, if you only stop out late enough, you are
  sure of a run with the Belvoir at last. And then, whether you belong to the
  school of young Rapid or his father, you will equally have a treat. Are you
  fond of hounds? Here is a pack that cannot be surpassed, to delight the most
  fastidious eye, satisfy the most critical taste. Do you like to see them
  _hunt_? Watch how these put their noses down, tempering energy with patience,
  yet so bustling and resolute as to work a bad scent into a good one. Are you
  an admirer of make-and-shape? Mark this perfect symmetry of form, bigger,
  stronger, and tougher than it looks. Do you understand kennel management and
  condition? Ask Gillard why his hounds are never known to tire, and get from
  him what hints you can.</p>

  <p>Lastly, do you want to gallop and jump, defeat your dearest friends, and
  get to the end of your best horse? That is but a moderate scenting-day, on
  which the Belvoir will not afford opportunity to do both. If you can live
  with them while they run, and see them race into their fox at the finish, I
  congratulate you on having science, nerve, all the qualities of horsemanship,
  a good hunter, and, above all, a good groom.</p>

  <p>These remarks as to pace, stoutness, and sporting qualities, apply also to
  the Quorn, the Cottesmore, and the Pytchley. This last, indeed, with its
  extensive range of woodlands in Rockingham Forest, possesses the finest
  hunting country in England, spacious enough to stand six days a week in the
  mildest of winters all the season through. Under the rule of Lord Spencer,
  who has brought to bear on his favourite amusement the talent, energy, and
  administrative powers that, while they remained in office, were so
  serviceable to his party, the Pytchley seems to have recovered its ancient
  renown, and the sport provided for the white collars during the last year or
  two has been much above the average. His lordship thoroughly understands the
  whole management of hounds, in the kennel and the field, is enthusiastically
  fond of the pursuit, and, being a very determined rider as well as an
  excellent judge of a horse, is always present in an emergency to observe the
  cause and take measures for the remedy. Will Goodall has but little to learn
  as a huntsman, and, like his father, the unrivalled Will Goodall of Belvoir
  celebrity, places implicit confidence in his hounds. "They can put me right,"
  seems his maxim, "oftener than I can put them!" If a man wanted to see "a
  gallop in the shires" at its best, he should meet the Pytchley some Saturday
  in February at Waterloo Gorse, but I am bound to caution him that he ought to
  ride a brilliant hunter, and, as young Rapid would say, "harden his heart" to
  make strong use of him.</p>

  <p>Large grass fields, from fifty to a hundred acres in extent, carrying a
  rare scent, are indeed tempting; but to my own taste, though perhaps in this
  my reader may not agree with me, they would be more inviting were they not
  separated by such forbidding fences. A high black-thorn hedge, strong enough
  to hold an elephant, with one, and sometimes two ditches, fortified,
  moreover, in many cases, by a rail placed half a horse's length off to keep
  out cattle from the thorns, offers, indeed, scope for all the nobler
  qualities of man and beast, but while sufficiently perilous for glory, seems
  to my mind rather too stiff for pleasure!</p>

  <p>And yet I have seen half-a-dozen good men well-mounted live with hounds
  over this country for two or three miles on end without a fall, nor do I
  believe that in these stiffly fenced grazing grounds the average of dirty
  coats is greater than in less difficult-looking districts. It may be that
  those who compete are on the best of hunters, and that a horse finds all his
  energies roused by the formidable nature of such obstacles, if he means to
  face them at all!</p>

  <p>And now a word about those casualties which perhaps rather enhance than
  damp our ardour in the chase. Mr. Assheton Smith used to say that no man
  could be called a good rider who did not _know how to fall_.</p>

  <p>Founded on his own exhaustive experience there is much sound wisdom in
  this remark. The oftener a man is down, the less likely is he to be hurt, and
  although, as the old joke tells us, absence of body as regards danger seems
  even preferable to presence of mind, the latter quality is not without its
  advantage in the crisis that can no longer be deferred.</p>

  <p>I have seen men so flurried when their horses' noses touched the ground as
  to fling themselves wildly from the saddle, and meet their own apprehensions
  half-way, converting an uncertain scramble into a certain downfall. Now it
  should never be forgotten that a horse in difficulties has the best chance of
  recovery if the rider sits quiet in the middle of his saddle and lets the
  animal's head alone. It is always time enough to part company when his own
  knee touches the ground, and as he then knows exactly _where_ his horse is,
  he can get out of the way of its impending body, ere it comes heavily to the
  earth. If his seat is not strong enough to admit of such desirable tenacity,
  let him at least keep a firm hold of the bridle; that connecting link will,
  so to speak, "preserve his communications," and a kick with one foot, or
  timely roll of his own person, will take him out of harm's way.</p>

  <p>The worst fall a man can get is to be thrown over his horse's head, with
  such violence as to lay him senseless till the animal, turning a somersault,
  crushes his prostrate body with all the weight of its own. Such accidents
  must sometimes happen, of course, but they are not necessarily of every-day
  occurrence. By riding with moderate speed at his fences, and preserving, on
  all occasions, coolness, good-humour, and confidence in his partner, a
  sportsman, even when past his prime, may cross the severest parts of the
  Harborough country itself with an infinitesimal amount of danger to life and
  limb. Kindness, coercion, hand, seat, valour, and discretion should be
  combined in due proportion, and the mixture, as far as the hunting-field is
  concerned, will come out a real _elixir vitae_ such as the pale Rosicrucian
  poring over crucible and alembic sought to compound in vain.</p>

  <p>I cannot forbear quoting once more from the gallant soul-stirring lines of
  Mr. Bromley Davenport, himself an enthusiast who, to this day, never seems to
  remember he has a neck to break!</p>

  <p class="verse">"What is time? the effusion of life zoophytic,<br>
  In dreary pursuit of position or gain.<br>
  What is life? the absorption of vapours mephitic,<br>
  The bursting of sunlight on senses and brain.<br>
  Such a life has been mine, though so speedily over,<br>
  Condensing the joys of a century's course,<br>
  From the find, till they ate him near Woodwell-Head Covert,<br>
  In thirty bright minutes from Banksborough Gorse!"</p><br>

  <p>Yes, when all is said and done, perhaps the very acme and perfection of a
  _riding_ run, is to be attained within fifteen miles of Melton. A man who has
  once been fortunate enough to find himself, for ever so short a distance,
  leading</p>

  <p class="verse">"The cream of the cream, in the shire of shires,"</p>

  <p class="first">will never, I imagine, forget his feelings of triumph and
  satisfaction while he occupied so proud a position; nor do I think that, as a
  matter of mere amusement and pleasurable excitement, life can offer anything
  to compare with a good horse, a good conscience, a good start, and</p>

  <p class="verse">"A quick thirty minutes from Banksborough Gorse."</p>
