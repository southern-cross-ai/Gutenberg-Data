  <h2><a name="ch1-00"
     id="ch1-00">PROLOGUE.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Side by side with his dignified, handsome wife, Lord Bernard
  Clanavon, Earl of Alceston, stood receiving his guests in the spacious
  corridor which led into the brilliantly-lit ball-room of his town mansion. It
  was getting on toward midnight, but the stream of arrivals was scarcely yet
  lessened, and the broad marble staircase, lined with banks of palms and
  sweet-smelling exotics, was still thronged with graceful women in marvellous
  costumes and flashing jewelry, and tall, distinguished-looking men, some in
  gorgeous uniforms, with crosses and orders glistening upon their breasts, a
  few in court dress, and fewer still in the ordinary evening garb of
  civilians. For it was the first function of any social importance of a season
  which promised to be an exceptionally brilliant one, and nobody who was
  anybody at all in the charmed circle of London society would have thought of
  missing it. And so they trooped up the crimson-druggeted stairs in
  incongruous array&mdash;statesmen and peers, learned men and poets, men of
  the world and men of letters, the former with, the latter in most cases
  without, their womenkind; and very few indeed passed on into the ball-room
  without receiving some graceful little speech of welcome from their courteous
  host or charming hostess.</p>

  <p>A politician, a diplomatist, and the head of a noble family, Lord Alceston
  was a very well-known and popular leader of the world in which he lived. It
  would have been strange, indeed, had he been other that popular. Look at him
  as he bends low over the plump little hand of the Duchess of M&mdash;&mdash;
  and welcomes her with a little speech which in one sentence contains an
  epigram and a compliment. His face possesses the rare combination of an
  essentially patrician type of features and distinct expressiveness. There is
  nothing cold about his light blue eyes or his small, firm mouth, although the
  former are clear and piercing as an eagle's, and about the latter there lurks
  not the slightest trace of that indecision which so often mars faces of that
  type. The streaks of gray in his coal-black hair seem only to lend him an
  added dignity, and the slight stoop of his high shoulders is more the stoop
  of the horseman or the student than the stoop of gaucherie&mdash;rather
  graceful than otherwise, for, notwithstanding it, he still towers head and
  shoulders over the majority of the guests whom he is welcoming. He looks what
  he certainly is&mdash;an aristocrat and a man of perfect breeding: the very
  prototype of an Englishman of high birth. So much for his
  appearance&mdash;and enough, for he will not long trouble the pages of this
  story. Of his wife it is not necessary here to say more than that she looks
  his wife. She, too, is handsome, dignified, and aristocratic, and if society
  admires and reverences Lord Alceston, it adores his wife.</p>

  <p>At last the stream grows a little thinner. A great many have arrived in a
  body from a ducal dinner-party, and when these have made their bow and passed
  on through the curtained archway to where the Guard's band is playing the
  most delightful of Waldteufel's waltzes, there comes a lull. Her ladyship,
  closing her fan with a little snap, glances down the empty staircase and up
  at her husband. He stifles the very slightest of yawns, and, smiling
  apologetically, offers her his arm with a courtesy which, but for his charm
  of manner might have seemed a trifle elaborate.</p>

  <p>"I think that we might venture now," he remarked suavely. "You are a
  little fatigued, I fear."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her white shoulders, flashing with diamonds, and laid her
  delicate little fingers upon his coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>"A mere trifle. Whatever does Neillson want here, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston paused, and, turning round, faced a tall, grave-looking
  servant, in a suit of sober black, who was advancing slowly toward him,
  making his way through the throng of liveried footmen who lined the
  staircase. He carried a small silver salver in his hand, upon which reposed a
  single note.</p>

  <p>"Is that anything important, Neillson?" asked his master, frowning
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"I believe so, my lord," the man answered apologetically, "or I would not
  have taken the liberty of bringing it now. The bearer declined to wait for an
  answer."</p>

  <p>During the commencement of his servant's speech Lord Alceston's eyes had
  rested idly upon the superscription of the note which lay before him. Before
  its conclusion, however, a remarkable change had taken place in his manner.
  He made no movement, nor did he ask any question. He simply stood quite
  still, as though turned to stone, holding his breath even, gazing steadfastly
  down at the one line of address on the note. It seemed to have fascinated
  him; he did not even put out his hand to take it from the salver until
  Neillson reminded him of it again.</p>

  <p>"Will your lordship take the note?" he said in a low tone.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston stretched out his hand and took it after a momentary
  hesitation, which was very much like an involuntary shiver. Directly his
  fingers had closed upon it he seemed himself again.</p>

  <p>He looked swiftly around to see that no one had observed his passing
  agitation, and was satisfied: The footmen standing in line were still
  absorbed, partly in their duties, partly in the contemplation of their
  calves. His wife had been struggling with a refractory bracelet, which she
  had only just adjusted. Neillson alone had been in a position to notice
  anything unusual.</p>

  <p>"You did quite right, Neillson. You will excuse me for one moment?" he
  added, turning to the Countess. "This despatch may possibly require my
  immediate attention."</p>

  <p>She bowed her head languidly, and, sinking down upon a settee, recommenced
  fanning herself. Lord Alceston moved a little on one side, crushing up the
  note which he had taken from the salver in his slim, delicate fingers. For a
  moment he hesitated, and seemed inclined to destroy it unopened. The impulse,
  however, passed away, and, standing back behind some tall palms, which
  half-concealed him from his wife, fie tore it nervously open.</p>

  <p>Whatever the contents might have been they could have consisted of only a
  very few words, for he seemed to master them at a glance. But he did not
  immediately return to his wife's side. He stood there for more than a minute,
  with his back turned to her and the little troop of servants, and a very
  strange look in his face. One hand was pressed close to his side as though to
  ease some pain there, and the fingers of the other were locked around the
  half sheet of note paper which he had just received, crumpling it up into a
  scarcely recognizable mass. He had all the appearance of a man who has
  received a blow which for the moment has withered up all his faculties. His
  features were still impassive, but his face had a cold, numbed look, and all
  the light had died out of his eyes, leaving them glassy and dim. For a brief
  while he stood as motionless as a statue; then suddenly he shivered like a
  man awakening from a hideous nightmare, and moved his hand quickly from his
  side to his cold, damp forehead.</p>

  <p>Lady Alceston, who could only see his back, and that imperfectly, began to
  wonder what was the matter. She rose and walked slowly over toward him. The
  sound of her rustling skirts trailing over the thick, soft carpet seemed to
  suddenly recall him from his abstracted state. He turned round slowly and
  faced her.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary for me to write an answer to this note," he remarked
  quietly. "If my absence for a few minutes is observed, you will be able to
  make some excuse for me. The matter is really an important one."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows, but was too well bred to evince much surprise, or
  even curiosity.</p>

  <p>"From Downing Street?" she inquired, nonchalantly. "I didn't notice the
  seal."</p>

  <p>"Yes; from Downing Street," he answered. "It may take me some little time
  to answer, but you may rely upon my being as expeditious as possible."</p>

  <p>She turned away with a slight inclination of the head, and, leaving him,
  entered the ball-room. He moved forward and gravely held the curtain open for
  her, taking it from the hand of a servant who was stationed there; then he
  retraced his steps, and, leaving the anteroom by a private door, passed down
  a flight of stairs, through another door, and along a passage until he
  reached the apartment on the ground-floor which he called his study.</p>

  <p>It was a great room, finely proportioned and handsomely furnished, lined
  with books from floor to ceiling&mdash;a worthy study even for Lord Alceston,
  scholar, author, and politician. He paced across the thick, dark carpet like
  a man in a dream, with fixed gaze and slow movements, and sank into a chair
  in front of a black ebony writing-table strewn with letters, and piles of
  correspondence, and blue-books. For a moment he sat bolt upright, gazing into
  vacancy, or rather at the thick crimson curtains which hung before him, then
  suddenly his head dropped upon his folded arms and remained buried there for
  nearly a quarter of an hour. When he looked up his face was scarred and
  lined, as though with some swift, terrible trouble&mdash;as though he were
  passing through some fierce ordeal.</p>

  <p>He poured himself a glass of water from a carafe which stood at his elbow
  and drank it slowly. Then he set the empty glass down, and, leaning forward
  in his chair, pressed the knob of an electric bell in the wall opposite to
  him.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately 'there was a soft knock at the door, and his servant
  Neillson appeared.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston looked at him fixedly, as though seeking to discover
  something in the man's face. If he had hoped to do so, however, he was
  disappointed, for it remained absolutely impassive. The only expression
  discernible was one of respectful attention. His master withdrew his
  searching gaze with a slight movement of impatience, and gave his orders with
  his eyes fixed upon the table before him.</p>

  <p>"Get my ulster from my room, Neillson, and fetch me a hansom&mdash;to the
  mews door, of course."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord."</p>

  <p>Neillson was a perfectly trained servant, but he had not been able to
  conceal a slight start of surprise. Lord Alceston noticed it and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Neillson," he said, "you will remember what I told you when you entered
  my service?"</p>

  <p>The man bowed. "I do, my lord. I was to be surprised at no orders which
  you might give me and never to repeat them."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston nodded. "Very good; remember to obey them in the present
  instance.</p>

  <p>"I shall do so, my lord." The door closed, and Lord Alceston was left
  alone for a minute. He looked carefully around, as though to assure himself
  of the fact, for the reading-lamp upon his desk was heavily shaded and was
  quite insufficient to dispel the gloom which hung about the vast room.
  Suddenly he rose and walked with swift silent footsteps to the furthermost
  corner, in which stood a black oak chest with old-fashioned brass rings. He
  paused to listen for a moment&mdash;there was no sign of Neillson's return.
  Then he drew a bunch of keys from his pocket, opened one of the lower
  drawers, and, pushing his hand back to the remote corner, felt about for a
  moment. Apparently he found what he wanted, for suddenly he withdrew his
  hand, transferred some object to his pocket and returned to his seat. Almost
  immediately Neillson reappeared, carrying the ulster under his arm.</p>

  <p>"The hansom is at the mews door, my lord," he said, holding up the
  coat.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston rose and suffered himself to be helped into it.</p>

  <p>"Very good. You fetched it yourself, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lord. Is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>His master buttoned his coat up to his ears, and drawing a slouch cap from
  the pocket, pulled it over his forehead. Then he hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"No, there is nothing else at present, Neillson," he answered slowly. "I
  shall lock this door, and if I am inquired for you can let it be understood
  that I am engaged upon an important despatch."</p>

  <p>The man bowed and withdrew. Lord Alceston, drawing out his key from his
  pocket, followed him to the door and carefully locked it on the inside. Then,
  recrossing the room, he drew aside a Japanese screen and unlocked a small
  green baize door, which closed after him with a spring. He was then in a long
  dark passage, along which he passed rapidly until he emerged into a quiet
  side street, at the corner of which a cab was waiting. Without waiting to
  speak to the man, he stepped quickly inside and pulled down the window. The
  driver opened his trap-door and looked down.</p>

  <p>"Where to, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was nearly half a minute before Lord Alceston answered. Then he gave
  the address with some hesitation, and in so low a tone that he had to repeat
  it. The man touched his hat, closed the trap-door, and drove off.</p>

  <p><br>
  Two hours had passed since Lord Alceston had left his wife's side, and he was
  back among his guests again. Certainly he was amply atoning for his brief
  desertion of them, for every one was declaring that he was one of the most
  charming of hosts. He seemed to be in all places at all times, and to be
  incapable of fatigue. Now he was the life and soul of a little group of
  gossiping politicians, now among a bevy of dowagers, telling a story which
  was just sufficiently risque to awaken their keen interest without making
  them feel bound to appear unnaturally prudish, and consequently putting them
  all into a delightful temper. Now he was acting as his own master of
  ceremonies, and introducing exactly the right people to one another, and now
  he was walking through the mazes of a square dance with an old-fashioned
  stately dignity which many of the younger men envied. Wherever he went he
  seemed to drive gloom before him and to breathe gayety into the dullest of
  the dull. Even his wife watched him admiringly, and wished that he would
  always exert himself as he was doing then, for there were times, as she well
  knew, when he was but a nonchalant host. But to-night he was excelling
  himself he was brilliant, dignified, and full of tact. She began to wonder,
  as she paced slowly through the rooms on the arm of a Grand Duke, and
  answered with sweet smiles but only partial attention his labored
  commonplaces, whether that note from Downing Street had brought any good
  news. Visions of her husband at the head of the Cabinet, and entertaining for
  his party, began to float before her eyes, and she gave herself up to them
  until the growing coolness of her companion's manner warned her to abandon
  dreaming for the present and devote herself to her duties. But she made a
  mental note to inquire of her husband respecting that note at her earliest
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>At last the spacious rooms began to thin. Royalty had come and gone; the
  perfume of exotics was growing fainter and fainter and the fairy lights were
  growing dimmer and dimmer. Faster than before all the plagues of Egypt do
  London beauties fly before the daylight after a night's dancing, and the
  guests were departing in shoals before the faint gleams of approaching
  morning. At last their hour of release had come, and Lord Alceston sought his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"I have a letter to write for the morning post," he remarked. "With your
  permission I will come to you; room for a cup of tea in half an hour."</p>

  <p>Lady Alceston, seeing that save for the servants they were alone, indulged
  in the luxury of a yawn before she answered:</p>

  <p>"Do. I want to have a few minutes' talk. Don't be longer. Everything has
  gone off well, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks to your admirable arrangements yes, I think so," he answered
  courteously. And then, with the smile still lingering on his lips, he turned
  away and went to his library.</p>

  <p>Apparently he soon forgot his wife's invitation, for the first thing he
  did was to order a cup of strong tea to be brought to him at once. Neillson
  laid it down by his side on the table, and was about to depart when his
  master called him back.</p>

  <p>"Neillson, I've lost the key of the baize door somewhere this morning.
  Send down to Bellson's the locksmith, as soon as you think that he will be
  up, and have another one made."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord. Shall you require me again?"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston drew out his watch and looked at it. It was four o'clock. He
  hesitated with it still in his hand.</p>

  <p>"If I do not ring for you in half an hour you can go to bed," he
  decided.</p>

  <p>The door closed, and Lord Alceston was left alone. For a moment or two he
  sipped his tea leisurely. Then, drawing some paper toward him, he commenced
  to write.</p>

  <p>He had covered two sheets of note paper and had commenced the third when
  he suddenly ceased writing and started violently. Leaning forward he pressed
  the knob of the electric bell, and then, half fearfully, he turned slowly
  round and glanced across the room. Save for the heavily-shaded lamp which
  stood on his table it was still unilluminated, and the greater part of it was
  enveloped in shadow, for the closely-drawn curtains completely shut out the
  struggling daylight. Lord Alceston drew the shade from his lamp with fingers
  which trembled a little and held it high over his head while he looked
  searchingly around.</p>

  <p>There was a soft knock at the door, and Neillson entered. Lord Alceston
  put down the lamp with an unmistakable gesture of relief.</p>

  <p>"Neillson," he said, quietly, "there is some one in the room."</p>

  <p>Neillson looked around and then back at his master incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Some one in the room, my lord!" he repeated. "Impossible! I beg your
  lordship's pardon," he added confusedly, "I meant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what you meant, Neillson," interrupted his master. "Look
  behind that screen."</p>

  <p>Neillson approached the screen very gingerly and peered around it.</p>

  <p>"There's no one there, my lord," he declared, with relief. Side by side
  they walked round the apartment, Lord Alceston holding the lamp above his
  head. They discovered nothing. Obviously, save themselves there was no one
  else in the room. Lord Alceston resumed his seat and set the lamp down.</p>

  <p>"It's a very strange thing," he said, in a low tone. "I'm not a nervous
  man, and my hearing is remarkably good. I could have sworn that I heard a
  shuffling footstep. Neillson, fetch my revolver from my room, and see that
  all the chambers are loaded:"</p>

  <p>Neillson withdrew, and during his brief absence Lord Alceston sat round in
  his chair with his eyes restlessly wandering about the interior of the
  apartment. Presently Neillson reappeared and silently laid a small shining
  revolver on the desk by his master's side.</p>

  <p>"Anything further, your lordship?"</p>

  <p>"No, you can go to bed now! I suppose it must have been fancy. Just see,
  though, whether the baize door is securely locked."</p>

  <p>Neillson crossed the room and tried it.</p>

  <p>"It is locked, your lordship," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Very good; you can go."</p>

  <p>The door closed, and Lord Alceston, after one more furtive glance around,
  slowly finished his tea, drew the revolver close to his side and recommenced
  writing. He had barely finished another page, however, before his pen
  suddenly stopped upon the paper and his heart gave a great throb. Again he
  heard, this time without the possibility of any mistake, and close behind
  him, that low, stealthy sound. He dropped his pen and stretched out his
  shaking fingers for the revolver; but even when his hand had closed upon it
  he could not turn round. A cold horror seemed to have stolen over him,
  freezing his blood and numbing his limbs. All his sensations were those of a
  man in a hideous nightmare; but this was no nightmare.</p>

  <p>Again came the stealthy sound of a cat-like tread close to his chair. A
  hot breath upon his neck, and then, as life flowed suddenly again into his
  veins, and he strove to cry out, a handkerchief was pressed into his open
  mouth and he felt his senses reel before the swift, deadly influence of the
  chloroform with which it was soaked. Still he struggled for a moment, half
  turned round in his chair, and caught a glimpse of a pair of burning eyes
  fixed upon his, and read murder in them.</p>

  <p>"You!" he gasped. "You!"</p>

  <p>One arm seized his, and held them from behind. A swift gleam of blue steel
  flashed before his eyes; a sudden pain. It was over in a moment.</p>

  <p><br>
  There was a brisk sale for the evening papers on the following day. All down
  the Strand and round Trafalgar Square the eager newsboys were shouting out
  their terrible tidings, and for the lover of sensation there was very good
  value indeed in exchange for his penny. Placards leaned against the walls,
  were spread out upon the pavement, and were almost thrust into the faces of
  the ever-hurrying throngs of passers-by, and this is what they
  announced:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">AWFUL MURDER OF<br>
  THE EARL OF ALCESTON!</p><br>

  <p>and a little lower down&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="headline">ANOTHER TERRIBLE MURDER<br>
  IN THE EAST END!</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">An immense sensation was created this morning in all
  circles by the rumor, which has unhappily proved too true, that the Earl of
  Alceston had been found at an early hour this morning in his library with his
  throat cut and quite dead. On inquiry at Grosvenor Square this morning, our
  representative was put in possession of such facts as are already known.
  Briefly, they are as follows:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">It seems that during the holding of a reception and ball
  last night Lord Alceston received a letter, the origin of which is at present
  a mystery, which compelled him to absent himself for some considerable period
  from his guests. Later on in the evening, however, he rejoined them, and it
  was universally remarked that his lordship had never appeared in better
  health or spirits. Nothing further happened, or has since happened, to
  connect the receipt of this letter with the fearful crime which we have to
  report. After the departure of his guests, his lordship went straight to his
  library, promising to join his wife and take tea with her in half an hour.
  All we have been able to gather of what subsequently occurred is, that about
  nine o'clock this morning, as she had seen nothing of her husband, and had
  not heard him go to his room, Lady Alceston sent her maid to make inquiries.
  She went in company with a footman at once to the library, and, being unable
  to procure admission or to obtain any reply, summoned help, with the result
  that the door was forced open and the terrible spectacle disclosed of Lord
  Alceston leaning forward on the writing-table, with his clothes and face
  covered with blood and his throat cut completely round from side to side.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Although we are not at liberty, for obvious reasons, to
  state more at present, we understand that further startling disclosures have
  been made to the police by members of the household, but that at present
  there is no clue to the murderer.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">1.30 P.M.&mdash;His late lordship's valet, Philip
  Neillson, is believed to have absconded, not having been seen or heard of
  this morning.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">2 P.M.&mdash;A warrant has been issued for the arrest of
  the man Neillson on suspicion of having been concerned in the murder of his
  master, the Earl of Alceston. The accused has not yet been found.</p>&gt;

  <p class="newspaper">4 P.M.&mdash;It is now ascertained beyond doubt that
  Neillson has absconded. The police are making every effort to trace him, and
  are confident of success.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">The deceased earl was the third son of Lord Rupert
  Clanavon, Earl of Alceston, from whom he inherited the title and estates, and
  was the sixth peer. During his youth he held a commission in the Second Life
  Guards and served with distinction through the Crimean campaign. On the death
  of his two elder brothers, however, his lordship left the army, and, taking
  his seat in the House of Peers, devoted himself to politics. His lordship was
  created a K. C. B. in 18&mdash;, was a member of the Privy Council, and quite
  recently his name was mentioned as the probable successor to Lord H&mdash;in
  the Cabinet. The deceased peer was married in 18&mdash;to the Lady Margaret
  Agnes Montand, only daughter of the Earl of Montand, and leaves an only son,
  Lord Bernard Clanavon, who succeeds to the title and entailed
  estates.</p><br>

  <p>Below, cast almost into insignificance by such a heinous crime as the
  murder of a peer of the realm, was a short paragraph headed:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">ANOTHER TRAGEDY IN THE EAST END.<br>
  MURDER OF A WOMAN IN A LODGING-HOUSE.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">Just before going to press information came to hand of
  another awful murder in Riddell. Street, Bethnal Green Road. On being called,
  according to custom, by the proprietress of the lodging-house, a woman who
  went by the name of Mary Ward was discovered lying across her bed quite dead,
  and stabbed to the heart by some sharp instrument. The deceased woman was
  known to have been visited by three men during the early part of the night,
  the latter of whom left hurriedly, but no struggles or cries of any sort were
  heard, and no suspicion was entertained of foul play. It is not known whether
  any of the other lodgers will be able to identify or give any description of
  either of the men alleged to have visited the deceased. Failing this, it
  seems highly probable that this crime will be another addition to the long
  catalogue of undiscovered murders in this locality. We are not at present in
  a position to state definitely whether there is anything to justify the
  supposition that this most recent crime is by the same hand and for the same
  purpose as others committed in this neighborhood, as the police are
  maintaining a strict reticence in the matter.</p><br>

  <p>And so for one night, at least, Londoners had plenty of horrors to gorge
  themselves upon and to discuss eagerly in public-house and club, railway
  carriage and omnibus, restaurant and street corner. Two murders in one night,
  and both wrapped in mystery! What food for the sensation monger, what a fund
  of conversation for the general public&mdash;carmen in their public-houses,
  society at their clubs and social functions. Pleasure seekers, dining and
  supping at their favorite restaurants, were ready with their solemn
  expressions of horror and their more or less absurd theories. A million
  tongues were busy with this one subject, bandying backward and forward the
  name of the peer and the name of the woman. Truly there is fame in death!</p>

  <p><br>
  In his stately bedchamber, on snowy sheets, pillowed with lace, and strewn
  with flowers, his fine face white and rigid with the calm of death, lay
  Bernard, Lord Alceston, Earl of Harrowdean; and on a coarse straw mattress,
  barely covered over by a ragged, none too clean, coverlet, in a Bethnal Green
  lodging-house, lay the woman who had called herself Mary Ward. For him there
  were mourners, at least in name, and loud in lament&mdash;for her there were
  none. But, after all, what did it matter? Around him, as around her, the
  great world of London revolved without change in its mighty cycles of vice
  and misery, pleasure-seeking and fortune-spending, and if more voices were
  lowered at his name than hers, more tears dropped over his damask sheets than
  over her ragged coverlet, what matter? Whose was the profit?</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-01"
     id="ch1-01">I.&mdash;LORD CLANAVON'S TRAVELLING COMPANION.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"'Pon my word you're a very amusing fellow."</p>

  <p>The person addressed flushed slightly as though offended by the
  patronizing tone in which these words were carelessly spoken. But his
  annoyance, if indeed he felt any, was evidently short-lived, for he answered
  back readily enough, with a little laugh:</p>

  <p>"Glad you think so, very glad. It isn't every day, you see, that a poor
  fellow like me has the chance of amusing a milord&mdash;especially an English
  one."</p>

  <p>"Milord" arched his eyebrows, and not having detected the faint tinge of
  sarcasm in the other's tone, put this remark down to pure snobbishness. So he
  withdrew a little further into the corner of the comfortable first-class
  railway carriage, of which the two men were the only occupants, and remained
  silent for a few moments, idly strumming upon the window panes with his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"How did you know my name?" he asked, abruptly, turning again toward his
  fellow-passenger.</p>

  <p>"I didn't say that I did know it," was the reply. "I heard your servant
  call you 'my lord' on the boat, and there's a coronet on your bag there,
  unless my eyes deceive me, which they very seldom do. <i>Voila tout</i>."</p>

  <p>"Did you cross from Calais then? I didn't see you."</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Very likely not. In fact, it would have been very strange if you had seen
  me, considering that I was in my cabin all the while."</p>

  <p>"Sea-sick?" inquired "milord" contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sea-sick," was the unhesitating admission of his <i>vis-à-vis</i>.
  "I've never crossed yet without being sea-sick."</p>

  <p>The frankness of the confession was not without its effect upon the person
  to whom it was made. "Milord," although he was a yachtsman and a born sailor,
  and had all a healthy young Englishman's contempt for effeminacy in any shape
  or form, smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"Sorry for you. I was myself once, in the Bay of Biscay when I was eleven
  years old, and I haven't forgotten it. Deuced uncomfortable sensation it
  was."</p>

  <p>The difference between these two men, whom chance had thus thrown together
  on their journey from Dover to Waterloo, was very marked indeed. "Milord" was
  a typical young British aristocrat, with long straight limbs, smooth, fair
  face, a little tanned by exposure to all sorts of weather; well-cut features,
  about which there hovered a slight vacuity of expression common among young
  men of the higher orders who have nothing particular to do with themselves,
  and which was perhaps a little heightened by the single eye-glass which
  obscured one of his clear blue eyes. He was dressed in a light check
  travelling suit, colored shirt, with a white silk tie, and a small bunch of
  Parma violets in his buttonhole. He wore no gloves, and his hands, though
  shapely, were hard and brown. A well-worn tobacco-pouch was open by his side,
  from which he had recently replenished the deeply-colored meerschaum pipe
  which he was smoking. Taken as a whole, his appearance was distinctly
  aristocratic, with a dash of the Bohemian. At any rate, no one could possibly
  have mistaken him for anything else but a gentleman.</p>

  <p>His companion was a man of an altogether different stamp. His hair and
  mustache, once jet-black, were plentifully besprinkled with gray, and his
  small oval face was deeply lined. His features, though not striking, were
  refined and delicate, and his prominent forehead and deep clear eyes gave him
  somewhat the air of a student, which, however, his restless, almost flippant,
  manner in a measure contradicted. His manners, indeed, were the least
  pleasing part about him&mdash;alternately nervous and inquisitive, labored
  and careless. He was ill, almost shabbily, dressed, and many little details
  about his person and <i>tout ensemble</i> were obnoxious to his more
  distinguished fellow-passenger. Still, he had told some funny stories and had
  made himself very amusing without attempting to be familiar, and Lord
  Clanavon, whom two things&mdash;railway travelling and his own
  company&mdash;always bored exceedingly, felt faintly grateful to this
  stranger of doubtful appearance for relieving the monotony of his journey,
  and decided to tolerate him for the brief remainder of it.</p>

  <p>"You didn't come up from Paris, did you?" he inquired carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you were on the boat, too? Seems queer I didn't see you somewhere
  about."</p>

  <p>"I was below most of the time on the boat," the other reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes. I suppose that was it. I thought I'd watched every one on board
  at Calais, too. There was a bit of a crush, though, and I must have missed
  you. Hallo! isn't that your ticket on the floor?" he added, pointing to it
  with his foot.</p>

  <p>The other stooped forward quickly and picked it up. But Lord Clanavon's
  eyes were keen, and the ticket had fallen upon its back.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you book through from Paris?" he asked curiously. "That
  ticket's only from Dover, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's all. The fact is, I lost my ticket somewhere, and had to re-book
  from Dover. A nuisance, but it couldn't be helped."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, during which Lord Clanavon yawned several
  times, and as his companion had ceased to be amusing, he picked up a sporting
  paper and studied it for a few minutes. Then the train ran into Waterloo, and
  he rose and stretched himself with an air of relief.</p>

  <p>His fellow-passenger was the first to alight. Lord Clanavon returned his
  parting salute with a slight, condescending nod, then stepped out of the
  carriage himself, and, lighting a cigar, looked around for his servant. In a
  moment or two he came hurrying up.</p>

  <p>"Bring out my traps and take them round to Grosvenor Square in a cab,
  Burdett," he ordered. "I shall walk. What the mischief's the matter with
  you?" he added, in an altered tone, looking hard into the man face; "you look
  as though you'd seen a ghost."</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;nothing particular, my lord," Burdett answerer plunging into
  the carriage and busying himself folding up papers and collecting his
  master's belonging "It was rather a rough passage, my lord, and I think must
  have upset me a little."</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon, one of the most truthful young me in the world, accepted
  his servant's explanation at once though he glanced again with some curiosity
  into his pale, averted face.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought that you would have bee used to it by now," he
  remarked. "There's some brandy in that flask on the seat. Help yourself, if
  yo feel bad."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my lord," Burdett answered in a low tome; but instead of doing
  so he ceased for a moment in his task and watched his young master's
  retreating figure with tears in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have told him," he groaned; "but daren't. Oh! poor Mr.
  Bernard! Whatever will he do when he knows!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-02"
     id="ch1-02">II.&mdash;A BITTER WELCOME.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lord Bernard Clanavon was a young man who had earned for
  himself the reputation of extreme eccentricity. Even his father and mother,
  whose only and very much spoiled son he was, found themselves often force, to
  admit that he was odd. He had none of the vices and very few of the habits,
  of other young men of his class, which was all very well as far as it went;
  but it had its disadvantages. London life bored him, and the country, except
  during certain months of the year, was still less to his taste; consequently
  he spent a good deal of his time abroad; and, being difficult to suit in the
  matter of companionship, he spent most of it alone. Another of his
  peculiarities was that he detested having letters, and never, unless
  compelled, wrote them. To escape from a correspondence which, had his
  whereabouts been known, would have been inevitable, he made a point of never
  giving an address even to his own people, simply telling them the date of his
  return, to which he was always faithful.</p>

  <p>A month ago he had left London for Rome, with the remark that he would
  return on June 15, and at four o'clock in the afternoon of that day he was
  strolling over Waterloo Bridge on his way westward. A little distance behind,
  on the opposite side of the road, followed his late travelling companion.</p>

  <p>It was a fine afternoon, and the Strand was thronged with foot passengers
  and the streets with a ceaseless stream of vehicles. Lord Clanavon was
  evidently enjoying his walk. Head and shoulders taller than most of the
  crowd, he walked leisurely along, still smoking, and every now and then
  pausing to look in at a shop window or read the placards outside a theatre.
  The newsboys, who lined the gutters on the street, were making the air
  vibrate with their hideous news, but, partly on account of the great roar of
  traffic and partly owing to habitual inattention, he walked on serenely
  indifferent to their voluble cries. Close behind was his travelling
  companion, who watched him eagerly each time he passed one of the little
  knots of newspaper sellers, and whose face was gradually becoming savagely
  overcast. At last the blow fell. Close to Charing Cross Lord Clanavon paused
  with the evident intention of crossing the road, and as he stood on the
  curbstone waiting for an omnibus to pass, his eyes fell upon a placard which
  was thrust almost into his face by an eager newsboy, and his ears were salute
  at the same time by the cry which was echoing a down the Strand:</p>

  <p>"Hawful tragedy in the West End! 'Orrible murder of the Earl of
  Harrowdean! Full particulars!"</p>

  <p>For the space of fully thirty seconds Lord Clanavon stood perfectly still
  on the edge of the pathway as though turned into a figure of stone. Then a
  ghastly paleness crept into his cheeks, banishing all his ruddy manly color,
  and he swayed backward as though about to fall. The roar of the passing
  vehicles and the babel of talk and street shouts around seemed to come to him
  from a far-off distance, and the ground appeared to slide away from under his
  feet. Then came a darkness before his eyes, a sudden tightening of the brain,
  and at last unconsciousness. It was the first swoon of a man of iron nerves
  and constitution and it was not to be forgotten.</p>

  <p><br>
  When Lord Clanavon opened his eyes and looked around him his first
  impressions were rather mixed ones. To begin with, he was lying upon a
  strange sofa in a strange room; and, more wonderful still, its only other
  occupant was a woman. He raised himself noiselessly upon his elbow and
  scrutinized his surroundings a little more carefully. The room was of
  moderate size, and was well and tastefully furnished, though not luxuriously.
  This much a hasty glance showed him, then his eyes fell upon his companion
  and remained there. He was an artist by temperament, keenly appreciative of
  beauty in any form, and he felt a subtle sense of pleasure in letting his
  gaze rest upon her perfect oval face, with its dark blue, almost violet, eyes
  and brilliant complexion and her dainty <i>petite</i> figure. For a moment or
  two he lay there watching her; then she looked up from the flowers which she
  was busy arranging and blushed slightly as her eyes met his.</p>

  <p>"You are better?" she inquired softly, crossing the room and standing at
  his side.</p>

  <p>"Better!" he repeated, wonderingly. "Have I been ill? Ah!"</p>

  <p>A sudden wave of recollection came streaming in upon him, bringing with it
  a sickening sense of the horrible thing which had happened. Again he seemed
  to be in the noisy Strand, with that 'awful placard stretched out before him
  and the shrill cries of the eager newsboys ringing in his ears. This time,
  however, he withstood the shock and remained calm.</p>

  <p>"Have you one of those papers?" he asked, rising slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>She put one into his outstretched hand unwillingly, and with a great
  compassion shining out of her luminous eyes.</p>

  <p>"My father left one here for you," she said, softly. "He thought that it
  would be better for you to read all about it for yourself. I&mdash;I am so
  sorry."</p>

  <p>He took it with trembling fingers, and, sinking down upon an ottoman, read
  it through. Then the paper fluttered down on to the floor and he covered his
  face with his hands for a few minutes. When he looked up again he was quite
  calm, but his voice was hard and his eyes dry and bright.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" he asked, looking around him.</p>

  <p>"You are in my father's rooms in Craven Street," she answered. "You were
  taken ill and he brought you here."</p>

  <p>"It was very good of him, very kind. Is he here?"</p>

  <p>"He will be in a moment; you will wait and see him, won't you? I&mdash;I'm
  afraid you have had some very terrible news."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the paragraph.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was my father."</p>

  <p>"Your father! Oh, how dreadful! And you knew nothing about it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I came back this afternoon from abroad, and was on my way
  home."</p>

  <p>The sight of his misery was awful. She turned away with a little sob and
  stood at the window with her handkerchief pressed to her eyes. She would have
  liked to console him, but how was she to attempt it? A stranger, too! So she
  did what seemed to her the next best thing&mdash;she remained silent, asking
  no more questions.</p>

  <p>After a while the necessity for action of some sort flashed in upon him.
  He rose suddenly and took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I must go now," he said, keeping his voice steady with an effort. "If
  your father has gone out, will you tell me his name that I may call and thank
  him for his kindness&mdash;and you for yours?" he added.</p>

  <p>The words were conventional enough; the tone was a little more grateful
  even than the occasion seemed to demand. Perhaps she thought so, for she
  blushed faintly when she answered him.</p>

  <p>"Our name is De Feurget, and&mdash;ah, that is my father's step, I think.
  He has returned then."</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon turned toward the door and saw a slight, dark figure
  standing upon the doorstep. Something familiar in the pale oval face and
  restless eyes arrested the words which he had been on the point of uttering.
  But it was not until Mr. de Feurget had advanced into the centre of the room
  that Lord Clanavon recognized his recent travelling companion. Then he held
  out his hand with a somewhat forced smile.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely thought that we should meet again so soon," he said. "It was
  very good of you to bring me here; I don't know what would have become of me
  if you hadn't. I suppose I must have fainted," he added, as though rather
  ashamed of the fact.</p>

  <p>"Such a shock is enough to make any man faint," the other added, gravely.
  "I trust that you are better now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am better," Lord Clanavon answered, with a little shudder. "I was
  just going as you came in. Perhaps you will allow me to call again at some
  future time. Just now I don't feel up to much conversation, and I feel that I
  haven't thanked you and your daughter half enough for your kindness."</p>

  <p>He had moved toward the open door, and from there bowed his farewell to
  the young lady. Certainly she was very beautiful, he thought, as he looked
  into her dark brilliant face and saw the soft sympathetic light flashing in
  her deep blue eyes. And then he felt ashamed of himself for thinking of such
  a thing at such an awful time, and turned away a little abruptly.</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget followed him downstairs and opened the door for him.</p>

  <p>"Let me fetch you a hansom," he suggested. "You look scarcely fit to
  walk."</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think that the walk will do me good," he said. "I couldn't breathe in a
  cab. Good-afternoon."</p>

  <p>Then he turned away and walked slowly down the street with bowed head and
  eyes fixed upon the pavement. The man from whom he had parted remained upon
  the doorstep watching him with a curious look upon his face. His thin,
  colorless lips were parted in a slight smile, which was more suggestive of a
  sneer than of mirth, and his dark eyes had lost for a moment their shifty,
  restless expression and were full of deep thought. He stood here for fully
  five minutes after Lord Clanavon had disappeared, motionless and absorbed.
  Then some trifling noise in the street seemed to change the current of his
  thoughts, and he abruptly re-entered the house and closed the door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-03"
     id="ch1-03">III.&mdash;GOD'S VENGEANCE WOULD BE TOO SLOW.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The idea of murder in the abstract has become so familiar to
  us from its frequent adaptation by the novelist and the columns of newspapers
  that it is rather difficult for an unimaginative person to realize its full
  horrors. To do so thoroughly we must picture to ourselves some one very near
  and dear to us suddenly snatched from our midst and hurried into eternity by
  such means. If we can do that we may be able to understand in some slight
  measure the agony of horrified grief, succeeded by the burning desire for
  vengeance, which Bernard Clanavon felt as he slowly began to realize what had
  happened. It did more than make itself felt; it crept into his whole being
  like morphia let into an opened vein, and swept every other thought and
  impulse before it. The relations between him and his father had been exactly
  typical of the relations which exist between the majority of English fathers
  and English sons. There had been little or no sentiment, and outward
  expressions of affection had been very rare between them. Yet underneath the
  superficial crust of indifference there had been a strong and reciprocal
  affection, seldom manifesting itself in any more pronounced manner than by
  quiet cordiality, but still an existent and healthy feeling, which this
  hideous tragedy had fanned almost into a passion. And so, naturally enough,
  when the first shock of the interview was over, and the sight of her son had
  quieted a little his mother's grief, he withdrew himself from her embrace and
  asked the question which was burning within him:</p>

  <p>"Is there any clue, mother? Do they know who has done&mdash;this
  thing?"</p>

  <p>They were alone in Lady Alceston's boudoir, a small octagonal apartment
  hung with amber satin and furnished with all the soft luxury which perfect
  taste and unlimited wealth could devise. It was a room sacred to
  women&mdash;even Lord Alceston himself had seldom entered it&mdash;and
  Bernard Clanavon looked curiously out of place standing up erect among the
  low velvet-covered <i>fauteuils</i>, the delicate knick-knacks and
  softly-flashing mirrors, with a terribly fierce look upon his white
  sorrow-stricken face, and his eyes fixed upon his mother's bowed form full of
  a dry, burning light.</p>

  <p>She withdrew her handkerchief from her face, and, looking up at him,
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Bernard, don't look like that," she pleaded. "I would rather see you
  cry."</p>

  <p>He turned his face away from her with a slight gesture of impatience, but
  its expression was unaltered.</p>

  <p>"Crying is a woman's office, mother," he said in a low tone. "There is
  something else for a man to think about here. You have not answered my
  question."</p>

  <p>"Neillson has disappeared," she said, slowly. "There is nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Neillson! Neillson!" he repeated, half in wonderment, half in contempt.
  "Neillson guilty of&mdash;oh, that is all nonsense! I would as soon suspect
  myself.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, he has disappeared," she repeated. "He was the last person
  who saw your father alive, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it couldn't possibly have been Neillson," he interrupted firmly.
  "Why, a more simple-minded old fellow never breathed. You can't believe this
  yourself, mother."</p>

  <p>The hand which clutched her handkerchief trembled violently, and she
  seemed to answer with great difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know. It is all so strange and horrible. Why should any
  one&mdash;oh, Bernard, Bernard, ask me no more questions!" she burst out,
  sobbing violently.</p>

  <p>He waited until she was more composed, standing perfectly motionless, his
  fair, beardless face set and rigid and full of a terrible determination,
  looking, in the sweet subdued light thrown upon it by the tinted and
  heavily-shaded fairy lamps, like a piece of exquisite statuary.</p>

  <p>"It was not Neillson," he said, quietly, when at last his mother removed
  the handkerchief from her eyes. "The utter absence of motive alone would make
  such an idea absurd."</p>

  <p>She seemed still struggling with her agitation, but she answered him.</p>

  <p>"Bernard," she said, "I cannot discuss this with you. The&mdash;the
  inquest is to-morrow. Wait till then."</p>

  <p>Her evident pain seemed to touch him, for he stooped down and kissed her.
  Then he moved toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He paused on the threshold.</p>

  <p>"To Mr. Brudnell's office and then to Scotland Yard, to see what is being
  done."</p>

  <p>She turned away from him with a gesture of horror. "Bernard," she cried,
  passionately, "it seems to me that grief is second in your thoughts to
  vengeance!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's the difference between a man's grief and a woman's, mother, that's
  all. Yours is passive, racking your body and filling your thoughts and
  remaining there. Mine is a grief which calls out for action of some
  sort&mdash;for vengeance."</p>

  <p>She stood up with her hand stretched out toward him, beautiful still, for
  all her gray hair and her marble-white countenance&mdash;beautiful in her
  perfect features and the solemn majesty of her attitude and gesture.</p>

  <p>"Bernard," she cried, "vengeance belongs to God and not to man! He himself
  has said it. I command you to desist from the purpose which you have in your
  heart, which is written in your face."</p>

  <p>There was something intensely dramatic in the quickly-spoken words and in
  her sudden transformation from a weeping, sorrowful woman to a dignified
  queen of tragedy, with all the fire of command ringing in her passionate
  words. But she might as well have cried to the walls.</p>

  <p>"I am your son, mother, and in anything else I would obey you. But I was
  his son, too! God's vengeance would be too slow for me," he added,
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>Then he left her, and in a moment she was a brokenhearted woman again,
  sobbing wildly among the soft cushions of her low chair and talking to
  herself in broken tones.</p>

  <p>"My 'God, my God," she moaned, "what shall I do&mdash;oh, what shall I
  do?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-04"
     id="ch1-04">IV.&mdash;THE INQUEST AT GROSVENOR SQUARE.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An inquest on the body of a peer of the realm is not an
  every-day occurrence. The coroner, who sat at the head of the long mahogany
  table, looked a shade graver and more impressed with the solemnity of his
  office than usual, and the same feeling was reflected in the solid-looking
  faces of his twelve subordinates as they were marshalled to their seats. Many
  of them had served on a jury before, but never in connection with such a
  sensational case, and there was a certain sense of ponderous satisfaction
  upon their faces as they drew close up to the table, almost as though they
  felt something akin to pleasure in the notoriety which their office would
  bring them. But there was genuine sympathy among them, notwithstanding, and
  more than one cast a pitying glance at Lord Clanavon, who sat a little apart
  in a high-backed oak chair.</p>

  <p>It was a gloomy scene. Apart from the inevitable solemnity of it, the
  surroundings were in themselves depressing. Outside a thick, yellow fog had
  settled down upon the squares and streets&mdash;a penetrating fog which
  defied the drawn venetian blinds and heavily-draped curtain, and which hung
  about in a little mist around the circular glass globes and impregnated the
  whole atmosphere of the long room, which was at no time one of the most
  cheerful. It certainly could not have been said that the countenances of the
  twelve men, or their surroundings, were in any way out of keeping with the
  dreary nature of their duty. Both were funereal.</p>

  <p>The silence was broken at last by the coroner, who in a low tone formally
  introduced the jury to their duties. Then the first witness, William Rogers,
  was called, and a tall, liveried footman answered the summons and took up a
  respectful attitude before the table. The coroner commenced his examination
  at once.</p>

  <p>"Your name is William Rogers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"What position do you hold in the household?"</p>

  <p>"First footman, sir."</p>

  <p>"How long have you been in the service of your deceased master?"</p>

  <p>"About three years."</p>

  <p>"You were the first person to enter the library and discover your master's
  body, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"I was, sir."</p>

  <p>"You had better tell us how it was, and by whose orders you went
  there."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. It was about seven o'clock in the morning when I was woke
  up by a knocking at my door. I sat up in bed at once and called out, 'Who's
  there?' Her ladyship's maid, Marie Richards, answered me. I can't remember
  her exact words, but she said as her ladyship had sent her to tell me, to go
  down to the master's study at once and see why he had not come up to bed. I
  asked her why she did not go to Neillson, which was his lordship's own man,
  and she replied that she had been, but she couldn't wake him, which, knowing
  as Neillson, who used to share the same room with me, was a very heavy
  sleeper, I warn't surprised at. 'All right,' I sung out, 'I'll be down in a
  moment;' and I hurried into some clothes as fast as I could. When I got
  outside she was a-waiting on the landing for me quite impatient like, and we
  went down together. I knocked first at the study door several times, but
  there was no answer; so I told Marie that his lordship had very likely gone
  straight to his own room instead of going in to see her ladyship. I left her
  there and went up to see, but the room was quite empty and the bed had not
  been slept in. So I Game down a little flurried like and told Marie to go and
  tell her ladyship and ask what we were to do. Her ladyship sent down at once
  that we were to get in the study somehow at once, even if we had to break
  open the door. So I sent Marie for Thomas, the under footman, and together we
  forced the door open."</p>

  <p>The man paused for a moment as though to take breath, and when he resumed
  it was in a low, awed tone. Low though it was, however, it was distinctly
  heard, for every one was holding his breath and listening in an intense
  hushed silence.</p>

  <p>"The room was quite dark except for just one ray of light which was
  streaming in from the window, just where the curtains, which had been pulled
  together, didn't meet quite, and that single gleam of light just fell upon
  his lordship's face. Gentlemen, you must excuse&mdash;one moment, please. It
  was an awful sight!"</p>

  <p>The man's voice was checked by something very much like a sob, and he
  shuddered. There was a slight murmur of sympathy, during which he mopped his
  damp forehead with a handkerchief and slowly recovered his composure.
  Presently he drew himself up to his former attitude and continued:</p>

  <p>"I'm much obliged to you, gentlemen, for giving me breathing-time. If any
  one of you had seen the sight as I saw when that door fell in, you'd
  understand it making me feel a bit queer. I'll try and tell you what it was
  like. His lordship seemed to be all slouched down in his writing-chair, but
  his head was hanging right backward like, over the side a little, and was
  hanging down almost toward the ground. There was a great gap like between the
  neck and his chin, and as we stood there we could hear the slow drip, drip of
  the blood upon the floor; yet somehow it didn't seem as though he was dead,
  for his eyes were wide, staring open. Marie, she went off into hysterics
  something awful, and Thomas, he was trembling so that he couldn't neither
  move nor nothing else. I felt mortal bad myself, but I went up and touched
  his hand and found that it was quite cold, and then I saw the three scratches
  and bruises on his cheek like finger-marks. I saw that he was dead at once,
  but I told Thomas to be off as quick as ever he could and fetch a doctor and
  a policeman. I stood near the door while he was gone; and then when the
  sergeant came and Dr. Benton they locked up the room. That's all, sir."</p>

  <p>He ceased with an evident gesture of relief. He was an unimaginative,
  phlegmatic man, of the very commonplace type of English men-servants, and
  without any particular affection for his master; but his share in this
  tragedy, as yet so recent, had been like a nightmare to him, and the
  recapitulation of it had agitated him strongly. They gave him a little time
  to recover himself before they asked him any questions. Then the coroner
  ceased taking notes and addressed him.</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything disarranged in the study&mdash;any signs of a
  struggle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. There was something of the sort. The curtain hanging over his
  lordship's private door, which led out into Berkeley Street, was half torn
  down and a small table with some books on, between his lordship's desk and
  the door, was upset."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else that I can remember, sir. The policeman and the gentleman
  from Scotland Yard they took possession of the room as soon as they arrived,
  and locked it up."</p>

  <p>The usual number of irrelevant and utterly useless questions were asked by
  certain jurymen of an inquisitive turn of mind, to some of which the coroner
  listened with ill-concealed impatience. Then the witness was dismissed, and,
  well trained though his features were, his relief was manifest.</p>

  <p>Marie Richards was called next. Her evidence simply corroborated that of
  her fellow-servant, and no questions were asked her. Then the Countess of
  Harrowdean was sent for, and after a little delay appeared.</p>

  <p>To those who had known her before, her appearance was a shock. From head
  to foot she was clothed in the severest black, and a widow's cap concealed
  her light hair. The features which a week before would have been pronounced
  delicately moulded were now sharpened like the features of an overworked
  seamstress, and the ghastly blanched pallor of her complexion showed up with
  startling vividness the deep black rims under her sunken eyes. She was like a
  woman prematurely aged, stricken down in a single night, and an involuntary
  murmur of compassion escaped from the lips of more than one of the little
  body of men as they stood up to receive her. Her bearing and figure were the
  sole remnants of her former self. She walked up the room, leaning upon her
  son's arm (he had left his place and met her at the door), with a calm
  dignity which her sorrow seemed only to have enhanced, and there was
  something almost majestic in the manner in which she sank slowly into the
  easy-chair provided for her and acknowledged slightly the coroner's
  respectful salutation.</p>

  <p>He commenced his examination at once, after thanking her for her
  attendance and regretting its necessity.</p>

  <p>"Can your ladyship tell us anything which happened during the evening of
  last Tuesday which will throw any light upon this melancholy event or afford
  any clue as to its perpetrator?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not. I will tell you all that I know," she answered, in a low
  but perfectly clear tone. "During the evening, while we were receiving our
  guests, my husband had a note brought to him. I do not know where it was
  from, or what it was about, but its contents seemed to cause him some
  uneasiness."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," interrupted the coroner, "but who brought Lord Alceston this
  letter?"</p>

  <p>"Neillson."</p>

  <p>The jury exchanged significant glances. The coroner made a note and signed
  to her ladyship to proceed.</p>

  <p>"He told me that an urgent matter&mdash;I understood him to say some
  official business&mdash;required his immediate attention, and that he would
  be compelled to leave me for a while. I went in to my guests, and he to his
  study. It was past one o'clock, nearly two hours, before he rejoined me.
  During the remainder of the evening he was in remarkably good spirits, and
  certainly did not seem to have anything on his mind. When all the people had
  gone he went back again to his study, promising to come into my room shortly
  and have some tea. I waited for him for some time, and then, as he did not
  come, I put on my dressing-gown and dismissed my maid, as she seemed very
  tired. I must have gone to sleep then over the fire, for when I woke up it
  was getting daylight. I found that the tea tray had not been touched, and
  that my husband had evidently not been in. As he was very particular in
  keeping his promises, I was a little alarmed, and I rang for Marie and told
  her to go to Neillson's room and tell him to see where his master was. She
  came back saying she could not wake him. I sent her then to William, the head
  footman. Soon afterward she returned to say the library door was locked, and
  I told them to break it open. I heard this done and the commotion,
  and&mdash;and soon afterward they came and told me."</p>

  <p>Every one was conscious of a certain sense of relief when she had
  finished. Her voice had never once trembled, and her dry eyes were bright and
  tearless. But there was something awfully unnatural in her slow, monotonous
  tone and in the repressive calmness of her manner. None would have been in
  the least surprised if she had burst out into a fit of the wildest hysterics
  at any moment. The coroner himself was nervous, but there were some questions
  which he felt bound to ask her.</p>

  <p>"You saw or heard nothing of your husband's servant, Neillson, during the
  evening, after he brought that note?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"How long had he been in your husband's service?"</p>

  <p>"More than twenty years."</p>

  <p>"And had the relations between them always been cordial?"</p>

  <p>"As far as I know."</p>

  <p>"You know of no circumstance likely to have created any resentment on
  Neillson's part toward your husband?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Was Neillson a saving man? Was he fond of money, do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so. Yes, he was."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are not aware whether your husband had any money either on
  his person or in his desk on the night of his murder?"</p>

  <p>Lady Alceston for the first time moved her position a little and lowered
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>The change almost hid her from her son, who had resumed his seat on the
  opposite side of the room.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe he had," she answered thoughtfully&mdash;"rather a
  considerable sum. I had reminded him that it was quarter-day, when we always
  pay some of the household accounts, and he had told me that he had been to
  the bank and drawn some money. This was during the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"About how much would it amount to?"</p>

  <p>"Between five and six hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"Where did Lord Alceston bank?"</p>

  <p>"At the London and Westminster."</p>

  <p>The coroner made a note. Several of the jury did the same. Then her
  ladyship was very politely told that she was needed no longer, and on her
  son's arm she left the room. Out in the hall he turned round and faced
  her.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said quietly, "you know that Neillson is no more capable of
  doing this thing than I am. Why didn't you tell them so?"</p>

  <p>"Because they did not ask me for my opinion&mdash;only for facts."</p>

  <p>A shadow darkened his boyish, handsome face. He caught her hand with a
  sudden impulsive movement and forced her to look into his eyes. A vague
  uneasiness had laid hold of him. What did it mean, this unnatural repression,
  this indefinable something in his mother's manner which seemed to suggest a
  secret, some knowledge which neither he nor others shared? It was clear to
  him that the calmness of her manner and speech was forced and unreal. She was
  putting a great constraint upon herself. Why? Again he asked himself, what
  did it mean?</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said in a low, agitated tone, bending Close over her, and
  glancing first half fearfully around to be sure that none else was lingering
  about in the hall, "you know something more than you told. Is it not so?
  Cannot you trust me? I must know."</p>

  <p>She did not answer him, although her lips moved. Looking into her face, he
  saw what was coming, and passed his arm around her waist and held her up
  firmly. The ashen pallor drew the color even from her lips, and her breath
  came in short troubled gasps. She had fainted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-05"
     id="ch1-05">V.&mdash;WILFUL MURDER AGAINST PHILIP NEILLSON.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The next witness summoned before the coroner was the doctor,
  whose evidence was short and to the point. He described the means by which
  the deceased had met with his death as a complete severance of the jugular
  vein by one sweeping cut. Only the sharpest of knives and the strongest of
  arms, he added impressively, could have succeeded in inflicting such a
  ghastly wound&mdash;the most ferocious he had ever seen. The bruises on the
  cheek he had no hesitation in saying were caused by the convulsive grasp of
  the murderer while in the act of performing the hideous deed.</p>

  <p>The coroner asked him only three questions.</p>

  <p>"Could the wound which you have been describing have been
  self-inflicted?"</p>

  <p>"Not easily," was the emphatic answer. "Had the wound gone an inch further
  it would have been a physical impossibility."</p>

  <p>"How long did it strike you that, deceased had been dead after you were
  called in?"</p>

  <p>"I examined him with a view of being able to answer that question.
  Scarcely more than two hours, I should think."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything in the condition or disarrangement of the room
  which seemed to indicate any struggle between the murderer and the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. My idea is that the murderer stole quietly up to the back of the
  deceased's chair, and, leaning over, placed his hand over his mouth, in which
  case the points of his fingers would just reach the bruised part of his face;
  and then, drawing his head back with a quick movement, cut his throat."</p>

  <p>A little shudder passed round the table at this graphic description, which
  the witness had been illustrating by gestures and a sweeping cut of his own
  throat with the edge of his hand. The doctor looked a little surprised. He
  didn't understand such a feeling. To him the technical details of the affair
  were far more interesting than its ethical horrors. But then he was a
  specialist and had no imagination.</p>

  <p>The next witness was the last of any consequence. James Armson was called,
  and the Scotland Yard detective entered the room closely followed by Lord
  Clanavon. The latter quietly resumed his old seat and turned at once eagerly
  to the detective, listening to every word he uttered with keen anxiety.</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon, who recognized the fact that upon this man's capabilities
  would depend chiefly his chances of discovering his father's murderer, was
  not altogether impressed by his appearance. But he changed his opinion
  somewhat after listening to the concise and yet guarded manner in which he
  gave his evidence.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us, Mr. Armson," the coroner asked, "the history of your
  connection with this case as far as it has gone?"</p>

  <p>The detective bowed respectfully, and told the story in a professional
  manner.</p>

  <p>"I was talking to P.C. Chopping at the corner of Belton Street about seven
  o'clock on the morning in question when a footman turned the corner of
  Grosvenor Square and came running toward us. He was very incoherent, but we
  gathered from him that a murder had been committed at his master's house, and
  that he was anxious for P. C. Chopping to proceed there at once. We all set
  off together, and he brought us here and into the library. Lord Alceston was
  lying in the chair exactly as described by a former witness. The doctor and
  the witness Rogers were the only other occupants of the room. I immediately
  locked the door and while the doctor was examining deceased I made an
  inspection of the room. My first discovery was that there was a secret door
  opening out into Burton Street and that it was unlocked. I was also able to
  trace faint drops of blood between the door and the chair where the deceased
  man lay, which suggested to me that the murderer made his escape by that
  door, carrying in his hand the weapon which he had been using. Later in the
  morning a milkman brought to Scotland Yard the pocket-handkerchief and knife
  now in possession the coroner, which he picked up a few yards down the
  street."</p>

  <p>The detective paused and waited while the articles he mentioned were
  produced and handed round. The handkerchief was a fine cambric one, but
  unmarked and was soaked and clotted with blood. The knife was distinctly a
  curiosity. The blade was curved slight in the shape of a scimiter, and was of
  exquisite steel sharpened both sides, and with an edge as keen as a razor's.
  The handle was curiously shaped and carved and was evidently of foreign
  workmanship. Altogether as a piece of evidence, the milkman's find was a most
  important one.</p>

  <p>The detective had little else to say of importance and the other witnesses
  less. Then an adjournment was made to the library. No fresh discovery was
  made but it became evident to all how easy the committal of the crime might
  have been, supposing it to have been accomplished according to the general
  theory. The lock of the secret door behind the screen opened noiselessly, and
  the edges of the door were cased in india-rubber. The carpet was thick and
  soft as velvet, and the distance from the termination of the screen to the
  chair in which Lord Alceston had been sitting was scarcely more than a dozen
  yards.</p>

  <p>Two further points were cleared up. The first of was with regard to the
  key of the door behind the screen, which, it was ascertained, had been
  discovered in the keyhole outside. The second was concerning the bank-notes
  which, according to Lady Alceston's evidence, the murdered man had in his
  possession. No trace was found of these, either on the person of the deceased
  or among his effects. The inference Was obvious&mdash;they had been taken
  away by the murderer, and who but Neillson could have known that his master
  had such a sum in his possession?</p>

  <p>The coroner and his jurymen returned to the dining-room and were left to
  themselves while they considered their verdict. Lord Clanavon, after a few
  minutes' hesitation, walking up and down the hall with his hands behind him,
  made his way into the servants' quarters and asked for Burdett.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember how long Neillson has been here, and where he came from?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"He's been here longer than I can remember, my lord," Burdett answered,
  promptly. "We've just been reckoning it up; and a nicer, quieter, steadier
  sort o' chap I never knew. We can't none of us believe that he's had anything
  to do with this," he added.</p>

  <p>"Neither can I," Lord Clanavon answered. "I liked Neillson. Do you know
  where he was before he came here?"</p>

  <p>Burdett shook his head. "It's a strange thing, my lord, but I never heard
  him mention it. He was a quiet sort of a man about his own
  affairs&mdash;wonderfully close."</p>

  <p>"He had pretty good wages, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"He had a hundred and fifty a y ear, my lord, and Groves, the butler, says
  that he couldn't have spent the odd fifty. He was a saving man, although he
  wasn't what you could call mean."</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon returned to his own little apartment on the ground-floor,
  feeling a little more bewildered than ever. Just as he entered it the
  dining-room door opened, and he heard the verdict passed from one to
  another&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wilful murder against Philip Neillson."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-06"
     id="ch1-06">VI.&mdash;MARIE DE FEURGET.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A remarkably pretty young woman was doing her best to spoil
  an otherwise charming face by scowling at herself in a mirror. It was a very
  silly thing for her to do, very silly indeed, for the utter weariness and
  discontent which her tell-tale features betrayed was quite sufficient to
  leave its traces, if often indulged in, even upon so pert and young a face as
  hers. Perhaps the same idea occurred to her, or it might have been that some
  pleasing thought acted as a charm. At any rate, after five minutes' silent
  contemplation of herself, she suddenly withdrew from the mirror, sank into an
  easy-chair, and sat looking into vacancy, with a soft smile parting her lips
  and transfiguring her expression.</p>

  <p>Presently a smooth-coated, brown <i>dachshund</i> rose slowly from the
  hearth-rug, lazily reared its two front paws upon her lap, and, wagging its
  tail in an insinuating manner, fixed a meditative gaze upon his young
  mistress. She commenced to caress him, mechanically at first, but the
  encouragement was sufficient. He leaped up with all the agility which his
  short limbs would permit and coiled himself in her lap.</p>

  <p>She looked down at him reproachfully, and as though inclined to protest
  against such a liberty. But the soft brown eyes watching hers so anxiously
  disarmed her, and she changed her mind. She took him into her confidence
  instead. After all, better a dog to talk to than nobody.</p>

  <p>"Tory," she said, shaking a forefinger at him, "that was very
  rude&mdash;very bad manners indeed. Don't you know that you ought to have
  been specially invited to come up in my lap before you took such a liberty?
  No; you needn't go," she added, patting his head softly. "Now you are here
  you may as well stay&mdash;for a little time, at least. Oh, Tory! Tory! How I
  wish you were a human being&mdash;even if you were only a girl&mdash;so that
  I might talk to you sensibly now and then. It wouldn't be quite so
  <i>triste</i> then&mdash;and it is very <i>triste</i> indeed here sometimes,
  isn't it, Tory, all by myself with no one to talk to? Or, I wish&mdash;I
  wish&mdash;he would come again. Wasn't he handsome, Tory, and didn't he bear
  it bravely? Poor, poor fellow! I did so want to tell him bow sorry I was for
  him, and I couldn't. Directly I wanted to speak it all went out of my head.
  How stupid he must have thought me, Tory! Do you think he did, sir? Why don't
  you say something? I wonder&mdash;I wonder what he was thinking about when I
  looked up and saw him watching me, before he had remembered about&mdash;that!
  I believe it was something nice&mdash;I do really, Tory. I wonder how I
  looked that morning! Let me see. I had my blue frock on&mdash;the one madame
  had made for me in Paris." She went off into a day-dream. Tory, evidently
  deeply relieved at the cessation of her monologue, curled himself up with a
  satisfied snort and went off to sleep. Poor beast! He ventured to add to the
  luxury of what he doubtless considered well-earned repose by a few gentle
  snores, and he paid the penalty. One of them happened to reach his mistress'
  ears, and distracted her attention from the sweet little day-dream. The
  result was lamentable. In less than a moment poor Tory lay on his back on the
  hearth-rug, with his paws convulsively striking the air, and with a confused
  sense of having reached the ground with a haste quite out of keeping with his
  usual slow movements.</p>

  <p>"Nasty, unsympathetic brute!" exclaimed his mistress, shaking her
  skirts.</p>

  <p>Tory felt hurt, and determined to maintain his dignity. He turned his back
  upon his mistress in an offended manner, and, trotting slowly off to the
  other side of the room, ensconced himself on an unoccupied cushion.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Tory's mistress had gone back to her day-dream, and she was
  absorbed in it. Perhaps she was a very sentimental young woman to allow her
  thoughts to become so much engrossed by a few minutes' chance interview with
  a complete stranger. And yet there were excuses for her. She was only
  eighteen years old, and had just quitted a French convent, within whose
  narrow precincts the whole of her life had been spent. There had been no
  holiday for her, no visits to friends' houses, no gayety of any sort. The
  rules of the convent had not been strict enough to prohibit unrestrained
  conversation among the girls, and on the other hand were too strict to allow
  them to become acquainted with a single person outside its bounds. It was an
  ill training for a young girl, and now that comparative emancipation had
  come, no wonder that she looked back upon it almost with a shudder.</p>

  <p>Even the sweetest of day-dreams is liable to interruptions. The
  interruption to hers came in the shape of a surprise. The door opened and her
  father entered suddenly.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him in amazement. "<i>Mon père!</i> You up and dressed!
  How wrong of you that is! You will be ill again! I am sure you will."</p>

  <p>He stood just inside the door, leaning heavily upon the back of a chair.
  His face was ghastly white, and drawn as though with illness; there were dark
  rims under his hollow, brilliant eyes, and his unshaven beard and ragged,
  unkempt hair added to the wildness of his appearance. When he spoke his
  breath came in short, quick gasps, and the long, bony fingers which rested on
  the chair-back were shaking nervously.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I have been ill," he muttered dreamily. "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ill! Of course you have! Can one not see that? Why have you risen, <i>mon
  père?</i> What would the doctor say?" she exclaimed, wringing her hands in a
  gesture of despair. Then she ran to his side, forced him into a chair, and
  closed the door before she would let him speak.</p>

  <p>"What day is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Friday.</p>

  <p>"Friday?" He put his hand to his forehead, and seemed trying to recall
  something. "Friday? There as a young man came here?" he said doubtfully,
  "when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she answered, with a faint blush. "That was on Tuesday. You
  have been ill since then, you know."</p>

  <p>He groaned heavily. "I began to think&mdash;that it might have been a
  dream," he muttered despairingly; "a vision of hell! A paper, Marie; quick! A
  paper!" he cried out wildly. "Give it me."</p>

  <p>"A paper?" she repeated wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay! You know! The paper he saw! The murder, you know! I want to read
  about it! Quick, girl!"</p>

  <p>He stretched out his trembling fingers and snatched it from her. She had
  found the place, but he turned it hastily over, and after a little feverish
  search commenced reading in another part. She stood by his side, frightened,
  with the tears in her eyes. What could there be there to affect him like
  this? She could see his whole frame quivering with excitement and the
  perspiration standing out like drops of agony upon his hard, damp forehead.
  Then his head fell buried in his arms, and his frail body, wasted with recent
  illness, was shaken by great sobs.</p>

  <p>"No dream!" he gasped. "No dream! God help me!"</p>

  <p>She fell on her knees by his side, caught hold of his hands, kissed his
  forehead, wrapped her arms around him&mdash;tried all the arts of sympathy
  which her woman's heart could devise&mdash;but in vain. Nothing that she
  could say or do seemed to have any effect upon him. Only when she strove
  gently to disengage the paper from his frenzied grasp he resisted her
  fiercely, and with his long, nervous fingers tore it into strips. Finally,
  she did what perhaps was wisest&mdash;she left him altogether to himself, and
  seated herself a little distance away.</p>

  <p>It was well that she had patience. She sat there motionless, after the
  first passion of sobs had exhausted itself, for nearly an hour. Then he
  looked up at her, and she shuddered as she looked into hie white,
  agony-stricken face.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon père</i>, something terrible has happened!" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Ay, something terrible has happened," he repeated, in a hollow, far-away
  tone.</p>

  <p>He was silent for fully five minutes. Then he rose slowly to his feet. "I
  must go out."</p>

  <p>"Go out?" she almost screamed. "Why, father, what can you be thinking of?
  Didn't the doctor say, only yesterday, that you were not to move from your
  bed for a week?"</p>

  <p>"I must go out to-day&mdash;at once&mdash;though I die tomorrow," he said,
  wearily but firmly. "Get me my coat and hat, Marie, and send for a cab; my
  legs are weak; I can't walk."</p>

  <p>She strove again to turn him from his purpose. He only shook his head
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"At least tell me what this terrible thing is which has happened," she
  begged, her woman's curiosity mingled with her dread. "If it is terrible for
  you, is it not terrible for me, too? Am I not your daughter?"</p>

  <p>"You will know&mdash;perhaps," he answered. "Not now. I have no breath to
  spare. I shall need all&mdash;I have&mdash;presently. Is the cab&mdash;at the
  door?"</p>

  <p>"I have sent for it it will be here directly. Oh, <i>mon père</i> let me
  go with you," she begged. "You are not fit to go out anywhere alone."</p>

  <p>"Go with me&mdash;you!" He shuddered as though the idea hurt him. Then the
  sound of the cab stopping below reached his ears.</p>

  <p>"Give me your arm downstairs," he said. "I am a little dizzy."</p>

  <p>He needed it. At every fourth step he had to stop and rest, and his
  breathing at times almost choked him. When at last he reached the cab he sank
  into a corner and for a minute or two was too exhausted to give the driver
  any directions. Marie had gone with him bareheaded into the street, and stood
  holding his hand. But when he recovered himself he motioned her away into the
  house with an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't stand there, Marie, with no hat on. I shall be all right. Run
  into the&mdash;house&mdash;please."</p>

  <p>She left him with swimming eyes and uneasy heart. The cabman, who was
  getting impatient, put his head in at the window.</p>

  <p>"Where to, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget consulted a fragment of the newspaper which he had retained
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>"The Rising Sun, Brown Street, Bethnal Green Road. Drive fast!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-07"
     id="ch1-07">VII.&mdash;FACE TO FACE WITH THE DEAD.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Almost at the same time as the jury were sitting in
  Grosvenor Square upon the body of the Earl of Harrowdean an inquest of a very
  different character was being held in another part of London. The scene was
  the Rising Sun, Brown Street, Bethnal Green Road, and the subject of the
  inquest the body of an unknown woman found murdered in her room on the same
  night as the terrible West End murder.</p>

  <p>The mysterious murder of a peer of the realm, a great diplomatist, and one
  of the most distinguished men of the day, is a far more sensational episode
  than the murder of an unknown woman in a slum. But local interest in the less
  notorious murder was very strong indeed. The victim was almost a stranger in
  the district, but upon those with whom she had spoken or come in contact she
  had made an impression. She was not one of them, and they knew it. She had
  shared none of their vices, nor had their habits been hers. There were many
  stories floating about, and some very mysterious whispers, but they were all
  agreed upon one point. She was not one of them.</p>

  <p>The jurymen, one by one, picking their way through the filthy streets and
  elbowing a passage for themselves among the crowd of ruffianly-looking men
  and brazen-faced, unsexed-looking women who swarmed about the door of the
  Rising Sun, heard something of these rumors and felt their curiosity
  quickened. They were watched with envious eyes as they passed through the
  swing-doors and were admitted into the public-house. Perhaps they felt
  something of the same sense of added self-importance in having been selected
  for this dreary task as their fellow-jurymen in the West End had felt when
  respectfully ushered to their places by a little body of bowing
  black-liveried servants. If so, they showed little of it in their faces,
  which, to do them justice, were stolid enough. One by one they passed in and
  made their way to the sanded parlor, stained with and odorous of beer and
  smoke. Most of them were minor tradesmen in the neighborhood, and when they
  were all assembled in a group they looked as hard, and unsympathetic, and
  wooden-headed a body of men as could easily have been got together.</p>

  <p>The coroner arrived in a hansom, with a bland apology for unpunctuality,
  which was received by a sullen silence. He sank into the chair at the head of
  the table made a great show of pausing to recover his breath, and proposed
  that the proceedings should be commenced by an inspection of the body, which,
  he added, had not yet been identified.</p>

  <p>The proposition was acted upon at once. Preceded by the sergeant in charge
  of the case, the little body of men filed up a creaking wooden staircase into
  an upper room, light and clean, but barely furnished. There in the middle of
  the chamber was a plain wooden bedstead, and upon it, underneath the
  smoothly-drawn counterpane, was the outline of a human figure. With a touch
  that was almost gentle the coroner withdrew the covering and disclosed the
  face of the dead woman.</p>

  <p>The course, rough body of men who thronged around felt something akin to
  awe pierce even their toughened sensibilities. They looked over one another's
  shoulders into the calm, peaceful face of a beautiful woman instead of, as
  most of them had expected, into a vice-stained hideous countenance.</p>

  <p>The mass of golden hair which lay coiled about her pillow was tinged with
  gray, and there were lines upon her forehead; but these were small drawbacks.
  There was something, too, about the small shapely head, with its firm mouth
  and well-cut features, which was essentially thoroughbred.</p>

  <p>"It's a lady, or I never see'd one," whispered a juryman.</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of assent. A new interest in the case had been awakened
  among them. Instead of taking a hasty glance at the corpse and hurrying away
  to finish the business up, they lingered round the bedside, as though loath
  to depart. One of them lifted up her arm with clumsy reverence and silently
  pointed out to the others the plain gold wedding-ring on her delicate white
  finger. When at last they turned away they talked to one another in whispers,
  and the coroner looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Have any attempts at identification been made?" he asked the sergeant who
  was in charge of the case.</p>

  <p>"Several, sir, but all unsuccessful. Every one who came turned away at
  once after a single glance at her. Beg pardon, sir, one moment."</p>

  <p>The coroner obeyed his beckoning finger and stepped on one side. The
  sergeant drew a small parcel from his pocket, and dropped his voice to a
  mysterious pitch.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Preece, sir&mdash;that's the woman who was called in to see to
  her&mdash;found this 'ere tightly locked on the top of her arm, above the
  elbow. It's a curious spring, you see, sir, and it took her a long time to
  take it off, it was so stiff. Seems a queer place, like, for a bracelet,
  don't it, sir?"</p>

  <p>The coroner took it to the light and examined it. It was simply a plain
  gold bangle, without initials or any mark. The fastening, as the sergeant had
  remarked, was very stiff, as though it had not been often used. The coroner
  was not a romantic man&mdash;far from it&mdash;but he held the bracelet
  reverently, and indulged for a few moments in silent thought. It was a love
  token, that was very evident, and she had worn it though sorrow and distress
  and poverty, perhaps degradation; she had worn it still heedless of the fact
  that it would have brought her gold, would have brought her food and drink
  and comfort, at any rate, for a time, had she chosen to part with it.
  Doubtless it was the one solitary link which bound her to the past.</p>

  <p>"You did quite right, sergeant," he said, in a businesslike tone. "There
  is no object in keeping the discovery secret, though. It may aid toward
  identification."</p>

  <p>The sergeant saluted and followed the coroner into the sanded parlor where
  the jury were waiting. The proceedings were commenced at once, but at a very
  early stage there came an interruption.. A four-wheeled cab stopped at the
  door outside, creating no little commotion among the little crowd of idlers
  who had gathered there, and out of it a short, pale man, very much muffled
  up, was seen to descend and enter the public-house. There was a moment's
  curious pause, and then came a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," responded the coroner.</p>

  <p>A policeman entered and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir," he exclaimed, apologetically; "but there's a gentleman
  outside as thinks he can identify the body."</p>

  <p>"Very good. Take his name and address, policeman, and show him upstairs,"
  directed the coroner. "Let me know the result."</p>

  <p>The policeman closed the door and returned to the new-comer, whom he found
  sitting down on a bench outside. He repeated the coroner's directions to
  him.</p>

  <p>The stranger hesitated for a moment. Then he drew a small morocco case
  from his pocket and took out a card.</p>

  <p>The policeman held it between his thumb and fore-finger and scrutinized
  it.</p>

  <p>"M. de Feurget, 19 Craven Street. Very good, sir. Will you come this
  way?"</p>

  <p>The policeman crossed the passage and descended the narrow creaking
  stairs. The other followed slowly, holding on to the banisters with one hand
  and with the other pressed to his side. At the top of the landing he paused
  and gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me you ain't scarcely fit to be out," remarked the burly
  policeman, pityingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not&mdash;well," M. de Feurget answered. "Is that the room?"</p>

  <p>The policeman nodded, with his hand upon the handle. M. de Feurget checked
  him.</p>

  <p>"One moment. Do me&mdash;a favor, will you? Let me&mdash;go
  in&mdash;alone. You&mdash;wait for&mdash;me here."</p>

  <p>The request was backed by a solid and glittering argument, which was
  irresistible. The policeman was but human, and sovereign tips are scarce.
  Besides, there was no harm in it it wasn't even against orders. So he opened
  the door and stood aside while M. de Feurget passed in.</p>

  <p>It was twilight in the room, and at first he could see nothing but the dim
  outline of a figure stretched out upon the iron bedstead. He moved a step
  toward it, groping his way and staggering like a drunken man. Then he stopped
  suddenly, covered his face with his hands, and half turned away as though he
  dared go no further. He moved a step nearer&mdash;gazed with fascinated eyes
  at a spot on the white sheet, and wondered how it came there. Again he moved
  another step, and his fingers rested upon the coverlet which concealed the
  face. Dare he raise it? How his fingers, his knees, his whole frame, quivered
  with an unutterable horror. God! that this should be she!</p>

  <p>The hand with its wedding-ring had been left hanging down. He caught it
  passionately in his and bore it to his lips. He held it away from him, and
  looked at the blue veins and white fingers with streaming eyes. It was hers;
  he recognized it. Farewell hope! Farewell all dreams of an altered and a
  happier future! Welcome grim, black despair!</p>

  <p>Dead! Murdered! With a tenderness which no woman's touch could have
  equalled, he lifted the coverlet from her face and gazed into the still
  features. It was she. Beautiful in life, beautiful in death, beautiful
  forever in his heart. Dead or alive the last embrace should be his, and
  throwing himself down on his knees by the side of the rough bedstead he
  pressed his trembling lips to her cold forehead, and folded his arms in one
  last passionate caress around her still, lifeless form.</p>

  <p><br>
  Downstairs the coroner was growing impatient, and at last sent a messenger up
  to know how long the gentleman was going to be. M. de Feurget met him on the
  stairs and returned with him.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to say that I am not able to positively identify the deceased,"
  he announced. "She is not the person of whom I am in search.
  At&mdash;at&mdash;the same time I have seen her before."</p>

  <p>"Do you know her name?" the coroner asked. M. de Feurget shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not. I met her abroad, I believe, but where I cannot say. I
  feel some interest in this sad affair, on that account, and if&mdash;if it
  would be permitted&mdash;I should be glad to arrange for the funeral."</p>

  <p>The coroner thought that there would be no difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, sir, as you feel some interest in the matter, you would like to
  remain during the inquest," he added courteously. "Something may happen to
  refresh your memory, and any evidence as to the antecedents of the deceased
  would be very acceptable to us."</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget bowed and took the chair which was offered to him.</p>

  <p>"I should certainly like to watch the proceedings," he said, quietly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-08"
     id="ch1-08">VIII.&mdash;ANOTHER INQUEST AND ANOTHER VERDICT.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Call the first witness!" ordered the coroner sharply.</p>

  <p>The policeman threw open the door, and fixed his eyes upon a little knot
  of men and women who were whispering together in a corner of the passage.</p>

  <p>"Mike Beaston," he called, "you're wanted! Come this way."</p>

  <p>A tall, broad-shouldered man in the garb of a navvy detached himself from
  the group and came forward. The policeman solemnly beckoned him into the
  room, motioned him where to stand, and closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Mike Beaston?" inquired the coroner</p>

  <p>"I should like ter see the man as said it warn't," was the somewhat
  pugnacious reply. The witness had been preparing himself for the unaccustomed
  ordeal through which he had to pass by frequent visits to the tap-room, with
  the result that without being drunk he was inclined to be quarrelsome. But a
  glance at the coroner sent all the Dutch courage oozing out of his heels. The
  latter was used to such witnesses and knew how to treat them. He had assumed
  an air of the severest displeasure, and the frowning gaze which he bent upon
  the unfortunate Mr. Beaston was particularly disconcerting to that
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Answer simply yes or no," he remarked, sharply. "Your name is Mike
  Beaston?"</p>

  <p>"Yessur," was the much-subdued answer.</p>

  <p>"What are you by trade?"</p>

  <p>"Shure I work at anything. I ain't 'ticular. I've been on a job at Egson's
  Wharves the last month, sur."</p>

  <p>"You lodge at 19 Bloomer's Place?" asked the coroner.</p>

  <p>"For shure, yer honor," replied the witness.</p>

  <p>"And your room was on the floor above the one occupied by the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sur."</p>

  <p>"At what hour did you return home on Tuesday night, the 17th?"</p>

  <p>"Bout arf 'our arter closing time."</p>

  <p>The coroner looked up, mystified.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir. He means after the public-houses are closed,"
  interrupted P.C. 198, significantly.</p>

  <p>The coroner accepted the explanation, but promptly snubbed P.C. 198 for
  interfering, to the delight of the witness. P.C. 198 assumed a gloomy air of
  outraged dignity, and during the remainder of the examination did not open
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"Did you go straight to bed when you got home?" the coroner went on.</p>

  <p>"For shure I did; what else wur there for me to do in my bit o' a room? I
  just tumbled on my bed, and it's meself wur fast aslape in less than no time,
  yer honor."</p>

  <p>"You heard no noise in the room below?"</p>

  <p>"None, yer honor."</p>

  <p>"Nor as you passed it on your way up?"</p>

  <p>"No, sur."</p>

  <p>"Not even voices?"</p>

  <p>"Not even voices, sur. It was all as quiet as the grave."</p>

  <p>"Until what time did you sleep?"</p>

  <p>"It wur about half-past six when I woke up, and turned out straight
  away."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you saw on your way downstairs."</p>

  <p>The witness, who was now quite at his ease, ran one hand lightly through
  his hair, and after a brief pause to collect his thoughts, commenced volubly,
  but disconnectedly, to explain the circumstances which led to his being
  connected with the case as witness. He was on his way downstairs, and was
  just passing the door of the room below his when he noticed a dark stain on
  the boards, which, when he put his foot on it, he perceived was wet. He
  struck a light, and, stooping down, found to his horror that it was blood
  which was slowly trickling in a little stream from underneath the door of the
  room which he was passing.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, yer honor, I wur fair dazed, I wur, when I see'd it, and I didn't
  do nawthin' for a minute or two but look at it. Then I cum to meself, and I
  knocked at the door. 'Mrs. Ward,' sez I, 'Mrs. Ward, open the door, there's a
  good 'un;' but there warn't no answer, so I just put my foot against it,
  like, and open it went. I've seen some queer sights in my time," the witness
  continued, in an awed tone, "but that theer was a licker, and no gammon. It
  wur awful, for shure. She wur a-lying flat on the floor with her head about a
  yard off the door, and one of her hands clutched in the bed things, and there
  were a long, thin knife&mdash;a queer shape like&mdash;buried in her chest.
  The blood had flowed from where she wur stabbed right underneath the door. It
  made me feel rare and bad just to look at it. I sez, 'Minus, who's a-done
  it?' but, Lord, it warn't no use speaking to her. She wur dead as a
  door-nail, stiff, and almost cold. Well, I just felt her, and I sings out for
  Mrs. Judkin, and, be jabers&mdash;I beg your pardon, your honor&mdash;but
  there wur a rare to-do then. I just sez, 'Mrs. Judkin, here's rare goings
  on,' and she peeped in the room, and she went straight off into one of them
  there fainting fits. Then a lot of others they came in, and I off and fetched
  a doctor and a copper&mdash;this 'un here, yer honor," the witness remarked,
  indicating Police Constable 198 by a supercilious gesture. "There warn't no
  other about, so I had to bring him," he added apologetically to the jury. "I
  knowed he'd make a blooming hash of it all the same."</p>

  <p>The coroner bit his lip, and so did several of the jury. Police Constable
  198 looked scornfully indifferent, or rather tried to. Mike Beaston grinned
  and bore a sharp reprimand from the coroner with exemplary meekness.</p>

  <p>A few more questions were asked, but without result. Evidently the witness
  had told everything he knew of the affair, so he was dismissed.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Judkin is the next witness. Shall I call her, sir?" inquired Police
  Constable 198.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Judkin, the landlady? Certainly," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Judkin was called, and a plain, hard-featured woman stepped into the
  room. She was dressed in a rusty black gown, which had evidently seen better
  days, and had a shawl of the same sombre hue twisted around her shoulders.
  Unlike the last witness, she was evidently perfectly at her ease; but there
  was an air of extreme caution, not to say wariness, in the slow replies which
  she gave to the questions that were asked her which was decidedly not
  prepossessing. Before she had been before him five minutes the coroner had
  decided, rightly or wrongly, that she was keeping something back. The idea
  naturally quickened his interest in the case.</p>

  <p>"How long had the deceased been a lodger of yours?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nearly two weeks, sir."</p>

  <p>"What was her occupation during that time?"</p>

  <p>"She did no work, sir, as I know on."</p>

  <p>"She paid you regularly, then?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty well."</p>

  <p>"Did it never strike you that she was a different sort of person to your
  other lodgers, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say as it did, particular. I didn't take much notice of her."</p>

  <p>"She gave you the name of Mrs. Ward when she came?"</p>

  <p>"Yes.</p>

  <p>"Had you any reason to suppose that this was not her real name?"</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't bother my head about it. One name was as good as another to
  me."</p>

  <p>"How did the deceased pass the time if she did no work?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. How should I? I've summut else to do besides watch my
  lodgers about."</p>

  <p>"She went out occasionally, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; she went out sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Did she ever go out at night?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know as she did," the witness admitted. "She kept herself
  respectable, seemingly. She was mostways at home crying at nights."</p>

  <p>"Did she ever have any visitors?"</p>

  <p>"Never until the night she was murdered."</p>

  <p>There was a slight sensation among the jurymen. M. de Feurget, too, leaned
  forward with nervously twitching lips and bloodshot eyes. He was evidently
  deeply interested.</p>

  <p>"She had more than one visitor on that night, then?"</p>

  <p>"She had two."</p>

  <p>"Did they come together, or at different times?"</p>

  <p>"At different times."</p>

  <p>"Were they both men?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Now, tell me at what time the first one arrived."</p>

  <p>"About half-past nine."</p>

  <p>"Can you describe him?"</p>

  <p>"No, I dunno as I can. He just knocked at the door o' my room; so I sez
  'Come in,' but he didn't no more than just come half-way in like, and I wur
  a-sitting t'other end wi' a little oil lamp on the table by me, so he wur in
  the dark like. He just sez, 'Which is Mrs. Ward's rooms?' and I sez 'Second
  floor front!' and off he goes. He wur a little chap and thin&mdash;about the
  size of that there gent."&mdash;and she pointed to M. de Feurget, who frowned
  and seemed ill-pleased at the comparison.</p>

  <p>"How long did he remain upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"Not more than 'arf an hour, I shouldn't think."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear their voices?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, now and agen."</p>

  <p>"Were they talking in a loud key? Did they seem to be disagreeing?"</p>

  <p>"Summut of that sort. She wur a-sobbing and carrying on, and he wur
  terrible angry."</p>

  <p>"You didn't overhear any part of the conversation?"</p>

  <p>"No. I didn't listen."</p>

  <p>"What happened after this first visitor had left?"</p>

  <p>"Another gent came about ten minutes afterward."</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything of him? Can you describe him?"</p>

  <p>"No, that I can't. He wur tall and slim, and had a beautiful voice, but I
  couldn't see nothing of his face, he wur so muffled up. I know one thing
  about 'im, though. He wur a gent, the proper sort, too."</p>

  <p>"Did he ask you for Mrs. Ward?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I called out 'Fust door on fust landing,' and he says 'Thank'ee,'
  and off he goes."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ward's room was the one just above yours, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear them talking?"</p>

  <p>"Never once; they were very quiet."</p>

  <p>"You did not hear any quarrel or scream, or the sound of any falling
  body?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"That seems very strange. Of the two visitors, it certainly seems as
  though the last must have been the murderer. And yet you say that you did not
  even hear an ordinary quarrel?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The witness had suddenly become taciturn. She stood nervously drawing her
  shawl closer around her shoulders, and, notwithstanding the closely-set lips,
  there was an air of irresolution about her which the coroner was quick to
  notice.</p>

  <p>"Did you see this visitor when he came downstairs?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear him?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't know how long he was upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure that these answers are absolutely correct? You are on
  your oath, remember."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure."</p>

  <p>"Then you neither saw nor heard anything of deceased or of this visitor
  from the time of his arrival to the next morning, when you were summoned
  upstairs by Mike Beaston?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't."</p>

  <p>"And you will swear that Mrs. Ward had no other visitor that night?"</p>

  <p>The witness was evidently disturbed. She hesitated and changed color.</p>

  <p>"I don't know nothing about that," she answered slowly.</p>

  <p>"Have you any reason to suppose that the deceased had any other visitor
  upon, that night?"</p>

  <p>"She might 'a 'ad. It's like this, you see," the witness continued,
  reluctantly; "the room next to Mrs. Ward's I lets by the night when I gets
  the chance, and I'd let it for that night to a woman called Betsy Urane. I
  'eard her cum in 'bout two hours arter the second gent had gone up to Mrs.
  Ward's."</p>

  <p>The witness paused, and there was a little stir of interest. M. de Feurget
  was leaning forward in his seat, with his hand pressed to his side, and with
  an intense feverish excitement gleaming in his dark eyes. The witness
  remained sullenly silent, her long, bony fingers restlessly interlacing
  themselves with the fringe of her shawl. Her manner increased the supposition
  that she had something still to reveal.</p>

  <p>"Did the woman Betsy Urane come in alone?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I suppose not."</p>

  <p>"You could hear any one going upstairs from your room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you heard footsteps after the woman Urane had entered?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"The footsteps of one person or of more than one?"</p>

  <p>"There was a man and a woman."</p>

  <p>"You will swear that you did not see the man?"</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>"Did they enter the room which the woman Urane had engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And did you hear either of them leave it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Which?"</p>

  <p>"The woman."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"About five minutes after their arrival. I was going to bed, and I met her
  on the stairs, coming down."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Alone."</p>

  <p>"Where was her companion?"</p>

  <p>"She said that she had left him in the room while she went out to buy
  something."</p>

  <p>"Did she return?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen her since?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The proceedings were stayed while the coroner gave some whispered
  instructions to the constable, who immediately left the room.</p>

  <p>"Was her companion found in the room this morning?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear him leave?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Thank you; that will do, Mrs. Judkin."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Judkin gave her shawl a final twitch and left the room with an
  unmistakable air of relief in her hard, expressionless face. The coroner
  finished making some notes, and then, laying down his pen, turned to the
  jury.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for the woman Betsy Urane," he said. "I think you will all
  agree with me that she is likely to prove an important witness."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of assent which had scarcely subsided when P.C. 198
  entered the room and made his way over to the coroner's chair.</p>

  <p>"I have discovered the woman, sir," he announced, in a self-satisfied
  tone. "She is outside."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said. "Send her in at once."</p>

  <p>"Betsy Urane" was called and Betsy Urane appeared. She was a tall, stout
  woman, with a pile of yellow hair untidily arranged, coarse, unpleasant
  features, and a bold, defiant expression. She was dressed in some castoff
  finery, evidently purchased at a second-hand shop, and altogether her
  appearance could only be described as repulsive. The coroner drew a fresh
  supply of paper toward him and commenced his examination at once.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Betsy Urane?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is."</p>

  <p>"You were at 19 Bloomer's Place, on last Tuesday night, with a man?"</p>

  <p>"Well, and if I was?"</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us who your companion was?"</p>

  <p>"I would if I knowed, but I don't."</p>

  <p>"How long had you known him before taking him there?"</p>

  <p>"About an hour."</p>

  <p>"Where did you meet him?"</p>

  <p>"In the Crown and Thistle bar."</p>

  <p>"You had never seen him before, then?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak to you first, or you to him?"</p>

  <p>The witness hesitated. The coroner was used to all types of witnesses, and
  made up his mind quickly how to treat this one.</p>

  <p>"Betsy Urane," he said, sharply, "I don't know whether you have ever been
  a witness at an inquest before. In case you haven't, I feel it my duty to
  urge upon you the necessity and wisdom of speaking the truth, and of telling
  everything you know concerning the matter you are asked about. You are on
  your oath, you must remember, and you are liable to be prosecuted for perjury
  if you make a single false statement or attempt to evade the truth in any
  way. We are here to sift this matter to the bottom, and we know a good deal
  already," he added, significantly.</p>

  <p>The witness was cowed, but put a bold front on it.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for all that palavering," she said, sullenly. "I should
  have told you all I knowed wi'out. It was like this 'ere. I was a-sitting in
  the Crown and Thistle, having a glass along wi' a lady friend o' mine, when a
  stranger chap came in, and I heard 'im ask at the bar whether they knowed
  where a Mrs. Judkin lived. Well, Mrs. Judkin and me being particular friends,
  I jumps up, and goes to 'im. 'I know where Mrs. Judkin lives,' I sez. 'I has
  a room there myself often.' So he turns round and looks at me and then draws
  me on one side.</p>

  <p>"'Do you know a Mrs. Ward who lives in 'er 'ouse?' he asks. 'Can't say as
  I've ever spoken to 'er,' I sez, 'but I knows her by sight. 'Er room's next
  the one I generally 'as there.' Then he asks me some more questions about
  her, whether she wur very poor, whether she went out and such like, and I
  told him as much as I knew, and, natural like, asked him to stand summut. He
  paid for drinks, and then he went a little way off, and stood by 'imself as
  though he wur thinking something over. Just before closing time he cum back
  to me. 'Did you say that your room at Mrs. Judkin's was next to Mrs. Ward's?'
  he asked. I told 'im as it was, and he sez, quiet like, 'Could you take me
  into your room for a short time?' 'In coors,' I says, and off we went. Well,
  when we got there he made me show him her door, and when he got into my room
  he did nothing but walk up and down and mutter to himself, excited like. Then
  he comes up to me and sez, 'I want to be alone here for a short time. If I
  gives you a sovereign will you leave me this room for to-night, and find a
  lodging somewhere else?' 'In coors I will,' I sez, and I just lays 'old of
  the quid and hoff I goes. I ain't seen 'im since, and I don't know no more
  about 'im."</p>

  <p>"Can you describe him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I can; but I dunno as it 'ud be much good, for he had a false beard
  and false whiskers, and false 'air on; and I'm pretty sure he wasn't used to
  such clothes as 'e was wearing, which was rough 'uns. He wur rather stout,
  wi' a yellow beard and yellow 'air, rather a long thin face, wi' bright eyes,
  and 'e 'eld 'is 'ead as though he wur a gent, and 'e walked like one. He wur
  dressed rough enough, but 'is 'ands wur white and soft. I can't tell yer much
  more."</p>

  <p>"If you could describe his clothes a little, it might help us," said the
  coroner suggestively.</p>

  <p>"Well, he wore a long, dark blue overcoat, patched in a lot o' places, and
  wi' a hole or two in; a billycock 'at, broke at the top, and a dirty white
  'andkerchief tied round 'is throat."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure that you have not seen him in the neighborhood
  before?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take my oath I ain't."</p>

  <p>"Very good. That will do. Mrs. Urane."</p>

  <p>The witness, who had quite recovered her composure, nodded jauntily and
  swaggered out of the room. Several other witnesses, including the doctor,
  were examined without anything fresh coming to light. Then the weapon with
  which the murder had been committed was produced and handed round.</p>

  <p>The interest in the case, which had flagged a little, was revived at once
  by its appearance. It was of strange, graceful shape, of the finest Damascus
  steel, and with an elaborately carved handle. One by one the jurymen handled
  it, and each passed it on with a little murmur of admiration.</p>

  <p>"This weapon should certainly furnish a clue," the coroner remarked,
  handing it back to the emissary of the police. "It must have been stolen from
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>The man nodded, and thought that there was no doubt about that. Then there
  was a few minutes' consultation, and the verdict was recorded:</p>

  <p>"Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown."</p>

  <p>A couple of hours later printed bills with all the description which had
  been obtained of the murderer hung on the doors of every police-station in
  London, with the ominous heading: "Wanted!" and by nightfall detectives with
  a copy of the bill in their pocket-books were watching every train which
  arrived at the great ports of the country, and every outward-bound vessel of
  every sort was placed under a rigid espionage. The whole machinery of
  Scotland Yard was set in motion to discover the man in the long blue
  overcoat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-09"
     id="ch1-09">IX.&mdash;A DESPERATE WOMAN.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was midnight, and Lady Harrowdean sat alone in her room,
  leaning back in a low wicker chair and watching the fitful flames and dull
  embers of a slowly dying fire. She had dismissed her maid an hour ago, and
  since then she had been sitting there motionless and silent. At first the
  dancing firelight had played upon her pale, haggard cheeks and around her
  black-robed form and had sparkled in her dry, lustreless eyes; but now the
  flames had burned themselves out, and she sat in the shadow, almost in
  darkness. It had been a terrible hour for her&mdash;it was so still. A task
  from which she shrank with a nameless horror lay before her&mdash;inevitable,
  yet hideous. For long she had sat there battling with herself, striving to
  crush her scruples, her fears, her overmastering dread&mdash;and she had not
  succeeded.</p>

  <p>The great house was silent as the grave. From outside there came
  occasionally the noise of some passing vehicle, and at regular intervals the
  stillness of the night was broken by the deep, mellow booming of Westminster
  clock. But inside there was a tranquil silence. The servants had retired
  early; Lord Bernard earlier still. Lady Harrowdean alone kept watch of the
  night.</p>

  <p>Midnight had come and passed. The quarters had struck three times, and the
  first hour of morning was nearly over. Then Lady Harrowdean stirred slightly,
  and woke from her apathy.</p>

  <p>A lamp and a newspaper were on a small round table by her side. She turned
  the former up, adjusted the shade, and commenced to read. The paper was the
  <i>Telegraph</i>, the date the day after the inquest at the Rising Sun, and
  the paragraph which she was reading was&mdash;the account of that
  inquest.</p>

  <p>She knew it almost by heart, but she read it over again slowly, and
  stopped at one place. Always that one place! She had read it over before, and
  had stopped there each time. There seemed to be a sort of fascination for her
  in that brief disclosure by the coroner. But it was the fascination of
  terror!</p>

  <p>She put the newspaper down and rose slowly to her feet. One o'clock struck
  while she stood there hesitating, and the sound of the hour seemed to give
  her courage. She crossed the room and opened an elaborately-carved massive
  wardrobe. After a few moments' inspection she took out a long loose
  dressing-gown of some dark material, and, hastily divesting herself of her
  gown, wrapped it around her. Then she exchanged her high-heeled shoes for
  soft bedroom slippers, which sank noiselessly into the heavy carpet, and,
  recrossing the room, took up the lamp. Something of desperation seemed to
  have stolen into her white, haggard face, as she made these preparations, but
  it was desperation mixed with a great, shrinking fear. There was something to
  be done which seemed to her more awful than any other task which could have
  been set before her&mdash;something which she would have given years of her
  life to have been able to have left undone. But there was no escape, no
  second course. It must be done before morning broke.</p>

  <p>She knew it, and the knowledge gave her strength. With swift, even
  footsteps she crossed the floor, holding the lamp over her head, and, softly
  turning the handle of the door, left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-10"
     id="ch1-10">X.&mdash;IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A careless servant had turned the venetian blinds the wrong
  way, and a struggling moonbeam had forced its way into the stately
  bedchamber. Across the dark crimson carpet it cast long, trembling bars of
  light, and shone on the stiff, cold sheets of the canopied bed and on the
  ghastly face of the maxi who lay there. But it was a great room, and the poor
  little moonbeam could do no more than feebly illuminate one very small corner
  of it. The rest was wrapped in a veil of thick darkness.</p>

  <p>Silent as the dead! Silent as death! Common phrases enough, but peculiarly
  expressive. There was death in this room, death and a deep breathless
  silence. For it was the face of a corpse round which that moonbeam was
  playing. Skilful hands had bandaged his throat and had laid out his stiff,
  lifeless limbs, and Lord Alceston, Earl of Harrowdean, lay in state, waiting
  for the morrow, when his body would go to its last resting-place.</p>

  <p>Hark! A sound at last, breaking in upon the solemn stillness! A strange
  sound, too&mdash;the low rustling of a woman's skirts along the broad
  corridor. At last it ceased just outside the door; then was the stealthy
  turning of a handle, and a tall black form softly entered. The door was
  closed again. Again there was silence.</p>

  <p>She moved toward the bedside, but slowly. Long before her dark form had
  emerged from the shadows the sound of her quick, anxious breathing betrayed
  her whereabouts. At last she glided out of the darkness and stood between the
  window and the bedside, in the focus of the moonlight. The quivering beams
  played upon a face set and rigid as marble, ghastly and colorless, yet
  desperate. It was the face of the Countess of Harrowdean.</p>

  <p>She was close to the bedside now, close to the mass of odorous,
  sweet-scented flowers, whose delicate perfume hung heavily about the confined
  atmosphere&mdash;close to that white, rigid form, colorless as the damask
  sheets&mdash;most awesome, most fear-inspiring of all human sights&mdash;the
  corpse from which the last breath has parted, the last spark of life died
  out. Once those lips, now cold as clay, had burned against hers. Once those
  eyes, now closed and dim, had looked fondly into hers, now filled with a
  soft, gentle love-light, now full of passion and fire, and she had loved him!
  God! how she had loved him!</p>

  <p>Three times stooping down, until her breath fell hot upon his face, she
  stretched out her hand, and three times she withdrew it again. She turned
  away with a little moan of despair, like the last cry of a hunted animal. It
  seemed to her that her task was an impossible one. She could not touch him.
  It was sacrilege, desecration. It stirred into revolt all her emotions; she
  shrank from it as from some deed of shame, and yet&mdash;yet it must be done,
  and now. To-morrow the opportunity would have gone forever. To-morrow would
  be too late.</p>

  <p>Her hand descended again, and rested upon his arm. Ah! it was there. The
  hand which she had been holding dropped heavily from her nerveless fingers
  and fell upon the sheets with a little thud. She staggered back against the
  wall and leaned there, crouching back against it with her hands clasping her
  throbbing head and her eyes riveted upon the sheets. Her white lips moved
  slowly in a half-uttered prayer. Oh for strength, a little strength, just to
  keep her from going mad!</p>

  <p>When she moved again her limbs were stiff and her movements mechanical.
  Without hesitation she took up again his arm and turned the shirt-sleeve up
  above the elbow. The long white arm with its blue veins lay exposed to the
  moonlight, and high up something was glistening and shining in the flood of
  silvery light. Her fingers closed around it, hiding it from view. For a
  moment her whole frame shook with excitement, and' then a little sob of
  relief burst from the trembling lips. She withdrew her hand and slipped
  something into the pocket of her dressing-gown. The long white arm lay there
  still upon its bed of flowers and perfumed linen. But something had
  gone&mdash;something which had been there when that arm had flourished a
  dripping sword and waved an eager regiment on to victory&mdash;something
  which had been there when that arm had trembled with the fierce
  gesticulations of the orator who was compelling the wild tumultuous applause
  of an excited senate house&mdash;something which had been there when the arm
  which it had encircled had been pressed by royal fingers. Dangers and
  sickness, triumphs and glory, it had seen, and when the last breath had
  quitted the body, and his life had gone out like a suddenly-quenched lamp, it
  had remained. But severance had come at last.</p>

  <p>Another sound breaking the hushed silence of the sleeping house! Slight
  though it was, she heard it, and the blood in her veins ran cold as ice from
  head to foot. She trembled, and her shaking knees almost gave way beneath
  her. A footstep in the corridor! A light, firm footstep, drawing nearer and
  nearer. It stopped, and her heart gave a great throb. She clutched at the
  wall for support, shrinking back against it with reeling senses and with
  dilated eyes fixed upon the door. The handle was softly turned, a tall figure
  entered. She with the quivering moonlight shining upon her ghostly face
  convulsed with terror, he barely visible, stepping out from the deep shadows.
  Mother and son stood face to face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-11"
     id="ch1-11">XI.&mdash;GHOSTS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At first it seemed to her as though she must yield to the
  deadly faintness which was already clouding her senses. Surely this must be
  some hideous dream the Sower-strewn bed, cold and ghastly in the moonlight,
  the uncovered arm, and her son's pale questioning face, stern and sad,
  looming out of the black shadows. Was it a dream, and he a ghost? Alas! no,
  for his lips were slowly parted, and the death-like stillness was broken by
  his quick, agitated words:</p>

  <p>"Mother! You here! and&mdash;What has happened? What have you been
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"I could not rest. I came&mdash;to look at him&mdash;once more," she
  faltered.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the disarranged white garments, to the bare arm of the
  figure on the bed. He asked no questions; he simply pointed, and looked at
  her. What did it mean?</p>

  <p>Nothing which she had imagined to herself had been so awful as this. That
  she should stand face to face with him, of all people in the world, and have
  to answer that look of almost fierce inquiry. What should she do? What should
  she do?</p>

  <p>"I will tell you&mdash;presently," she gasped. "Ask me nothing now. I am
  faint. This has upset me."</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers she recovered his arm and smoothed down the
  draperies on the bed. Then she turned half-fearfully round. He was standing
  quite still, waiting for her, with a white set look on his face that made her
  heart sink. He was her son, but he would be a. hard inquisitor. What was she
  to tell him? Anything&mdash;anything but the truth!</p>

  <p>"I cannot stop&mdash;here," she said. "Take me back to my room."</p>

  <p>He stretched out his arm, and she leaned heavily upon it. Slowly they
  moved across the darkened room and gained the door. Outside, in the dimly-lit
  corridor, she seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

  <p>"It was foolish of me to come," she said in a whisper. He looked down at
  her.</p>

  <p>"You had a purpose?" Ay, a purpose! Had she not a purpose? And he was
  seeking to know it; he would try to wrest it from her. He&mdash;calm, strong,
  and self-reliant, against her&mdash;weak, shaken, and fearful. How was she to
  resist him&mdash;how to evade his questions? The thought of it made her
  shudder.</p>

  <p>They had reached the door of her room, and she had paused, hoping that he
  might go. But he only waited until she had passed in and then he followed
  her, closing the door after him. She sank wearily into her low chair and
  buried her face in her hands. He drew himself up before her and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said, "am I asking you a hard, an unreasonable thing, when I
  ask you to tell me what motive you had in going&mdash;there to-night, and
  what you had been doing? I think not. Why should there be secrets between us?
  Am I not your son, and was he not my father as well as your husband? I will
  never rest&mdash;never&mdash;until I have discovered the secret of his death.
  I have sworn it! Don't you feel like that, too? You must! Let us help one
  another in this! Our object is the same!"</p>

  <p>He ceased, and waited for an answer. None came. She kept her face hidden
  from him, buried in her hands; and he thought at first that she was weeping.
  But when she looked up he saw that the dry, burning eyes were tearless.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he went on, speaking more rapidly, "it has been a new idea to me
  altogether that there should have been any mystery or secret cloud in
  connection with&mdash;him. Yet something of the sort there must have been,
  and&mdash;forgive me&mdash;but it seems to me that you must have
  known&mdash;must know&mdash;a little of it. What does it all mean? Neillson's
  flight, your strange manner, and your visit to his room alone, and at this
  hour? If you know anything at all&mdash;and you must know a good
  deal&mdash;why not tell me and help me to gain a clue? Surely you cannot wish
  his murderer to escape? God forbid!"</p>

  <p>"It may be better so," she murmured. "Can you doubt but that God will
  punish?"</p>

  <p>"That is what you said before, mother," he answered, "and I tell you again
  that God's punishment would be too slow for me. I cannot rest while this
  thing remains undiscovered."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Has it never occurred to you that this secret may be one which it were
  best the world did not know?" she said, softly.</p>

  <p>"In telling me you are not telling the world," he answered. "Whatever it
  was, I am his son and I have a right to know it. I am his avenger, and I will
  know it."</p>

  <p>She looked at him calmly. Sooner or later this must be faced. Better now,
  perhaps, than at any other time.</p>

  <p>"Never from me," she said, in a low firm tone.</p>

  <p>He looked at her astonished.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean this, mother?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will tell me nothing? You mean that though what you
  know might bring his murderer to justice, you will still keep it to
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I do, Bernard. If at this moment I could see before me your father's
  murderer I would let him go in peace. I would not touch him. If he were
  alive, I am sure that he would rather that it should be so."</p>

  <p>His lips quivered with disappointment, and a little, too, with anger. His
  mother's words only irritated him. Weak, feminine folly! What else was it? A
  milk-and-water doctrine of forgiveness that found no favor in this man's
  heart. His purpose was not shaken a jot.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what you were doing in his room to-night?" he asked. "At
  least I ought to know this, as I found you there."</p>

  <p>"No. I cannot."</p>

  <p>He turned his back upon her and walked to the door. She followed him with
  her eyes softened now and full of sad, wistful light. He was her son, her
  only son, and she loved him. Surely he would not leave her thus!</p>

  <p>"Bernard," she cried, "you are not going away without even wishing me
  good-night!"</p>

  <p>He paused with his hand on the door-knob.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good-night, mother," he said, coldly, without turning round;
  and he left her.</p>

  <p>The tears which had so long been denied to her came at last. She threw
  herself upon the bed in a passionate fit of weeping, and her whole frame was
  shaken by tumultuous sobs. When daylight streamed into the room and fell upon
  her haggard, grief-stained face, she was then still, exhausted, sleeping a
  troubled sleep.</p>

  <p>The early morning sounds in the street below awakened her, and she rose
  and commenced moving restlessly about the room. Every now and then she
  stopped and pressed her hands to her burning forehead. Had ever woman to bear
  up against such misery as hers? she wondered. Surely not! Surely not! To the
  agony of her great loss was added now an overwhelming hideous dread. Slowly,
  but with a ghastly distinctness, the last night's scene in the death-chamber
  passed before her reeling brain! He had discovered her! He had asked her that
  question&mdash;that one question which she would never dare to answer. He had
  left her in anger, in anger none the less terrible because it was so cold, so
  self-contained. He suspected her, perhaps&mdash;of what, she dared not think.
  Was it not for his sake as well as hers that she was fighting this battle?
  And she could not show him why I She could not show him why it were
  better&mdash;a thousand times better&mdash;to let his father's murder go
  unavenged&mdash;to let the whole terrible tragedy sink into the still waters
  of oblivion! She had lost her husband, and now she was to lose her son! What
  had she done, or left undone&mdash;wherein had she sinned, that Fate should
  deal with her so cruelly?</p>

  <p>The morning stole on and the distant sounds of the awakening household
  reached her ears. For the first time she realized that night had come and
  gone and as yet her bed had been unslept in. Soon her maid would be coming
  with her tea and would notice it&mdash;would talk and gossip about it
  below&mdash;the one thing which it was most necessary to avoid. Wearily she
  stood up, disrobed herself, and crept within the sheets. She had no hope of
  sleep, nor did it come to that. How was it possible with so sore a heart and
  burning a brain as hers?</p>

  <p>When Marie, her ladyship's French maid, softly entered the room about half
  an hour later and brought the dainty tea equipage to the side of the bed, she
  was shocked beyond measure to see the feverish light in her mistress'
  wide-open eyes and the terrible ravages which a single night had made in her
  face. With her little hands stretched out, and her shoulders almost on a
  level with her ears, she was not slow to express her consternation.</p>

  <p>"Ah! but your ladyship is ill," she exclaimed, volubly. "<i>Tres
  malade</i>. Miladi has had no sleep! Ah! <i>quel dommage, quel dommage!</i>"
  she added, in a tone of deep commiseration.</p>

  <p>Lady Harrowdean took her tea and made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Not that any of us have had much sleep," Marie continued in a hushed
  whisper, with a half fearful, altogether mysterious glance around. "<i>Moi
  même</i>&mdash;as for myself, my eyes have been not once closed. It was not
  possible. Did your ladyship hear anything&mdash;anything strange in the
  night?"</p>

  <p>Lady Alceston set her cup down and shook her head. Her hand was trembling
  so much that she could hold it no longer.</p>

  <p>"No, I heard&mdash;no sound. Nothing."</p>

  <p>"There were some strange, oh, such strange noises," Marie continued in an
  awed tone, and with appropriate gestures. "Several of us heard them. Myself,
  I was so frightened that I did draw the bedclothes close around my ears and
  did very nearly shriek. Ah, but it was horrible!" and she wound up with an
  effective little shiver, as though the memory of her fright were still
  oppressing her. Her ladyship turned her face upon her pillow and closed her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Draw the curtains around the bed, Marie," she directed. "I shall try to
  sleep for an hour or two."</p>

  <p>"It would be well for miladi," Marie murmured, as she obeyed. The bed was
  a French one, and Lady Alceston was now invisible&mdash;out of sight of the
  tell-tale rays of sunlight and the black, questioning eyes of her maid.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Marie," she said, as her maid was gliding softly from the
  room. "What sort of noises were those that you heard, and in what part of the
  house? I hope that no thieves have been about."</p>

  <p>Marie paused and advanced again toward the bed, side, glad to have an
  opportunity of resuming the subject.</p>

  <p>"Footsteps and muffled voices, your ladyship," she said impressively, "and
  in the long corridor too, near&mdash;near&mdash;the room where his lordship
  is. Thomas has searched in every place, <i>ce matin</i>, but there are no
  signs of any one having entered the house, and nothing is missing. We all
  thought that your ladyship must have heard them too, and we dreaded every
  moment that we should hear your ladyship's bell."</p>

  <p>There was no sound from the bed for a few moments. Then her ladyship
  answered in a slow, deliberate tone:</p>

  <p>"Foolish girls! you imagined it all. I was awake all night, and I heard no
  noises of any sort. There could have been nothing to cause them."</p>

  <p>Marie was perfectly unconvinced, but dared express her dissent in no other
  way than by a shrug of her shapely shoulders and a most suggestive silence.
  Her ladyship, who was watching her through a chink in the curtains,
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"If I hear anything more of this, Marie," she said quietly, "you or any
  one else who mentions it will leave my service at once. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>Marie arched her black eyebrows. She was surprised, but she was too well
  trained a servant to show it. Miladi's wishes should be obeyed, she murmured.
  The subject should not be mentioned again by her, or by any one else if she
  could help it. At what hour would miladi please to rise?</p>

  <p>Miladi made no reply. Her thoughts were otherwise engaged. A certain act
  of imprudence had just occurred to her.</p>

  <p>"Marie," she said abruptly, "there is a newspaper in my rocking-chair. I
  want it."</p>

  <p>Marie searched and shook her head. There was no newspaper there.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, in the pocket of my dressing-gown," the mistress ordered
  sharply.</p>

  <p>Marie took up the garment, shook out the folds, and felt in the pockets.
  They were empty.</p>

  <p>"Then it must be on the floor by the side of the chair," her ladyship said
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>Marie went down on her hands and knees, and looked about in all
  directions. Again her search was unsuccessful. There was no paper anywhere
  about. She rose with flushed face, and with her coquettish little white apron
  all crumpled, and made her report.</p>

  <p>"Bring me my dressing-gown at once," ordered her mistress, in a strange,
  sharp tone.</p>

  <p>Marie obeyed, wondering, but in silence. She saw with surprise that her
  mistress' hands were trembling, and that she seemed deeply agitated. They
  searched about together for a few minutes, but in vain. The paper was
  gone.</p>

  <p>Lady Harrowdean was the first to abandon the search. Marie followed her
  example at once with a little sigh of relief. She stood before the glass for
  a moment to straighten her cap and hair. Behind her own face there she saw
  that of her mistress, and its ghastly expression frightened her.</p>

  <p>"Miladi is ill," she exclaimed, turning quickly round.</p>

  <p>"I am a little faint, Marie," was the answer. "Help me into bed."</p>

  <p>Marie did so, keeping up at the same time a running fire of
  half-admonitory, half-consolatory chatter. Miladi had overtaxed her strength.
  She must have quiet and rest or she would not be able to attend the funeral.
  It was foolish to have got out of bed and upset herself about a newspaper.
  Thomas should go out and get another one. Would miladi say what newspaper it
  was and what date she required?</p>

  <p>Lady Alceston made no reply. She seemed not to have heard&mdash;certainly
  she did not heed her maid's sympathizing remarks. When she had finished she
  said simply:</p>

  <p>"Tell Thomas to go to Lord Bernard's room, and ask him to come to my
  dressing-room for a minute. I wish to speak to him."</p>

  <p>Marie withdrew with her head in the air, a little offended. Miladi was
  making a great fuss about a paltry newspaper; and fancy sending for Lord
  Bernard at this hour in the morning! It was too ridiculous.</p>

  <p>She descended into the servants' hall, and delivered her message to
  Thomas. Instead of obeying her orders he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Tain't no use, my dear," he said patronizingly. "Lord Bernard is
  hout."</p>

  <p>Marie stamped her little foot impetuously.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Gone out, at this time of the morning! You are too lazy to go
  and see, you&mdash;you&mdash;<i>gros bête!</i>"</p>

  <p>Thomas grinned and sat down to his breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Go it, mademoiselle," he said. "Call me all the names in your heathen
  calendar, if you like. It don't hurt me. I rather like it."</p>

  <p>Marie tossed her head, and looked at him with flashing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to obey miladi, and deliver her message to Lord Bernard?"
  she asked threateningly.</p>

  <p>"No, my dear, I am not," Thomas answered, crossing his legs and sipping
  his coffee slowly.</p>

  <p>"And why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't know where to find him."</p>

  <p>"He is in his room. He never rises before nine."</p>

  <p>"Well, he has done so this morning, at any rate," Thomas remarked. "As I
  said before, he has gone out. I ought to know, for I let him out myself."</p>

  <p>"Out at this time in the morning! Why didn't you tell me so before, then,
  stupid?"</p>

  <p>She stamped her foot at him and whisked out of the room. Thomas leaned
  back in his chair and looked after her admiringly.</p>

  <p>"What a little spitfire she is," he soliloquized. "Wonder what her
  ladyship wants Lord Bernard for so early. Seems queer! And his going out,
  too, and them noises in the night. Dashed if it don't seem very queer!"</p>

  <p>And he would have thought it queerer still if he could have heard the low,
  muffled cry which broke from Lady Alceston's white lips, after Marie had
  delivered her message and departed.</p>

  <p>"He has seen it!" she moaned. "He has gone there. Oh! if he
  should&mdash;if he should&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-12"
     id="ch1-12">XII.&mdash;AN EAST-END FUNERAL.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two men, both young, but very dissimilar in appearance, were
  making their way through the purlieus of one of London's worst slums. It was
  a fine, bright morning, and away westward toward Piccadilly and in Hyde Park
  the cheerful influence of the warm, glowing sunlight was very apparent in the
  smiling faces and light dresses of the gay throngs who passed up and down the
  broad streets. But here things were very different; here the dancing sunlight
  could do little toward chasing away the gloom and squalor of the narrow
  streets and filthy courts. Nay, into some of them it could scarcely penetrate
  at all, and-where it did it shone with a ghastly light on things that were
  better left in darkness&mdash;on the vice-stained, brutal faces of degraded,
  lounging men; on women from whose hard, brazen faces all the grace and charm
  of womanhood seemed stamped out; on children with the pinched, withered
  countenances of old men. Yet something of its influence had penetrated even
  here. The men dragged themselves to the doors of their miserable houses, and
  smoked their pipes in stolid silence on the threshold; the children strayed
  from the fetid courts into the open streets to play, and the toilers in the
  attics opened wide their windows, and looking up to the blue sky forgot for a
  moment their weary struggle for existence, and dreamed of other days.</p>

  <p><br>
  To one of the two young men his surroundings were strange; to the other they
  were very familiar. The one, therefore, walked steadily on with a shocked
  expression in his handsome face, and with the evident air of trying not to
  look about him. The other, on the contrary, appeared perfectly at his ease,
  and looked about him, frequently throwing keen, observant glances out of his
  bright eyes into the faces of the little knots of men who lounged, about
  outside the public-houses and at the street corners. The former, Lord Bernard
  Alceston, in his deep mourning, a noticeable figure anywhere, looked as
  completely out of his element, and as incongruous with his surroundings, as a
  man well could; the latter, Stephen Thornton, journalist, Bohemian, and, as
  he was fond of styling himself, adventurer, might have passed through the
  whole of Whitechapel without attracting a single glance.</p>

  <p>"Is the place we are going to in a part as bad as this?" Lord Alceston
  asked, with a little shudder.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think it is, quite," his companion answered. "Brown Street is
  quite on the outskirts of this region. But there are parts of London worse
  than this, you know&mdash;much worse."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have believed it possible."</p>

  <p>Thornton smiled a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No I dare say not," he answered. "You are born and bred in selfishness,
  you aristocrats. You never take the trouble to look outside the little world
  in which you live. Why should you? Jove! if there's a hell, how it will be
  peopled with those of your class!"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston shrugged his shoulders. He had known Thornton for many
  years, and was used to such talk from him.</p>

  <p>"Radical as ever, Steve," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Ay, my lord, as Radical as ever. Radical, Communist, Socialist,
  Nihilist&mdash;what you will."</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as that, Steve, I think," Lord Alceston answered, letting his
  arm rest for a moment on the other's shoulder. "You would make yourself out
  an ogre, whereas I know you to be one of the tenderest-hearted men
  alive."</p>

  <p>"Not so bad! Alceston, I tell you this," Thornton answered almost roughly.
  "I'd rather, a thousand times rather, be known and branded as the very worst
  of these than be what you are."</p>

  <p>"We'll change the subject, I think," Lord Alceston suggested.</p>

  <p>"Agreed. You think this bad, do you?" Thornton continued, glancing around.
  "I don't know what you would say if you came here at night, then. The place
  is asleep now. Toward midnight it will wake up, and then, if you like, it's a
  sight to make a man feel sick. But, I forgot. What do you care about such
  things?&mdash;and here we are in Brown Street. The Rising Sun is about a
  couple of hundred yards up on the other side of the road."</p>

  <p>They paused at the corner, and Lord Alceston looked around him. The street
  into which they had turned was much wider and the houses less squalid than in
  the neighborhood which they had just quitted. But it was still a miserable
  locality. The long rows of small, semidetached houses were smoke-begrimed and
  blackened with dirt, and their dreary appearance was heightened by the
  wretchedly-bare handful of earth or gravel in front of each&mdash;courtesy
  could not call it a garden&mdash;and the broken railings. The street itself
  was strewn with the refuse from the green-grocers' shops, which seemed to be
  at every corner not occupied by a public-house. There was a 'dreary,
  poverty-stricken appearance about the whole place&mdash;the very quintessence
  of suburban nastiness. To Lord Alceston, who was no dweller in cities, and
  who had spent most of his time either in the country or in the most
  picturesque of continental towns, its ugliness was a painful revelation. He
  always looked back upon that walk with feelings almost of horror.</p>

  <p>A little way down the street, as though to put the finishing touch to the
  dreariness of the scene, a humble funeral <i>cortége</i> stood waiting.
  Thornton saw it, and stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"We're too late," he said quietly, knitting his brows. "That is the Rising
  Sun where that hearse is standing. Evidently they are burying her
  to-day."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston looked across the road with a heavy frown. He was young and
  unused to failure, and he had made up his mind that he would look into that
  dead woman's face. His companion, whose private opinion was that they were on
  a wild-goose chase, shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"We must bear it philosophically," he said. "By the by, how comes it, I
  wonder, that the parish is not burying her? She left neither friends nor
  money, it was said, yet some one has evidently undertaken the funeral."</p>

  <p>"Suppose we go and inquire?" Lord Alceston suggested, moving forward.</p>

  <p>Thornton laid his hand on his arm and checked him.</p>

  <p>"No, stay here a minute. They must pass this Way, and we can see who is
  inside. We can make inquiries afterward."</p>

  <p>They stood on the edge of the pavement for nearly five minutes. Then the
  coffin was carried out, and the modest little cavalcade started.</p>

  <p>"Go down that street a little way," Thornton said quickly. "You mustn't be
  seen here at all. It doesn't matter about me, and I shall be able to see
  who's inside."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston, too, was curious, and he hesitated. But, after all,
  doubtless it was sound advice. He had better go.</p>

  <p>He had scarcely gone a dozen yards down the by-street into which he had
  turned when he heard the little procession passing along the top. He had not
  meant to turn round&mdash;in fact, he had made up his mind that he would
  not&mdash;it was a case of impulse triumphing over reason. He turned suddenly
  back and looked.</p>

  <p>He had chosen exactly the right moment. Thornton was standing a little way
  in the road, as though he had been in the act of crossing and was waiting for
  the carriages to go by. But it was not on him that Lord Alceston's eyes
  rested. Something else there was that had changed his half-curious,
  half-careless glance into a rapt, breathless gaze, and which had set his
  heart beating fast and his pulses throbbing. From where he stood he could
  just distinguish the faces of the two people seated side by side in the
  solitary mourning coach. One&mdash;the one nearest to him&mdash;was the dark,
  handsome face of the girl whom he had found in the room with him in Craven
  Street after his swoon; the other was her father, the man with whom he had
  travelled up from Dover on the same day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-13"
     id="ch1-13">XIII.&mdash;HER LAST VISITOR.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For several moments after the carriage had passed out of
  sight Lord Alceston stood still on the pavement lost in astonishment. Then he
  slowly retraced his steps and met Thornton coming toward him.</p>

  <p>"There's something I don't quite understand about this," said the latter,
  musingly. "The woman is unidentified, friendless, penniless, and without
  relations. Yet she's being buried at some one's expense, and some one who has
  a bit of money, too, for although there was only one mourning carriage
  everything was turned out in uncommonly nice style&mdash;not at all like an
  East-End funeral&mdash;and that some one, with a very well-dressed young
  lady, goes to the funeral too. That seems queer."</p>

  <p>"We had better go to the place where they brought her from&mdash;the
  public-house&mdash;and make inquiries," Lord Alceston suggested. He had
  recovered from his surprise by this time, and had not yet made up his mind
  whether he should tell Thornton that he had recognized the occupants of the
  mourning coach.</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I propose to do," Thornton remarked. "But you mustn't
  think of coming," he added, as Lord Alceston turned round as though to
  accompany him.</p>

  <p>"And why not?"</p>

  <p>"Why not, indeed! Can't you see? Supposing you were recognized, which is
  not at all unlikely, what would people think about the Earl of Harrowdean
  being down in these parts making left-handed inquiries about this unknown
  murdered woman? And, besides, you are not fit for this sort of work,
  Alceston, if you will excuse my saying so. I should never get any information
  out of any one with you at my side listening."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston was a young man who was fond of action, and he by no means
  liked abandoning the enterprise in this way.</p>

  <p>"I'd much rather go with you, Thornton," he protested. "I don't see that I
  should make much difference."</p>

  <p>"I do, and I know more about such matters than you. If I'm to do any good
  in this matter, Alceston, I must have my own way in this. The best thing you
  can do is to go home, and I'll come round and see you to-night, and tell you
  all about it&mdash;if there's anything to tell."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston shrugged his shoulders and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Very well; I suppose I must give in," he said. "It's ridiculous to
  suppose that any one down here would know me; but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, it isn't anything of the sort," Thornton interrupted quickly.
  "You forget that Scotland Yard has some little interest in this matter. I'm
  not much of a sporting man, but I wouldn't mind betting you long odds that
  there will be at least one detective hanging round the Rising Sun. Any one
  who goes there making even the most casual inquiries about the murdered woman
  will be a marked man at once. That doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned,
  because I happen to be a reporter; but if you were there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, Thornton. I'm afraid you're right. I'll go. But don't forget
  to look me up to-night!"</p>

  <p>Thornton nodded, and watched him until he was out of sight; then he
  crossed the road and entered the Rising Sun. As he had expected, it was
  nearly full of curious gossippers standing around the bare marble counter and
  seated on the benches which lined the walls. It was a motley scene, and
  difficult for an outsider to look upon without a shudder. But Thornton,
  though his quiet glance round had taken in at once the whole character of the
  place, sat slowly sipping his brandy-and-water with all the careless
  stolidness of a <i>habitué</i> of the place. No one there could have guessed
  that that quiet, insignificant-looking man who sat there with half-closed
  eyes was listening with sharpened senses and never-ceasing vigilance to every
  question and answer, to every chance remark and opinion which was bandied
  about him. He had not asked a single question or betrayed in any way the
  least curiosity about the subject which was being so fiercely discussed. He
  had come to the conclusion that he would in all probability learn more by
  sitting quite still and listening than by asking questions: And he was
  right.</p>

  <p>What he heard soon stimulated an interest which had not previously been
  very keen. He had read of this murder, and had dismissed it from his mind as
  one of a certain type with no special features about it. Probably he would
  have forgotten all about it had it not been for Lord Alceston, an old
  schoolfellow and fellow-member of a certain Bohemian club, one of whose
  unwritten rules it was that among the members there should be a certain
  mutual aid society, a give-and-take of such services as one had it in his
  power to render the other. Stephen Thornton had a certain notoriety of his
  own as a powerful writer of extreme Radical views, and as a man who, <i>rara
  avis</i>, etc., was very much in earnest about his politics. But apart from
  this, he was noted as a lover of strange adventures of the genuine Bohemian
  type and as a wonderful amateur detective. So, after much trouble, thought
  and deliberation, Lord Alceston, remembering certain services which he had
  once been able to render this man, went to him at his rooms late on the day
  of his father's funeral and asked for his aid.</p>

  <p>This was the case, he said, briefly put. On the same night, and within a
  few hours of the time of his father's murder, a nameless woman had been
  murdered in an obscure part of London. Something there was&mdash;he could not
  say what&mdash;which seemed to faintly suggest the idea of some connection
  between the two murders. He could not take his information to Scotland Yard.
  Scotland Yard would want to know more than he was willing to tell. This
  circumstance, slight though it was, was one which he would not on any account
  risk letting the newspapers get hold of. He would not tell it to Scotland
  Yard; he would not even tell it to the man whose aid he was asking. That was
  the case. Would Thornton help him? All he wanted was if possible to see the
  face of the murdered woman and learn something of her antecedents. Alone he
  knew not how best to set about doing this. Would Thornton help him, by his
  advice or in any other way?</p>

  <p>Thornton had promised to help readily enough. It his own mind he had at
  once set the idea down as preposterous. But he had asked no questions, and he
  had given no opinion. Simply, on starting out he had put down their errand as
  a wild-goose chase, and had felt no interest in it beyond the desire to
  render a service to his friend.</p>

  <p>As he sat in the sanded drinking-bar of the Rising Sun, however, his ideas
  began to change. He began to get interested. This affair had features in it
  of which he had been ignorant. Most of his previous conclusions were
  evidently erroneous. He cleared his mind of them and began to consider the
  matter from an altogether different point of view.</p>

  <p>In the first place the woman, notwithstanding her surroundings,
  notwithstanding her evident poverty, had in one particular always maintained
  her self-respect. No one had ever seen her speak to a man, no one had ever
  heard her speak of them, save with contempt. Yet on the night of her tragical
  death three men had visited her one after another&mdash;the first time that
  such a thing had ever happened; and one of these must have been her murderer.
  Of no one of them had any accurate description been given. All three were
  strangers to the neighborhood, and at least two were, at any rate from the
  landlady's point of view, gentlemen.</p>

  <p>The conversation veered round to her appearance and probable antecedents.
  Concerning the former there were different opinions, the men mostly taking
  one side and the women the other. But apart from the actual question of good
  looks, all were agreed upon one point&mdash;she was not of their class. Her
  hands and feet, the poise of her head, and her manner of speech, were all
  commented upon. The latter was almost foreign to them, but they knew the ring
  of it. She had been a lady, and while she had lived they had hated her for
  it. Even now some of the women uttered brutal sneers when they spoke of it.
  She had been no better than she should have been, or how had she drifted
  there among them? Curse her and the likes of her.</p>

  <p>There were endless repetitions, maunderings, and quarrels. Now and then
  there was a blow struck, and the combatants, screaming and cursing with
  horrible oaths, were ejected to "have it out" outside. The main subject was
  sometimes quitted for the retailing of some filthy yarn, greeted with shrieks
  of hideous laughter from the women, but in the end some new arrival always
  brought it back again into the old channel. And Stephen Thornton sat there
  still, slowly sipping brandy-and-water, and with half-closed eyes and hands
  stuck deep in his pockets affecting the maudlin state of a half-drunken
  man.</p>

  <p>A new-comer started a point which Thornton had already labelled in his
  mind as important. Who was the man who had had her buried? Why hadn't the
  parish buried her? She had died without money. Who had found the "brass" for
  the funeral?</p>

  <p>There were plenty ready to answer. It was a man who had come to try and
  identify her, and had recognized her face as that of a lady whom he had once
  seen abroad. He did not even know her name. He knew nothing about her in
  fact. He had been struck with her appearance and had offered to have her
  buried decently. That was all.</p>

  <p>Thornton weighed it over in his mind. Had it been a man of whom he had
  known nothing he might after inquiry have believed it. But it so happened
  that although he had not mentioned the fact to Lord Alceston, the man in the
  mourning coach was no stranger to him. He thought it over deliberately, and
  he came to this conclusion&mdash;that Monsieur de Feurget knew more, much
  more, about this woman than he chose to tell the world. Perhaps he was one of
  those three visitors; perhaps even he himself was concerned in the murder. At
  any rate he was a person to be watched, to be suspected, through whom a clew
  might eventually be obtained. The conversation surged on, and every now and
  then Thornton heard things which interested him. There was not one there who
  could say that she or he had ever even exchanged a word beyond the most
  casual remark with the murdered woman; but there was some one, it seemed, who
  had been almost friendly with her, who, more than one hinted, knew something
  of her past and of her real position. At last the name was
  mentioned&mdash;Sall Greenwood&mdash;and Thornton betrayed the fact of his
  being a listener by a slight start, which, fortunately for him, no one
  noticed. Sall Greenwood and Monsieur de Feurget! Here was something to work
  upon. Thornton's interest was growing rapidly.</p>

  <p>The man with the yellow beard and the long coat was brought up and eagerly
  discussed. Every one had something to say about him, but there was only one
  woman who could declare definitely that she had seen him. She had been in the
  Crown and Thistle when he had entered, and she had seen him talking to Betsy
  Urane, and she had seen him, she declared with a whole string of vehement
  oaths designed to crush incredulity, about twenty minutes before his arrival
  at the Crown and Thistle, coming out of a ready-made clothes shop, at the
  corner of the street. Her description of him was very much the same as Betsy
  Urane's. He was short, roughly dressed, with a light, flowing beard, and most
  of his face smothered up with a blue handkerchief. He had spoken and walked
  like a gentleman, and had seemed free with his money.</p>

  <p>Presently a woman, seeing that Thornton's eyes were wide open, came and
  seated herself beside him. With an effort he overcame his instinctive
  repulsion, and did not discourage her presence. There was something which he
  wished to find out, and she might be useful. He even answered her coarse
  greeting in kind, and made room for her on the bench.</p>

  <p>"Any objections to a drink wi' yer, guvnor?" she inquired engagingly.</p>

  <p>"No, I'll stand you one," he answered roughly. "I'll have another myself,
  too. It's dry work listening to all this gabble."</p>

  <p>The drinks were ordered and brought. While his companion sipped hers
  approvingly Thornton looked her over. She was only an ordinary woman of her
  class, with a stupid, sensual face, without a single gleam of intelligence.
  There was no risk in questioning her, he decided.</p>

  <p>"Did you know this woman they're making such a fuss about?" he
  commenced.</p>

  <p>"No, nor didn't want to. A stuck-up wench she was."</p>

  <p>"Seems a rum 'un, that she shouldn't have had a single pal," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"She 'ad. She used to go and see Sall Greenwood. I've seen 'em
  together."</p>

  <p>"Who's she? Is she here?"</p>

  <p>"Here! not she! She's too fine to come to such like place. She's a
  &mdash;&mdash; little French tailoress, that's what she is, in Crane's
  Court."</p>

  <p>He had got what he wanted now, and his only anxiety was to get rid of the
  woman beside him. He feigned to return again to his semi-somnolent state, and
  half closed his eyes. But she did not go. Presently he felt her hot, foul
  breath close upon his cheek, and immediately afterward a tug at his
  pocket-handkerchief. He let it go, hoping to get rid of her, but he was
  disappointed. Instead she commenced softly feeling for his watch. He shook
  her off and sat up.</p>

  <p>The dull red angry color flushed into her cheeks. She had had too much to
  drink, and was inclined to be quarrelsome.</p>

  <p>"It's my belief as you was only a-shamming!" she cried angrily. "You ain't
  been to sleep at all. You're &mdash;&mdash; a spy, that's what you are. I've
  been a-watching o' yer. I say, you chaps," she called out at the top of her
  voice, "here's a nobbler 'ere. Look at 'im. He's been a-shamming sleep,
  that's what he's been a-doing. He's a &mdash;&mdash; spy, a &mdash;&mdash;
  nobbler."</p>

  <p>There was a low howl of drunken rage from a dozen throats, and shrill
  shrieks from the women. They made at him like wild beasts. The tables were
  overthrown, the woman who had pointed him out missed her footing and was
  trampled under foot. But when they looked for Stephen Thornton he had
  vanished.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-14"
     id="ch1-14">XIV.&mdash;MOTHER AND SON.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The funeral of the Earl of Harrowdean had been a great
  function. Statesmen of the highest rank and reputation had followed the
  deceased peer to the grave. Deputations from all classes of society had
  begged for leave to attend, and the most exalted personage in the state had
  herself been represented by a near kinsman. England's most eloquent and
  learned prelate had pronounced a eulogy over his grave which had left
  scarcely a dry eye among the whole of that vast assemblage, and which had
  made, the hearts even of strangers burn and throb with indignation against
  the cold-blooded assassin whose midnight crime had taken such a life. As a
  statesman, a philanthropist, a nobleman, and a Christian, the Earl of
  Harrowdean was held up as an example to his order and to all men. The names
  of those who pressed upon the bereaved widow and her only son their
  respectful, heartfelt sympathy included the names of all the noblest in the
  land, and the wreaths which poured in from Covent Garden, from the country,
  and even from foreign royalty, made the air of the great cathedral heavy with
  the perfume, and formed such a collection of floral offerings as had rarely
  before been seen.</p>

  <p>When all was over, and the mortal remains of the Earl of Harrowdean had
  been placed under the earth, the public mind began to turn from sympathetic
  grief to strong resentment. The murderer must be discovered, must be hunted
  down, or the prestige of the English police was gone forever. All
  speculations as to his personal identity were put a stop to by Neillson's
  flight and continued absence. It could bear but one construction&mdash;guilt.
  Neillson was the name in every one's mouth who talked about the murder at
  all. Neillson was clearly and undoubtedly the murderer. Neillson must be
  discovered.</p>

  <p>At first Scotland Yard had been very confident about the matter. His
  apprehension, it gave out, was only the matter of a few hours. He had had too
  brief a start to make his escape. Every railway-station in London and every
  port in Great Britain was watched by tried detectives, and to have shown
  himself at any of them must have been instantly fatal, however good his
  disguise. A cordon of police was drawn around the little house in Holloway
  where a married sister of his was known to live. His description hung in
  every police-station and had been flashed all over England along the
  telegraph wires. A photograph was discovered among his effects, and in an
  incredibly short space of time a thousand were issued and distributed. The
  numbers of the missing notes drawn by the Earl of Harrowdean from his bank on
  the morning of his murder were in every bank manager's hands, and were on the
  bills which announced him as "wanting." Scotland Yard laughed at the idea of
  failure. Its plans were perfect.</p>

  <p>But a day passed, two days, three days, and as yet nothing had been done.
  The day of the funeral had come and gone; and on the day after&mdash;the day
  of Lord Alceston's visit to his friend Thornton&mdash;a fresh placard was
  circulated throughout the country and hung upon every wall and hoarding in
  London. Lord Alceston had taken his friend's advice and followed his own
  inclination. He had offered one thousand pounds reward for the apprehension
  of Philip Neillson.</p>

  <p>This had been done on the morning of his visit to the Bethnal Green Road;
  in the afternoon, after his return home, he was told that his mother wished
  to speak to him. He went straight to her room.</p>

  <p>She rose to greet him, a tall, stately figure in her deep crape dress and
  widow's garb. Even her son, who was preparing for the battle which he knew
  was coming, could not restrain a thrill of admiration as he looked at her.
  She was still a beautiful woman. At forty-five&mdash;she could scarcely be
  less&mdash;she could still hold her own against women many years her
  junior.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston admired his mother, admired her very much indeed. With what
  other feelings he regarded her, however, he scarcely himself knew. Their
  relations had always been the relations of a society mother to a society son.
  They had been on friendly terms always, but then there had never been either
  occasion or opportunity for difference. At that moment, as she rose to meet
  him and they stood face to face in the dusky twilight of the darkened room,
  he had almost forgotten that she was his mother. The one thought in his mind
  was that this woman had some dim, secret knowledge&mdash;perhaps not
  knowledge, but at any rate suspicion&mdash;which she was refusing to share
  with him. It never occurred to him to suspect her of the least complicity in
  his father's murder, of any actual knowledge of the guilty persons; but still
  she knew something which might, if properly used, afford him a clew. What her
  reasons for withholding it might be he could not imagine&mdash;he did not try
  to. Simply he felt that if she did not meet him frankly and tell him all she
  knew she was no mother of his.</p>

  <p>There was no attempt at any ordinary greeting between them. He stood on
  one end of the hearth-rug, upright and frowning, with his eyes bent
  searchingly upon her white marble face, as though striving to penetrate the
  mask which he felt convinced was the result of her unnatural calm. She stood
  facing him for a moment, her dark eyes meeting his without a quiver and her
  thin lips pressed tightly together. Then, drawing her skirts around her with
  a slow, graceful movement, she sank backward into the easy-chair from which
  she had risen at his entrance.</p>

  <p>"You sent for me, mother," he said, shortly.</p>

  <p>"I did. Thank you for coming so quickly."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You need not; I was as anxious to come as you could have been to see me.
  You have made up your mind to tell me."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to tell you. I sent for you for another reason."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it. As to your having nothing to tell I don't agree
  with you. You could tell me a great deal. You could, if you chose, help me to
  clear up the mystery of my father's death, of your husband's murder."</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," she answered; "I know nothing."</p>

  <p>"And if you did you would not tell me?"</p>

  <p>"And if I did I should not tell you," she answered. "I am not revengeful.
  I am sorry to see that you are."</p>

  <p>He had determined that he would keep his temper, and he kept it; but it
  was no easy matter.</p>

  <p>"Revengeful is scarcely the word," he answered quietly; "I want justice.
  But you did not send for me to discuss this. I suppose there was something
  else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there was. They tell me that a reward has been offered
  for&mdash;for</p>

  <p>"For Neillson's arrest," he interrupted quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have offered a thousand pounds reward."</p>

  <p>She took up a fan and half hid her face as though to screen it from the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"You are doing a foolish thing," she said. "You know that Neillson could
  not have had anything to do with it."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he answered, "it is very clear that he had something to
  do with it. I will not say he was the actual murderer; perhaps not. But one
  thing is very certain&mdash;he knows all about it."</p>

  <p>"If you find him he will not tell you."</p>

  <p>He smiled incredulously. "We shall see about that. The law will have a
  hold upon him."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Then, with a sudden, swift movement she rose
  from her chair, and before he had time to make up his mind what she was about
  to do she was on her knees before him, her dark eyes gleaming with tears and
  her features convulsed with a sudden storm of passion. Her hands clasped his
  knees&mdash;her whole attitude was one of wild abandonment. The change amazed
  him. He would have started backward but she would not let him go. He stood
  looking down at her dishevelled face, and listening to her passionate words,
  with a strange sense of unreality creeping over him. Surely this could not be
  his mother, this weeping, suppliant woman.</p>

  <p>"Bernard," she cried, "for God's sake listen to me! I beseech you, I warn
  you for your own sake, as well as mine, let it all rest. Leave it to the
  detectives. Don't let them find out anything if you can help it. Don't help
  them. Withdraw that reward. Oh, you don't know what you're doing! You can't
  know! Have you thought anything about it at all? You cannot think that he was
  murdered for that miserable money! Oh, this will kill me, will kill me!" she
  cried, wringing her hands.</p>

  <p>He tried to raise her, but she would not move. She grovelled at his feet,
  and her agony brought the tears into his eyes. Strong in his purpose though
  he was, he could not help being moved.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he cried, trying in vain to lift her, "if he was not murdered
  for that money what was he murdered for? Can you tell me that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" she cried. "I could tell you, but God knows that I would
  sooner die at this moment, here at your feet; than that you should know."</p>

  <p>"There is a history, then&mdash;a secret&mdash;and you know it?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing; but I can guess. Bernard, listen to me. Think of your
  father as the whole world thinks of him; think how every paper is full of his
  praises; remember that sermon yesterday. They hold him up as an example to
  his order and to all men&mdash;honest, virtuous, loyal, a Christian, all that
  a man should be, almost without a fault. What should you think of the man who
  taught them to think otherwise, who pointed to some dark spot in his life
  which none had known of and which made men retract all the good which they
  had spoken of him, and shake their heads at the very mention of his name?
  What should you think of such a one?"</p>

  <p>"Think of him! I should curse him from the bottom of my heart!' cried Lord
  Alceston bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Then, Bernard, be careful lest you should be that one. You seek to
  penetrate the mystery of his death. You may drag into the light fragments of
  a past which no lips save his could rightly explain, and which unexplained
  might damn forever his memory in men's thoughts. Oh, listen to me! Don't turn
  away! Let me warn you! You are the earthly trustee of his reputation.
  Blameless or sinful, there is a part of his life from which the curtain must
  never be lifted, least of all by clumsy, unthinking fingers groping in the
  dark."</p>

  <p>Her voice had gathered force, had risen from a nervous, tremulous whisper
  to an impassioned cry, which seemed to fill the darkened room and which rang
  and burned in his ears with strange thrilling effect. He moved a little away
  from her and looked into her wild beautiful face, on which the firelight was
  casting strange lurid gleams, half fascinated, half frightened. Resistance,
  anger, entreaties, he had steeled himself against. But this was something
  different. There was the ring of truth in her passionate words. What did it
  all mean? What could it mean?</p>

  <p>"Mother, I cannot believe this!" he cried at last in a low, hoarse tone.
  "You&mdash;you must be dreaming. My father's&mdash;his life has been a public
  one before the eyes of all men. There could have been nothing behind it. Oh,
  it is horrible sacrilege to hint at such things! I can never believe it."</p>

  <p>She rose slowly to her feet and moved away till her dark figure was almost
  lost in the shadows of the room. His eyes followed her wonderingly. When she
  returned she held in her right hand a small black book.</p>

  <p>"You are hard, Bernard," she said, "very hard to convince. See, I swear
  that every word I have uttered is truth. If you go on with your search, and
  if you succeed, you will blacken forever your father's memory. I do not say
  that this will be justice. I do not say that ever in his life he committed
  knowingly one single sin. But if you discover anything at all, you will
  discover but a part. The other part could only be explained by lips which are
  silent forever. The sin, or what will seem like sin, you will publish to-the
  world; the justification the world can never know. As I live this is so. I
  swear it. I am your mother, Bernard, and I swear it."</p>

  <p>"Then if it be so," he answered, "I must know all. Then I will judge for
  myself. I must share your knowledge, mother, whatever it may be."</p>

  <p>She threw herself back in her chair with a little hysterical cry and
  covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," she moaned. "I can never tell you."</p>

  <p>"You must either tell me, or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or you will go on with your purpose?"</p>

  <p>"I shall."</p>

  <p>She made no reply. For several minutes there was a deep silence in the
  little apartment. Then, as though rousing himself from a deep fit of
  abstraction, he drew himself up and pushed away the high-backed oaken chair
  against which he had been leaning.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said, "you have nothing more to say to me? I am going."</p>

  <p>She let him reach the door before she spoke. Then her voice, weak and
  shaking, barely reached him, and seemed like a whisper from a long distance.
  He turned around at once. She was standing upon the hearth-rug, leaning
  heavily against the mantel-piece and with a ghastly look in her white
  face.</p>

  <p>"You have brought this upon yourself," she said, speaking hoarsely and as
  though with great difficulty. "Come here&mdash;closer, closer."</p>

  <p>He moved to her side, and in obedience to the nervous clutch of her
  fingers upon his coat sleeve bowed his head until it was almost on a level
  with her lips. Even then she looked uneasily around the room before she
  spoke, her dark, unnaturally brilliant eyes travelling restlessly around it
  and lingering suspiciously in every dark corner.</p>

  <p>"No one can possibly overhear you, mother," he said, a little impatiently,
  yet awed in spite of himself by her strange manner.</p>

  <p>Her white quivering lips almost touched his ears. They moved, slowly, at
  first, then quickly, and the words streamed out in a hoarse agitated whisper.
  They ceased and she drew back, frightened and gasping to watch their effect.
  His face was suddenly white and haggard, and great beads of perspiration hung
  upon his forehead. But blank incredulity struggled to the front, and
  expressed itself in a frantic, passionate tumult of words, which seemed as
  though it must overwhelm all opposition. She listened, and the white pitiless
  lips moved again. Then there was silence, deep intense silence, broken only
  at times by her low, spasmodic sobbing. It was the sobbing of a broken heart.
  Nothing could be worse than this. He knew.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-15"
     id="ch1-15">XV.&mdash;THE REWARD WITHDRAWN.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A few minutes before midnight Stephen Thornton rang the bell
  of the great house in Grosvenor Square and asked to see Lord Alceston. He was
  shown at once into a small study on the ground-floor and in a few minutes was
  joined by his friend.</p>

  <p>Thornton was not a man of keen sympathies, nor was he naturally an
  observant man. But when he saw Lord Alceston enter the room he rose to his
  feet with a quick exclamation.</p>

  <p>"My dear man," he said, in a pitying tone, "how ghastly bad you look! You
  ought to be in bed. I'm sorry I came so late; I ought to have put it off
  until tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston sank into an easy-chair and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you did not put it off. I have been expecting you. I shouldn't
  have gone to bed if you hadn't come. I am anxious to hear what happened after
  I left you."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you directly. May I have a brandy-and-seltzer first, though?
  I've come straight from Whitechapel."</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston rang the bell and the brandy-and-seltzer was brought.
  Thornton helped himself and passed a tumblerful across the table.</p>

  <p>"I'll not speak a word until you have drunk that down," he said. "Why,
  your lips are blue, and you are shaking all over. Is anything fresh the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>"No; that is, nothing of consequence. I'm not very well."</p>

  <p>He took up the tumbler and drained it. Thornton took out a cigar case and
  passed it to him.</p>

  <p>"Try one of these. You'll find a smoke will do you good," he said. "There,
  that's right. You look more yourself now. Do you know you quite frightened me
  when you first came in. And now for my news, such news as it is. It's a
  wonder I'm here to tell it. They took me for a detective or a spy down at the
  Rising Sun and wanted to mob me. Only just got off."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Lord Alceston made no further remark and Thornton continued:</p>

  <p>"I haven't been altogether unsuccessful. In the first place, I know the
  name of the man who had her buried and who attended her funeral. Here it
  is&mdash;Leopold de Feurget, Chandos Street," he said, throwing a piece of
  paper across the table.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston's fingers closed upon it and he nodded. To all appearance he
  might have been a quite uninterested listener to Thornton's recital. But
  Thornton was used to studying men's faces and he knew that it was
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Of the three men who seemed to have visited the woman on the night of her
  murder I have found out nothing as yet of importance. Yet what I have heard
  is mysterious. This murder was no common one, Alceston. Nor were those
  visitors common men. I have made no inquiries in this direction yet. Scotland
  Yard will have done all that, I dare say."</p>

  <p>He looked across at his friend as though fearing that he would appear
  disappointed. But Lord Alceston did not appear disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I have been making inquiries in another direction," Thornton continued.
  "From the talk which went on in the tavern I learned that there was one
  person with whom the murdered woman had occasionally talked and who was
  supposed to be to a certain extent her confidante. I went to see that
  woman."</p>

  <p>"Did she tell you anything?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. But she astonished me more than I was ever astonished in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"How? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you. I found her in an attic working at her trade. A tailoress
  she is. She absolutely refused to answer one of my questions. I offered her
  money&mdash;a good deal of money&mdash;but she still refused. Just as I was
  leaving her she called me back.</p>

  <p>"'Who was the young gentleman with you in &mdash;&mdash; Street to-day?'
  she asked. I saw no reason for concealment, so I told her your name. 'Tell
  him,' she said, 'that if he will come to me alone I will tell him all I know
  about the murdered woman.' I couldn't get another word out of her, nor any
  explanation; so I came away. Her name and address are on that piece of paper,
  too&mdash;Sall Greenwood, 4 Crane's Court, Fitchett Street, Whitechapel."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston's fingers closed over the piece of paper, and he transferred
  it to his waistcoat pocket. Then he resumed his former position, his face
  half shaded with his hand.</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Important?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston changed his position uneasily.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Thornton leaned across the table and looked very grave indeed.</p>

  <p>"I discovered something&mdash;almost by accident&mdash;which seems as
  though it were, indeed, a link between the two murders."</p>

  <p>"And the link is?'</p>

  <p>"Neillson."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston drew a long breath and the color came back to his
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's very soon done. It seemed to me that the cross-examination of Mrs.
  Judkin, the landlady, at the inquest, was very weak, and as I passed the
  house on my way back I went in and saw her."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I frightened her."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"And I made her acknowledge that she had secreted something which she had
  found in the dead woman's room."</p>

  <p>"Yes? What was it?"</p>

  <p>Thornton took a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and threw it
  across the table.</p>

  <p>"A fifty-pound note," he said quietly, "and the number is 202,096."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston repeated the number as though not appreciating its
  significance.</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember," Thornton said, "that is the number of one of the
  notes which your father, the Earl of Harrowdean, drew from Coutts' on the
  morning of his murder, and which Neillson evidently decamped with?"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston grasped the note tightly in his fingers and sat back in his
  chair. For a moment or two the room seemed to be swimming round him and there
  was a low buzzing in his ears. Then he felt a cool hand upon his forehead and
  some brandy streaming down his throat. With a great effort he pulled himself
  together and sat up.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right, thanks," he said weakly. "I'll sit quite still for a
  minute or two."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Then Lord Alceston got up.</p>

  <p>"Thornton," he said, "I asked you to help me in this, and you've done so
  like a brick. I'm immensely obliged to you."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Thornton answered. "I'm glad we've been so fortunate.
  We've made a good start, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"And the start must be the finish," Lord Alceston said slowly. "Thornton,
  I want to drop this, drop it altogether. I want what we have found out to
  remain a profound secret, buried between us two."</p>

  <p>Thornton was a man whom it was not easy to surprise, but he started and
  looked at his friend incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean this?" he asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that now the clew is in your hands you want to throw it
  up? You don't intend to follow it?"</p>

  <p>"I do mean that. I have the strongest reasons."</p>

  <p>"What are they?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, Thornton. You must take my word."</p>

  <p>"You may be mistaken. You may have got hold of some false idea."</p>

  <p>"I am not mistaken."</p>

  <p>"I'm not at all sure that we shouldn't be liable to be indicted for
  conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"I will take the risk of that."</p>

  <p>Thornton thought for a moment, and then shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Very good; you are the most interested in this matter, of course, and you
  shall have your own way. But I tell you frankly that I don't understand this
  and I don't like it. Good-night."</p>

  <p>He left somewhat abruptly, for he was annoyed; and he was one of those men
  who never take the trouble to hide their annoyance. But Lord Alceston knew
  that he would keep his word and he let him go without further protest.</p>

  <p>On the following morning the papers contained a somewhat strange
  announcement. The reward of one thousand pounds for the discovery of Philip
  Neillson had been withdrawn without any explanation. The inference was
  obvious. The authorities no longer believed in his guilt, and though Scotland
  Yard was not supposed to be affected by the offering of the reward at all,
  the search for the missing man became weak and halfhearted. The one possible
  clew was swept away, and the murderers of the Earl of Harrowdean and of the
  unknown woman in the East End were still at large. The papers had plenty to
  say about it, and Scotland Yard very little. The chief inspector of the
  latter was worried almost out of his senses. But perhaps Stephen Thornton was
  of all men the most perplexed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-16"
     id="ch1-16">XVI.&mdash;MR. BRUDNELL'S ADVICE.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were very few family solicitors in London of higher
  standing than Mr. John Brudnell, of John Brudnell &amp; Sons, Bedford Row.
  The names on the piles of tin boxes which lined his private office from floor
  to ceiling were most of them familiar by their greatness, and never failed to
  inspire awe in the minds of a casual caller or a fresh client. On one of the
  largest and most prominent of these was painted in large letters the name of
  the Earl of Harrowdean. Mr. Brudnell, his father, and before him his
  grandfather, had managed successfully and carefully the affairs of the
  Alceston family, and Mr. Brudnell himself had been admitted to terms almost
  of intimacy with the deceased peer. Consequently the lawyer was by no means
  surprised on his arrival at the office at ten o'clock on the morning
  following Lord Alceston's interview with his mother to be told that the
  young' Earl of Harrowdean was waiting to see him in his private room.</p>

  <p>If he was not surprised Mr. Brudnell seemed by no means eager for the
  impending interview. He stepped slowly back into the street and dismissed the
  trim little brougham which had brought him from his luxurious little villa at
  St. John's Wood, and then, instead of immediately re-entering the office, he
  strolled for a minute or two slowly up and down the pavement with downcast
  eyes and with his hands folded behind him. He was a man of tall and
  commanding presence and with nothing about his personality, at all events, of
  the typical lawyer. But none the less he enjoyed a great reputation in legal
  circles for shrewdness and acumen, and the confidence of his clients in his
  advice was most flattering. But though Mr. Brudnell was a man of the world,
  and was possessed of an almost unlimited experience in the management of his
  clients, for once in his lifetime he felt in a quandary. Of course there were
  a hundred matters on which the Earl of Harrowdean might have come to consult
  him&mdash;but supposing it should be that! How was he to get out of it? What
  explanation or answers could he possibly give? At best he could cut but a
  poor figure, unless he lied, and strange though it may appear,
  notwithstanding his profession Mr. Brudnell never permitted himself to
  deviate from the strict truth. He had often anticipated some such interview
  as this, but although he liked always to be prepared for any emergency, he
  had never been able to formulate any satisfactory scheme for dealing with it.
  As he stood reflecting for the last time on the steps of his office he could
  see only one course to take, and it was by no means a pleasant one. It might
  cost him his post as legal adviser to the Alceston family, but there was no
  other course open to him, he decided, as he thoughtfully twirled his long
  gray mustache the last time and then turned into the office.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston was walking impatiently up and down his private room when he
  entered it. At the sound of the opening door he stopped short and turned
  round.</p>

  <p>"Ah, good-morning, Mr. Brudnell. I'm an early visitor, you see."</p>

  <p>"Very glad to see you, Lord Alceston, at any time," the lawyer answered,
  drawing off his gloves. "Won't you sit down? You'll find that easy-chair
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston took it and sat for a moment or two in silence, watching Mr.
  Brudnell while he carefully hung up his overcoat and hat and put the gardenia
  which he drew from his button-hole into a little vase filled with fresh
  water. Then he took a chair in front of his table and, turning round on it,
  faced his client.</p>

  <p>"You have come to have a talk about the property, of course, my lord," he
  began. "There is a good deal about which I should like your opinion and
  instructions. The long leases on the Clanavon estate, for
  instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did not come to talk about the estate, or anything to do with it," Lord
  Alceston interrupted. "My errand is a totally different one."</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked into the pale, almost desperate face of the young peer
  and knew that what he feared was coming. But he did nothing to make the task
  easier for his client. He sat in absolute silence for several minutes and
  waited for the inevitable.</p>

  <p>"What I came to see you about," Lord Alceston commenced slowly, "has
  reference to my father's private affairs."</p>

  <p>"I thought so," groaned the lawyer to himself.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, after I had recovered a little from the first horror of his
  murder, the first thing which occurred to me was a strong desire that the man
  who had committed this hideous deed should be found and punished. I felt, and
  I feel now, that I shall never rest until the rope is around the neck of the
  villain who committed that brutal murder. You are a man, and can scarcely
  wonder at this, I think, Mr. Brudnell."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brudnell acknowledged gravely that the feeling was a natural one, and
  then looked away from the keenly flashing eyes which were fixed upon him with
  a little sigh and a presentiment of approaching trouble.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brudnell, I loved my father. Vengeance may be a most unchristianlike
  sentiment, but it is a very natural one. It has laid hold of me&mdash;has
  laid hold of me so completely that every other feeling seems swept away
  before it. I have sworn that the man who killed my father must die."</p>

  <p>"Every one must hope that the police will succeed in their quest and that
  the wretch will expiate his crime on the scaffold," murmured the lawyer
  sententiously. "I was at Scotland Yard yesterday, making inquiries, and they
  seemed hopeful."</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;&mdash; Scotland Yard!" said Lord Alceston impatiently, for the
  lawyer's tone as well as the mention of the place had irritated him. "I never
  expected that Scotland Yard would do any good."</p>

  <p>"Then how, may I ask, did you hope that the murderer would be discovered?"
  Mr. Brudnell inquired.</p>

  <p>"I meant to track him down myself," the young man answered fiercely. "Ay,
  and I mean so still. But before I had been able to take my first step even, I
  receive what has been a great shock to me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brudnell said nothing, but waited for Lord Alceston to proceed. His
  face was generally as impassive as a face could be, but at that moment he
  felt it hard to conceal the apprehension which was drawing in upon him. Lord
  Alceston, watching him closely, saw it, and it made him the more eager.</p>

  <p>"It is suggested to me, Mr. Brudnell&mdash;I will not say by whom, or
  how&mdash;that there may be in my father's past life some secret which would
  afford the clew to his murder. It is further suggested that about this secret
  there may be something, at least, of guilt, something for which at any rate
  the world would not hold him guiltless. I am told that this hideous crime may
  be the vengeance of some injured man, and that if I prosecute my search for
  him I may drag into life some disgraceful story of the past which will bring
  shame upon my father's memory. As though in support of this I am told a
  circumstance which happened on the night of his murder, which if generally
  known would at least cause scandal, and for that reason I am bidden, I am
  implored to let the whole matter rest and to let the murderer go in
  peace."</p>

  <p>"If there be any truth in the suggestions of which you speak, my lord,"
  the lawyer remarked in a low tone, "the advice was good."</p>

  <p>"But do you think that I believe in this&mdash;this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The very best men have sometimes sinned in the days of their youth," Mr.
  Brudnell interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"True, and if my father ever did so, I will not be his judge. But before I
  let his murder remain unavenged, I must know more&mdash;I must hear something
  more than suggestions."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Seeing that the lawyer was not disposed to
  break it, Lord Alceston arose and, moving to the opposite side of the
  writing-table, stood facing him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brudnell, listen to me! If there is anything in my father's life
  which he kept concealed from the world, you are the one man who would know
  it. You know that I am not here out of mere idle curiosity. If anything less
  depended upon it I would never dream of needless prying into his secrets. But
  what has happened alters all that. It is my duty to ask, and yours to tell,
  anything which can throw light upon this. I ask you a plain question, Mr.
  Brudnell; give me a plain answer. Have you any reason to believe that in
  following out my search for my father's murderer I run any risk of bringing
  to light anything which had better be kept secret?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer did not hesitate for a moment. He looked straight into the
  pale, anxious face bending over toward his, and answered him:</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston took a quick step backward, as though he had received a
  blow. He had come here quite expecting some such avowal, and yet, now that it
  had come, it came as a shock to him.</p>

  <p>"You must tell me all about it," he said slowly. "I must know all."</p>

  <p>"I cannot," the lawyer said.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you that I will know!" cried Lord Alceston fiercely. "I will
  hear the whole story, and I will judge for myself what risk I run of bringing
  it, all to light if I carry on the search for his murderer. Do you think that
  my vengeance can die so easily&mdash;can fade away at two words from you? I
  must know all."</p>

  <p>"Never from me," said the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Then the shame be upon you," cried Lord Alceston bitterly, "if I do
  mischief; for I shall follow this thing out to the bitter end!"</p>

  <p>The lawyer rose to his feet and held up his hand, for Lord Alceston had
  caught up his hat as though about to depart.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, my lord," he said, "and I will tell you what I may."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-17"
     id="ch1-17">XVII.&mdash;A GLIMPSE OF THE PAST.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I dare say you know," Mr. Brudnell commenced, "that your
  father had a long minority. He was an orphan at six years old, and until he
  came of age I saw very little of him. After then, however, he came to see me
  frequently, and although I was rather young at that time he honored me, I
  believe, with his full confidence. When he was twenty-two years old he left
  England on leave from his regiment for a year's travel. It was soon afterward
  that his troubles began.</p>

  <p>"At first he wrote to me occasionally, but very soon he left off doing so,
  and I had no news of him for some time, except through his bankers. About a
  year after his departure I was sent for in great haste by the manager of the
  bank. From him I learned that your father had already overdrawn his account
  very considerably, and that afternoon another draft for a large amount had
  been presented by the agents of a foreign bank. What were they to do? Of
  course I authorized the payment of the draft, but I wrote to your father that
  night pointing out the position of affairs. By return I got a peremptory
  demand for a further large sum, to obtain which I had to sell out a quantity
  of very well-invested stock. I heard nothing then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forgive my interrupting you; but where was my father at this time?" asked
  Lord Alceston. Mr. Bradnell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That is just one of the things which I may not tell you. To proceed, I
  heard nothing more from your father for a month, and then news came to me in
  a startling manner. I had some friends dining with me one night, when word
  was brought in to me that a man wished to see me who would take no denial and
  who seemed greatly agitated. I made some excuse to my guests for a moment. In
  the little anteroom I found waiting for me, travel-stained and pale with
  excitement and fear, Neillson, your father's servant.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you why he sought me, Lord Alceston. I can only tell you
  this&mdash;that his news was such that I left my house within an hour and
  travelled night and day until I reached your father. I was unsuccessful in my
  journey, and notwithstanding all my entreaties I was obliged to return to
  England alone. Your father professed unbounded gratitude to me, but the one
  thing which I begged of him he would not do. He was mad at that time, I
  think, or he would not have stayed in that place. But he did, and I had to
  come back without him. I did not see him again for three years, when he
  returned to England to take up his commission in the army. Very soon
  afterward he was married."</p>

  <p>"What you have told me is the husk without the kernel. I want to know
  where my father was during his mysterious absence from England, and what was
  the danger from which you saved him. Do you mean that you will tell me no
  more?"</p>

  <p>"I do, Lord Alceston. In this very room I gave your father my solemn
  promise that no word of it should ever pass my lips. I cannot think that you
  will urge me to break a promise which should surely be considered sacred to
  the dead."</p>

  <p>"No, I cannot urge it," Lord Alceston admitted. "And yet, if he could have
  foreseen anything like this happening&mdash;it makes things so
  different."</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Mr. Brudnell, "I was not myself wholly in your father's
  confidence. But, judging from what I do know, I should say that it makes no
  difference. My opinion is that he would rather his murder remained unavenged
  than that that page of his history should be read out to the world in the
  avenging it."</p>

  <p>"That I shall try to judge for myself," said Lord Alceston, "for I shall
  try to find out what was written on that page. Then I shall use my
  judgment."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brudnell shook his head. "It will be a sad waste of time, my
  lord."</p>

  <p>"I am young and I can spare it. I must do something in this. I cannot sit
  down in idleness."</p>

  <p>"You have my advice, Lord Alceston, the advice of an old man and a man of
  the world, and one, too, who has the additional advantage of knowing far more
  about the matter than you do. Let the matter rest as it is. You can do your
  father no possible good by seeking his murderer. Revenge is only a sentiment
  and it is certainly not a noble sentiment."</p>

  <p>"I do not seek revenge, Mr. Brudnell," said Lord Alceston, rising and
  drawing on his gloves. "I seek justice."</p>

  <p>"It may be, my lord, that that has already been dealt out," replied Mr.
  Brudnell, also rising.</p>

  <p>"What, in my father's death? Do you mean that that was an act of justice?
  Do you mean an&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The lawyer laid his hand upon the young man's arm and checked him.</p>

  <p>"Nay, my lord. I did not mean that. Have you ever thought what must be the
  state of mind of a murderer? Though he be a very devil there must be moments
  of fear, of remorse. A man's sin carries with it always its own
  punishment."</p>

  <p>"It may be so, Mr. Brudnell. I hope that it is so. But I did not come here
  to discuss abstract questions of morality. As to the course I intend to
  pursue my mind is quite made up. Good-morning."</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, my lord."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brudnell attended his distinguished client to the outer door and then
  returned to his private room. There was a pile of business waiting for him
  and his head clerk was impatient for his instructions for the day. But Mr.
  Brudnell put them all off for a while, and, shutting himself up in his room,
  sat down in front of his table with a troubled look in his face. He had an
  odd habit sometimes, when he was perplexed, of talking to himself, and he
  found himself doing so now.</p>

  <p>"I must see Lady Alceston at once," he said softly. "Perhaps she knows. I
  know there was nothing at Grosvenor Square, for I searched every drawer of
  the cabinet. If he has not destroyed them they are at Clanavon. I ought to
  have insisted upon seeing them burned. One always thinks of these things when
  it is too late. Perhaps I had better go down there. Yes, that will be best.
  Let me see, to-day is Tuesday. I cannot go today; and to-morrow Lord
  Filgrave's case is on. It must be Thursday."</p>

  <p>He took up a book of engagements, and crossing out several already
  entered, wrote "Clanavon" across the space opposite Thursday. Then he rang
  for his head clerk, and announced himself ready for the day's business.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-18"
     id="ch1-18">XVIII.&mdash;A VOICE FROM THE CLIFFS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">High up on the summit of a long line of iron-bound cliffs
  frown the battered remains of what was once a great castle. Many hundred feet
  below a gray stormy sea, which even in the calmest of summer weather seems
  never at rest, dashes in with an unceasing melancholy roar upon the few yards
  of shingly beach and the worn cliff side. The country around and behind is a
  barren moorland, treeless and uncultivated and houseless. Only a keen eye
  could detect, right down in the shelter of the cliffs, a few red-tiled
  cottages huddled close together as though for protection from the wild,
  sweeping winds, and in front of them a few brown-sailed fishing boats, and
  here and there a net. Sometimes the fishermen cowered over a common fire and
  told wild, eerie stories&mdash;for they were North Country folk and
  superstitious. Sometimes they stood on the grinding shingles bathed in a
  shadow of salt spray and looked longingly but hopelessly out through the
  clouds of mist and storm to the sea to which they dared not trust themselves;
  and sometimes they all joined in laboring to repair the misfortunes of one of
  their little community, and mended a net, or a sail, or hammered fresh planks
  into the bottom of a leaking boat. It was a plain, rough, hard life, with
  many sorrows and few joys; yet they lived it without grumbling, and on the
  whole with quite as much satisfaction as many of their more fortunately
  situated fellows.</p>

  <p>It is in the autumn when their lot seems hardest and the battle of life
  most severe; and it is mid-autumn now. A wild, gusty wind comes roaring over
  the unquiet German Ocean, furrowing the gray sea with mountainous waves, and
  dashing them in upon that little strip of storm-bound coast with all the fury
  of an army of angry demons cast loose upon the restless waters.</p>

  <p>As the hours of night drew on, the thick pall of darkness which had been
  weighing upon earth and sea was pierced by the sudden appearance of the full
  moon from behind a thick bank of fast-moving black clouds. At the door of the
  cottage which supplied the place of an inn to the little hamlet stood Jim
  Doore, landlord of the same, tempted outside for a moment by the sudden
  appearance of the moon. Holding his pipe behind his back lest the wind should
  blow it into ashes and rob him of his last few minutes' stolid enjoyment
  before retiring for the night, he took a few cautious steps shoreward and
  looked around him. First he cast a long, anxious glance over the wildly
  tossing sea, and drew a long, deep breath of relief when he saw no trace of
  any craft fighting a vain battle with the elements&mdash;for Jim Doore was a
  humane man. Then he glanced up at the castle and noted the two glimmering
  lights which shone from different parts of it. At one of these he looked with
  indifference; on the other, high up in the uninhabited portion of the keep,
  he looked long with frowning brow and displeased mien.</p>

  <p>"'Tis uncanny," he muttered between his teeth, gravely shaking his head.
  "I don't loike it! It bodes noa good, noa good."</p>

  <p>He looked away and turned toward his cottage. Through the window he could
  see the cheerful blaze of a large fire and several men on a rude bench seated
  around it smoking. Closer still to the window was his wife, her hard,
  weather-stained yet comely face peering out into the darkness, with a shade
  of anxiety in it, looking for her absent lord. Suddenly she made out his
  burly figure, and called to him:</p>

  <p>"Coom thee in out o' th' wet, lad! Coom on!"</p>

  <p>The invitation was not one to be despised, especially accompanied as it
  was with a smile which was meant to be and was to him inviting. Jim Doore
  looked in at the cheerful fireside and into his wife's face, and drew a sigh
  of something which was very much like content.</p>

  <p>He lounged forward, and in another minute would have been safe inside hip
  door. But with his hand upon the latch he paused and stood quite still in a
  listening attitude. Was it his fancy, or had he not heard a faint shout from
  above, among the cliffs?</p>

  <p>Suddenly a fierce gust of wind came tearing seaward and down the cliff
  side. This time there was no doubt about it. It carried with it the faint but
  unmistakable "Halloa!" of a human being.</p>

  <p>Jim Doore was a devout Catholic, and the first thing he did was to cross
  himself. That operation performed to his satisfaction, he rapidly ran over in
  his mind the names of his few neighbors. There were twelve in all and five
  were in his rude parlor. The other seven he had seen during the evening, and
  knew them to be safe in their homes. The shout, faint though it was through
  the distance, was no woman's or child's. No one but a man, and a man with
  sound lungs, could have made his voice heard above the din of the storm.</p>

  <p>Excitement was a rare visitor to Jim Doore, and when it came, it came
  slowly. But it was on the way now. Again came that faint "Hallos!" Setting
  his feet a little apart, and throwing his head a little back, he raised his
  hands to his mouth and sent forth an answering shout which scared a whole
  colony of sea-gulls and made the air beat and vibrate around him.</p>

  <p>The cottage door was thrown open and its temporary occupants came trooping
  forth, Mrs Doore in the van.</p>

  <p>"What be'ast a-doin', mon?" cried she. "Theist amost broak the windoa wi'
  tha' shoating."</p>

  <p>He pointed up to the cliff side, which towered above them.</p>

  <p>"Theer's a mon theer, lass. I tell 'ee I 'eard um Shoat. Fetch t'
  lanthorn; we mun goa and seek."</p>

  <p>"Summun on t' cliff? Why, noa, lad; they be all at whoam."</p>

  <p>"I tell 'ee I 'eard um. Listen 'ee."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and sure enough the sound of another "Halloa!"
  reached them from above. There were murmurings of amazement among the little
  group&mdash;almost of fear. Strangers never came to their little cluster of
  abodes, and this must be the hail of a stranger. Who could it be? What could
  he want with them? The little handful of men, slow-witted by nature and
  position, looked at one another helplessly. It was Mrs. Doore whose common
  sense first mastered her surprise.</p>

  <p>"A mon it be surely, and if he be got off the paeth, he'll be nigh
  breaking his neck if you lads doan't stir yerself. Whoi doan't ye be up and
  foind 'im? Now then, Jim."</p>

  <p>There was a stir among the men, and they prepared to move forward. Just as
  they were starting a sudden storm of wind and rain extinguished the lantern
  which Mrs. Doore had brought out, and there was a pause. When it was brought
  out relit the wind had increased to a hurricane. The storm which came raging
  in from the sea seemed to have gained fresh and redoubled vigor from the
  momentary lull. Far off came the sound of the breakers lashing themselves
  against the worn, jagged rocks, and nearer still the sea swept in upon the
  hard beach with a threatening, murderous roar, and, having spent its force,
  retreated, grinding the pebbles and shingles together till the air seemed
  rent with the screams of the "maddened beach."</p>

  <p>"It's a terrible night, lads!" shouted Jim Doore to his little band. "We
  mun keep together."</p>

  <p>They moved off, keeping close under the shelter of the giant cliff which
  overhung their little cluster of homesteads, though even at that distance
  every now and then the salt spray from the foaming sea came dashing into
  their faces. At the foot of the winding path, from which the shout had come,
  they paused and joined hands before commencing the ascent.</p>

  <p>"We mun howd on toight to one another, lads!" cried Jim Doore. "If one o'
  them theer gusts cooms on we shall like to be bloomed roight over into the
  sea. Noo then."</p>

  <p>They commenced their climb, every now and then crouching down to avoid the
  fury of the storm. Presently Jim tried a "Holloa!" and it was answered
  immediately, with a distinctness which showed them that their quest was
  nearly over.</p>

  <p>"Steady, lads," cried Jim, waving his lantern; "he be away theer to the
  roight!"</p>

  <p>They turned down a narrow sheep-track which seemed literally to overhang
  the sea below, and made their way slowly along it with great care. In a few
  minutes Jim paused and held up his hand. The dark figure of a man confronted
  them, standing in the middle of the path.</p>

  <p>"I've missed the path somewhere, haven't I?" he inquired. "I thought I was
  wrong somehow, but it was so infernally dark that I was afraid to try and
  find my way back again, and I didn't like going on either, so I shouted. Glad
  you heard me. Are you from the castle or from the village?"</p>

  <p>"We be coom from down below," answered Jim, pointing through the thick
  darkness to where their few cottages lay grouped together. "It be lucky that
  you didn't try to get much forrader on this 'ere path, or you'd a-walked
  right over th' edge o' cliff. Wouldn't he, Bill?" he added, turning round to
  the foremost of his companions.</p>

  <p>"Surely."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I was afraid of," remarked the stranger. "Can any of you
  down there put me up for the night, or show me the way to Clanavon
  Castle?"</p>

  <p>There was a distinct sensation among the little group of men. A visitor on
  his way to the castle! Such a thing was never heard of. Forgetting his
  manners in his curiosity, Jim raised his lantern, and for the first time had
  a glimpse of the stranger.</p>

  <p>He saw a tall, finely-built young man, whose handsome face,
  notwithstanding the rain and storm and the danger which he had certainly been
  in, was in no way discomposed; and apparently he saw something else too, for
  after a brief inspection he lowered the lantern and touched his cap with a
  gesture of respect.</p>

  <p>"Yer 'onor a' ta'en wrong turn fer t' castle," he said. "A' should a' kept
  roight on, and never a' coom down this path. 'Tis a stiff clamb back agen,
  now, an' none ower safe."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do, then?" the young man asked, shrugging his shoulders.
  "Can any of you put me up for the night?"</p>

  <p>"If ya doan't moind roughing it, yer 'onor, down in moi bit o' a cottage,
  the missus&mdash;" began Jim Doore.</p>

  <p>"Mind roughing it? Not I, my man. A good fire and a blanket are all I
  want. I'm wet through to the skin. Lead the way."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-19"
     id="ch1-19">XIX.&mdash;THE STRANGER.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The little procession re-formed and commenced the descent,
  Jim Doore and the stranger leading the way, the others close behind. Once
  Bill Simpson, Jim's partner, managed to edge himself into the front line for
  a minute, and drew the latter a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"Dost a' know who 'un be, Jim?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"I a' gotten some idea," Jim replied in a mysterious manner. "Keep a civil
  tongue in tha head, mon, and bid the others."</p>

  <p>They had reached the little strip of beach, and were slowly making their
  way under the shelter of the cliff to the cottages. High up in front of them
  shone the two glimmering lights from the castle. The stranger looked at them
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"What lights are those?" he asked, pointing upward.</p>

  <p>Jim Doore's eyes followed his gesture, and he crossed himself again.</p>

  <p>"From Clanavon Castle, yer 'onor," he answered.</p>

  <p>"They seem a long way apart," remarked the other, looking up at them with
  interest. "Ah!"</p>

  <p>Again the clouds had parted, and a brilliant flood of moonlight streamed
  down upon the wild little scene, glistening across the waste of tossing
  waters, and throwing strange shadows upon the towering cliffs. But the most
  striking object of all was the castle; and the stranger stood with his eyes
  fixed upon it, scarcely caring to cast a single glance at the remainder of
  the panorama. High up above them the gloomy pile, with its frowning ramparts,
  its ruined towers, and its massive keep, stood out boldly, the magnificence
  of its situation heightened by the weirdness of the light, the hour, and the
  storm. Midway down the flagstaff the remains of the flag, tattered and torn
  almost into strips by the gale, were still streaming in the wind, floating
  against a background of light oily-looking clouds which hovered over the
  castle, and against which every tear and almost the very pattern was
  distinguishable. It was a fine sight, although a gloomy one.</p>

  <p>Jim Doore looked steadfastly at the two lights, and then, turning round,
  pointed them out silently to his companions. There was a little murmur of
  superstitious awe, and each man crossed himself.</p>

  <p>The stranger looked on in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why do you do that?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Reason enoo, yer 'onor," Jim answered slowly, and dropping his voice to
  an impressive pitch. "Dost a' see yonder loight, the fur un oot theer in the
  tower?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! What of it?"</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Tis no flesh and blood that boides theer, or that kindled that
  loight."</p>

  <p>The stranger smiled the easy, sceptical smile of the sturdy materialist,
  to whom such statements seem only the weak superstitions of an ignorant,
  uneducated peasantry. He said nothing, but that smile was enough. The whole
  of the little body of men were up in arms. Their castle ghost was a familiar
  idea to all of them. There was not one of them who did not firmly believe in
  its existence. For a stranger to come among them and affect incredulity
  appeared to them very much in the light of a discourtesy, which each one was
  prompt to resent. The young man checked them, however, by holding up his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he protested. "You shall tell me all about your ghost when we
  get inside. I'm wet through to the skin, and cold as well. Push on, my worthy
  guide, and let us get beneath this roof of yours."</p>

  <p>"Roight, roight, sor," was the good-humored answer. "We bean't so fur,
  neither."</p>

  <p>They turned a corner of the cliff, and the little cluster of cottages
  nestling close up to its side lay right before them. From the window of Jim
  Doore's abode there shone a pleasant, warm light, reflected from the roaring
  fire which his wife had been making up in anticipation of a visitor. The
  stranger saw it and quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "if that isn't the pleasantest sight I've seen
  to-day. Is this your house?"</p>

  <p>Jim pushed open the door with his foot, and ushered in his guest with a
  rough gesture, which was meant for a welcome.</p>

  <p>"Doan't 'ee stan' out noa longer in this cold, yer 'onor," he said. "Coom
  thee in, by t' foire, and my missus shall find 'ee some dra cloathes. Get
  thee by t' fire.. Missus! Missus! We a' found 'im&mdash;'twas a gentlemon as
  a' lost his way t' the castle. Coom thee and bring ma' Sunday cloathes. Why,
  dang it, lass, what is to staring at?"</p>

  <p>During the first part of this speech Jim had been busy stirring up the
  fire and otherwise arranging for the comfort of his guest, whose clothes were
  steaming in the warm blaze. But toward its completion, somewhat surprised at
  the non-appearance of his better half, he had turned toward the door and had
  received something of a shock. Standing on the threshold was his wife, with
  her eyes steadfastly fixed upon the stranger, and her hands raised to her
  temples. There was an expression in her face which, during his many years of
  wedded life, Jim Doore had seen nothing of before. Her cheeks were colorless,
  her dark eyes were full of horror, and her whole attitude was that of a woman
  paralyzed by the sudden appearance of an unlooked-for hanger. The young man
  at the fireside, unconscious of her scrutiny, leaned forward toward the
  blaze, which shone full upon his handsome face, and appeared to be making
  himself decidedly comfortable.</p>

  <p>She made no answer to her husband's impatient question. She stood there
  quite still, her lips trembling a little and her eyes still fixed upon the
  face which was glowing in the ruddy firelight. Her husband repeated his
  impatient question, and the stranger turned carelessly round in his seat, as
  though mildly wondering what had provoked it. His movement seemed to effect
  what her husband's words had failed to do. She moved slowly forward into the
  middle of the room, and her face resumed its usual expression, save for a
  slight shade of pallor.</p>

  <p>"They're down here in the corner, Jim. I thought as they might be wanted.
  Would this gentleman like anything to eat?" she added, hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Anything to eat!" he repeated, turning a good-humored, smiling face upon
  her. "My good woman, there is only one word which would explain my condition
  at the present moment. I'm starving&mdash;literally starving! Forgive the
  question, but what have you got in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Not much that's fit for you, sir, I'm afraid," she answered, quietly.
  "There's a bit o' bacon, and some fish&mdash;the fish is fresh and good if
  you like it, sir&mdash;and I could get you some tea."</p>

  <p>"I should think I do like fish!" he answered her. "Let me have some, by
  all means, and some tea; and I'll try the bacon, too. What a lucky thing for
  me you heard that shout, my good fellow! Now, where can I get into these
  things?"</p>

  <p>"Here, sir, by the fire. Jim'll come with me into the back room. I've got
  a fire there, sir; and your supper won't be long."</p>

  <p>She turned away and her husband followed her. Presently she returned with
  a clean white cloth on her arm and commenced making preparations for the
  meal. Her guest had attired himself in the clothes which she had provided,
  and, overcome by the pleasant warmth after his long exposure to the wet and
  cold, had sunk down in his chair and was dozing. Once or twice she glanced
  across to him, and then seeing that he was really asleep she moved softly
  over to his side and looked down into his face. In her husband's rough
  clothes his fair boyish face looked all the handsomer by reason of the
  contrast, and as she looked into it she felt a lump come into her throat, and
  her heart beat fast. Again there came that sensation of fear. Why had he
  come? What was the meaning of it? If only she dared ask him!</p>

  <p>Her husband's heavy footsteps outside warned her of his approach, and she
  retreated to the table, still holding her hand to her side, as though in
  pain. Presently he entered bearing in his hand a smoking dish and a kettle
  from which the steam was issuing in a little cloud. The tea was soon made,
  and when all was in readiness they awakened their guest. He sprang to his
  feet at once and drew up his chair to the table with alacrity.</p>

  <p>"I've actually been dozing, have I?" he exclaimed. "I should have thought
  that hunger would have kept me awake. Mrs. Doore," he continued, "your fish
  is excellent. I never tasted better."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you like it, sir," she answered. "It's about the only thing we
  have fit to offer you."</p>

  <p>"And the tea is delicious," he added, setting down his cup. "I feel a
  different man already."</p>

  <p>Once or twice during the meal the door was softly opened and some one
  would put a head in and retreat with an awkward apology. At first the
  stranger seemed puzzled, but before long the truth began to dawn upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Doore, is this an inn?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It be, sir. Surely."</p>

  <p>"And those men want to come in, of course. Let them in at once, Mrs.
  Doore. I insist upon it."</p>

  <p>"Won't they annoy you, sir?" she asked doubtfully. "They're but rough sort
  o' chaps like, an&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not another word, Mrs. Doore, but let them come in. I should be sorry to
  monopolize the whole room."</p>

  <p>She moved to the door and called to them. One by one they came in and
  seated themselves around the wide fireplace, each making some sort of clumsy
  salutation to the stranger as they entered.</p>

  <p>"My good men," he said pleasantly, when they had all entered, "I am much
  obliged to all of you for coming to look for me. Fill up your glasses, and
  remember," he added, turning to Jim Doore, "whatever is drunk to-night is
  drunk at my expense."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of thanks and general brightening up in the little
  circle. In a few minutes the stranger had finished his meal, and, drawing his
  chair after him, joined the circle. From the pocket of his coat, which was
  stretched out before the fire, he drew out a morocco case and lit a cigar.
  Then, stretching himself out in his chair, he turned to the landlord.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Doore," he said, "I'm ready to hear all about that mysterious
  light up in the castle and all about the ghost. Fire away."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-20"
     id="ch1-20">XX.&mdash;JIM DOORE'S STORY.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jim Doore cleared his throat once or twice and settled
  himself down to his task with the air of a man who knows that he has a good
  tale to tell and intends telling it well. His listeners, notwithstanding that
  they all save one knew quite as much as he did about it, and had heard it
  told and had told it themselves and discussed it many a time, drew their
  chairs round in a half circle and manifested the liveliest signs of
  interest.</p>

  <p>There were two figures in the background&mdash;the stranger and Jim
  Doore's wife. The former, notwithstanding his grotesque attire, which fell in
  strange lines about his slits, graceful figure, looked every inch an
  aristocrat and a handsome one. He was leaning very far back in an ancient but
  comfortable easy-chair, with a fragrant cigar held between two very white
  fingers, from which the blue smoke was curling upward in a long straight
  line. His thin lips were slightly parted in an amused smile, and his clear
  blue eyes were wandering round the little scene, as though keenly
  appreciating the oddity of his situation. But beneath it all there was a
  melancholy cast about his countenance, which it seemed impossible to trace to
  any one feature, and yet which was certainly there. As a portion of the
  background to the picture he was distinctly striking.</p>

  <p>Not less so was Mrs. Doore, though her appearance was scarcely so
  picturesque. She was sitting some little distance behind the circle, in a
  corner where neither the firelight nor the lamplight penetrated, so that her
  face was in the shadow. Upon her knee was a piece of needlework, to which she
  was paying no attention whatever, for both her hands had closed upon it,
  while she was leaning forward like the others toward her husband, her dark
  eyes glowing in the occasional gleams of firelight which fell upon them.
  Perhaps a casual observer glancing around, and noticing her twitching fingers
  and rapt silence, would have come to the conclusion that she was the person
  who was waiting for Jim Doore's story with the greatest interest.</p>

  <p>But as she must have heard it many times it would seem scarcely
  probable.</p>

  <p>The preliminary silence had lasted quite long enough. Recognizing that
  fact by several faint signs of impatience on the part of his audience, Jim
  Doore cleared his throat once or twice and commenced:</p>

  <p>"You must know, first of all," he said, addressing the stranger, "that yon
  castle is called Clanavon Castle, and belongs, or leastways it belonged, to
  the Earl of Clanavon. You've heard of him, noa doubt, sir?"</p>

  <p>The stranger nodded. "I have heard of him," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well, he wor a great man in Lunnon, and they do say he was always very
  hard at work on something of other. He looked almost like that."</p>

  <p>"He used to come down here sometimes, then?" interrupted the young man for
  whose benefit&mdash;ostensibly&mdash;the story was being told.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I was going to tell 'ee. Though he was one of the
  hardest-worked men in Lunnon, and was a Parliament man, and wrote books, and
  a' that, every two or three months he used to come down here for a few
  days&mdash;sometimes a week&mdash;for a sort o' rest. In t' summer he'd coom
  in a steam yacht; but anyways, however he coom, it was always unexpected
  like. He never let un know afoorhand. There be one room in the south tower
  which he used to use, and it was allus kept ready for him, summer and winter,
  and all times. It be that room," Jim added, dropping his voice a little, "in
  which you seed the light burning."</p>

  <p>"Then who uses it now?" the stranger asked. There was a low chorus of
  mysterious ejaculations. Jim shook his head in a mysterious manner and
  crossed himself.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell 'ee all as is knowed, sur," he said. "When the earl wor here,
  night after night, we used to see that light burning till daybreak, while he
  sat a-working his papers and such like. Just about at daybreak it used to
  disappear, and then we knew that he'd gone to bed. He used to sleep till
  about middle-day, and then he'd come out shooting among the rocks, or sailing
  a little skiff in the bay, or mayhap fishing till evening again. He used to
  enjoy himself quite simple like, allus alone; but he used always to look a
  powerful sight better after a few days here."</p>

  <p>"Was he always alone here, then?" the stringer asked.</p>

  <p>"Allus. There's never been no visitor to the castle in our time. You see
  it bean't kept up for a company place like. It be all in ruins, except a room
  or two. Well, it was about&mdash;about how long ago wor it, missus?" he
  asked, turning to his missus.</p>

  <p>"About six months," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, about six months it wor," Jim continued. "About six months ago, me
  and the mates got back from a spell o' fishing, and we see the light in the
  earl's room. Very bright and powerful it wor. Well, of coors, we all thought
  that the earl had come down for a spell, and in the morning me and Bill
  Foulds there, we ups and goes to the castle to spe if any fish was wanted.
  There be only two on 'em up there to look arter the place like&mdash;Mrs.
  Smith, a decent old body she is, and her brother, old Joe Craggs, who's but a
  poor half-witted loon. We went round to the bit o' entrance at the back and
  straight into the kitchen. Mrs. Smith was not there, and after waiting aboot
  a bit we goes into her little room, and there she wor sobbing and going on
  awful. I thought in coors as 'ow the earl had come unexpected like and found
  her unprepared, and had been a-giving it to 'er. So I sez: 'What's oop,
  Martha? 'As he been a-going on aboot summat?' 'Has who bin going on?' she
  says, a-looking up surprised like. 'Why, the earl,' says I. 'We seed as he
  was back by the light in the south tower last night.' 'There warn't no
  light,' says she, a-shaking all over, and clopping 'er hand to a' soide. 'Oh,
  but there wor,' said I; 'Bill and me, and every one on us, we all sawd it as
  bright as ever could be. When did he coom?' Then she says never another word,
  but after looking at me for a minute in a way as makes me shiver to think on,
  she just falls back'ards, and goes off into one o' them there faints. Lor,
  wot a job me and Bill 'ad wi' 'er; didn't us, Bill?"</p>

  <p>The gentleman appealed to withdrew his pipe from his mouth and blew out a
  cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>"A' reckon we did, Jim," he assented vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Well, arter a undoin' of 'er, and pouring pailfuls of cold water over
  'er, and pulling feathers out o' t' old cock's tail to burn under 'er nose,
  and such like means, we got 'er round, but very weak and dazed she seemed. Of
  coors, directly she could speak we asks 'er wot was up.</p>

  <p>"'T' master,' she says, 'master!' 'Well,' says I, 'wot aboot 'im?' He's
  dead,' she whispered. 'Dead!' cried both on us. 'Why a wor 'ere last night,
  surely. Dead!'</p>

  <p>"'Ay, murdered!' she whispered in an awful tone like.</p>

  <p>"'Wheer?' asks Bill, reg'lar skeered.</p>

  <p>"'In Lunnon,' she says, 'day afore yesterday.'</p>

  <p>"I couldna seem to believe it, hearing it so sudden, and I wor all dazed
  like.</p>

  <p>"'But t' loight last noight?' I said to 'er.</p>

  <p>"She pointed to the key which hung upon the wall, and a sort o' cold chill
  ran through me when I sees it, for there was cobwebs all round and on it.</p>

  <p>"'That key,' she says, 'ain't been moved from that nail for nigh on two
  months. It wor t' master's orders when he wor 'ere last time that the room
  wor not to be touched till he coom again.'</p>

  <p>"'But we all seed t' loight,' I says, 'me and Bill, an' all on 'em.'</p>

  <p>"She wor white to the very lips, and her voice wor all o' a tremble.</p>

  <p>"'No one a-been in t' room. If the loight were theer, God help us ail!
  'Twor no earthly hand as lit it.."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-21"
     id="ch1-21">XXI.&mdash;LORD ALCESTON IS PUZZLED.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was a short silence among the little group. The
  stranger alone was looking more thoughtful than impressed.</p>

  <p>"The light has been seen often since then?" he asked, after a few minutes'
  meditation.</p>

  <p>"Ay, moast noights."</p>

  <p>"And are you sure that there is no other entrance into the room save by
  the door of which you saw the key?"</p>

  <p>"Noa; there bean't no other way in."</p>

  <p>"Mrs.&mdash;what did you say her name was&mdash;the housekeeper? She
  couldn't have anything to do with it, or her brother?"</p>

  <p>"We a' seen it when both on um a' been doon 'ere wi' us."</p>

  <p>"It's a strange thing," the young man remarked thoughtfully. "I wonder
  whether it's alight now?"</p>

  <p>He moved toward the door, and they all trooped after him. Jim Doore,
  stepping in front of his guest, lifted the rude wooden latch, and a gust of
  wind came howling in, extinguishing the lamp which he carried in his hand,
  and causing the few prints and texts which hung about to rattle against the
  wall. Bill Foulds, followed by most of the party, turned back to the fireside
  with a muttered anathema against the folly of exposing their
  comfortably-warmed selves to the fury of such a tempest until their time came
  to go; but Jim Doore and his guest stepped outside, closing the door after
  them, and stood for a moment with the rain beating in their faces, and the
  gale shrieking about their ears, gazing at the huge black outline of the
  ruined castle, high up above them. There was no mistake about the lights.
  One, faint and glimmering, low down on the inland side, Jim pointed out as
  coming from "Martha's" room; the other, high up in the tower, right on the
  verge of the cliff, was burning with a steady, brilliant light and was even
  casting a long, livid reflection on the bleak, angry sea below. They looked
  at them steadily for a minute. Then Jim Doore, who was holding the door fast
  in his hand, pushed it a little way open, and followed by his companions,
  re-entered the cottage.</p>

  <p>They moved their chairs and made room for the stranger by the fire, and he
  stood there warming himself after the brief exposure to the storm, with the
  dancing firelight lighting up his thoughtful countenance. They looked at him
  curiously, wondering what he would say now about their mysterious light, and
  wondering, too, as they had been all along, who he was and why he had come to
  this out-of-the-way corner of the world. And there was one among their
  number, a woman, who sat where she had been sitting all the evening,
  unnoticed and almost unseen, whose dark eyes never once left his face, and
  from whose cheeks every vestige of color had fled it his coming. She, too,
  was wondering and dreading.</p>

  <p>"'As to seen t' loight, Jim?" Foulds inquired, removing his pipe from his
  month out of deference to the stranger, for it was not his custom when
  speaking.</p>

  <p>The young man started somewhat, as though the question had broken in upon
  some train of thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's there, right enough," he answered. "If it wasn't such a wild
  night I should feel tempted to go straight away into that room and solve the
  mystery. But since it has puzzled you all so long it may as well do so for
  one day longer. To-morrow night I will see into it."</p>

  <p>There was a stir among the little group.</p>

  <p>"Dost a' think that Mrs. Smith'll let a' go into the room?" Jim Doore
  asked doubtfully. "There's never no stranger passes inside o' them walls. God
  A'mighty!" he exclaimed suddenly, springing to his feet and standing with his
  eyes fastened upon the stranger's. "Look at 'ee!"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Jim?" cried his partner, also rising to his feet and
  following Jim's shaking finger, which was pointed straight at the tall young
  man, who stood calmly before the fire.</p>

  <p>"Look at 'ee, I tell a'," repeated Jim. "'Tis t' earl's own face!"</p>

  <p>Every eye was fixed upon the stranger, and suddenly every one became
  conscious of the resemblance&mdash;every one, that is to say, except Mrs.
  Doore, who had possibly known all about it before, for she never moved a
  muscle of her face.</p>

  <p>"As I don't want you to think me a ghost," the young man said, smiling
  slightly, "perhaps I had better tell you that I am Lord Alceston&mdash;Earl
  of Harrowdean now, I am sorry to say."</p>

  <p>"T' earl's son!" gasped Jim Doore.</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>There was an awestruck silence, which Lord Clanavon broke.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you you've no need to look so frightened," he said,
  pleasantly. "You've all been very kind to me, and I'm sure I'm very much
  obliged to you all."</p>

  <p>A NIGHT JOURNEY. 125</p>

  <p>This speech had the effect of setting them all a little more at their
  ease, but the impossibility of sitting down in the same room with an earl was
  manifest to all of them. With every description of clumsy but respectful
  obeisance they dwindled away one by one, while Jim Doore stood by looking
  helplessly from his wife to his distinguished guest.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Doore; there's nothing to be frightened about," Lord Alceston
  said, smiling, when the last of them had departed. "I'm sure you've all been
  very kind to me. I might have been up on the cliff now if it hadn't been for
  you. Look at your wife, now; she's a sensible woman. She doesn't look a bit
  disturbed. Well, if you won't sit down again"&mdash;for Jim had rigorously
  declined the chair which his lordship had kicked toward him&mdash;"show me
  where I'm to shake down for the night and I'll go to bed."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Doore silently took up a candle, and opened the inner door, revealing
  another apartment beyond.</p>

  <p>"This way, my lord," she said quietly. "I've done my best to make things
  comfortable, but I'm afraid you'll find it rather rough."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston followed her into the tiny apartment, which, small though it
  was, was spotlessly clean and neat.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be nicer," he declared. "Good-night, Mrs. Doore. Ton my
  word," he added to himself, looking round approvingly, "that's a very
  superior woman."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-22"
     id="ch1-22">XXII.&mdash;A NIGHT JOURNEY.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Doore doubtless was a very superior woman, for it was
  quite evident that she had learned one hard lesson for the uneducated to
  acquire&mdash;to conceal her feelings. Directly the latch was securely drawn,
  the distinguished visitor safe in his room, a remarkable change took place in
  her appearance. The unnatural calm was gone. She sank into a low chair
  opposite her husband, her rigid features working with emotion and her
  trembling hands stretched wildly out.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jim, Jim, what shall I do?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her a little astonished. As far as he was concerned he was
  beginning to feel very much more at ease&mdash;in fact his momentary alarm
  was fast diminishing, and was being succeeded by a sort of vague elation.
  After all, the affair was more likely to turn out to his advantage than the
  reverse. The events of the evening passed slowly before him while he had been
  waiting for his wife's reappearance, and on the whole the result was
  satisfactory. He had neither done nor said anything that would be likely to
  give offence to the young earl, although a cold shiver passed through his
  frame when he reflected how many dangers he had unwittingly avoided. They had
  rescued the young lord from what was undoubtedly a most dangerous situation,
  and they had treated him all the time with the sturdy North Country
  hospitality which was one of their chief characteristics. When his wife had
  joined him he had been quite prepared for some mutual congratulations; now
  she had come out white as a ghost and trembling in every limb. Jim scratched
  his head in wonderment.</p>

  <p>"What be amiss, lass?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>She leaned forward and stared at him wildly, as though she had not heard
  his words. Jim began to feel thoroughly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"There bean't nothing wrong, lass, surely?" he said. "Let me be a few
  minutes, Jim," she moaned. "Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?"</p>

  <p>He lit a pipe as the only possible consolation which lay in his power. It
  was the best thing he could have done. Presently she rose, and walked softly
  up and down the room, her husband following her movements with his eyes, but
  maintaining an unbroken silence.</p>

  <p>"Jim," she said, suddenly stopping in front of him, "I've been a good wife
  to you."</p>

  <p>He looked up at her and was startled at the change in her face. Usually a
  healthy-looking woman, the ruddy brown with which sea air and sun had tanned
  her cheeks had fled altogether, leaving them ghastly pale, and her dark eyes
  were literally blazing with some excitement.</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly. "A' hast, lass! I've nowt to say agen that."</p>

  <p>"Then ask me no questions to-night. Reward me by trusting me now. I must
  go out&mdash;and alone!"</p>

  <p>"Go oot&mdash;aloan!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jim; up to the castle!"</p>

  <p>He held up his fingers. "Listen to t' wind," he said; "the storm has nae
  blown itself out yet."</p>

  <p>"Storm or no storm, I must go," she cried passionately. "I must see
  mother."</p>

  <p>The thing suddenly became clear to him. His wife evidently feared that in
  some way her mother had disobeyed or was disobeying orders up at the castle,
  and wished to warn her of her master's forthcoming visit. "Had it anything to
  do with the mysterious light in the south tower?" he wondered.</p>

  <p>"Let Oi take a message," he said. "It's no noight for a' to go."</p>

  <p>"I must be my own messenger," she cried. "Oh, Jim, for God's sake let me
  go! let me go!"</p>

  <p>She had sunk on her knees before him, and was clasping his knees. Jim
  thought no more of exercising his marital authority.</p>

  <p>"A' shall go, lass! A' shall go!" he cried. "Dry thy eyes! A' shall go!
  Coom, and a'll get 'ee the lantern."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet with a sigh of relief, and fetched her hat and cloak.
  Her husband opened the door and handed her the lantern. He did not feel quite
  at his ease about this midnight expedition.</p>

  <p>"Let a' coom wi' ye, lass, to t' gate. All coom no fearther. I doan't like
  thee going aloan."</p>

  <p>"Not a step, Jim!" she cried. "I'll not be long."</p>

  <p>She vanished into the darkness, and Jim, after keeping the door open for a
  minute or two, and gazing after her undecidedly, stepped back into the room,
  shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I doan't like it," he muttered, taking down his pipe, "but she mun ha'e
  her way. She be a woman, and she mun ha'e her way."</p>

  <p>Which showed that Jim, rustic though he was, had some claims toward being
  considered a village philosopher.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-23"
     id="ch1-23">XXIII.&mdash;MRS. SMITH IS WARNED.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Doore was never quite sure afterward how she
  accomplished her journey that night, but accomplish it she did, and in less
  than an hour she stood underneath the huge castle walls. The rest of her task
  was easy. An ordinary farm-yard gate led over what had once been a moat into
  the inner court-yard, upon which the windows of the inhabited portion of the
  building looked. Here she paused for a minute, and taking up a pebble, threw
  it sharply against a window directly opposite. There was a brief interval of
  suspense; then a light appeared, the window was opened, and a woman's head
  slowly appeared.</p>

  <p>"Is there any one there?" she called out softly. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Doore drew a little nearer the window.</p>

  <p>"It is I&mdash;Annie!" she cried. "Let me in, mother."</p>

  <p>"Annie! Annie! At this time of night! What has happened? What do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"Let me in and I will tell you, mother!" she cried. "Quick!"</p>

  <p>The head was withdrawn, and soon there was the sound of heavy bolts
  slipping back from the great oaken door, and the clanking of a chain. Then it
  was opened a little, and Mrs. Doore slipped inside with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Her mother took up the lamp, which she had placed upon the floor, and held
  it high over her head while she looked anxiously into her daughter's face.
  Both women were as pale as death, but of the two Mrs. Smith's appearance was
  the more ghastly. Her gray hair was streaming down her back, and her thin,
  sharpened face was all tremulous with fear, while the long, bony fingers
  which held the lamp shook so that it seemed more than once about to slip from
  her grasp. She stood there with her eyes eagerly scanning her daughter's
  terror-stricken face and bedraggled appearance, but it was some time before
  she could frame a question.</p>

  <p>"What is it, child?" she asked at length, in a low, shaking whisper.
  "Danger?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, mother, I fear so, or I should not be here at this time of the night.
  Lord Alcesto."</p>

  <p>"He is not coming here?" cried her mother.</p>

  <p>"He is here&mdash;at our cottage."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. At first Mrs. Smith had tottered, and had
  seemed about to faint. Her daughter moved quickly to her side, and,
  supporting her with her arm, led her to a chair.</p>

  <p>"What does he want? What has he come here for?" she asked hoarsely. "Does
  he know?"</p>

  <p>Her daughter shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell; I think not. They told him about the light, and I watched
  him all the time. He showed no sign."</p>

  <p>"Perhapp he has only come to see the place," Mrs. Smith said slowly. "He
  has never been here."</p>

  <p>"It may be so; but he has seen the light. He will want to go into that
  room. You must go and warn him at once, and get everything ready."</p>

  <p>The old woman began to tremble again.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do if he stays long?" she exclaimed, wringing her hands.
  "Oh, I shall go mad; I know I shall."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, mother; you mustn't talk like that. Nothing will happen if you
  are careful. You must not let him stir from his room while Lord Clanavon is
  here, not for one moment."</p>

  <p>"Come stop with me, Annie&mdash;do!"</p>

  <p>"I will, mother, I promise you, if he stays. But I must get back now at
  once."</p>

  <p>130 THE PEER AND THE WOMAN.</p>

  <p>"How came he to your cottage?"</p>

  <p>"He had lost his way on the cliffs, and Jim and the lads found him, and
  brought him down. It was a fortunate chance. Now, mother, I must go. Remember
  when he comes to-morrow you know nothing about his being close at hand."</p>

  <p>"I shall remember. But, my child, you are wet through to the skin. Have a
  little brandy&mdash;or shall I make Tom light the fire and get some tea?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, mother. I must go this minute. Look, morning is breaking
  already."</p>

  <p>Far away over the restless gray sea faint streaks of white light were
  breaking through the dark clouds, and were casting a lurid, ghastly coloring
  upon the waste of waters. Side by side mother and daughter stood for a
  minute, watching the struggling morning dawn upon the storm-tossed waves.
  Directly the faint gleams of light had triumphed Mrs. Doore wrapped her shawl
  around her and turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Remember, mother," she said, "it is for his sake. Be careful! Send for me
  as soon as you like after he has come. Good-by now."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Smith drew herself up.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, Annie. Now that I am prepared, the danger is less. I must
  go to him now and prepare him."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-24"
     id="ch1-24">XXIV.&mdash;THE CHAMBER IN THE TOWER:<br>
  A DISCOVERY.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was nearly mid-day when Lord Clanavon, breathless with
  his climb, stood before the heap of ruins which centuries before had been the
  ancestral home of his family. Before making any attempt to discover the
  inhabited portion of it he clambered up on to the outside wall and looked
  around him.</p>

  <p>It was not a cheerful prospect, by any means, that he looked upon. The
  iron-bound cliffs, against which the gray sea came thundering in, looked cold
  and forbidding and lacked any form of vegetation to soften their threatening
  aspect. The country inland, as far as the eye could see, looked barren and
  uncultivated&mdash;a succession of dreary, houseless wastes. The castle
  itself, or rather its remains, were in complete accord with the surroundings.
  There was none of the picturesqueness of most ruins about its crumbled walls
  and bastions. All the sadness of decay was there without the softening hand
  of beauty to gloss it over. Not a sprig of ivy or even lichen had grown upon
  the bare stonework. The fierce sea winds had done their work, and had added
  desolation to destruction.</p>

  <p>He clambered down to terra-firma, and, making his way toward the inhabited
  portion of the building, he saw for the first time a tall, rather
  fine-looking old lady in a straight black silk dress standing in the oaken
  doorway. As he approached she made him a respectful inclination of the head,
  and looked inquiringly at him.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Smith," he said. "I suppose you are Mrs. Smith?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name, sir," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I thought so. I think we have never met before, but you have heard of
  me. I am Lord Clanavon."</p>

  <p>She looked at him and sighed.</p>

  <p>"'Tis easy to see that, my lord," she said. "I'm very glad and proud to
  see you; but it's a poor, miserable place to come to. Will your lordship come
  in?"</p>

  <p>He followed her into the hall, looking curiously around him. She opened
  the doors of the two rooms opening out from it, and showed him them.</p>

  <p>"These are the only habitable rooms, except the one in the south tower, my
  lord," she said.</p>

  <p>He looked around him, and felt woefully disappointed. Everything was
  dreary and common-place, and in the last stage of decay.</p>

  <p>"I should like to go to the room in the south tower," he said: "Isn't that
  the part of the building which my father used to inhabit when he came
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord. There was no other part fit for him."</p>

  <p>"It seems strange to me that he should have come here at all," Lord
  Alceston remarked, strolling to the window. "I had no idea that the place was
  such a complete ruin."</p>

  <p>"I think his lordship used to come here now and then when he had work to
  do which needed complete quiet," she said. "There were no interruptions to be
  feared here&mdash;no gentlemen to call in and see him, and take up his time.
  The place is healthy, too, my lord, and the fishing is very good."</p>

  <p>"So I suppose," he answered. "Fishing is not a favorite sport of mine,
  though, especially sea fishing. I never have any luck. By the bye, Mrs.
  Smith, your face reminds me very much of somebody I've seen lately. Who is
  it, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>If he had been watching her closely he could scarcely have avoided
  noticing the quick start and the sudden movement of her hand to her side. But
  he had strolled to one of the other windows, and his back was turned to her.
  Besides, he was very little interested in the matter.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, my lord, I'm sure," she answered slowly, "unless it may
  have been Mrs. Doore."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Mrs. Doore it was," he assented. "A most respectable woman she
  is, too. What relation is she?"</p>

  <p>"My daughter."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Ah! I can see the likeness quite plainly now," he said, turning
  round. "Fortunate for you, you have relations here. It must be very dull. And
  now suppose we have a look at the south tower."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lord; there is the key," pointing to where it hung, covered
  with cobwebs and dust, on a rusty nail. "It has not been used since his
  lordship was here."</p>

  <p>He followed her down a long passage which smelt very mouldy, across a vast
  room&mdash;once a banqueting hall, now partly open to the skies&mdash;up some
  steps, and along another corridor, in the walls of which were great clefts,
  through which he could see the gray sea rolling beneath. At its extremity
  they came to a great oaken door studded with nails.</p>

  <p>"This is the door of the room, my lord," she said, clutching the handle,
  for the strong salt wind was roaring through great fissures in the roof and
  walls, blowing her stiff skirts around her and carrying her voice far
  away.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston looked downward, and almost at their feet saw the little
  cluster of fishermen's cottages where he had passed the night, looking like
  dolls' houses some six hundred feet below. The sight reminded him of
  something. He drew, in his head and looked curiously at the solid door before
  him.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other key to this door, Mrs. Smith?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Certainly not, my lord; you have the only one."</p>

  <p>"Then this door has not been opened since my father was here last?"</p>

  <p>"It has not, my lord."</p>

  <p>He took off his hat, and held it in his hand, while the wind played havoc
  with his fair hair, which he kept less closely cut than most Englishmen.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've heard about the mysterious light which is supposed to
  shine from this room at nights?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I have heard that there is some story of the sort about among the
  fishermen, my lord," she answered. "They are a superstitious race."</p>

  <p>"So I suppose. But there certainly was a light burning last night which
  appeared to come from this tower," he said. "How do you account for it?"</p>

  <p>She pointed to the flagstaff a little to their right.</p>

  <p>"In very stormy weather, my lord, I have sometimes hung a lantern there as
  a sort of signal. I have a relation who owns coal ships at Mewlton, and I
  promised him that I would do so."</p>

  <p>"Was the lantern there last night?"</p>

  <p>"It was, my lord."</p>

  <p>He looked puzzled for a minute; then he shrugged his shoulders
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"I might have known it was something of this sort," he said. "Now for this
  room."</p>

  <p>He turned the key which he had already fitted into the lock, and slowly,
  with much effort, the door opened. The first thing he noticed was that their
  entrance had disturbed several cobwebs which had hung about the door and in
  the keyhole, and that a thick layer of dust upon the floor was pushed away by
  the movement of the door.</p>

  <p>"That settles it still more conclusively," he remarked. "Proof positive,
  you see, that this door has not been opened for months."</p>

  <p>He stood on the threshold and looked about him curiously, even eagerly.
  The room was quite a small one, hexagonal in shape, and lit by windows at
  each side. The furniture was much more modern than any which he had seen
  about the place, and there was plenty of it. A Turkish carpet covered the
  floor and several old prints and one or two oil paintings hung upon the walls
  above the oak panels. There was nothing in the least degree extraordinary
  about the room, except its incongruity with the rest of the place.</p>

  <p>"Shall you be making any stay here, my lord?" Mrs. Smith asked.</p>

  <p>"Not I," he answered. "I am in search of some papers which belonged to my
  father, and which I thought might be here&mdash;that is why I came."</p>

  <p>"The desk and bureau are just as he left them, my lord," she said softly.
  "I hope that you may find them. I will send you some luncheon here&mdash;such
  as we can get, about one o'clock. And about a bed, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Bed! Oh, I'm not going to sleep here, thanks," he said. "I've sent one of
  the men from down below there to Mewlton for a fly. I expect it will be here
  about five."</p>

  <p>She turned her face away that he might not see her relief. Then she left
  him, closing the door after her.</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon listened to her retreating footsteps until they died away in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>"There's something very queer about that old lady," he said to himself,
  thoughtfully. "She wasn't in the least surprised to see me. She trembled when
  I spoke of that mysterious light, and yet pretended to despise it; and she
  couldn't conceal her delight when I told her that I wasn't going to stop. And
  how she reminds me of some one, too, besides Mrs. Doore. Can't think who the
  mischief it is, though."</p>

  <p>He stood for a few minutes buried in silent thought. Then he moved toward
  the writing-table, which stood facing one of the windows, and sank into the
  chair directly in front of it.</p>

  <p>There were loose papers lying about, many of them covered with memoranda
  in his father's handwriting. He took one of them up reverently. It consisted
  of notes for an article in a review. He tried another. It was a criticism of
  a recent remarkable novel. These were all interesting and must certainly be
  preserved; but they were not what he had come to look for. He put them on one
  side and commenced turning out the drawers.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Harrowdean, admirable public servant though he had been, had
  not been by any means a methodical or orderly man in his private affairs.
  Lord Alceston recognized that fact to his sorrow directly he commenced his
  search. Bills, receipts, invitations, begging letters, letters of
  congratulation, and political letters from the chief of his colleagues, were
  all bundled together in an incongruous heap. At first, he had intended to
  sort them as he went on, but he soon desisted from the attempt and contented
  himself with merely glancing through each bundle of papers and then throwing
  them on one side.</p>

  <p>At last he had examined every drawer but one, and that one none of the
  keys which he had brought with him would open. As soon as he had assured
  himself of this, he looked about him for means of forcing it open, and,
  finding no other, he took up the poker, and with one blow fractured the
  woodwork of the drawer. Through the opening thus made he drew out a little
  bundle of letters and a photograph. Directly his fingers closed upon them he
  felt that his efforts were about to be rewarded.</p>

  <p>136 THE PEER AND THE WOMAN.</p>

  <p>He laid them before him without undoing the broad, black ribbon which
  bound them together. Was it not after all, almost like sacrilege to look at
  them? It seemed to him that they were somehow sacred&mdash;sacred to the
  dead. If his father were living would he have them opened? And yet, on the
  other hand, it was no curiosity which was prompting him. He had no
  wish&mdash;he rather felt a shrinking from any attempt&mdash;to bring into
  the light of day a past which his father had left buried. But there were
  other things to be thought of. There was guilt to be punished and a hideous
  crime had gone unpunished. There was more, too; there was a vague suspicion
  floating in the mind of one person at least too horrible to be breathed, too
  horrible for him to accept even for a single second. But a time might come
  when it would be better that he could of his own knowledge turn upon it the
  ridicule which it merited. The time might come when, as well as avenger he
  might have to play the part of defender, and it would be well for him to be
  prepared. He hesitated no longer. It seemed to him that his duty lay plain
  before him.</p>

  <p>And yet his fingers trembled a little as he untied the ribbon. It seemed
  to him so like desecration&mdash;so like doing a mean action for expediency's
  sake. But it must be done&mdash;it was done. The six or seven letters, yellow
  with age, and emitting a faint musky perfume, lay open before him, and the
  photograph was in his hands.</p>

  <p>It had been taken out of doors&mdash;probably by an amateur&mdash;for
  there was no photographer's name at the back, and no address. But it had been
  very well taken. Many years old though it must have been, the figures were
  still distinct and unfaded, and Lord Clanavon felt a strange sensation
  creeping over him as he gazed at them. It was his father&mdash;he knew that
  in a moment; but the woman! Who was she?</p>

  <p>His hand trembled a little as he laid it down. His mind had been full of
  something of this sort when he commenced his search, but the discovery was a
  shock to him. He told himself that he had expected it, that if he had not
  found it he would have been disappointed. But none the less in his heart he
  knew that it was a great shock. He, himself, was no Puritan, but there were
  some sins, taken often as a matter of course by young men in his position, to
  which he had never stooped. He had no very high ideals of life, and it had
  been, perhaps, somewhat a selfish one&mdash;at any rate, only negatively
  good. But he had a strong sense of right and wrong, and a strong will to back
  up his knowledge; and while his life was only negatively good, it had ever
  been positively bad. And so this photograph and those letters breathing out a
  faint delicate odor of some unknown perfume seemed very terrible to him.</p>

  <p>He looked again into the face of the woman who was standing with her hand
  resting upon his father's shoulder. Yes, she was beautiful; there was no
  denying it. There was witchery in those large full eyes and in the delicate
  curve of the little mouth, witchery in the fair hair which floated around her
  oval face and in the tall, supple figure. Whether it was the face of a good
  woman or no it was the face of a beautiful one.</p>

  <p>He took up one of the letters and opened it with less reverence than he
  would have done had he not seen the photograph. As he read, his cheeks burned
  with a sort of shame that he should be reading what was so evidently only
  meant for the eyes of one&mdash;and that one his father! It was a passionate
  love-letter, written in French, and signed simply, "Cecile."</p>

  <p>Two others were in the same strain, and similarly devoid of anything which
  could help him in the least. Toward the close of the third, however, there
  was a passage which he read twice over:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">And you will be here the day after to-morrow. Ah! it seems
  too great happiness to think of it! How I long to see you, Bernard, and how
  weary the days have seemed when you have been so far away, and I have been
  shut up here alone with <i>mon père</i> and with Marie! There have been so
  many things to worry and perplex me. One of these I must tell you, dearest,
  and&mdash;you will not be cross with your Cecile&mdash;I must ask you a
  favor. It is about Marie, Bernard. When you first came to see us I almost
  fancied sometimes that it was for her you cared. You talked to her so
  often&mdash;much oftener than to me, and, Bernard, I think that she fancied
  so, too. Her whole manner has changed to me, since&mdash;you know when. I
  fear that she is jealous; nay, I know it. She seems to think that I have
  stolen your love away from her. Tell me, Bernard, dearest, is it so? Did you
  ever care for her?</p>

  <p class="cp">* * *</p>

  <p class="letter">My father is much brighter, and says that his trouble has
  passed away; and, Bernard, he says that it is you who have made him so much
  happier. I fear that you have been sending him money, and, dearest, I wish
  that you would not; it all goes like water. It seems as though he were born
  to be in difficulties; and though it is very sweet to me in one way to think
  of you as being our preserver, still it makes me ashamed and unhappy. You
  give all, and what return can you have? Only my love, and that is yours
  forever and ever in any case.</p><br>

  <p>There was another letter&mdash;the last of the packet&mdash;written in a
  different handwriting, and very much shorter than the others. Its first
  sentence was a shock to him, greater by far than any which he had yet
  received. Unlike the others, it was dated and bore an address:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">18 Rue De St. Pierre, Paris</span>, May
  5, &mdash;&mdash;8.<br>
  <br>
  My sister Cecile died yesterday afternoon in my arms. It was her wish, a few
  hours before the end came, that I should send for you, but as it was
  impossible that you could arrive in time, I did not trouble you. The messages
  she left fell upon deaf ears, as you may be sure that you will never receive
  them from me. Had she lived a little longer she would doubtless have lived to
  curse your memory, as I do.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Marie</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">P. S.&mdash;I enclose a copy of her death
  certificate.</p><br>

  <p>But the greatest surprise of all was to come. There remained one more
  paper in the little bundle, and surely the most important was last. It was a
  copy of a marriage certificate between Bernard Clanaxon, bachelor, and Cecile
  Maurice, spinster, at an English church in the suburbs of Paris, thirty years
  ago.</p>

  <p><br>
  Lord Clanavon sat for more than an hour deep in thought. He had unearthed a
  secret which greatly disturbed him and which did not throw the faintest light
  upon his quest. This early marriage of his father's was a thing long since
  past and buried. If there had been no marriage, and if she who signed herself
  Cecile had been living, there might have been a clew; but as it was the whole
  thing was like a story finished, a page turned over forever. After so long a
  lapse of years what could have survived from this apparently ill-fated
  marriage which could in any way have cast a shadow so far into the future? As
  he folded the little bundle of papers up and placed them in his pocket Lord
  Clanavon felt that he would have given much never to have found them.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to examine in the room. He strolled aimlessly
  around, looking at the pictures and out of the windows at the fine sea view.
  As he turned round he trod upon a newspaper, and with a very weak curiosity
  he stooped and picked it up. At the first glance he knitted his brows,
  perplexed, and turned it over rapidly. Then he gave a quick start of
  surprise, and a sudden flash of excitement flashed into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he muttered, "there's some mystery here, after all. Eight
  months, Mrs. Smith tells me, this room has been locked up, and on the floor
  here is last week's <i>Times</i>!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-25"
     id="ch1-25">XXV.&mdash;"THANK GOD THAT HE HAS GONE!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For some time Lord Clanavon stood with the paper in his hand
  doubtful how to act. Then he quietly dropped it again where he had found it
  and strolled away to another part of the room. When Mrs. Smith entered a few
  minutes later, with the luncheon tray, he did not even mention the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Not at all an unpleasant room, this," he remarked, as she commenced
  setting out the things; "but where did my father sleep when he came down
  here?"</p>

  <p>He was watching her very closely, and he could detect a slight uneasiness
  in her manner as she answered, after a moment's hesitation:</p>

  <p>"In here, sir. There is a sort of chair bedstead stands in my room, and he
  used to have that brought here. If you are spending the night here, my
  lord."</p>

  <p>"I am not," he interrupted. "I shall be leaving this afternoon."</p>

  <p>It was impossible for Mrs. Smith to altogether conceal her relief. Lord
  Clanavon noticed her changed aspect, but he made no remark.</p>

  <p>"This is a very queer old place, Mrs. Smith," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is, my lord, very old-fashioned, and I'm sure the damp is something
  awful. In the wet weather I'm most of the time down with rheumatics. For them
  who's not used to such places it must be most unhealthy."</p>

  <p>He turned away to hide a slight smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised to hear it, Mrs. Smith," he said gravely. "By the bye,
  when I was a youngster I used to hear some queer stories about the
  place&mdash;or was it my fancy? Aren't there some secret rooms in this tower,
  and a passage leading somewhere or other? I fancy I used to hear my father
  talk about them."</p>

  <p>He had strolled away to the window, but had carefully placed himself
  opposite a small mirror. In it he saw the sudden start which had set all the
  ribbons in her cap rustling, and watched the deadly pallor creep into her
  wrinkled face. It was enough for him. He forbore to turn around, and stood
  idly gazing out of the window, as though the matter were of small interest to
  him.</p>

  <p>"It must be&mdash;a mistake, my lord. I have never heard of any."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Very likely. If you have never heard of any it must have been. Well, I'll
  have some luncheon now, and then finish looking through these papers. I
  expect a fly or carriage of some sort here about four o'clock. Will you let
  me know when it is here, and bring me a cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lord. Is there anything else I can do now?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, thank you, Mrs. Smith. Your chickens look very good, and the air
  has given me an appetite. Where did this claret come from?"</p>

  <p>"Your father had it sent here, my lord, several years ago. There is a
  great deal of it in the cellar."</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad to hear it," he answered, emptying his glass. "I think I'll
  have it sent back to London, as I don't intend coming down here again. It's
  too good to lose sight of. There's nothing else at present, Mrs. Smith."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord. I'm sorry you'll find there's no bell; but I'll come
  for the tray in half an hour."</p>

  <p>She left him alone, closing the door carefully after her. When she
  returned he had finished his lunch and was seated once more at the
  writing-table. This time, as he appeared to be busy, there was no
  conversation between them. She cleared the things away in silence and
  departed.</p>

  <p>He waited until she had got out of hearing before he moved. Then he lit a
  cigar, and, opening the door, walked out into the corridor connecting the
  tower with the main building. A few yards down it there was a great fissure
  in the inland wall. He leaned over this, and folding his arms upon the
  stonework looked thoughtfully at the tower.</p>

  <p>Two things struck him about it: First, that taking into account the small
  size of the room which he had just quitted, the walls must either be of
  extraordinary thickness, or there must be some hollow space between;
  secondly, that from its great height, and the fact of the only room in it
  being right at the top, it had probably been built for a watch-tower. The
  last theory made the possibility of the existence of any secret rooms about
  the place somewhat unlikely. Yet it seemed a very feasible one; for a strong
  light burning in that little chamber at the top of the tower would cast its
  reflection far over the sea which rolled in to its very base.</p>

  <p>If there had been time, and if he could have been sure that Mrs. Smith was
  not watching him, he would have liked by some means to go down on the beach
  below, and examine the tower from its base. But glancing at his watch, he saw
  that there was scarcely time for this, so he determined to put the plan which
  he had previously determined upon into execution. He walked back into the
  room, and, throwing away his cigar, carefully examined the walls on the north
  side. He tried them inch by inch all the way along without result. They were
  perfectly solid stone and mortar. He looked all round the fireplace; it was
  even more unpromising. Then he tried the walls on the other side, though he
  hoped for a little from these, for from the window he could tell that there
  was not much space for a passage of any sort between the inside and outside
  of the wall. Finally he concluded his search with shrug of the shoulders, and
  confessed himself beaten-for the time.</p>

  <p>He lit another cigar, and sitting down in the easy chair, once more read
  through the little packet of letters which he had secured. They told him so
  little, and yet so much. He could scarcely see, now that he had them, how to
  act. It was all vague and unsatisfactory. In his heart he knew that he was
  sorry that he had found them. It was a chapter of his father's life which had
  better have been kept closed forever. Had it not been for that marriage
  certificate&mdash;had there been mention of an angry father or brother, of
  the disgrace which, save for that slip of paper, he might have brought upon
  that dead woman and her family&mdash;then it might have been possible to
  connect this incident with his father's murder, and thus he might have hunted
  down the assassin. But as it was it seemed to him impossible to do so. This
  was an episode, a startling episode, but it had a finite ending. It was
  finished and done with. There was no point in it which he could lay hold of
  and follow out with any hope of its leading him to a definite clew.</p>

  <p>Four o'clock came, and soon afterward Mrs. Smith knocked at the door and
  entered, carrying a small bag.</p>

  <p>"The fly from Mewlton has arrived, my lord, and I have brought you your
  tea."</p>

  <p>He drank it, then carefully locked up the writing-desk, and prepared to
  depart.</p>

  <p>"I shall send down here some time, Mrs. Smith," he said, "for the papers
  in that desk. I will let you know when. Or perhaps I may write and ask you to
  forward them. You will be able to do that?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lord. I would use great care."</p>

  <p>He drew on his overcoat, and then swung the key thoughtfully backward and
  forward upon his finger.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said, "until I do so I had better take the key and let Mr.
  Brudnell have it."</p>

  <p>She seemed a little disturbed, and there was an anxious gleam in her eyes.
  But she struggled to hide it.</p>

  <p>"It would be perfectly safe here, my lord, where you found it. I would not
  let it out of my sight."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it, Mrs. Smith," he said, walking by her side down the
  corridor; "but lawyers are very particular sort of people, you know, and
  there are important papers in that desk. I think, in fact, I know, that Mr.
  Brudnell would prefer having the key himself."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my lord." They passed through the gallery and the dreary
  succession of uninhabited and uninhabitable rooms, and out into the yard,
  where a closed fly, drawn by a pair of nondescripts&mdash;one pony and a
  horse&mdash;was waiting. Lord Alceston took his seat at once, and made his
  adieus to Mrs. Smith from the window.</p>

  <p>"Good-day, Mrs. Smith. Much obliged for your attention."</p>

  <p>"Good-day, my lord, and thank you."</p>

  <p>She dropped him an old-fashioned courtesy and stood with a very forced
  smile on her lips, till the carriage drove off. As it vanished her whole
  appearance changed.</p>

  <p>She had stood watching the vehicle with a fixed eager gaze, which changed
  the moment it finally disappeared into a look of intense relief. The tears
  glistened in her eyes and her lips trembled. It had been a great strain on
  her, but, thank God! it was over. He had gone. Thank God for it!</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-26"
     id="ch1-26">XXVI.&mdash;A SPRING DOOR.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The carriage which was conveying Lord Alceston back toward
  more civilized regions had scarcely proceeded more than a couple of miles
  when its occupant thrust his head out of the window and called to the driver
  to stop. The man pulled up at once and turned round to find that his lordship
  had dismounted and was standing by his side.</p>

  <p>"Look here, my man," he said slowly, "do you want to earn a
  sovereign?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't make no objection to that, your lordship," answered the man,
  touching his hat with a broad grin of anticipation. By his accent and
  readiness of speech he was evidently no provincial.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, listen to me, and I'll tell you how," Lord Alceston
  continued. "I've altered my mind about going away to-day. Don't ask any
  questions, but just do as I tell you. Drive back to the inn, and simply say
  that you were not wanted, but are to come to the castle for me to-morrow
  morning. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, your lordship. Am I to drive you back to the castle now, or
  leave you here?"</p>

  <p>"You are to leave me here. I shall return on foot."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your lordship," the man answered, gathering up his reins.</p>

  <p>"You can go."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your lordship."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you start?"</p>

  <p>The man touched his hat and smiled insinuatingly.</p>

  <p>"There was a small amount to be earned, your lordship."</p>

  <p>"And you want it in advance, do you?" Lord Alceston remarked, smiling and
  feeling in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this, your lordship," the man said, confidentially, "they
  might not put me on the job tomorrow, and then, you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston handed him up the coin.</p>

  <p>"There you are, then. You're no fool, I see. Remember to keep a still
  tongue in your head."</p>

  <p>"There ain't no fear, your lordship. I knows wot I'm to say, and no more.
  I wish your lordship good-afternoon."</p>

  <p>The man drove off and left Lord Alceston standing in the middle of the
  road. It was barely five o'clock, but it was already almost dark. Buttoning
  up his coat, he turned round, and with the wind in his teeth, started back
  toward the castle. In about half an hour he had reached the side of the cliff
  fronting the bay, immediately above the cottages, and about a quarter of a
  mile from the castle, which was now in full view.</p>

  <p>He looked first at the tower. There was no light there. He drew a quick
  breath of disappointment, although it was only what he had expected. He
  looked around him, and choosing a flat rock, a little sheltered from the
  wind, he sat down and lit a cigar.</p>

  <p>An hour passed, two hours&mdash;three hours. Lord Alceston was smoking his
  last cigar, his feet were numbed with cold, and his patience was almost
  exhausted. Suddenly he jumped to his feet with a quick exclamation. A light
  had suddenly appeared in the dark outline before him, and after twinkling
  unsteadily for a minute or two had settled down to burn with a clear, steady
  glow. He threw away his cigar and watched it with a peculiar smile. There
  could be no possible doubt about it. It came from the chamber in the tower,
  the key of which was at that very moment in his pocket.</p>

  <p><br>
  Mrs. Smith was sitting alone in her room, half parlor, half kitchen, with her
  eyes closed and her hands idle in her lap. Before her on the oaken table was
  an open Bible, a lamp, and her knitting, but neither had received very much
  attention from her. She was an old woman, and for her it had been a terrible
  day. The suspense had wearied her, and now that it was over she was feeling
  the strain. But she was very grateful. She felt that she had reason to be,
  and she was genuinely grateful.</p>

  <p>Hark! What was that? Surely not a clicking of the latch! It must have been
  the wind&mdash;a mouse. Hark! Was that not a footstep on the stone flags?
  Some one had entered the house&mdash;was closing the door. Oh, God, if it
  should be he, come back!</p>

  <p>She clutched the side of her chair, and slowly opened her eves. Before
  her, his hair tossed by the wind and the rain streaming from his clothes,
  stood Lord Alceston, with pale set face, and holding something in his right
  hand which flashed and gleamed in the dancing firelight. She looked at him,
  dumb, her eyes glazed with an unutterable horror and her aged limbs shaking.
  It was an awful moment. The perspiration stood in great beads on her dry,
  wrinkled forehead. Often afterward she wondered that the strings of her life
  had not snapped with the tension. It was enough to kill her.</p>

  <p>His voice broke the spell which had numbed all her senses.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Smith," he said, sternly, "you have lied to me about that room.
  There is some one in there now. I am going to solve this mystery for
  myself."</p>

  <p>Consciousness had come to her like a flash. She knew what it was he
  proposed to do; she foresaw the result. She saw the stern, set look in his
  face and the barrel of the revolver in his hand. It was the face of a man
  undaunted, indomitable, fearless. Yet she tried her best.</p>

  <p>She threw herself on her knees before him. She grovelled at his feet.</p>

  <p>"My lord," she cried. "Listen to me! Be warned! As sure as there is a God
  in Heaven I swear to you that you will repent it every day of your life if
  you do this thing!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her curiously, but utterly unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Though I face death itself I shall go to that room and discover its
  occupant," he said quietly. "You have done ill in keeping this thing secret
  from me, whatever it be, and if you have made my house the refuge of
  criminals you shall answer for it, old woman though you are. Get up. You do
  no good there."</p>

  <p>She sprang toward him and wound her arms around his neck to hold him back.
  He disengaged himself as gently as he could, but still with some little
  force. With a shriek which rang through the bare rooms and empty ruined
  corridors and awoke a thousand strange echoes at every corner, she sank back
  upon the bare stone floor fainting.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, but it was only for a second. She must take her chance. He
  could do little for her if he stayed, and if the sound of her cry had reached
  the tower he might find the occupant fled. Catching up the lamp in his left
  hand, he hurried away along the wide gallery.</p>

  <p>Twice he lost his way and had to retrace his steps, and many times he
  stumbled over the startled rats and nearly fell. At last he reached the
  ruined corridors leading to the tower, and his heart gave a great leap. He
  strode along with the key ready in his hand. When he reached the part where
  there was a great gap in the side and roof the wind blew his lamp out. He
  threw it away over the side, and heard it go crashing down below. With his
  free hand he drew his revolver from his pocket and hurried on.</p>

  <p>He reached the door and thrust the key in the lock. It was stiff and
  creaked in the turning. There was a sound from inside like a sharp report.
  Lord Clanavon, with a final wrench, threw the door open and stepped quickly
  inside.</p>

  <p>A lamp was burning on the table which had been his father's, and a book
  lay open beside it. There was a strong smell of tobacco in the room, and
  there were other evidences of recent occupation. But the room bad no
  occupant. It was empty.</p>

  <p>148 THE PEER AND THE WOMAN.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston looked eagerly around for some clew as to the means by which
  the mysterious occupant had escaped him. Suddenly a certain part of the floor
  attracted his notice. The carpet was all disarranged and two of the oaken
  beams were aslant from a certain point, as though on a hinge. He stooped down
  to examine them closer and saw at once that they formed a trap= door. He
  lifted it, and below was an iron ladder leading into darkness as black as
  night.</p>

  <p>He did not hesitate for more than a moment. Then slipping his revolver
  into his pocket and grasping the sides of the ladder with both hands, he
  commenced the descent. Five, six, seven, eight steps he counted. Then it
  began to get a little lighter, and from the ninth he stepped off on to some
  sort of flooring. There was no sound, no sign of any one else being near.</p>

  <p>He struck a match and looked curiously about him. He was in a chamber
  similar in shape to, only smaller than, the one which he had just quitted,
  but windowless, and with no signs of ever having been regularly used as a
  human habitation. The walls were damp and spotted with fungi and huge
  cobwebs, the floor was rough and uneven, and a vault-like, musty smell filled
  the place. The only light came from a small opening in the wall on the
  seaward side, which seemed also to afford the sole means of ventilation.</p>

  <p>A little heap in the far corner attracted Lord Clanavon's attention, and
  he made his way carefully toward it. Unfit though the place was, it had
  evidently been used by some one as a temporary lodging, for here in the
  driest portion were a heap of bedclothes, linen, and a few other articles
  bundled together, as though in great haste, with the view of hiding them.
  Directly he saw them Lord Clanavon knew that the object of his search could
  not be far away.</p>

  <p>He struck another match, and looked around to see what means of exit the
  place afforded. Almost opposite him was a small wooden door, rotten with age
  and tottering on its hinges. Some efforts seemed to have been made to
  strengthen it, for sprung iron hooks were roughly tied up with rope, but
  there was neither lock nor bolt to it.</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon looked at it for a minute, and then took a quick step
  forward and lit another match. There was no doubt about it. The door was
  shaking slightly backward and forward, as though held on the other side by an
  unsteady hand. Drawing a step nearer, and listening, he could hear a faint,
  low sound&mdash;the sound of an exhausted and panting man struggling to hold
  Ads breath.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-27"
     id="ch1-27">XXVII.&mdash;IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It did not take Lord Alceston long to make up his mind as to
  what course to adopt. Dropping the match which he had been holding upon the
  ground, he strode up to the door and leaned his shoulder against it.</p>

  <p>"Whoever you are," he cried, "you had better come gut and let me see you!
  If you don't I shall burst the door!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer, save a half-stifled moan. Lord Alceston planted his
  feet firmly upon the ground and prepared for the struggle.</p>

  <p>"I warn you to stand aside!" he called out. "I am going to have this door
  open!"</p>

  <p>Again there was no answer. Lord Alceston wasted no more time in
  parleyings. Setting his teeth, he commenced the struggle.</p>

  <p>He did not find the task of overcoming his unseen adversary quite so easy
  as he had expected. For nearly a minute he put forth his whole strength, but
  his feet slipped more than once on the damp slippery ground, and when on the
  eve of success he had lost his advantage and had been obliged to make a fresh
  start. The labored breath and groans of his adversary told him that he was in
  sore distress, but nevertheless he held on, and though the door creaked and
  trembled with the strain put upon it, it never budged an inch.</p>

  <p>Breathless himself, Lord Alceston relinquished his efforts, and after a
  moment's consideration changed his tactics. Stepping back into the room, he
  took a few yards' run, and charged the door with irresistible force. The
  result was an unexpected one. The door went down before him with a crash, and
  he, not being prepared for such an easy victory, overbalanced himself and
  fell heavily upon it.</p>

  <p>He picked himself up at once, unhurt, but a trifle dizzy. The reason of
  his fall was obvious. The opposing force which had been holding the door up
  had vanished. His adversary had fled.</p>

  <p>He stood quite still for a moment, leaning forward into the darkness and
  listening intently. At first it seemed to him that the silence was as the
  silence of the grave; then as his senses grew a little more accustomed to his
  surroundings, he could faintly hear the sound of stealthy retreating
  footsteps.</p>

  <p>His first impulse was to leap forward in the direction from which the
  sound came, and follow it in blind pursuit. Then he hesitated, for he was in
  black darkness, unrelieved by a single gleam of light. Feeling hastily in his
  pocket, he found his match-box&mdash;fortunately full&mdash;and, striking a
  light, held it high over his head.</p>

  <p>He glanced around in hasty curiosity. The faint, flickering light was just
  sufficient to show him the bare, damp walls of a winding passage about six
  feet broad and scarcely so high&mdash;nothing else.</p>

  <p>After a momentary glance he threw the match down, and stooping low to
  avoid knocking his head against the roof, he turned and hurried in the
  direction of the fleeting footsteps, now almost indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>It was a chase which he remembered all his life&mdash;and with reason.
  More than once he missed his footing on the wet, slimy earth and fell forward
  on his hands. But the sound, now plainly to be heard, of the hurrying
  footsteps in front was enough to spur him on again, heedless of his aching
  limbs and cut hands. He ran into the jagged walls at sharp curves, bruising
  his face and arm; and at times he felt almost choked by the noxious air. But
  he never dreamed of giving up the chase. So far from that, every fall seemed
  to make him more eager and to lend him renewed strength.</p>

  <p>Beneath a somewhat careless and insouciante manner, acquired during his
  travels abroad, Lord Alceston was a thorough Englishman, and was possessed of
  a bull-dog tenacity of purpose. All this part of him was aroused now. Anger
  and surprise had become merged in another and a stronger feeling. There had
  been a conspiracy to deceive him. His property was being made the refuge of
  one who dared not live in the light of day&mdash;who was presumably a
  criminal; and, most heinous offence of all, his permission had not been
  asked! The shelter of his roof had been taken advantage of by stealth. Lord
  Alceston was very angry indeed. Danger and discomfort were alike forgotten.
  There was only one thought in his mind, and one purpose; and he meant to
  accomplish it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the intense vault-like stillness of the place was broken by a
  strange, awful sound reaching him, faintly at first, but increasing in volume
  at every step forward he took. There is a sensation akin to fear, yet apart
  from cowardice&mdash;awe. Lord Alceston felt it as he paused and listened
  with bated breath. At first it sounded like the low rumbling of a threatened
  earthquake&mdash;like the thunderous splitting up of hills and mountains and
  the parting asunder of the solid earth. He stood quite still for a moment,
  listening intently. The ground beneath his feet was soft and wet; the walls
  were glistening with drops of wet which seemed to be oozing out from them. He
  put his foot on a soft, pulpish substance, and saw that it was a starfish
  clinging to a mass of dull brown, dank seaweed. Then the truth flashed in
  upon him, and he understood at once that low rumbling sound which seemed to
  make the walls of the passage shake and groan&mdash;this underground passage
  must lead to the sea.</p>

  <p>He pushed on again without hesitation. Drowned in the monotonous roar
  which was singing now in his ears, he had no longer the sound of the
  footsteps in front to encourage him. But a few more yards along the passage
  brought him within measurable distance of the end of his quest. The passage
  contracted into an opening scarcely wide enough for a man to creep through.
  Without a moment's pause he crawled through. Then he saw that he could go but
  a little further, for scarcely a dozen yards in front of him was another
  wider opening, like the mouth of a cave, and beyond there was the sea.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston stood upright, and looked eagerly around him. In the dusky
  semi-twilight it was hard to make out at, all the shapeless objects which
  loomed about him. By degrees, however, as his eyes grew more accustomed to
  the light, they stood out clearer, and he began to take in his surroundings.
  He was in a cave, a low, sea-stained cave, terminating in the aperture by
  which he had entered. The sides were dripping with wet, and the ground,
  strewn with sea-weed and dark puddles, showed him that at high tide the sea
  entered. Several huge mounds of rock jutted up by his side in queer,
  fantastic shapes. Save for the dripping of the water into the puddles from
  the roof and sides of the cave, and the more distant ebb and flow of the sea,
  a deep, gloomy silence seemed to brood over the place. Nowhere was there any
  sign of any human being.</p>

  <p>He had already taken one hasty step forward toward the entrance when a
  curious phenomenon presented itself. From behind one of the masses of rock,
  on his left-hand side, he became suddenly aware of a pair of bright,
  glistening eyes fastened upon him. At first he was almost inclined to think
  that they were starfish, but while he hesitated the dark, thin figure of a
  man stole out from behind the shelter of the rock and darted toward the
  aperture of the secret passage. Before he had taken half a dozen steps,
  however, Lord Alceston's right arm was wound around his neck, and he felt
  himself lifted bodily from his feet.</p>

  <p>An unearthly cry rang out into the silence, and was echoed back from the
  roof and-sides of the cave till it died away in a plaintive wail&mdash;a cry
  which seemed to come from a soul in agony, rather than from any mortal being
  in physical fear. Lord Alceston shuddered, but he only tightened his
  grasp.</p>

  <p>"Out into the light!" he cried, fiercely dragging his captive toward the
  entrance of the cave. "Let me see the face of the man who has led me this mad
  chase!"</p>

  <p>The man sank down upon the ground as though exhausted.</p>

  <p>"For the love of God and for your own everlasting peace of mind, Lord
  Bernard," he moaned, "leave me here! I swear by everything that is holy in
  heaven or earth that it will be better for you not to look upon my face. Let
  me go! Oh, let me go!"</p>

  <p>"Not I!" cried Lord Alceston, peering through the twilight in a vain
  attempt to distinguish the features of his captive. "Get up, and come
  outside, or by heaven I'll carry you."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Lord Clanavon!" cried the other in a weak, hollow tone.
  "There is no exit from this cave, and as the tide comes in that passage,"
  pointing backward, "is impassable. Go back quickly, or you will be too late,
  and leave me here. Death will be welcome to me."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston made no answer, but reaching down he lifted up the crouching
  form like a baby, and stooping low down he carried him to the entrance of the
  cave and out into the fading daylight. Then he set him down.</p>

  <p>"Get up, and don't lie there grovelling like a woman," he said sternly.
  "Get up, and tell me what you mean by this strange behavior, and who you
  are."</p>

  <p>The man did not move. Lord Clanavon stooped down on one knee, and tore
  asunder the interlaced hands, which covered the wan, thin face. Then he let
  them go as though they had stung him, and staggered back.</p>

  <p>"Neillson!" he cried. "My God!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-28"
     id="ch1-28">XXVIII.&mdash;ALONE WITH THE SEA-GULLS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was a dead silence between the two men after the
  recognition. Lord Alceston had stepped back a pace or two, and was leaning
  against a fragment of rock with a dazed look in his face. Neillson had risen
  slowly and with difficulty to his feet, and was standing quite still,
  breathing hard, and with his eyes fixed upon the wide expanse of sea. It was
  a strange meeting, not devoid of a certain dramatic interest. But the first
  sentence which passed between them was a common-place one.</p>

  <p>"You have been ill," Lord Alceston said slowly.</p>

  <p>The man laughed&mdash;a strange, hollow, little laugh, which, low though
  it was, was caught up and echoed back from the cliffs with grim effect.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I have been ill," he answered, looking down at himself curiously.</p>

  <p>His clothes, once black, now stained and soiled with sea water and wet
  sand, hung about him in loose, empty folds. There were hollows underneath his
  cheek bones and deep black lines under his restless, unnaturally bright eyes.
  A continual tremor seemed to have laid hold of his shrunken form, and his
  breathing came with great difficulty. His appearance was very much the
  appearance of a man who has risen from his death-bed.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I have been ill," he repeated, suddenly turning round and facing the
  other. "Why have you come here, Lord Alceston? Why could you not have let me
  die in peace?"</p>

  <p>"I came, not in search of you," was the answer. "I came to go through some
  of my father's papers, and discovered that some one was living in secrecy in
  my own house. Had I not the right to know who it was? How came you here?"</p>

  <p>"I came because it was a safe hiding-place."</p>

  <p>"How was it that Mrs. Smith has sheltered you?"</p>

  <p>"She is my mother. Mothers will do a great deal to save their sons from
  the gallows, you know. Besides, she had instructions from the countess."</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Your mother?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Ay; she is my mother."</p>

  <p>"But her name is Smith."</p>

  <p>"So is mine. The earl always called me Neillson because it had been the
  name of his first servant and he couldn't get out of using it. That was many
  years ago.. The name has become my own."</p>

  <p>"Neillson," said Lord Alceston, slowly, "if I had known that it was you
  who were occupying that secret chamber I might have gone away and left you in
  peace. I say&mdash;I might; whether I should have done so or no I cannot
  tell. But now that we have met face to face and alone," he glanced round with
  a slight shudder, as though for the first time aware of the dreariness of the
  surroundings, "you shall tell me&mdash;about that night."</p>

  <p>"May God seal my lips forever if I do!" cried Neillson, passionately. "Oh,
  be wise, Lord Clanavon! I have been a faithful servant&mdash;faithful to
  death," he added in a lower tone, "for I stand even now upon the threshold of
  death. I can say no more. You may believe me a murderer if you will. You may
  take me up and throw me into the sea if you will. I will not resist. I could
  not if I would. But I will tell you nothing."</p>

  <p>"What if I have you arrested as my father's murderer? There is a warrant
  out against you."</p>

  <p>"Then if I lived so long I should probably be hanged," he answered. "I am
  no scholar, my lord, but I remember two lines of Shakespeare, which struck me
  once:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"'You may as well go stand upon the shore,<br>
  And bid the main Flood bate his usual height.'</p><br>

  <p>"Lord Clanavon, you may as well go stand upon that rock and cry out to the
  waves to come no further, as bid me tell you anything about that night!"</p>

  <p>There was a force in his shaking voice which spoke of a resolution which
  no words could shake. Lord Alceston turned round without another word.</p>

  <p>"Let us go from this place," he said, with a shudder. "How came you to
  know of that passage?"</p>

  <p>"From the earl. I never thought to be obliged to use it, though to have to
  creep about the bowels of the earth like a hunted rat."</p>

  <p>They stooped down and entered the cave. Then both started, and a look of
  horror flashed into Neillson's white face.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he cried. "Listen!" His voice was well-nigh drowned in the wild
  roar of rushing water and its heavy splashing against the rock-hewn sides of
  the passage. While they stood there a torrent of green sea streaked with
  white came foaming out of the entrance to the secret way, and reached to
  their feet.</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;Lord Bernard!" cried Neillson, wringing his hands. "I am a
  murderer now indeed. Fool, idiot, that I was to keep you here."</p>

  <p>"What has happened&mdash;what does this mean?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"The sea is round us. It floods the secret passage at every tide, and it
  has done so now. We cannot get back."</p>

  <p>"And here&mdash;does the tide reach here?" cried Lord Alceston.</p>

  <p>Neillson pointed to the dripping roof.</p>

  <p>"The cave is submerged," he answered, bitterly.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston rushed outside. Already the long waves were rolling to
  within a few yards of the cave's mouth, and the salt spray was dashed in
  showers into his face as he stood there. He looked wildly around. The cliffs
  on either side stood far out into the sea, and nowhere on their smooth
  perpendicular sides, shining with wet, was there the least chance of
  ascending even a few feet. While he stood there gazing hopelessly around, a
  great wave can-e bounding out from the mouth of the cave behind and flowed
  around him almost to his knees. Dripping with wet and breathless, Neillson
  staggered out to his side, sobbing and crying.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord Bernard! Lord Bernard," he cried, "I have brought you here to
  die. God forgive me!" Lord Alceston was pale, and there was a sad, wistful
  look in his blue eyes. But there was no fear in his face. He was something of
  a philosopher, something of a Christian, and altogether a high-spirited young
  Englishman, with all the noblesse of his order, and a profound contempt of
  fear in any shape. Death stared him in the face, but he was equal to it. Had
  there been hope, had it been a more doubtful matter&mdash;he might have been
  agitated. As it was, he was quite calm.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing to do with you, Neillson," he said quietly. "It is a hard
  thing, but I'm not afraid to die. Say your prayers, man, if you know
  any."</p>

  <p>A dull, lethargic composure seemed to creep over the two men. They stood
  knee-deep in the cruel green sea, which came curling about them, ever
  creeping upward, and they gazed with dull eyes over the blank sea. After a
  while Lord Clanavon roused himself as though with an effort.</p>

  <p>"When the sea comes to my neck, Neillson," he said, quietly, "I am going
  to swim. The village is round the western promontory, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Neillson, in a choking voice, "but you cannot pass the
  breakers."</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon looked at the long line of foam streaked, seething waves,
  and sighed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," he said. "But it is hard to die without making an effort.
  I shall try. Listen to me, Neillson. In a few hours we shall both be in
  another world. I do not blame you, mind, but you know that it is through you
  that we are in this position."</p>

  <p>"I know it," Neillson groaned.</p>

  <p>Lord Clanavon put his hand on his shoulder kindly.</p>

  <p>"I am not blaming you, Neillson. You fled here thoughtlessly, I know. I
  only mention this because I am going to ask you a favor."</p>

  <p>"You want me to tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I should die easier if I knew."</p>

  <p>"Come outside, Lord Bernard. It will take me some few minutes to tell you
  all, and if we climb that rock it will give us a little longer."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston, stronger by far than his companion, and a trained athlete,
  clambered easily to the summit of the slippery boulder. Then, stooping down,
  he dragged Neillson up to his side, and waited patiently while he recovered
  his breath.</p>

  <p>There they stood in the dreary twilight, with the tall cliffs frowning
  around them, and the sea-galls shrieking above their heads, while below the
  cruel, hungry sea was sweeping in, creeping higher and higher at every
  moment. Lord Alceston, finding his companion was shaking and trembling with
  the cold and agitation, passed his strong arm around him and held him up.
  Then he held his breath and stooped his head to hear from those white,
  trembling lips the story of his father's murder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-29"
     id="ch1-29">XXIX.&mdash;A DRAMA OF DEATH.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Let me give you one more chance, Lord Bernard," said
  Neillson, speaking rapidly, but in a low, tremulous tone. "Let me swear to
  you here, on the threshold of death, by every hope I have of another world,
  that it will be better for you if you let me carry my secret with me untold
  into the grave which awaits us. You will die a happier man&mdash;and so shall
  I."</p>

  <p>"You have passed your word, Neillson, and I claim it," was the firm,
  unhesitating answer. "Speak. I am waiting, and the time is short."</p>

  <p>He commenced at once. His voice was weak and broken with agitation, but in
  Lord Alceston's ears it drowned the wild, onward rush and backward motion of
  the angry waves and rang out above the screech of the dragged pebbles and the
  weird cries of the wheeling sea-gulls. He heard nothing but that faltering
  voice, pouring out an ill-told, disconnected story of which he fast gathered
  up the threads. It seemed in those few minutes, which he looked upon as his
  last on earth, almost as though his intelligence and perceptions were
  quickened and intensified&mdash;as though everything which he was told, every
  fact and incident, stood out in bolder colors, and his mind was gifted with
  added powers of reception and comprehension. And this is the story to which
  he listened:</p>

  <p>"I was engaged by Mr. Brudnell to be your father's confidential servant
  just before he started for a brief Continental tour. He was then only
  twenty-one years old, but he was an orphan, as your lordship knows, and his
  own master.</p>

  <p>"We travelled about for some time in a leisurely manner, staying longest
  in Paris and at a little village up among the Swiss mountains. Except for
  Paris, your father seemed to care very little for cities, and we spent most
  of our time in out-of-the-way places. Chance led us to a small watering-place
  on the French coast, within a short distance of Nice. My master liked the
  place, and we took up our quarters for some time at the hotel.</p>

  <p>"It was here, at the casino, that your father met the Count d'Augeville.
  The count was of good family, and had very pleasant manners. A slight
  acquaintance, begun in the most casual way, grew into intimacy. Alas! Alas!
  Alas!</p>

  <p>"Soon your father began to visit at the count's villa. It was a nice
  place, right away from the town, and finely situated close to the cliffs. The
  count was a widower, with two daughters. To sum him up at once, he was also a
  scoundrel and a gambler.</p>

  <p>"The daughters were twins, both beautiful and wonderfully alike. From the
  moment of his introduction to them a change seemed to come over my master.
  During all the time I had been with him I had scarcely seen him speak to a
  woman, except when he had been obliged. Now he seemed completely bewitched.
  He was always there, either riding or walking on the cliffs or driving into
  the town with one of them.</p>

  <p>"Cecile and Marie were their names. They were both in love with him, I am
  sure. Which he preferred I could not tell at that time; When he sent bouquets
  and presents he generally sent to both of them, and he was with one as often
  as the other. Of course there was a good deal of gossip about them in the
  town, but Miss Cecile's name was generally mentioned. Miss Marie had another
  admirer, to whom she was generally supposed to be engaged, and whom she
  afterward married.</p>

  <p>"While this was going on in the daytime my master was losing large sums of
  money&mdash;being cheated out of them, in fact, every night by Count
  d'Augeville. Once I remember he had to go to England to raise the money for a
  debt owing to him. Then I ventured to remonstrate with him, and very nearly
  got dismissed.</p>

  <p>"It was one night when we were at the Villa d'Augeville. The count and my
  master had been playing cards all the evening, and were sitting at a little
  round table close to the window, which was open. They had finished, when my
  master saw me strolling about the garden and called me in.</p>

  <p>"'Neillson,' he said, 'I wish you to listen to what I am going to say to
  the Count d'Augeville.'</p>

  <p>"The count looked up, startled. My master went on quite calmly.</p>

  <p>"'You hold me your debtor for to-night's play to the amount of twelve
  thousand francs, I believe?'</p>

  <p>"'That is the amount,' the count said.</p>

  <p>"'And you have won during the last month about one hundred and twenty
  thousand francs from me?'</p>

  <p>"The count frowned. 'I don't remember the amount,' he said, haughtily.
  'Gentlemen don't talk about such things afterward.'</p>

  <p>"The hundred and twenty thousand francs I have paid,' my master continued.
  'This twelve thousand I shall not pay.'</p>

  <p>"'And why the devil not?' cried the count, springing up.</p>

  <p>"' Because the odds are scarcely fair. In return for the lesson which you
  have just given me, Count d'Augeville, permit me to give you one. Gentlemen
  do not play poker with marked cards.'</p>

  <p>"As he spoke he snatched at the pack which was lying between them on the
  table and passed them to me.</p>

  <p>"'Examine those cards, Neillson,' he said, coolly. 'You observe where each
  one is marked at the right-hand corner?'</p>

  <p>"I saw it at once, and told him so. Then he passed them on to the two
  other gentlemen, who had advanced from the other end of the room. They both
  looked at them and shrugged their shoulders. The fact that they were marked
  cards was undeniable.</p>

  <p>"The count had been sitting quite still, pale and dazed. Even now he did
  not speak a word, and my master went on:</p>

  <p>"'Under these circumstances, Count d'Augeville, I shall not remain any
  longer under your roof. I have to inform you that your daughter Cecile was
  married to me last week at the Protestant church at Nice. I am sorry that I
  have not a copy of the certificate with me, but you will find the entry in
  the book if you care to go and look for it. I intend my wife to leave this
  house with me to-night.'</p>

  <p>"Suddenly we heard the sound of trailing draperies behind, and Mlle. Marie
  swept up to the little group, her face white with passion, and her great eyes
  gleaming like fire in the moonlight.'</p>

  <p>"It is false, <i>mon père!</i>" she cried, falling on her knees before
  him. 'He is base, perfidious, a traitor. Cecile is not married to him. If she
  leaves this house with him to-night she will go to her ruin. You will not let
  her go, father, wicked man that he is. He put those cards on the table
  himself. I saw him do it.'</p>

  <p>"His daughter's words seemed to give the count fresh courage. He sprang to
  his feet, shaking with anger.</p>

  <p>"'You are a liar, Alceston!' he cried, passionately. 'You shall give me
  satisfaction for this, and at once.'</p>

  <p>"My master stood up quietly.</p>

  <p>"'I shall not fight you, he said, 'because, in the first place, you are my
  wife's father; and in the next, you are a common thief, unworthy to cross
  swords with an English nobleman.'</p>

  <p>"How he did it I don't know, but somehow Count d'Augeville hurled a
  wine-glass which hit my master on the forehead. I saw the blood streaming
  down his forehead, but he scarcely seemed to notice it.</p>

  <p>"'You rascal!' screamed the count. 'I am noble, too, and you shall fight
  me!'</p>

  <p>"My master hesitated for a moment; then he touched his forehead
  lightly.</p>

  <p>"'After this,' he said, 'I rescind my words. I am at your service when and
  where you please.'</p>

  <p>"'Now; this moment!' cried the count. 'The moon is full, and it is as
  light as day. M. d'Armande will be your second. Victor, you will stand by me
  in this?' he said to the other man, whose name I have forgotten.</p>

  <p>"My master lifted the curtain and looked outside. It was, as the count had
  said, as light as day.</p>

  <p>"'As you will,' he said, carelessly. 'M. d'Armande, will you honor
  me?'</p>

  <p>"M. Victor and Count d'Augeville whispered together for a moment or two;
  then the latter came up to my master and M. d'Armande.</p>

  <p>"'Monsieur the Count,' he said, 'has no duelling pistols at hand, but
  several rapiers. Has Lord Alceston any objection to fight with these
  weapons?'</p>

  <p>"'Not the slightest,' my master answered. I saw a savage gleam of joy
  flash into Count d'Augeville's face. No doubt he thought that because my
  master was an Englishman he could not fence. But I knew better, and I was
  glad of the choice. I knew that my master was the most brilliant swordsman I
  had ever seen. One never knows what may happen with pistols; but with swords
  I felt quite sure that my master must win.</p>

  <p>"They opened the windows and trooped down the broad, white steps on to the
  lawn. My master was the last to go, and as he was quitting the room Mlle.
  Marie laid hold of his arm and whispered something imploringly in his ear. He
  shook her off and turned away without a word. I shall never forget her face.
  If a look could have slain him he would have been a dead man.</p>

  <p>"It was a strange scene on that little plot of grass&mdash;I don't think I
  ever saw a stranger one. The whole garden was heavy with the scent of flowers
  and creepers, mingled with the aromatic perfume from the plantation of pine
  trees which bordered the grounds and sloped downward to the sea. Everything
  was as light and clear as day, only there was the deep midnight stillness and
  the starlit sky. The figures on the lawn, with their drawn swords flashing
  coldly in the moonlight, seemed like a party of devils breaking into
  Paradise. The count's face was drawn and distorted with rage, and the other
  two seemed agitated too. Only my master stood there quite calm, with his
  shirt-sleeves rolled up, leaning upon his sword, and with an odd smile upon
  his lips. I went to him and asked if he had anything to say to me. He only
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"'If we fence till daylight,' he said, 'the count will never touch me. I
  never felt in better form.'</p>

  <p>"I have seen one or two duels, but I never saw another one like that. The
  count went at my master like a fury, but he never seemed to get anywhere near
  him. My lord stood his ground quite carelessly, smiling all the time, as
  though he were a fencing-master, indulging a pupil with a little loose play
  and parrying every thrust with ridiculous ease. The count tried him every
  way&mdash;in carte, in tierce, in cercle, in octave, in seconde, but it was
  all the same. My lord was always his superior, and if he had chosen he could
  have run the count through time after time with the simplest repass; but he
  never once attempted it.</p>

  <p>"They had been engaged nearly half an hour before the end came, and very
  unexpected it was to all of us. The count was fencing very loosely, and my
  lord, to vary it a little, drew back, and with a powerful flangonet sent the
  count's sword a dozen yards into the air. The count somehow lost his balance
  and fell forward. My lord being used to the most correct fencing, had brought
  his sword into line again immediately; he had concluded the flangonet, and
  the count fell right upon it before he could draw back.</p>

  <p>"We heard the sword enter his body, and almost at once it came out at his
  back dripping with blood. My lord drew it back and leaned over the count, who
  fell heavily backward without a single cry.</p>

  <p>"'He has only himself to blame for this,' my lord said, wiping his sword
  on the grass, and for the first time turning pale. 'I would have spared him
  if I could."</p>

  <p>"I never saw any one die so quickly. He just drew himself up once,
  clutched at the air with his fingers, and then fell back dead. But the most
  awful part was to come. While they were all gathered around him a tall, white
  figure glided down from the steps and across the grass toward them. Lord
  Bernard, death is close upon us, but even now the memory of that girl's face
  makes me shudder more than the thought of those hungry waves below. It was
  awful. She threw herself down on the grass by his side and wound her arms
  around him. But she knew directly that he was dead.</p>

  <p>"They all fell back and stood silent. My lord for the first time appeared
  to be agitated, and, dropping his sword, covered his face with his hands.
  Suddenly she turned round upon him, the moonlight flooding down upon her
  beautiful golden hair and ivory-marble face.</p>

  <p>"'You!' she cried. 'You! My God, was it you?'</p>

  <p>"He moved out of the shade of the cypress tree under which he had been
  standing and stretched out his arms imploringly to her. But she waved him
  away.</p>

  <p>"'Out of my sight!' she cried wildly. 'Away, away! Never come near me
  again. Never! Murderous coward, to kill an old man!'</p>

  <p>"'Cecile,' he cried, 'it was his own fault! Ask them if it was not. You
  are my wife, remember.'</p>

  <p>"She laughed; an awful laugh it was.</p>

  <p>"'May God's curse rest forever upon me,' she cried, 'if I smile into your
  face again, much more let you touch my fingers. Dare to come near me and I
  will kill you. Away! Out of my sight, monster! Wretch! If men will not punish
  you in this world may God do so in the next!' Then she fell on her knees
  again by her father's side, and my lord went away."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1-30"
     id="ch1-30">XXX.&mdash;AMONG THE WAVES.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Neillson's voice had been gradually growing fainter. Now it
  ceased altogether, and Lord Alceston began to fear that he would faint.</p>

  <p>"Neillson," he said quickly, "I must hear the rest. I know nothing yet
  about that night."</p>

  <p>"Give me a minute&mdash;only a minute," he begged.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston nodded, and waited in silence. Darkness was gradually
  blotting out the awful view, sinking upon the wild, angry sea, and half
  obscuring the giant cliffs. The water was all around them, and then a more
  than ordinary turbulent wave broke over the rock, drenching them with spray.
  The end could not be far off.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you the rest as quickly as I can," Neillson whispered
  hoarsely, glancing around with a shudder. "They advised my lord to fly, but
  he preferred to stand '\ his trial and was acquitted. A fair account of the
  fight was given, and general opinion was all in his favor. But Cecile
  d'Augeville, who was really his wife, shut herself up in a nunnery, and
  refused to see him. My lord returned to England, took up his commission in
  the army, and went to the war. On his return he had news, I do not know from
  where, of his wife's death. Then he married Margaret Montarid, your
  mother.</p>

  <p>"I can take one step from here to the night&mdash;of his murder. There was
  a great reception at Alceston House. The butler sent for me. A note had been
  left at the door marked immediate. Was it worth while sending it up to his
  lordship? I took it and glanced at it curiously enough. My God, what a shock
  it gave me! The handwriting was the handwriting of the dead, or of Cecile
  d'Augeville. When I had recovered a little I took it upstairs, and after a
  word or two of preparation I gave it to my lord. He bore it well, but it was
  an awful shock. He went almost at once to his study, and sent for me.</p>

  <p>"When I answered his bell he was leaning forward in his chair with his
  head buried in his hands. He looked up and the change in his face was awful;
  but I have no time to talk about that. Shall I go on, Lord Bernard?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, go on!" he cried desperately. "You are making death easier. My poor
  mother! God help her!"</p>

  <p>A great wave came dashing over them, and Neillson would have been swept
  away but that Lord Alceston passed his right arm around him and held him
  fast.</p>

  <p>"The note I saw," he panted out breathless from the shock of the water.
  "It is in my breast-pocket now. It will perish with me. It is signed Cecile
  d'Augeville Alceston. It said that this was her revenge for her father's
  murder, for so she termed his death. She had sent him a forged certificate of
  death, had let him marry again, had waited until his son&mdash;you&mdash;had
  grown up, and now her time had come. She had come to claim him as her lawful
  husband&mdash;to bring disgrace and social ruin upon him. Lord Bernard, he
  left his house that night and he went to her lodgings. You remember the case
  of foreign daggers in his cabinet. On the morrow she was found murdered, with
  one of these in her heart."</p>

  <p>"Neillson, is this true? My God!" moaned Bernard Alceston.</p>

  <p>"I feared that something might have happened," Neillson continued. "By
  daybreak I was on my way to her lodgings. The murder had just been
  discovered. I saw the body, and I knew the dagger in a moment. For a while I
  was bewildered how to act, but I did my best. I hurried back to Grosvenor
  Square. The house was all silent. I went to the library. Oh, it was awful,
  awful!" he cried wildly.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Neillson, go on!"</p>

  <p>"I rearranged the daggers. I left everything else in the room as it
  was&mdash;for others to discover. Then I went softly to her ladyship's room.
  I told her. She was brave, but oh! thank God that I am going to die, that the
  memory of her agony can haunt me no longer!</p>

  <p>"There was but one course for me to follow, and I did it. I alone knew
  that my master had left his house on that night when the reception was going
  on. The whole miserable story was plain to me, but to no one else. It must
  have been perjury or flight, and we chose the latter, because my flight would
  divert suspicion. You see now, Lord Bernard, why I was hiding here&mdash;why
  I feared to meet you!"</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston grasped his hand firmly.</p>

  <p>"You have been a faithful servant, Neillson," he said, in an unsteady
  tone. "Your reward will come! May God grant it you! Good-by!"</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Lord Bernard! Remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A huge green mass of water loomed for a moment in the darkness and then
  broke over their heads. Lord Alceston would have clung to his companion to
  the end, but Neillson's last act was a self-denying one. He cast himself
  loose from the strong arms which encircled him and flung himself down into
  the water, and his young master, having both hands free, fell down on his
  face, and clung to the slippery rock. The water dashed over him and receded.
  Another wave was close at hand, but the moment's respite was valuable. He
  stood up and tossed off his boots and as much of the remainder of his
  clothing as he could. Then, without waiting for the breaking wave, he plunged
  into the abyss of waters.</p>

  <p><br>
  There was a singing in his ears, a dull buzzing in his head, and a dull,
  dreamy sensation stealing over him, numbing his aching limbs and stopping all
  pain. He had battled with the waters in vain, and at last, half fainting with
  exhaustion, he had thrown up his arias and given in. The sea was his master.
  He had fought hard for life, and he could fight no longer. And this was
  death&mdash;this gradual dwindling away of all sensations; this hazy
  dreaminess which was stealing fast over him. It was not so very terrible,
  after all&mdash;not half so terrible as the struggle. He felt himself dashed
  against some rock, but there was no pain. Probably some bone was broken, but
  he did not feel it. He was too near death. Did every one die as easily as
  this? he wondered. No part of him seemed awake save his brain; and even that
  was dulled. Memory was busy. Scenes of his earliest boyhood came flashing
  before him one after another, but he found himself contemplating them with
  all the languid interest of an outsider. Was he in the world? Had he ever
  belonged to it? Gradually all consciousness of his own identity was fading
  away from him. He was quite contented&mdash;in a vague, impersonal sort of
  way. He had an idea that he was going to rest, and he was very tired. The
  sooner the better...Ah, a shock more violent than the others. It was coming
  now, then. Darkness&mdash;black darkness&mdash;a moment's sinking, and memory
  and sensation faded away without a struggle!</p>

     id="ch2-01">I.&mdash;MARIE DE FEURGET'S CONFIDENCES;<br>
  THE VILLA BY THE&gt;MEDITERRANEAN.</a></h2>

  <p>I am dull, hatefully, miserably, wretchedly dull. There's a confession to
  start with! Away from the convent, really in the outside world of which we
  girls used to talk so much, and&mdash;dull! Once I should have laughed at the
  very idea, and laughed more than ever at the idea of being driven to write
  down all my thoughts in this silly school-girl fashion. I wish I were back at
  the convent! I wish I were anywhere but here. And yet I dare not tell <i>mon
  père</i> so, for it would make him very unhappy&mdash;very angry, too, I
  expect. He would call me ingrate, undutiful, <i>mechant</i>. Ah! I know
  exactly what he would say. I suppose he is fond of me, too. He must be. He
  buys me pretty things and he is always bidding me amuse myself. But how can
  I, when I am always alone? He is so fond of solitude himself that I suppose
  he thinks it is best for every one else, too; but it is so dull. He takes me
  out&mdash;never. I have not a single girl friend&mdash;not one; and not even
  an acquaintance of the other sex. Annette tells me that they call him the
  misanthrope in the village. It is very disagreeable to have a father who is a
  misanthrope.</p>

  <p>I wonder whether he has really any great trouble. Sometimes I think that
  it must be so, and then I feel very sorry for him. I thought so when we came
  back from that awful visit to England! What a terrible time that was! Those
  poky little lodgings, that awful funeral we went to, and his strange manner
  all the time! It makes me shudder to think of it all. And why should we have
  changed our name while we were there, too? Ah! it was all very odd; but there
  was one thing about it which I shall never forget.</p>

  <p>Ah, well; you have one advantage, you great untidy note-book&mdash;though
  you're a queer sort of companion you won't tell tales, and I can confess to
  you what I wouldn't even whisper to any one in the world, not even to
  Annette; for though she is a very good girl she is a dreadful gossip. I would
  like, oh, so much, to see him just once more. I wonder if he has even thought
  of me at all? I don't suppose so. He is a great noble, <i>mon père</i> says,
  and we are&mdash;well, nobody very much. I wish that we were different, that
  everything was different.</p>

  <p>How I wish that we were of his order, and could go somewhere&mdash;to a
  great dance, or a reception, and meet him unexpectedly, and he would be so
  surprised, and&mdash;but this is awfully silly, I mustn't write any more
  nonsense like this, or I shall begin to be ashamed of myself and close you up
  forever, my silent confidant. Of course he has forgotten all about me by this
  time. Of course he has. And yet I wonder whether he has quite? He must see so
  many girls ever so much nicer than I am, and they must all like him. Ah me,
  how dull I am; and what a dreary world this is! I wish that I could think of
  something fresh to do, or that something would happen; I wouldn't mind much
  what. Of course it won't, though. I think I'll go to bed, and get up and see
  the sun rise. Good-night, you stupid old book!</p>

  <p><br>
  Last night I was praying for a change of any sort. Well, it has come; and,
  slight though it is, I am glad of it. Sometimes <i>mon père!</i> seems to
  weary of his dull, learned books and his long, lonely walks and visits to his
  sick pensioners, and then he goes off down into the little town, and into the
  casino reading-room, never stopping there very long and seldom noticing or
  speaking to any of the strangers there. This week he has been twice&mdash;a
  very rare occurrence; and this afternoon, on his return, he called me to him
  and told me briefly that he had invited guests to dinner and that he should
  expect me to receive them. There were no ladies, he said, only gentlemen; but
  of course I knew this, for he could scarcely have asked ladies to dine here,
  even had he known any, without their having called on me first. He was going
  away to his study without telling me any more, but I coaxed him into having
  tea with me on the balcony, and then he told me all about it.</p>

  <p>"You are a very curious young person, Marie," he said, "but I suppose you
  won't rest till I've told you all about it. When I was at the casino on
  Monday there was a very nice English boy there with his tutor. I don't know
  why, but I took rather a fancy to him, and as we were at the same table we
  talked together for some time. Of course he told me all about
  himself&mdash;an Englishman always does that. It seems that his name is
  Carlyon, and he is supposed to be reading for an examination with a tutor,
  who is travelling with him. The tutor is a stupid, careless sort of fellow,
  who has never been out of England before, and is about the last person in the
  world to have the charge of a high-spirited lad like Carlyon, who seems just
  one of those boys who are born to get into mischief. I remember thinking,
  something of the sort when I left them on Monday, and to-day I find that I
  was right. There is a fellow named D'Aubron always hanging about the
  casino&mdash;a very pleasant, gentlemanly fellow on the surface, but in
  reality an adventurer, a card-sharper&mdash;in short, a blackguard. It seems
  that he has managed to ingratiate himself somehow with both Carlyon and his
  tutor, and unless some one manages to put a stop to it the result is very
  obvious. I heard D'Aubron ask young Carlyon to dine with him this evening,
  and while he was hesitating I asked them all to dine with me instead. It was
  the only thing I could think of at the moment. Carlyon accepted at once, and
  so, I am sorry to say, did D'Aubron. That is the history of our
  dinner-party."</p>

  <p>"But how about the dinner?" I asked, for though our cook was a good one, I
  doubted whether she would be prepared at so short a notice.</p>

  <p>"I have seen to that," he said, rising. "I am going into the library now.
  Do not forget that dinner is at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>I was a little late, because Annette would insist upon so many finishing
  touches, and when I reached the drawing-room I found that they had arrived
  and were waiting for me to go into dinner. I was rather shy when I opened the
  door, but <i>mon père</i> came to me at once and gave me his arm. Then he
  took me up and introduced me to our guests. I was introduced to each
  separately, first to Mr. Carlyon. He bowed awkwardly and blushed like a
  school-girl, but I liked him better than any of the rest. He was quite tall,
  and had such a bright, open face with blue eyes and brown curly hair. He was
  just what I had expected, only nicer. Then there was M. d'Aubron. He was a
  tall, sallow young man, with black mustache and eyes, and rather prominent
  teeth. I didn't like him at all. He looked at me coldly, and yet familiarly,
  and bowed so low that I thought he must be going to kiss my fingers or do
  something absurd. And he made such a ridiculous little speech, too, about the
  unexpected pleasure, and all that sort of nonsense. I took care to pretend
  not to hear it, and I turned my back upon him as soon as I could. Mr. Brown,
  Mr. Canyon's tutor, was the last of the three to whom I was introduced. He
  was rather a young-looking man with red hair and whiskers, large spectacles
  and a very feeble expression. He didn't look at all the man likely to have
  any authority over any one&mdash;least of all over a high-spirited boy like
  Arthur Carlyon.</p>

  <p>Very soon after my arrival a strange man-servant&mdash;we only kept three
  maids at the villa, so he must have been engaged specially&mdash;announced
  that dinner was served. <i>Mon père</i> asked Mr. Carlyon to take me in, and
  the poor boy did blush so when he gave me his arm. I was glad it was he,
  though, for I felt that I should like him. When we reached the
  dining-room&mdash;a room which we scarcely ever used&mdash;I had quite a
  surprise. There was some new furniture, and the table was beautifully
  decorated with silver and glass and choice flowers. The conservatory, which
  had been empty ever since we had been at the villa, was filled with palms and
  exotics. Then there were two men-servants to wait at table, and from the many
  dainty courses I knew that there must be a strange cook downstairs. I tried
  to look quite dignified, as though I were quite used to it all, but I'm
  afraid I wasn't very successful.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of conversation during dinner-time. Mr. Carlyon soon
  found his tongue, and amused me very much. My father and Mr. Brown started a
  literary conversation. M. d'Aubron alone remained almost silent, and paid
  attention to his dinner. Several times my father reluctantly broke off his
  conversation with Mr. Brown and spoke courteously to him, but the result was
  always the same. M. d'Aubron was evidently sulking. At last, man pyre left
  him alone, and I was glad of it. How I did dislike that man! I positively
  hated him. I knew that he was a bad man.</p>

  <p>Now and then I found myself watching my father, partly in wonder, partly
  in admiration. It was hard to believe that this was the same man whose morose
  moods and gloomy, troubled looks had been such a dead weight upon my
  happiness. He was an admirable host. It did me good to look at him.</p>

  <p>As soon as it seemed to me that the proper time had come I rose and left
  them to their wine. Mr. Carlyon, being nearest, opened the door for me, and
  in his hurry managed to tread upon my skirts and tear them badly. Then I went
  into the drawing-room, and Annette came and did the best she could with some
  pins, for I did not feel like changing my dress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-02"
     id="ch2-02">II.&mdash;A MONOTONY BROKEN.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I don't think I ever felt more restless than I did that
  evening. I couldn't work, I couldn't read, I couldn't even play. At last I
  opened the French window and went out on the balcony.</p>

  <p>It was a lovely night, such a night as only we dwellers in southern lands
  are permitted to enjoy. Through the dark boughs of the silent trees I could
  catch faint flashes of the sea, glistening like a silver lake in the light of
  the yellow moon, and away in front of me the black hills stretched their dim,
  cloud-betopped heads toward the sky.</p>

  <p>The sound of some one entering the drawing-room behind disturbed me, and I
  looked in through the half-open window. Mr. Canyon was there, standing just
  inside the doorway with his hands in his trousers pockets, and glancing
  around with a very disconsolate expression. Evidently he had come to look for
  me, and was disappointed&mdash;very disappointed he appeared&mdash;to find
  the room empty. He was in the act of quitting the room when I entered it, and
  I had to call him back. He turned round and came toward me at once, with a
  pleased smile on his handsome, boyish face.</p>

  <p>"Hope I'm not disturbing you, Mlle. de Feurget," he said, apologetically.
  "You see, your father and old Brown&mdash;my tutor, you know&mdash;are deep
  in a discussion on Rousseau, and D'Aubron is as sulky as a bear about
  something or other, and, you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I stopped him, laughing.</p>

  <p>"You needn't make so many excuses for coming in to talk to me," I said.
  "It isn't complimentary. I'm very glad to have you, I'm sure. You're not
  interested in Rousseau, then?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," he answered, coming and standing by my side at the window. "Seems
  to me that he was such a sentimental sort of a chap. Jolly night, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Very," I answered. "I was out on the balcony enjoying it when you came
  in. How long have you been in St. Marien, Mr. Canyon?" I continued.</p>

  <p>"About ten days; that is all. I don't know that we should have stopped so
  long only Brown's rather sweet on the place."</p>

  <p>"And do you like it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as much as most of these poky little Continental towns," he
  admitted, grudgingly. "I don't like any place so well as England, though.
  It's a great deal too hot here for me. Don't you find it so?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so," I answered. "But then, of course, I never attempt
  to go out in the middle of the day, and perhaps I am more used to it, too.
  You see, I have lived in France all my life."</p>

  <p>"How well you speak English!" he said, admiringly. "Your people are all
  French, then, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>My people! What grim irony it sounded! If only he could have known what a
  heartache his simple words gave me! I leaned back in my chair, and for a few
  moments I forgot his very existence. Was there not a cruel loneliness in the
  very thought that my memory was powerless to recall even my mother's face?
  Through all those long, weary years of childhood or girlhood, and now of
  womanhood, there had been no one to care for me, no one nearer than stern old
  Mme. Duponte, my head governess at the convent. And even now were things much
  better? I had a father, 'tis true, but a father who had only a cold,
  distracted sort of affection to offer me, whose strange manner of life was a
  constant mystery, and who met every question of mine as to our relatives, our
  past and my mother with stern silence or agitated admonitions. Perhaps the
  tears glistened in my eyes for a moment at Mr. Canyon's innocent question. At
  any rate, something in my manner must have told him that his words had
  touched a painful chord, and he looked up at me appealingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry," he said, humbly. "I always was a clumsy sort of fellow.
  You're not angry with me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," I answered, lightly. "You have said nothing clumsy,
  either. And now we'll have some tea, shall we? Do you mind ringing the
  bell?"</p>

  <p>He sprang up with unnecessary haste and rang it with quite unnecessary
  vigor. I ordered some tea from the alarmed servant, who came hurrying in.
  After that conversation languished for a few minutes, and as Mr. Carlyon
  still appeared distressed, I was obliged to try and explain to him a
  little.</p>

  <p>"It was very silly of me just now," I said, "but I feel very lonely
  sometimes, and your words seemed to remind me of it. I have no one but my
  father, you know."</p>

  <p>"But you have some friends, of course?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"None?"</p>

  <p>He looked quite distressed, and bewildered, too.</p>

  <p>"But, Mlle. de Feurget!" he exclaimed, "it must be perfectly dreadful for
  you! Do you mean to say that you don't visit anywhere, and that no one comes
  to see you? Doesn't your father know any of the people here?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose he knows them," I answered, sighing. "In fact, I know that he
  does; but he is quite a recluse. He will not go into any society at all!"</p>

  <p>"That must be very bad for you," he said, feelingly. "It was awfully good
  of him to ask us here, if that is the case. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and the sound of some one entering. Mr.
  Carlyon and I both looked round, and he forgot to finish his sentence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-03"
     id="ch2-03">III.&mdash;M. D'AUBRON IS DISAPPOINTED.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was M. d'Aubron who had entered. He was attired for
  leaving, and carried his hat in his hand. Somehow I don't think that he was
  too well pleased to find Mr. Carlyon with me.</p>

  <p>"Are you leaving already, M. d'Aubron?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, yes," he answered, bowing. "I have some friends coming to
  my rooms this evening, and I must be there to entertain them. I'm sorry to
  hurry you, Canyon, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not coming yet," he interrupted, "not, at least, if Mlle. de
  Feurget will allow me to stay a little longer," he added, turning to me. I
  assured him at once that I should be very pleased to have him.</p>

  <p>M. d'Aubron bit his lip and looked annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Against mademoiselle I can of course say nothing," he remarked. "But you
  must allow me to remind you, Canyon, that your engagement to me for this
  evening was a prior one."</p>

  <p>"I haven't forgotten it. I'll look in on our way home," Mr. Canyon
  promised.</p>

  <p>M. d'Aubron's face cleared a little.</p>

  <p>"Very good. I shall expect to have the pleasure then. Mlle. de Feurget,
  permit me to wish you good-evening. I am consoled for the loss of Mr.
  Canyon's society by the reflection that I leave him in your hands."</p>

  <p>I wished him good-evening, coldly, and he went.</p>

  <p>"It's very nice of you to let me stop," Mr. Carlyon remarked, sipping the
  tea I had handed to him.</p>

  <p>"I think it's very nice of you to want to stop," I answered; "besides, I'd
  a great deal rather you were here than with M. d'Aubron."</p>

  <p>"Would you, really?" he exclaimed. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't like him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he isn't a bad sort," Mr. Carlyon said, meditatively. "I'm not sure
  that I care much for him myself, though," he added.</p>

  <p>"I should think that he was a very bad companion for you," I remarked. "He
  plays cards, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Every one does here," Mr. Canyon answered. "It's about the only thing to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Do you play much?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not I," he declared. "I've played a few times with D'Aubron and some of
  his friends, but it's a little too expensive for me."</p>

  <p>"I should think so. M. d'Aubron generally wins, doesn't he?" I asked
  dryly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Canyon looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes. How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," I said, shrugging my shoulders. "He seems to me to be
  the sort of man who would win at cards. To tell you the truth, Mr. Carlyon,"
  I continued, hesitatingly, "I have heard my father speak not altogether
  favorably of M. d'Aubron. I hope that you are not very friendly with
  him?"</p>

  <p>His face clouded over a little, and he looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not very friendly with him," he said; "I only met him at the
  casino, you know. Still, I think he's a gentleman. He's been rather kind to
  me."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door, and a servant entered the room bearing a
  note.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman for monsieur," he said, delivering it to Mr. Carlyon.</p>

  <p>"For me!" Mr. Carlyon repeated, evidently a good deal surprised. "Who on
  earth can want to see me at this time of night? And we never left word where
  we were going, either. Sure there's no mistake?"</p>

  <p>"I think not, sir," the man replied. "The note is addressed to the
  Honorable Arthur Carlyon, and the gentleman who gave it me desired that it
  should be handed into monsieur's own hands. He waits below."</p>

  <p>Mr. Carlyon tore it open and glanced through the few words which it
  contained. At first he uttered a quick exclamation of surprise; then a deep
  red flush stole into his face and he crushed the note up indignantly.</p>

  <p>"All right! You can tell the gentleman I'll be down in a moment," he said
  to the servant. "I'm so sorry to go," he added, turning to me, "but I'm
  afraid I must. A cousin of mine has turned up unexpectedly and wants to see
  me. I thought at first that it was only a reminder from D'Aubron, but it
  isn't."</p>

  <p>"You must go, of course, then:" I said, holding out my hand.
  "Good-evening."</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Mlle. de Feurget, and thank you so much for the pleasantest
  evening I've had since I left England. I wonder if you would allow&mdash;but
  perhaps you don't care to receive callers?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>I hesitated. It was so ungracious to refuse him, and my life was very
  dull. Why should he not come sometimes? It would be better for him, at any
  rate, than being with M. d'Aubron. There was no society to be scandalized,
  for, alas, I had none. Why should I not follow my own will for once? My
  father would not object, I felt sure. "I think that you might
  call&mdash;once, at any rate," I said, smiling.</p>

  <p>He clasped my hand in his long brown fingers, and I bore it without
  flinching, although it hurt horribly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mlle. de Feurget. Thank you and good-by."</p>

  <p>He took himself off at last, and my eyes followed him with something like
  regret. I was very glad that he had come, very glad that I knew him. It
  seemed to me somehow that I was less friendless than I had been an hour ago,
  and I felt better in another way too. The absolute solitude of my life and
  the entire lack of companionship had not been without its effect upon me. I
  had felt myself daily growing more and more callous before the cold
  abstraction of my unhappy father. It was the slow adaptation of my nature to
  his, and it had begun to make itself felt. I had been hungering for a word of
  sympathy from some one, and the eager, respectful homage of that bright-faced
  English boy did me a world of good. I felt after he had gone that I could
  cry, and a woman who can shed tears is never in her worst state.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-04"
     id="ch2-04">IV.&mdash;AN INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After Mr. Carlyon had left me I gathered up my work and
  prepared to go to my room. Perhaps if I had done so things might have turned
  out very differently. Who can tell? But fate in the shape of a soft, sweet
  breath of night wind, which stole in through the still open window, drew me
  out on to the balcony instead; and when I saw the golden moon which had risen
  from behind the tops of the fir trees, and felt the soft, luxurious caress of
  the odorous night breeze upon my hot temples, I lingered. And leaning back
  against the wall, hidden in the shadow of the gable alone, I let my eyes
  wander dreamily over the shadowy landscape and up at the midnight sky.</p>

  <p>The woman never lived who did not sometimes indulge in an idle dream, and
  for awhile my thoughts played havoc with reality. They were recalled suddenly
  by the sound of voices in the garden below. I glanced downward, and on the
  border of the path in front of the villa I saw two men standing talking.</p>

  <p>One I knew at once, for the moonlight shone full upon his uncovered head.
  It was Mr. Carlyon. But his companion stood somewhat in the shadow of a thick
  shrub, and except that he was tall and wore a long ulster and cap, I could
  see nothing of him. They had moved to within easy hearing of where I was, but
  I could not escape into the room without being seen from below, and as I
  naturally did not desire this I stayed where I was, listening, at first
  against my wish, it is true. But afterward I had not that excuse.</p>

  <p>"I never was so surprised in my life to see any one, old chap," I heard
  Arthur Carlyon say, his loud boyish tones a little hushed, but still
  perfectly audible to me. "The last time I heard from home the mater said that
  the latest report about you was that you were&mdash;well, in a queer state.
  You were nearly drowned, weren't you? Tell us all about it."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, broken by the low, clear tones of the other
  man. It was strange, incredible, preposterous! And yet, at his first words, I
  held my breath and felt my heart beat fast. Something in the <i>timbre</i> of
  his voice seemed to fall upon my ears with a curious sense of familiarity,
  and I leaned forward eagerly, straining my eyes through the darkness. But it
  was of no avail. I could distinguish nothing save the dim outline of the
  speaker, and that recalled nothing to me. It told me nothing, save that he
  was tall. Surely it was impossible&mdash;more than impossible, absurd! But
  though it seemed so, my heart still beat fast, and with my fingers locked
  locked nervously in the branches of the stephanotis which hung around the
  window, I leaned eagerly forward as far as I could. Afterward it seemed to me
  that I was very foolish. Even supposing that it were he, what concern was it
  of mine? Was it not a matter for reproach that even the bare possibility
  should have so agitated me? What was he to me, or I to him then?</p>

  <p>"There is not much to tell," I heard the newcomer say slowly. "I was down
  at Clanavon Castle, that queer old place on the Northumbrian coast that my
  father was so fond of, looking through some papers which he had left there,
  and I took it into my head to explore some secret passages with the son of
  the timekeeper, who I thought would know all about them. Unfortunately he
  didn't, as the event proved."</p>

  <p>"You were nearly drowned, weren't you?" Arthur Carlyon interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we were. You see, we got landed in a very small cave just as the
  tide was coming in, and we were completely trapped. The passage by which we
  had come was submerged before we thought of turning back, and so our only
  retreat was cut off, and the tide was coming in fast."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you get away by the cliffs?"</p>

  <p>"They were impossible. We couldn't even clamber a few feet up them. We
  could do nothing but wait till the last thing and then swim. There was
  scarcely a breath in my body when I was thrown upon the beach. I had lost
  consciousness and given up swimming long before. The man who was with me was
  picked up by an incoming fishing boat."</p>

  <p>"And was he alive?"</p>

  <p>"Just. He had a very close shave of it, but he's getting better now. I was
  almost given up myself at one time, but I just managed to pull through, and
  directly I was strong enough to travel the doctor ordered me to the South of
  France."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth made you come to this out-of-the-way hole? Did you know
  that we were here?"</p>

  <p>"Not until last week. I was at Nice then, and I had a letter from your
  mother, telling me that you were here with your tutor. I had other reasons
  for wanting to see this place, so I came over and have put up at the Leon
  d'Or for a few days."</p>

  <p>"Our hotel! How jolly! I say, Bernard, you'll forgive my asking, won't
  you?" Arthur Carlyon continued curiously, "but has anything been discovered
  yet&mdash;your father, you know. Have they found Neillson?"</p>

  <p>The answer was so low that I could not catch it. But I gathered from the
  indignant nature of Mr. Carlyon's observations that it was not a satisfactory
  one.</p>

  <p>"The blockheads! Stupid louts! It must make you feel wild, Bernard! Why, I
  believe it would send me mad if I were you, and there was a chance of the
  fellow being discovered."</p>

  <p>"There is very little chance that he will be now," was the quiet
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I'm beastly sorry, old chap! Perhaps I oughtn't to talk to you about it.
  You don't look strong enough to stand much. But I couldn't help saying
  that."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Arthur. We won't talk about it any more, if you don't mind.
  Besides, there's something else I want to say to you."</p>

  <p>He dropped his voice a little, and I could not hear what he said. But
  apparently it was something which displeased Arthur Carlyon.</p>

  <p>"It's all nonsense, you know, Bernard," I heard him say, testily. "You
  seem to think that Brown and I are a pair of babies, and that's going a
  little too far, you know. We can take care of ourselves, I can assure you.
  Besides, you don't know what you're talking about, in the present case, at
  least. Our host there is a gentleman and a scholar, and I consider our
  invitation here a great compliment. I heard them talking about him in the
  casino this morning. He spends all his time in his library or among the poor
  people, they say. You're all wrong, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, and I felt my cheeks grow hot, notwithstanding
  the cool, sweet breeze which swept softly over my face and rustled among the
  creepers and the shrubs. Then I heard the answering voice.</p>

  <p>"Arthur, listen to me! I'm an older man than you; and I know more of the
  world. At any rate, I know more what I'm talking about in the present
  instance. These Continental watering places, especially the smaller ones,
  such as St. Marien, are simply hot-beds of gambling, the refuge and haunt of
  the lowest class of swindlers who have probably made the more fashionable
  resorts too hot for them. Of your host I know nothing&mdash;not even his
  name. The house was rented out to me, and that is all. I say nothing against
  him&mdash;he may be as you say, a gentleman. No doubt he is, but that man,
  d'Aubron, whom I am told that you are intimate with, is nothing more nor lets
  than a dangerous adventurer, a man who lives by lib wits and by his skill at
  cards upon such boys as you. General Erle saw you with him this morning, and
  as In had not bad an opportunity to warn you himself, he told me about it
  immediately I arrived. If Mr. Brows has suffered you to associate with him,
  and has gone with you to his rooms, I shall write and advise your father to
  change your tutor at once."</p>

  <p>"You can do as you choose," Arthur Carlyon answered hotly. "I don't care.
  Old Erle always was a meddlesome idiot, and I don't believe he knows what
  he's talking about."</p>

  <p>"General Erle is not an idiot, and men in his position, and with his
  regard for the truth, are not in the habit of making reckless assertions,"
  was the stern reply. "Besides, he's a friend of your father's."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not with D'Aubron now, at any rate, am I?" protested Arthur
  Carlyon. "He went away an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he has been here, then?" remarked the other.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he dined here."</p>

  <p>"And your host is a resident here. As such, Arthur, he must have known the
  fellow's character. Look here, will you send in your excuses and come round
  to my hotel and talk it over there?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. You talk to me as though I were a child."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be here talking to you at all, Arthur, if I hadn't promised
  your mother that I would look after you. I have plenty of troubles of my own
  to occupy me, God knows."</p>

  <p>Arthur Carlyon's tone changed at once.</p>

  <p>"I know you have, old chap," he said, "and of course it's very good of you
  to bother about me at all. But don't you think that you're a little bit
  unreasonable in the present case? I do really. I can't help it."</p>

  <p>"You won't come with me, then?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. I am M. de Feurget's guest for the evening."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you will take me in and introduce me. I shall&mdash;Good
  God!"</p>

  <p>Arthur Carlyon's mysterious companion had changed his position suddenly,
  and the last exclamation had burst from trembling lips, and in a tone which
  had suddenly become hoarse with agitation. His cousin looked at him in
  amazement, and then, following his horror-struck riveted gaze, turned round.
  I, too, seeing a shadow cast between the two upon the grass, leaned over the
  balcony, and saw my father with his head uncovered standing in the lower
  window, with a cigarette between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce my host, Monsieur de Feurget, to you, Bernard," said
  Arthur Canyon, with a sudden access of dignity into his boyish manner.
  "Monsieur de Feurget, this is my cousin, the Earl of Alceston."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-05"
     id="ch2-05">V.&mdash;MR. CARLYON'S COUSIN.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Never, though my memory should yield up everything else
  which a stormy life has left imprinted upon it, shall I forget that scene. My
  father, although his manner when he did come in contact with the new
  acquaintances was always quietly courteous, stood perfectly still without
  moving even a feature, and with his cigarette still between his teeth. He did
  not appear to have heard the words of introduction. There was not the
  slightest smile of welcome upon his lips. His hands, instead of being
  outstretched, hung nervelessly by his side, and he did not advance a single
  step forward. The only change in his appearance was a curious glitter in his
  dark eyes and a slight compression of his thin, colorless lips.</p>

  <p>A few feet away from him, Lord Alceston stood. I could see him plainly
  now, but had I not heard his voice and his name, I might with reason have
  doubted whether it were indeed he. The face was paler by far than when I had
  seen him last, and his form, though still erect and graceful, was shrunken
  and thin. His cheeks, too, were hollow, and his face seemed sharpened. He was
  standing now with his lips a little parted, and one hand raised to his head;
  and God forbid that I should ever again see such a look of horror on human
  face as was distorting his features as his eyes rested upon my father. It
  came and went like a flash. But I saw it, and it seemed to me that they must
  see it too. Between them Arthur Carlyon stood glancing from one to the other
  in blank bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Have either of you seen a ghost&mdash;or both&mdash;or what?" he asked,
  breaking a silence which, had it lasted much longer, I myself must have
  broken with a shriek. "Bernard, old chap, don't you feel well?"</p>

  <p>It was all over. Lord Alceston seemed galvanized out of his stupor and was
  once more the well-bred <i>dilettante</i> man of the world. My father, too,
  had regained his naturally easy manners, and the usual courtesies passed
  between the two men. But I noticed that when my father's hand touched Lord
  Alceston's it seemed to send a shiver through his frame, and he dropped it as
  speedily as possible. There were a few words of invitation, a brief
  acceptance, and the three men stepped into the room from which my father had
  come.</p>

  <p>What could have passed between them to cause the momentary agitation which
  both had betrayed? The more I wondered, the more inexplicable the whole thing
  seemed. I sat in my rocking-chair thinking, until my whole brain whirled and
  my reasoning powers were reduced to utter confusion. Then at last, moved by a
  sudden impulse, I started up, and wrapping a long dark cloak around me, I
  stole softly from the room, downstairs, and out of the open door into the
  garden.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-06"

  <p class="first">Situated as our cottage was, at a considerable distance from
  any thoroughfare, our blinds were always left 'indrawn, and our windows wide
  open in order to enjoy as much as possible the faint but fragrant night
  breeze. And so from the edge of the shrubbery fringing the lawn, where I had
  taken up my station, I could see with ease into the room where my father and
  his guests were.</p>

  <p>At the further end Mr. Brown and my father were examining together a
  little pile of musty volumes, which I recognized as part of my father's
  choicest stock of rare books and first editions. Both seemed entirely
  engrossed in their occupation, and ray father was evidently holding forth
  concerning his favorites to Mr. Brown with considerable warmth. It is strange
  how his appearance changes at times. Then, with his lips parted in a slight
  smile, and a bright, keen light in his eyes, he seemed transformed. Although
  his face was aged and his brow furrowed, their disfigurement appeared more
  like the becoming traces of a studious life than the indelible marks of a
  deep sorrow and an ever-torturing anxiety. His upright mien, too, gave him a
  greater air of dignity than was usual. It was evident that in the keen
  enjoyment of conversation with a sympathizer in his literary tastes he had
  forgotten for a while that other portion of his life which at times laid hold
  of him so powerfully, and which seemed to oppress him like a nightmare. I
  could not keep back a sigh of regret as I looked at him. If only he would be
  always like this! If only that other self, so mysterious, so depressing,
  would fall away! Life would be a very different thing for me if only this
  could come to pass.</p>

  <p>A little way apart from my father and Mr. Brown and nearer the window, Mr.
  Carlyon and Lord Alceston were talking together in a low tone. I could not
  overhear what they were saying, nor did I try to do so. But it seemed to me
  that their conversation was no very important one, and I noticed that every
  now and then Lord Alceston cast a furtive yet impatient glance toward my
  father, as though anxious to speak with him.</p>

  <p>Presently a servant brought in a tray with some tea and other
  refreshments, and in the slight stir which followed, the relative positions
  of the occupants of the room were changed.</p>

  <p>While every one's attention was thus momentarily absorbed I saw Lord
  Alceston cross the room and whisper something in my father's ear. My father
  started, and I saw a strange look flash into his eyes and across his face. He
  hesitated only for a minute, however, then rising to his feet he followed
  Lord Alceston to the window. They stood talking there for a minute or two in
  a low tone, during which my father was chiefly the listener, and presently
  they moved forward together as though by common consent into the garden, only
  just giving me time to get behind a shrub before they were close upon me.</p>

  <p>"Now, my lord, we are secure from listeners," my father said in a low,
  suppressed tone, "perhaps you can explain yourself here."</p>

  <p>"As well here as anywhere," Lord Alceston answered. "I have very little
  explanation to give, though. I simply want to ask you a question."</p>

  <p>"If it is one which I can answer I shall be glad to do so," my father
  declared quietly.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about you being able to, Monsieur de Feurget," Lord
  Alceston said earnestly, "and a great deal to me depends upon your answer. It
  has reference partly to something which happened a very long time ago."</p>

  <p>My father bowed his head without remark, and Lord Alceston proceeded.</p>

  <p>"It is a strange thing, Monsieur de Feurget, that you and I should meet
  here. If what I am told is true, there was a tragedy played out upon that
  lawn, more than twenty years ago, in which my father was one who figured most
  unhappily, and there was a Monsieur de Feurget there too! Are you he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! It was I."</p>

  <p>My father's voice was calm and expressionless, yet I, who was watching him
  closely, could see in the clear moonlight the gray pallor creep into his face
  and the old look of trouble into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You were the Count d'Augerville's second, then?"</p>

  <p>"I was. Not because I had any faith or sympathy in the justice of his
  cause, but because there was none else at hand; and besides, he had claims
  upon me."</p>

  <p>"You were a friend of the household, Monsieur de Feurget? You knew his
  daughters?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. I was engaged to marry one of them."</p>

  <p>"And you did marry her?"</p>

  <p>"I did!"</p>

  <p>"It was Marie, was it not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The other, Cecile, was married to your father."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston paused for a minute, but I knew that the conversation was
  not yet at an end&mdash;that it had not yet, indeed, reached its climax. It
  seemed to me that he was nerving-himself to ask a question, the answer to
  which he dreaded. At last it came, and I knew that I was right. For his voice
  had lost the quiet, easy ring, and the words came hastily, almost
  indistinctly, from tremulous lips.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Feurget, can you tell me this? When did
  she&mdash;Cecile&mdash;my father's wife, die?"</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that my father shrank from answering, almost as much as
  Lord Alceston had from asking this question. A ghastly shade passed over his
  face, and he turned his head away.</p>

  <p>"Lord Alceston, you had better not ask that question&mdash;of me. It will
  be better for you not to know," he said slowly. "It will, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Feurget, I must know," was the grave answer. "It is
  necessary. Let me put it to you in this way. On that awful night when my
  father was murdered, there was a brutal crime committed in the East End. A
  woman, an unknown woman, was murdered in a most mysterious manner by a man
  whom it was proved had deliberately sought her out with that intention. You
  remember this?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," my father answered. "I have reason to."</p>

  <p>"Just so. You have reason to," Lord Alceston repeated. "You yourself, for
  some cause or another, were interested in this affair. At the inquest, you
  presented yourself and attempted to identify the dead woman. In this you were
  so far successful that on the ground of having met her once abroad, or some
  other equally insufficient pretext, you were allowed to undertake the expense
  of her funeral, and not only did you attend it yourself, but you did so in
  company with your daughter, Mademoiselle de Feurget."</p>

  <p>My father's manner was changing rapidly. The unnatural calm had gone, and
  he looked anxious&mdash;even fearful. The tone of his answer, too, was sharp
  and suspicious.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" he asked quickly. "My name did not appear in the
  paper."</p>

  <p>"No; because you gave a false one," Lord Alceston answered. "But I know
  you may have had very good reasons for doing so! I am not your judge with
  regard to them. Only I know. And now, Monsieur de Feurget," he continued,
  laying his hand upon my father's shoulder, "tell me this, and for God's sake
  tell me quickly! Who was that woman?"</p>

  <p>There was a short silence&mdash;short, but so intense that, while I
  crouched there with my eyes fixed upon the two men, I could hear the quick,
  hurried beating of my heart. At last, to my unutterable relief, my father
  broke the deep silence. Had it lasted but a few moments longer, I must have
  shrieked, for the tension upon my already overwrought nerves was nearly too
  much for me.</p>

  <p>"You ask that question, Lord Alceston," he said, "with great
  confidence&mdash;almost as though you had some right to ask it. Yet, for your
  own sake, I would advise you not to press for an answer."</p>

  <p>"An answer I will have," Lord Alceston said, his voice trembling with
  emotion. "I am told, Monsieur de Feurget, that that woman was Cecile
  d'Augerville, my father's wife. Was this so? You knew her, and you saw the
  dead body. Was this so?"</p>

  <p>"It was."</p>

  <p>There was a brief but awful silence. Lord Alceston stood with his face
  covered in his hands for a full minute. I would have given, oh, I would have'
  given the world to have been able to go to him and try to comfort him. But I
  dared not, though the tears were in my eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not identify her?" Lord Alceston asked presently.</p>

  <p>My father shrugged his shoulders gravely.</p>

  <p>"Who would have been the gainer? I knew that your father had been
  deceived, and that he had married again. To have published the identity of
  the murdered woman would have been to bring disgrace upon you and profited no
  one. So I kept the secret."</p>

  <p>"And, Monsieur de Feurget, how was it that you had any idea at all that
  the murdered woman in an East End lodging-house was your sister-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. Just before my wife died she discovered that her sister
  was still living, and she made me promise to do my best to prevent her from
  declaring herself, and not to let her come to England if I could help it. I
  discovered that she had left for London and followed her. I had almost traced
  her out when I read of this murder in the vicinity where I knew she was. An
  impulse prompted me to go and look at the body. It was a terrible shock to me
  when I recognized her."</p>

  <p>There was a question which Lord Alceston tried more than once to ask, but
  seemed to lack the courage. At last he asked it in a low, nervous tone.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea&mdash;any theory&mdash;as to the murderer?"</p>

  <p>The question seemed to agitate my father almost as much as Lord Alceston.
  He was white to the very lips, and for several moments failed to answer
  it.</p>

  <p>"We had better not discuss that, I think," he said hoarsely. "We may have
  our ideas. Let us keep them to ourselves. It is not a thing to be whispered
  about."</p>

  <p>Again there was a brief silence, which my father broke, speaking in a
  somewhat lighter tone.</p>

  <p>"Come, let us go inside. I have neglected my guests long enough."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston remained for a moment without moving. Then my father went
  and laid his hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Pray come in, my lord," he said earnestly. "Remember that we two alone
  know of this thing, and with me it is buried."</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston roused himself, as though with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Monsieur de Feurget. Yes, I will come in with you. But just
  one word on another subject. Monsieur d'Aubron was a guest of yours this
  evening?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was; but neither a frequent nor a welcome one. In fact, it was
  his first and last visit."</p>

  <p>"I am glad of it. I heard at the hotel that my cousin had been seen
  playing with him."</p>

  <p>"I saw them playing together at the casino," my father answered, "and
  heard Mr. Carlyon promise to go to his rooms to-night. I knew that that would
  be a dangerous visit for your cousin, and he seems a nice boy; so I got them
  to come here instead, and have had the pleasure of balking Monsieur
  d'Aubron's little game."</p>

  <p>I felt a great sense of relief at my father's words, for I saw that Lord
  Alceston was satisfied. The two men moved slowly away, and disappeared
  through the open window. Then I rose up, cramped and stiff, and softly
  crossing the lawn made my way to my room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-07"
     id="ch2-07">VII.&mdash;A VAIN APPEAL.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I slept badly that night, and remained in my room till late
  on the following morning. When I descended, just before lunch-time, I found
  my father out on the balcony alone, lolling in a low basket-chair and lazily
  rolling a cigarette. I went out to him at once, full of the purpose which was
  in my mind.</p>

  <p>He nodded a brief good-morning to me, and went on with his task. I watched
  him for a few moments in silence. Then I drew a chair out to his side and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not going out this morning, mon fire," I said. "I want to
  talk to you."</p>

  <p>He looked at me searchingly from out of his half-closed eyes, as though
  trying to read what was in my thoughts. But I had nerved myself to my task,
  and my eyes met his steadily.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not going out yet," he answered. "My time is at your disposal.
  What do you want to say to me, child? Is it a new dress, or a hat from Madame
  Faveur's, or a bracelet, or what?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"It is none of these things, <i>mon père</i>," I said. "I have plenty of
  all of them."</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?"</p>

  <p>I took his hands in mine and stroked them.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon père</i>," I cried softly, "I am not happy."</p>

  <p>"Not happy!" He repeated the words lingeringly, as though he found some
  sort of mockery in them.</p>

  <p>Then he looked steadily at me.</p>

  <p>"Will you explain?"</p>

  <p>"I will try," I answered, with a sigh for his manner was not encouraging.
  "Do you suppose, <i>mon père</i>, that a girl of my age can be happy without
  a single companion or relation and living somehow under a cloud? No, I am not
  happy. I am miserable."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it," he said, a little coldly. "I have done my best for
  you."</p>

  <p>"I think you have, <i>mon père</i>, and I am grateful to you&mdash;very
  grateful. But, all the same, I am not happy," I confessed sadly.</p>

  <p>"Will you try and explain yourself further?" he said. "I will if I can," I
  answered. "Let me try and put my life before you."</p>

  <p>I was silent for a few minutes, collecting my thoughts. When I was ready
  to commence his face did not please me. Its expression was hard and cold, and
  there was no promise of sympathy in it. But my mind was firmly made up, and
  no words or looks of his would have stopped me.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I remember anything before the convent," I began. "I must
  have gone there when I was very young indeed."</p>

  <p>"You were five years old," my father interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I could not have been older. From the very first there seemed to be
  something strange about me. The other girls had all of them their fathers and
  mothers and brothers to talk about&mdash;had, many of them, the same circle
  of friends&mdash;and were always looking forward to holidays and <i>fête</i>
  days when they went home or their friends came to see them. With me it was
  all very different. I alone had neither relations nor friends nor home."</p>

  <p>"You had me," my father interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had you. But how often did you come to see me, and how long did
  you stop when you did come?"</p>

  <p>"I was hard at work earning money to keep you at the convent. Madame
  Duqueville's charges were not low, and I was poor then."</p>

  <p>"I am not grumbling, <i>mon père</i>, far from it. I only want you to see
  how lonely I was there, and how strange my position was. I had no idea even
  as to what my father's position was, or to what rank of life he belonged. Nor
  did I know anything of my mother. Sometimes, when I tried very hard to
  remember a little about my earlier childhood, I had dim&mdash;very
  dim&mdash;visions."</p>

  <p>I paused, and let my eyes wander thoughtfully away, over the pleasant
  gardens and the bending pine trees to the long streak of blue sea far away in
  the distance. My father started a little at my last words, and letting fall
  his cigarette, leaned forward toward me with a half-questioning,
  half-startled light in his dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Visions? Memories? Bah! you can remember nothing!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No, that is true," I answered, with a sigh. "There is only one thing I
  want to remember: my mother's face&mdash;and that I cannot. Will you not tell
  me something about her, <i>mon père</i>?"</p>

  <p>He stood over me with flashing eyes and trembling lips.</p>

  <p>"Marie! Did I not forbid you ever to mention her name? She is dead, I tell
  you, and that is enough. She died when you were a baby."</p>

  <p>"You will tell me nothing about her; you keep me ignorant of everything,"
  I cried sadly. "Oh, <i>mon père</i>, I will complain no longer at our lonely
  life, I will worry you for nothing. I will content myself if only you will
  give me one thing&mdash;your trust, your confidence. I hear you walk
  restlessly up and down your room all night long; I see you shun all society
  and live alone, that you may hug the closer some secret sorrow; I see the
  lines and scars of a great grief written into your face, and I know nothing
  of it. I can offer you no sympathy, no comfort. I must live on, friendless
  and lonely, miserable in the shadow of your trouble. Only let me really share
  it and I will be brave&mdash;I will complain no more."</p>

  <p>He turned away from me, and shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, child. It is impossible. The weight of it would crush you."</p>

  <p>"Try me," I cried eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot."</p>

  <p>"Then, for God's sake, let me go back to the convent again!" I cried
  passionately. "Let me go somewhere&mdash;away from here."</p>

  <p>"Back to the convent! No, child, you must stop here. What could you do
  there at your age?"</p>

  <p>"I could teach&mdash;teach music, and singing, and English enough for the
  little ones. At any rate, I should be no longer a trouble to you," I cried
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>My father was very pale, and the hand which held his long cigarette shook.
  At first I thought that it was anger; since I have thought that it may have
  been some other emotion.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you are so unhappy," he said slowly. "I did not know it.
  It is a new idea to me. I must think it all over, and we must talk again. I
  will see whether we cannot make some change."</p>

  <p>And with these words he left me.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-08"
     id="ch2-08">VIII.&mdash;A FEARFUL SECRET. "WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH
     IT?"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I know all now. Neillson's story, told to me while we were
  clinging to the rock together on that terrible night, is true, word for word.
  Not that I ever doubted it; dying men seldom lie. But it all sounded so much
  like a wild romance that at times I almost fancied afterward that the whole
  story must have been some hideous nightmare which had stamped itself on my
  brain during one of the stages of the fever which nearly ended my days after
  my wonderful escape at Clanavon. But all doubt has gone now. Unwillingly
  enough, M. de Feurget has corroborated the facts. Cecile d'Augerville's
  vengeance has been a terrible one, indeed. Of my father I dare not think;
  neither of my mother, nor of myself. M. de Feurget's advice was good. I will
  take a little time to consider this matter before I act.</p>

  <p>What have I done, I wonder, that Fate should apply such exquisite torture
  as well as heap such troubles upon my head? For months I struggled against
  the haunting memories of her face&mdash;and now, at the moment of my despair,
  Fate brings us together again, and tempts me even to madness. I thought her
  beautiful, even when I saw her in a dingy-looking lodging-house here,
  wandering about those gardens by moonlight with her and out on the breezy
  cliffs seems like a breath of paradise to me. Fool that I am to revel in a
  joy which must fade away into bitter regret if ever I put out my hand to
  grasp it. And yet it is too late to be wise now&mdash;too late when the touch
  of her fingers, a single glance from her eyes, or a word from her lips, can
  bring joy bounding into my heart and send the blood coursing fiercely through
  my brains! Too late&mdash;too late! I love her&mdash;I, who have nothing for
  a heritage but shame, who have not even a name to give her.</p>

  <p>I have been to see my mother. May God grant that some day the memory of
  that visit may fade away! She was at Gorton Park, in Leicestershire, always
  her favorite place, though my father seldom cared to go there. It was too
  much out of the world for him. For my mother, in tier present condition, it
  seems the most fitting abode. Every word we spoke, and every little detail of
  our interview, are still burning in my brain. What relief can I hope to gain
  by writing it down? I scarcely know, and yet something prompts me to do
  so.</p>

  <p>It was night when I arrived, and I was faint and tired with travelling
  night and day and with the exhaustion of tormenting thoughts. When they told
  me that her ladyship kept to her own suite of rooms, and that I was to dine
  alone, I think that I was glad. And yet it was an awful time I had in the old
  picture gallery, with Groves behind my chair, talking all the time and
  worrying because I could eat nothing. Sometimes I wonder that I keep
  sane&mdash;that my hot blood does not boil into a fever and my mind lose its
  balance. Trouble I could face, I think, as well E; most men; but surely this
  thing that has come to me is outside the bounds of such things as men call
  trouble!</p>

  <p>That night was like a night in hell to me. All round me, as I sat at that
  miserable meal, were the dark, stern faces of the Alcestons and Clanavons of
  former days, and it seemed to me that as the firelight flashed upon they
  oaken panels and time-stained canvases they were frowning down upon me as
  upon a usurper. It may be that my agony is stirring up strange fancies in my
  brain&mdash;it may be so. But it was a horrible thought!</p>

  <p>Then came that meeting&mdash;that dreadful interview. I found her sitting
  alone by the fireside in a darkened room, unlit even by a single candle. But
  oh! the terrible look in her face! It makes my heart ache and throb with pity
  even now when I think of the agony which she must have suffered to have left
  such a stamp upon her features. Am I as much changed, I wonder? I look in the
  glass and I see deep furrows lining my forehead, black lines under my eyes,
  and hollows in my cheeks. Yet these all seem as nothing when I think of her
  branded face.</p>

  <p>She drew me to her and kissed me quietly, and I stood by her side, holding
  her hand in mine. But her lips were as cold as ice, and her eyes were dry and
  burning. Alas! I fear that her tears were all shed.</p>

  <p>"Mother," I said, "I have much to tell you. I know everything."</p>

  <p>"I did my best to keep it from you," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I know it. I should have done well to have taken your advice. It is too
  late now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is too late now," she repeated, mechanically. I stood back and
  spoke to her from among the shadows of the dim firelight.</p>

  <p>"It was from Neillson that I heard it first. I had no idea that he was in
  hiding there when I went to Clanavon Castle. You know, mother, what I told
  you when you refused to let me share the full knowledge of this awful thing
  with you?"</p>

  <p>"You swore that you would find out all for yourself. Oh, Bernard, my son!
  Bernard, why could you not have taken my word? You might have been spared all
  this misery."</p>

  <p>I shook my head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"I could not have rested, mother, until I had discovered everything," I
  told her. "The vague hint which you had given me&mdash;for it was nothing
  more, after all, than a hint&mdash;was working within me like a poison.</p>

  <p>"I could neither sleep nor rest. I was more determined even than before to
  find out everything, only instead of working openly I saw that I must do so
  secretly. You would not help me; you only threw obstacles in my way. It was
  the uncertainty of it which tortured me most. It seemed to me that my father
  must be a man above suspicion. Whatever the cloud was, it could be cleared
  away. So I went to work. I went first to Mr. Brudnell, but he would tell me
  nothing. Then I determined to search my father's papers, and as those at
  Grosvenor Square had already been gone through, I went down to Clanavon
  Castle."</p>

  <p>"It was Fate," my mother murmured.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me that Mrs. Smith behaved curiously about the key of the
  tower room, and down in the village they told strange tales of a light
  burning there at night. I, myself, saw it, and I became suspicious&mdash;of
  what I scarcely knew. I discovered certain proofs that the room had been
  recently inhabited, and I laid my plans. Hours after they had all gone to
  rest I rose softly and commenced a rigid search of the apartment. I need only
  tell you whom I found in hiding there. To my horror and amazement it was
  Neillson. He fled at the sight of me through a secret passage. When, at last,
  I caught him, we found ourselves like rats in a trap. The incoming tide had
  shut off our retreat, and when all hope seemed over, and we stood on the
  threshold of death, he told me all. He told me, believing that life was over
  for both of us, and that I should carry this hideous secret in my heart for a
  few short minutes only."</p>

  <p>"He should not have told you; not even then," she said, softly.</p>

  <p>"He told it me to make death easier," I answered; "and it seemed then that
  it was so. That we escaped with our lives seems to me now nothing short of a
  miracle. When I recovered consciousness and they told me Neillson too lived,
  I could scarcely believe it. He was still dangerously ill, though, when I
  left Clanavon. Have you heard whether he is alive?"</p>

  <p>"I had a letter from Mrs. Smith this morning," my mother said. "He is
  better, and talks of taking a journey."</p>

  <p>"Is it safe for him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"His mother tells me that she herself could scarcely recognize him. He is
  wasted to a shadow and quite gray."</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow, indeed! Yet his reward is to come. Much is promised to those
  who are 'faithful unto death.'"</p>

  <p>"Faithful unto death." She repeated the words with a suddenly softened
  look in her worn face, as though there were something in the thought of it
  pleasant to her. Could it be that she, too, was looking forward to that last
  release from the burden of our terrible secret? The thought made me shudder,
  and yet, after all, was it not natural? Had I not, too, had the same
  wish?</p>

  <p>"Mother," I said, "I have more to tell you. You knew about that story of
  the past?"</p>

  <p>She bowed her head.</p>

  <p>"I knew all."</p>

  <p>"You remember about the duel? About&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped me with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"I knew all," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"You know the name of the woman who was murdered on that same awful night?
  You can connect&mdash;you have connected in your mind&mdash;that deed with
  the history of those distant days?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! I have," she whispered, with a deep shudder. "Neillson, too, saw
  that woman, and recognized Marie d'Augerville. He knows."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>"He knows, but he will not speak. The secret is in our hands&mdash;yours
  and mine."</p>

  <p>"What shall we do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, mother, you may well ask. It is in our own hands, to seal our own
  doom or to carry it with us to the grave."</p>

  <p>She did not speak. I knelt down by her side and took her hands. They hung
  passively in mine. The flow of the fire was upon them, but they were
  cold.</p>

  <p>"Another knows of it, you say? What does he bid you do?"</p>

  <p>"Carry it to the grave. If we speak, who is the gainer? Who is there to
  profit by our shame? None. There is no male heir. The estates would go to the
  crown. If I die childless they also go to the crown. So must it be."</p>

  <p>"He advises that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and, mother, we must think of this. If we disclose one half of our
  secret we imperil the other&mdash;the darker half. Her identity would be
  established. The coincidence of the two deaths on one night would
  suggest&mdash;would give rise to speculation. The rest might follow."</p>

  <p>"He is right. Bernard, my son, life is over for us both. For me, the worst
  is already past. The chords of my life are almost severed. I shall die. But
  you&mdash;all your life&mdash;God help you; if there be a God. Amen."</p>

  <p>Then she gave a little low cry and sank into my arms. At first I thought
  it was death. But she recovered presently...</p>

  <p>In the morning she sent me away. We could bear it better apart for a
  while, she thought, without the sight of each other's misery. When she wanted
  me she would send for me.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-09"
     id="ch2-09">IX.&mdash;MAD MOMENTS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I am a most unfortunate girl. I think that Nature meant me
  to be light-hearted, but Fate is handicapping me in a most unfair manner. My
  father's gloomy ways have been hard enough to bear; now I find that Lord
  Alceston is very much the same. Thus it happens that the two men who, at
  present, make up the sum of my little existence are both melancholy mad.</p>

  <p>I am going to make a most shocking and unnatural confession. My sympathies
  are more with Lord Alceston than with my father. My father is kind and gentle
  to every one else in the world, so that the poor people around love him more
  even than their own curl. To me alone he is cold and unresponsive. I fear
  that he does not love me. Why it is so, or whose fault it is, I cannot tell.
  But there is between us always a barrier, a restraint, which no effort of
  mine can remove.</p>

  <p>It is strange what a violent fancy my father seems to have taken to Lord
  Alceston. Does he return it, I wonder? I suppose he does, or he would not
  come here so often. If I were a very, very foolish girl I might
  imagine&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but then I'm not foolish, and I don't imagine
  anything of the sort.</p>

  <p>He does come often, though, and his coming makes it pleasanter. Sometimes
  I sing to him, and he seems to like that. Sometimes my father and he play
  chess, but they never finish a game. One or the other goes off into a deep
  fit of thought, and unless I go to the rescue, and clear the chessmen away,
  and take Lord Alceston off, the whole evening passes while they sit there. I
  take care that that doesn't happen often, of course. Sometimes Lord Alceston
  brings Mr. Carlyon with him, and sometimes Mr. Carlyon comes alone, though it
  isn't often he can summon up courage, for though he doesn't like to be told
  so he's a very shy boy. Very&mdash;very seldom now my father goes to the
  casino. On those nights Lord Alceston stays away.</p>

  <p>I am afraid that I am getting a very silly girl. The other evening we
  expected Lord Alceston, and he did not come. It seemed such a slight thing
  for him to miss one evening, and yet I felt as disappointed as though some
  great trouble had come. I sat down and began to think about it. I am very
  much afraid that I am courting a great trial. It is not likely that he would
  ever care for me&mdash;in that way; and yet I am quite sure that as long as I
  live I shall never care for any other man! I am not half so sorry as I ought
  to be for this terrible trouble of his. Somehow, it seems to bring me nearer
  to him&mdash;to make the distance between us less...</p>

  <p>My father called me to him the other morning and said that he wished to
  talk to me about the request which I had made him, that I might go back to
  the convent. I am afraid that he saw my consternation. Strange what a change
  has come to me in so short a time. A few weeks ago I was longing to be away.
  Now it seems to me that I am perfectly and absolutely contented, so much so
  that the very mention or thought of going away fills me with alarm.</p>

  <p>He had thought over my wish, he said, and he had come to the conclusion
  that perhaps he had not been considerate enough for me. Perhaps&mdash;</p>

  <p>He broke off in the middle of his sentence, and sat gazing idly out of the
  open window. We had been dining together alone at a little round table half
  out on the veranda, and the fruit and wine and cigarettes still remained on
  the white cloth. It was a wonderfully still night. It was all very beautiful.
  But when I looked away toward my father, wondering why he did not finish his
  sentence, the memory of it all faded away from me and a great fear shook my
  heart. His face was pale, and rigid as death. His lips were white as the
  spotless <i>serviette</i> which he clinched fiercely in one hand. His body
  seemed to have shrunk a little back in his low chair, but his head was thrust
  forward, full of an unutterable horror, and his eyes were riveted upon a
  certain spot in the garden. A great fear seized me and held me speechless,
  but my eyes followed the direction of his spell-bound gaze, and I saw the
  figure of a man standing upon the lawn, looking toward us. He wore a long
  dark cloak, and he held his hat in his hand as though to relieve his forehead
  for a minute from its weight. I knew who it was in a moment, and waved my
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Father," I said, "don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I had turned toward him, and his look seemed to freeze the words on my
  lips. Great drops of perspiration were bursting out upon his forehead, and he
  had stretched out his hands in a wild, convulsive gesture of terror which no
  words could express.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon père!</i>" I cried. "What is the matter? Are you ill? Don't you
  see Lord Alceston?"</p>

  <p>He neither spoke, nor moved, nor changed his attitude. Lord Alceston,
  seeing that something was wrong, waved his hand to me, and came hurrying
  across the lawn. When he arrived, my father had fallen forward with a cry
  which seemed to rend the silent night air, and was lying senseless at my
  feet.</p>

  <p>Lord Alceston was very good. He pushed the servants out of the way, and
  took my father up in his arms as though he had been a baby, and carried him
  to his room. It was only a faint, and it did not last long. When he
  recovered, however, he bade us leave him alone for a while. He would try to
  sleep, he said. So we went downstairs, and Lord Alceston and I sat out on the
  balcony and talked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid your father is like me in one respect, Miss de Feurget," he
  said softly, after a long silence. "He has troubles in his life which do not
  lie on the surface."</p>

  <p>"My father frightens me sometimes," I told him. "I know that there must be
  something terrible in his past. At times he seems almost on the verge of
  madness, and I know nothing. Whatever it is, it seems to me that I should be
  less unhappy if I knew it."</p>

  <p>"It must be bad for you, living so much alone with him," he said
  pityingly. "You must be terribly lonely sometimes."</p>

  <p>"I have been," I said, "but not lately."</p>

  <p>The last few words I meant to say to myself, but he heard them. I saw a
  sudden light leap into his eyes, and they gleamed for a moment strangely in
  the moonlight. But he said nothing&mdash;and my heart sank. He never would. I
  knew it. His secret would keep his lips sealed&mdash;even if he ever did care
  for me.</p>

  <p>There was a long pause. Then he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"You have some compensations," he said. "Yours is a beautiful home."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I shall always think of it&mdash;when I have gone."</p>

  <p>"Are you going away?" I asked quickly. Then the color streamed into my
  face, for he must have heard the fear in my tone. But if he did, he never
  noticed it. He kept his face turned resolutely away from me. My heart sank
  low, and if he had looked he must have seen the tears glistening in my
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I cannot stay here always," he said.</p>

  <p>"But you are not going yet?" I asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>He stood up, and his face looked ghastly pale in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must go soon," he said, "very soon, Miss de Feurget. I am not
  quite sane to-night, I think. If I stay here I shall say more than I
  ought."</p>

  <p>"Then stay," I whispered, resting my hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>I ought not to have done it, I know. It was very wrong of me, and my
  punishment was swift. But was it punishment? Ah! well, I won't say. Only this
  is what happened. I felt myself grasped by a pair of strong arms, and I heard
  broken, passionate words bursting from his lips which sounded to me like the
  sweetest music, and&mdash;and&mdash;but the rest I cannot tell.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-10"
     id="ch2-10">X.&mdash;NEILLSON'S DREAM.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a man of my humble birth I, Philip Neillson, have passed
  through a strange and checkered life, and now in the autumn of my days can
  look back upon a series of remarkable incidents such as few men know of. But
  there is one which, far above all the rest, I find myself often pondering
  upon, partly because there is no man in this enlightened world, be he
  philosopher, or man of science, or book-learned, who can explain it to me,
  partly because it is one of those marvellous instances which sometimes occur
  showing by what slight means great mysteries may be solved.</p>

  <p>It is my object here to set down in writing only that incident, and what
  followed thereon. The other awful events in my life I do not here intend to
  dwell upon. I told them once to my young master when hideous death stared us
  in the face and we seemed to be on the threshold of eternity, and since then
  I have told them to no one; nor shall I ever.</p>

  <p>It was four months after my young master, Lord Bernard, and I were carried
  by the tide, more dead than alive, on to the beach below Clanavon Castle. My
  recovery, unaided as I was by his vigorous constitution and hardened frame,
  trained to all manner of athletic exercises, was very slow indeed, and I was
  still only able to crawl about with the aid of a strong stick and by leaning
  on my sister's arm. I was, of course, in a weak, nervous state, and very
  susceptible to any mental derangement; but what happened could have had no
  connection with my state of health for a very obvious reason.</p>

  <p>All through the weary period of my illness my sleep at nights had been
  constantly broken by horrible dreams and nightmares, most of them bearing on
  the tragical episodes in which I had been one of the minor figures. But as I
  regained a little strength, and was able to take more exercise, they grew
  less and less frequent, until I was almost altogether free of them. For a
  fortnight I had slept peacefully and undisturbed; then one night I had a
  strange dream, or rather a vision.</p>

  <p>It was no nightmare, full of lurid coloring and fierce sensation. It could
  scarcely be called a dream, because there was in it no sequence of events or
  moving figures. It was a vision. Before my eyes, utterly devoid of any
  connection with any person or surroundings, standing as it were in a chaos of
  its own, I saw a single object&mdash;a plain gold bracelet. When I awoke I
  thought of it as curious, and no more. During the day it vanished altogether
  from my memory. But at night a strange thing happened. The vision was
  reproduced in an exactly similar manner.</p>

  <p>This time it set me thinking, but, strangely enough, to no immediate
  purpose. I could not connect the bracelet with any tangible train of
  circumstances. It is strange that I failed to do so, but so it was.</p>

  <p>On the third night the vision came to me again, but in a different manner.
  This time the bracelet was clasped high up on the white cold arm of a
  sleeping or dead woman. It seemed to me in my vision that this time the
  bracelet seemed to recall something to my mind.</p>

  <p>I thought of a morning far back in the past, when I had entered my young
  master's dressing-room and found him bending with flushed, handsome face over
  two morocco cases which had just arrived from a jeweller in Paris. They were
  open, and while I was pouring the water into his bath and making preparations
  for his toilette, I had a good view of them. They both contained gold
  bracelets, exactly similar in every respect. Very soon afterward I became
  aware that my master was wearing one on his right arm. The other I know that
  he presented to Mademoiselle d'Augerville.</p>

  <p>The whole vision of that morning and of the two bracelets passed before my
  eyes like a flash. Then, again, I found myself with my eyes riveted upon that
  motionless white arm with its plain gold band. It seemed to me that it was
  exactly similar to those other two, save in one small respect. There was a
  little round knob near the fastening, which showed where it opened. On the
  others the design had evidently been to avoid showing this, and thus carry to
  its extreme the idea of absolute simplicity.</p>

  <p>When I looked a strange thing happened. Another hand of almost unnatural
  whiteness, with long, slim, colorless fingers, slowly loomed into shape, and
  deliberately turned the bracelet round on the arm. The effect was to hide
  that small knob, and to render the bracelet apparently exactly similar to the
  other two. When this was effectually done, the hand slowly disappeared, as
  though it had dissolved into the air.</p>

  <p>There followed a space of time, the length of which I had no means of
  determining; then the bracelet slowly slipped round to its former position.
  It had scarcely become quite stationary before the hand loomed into sight
  again, and slowly turned it round so as to hide the fastenings. This happened
  three times; then I awoke.</p>

  <p>The whole of that day I remained in a sort of dazed state, pondering over
  this strange dream of mine. On the morrow a ray of light came to me. I rose
  early, after a long and dreamless night's rest, and, packing a small bag,
  announced my intention of taking a journey.</p>

  <p>Of course my poor old mother protested loudly against the rashness and
  folly of my doing anything of the sort. I should be recognized, she said, and
  arrested at once; but I bade her remember what my appearance had been at the
  time when my description had been given to the police, and what it was now.
  My illness had done me one good service. None could possibly have recognized
  in the William Smith, as I called myself now, the Philip Neillson, valet to
  his late Lordship the Earl of Alceston, and suspected of his murder. The one
  had been tall, dark, and smooth-shaven; the William Smith of the present was
  a man apparently stricken in years, with bent frame, tottering footsteps, and
  snow-white hair and beard. Even my mother felt herself silenced when I
  reminded her of my changed appearance.</p>

  <p>It took me two days to get down into Leicestershire On the close of the
  second I presented myself at Gorton Park and asked to see Lady Alceston.</p>

  <p>I was told at first that it was impossible. She saw no one. But I sent my
  name up in a sealed letter, and the man came quickly back. Her ladyship would
  see me at once.</p>

  <p>They led me through many rooms and along many passages to a small,
  darkened chamber. A gray-haired, sad-faced woman looked up strangely and
  eagerly at me from the depths of a low chair, and my heart, which had at
  first almost stood still, beat fast, and my eyes filled with tears. If I was
  changed, what was she? Where was her sunny brown hair and dazzling complexion
  and bewildering smile, which once had made her one of society's beauties?
  Gone, all gone! It was a trembling old woman who leaned forward toward me in
  the twilight, with nothing save the queenly poise of her small head to remind
  me of the Lady Alceston of the past.</p>

  <p>"Neillson? No, it cannot be! My God! how you are changed! or are you
  disguised?" she said, in a low, half-fearful whisper.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "Nature has disguised me, your ladyship," I said. "I have
  been ill."</p>

  <p>"Come here, Neillson, and give me your hand. It does me good to see some
  one&mdash;who knows. My son has been here, and the agony in his eyes kills
  me. I had to send him away. Why have you come? You have a reason. Is it quite
  safe, do you think?"</p>

  <p>I stroked my long beard and, standing in the firelight, pointed to my
  wrinkled face and deep-sunken eyes, and looked downward at my tottering
  limbs.</p>

  <p>"I think that it is safe," I said. "Does not your ladyship think so?"</p>

  <p>She looked at me with an infinite pity softening her haggard face, and the
  tears forcing themselves into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is safe," she said. "But why have you come? You had a
  reason."</p>

  <p>"Ay, I had a reason, your ladyship. I have had a strange vision."</p>

  <p>"Three times I have seen in the dead of night, before my closed eyes, one
  object. I have seen a bracelet upon the arm of a dead woman."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship, many years ago, when I was with Lord Clanavon he was
  then&mdash;in France, he bought two gold bracelets. One he gave to the woman
  he married, one&mdash;he wore himself."</p>

  <p>"I knew it," she moaned.</p>

  <p>"You knew it!" I repeated eagerly. "Did you ever see it, my lady? Can you
  tell me what it is like?"</p>

  <p>"Neillson," she said hoarsely, "it is strange that you should ask me this.
  Listen, and I will tell you something. Two days before the funeral I read an
  account of that murder in the Bethnal Green Road. In the examination of the
  woman they found a plain gold bracelet, high up upon her right arm."</p>

  <p>"Go on," I murmured; "go on!"</p>

  <p>"Then I remembered that my lord was still wearing his; that it might be
  seen; that the coincidence might be ferreted out by some busybody. Who could
  tell what might happen? Strange things come to light nowadays, and truth is
  like cork held down beneath the waters, ever seeking to rise to the surface.
  A restless, haunting fear seized hold of me, and in the dead of night I stole
  to his room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes! yes!"</p>

  <p>"And I took the bracelet from off his arm."</p>

  <p>"You have it now," I cried. "It is here."</p>

  <p>"It is."</p>

  <p>She rose slowly from her chair, and, with the aid of a stick, crossed the
  room and unlocked a cabinet. In a few minutes she returned, holding in her
  hand a gold bracelet.</p>

  <p>I snatched it from her, and bent forward eagerly over the fire. The flames
  shone upon its dull, even surface, and I turned it quickly round. It was most
  certainly one of the two which I had seen long ago on my master's
  dressing-table. I knew it from the peculiarity of its perfectly plain contour
  without visible fastenings. It was one of those two bracelets, but the
  bracelet which I had seen in my dream was different.</p>

  <p>I felt excited and restless, and I sat looking forward in my chair while
  wild, disconnected thoughts chased one another rapidly through my brain. My
  memory had not played me false, then! The bracelet on that dead arm was the
  fellow one to this. But what meant that strangest part of my vision, the
  deliberate turning round of the bracelet, as though to hide that sole
  difference between them? My brain whirled with conjectures; but through the
  maze decision came.</p>

  <p>I looked up to find her ladyship watching me with a strange, awesome
  intentness She asked no question in words, but her look demanded an
  explanation. What could I say to her?</p>

  <p>"My dream has all unsettled me," I said in a low tone. "May I keep this,"
  and I touched it with my forefinger, "for a while?"</p>

  <p>"Forever," she answered, with a shudder. "Take it away and let me see no
  more of it."</p>

  <p>I rose, and stood before her as though to take my leave.</p>

  <p>"You cannot go to-night," she said. "It is late. Why in such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>I looked at my watch. The evening was far advanced. I could do nothing
  until to-morrow.</p>

  <p>"They shall get you a room ready here," she said, "and some supper. Ring
  the bell."</p>

  <p>I obeyed her, and she gave her orders. Then she dismissed me.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with that?" she asked curiously, as I turned to
  go.</p>

  <p>I hesitated. It was hard to explain. Yet I must say something.</p>

  <p>"My dream," I muttered. "I want to verify a part of it. It haunts me."</p>

  <p>She said no more, but glanced at me compassionately. She thought,
  doubtless, that trouble and illness had turned my brain. I said no more, but
  went. It was better for her to think so.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-11"
     id="ch2-11">XI.&mdash;IN DANGER AT SCOTLAND YARD.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The early train on the following morning conveyed me up to
  London, and in the afternoon, after having made a few changes in my attire, I
  did what many would doubtless have considered a foolhardy thing, but which,
  owing to the great change in my appearance, was tolerably safe. I, Philip
  Neillson, "wanted" by the police for the murder of a peer of the realm,
  presented myself at Scotland Yard, and after having read through in the
  waiting-room a bill on which all particulars concerning me and my full
  description were set forth, was ushered into the presence of one of the
  superintendents.</p>

  <p>Here I made a false calculation, which came very near upsetting all my
  plans. I presented myself as Richard Ashdale, a school-master from Beeton,
  near York, and explained to the inspector that in an old newspaper, which had
  only recently fallen into my hands, I had read the account of the murder of a
  woman in a street off Bethnal Green Road. I had had a niece in London, whom I
  had lost sight of since a little before that time, and I knew that she had
  always worn a bracelet above her elbow on her right arm, in the same place as
  the bracelet on the murdered woman. I had called to see whether they would
  allow me to inspect the bracelet with a view to identifying it as my niece's
  property.</p>

  <p>The inspector listened to me in silence, and I noticed that the clerk
  sitting at a desk by his side wrote down in shorthand every word I said. I
  suppose it was all a matter of form, but it made me feel rather uneasy.</p>

  <p>When I had finished I was asked to describe my niece, which, being now on
  my guard, I did without hesitation. She was fair, I said, with golden hair
  slightly streaked with gray, tall and very slim, but finely shaped, with dark
  eyes, and had lived like a lady. The inspector took down a ledger and
  appeared to compare my description with an entry there. Then he unlocked a
  drawer, and after a brief search handed me a bracelet.</p>

  <p>My heart gave a great leap, but I struggled hard to hide my agitation. The
  bracelet I held in my hand was exactly similar to the one which her ladyship
  had given me, except in one particular&mdash;the fastening; and in that
  particular it was exactly similar to the one which I had seen in my
  dream.</p>

  <p>I examined it carefully, and then handed it back to the inspector.</p>

  <p>"I am very happy to see that this bracelet is not the one my niece wore,"
  I said in a tone of forced relief. "It is far plainer and more massive."</p>

  <p>The inspector looked at me steadily.</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure of that, I suppose?" he asked. "It happens curiously
  enough that your description of your niece exactly tallies with the
  description of the murdered woman. That seems a strange coincidence."</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, that bracelet was not the one she wore," I said, slowly
  rising to my feet. "I am sorry to have troubled you, though, of course, I am
  glad to have my mind set at ease."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he said. "Good-morning."</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir."</p>

  <p>I left the office with beating heart, glad to get safely away, and
  conscious that in more ways than one I had been imprudent. Immediately the
  door was closed I heard a sharp whistle behind me, which I concluded to come
  from the repeating tube in the inspector's room. On my way out I passed
  through the office with which it communicated, and one of the clerks was just
  letting fall the tube which he had been holding in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Detective Harrison is wanted for immediate duty," he said, turning to a
  little knot of men close to the door. One of them, a tall, thin man, who had
  been lounging about listening to the conversation, immediately went to the
  counter.</p>

  <p>"Where for instructions?" he asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"Superintendent Howe's room," the clerk answered.</p>

  <p>The detective nodded, and strolled off. I passed through the door, and
  made my exit as quickly as possible. I was not exactly alarmed, but I was
  certainly disturbed. Superintendent Howe was the officer from whom I had just
  come.</p>

  <p>Certain vague ideas had now assumed a tangible shape in my mind, and I was
  slowly developing some sort of a plan of action. After I left Scotland Yard,
  I walked for about an hour, thinking deeply, and quite unconscious of what
  direction I was taking. When I had come to a conclusion, I found myself in
  the Strand, close to Charing Cross Station, and stopped short, meaning to
  turn round and make my way back to Waterloo. In doing so, I came face to face
  with a man carrying a small black bag, and walking as though in a great
  hurry. He did not glance at me, but I knew him. It was the detective told off
  for immediate service at Scotland Yard, and it flashed upon me in a moment
  that that immediate service was to watch me while they inquired into the
  truth of my story.</p>

  <p>I made no sign of having recognized him, and slowly crossed the road,
  taking care to affect all the caution of a countryman. Then I went into the
  telegraph office and wrote out a telegram to Mr. Richard Ashdale, Beeton,
  near York.</p>

  <p>"It is not Carrie. Am returning to-night."</p>

  <p>Although it was life or death for me, I could not help admiring the
  unobtrusive way in which he kept close to me. He was at the counter when I
  handed my fictitious message, and, of course, read it. I waited for him
  outside, and when he was within hearing, addressed a clergyman who was
  passing.</p>

  <p>"Could you inform me, sir," I asked, pulling off my hat, "where I could
  obtain a chop, or some slight refreshment of the sort, at a moderate
  cost?"</p>

  <p>The clergyman stopped and considered.</p>

  <p>"Are you pressed for time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I answered him that I was, and, as I had expected, he pointed to Gatti's
  restaurant.</p>

  <p>"You had better go in there, then, I think," he said. "It is rather noisy,
  but cheap and close at hand."</p>

  <p>I thanked him, and entered the swing doors. I had calculated, and
  correctly, that the detective would not follow me for a minute or two; so I
  had time to execute the stratagem which had occurred to me. I walked straight
  down the centre of the room and out of the opposite doors, called a hansom,
  and drove off to Waterloo. That night I was safe in Paris, without having
  seen anything more of Mr. Harrison.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-12"
     id="ch2-12">XII.&mdash;A WOMAN AND A BRACELET.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It had seemed to me during those long, weary days when I lay
  hidden in Clanavon Castle that the quick throbbing of life and energy had
  died out forever from my pulse, and that I should never feel its beat again.
  But now a change had come over me. The faint glimmerings of hope which had
  shone in upon my dulled senses and brain had filled my whole being with the
  glow and energy of reawakened life. I dare not feed it with the fuel of
  anticipation, or the reaction of failure would most surely have killed me. I
  simply let my brain work, and obeyed its directions as well as I was
  able.</p>

  <p>On the night of my arrival in Paris I stayed at a quiet middle-class hotel
  in the Rue de St. Pierre, and kept myself out of sight as much as possible.
  Early on the morrow I made my way to the Boulevards and presented myself at
  the establishment of Messrs. Rougut, the great jewellers.</p>

  <p>My request to see one of the principals was presently complied with, and I
  found myself in a small glass office in one corner of the shop. Opposite to
  me was a young, smartly-dressed Parisian, who rose from a small marble table
  covered with diamonds, which he had been examining, and removing a cigarette
  from between his white teeth, asked me my business.</p>

  <p>I told him that I wished to order a bracelet exactly similar to one which
  had been made at his establishment some long time ago. He bowed politely, and
  intimated his perfect willingness to accept the order.</p>

  <p>"We always keep the designs," he remarked, "of every article of jewelry
  manufactured upon the premises. If you can give me the name and the date when
  the bracelet was purchased, I can turn up the design and show you&mdash;that
  is," he added, shrugging his shoulders, "provided we are under no obligation
  to furnish no more of the same pattern."</p>

  <p>I brought out my pocket-book and consulted it.</p>

  <p>"It is a very long time ago," I remarked, hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"That is of no consequence."</p>

  <p>"On the 20th of May, 18&mdash;," I said, "you sent to Lord Clanavon, at
  the Leon d'Or Hotel, St. Marien, two bracelets. I don't know when he ordered
  them, but I know that that was about the date of their arrival."</p>

  <p>He touched a small hand gong on the table before him, and turned toward me
  with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Just about the time of my appearance in the world," he remarked, "so it
  goes without saying that I do not remember the order. Mordau," he continued,
  turning round to the man who had answered the bell, "send Monsieur Ducate
  here."</p>

  <p>The man bowed and withdrew. Directly afterward a tall, gray-haired old
  gentleman, with gold-rimmed eye-glasses, knocked at the door and entered.</p>

  <p>"Ducate, I want the design ledger for 18&mdash;," Mons. Rougut said. "This
  gentleman wishes to order a bracelet similar to one supplied to&mdash;to what
  name, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>"To Lord Clanavon."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes; to Lord Clanavon, some time during May of that year. Can you
  find the design?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, monsieur. In one moment."</p>

  <p>He disappeared, and presently brought in a large brass-bound ledger, the
  stiff white pages of which were covered with various designs for jewelry,
  evidently traced and pasted in. The entry was found directly, and we all
  three stood up and looked at it.</p>

  <p>"I remember it perfectly," Monsieur Ducate said, resting his long, slim
  forefinger upon the page. "The bracelets, as you see, are perfectly plain,
  and the clasp fastening is peculiar. It was a patent of our own, which I have
  often wondered did not take better. We have made scarcely another in the same
  way."</p>

  <p>"May I ask," I said, "whether you have ever before had an inquiry for a
  similar bracelet?"</p>

  <p>Monsieur Ducate tapped his forehead reflectively.</p>

  <p>"I think yes," he said. "If monsieur will pardon me one moment."</p>

  <p>He left the office, and returned with a small diary in his hand.</p>

  <p>"About a year ago," he said, "a lady, whose name we do not appear to have
  an entry of, called with a similar request to that which you are now making.
  We were quite willing to accept the commission, but we happened to be
  exceedingly busy at the time, and we could not promise that the bracelet
  should be ready by the time she stipulated. We had one in stock, however,
  exactly like it save in one respect&mdash;the fastening; and after a good
  deal of indecision she bought that one and took it away with her."</p>

  <p>"Was this it?" I asked, producing the one which Lady Alceston had given
  me.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Ducate took it and looked at it carefully.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, monsieur," he remarked, handing it back to me. "That is,
  without doubt, the identical bracelet which we made for Lord Clanavon."</p>

  <p>"And can you point out to me," I said, "where this one differs from the
  bracelet which the lady you mentioned purchased?"</p>

  <p>Monsieur Ducate laid the pointed edge of his white finger-nail in a
  certain spot of the bracelet.</p>

  <p>"In appearance, monsieur," he said, "only that here there would be a small
  knob on the one of later make. This one, as you see, is quite plain."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, sir," I said, "you could not give me any description of this
  lady. You don't remember anything about her appearance?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Very little, sir, I fear. She was dressed in black, I
  remember, and wore a rather thick veil. Her figure was good and her hair
  fair. The general impression she left upon me was that she was a good-looking
  woman. By the bye," he added, "she told me something by which you would be
  able to recognize her."</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"In her first inquiry for the bracelet she said that she was the lady to
  whom Lord Clanavon had presented the one she desired copied."</p>

  <p>"And did she say what had become of it?"</p>

  <p>"She had lost it, or mislaid it in some way&mdash;I forget her exact
  explanation."</p>

  <p>I thanked him, and he withdrew, carrying off the ledger with him. I could
  see that Monsieur Rougut was getting impatient.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you found out what you want to know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "Not quite, but I have discovered as much as I expected
  to."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Your order for the bracelet was only an excuse, I suppose?" he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely that," I replied. "I didn't expect to take up your time for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is nothing. You're quite welcome to the information we've been
  able to give you. Good-morning."</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir," I said. Then I came away.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-13"
     id="ch2-13">XIII.&mdash;LORD ALCESTON IS TEMPTED.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now, at last, the climax has come! I have thrown my honor
  after my fortune and my name, and have lost all. Was it madness that came
  over me, I wonder? Ay, the madness of love. We were alone, and it seemed to
  me that she tempted the words out of my lips. Shall I ever forget the glowing
  beauty of her face as she leaned over toward me on the balcony, her eyes full
  of the soft witchery of sweet, involuntary invitation, and her lips trembling
  with the eagerness which she could not hide? I wonder if any one in my place
  could have looked thus into the face of the woman he loved and not have told
  her so. I think not. It seems to me impossible.</p>

  <p>What does she think of me, I wonder! I have held her in my arms, my lips
  have sought hers and forced the kisses from them. I have told her
  passionately, fiercely, that I loved her, and then suddenly, without a word
  of warning, I thrust her from me and fled like a madman into the darkness. I
  heard her faint, reproachful cry as I hurried over the lawn, but I dared not
  turn back. One look, And I should have been her slave again.</p>

  <p>I am at war with Fortune indeed, and who shall say that she has used me
  fairly? Never since the days of my boyhood have I once seen anything in a
  woman's eyes to make my heart beat faster; never once have found my thoughts
  filled for a single moment with the memory of a woman's face. And now see
  what has happened! At the very moment when this avalanche of trouble has
  fallen upon my head, when more than ever it is my duty to be up and quit
  myself like a man, I find myself suddenly fallen a blind slave to a passion
  against which my frantic struggles are as impotent as though I had striven
  with my voice to stem the tide on that dark night in Clanavon Bay. What magic
  has she used that the slightest memory of those few moments of rapturous
  happiness should drive away from my memory every black thought and miserable
  recollection of my great grief?</p>

  <p>Let me think coolly for a moment, if I can! Here am I, without a name, and
  without a single farthing which I can call my own, striving to win&mdash;nay,
  I have already won&mdash;the love of a girl who believes me to be a peer of
  England. She may love me for myself alone; something tells me that she does;
  but even if it be so, I have no right to her love. Nay, it is dishonor to me
  that I have told her of mine...</p>

  <p>What am I to do? Tell her the truth! Perhaps her father has done so
  already! I cannot! There is only one other alternative. I must go away; leave
  her without a word of farewell. Can I do this? I must!...</p>

  <p>Her father has been here. When they showed him in I had but one thought.
  He had come in anger to upbraid me with seeking his daughter's love&mdash;and
  he was in the right. For the first time in my life I was ashamed to look a
  man full in the face. I stood patiently before him, expecting to hear a
  stream of fierce, angry words, and determined that, whatever he might say, I
  would bear for her sake, and for the sake of my own guilt.</p>

  <p>But there came no words from him of any sort, and presently I looked up
  surprised, half expecting to find him choking with rage. On the contrary, his
  agitation, for he was agitated, proceeded from quite a different cause.</p>

  <p>"Lord Alceston," he commenced, "my daughter has told me something of what
  has passed between you."</p>

  <p>"I am much to blame, Monsieur de Feurget," I answered. "You have cause to
  be very angry with me. I fear you will think that I have abused your
  hospitality."</p>

  <p>"It does not seem so to me," he said quietly. "Nay, I am proud that my
  daughter should have won your regard. There is no man in the world whom I
  would rather see her husband."</p>

  <p>"But you forget," I stammered, amazed.</p>

  <p>"I forget nothing. Listen. It would be blind, mad folly of you to disclose
  what would profit none, and would disgrace you, disgrace your mother, and
  disgrace your father's memory. Bury it, as I will. We three alone in the
  world&mdash;your mother, yourself, and I&mdash;know of it. Let it die out
  from our remembrance. But in case anything should ever happen to bring it to
  light&mdash;which nothing ever can&mdash;I will settle the whole of my
  fortune on you&mdash;yourself absolutely&mdash;on the day you marry my
  daughter. Say&mdash;do you consent to this?"</p>

  <p>The eagerness which shone in his face and which quivered in his tone was
  unmistakable. From what I had seen of Mons. de Feurget, I should have deemed
  him the last man in the world to be moved by vulgar ambition. Yet what motive
  could he have in urging me to marry his daughter? That he loved her I was
  sure, and yet by his offer he was exposing her to a dreadful risk.</p>

  <p>"Supposing I consented to this," I said in a low tone, broken with
  agitation. "Should you tell her&mdash;all?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. What necessity would there be? I shall soon be dead. I feel
  that my days are numbered, and then, save yourself, no one would know."</p>

  <p>"There have been strange instances of truth coming to light," I went on,
  half to myself. "There have been cases where, after many years, men have come
  from the dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There can be no such fear here," he interrupted. "You know that there
  cannot."</p>

  <p>It was a moment of bitter temptation to me. As in a dream, there passed
  before me the sad, sorrowful face of my mother, nursing her fierce grief in
  dreary solitude. What would happen to her if I were to play the part of
  honest man and blazon out this hideous secret? Alas! I knew. Her proud heart
  would break. And then I saw Marie's face, softened with love and tenderness,
  and with the mute reproach shining out of her bright eyes. Was not her
  happiness, too, at stake? And, last of all, I looked into the future, and I
  saw myself homeless, nameless, wretched, a wanderer upon the face of the
  earth, with no hope in the future, and no joy in the present&mdash;a
  self-wrecked outcast, to whom death alone could bring release. It was a
  fearful prospect!</p>

  <p>I sank down into a chair and covered my face with my hands. Soon he came
  and stood by my side, and began talking again in a low tone, nervous with
  eagerness, urging me to let him go back to Marie and tell her that all was
  well; begging me to go with him; pouring out a whole torrent of argument,
  little of which escaped my ears, for I was willing to hear and eager to be
  convinced. Yet even then, in that brief, agitated interview, it faintly
  dawned upon me that there was something strange, something beneath the
  surface, in the hysterical eagerness with which he piled argument upon
  argument in his frantic attempts to win me to his view of the case.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Feurget," I said to him suddenly, interrupting his stream of
  words, "do you think that as a father you are doing your duty to urge me like
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, almost fiercely. "Yes. If I were not as sure of the
  safety of what I am doing as I am of my own existence, you might have reason
  in asking that question. As it is, you have none. I seek my daughter's
  happiness. She loves you."</p>

  <p>"And God knows that I love her," I cried bitterly. "Monsieur de Feurget, I
  can give you no answer today; no, nor to-morrow. In three days I will have
  made up my mind. Farewell now."</p>

  <p>"In three days! Good!" he answered. "At the end of that time I shall
  expect to hear from you."</p>

  <p>Then he went away, and I was left alone.</p>

  <p>It was late when he departed&mdash;nearly midnight; but to attempt to get
  rest seemed like a mockery to me. My brain was in a whirl, and my mind in a
  state of chaos. But of all the thoughts that thronged in upon me, there was
  one which held its own always, and which seemed to throw a strange, sweet
  light upon all the others. She loved me. Was not that worth the world to
  me&mdash;worth far more than a quixotic scruple which would bring disgrace
  and misery on other heads than mine if I yielded to it?</p>

  <p>I stood by the open window, and I heard the midnight silence broken by the
  sound of wheels without feeling the curiosity to glance below. There was the
  noise and bustle of some one being admitted to the hotel, and presently there
  was a knocking at my door, which was quietly opened and shut. I moved from
  the recess into the room, and stood face to face with the intruder.</p>

  <p>At first I did not know him. I saw a tall, gaunt man with white beard and
  hair, with hollow cheeks and fevered eyes. When a moment later recognition
  did sweep in upon me, it brought with it an awed surprise.</p>

  <p>"Neillson," I cried, "is that you?"</p>

  <p>He was leaning upon the back of a chair, which his long, white fingers
  were grasping convulsively. His whole shrunken frame seemed quivering with
  agitation, and his breathing came in quick, uneven gasps. He tried twice to
  speak before he could command words.</p>

  <p>"The death certificate of&mdash;of Cecile Clanavon. Where&mdash;where is
  it?"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand eagerly, but I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"It was lost that night in the bay," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember where it was dated from?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. I had never looked.</p>

  <p>He sank down into the chair wringing his hands.</p>

  <p>"All in vain!" he muttered. "In vain&mdash;in vain!"</p>

  <p>I hurried to his side, but his eyes were closed, and a ghastly pallor
  crept into his face. He had fainted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-14"
     id="ch2-14">XIV.&mdash;FIRE AT THE CONVENT.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Every one who has passed through a period of great mental
  anguish will, at some time or other during it, have experienced the strong,
  impulsive desire to numb, if only for a very brief while, the acute agony by
  physical exhaustion. It swept in upon me with more than common force after
  Neillson's sudden arrival, and on the first day of the three for which I had
  bargained with Monsieur de Feurget. Nor was I long in yielding to it. Early
  in the morning I left the hotel, and setting my face inland I commenced to
  walk away from the fashionable little watering-place as though my one object
  in life was to get as far away from it as possible. By noon-time I must have
  travelled fifteen miles; and faint with heat and exhaustion and half choked
  with dust, I was glad to rest for a while in a way-side cottage and accept
  such timidly-proffered hospitality as its peasant occupants had to offer.</p>

  <p>When I was cool I offered them a coin, which I had much trouble to
  persuade them to accept, and stepped out again into the broad white road.</p>

  <p>Far away in front of me was a long line of dark hills, and after a
  moment's hesitation I set out toward them. The afternoon sun was blazing down
  upon me with a pitiless heat, and my feet sank noiselessly into a thick
  carpet of white dust. More than once I felt my temples throb and my head swim
  with the burning heat, but I walked steadily on, heedless of the pain. After
  what I had been suffering, this was nothing.</p>

  <p>As I approached the hills which I had vaguely fixed upon as my
  destination, their appearance became more inviting. Deep yellow cornfields
  were waving upon their slopes, empurpled with vineyards and plantations of
  broad-leafed, deep-greened trees, which seemed to my fevered limbs sweetly
  suggestive of coolness and shade. I could see no houses save one, a long,
  white building of irregular shape, half hidden by the trees which surrounded
  it. By its side was an older building, which I judged to be a chapel, and
  soon I was sure of it, for when, at last, I had reached the summit of the
  first of the hills, and had thrown myself down under the shade of a little
  knoll of rosy budded lime-trees, I heard the soft chiming of a bell, and
  almost immediately afterward a little procession of plainly-robed women
  passed two and two from the house into the chapel. Then the bell ceased and
  there was silence again.</p>

  <p>I drew a long sigh of contentment and stretched my tired limbs out upon
  the smooth turf. In some measure I had found what I had sought&mdash;peace.
  At my feet was the half-ruined old chapel, with its weather-beaten cross
  standing out vividly against the evening sky; and presently, from the open
  doors, there stole out the faint, sweet sound of women's voices chanting the
  Agnus Dei. It died away, and there was silence. Then more distinctly there
  floated up the strains of the evensong at the close of the service. I raised
  myself on my elbow to listen, and when at last it ceased I remained watching
  the dark figures issue slowly from the chapel, and, after a little hesitation
  and sauntering, as though to breathe in some of the sweetness of the evening,
  reenter the house. When the last one had gone, I leaned back again, but I
  still felt no inclination to move. The spot where I was had a charm for
  me.</p>

  <p>Slowly the brilliant streaks of color faded away, and the shades of
  twilight commenced to fall. A slight dampness hung about in the air, and
  below in the valley, and about the sides of the hills, white clouds of mist
  were slowly gathering. It was time for me to rise and go.</p>

  <p>Slowly I staggered up to my feet and stretched my tired limbs. I gazed
  steadfastly for a minute or two at the rugged cross, which was so placed that
  from where I was it stood always out in bold relief against the clear sky,
  and my thoughts dwelt for more than a minute on the little community of
  simple-minded, zealous women who had preferred the safety of seclusion, and
  the life of contemplation and reverence, to the thousand joys of the outside
  world. Then I glanced from the chapel to their abode, and my eyes, which had
  sought it carelessly enough, became suddenly fixed, and I felt my heart beat
  fast. What was that brilliant glow of red light in one of the high, painted
  windows? It might have been the last fierce glow of a summer sunset; but the
  sun had set long ago. No moon, no lamp, could give such a light. I watched it
  for a second, and then I gave a wild cry and leaped forward, with all memory
  of my weariness gone; for out of the window and up into the dark sky had shot
  a long forked flame, followed by a cloud of smoke. It was fire!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-15"
     id="ch2-15">XV.&mdash;A DESPERATE CLIMB.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In my college days I won more than one cup for cross-
  country running and hurdle-jumping, but I am very sure that I beat every
  previous record in my wild descent toward the burning house. The hedges that
  I could not clear I leaped through, and my feet seemed scarcely to touch the
  ground as I tore down the hill. But, notwithstanding my haste, long before I
  reached my destination the silent night was made hideous by the shriek of
  terrified women&mdash;some flying from the house, some standing helplessly at
  the window, wringing their hands and dazed with fear. It was an awful scene.
  The fire was on the second story, where, apparently, the sisters had been
  seated at their evening meal. Some had promptly rushed downstairs, and had
  got clear of the house altogether; others, slower or more timid, had delayed
  until the staircase had caught fire and it was too late. There they stood at
  the window, shrieking and convulsed with fear, some kneeling, some rushing
  wildly backward and forward seeking other means of escape, and behind them
  the dull red glow of the fast-approaching flames. I reached the shrubbery and
  bounded across the lawn. On the walk, his white hair streaming in the wind
  and the tears of impotent pity streaming down his face, was the old chaplain.
  I caught him by the shoulder and shook him in my excitement.</p>

  <p>"Is there no ladder?" I cried in French.</p>

  <p>"Ah, the ladder!" he exclaimed. "In the tool-house. This way! this
  way!"</p>

  <p>I hurried on before him to the shed. Leaning against it was a ladder of
  moderate length. With beating heart I reared it against the wall. Alas! it
  was fully a yard too short! A little cry of disappointment burst from the
  lips of the trembling little group.</p>

  <p>"Courage," I cried, "courage! Stand away from the window! I am coming to
  you!"</p>

  <p>There was a breathless silence. I ran up the ladder swiftly, and, poising
  myself for a moment on the topmost rung, stooped down and leaped through the
  window into the room.</p>

  <p>There was no time to lose, for the far wall of the long apartment was
  already in flames and the smoke and heat were stifling. I lifted the nearest
  of the little crowd of women by the arms and held her suspended out of the
  window until her feet touched the ladder. Then, hanging out of the casement,
  I gave her my hand until she had fairly commenced the descent, and directly
  she was out of my reach I turned for the next.</p>

  <p>One by one they were saved. Their behavior made a deep impression upon me.
  There was no struggling&mdash;no desire to push one in front of the other.
  They took their turn quietly, praying on their knees until it came, with
  half-closed eyes and calm faces lit up by the lurid flames which every moment
  drew nearer to them. The last was a slight child, who felt like a baby in my
  arms, and as she was stunned and dazed by the smoke and heat, I wrapped her
  arms around my neck and descended with her.</p>

  <p>It was a strange sight on the lawn. Many of the people from the
  neighborhood had arrived, but there was no fire engine nor any chance of any,
  and nothing could be done to quell the flames. There they all stood in little
  groups, the women, now that the danger was over, weeping and terrified at
  their strange position and the loss of their home. Suddenly there was a hush,
  followed by a deep, agitated murmur. Then one of the women suddenly caught
  hold of my arm and with the other pointed to the window of the room which
  they had just quitted.</p>

  <p>"Sister Agnes!" she cried. "Mother of Jesus, save her!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence, and then a succession of piercing,
  heart-breaking screams from the frenzied women. Every eye was riveted upon
  the window, my own included, and a thrill of horror passed through me.
  Standing perfectly still, her calm, sweet face, with its coils of gray hair,
  brilliantly illuminated by the rolling flames which were fast creeping toward
  her, was a tall, stately-looking woman, with her arms and face stretched up
  toward Heaven as though in silent prayer.</p>

  <p>They crowded around me, weeping, wringing their hands, and pouring out
  passionate appeals. They went on their knees, crying to me to save her, and
  like a flash I felt all the weariness and stiffness pass away from my limbs.
  I rushed toward the window, hastily reared the ladder, and ran up it. But,
  quick though I was, I was too late. When I stood on the topmost rung the
  flames leaped out, scorching my face and hair, and through the clouds of
  smoke I could see that the room was empty. I tried to leap through the
  casement, but the belching flames and thick volumes of smoke drove me back,
  dazed. Nevertheless, I should have tried again but for another cry below. I
  stole a quick glance downward. The lawn was studded with the kneeling figures
  of the sisters. Their eyes seemed turned all in one direction above my head.
  I descended swiftly, drew the ladder away from its dangerous position, and
  stood with them.</p>

  <p>I looked upward, and a cry burst from my lips. By some means she had
  reached the roof, and was standing there with one arm embracing the rugged
  stone cross and with the other stretched out toward us in an attitude of
  farewell. There was no fear, no shrinking, no signs of dread at the hideous
  fate which seemed about to enfold her. Nothing but perfect peace, perfect
  contentment. I felt a fierce resolve leap up within me, and my body seemed
  filled with fresh vigor and energy. Stand by and see her die I could not. But
  how to save her?</p>

  <p>I strode up to the huddled group of weeping women, and called sternly out
  to them.</p>

  <p>"I want a coil of rope," I said, speaking rapidly to the chaplain, who was
  standing by my side. "I saw one in the tool-shed."</p>

  <p>He hurried away and brought it to me. I tied one end round my body and
  made a slip-knot at the other. Then I reared the ladder against the extreme
  end of the blazing building and mounted it to the topmost rung.</p>

  <p>When I reached it I found myself still twenty feet from the roof. Turning
  round, I pulled up the rope; then, holding the slip-knot in my hand, I called
  out to the woman above.</p>

  <p>With a lingering reluctance, which made me quiver with impatience, she
  unlinked her arm from the cross and advanced to the edge of the roof. I stood
  up, holding the slip-knot in my hand, but when I sought to throw it to her
  and to speak, my tongue and arm alike seemed paralyzed. I forgot the ravenous
  flames which were roaring on toward us, blistering the skin upon my face and
  hands and bathing us both in a warm, rosy glow. I looked into her sad, calm
  face, full of a strange beauty, and I forgot all there. The face looking into
  mine was that of the woman whose photograph I had found in the keep at
  Clanavon Castle!</p>

  <p>Dizzy with the great shock, I reeled and almost fell. She saw it, and
  leaned over the stone parapet silent, but horrified. I recovered myself with
  a desperate effort, and our eyes met. Then I knew that she, too, recognized
  the likeness to a familiar face.</p>

  <p>I threw the slip-knot up, and it fell on the roof; but she made no motion
  to take it, nor did she remove her eyes from my face.</p>

  <p>"Take it," I cried, "quick!"</p>

  <p>She did not move. I cried to her again more imperatively than before.</p>

  <p>"Take it and fasten it to the cross."</p>

  <p>Still she did not speak or withdraw her wild, rapt gaze from my face. I
  loosened my hand and hung backward suspended in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you, or I will fall!" I cried. "I am here to save you. A
  moment's delay and we shall perish."</p>

  <p>She started backward when she saw my peril, and did as I had bade her.</p>

  <p>"Is it firm?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Leave me here!" she cried. "I wish to die."</p>

  <p>For answer I let my feet quit the ladder and hung suspended by the rope.
  Hand over hand I pulled myself up until I stood at last by her side.</p>

  <p>We stood side by side, struggling and gasping for breath in the heated
  atmosphere. In her face there was still that look of awed wonder, but it had
  softened now, and the horror had died away from it.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she whispered. "Tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have come to save you, Sister Agnes!" I cried. "Quick!"</p>

  <p>I undid the rope from my own body and wound it around hers. She sought to
  stop me, but I pushed her hands away.</p>

  <p>"I would rather die," she answered. "Leave me here and save yourself. But
  tell me, first, who you are."</p>

  <p>7</p>

  <p>SISTER AGNES. 229</p>

  <p>"I am Lord Alceston now," I answered, drawing her to the parapet, "but if
  you keep me here a moment longer I must bid my name good-by forever."</p>

  <p>I tightened the rope and let her down slowly from the parapet. Then I,
  too, climbed over the edge and let myself down.</p>

  <p>It was well that I was close behind her, for after a few trembling steps
  she reeled and would have fallen. At the foot of the ladder a hundred eager
  hands met us, and a great sobbing cry of joy and relief broke the intense
  stillness which had reigned among the watchers. I felt soft arms around my
  neck, and hot tears and kisses upon my hands as they crowded around us. But
  suddenly it all died away&mdash;the sound of their hysterical, shaking voices
  and the sight of their pale, eager, tearstained faces radiant with gratitude.
  Consciousness had left me like a flash, and the unnatural strength which had
  buoyed me up was gone. I had fainted like a woman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-16"
     id="ch2-16">XVI.&mdash;SISTER AGNES.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In this state I must have remained for many hours, for when
  I opened my eyes another sun was low down in the western sky. I was in a
  plain, bare bedchamber, with whitewashed walls and scantily furnished. The
  bed on which I was lying, however, was spotlessly clean, and by my side was a
  great bowl of sweet-smelling country flowers. Like a flash, the recollection
  of the previous night came to me&mdash;the fire, the perilous climbing, and
  the face of the woman whom they had called Sister Agnes.</p>

  <p>I tried to jump out of bed, and made the discovery that my limbs were
  still stiff and sore, and that there were poultices on various parts of my
  body.</p>

  <p>I lay down again and closed my eyes. Scarcely had I done so when the door
  of the room wag carefully opened and footsteps crossed the room to my side.
  There was a little hesitation, then a soft, white hand passed over my
  forehead with a gentle, caressing touch, lingering there for a moment or two
  and repeating the action. Presently I heard something which sounded like a
  stifled sob, and, slowly opening my eyes, I saw the bowed figure of a
  black-robed sister kneeling by my bedside. I started; she raised her head,
  and I looked into the face of Sister Agnes.</p>

  <p>She rose at once and stood by my bedside. All trace of emotion had
  vanished as if by magic from her white, passionless face.</p>

  <p>"You are better, my son?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If I have been ill, yes," I answered. "I feel a little stiff and sore,
  that is all. I have slept long?"</p>

  <p>"All day, and sorely you must have needed it," she said. "My son, there
  are many helpless women who owe you their lives, I among them."</p>

  <p>"You were not very anxious to be saved," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I was ready to die or to live, as was God's will," she answered. "Nay, I
  think that I am glad to have been spared, for those whom I have loved and
  watched over need me now in their distress more than ever. Yes, I am glad to
  be alive, and I thank you, my 'son."</p>

  <p>"Sister Agnes," I said, "your face is one which I have seen before."</p>

  <p>"Never," she answered calmly.</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I have seen its picture," I continued. "You have not always been
  known as Sister Agnes."</p>

  <p>"My other self is dead," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Dead it may be in one sense," I answered; "but still it is alive. Sister
  Agnes, if ever you were known as Cecile d'Augerville tell me so quickly! It
  is more to me than you can imagine."</p>

  <p>"That was my name," she answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"Then why did you lead my father to suppose you dead, and let him marry
  again? Cannot you see the wrong you have done, Sister Agnes? I am the son of
  Lord Alceston, but I have no right now to his name. The fault is yours, and
  on your head lies the blame of my infamy," I added bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" She pressed her hand to her cold temples, and the saint-like calm
  died out of her face. She was agitated, but not as I had expected to see
  her.</p>

  <p>"Your father&mdash;is he alive?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He is dead," I answered, steeling my heart against her, and vowing to
  myself that I would not spare her; and then, like a flash, I remembered how
  this strange discovery upset every theory of his death. Who now was the woman
  whom he had gone to visit secretly? Where was now the motive of his
  self-destruction? Gone! The whole theory was destroyed. Once more everything
  was in a hopeless maze.</p>

  <p>"Dead! Dead! Ah me! Dead!"</p>

  <p>The words seemed to glide out of her lips almost unconsciously. I looked
  at her, wondering, and my wonder had something of reverence in it. Was this
  the face of an erring, sinful woman, a woman to scheme and plan for an
  earthly vengeance? It seemed&mdash;nay, I knew that it was&mdash;impossible,
  and the harsh words which I would have uttered died away upon my lips.</p>

  <p>In their place came a sort of awe, largely mingled with pity. I knew that
  I was looking upon a woman who had fulfilled very nearly, if not altogether,
  the ideal of her order. Asceticism, unselfishness, devotion had been the
  steps of the ladder by which she had attained to a spirituality so marked and
  evident that it seemed diffused from her very person, and gave her a strange,
  sweet influence over her fellow-creatures&mdash;an influence which I, too,
  felt.</p>

  <p>Soon she came softly to my bedside and sank down upon her knees. Then,
  with her face turned at first a little away from me, she commenced to speak
  in a low, sweet tone, full of deep humility. Before she had uttered many
  words her hand sought mine, and my fingers had clasped it. If this woman had
  done me any wrong she was already forgiven. I was powerless even to feel
  resentment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-17"
     id="ch2-17">XVII.&mdash;WHO WAS THE WOMAN?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"My son," she said softly, "it is a strange fate which has
  brought you hither to me. I had thought that never in this world should I
  have to reopen the sealed chapters of my life, and to think and speak of that
  time when I was one of the outside world, a lover of its pleasures, and,
  alas! a very guilty woman. Year after year the memory of that time has grown
  fainter and fainter. Earthly love has almost died away from within me, and I
  can look into your face almost without emotion, though it reminds me so much
  of his.</p>

  <p>"I loved your father, my son&mdash;loved him as women still love men, I
  suppose, in the world from which I have passed forever. He loved me, too; but
  I was never worthy of his love. He knew nothing of it; but I was not what he
  thought me.</p>

  <p>"It was at St. Marien, near here, where we were living&mdash;my father, my
  sister, and I&mdash;that I first knew him. He was young and handsome and
  noble, and from the first moment when he began to whisper words of love to me
  he hinted at marriage, and when he spoke openly and told me of his love he
  asked me boldly to become his wife. He never knew why I hesitated so long. He
  never knew why I lay awake night after night filled with bitter regrets,
  wondering whether I dare marry him, tempted of the devil to do so, yet
  fearful. In the end the temptation was too strong, and I yielded. I kept a
  hideous secret locked in my heart, and stood by his side at the altar while
  the priest joined our hands and called us man and wife. Yes, I was married to
  your father."</p>

  <p>She had told me so before, and yet somehow I had clung to some faint hope,
  which her words destroyed. I felt my heart sink, and I would have withdrawn
  my hand from hers. But she held my fingers tightly.</p>

  <p>"Nay, but listen, my son," she continued. "I say that I was married to
  him; and yet it was no marriage."</p>

  <p>"No marriage! What do you mean?" I cried. "I have seen a copy of the
  certificate."</p>

  <p>"And so you may again, my son," she said, bowing her head. "And yet it was
  no marriage, for I was already married."</p>

  <p>I felt quite powerless to say anything.</p>

  <p>"You wonder that I can tell you of my shame like this," she said softly.
  "Ah, my son, for twenty years and more I have done unceasing penance, and the
  old life, with its sins and guilt, has passed away from me. Our Blessed
  Mother has heard my prayers, and Sister Agnes can talk calmly of Cecile
  d'Augerville's sins. Let me go on with my story.</p>

  <p>"At least I have one excuse for what I did. I believed my husband dead. We
  had been married secretly, almost directly I had left the convent; but he was
  a soldier and had been obliged to leave me immediately after our marriage. I
  was only a 'girl, scarcely seventeen years old, when I married him, and the
  romantic fancy which I had thought love soon passed away. I had never dared
  tell my father, for he was poor, and I knew that his great hope was that
  Marie and I would marry rich husbands. So I left it until he should return
  from the war; and he did not return. Instead, there came rumors of his death,
  and, foolishly, I accepted them unquestioningly. Then your father came, and
  for the first time I knew what love was. When he asked me to marry him I
  consented, telling him nothing of my past lest he should give me up, and
  trusting implicitly to the vague rumors which had reached me of my husband's
  death. We were married secretly, and the vengeance of Heaven was swift. In
  less than a week your father killed mine in a duel, and I had received a
  message from my first husband, who was still alive and desired me to join
  him.</p>

  <p>"I fled from home on that awful night, intending to end my days by my own
  hand. From such a crime, however, I was spared. I passed through a sweet
  country town, and some wild impulse led me to enter the cathedral. For the
  first time religion became a reality to me. I confessed, and after much
  penance I was admitted a sister of the lowest order at the house, which is
  now, alas! no more. Step by step I worked myself up until at the death of the
  Superioress they chose me to take her place. From the moment of my entrance
  here I determined to write myself down as dead to the world. I sent a
  certificate of my death to your father, and to my friends. I aimed at entire
  and absolute detachment from every thought and affection of earthly origin.
  What strange providence has brought you here to make me reopen for the last
  time my other life I cannot tell. Yet it has come to pass, and I have told
  you all. Now I must go. But before I go accept my blessing. We shall all pray
  for you often, for many owe you their lives. Farewell."</p>

  <p>"One word!" I cried. "Sister Agnes&mdash;I will forget that you ever had
  another name&mdash;I must ask you a question."</p>

  <p>"Ask it, then."</p>

  <p>"When my father lay dead there was found upon his arm a gold
  bracelet."</p>

  <p>"And when I die," she said, "there will be found one upon my arm. I have
  told you my story from the very worst point of view, seeking to extenuate
  nothing. But I had what seemed to me then to be some excuse for my wicked
  deceit. I loved your father with a passionate, overwhelming love, and though
  I never think of that time now, that bracelet will never leave my arm.
  See!"</p>

  <p>She raised her long sleeve, and I saw the dull band of gold.</p>

  <p>"There has been a foul plot!" I cried. "Listen for one minute, Sister
  Agnes, while I tell you of my father's death."</p>

  <p>She sat down upon the bed and folded her hands.</p>

  <p>"He was a brave, good man, your father," she said softly. "If he is dead
  he is happy, even though he was not of our Church."</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you of his death!" I cried, with a shudder. "Late one night,
  while he was receiving his guests, a note was brought to him. He made some
  excuse and hurried away from his house to a lodging-place at the east end of
  London. There we know that he visited a woman who must have had some strong
  claim upon him. He returned to his guests, fulfilled all his duties, and on
  their departure, he went to his study. On the morrow he was found
  there&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>"It was very sudden," she said. "Let us pray that he had made his peace
  with God."</p>

  <p>"Ay, it was sudden," I continued; "but I have not told you all. He died no
  natural death."</p>

  <p>"No natural death?" she repeated wonderingly. "He did not destroy
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"Either that or he was murdered," I answered; "and God alone knows which.
  But listen. On that same morning the woman whom he had visited was found
  murdered!"</p>

  <p>"Holy Mother!" she whispered, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"The only clew we had to the mystery was this," I added, leaning toward
  her. "On the right arm of the murdered woman was found a gold bracelet, and
  on his was also one like it."</p>

  <p>Again she was a woman, her gray eyes full of mingled horror and
  bewilderment and her cheeks blanched.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me that it was my place to solve this mystery," I continued.
  "I commenced my task by searching through my father's private papers, and
  from them I learned of his marriage to you. From Neillson, my father's
  servant, I learned of the bracelets which you and he wore. Can you wonder
  what everything seemed to lead to? My mother, Neillson, and myself, at
  separate times, and by different courses, arrived at the same conclusion. We
  decided that the woman at whose summons he had left his guests and gone at a
  moment's notice in the dead of night to the slums of London must be his
  lawful wife come back from the dead. Of her death, after his visit, and of
  his that same night, not one of us dared to think. And yet it has haunted me,
  has haunted all of us day and night since that awful discovery. My mother is
  dying of a broken heart; Neillson is almost a madman; and I am a wanderer on
  the face of the earth, and now either I am dreaming or our agony has been in
  vain. My God! I think I am going mad! Sister Agnes, if you are the woman whom
  he thought his wife, who was she who was murdered in London, with the
  bracelet upon her arm, and what was she to my father? If you cannot tell me I
  shall go mad!"</p>

  <p>She stood up on the floor with her hands pressed to her temples and her
  eyes full of a terrible light, swaying herself gently backward and forward.
  Then with a cry, awful beyond all expression, she sank down upon the ground a
  lifeless heap.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-18"
     id="ch2-18">XVIII.&mdash;A JOURNEY.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I sprang from my couch and hastened to her side. I hurried
  on my clothes and cried aloud for help. The farmer's wife, who was our
  temporary hostess, came clattering upstairs in her huge sabots, and after her
  came one of the other sisters.</p>

  <p>"Sister Agnes has fainted," I explained, as they opened the door. "What
  can we do for her? Have you brandy?"</p>

  <p>They hastened to her side, and applied many restoratives, of which I knew
  nothing, but for a long time without effect.</p>

  <p>"I must fetch a doctor!" I cried.. "Where can I find one?"</p>

  <p>The sister took out her watch.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Leneuill will be here in a few minutes to see you, monsieur," she
  remarked. "Better wait for him. Will monsieur lift her on to the bed?"</p>

  <p>I did so, and by and by the signs of life began slowly to reappear. The
  sister looked at me doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur will pardon me," she said, "but if our dear sister's sudden
  illness had anything to do with him, would it not be better for him to retire
  for a while, that she may not see him when she first opens her eyes? If
  monsieur does not mind?"</p>

  <p>I turned away and left the room.</p>

  <p>After a while our hostess came down with the news that Sister Agnes had
  recovered and was asking for me.</p>

  <p>I went upstairs at once, and when I stood by her side, I was shocked to
  see the change which a few hours had made in her appearance. She beckoned me
  close to her side.</p>

  <p>"Ask me no questions," she said hoarsely, grasping my coat-sleeve with her
  thin, nervous fingers. "Ask me no questions, but get ready to go a journey
  with me to-morrow. You will?"</p>

  <p>"I will, Sister Agnes," I answered softly. "Wherever you choose to take
  me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-19"
     id="ch2-19">XIX.&mdash;M. DE FEURGET DESIRES A SON-IN-LAW.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Three days&mdash;three long, dreary days&mdash;and no news
  of Bernard. He has not been to see me, he has not even sent a message. What
  can it mean&mdash;this silence? Were those few minutes on the balcony only a
  sweet dream, a vision, a freak of the imagination? How idle to ask it! Are
  not my lips still burning with the fire of that long kiss, and are not his
  passionate words still ringing in my ears? I cannot even think of him without
  feeling again some faint remembrance of that exquisite thrill of happiness
  which passed through me like lightning when I knew that he loved me and I
  felt myself clasped for one short moment in his arms.</p>

  <p>Something must have happened to him! I know it. He would never leave me
  like this without a word or a message after what has passed between us.</p>

  <p>Our little household is quite disorganized. Not only am I in a state of
  mind bordering upon distraction, but there is something more than usually
  strange about my father's behavior, also. Strange to say, too, his
  disquietude seems to proceed from the same cause as mine&mdash;Lord
  Alceston's disappearance. I am more than convinced that the secret
  trouble&mdash;which seems to be wearing out his life, and of which I dare not
  speak to him&mdash;is in some way connected with Bernard's appearance here. I
  know that he has been going down to the hotel where Bernard stayed,
  continually trying to find him; but, alas! he has never succeeded! What does
  he want with him? He can know nothing yet...</p>

  <p>My father has just returned from another fruitless visit to the hotel, and
  he has brought with him an old man, a servant of Lord Alceston, who has just
  come from England to him. They went straight into the library, and were
  talking together for a long time. Then I went down to see if there was any
  news, for I could bear the suspense no longer. He has no news; he can tell us
  nothing. It seems Bernard left the hotel suddenly, without saying where he
  was going, three days ago...</p>

  <p>Mr. Carlyon called yesterday, and as he saw me at the window and came
  straight in I was compelled to see him, though I could scarcely keep still
  for nervousness. He knows no more than any of us what has become of his
  cousin.</p>

  <p>"Bernard's all right," he declared. "He knows how to take care of himself;
  and, besides, he's awfully fond of these mysterious disappearances. Goes in
  for them regularly, you know, when he's bored, and saves all the bother of
  saying good-by."</p>

  <p>Was he bored here, I wonder? I think not. I had a great mind to tell Mr.
  Carlyon, but he looked so moody and different from his usual self that I
  scarcely liked to. And then, perhaps, Bernard would not have liked it...</p>

  <p>My father knows everything. I could not help telling him. He came in
  softly when I was&mdash;in tears, I am afraid; and he asked me so kindly and
  yet so eagerly that I could keep it to myself no longer.</p>

  <p>When I had told him I felt better. For a long time he made no remark; it
  seemed almost as if my story had fallen upon deaf ears. But I knew that it
  was not so. "<i>Mon père</i>, you are not angry?" I said after a while. "This
  does not displease you?"</p>

  <p>"Angry!" He stopped opposite my chair, and his voice was shaking with
  feverish emotion. "Marie, nothing else in the world would be so welcome to me
  as this. Nothing else could bring me so much peace. God grant that it may
  come to pass!"</p>

  <p>I looked at him wonderingly. It was a rare thing to see him so much moved.
  What could it mean?</p>

  <p>"Are you so anxious, then, to get rid of me, <i>mon père</i>?" I asked
  falteringly.</p>

  <p>"It is not that, child!" he cried, with a sudden vigor in his tone. "I owe
  Lord Alceston a debt which I can never pay. I have sinned against him, and my
  hand cannot undo what it has done. Through you alone can I make reparation.
  Remember this, and if he comes for you, be a good wife to him all your life,
  and your father will bless you."</p>

  <p>"Does he know of this debt?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not now; but he will know. When I die he will know, and that will be
  soon&mdash;very soon."</p>

  <p>He turned away and left me without another word.</p>

  <p>In about an hour's time he sent for me again into the library. I went
  hurriedly, hoping to hear news of Bernard. But he never even mentioned his
  name, nor did he refer to his strange words to me in our recent conversation.
  He commenced talking calmly about something else.</p>

  <p>"You remember what I told you about M. d'Aubron and Mr. Carlyon on the
  night of their first visit here?" he said.</p>

  <p>I nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"About M. d'Aubron playing cards so much, and being a bad companion for
  Mr. Carlyon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Well, I find that I was right. Things have turned out very much as I
  expected. Carlyon has been led on by D'Aubron to play cards night after
  night, giving I.O.U. s always in payment&mdash;for, of course, poor Carlyon
  always lost after the first night or two. Now the crisis has come. M.
  d'Aubron has dropped some pretty plain hints that he would like some of the
  I.O.U.s taken up, and Carlyon, who has already considerably exceeded his
  allowance, is almost beside himself. I heard about it at the Casino
  reading-room this morning, and I went to see Carlyon at once."</p>

  <p>"What has Mr. Brown been doing?" I asked. "He is supposed to be looking
  after Mr. Carlyon, is he not?"</p>

  <p>"That is one of the worst features of the whole matter. Mr. Brown himself
  has been led on to play by that artful scoundrel, and he himself is deeply
  involved. In fact, both he and Carlyon are ruined unless something can be
  done."</p>

  <p>I remember how pale and <i>distrait</i> Arthur Carlyon had seemed, and I
  felt a moment's remorse for the selfishness of my own grief.</p>

  <p>"Can nothing be done?" I asked. "That D'Aubron ought to be punished."</p>

  <p>"There is just one hope," my father continued thoughtfully. "I remember
  many years ago a somewhat similar case, of which I was a witness, and which
  has given me an idea with regard to Carlyon's trouble."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that M. d'Aubron has played fairly?" I asked.</p>

  <p>My father looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say; but I am going to try and find out."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"They are both coming here this evening, and after I had asked D'Aubron I
  said that I feared he had found it dull on his previous visit, and told him
  that if he cared to bring a pack of cards up with him we might have a quiet
  hand of whist. He fell in with it at once, and I have no doubt that he will
  do so. I shall watch the game closely, and, of course, if I see the slightest
  sign of unfair play I shall know how to act."</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Carlyon know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course I told him. A most unsuspecting boy he is! D'Aubron has
  made a complete fool of him. When I suggested this thing at first, he was
  quite indignant. Even now that he has consented to it, he laughs at the idea
  of there being any unfairness in D'Aubron's play. But we shall see."...</p>

  <p>M. d'Aubron, Mr. Carlyon, and Mr. Brown have arrived together. I have
  pleaded indisposition, and have seen nothing of them. I could not bear
  it.</p>

  <p>They have finished dinner, and I can hear their voices in the library. How
  loudly they are all talking, even my father, and his voice is usually so low.
  Now they are quieter. I suppose that they have begun to play cards.</p>

  <p>I am going to my room to try and sleep. I am afraid that it will be no
  use, for my temples are burning and my brain seems on fire. Will he come
  to-night, I wonder? Good-night, Bernard, my love, good-night! If I may not
  call you by your name I can at least write it! Good-night, my love!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-20"
     id="ch2-20">XX.&mdash;NEILLSON IS SUSPICIOUS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mystery seems only to lead on to mystery. I am in a hopeless
  maze, groping about in vain for a clew. I have discovered strange things, but
  they are like an unpieced puzzle in my hands. I cannot put them together. I
  cannot see to what they lead.</p>

  <p>Who was the woman who ordered that bracelet at M. Rouzet's, in Paris? What
  was her object? And how did she know where the former ones had been made? I
  can see only one step before me&mdash;to verify the death certificate of
  Mlle. Cecile. True, she herself has confessed it to be forged; still it would
  be a satisfaction to discover by what means she obtained it.</p>

  <p>On leaving Paris I came straight here in search of my master, not doubting
  but that he had with him the certificate. How changed I must be! At first he
  did not know me. Can I wonder at it when I look in the glass and see my
  wrinkled face and snow-white hair?</p>

  <p>The sudden shock of seeing my poor young master again so much altered, and
  the disappointment of hearing that the certificate was irretrievably lost,
  made me feel dizzy and faint for a while. When I came to myself he had gone,
  and left only a hastily scrawled line or two for me, saying that he would be
  away no longer than three days and that I was to wait here for him.</p>

  <p>A strange thing has happened. A visitor has just called to see my master,
  and has been referred to me. I was walking up and down the room when he
  entered. I looked up and saw M. de Feurget!</p>

  <p>"Neillson!" he exclaimed in a low, disturbed tone. "You here, and with
  Lord Alceston?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur," I answered simply.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You thought that I was in hiding," I interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Has any one else been accused? I understood that there was a
  warrant."</p>

  <p>"There was. There is now, I suppose. But I have convinced my master of my
  innocence, and I am not afraid of capture. You will not betray me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not; of course I shall not. It is no business of mine."</p>

  <p>I gather from M. de Feurget's appearance that he has grown old before his
  time and that he is in ill-health. He is evidently very nervous, for this
  sudden meeting with me seems to have upset him completely. He looks at me in
  a strange, dazed sort of way, as though he were afraid of me, and I can see
  his limbs shaking. Why should my presence have such an effect upon him?</p>

  <p>He stayed for more than an hour, talking aimlessly and looking often
  toward the door as though he hoped my master would come. When he rose to go
  he professed to take pity upon my loneliness and ill-health and offered to
  take me with him to his home. I was on the point of refusing when I changed
  my mind. I did not understand M. de Feurget's agitation at seeing me, or his
  anxiety to see my master. Recent events have made me suspicious. What I do
  not understand I suspect. I decided to go with M. de Feurget.</p>

  <p>When we arrived at M. de Feurget's villa I had a shock. It was the old
  home of M. d'Augerville and his daughters, which, alas! I had known so
  well.</p>

  <p>There was another surprise for me. We met his daughter in the garden, and
  when I saw her I had to stop and gasp for breath. She was so like Mlle.
  Cecile that at first I thought that it was all a dream&mdash;a nightmare. But
  it was no dream, and when she smiled I saw that this young lady was
  sweeter-looking even than Mlle. Cecile&mdash;more English-like. Then it all
  came to me like a flash. I remembered that M. de Feurget had been engaged to
  marry Mlle. Cecile's sister Marie. I asked after her, and he answered me
  strangely, almost roughly. She was dead, he said. I dare say that it was not
  a very happy marriage. Once or twice it occurred to me in those days that she
  seemed to care more for my master than for this man. Perhaps it was so. It
  was not a happy marriage. He looks as though he had known nothing but trouble
  all his life.</p>

  <p>His interest in my master is strange. He asked me many questions about
  him, curious questions, too, and he has tried to get me to talk about that
  night; but I cannot.</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget's manner seemed to me to grow more and more mysterious. He
  was like a man with a secret&mdash;as though he had some fierce trouble
  hanging always over him. There is another thing which perplexes me. He keeps
  recurring to that awful subject, although I beg him not to talk of it. It
  seems to possess a sort of morbid fascination for him. It is very
  strange.</p>

  <p>Toward evening some gentlemen arrived, dressed for dinner, and my host had
  to leave me for a time. While he was engaged with them I slipped quietly away
  and hurried down to the hotel to inquire about my master. He had not
  returned, nor had anything been heard of him. I had made up my mind that as
  M. de Feurget had guests I would stay at the hotel and not return to the
  villa that night. But when I tried to settle down there I found it
  impossible. I was restless and ill at ease. Some vague instinct&mdash;a sense
  that something was happening there&mdash;kept my thoughts fixed upon M. de
  Feurget and the villa upon the cliffs. Constantly I felt urged to return at
  once, and at last I yielded. I slipped quietly out of the hotel, for it was
  late&mdash;past midnight&mdash;and made my way up the winding path bordered
  with rhododendrons to the villa.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-21"
     id="ch2-21">XXI.&mdash;M. D'AUBRON AT BAY.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I entered the grounds of M. de Feurget's villa by a small
  private gate which had been left, by some chance, unopened. The greater part
  of the house seemed wrapped in darkness, but the light was streaming out from
  the room on the ground-floor which M. de Feurget had shown me as his library,
  and the French windows were standing half open.</p>

  <p>To act, the spy seems a mean part, but the end which I had in view was of
  sufficient magnitude to obscure all such considerations. I could have given
  no real reason why I connected M. de Feurget in my mind with that end, but
  somehow his mysterious manner and mode of questioning me had filled we with
  vague suspicion.</p>

  <p>I crossed the lawn softly and took up a position behind a shrub, from
  which I could see into the room. There were four men there&mdash;M. de
  Feurget himself, Mr. Carlyon and his tutor, Mr. Brown&mdash;seated round a
  table; but just as I arrived they all rose, leaving several packs of cards
  scattered carelessly about all over it. To judge from their faces something
  had happened. There was the young English gentleman, Mr. Carlyon, sitting
  apart with his hands in his pockets, and a very ill-assumed look of
  indifference on his white face. There was the older gentleman making no
  effort at all to conceal his dismay, M. d'Aubron leisurely smoking a
  cigarette and looking quite cool, but a little exultant; and, lastly, there
  was M. de Feurget sitting by himself a little apart, with a curious look upon
  his face which I could not quite understand. He was the first to break a
  silence which seemed as though it had been a somewhat prolonged one, and by
  his manner I guessed that something was going to happen.</p>

  <p>I saw M. de Feurget throw away a cigarette and advance to the table.</p>

  <p>"Any one interested in card tricks?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;n card tricks!" muttered young Mr. Carlyon savagely. "I beg your
  pardon, M. de Feurget," he added, looking a little ashamed of himself. "I
  didn't mean to be rude; but it was rather an unfortunate question, wasn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>No one else had taken any notice of the question. M. de Feurget nodded
  sympathetically to Mr. Carlyon, and then drawing his chair close to the
  table, he leaned over it and collected a pack of cards in his hands. M.
  d'Aubron looked at him curiously, and I thought seemed a little
  disturbed.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said suddenly, in an altered tone&mdash;so altered,
  indeed, that every one looked at him immediately&mdash;"will you kindly give
  me your attention for a minute or two?"</p>

  <p>Every one's eyes were riveted upon him. M. d'Aubron, who was sitting just
  opposite, seemed to me to turn a shade paler, and the long, white fingers
  which held his cigarette were certainly shaking.</p>

  <p>"We have all been heavy losers to=night, I believe, except M. d'Aubron,"
  he continued. "That is so, is it not?"</p>

  <p>There was a vigorous assent from Mr. Brown, and a slight, weary nod from
  Mr. Carlyon. M. d'Aubron shrugged his shoulders uneasily.</p>

  <p>"<i>La fortune de la guerre</i>," he remarked, with an attempt at levity
  in his tone. "Your turn to-day&mdash;mine to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I think not," M. de Feurget replied quietly.</p>

  <p>M. d'Aubron looked up quickly, and turned a frowning face toward his
  host.</p>

  <p>"I do not quite understand that remark, monsieur," he said haughtily.</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"No? I will endeavor to explain it, then. One might play with you, M.
  d'Aubron, for a very considerable time&mdash;with these cards&mdash;and the
  fortune of war, as you call it, would not change."</p>

  <p>M. d'Aubron maintained his composure admirably, but he was very pale. Mr.
  Brown and Mr. Carlyon had drawn a little nearer to the table and were
  listening with bated breaths.</p>

  <p>"At the risk of your finding me very dull, monsieur, I must still confess
  that I fail to understand you," M. d'Aubron declared in a clear, unshaken
  tone.</p>

  <p>"I will be still more explicit, then," was the calm reply. "It is
  necessary! You hold, I believe, Mr. Carlyon's I.O.U.s for forty-eight
  thousand francs and Mr. Brown's for nearly six thousand."</p>

  <p>"I do not remember the amounts; but if I do, what of it? How does it
  concern you?"</p>

  <p>"You also claim to have won from me to-night," M. de Feurget continued,
  disregarding the interruption, "about four thousand francs, of which I have
  given you a memorandum. I have to request you to tear those documents up at
  once."</p>

  <p>An electric start of surprise ran through the little circle. M. d'Aubron
  rose from his chair livid with rage.</p>

  <p>"M. de Feurget," he exclaimed in a low tone, shaking with passion, "if
  this is a joke on your part you are carrying it a little too far, let me tell
  you. What the devil do you mean to insinuate?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I mean to insinuate nothing," was the quiet reply. "I prefer a
  plainer mode of making myself understood both by you and by your victims.
  These cards which I hold in my hand, brought here so kindly by you in case I
  might be ill-provided, are marked cards, every one of them! You are a
  swindler, and you know it!"</p>

  <p>An awful spasm passed across M. d'Aubron's face, and the coldness of
  demeanor which he had hitherto preserved left him suddenly.</p>

  <p>"It's a d&mdash;d lie!" he cried in a low, choking tone. "It's a
  conspiracy between you three to get out of paying your debts. Give me the
  cards."</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hand, but M. de Feurget shook his head and passed
  them quickly behind his back to Mr. Brown.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brown," he said, "be so good as to examine the pattern on the back of
  these cards on the top right-hand corner."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown and Mr. Carlyon both bent eagerly over them.</p>

  <p>"They are most certainly marked," the former declared, his voice shaking
  with excitement. "The suit and quality of the card are reproduced in
  miniature among the pattern. The idea is ingenious, but most palpable."</p>

  <p>"And if they are, how dare you suppose that I know anything about it?" M.
  d'Aubron exclaimed, making great efforts to assume a dignified position. "The
  cards have been changed&mdash;very likely by one of you," he added
  insolently.</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget rose from his chair quite calm, and pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"In the face of your winnings, M. d'Aubron, and&mdash;forgive
  me&mdash;your past reputation, any doubt as to your guilt is quite out of the
  question. You will oblige me by leaving this house and the neighborhood at
  once. In fact, if you remain in the vicinity another twenty-four hours,
  to-night's event shall be published in the Casino. Go!"</p>

  <p>"I deny what you impute to me altogether, and I stand upon my rights as a
  nobleman and a gentleman!" M. d'Aubron declared in a low, passionate tone.
  "Your accusation is an insult, and I demand satisfaction for it!"</p>

  <p>"You shall have the satisfaction of being kicked out of this house by my
  servants if you do not take yourself off at once!" was the quiet reply.</p>

  <p>Quick as lightning M. d'Aubron leaned across the table and struck his
  accuser across the mouth. M. de Feurget, wholly unprepared for the blow,
  reeled back and nearly fell. But M. d'Aubron's triumph was a short one. He
  had scarcely recovered his position when Mr. Carlyon, who had leaped up
  immediately he had seen the threatened blow, quietly knocked him down with a
  thorough British left-hander.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet slowly and wiped the blood from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Carlyon, you at least shall answer to me for this," he said.</p>

  <p>"When you please," was the fierce reply. "You're a d&mdash;d scoundrel,
  D'Aubron, and a coward, too, to strike a blow like that; but I'll fight
  you."</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget turned suddenly round. "I have changed my mind," he said
  quickly. "M. d'Aubron, I claim the prior right."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it," was the low, stifled reply. "The sooner the
  better."</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget came slowly to the window and looked out.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you, M. d'Aubron," he said. "The sooner the better. What do
  you say to now? The light is only indifferent, it is true, but the
  disadvantage will be mutual. I can find a quiet spot and provide weapons. Mr.
  Brown will not object to be your second, I dare say, under the
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"The present time will suit me admirably," M. d'Aubron answered eagerly.
  "Will Mr. Brown do me the favor?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brown rose with a dignity for which one could never have given him
  credit. I looked at him in surprise, scarcely recognizing him.</p>

  <p>"I most emphatically decline to be associated with M. d'Aubron in any
  manner whatever," he answered coldly. "Apart from that, I will be no party in
  anything so antagonistic to my principles as a duel; and, further, even were
  I a fighting man I would decline having anything to do in so preposterous an
  affair as a duel between a gentleman&mdash;a man of honor&mdash;and a
  swindler."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary silence. M. d'Aubron seemed for a moment to be on
  the point of striking the speaker. With a great effort, however, he
  restrained himself, and turned away, shaking with passion.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence," he said. "I have a friend in St. Marien whom a
  summons from me would bring here at once. If one of M. de Feurget's servants
  could take a note from me?"</p>

  <p>M. de Feurget bowed.</p>

  <p>He addressed the note, and it was despatched.</p>

  <p>"In the absence of a second, M. de Feurget," he said, "may I waive the
  ceremony, and inquire from you what weapons you choose?"</p>

  <p>"I am indifferent, but I prefer swords," M. de Feurget declared.</p>

  <p>I saw an evil smile light up M. d'Aubron's face as he turned away. Then
  they all came out together on to the lawn, close to where I stood, so that I
  held my breath for fear of being discovered, though indeed my hiding-place
  was secure enough.</p>

  <p>"It will be dawn in an hour," M. de Feurget remarked, looking steadily
  toward the east. "Perhaps it is as well that we have to wait. What do you
  say, gentlemen, to some coffee? and in the mean time I will ask you to excuse
  me for a few minutes. I have a letter to write."</p>

  <p>There were silent murmurs of assent, and the four men stepped back again
  into the library.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-22"
     id="ch2-22">XXII.&mdash;THE BEGINNING OF THE END:<br>
  RISEN FROM THE DEAD.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Not for the first time in the world's history it seemed as
  though one of the fairest spots on earth had been chosen for a scene of
  blood. Close to the edge of the cliff, and separated from the villa by a
  thick plantation of pine trees, was a smooth plateau of springy, green turf,
  shut off on one side by the sea, and only accessible from the grounds by a
  winding path through the plantation. The freshest of morning breezes was
  bending the dark tops of the slim, graceful pine trees. It was the most
  exhilarating period of the whole day. Night had passed away, but morning had
  barely come.</p>

  <p>Standing on the very edge of the cliff, bareheaded, with his white hair
  flowing in the breeze, stood M. de Feurget. He was in his shirt and trousers
  only, and he was leaning slightly on a long, bare sword. He looked very
  unlike a man about to fight for his life; more, indeed, as though he had just
  come unscathed and triumphant through some fierce ordeal.</p>

  <p>Some slight noise which I made in changing my position attracted his
  notice, and he turned round and saw me.</p>

  <p>"Neillson!" he cried. "You here! Has your master returned?" he added
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "I have but lately come from the hotel, sir," I said.
  "Nothing has been heard of him."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" He turned away from me, and a shade of disappointment passed over
  his face. I felt that I must speak, if only to arrest the current of his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"It's a beautiful sunrise, sir," I remarked, scarcely knowing what I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Ay, Neillson, it is," he answered. "A beautiful sunrise. I shall see it
  set from another world, please God," he added softly.</p>

  <p>"You are going to fight a duel, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I am. A duel to the death," he said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Fetch my coat here, Neillson," he went on. "That's right. Feel in that
  pocket and take out a letter."</p>

  <p>I did so. It was addressed to my master.</p>

  <p>"Neillson, when I am dead, as I shall be when the sun comes up from behind
  those clouds, I lay a charge upon you&mdash;a solemn charge. You must find
  your master&mdash;I care not where he is&mdash;you must find him, and give
  him that letter. Do you promise?"</p>

  <p>"I promise," I answered faintly. "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, no buts," he interrupted. "You would have me take courage, but let
  me tell you this, Neillson&mdash;no bridegroom on the eve of his marriage
  ever longed for the morrow as I long for death. I have lived in the knowledge
  of such guilt as the most hardened criminal on earth might have shrunk from
  confessing. My existence has been a lie and a living death. D'Aubron's sword
  will end it, and I shall escape at last."</p>

  <p>There was a click of the little wicket gate leading from the plantation,
  and Mr. Carlyon and Mr. Brown appeared, followed at a little distance by M.
  d'Aubron and a stranger. Just as they reached us M. d'Aubron touched Mr.
  Carlyon on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to introduce my friend, Mr. Vachey&mdash;Mr. Vachey, Mr.
  Carlyon."</p>

  <p>The slightest of recognitions passed between the two men.</p>

  <p>The two seconds withdrew to a little distance, where their conversation
  did not reach me. But it was very brief, and distinguished on Mr. Carlyon's
  side by the most icy politeness. In a very few minutes the preliminaries were
  over, and the two men were standing face to face on guard. Then the signal
  was given. For about a quarter of an hour it seemed to me that M. de Feurget
  had all the advantage. Then he seemed suddenly to tire and to fence less
  vigorously and scarcely to attempt a single repass. M. d'Aubron grew less
  cautious, and very nearly paid the penalty with his life. As it was he was
  slightly wounded by a deadly thrust in tierce which he only half parried, and
  was compelled to rest for a moment.</p>

  <p>When they recommenced, M. de Feurget appeared for the first time to put
  forth all his powers. A dozen times he held his opponent's life in his hands
  by the success of some brilliant feint which M. d'Aubron utterly failed to
  parry, but on each occasion he lowered his sword without doing any serious
  mischief. The end seemed to all of us assured, and I began to think of his
  prophecy with a smile. Suddenly there came an interruption. The intense,
  almost breathless, stillness was broken by the sound of quick, hurrying
  footsteps through the plantation, and we all turned to look. With his hand
  upon the gate stood my master, pale and travel-stained, and by his side was a
  tall, white-haired woman, of stately carriage, and dressed in the long, plain
  robe of a Sister of Mercy. I looked at her for a moment, and then a great cry
  burst from my lips. Was I dreaming, or had this woman risen up from the dead?
  Surely this was Cecile d'Augerville. She whom my master had loved and
  married. She on whose fair, white arm he had clasped the bracelet. She whose
  hideous fate was ever before me, the victim of that murder which it was sure
  madness for me to think upon.</p>

  <p>An awful cry rang out to the still morning sky, and I saw her throw up her
  arms in horror. I followed her rapt gaze and I saw at once what had happened.
  Lying on the ground, supported in Mr. Carlyon's arms, was M. de Feurget, with
  his adversary's rapier through his lungs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-23"
     id="ch2-23">XXIII.&mdash;THE DUEL ON THE CLIFFS.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I saw M. d'Aubron withdraw his quivering sword from his
  opponent's body and wipe it with devilish coolness upon the grass. I saw the
  wounded man's eyes fixed with a glazed, horrible intensity upon the tall,
  black-robed woman&mdash;ghost I thought her then&mdash;at the wicket gate.
  And, finally, I saw her move swiftly forward over the smooth turf, and,
  bending over him, gaze anxiously into his convulsed face.</p>

  <p>She would have taken his hand, but he dragged it away from her with a low,
  moaning cry. Most fearful to witness was the frantic horror with which he
  shrank back from the pale, pitying face so close to his.</p>

  <p>"Marie!" he cried. "Oh, my God, spare me this! I am dying, I tell you! Oh,
  let me be! Away! Away!"</p>

  <p>He held out his hands feebly, as though to shut out the sight of her. With
  a look of wonder in her calm face, she sank on her knees by his side and
  whispered softly to him&mdash;yet not so softly but that my quickened hearing
  caught the sound of her clear tone.</p>

  <p>"Victor! Victor! Don't you know me? It is not Marie! It is I, her sister,
  Cecile."</p>

  <p>He looked at her half doubtfully, but in a moment or two he was
  convinced.</p>

  <p>"I thought that you were dead," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Dead to the world, Victor! Dead to all former ties. Yet, as you see, in
  the flesh, alive. I have come from a seclusion which I had hoped never to
  have left to undertake a mournful task."</p>

  <p>A great relief crept slowly into his face. He drew a long breath and tried
  to raise himself a little. I approached and, kneeling down, supported him in
  my arms.</p>

  <p>"Heaven has sent you both here," he said in a firmer tone. "I am thankful!
  Stand here by my side and listen. I am crossing the threshold of death, and I
  have an awful confession to make."</p>

  <p>"I have come to hear it, Victor," she answered. "All is blank mystery to
  us now. You must clear it up."</p>

  <p>"God give me strength!" he prayed. Then he glanced around, but it was
  needless. The others had left us, and we four were alone.</p>

  <p>"My time is short," he went on, speaking with difficulty in a hoarse,
  broken undertone. "Listen, all of you. Ay, come close to me&mdash;as close as
  you will. You will shrink far enough away presently. The people round here,
  what is it they call me? Pious, good, benevolent! Ah, the hypocrisy of it.
  Listen; I am the blackest sinner upon God's earth!</p>

  <p>"Cecile, you know how I loved your sister. It was the one great
  overmastering passion of my life. For her sake I gave up my dreams of the
  Church. To win her love I renounced without a single regret the calling which
  before had seemed to me the only means of attaining to earthly happiness. I
  became her blind slave, a hanger-on, a parasite at her father's house, a
  sharer, although an unwilling one, in pastimes and scenes which before I had
  looked upon only with scorn. And with what did she repay me? With her love?
  Alas, no! She married me, it is true, but it was a sorry compact. In less
  than a week my happiness was blasted forever. To you,' Cecile, her sister, I
  say nothing of the early days of our wedded life. I will only say that we
  were not happy, and before what we called our honeymoon was over I had
  discovered her secret. She never loved me. Worse than that, she loved some
  one else. She loved your father, Lord Alceston&mdash;she had always loved
  him&mdash;and she was a woman who knew how to love. She had married me merely
  because she was homeless and I was rich. I was a cipher only in her
  eyes&mdash;rather hateful to her than otherwise. At the end of the year she
  told me that she could live with me no longer, and we separated.</p>

  <p>"It broke my heart; but I crept into solitude, and hid my grief from the
  world. I sent Marie, our daughter, to a convent school, and I lived here
  alone, fighting with my trouble and seeking to ease it by lightening the
  sorrows of others. Year after year passed away, and premature middle age
  stole upon me before my time. My heavy burden of grief grew no
  less&mdash;still I endured. At regular intervals I heard of your sister,
  Cecile. Think of me as meanly as you like, Cecile; I had her watched by
  private agents, and so keenly that her slightest action I knew of. By
  accident, one day she discovered it, and from that time she refused to touch
  one penny of my money. She kept her word, and from that time she supported
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Even then I continued 'to help her, although indirectly, and unknown to
  her, and I continued also to have her watched, for I could not bear the
  thought that she might have to struggle against sickness or want. I heard of
  her visit to you, Cecile, and when she returned to Paris, alas! that visit
  had suggested a fatal idea to her. She heard from you that the Earl of
  Alceston believed you dead and had married again. Then she planned a wicked
  thing, for which, God knows, she paid an awful penalty.</p>

  <p>"I knew&mdash;I always knew, alas!&mdash;that Marie had loved your father,
  Lord Alceston. When he preferred you, Cecile, that love changed into another
  feeling. How far Lord Alceston was to blame, I cannot tell. But Marie must
  have believed herself injured, or she would never have nursed her feelings
  through so many years and then concentrated them in an ill-fated scheme for
  revenge. She had a bracelet made like yours, Cecile. She took humble lodgings
  in London, and one night she sent him a mote telling him that his wife,
  Cecile, lived, and bidding him go to her at once. I knew this, for I had
  followed her to London with the one hope of saving her honor and myself from
  shame. I had taken my daughter with me in the last despairing hope that the
  sight of her child, whom she had never seen since babyhood, might soften her.
  Alas! Alas! Alas!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a rush of blood from his mouth and he fell back ghastly
  pale, with the agony of death written in his pallid features and luminous
  eyes. Almost at the same moment the wicket gate opened and a doctor and the
  village priest in his long robes appeared. The former hurried up, and,
  dropping on his knee, made a hasty examination, but he shook his head almost
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"Hemorrhage has set in," he pronounced. "M. de Feurget, I can do nothing
  for you. Alas! you have but a few minutes to live!"</p>

  <p>He stood back, and the village priest took his place. A breath of fresh
  morning air swept softly across the little plateau. It seemed to revive him.
  The stream of blood had ceased, and he motioned to us to raise him a
  little.</p>

  <p>"God give me strength to finish," he prayed. "Father, stand by my side.
  You have heard my confession; you have seen my agony! You know all. Come
  nearer, Lord Alceston. I can only whisper.</p>

  <p>"It was at night I went to see her. For two days I had lingered about the
  door, lacking the courage to go in and plead with her. I went with pity and
  love in my heart. I went to make one last appeal; to tell her of our child,
  and to save her from shame. My old love, which had lived always with me, was
  still as strong as ever. I would have done anything in the world she had
  asked. I only wanted her back again, cruelly though she had used me.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! my God!" he moaned. "It was a cruel thing to send me there
  that one night of all others and at that hour. I met him&mdash;your father,
  Lord Alceston&mdash;coming away from the house. How I kept my hands from him
  then I cannot tell. But I did. I let him pass without word or sign. I went to
  her. It was cruel how she received me. She never wished to look upon my face
  again, she said. She hated me. She hated our child. She would not hear me
  speak. She bade me go. In less than five minutes I left the house a raving
  madman. I followed Lord Alceston home. I saw him enter the house by a private
  door, and in his haste he left the key outside. I took it, and in a few
  minutes I followed him softly.</p>

  <p>"I was in a great, dimly-lit room lined with books&mdash;his library; but
  it was empty. I walked restlessly up and down, waiting for him; but he did
  not come. In an evil moment my attention was attracted by a long row of
  curious, gleaming daggers in a dark oak cabinet. From the moment my eyes fell
  upon the bright steel I became a devil. I felt the desire to kill spring up
  within me. From that moment I was a murderer."</p>

  <p>A low moan seemed to creep from Lord Alceston's lips, and I saw the woman
  by his side shudder with a horror too deep for expression. But neither
  interrupted him by any articulate word.</p>

  <p>"If ever man in the world was mad I was mad then. I listened. From another
  part of the house I could hear the strains of music and the sound of many
  voices. But there was no one near&mdash;no one at hand to disturb me.</p>

  <p>"I took one of the daggers&mdash;the one with the bluest steel and the
  sharpest point I could find. Then I let myself out of the room by the private
  door and carefully pocketed the key. I rushed away. I bought a disguise at a
  low rag-shop on the way. The cunning of the devil seemed to come to me. I got
  an empty room next to hers, and when the house was silent I stole in to her.
  I killed her! I killed her, with her beautiful face flashing its hatred at
  me&mdash;with the mocking, scornful words still upon her lips! Then I hurried
  from the house back to Grosvenor Square. The thirst for blood was upon me. A
  maniacal fury seemed to burn in my veins. I stole again into the dimly-lit
  library. Still it was empty. But I waited.</p>

  <p>"Toward morning he came. I heard his slow footsteps outside, and I hid
  myself. I watched him sit down at his desk, and I planned to myself how I
  would kill him. I meant to strangle him; but as I crept out from my
  hiding-place I made some slight noise. He started and looked round. I just
  managed to escape observation, and while he was ringing for his servant, I
  slipped behind the screen and out into the passage.</p>

  <p>"Through the keyhole I watched you, Neillson, arrive. I saw you search the
  room. I heard Lord Alceston decide that it must have been his fancy. He
  settled down to write again, and soon with added caution I stole into the
  room. I drew another dagger from the case, and, God help me, I killed
  him!</p>

  <p>"I rushed out into the street, with his death-cry ringing in my ears. At
  the first breath of cold air sanity began to return. The instinct of
  self-preservation came upon me, and I turned and fled. I went to Dover and
  came back again, half-determined to give myself up. Then my senses slowly
  returned and I knew what I had done! I thought of my daughter, and for her
  sake I held my peace. Still I was reckless. On the pretence of identifying
  her I looked once more into my wife's face, and unknown, unrecognized, I
  followed her to the grave. Then we came back here, and my tortures commenced.
  Day by day I lived in a very hell of remorse and agony. Another man was
  suspected! If he should be arrested I must give myself up. Marie would know
  all&mdash;would know that her father was a murderer! Such a murderer! The
  anguish I have suffered no words of mine could depict. Hell can offer no
  greater torment than earth has punished me with. And now she will know! Marie
  will know! She will hate her father! She will loathe his memory forever! Oh,
  Death, come to me quickly, or I shall die a raving madman!"</p>

  <p>It was an awful moment&mdash;an awful sight to look upon. A dying man
  fighting for his last breath with such words upon his lips! Strong though he
  was, my master was shaking in every limb with emotion, and the black-robed
  woman who stood by his side had turned a little away with her face hidden in
  her hands, as though the sight were too terrible for her. The priest, with
  trembling fingers, drew out a cross from his robe and held it before the eyes
  of the dying man, but he pushed him almost roughly away.</p>

  <p>"Lord Alceston!" he cried.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. I saw my master shrink away, compassion struggling in
  vain with horror in his white face.</p>

  <p>"Lord Alceston, come nearer. In a few minutes I shall stand before another
  Judge to answer for my crime. I do not ask forgiveness. But Marie! She will
  know all! She will curse my memory! I shall have robbed her of you, the man
  she loved! Ah!"</p>

  <p>We followed his outstretched trembling fingers. At the gate, loosely clad
  in a plain white dressing-gown, with her long hair streaming in the breeze,
  stood Marie. She was gazing at us as though petrified with horror, clinging
  with one arm to a slender pine tree for support, and with the other pressed
  against her forehead.</p>

  <p>"My father! My father!" she cried, the words at last bursting from her
  frozen lips. "What is the matter? What has happened? Is he ill? Can none of
  you tell me?"</p>

  <p>She looked toward us each in turn. None of us could speak. With trembling
  fingers she strove to open the postern. The dying man shivered all over and
  covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>I glanced toward my master. His face was deadly pale, and his lips were
  moving as though in prayer. Suddenly he stooped down.</p>

  <p>"Look up," he whispered, "and bid your daughter farewell. She shall think
  of you always as she does now. As her husband I swear it. You alone shall
  answer for your sins; and may God have mercy upon you!"</p>

  <p>Like magic was the effect of the hoarse whispered words. Again the light
  leaped into the dying man's eyes and peace shone in his softened face. The
  priest again held the cross before his eyes, and this time he nodded and
  smiled faintly. One hand Marie grasped and carried it to her lips, where the
  hot, scalding tears fell fast upon it; the other Lord Alceston took and held
  in his own.</p>

  <p>A moment's deep stillness and it was over. As suddenly as it had come the
  light died out of his fast-dimmed eyes and the smile slowly faded from his
  lips. But the peace remained.</p>
