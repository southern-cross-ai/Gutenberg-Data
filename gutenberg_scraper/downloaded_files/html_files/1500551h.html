sort of person who will not accept it as a novel, then Mr. Wells
asks that you leave it alone. You are not getting sly peeps at
something more real than the reality of art, and your attempts to
squint through will only make you squint very unbecomingly.</p>

<h2><a id="review" name="review">ONE OF WELLS'S WORLDS</a><br>
<small>A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW OF <i>THE WORLD OF WILLIAM
CLISSOLD</i></small>
</h2>

<h3>BY JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES</h3>

<h3>Published in <i>The New Republic</i>, February 1, 1927</h3>

<p class="quote">Mr. Wells, in <i>The World of William
Clissold</i>, presents, not precisely his own mind as it has
developed on the basis of his personal experience and way of life,
but&mdash;shifting his angle&mdash;a point of view based on an
experience mainly different from his own, that of a successful,
emancipated, semi-scientific, not particularly high-brow, English
business man. The result is not primarily a work of art. Ideas, not
forms, are its substance. It is a piece of educational
writing&mdash;propaganda, if you like&mdash;an attempt to convey,
to the very big public, attitudes of mind already partly familiar
to the very small public.</p>

<p class="quote">The book is an <i>omnium gatherum</i>. I will
select two emergent themes of a quasi-economic character. Apart
from these, the main topic is women and some of their possible
relationships in the modern world to themselves and to men of the
Clissold type. This is treated with great candor, sympathy, and
observation. It leaves, and is meant to leave, a bitter taste.</p>

<p class="quote">The first of these themes is a violent protest
against conservatism, an insistent emphasis on the necessity and
rapidity of change, the folly of looking backwards, the danger of
inadaptability. Mr. Wells produces a curious sensation, nearly
similar to that of some of his earlier romances, by contemplating
vast stretches of time backwards and forwards which give an
impression of slowness (no need to hurry in eternity), yet
accelerating the Time Machine as he reaches the present day so that
now we travel at an enormous pace and no longer have millions of
years to turn round in. The conservative influences in our life are
envisaged as dinosaurs whom literal extinction is awaiting just
ahead. The contrast comes from the failure of our ideas, our
conventions, our prejudices to keep up with the pace of material
change. Our environment moves too much faster than we do. The walls
of our traveling compartment are bumping our heads. Unless we
hustle, the traffic will run us down. Conservatism is no better
than suicide. Woe to our dinosaurs!</p>

<p class="quote">This is one aspect. We stand still at our peril.
Time flies. But there is another aspect of the same thing&mdash;and
this is where Clissold comes in. What a bore for the modern man,
whose mind in his active career moves with the times, to stand
still in his observances and way of life! What a bore are the
feasts and celebrations with which London or New York crowns
success! What a bore to go through the social contortions which
have lost significance, and conventional pleasures which no longer
please! The contrast between the exuberant, constructive activity
of a prince of modern commerce and the lack of an appropriate
environment for him out of office hours is acute. Moreover, there
are wide stretches in the career of moneymaking which are entirely
barren and non-constructive. There is a fine passage in the first
volume about the profound, ultimate boredom of City men. Clissold's
father, the company promoter and speculator, falls first into
megalomania and then into fraud, because he is bored. I do not
doubt that this same thing is true of Wall Street. Let us,
therefore, mold with both hands the plastic material of social life
into our own contemporary image.</p>

<p class="quote">We do not merely belong to a latter-day
age&mdash;we are ourselves in the literal sense older than our
ancestors were in the years of our maturity and our power. Mr.
Wells brings out strongly a too much neglected feature of modern
life, that we live much longer than formerly, and, what is more
important, prolong our health and vigor into a period of life which
was formerly one of decay, so that the average man can now look
forward to a duration of activity which hitherto only the
exceptional could anticipate. I can add, indeed, a further fact,
which Mr. Wells overlooks (I think), likely to emphasize this yet
further in the next fifty years as compared with the last fifty
years&mdash;namely, that the average age of a rapidly increasing
population is much less than that of a stationary population. For
example, in the stable conditions to which England and probably the
United States also, somewhat later, may hope to approximate in the
course of the next two generations, we shall somewhat rapidly
approach to a position in which, in proportion to population,
elderly, people (say, sixty-five years of age and above) will be
nearly 100 percent, and middle-aged people (say, forty-five years
of age and above), nearly 50 percent more numerous than in the
recent past. In the nineteenth century, effective power was in the
hands of men probably not less than fifteen years older on the
average than in the sixteenth century; and before the twentieth
century is out, the average may have risen another fifteen years,
unless effective means are found, other than obvious physical or
mental decay, to make vacancies at the top. Clissold (in his
sixtieth year, he it noted) sees more advantage and less
disadvantage in this state of affairs than I do. Most men love
money and security more, and creation and construction less, as
they get older; and this process begins long before their
intelligent judgment on detail is apparently impaired. Mr. Wells's
preference for an adult world over a juvenile, sex-ridden world may
be right. But the margin between this and a middle-aged,
money-ridden world is a narrow one. We are threatened, at the best,
with the appalling problem of the able-bodied "retired," of which
Mr. Wells himself gives a sufficient example in his desperate
account of the regular denizens of the Riviera.</p>

<p class="quote">We are living, then, in an unsatisfactory age of
immensely rapid transition in which most, but particularly those in
the vanguard, find themselves and their environment ill-adapted to
one another, and are for this reason far less happy than their less
sophisticated forebears were, or their yet more sophisticated
descendants need be. This diagnosis, applied by Mr. Wells to the
case of those engaged in the practical life of action, is
essentially the same as Mr. Edwin Muir's, in his deeply interesting
volume of criticism. Transition, to the case of those engaged in
the life of art and contemplation. Our foremost writers, according
to Mr. Muir, are uncomfortable in the world&mdash;they can neither
support nor can they oppose anything with a full confidence, with
the result that their work is inferior in relation to their talents
compared with work produced in happier ages&mdash;jejune,
incomplete, starved, anaemic, like their own feelings to the
universe.</p>

<p class="quote">In short, we cannot stay where we are; we are on
the move&mdash;on the move, not necessarily either to better or to
worse, but just to an equilibrium. But why not to the better? Why
should we not begin to reap spiritual fruits from our material
conquests? If so, whence is to come the motive power of desirable
change? This brings us to Mr. Wells's second theme.</p>

<p class="quote">Mr. Wells describes in the first volume of
Clissold his hero's disillusionment with socialism. In the final
volume he inquires if there is an alternative. From whence are we
to draw the forces which are "to change the laws, customs, rules,
and institutions of the world"? "From what classes and types are
the revolutionaries to be drawn? How are they to be brought into
cooperation? What are to be their methods?" The labor movement is
represented as an immense and dangerous force cf destruction, led
by sentimentalists and pseudo-intellectuals, who have "feelings in
the place of ideas." A constructive revolution cannot possibly be
contrived by these folk. The creative intellect of mankind is not
to be found in these quarters, but amongst the scientists and the
great modern business men. Unless we can harness to the job this
type of mind and character and temperament, it can never be put
through&mdash;for it is a task of immense practical complexity and
intellectual difficulty. We must recruit our revolutionaries,
therefore, from the Right, not from the Left. We must persuade the
type of man whom it now amuses to create a great business, that
there lie waiting for him yet bigger things which will amuse him
more. This is Clissold's "Open Conspiracy." Clissold's direction is
to the Left&mdash;far, far to the Left; but he seeks to summon from
the Right the creative force and the constructive will which is to
carry him there. He describes himself as being temperamentally and
fundamentally a liberal. But political Liberalism must die "to be
born again with firmer features and a clearer will."</p>

<p class="quote">Clissold is expressing a reaction against the
Socialist party which very many feel, including Socialists. The
remolding of the world needs the touch of the creative Brahma. But
at present Brahma is serving science and business, not politics or
government. The extreme danger of the world is, in Clissold's
words, lest, "before the creative Brahma can get to work, Siva, in
other words the passionate destructiveness of labor awakening to
its now needless limitations and privations, may make Brahma's task
impossible." We all feel this, I think. We know that we need
urgently to create a milieu in which Brahma can get to work before
it is too late. Up to a point, therefore, most active and
constructive temperaments in every political camp are ready to join
the Open Conspiracy.</p>

<p class="quote">What, then, is it, that holds them back? It is
here, I think, that Clissold is in some way deficient and
apparently lacking in insight. Why do practical men find it more
amusing to make money than to join the Open Conspiracy? I suggest
that it is much the same reason as that which makes them find it
more amusing to play bridge on Sundays than to go to church. They
lack altogether the kind of motive, the possession of which, if
they had it, could be expressed by saying that they had a creed.
They have no creed, these potential open conspirators, no creed
whatever. That is why&mdash;unless they have the luck to be
scientists or artists&mdash;they fall back on the grand substitute
motive, the perfect ersatz, the anodyne for those who in fact want
nothing at all&mdash;money. Clissold charges the enthusiasts of
labor that they have "feelings in the place of ideas." But he does
not deny that they have feelings. Has not, perhaps, poor Mr. Cook
something which Clissold lacks? Clissold and his brother Dickon,
the advertising expert, flutter about the world seeking for
something to which they can attach their abundant libido. But they
have not found it. They would so like to be Apostles. But they
cannot. They remain business men.</p>

<p class="quote">I have taken two themes from a book which contains
dozens. They are not all treated equally well. Knowing the
Universities much better than Mr. Wells does, I declare that his
account contains no more than the element of truth which is proper
to a caricature. He underestimates altogether their
possibilities&mdash;how they may yet become temples of Brahma which
even Siva will respect. But Clissold, taken altogether, is a great
achievement, a huge and meaty egg from a glorious hen, an abundant
outpouring of an ingenious, truthful, and generous spirit.</p>

<p class="quote">Though we talk about pure art as never before,
this is not a good age for pure artists, nor is it a good one for
classical perfections. Our most pregnant writers today are full of
imperfections; they expose themselves to judgment; they do not look
to be immortal. For these reasons, perhaps, we, their
contemporaries, do them and the debt we owe them less than justice.
What a debt every intelligent being owes to Bernard Shaw! What a
debt also to H. G. Wells, whose mind seems to have grown up
alongside his readers', so that, in successive phases, be has
delighted us and guided our imaginations from boyhood to
maturity.</p>

<h2><a id="note" name="note"></a>A NOTE BEFORE THE TITLE PAGE</h2>

<p class="first">NOVELS with prefaces are like pictures with
inscriptions below them; there is a confession that something was
left over and had to be expressed by an addendum. But the note
which is offered here is not a preface so much as a protest, and in
token therefor it is put before the title-page and does not figure
in the list of contents. It is a protest against certain stock
tricks of the book reviewer and certain prevalent vulgarities about
books. They concern the treatment of opinion in works of fiction
and what is called "putting people into novels."</p>

<p>This book, then, <i>The World of William Clissold</i>, is a
novel. It is claimed to be a complete full-dress novel, that and
nothing more. William Clissold is a fictitious character, and his
thoughts and ideas throughout are the thoughts and ideas natural to
his mental and social type. He is (to the best of his author's
ability) his own self and <i>not</i> his author's self, in his
emotional reactions, in his hard wilfulness, in his faith, in his
political ideas, in his judgments. He is a specimen of modern
liberalism, using liberalism in its broadest sense. He is a study
of a modern type seeking modes of self-realisation. His
circumstances and his views are fitted together with the utmost
care to make one consistent personality. His views run very close
at times&mdash;but not always&mdash;to the views his author has in
his own person expressed; nevertheless, is it too much to ask that
they be treated here as his own? Naturally his point of view is
like Mr. Wells'. That was to be expected. How can one imagine and
invent the whole interior world of an uncongenial type? Every
author must write of the reactions he knows; he must be near enough
to them to <i>feel</i> them sympathetically. It is unreasonable to
expect the author of this book to write of the inner life of such
people as the devout Mr. Belloc, for example, or the aristocratic
Duke of Northumberland, or the political Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. He
can only comment on such types from an inaccessible remoteness,
attack them, admire them, state his differences from them. Their
ultimate processes are inconceivable to him. There never was a
character created by an imaginative author from the inside which
did not contain this quite unavoidable element of self-projection.
Even Hamlet is believed to be a self-projection of Shakespeare. But
while this is forgiven and taken for granted in the criticism of
most authors, it is made a stock grievance against the present
writer. It would be a great kindness to a no doubt undeserving
author if in this instance William Clissold could be treated as
William Clissold, and if Mr Wells could be spared the standard
charge of having changed his views afresh, and so forth and so on,
because William Clissold sees many things from a different angle
than did Mr. Polly, George Ponderevo, Susan Ponderevo, Mr. Preemby,
Dr. Devizes, Dr. Martineau, Remington, Kipps, the artilleryman in
<i>The War of the Worlds</i>, Uncle Nobby, Benham, Billy Prothero,
and the many other characters who have been identified as
mouthpieces and exponents of Mr. Wells' scandalously varied views
and attitudes. And it is a point worth considering in this period
of successful personal memoirs that if the author had wanted to
write a mental autobiography instead of a novel, there is no
conceivable reason why he should not have done so.</p>

<p>Clearly he did not want to do so.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the second point in this intimate but
necessary plea. This is not a <i>roman à clef</i>. It is a work of
fiction, purely and completely. One thing which is something of an
innovation has to be noted. A great number of real people are
actually named in this story. It is, the author submits, impossible
to get the full effect of contemporary life in which living ideas
and movements playa dominant part without doing that. You cannot
have a man like William Clissold going about the world of to-day
and never meeting anybody one has ever heard of. Some of these
living personages are not only mentioned but more or less
described. But always under their proper names. Dr. Jung is made to
talk in a London flat. It is very much as he talked in a London
flat. He appears because certain original ideas of his have been
taken and woven into the Clissold point of view, and it was at once
ungracious not to acknowledge the far-reaching suggestions that
came from him and clumsy and self-important to make a footnote or a
prefatory note. Shaw, again, the Shaw of the 'eighties, blows into
a Kensington evening, and Keynes lunches with Clissold. These are
affectionate hospitalities; they do not wound nor injure and can
awaken no resentment.</p>

<p>With one transparent exception, the vignette of a great
scientific man at home in Book I., which is partially a portrait,
every character that appears in the book under a fictitious name is
an entirely fictitious character. The more nearly they may approach
to living instances, the more fictitious they are. They say and do
things that living people are saying and doing. That is inevitable
in a picture of contemporary life. If one were to write a story in
which a Prime Minister had to figure during the Balfour regime, it
would be necessary to have a Prime Minister rather like Lord
Balfour&mdash;or everything would have to be different. If an
August Personage has to descend into the narrative, it would have
to be drawn to the figure of the August Personage of the period. A
beggar or a policeman must be something like some beggar or
policeman one actually knows. People must be more or less similar
to real people up and down the scale, so long as one is writing a
novel and not a fantasy. But though you made your Prime Minister as
Balfouresque as possible or your Prince as princely, it would be
for atmosphere and not for statement, and the last imputation that
is permissible against a novelist is that he is trying to say or
insinuate this or that about an individual without daring to say it
plainly and directly to the proper address. Cannot this sort of
imputation be checked?</p>

<p>Cannot those who criticise books and write about books cease to
pander to that favourite amusement of vulgar, half-educated,
curious, but ill-informed people, the hunt for the imaginary
"originals" of every fictitious character for those who will, for
example, discover in the present case that X or Y or Z, who is an
advertising specialist, "sat for" the brother Dickon of this story,
or that Lady Steinhart is some particular resident in Cannes or
Nice&mdash;because she has a large garden? And that it is all great
fun and very malicious and <i>not</i> for a moment to be treated as
serious literature. This identification of "originals" is an old
trick of the Victorian novelist and publisher; it was, I suppose,
an attempt to enhance interest by that faint intimation of libel.
It is really not just to the spirit and intention of a book of this
type.</p>

<p>An inanimate instance from this book will make the matter
clearer without touching upon any personal note. There is written
here the most exact and detailed description of the <i>mas</i>,
which is the scene of nearly the whole novel. Rooms in that house
are described, bits of its garden, the view from the windows. It is
possible to locate that <i>mas</i> within a few miles of Grasse; it
is possible to find not one but a score of views closely similar to
the view pictured so explicitly, a similar <i>mas</i> is to be
found. But the actual <i>mas</i> no one will ever find, nor the
precise rooms, nor the exact view. That <i>mas</i> does not exist.
That view does not exist. It is the case of Mr. Britling's home
over again, which everyone who did not know Mr. Wells' home in
Essex very well, knew so surely was an exact account of Easton
Glebe. The less these identifiers knew about it, the more they
appreciated the photographic quality of the picture. The less they
knew Mr. Wells, the more certainly they recognised him in Mr.
Britling. Enthusiastic strangers still invade Mr. Wells at times
with the demand to see the place where he wept when he heard that
his eldest son was killed. It is embarrassing to encounter such
intrusive sympathy for an entirely imaginary loss. And matters
become complicated when "originals" volunteer and surrender to the
detectives. A charming contemporary has just confided to the world
that she was the "original" of Beatrice in <i>Tono Bungay</i>. It
is the first intimation that has reached the author of this
interesting fact. No one would have suspected it.</p>

<p>But this time may we have a truce to such artless tributes to
the novelist's art? It was William Clissold, an entirely fictitious
character, who thought out most of the problems of his life and
made belated love to his fictitious Clementina in a fictitious
<i>mas</i> in Provence, and in spite of the entirely imaginary
wreckage of an automobile in the road to Thorenc the author
survives. It is no good to look for that stone, with its simple
inscription, in the Magagnosc cemetery. To the best of his
knowledge and belief the author has never been buried anywhere.
Even brother Dickon's allusion to William's good looks is not to be
regarded as modest self-revelation. All novelists use actual
experiences in their work. They must know things before they tell
about them. But all novelists rearrange, sublimate, intensify. One
turns over the sketch-book of one's memories and uses what one
needs. One takes a lifted eyebrow here and a mimosa in flower
there. The imagination discovers a certain congruity between some
actual situation and some constructive necessity, and works in as
much of the situation as it needs. But it alters and rearranges
without scruple. The eyebrow is not a portrait; the parallelism of
a situation is not a report. Surely there is enough to read in this
book without reading between the lines.</p>

<p>And one other question may be glanced at here before this note
concludes. There is much discussion of opinion in this book. Does
that make it anything but a novel? Is it not quite as much "life"
to meet and deal with a new idea as to meet and deal with a new
lover? Must the characters in our English and American novels be
for evermore as cleaned of thought as a rabbit is of its bowels,
before they can be served up for consumption? This book, which
contains religious, historical, economic, and sociological
discussions, which expresses fits of temper and moods of doubt, is
at any rate submitted as a novel, as a whole novel, and nothing but
a novel, as the story of one man's adventure, body, soul, and
intelligence, in life. If you are the sort of person who will not
accept it as a novel, then please leave it alone. You are not
getting sly peeps at something more real than the reality of art,
and your attempts to squint through will only make you squint very
unbecomingly.</p>

<h2><a id="b1-sec1" name="b1-sec1"></a>§ 1. THE BEGINNING OF A
BOOK</h2>

<p class="first">YESTERDAY I was fifty-nine, and in a year I shall
be Sixty&mdash;"getting on for seventy," as the unpleasant old
phrase goes. I was born in November, 1865, and this is November,
1924. The average duration of life in England is fifty-one and a
half, so I am already eight years and a half beyond the common lot.
The percentage of people who live beyond sixty is forty-seven.
Beyond seventy it is thirty. Only one in five thousand lives beyond
one hundred, and of this small body of centenarians two thirds are
women. My expectation of life, says the table in the Almanac, is
fourteen years and four months. That table in the Almanac is not a
mathematical marvel, but it is close enough to the truth to serve
my purpose here.</p>

<p>In the face of these figures I cannot hide from myself that the
greater part of my life has been lived. So far I have had but few
physical reminders of the ebb of the years. I do not feel that I am
even beginning to be old. Perhaps I grow tired more readily than I
did at thirty, and my tennis is neither so hard nor so quick-witted
as it used to be, but my arteries, the doctors tell me, are still
young arteries. I cannot read Bradshaw nowadays, I must put on
spectacles for that, and I do not like to swim in cold water any
more. Yet in good daylight I can still read ordinary print with
unaided eyes, and, come to think of it, I have always gasped in
cold water. Maybe I have not so much lost endurance as learnt
wisdom. And generally my vigour is unimpaired. It is the dates and
figures that will not be denied. They show quite plainly that at
most only two decades remain for me, and when they are spent my
strongest will be a white-faced, rather shrunken, assisted old
man&mdash;"wonderful," they will say. I know because I say it now
of Sir Rupert York and old Hayes. The greater chance is that I
shall be no more than a jarful of ashes and a fading memory.</p>

<p>Possibly they may make something in time for me from these
monkey glands they talk about; but I distrust these rejuvenescent
extracts. I do not want merely to prolong my years as an unpleasant
experiment. I may go on for some time yet by my own unaided
strength, unless a serious illness catches me. Then, I have
observed, if one comes back at all one comes back "aged."</p>

<p>I do not complain that I have to grow old. It is not a thing
that I think about habitually. But the birthdays come round to
remind me, and this year some journalist got hold of my date but
added up the years wrong, and in the <i>Evening Standard</i> I
found myself subjected to congratulations on attaining sixty. I was
so startled that I did a little sum at once on the margin of the
paper. For a moment I felt just as though I had missed a bank-note
from a not too distended purse.</p>

<p>His mistake.</p>

<p>But to-day I find myself retrospective. I have been caught up
for a couple of days in London before I go back to my sunshine in
Provence, and I am all alone. Outside it is not so much day as a
saturated piece of dingy time, a stretch of chewed and damp and
dirty fourth dimension between two nights. It rains fitfully, now
in fine clouds, now in hysterical downpours, now in phases of
drizzling <i>undecided</i> intermission; and the shops are lit and
there are lights in the windows. There is a sort of grey
discoloration filtering down from above that I suppose one must
admit to be daylight. Wet omnibuses, wet taxicabs and automobiles
splash and blunder by, there are a few reluctant foot passengers
under wet umbrellas. Everything shines greasily with the rain like
the backs of rolling porpoises. What a climate! This intolerable
place, they say, is the healthiest city in the world. Thank Heaven!
I leave it to-morrow.</p>

<p>I do not venture outside this room to-day. At any rate I will
lunch here. These excellent chambers of my brother's are kept by a
French couple who combine English comfort with French cookery. No
wonder old Dickon grows fat. He is in Brussels now&mdash;probably
growing fatter. Inadvertently. He does not want to grow fat. He is
dining with a curious little society for the promotion of
scientific finance, of which he is one of the founders. That is all
I know about his business in Brussels. Then he is going on into
Germany, still in pursuit of monetary ideas. His energy and
industry in the cause he has taken up are prodigious&mdash;and he
is nearly three years older than I. He thrives on it. No wonder he
needs a comfortable resting-place here. From these rooms one might
imagine him sedentary. They make me feel sedentary. But even his
sedentariness has directness and vigour. There is something about
this room in particular, and this desk of his and this chair of
his, remarkably conducive to not going out. To-day especially.</p>

<p>Before me are good square sheets of paper and quill-pens and
every provocation to write. The lamp is admirably shaded. So why
should I not write, and forget altogether that visible chill, that
inky catarrh of a climate which is snivelling against the
window-panes?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec2" name="b1-sec2"></a>§ 2. THE WORLD IN THE
CRYSTAL</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some time now I have had the idea of writing a
book dominatIng my mind and never quite settling down to a positive
beginning. I have wanted to begin so much, the thing has become so
important to me that the very strength of my desire has restrained
me. I have written one or two books before, but they have been
technical works of no significance to the unspecialised reader. I
have written various reports, too, and between thirty and forty
scientific papers. Such things seem to write themselves. The book I
have in mind now is something altogether more human and difficult
than that.</p>

<p>It is not exactly an autobiography I want to write, and not
exactly a book of confessions. My life has been largely spent in
work; my only scandal was a public scandal and very fully reported.
I do not see why I should repeat the newspapers again; much of my
business I can only discuss in general terms because of my
obligations to my firm and our associates, and there remains little
for me to confess, even if I had the Rousseau streak in me. It is
with larger affairs than my own that my projected book would deal.
It is nothing, indeed, so systematic as a general philosophy of
life I contemplate, but it is something rather more in that way
than an autobiography would be. I should say that a description of
my world best expresses what I have in view; my world and my
will.</p>

<p>I want it to be a picture of everything as it is reflected in my
brain. I want it to be a comprehensive picture. The book, as I see
it, should begin with my&mdash;I suppose I shall have to
say&mdash;"metaphysics"; it should display my <i>orbis
terrarum</i>, and then it should come down to the spectacle of
mankind as I apprehend it and my place in that history, and so to
the immediate affairs of everyday life, to moods, passions,
experiences, lessons, and at last to the faith and purpose that
sustain me and fill my mind at the present time and make living on
worth while. The main objective is that faith and purpose. All the
rest will lead up to that, to how and why I accept life and go on
living.</p>

<p>My metaphysics I can set about at once. I shall have chiefly to
explain why I have no metaphysics. The reader need fear no
elaboration of a system, not even a negative system. It is not so
much a statement of scepticism that I have to make, as a confession
of accepted ignorance. Yet that does not mean that I am&mdash;what
is the word?&mdash;a Positivist.</p>

<p>I find most of the worlds that other people describe or take for
granted much more hard and clear and definite than mine is. I am at
once vaguer and more acutely critical. I don't believe so fully and
unquestioningly in this "common-sense" world in which we meet and
exchange ideas, this world of fact, as most people seem to do. I
have a feeling that this common-sense world is not <i>final</i>. It
is necessitated in many ways by the conditions under which we think
and communicate, and I do not regard these conditions as being
fundamental to existence. The common-sense world is a practical
working world and so far true, but it is not necessarily ultimately
true. There are times when I feel as though it was less the sphere
that enclosed me and made my all, than a sort of magic crystal into
which I peered and saw myself living. I have, as it were, a sense
of externality and a feeling that perhaps it might be possible,
though I cannot imagine how it could be possible, to turn away and
look at something else quite different from this common-sense
world&mdash;another world.</p>

<p>I never get to more than that in the way of detachment. I never
get further from philosophical Positivism than that. Could anything
be vaguer? It is the shadow of the ghost of a doubt. The individual
in that crystal globe of time and space has a hundred thousand
traits by which I know him for myself. How, then, can I be the
onlooker also, of whom I know nothing at all except that he sees?
This sense of externality is, perhaps, no more than a trick of my
brain, like a moment of giddiness as one walks along the street. It
certainly has no practical significance.</p>

<p>I am reminded as I write of this of a queer little thing that
happened to me at times, most frequently in my adolescence and when
I was a young man. I do not think that it has occurred at all
during the last ten or fifteen years. It was this: The visible
world, remaining just as bright and clear as ever it had been,
would suddenly appear to be <i>minute</i>. People became midgets,
the houses and the furniture, dolls'-houses and furniture, the
trees, mere moss-fronds. I myself did not seem to shrink to scale;
it was only the universe about me that shrank. This effect would
last for a few seconds or for a few minutes, and then it would pass
away. I have not found anyone else who has had this particular
experience, but I am sure it has happened to many other people. I
have never had the converse effect of enlargement.</p>

<p>I suppose a slight momentary change in my blood or breathing
produced a change of phase in my nervous state, I perceived a
difference in the <i>feel</i> of my vision, and my mind, a little
perplexed, interpreted it in this fashion. If so there may be drugs
that would have the same effect.</p>

<p>Or there may have been some little transitory fluctuation in my
sensations of optical adjustment. Mental specialists connect doubts
and confusions about one's identity in dreams and in cases of
mental disorder with changes in bodily feeling. Yet one may argue
that a conviction of reality which is so finely poised that it
totters at a slight excess or defect of oxygen or suchlike factor
in the blood cannot be a very soundly established one.</p>

<p>But it is not my intention to be mystical. It is the world in
the crystal I want to write about, this crystal into which I seem
to have been looking now and living for nine-and-fifty years. I
will not question the reality or quality of the crystal further. It
does not matter for my present purpose whether that is the final
reality, or only a transitory moving picture produced by some stir
of chemicals in a membrane of grey-matter inside my skull. I want
to write of the motives of action in it, of its pains and
pleasures, of its beauty and provocation, before my mental strength
begins, as it must so soon do now, to ebb. I want to write of love
and curiosity and habit and inertia and all the other motives that
have kept me going. I shall write as a fairly fortunate and happy
man, glad to have lived and very glad still to be alive, but
wonderingly, more than a little regretful that this perplexing,
interesting fabric of display and experiences, so incomplete still,
so challenging a tangle of riddles, is drawing towards it
inexorable end.</p>

<p>I do not want to go yet. I am sorry to have so little time
before me. I wish before the ebb carries me right out of things
altogether that I could know more&mdash;and know better. I came
into the world with a clutter of protest; my mind is still haunted
by protesting questions too vague for me to put into any form that
would admit of an answer. If I had more time, I would like, just
for a little while, in a winter's fireside talk, as it were, to
have things made clearer before I go.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec3" name="b1-sec3"></a>§ 3. THE TREACHEROUS
FORGET-ME-NOTS</h2>

<p class="first">My life, I confess, seems to me to be short,
distressingly short, preposterously short in comparison both with
the vast range of my thoughts in space, and with the huge
perspectives of the past and the future in which we think nowadays.
I doubt if man had quite the same sense of abbreviation before this
measuring by astronomical distances and geological ages began. And
life is not only short, but things in it are out of proportion. The
rules of perspective are reversed, and the remotest memories loom
largest and are the most vivid. Things that happened
five-and-twenty years ago are often distant and obscure enough, but
the things that happened in my childhood are things of yesterday. I
am no longer the young man I was. He and I have almost lost
identity. Nevertheless, I am still intensely the child I used to
be.</p>

<p>I suppose this is because most things are first seen and heard
and felt in childhood, and our minds file these early impressions
as key-pictures and refer the later ones to them. So they are
continually refreshed. But later experiences are no longer used as
new points of reference.</p>

<p>A hundred times, perhaps, in the course of my life and in a
score of places, for example, I have seen autumnal horse-chestnut
leaves reflected in brown water and the branches of a
horse-chestnut tree coming down close to that still mirror, but it
is definitely as a child that I think of seeing them, and all the
other occasions are in comparison vague and unassigned. I was in
the old punt on the great pond at Mowbray. The silvery sheet of
water had that convex effect one always got there upon a day of
absolute calm. It was like a very smooth broad buckler. I think
that effect of curvature must have been due to the way the reeds
and bushes shaded the edges, or perhaps to some trick in the angle
of the reflection of the pines up the slope. Far away against a
background of dark bushes, some of them still deep green and some a
rusty red, floated a little squadron of motionless swans, the old
bird marvellously tranquillised since his days of terrifying
aggression in the early summer. Even the ducks and the friendly
attendant dab-chick among the lily leaves were silent. Everything
was so still that I remember being startled by the sudden "plop" of
a falling husk into the crystalline water behind me.</p>

<p>I suppose it is the sodden horse-chestnut leaves scattered over
the wet stone pavement in the yard behind this house that have
released this group of memories. The armchair and Dickon's study
fade to nothingness. I sit again in the punt with a row of glossy
brown conkers all neatly bored beside me. I have bored them with a
long nail rather tediously and have had to be careful of the palm
of my hand. One or two I have broken. There are leaves in the
bottom of the punt, and a thin and scattered remnant clinging
insecurely here and there among the branches about me. I have been
seeking a perfectly golden leaf without a patch of green or brown
upon it, I have tried the taste of a horse-chestnut and have
disapproved of it and spat out and watched the fragments of my
mouthful sinking slowly and eddying down through the clear water
and thought how queer it was that some should spin and whirl about
and some sink swift and straight, and I have wondered if the
hooflike end of the leaf-stem accounts for the name of the tree.
And now I am sitting motionless, suddenly aware of the tremendous
quiet of the day.</p>

<p>It is as if the whole world paused. It is as if God was present,
God whom they talk about so much in church....</p>

<p>Yes, I am almost as much back there as I am present in this
room. Perhaps for the first time in my life I observed serenity on
that day.</p>

<p>Half a century ago that was, right at the other end of life, and
it is more vivid than yesterday. That must have been our first year
at Mowbray in the beginnings of my strange father's last burst of
success before his tragic downfall. We went to Mowbray from
Bexhill, and everything was new and larger and finer about us.</p>

<p>I was nearly eight then, and at Mowbray I seem to have awakened
quite suddenly to beauty and wonder. I do not recall any perception
of beauty and loveliness at Bexhill. I think the summer must have
been exceptionally fine and kindly. At that age I was entering upon
a fresh phase of development, and the novelty and spaciousness of
the new life stimulated me. As I sit here brooding at this
writing-pad I live again a score of vivid, small, and yet intensely
significant moments, and most of them are in the open air in the
park and particularly round and about the great pond. Hardly any
are indoors. I do not recall very much of the Mowbray interiors.
Indoors at that time, I think, I was always reading, reading,
reading.</p>

<p>In that punt it was I first became aware of the science of
optics. I discovered something remarkable about the handle of a
little fishing-net that I had put into the water. I was holding it
quite still in the hope of presently whipping it up with some
minnows, and I perceived that it was bent sharply at the surface of
the water. I forgot the minnows and began to move the net to and
fro and higher and deeper. It seemed bent, but it was not really
bent. The bending shifted as I shifted the net. I puzzled over that
distortion.</p>

<p>And in that old punt I puzzled over the riddle of reflection as
well as of refraction. I found that if I crouched down with my nose
just above the side of the punt I saw nothing of the bottom at all,
only blue sky and tree branches. Then, as I rose, suddenly the
still bottom with its roots and dead leaves and slimy weeds and the
shoals of minute fish hovering above it came into view. I
experimented. I extended and retracted myself. I tried to catch the
exact moment between squatting and standing, when the mirror became
transparent and the bottom appeared.</p>

<p>There was an afternoon at Mowbray, it must have been earlier in
the year, in the summer, when I first discovered forget-me-nots. At
the upper end of the pond near where the stream came in there were
shallows and floating masses of green weed with pink blossoms and
thick, widespread clumps of sedges, and half hidden amidst these
sedges were clouds of flowers of a divine, incredible blue. Either
I had never seen forget-me-nots growing before or I had never
observed them. I went to and fro, peering from the bank, and then
took off my shoes and stockings and waded into the water and mud
until my knickerbockers, in spite of all the tucking up I gave
them, were soaked. And I picked handfuls of these the loveliest of
all English wild-flowers.</p>

<p>Then suddenly came horror, the unqualified horror of childhood.
My legs were streaming with blood. The sharp blades of the sedge
leaves had cut them in a score of places. Fresh gouts of blood
gathered thickly along the cuts, and then darted a bright red
ribbon down my wet and muddy skin. "Oh! Oh!" I cried in profound
dismay, struggling and splashing back to the bank and still holding
my forget-me-nots with both hands.</p>

<p>Still do I remember most vividly my astonishment at the
treachery of that golden, flushed, and sapphire-eyed day.</p>

<p>That it should turn on me!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec4" name="b1-sec4"></a>§ 4. INFANTILE</h2>

<p class="first">THINKING of one's childhood is like opening a
great neglected volume haphazard and reading in it. There must be
many thousands of such pages that I might turn over, still bright,
still fresh. The earliest pictures are the most fragmentary; they
are vignetted in the unknown. One very early moment of
self-discovery comes to mind when I was lying naked on my back
gazing in a sort of incredulous wonder at my belly and knees. That
must have been at Bexhill, although I have forgotten the
background, and I could not have been more than three years
old.</p>

<p><i>"Me?"</i> I thought.</p>

<p>Use and wont have dulled that first astonishment at the
conscious sight of my body, but I still retain something of the
early incredulity. Mine is that baby body still, though my
grandchildren would not believe it if I told them so; it is
changed, but not out of recognition, it is younger than my face,
yet in quite a little while now I shall see it for the last time
and cease to see or feel it any more, and it will be altogether
finished with, material for the undertaker and the crematorium. And
that, I suppose, will be the end of all the pictures, and the
volume will never be added to nor opened again. I know of no attic
or storeroom to which that great tome will go&mdash;even to
moulder. It will, it seems, vanish.</p>

<p>I stare at this prospect in very much the same mood of wonder in
which I stared at my foreshortened body fifty-odd years ago. My
approaching disintegration is even more amazing than my realised
appearance.</p>

<p>I think that discovery of my body must be one of the earliest
pictures in my volume. But these vignettes of one's infancy are not
firmly bound in nor properly arranged. Perhaps I was put to
meditate upon that bed quite frequently. I remember my pink belly
and the fat knees and toes that I recognised as myself, and how
that then or later&mdash;it is not distinct&mdash;I discovered a
most remarkable and most unaccountable button in the middle of my
belly. At that point, though I did not know it, I had been cut off
from the tree of life and made a separate individual.</p>

<p>Mixed up with that exploration of my navel is the hard long line
of the rail of the bedstead and a memory of my mother standing at
the foot of the bed and strange and startling thing for my infant
intelligence to realise&mdash; weeping very bitterly. I do not
think I said or did anything about that, probably my mother never
imagined I had observed it, but I remember it very plainly.</p>

<p>All these impressions are bright and immense in my mind. The
later things in my life, even when they are as vivid, are not as
large. This I perceive is the common lot; nearly all
autobiographers are disposed to develop the childish or adolescent
experiences out of all proportion to the central realities of the
life. But I shall not do that here; it is the maturer relationships
with which I am concerned.</p>

<p>For a time I must discontinue making these notes altogether, for
old Sir Rupert York has rung me up. He has discovered I am in
London, and this dismal downpour has afflicted him so that he
cannot endure to be alone. He must not stir abroad in the wet, so I
shall break my resolution to keep in this room to-day and go out
and lunch with him. I must make my apologies to Madame Deland.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec5" name="b1-sec5"></a>§ 5. SIR RUPERT YORK</h2>

<p class="first">"WONDERFUL" is certainly the word for Sir Rupert;
he is close upon eighty, but his mind is as bright as it has ever
been. He talks and moves slowly, and he confesses that he feels no
longer disposed to work hard and is easily tired by any effort, but
he misses no point in one's talk and his thought is candid and
serene. On his desk were drawings and a photograph and a
plaster-cast of a gorilla's foot; some American has been writing
unwisely of the use of the ape's big toe in walking, and Sir Rupert
has been demolishing him, patiently, unhurryingly, and completely.
He is also feeling his way towards the use of a peculiar sort of
early stone implement with a beaked end, and the room is littered
with speCImens.</p>

<p>He looks better than when I saw him last two years ago. Then he
seemed to me to be greatly fallen away, and his skin had that
rather shrivelled white delicacy that comes with age; now either I
was prepared for it or it has really recovered tone and texture. He
ate a good lunch; he is still far from the days of digestive paps,
and in spite of the wet he came out on his doorstep without
thinking of a coat to stand and smile his farewell.</p>

<p>Big and smiling he is and in some subtle way noble, and it is a
comfort to me to have been with him, for in his case at any rate
old age has not meant a lean and slippered egotism and jealousy of
youth.</p>

<p>I told him about my project of writing a book, and he confessed
he had had similar thoughts. They have come to nothing with him
because rostrocarinate implements and suchlike riddles are more
interesting to him than himself. But it was curious to see how
different was his conception of autobiography. He is the least
metaphysical of men; he has no doubts of the reality of our world
of time and space; he will not trouble his mind with any
speculations about his identity or consider any system outside the
universe of science; he is even disregardful and a little impatient
with the later analyses of modern physics. And the story he would
tell would be a matter-of-fact record beginning with a sturdy boy
full of material curiosities, fascinated by the discovery of
strange mammalian bones in the Crag, and going on from that to
collecting, to the systematic study of geology and morphology, and
so to a fair full life of material gathered, generalisations
sifted, facts insisted upon, and false conclusions exposed. I have
always had a great affection for Sir Rupert since years ago we dId
some work together on the fracture of flints and bones; he had
asked me to help him with an optical examination of flint under
strain; and he still seems to me in several ways the greatest
scientific man I have known, the greatest and the simplest. He is
as simple as some fine animal that has grown to its full
development under favourable conditions.</p>

<p>My own scientific work gives me the measure of his. He makes me
feel no better than an excursionist in this world of science in
which he is a prince. An excursionist or a prospector. I was not
simple after his fashion. Wonder touched me as it did him in
boyhood. It was not fossils that seized upon my imagination, but
the riddle of double refraction and the perplexities of what we
still thought of in those days as the "shapes" of atoms and
molecules. Some of my work was quite respectable. Other men have
gone along the road I opened; it was a sound piece of road. But I
did not keep on wholeheartedly. In the end I deserted science
altogether, as I shall have to explain. I am what passes for a rich
man, an industrialist. I am one of the active directors of Romer,
Steinhart, Crest and Co., and I have a share and a voice in most of
their affiliated activities. I hold a considerable number of
patents, and I am an exploiter of secret processes, which I
recognise are offensive to science. The essence of science is open
statement. During the war I was what they called an expert, and
after the war I was foolish enough to dabble in politics. I thought
a new and greater age was beginning and that the war had taught us
a lesson. It did. But the lesson is slow in digesting, and I have
experimented and tried this way and that in my effort to express
and realise my conception of it. And I have let women deflect my
life very considerably. I have been greedy for property and freedom
and influence and for many sorts of experience I had better have
avoided. But Sir Rupert with a large modesty and devotion has gone
on serving the truth in that field to which he was called.</p>

<p>I do not think there has ever been any great conflict of motives
in his life. Quite early and quite without reservations he
determined to give himself to natural history. Other things have
had to accommodate themselves to that. His circumstances made the
gift easy; Professor Huxley was a frequent visitor to his home and
Charles Darwin patted his head. And to be a naturalist then was a
great adventure; science had challenged tradition and dogma, and
the warfare that followed in the minds of men was an epic warfare.
We live in the liberties of thought that were won for us then. He
has never married, and though I suspect him of no excesses of
chastity, I perceive that the mixture of sexual need and the hunger
for a dear companion that has so disturbed me has had no equivalent
influence upon him. Nor has he ever displayed any religious impulse
beyond an upright, unswerving devotion to his sense of truth. He
has accepted the work that lay before him single-mindedly, living
comfortably and happily and without any sense of sacrifice. He has
done that work magnificently. Abundant it has been, and sound and
wide, and strictly within the limitations of things as they plainly
are. He questions so ably because he accepts so completely. Before
I went to him to-day I had intended, forgetting a little his
quality, to put my conception of the provisional reality of life
before him and discuss it with him. Such an exchange would be as
possible with a pensive lion in the Zoo.</p>

<p>Ever and again, as we talked together and ranged from this to
that, he would return to gnaw the bones of his American professor.
"You see," he would resume in a pause, "if anyone had been trying
to make a case and deliberately faking the photograph, he could not
have put the foot in a better light for his own ends than this
fellow has done. If he made the photograph. But did he? He doesn't
say whether he did or not. It may be the other way round. He may
just have seen it somewhere and picked it up and run away with a
misconception. That's not so bad. Then he's merely
careless&mdash;and obstinate. He wanted to take up an original
point of view and this made it seem plausible. But while this cast
here of mine is from a living gorilla, <i>his</i> sketch is made
from a photograph of doubtful origin of a foot which I am fairly
certain has been taken out of spirits.... Queer.... All through he
shows a sort of eagerness....</p>

<p>"Some of these Americans live too near the newspapers. They get
the headline spirit. They want to make startling discoveries and
startling reversals in a hurry....</p>

<p>"One has to understand one can't do that sort of thing....</p>

<p>"They must live under bad conditions over there. I don't
understand what sort of surroundings a biologist can have&mdash;in
a Western university, for example. They seem to be restless,
excessively sensitive to cheap judgments. Over
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Rupert paused and his manner became very earnest.</p>

<p>"They will let newspaper interviewers come into their
<i>discussions</i>!" he said. "They will let interviewers make
statements for them, and they will attend to the stuff interviewers
and paragraphists put on to other people. They seem to have no
feeling for precisions in such things.... This man seems to be
afraid to admit details that tell against him.... As though he
might lose something....</p>

<p>"And yet, <i>you</i> see, they will make the rashest
attacks....</p>

<p>"He brought it on himself."</p>

<p>He reflected for a moment and patted the plaster cast beside him
on the table, and regarded it with a benevolent expression. He had
brought it in from the study to the dining-room. He has the
charming habit of carrying about with him everywhere the implements
and bones that are interesting him. I have heard of him sitting at
a large dinner party with a polished rhinoceros bone from which he
would not be separated beside his plate, just as a child will
insist on sitting at meals with some very dear new toy on the
table.</p>

<p>He disentangled his mind from the cast and remembered his duty
as a host.</p>

<p>"You like this Château Margaux? 1917. Good year, 1917."</p>

<h2><a id="b1-sec6" name="b1-sec6"></a> § 6. "WILLE UND
VORSTELLUNG"</h2>

<p class="first">I WISH I knew more of the practical side of
literature. I suppose that after a craftsman has written six or
seven "works" he learns so well how to set about his business that
he writes on strongly and confidently from the very first word, and
has&mdash;I think Stevenson explains as much somewhere&mdash;the
end of his book latent in his opening paragraph. But I have been
beating about the bush for five sections and making notes for
various matters that must come in later, and still I doubt if I
have told anything at all about my world. Instead I have written
about my childhood and made a sketch of my host at lunch. It is
like the way one draws on the blotting-paper in a boardroom.
Unless&mdash;unpleasant thought!&mdash;it is the onset of the
garrulous stage.</p>

<p>I shall keep the morning's writing and this note upon Sir Rupert
at hand, but I shall try a fresh commencement here. Perhaps, after
all, the proper way is to go directly to the core of the matter.
Even though that may mean stiff going for a bit for both writer and
reader. How in the most general terms do I apprehend life?</p>

<p>Metaphysically I have never been able to get very far beyond
Schopenhauer's phrase: <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>.
Life to me as to him, when he wrote that title at least, is a
spectacle, a show, with a drive in it.</p>

<p>Is there a plot to the show; is it a drama moving through a vast
complexity to a definite end, or at any rate moving in a definite
direction? To that question the various religions have given their
various answers, and I will say at once that I have found none of
their answers satisfactory. There is some invincible fact or group
of facts outside of, or, positively inconsistent with all their
explanations. Yet every on.e of them has some half-truth in it for
me. Either the whole is too complex for me to perceive a plot or
recognise the one the teachers would have me see, or there is no
plot.</p>

<p>I admit a tremendous splendour, beauty, and delight in much of
the scenery. The lighting effects are superb.</p>

<p>For more than fifty years I have been turning the pages of the
book of sunsets and never have I wearied. The texture and quality
of the costumes, the subtlety, charm, and humour of the cast again,
are often amazing. I rejoice perhaps excessively in the loveliness
of the bodies in which we are clothed. But plot to hold together
this vast display in one comprehensive system I cannot see. My mind
seeks it and needs it; the spectacle remains incoherent in spite of
all my seeking.</p>

<p>It is like one of those rummage-sale outbreaks of disconnected
cleverness they give in the theatres nowadays and call revues. And
some of the scenes and some of the actors are infernally dull, some
of the cleverness is harsh and base, some of the turns bore to the
limits of endurance, ugly and offensive things come on and spoil an
act and will not go off for all my manifested disapproval. And like
an Elizabethan gentleman I am upon the stage and not in the
auditorium, and ever and again my stool is kicked from under me and
I have to answer an unexpected cue, pull myself together, as people
say, and improvise a part. Passive or active, I am always in the
centre of this show of mine.</p>

<p>The shifting values of the scene at any particular moment, the
distribution of importance and quality, come, I perceive, mainly
from three groups of things. Firstly, there is what is fed to
us&mdash;<i>dietary</i> shall I call it?&mdash;in which I include
not only meat and drink and the want of them, but the reception or
lack of all we can inhale or inject into our systems, fresh air or
unexpected ideas. Secondly, come <i>infections and injuries</i>
bodily and mental, and their feverish distressful stimulations.
Thirdly, there is <i>irradiation</i>, by which I mean all that we
call the weather, and heat and cold and sounds and light, and those
subtler magic rhythms of colour and harmony that flow through eyes
and ears and the substance of my body, to exalt or debase me. These
three groups of things charge my life with its current quality and
determine whether the mood of my part shall be urgency or valiant
resistance, gay confidence, anger, repose, or despair. They
determine, too, whether the tone shall be strong or weak,
concentrated or diffused. There seems to be little or nothing in me
that can resist these determinations. But manifest through all the
phases they create there is an intermittent urgency of
self-assertion and aggression upon which my poor simplifying and
integrating human mind imposes a unity and continuity. This is the
Me.</p>

<p>This urgency is, in the broader sense of the word, sexual: in
that broad sense of the new psychology which makes sexual almost
co-extensive with racial. Its drive is the drive of what Shaw calls
the "life force" and Schopenhauer the "will to live." But it is
concentrated about my egoism and divided off from the general life
force of the world. It is protean; it involves an anxiety for
present and future things outside myself, it seeks expression and
recognition and response. Occasionally it becomes barely and
plainly a clamour for woman. But I speak for myself&mdash;it is
reluctant to <i>embody</i> its desire in any particular woman for
any length of time. Even when desire has run&mdash;as it has done
once or twice in my life&mdash;deep and narrow and direct and
passionate for a particular woman, my rationalising mind has still
b:e.n disposed to invent generalisations that broadened and
mItIgated the intensity of that desire. There is a counterbalancing
disposition of this force to admit the claim of a wider obligation,
and to reconcile the narrower and intenser drive with that. This
widening has increased with the years; the sexual has become more
racial, and the will to live for myself has changed more and more
into a will to live for life.</p>

<p>Such are the ingredients of my role in this tremendous,
terrifying, delightful, exciting, unequal, indifferent, and
irrelevant revue of existence. This is my personal analysis of
life. This is the composition of my life as it presents itself to
me. These are the threads of the stitches in the tapestry, the
elements of my hours.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec7" name="b1-sec7"></a>§ 7. IMMORTALITY</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN the curtain of death comes down, is the
<i>revue</i> over?</p>

<p>So far as William Clissold goes, I think it is. I think that
death is a thing I shall never experience, for when it comes to me
I shall be dead. I may see it coming, I may hope for it or fear it,
but I shall never know it come. I shall never know it has come just
as I never know that sleep has come. I do not believe in personal
immortality. In my youth I struggled against the idea of individual
extinction, but now I accept it quite tranquilly. I think there may
be something immortal in me, and what that is I will do my best to
explain in subsequent sections, but I do not think that immortal
part contains any of the distinctive factors that individualise me.
The sound of my voice, the oddities of my mind, my likes and
dislikes, and the great volume of my personal memories will, I
think, end when my heart ceases to beat.</p>

<p>I have still enough greediness for personal experience to want,
if not complete immortality, at least a little extension of my
time. I am like a well-behaved child who is willing to go to bed
but would prefer to sit up a while longer. But I can find no tittle
of evidence that experience goes on after physical death. The
phenomena of fainting, sleep, and unconsciousness all sustain my
conviction that the immobility of the dead is also subjective. And
I am quite unable to imagine any sort of living at all, any sort of
conscious existence, without hands that feel, eyes that see, a
sense of material substance, and a stir of bodily feeling. It is
not strength but weakness of the imagination that enables people
,to think of themselves as bodiless "spirits." The idea that man is
a threefold being of body, soul and spirit, all separable and
mysteriously endowed with his personality, seems to me a survival
of remote barbaric speculations. I can no more think of myself
living on as a spirit than as living on as a moving photograph.</p>

<p>The decay of the established religious beliefs which wrapped the
life after death in a sacred reticence has let loose much popular
necromancy. I was sufficiently involved with these curiosities at
one time to be a member of the Society for Psychical Research and
to follow up some of the alleged evidence for personal survival
after death. I found evidence of much deception and still more
self-deception. And even if I had admitted the reality of all the
phenomena tendered, which I would be very loth to do, they would
have proved nothing except the survival of fragments of personal
will and memory. Suppose a medium to produce some trivial secret
between myself and some departed intimate, known to no one else;
that no more proves that my friend is still mentally alive than a
corrupting fragment of his face with a characteristic scar would
prove his bodily survival. The mere fact of the medium being in
possession of this confidence suggests helplessness and
insensibility in the departed. Generally the supposed messages from
the dead display great mental degeneration. The mediums produce no
more than a shrivelled phantom of the sought-after dead. When
Victor Hugo was summoned back from the shades, Anatole France told
me, he had forgotten <i>Hernani</i> and <i>Ruy Blas</i> altogether,
and acquired nothing to make up for this but the sort of moral
platitudes one might get from an intoxicated concierge. If we are
to believe the stuff at all, we must believe on the evidence that
the next life will be no better than a tattered fragment of this. I
had rather have the flame of my life extinguished at once than
turned down and down to flicker at last in such a fashion.</p>

<p>The revelations of Sir Oliver Lodge's <i>Raymond</i> and of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle and the lucubrations of Mr. Vale Owen confirm
this view. The effect is not so much as if they had drawn the veil
from a vision of deep and mighty things, as that the curate has
bought a cheap magic lantern and got an enthusiastic and humourless
spinster to daub his slides. I am prepared to believe the universe
can be deeply tragic and evil or wonderful and beautiful, but not
that it can be fundamentally silly. On the whole my presumption
that there is nothing immortal in our individualities is
strengthened rather than weakened by the evidence of this cloud of
all too explicit witnesses to the contrary that has arisen in the
past few years.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec8" name="b1-sec8"></a>§ 8. CRYSTALLINE, ATOMIC,
DIMENSIONAL</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH this is all that I can make of life, my
mind is not entirely content to rest at this. I do not think that
life is as entirely chancey and miscellaneous as my statement may
seem to leave it. I do not believe that it is a succession of moods
and impulses in an aimless confusion. There is order in the
universe; there is law, essential and inexorable law. It is law
outside of and independent of our wills, and perhaps irrelevant to
our wills. But it is there.</p>

<p>It is not, I think, a habit of mind derived from early religious
teaching that sustains this belief. It is much more closely related
to the assumption of my scientific work. The world is in the nature
of rational and explicable. At the same time it is not in any way
subservient to human feelings and human ends.</p>

<p>I am reminded of a dear little grey kitten I had last
year&mdash;I hope I have her still&mdash;at the Villa Jasmin. She
was much intrigued by my cheval glass. She saw her reflection in it
and she was greatly perplexed because she could not get at it. She
struggled with the riddle. It was clear to me that she believed the
damned thing could be understood. But it was more and more evident
to me that her nice, quick, and in many ways very clever little
brain had nothing at all in it to enable her to apprehend the
nature of a reflection. She would pat the glass with her
paw&mdash;after a time she patted the glass and did not attempt to
put her paw through it&mdash;and then dodge round very quickly
behind the mirror. Then still more quickly she would return to the
front. She would stiffen her legs and bristle her hair and stalk
off in a silly endearing way she had. It was just as though she
raised her eyebrows and shrugged her shoulders. It was in the
spirit of that grimace. She would give it up and affect boredom and
go out of the room. And come back presently to give it up again.
She gave it up on different days, a dozen times perhaps. By now she
has probably given it up altogether.</p>

<p>But though she cannot understand it the thing can be understood.
That is the tantalising aspect of my own insufficiency. If I were
God enough I might so contrive it, not by adding anything
absolutely fresh to her ganglia, but simply by strengthening and
expanding one or another faculty, that she would theorise about
light&mdash;to the Newtonian level. And with a little more
knowledge and training to the level of Einstein and Weyl. And if
there were a God above me, and it is just as possible as not there
are intelligent beings above me capable of watching my mental
proceedings just as I watch hers&mdash;how should I know about them
if there were?&mdash;I too might be expanded to&mdash;anyhow, a
larger sphere of comprehension.</p>

<p>I have always had a persuasion that I have never got anything
like its full possibilities out of my brain. Even for what it is,
it may not be anything near its maximum of effectiveness. Ever and
again I have been astonished to find myself in a phase of
exceptional lucidity, I have seen my way through a game of chess or
grasped a mathematical problem with a directness quite beyond my
normal possibilities. Or I have had a rush of creative energy, and
invented lovely things very rapidly and expressed them with
unpremeditated skill. Something happened then to my brain, some
exceptional aeration or other stimulation. It showed what it could
do. But all the time it was no other than the rather foggy and
uncertain brain of my everyday life. It is quite conceivable that
our present atmosphere is not the best of all possible atmospheres
for the working of the human brain, nor the normal current in our
arteries its most stimulating food.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Venus, if there are any inhabitants upon that
steamy planet, see no sun in their sky. There is, the astronomers
suppose, a complete cloud shell between its surface and outer
space. Life beneath that canopy must be life in the hot twilight of
a tropical forest; daybreak must be a mere rosy or orange
brightening of the grey, and night a darkling into blackness. But
perhaps there are storms there, and then on some rare occasion that
flocculent, dense welkin may be rent and swept aside, and the stars
may shine or the naked sun blaze down upon the tossing, waving
jungle. A thousand things, faintly suspected, dimly apprehended
hitherto, must be revealed for a little while, stark and plain.</p>

<p>But my everyday mind is a cloudy and misty mind. I grope, I do
not see. So far as I can judge, most of my fellow-creatures are
groping too, and many of them do not even suspect this possibility
of clairvoyance. They think that what they do with their minds is
all that can be done with their minds. I do not agree, but I have
never worked out any very effective rules for bettering my mental
operations. I have never been able to trace to my own satisfaction
the causes that brought about those rare occasions of exceptional
brilliance. I have never secured any command over them. But they
have filled me with the haunting sense of something quite graspable
if only I could close my fingers upon it, something just a very
little way beyond my reach, quite visible had my eyes but a tithe
more sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Yet even if some hitherto unsuspected God were to pour
illumination into my mind so that, with all that intense
realisation of beauty which is inseparable from discovery, a
hundred obdurate riddles dissolved into obvious necessity, still I
should have made, I feel, only one more step up an endless
staircase. My kitten, could I put Newton's brain in control of its
furry paws, would even then be patting pebbles on the margin of an
illimitable ocean.</p>

<p>It has been necessary for me to keep in touch with current
speculations about the constitution of matter, the nature of time
and space. I have watched physical science, sternly
self-disciplined, probing further and further, not only from
ordinary human understanding, but from ordinary human feeling. The
analysis of matter, in the last quarter of a century, has reached a
point when it has ceased to be in any human sense wonderful. It is
incomprehensible. Every statement is a paradox; every formula an
outrage upon common sense. One is left baffled as by the
hieroglyphics of some insane scribbler. In my curious childhood,
when I browsed among what were then already old-fashioned books in
the Mowbray library, I read of atoms and molecules almost as kindly
and human as Dutch cheeses. I write Dutch cheeses because I
remember how later&mdash;I was just twelve and my mother had taken
Dickon and me for a sudden furtive holiday in Holland to escape, as
I realised years afterwards, from the sight of newspaper placards
proclaiming the Clissold Smash, Clissold in the Dock, Clissold's
Cross-Examination&mdash;when I saw the golden cheeses piled all
over the market place, and the quaintly costumed porters carrying
them in exact geometrically arranged batches to and fro between the
gaily painted barges and the market, it seemed to me that in quite
that fashion it must be that molecules moved about, and the atoms
of matter combined and were distributed and re-combined. Everybody
in those days thought of atoms as tangible things, and of space as
a framework of three dimensions as rectangular as a window sash.
The ether, the now vanished ether, wrapped about us like a garment,
and time was like a star and dwelt apart. I remember when I was a
science student, greatly torn between my search for knowledge and
the urgent need of escaping from the wreckage of our family
disaster, that in the college debating society we were already
discussing the ideas of time being conceivable as a fourth
dimension, and of a limit existing to material rectitude and
exactness of repetition.</p>

<p>Since then all those easy old imaginings of quasi-tangible atoms
and infinite incessant space have dissolved away insensibly. We
have followed our deductions further and further into a stirring
crystalline complex of multi-dimensional curvatures and throbbing
reactions. Energy is and it is not, and then again it is, all Being
flickers in and out of Not-being, there is an irrational bound set
to motion, there is a limit to the range of temperature. Space is
bent in some incomprehensible fashion so that straight lines
re-enter into themselves, gravitation is a necessary consequence of
duration, and atoms are the orbits and harmonies of infinitesimal
electrical charges. Einstein's own description for popular
enlightenment of his space-time system with its bent and possibly
unstable co-ordinates, reads to me like the description of a clear
vibrating four-dimensional haggis. Weyl goes wider and further, and
Bohr has imposed a rippling intermission upon the whole universe.
In the depths or heights of physics, for one word seems as good as
the other when all direction is lost, I find my mind sitting down
at last exhausted of effort in much the mood of Albrecht Dürer's
<i>Melancolia</i>. I have gone far along that way, and I can go no
farther into that wilderness of vanishing forms and puffs of energy
in a quadri-dimensional field of force.</p>

<p>The science of the elements is becoming too difficult for
ordinary men to grasp&mdash;which must gratify every intelligent
priest. But the mystical God of force and substance&mdash;if one
may use the word "God" for so remote a conception&mdash;to whom the
endless winding staircase. of molecular science mounts for ever and
never attains, is, I feel, no priest's God of sentiment and
morality, no friend of man and pitiful judge of our peccadillos,
but a God of austere complexity, a God of variable and evasive
rhythms and unfathomable intricacy, the God of a philosophical
mathematician.</p>

<p>I note as I write this that something has passed insensibly out
of my mind since my youth, and that hitherto I have not observed
its departure. And that is, <i>the awe of the inorganic</i>. During
my student days I was drawn by an overwhelming fascination to the
lovely facts of crystalline structure, and particularly of double
refraction and the interference of light. I went into these
mysteries exalted and intoxicated with wonder. Partly it was an
intellectual exultation; but partly it was sensuous, like the joy
women find in the deep beauty of precious stones. Did I, in those
days, in some faintly anthropomorphic way regard the glittering
planes and beams and passages and patterning in those translucent
depths into which I pried, as being accessible, as being physically
accessible? Did I somehow conceive of myself as presently walking
out of the ordinary paths of everyday into those magic palaces?</p>

<p>At any rate I cannot bring back any. remnant of that wonder now.
Neither in that connection nor in connection with that other
profundity, space. There was a time, a rather earlier time in my
life, when my little soul shone and was uplifted at the starry
enigma of the sky. That has gone; gone absolutely. I could not have
imagined that it would ever go. While I was still a little fellow
at Mowbray I remember looking at the stars one winter night upon
the terrace&mdash;it must have been a night in winter because Orion
was there&mdash;and I was in an ecstasy. I was rapt in a passion of
wonder. I was lost to all other feeling. I had slipped out without
a coat and did not care that afterwards my governess scolded me. F
or a time I did not hear her calling close at hand. But now I can
go out and look at the stars as I look at the pattern on the
wall-paper of a railway station waiting-room. About them I have
become prosaically reasonable. If they were not there, there would
be something else as casual, as indifferently sublime.</p>

<p>The more I have learnt about them the more coldly aloof from me
have they become. What has happened to me? Is it the story of my
little grey kitten over again? Have I grown tired of patting behind
the glass?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec9" name="b1-sec9"></a>§ 9. DISINTEGRATING
PROTESTANTISM</h2>

<p class="first">I RETURN from the <i>coulisses</i> of physics and
the deep dark outlook of astronomy, from the underworld and
outerworld of material mysteries, to the spectacle upon the
stage.</p>

<p>I have compared it in its casual in consecutiveness to a London
or New York revue. I cannot ignore the valiant attempts men have
made to impose a coherent and comprehensive story upon it, to
explain it as a drama with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
Judaism and Islam give good but inadequate histories of how it all
happened, and Christian teaching carries over some inexplicable
gaps very ably and bravely; Buddhism, too, tells a tale with a
curious affinity to the modern scientific spirit in its conception
of impersonal retributions and its recognition of vast aeons. But
Hindu thought is saturated with the cyclic delusion that things
come back again. As my vision of the world has grown plainer and
more assured, the last tinge of credibility has faded from these
various dramatic diagrams of the universe. They have followed the
fairies that I could still half hope to see and play with, when I
lay down amidst the bracken of Mowbray Park.</p>

<p>I wish I could recall more of my early religious life. It
developed in that late Victorian period when nothing had gone from
the creeds but everything had weakened; people still believed in
hell but did not like to have it talked about. Instruction was
vague and allusive. I should call my upbringing "disintegrating
Protestant." The idea of God was very much entangled with the
disciplines of my nurse and governess, and the most vivid memory I
have of the divinity teaching of my Bexhill days, was a highly
illuminated card in an Oxford frame bearing the words</p>

<p class="headline">"THOU GOD SEEST ME."</p>
<br>

<p>I believed that firmly, and it abased my private dignity to a
reluctant propitiatory restraint of my private thoughts. I would
try to pretend that I was not thinking something that I was
actually thinking. I was told repeatedly that I ought to love God,
but I cannot remember feeling the slightest gleam of affection for
that silent, invisible, dominating, and dangerous spectator.
Dangerous!&mdash;he could strike me dead, and was quite capable of
doing so. On some mere technical point. How could one love a Being
of that sort?</p>

<p>But certainly I never ventured to think that I did not love him.
I was too afraid of him.</p>

<p>So was Dickon, although he was more than two years older than I.
But we said very little about it to each other.</p>

<p>There was scant mention of the Crucifixion in our early
teaching. I was told of it as a harsh matter of fact, but it was
not dwelt upon. I saw pictures of it, and they filled me with
horror that God should permit it, and there was a lesson from the
New Testament read in church on Easter Sunday that dismayed and
depressed a small soul already suffering from a surfeit of very new
hot-cross buns. I was told to love this victim on the cross also,
and there was nothing in my heart to respond. I felt that as a
member of the deity he need not have put this dreadful thing upon
me.</p>

<p>It was some transitory governess who insisted upon my loving the
crucified one. I have forgotten her name, but she had a very long
body in a green dress, a thick pink neck that rolled up over a
slight swell of chin into a pink face, and a voice that impressed
me as being rich. She always seemed to be leaning forward. When she
found no spark of gratitude in us for the cross and thorns, she
tried another aspect of her faith, and showed us a brightly
coloured picture of Christ with a crowd of children about him and
one upon his knee.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't <i>you</i> like to come to him?" she said, watching
our faces for intimations of a response.</p>

<p>That estranged us in a different way.</p>

<p>I remember Dickon with his little freckled hands half thrust
into his first knickerbocker pockets, looking very obdurate and
saying nothing.</p>

<p>We wouldn't commit ourselves....</p>

<p>That is how I was taught about Jesus Christ. It is only in
recent years that a personality has emerged through that curtain of
mingled horror and mawkishness that was woven before him in my
childhood....</p>

<p>My mother went to church and had us go to church. Under
cross-examination she would perhaps have admitted finally, and with
qualifications and evident distaste, that she was a Christian, but
she would have agreed at once and cordially that she was a
Churchwoman, and even a "good Churchwoman." I do not recall any
occasion when she spoke to us herself of Christ or Salvation or any
such topic, nor did any of our nurses or governesses except that
one I have just mentioned. Our home had a religion, but it was an
extremely restrained religion; it was felt to have passed beyond
the bounds of delicacy; it was referred to rather than actually
produced. At church one did not listen much, and only the more
anaemic hymns were sung. Even those abbreviated Anglican services
seemed tediously unnecessary. "Now to God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Holy Ghost." I recalled my wandering thoughts. I might
move about again. Pouf! what a relief! Nevertheless, the idea of
God gripped me as a terrible idea.</p>

<p>For the life of me I cannot reconstruct the phases by which my
mind recovered from the suggestion of that all-seeing,
all-pervading, disapproving, and restraining deity. But when I was
a science student I was in full revolt against that obsession and,
more than a little scared at my own daring, I would invent "funny"
blasphemous stories about "my friend Mr. G." I would pretend to
have special communications and revelations from this mythical
person and to be exceptionally influential in my prayers. Sometimes
I would call him "the other Mr. G.," because in those days British
Liberalism was disastrously dominated by that astounding
irrepressible person Mr. Gladstone, and it was the custom of the
reluctant impotent party his energy hauled after him to refer to
him with a breathless reverential familiarity as "Mr. G." There was
a certain spice in confusing these two holy terrors, which lost
none of its savour when presently, during my student days, the
earthly Mr. G. embarked upon a ridiculously ignorant defence of the
Book of Genesis as a trustworthy summary of palaeontology. He had
so much the manner of a distinguished author replying to his
reviewers....</p>

<p>Professor Huxley, his antagonist in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> controversy, became a great hero to me, the valiant
anatomist, the grave white-haired, yellow-faced dean of our
college, who stood up alone and undismayed against both the Mr.
G.'s and exorcised them together from innumerable minds that had
formerly been oppressed by them.</p>

<p>I do not think enough attention has been given to the difference
of our religious reactions at successive phases in our development.
The great religions of the world come down to us from a time when
the average age was shorter, when the world was relatively fuller
of children and young people, when the emotional atmosphere was
more in the key of adolescence than it is to-day. Life was short
and thought was leisurely. Normally one believed what one was told.
There were few things that were recognised as new and there was no
appetite for novelty. The spirit of the times was against it. Ideas
trickled then; in our times they jet. Notes of interrogation, those
mosquitoes of the modern world, were scarcely known. Now they swarm
on every path and infect us with a fever of doubt. Only a very few
people grew out of the fears and beliefs they had acquired in
childhood. Now very many of us do, and our unembarrassed actions
and our freely expressed thoughts bring on the minds of many of the
young towards our own stage far more rapidly than they would have
come of their own accord.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to judge how far the current generation
is repeating the phases through which Dickon and I passed forty odd
years ago, and whether there is the same necessity to minimise an
early horror of God by familiar jesting. The edifying literature of
our boyhood was pervaded by the idea of Providence, a fussy,
uncertain, preposterous interference in human affairs, and we made
my Mr. G. a symbol for all the petty malignities and kindnesses of
the weather, and the chances of hill and road, and the turn of the
cards, for all those caprices of accident indeed that were then
called "Providential." And for every oddity of nature that jarred
with our preconceptions of dignified benevolence. Our Mr. G., by
our insistence on his human absurdity, became indeed a caricature
and a defiance of all anthropomorphic gods. "Upon any supposition,"
we would say of the hyena, of the wart-hog at the Zoo, or of the
slug in the salad, "why did Mr. G. make <i>that</i>? If he hadn't
been ashamed of his slug he wouldn't have hidden it in the lettuce
leaf. And what a sell if Eve had obeyed him! She had free-will.
What would he have done with all these nasty creatures? Discreated
them?..."</p>

<p>Dickon had a wonderful imagination of the Six Nights of
Creation. These, he fabled, came after the Fall. So Eve was
restored to her theological freedom. Mr. G., he represented, after
her vexatious indiscretions, in secret and much embittered,
sabotaged a once perfect universe; for six nefarious nights he
sabotaged it, put the taste of sin into his work, disharmonised
sounds, invented stinks, created all the disease bacteria, supplied
the wasps with stings, the Hies with unsavoury instincts, and
changed ten thousand once honest species into malignant parasites.
Dickon would lie in bed shrieking with laughter, unable for a time
to expound some new and still more awful dislocation that had just
occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Didn't care what he did!" choked Dickon. "He <i>was</i> wild!
Simply didn't care."</p>

<p>That old jest can still shock and please. Only this last June it
was that I expounded the moods and character of our Mr. G. to my
dear ridiculous Clem. We were walking up a winding, stony path, the
old road from this place to that unaccountable village of Gourdon,
which perches so high and splendidly above the Loup, and we sat
down at a bend in the road which gives a particularly good view of
the blue crests of the Esterel. In a flash she was up again with a
short, sharp scream, and more than half disposed to scold me for
the fact that she had put her hand upon a stunted little shrub
smothered in a seething mass of nasty little crawling things, soft
and distended purple larvae that were just exuding from the
cobwebby nest in which I suppose they had been hatched.</p>

<p>"That was Mr. G.'s bad hour," said I.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>The hour when the insects were made, an hour, I said, of
feverish, fiddling, cruel industry, a morbid muddling of matter
into life. "Well, wasn't it so?" I demanded, at the protest of her
raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>I dilated, in accents of reproach, upon the innumerable
varieties of insect species, upon their stings, bites, poisonings,
infections, burrowings into living flesh, cannibalisms and hideous
parasitisms, I enlarged upon the tortures they inflict and the
filthy preoccupations of their activities, their immense
destructiveness and exasperating uselessness. They and the spiders
and lice and all the noxious creeping things betrayed a morbid
streak in creation. "What was Mr. G. thinking of then? What was he
about? Before the Fall, you know! Before the Fall!"</p>

<p>It was better than the view to see Clem's face&mdash;at the
onset of an idea she ceases to be beautiful and becomes
elfin&mdash;manifestly scared but much more delighted by the
flavour of release in this new version of the Bridgewater
treatises.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, coming up bravely to my level, "your Mr.
G. made this view."</p>

<p>"And almost prevented your seeing it&mdash;by an ungentlemanly
trick."....</p>

<p>We grow out of belief. All children are naturally and
essentially believers. They begin with a sense of being completely
protected; they trust unquestioningly. A cared-for child cannot
conceive that there is a fundamental insecurity of life; that is an
idea outside its circle of thought.</p>

<p>It believes it is completely looked after and that all its
proceedings are known; if it is good it will be made happy, and if
it is naughty it will be punished. Only later does it begin to
chafe and question under the restrictions of the law, and even then
it doubts the justice of the control long before it doubts the
existence of the control. Much of this childish mind persists with
many people into middle age and even into old age. You will find
quite old people under some mishap cry out upon the injustice of
fate as though a promise had been broken. The other day I was told
that Margaret Payton, that valiant sceptic and most clear-headed
woman, had had a painful minor operation. Half submerged by the
chloroform she betrayed her older, still persistent,
preconceptions. "What have I <i>done</i>," she asked and asked
again and murmured and muttered, "that God should make me suffer
like this?... What have I <i>done</i>?... What right has God?... It
is not just to me."</p>

<p>But we who really go right through into the completely adult
stage come out at last beyond any sense of providence or
responsibility. We realise the complete indifference of the
universe to us and our behaviour. We know we are exposed and
unprotected. "The Lord is my Shepherd," said the Psalmist,
"therefore will I fear no evil" And again, "God is our refuge and
strength, a very present help in time of trouble." But I cherish no
illusions about my shepherd. F or good or evil no God is dogging
me. There is no shield at my back and no friend to guard me from
the ambush. But no-one reads my private thoughts before I can read
them myself as they well up in me. No-one holds me accountable for
my motives. No-one complicates my conscience and thwarts my will by
arbitrary imperatives.</p>

<p>If I tell the truth it is because lying seems to me a duplicity
or a treachery and I do not like it, and if I go out of my way to
be kind it is just as if I went out of my way to visit a pleasant
corner in a garden.</p>

<h2><a id="b1-sec10" name="b1-sec10"></a>§ 10. THE RELIGIOUS
MIND</h2>

<p class="first">IN my earlier harsher phases of disbelief, while
my conceptions of mental processes were still crude, I was very
severe in my judgments upon the teachers and priests and
professional servantS of a revealed religion that was manifestly
wrong in its revelations. I thought, for example, that it was only
necessary to go to a clergyman and explain to him simply and
clearly how this new Darwinism&mdash;how new it was in those
days!&mdash;had swept away the historical Fall of Man, the very
foundation of his scheme of salvation, to oblige him to cast aside
his clerical collar and his specially cut garments, and, leaving
them as a gift for any casual tramp, set out, in shirt and socks
and braces so to speak, upon a search for some less superseded
costume and some more justifiable occupation than the cure of
souls. And when I saw the churches still open everywhere, and the
preachers still preaching in the old terms and the congregations
standing up to sing the old hymns and kneeling down to pray in the
old confidence, I did not know whether most to blame the stupidity
or the dishonesty of mankind.</p>

<p>And I still recall quite vividly my fellow-student, Davidson, at
the College of Science, and how he would shrink and retract from my
efforts to talk about the theological applications of the new
biology. We shared a bench during the opening course of physics. He
would lose his wind like a punctured tyre at the mere intimation of
this topic; he would pant and his ears would grow red. He had a way
of turning from me at the bench so that of all his features I saw
just his red ear. It is only nowadays that I began to understand
the fear and disgust he felt for me. "I want to get on with my
work," he would gasp at last, and there was hatred in his eye. "I
don't want to talk to you. Not in the least.... Please, don't speak
to me, please."</p>

<p>Although he had been quite willing to talk about all sorts of
things before he discovered my heretical bent.</p>

<p>I do not know if Davidson is still in the world or whether he
may read this, but at any rate I will offer him my belated
apologies for my intrusions upon the sacred places of his mind.
They were sacred and they had no defences. I was already so much at
large then} and still so young, that I could not understand how
rooted and vitally entangled he remained. Religion is only formally
a thing of the intelligence; its substance is feeling and a way of
life. Every religion pretends to rest upon facts and statements,
but no religion really does so. The ordinary man has a private and
personal world which is more or less completely ensphered in his
religious beliefs, they give him a sense of being protected and of
being accountable and of having a definite personal importance in
the scheme of things. It is practically instinctive with him that
this sphere of assurance and confidence must not be shattered. If
it is, life will become as impossible for him as it is for the
chick of a prematurely broken egg. And so he resists, and, indeed,
becomes incapable of considering the most conclusive arguments
against the formula on which his security depends.</p>

<p>He will not have them even as a recognised error in his
world.</p>

<p>The other afternoon I was set thinking very vigorously by the
face and behaviour of a priest, a man perhaps twenty years younger
than myself, whom Clem and I found in the train at Vence. We two
had been walking over the hills since the early morning, and we
were very happy and a little tired and full of sweet air. We just
caught the afternoon train with a run, and we got in breathless and
a little clumsily and with a gasp of laughter; we threw a jest at
each other about my Mr. G.&mdash;he'd almost caught us that time
and had he meant to catch us or was it just his
playfulness?&mdash;and disputed a little about the position of a
cliff, the Baou des Blancs, marked on the map, and relapsed each
into our own thoughts. And then I became aware of this fellow.</p>

<p>He was not looking at Clem. I have never seen anyone not look at
anything with a more positive intensity. It was the exact converse
of a hard stare. He was not looking more particularly at her
flushed face and her pretty neck, his eyes were fixed on the
panorama outside the window and his brow was knit and his lips
moved&mdash;repeating some mental purge sovereign, I suppose, for
such occasions.</p>

<p>It was as if his inner world was opened to me. I contemplated it
as an explorer might do who has come over a crest to a tremendous
declivity and contemplates a strange land. For the first time I
think I realised fully the enormous distances between my peculiar
world and the worlds in which the greater part of mankind are still
living. I tried to put myself in his place and to imagine what sort
of thoughts my ordinary thoughts would seem to him if suddenly they
began to unfold themselves in his brain instead of mine, and what
it would feel like to him to find himself living involuntarily for
a day, let us say, as I live, neglecting all his offices, taking
all my freedoms.</p>

<p>I used to think that bishops and clergymen and priests and
teachers and all the Davidsons in the world doubted and went on
from doubt to disbelief, and meanly concealed their disbelief in
order to keep their incomes and positions. But indeed most of them
are as capable of plunging into a sustained criticism of their
beliefs as a passenger upon an ocean liner is capable of leaping
the two hundred odd feet from the promenade deck to the Atlantic,
in order to have a little swim in the sea. The liner has got him.
And their worlds have got all these people, and no little cracks of
inconsistent reality will be allowed to flood their mental holds
with doubt. At once the pumps :will get to work, the lips will be
busy in exorcism.</p>

<p>What was my priest thinking, down there beneath the mists of his
mind?</p>

<p>I doubt if his thoughts were very definite. Here was a life
different from his own, not merely in contrast with it, but in
antagonism to it, and yet it was happy and betrayed no sense of
Sin. It was evidently on the easiest terms with the hills and the
sun. It jested&mdash;had he some English and did he understand our
jest? And God permitted it! Suppose after one's years of meagre
fare and tedious observances and shameful clothing and meek bearing
and bitter and dismal restraint, suppose it should be that God
could tolerate such freedoms? Suppose that God was different from
what one had been taught? Suppose oneself too might have possessed
some such glowing slip of slender womankind? To do with as one
pleased! Help.</p>

<p>Ave Maria! Help! Such thoughts were perhaps too clear for him,
and yet I think a shadow after that fashion fell across his mind.
And he muttered his time-honoured Latin specific, "<i>Ave Maria,
gratia plena, Dominus tecum</i>," or some such stuff, and did not
look, oh! did not look.</p>

<p>My impression of this particular priest was that he was a fairly
good priest; he had a grey distressed complexion, he was untidy and
disturbed. But he was not disturbed enough to be dislocated. There
must be priests who have gone much further than he from the perfect
obedience of childish faith. There must be priests who neglect
offices systematically, who drink or smoke unseasonably or
excessively, or who have pilfered and continue to pilfer, who have
mistresses and sustain intrigues. Here in the South of France there
is much sly jesting about the priests' housekeepers. One sturdy
fellow over the hills associates almost openly with a past or
present mistress, goes to dine with her every day, and is the
father of her son. I am filled with curiosity about the inner life
of such priests.</p>

<p>I find it incredible that many of these sinful priests are
unbelievers. There must be a strange jumble in their minds, and
they must be accustomed to hiding themselves from the all-seeing
God to their own satisfaction amidst the jumble. They must try not
to think of him too closely. But they must feel that he is there
still, the Hound of Heaven upon their track. Probably they find a
consolation in exaggerating his mercy or in elaborating some
fantastic childish belief in a propitiatory saint, a saint who is
almost accessory to the offence. The good Saint Anthony will
balance the cooked accounts. The Blessed Virgin loved greatly and
is full of pity. God knows everything, it is true, but he ignores
much.</p>

<p>Dickon told me a story the other day which shows how curious the
jumble of a priest's world may become. Someone&mdash;Dickon or a
friend of Dickon's, whichever it was&mdash;had taken a room for the
night in an obscure and not too respectable hotel in a back street
in Brussels. I think a railway connection had been missed or
something of that sort, a cabman's advice taken too hastily, but I
forget that part of the story. I rather fancy that Dickon, too,
forgot that part of the story. In the dining-room was a priest, a
big fat grave paternal man, dining rather guiltily with a woman. He
had a rich unsubjugated voice, and he was doing his best to
restrain her too public manifestations of personal devotion.
Deponent's bedroom to which he retired some hours later, like most
hotel bedrooms, had doors, locked of course, which communicated
with the rooms on either side, and through one of these doors there
presently transpired&mdash;an excellent word in this
connection&mdash;the sounds of an acutely amorous encounter.
Deponent moved about noisily and coughed, but the passions at large
next door were too imperious for silence. They abated for a while,
but a fresh and more violent storm followed the lull. The unseen
lover, it became evident, was the priest who had been dining
downstairs. There could not be such another voice in the world. In
the morning he was visible in the corridor, departing, still grave,
still paternal. But before he departed&mdash;and this is really all
that matters in this distressing 'but necessary anecdote&mdash;he
was plainly audible, very gently and sincerely, giving his
fellow-sinner absolution for all that had occurred.</p>

<p>And she no doubt received it with an equal piety.</p>

<p>She, poor sinner, must have believed that that absolution was
perfectly valid, and so believing she was absolved and troubled no
other priest with the affair, but his case was not quite so simple.
There were highly technical points about the matter, points above
her understanding. She little knew what he had done for her. To
cover a carnal he had committed a mortal sin, he had absolved an
accomplice, and that the Church has very wisely forbidden. For a
week or ten days perhaps he must have remained in danger of
hell-fire, incapable of priestly functions, a man uncleansed. No
doubt he was in Brussels away from his parish&mdash;if he had a
parish. He confessed at once most probably, but absolution would
have been reserved&mdash;for some days. Automatically an
application must have been made to the bishop, naming no names, and
automatically a faculty given to absolve. Then this curious
transaction was completed and every shade of anxiety wiped from the
soul of the wanderer. He, too, was safe once more. He could go his
way in peace&mdash;until the next occasion.</p>

<p>He must have thought this out before and during his little
encounter. He must have found it necessary to reassure his frail
admirer. Perhaps he had not anticipated that necessity. How subtle
and wonderful is the power of the human mind over contradictions!
Both these people imagined they were living in the sight of God.
Both of them believed that they believed that God was seeing them
and seeing through them body and soul all the time! And both
believed that what they did was Sin and pointblank defiance of His
will.</p>

<p>Here again in this spiritual book-keeping and quittance, in this
simple deal between the carnal and the divine, is a glimpse of a
mental world as remote from my present state as the life of some
other planet from our earth's.</p>

<p>The human mind is at once complex and artless. Membership of a
great organisation like the Catholic Church, which continues to
fight for existence and power, must do much to develop the
instincts and assumptions of partisanship. A priest, even a gravely
erring priest, may still feel that he is on God's side and that God
is on his side. Against a Protestant and still more against such a'
sceptic as myself, it must be easy for him to suppose himself a
champion of God, and to feel in consequence a certain preferential
claim upon Him. And even when the evasion of God's all-seeing eye
has become habitual and loyalty has faded to nothing, that habitual
evasion and that chilled devotion will still be far from positive
denial.</p>

<p>I can imagine nothing more terrific than the outlook of a priest
who really permits himself to disbelieve and allows his disbelief
to be known. Before him are appalling difficulties and disciplines,
difficult interrogations, struggles with his own still deeply
rooted habits of submission, and at last expulsion into a vast,
wild, windy, uncharted world of change and unknown dangers. Its
usages are strange to him; it eats, dresses, washes even, in an
unaccustomed fashion. He has for his stock in trade his poor
ineffectual Latin learning. He left his family when he became a
priest, and he has no friends now, no circle at all. For a very
important part of the world, for the community naturally nearest to
him that he knows best, he will be now a man with a black mark set
against his name. To all the rest of the world he will be
<i>queer</i>. I do not know what the market price of an unfrocked
priest can be, but surely, unless he has what is called a "gift,"
he is among the cheapest of homeless men. Who will find work for
him? So I can understand that many a poor devil on the margin of
the Church and with thoughts of rebellion in his soul, has stared
out doubtfully at this greater world in which we live to-day, and
felt the beauty of its breadth and freedom and heard the call of
its ampler life, and then shivered and fled back headlong into the
close and cramping but less perilous fastnesses of the faith,
misapplying and crying, perhaps not altogether sincerely but with
heartfelt passion, that ancient appeal: "Lord, I believe. Help thou
mine unbelief!"</p>

<p>Were some one to discover some interesting well-paid employment
for ex-priests, I do not know what would happen to the Roman
Catholic Church. I believe it would collapse like a pricked sawdust
doll. Its personnel would come pouring out.</p>

<p>With less vivid contrasts and a milder quality of tragedy, the
inner history of a great multitude of people outside the Catholic
Church must be very similar to that of the doubting priest;
Anglican clergymen and ministers of Protestant sects and
schoolmasters and school-mistresses and the like, upon which the
continuous active practice of religion is imposed. But outside the
very precise and inquisitory disciplines of the watchful mother
church, there is much greater latitude of accommodation, and the
tragedy of apostasy is qualified by the comedy of
prevarication.</p>

<p>It is very easy for me to be uncharitable in these matters. And
perhaps I am. I have never had the least temptation to complicate
my own thoughts about faith and philosophy, and so it is difficult
for me to understand tortuousness in religion. What I believed and
professed did not affect my material everyday life in the least. I
had not even a friend who could be distressed by my opinions. It
happened so. Dickon and I fell out of a shattered nest at my
father's suicide, and if we found ourselves without any security we
also found ourselves without any restraints. This is unusual
freedom. Even the ordinary layman is obstructed in his
free-thinking by a tangle of associations, by fear of hurting
people he loves, by fear of offending people with whom he wishes to
stand well, by an indisposition to break habits and reconstruct his
days, and above all by the fact that as one goes out from formal
religious associations one goes out from a complete institutional
system into the wilderness, into a void. Negation has no schools,
no ceremonies. Marriage and birth and death and the education of
one's children must still, to a large extent, occur upon lines
originally religious. There has been no revolution in religious
opinion during the last hundred years, no new system ousting an old
system, but only a creeping change, a crumbling down and a release.
People drop one by one from perfect faith to imperfect faith and so
to exploratory doubt, but there is never a day when they say <i>en
masse</i>, "a new age has begun."</p>

<p>No new age has begun.</p>

<p>But while the Catholic Church, so elaborately organised, so
stupendously systematic, has to a large extent kept its footing and
stayed where it was, the Protestant world has passed through phase
after phase of insufficient adjustment and is still as unstably
adjusted as ever.</p>

<p>Throughout all my life there has been a great display of
Protestant teachers who, if they were not precisely pouring new
wine into old bottles, were at least trying to add just as much new
wine to the old wine and pour out just as much of the old wine to
make way for the new, as they thought the bottles would stand. The
bottles were rectories, vicarages, manses, schoolhouses, college
rooms, and cathedral closes; the bottles were habits and
associations; the bottles were the phrases of creeds and articles
that had become very familiar and sweet and dear; the bottles were
all sorts of things, the daily stuff of life. In my lifetime I have
seen Protestantism, wearing the same or but slightly more dandiacal
vestments, singing the same hymn tunes and sitting in the same
pews, part from hell, fluctuate upon the nature and gravity of Sin,
and play the most extravagant intellectual conjuring tricks with
the Trinity, now professing to swallow it, now making it vanish,
now reproducing it from the head or the elbow, expanding it to fill
the stage or rolling it up into a small round pillule. Nothing
could better illustrate the dominance of the daily circle of life
over its theories and explanations. There is not a heresy in the
whole cyclopaedia of Christian heresies that has not had the
privilege of the Protestant pulpit during my lifetime. The pulpits
creaked but remained. Their occupants remained.</p>

<p>From its beginning Protestantism was a departure. It goes on
departing. In my young days I was greatly exercised by Matthew
Arnold's modernisation of St. Paul, and I am still entertained to
find the anxious liberalising clergy trying to find recognition for
their guarded misinterpretations of the explicit old creeds in Mr.
Shaw's <i>Blanco Posnet</i> and <i>Saint Joan</i>, or extending an
uncertain experimental hand towards faith-healers and even towards
the spookeries of Sir Conan Doyle. Broad-minded Protestant
clergymen are the best of company for a long thoughtful talk in the
small hours. All things in earth or heaven become equally credible,
and nearly everything is symbolical of something else. In that
urbane atmosphere we discover after the flattest opposition that in
the end "we all mean the same thing." We never define what that is.
"We go to bed on that. I find Dean Inge particularly sympathetic.
He is a great modern Churchman, entirely honest but extremely
devious. He is elaborately uninforming about the Virgin Birth, and
courageously outspoken about birth control. His Gifford Lectures on
Plotinus betray in every passage his preference for the light
Moselle of Neo-Platonism to the emotion-loaded Port of Catholic
mysticism. I suppose if he and I were handed over to some
tremendous spiritual chemist and each ground to powder and analysed
to the last milligramme of his being, the report in each case would
tail off with, "Belief in a living personal God&mdash;slight
vestiges?" I met him a little while ago at a dinner-party and I
found him all that I had hoped to find him&mdash;liberal
Anglicanism incarnate, lean, erect, and&mdash;a little
discoloured.</p>

<p>I do not know how Protestantism will end. But I think it will
end. I think it will come to perfectly plain speaking, and if it
comes to perfectly plain speaking it will cease to be Christianity.
There is now little left of the Orthodox church except as a method
of partisanship in the Balkans. The League of Nations may some day
supersede that, and then the only Christianity remaining upon earth
will be the trained and safeguarded Roman Catholic Church. That is
less penetrable, a world within a world, it shields scores of
millions securely throughout their lives from the least glimpse of
our modern vision.</p>

<h2><a id="b1-sec11" name="b1-sec11"></a>§ 11. THE PARADOX OF
PHILIP GOSSE</h2>

<p class="first">PHILIP HENRY GOSSE, the naturalist, made the most
ingenious and delightful accommodation between his creed and his
scientific beliefs. I read about him ten or twelve years ago in
that little masterpiece, <i>Father and Son</i>, and my memory went
back to a book upon shore life adorned with delicately coloured
plates that I discovered in the library at Mowbray. When Sir Edmund
Gosse, the venerable critic and poet, was a small boy he used, as
he tells us in his memoir, to perch on a high stool and tint those
drawings of sea-anemones and sea-mice and sea-slugs for his father.
I am no collector, but for a time in my unsystematic way I sought
the works of P. H. Gosse; they are rare and expensive now; and I
read everything I could find of his. And so I learnt the completest
defence of the literal interpretation of the first chapter of the
Book of Genesis that has ever been made.</p>

<p>Gosse, the father, lived a simple, austere, and exalted
religious life, and was evidently very happy in it&mdash;after his
fashion. He followed the disciplines of the Plymouth Brethren. It
was a life founded upon the English Bible, upon the most complete
acceptance of the verbal inspiration of the English Bible. It was
necessary, if this life was not to be shattered, that he should
believe peacefully and fully in a special creation of the world in
the year four thousand and four B.C., in the establishment of the
first man and woman in a garden of Eden situated in Mesopotamia,
and in their almost immediate disobedience and misbehaviour. But
Gosse, the father, was also a naturalist, and as a naturalist
fossils and geological stratification forced themselves upon his
attention; he was obliged to be aware of the contemporary
controversy about evolution and to realise the existence of a mass
of evidence that pointed to an enormous past for the world and
life. A superficial mind might have considered he was in a hopeless
dilemma a Catholic might have been disposed to flee from natural
history as a peculiar invention of the devil and seek refuge in the
authority of the Church and Mr. Belloc, but Philip Gosse neIther
despaIred nor retreated. For some time perhaps he prayed and
wrestled with the difficulty; in the end he overcame it, lucidly,
simply, and completely&mdash;in a manner entirely Protestant.</p>

<p>For consider, he argued, what must be the conditions of creating
such a universe as ours. It would have to be created as a going
concern, for one can imagine it working from the outset in no other
way. The honey must be ready for the moth at the moment of
creation, the grass for the deer. The tree must be there for the
woodpecker with its leaves and fruit and bark and grubs complete.
Consider now the trunk of the tree. It must be a trunk according to
the nature that a tree must henceforth possess. There can be no
cheap methods for the Creator; he gives the best. That tree-trunk
therefore cannot be a flat stage-scenery trunk, nor a trunk of
featureless pulp-like plaster or marzipan; it must have the normal
structure of a tree trunk&mdash;that is to say, it must have annual
rings. What could the grubs of the woodpecker do in a plaster
tree?, And yet every annual ring would naturally indicate a year of
growth, a year of previous existence. A sceptical fool at the very
instant of its and his creation might declare therefore that that
tree was as many years old as it had annual rings. He would be
wrong.</p>

<p>Similarly every perennial in the garden of Eden, in the dew of
the first Sabbath morning must have borne the leaf-scars of leaves
that had never budded. At the root of every annual there must have
been the decaying scales of a seed that had never been sown. And
even Adam himself, at the moment of creation, must have been either
an imperfect man&mdash;which is contrary to all religion&mdash;or
he must have had a navel in his belly that had never linked him to
a mother, because he had never had a mother. Moreover, since the
animals directly they were created were living and modifiable and
reproductive, the idea of their procreation and descent was in that
instant made unavoidable; there was instantly projected into the
entirely imaginary past their logically necessary ancestry. Fossils
had to lie about in the rocks for the same reason that annual rings
had to exist in the first created tree. The Neanderthal bones and
the Cro-Magnon skulls, therefore, are no more proof of Adam's
possession of an ancestry than his navel was of his indebtedness to
a mother.</p>

<p>And so it must have been with the whole universe. Mountains of
limestone arose built up out of the skeletal remains of creatures
that had never really lived. The planets and stars spun out of
nothingness upon orbits they might have followed for an eternity
through phases of expansion and distortion, from nebula to
night&mdash;if things had been different. Adam opened his eyes and
saw the stars, all of them and in their order&mdash;though it takes
years for the light of many of them to reach the earth. God who
made the stars could make the ray. How else could it be done? The
appearance of an immemorial past in the material world, then, no
more disproves the simultaneous creation of everything at a
specific date than the vistas one sees in two mirrors that are set
face to face in a room prove that room to be an endless
gallery.</p>

<p>This is logically perfect. One may even carry it a step further.
For all that I can demonstrate to the contrary, I may have been
created even as I write here, created with the illusion of past
memories in my mind. Or the reader may have come into being in the
very act of reading this sentence.</p>

<p>By this, to me, quite flawless argument Philip Gosse disposed of
all the implications of Darwinism and could go on believing in the
special creation of the world and man as the Bible recounts it, and
in the doctrines that the Plymouth Brethren teach, and be able to
have fresh spiritual difficulties whenever he wished and wrestle
with the Lord in prayer in his evenings as he had been accustomed
to do, and remain still for all this weight of conviction an honest
naturalist collecting fossils and polyps among the rocks upon the
beach without concealment or prevarication.</p>

<p>He must, I think, have made his discovery of this wonderful way
out while he had been meditating, after the manner of the monks at
Mount Athos. At any rate it was Adam's navel and not the annual
rings of trees that had first directed him to his line of escape,
and so he called his book the navel, <i>Omphalos</i>, and wise men
still seek the surviving copies of it and read them and treasure
them.</p>

<p>But Philip Gosse was a man of exceptional mental power, and few
theologians have his clearness of head and his strength of faith.
At the London Natural History Museum Sir Rupert told me they seem
to show you Piltdown skull and Cro-Magnon remains and suchlike
things, but indeed what you are seeing are most carefully and
skilfully executed facsimiles. The originals themselves are locked
away in safes downstairs, secure not only from fire and lightning,
but from a far graver danger&mdash;the destructive arguments of the
Creator's less intelligent partisans violent in defence of their
threatened self-content.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec12" name="b1-sec12"></a>§ 12. LIFE RADIATES</h2>

<p class="first">I DO not find myself under the same necessity to
believe in a special creation of the universe as Philip Gosse, and
so my mind takes the easier course of accepting this appearance of
an immense antiquity&mdash;immense, that is, in relation to my
experience&mdash;for my world as real. The vast age of the world is
as real for my mind as my own individual existence. How far that is
to be considered real and what "real" may mean are, as I have
eXplained already, questions I have put outside my contemplation of
the spectacle of being altogether.</p>

<p>And as the theological explanations of this spectacle have lost
their grip upon me year by year and become unreal and incredible, I
find myself passing under the sway of an entirely different set of
ideas that seems to be taking hold of the modern imagination more
and more firmly. They are called creative ideas nowadays, and they
look for their justification not towards the past but towards the
future.</p>

<p>Philosophically I am quite prepared to admit that there is no
plot nor scheme nor drama nor pattern in the flow of events as they
are apprehended by human minds, but my disposition is diametrically
opposed to my philosophy. I have never encountered even a stain on
a wall or a glowing cavity in a fire upon which my mind could not
impose a design. It is still more natural for me, a moral being
inherently, to impose some dramatic conception upon my universe as
a whole&mdash;if only to get an orientation for my living, a
standard of Judgment by whIch to estimate the good or evil of my
decisions.</p>

<p>Now the outline that modern science, with an ever-increasing
assurance, develops upon this common-sense spectacle of space is
the story of progressive life. The black curtain of eternal
nothingness rises to reveal the stellar universe, a whirl of matter
like a puff of dust particles upon an immense scale, eddying
through the endless emptiness of space. On one of its spinning,
circling particles comes this life, at first not perceptibly more
than a stir of complex chemical reactions amidst a warm wet slime.
It is a new process in matter; presently it begins to display
desire and discrimination, to seek nourishment, to seek the light,
to move away from things unfavourable. At first it can exist only
in warm and shallow waters, but its ability to spread and reproduce
itself and to bring recalcitrant substance into the sphere of its
desire increases steadily.</p>

<p>I pause and set a note of interrogation against that "steadily."
I am not sure how far a case can be made out to show that life has
continually grown in range, in knowledge, in continuity of will, in
co-operative power. But there is much to support the assertion that
life has been uninterruptedly progressive from its first beginning.
The thrust towards greater range in space and time and an
ever-richer and fuller mental being has been continual. Progression
is not the same as proliferation; there have been secular massacres
of animal and vegetable life, in comparatively brief geological
phases thousands of species and genera have been swept away by
rapid geographical change and there have been ages of great
hardship for living things. But these severities seem always to
have sustained exceptional strides in adaptation and to have
prepared the way for a new phase of abundance upon a higher level.
The swampy vegetation and floundering, baskIng reptile life of the
Mesozoic Age was extinguished in perhaps a few hundred thousand
years of adversity, but it was swept away by the same changes that
presently evolved the grassy prairies, the rich forests, and
swarming herbivora of the Miocene. Life had won the hills and dry
places by the sufferings and disasters of that struggle, and now
feathered birds and furry beasts could push their way towards the
poles. The geological record, the archives of life's adventures,
does certainly seem to so amateurish a reader as I a
straightforward story of expansion and progress&mdash;and
particularly of expanding intelligence. That is the thing these new
views press most urgently upon me. Feeling appears, perception,
restraint, and judgment, eyes that see ahead, and limbs that pause
and hesitate. Mind grows&mdash;and grows at an ever-increasing
pace.</p>

<p>The first elements of mind were assembled slowly and painfully
through enormous ages. Among the invertebrata and among the lower
vertebrated animals it is improbable that there are inner worlds
beyond the scope of mere incidents; their most sustained mental
operations may have a depth in time of only a few hours, or even of
only a few moments, may be no more than a series of little puffs of
consciousness connected by no unifying ideal. The life of a frog or
a fish is probably a life of transient awarenesses dying away at
once after flight or feasting or fecundation into forgetting. The
probability of a greater continuity than that appears only with the
enlarging brains of the birds and mammals of the Tertiary Age.
Manifestly these brains brought something quite new into the
struggle, and thereafter the drama of life centred upon them. The
brains in nearly every order and family of the mammals have
enlarged relatively five times, ten times even, since the first
appearance of this class in the world.</p>

<p>And it is not only by a mere increase in the size of the brain,
we are reminded, that a great mental enlargement is indicated in
the mammals. The peculiarity of the mammal, which the bird shows to
a certain extent, is its continuing contact and fellowship with its
young. Wisdom no longer perished with the individual. Quite early
in their ascendancy the mammals began to educate. A wolf or a dog
is elaborately educated morally and in the tactics of hunting; a
young monkey has a powerful impulse to imitate and learn. With man
came an ever-swifter process towards a mental continuum. In a few
score thousand years he developed speech, picture-writing, writing,
a distribution of documents, printing. In archives and literature
he began a racial brain.</p>

<p>Each century, each decade in the last few hundred years, has
made enormous additions to the speed and range of interchange
between one man's brain and another's, and to the accumulation of
more and more available stores of knowledge. Telegraphy was still a
wonder in my infancy. Now we can broadcast speech, will presently
radiate drawings, and preserve a record of gesture and movement.
The trace of the increase in man's powers of communication rises
hyperbolically. Our minds are less and less isolated. They mingle
and interact in a new common medium of published and recorded and
universally accepted ideas and interpretations. A new common medium
I write: for imposed upon our minds appears a mind. This is the
mind in which exist science, history, and thought. It has the same
sort of relation to our individual activities that a regiment or
army has to its constituent men. It is a collective human person in
whom we all participate and which invades all our personalities. It
is no longer mortal as we are mortal. It is <i>life</i> awakening,
breaking through the limitations of individuality and growing
conscious of itself. We are all presented as contributory units to
a Titanic being which becomes conscious and takes hold of this
planet.</p>

<p>Is there any reason for supposing that this growing mental being
has any limitations yet imaginable, set to the increase of its
power, to its expansion, or to its invasion of our lives? I do not
find any. It is said that it must be limited in time because it is
limited to this planet, and that this planet is doomed to freeze
and die with the cooling of the sun. But I do not see how anyone
with a knowledge of the implications of modern physics or with any
sense of the unknown knowable can believe that life is necessarily
limited to this planet for ever. The premises are altogether
insufficient. An observer of nature in the Cambrian age might as
readily have declared that life was only possible under water, and
that in a few hundred million years the last fish would gasp its
last gasp as the last puddle on earth dried up. To me it is far
easier to suppose that this present unfolding of consciousness and
will is only a birth and a beginning, and that I am not merely
myself but a participator in a Being that has been born but need
not die.</p>

<p>This is the appearance on the face of things that best survives
the test of my sceptical acids. It i3 how I see life. It holds my
mind when all the older faiths have lost their last vestige of
credibility. It is, I admit, a poetic and not a demonstrable idea.
To accept it is not to return to religion. This Being is not to my
mind a God, unless we are to invert the idea of God altogether. It
is an objective and not a cause, and since it falls within the
frame of time it can only have a proximate and practical reality.
But it is great enough, I feel, to comprehend the utmost scope and
outlook of my life and to rationalise its motives and
relationships.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec13" name="b1-sec13"></a>§ 13. PROMETHEAN</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE put this idea of the common mental being of
our race, t?is Racial Man t? which all our individual lIves
conscIOusly or unconscIOusly are contributory and subordinate, as
if it were an outcome of the new biological outlook upon the
universe. In what I have just written I have told of it objectively
as a history of our world. Seen thus objectively it appears indeed
modern. But the same idea comes into human thought from another
angle. We find it within us.</p>

<p>In the last million years or so our breed has changed from the
most solitary habits to habits more social and cooperative than
those of any other animal. The fierce, lonely, egoistic ape-soul
has been modified and qualified, and had superimposed upon it an
intricate fabric of mitigating and restraining dispositions. The
superstitious fear which may not only overshadow childhood but last
right into adult life, is only one of the earliest and crudest of
these adaptations to social needs. The self-control of the
primitive tabus is also among the merely initial amendments of
human fierceness. There are not only inhibitions but addenda. The
emotions of sexual abandon and maternal and even paternal love as
the ape knew them have also been seized upon by nature and
broadened and utilised for social ends. There is now in man a
desire to serve. There is a pleasure in and a craving for
co-operation and associated action. Curiosity has become
disinterested, and the constructive impulse has been varied and
widened.</p>

<p>The primary form of the human soul is still self-seeking,
self-protecting egoism, as the primary scheme of the human body is
still that of an ape's. But in contemporary man the gratification
of purely egoistic needs is not sufficient for happiness, it does
not satisfy completely. In the case of man as in the case of the
dog and other social animals, the individual soul has been invaded
by the soul of the pack. A man has to be not only gratified but
reassured. There is a conscience, there is a moral struggle, a
conflict of motives. The cat, which is a solitary beast, is
single-minded and goes its way alone, but the dog like his master
is confused in his mind. And in our rationalising human minds it
seems plain to me there is a continuing conflict between the
intense and originally much more intense, crudely and definitely
self-seeking factor, and a vaguer, wider, unselfish factor. The two
are associated but not unified. They jar and the rationalising mind
struggles to account for the disharmony. I think that this less
personal element of the self increases generally as we grow older
and our experiences increase and widen, and that it is becoming
more evident and important in the world's affairs. On the objective
side there appears a race-mind, and this is paralleled on the
subjective side by a great extension of individual interest to
impersonal things. The race-mind, which is as immortal as the race,
continually accumulates interest and attractiveness, and has more
to offer the individual and more power over the individual. A large
part of the waking hours of many people nowadays is occupied by
activities that are of slight or no advantage to them whatever,
although they may be of very great advantage to the race. A man may
live a quarter or a third of his time in a study or a laboratory
keenly engaged upon things that have nothing whatever to do with
his intimate personal drama, activities that add only to the common
inheritance. He may even neglect his personal drama for these
things.</p>

<p>The last time I was in London I met a very stimulating man whom
I had long wished to encounter, Dr. Jung, the psycho-analyst. He
had come from Zurich to London to give some lectures, and after one
of these, the last of them, he had joined a party in a flat looking
out upon the Thames at Westminster. I do not remember who my host
and hostess were&mdash;Dickon had taken me there&mdash;but there
was a pleasant and interested and not too numerous gathering to
meet Jung, and we smoked and drank champagne and whisky and ate
sandwiches and talked late. It was very good talk, no fireworks, no
posturing in it, but close and clear. Jung's English is excellent,
and an hour's lecture at the Queen's Hall had not fatigued him in
the least.</p>

<p>I buttonholed the great man because I wanted to know how he
regarded this conception of a sort of super-mind of the species,
and he said that it was entirely sympathetic with his views. He
made it clear I had not been following up that track alone; I had
been running beside and responding to contemporary thought. One
meets a phrase here and a suggestion there, and subconsciously they
incorporate themselves with one's own ideas. I had thought myself
original.</p>

<p>I quoted Paul that we were all members of one body, and remarked
upon the ease with which one fell into theological phraseology in
this matter. Some one mentioned a distant relative of mine, Wells,
who had employed many religious expressions in a book called
<i>God, the Invisible King</i>; a Manichean book, said somebody,
neither Greek nor Hebrew, but Persian. The writer in question had
gone very far indeed in his resuscitation of theological terms and
in his recommendation of prayer and suchlike exercises. Too far,
said some one. I agreed. I had already talked about that with Wells
himself, and it was plain to me that this God the Invisible King of
his was not so much God, in the sense in which people understand
that word, as Prometheus; it was a titanic and not a divine being.
This unseen monarch was much more akin to Nietzsche's Overman than
to a normal divinity. Frederic Harrison too, some one remarked, had
said that God the Invisible King was merely the Humanity of Com
with a crown on. I had not heard of this before but it struck me as
being a justifiable comment.</p>

<p>Yet I would not be too hard on my cousin for his use of the word
God. For can it have other than a lax use? If you believe in good
as an objective reality, in a sense you believe in God. I doubt if
many Protestants nowadays believe in God in any other sense. The
human mind has been struggling to apprehend this something behind
and above and about individuality for thousands of years and
insisting most pitifully upon exactitudes just where exactitude is
most misleading. Theology has been experimental, and it has been
angry and cruel because it did not realise what an experiment it
was. It was worried by immediate practical needs. It has been
dogmatic because it felt that its flimsiness could not stand the
strains of inquiry. It felt it must take a standpoint if it was not
to wander for ever. It has shown all the nervous irritability,
rising at times to vicious violence, of a weak, well-intentioned
man trying to carry out an important task with a defective
equipment. But in all its aberrations it has clung to its essential
idea the denial of individual isolation. The assertion of complete
individual isolation is, I Suppose, the essential idea of the
dogmatic Atheist.</p>

<p>Jung laid great stress on the readiness of people to misconceive
these ideas about a greater human being. They did not grasp how
that being was supposed to be synthetic and comprehensive. They
thought of it as something outside themselves, an individual of the
same order as themselves, as some one put over them, and not as a
being including and comprehending them as I include and comprehend
my own nerve cells and blood corpuscles. Neither Nietzsche's
Overman nor Shaw's Superman was really to be thought of as an
individual person. Both were plainly the race development, the
whole race in progress. But writers with the journalistic instinct
to caricature got hold of these ideas and cheapened them
irremediably, and the popular interpretation of these phrases, the
Overman and the Superman, had come to be not a communion of saints
but an entirely ridiculous individual figure, a swagger, a
provocative mingling of Napoleon Bonaparte, Antinous, and the
Admirable Crichton.</p>

<p>Jung came back to my quotation from St. Paul about our all being
members of one body. Evidently he attached much importance to that.
He said that not only Christian theology, but nearly all mystical
religion in the world, was saturated with the idea of a merger of
the narrow self in some variously apprehended greater soul. So soon
as religion began to develop theology and pass out of the phase of
abject fear of the mythological Old Man, the tribal God, this
conception appeared. The believer in the mysteries became more or
less the greater being and the greater being became more or less
the believer. In the phase of ecstatic communion the believer was
lifted altogether out of his sinful and finite self and above all
the frustrations of life.</p>

<p>You found this same idea of transcending individuality, in the
Mass, in Mithraism and in many surviving hymns and phrases of
ancient Persian and Egyptian cults. It was expressed almost in
identical terms by Moslem and Jewish mystics. It was not a clear
and cool intellectual realisation with the mystics; it was felt
rather than thought, but clearly it was strictly parallel with the
inclusion of the individual in a racial being that was so congenial
to modern biology. In Christian mysticism it was obscured by the
heavier emotional charge of that cult. In the case of women mystics
particularly the suggestion of the phrase "the divine spouse" had
been excessively powerful, and with such types as St. Hildegarde or
St. Gertrude or the Blessed Angela de Foligno, Christian mysticism
had sunken a long way towards a mere sublimation of sexual abandon.
The Being became very personal and physical and responsive in their
imaginings. The egoism was exalted rather than expanded to
divinity. That, some one suggested, was what happened when women
took to mysticism. A remark which started a detached wrangle in one
corner of the room.</p>

<p>Jung listened for a while to that, and then he remarked that by
his "Superior Person" Confucius must have intended the same
generalised comprehensive man as this we had in mind, the racial
and not the individual man. That again was new to me. "Superior
Person," Jung remarked, could be translated just as well by
Overman; but we Europeans had an unfortunate trick of
misunderstanding and making Chinese thought ridiculous and
unprofitable by using the least dignified words possible in our
literal translations of its phrases. One can do that to European
phrases with an equal destructiveness. Caradoc Evans, I remarked,
degraded Welsh religiosity simply by translating the shining
garments of righteousness as White Shirts. We had still the
cloudiest notions of Chinese thought, said Jung, even of
contemporary Chinese thought; the Chinese might be getting towards
a working philosophy of the modern world, without our aid or
sympathy, along a road of their own.</p>

<p>But so it was, whether one turned to the great teachings of
China or the sacrificial mysteries of Peru, one found in forms that
were sometimes gross and monstrous, and sometimes cold and
enigmatic, intimations of an almost universal idea. Every great
religion and every philosophy of life throughout the world seemed
to have been feeling its way, often in spite of enormous initial
difficulties of creed and training, towards this same process, the
process of subordinating the egoism to a broader generalised being,
the being of communion. Could one doubt that a common psychological
necessity determined these agreements, that like parallel streaks
on the surface of a great river they show the direction of a
current that has been flowing with gathering force for
five-and-twenty centuries?</p>

<p>The realisation of this inner psychological necessity which,
under the suggestions of Jung and Freud and their groups of
associates, we are now beginning to correlate with a new phase in
the circumstances of human life, marks what one may perhaps compare
to a coming-of-age. Just as we are disentangling our minds from the
last lingering fears and submissiveness that marked the childhood
of our race, so also are we growing out of the intense
individualism of its romantic adolescence. As our mental range
increases we realise that in the end frustration and extinction
await everything that is purely individual in us. We are beginning,
some of us, or even most of us, to develop a further, a more fully
adult, mental stage. This adult mentality of the years ahead will
be self-neglectful and scientific and creative in comparison with
anything that has gone before. It will be consciously and
habitually a contributory and co-operating part in the
over-mind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec14" name="b1-sec14"></a>§ 14. THE IMMORTAL
ADVENTURE</h2>

<p class="first">THESE identifications of modern tendencies with
old religious impulses are very curious, and I note them here on
that account. But I do not find any necessity for religious
phraseology to express my own apprehension of the drama of
existence. If it is a matter of interest it is still a matter of
secondary interest to me that anyone should have thought these
thoughts before in other terms or from a different angle. I do not
want, I am under no necessity, to be religious and mystical on this
point. The science of physics has enough paradox in it for me, and
about ordinary life I prefer to be matter-of-fact. I am much more
inclined to use such new and unprecedented expressions as "The
Adventure of Life," or what for all practical purposes is
synonymous, the "Adventure of Mankind," or "of the Greater Man,"
for my general conceptions of everyday reality than any of the
time-worn phrases of the older faiths. Those may be charged with
emotion and reverence, yes, but also they are charged with
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>"Adventure" is more in the quality of my character than any
imperative to live in this or that particular fashion, and it
conveys, what the theological terminology fails to convey, the
suggestion that after all the limitless will of man for knowledge
and power may not prove to be sanctioned by the nature of things.
He may fail and freeze after all. He may smash to nothingness in
some interstellar collision. Even with the admission of that
uncertainty, the adventure is great enough and wonderful enough to
hold my imagination completely.</p>

<p>This way of looking at existence differs from any religious
interpretation in its entire voluntariness. We are not told
dogmatically that we are so-and-so or that we must do so-and-so;
but it is put to us, Let us be and do so-and-so. Let us gather
knowledge and power, let us communicate and learn to co-operate,
let us lay hands on life and fate. Let us at any rate make the
attempt.</p>

<p>To give oneself knowingly to the Adventure of Mankind has this
much to be said for it, that it is in the trend of current things.
Whatever we may think of the universality of progress, there can be
little dispute that the current phase of existence is by human
standards progressive. We shall be in the movement whether we
desire it or not. And since we are thus conscripted in the army of
the Titans against the old Jove of chance and matter, since we are
obliged willy-nilly to participate in the increase and creative
application of knowledge to human ends, we may as well give our
lives cheerfully and take a conscious share in the process. We
shall be happier so. We shall be happier to extend our motives and
desires beyond the tragic uncertainties of the purely egotistic
life. We shall be broadened and steadied by that participation, we
shall be released, we shall be very largely released from the worst
intensities of personal desire and passion and from the bitter fear
and still bitterer realisation of futility that haunt self-centred
minds.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec15" name="b1-sec15"></a>§ 15. VIEW FROM A WINDOW
IN PROVENCE</h2>

<p class="first">IT may be the reader thinks that all these
sections so far, were written on one wet day at Dickon's desk in
his rooms at Bordon Street. The way in which I began this book may
have given that impression. What a day's work it would have been!
Indeed, I wrote no further there than the eighth section, and then
I fell into a profound meditation in the armchair before the open
fire about electrons. And things like that. I had stirred up the
long-slumbering curiosities of my adolescence by recalling them. I
had a queer little idea, an imp, a paradox, an atom of explanation;
I made some notes at last, but nothing to interest the present
reader. Those notes will come to nothing; my day for such bright
ideas is past. The rest of these pages I have written in my
"bureau," as Jeanne will call it, at the Villa Jasmin.</p>

<p>I have revised all that I wrote in London, here, and I find
myself more and more interested in this enterprise. It is doing
more for me than I expected. Autobiography, provided that it is not
too severely disciplined, may be, I perceive, an almost
inexhaustible occupation. Nothing is altogether irrelevant.
Whatever interests one, or has ever interested one, is material. In
due course no doubt I shall get to autobiographical
particulars.</p>

<p>I have been back here in Provence now for fifteen days and
everything is as it used to be last year, the same sunlit peace,
the same delicate beauty and kindly freshness in the air, the same
lean red-haired Clem, as absurdly insistent that she idolises me
and will have no other man but me invading me whenever she dares
and protecting me against a score of imaginary onslaughts upon my
peace and comfort: everything is the same indeed, except that my
little kitten has grown into a very pretty grey cat with a quite
extravagant sense of its own importance. It comes and sits in
judgment upon each fresh sheet as I write it so soon as the paper
is sufficiently warmed by the sun. At certain passages, upon no
consistent principle that I can distinguish, it purrs.</p>

<p>This Villa Jasmin is an old Provençal <i>mas</i>, a small
farmer's house set upon a hillside among olive terraces not far
from Grasse. No automobile can come up to it and it is beautifully
difficult to find, but there is a mossy stone track to us beneath
the grey contorted trees by which we can supply our timber and coal
and suchlike heavy needs. Let me describe it with some
particularity. In it I hope to write most of this contemplated
book; it is the foreground to all that follows.</p>

<p>The house is of three stories in front and has a tall bare face;
behind, it nestles its rump, so to speak, into the hill; its sole
decoration is a ripple of plaster beneath its ruddy brown tiles, a
great scarlet geranium that sprawls up half its height, and a
passion-flower; the narrow windows have wooden fastenings, and old
wooden shutters on rusty hinges that a Cornish southwester would
wrench off in a minute and scatter like dead leaves. Before the
house is a broad terrace where I take my morning coffee and my
midday meal. Blueberried ivy climbs over the parapet; there is a
trim close Japanese medlar in one corner, and in the midst,
surrounded by a grass-rimmed oval of little respectful rose-trees,
there is a very fine and flourishing palm. At the corner is a big
olive-tree that now dots the gravel everywhere with its fallen
black fruits. Beyond are other olive-trees and some fig-trees; a
broad gravel path goes to a large oil-jar in which a ceremoniously
genteel, glossy, flowerless plant is growing, and there it comes to
a rounded and dignified conclusion. On the other side of the
terrace there is a clump of thorny-bladed agaves, green-blue or
green with yellow edges, a big stone-rimmed fountain where our
washing is done and where Jeanne, in spite of the most passionate
remonstrances from Clem, is in the habit of leaving her bowls and
brushes and whacking-boards to desecrate our serenity, and there
are two delicate grey mimosas, a great old Judas-tree, two pretty
gracious trees whose names I do not know, and above and behind all
a thick, tall hedge of bamboos.</p>

<p>There is always a sound of running water about this house. A
stream comes down a little channel from above; close by the wall a
mouth of stone, with lips like an angry ape's, spouts water into
the big washing fountain; below the terrace a dispersed trickle of
water falls from a domed niche adorned with an abundance of
dripping hart's-tongue and maidenhair fern, into yet another basin
of stone. There is a third fountain in a corner where irises grow,
a little terra-cotta affair put there by my predecessor. It has an
inscription in Greek letters, a phrase that Heraclitus made:
<i>Panta rhei</i>, all things flow. There is no enduring thing.</p>

<p>The hill descends steeply in front of the house, and paths sweep
round from the front door on either side of the terrace and are
hidden and unite before the fountain of the ferns below, and run
straight down the hill in a broad stony incline beneath now golden
chestnut-trees and grey olives, to ruinous yet stately entrance
pillars upon the rustic highway.</p>

<p>My study is on the top story and it is as far as possible from
the kitchen, for Provençl servants prefer to converse when they are
at some distance from each other, and always rattle plates and beat
upon pots and pans for a time before they make use of them. It is a
calm austere room. Its walls are painted grey and have nothing on
them but six engravings, four by Mantegna and two by Durer; there
is a tall fine bureau, a large cupboard in which books are
hidden&mdash;for the backs of modern books if they are displayed
talk overmuch&mdash;a table on which papers are scattered, a table
at which I write, and some rush-bottomed chairs. The floor is
tiled, all the rooms in this house are tiled with time-darkened red
tiles; the carpet is discreetly gay, and in one or two shapely old
pots of white earthenware, very delicately crackled and
discoloured, Clem puts bright flowers.</p>

<p>And there is a stove, a good little hungry warming stove which
burns wood and pine-cones.</p>

<p>My window looks almost due south over my palm and Japanese
medlar and olives, and my view is wide and gently various upon
hills and crests and further hills, a remote ridge from the Esterel
and a sharp-edged inlet, a dagger-blade, of water. Beyond the last
reluctant distances of the land appears the sea gravely blue and
the horizon like the top edge of a blue silk barrier.</p>

<p>The hills are all terraced and planted; mistily grey olives
prevail, but there are many sorts of trees and there are a few
vineyards, rusty and yellow now, and other cultivations. The houses
are solitary and plain, white or pink or pale yellow with little
vertical windows like the toy houses of my childhood. There are
many cypresses like black candles, like warning fingers, singly or
in groups; I do not believe the land would be half as beautiful
without its accentuation by these cypresses; and when the day is
clear but overcast the trees upon the contours of the hills pattern
against the soft grey-blue distances like a border of minute dark
lace. Close to me on my extreme right is a single cypress against
the butt-end of a lean high grey house; it is tall and like a
plume, and for some reason it pleases me very greatly. A steep edge
of precipitous walls above ravines and blank white factory-palaces
clustering upon the hillside and partly veiled in haze, is Grasse;
it just comes into my view beyond the nearer olive slopes. A
slender chimney minaret sticks up here and there, a steadying
vertical white line; its rare, occasional smoke has, I know, the
smell of incense. The cathedral tower is single and tall and square
and outstanding. Right in the middle of my view behind a ridge and
ten miles distant one feels rather than sees Cannes.</p>

<p>The whole of this land is a pleasant and prosperous region very
indulgent to mankind. Its agriculture, like its scenery, has a
delicate, fastidious quality. I never see a pig here nor any
cattle; there are occasional sheep, genteel-looking sheep, there
are disciplined grey geese and immaculate white poultry. Once or
twice, in the more open and rocky spaces among the hills, I have
met small companies of goats with goatherds. They had a quality so
harmonious with the scenery that they seemed rather like elegant
quotations from Theocritus than economic facts. The farmer below me
is employed in growing jasmin and violets, and a little way along
the road there are fields of carefully tended rosebushes.</p>

<p>In the early morning the stream-beds and valleys between the
crests and ridges are filled with very sharp restricted banks of
white mist, and then a conical hill some five or six miles away
from here becomes an island of romance. All day long there is a
quiet soft change in the features of this scene, hillsides hold the
sunlight for a time and then fade away, spurs and summits grow from
insignificance to prominence as the sun searches them out on its
daily round. Towards sundown Mougins upon its ridge six miles away
will at times shine out with such a brightness that I think of
Bunyan's Celestial City. Everywhere at this time of year there are
rubbish fires burning, and their bright down-feathers of white
smoke expand and unroll and dissolve away continually and are
continually renewed. Ever and again an absurd little single-track
railway asserts itself by an acute long nose of white steam that
burrows hurriedly across the bluish greens and greys and hangs for
a time and fades like an unimportant memory.</p>

<p>Almost always the sky above this land is a pure clear blue or
delicately streaked with filmy cloud, and the sunlight is a
benediction. Sundown brings a glow of warm contentment. Then
presently the nearer houses lose strength, and faint and die and
become white ghosts in the twilight. Amidst the darkling scattered
lights appear.</p>

<p>I have never known a more intimate sky than this of Provence, by
night as well as by day. Even the rain, the infrequent rain, is
confidential, with something apologetic and reassuring in its
whisper. Last night I saw the morning-star and the old moon close
together above the crest of Peyloubet. My bedroom window looks out
eastward, and there, in the deep blue of morning, framed in my
window-frame like a luminous picture on my wall, was the old moon
on her back with the young moon faint but visible in her arms.
There is, I suppose, a slight astigmatism in my eyes, for I saw
Venus not as the minute disc she is, but as an animated splash of
laughing white light that made exhilarating gestures over this
grouping. I understood suddenly why Czechs and Danes and Poles and
Swedes and Englishmen and suchlike boreal and Baltic men were
needed to realise the inhuman remoteness of interplanetary space.
The stars and planets of the Mediterranean have no aloofness at
all; Diana can still descend upon the hills of Provence, and for
all our modern science the heavenly bodies move here as they did in
pagan times, harmoniously in crystal spheres.</p>

<p>Possibly I dozed, for when I looked again moon and morning-star
were gone altogether and the sky was flushed with the excitement of
corning sunrise. I lay for a time and then got up and went to my
window to see whether that little hill of mine towards Cannes had
got its mists about it yet, and was sitting up and minded to play
at islands of enchantment with me.</p>

<p>This is the present foreground of my world. Men have lived among
these hills for scores of thousands of years, and one could think
that here if anywhere in the world was peace and permanent
adaptation. A short automobile journey to the east would take us to
the caves of Grimaldi, where some of the earliest of human skulls
were found, and Moustiers, which has traces of men even more
ancient, is as close to the west. Cro-Magnon, in Dordogne, is five
or six hours of motoring beyond. The soil everywhere is rich with
human traces, from chipped flint fragments to Phoenician beads,
Roman brickwork, and mediaeval crockery. The newest villas of
Grasse stand on old foundations. This, one might say, is man's
enduring home. The soil is generous; there is no persecution in the
weather, no implacable animal enemy, and little disease. Here, it
would seem, a man can still be born and live a life of immemorial
usage, can believe and worship after the fashion of his ancestors,
and die under the blessings of his church as a child falls asleep
in the arms of a nurse.</p>

<p>But, indeed, this fair and spacious scene is a mere mask of calm
beauty upon the face of change. As I sit writing I hear the sounds
of chopping and sawing and ever and again a shout and a crash.
Under the aged, wrinkled boughs a fire is crackling briskly. A
farmer just beyond my cypress plume is busily destroying his olive
orchard, and he is doing so in order to plant the ground with
jasmine He will have to stub those tough gnarled roots; it will be
a heavy toil for him. All these peasants seem to be giving up their
olives for jasmin, and they are growing that for the perfume
factories in Grasse which serve the transitory, unstable world of
luxury in Paris and London and New York. A change of fashion in
scent, or some ingenuity of the chemist, may abolish the profits of
this flower-growing, and then these hillsides will know trouble;
for olive-trees that are gone are gone for ever. No one can wait
nowadays for planted olive-trees to reach fruition.</p>

<p>The fate of this countryside, which looks so self-subsisting, is
I perceive dependent upon the great consuming centres; those little
hidden railways are like suckers from the urban fungi that have
drained away all local autonomy. The rural life here has been
insidiously and secretly and completely subjugated by Paris.
Ostensibly this land is very like the countryside of a hundred
years ago, when its peasants could have gone on living if all the
rest of the world had died, but in truth their lives now are hardly
more secure upon these hills than they would be if they were
dodging the traffic in the midst of the Champs Elysées. They are
educated, they are tempted away, they are taken for the army and
demoralised, they are pushed out of their homes to make way for
artists and winter visitors like myself, they are pushed off their
land to make way for villas and gardens and strange new
cultivations.</p>

<p>Just out of hearing up the hill behind me is the main road
through Grasse from Paris to Nice, along which drives the restless
fever of a new breed of rich people, people cut off from the
tradition of the past and incapable it would seem of any interest
in the future. They have incalculable powers of manipulating the
franc on which these peasants rely. Their great fat-tyred cars go
throbbing and hooting past, the chauffeur is glassily intent upon
the road, the passengers&mdash;are passengers. Never were there
people so entirely passengers. They are carried along like sacks.
The clothes they wear, the very complexions of the women, seem to
have been put upon their passive persons by the tradesmen of Paris
and London before they were packed off in their cars. One cannot
believe that their financial reactions are other than automatic.
And yet they control. Or at least they are the instruments of a
blind control. It is they who are sweeping away the olive orchards
and turning the peasants into gardeners, speculative flower-growers
for their perfumeries, and servants for their multiplying villas.
Without premeditation, with no definite object, they change the
face of the earth. Not merely here.</p>

<p>This window looks south and modern manufactures and mines and
forges, the slums and the dismal industrial defacement of the
world, are far away behind me and out of the compass of this
picture. The plants I have helped to plan and reconstruct, the
factories and sidings and warehouses of my group of companies and
all our offices are forgotten here. There are hills and mountains
gashed and tormented by us for minerals, far away to the right in
Spain; and for all I know, though I should doubt it, there may be
labour trouble and bad conditions in the scent factories of Grasse
just round the corner of the hill. But such things are the mere
fringes of the world of massed toil; there is no glare of foundry
or furnace in this scene; between here and the equator there are no
many-windowed factories lit up to break the visible night. The
great masses of industrialism are at the back of this outlook, and
as it were below my comfort, away deeply down through my sheltering
hills and mountains, through the bulge of the world northward that
robs them of our sun. They would be out of mind here altogether
were it not that these people, hurrying in their automobiles along
the road from Paris and Lyons and Grasse to Nice and Monte Carlo
and Italy, and the still greater multitude in the
<i>lits-salons</i> and <i>trains-de-luxe</i> that follow each other
along the coastal railway, do in some subtle way recall that
distant teeming darkness of toil. They come with a haste, with a
headlong effect, crowding upon each other, as if they were in
flight from things and suggestions and, it may be, apprehensions
that they desire to forget.</p>

<p>Well, I at least do not want to forget. But I want for a while
to be away from these things to think.</p>

<p>I sit now at my window after the sunset, and my cat is purring
before the purring stove, within which the pine-cones have just
begun to flame. My little study is bright and clear and secure in
the light of my freshly lit lamp, but outside, behind a veil of
blue silence that is deepening into darkness, is an incessant
hurrying world. The rivulet that prattles beneath my window does
not hurry half so fast.</p>

<p>If I could put out an arm of ten miles I could flatten down a
little undulation of the land and see the lights of Cannes and
Antibes and their hotels and villas-de-luxe, and if I could push
away a few unimportant hills with my left elbow I could unmask the
lights of Cagnes and Nice and, beyond those, Villefranche and
Beaulieu and Monte Carlo and Mentone. From here they would look
like patches of burning sand-grains along the dark littoral. In
those places the evening is only a beginning. Through the nearer
shadows among the hills the peasants are going home from their
work, invisible in the twilight; they will eat and sit and talk for
a while and presently blowout their lamps of American paraffin and
go to bed. But all along the Riviera the immense ritual of dinner
is in preparation, myriads of cooks and waiters are busy upon the
endless repetitions of the standard meal, thousands of baths are in
progress, hundreds of men are struggling at this moment with their
heads in their dress-shirts, and women of every age are enhancing
or creating their beauty for the illuminated and significant half
of the day. They will eat rather too much of their magnificently
commonplace food, they will drink rather too much, most of them,
they will dance like automata to imitation negro music, they will
flirt without discrimination, they will set out upon timid,
dishonest, nocturnal adventures and arrange their poor little
adulteries and fornications, they will gamble according to solemnly
conceived systems against the facetiousness and disrespect of
chance, and so come at last belatedly to inartistic lasciviousness
or speechless grossness and sleep.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these people, individually and in masses, seem to
make decisions, seem to have the direction of economic change. They
have an air of being less mutely the creatures of fate than the
peasants. It is hard to believe that it is so.</p>

<p>My mind takes a wider range beyond these Riviera resorts, these
patches of luminous eczema upon the broad face of the earth. Out
beyond is the Mediterranean, and across it, could my eye see
through the smooth curve of the waters to them, go the lit ships
from Genoa to the east of me and Marseilles to the west, and
trailing my imagination with them go the slender threads of their
wakes further and further round the globe, through the straits and
through the narrow seas and into the tropics to the harbours and
warehouses of India and the far East, and out by Gibraltar to South
Africa and to South and North America into distant ports and up
great estuaries. My mind hovers for a while over these ships, mere
particles upon the homeless wilderness of the waters, and I think
of grave engineers watching oiling and pressure, of officers in the
chart-room, of stokers, excessively minute because they are so
remote, sweating before their furnaces, and passengers&mdash;again
those passengers!&mdash;congratulating themselves upon the calmness
of the night and anticipating dinner. What a complex of habits and
motives it is that drives those ships, with their ill-assorted
cargoes, their vaguely directed passengers and their uncertain
profits, about the world!</p>

<p>On my other table lie the English newspapers of three days ago,
and the <i>Quotidien</i> of yesterday and to-day's <i>Éclaireur</i>
and <i>Petit Niçois</i>. And there are various London weeklies and
the weekly <i>Times</i> and <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. As I recall
what I have read in them to-day the view from my window seems to
extend further and further, my boundaries sweep forward across the
Mediterranean eastward and westward to Oran and Morocco, to the
Atlas, to Egypt and the Soudan, to Arabia Petraea and the Yemen,
and the Hadramaut, to Basra and Ormuz and India and China, and
northward across the Pamir uplands, and on and on until at last
they enclose the globe and meet themselves again in a shrinking
coil and vanish. Over there in Africa, out beyond the hump of the
Esterel and across the waters just over the roundness of the world,
the Spanish are retreating before the recalcitrant tribesmen of the
Riff under Abd-el-Krim. It is a hustled retreat, and the Spaniards
are losing heavily and are likely to lose more. They can be having
no rest to-night. Even now as I write some poor peasant lad from
Andalusia or Castile may be writhing in agony with a sniper's
bullet flattened among his freshly shattered vertebrae. Down he
goes, and if there is no ambulance at hand they may have to leave
him to the mercy of the pursuers. Or they may not trust that mercy.
I can almost see those scattered figures of distress straggling
across vast and lonely and rocky places and the crumpled bodies
lying still, until the prowling beasts discover them. That, too, is
in my present world as surely as these tranquil hills.</p>

<p>The Spanish retreat is leaving the French garrisons in Morocco
very uncomfortably in the air, and all North Africa, I gather, is
uneasy and dangerous&mdash;more uneasy and dangerous than the
papers will admit. This afternoon there has been a great rattling
of machine-guns from amidst the hills beyond Grasse. There is a
garrison here of neat yellowish men, Malagasy I am told, and they
are polishing up their tactics, for who knows what may happen? The
other day as I came here from London I lifted the blind of my
sleeping-compartment in the early morning and looked out on that
queer contorted country about Toulon, which is so much more Spanish
and African than French, and there in the crystalline light of dawn
I saw companies of khaki-clad, brown-skinned men with mules and
mountain guns engaged among the brown rocks in some manoeuvres.</p>

<p>A little further to the east in my outlook to-night there are
British warships steaming through the darkness to Alexandria. Egypt
also is astir. The Sirdar of the Soudan has been very deliberately
murdered in Cairo by a band of students, and the new Tory
Government in London is showing the strong hand. Beyond the Red
Sea, Mecca is in the hands of the Moslem puritans and the king the
British set up has failed to recover the city. All along the
festering lines of contact between Islam and the Western world
there is crisis now. Out of hearing of me, out of sight of me, and
yet wonderfully close to my imagination, there must be scores of
thousands of human beings at an extremity of stress and excitement
to-night because of reasonless conflicts, disorders of
relationship, which are still almost as destructive and fruitless
in human affairs as earthquakes and cyclones.</p>

<p>These newspapers just faintly visible in the shadow contain, I
reflect, much other disturbing matter. There are particulars of
religious riots in India, of the struggles of military leaders for
pow«r in China; considerable armies are in conflict there; the
British Government has refused to ratify its predecessor's treaty
with Soviet Russia, and there also trouble gathers. From America
there was little to hand to-day except a tale of rising prices and
a paragraph about a fight and bloodshed between the Ku-Klux-Klan
and a State militia. But all these newspaper headings and items are
merely the sudden swirls, the frothings&mdash;red frothings they
are at times&mdash;and rapids upon the surface of the broad
incessant rush of human affairs. The rest I apprehend but do not
see. Between these various scattered and more or less significant
items there are enormous intervals, great distances filled with
unrecorded crises and unnoticed change. Everywhere older people
have been dying and younger people have been asserting themselves
for the first time; new practices and new ideas have gained a
little ground and old ones lost it. The common mind of the world is
not what it was last night nor what it will be to-morrow. It might
seem that there was no permanent thing whatever in all this onward
flow.</p>

<p>The more widely I extend my view from this window the more
transitory the spectacle appears. Yet the books and criticisms of
life that come to me do still, to a large extent, question change
and repudiate progress. Men can still be found to write of the
"enduring elements" in human nature and the "undying factors" of
human life. Always by life they seem to mean the peasant's life,
seedtime and harvest, desire and children, toil and rest. They see
it associated with the soil, renewed by the soil, as necessary and
inevitable as the succession of day and night. A denial of
essential change is, I suppose, almost fundamental to the Catholic
faith. And by denying essential change men solace themselves for
the shortness of their self-concentrated careers. To those whose
brief historical perspectives have been brought to a focus at the
building of Rome and the Greece of Homer and Hesiod, this peasant
life may well seem immemorial. But in truth there is no underlying
permanent stratum to the changes of our world. It all changes, root
as well as flower. Less rapidly, indeed, but as surely, the peasant
changes with the rest of mankind. These terraces, these olives
which now seem part of the scheme of Nature, have not been here for
more than five-and-twenty centuries. And they go.</p>

<p>Before that time this land behind the coast was held by
cattle-tending, barbaric tribes. And earlier they were more
barbaric. Only a few thousand years ago this land was an untamed
wilderness and its people savages. The man of the Grimaldi caves
was of no European kin, and in his day it seems there was no sea
out there beyond the hills, but a great valley in which men lived
precariously and across which one might walk on foot to what were
then the dense jungles of North Africa. And when one goes back a
few score further centuries, back to the age of the relics that
were found in the caves of Moustiers, then all about here there
were bleak and desolate uplands where the cave-bear prowled, where
the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros crashed through the frosty
thickets, and the only thing to represent a man was a grisly
heavy-browed brute beyond our understanding.</p>

<p><i>Panta rhei</i>, flux universal. It is only because I may sit
at this window for so brief a time that I do not see this scene
dissolve visibly and pass and give place to other unprecedented and
equally transitory appearances. Of one thing only can I be sure,
that all this goes, peasants and pleasure cities, ships and
empires, weapons, armies, races, religions, and all the present
fashions of man's life. Could my moment be enlarged to the scale of
a thousand years, my world would seem less lasting than a sunset
and the entire tragedy of this age the unimportant incident of an
afternoon. I can discover in all <i>my</i> world nothing enduring,
neither in the hills nor in the sea, nor in laws and customs nor in
the nature of man, nothing steadfast except for this&mdash;a
certain growth of science, a certain increase of understanding, a
certain accumulation of power.</p>

<p>But there is that growth of science, there is that increase of
understanding, there is that accumulation of power. I do not know
why it should be so, but so it is. It gathered <i>its</i> force
slowly before man was. It goes on now with accumulating speed and
widening scope, and on it I build my working conception of the
course of life. Man, unconscious at first, begins now, in an
individual here and an individual there, to realise his
possibilities and dream of the greatness of his destiny. A new
phase of history is near its beginning.</p>

<p>But it has not begun. The world I have surveyed this evening is
a world still unawakened. It flows towards its fate down the chance
slopes and natural gullies of a will-less destiny. It obeys not a
purpose but a gravitation. Its wilful contribution is relatively
ineffective. Such science as we have brings us suggestions rather
than direction. It is not a dawn of power. But it is a small,
clear, certain light, a morning star, tacitly hopeful, which it
seems to me must surely and certainly prelude such a dawn. Implicit
in the knowledge we now possess appears the promise of that
comprehensive Greater Being, towards which thinking minds have been
reaching for many generations.</p>

<p>I do not so much accept this conception of the coming of a
general mind as find myself possessed by it as a natural outcome of
all my mental growth. With the readiness of one completely
prepared, I fall in with the intimations this new science of
psycho-analysis gives us, that a new sector, a more completely
adult stage, a stage of fuller self-knowledge and self-direction,
is now enlarging the cycle of human life and bringing us into a
comprehensive mental community. We become more impersonal, more
co-operative, and more disinterestedly creative.</p>

<p>For long ages man has been the rebel child of nature; it is no
new thing that he should attempt to anticipate and divert fate.
Already this world is a man-shaped world; the water that runs
beside the stone-flagged paths and the trickle of the soil down
these slopes are guided and controlled by terraces and channels.
Rain-water and earth go here as they are told. Scarcely a tree
about this house but is here because it was planted or tolerated.
Every beast that is too big to lurk or burrow is a subdued beast.
But so far all this human control has been a control in detail;
there has been no comprehensive control because there has been no
comprehensive understanding. Yet can that fail to come?</p>

<p>Since man in a few hundred centuries has travelled from that
lonely savage in the upland caves to the engineer and chemist and
psychologist of to-day, since to-day there is a constantly
increasing stimulation and enlightenment of men's minds, since
there are no real positive obstacles to human progress but only
negative ones&mdash;ignorance, obstinacy, habit, doubt, and
superstitious fear which vanishes before the light&mdash;it is not
difficult for me to believe that in quite a few generations now, in
quite a little time, our race, moving necessarily in the direction
of its innate promptings, will enter upon a life that would be
altogether wonderful to us could we but anticipate it, that will be
broad and gracious and <i>lovely</i> and beautifully eventful
beyond anything we can dream of now or desire. That new way of
living may be much nearer at hand than many of us dare to suppose,
since its coming seems to depend almost entirely upon the conscious
co-operation of men. No one has yet been able to gauge what
increased power of co-operation a freshly conceived education may
yield us. The long centuries that were needed to mould the
life-cycle of the early Palaeolithic brute-man, darkened and
refractory, into our present freedoms, are no measure of the rate
of change that is practicable to conscious effort.</p>

<p>As I look out upon this world, upon these hills so tranquil now
under the glittering stars, I see as plainly as I see that those
stars are rising and setting, our waste and disorder, our petty,
distressful, and dispersed life, so intelligent and eager, so hasty
and undisciplined and tragically silly, giving place to the advent
of a conscious, coherent being of mankind, possessing and ruling
the earth.</p>

<p>In the peace of this starlit hour one can see wide and far. I
can put in their true proportions the fretting events in those
newspapers, invisible now in the shadow beyond the circle of my
lamp. That futile excitement about the gambling-tables beyond there
is altogether swallowed up in the night, and all the gambling and
money manipulation in the world becomes scarcely more significant
in this longer view than the rustling passage of a few autumnal
leaves down the water-channel beside this house. They may choke a
grating for a moment; they may waste a little water.</p>

<p>And the broad vision that I have from here is scarcely more
troubled by those poor bodies in the desert twilight. The crackling
of rifles and revolvers in the streets of Cairo does not reach up
to this serenity. In some manner all men must die, and while their
lives remain poor and little it is a small matter whether they die
in bed or whether they die in battle. The great guns upon those
ships have but a short range in time. That men should finish a
trifle more painfully and a trifle less tediously than usual, by
shot and bayonet, by gas and great explosions, is little worse than
that they should die by fevers and famines and the cruelties of
large beasts. Such things are aspects of our phase, and only in
degree less transitory than the nightmares that may be troubling a
score of pillows among the peasant homes near by.</p>

<p>There is no enduring pain, there is no eternal tragedy. Toil
passes like the straining of a rootlet or the opening of a bud.
Supreme above wars and disasters, surpassing and at last redeeming
all the present torments of man, is the growth of a being of
thought. Such circles of light as this beneath my lampshade are
more formidable than all the armies and navies in the world, and
stronger than the sum of human violence. They have an invincible
tendency to run together like drops of oil. They grow brighter. It
is because our light is growing that at last we apprehend the
shadows. To realise the unacceptable evil in a thing is to begin
its cure. Great as are the evils that we can see in life, the power
of the will in us grows greater. I see the nearness of an order in
the world like the order of a garden, of a workroom, of a
laboratory, a clean life and a direct life and a powerful life for
men; the jungle and all its sufferings gone at last for ever.</p>

<p>Nor will the coming to consciousness of this greater <i>life</i>
of the race diminish or dwarf or fetter individual lives. They will
be different, they will be enlarged. They will be passing
<i>beyond</i> egotistical conflict and out of the age of jealousy,
as we are passing beyond superstition and out of the age of fear.
But they will be just as freely interested. They will be far more
various and individualised. Their form of self-assertion will be
different, it will have the form of distinctive service and
distinctive creation, instead of being a blind insistence upon
formal honour, upon possessions, and upon stereotyped advantages.
To-day already in a thousand aspects of their lives people about us
are anticipating this new phase, this completely adult phase of
human Ii fee</p>

<p>This is no act of faith I am making. I am not thinking against
my own resistance. I am not declaring my passionate belief in
something that the common aspect of things denies. I am writing
down as plainly as I can what I believe to be plain matter-of-fact,
as I see it directly my nose is sufficiently removed from my own
affairs to permit a broad view of my world. This prospect of a
saner, greater humanity controlling the world is as real in my
sight as that faint light that came a moment since, and now I see
has gone again, in a peasant's window there among the hills.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b1-sec16" name="b1-sec16"></a>§ 16. PAUSE</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE made a long account of my framework of
belief, much longer than I had supposed it would need to be when I
began it in Dickon's London room. I turn over the corrected sheets
and I still find matter for correction. I did not realise how much
of the foundations of my life remained unformulated. At last I seem
to have gathered everything together, everything essential, into
the view from this window. Here I have got the present moment, the
long past, the future, and the deeps of space. Here for a moment I
may pause.</p>

<p>It is three o'clock in the morning, starry and immensely still.
The moon is not yet visible; not even the pale stain of its light
upon the edge of the sky. It will rise later, a hunted fugitive
with the devouring dawn upon its heels. There is no sound in all
this dark world but the soliloquy of the water under my open
window. But at last I feel I have made my ground clear and disposed
of my premises, and to-morrow I will go on writing about the more
human things of life, about social organisation and toil and
business and possessions, and about the hopes and desires of men
and women, their loves and their ambitions, their generosities and
disregards, and about the change that is going on in all human
relationships. That change in human relationships is to be my
expanding and increasing interest throughout. That was what I
intended to discuss from the beginning, and it is only as I have
set about my task that I have realised how much preliminary
explanation had to be made&mdash;to myself as well as to the
reader.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec1" name="b2-sec1"></a>§ 1. FEAR COMES TO
MOWBRAY</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN I was twelve and my brother Dickon nearly
fifteen, my father, Richard Clissold, having been found guilty of
falsifying the books of London and Imperial Enterprises and
sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, committed suicide and
died in the passage behind the court just after he had left the
dock. He had swallowed a small capsule containing poison which he
had concealed in the lining of his waistcoat. While there had been
a straw of hope left to him he had fought, but now hope was at an
end. A few minutes later he would have been searched and they would
have taken everything from him, and his way of escape would have
been closed.</p>

<p>Neither Dickon nor I heard of this disaster at the time. Our
mother had taken us abroad at the first intimations of the final
storm. Probably our father told her to do so. We boys thought at
first that we were going for a few days of holiday, but that
holiday stretched out perplexingly from days to weeks and from
weeks to months, and for all that time things were kept from us or
mitigated for us. We went first to Holland and then into Belgium;
we wandered from town to town and from pension to pension. For a
time we were at St. Orner, where there were mysterious comings and
goings of my mother and various friends between France and England.
We settled down at last at Montpellier&mdash;by that time we knew
of our father's death&mdash;and there we began to realise fully
that the spacious days of Mowbray were over and that we had entered
upon a new life under a new name and more restricted
circumstances.</p>

<p>I understood very little about my father's position in the world
before our flight from Mowbray, and I doubt if Dickon knew much
more than I did. I had known however, that he was a very great
business man. One of our many governesses&mdash;I forget her
name&mdash;told me he was "very, very, <i>very</i> rich." Always
with three "verys," and the last one stressed. That young woman, I
realise now, had an admiration for him beyond her station; she
liked to talk about him endlessly, she said he was "wonderful" and
ought to have been knighted long ago, and she left abruptly and in
tears.</p>

<p>I had still but the vaguest ideas of worldly position in those
days. Mowbray effaced Bexhill. There our surroundings had been
brightly and prosperously suburban in character; we had lived in a
square-faced red house called "Sunny Beach" not five minutes from
the sea-front, with a garden at the back where croquet&mdash;tennis
had still to become universal&mdash;struggled against our infantile
occupation of the lawn. There was, I remember, tamarisk about that
lawn, ragged and ill-treated, and there was tidy tamarisk in front
of the house, and everywhere about us there was tamarisk. Life at
Bexhill was being a "kid" in a multitudinous jumble of "kiddies"
amidst perambulators and nurse-maids and pet dogs and iron seats
and sand-heaps and boats and the stray balls of strange children
coming out of nowhere into our play, and the legs of grown-up
people. But Mowbray was a large and dignified frame for our lives.
It conveyed a sense of social perspectives, and there I began to
observe something of the relationships of things. I knew there were
poor people in the world who had to be pitied but not encouraged,
and that there were lower servants who resembled one another
closely and upper servants of greater personal distinction like
Mrs. Praydo and Jenks the butler, and the current governess between
heaven and earth, and Mummy's friends who called in the afternoon
and were shown the gardens, and Daddy's friends, a gay and
glittering train who came for week-ends. Some of these were knights
and baronets and even lords and ladies, and far away and over them
all ruled the old, old Queen, Queen Victoria in Windsor Castle, who
lived for ever and was halfway to God. There were a lot of
foreigners also in existence; some of Daddy's friends were
foreigners, but foreigners did not amount t.o much unless there was
a war. Then the Fleet would protect us.</p>

<p>I had not learnt very much in those days because my education
had been so intermittent, but I was curious and fairly quick and I
read voraciously. My education was intermittent because my father
was imaginative and erratic and my mother fastidious and resistant.
Towards the end of our great days he was talking of a public school
for me, but he did nothing whatever to get me to one. "Which shall
it be, Old Son?" he would ask. "Harrow and a halo or Eton in a
topper and a bum-freezer?" I had a brief spell at a very select
preparatory school near Guildford which I hated, and when I was
eleven I began, by a special concession, to be a weekly boarder at
Cossington's School. There I learnt to draw and the beginnings of
science. I was taken away from that abruptly in mid-term. Dickon
was then in the fifth form at Laxton after a good beginning at a
preparatory school in Bexhill&mdash;his was a much sounder and more
normal education than mine&mdash;and a few days later he too was
jerked home and came back in a state of pleasurable excitement,
with no idea of what impended.</p>

<p>"What's up?" said Dickon. "Is it to be Eton after all?"</p>

<p>I can still recall something of my mood when I learnt on the
Monday morning that I was not to return to school. I went out ?n
the terrace after Jenks had given me my breakfast and contemplated
with infinite satisfaction the vast, empty, wonderful day that
opened out before me, a surprise gift, a golden globe of sunlit
time. It was a bright March day and the clouds were like great
ships crowded with canvas that sailed before a strong yet kindly
south-west wind. Everything was very quiet, there were no week-end
visitors packing off and departing, because my father was away. I
had no suspicion that life at Mowbray had come to its last phase of
all for me. I decided I would begin by going to see if the
primroses had appeared along the bridle-path through the wood.</p>

<p>I must have gone into the park and looked back at the house
somewhen then, because it stands out so plainly in relation to this
moment of my life. I see again the fair pale frontage under its
pseudo-classical pediment, the dignified portico, the dining-room
to the right, and to the left five windows of the long room both
Jenks and my father always spoke of as the "saloon." East and west
were stables and other offices, each with a cupola and a clock. The
house was backed by woods, tall brown beeches, red tipped before
the first sharp jets of green athwart their lower branches. I can
see it now. I can feel the freshness and release of that spring
morning still. After the matter of the primroses had been
investigated I proposed to strike back to the dip in the park and
see whether the bracken had got its croziers above ground yet or
whether I should find them by digging, and what our fallow deer
were doing. Our new fallow deer. Only last autumn my father in his
splendour had turned the cattle off the park and stocked it with
nearly three score fallow deer.</p>

<p>Then probably after that I should cease to be a boy and become a
Red Indian or an African explorer.</p>

<p>But the rest of that day and the two days of solitude that
followed before Dickon's return have left no clear record in my
mind.</p>

<p>Uncontrolled freedom at Mowbray seemed too good to be true to
both of us. It was too good to be true, and we received the news
that we were to go abroad to Holland "to see the lovely bulbs" with
loud protests. "Oh <i>no</i>, Mummy!" We had no desire to see the
lovely bulbs and our mother's manner did not convey to us any great
anticipation of pleasure in the spectacle. We wanted to go on
mucking about at home. There was a dismay in our mother's dark eyes
and a stress in her manner for which our boyish imaginations had no
understanding. We argued that going to Holland was perfectly rotten
and we made a stolid passive resistance to packing. One or two
incidents before our departure struck Dickon as "rummy"; Jenks
vanished suddenly, and a housemaid found in tears on the staircase
said every one was going to be turned off. She apparently, said
Dickon, had been jolly well just turned on. Strange men appeared
and moved the furniture about and treated a small boy accustomed to
be taken notice of as if he was invisible. Mother appeared to be
sniffing furtively that evening. Anyhow, when Dickon asked her if
anything was "up" she turned her face away and dabbed her eyes with
her handkerchief before she answered in a strangled voice,
"<i>Nothing</i>. Nothing, dear. I have a little cold."</p>

<p>That first perception of something wrong in the air, something
that was being kept from us, was greatly intensified by my mother's
behaviour in the brougham on the way to Duxford Station. Dickon
had, of course, collared the seat beside the driver but I was
inside with mother. The excitement of travel was upon both of us
youngsters by that time, we were disposed to forget our recent
recalcitrance, but it was painfully evident she intended to
continue depressing us. Dickon had made a sort of song about our
departure that seemed to me the quintessence of wit, it was so
perfectly innocent and justifiable in reality and yet so close to
indictable offences. He had made it as :we got up and we had been
singing it all the morning.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"We're going to Rotterdam<br>
Rotter Rotter Dam<br>
We've both of us gotter<br>
Go to Rotter<br>
Rotter, Rotter&mdash;(open out and let yourself go)<br>
Dam!"</p>
<br>

<p>When I tried to cheer things up inside the brougham with this
agreeable refrain my mother quenched me with, "Don't, Billykins,
I've got a headache."</p>

<p>We drove down the park road to the town lodge. I sat back
subdued but resentful. At the curve where the woods sweep round my
mother leant forward and became very still, looking back at the
great house she was leaving for ever. It seemed to be smiling in
the sunshine with the blandest indifference to her departure. I
gave it one glance over her back, noted that her shoulders heaved
and stared disgusted out of the other window. What was the
<i>good</i> of all this depression? What was the <i>sense</i> of
it? It was <i>my</i> holiday that was being spoilt by her
obstinacy, not hers. I remained stonily averted until we were close
to the station.</p>

<p>Then she spoke to me and her voice showed that she had recovered
herself. "Come, Billykins," she said. "Take your little bag."</p>

<p>I took my little bag.</p>

<p>Queer how just these scenes of five or ten minutes' duration
stand out in one's memory. Queer, too, how broken and intermittent
are all my memories of my mother, without prelude and without
immediate sequel. It is as if that part of my mental record had
been edited by some unknown power with a disposition to suppress
her. I suspect a sustained inattention. It is only by an effort
even now that I can restore her sufficiently to describe her. She
was dark and slender, she was weak and gentle and ineffective; fear
was in her nature and she would not, she could not, stand up to
events. I think that both Dickon and I felt that fear in her as a
thing excessive, and that it robbed us of much of the natural
confidence and love that sons should have for their mother.</p>

<p>Her promotion to Mowbray must have frightened her very much. At
Bexhill she had been able to manage fairly well, but Mowbray after
Sunny Beach must have seemed like a white elephant after a
governess cart. In the course of time she had come to like the
place after her fashion and at the end she had become proud of it.
Jenks and Mrs. Praydo had made things difficult but not impossible
for her during her period of responsibility; they had never failed
to come to her to tell her what orders to give them unless they
were very hard pressed. Some of the weekends must have been
terrible&mdash;such a crowd of large, bright, brilliant, and
various people, yet after all my father was there to manage them
and she could wear her dresses very successfully&mdash;she had a
lovely neck and shoulders&mdash;and even get into little
sympathetic conversations with anyone who, like herself, seemed to
be detached and shy. And in the quiet in between she could almost
expand into a great lady and have local callers and see her own
friends and take them to see the roses or the orchids or even, if
they had suitable dispositions, completely "over the house."</p>

<p>I know very little of my mother's history. My father must have
married her when she was very young; she could have been hardly
three-and-thirty at the time of his death. I do not know where he
met her nor what her people were; I may have first cousins quite
unknown to me. I have no doubt he came into her world suddenly and
splendidly and discovered her quiet, dark loveliness and decided to
make her his with the same effective decision with which later he
made Mowbray his. And to begin with for a brief year or so I am
convinced she must have been a quite happy young woman. He was good
looking and charming and confident and kind. I imagine she began by
believing him to be just exactly the nice and gallant,
high-principled and capable husband that every Victorian young lady
expected as her portion in life. Presently she must have come to
realise that instead he was a strange and unaccountable animal,
that a thousand things in the world could attract and excite him
more than she could, that he could be unfaithful to her without a
qualm, that without an antagonistic thought for her his proceedings
could be utterly regardless of her security and of her standards of
right and wrong and of everything she valued in life. I am sure he
loved her ardently at first and then began to go away for a little
while and then come back more ardent than ever, and so on for
longer and longer absences and briefer and briefer spells of
compensatory ardour, until it must have become apparent to her that
he was developing the habit of forgetting her to very serious
proportions. He was never, I am sure, positively unkind to her, he
never in any material way neglected her, he showed her the greatest
respect, but he forgot her more and more. It was his way to forget
things. Negligence was the fault that finally destroyed him. At
last it was all forgetfulness and there was no more ardour at all.
In his forgetfulness of her he may have inflicted some terrible
humiliations. He was a man of manifold activities. He went on with
his career as he had been going on with it before he met her, his
expansive, enterprising, erratic, dangerous, and occasionally
forgotten career.</p>

<p>I think she must have known how dangerous it was, by instinct,
by watching his moods, quite early in their life together. I
believe she felt the quiver of the coming earthquake through all
our comforts and splendours long before it came. In her heart she
may have been praying desperately against an inevitable
catastrophe.</p>

<p>I wonder how lonely that poor fear-oppressed lady was at
Mowbray. She was a helpless nonentity on a ship that she felt might
founder. She had no consolation that I can perceive unless it was
the sense of temporary possession when my father was away. She did
not resort to religion, at least perceptibly; I think she was too
shy to take her troubles there. And we two boys must have been very
uncongenial offspring indeed, intractable, difficult to pet and in
voice and appearance very like our father, Dickon even more than
I.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec2" name="b2-sec2"></a>§ 2. CARILLON AND
TRAGEDY</h2>

<p class="first">IT was at Bruges that Dickon and I were told that
there was to be no more daddy and no more Mowbray in our lives.</p>

<p>I have never been to Bruges since those days and I do not know
how much that little old city has changed. I remember it as
cobbled, with grass and moss between the cobbles, as built of very
worn red brick and having a great number of courts in which big
trees grew and into which one went through great archways. These I
think were called Beguinages and I remember worrying my mother to
show me a Beguin. "Mummy, is <i>that</i> a Beguin?" One might lark
about among these places&mdash;discreetly. There were also numerous
green-scummed decaying canals with grassy banks, sustaining a
multitude of brightly painted and interesting barges. Also there
was a very entertaining Grand' Place, above which rose a tall
belfry that continually disseminated tunes like the tunes of a
musical-box. It showered chimes and airs at the hours and the
half-hours and quarter-hours. All Bruges lived as a vocal exercise
to the accompaniment of this almost incessant carillon. One could
ascend that belfry, but our mother would not let us do that. High
places made her giddy and so they were forbidden us. Always there
was a creaking and clatter in the cobbled square below, a coming
and going of big two-wheeled wagons with the most interesting
loads, a selling of things from booths, a shouting of hawkers and
so forth. There was a great traffic of small carts and trucks drawn
by dogs; we had never seen the like before. The dogs would bark at
you but they would not go for you because they were fastened to the
carts. They were always barking. We lodged in an inn upon the
Grand' Place, an inn with some old Flemish name that I have
forgotten, and it was in a little bedroom upstairs with an open
window giving on the noise, on shouting, barking, chimes and
clatter, that our mother told us that our father was dead.</p>

<p>We had known for two days that things were getting worse with
mother, but we had said nothing to each other about it. She had
kept us away from her as much as possible, sent us out to play,
even given us francs to buy anything we wanted in the shops. When
we drifted back to the square and the inn she had gone off for a
long walk by herself&mdash;a strange thing for her to do. At
bedtime there had been a storm of affection, more especially for me
because I stood it better. "My poor, poor darling little Billykins!
My little Billy!"</p>

<p>Then she began to talk to herself, a thing she had never done
before. "How can I tell them?" I heard her say as we sat at our
lunch.</p>

<p>And also I remember, "I can't even wear black. I can't even do
that."</p>

<p>She made us come up to her room after our lunch. We came the
more reluctantly because she said she had something to tell us,
something very important. We were both now in a state of extreme
resentment at her odd and unaccountable behaviour. We knew nothing
of her distresses and to her, poor woman, our minds were
inaccessible. She had never known how to reach them, how to make
herself in any way understood. From our earliest childhood she had
never been able to imagine, much less to direct, what went on
inside our little skulls.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said. "No, don't look out of the window, please,
<i>please</i>, don't. Sit down." Dickon she made take the only
chair, and I was perched upon the bed. The room, I remember, struck
me as untidy. The poor lady looked at her two difficult, obdurate
offspring and stood clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"You poor dear children! Oh! dreadful things have happened.
Dreadful things. How can I tell you?"</p>

<p>"You haven't had bad news, mother?" Dickon hazarded.</p>

<p>"Oom," said my mother, full charged with emotion.</p>

<p>"Boys!" she recommenced&mdash;she had never called us that
before. "Boys, you are never to <i>speak</i> of your father again.
Never. You are never to <i>think</i> of your father again. You will
never see him any more&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>Neither of us, I remember, said a word. I glanced at Dickon for
a cue and he was sitting stock still, not looking at her but, still
hostile, taking in what she had said.</p>

<p>Her lips were compressed. She clenched her handkerchief into a
ball and pressed it against her cheek and sat down abruptly upon
her big travelling trunk. "Never see him again," she said. "Never
go back to Mowbray. Never go back to England not for many years.
Live abroad here. And your name isn't to be Clissold any more. None
of us are to be Clissold any more. You will be called
Walters&mdash;Willy Walters. Dickon Walters. Mrs. Walters."</p>

<p>She paused. Then added an injunction: "Whatever questions they
ask you, you are not to answer. Not to answer and not to listen.
Whatever they ask or whatever they say."</p>

<p>Dickon, it was evident, intended to speak. She stared at him
with dark apprehensive tear-stained eyes. Already he was so far his
father's heir that she was afraid of him.</p>

<p>"But what's become of daddy?" he asked. "Why should we be called
Walters? I think it's a <i>rotten</i> name."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it was my name&mdash;before I married," sobbed my
mother.</p>

<p>"All the same," said Dickon. "And besides&mdash;where's he gone?
I don't see it."</p>

<p>I was younger and blunter. I had had what I felt was a really
bright idea, and I wanted to get it out before Dickon thought of
it. "Is he <i>dead</i>, mummy?"</p>

<p>Dickon glanced at me as though he was minded to strike me. For a
long time, as it seemed, my mother said nothing. Her brows were
knit and her face was red. There was an immense silence in the room
and outside a turmoil, a sudden dog-fight, men shouting, the
clatter of cans overturned and trailed over the stones.</p>

<p>"OO!-oom!" my mother assented at last, nodding her head, her
lips pressed tight. She choked, and then spoke very quickly in a
sharp squeak: <i>"He's dead."</i></p>

<p>And then her face flushed transparent red and broke up like an
infant's when it gives way to uncontrollable grief. She took refuge
from all further inquiries, from all further control of the
situation in a stupefying passion of weeping. I had never seen such
weeping. I was astounded, I was horrified, I was ashamed. It seemed
to me that even the noises in the square outside were stilled in
amazement at her grief. "What <i>shall</i> I do?" she cried. "What
can I <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p>"Leave me," she said at last. "Leave me. Oh! my heart's
breaking."</p>

<p>How vividly those moments come back to me! I can see her still,
see her thin red clutching hands before her face, and her poor
silly little handkerchief so soddened with tears that it oozed and
dripped. I can remember such a detail as that, but my own feelings
I cannot remember at all. I do not think I had any feelings at all.
Was I sorry for her? Was I sorry for my father? Was I even sorry
for myself? I do not recall it. I was simply stunned with
astonishment at the spectacle of a human being "breaking down." In
all my life before I had never seen anyone "break down." And this
was mother!</p>

<p>I do not remember the slightest impulse to console or comfort
her.</p>

<p>I remember, too, almost as vividly how I walked with Dickon by
the side of a canal that afternoon, though how we had got there
from my mother's bedroom has quite faded out of my memory. I see
Dickon with a white face staring blankly ahead of him, his eyes
glassy with unshed tears, and I beside him waiting until it should
please him to speak.</p>

<p>He spoke at last in tones of intense bitterness.</p>

<p>"Just as if nobody wanted to blub except her," he said, and
wrathfully: "It's <i>our</i> father."</p>

<p>I accepted that and remained silently respectful as became a
younger brother.</p>

<p>At length after a long interval his voice carne again: "What's
the sense of our not being called Clissold? Everybody knows our
name's Clissold. Everybody."</p>

<p>That again called for no comment on my part. He brushed his eyes
lightly.</p>

<p>Presently he thought aloud once more. "Why aren't we going to
his funeral? It's our right to go to his funeral. I am the heir. I
am his nearest. I ought to be there. Both of us ought to be
there."</p>

<p>Again I had nothing to say. We went on silently side by side,
silently comforting one another. We felt a hundred things we could
not say. We both understood quite clearly that all we had been told
was but an intimation of unspeakable things. The whole world had
become dark; sinister abysses yawned beneath the Belgian cobbles;
our feeble speculations and interrogations were as helpless as a
weak wailing in an immensity of night. And we knew that so far as
our mother went we should never be told, never be given any shape
for his disappearance and death and this enigmatical collapse of
our world. Some disaster, some frightful thing? In that our
splendid, meteoric father was lost, dreadfully lost. Our hearts
began to ache for him. His voice, things he had said and done were
coming back to us. He had gone, gone for ever.</p>

<p>Towards our poor, fragile, incapable mother I can remember only
that dreadful hardness of our hearts. It was almost as if we felt
that it was she who had taken us away from him. And Mowbray and all
we held dear.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b2-sec3" name="b2-sec3"></a>§ 3. A STEPFATHER</h2>

<p class="first">FROM that time on Dickon and I became the close
allies we are to this day. Before then we had not seen very much of
each other; we had gone to different schools and lived
dissimilarly, but now we were thrown together in an almost constant
association; we shared our troubles and antagonisms, we were
English brothers in a French school and Clissolds, suppressed but
still obstinate Clissolds, crypto-Clissolds for a time, against the
world.</p>

<p>We were poor in comparison with the Mowbray days, but not
impossibly poor. My mother had property. Years ago my father, in a
phase of clear prevision, had settled money upon her, and in
particular some parcels of shares and some house property in
Belgium and France. She talked freely and frequently during that
phase of wandering, about returning this property to his creditors,
but no creditors were ever about to take advantage of her mood. She
presently adopted widow's mourning and put crape armlets upon us
and established herself definitely in Montpellier as Mrs. Walters,
a young English widow, very inconsolable and quite devoted to her
two sturdy boys. And we had to be the Walters boys thoroughly and
suppress the Clissold in us even in our private thoughts.
Imperceptibly we fell into a grouping in which she alone was the
mourner amongst us, and we shaped our behaviour more and more
easily to her assumption that it behoved us to comfort her and
compensate her for all she had been through.</p>

<p>She made no great confidences to either of us. To me she talked
rather more than to the silent and often preoccupied Dickon. I was
younger and gentler in my manners and more flexible. "Ah,
Billykins," she would say. "You're all I've got to live for now.
You two dear boys."</p>

<p>And she would pat my shoulder and quite obviously let her
thoughts ramble away to other things.</p>

<p>A more capable comforter appeared in the late August or early
September in the person of her cousin, Mr. Walpole Stent, a tall,
shy, thoughtful, knickerbockered man with a very large forehead and
an immense appetite for long, deep, confidential talks with her. He
used to carry field-glasses in a leather case slung by a leather
strap over his shoulders in order to examine distant landscapes
with more particularity. Those field-glasses offended our sense of
<i>comme-il-faut</i>. He put up at a little hotel in the Rue
Boussairelles not far from our house, and he resumed" a severed but
never-forgotten friendship with our mother. With him we all went
presently for a holiday to St. Raphael, which was then a
comparatively unknown resort. He had persuaded her to this, she
explained, and she had yielded because she thought it would do us
good to go to the seaside before we recommenced school.</p>

<p>He was partner by inheritance in a firm of London solicitors,
and I remember that even then I was impressed by the retentive and
preservative quality of his mind. It was my first encounter with a
well-trained legal intelligence. It was like some great furniture
depository, safe from fire, corruption or admixture, nothing seemed
to happen in it and nothing ever got lost in it, and he could, with
every appearance of pleasure, reproduce the most commonplace facts
at any time at the fullest length and in the completest detail. He
did all he could to make friends with us in spite of his
preoccupation with our mother. He liked us with the greatest
determination. He told me a lot of natural history and scientific
wonders that for the most part I knew already, and to Dickon he
professed a sympathetic interest in cricket that his performance on
the beach did not seem to justify. He was, most worthy man, the
completest contrast to our father that one could imagine, and I
perceive that the hostility to his memory that still smoulders in
my heart is a quite instinctive reaction, unrighteous and
unreasonable.</p>

<p>He reappeared at Christmas and found my mother almost out of
mourning altogether, very animated and pretty in a dress of bright
grey trimmed with black velvet. She began to make it after his
departure but she did not wear it until he returned. We noted that,
but said nothing. A paternal solicitude crept into his manner
towards us, and he discussed our future careers with us at length.
We did not, however, discuss them with him; we were already
enormously self-protective towards him. We felt the coming
usurpation. Within a year of my father's death my mother had
married him.</p>

<p>She told us she did it entirely for our sakes. She said that we
two needed the friendship and guidance of a good man. All boys
needed that as they grew up, but we needed it to an exceptional
degree. She was too weak for us and she knew it. For her it was
implicit there could be no surcease from tragic memories.</p>

<p>There was a honeymoon in Switzerland while we two remained at
Montpellier, and then the French phase in our education was broken
off abruptly and we were moved to Chislehurst. At Dulwich College,
which was then a vigorously progressive school just taking up
science teaching, we made up for a great deal of lost ground. We
became boarders and went home only in the vacations. There was
never any active dissension between us and our stepfather, but
there was a sort of mutual estrangement. We differed. Even in our
holidays it is remarkable how little of our waking time we spent at
home. And in the course of the next three years our mother showed
her further devotion to our needs by securing us first the
friendship and guidance of a small but large-headed baby brother
and then of a little sister, and then of a second sister.</p>

<p>Dickon was now nearly nineteen and I was sixteen, and as the
Walpole Stent family fulfilled its destiny in this manner we two
became more and more aware of our superfluousness therein. We
proposed to enter at the Royal College of Science and set up for
ourselves in London lodgings, and after a great deal of needless
discussion, for our departure was manifestly a relief to everyone,
this was conceded. But our stepfather loved weighing pros and cons
fully and deliberately, and saw no reason why a foregone conclusion
should be treated cavalierly. It was not difficult for our mother
to give us an allowance of eighty pounds a year each out of the
property my father had set aside for her; that was a quite possible
allowance in those days, and so we two were able to establish
ourselves in apartments in Brompton and face the world
together.</p>

<p>When everything essential to that removal was settled, Dickon
broached a matter of great concern to both of us.</p>

<p>It was late one evening that he found his opportunity. My mother
and stepfather had been out to dine with a neighbour, and we had
just come in from a music-hall. We found them refreshing themselves
with biscuits and some lemonade. The bedroom candles were on the
table. We exchanged colourless information about our proceedings.
Then our stepfather asked some unnecessary question about the
courses at Kensington I proposed to take.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," said Dickon with a little catch in his voice
and an elaborate casualness in his manner, "now that we are going
away from here&mdash;and things have blown over a bit&mdash;l see
no reason why we should keep up this pretence of being Walters. In
fact&mdash;I'm entering at Kensington for both of us
as&mdash;Clissold."</p>

<p>"But, my dear boy!" said our stepfather. "Do you know&mdash;do
you know anything of the story?"</p>

<p>"Most of it, said Dickson. Billy has looked it up in back
numbers of <i>The Times</i>."</p>

<p>"Well!" said our stepfather.</p>

<p>"We don't like sailing under false colours," said Dickon. "We
think we ought to stand to it."</p>

<p>"But how can we <i>tell</i> people?" cried my mother.</p>

<p>"You needn't. We can be Walters here. Whenever we come along to
see you."</p>

<p>He lit his candle calmly and thoughtfully as though the matter
was concluded. His hand was quite steady, but mine trembled a
little as I followed him. I was sorry for my mother and I avoided
looking in her direction. "There's much to be considered," my
stepfather began.</p>

<p>"We've considered most of it," said Dickon, and took up his
candle. "You coming, Billy?"</p>

<p>My stepfather made no immediate answer.</p>

<p>Dickon went over to mother and kissed her good-night.
"Good-night, father," he said. It was rare he said "father." I,
too, saluted my mother, and just for a moment her hand sought mine
and failed to press it. Her furtiveness made me as shy and
ineffective as herself. We conveyed nothing and perhaps there was
nothing to convey.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;!" said my stepfather as Dickon reached the door.</p>

<p>"If I go out into the world as Clissold," said Dickon, turning
to him, "I begin at the bottom&mdash;yes. But if I go out under a
false name and then they find out I am Richard Clissold
Secundus&mdash;where am I then?"</p>

<p>He did not wait for any further discussion, and my stepfather
had no immediate reply. He had to readjust his point of view. And
that he never did in a hurry.</p>

<p>But presently he began to assemble his considerations. Our
bedroom was directly over that occupied by my mother and my
stepfather, and I could hear his quiet, unhurrying voice unfolding
the situation to himself and to her, amply, thoroughly, and
needlessly, until I fell asleep.</p>

<p>My mother, I know, loved to have things explained to her. She
did not listen, but she loved to have things explained to her. I am
sure that she was in a muddled way distressed at our going, and
that my stepfather's discourse comforted and consoled her. It was
not that it met her fears and objections so much as that it
anointed and soothed her mind. Dickon and I lay awake in our beds
for a long time talking in fragmentary spurts, exchanging ideas
about our own unforgettable father and about the world and about
that battle with the world that lay before us, or following out our
own thoughts to the accompaniment of that submerged, interminable
commentary. I do not remember what we said to each other, but I
have as vividly present in my mind as if I had heard it only a
moment ago the muffled sound of that voice coming up through the
floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b2-sec4" name="b2-sec4"></a>§ 4. THE END OF A
SWINDLER</h2>

<p class="first">I FIND it very difficult to recall what sort of
figure our own father made in our minds at that particular phase of
our lives.</p>

<p>Necessarily his offence, his disaster, his career, and his
punishment completely dominated our early outlook. He bestraddled
our start in life like the Colossus of Rhodes; we sailed out under
his shadow into the world. He overwhelmed us, immense and
indistinct and enigmatical.</p>

<p>I knew he had died in some "dreadful" way after that scene at
Bruges, but it is a curious thing, for which I cannot account, that
I did not make any attempt to find out exactly how he had died for
several years. I suppose when first I was told I was too young to
know how to set about the inquiry, and before I had got the
necessary <i>savoir faire</i> for such an investigation the habit
of not inquiring was established. It was by chance one day at
Chislehurst that I came upon a succinct notice of his tragedy in a
stale Whittaker's Almanac. In those days nothing in print was
unreadable to me. There in the Events of the Year my eye caught the
name of Clissold, and I read, in small print at the bottom of a
column amidst a crowd of other happenings: "Clissold, Promoter of
London and Imperial Enterprises, having been sentenced to seven
years' penal servitude by Mr. Justice Ponters for fraud, committed
suicide with potassium cyanide as he left the dock."</p>

<p>So that was it! That was my mother's great secret.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to go and tell Dickon all about it, my next
to conceal my discovery from him altogether. For either he knew
already and had been keeping this thing from me, or he did not know
and we should have only this bare poisoned needle of statement to
rankle in our minds and inflame us to painful, futile guessing
about the details. Obviously a thing like that, big enough to be an
Event of the Year, would be found in the newspapers of the time,
and so after a day of consideration I asked one of the Dulwich
masters&mdash;Graham Wallas it was, who afterwards became a great
Fabian Society man and a professor of social science&mdash;how one
set about looking up old newspapers. He was one of our keenest
teachers, extraordinarily kind and sympathetic with anything
responsive in his classes, and to him one went as a matter of
course in any such difficulty as mine. I recall his little start at
my request, his judicious self-control&mdash;I suppose he knew who
I was really and guessed what I had in mind&mdash;and how he
hesitated and considered and knitted one brow more than the other,
with his kind brown eyes looking away from me over his glasses at
infinity and his mouth screwed up in a way he had.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the best course," he said.</p>

<p>He could not tell me exactly on the spot how I could consult old
newspaper files&mdash;I was too young for a British Museum
ticket&mdash;but he would inquire and let me know the exact
particulars. He would inquire.</p>

<p>"It's <i>The Times</i> you ought to read&mdash;certainly," he
said. "You'll get the facts there complete and
without&mdash;without sensation. Whatever facts it is you want to
look up."</p>

<p>And at last at a charge, I remember, of sixpence, in a
commodious room at <i>The Times</i> office, where a number of
blighted, anxious-looking people were pulling big volumes about
over the tables, I began to reconstruct item by item my father's
dereliction and death.</p>

<p>As I did so a great cloud of long-neglected memories returned to
me, memories of a big, kind daddy-giant, who came suddenly out of
nowhere into one's childish world with a tremendous "Hello, you
kids!" and banished dullness. He banished boredom; that was his
supreme quality. He is always a large, not very distinctly featured
giant to me; my memory of his face is not clear. Chiefly I remember
his red whiskers. My mother destroyed every photograph there was of
him, and in those days the portraits of prominent people published
in the papers were engravings&mdash;photographic reproduction for
periodicals did not yet exist&mdash;and those I was able to dig up
made a lamentable mess of him.</p>

<p>So he remains incurably atmospheric, red whiskers, a flushed
complexion, a very reassuring smile, quick movements. A wonderful
giver of "pig-a-bags" he had been at Bexhill, and at Mowbray there
had been rare, memorable sprees, a time when a week-end party of
grown-ups played rounders with wild enthusiasm on the great lawn,
and Dickon, who was only fourteen, ran faster even than men of
fifty and got rounder after rounder for his side, and several games
of spoof cricket with the end pillars of the terrace balustrading
as a wicket and a walking-stick for a bat and a rubber ball. He
dressed up once as Father Christmas for us. He sang the "Two
Obadiahs" and "Tommy, Make Room for your Uncle" to us&mdash;until
my mother implored him not to make us vulgar. He would think of us
when he was abroad and in all sorts of places where a daddy might
reasonably forget his little boys; he brought us back delightful
flat tin soldiers marching, cooking, camping, in oval wood boxes
from Paris, and entertaining earthenware Nativities with kings,
shepherds, and irrelevant crowds complete, from Italy. And he sent
us coloured picture postcards from the end of Europe, costumes or
animals or railways or ships. He saw to it that we had toy railway
trains on rails that really worked, from some special shop he knew
of in Holborn. Such deeds fought for him eloquently. It was
absolutely impossible for me to think of him as a villain.</p>

<p>I sat in <i>The Times</i> search-room with my cheeks flushed and
my eyes growing hot and red, reading of growing suspicion and
denunciation and insolvency and pursuit and trial, and never had I
a doubt that he was an evilly entreated man.</p>

<p>He had almost got away from them. For days he was missing. He
had danced off to Paris, taken a ticket and a <i>lit-salon</i>
berth for Geneva, and vanished at Culoz. They had found him and
arrested him nine days later in a little out-of-the-way inn in
Biscay. When the detective broke it to him that he was known and
under arrest he had remarked cheerfully: "Good old Scotland Yard!
Have some déjeuner with us? It's awful stuff."</p>

<p><i>Us!</i> He had travelled with a typist-secretary as his
daughter. He thought, he said, that was a fresher disguise than
wearing a false beard. His levity on this delicate matter told
against him at the trial.</p>

<p>And his offence? That was rather a tangled business for a boy of
fifteen. I will not attempt to summarise that complex story here. I
could appreciate better the nine days' man-hunt that had preceded
his arrest. Even in the decorous Victorian <i>Times</i>&mdash;a
<i>Times</i> without headlines&mdash;I could detect the sporting
zest his disappearance gave the affair, and when later on I looked
up the case in other contemporary newspapers, I realised what a
bright addition to the British breakfast-table of that spring, the
chase of my father must have been. Tall Englishmen of easy manners
had been arrested at Marienbad and in Stockholm; all over Europe
his travelling compatriots must have been seeing him, sometimes
several times a day.</p>

<p>I saw the chase from the point of view of the hunted. I suppose
he knew how hopeless his flight was even from the first. But he was
always for giving the thing a trial rather than for giving in. But
there he was, dodging about at minor junctions and giving false
names at inns and wondering what the devil he should do when his
money ran out and, I guess, keeping up the delusion of his
pseudo-daughter that she was having a romantic elopement. And
treating her as it seems he did&mdash;strictly as his daughter. He
would not damage her more than he could help. All the while he must
have been going over the squalid sequence of rash falsifications
and expedients that had ended in his crash. So recently as a year
before he had been in no greater danger than that of a rather
florid and extravagant bankruptcy. Even then he might have pulled
through and recovered his prestige in the City. But he had been
unable to face a merely legal failure when just a slight
stretching, a further risk, a fraud that good luck would conceal
again, might tide things over. He did not want merely to escape;
his hopes grew with his dangers; even when the game was utterly
lost he had still attempted victory. He had been careless in his
manipulations, a little contemptuous, I am afraid, of the alertness
of his associates, a little too confident of their courage and
sympathetic dishonesty.</p>

<p>Towards the end he broke badly. His last exploits were hardly
more planned or intelligent than the flurry of a harpooned whale.
He plunged from misdemeanour to felony. His last falsifications
were puerile, and on those he was convicted.</p>

<p>And so after a futile struggle over the extradition they took my
father back to England. I imagine him concealing as much as he
could of his chagrin beneath a bearing still hectically debonair.
Back he came to the City of London, where he had been so brilliant,
so brilliant and meteoric a figure, and there he stood in the
ill-lit stuffy court and was examined and re-examined and wearied
and exhibited and disentangled and picked to pieces, picked to
discreditable shreds.</p>

<p>I realise now that he had never taken business quite seriously.
I perceive from one or two phrases of his under examination that he
was immensely astonished that a little more or a little less sharp
practice should make all this difference in his treatment by his
fellow-men.</p>

<p>Twice the judge, a fellow-member of his club, a successful
youngish man who had once looked up to him, had to reprove him for
"a certain familiarity" in his manner.</p>

<p>And then it became plain to him that it was really so, that he
was in a trap and the springe had closed upon his neck. There was a
line drawn between permissible and illegal sharpness, a miserable
line, and they could not see how slight a thing, how playful and
fresh a thing, it had been to overstep it. That dismally cheerful
train journey with the detectives, the restraints of his present
imprisonment, this dingy crowded court all eyes for him, were to be
only the prelude to a long grey, chill, eventless, undernourished,
unstimulated living burial. They meant it. They had got him and
they meant it. Well, he, at least, had had one saving moment of
foresight. Here the stuff was, close at hand. Here under his
finger. Good!</p>

<p>So he held his chin up and answered firmly to the end. Was even
humorous once or twice. There was laughter in court.</p>

<p><i>The Times</i> search-room seemed to contract upon me until it
became the waiting-room of a court and the helpful attendant might
have been a warder. It was as if I stood in my father's place. I
could understand it all.</p>

<p>Death is a very dreadful and tremendous thing to the adolescent
mind, but I felt that I could understand. I wished that somehow
when he stood up to hear the foregone verdict, alone without an
overt friend in a court crowded to overflowing with his enemies and
with merciless, curious spectators, he could have known that some
day his son would be there beside him in imagination and
feeling&mdash;not condoning but understanding. He would not have
wanted his offence condoned. I am sure there was no nonsense of
that sort about him. At last, almost as a relief, after his tedious
drawn-out defence, the verdict and the sentence must have come; the
old club acquaintance exalted and aloof, in his antic great wig and
scarlet gown, a successful windbag, giving the reporters in
particular his carefully prepared phrases, blaming, condemning,
pronouncing a sentence heavy and exemplary. Well, some of us have
to muddle and lose our game, but why add insult to defeat? Seven
years penal! And the rest of life, a few years of discredited,
pauperised age. Thank you for nothing, my lord.</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p>Did the stuff hurt? Did it seem as swift a poison as we suppose
it to be or did time drag ? Were there some moments, some minutes
even, while the capsule dissolved, minutes charged with fear
whether it would act at all, and then perhaps a frightful pang,
some numb horror or rending agony that none have ever lived to tell
about?</p>

<p>Then the blow of the wall as he fell against it, if ever he knew
he fell against the wall, and darkness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b2-sec5" name="b2-sec5"></a>§ 5. YOUNG WOLVES IN
BROMPTON</h2>

<p class="first">IF I had had any faltering of sympathy for my
father in his destruction, Dickon's sturdier simpler faith would
have sustained me. When I came to tell Dickon about it, he showed,
so far as I can remember now, that he knew most of the story.
Perhaps he had been put through it by schoolfellows; at any rate,
all his judgments were prepared. "They made him a scapegoat," said
Dickon. "They let him down." And, phrase reminiscent of rafts and
pirates and all the fierce imaginations of a boy: "He got the long
straw."</p>

<p>"They never touched his co-directors," said Dickon. "They were
too high up and too near royalty. Lord Duncomby was in it. Two
others. What were their names?... "But they took the stuff all
right while it lasted.</p>

<p>Trust <i>them</i>," said Dickon.</p>

<p>That was what I, too, wanted to believe. Our father had been
careless, indifferent, and they had caught him.</p>

<p>But he had only done what everybody did. "They don't catch
<i>me</i>," said Dickon, gauging the realities of life.</p>

<p>Neither of us believed that he was essentially worse than the
run of business men. We contemplated a brigand world.</p>

<p>In which after all he had made things that remained. All over
London were great buildings he had promoted. He had altered the
face of London&mdash;criminal though he was. He had been lavish
with his architects, and his ideas about service flats and suchlike
new methods of housing were far in advance of his times. Many of
his failures have since become richly paying properties. And though
he flourished in the worst period of English architecture he never
put up anything absolutely detestable. I remember Dickon stopping
me one day against the heavy but by no means ungainly masses of
Cornwall Court.</p>

<p>"That's one of the Clissold offences, Billykins. They called him
a scoundrel, but he gave them that. That's just one of his things.
Catch a muff like Lord Duncomby doing anything as fresh as
that!"</p>

<p>From the outset, because of our father's fate, we two saw the
world lawless and adventurous. We were precocious in that. Children
believe that in heaven and on earth alike there is order; they do
so naturally and of necessity, and most young people and many
people through life retain this early assumption that there is
justice and benevolence behind and sustaining the law, that laws
and customs are really wise and good. This is an illusion, or at
least an exaggeration; of great provisional value no doubt in
restraining youthful excesses; but it was one that our peculiar
circumstances forbade us to entertain. For if we agreed that the
system in which we lived was a righteous one, what could our father
be but a rogue? But if it was unrighteous and casual then he was
merely ill-starred.</p>

<p>There was a strong suggestion of the predatory animal about both
of us in those days after we had left Chislehurst and set up for
ourselves in Brompton. We had a mean furnished bedroom with two
narrow beds, a frayed carpet, a small wardrobe, and one wash-hand
stand, and a sitting-room lit by a central gas-light; the
accommodation was greatly restricted by the mute corpse of a black
piano the landlady refused to take away; and there was insufficient
table-room and shelf-room for our books and work. Our elbows were
therefore a good deal in each other's ribs. We neither of us
betrayed by any word we spoke how sick with longing we were at
times for the space, the freedom, and self-confidence we had had at
Mowbray, but we both knew what was in the other's mind and our
expressed intentions towards the future compensated for our silence
about the past. We would talk long and intimately at times, late at
night perhaps when there was a noise outside to keep us awake, or
on the way to the College, or of a Sunday when we walked in
Kensington Gardens or explored the endlessness of London to the
north and west, and then through intervals of days or even weeks we
would have no rational conversation at all. We would fend each
other off with silly nicknames and playful and nonsensical insults
and go our own mental ways alone. For days together we would
elaborate some fanciful joke&mdash;our standing dish about Mr. G.
for example&mdash;or invent and embroider upon a saga about some
odd imaginary personality.</p>

<p>We had an underworld, ten times more foolish than this world of
appearance, which underworld we called the Roops. The Doops
followed the events of the day and the fashions of the time after
their manner. The Boops had a Royal Jubilee; they had an Inventions
Exhibition in which Mr. Heath Robinson would have felt at home;
they held reviews of army and fleet; they worshipped curiously a
god after their own image, a Mr. B. In the Boops we guyed much of
our astonished chagrin at life and laughed it off. For we both had
a cheated feeling about life as if something had been promised and
snatched away from us.</p>

<p>Occasionally our excessive proximity got on our nerves. There
were forces storming in us that made us want to be alone with
ourselves for a time, made solitude an urgent need. Dickon would
warn me of a brooding violence.</p>

<p>"Billykins," he would say, "your little face fatigues me. Take
it right away before I buzz books at it. Lose it somewhere. Pawn it
for a day or so where it will be safe from damage. See?"</p>

<p>"Why the hell don't you go out yourself?" I would retort, savage
but preparing to depart. "Look at the rain!"</p>

<p>"You're insoluble&mdash;worse luck," said Dickon. "The door, my
lad, is there."</p>

<p>As he was nearly two stone heavier than I in those days I could
not banish him when the corresponding mood came upon me. I would
then go with my work into the Education Library in the South
Kensington Museum and there until the place closed at ten I would
read and write by the glare of great spitting violet-flushing
arc-lights of a type that have long since vanished from the earth.
Then home to a malignant silence and bed. Or it might be, with the
clouds lifting, to a tacit amnesty and talk into the small
hours.</p>

<p>It added to the natural restlessness in Dickon's blood that he
had still to find his calling in the world. In the meantime he was
working, but working neither so hard nor so well as I, first at
mineralogy and then at mining. "There's always something doing with
mines," he said, but he never seemed convinced that that was his
proper line of attack. He would have moments of pure rage against
the social system that environed us, that seemed so lax and yet was
so difficult and dangerous to assail. I remember him once in
Holland Park. "How the devil are we to <i>get</i> at them?" he
cried suddenly as though he had been stung. "How the devil?"</p>

<p>"Get at who?" said I, in the London idiom.</p>

<p>"In these houses. <i>Look</i> at them! Every one stands for
thousands a year. And I can't think of a dodge against them, not a
dodge. Idiot and fool I am!&mdash;unfit to survive. Like silly fat
sheep inside a wire fence they are, and I'm like some brainless
wolf. Look at this outfit coming along! Perambulator, two nurses,
and a Newfoundland dog. Large expensive toy elephant and a ball.
Fine fleecy blanket. All for one ratty, beady-eyed kid!... You ugly
little mite! Where does daddy get it? Where does daddy <i>get</i>
it?"</p>

<p>I was shocked. In those days I had not a tithe of Dickon's
voracity. I did not want money then. I did not want money seriously
until after I was married. I was under the spell of pure science
then, submerged in it, and while Dickon's work was almost
perfunctory I studied with all my strength. I was working in the
Physical Research Laboratory under C. V. Boys, then a very young
man, pink-skinned and flaxen-haired to the eyelashes, clever-handed
and delicate-minded, inspiringly ingenious, rapidly understanding.
How many brilliant and delightful minds have gone and go to the
making of science! Boys in those days was the worst lecturer I have
ever heard, so bored, so devastatingly bored, so appalled by the
hour of talk before him, but in the research laboratory he had
amazing flashes, he threw out sparks that set one alight. I had
been taken out of the ordinary class and allowed to do some special
work under him upon mineral threads and particularly fibres of
quartz, and it is difficult for me to exaggerate how much I owe to
him. He developed and encouraged my innate enthusiasm for physical
research. I began to dream of papers read before the Physical
Society; of the Philosophical Transactions, of broadening
explorations below the surface of matter. And my taste for such
work reinforced my distaste for money-making.</p>

<p>After all what use had I for money? Given a laboratory and a
lodging and a few pounds for a summer holiday, what else was there
to desire? Nothing that I permitted to rise to the surface of open
and confessed thought.</p>

<p>I tried to put my point of view to Dickon.</p>

<p>"You're dreaming, Billy," said Dickon. "You don't know what
you're in for. You think you'll give your life to science. They
won't let you. You've found your little corner at the college for a
bit&mdash;but nobody wants research, pure research, and so there's
nobody to pay for it. Try it if you want to, for a bit. Until you
need money or the college turns you out to make room for someone
else. The world's a scramble and you'll have to come into it.
Seeing what you are. Trust me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b2-sec6" name="b2-sec6"></a>§ 6. QUARTZ THREADS AND
SOCIALISM</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGHTS are parricides. Each phase abolishes and
devours its parent phase. Thought is always trial and selection and
discarding and forgetting. I can recall some of the things Dickon
said in those old days, and some that I said, and they stand out
like fragmentary ruins and seem to illuminate a little the past
state of the areas immediately about them, but as for the detailed
mass of that development it is gone, it is gone now as completely
as the lie of the houses and frontages and ownership round about
the Cathedral of St. Paul in London before the Great Fire.</p>

<p>We argued tremendously about Socialism and Individualism, but
what I meant by Socialism and what he meant by Individualism are
now, I perceive, things almost beyond recovery. I think my
Socialism and my passion for scientific work were all mixed up
together and that it was my sense of the scientific process that
dominated the mixture. I doubt if my views have changed
fundamentally in the intervening years, but I perceive that what I
called Socialism then is no longer to be called Socialism.
Socialism for me was certainly something quite different from those
vague aspirations towards a land of Cockaigne professed by Mr.
Ramsay MacDonald and his party when they are out of office, and
still less had it anything to do with the doctrines of Communism
that have since swamped it. It was, indeed, little more than the
application of the distinctively scientific spirit to human affairs
in general. I wanted to be part, an honourable part, of this clean
and orderly development of knowledge, strong, unhurrying,
wonderful, that I found going on in the research laboratory, and
from that point of departure it was easy to envisage the social
struggle as an indecent and preposterous inconvenience and to want
to extend the honourable openness, co-operation, and collectiveness
of the world of science to human affairs in general. The social
struggle impressed me even in those days as if I were required to
.fight for my chemical balance in the laboratory and knock out my
competitor before I could use whatever was left of the weights and
instruments. It was an intolerable distraction of attention, a
destruction of possibilities. I did not stop to consider how it had
arisen and whether, perhaps, it was not in some way necessary.
Possibly even more necessary than the scientific process. I simply
denounced it and demanded that it should be discontinued, that the
private ownership of the means of research and economic
exploitation should follow the private and secretive methods of the
Alchemists to oblivion.</p>

<p>While I clung to the opportunities for pure research that,
thanks very largely to Boys' good opinion of my work, I had had the
luck to find, I was saying therefore, but only, so to speak, with
the sides and back of my attention, "Get on to the Socialist State,
the International Socialist State, social peace and world peace,
and stop this tumultuous waste. Do in the search for food and
comfort and security what we are doing in the search for
knowledge." And as I was very much preoccupied then with the
crucibles and cross-bows that were our chief weapons against the
innate disposition of quartz to settle down into a compact
geometrical form, and with the problem of how to fuse that
refractory material to as fluid a state as possible and shoot it
forth, as swiftly as possible, so as to draw it out into the finest
possible threads before it cooled and set, I did not perhaps
sufficiently consider the very much less congenial and very much
more massive and refractory task I was proposing that other people,
conceivably beside me and behind me, should undertake. I just wore
a red tie once or twice, called myself a Socialist&mdash;chiefly to
my private self&mdash;and argued at nights with Dickon.</p>

<p>Now Dickon's more resentful turn of mind made him direct his
attention to just those things, the blunderings, the casualness,
the inconsecutiveness and injustice of the world at large, that I
was most disposed to ignore. He was then much more irritated by
life, much more in life, more combative than I was. At that period
of adolescence every year of age means a great difference of temper
and will. He had penetrated further into the jungle. And, moreover,
he was naturally more energetic and realist than I, more aware of
foreground things and less concerned about distant ones.</p>

<p>"You're trying to live in Utopia," he would say.</p>

<p>"You're living in a dream and you'll awake with a bump."</p>

<p>Our difference exercised him; he felt the implicit criticism of
himself. He would suddenly break into discourse&mdash;at the most
unexpected times. His words are all forgotten now, but I will try
to give the sort of things he would say; he would be sitting on his
bed, perhaps half undressed, marking his points with minatory
waggings of the collar and tie he held in his hand.</p>

<p>You can't live in a world that isn't here, Billykins; that's
what you don't grasp. That's what's the matter with you. This show
is a scramble and it's going to be a scramble yet for centuries.
You've got to look after yourself; you've got to look after the
things that you care for, yourself. You may want to do the most
disinterested things but you have to do them yourself&mdash;as your
fad. Poor people aren't permitted to have fads. I'd be a Socialist
just as you are if there <i>was</i> any Socialism. But it's only
just been thought of; it hasn't begun to come. They call all this
about municipal gas and water the coming tide of Socialism. Coming
tide! It's just a few Fabians piddling under a locked door. The
world's a world of private adventure yet for&mdash;far beyond our
lives, Billykins. Take it or leave it, that's what it is. And as I
want to live in this world and not in a world that isn't here, I'm
Individualist. It isn't a matter of chance as you seem to think.
It's a matter of necessity. I'm an Individualist and out for
private enterprise&mdash;which means in plain English going through
the pockets of some crowd one has corralled by dangling some
commodity before them, or making some other looter disgorge. And
then for freedom&mdash;and, if you like it, disinterested
service&mdash;scientific research&mdash;or anything else&mdash;as
the mood may take you.»</p>

<p>No, that is too clear and quintessential, too hard and definite
and contemporary, but it has something very <i>close</i> to his
spirit, and it is as near as I can get now to the discussions of
those days. The reality of our talks was much more loose and
inconsistent. We were trying things over; we were feeling our way.
We used claptrap phrases because there was nothing else to use, we
came home with remarkable discoveries that evaporated, we went back
upon ourselves, we jammed in flat contradictions and lost our
tempers. But what I have written has the clarified essence of it
all.</p>

<p>And here something strikes me. Until I began to write this
account of the ideas of my student time I had always assumed that I
was still a Socialist and Dickon still an Individualist. But now I
begin to think it over and try to write it down I find my Socialism
is very little more than an old railway label on a valise; it
records an important journey, indeed, but hardly a scrap of present
significance attaches to it. What I am writing here is, I realise,
no longer Socialism.</p>

<p>Where is that liberal Socialism of the eighties and nineties
now; that wide project to turn the expansive forces of the modern
world towards organisation and construction? It has expanded to
simple recognition and become incorporated in current thought, and
it has evaporated altogether as a movement and a cult. It is not
only that Socialism has become no more than a memory, a used label,
in my own life; it has become no more than a memory in the
world.</p>

<p>That journey has been made. It has gone&mdash;gone like
Chartism, like Puritanism, like the naturalism of Rousseau or the
civic virtue of Robespierre. And as I consider these things I wake
up for the first time to the quality of the Socialism that remains.
The movement did not realise the wider recognition of its broad
ideas. It became sectarian with organisation, it gave way to
impatient passion, it bore a narrow-souled, defective, and
malignant child Communism, and that child has made away with
it.</p>

<p>I am no more a Communist than I am a Catholic or a Conservative.
It is not that I have left Socialism, but that Socialism has passed
away from my world.</p>

<p>Socialist, Individualist; it is time we washed these old labels
off our intellectual baggage. They are no longer of use to us, and
they may easily send our wills and intentions astray.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec7" name="b2-sec7"></a>§ 7. SYSTEMS IN HISTORY</h2>

<p class="first">THE Socialism I knew and professed in my
scientific days was a project for a more spacious and generous
ordering of the world. But gradually that propaganda for a larger,
less competitive, scrambling and wasteful way of satisfying the
staple needs of mankind gave place to a vehement campaign against
existing institutions and usages, lumped together for convenience
of invective as the Capitalist System. I seemed to hear more and
more of the evils of the Capitalist System at every Socialist
gathering I attended, and less and less of anything desirable that
could be imposed upon its disorders. Gradually there loomed upon my
consciousness the legend of a tremendous book, which was to set all
other Socialist writings, teachings, and preachments aside, a
mighty book always, spoken of in those, days by its earnest young
propagandists as <i>Das Kapital</i>, in whIch this Capitalist
system was discovered and demonstrated upon as the source, the
engine, the form of all the oppression and robbery and parasitism
of man by man. A new sort of Socialist appeared, energetic,
opinionated, and intolerably abusive, and the moral and
intellectual decline of Socialism began. It ceased to be a creative
movement, and it became an outlet of passionate expression for the
inferiority complex of the disinherited. So it remains to this
day.</p>

<p>It is so much easier to vilify than plan; it is so much easier
to fix attention upon an injustice than a hope. All planning these
new Socialists derided, and they succeeded not only in feeling
themselves but in suggesting the feeling to others that "Utopian"
was the word for something contemptible and unphilosophical. What
need for planning? Had not the profound and stupendous Hegel, that
master intellect, that supreme if slightly incoherent God of Human
Thought, made it densely clear that the overthrow of the
Thing-that-is was in itself the creative establishment of the
Thing-that-it- is-not? And so all our young Socialists went about
being tremendously scornful and heroic, no longer working for a
worldwide organisation of peace and staple supplies, but simply for
the Thing-that-the-Capitalist-System-was-not, whatever that might
turn out to be.</p>

<p>These things came to me intermittently. I had little time for
Socialist discussion after I began to work with Boys, and I found
these new views bored and repelled me rather than irritated me to
the pitch of discussion. Now it is hard to recall even the
substance, much less the method of various disputes. I remember
making a bad impromptu speech at some meeting in Chelsea in which I
defended Utopian Socialism and was derisively handled. But I do not
think I was quick enough to realise in those days that the
Proletariat and Bourgeoisie about which these new Socialists
gabbled endlessly were absolutely indefinable classes, and still
less to apprehend that this Capitalist System of theirs was a
phantasmagorical delusion, a sort of Pepper's Ghost, thrown upon
the face of reality.</p>

<p>Nowadays I do not succumb so easily to our human disposition to
believe that where there is a name there is a thing, and I have
learnt to look behind the logical surface of every argument and
conviction. I find now in this retrospect that I can see round
quite a number of corners that defeated me in those days. Mere
everyday living is in itself a training against false
classifications and the habit of accepting unanalysed terms. Which
is one reason, I think, why we older people are more penetrating
and less logical than our younger selves.</p>

<p>A recent chance encounter, when I was last in London, comes back
into my mind, an illustration of all the qualities that make
Communism a travesty of intelligent revolutionary theory. It was
with a young man with a System to expound. If I had to argue a case
against Communism now I should take all the possibilities of
delusion that inhere in the one word "System" and rest my case on
that.</p>

<p>This word "system" has done extraordinary mischiefs not merely
with Socialism but in the whole field of political and social
discussion. Its peculiar treachery is the insidiousness with which
it imputes deliberate order to entirely unorganised things. A
system is properly an organised relationship such as one finds in a
system of pulleys or the metric system. But when the learned,
confronted with some quite possibly planless, discrete assembly of
facts, have sought to classify and arrange these in order to
discuss them the more conveniently, these arrangements have also
been called systems, whether the facts really responded or not, as
in the case of the Linnaean system or the Copernican system. It was
easy in the past, when men were entirely possessed by the idea of a
supreme designer, to pass from these systems of description to the
idea that the things classified were themselves systematically
arranged. Men, for example, spoke of the miraculous order of the
solar system as though it was something as definitely arranged as a
clock, and so hid from themselves the extreme casualness of the
relation of the sun to the more or less persistent satellites, the
planets, planetoids, comets, meteorites, and so forth that go with
it, like midges round a wandering beast, as it drifts through the
scintillating disorder of space. And with matters of social
arrangement this imputation of purpose and order where there is
naturally no order at all, is still extraordinarily
mischievous.</p>

<p>I remember how in my schooldays the endlessly complex social
muddling of mediaeval Europe, the swaying smash-up of the Roman
Imperium, was dressed up for us as the Feudal System. We were
taught to believe that there had existed a neat, universally
respected pyramidal arrangement of Society, in which every one knew
to the prettiest pitch of precision his level and his place and his
dues and duties. The natural disposition of little scraps of
floating wreckage to cluster about and adhere to larger lumps, the
obvious phrases, flatteries and conventions of such vassalage, the
customary humiliations of the abject and the ingenious devices of
the mediaeval lawyers, were seized upon by the romantic
imaginations of later historians and elaborated into a nicely
balanced scheme. Hundreds of millions of perplexed, instinctive
people lived and died while Feudalism floundered and changed
through the centuries of its prevalence, and never had the remotest
suspicion that some day earnest scholars would reveal how
beautifully systematic were their lives. And to-day millions live
and toil, suffer or prosper, and <i>only</i> by reading a very
bad-tempered and unattractive special literature or by falling into
some propagandist meeting do they get any explanation of what is
meant by this Capitalist System under which they are supposed to be
living.</p>

<p>Capitalism there is, no doubt; it is a complex of financial and
economic events arising out of purblind attempts to organise the
large-scale production rendered possible by modern knowledge and by
the enlargement of the modern imagination. But it changes in its
general facies yearly, monthly, hourly; it is never quite the same
thing twice nor here and there, and people who scold and blame the
Capitalist System and organise a revolution to overthrow it and
behave as though the millennium will necessarily ensue when it is
exorcised are wasting their strength upon a Protean shadow. They
are "seeing things" and fighting phantoms. There is no more a
Capitalist System now than there was a Feudal System in the
eleventh century. These are systems of description, far remoter
from reality than the systems of Linnaeus or Ptolemy. There has
never been any essential system in the general social and economic
life of mankind. Some day men may make these things systematic, but
the time is not yet. At present all these things are an immense
driftage, with an endless multitude of counter-currents and minor
eddies and a limitless variety of interactions. The most immediate
task before Man in his great adventure, as I see it, is to make the
system that is <i>not</i> yet here, to thrust and weld it upon this
chaos of his economic methods and ideas, and subjugate it to his
security and creative happiness.</p>

<p>I met a young man the other night at the studio of my nephew and
godson, William Clissold, who helped me greatly to understand the
working of this system obsession. "A regular intellectual stinker,
he was," said William, who affects a remoteness from things of the
mind. This young man, at once nervous, convulsive, and arrogant,
fell in very illuminatingly with my present line of speculation. He
was apparently incapable of thinking of human affairs except in
systems. I could not make it plain to him that I believed there was
no system at all in economic affairs; the idea was beyond his
intelligence. His main obsession was what he called the Manorial
System, a dressed-up revival on the economic side of the exploded
Feudal System, and he seemed to regard it as the clue to all
existing social and economic relationships, and was honestly
shocked when I professed never to have heard of it.</p>

<p>He was a discordant person even to the eye; he was rubricated at
the tips of all his features, he wore rimless spectacles, and his
hair was black, wiry, and discursive. His manner had a kind of
fierceness, his voice, which seemed to have corncrake blood, was
permanently raised, and his occasional laugh was like the wheels of
a heavily laden cart. How he generalised! There is nothing so
invigorating as a good generalisation, but it ought to go through
its facts and marshal them; it ought not to fly over their heads
and expect them to follow. He floated over the confused procession
of occurrences' as irresponsibly confident as the spirit of
creation once floated over chaos. He did it with such assurance
that he did not even know he was floating.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>ought</i> to know about the Manorial System," he
said. "It explains so much."</p>

<p>He expounded it a little. He opened a picture of the Middle Ages
as bright and clear as an illuminated missal. There was this
Manorial System of his all over the country, with wonderful
bailiffs and reeves and the court leet, particularly the court
leet. The land in his clear, gay vision of those vanished times was
cut up into nice little manors and rather larger little baronies,
all dovetailed together, all, it seemed, with vivid, quaint
coats-of-arms upon them, and to balance and complete them a Guild
System in the towns, sweet and subtle and humane. And happiness and
homely justice and art&mdash;remarkable art. And the Church kind
and grave in an attitude of benediction. And in the sky the stars
and all the Sons of God purring together.</p>

<p>I hardly liked to press him to tell me how it was this dear
Fairyland of his had collapsed into the evils of our own times. No
doubt the Reformation was much to blame for it, but the discovery
of America upset things; the Turks and Mongols were stupidly rough
with the warriors of Christendom, and the Black Death took the
meanest advantage of the merrie sanitation of the Manorial
System.</p>

<p>Fairyland it was, a Scholar's Fairyland, secure and aloof from
that dark wilderness which is history. For think of what those days
were in reality, the life in fortresses and castles, the towns like
criminal slums, the houses crowded together and locked and barred
and fortified against each other, bodies unwashed and clad in
coarse and dirty woollens as the finest wear, brutish communes here
and reigns of terror there, gangs in possession, monasteries and
nunneries illiterate and remote, sheer naked savagery in many
districts, and mud-tracks through the unkempt roads between the
towns, not a road except for some Roman highway in decay, not a
bridge except by way of atonement from some powerful dying sinner,
fierce dogs upon the countryside, hogs and stench in the streets of
the cities, pestilence endemic. And endless breeding of children
there was, to fester and die for the most part before ever they
grew to youth's estate. Here and there would be a region where some
accident of natural kindliness gave life a little space of April
sunshine; here and there perhaps one might find a tolerant
equilibrium of lazy lassitude, some lord or abbot in tidy or genial
mood. A little space at most and a transitory phase it was in the
ugly succession of cramped, distressful lives. And this fellow,
blind as a bat to facts that scream aloud at us from every
thick-walled, windowless, mediaeval ruin, from every museum with
its instruments of torture and its girdles of chastity, from the
stunted suits of armour in the old armouries, and from the flaws
and indecisions in the fabric of the patched, unfinished cathedrals
that were the chief achievement of that age, talked of his Manors
and Guilds and seemed to think a kind of Paradise might be restored
by setting back the clocks of history.</p>

<p>I questioned him, but I argued very little with him. I went away
to think him over in a mood of wonder.</p>

<p>Wonder ! Yet perhaps not altogether wonderful. A student of
physics or biology turns his back on the world at large and goes
towards a more concentrated reality&mdash;in the chemical balance,
the laboratory, the marine station. He must travel and explore. He
must. serve facts sublimated and released, facts that will blow him
to pieces or corrode him to death at the least levity on his part.
But a student of history or economics turns his back on his reality
when he turns his back on the world at large; he goes into a cave
of the winds in which documents whirl about before imaginative
gales. In that cave confident statements are stronger than facts.
He may lie, misjudge, and blunder; nothing will hoist him sky-high
or eat his flesh out or stain him purple for evermore. All the
circumstances of a scholar's life conspire to turn the mind inward
away from the dusty bickering of the common life. For him history
is not, as it should be, an extension of reality; it is a
refuge.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is something innate that in the first place
disposes a man to become a University teacher or specialist. He is,
I suspect, more often than not by nature and instinctively afraid
of the insecure uproar of things. Visit him in college and you will
see that he does not so much live there as lurk. He must find
infinite assurance, infinite compensation for the threatening
indignities of life, in the development of his lucid counter-world,
so much simpler, so much clearer, so entirely logical. Once he has
secured his cell he encounters little opposition; he may bid
good-bye to his worst timidities, and set to work secreting his
soul's protection. To deny a fact in that withdrawn and protected
atmosphere becomes more and more like defeating it, and to impose a
system on the confusion almost as good as conquering it. In his
classrooms, his lectures, his written controversies, the theorising
recluse can soon grow fierce and contemptuous enough; he can at
last down and out with his facts that are so intractable in
practice, to his own complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>And to live in agreement with a theory for any length of time is
like what the Americans call a common-law marriage; you and it are
wedded by habit and repute. A man wedded to a system is less and
less able to apprehend contradictory realities. He becomes like the
dogs and pigs people here in the South of France specialise to hunt
truffles; he can at last discover his system at the merest hint of
evidence, and all that does not countenance it ceases to interest
him, ceases to exist for him; he thrusts past it heedlessly,
scornfully.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec8" name="b2-sec8"></a>§ 8. PSYCHO-ANALYSIS OF KARL
MARX</h2>

<p class="first">AND now I can come to the maggot, so to speak, at
the core of my decayed Socialism&mdash;Karl Marx.</p>

<p>To him we can trace, as much as we can trace it to any single
person, this almost universal persuasion, which now Socialist and
non-Socialist share, that economically we are living in a definable
Capitalist System, which had a specific beginning and may have a
definite end, and that the current disorder of human affairs is not
a phase but an organised disease that may be exorcised and driven
off. Then after a phase of convalescence the millennium. For me he
presents the source and beginning of one of the vastest and most
dangerous misconceptions, one of the most shallow and disastrous
simplifications, that the world has ever suffered from. His
teaching was saturated with a peculiarly infectious class
animosity. He it was who poisoned and embittered Socialism, so that
to-day it is dispersed and lost and must be reassembled and
rephrased and reconstructed again slowly and laboriously while the
years and the world run by. He it was who was most responsible for
the ugly ungraciousness of all current Socialist discussion.</p>

<p>I have always been curious about Marx, the Marx of the prophetic
London days, and always a little baffled by the details that have
been presented to me. He seems to have led a blameless, irritated,
theorising life, very much as Lenin did before he returned to
Russia in 1917, remote from mines, factories, railway-yards, and
industrialism generally. It was not a very active nor a very
laborious life he led; a certain coming and going from
organisations and movements abroad in France and Germany must have
been its most exciting element. He went to read and work with some
regularity in the British Museum Reading-Room, a place that always
suggests the interior of a gasometer to me, and he held Sunday
gatherings in his Hampstead home and belonged to a club in Soho. He
had little earning power, a thing not unusual with economic and
financial experts, and he seems to have kept going partly by
ill-paid journalism but mainly through the subsidies of his
disciple Engels, a Manchester calico merchant. There was a devoted
wife and some daughters, but I know very little about them; one
married unhappily, a tragedy that might happen to any daughter; of
her one hears disproportionately.</p>

<p>He suffered from his liver, and I suspect him of being generally
under- exercised and perhaps rather excessively a smoker. That was
the way with many of these heavily bearded Victorians from abroad.
He grew an immense rabbinical beard in an age of magnificent
beard-growing. It must have precluded exercise as much as a goitre.
Over it his eyes look out of his portraits with a sort of uneasy
pretension. Under it, I suppose, there appeared the skirts of a
frock-coat and trousers and elastic-sided boots. He was touchy,
they say, on questions of personal loyalty and priority, often more
a symptom of the sedentary life than a defect of character, and the
"finished" part of his big work on Capital is over-laboured and
rewritten and made difficult by excessive rehandling and sitting
over. Examined closely, many of his generalisations are found to be
undercut, but these afterthoughts do not extend to Marxism
generally.</p>

<p>He tended rather to follow the dialectic of Hegel than to think
freely. There had been much mental struggle about Hegelianism in
his student days, much emotional correspondence about it, a
resistance, and a conversion. He competed with Proudhon in applying
the new intellectual tricks to the new ideas of Socialism. He
belonged in his schoolboy days to that insubordinate type which
prefers revolution to promotion. He was, I believe, sincerely
distressed by the injustices of human life, and also he was bitten
in his later years by an ambition to parallel the immense effect of
Charles Darwin. One or two of his disciples compare him with
Darwin; Engels did so at his graveside; the association seems to
have been familiar with his coterie before his death. And after
three decades of comparative obscurity his name and his leading
ideas do seem to have struggled at last&mdash;for a time&mdash;to
an even greater prominence than the work of the modest and patient
revolutionary of Down. But though his work professed to be a
research, it was much more of an invention. He had not Darwin's
gift for contact with reality.</p>

<p>He was already committed to Communism before he began the
labours that were to establish it, and from the first questions of
policy obscured the flow of his science. What did his work amount
to? He imposed this delusion of a System with a beginning, a
middle, and an end upon our perplexing economic tumult; he
classified society into classes that leave nearly everybody
unclassified; he proclaimed his social jehad, the class war, to a
small but growing audience, and he passed with dignity into
Highgate Cemetery, his death making but a momentary truce in the
uncivil disputations of his disciples. His doctrines have been
enormously discussed, but, so far as I know, the methods of
psycho-analysis have not yet been applied to them. Very interesting
results might be obtained if this were properly done.</p>

<p>He detected in the economic affairs of his time a prevalent
change of scale in businesses and production which I shall have to
discuss later. He extended this change of scale to all economic
affairs, an extension which is by no means justifiable. He taught
that there was a sort of gravitation of what he called Capital, so
that it would concentrate into fewer and fewer hands and that the
bulk of humanity would be progressively expropriated. He did not
distinguish clearly between concrete possessions in use and money
and the claim of the creditor, nor did he allow for the influence
of inventions and new methods in straining economic combinations,
in altering their range and breaking them up, nor realise the
possibility of a limit being set to expropriation by the conditions
of efficiency. That a change of scale may have definite limits and
that the concentration of ownership may reach a phase of adjustment
he never took into consideration. He perceived that big business
methods extended very readily to the Press and Parliamentary
activities. He simplified the psychology of the immense variety of
people, from master-engineers to stock-jobbers and
company-promoters whom he lumped together as Capitalists, by
supposing it to be purely acquisitive. He made his "Capitalists"
all of one sort and his "Workers" all of one sort. Throughout he
imposed a bilateral arrangement on a multifarious variety. He
simplified the whole spectacle into a process of suction and
concentration by the "Capitalist." This process would go on until
competition gave place to a "Capitalist-Monopolist" state, with the
rest of humanity either the tools, parasites, and infatuated
victims of the Capitalists, or else intermittently employed
"Workers" in a mood of growing realisation, resentment, and
solidarity. He seems to have assumed that the rule of these ever
more perilously concentrated Capitalists would necessarily be bad,
and that the souls of the Workers would necessarily be chastened
and purified by economic depletion. And so onward to the social
revolution.</p>

<p>This forced assumption of the necessary wrongness and badness of
masters, organisers, and owners, and its concurrent disposition to
idealise the workers, was, I am disposed to think, a natural
outcome of his limited, too sedentary, bookish life. It was almost
as much a consequence of that life as his trouble with his liver.
His work is pervaded by the instinctive resentment of the shy type
against the large, free, influential individual life. One finds,
too, in him that scholar's hate of irreducible complexity to which
I have already called attention. In addition there was a driving
impatience to conceive of the whole as a process leading to a
crisis, to a denouement satisfying to the half-conscious and
subconscious cravings of the thinker. It was under the pressure of
these resentments and impatiences&mdash;and with the assistance of
the Hegelian doctrine which tells us that the Thing- that-is is
always shattered at last to make way for a higher synthesis by the
Thing-that-it-isn't&mdash;that Marxism evolved its prophecy of the
ultimate and not very remote victory of the idealised worker. The
Proletarian would solidaritate (my word), and arrive <i>en
masse</i>, he would crystallise out as Master, and all things would
be changed at his coming. He would put down the mighty from their
seats and exalt the humble and meek. He would fill the hungry with
good things and the rich he would send empty away. The petty
bourgeoisie he would smack hard and good. And every one who
mattered to the resentful gentleman who was making the story would
be happy for ever afterwards.</p>

<p>It was a wish solidifying into a conviction that gave the world
this wonderful and dramatic forecast of the dispossessed
Proletarian becoming class-conscious, merging the residue of his
dwarfed and starved individuality in solidarity with his kind,
seizing arms, revolting massively, setting up that mystery, the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat, "taking over" the
"Capitalist-Monopolist state" and, after a phase of accommodation,
dissolving it away into a confused democratic Communism, the
Millennium. It is a dream story of things that are not happening
and that are not likely to happen, but it is a very satisfying
story for the soul of an intelligent and sensitive man indignant at
the distresses of life and living unappreciated in a byway.</p>

<p>It is for the pyscho-analyst to lay bare the subtler processes
in the evolution of this dream of a Proletarian saviour. Everybody
nowadays knows that giant, in May-day cartoons and Communist
pamphlets and wherever romantic Communism expresses itself by
pictures, presenting indeed no known sort of worker, but betraying
very clearly in its vast biceps, its colossal proportions, its
small head and the hammer of Thor in its mighty grip, the
suppressed cravings of the restricted Intellectual for an immense
virility. This Proletarian is to arise and his enemies&mdash;and
particularly an educated world very negligent of its
prophet&mdash;are to be scattered. There will then be a rough
unpleasant time for the petty bourgeoisie. Things of the severest
sort will happen to them. After the upper, they will get the nether
millstone grinding into them....</p>

<p>The respectable leaders of British Victorian Trade Unionism upon
whom Marx sought to foist this monster as their very spit and
likeness, seem to have been considerably dismayed by it. They felt
so much more like the petty bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>One need only run over the outstanding names of the movement to
realise how little the working man has had to do with the invention
of this fantastic Titan or, indeed, with the development of
Socialistic ideas at all. Trade Union and Labour leaders by the
dozen and the score have called themselves Socialists and
Communists in recent years, just as they have called themselves
Rationalists or Eugenists or Single-Taxers, but none of them have
laid hands of power upon the central edifice of theory. That, on
both its constructive and destructive side, has been the work
either of prosperous men bored by social disorder and waste, or of
irritated University students and scholars. Saint Simon was a
benevolent aristocrat, Robert Owen a capable employer, William
Thompson an Irish landowner, William Morris and Ruskin belonged to
the wealthy middle-class, Engels sold Manchester goods in Germany
with reasonable success, and Marx, our Marx of the relentless
class-war, Marx, in the ecstatic language of his biographer Loria,
"arose in a refined and aristocratic entourage," came from "an
extremely ancient stock devoted to' the accumulation of wealth" and
was "united by marriage to the race of German feudatories, fierce
paladins of the throne and the altar." Beer, in his history of
British Socialism, says Frau Marx was "related to the
Argyles"&mdash;related to the Argyles! it is near
divinity!&mdash;and speaks of Marx as a "proud mental aristocrat."
The intense hatred and contempt expressed in Communist literature
for the <i>petite bourgeoisie</i> is a further symptom of the
element of down-at-heel aristocracy in a state of bruised
self-conceit inspiring the movement. The stock Communist insult is
to imply that an adversary isn't a born gentleman. I doubt if the
theory of democratic Socialism owes nearly as much to real working
men as the sciences do, as geology, archaeology, and physics, for
example, do. It is a product not of the worker under oppression but
of unprosperous expectant types irritated by exclusion and
disregard.</p>

<p>In a tract by Lenin, <i>The State and Revolution</i>, written
upon the eve of the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, I find the
same smouldering resentment against all prosperous or educated
people reflecting the economic argument, I find the same resort to
the Armed Worker as the humiliator of negligent authority. Lenin
discusses with evident distaste the probability that the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat may need the services of educated
people other than its own prophets. He writes of them with a sneer
of the pen, so to speak, as "these intellectual gentry," and dwells
with satisfaction upon the fact that they will be at any rate
"controlled by armed workers."</p>

<p>Consider the values of that phrase.</p>

<p>A little while after this tract was written Lenin was dictator
in the Kremlin and the "intellectual gentry" of Russia, the men of
science and art and literature, were at his mercy. They might have
starved altogether in those troublous times if Maxim Gorky, the
novelist, who had a certain personal prestige with Lenin and a
strong sense of the value of things intellectual, had not
intervened. There was an attempt to organise their protection and
maintenance, and when I was in Petersburg in 1920 I visited an old
palace&mdash;the "House of Science" they had re-christened
it&mdash;looking out upon the grey-flowing Neva, to which a number
of "these intellectual gentry" had been shepherded. Control of the
world of the mind by armed workers did not seem to be a very
successful experiment. These men&mdash;and some of them had been
very important figures in Russia's intellectual and creative
life&mdash;were manifestly living in great misery and most of them
were doing little or nothing. They were ill-fed, scantily and
shabbily clothed, detestably watched, and with neither the books,
papers, nor apparatus needed for their work. Poor Glazounov the
composer was there, very wretched, the shadow of his former self,
cold and ill; he could do nothing with his time because the Armed
Workers would not hunt him out any music paper. He played some of
his music to me on an old piano and talked of the days that had
passed, and he wept. The chief Armed Worker directing the House of
Science was a Mr. Rode, who before the revolution had kept an
ultra-smart restaurant on one of the islands, a resort of gay
parties during the white nights of the Northern summer. He had
adapted himself to a Communist regime and he had a considerable
control of the dietary and general comfort of the interned
"intellectual gentry." Distinguished archaeologists, physiologists,
chemists and historians, great mathematicians and brilliant
teachers were in his power and fed from his hand. Maxim Gorky also
was looking after the place with the breadth of intention and the
practical incapacity of a genius and a Slav.</p>

<p>The social breakdown that has occurred in Russia is claimed by
the Marxists as their prophet's social revolution. This they do in
spite of the fact that he had pointed to England and the highly
industrialised countries of the West as the lands of revolutionary
promise. In truth the Russian collapse was like nothing Marx had
ever dreamt of. The Russian peasant soldiers, having been robbed,
starved, massacred, and misled by the Czar and his
ministers&mdash;six or seven of these poor devils had to be killed
in battle for everyone Austrian or German&mdash;reached the limit
of their endurance when they found that the Kerensky revolution
gave them no respite from the torture of the war. Two millions of
them had been killed and mutilated. They had had enough and they
would stand no more. They turned homeward to their villages. Once
they had started nothing could hold them. The Russian armies melted
away from before the Germans and Austrians and streamed home across
the land. F or a time Russia was in a state of social dissolution
such as this Western world has not seen since the Thirty Years'
War; straggling bands of armed men did what they liked with the
country through which they passed; robbery, rape, and murder went
free and unavenged. In many provinces there was a Jacquerie, a
château-burning. At times in bad places that Jacquerie rose to an
extremity of horror. Yet there was a kind of crazy justice in
it.</p>

<p>That was the true Russian Revolution, a social debacle, a
destruction of Czarism by its own weapon, the deliquescence of the
army.</p>

<p>Amidst the tumult of the disorganised towns there emerged the
Russian Communist Party, the only association of men with any
solidarity left in that frightful confusion. They were not workers,
they were not proletarians&mdash;in Russia there was practically no
Proletariat&mdash;they were a small body of Intellectuals with a
following of youthful workers and students, greatly helped by
sailors from the fleet. They grasped at power, they secured
machine-guns, they organised forces of their own, including a band
of Chinese, they shot, disarmed and restored a kind of order in the
towns and as far as the railways reached in the country. "They had
to shoot," President Masaryk told me on one occasion. "But they
went on shooting."</p>

<p>They went on shooting. They were men of no experience; many were
mere boys; they had fallen into irresponsible power and they had
tasted blood. They had an orgy of blood-lust sharpened by fear.
Then they set about the reorganisation of Russia upon Communist
lines, declaring that the word of the prophet was fulfilled and the
Capitalist System at an end.</p>

<p>They have held Russia ever since. They have held it because the
Whites are worse than they are and because they fend off foreign
interference and the return of the detested landlordism from the
peasants. But there seems to be some uncertainty even in the party
about the depth and quality of the resultant higher synthesis.
There is a hitch in the Hegelian sequence: no system has appeared.
There is no Communist system; it is a negation, a project-shaped
vacuum.</p>

<p>Since I do not believe there is or ever has been a Capitalist
System, I cannot get very excited about its alleged overthrow in
Russia or anywhere. But I do find myself very deeply stirred when I
think of the enormous wastage of good human hope and effort that
has resulted from this falsely simple statement of our economic
perplexities, this caricature of contemporary human life, as a
simple antagonism of two systems that never have existed and never
could exist.</p>

<p>I have been twice to Russia since the Revolution, and I was
there several times before it. I should find it difficult to give a
short general judgment upon the new ensemble there. With all the
judgments I have encountered, from the violently adverse to the
enthusiastically favourable, I :find myself in disagreement. The
peasant has got rid of his landlord, and if he is shot more
frequently he is whipped much less; the hysterics of the Czar and
his wife have given place to hysterical experiments; instead of
Rasputin's practical interpretations of Christianity one finds
Zinovieff's practical interpretations of Marx; education is more
general, but, if possible, less efficient; the railways are more
awful than ever, and if there is more cruelty, filth, and disorder
in the prisons there is less misery on the road to Siberia. If, as
is highly probable, the Bolsheviki have killed more people than
there are members of the Communist Party, we must set against that
the far more monstrous war waste of the Czardom. If Zinovieff gets
his way, the shadow of a giant war of the steppes against Western
Europe may materialise, but many things may happen before Zinovieff
gets his way.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to weigh the outcome of the Russian
Revolution in the scales of my partial knowledge and possible
prejudice&mdash;I had some irritating times in Moscow with the
younger Bolsheviks and I dislike the type actively. The present
"system" there, as I have been able to judge it, is just the same
old Russian "system," with many of the parts missing, many of the
wheels failing to cog, and many of its former patched-up
compromises dislocated. In the old days my busInesses could get
along In a fashion at the price of a considerable amount of
bribery; now they cannot get along at all; that is the most evident
difference to me. Old traditions still make Russian officials hold
one up, but the uncertainties of the new regime make them afraid to
do a fair and reasonable blackmailing deal. One is just held up to
no purpose. This is naturally irritating to a man who, like myself,
has kept a certain pride in his work, and has always been a very
temperate taker of profits.</p>

<p>The Communist formulae obstruct everything and have released
nothing. I have been to Russia twice to get some little of the
metallurgical wealth of the country out of the mess into which the
Bolsheviks have dropped it; our aluminium works are still in a
salvageable state at Dornoff, the only region of the world where
there are deposits suitable for the new Manson process&mdash;and if
only they would do the work properly I would gladly put the
Bolsheviks in complete possession rather than have all these
carefully adjusted arrangements going to waste. But each time I
have been treated with a stupid suspicion, kept waiting about for
weeks, watched and followed, my rooms searched in my absence, and
in the end I have been thwarted&mdash;for the mere sake of
thwarting me. I was quite willing to tell them all I knew about the
particular matters that concerned me, put all my cards upon the
table; for I want cheap aluminium and light alloys in the world as
badly as they want Communism. Why should they assume they are more
disinterested than I? The impudence of it!</p>

<p>But their theory required me to be a subtle and treacherous
representative of the Capitalist System, a thievish moneylender and
entangler of simple, brave, good workers, and themselves, raw,
young, and self-ignorant, the guardian angels of mankind. They had
no shadow of doubt about these moral values. Their ambition was to
lay me by the heels on a charge of "economic espionage." They had
their dirty prison and they had me, and they felt an opportunity
was being lost. The career of a good Communist depends upon
conspicuous displays of zeal. Were they showing <i>zeal</i>? They
would not listen to what I tried to tell them; that was obviously
only a blind. One fool said my science was "capitalist science" as
opposed to "proletarian science"&mdash;in metallurgical chemistry!
I battered myself against that sort of thing in vain.</p>

<p>What can one do with men who are inexorably convinced, in spite
of every material fact about them, that they have, germinating
under their hands, a new and perfect social system, the Communist
system, which they are defending from the subtle treacheries of a
wicked Capitalist System; and whose entire intellectual outfit is
unsleeping suspicion and a stock of ready-made nicknames by which
they can misconceive everybody?</p>

<p>There is no way round these fixed ideas. You are put on this or
that side of an opposition between entirely imaginary systems; and
in whatever direction you thrust the end is futility. So there is
our stuff in Russia untouched and badly wanted, and our works are
going to decay&mdash;beautifully planned works they are, though I
say it who shouldn't&mdash;doing no good to Russia or any human
being.</p>

<p>And this is mainly if not entirely an intellectual trouble, a
trouble of wrong statement, just as most of the great religious
wars of the past were mainly wars of wrong statement. The world
splits between Europe and the East and the limitation and misery of
hundreds of millions of lives is the by-product of an incoherent
argument about the interpretation of social interactions. An
imperfectly aerated old gentleman sits in the British Museum,
suffering from a surfeit of notes, becomes impatient to set a
generalisation in control of his facts, and presently we have this
harvest of tares. It is Arius and Athanasius and the camel driver
of Mecca I think of in his case, rather than Darwin.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec9" name="b2-sec9"></a>§ 9. REINCARNATION OF
SOCIALISM</h2>

<p class="first">SOCIALISM which was creative is stunned, and
Communism which is the sabotage of civilisation by the
dIsappoInted, has usurped Its name and inheritance. I have accused
Marx as the prime mover in the destruction of Socialism. But the
teaching of Marx would not have found impassioned and fanatical
followers, if there had not been something deep and widespread in
the human make-up to answer its appeal. This response came, I
believe, from the natural hate of men deeply conscious of their own
merits and conscious also of social disadvantages for those whom
Fate seems to have treated better. It is a response easy to evoke
in all too many people in a world so chancey as ours. Malice is a
necessary quality in an animal which has changed so swiftly from
solitude to an exasperated gregariousness as man has done. The new
Marxist Socialism, therefore, with its confident dogmas, its
finality and hardness, its vindictive will, developed an intensity
and energy that drowned and almost silenced the broader, more
tentative, and scientific <i>initiatives</i> of the older, the
legitimate Socialism. Communism, with <i>its</i> class-war
obsession, ate up Socialism as Catholicism, with <i>its</i> facile
consolations and definitive creeds, the Church militant here on
earth, ate up Christianity. Communism may live as long as Islam;
which is most like it of all other human things, as rigid and as
intense. It may endure long after the Moscow caliphs have passed
away, establishing a second system of fanatical resistances to the
comprehensive organisation of the world upon modern lines.</p>

<p>But the constructive conceptions that inspired the earlier
Socialism will not disappear with the fading-out of Socialism from
general discussion. They arise too easily in the natural
development of economic and social life. They may change their
phraseology; they may cease to be expressed in the old terms and
under the old name, but they will live. It may have been necessary
that Socialism should die in some such fashion in order to be born
again, revised, refreshed. There were extraordinary gaps and
imperfections, I realise, in the liberal Socialism of my student
days. The broad ideas of it, the ideas of a collective organisation
of the basal needs of mankind, of a systematic economy of the
energy that goes now to waste in competition for mere existence,
the idea of a complete abolition of forestalling, of obstruction
for gain and indeed of every sort of profiteering, these primary
Socialist ideas are more living now than ever they were. They have
infected the whole body of modern thought.</p>

<p>But among other obvious deficiencies, that nineteenth century
Socialism was almost wilfully blind to the necessity for a
scientific monetary method, a proper reckoning of obligations and
claims proof against manipulation, if any just and efficient system
of production was to work. Owen, indeed, thought of that
essential&mdash;Dickon has shown me recently a collection of Owen's
experimental "labour notes"&mdash;but his smaller followers in
their little wisdom dropped the question. If anyone mentioned money
in a Fabian Society meeting in my Socialist time there would be a
kind of general hoot: "0 Lord! Here's a Currency Crank!" Saying
"Currency Crunk" in a Fabian Society meeting was almost as deadly
as saying "Boorjaw!" in a modern Communist gathering. I have seen
Sidney Webb, our London Lenin, flushed, flustered, and irritated,
waving all that sort of thing aside. Bitter scorn, an earnest
scorn. Let us get on to sensible things. Morris to judge by his
<i>News from Nowhere</i> would have done without money; his other
contemporaries, it seems, thought that any old money would do. But
science is measurement, and money as we have it at present is about
as good for the measurement of social obligation as an earthworm
for the measurement of length.</p>

<p>Equally vague, evasive, and useless was the political attitude
of that old Socialism. The Socialists were proposing to
"nationalise" the means of production and distribution, but when
one asked who or what was to be the operating "nation," they had
nothing to suggest. Again came flushed impatience and a hasty
waving of the disturbing question away. Socialism, they recited,
was an economic not a political reform, which of course explained
everything. It seems incredible, but they seem to have believed
that economic justice and administrative efficiency were compatible
with any sort of political rottenness, division, and absurdity.
Never mind about that; the wise little officials would see anything
through. You see while Marxian Socialism was invented by
discontented professors, Fabian Socialism was largely the product
of hopeful Civil Servants. The psychoanalysis of Fabianism is as
destructive to its scientific pretension as the psycho-analysis of
Marxism. The only difference is that it reveals a brighter type of
soul.</p>

<p>These Socialists of my student days were entirely vague about
international relationships. It was uncomfortable for those Civil
Servants who did its thinking to imagine a world with quite a
different sort of Civil Service altogether. So they did not imagine
it. And though they could contemplate the expropriation of most
people they had an habitual respect for the possible resentment of
rulers and politicians and the governing class generally. None of
these nineteenth-century Socialists I heard and read were clear
whether they were nationalist or imperialist or international, or
what they were. They shivered at the word Cosmopolitan and sneered
at the phrase World-State. They did not even know whether they were
Protectionists or Free Traders; and to this day they do not know.
You will find a Labour paper like the <i>Daily Herald</i> scolding
vigorously at the private ownership of land and minerals in one
column and insisting in the next upon the "right" of some little
barbaric nationality to hold its territories and its natural
resources, however vast they may happen to be, against the needs of
all mankind. It would wrench the northern coalfield from the Duke
of Northumberland and leave all the minerals of the Riff to
Abd-el-Krim.</p>

<p>The petty industry in research of these Fabians affected to be
prodigious, but in general inquiry their inertias were astounding.
They were all for municipalising and nationalising, and yet they
would never consider with any patience or care the constitution,
the methods of election, the areas of control of the municipalities
and parliamentary governments to which with the utmost recklessness
they proposed to entrust the land, the natural resources, the
public services of the community. So long as it was an elected body
and not an assembly of private persons they did not seem to care.
The community was just to elect somebody, somehow, anyhow, and the
clever little official would tell that somebody what to do. Gross
energetic men, it seems, were to wait and plan and spend and fight
vehemently for power&mdash;and then, whichever of them won it,
would hand it over meekly and trustfully to the wise, good, quiet
"experts" waiting in their bureaus.</p>

<p>Socialism took over a prevailing belief of the time when it took
over the belief in the necessity for elected bodies. There was no
need to take over that belief, and had the movement been a really
full thinking movement it would not have done so. But in the
nineteenth century A.D. it was believed as firmly that it was
necessary to have some sort of election, any sort of election,
however preposterously conducted, before the affairs of the
community could be administered, as it was believed to be necessary
to have some sort of blood sacrifice before seed-time in the
nineteenth century B.C. It was the current superstition. It fades.
When. creative ideas emerge again into a definite system of
proposals, I believe we shall find them completely detached from
this delusion that they can be realised only by, through, or with
the consent of elected persons. There will be no further research
for majorities. Realisation of a new stage of civilised society
will be the work of an intelligent minority; it will be effected
without the support of the crowd and possibly in spite of its
dissent.</p>

<p>I am now, more than ever I was, a revolutionary. Every year of
my life makes me more certainly revolutionary. I believe that
before the muddled and very insecure process of the world's affairs
now current can be changed into a stronger, broader, happier,
progressive organisation, many habitual resistances will have to be
overcome and many legally established institutions which will
refuse to undergo the modifications and subordinations necessary to
adapt them to a scientifically conceived world civilisation will
have to be cleared away. The legal standing of such old,
obstructive, entrenched rights will have to be changed by
imposing&mdash;in a manner essentially illegal&mdash;a different
legal standing upon them. No human legal system has ever
voluntarily abolished itself in favour of another. Fundamental
changes of political and social method must be effected by
pressures exercised by the sort of people who have a will for the
better order. There is no way round such a necessity that I can
see. This may not mean actual violence, but there will be at least
the intimation of superior strength. If that sort of thing is not
revolution, then I do not know what revolution is.</p>

<p>I believe that ultimately man, collective man, has to suppress
the sovereign independence of any part of the world as against the
whole. He cannot get on very much beyond our present sort of
civilisation until he has contrived a world currency, a world
control of staple production, a world peace&mdash;and, in fact, a
world state. He has to regard prescription and proprietary claims
as entirely secondary and provisional arrangements in dealing with
the land, with the natural resources and the material organisation
of the earth. No quibbling can make dispossessions and
redistributions of ownership and sovereignty, in the face of
protest, legal acts; and no evolutionary process that does not
involve death and birth, putting an end to old things and beginning
again with new things, can ever bring about the new world implicit
in science and in manifested human possibilities.</p>

<p>But when I think of revolution I have in mind something quite
dIfferent from the idea of a Revolutionary that has dominated the
human imagination since those violent days in Paris a hundred and
thirty odd years ago. I have no use for that Revolutionary of the
Communist placard type, that pithecoid Proletarian, dishevelled,
semi-nude, making heroic motions with improvised weapons behind a
casually assembled barricade of beams, paving-stones, overturned
carts, pots, pans, railings. I look, indeed, for something
antagonistic to that. I look to the growth of a minority of
intelligent men and women for the real revolution before mankind. I
look for a ripening elite of mature and educated minds, and I do
not believe progress can be anything more than casual and insecure
until that elite has become self-conscious and effective. I do not
look to the mass of people for any help at all. I am thinking of an
aristocratic and not a democratic revolution.</p>

<p>Except as scavenging or fertilising floods, I do not believe in
democratic revolutions. I believe the multitude, when it is
suitably roused, can upset anything, but I do not believe that it
can create anything whatever.</p>

<p>I quite understand the dismay that comes upon every impatient
world-mender when he seeks creative forces among the prosperous
people of to-day. Most of them are prosperous by reason of some
flaw or direct iniquity of the economic muddle, and they are
vaguely aware of that; they do not want any examination of the
complex of disarrangements that gives them the advantages of their
property; as a class they are prepared to defend the stacked-up
instabilities they call the "existing system" very stoutly. But
there are exceptions to the conservatism of the prosperous. Many of
these exceptions are personally or vicariously curious and spend
their resources upon research; many, like myself, are bored to
death by the poor mean pleasures, displays, and gratifications our
prosperity can buy, and many have a really disinterested creative
impulse. It is to the increase in number of these exceptional types
and to the spread of an inquiring and adventurous spirit in this
class that I look for the continuation, acceleration, and extension
of social and economic progress towards a new and finer world
order. If the class-war idea is sound and liberated people are
necessarily less socially disposed than frustrated and limited
people, then manifestly there is no hope for mankind.</p>

<p>No doubt our present social complex is still heavily loaded down
by an accumulation of dull and heavy creditors, parasitic, greedy
speculators, and unproductive spenders generally, but social life
has always had to carry such a burden of selfish and obstructive
prosperity since social life began. Relatively I do not think there
is more of that burden now than there was two hundred years ago. I
think there is less of it. And it has less pride and assurance.
Read any eighteenth-century novel and mark the amelioration of
social attitudes. There is no reason why we should go running off
in a passion to fields, slums, workshops, mines, railway-yards,
docks, the forecastles of ships, gaols, and institutions for the
reorganisers of society, because the imaginations of the fortunate
classes are still largely unstimulated by creative ideas that are
hardly a century old. It is true that the lives of the majority of
mankind to-day are insecure, anxious, limited, laborious, stunted,
unfruitful, and generally unhappy, and that they will remain so
until economic order is attained. But because masses of toilers and
needy people are thoroughly uncomfortable it does not follow that
they are capable of the subtle and intricate adjustments needed to
make themselves and mankind free and happy. It does not follow even
that they are capable of recognising those who are attempting to
make them free. They are very properly disposed to discontent, and
many of their livelier minds find the idea of a class-war
attractive, but I doubt if their conception of that class-war is
anything but vindictive. It is not a better order they want but
witness the Communist hatred of the petty bourgeoisie, malicious
reprisals against the slightly more prosperous class immediately
and therefore most irritatingly in contact with them. The most
dreadful thing about their situation is their evident inability to
imagine any better order. They do not want a change; they want an
inversion without a change. They have grown up in a coarse and ugly
way of living, and their first impulse, so soon as they realise the
coarseness and disagreeableness that has been put upon them, is to
extend it to everybody. "See how <i>you</i> like it!" They want
that far more than they want a new way of living. They know
instinctively that a new way of living would be unpleasantly
discordant with their established habits.</p>

<p>One may sympathise with that vindictive impulse, but I do not
see that one is called upon to assist it. The sense of frustration
in a hopeless toiler may be keen enough to make even sabotage a
pleasure, but I have other tastes. For three-quarters of a century
Socialism under the spell of Marxism has cherished the delusion
that in the masses there is a huge reservoir of creative power.
There is nothing in the masses as masses but an unreliable
explosive force.</p>

<p>The greater revolution must be a deliberate and not a convulsive
process. It has to fight against the egoist and fool in man, the
ancestral, instinctive brute, as much in the suspicious and angry
mob below as in the timid, mean, and violent propertied classes
above. It has a far greater percentage of possible adherents among
the educated and able than in the crowd. Just as we depend for the
gigantic services of scientific progress upon at most a few score
thousand rather unpopular individuals mostly of the middle and
independent classes, so the task of bracing, ordering, and clearing
this very cruel and wasteful jungle of human affairs may remain for
some generations still in the hands of quite a few obstinately
clear-headed men and women. They have to work hard and be patient;
there is nothing else for them to do; they cannot indulge in the
emotional gratification of premature organisation and simplified
propaganda. They will be men and women of experience, who have
learnt about human affairs by handling them; they will be prepared
for formulae that will not simplify, and for incurable intricate
problems. Ultimately this sort of people will acquire the necessary
force and knowledge to change things systematically, and then they
will set about doing so. Their convictions will radiate into the
general mass. They will reshape the general conceptions of
economic, political and social life.</p>

<p>Their revolution will involve much greater and much more
sustained operations than barricades in the streets and little
squitterings of machine-gun fire. They will have a different sort
of strategy than the disorganisation of political parties and
subtler methods than sabotage schemed in cellars and the
misdirection of honest discontent. I do not see why thwarted
pedants and unlicked youngsters should be allowed to monopolise the
excellent name of Revolutionary for ever, nor why restless
shop-stewards and .the sort of defectives who set fire to things
should imagine themselves sole lords of human hope.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec10" name="b2-sec10"></a>§ 10. IRRUPTION OF
MIMOSA</h2>

<p class="first">THIS morning my work has been interrupted.</p>

<p>I have been raided and assaulted by Clementina.</p>

<p>She has come into the room with an armful of mimosa, iris, and
white and purple stock, and stuck this pretty stuff all over the
place. She has made a great disturbance because I was not going to
have my lunch out of doors in the sun&mdash;they are laying it out
there now all over again&mdash;and her beastly little animated muff
of a dog has chased my grey cat up the Japanese medlar. It is the
fifteenth of January, and she declares the Provençal spring
arrived. But that is no reason why she should constitute herself
Primavera and cumber my study with an excess of flowers.</p>

<p>"It's no good," she said. "I can't keep away from you to-day."
And she hasn't. She has ruined my hair. She has also ruined my
mind.</p>

<p>She seized upon some pages of this manuscript. "Oh! Marx!" she
cried with a note of disgust. "Capitalism! Revolution!" She put the
sheets down. "I thought you were writing your life. I thought I was
going to read something about you. I thought it was going to be
about yourself!"</p>

<p>"This book," I said, "is not for you."</p>

<p>"You told me about it one day."</p>

<p>"In a moment of weakness. It is hard not to talk at times to a
woman who besets one as you do me. But what I said
was&mdash;inexact."</p>

<p>"Obviously. If you are writing about <i>-isms</i>, I'm not sorry
I interrupted you. I thought it was to be about yourself and what
you had made of the world. I thought I should get an idea of what
you were like when you were a young man."</p>

<p>"I have a section to finish. And the door is just behind"
you."</p>

<p>"I'm not going. I'm not disposed to go. It's spring. And near
lunch-time."</p>

<p>"You are going," I said.</p>

<p>I do not know why I scuffle and romp so easily with Clementina.
Certainly there is spring in the air to-day.</p>

<p>But now she has a better idea of what I was like when I was a
young man. She has been at last more or less thrown out of this
room in a properly pacified, subdued, and crumpled condition, and I
find myself turning over my writing and reassembling the ideas she
dissipated by her wanton invasion.</p>

<p>It is true that the last three or four sections have been mainly
devoted to Marx and Socialism, but that is no more than a
digression from the account of my world than the theology of the
First Book. Why should one entertain the idea that a man is no more
than his face, his mannerisms, and his love affairs? A man, if he
is to be rendered completely, must begin with the creation of the
world so far as it specially concerns him and end with his
expectations of eternity. If a man is to be given completely, there
must first be the man and his universe, then the man and history,
and only after that man and other men and womankind. My struggle to
apprehend the social conflict about me in terms of Socialism was at
least as much a part of me as the poor little marriage and the poor
little half-divorce I shall presently have to reveal&mdash;and my
subsequent proceedings.It played as large a part in shaping my
life&mdash;a larger part.</p>

<p>It is plain to me that, having swept aside the Communist idea of
a revolution and thrown some passing doubts upon the economic
interpretation of history, I am bound to give a version of the
human story that seems to me to be truer. I am bound to indicate
and in a measure explain my conception of the world of toil and
business in which I have struggled and won freedom and security for
myself. Every autobiography that is written for more than a special
circle of readers must be thus encyclopaedic. My eyes are
astigmatic; my mind is no doubt ill-informed and incompetent; that
is all the more reason why I should tell of things as I see them
and of all the things I see, and not assume that I see them in some
correct and standard fashion.</p>

<p>A writer may affect modesty and deal with these broad issues by
reference. But is that modesty? He may defer to recognised
authority. He may declare that so far as recognised authority goes
he has no world of his own. He may say, "In matters of religion I
follow the teaching of the Holy Catholic Church," or "Upon
questions of economics I submit to the superior knowledge of the
economists." But is not the good man assuming that he has so
complete a knowledge of the teachings of his church or of the
orthodox economists as to be sure to think upon all issues exactly
as they do? He commits his church or his science to all his
implications. Though he disavows authority, yet he presumes
excessively to knowledge.</p>

<p>To achieve the perfect robe of perfect modesty should he not
rather say, "I follow the teachings of my church so far as I know
and understand them; I am conscious of limitation and even of error
on my part, but I do my best," and then he should go on to set
forth his own defective interpretation. "That as I see it," he
should say, "is the teaching of the Church. That is my humble
reading. By this I have guided myself. I may be in grievous error,
but this is what my authority has meant to me." It is his
interpretation that matters to us, and claims our interest in him.
Or else, why autobiography at all? The existence of perfect
solutions that he mayor may not understand does not excuse him.
These we can study without his help, but his reaction to them is
another matter. We do not want him to give us these things in
perfection; we do want to see them in fallible operation. And so we
bring his modest gentility back, blushing prettily no doubt, to the
full encyclopaedic range again.</p>

<p>In the next two or three sections I propose to write a short
history of human society as a labour-money complex evolved out of
the primitive patriarchal family. They will have to be highly
concentrated sections. This book, at any rate, is not going to be a
home of rest for tired readers. If presently Clementina repeats her
aggressions, she will find sheets of discussion about how toil came
into the world and what money did for the Roman Empire. "Old
economics!" she will cry. For the life of me I cannot get either my
father's disaster or the business achievements of Dickon or myself
into any sort of focus without that background. And as for
Clementina&mdash;!</p>

<p>Clementina has a mind like one of those water insects that never
get below the surface of anything. Waterboatmen they are called,
and they flicker about sustained by surface tension. She just
flickers about. She professes an affection for me that is
altogether monstrous, and she knows no more about my substantial
self than the waterboatman knows of the deeps of the pond. She
knows as little about the world.</p>

<p>Why is a person with so quick an intelligence and such wise
instincts as Clementina mentally so superficial? Why does she
habitually dismiss three-quarters of human concerns as
uninteresting? Is it some sort of mental economy? For gossip,
excursions, household matters, and making love, Clementina has an
abundant, swIft, penetrating, and indefatigable intelligence. She
has subtlety; she has invention. The poetry she writes shows at
least a keen appreciation for poetry in general and also for a
certain prettiness in things at large that she has not learnt from
pre-existing poetry. But she will not even look at the framework in
which such things are set and which is continually affecting and
determining such things!</p>

<p>I am reminded of something I was told the other day by a man who
is by way of being a prominent historical writer. He was
"approached," as they say, by one of these big American film
producers. People, the film man apologised, were displaying a
certain curiosity about the general history of mankind. It was an
unaccountable lapse, and no doubt a temporary one, but it could not
be ignored. Would it be possible for my friend to prepare the
scenario for a series of films of such a history? A glimpse was
given, carelessly but attractively, of dollars falling in
showers.</p>

<p>My friend considered various difficulties, but decided that
something of the sort could be done. "The public wants to know
about things," he agreed. The film man expressed great optimism
about the scheme&mdash;but in rather doubtful tones. His reason was
in conflict with his instincts and mental habits. The latter were
the better exercised and the more powerful. There was a pause in
the discussion. It was evident that a difficulty had to be
considered.</p>

<p>"I wonder now," said the film man, "if it wouldn't be possible
to run some little <i>story</i> through this series, something
about a boy and his girl and a bit of trouble between them or a
revenge or something of that sort. <i>So as to have a thread of
human interest in it.</i>"</p>

<p>A thread of human interest&mdash;in the history of mankind! The
conversation ended in discord.</p>

<p>For Clementina there is apparently no thread of human interest
in economics&mdash;that is to say in the toil, payment,
enslavement, or liberation of scores of millions of human beings.
Of history she has much the same opinion as the film man. Geology,
of course, means nothing to her but "old rocks," palaontology
nothing but "old bones." It is inconceivable to her that anyone
should be interested in theology. Sociology makes her impatient and
politics rude. Yet though she has renounced all the vanities of the
world in order to come and live near me in the less accessible
lanes of Provence, she can still muse pleasantly, during one of our
rare trips to Cannes or Nice, before a hat-shop window. That, she
feels, is "life." As surely as biology isn't. And with her flitting
glance she is just a sample of general readers everywhere. They do
not care whence they came nor whither they go nor what they are
doing. They just flicker about. They will be water-boatmen till the
stream dries up....</p>

<p>But it occurs to me that Clementina has had to wait an
unconscionable time for lunch. What patience she has shown! She is
almost directly under this window and she has not called up once.
Probably with a pensive calm that sometimes descends upon her after
misbehaviour she has been eating up the beetroot and olives.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec11" name="b2-sec11"></a>§ 11. HISTORY OF TOIL
THROUGH THE AGES</h2>

<p class="first">FIVE thousand years ago our ancestors can have had
no more economICS than the animals; they lived from hand to mouth
where the food was. If the food diminished they wandered away. If
they could not find more food they weakened and perished like any
other beasts. Their gear was just a skin and a stick and a stone or
so, not more than could be trailed or carried. A stranger was an
intruder and better killed. The old man killed or drove off his
sons, and was the lord of all his womankind, lord indeed of his
visible universe, until a younger and a stronger adversary came to
dispossess and end him. If his equipment was simple his ownership
at least was immense; he recognised no other rights in the world
but his own, and he died fighting for them.</p>

<p>The first step towards human accumulation on a broader scale was
taken when the Old Man came to recognise the right of another adult
male to live within sight or smell of him. This first mitigation of
the possessive instinct was the foundation of human society. The
women trained their boys in the fear and avoidance of the Old Man,
to regard all his belongings and particularly their mothers and
stepmothers and sisters as tabu, and in return they persuaded the
Old Man to tolerate the existence of his sons, and at last, in the
course of ages, even to allow them the right to possess the strange
girls they caught and dragged home with them to the family
fireside. That is the only credible story of the beginnings of
human society I have ever found in anthropology. It explains the
primordial incest tabu, and the worldwide traces of marriage by
capture, and a score of worldwide primitive customs that are
otherwise fantastic. And it marches with most of the complex
suppressions that lie at the roots of our modern mentality. It
follows that the first private property to infringe the universal
dominion of the Old Man was property in a woman.</p>

<p>One can still hardly speak of economics even after the ape
family had passed into the primitive human tribe. The tribe
personified in the Old Man still owned so far as it ranged; it
hunted in a pack and feasted from one carcass; most of the
implements it used were made by those who were going to use them;
there may have been a little bartering of ornaments and curious
oddities between individuals and mutual present-giving, but there
was still nothing in the nature of work, of employment, as we
understand these terms. Mothers worked for their children and got
them food and watched over them, as animal mothers do. Probably
children and inferior women were the first human beings made to
work beyond this instinctive devotion; they were sent out to find
and bring home sticks for the fire or berries or small edible
creatures. The first reluctant worker may have been a fire mender.
The first workers were in much the position of the modern labouring
man's wife; they did all that had to be done, and they got no pay
beyond their keep and their owner's attentions. Maternity had given
woman a greater submissiveness to routine drudgery than man, and
probably the greater part of the simple duties of the cave and the
squatting place fell to her.</p>

<p>The early Palaeolithic human tribe could have been only a stage
more advanced economically than a pack of wild dogs. They had their
fire and implements to the good. They had become more carnivorous
and had perhaps grown bigger and stronger than their more solitary
ancestors. The expansion of toil as the tribe grew and possessions
and elaborations increased, fell no doubt upon the shoulders least
able to evade it. There is no natural instinct for toil in man. He
likes to make things but with as little trouble as possible.
Already in Palaeolithic times a considerable and increasing amount
of human intelligence and energy was being devoted to shifting toil
upon the shoulders of somebody else. As human societies grew larger
and better equipped and the necessary labour increased, oppression
became more intelligent and systematic. The Old Man in the ape-man
stage just killed and maltreated; the chief of the primitive human
tribe directed and employed his folk, the women almost naturally
and the men as much as he dared, and punished the idle among them.
Sometimes perhaps there was not one single chief but three or four
big fellows who had learnt to respect each other.</p>

<p>That was the quality of the "primitive communism" so many worthy
anthropologists have seen fit to idealise.</p>

<p>As hunting tribes and herd-following tribes developed into
cattle-herding and cattle-driving, and as agriculture, first of
snatch crops and then of settled regions, appeared, an ever rising
tide of labour poured into human experience. The hungry picknicking
freedom of primordial man gave place, age by age, to the more and
more regular work and regular meals of the agricultural man, under
the guiding compulsion of the chiefs and elders of the community.
The children as they grew up found they had to work; the young men
had to work. That it had once been unnatural to have to work was an
idea beyond the brief range of human thought in those days. As soon
could a draught-horse think of freedom. An anxious industriousness
was gradually imposed upon the men of the agricultural regions, a
moral impulse towards activity. To be an idler became a new shame
almost as great as the older one of being a coward; one pretended
not to be lazy just as one pretended not to be afraid; and man
began to store like the squirrel and worry about the future.</p>

<p>It was only with the development of agriculture that man became
a truly economic animal; the first of the vertebrata, I suppose, to
be truly economic. Hitherto the chief economic creatures had been
the ants and termites and bees. To become economic is first to
become the watchful servitor of vegetable growth; that is the
essence of it. Nomadic predatory peoples never succumbed to the
delusion that industry is in itself a virtue. It seems to me fairly
certain that there was a barbaric stage in human development when
most of the tribe worked on such occasions as demanded work, under
the direction of the chiefs and medicine men, and that they did it
as a matter of course, without wages or personal reward. The labour
was communal&mdash;that is to say, only the very strongest could
shirk it; the product was communal&mdash;that is to say, the weaker
got what they were permitted to get out of it. Probably there was
little private personal property beyond wives, ornaments, weapons,
huts and suchlike things. The cattle and lands belonged to the head
men. Or some cattle on the common land were perhaps ear-marked for
individual owners and the rest belonged to the tribal heads.</p>

<p>I think it is a fairly obvious and very important thing that, to
begin with, trading had little or nothing to do with the economic
life of the tribe. In our present life, trading, with its later
instrument, money, is so intimately mixed up with staple production
that people are apt to forget the two were once separate processes
and dealt with different orders of necessity and desire. A barbaric
agricultural people could, if necessary, live a fairly full and
complex economic life without any trade or any pay whatever, and
with scarcely any private property. Trading was an extra thing, a
function, and not the most important one, of such seasonal
gatherings as may have occurred.</p>

<p>An early enrichment of the primitive economic scheme must have
been the slave, either the stolen child or the spared captive. Just
as the stolen woman came into the early Palaeolithic human group as
the first private wife, so as the Neolithic order developed, the
slave came in as it more amenable worker than the tribesman. Before
the Neolithic stage there was little use for slaves. A stranger
child could be taken along with the tribe like a captured wolf-cub,
and petted or ill-treated, outraged or adopted as luck would have
it. It was agreeable to have a human being to do exactly what you
liked with, a motive which, as the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children knows only too well, still leads queer people
to take over the care of orphan children. And all sorts of small
irksome services could be put upon a youngster too timid to run
away into the wilderness.</p>

<p>That was probably the limit of slavery while man was still a
wanderer, An adult male slave was of little use to nomads; his
escape was comparatively easy. If he proved to be a helpful person
it was better to make him a member of the tribe. But as
agricultural work increased, men and women captives, used hitherto
chiefly for sacrifice and torture and suchlike amusing but
transitory ends, began to have an economic value. The heads of the
tribes got a more tractable service from them. Their spirits could
be broken entirely because they were not wanted for fighting
purposes like the young men of the tribe. They could be used up
more completely. The Egyptian turquoise mines in Sinai, as early as
the days of the First Dynasty, were worked by slave labour.</p>

<p>There must always have been great local variations of the early
barbaric state. We make a great mistake, we fall into the System
myth, when we suppose the early barbaric community to have had a
stereotyped pattern. It had certain common tendencies; it developed
under certain common necessities; all the world over, men's minds
are much alike. And though communications were difficult, men were
as imitative and perhaps more imitative than they are now. The
tradition of the Old Man of the primitive days gave here a God and
there a God-King and there a King-Priest. Wherever agriculture went
there went with it the traditions of a blood sacrifice, a human
sacrifice. I have never been able to imagine satisfactorily why
this should have been so; but very plainly it was so. In the old
world that blood sacrifice became very generally mitigated; in
America, under a mysterious tendency towards harshness manifested
by that continent, it developed to tremendous proportions until it
obsessed a civilisation. The Maya, the Aztec, religions were
insanely bloody. With agriculture, too, came an enormously clumsy
primitive astronomy to determine the coming of inundations and the
propitious phases of the year for sowing. Pyramids and obelisks
acted as gnomons, temples were oriented to stars. It is wonderful
to think how widely and vividly those opening phases of
civilisation have been studied and made plain, within my
lifetime.</p>

<p>Side by side with the largely agricultural hard-working
communities of the warm alluvial countries there developed endless
less agricultural and mainly nomadic groups, grazing sheep, driving
cattle, and in Central and Eastern Asia keeping herds of horses.
They traded, they conquered or were driven out again from the
agricultural lands after a phase of conquest; they developed
institutions after their needs, and these came in to modify and
confuse and complicate the customs, institutions, habits of mind
and points of view that grew up from the ploughed lands. Among the
cattle-tending nomads and in mountain glens one may even imagine a
sort of justification for that "ancient gentilic (tribal or clan)
organisation" which Engels, the fellow-prophet of Marx, declared by
some inner light to be the primitive stage of human society. Only
instead of his amiable Elders, enjoying "the spontaneous informal
regard of Society," there must have been a reality much more after
the vivid pattern of a Highland chief. All these things, we must
remember, were worked out by thousands of communities through
hundreds of generations, over plains, uplands, gorges, valleys,
forests, steppes, and deserts, and the more simple and exact we
make our classifications and explanations the easier they will be
to carry in our minds, and the farther they are likely to be from
the truth. Human society did not develop through an orderly
progression of stages, but by an infinite diversity of temporary
equilibriums and blundering innovations.</p>

<p>All the anthropology I have read seems to me almost without
exception to assume that the man of six or seven thousand years ago
was more lucid and systematic than the man of to-day. But plainly
he must have been very much less so. It is not that he was
intellectually inferior&mdash;there has probably been little if any
growth of the human brain since Palaeolithic times&mdash;but that
he had nothing made ready for him. His language was still a
relatively poor instrument, there were no accumulations of recorded
and established general ideas. Logical reasoning and systematic
thought did not begin until about twenty-five centuries ago; Plato
struggled mystically with the species and the individual, the One
and the Many; and the syllogism is no older than Aristotle. Our
classical scholars never seem to be quite sure whether in the
dialogues of Plato they are dealing with a Cyclopean clumsiness of
argument or philosophical profundities. Before that time men
thought, as children and under-educated people still think, by
imagination. They tried to express things beyond the immediate
daily life by symbols and mythical stories which were promptly
misapprehended and retold in a different sense. And there was
infantile wonder and emotion still flowing undisciplined through
their minds. They could find some numbers beautiful and others flat
or obnoxious. They were as childish as that. They were capable of
immense inconsistencies. Habit and imitation held people's lives
together throughout wide districts and regions in a general
likeness. They attempted, they got, they prevailed, or they
submitted, they toiled or robbed the toil of others, they feared
and hated, killed and triumphed. This was life, they said, for what
else could there be? They bred and passed on the mysterious appeal
of life, they loved their children violently and their grown-up
offspring less, and they died and forgot and were forgotten.</p>

<p>Seven thousand years ago you had, at a generally more simple
level, all the elements of the social problems of to-day;
oppressors and oppressed, luckless wights born to toil and
suffering, lucky ones to veneration and delight, genial, kindly
recipients of good-fortune, patient drudges, people cruelly
misunderstood, souls in wild protest, cunning, wary winners in the
game, perplexed losers, and it was all unsystematic, no one had
planned it. It had grown unawares as a jungle grows, it had drifted
along the stream of time, expanding, multiplying, complicating into
an ever broader and vaster spectacle, out of man's solitary
past.</p>

<p>It seems to me to be enormously important to stress this casual,
complicated, and incoherent quality of man's past. I reiterate it
deliberately. I return to it again. It is a conviction fundamental
to the edifice of my ideas; it is as much a part of me as my eyes.
I do not believe we can deal properly with our current problems
until we are saturated with this realisation. I have watched
political thought with a very close interest all my life, and I
perceive the urgent need to purge from our minds the disposition to
think that at certain phases of human affairs something wicked was
done, that a few men, priests or kings or rich men, plotted against
the rest to deceive and enslave them. Or that at a definite time
something wise was done and a new direction given to affairs. I can
find nothing of that sort in my vision of history. What are called
turning-points in history are significant and not directive. Life
is more muddled and more innocent than we are inclined to think it.
Men accept their lives as they find them, and all human beings are
greedy, something disingenuous, and inapt to sympathise with the
unlike. Some are pressed into the position of devourers and some
find themselves stifled and preyed upon. But change priest and
victim and with scarcely a hitch the sacrifice would go on.</p>

<p>Man's soul and mind in those days were already a palimpsest. It
is only nowadays that psycho-analysis is beginning to work down
through the superimposed layers and to reveal the restrained and
baffled solitary-minded Old Man of the pre-Palaeolithic days,
peeping up through all the obliterations of training, custom, law,
and religion that have been imposed upon him. But there he is at
the bottom of things, the reason why men will combine far more
readily for warfare than peace and for persecution than worship,
why they are so easily "anti" and only by repercussion "pro," why
they must grab beyond their utmost needs, why restraining laws are
necessary, and why we all seek instinctively to ensure our own
private security against the promiscuous motives of the general
herd, that uncertain currish mob-soul of our kind.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec12" name="b2-sec12"></a>§ 12. MONEY</h2>

<p class="first">No other part of history so interests me as the
opening chapter before the documents begin. There is no excessive
presentation of persons and personal names; egoism has left nothing
but defaced monuments and disconnected boasts, and we seem to come
nearer to the realities of human life than we do in many a later
age when kings and princes and their policies monopolise the
foreground.</p>

<p>Certain great enlargements of human life came about in the
period between ten thousand and two thousand years ago. They can.e
about very gradually and it is only nowadays that we begin to
reconstruct the story of their appearance. One of these
enlargements was writing and another was money. Even in the
Palaeolithic age, thirty thousand years ago, men were very near to
writing. They not only made beautiful pictures like those in the
Altamira caves, but they simplified drawings down to conventional
signs and wrote them rapidly and kept tallies. I remember being
shown some tracings of Palaeolithic rock paintings in the Madrid
Museum five years ago. There was a hunting scene, a dance, some men
gathering honey, and what were perhaps hunting tallies done in red
paint. I do not know if these latter have ever been published. They
might be primitive Chinese; the sign for man for example, a swipe
of the brush and two legs, is very similar. Matters remained at
that stage for a long period. Hunting and herding people need
tallies and route pictures but have little other use for writing.
As trading developed the need for record increased. The evolution
of trust and commercial patience must have been a slow affair. Such
things crept into life and became domesticated and familiar by
degrees, age by age. As picture writing passed into syllabic
writing and became more and more capable of rendering the
subtleties of speech, much more extensive possibilities of
communication and of the extension of power opened out. Laws and
claims and pledges could go farther and endure longer. Men could be
documented and "fixed."</p>

<p>With this enlargement our universal disposition to shift toil to
other people and get them working for us discovered a rich mine of
new possibilities. The man with the upper hand was no longer
obliged to beat his slave or peasant to his task and stand over
him. He could check his output. Much fine intelligence went to the
elaboration and enforcement of "bits of writing" by which men were
entangled.</p>

<p>Money, too, came creeping into the elaborating scheme of human
economy. It was not so much invented as discovered to be present.
We are raId, or at least we used to be told, that the first money
was cattle. That seems quite plausible. Cattle must have been
exchanged for women in marriage and for other desirable possessions
very early in the human story. The herdsmen, one can understand,
were among the first traders; the nomads no doubt began
merchandising. I suspect that nomads were among the first metal and
mineral miners, but I do not know how far archaeologists would
countenance me in that. In many parts of the world tinker and
blacksmith and "cheap-jack" are still gypsies. They brought metals
and precious stones along from the mountains and passes and gorges
to the alluvial plains where minerals were rare. Possibly the first
approach to a coin was a metal tally with a cow stamped on it. But
metals were rare in themselves and highly desirable. I have read
somewhere that the Hittites and Spartans had money of iron. It is
only twenty-five or twenty-six centuries ago, it seems, that coined
money came into use in human affairs, and for some centuries it
belonged only to the superficial world of trading operations; it
had little to do with the broader, more fundamental economics of
the community. Most of the food was grown, most of the houses and
temples were made, even possibly most of the ships were launched,
without a resort to money.</p>

<p>It has struck me, as a man coming late to such studies, that our
histories of mankind do not attach sufficient importance to the
gradual but profound alteration of phase, the reorientation that
occurred in human affairs as documentation and money, from their
first sporadic superficiality, crept into and changed the massive
substance of economic life. These two things must have varied and
elaborated the fundamental game of shifting the toil enormously.
They cast the cloak of personal invisibility about owners. And they
fixed obligations with a new relentlessness. As the broad lines of
the money convention were more and more widely understood and
recognised, as its purchasing power extended from a few to more and
more commodities, the novelty of abstract wealth arose. Men found
themselves possessed, not merely of cattle, olive orchards, ships,
slaves, and so forth, but of an amulet which would call all or any
of these things into their service. They could be mortgagers
instead of worried owners, and they need keep no slaves, because
now every penniless man was at their bidding if they so desired it.
Money had generalised slavery. They had no need to insist upon the
status of a slave. They found very soon that it was superfluous
even to have the coined money in a strong-box; they need only have
the documented promise to pay money or an acknowledgment of receipt
from a sufficiently solvent creditor. Parchment money was already
in use among the Carthaginians.</p>

<p>Money has always had about it something indefinite. It varies
and has varied widely in its nature. It was not invented by any
particular person. There never was, to-day there is not, a complete
system of money. That has still to come. Money crept into human
concerns insidiously, century by century. It is a variable,
many-faced thing. It is a token here, and there a piece of metal of
intrinsic value. It will breed like a rabbit where Usury is
permitted. The Catholic Church once sought to sterilise it, but now
she holds her peace and makes no trouble over a pious legacy of
debentures. It breeds, but it is subject to degeneration. It can be
debased and manipulated in all sorts of obscure and furtive ways.
Men can operate upon its moods and fluctuations and snatch profits,
but even the most cunning operators must sometimes guess. In modern
life it has become so intimate and so fundamental that most people
have a kind of horror of thinking too closely about its uncertain
ties. We will not even ask ourselves why it should be sterile in
our pockets and prolific when we hand it to state or bank. We feel
that to speak to a man about his dividends is an immodest act. With
most of us money is protected from ruthless investigation by an
emotional fear analogous to that which veils sex in the minds of
the young. We realise a helplessness.</p>

<p>In the period when Dickon and I faced the world money was fairly
stable. We accepted it as a trustworthy measure of values. Most of
the world was on the gold standard, fluctuations in exchange were
fractional, and there was a slow general fall in prices going on, a
fall that scarcely anyone discussed. But the worldwide stability of
money throughout most of that half-century before the war was an
exceptional phase in its history.</p>

<p>Almost the whole story of mankind from the days of the Roman
Empire onward could be told as a history of the fluctuations and
variations in the behaviour of money and of its sublimated
form&mdash;credit. The older civilisations of the Orient did, no
doubt, use the precious metals abundantly; all Asia Minor and
Greece coined money before Cyrus; the latter days of the Jews were
dark with debts and usuries; there was lending and banking in
Babylon and Carthage; but the cash nexus first sent its
ramifications deeply into the general life of the community in the
triumphant years of the Roman Republic. Did men, common men, pay
taxes normally in money, anywhere at any time before the Roman
days? I doubt it. And with the rephrasing of transactions in terms
of money in that age ownership attained a novel fluidity, interest
could expand to gigantic proportions, men could borrow with an
unprecedented, dangerous readiness, and be ruined and sold up with
amazing rapidity. The punishment of the bankrupt was merciless. The
history of Rome seems to me to be full of the entanglement and
dispossession of small men, of great inflations and explosions of
debt, of popular attempts to repudiate debts and of aristocratic
suppressions of repudiation, of moneyed men becoming for the first
time more powerful than lords and rulers. It is the history of a
series of events of a different type or order from those of any
previous history.</p>

<p>There are historians&mdash;it does not dispose of them to say
they are mostly Germans and so, by nature and necessity,
wrong&mdash;who declare that the Roman collapse before the
barbarians was essentially an economic collapse due to crude
finance. The slave estates which had succeeded the debt-consumed
free cultivator had given way to the serf cultivator, who was born
and lived and died the debtor of his lord. And the serf had no
spirit to resist the invader. For him a barbarian lord was little
different from a Roman lord&mdash; himself perhaps only a very
imperfectly assimilated barbarian in the imperial service. The
outer barbarian had indeed the merit of cutting off the visitations
of the imperial tax collector. Disorder and political
disintegration were welcome then for the common man, since they
meant a disappearance of the taxes and debts and deeds that crushed
and held him down. Illegal exactions and outrages might be
substituted, but these were, by their nature, transitory
things.</p>

<p>This interpretation of the fall of the imperial system seems
very plausible to me. It IS fairly plain that the money and credit
nexus which first pervaded the Roman Empire, and which was ruptured
and left in tattered fragments by its fall, was mended very slowly
and crept back throughout our Western community again in the later
Middle Ages. To-day it is the method of nearly all our economic
intercourse. Except the toil of mothers for their children and the
toil of the wives of poor men, I can think of no large class of
services that are not appraised and paid for in money. Hardly any
were so appraised and paid for in the early civilisations three
thousand years ago. In the old civilisations one was paid for one's
toil by a specific easement or reward; nowadays one is paid by this
abstract token, this coin or note, which is understood to carry
with it a power of command over a certain quantum of whatever
pleasures or possessions we desire. So long as that understanding
holds it will work. In the ancient world services were simply and
personally reciprocal. They are no longer so. Even the traditions
of that reciprocity are lost and I do not believe they can ever be
restored. And this has come about not by any revolutionary
substitution of one organised system for another, but by an
extraordinary growth of contrivances, conventions, tacit,
unreasoned acceptances, establishments of usage. Money is not an
institution that has replaced simpler and less convenient
institutions, it is a tradition that has grown and exfoliated and
crowded older usages out of existence.</p>

<p>It is not a safe device. It can fail to keep faith. It has
failed and recovered in Russia and Germany. Nowhere is it proof
against fresh failures. If men lose confidence in it sufficiently,
our civilisation, which is now entirely based upon it and which has
no reserved alternative to it to fall back upon, will clog and
cease to work. It is at least as indispensable now as housing and
clothing. Modern civilisation is like an aeroplane in mid-air, an
aeroplane with one sole, imperfect engine which is popping and
showing many signs of distress. It may win to an aerodrome and
repairs and replacements. Or it may make a very unpleasant forced
landing presently with little hope of immediate recovery.</p>

<h2><a id="b2-sec13" name="b2-sec13"></a>§ 13. CHANGE OF SCALE</h2>

<p class="first">IN the last three centuries there has been a great
expanSIOn of the scale of economIC processes. This change of scale
is one of the outstanding facts in the general scheme of history.
It has inaugurated a new phase in human experience. It has an
effect as though upon the customary succession of day and night
there were to dawn an unfamiliar illumination from some strange new
star, a light altering all visible values, dispelling accepted
shadows, revealing things hitherto unknown. There seems to be no
simple cause of this change. There may have been an almost entirely
accidental confluence of favourable conditions.</p>

<p>Through stimulations that I will not attempt to classify or
estimate, European business in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries was in a state of vigorous renascence. Shipping was
pushing with an unwonted boldness round the continents and into
unknown seas, there was a great influx of silver from America,
towns were growing rapidly. There were also great intellectual
liberations, the rediscovered Greek literature was releasing the
long- restrained imaginations of men, printing was making reading
easier and cheaper; but how far this mental enlivenment really
affected economic developments it is impossible to calculate.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century carried on the expanding stir; there was
much experimenting and innovating in financial method; there was a
rush of inventions; coal was utilised for metallurgy, and that led
to a bigger scale use of iron and steel; the machinery made
possible by this opened up new possibilities of organised
manufacture, and the facilities of intercourse began an astounding
increase in scope and pace that still goes on.</p>

<p>Most of these things seem to me to have arisen detachedly. The
more one looks into their history, the less connected they appear
to be, and the less ready one is to accept simple explanations. One
is apt to think of the steam-engine, for instance, with its
intricate, tremendous influence upon transport and upon the
development of mass production, as arising out of the scientific
thrust. But did it? Were the inventors and exploiters of
steam&mdash;Watt watching the dancing kettle lid, for
example&mdash;really scientific men ? Were they influenced very
much by the science of their time? Did they owe very much to Bacon
or the Royal Society? And for the matter of that, to take a later
case, was the aeroplane a scientific invention ? Was it not rather
the creation of odd experimenting out-of-the-way people, a little
distrustful of the mathematicians' assumptions about the air?</p>

<p>The proper triumphs of science no one can deny. Indisputably the
whole development of electrical appliances arises out of systematic
scientific research, and so do most medical progress and most
metallurgical and chemical improvements. But it is worth noting
that the experimenting, innovating spirit of the last three
centuries was also active outside the strictly scientific movement,
and that historically the scientific man has rather pursued and
overtaken and studied and organised, first in this and then in that
province of creative knowledge, than directed the opening
inquiries. In the last three hundred years inventions and new ideas
have come faster and thicker like flowers in springtime; the
scientific man has gathered rather than Sown. In the world of
psychology he is only now really getting a grip upon the stuff, and
in the world of social and economic relationship and in relation to
law I am doubtful whether, even at the present time, science has
fairly begun. Yet there have been tremendous changes and
enlargements in these latter fields, changes and enlargements
almost as considerable as those in natural science.</p>

<p>But though I see the expansive forces which distinguish the life
of man in the last two or three centuries as multiple in their
origins and defiant of any comprehensive explanation, it does seem
to me, nevertheless, that one can throw at least two
generalisations over the whole. The first of these is the sustained
widespread appearance of this change of scale in human
possibilities. Suddenly the world has grown relatively much
smaller. Man has acquired new power over matter. He can handle
masses and produce commodities by wholesale methods absolutely
undreamt of before the present time. And, secondly, he has now so
mastered the utilisation of fuel, wind, and water for the
production of power that a large part of the burthen of sheer toil
imposed hitherto since civilisation began upon the unwilling
shoulders of our kind may now be lifted. Human intercourse need no
longer be mainly a toil-shifting tangle. I take it the main
features of the present phase of this property-money give-and-take
which is human society are due to the confused and mainly selfish
efforts of people to adapt themselves to the releases of these new
conditions without any clear understanding of their nature.</p>

<p>This change of scale and all the disturbance and opportunity it
brought with it was going on even in the eighteenth century, but it
was only becoming the completely dominant fact in the world's
economics when my father was growing up. He was already alive in
the early days of railway speculation. I remember he told me when I
was a small boy that he was married in the year the <i>Great
Eastern</i> was launched, which was, I find, 1859. He was showing
me a picture of the monster hung up in a bedroom at Mowbray. She
was a prematurely big ship of eighteen thousand tons. I doubt if
her engines were up to their task, and I believe she was a
financial failure. She was beyond the limit set by circumstances at
that time to the change of scale in shipping.</p>

<p>My grandfather was a not very leading partner of a not very
prominent firm of stockbrokers. So my father grew up, indigenous to
that dark hive, the City, in the days when London was really the
head and centre of the business enterprise of the world. The new
phase of civilisation had first become manifest in England; she was
leading with iron and steel, cotton, wool, railways, steamships,
finance. In those days the English were regarded, not only by
themselves, as a people beyond all other peoples, more energetic,
more practical, cold and high and wise. And Providence had favoured
His new Chosen by putting their coal and iron very close together
and planting them in an island at the geographical centre of the
trading world. It was their mission to develop the rest of this
planet, patronisingly, profitably. France, their most serious
rival, was, they declared, "fickle," Spain sunken in Catholic
decay, Italy a protégée, Russia barbaric, Germany poverty-struck
and impracticable, lost in dreams of music and philosophy; America
from north to south a continent of unstable republics, fields for
enterprise, of no financial importance at all. The chief
manufacture of the United States in those days was supposed to be
wooden nutmegs. English schoolmasters teaching Transatlantic
geography never failed to mention them with a kindly
you-may-laugh-now smile.</p>

<p>In those days all the nations of the world were resorting to the
dark and narrow ways of the City for credit to make railways and
harbours and to reorganise their industries along the new lines. If
any refrained, energetic young Englishmen went to inquire into the
matter and if necessary compel them to come in. The solicitation of
China and Japan was forcible. French enterprise had a narrower
range in the Mediterranean and the Orient, and was always rather
too closely entangled with its Foreign Office. In the Far East the
Englishman sometimes met a stray American, for a mysterious
instinct drove the Americans very early across the Pacific, but in
those days they did not seem to amount to very much there, and
presently their Civil War engaged them. That was supposed to be the
end of all their democratic hopes. North America would "split up"
as South America had done, lacking the golden bond of a crown.
Amusing it is to recall that in the political cartoons of those
days John Bull figured as a wise old giant and Jonathan as his
untidy, ill-behaved nephew. Neither American nor German enterprise
had ruffled the hustling, muddling self-confidence of London in the
days of my father's youth.</p>

<p>The industrial and mining developments of the later eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries were largely proprietary. Landowners
prospected for minerals under their own lands; cotton-spinners
bought machinery and reduced their cousins and neighbours to
economic servitude, and presently resorted to the foundling
hospitals and workhouses to increase their supply of tractable
cheap workers. There were companies, but they were mainly just
multiple proprietors. With the coming of railways and steamships
and power machinery, however, the change of scale passed further
and further beyond the dimensions of ordinary individual fortunes.
Before a man could set about trying to handle this or that still
incompletely developed economic activity in the big way he found he
had to associate himself with some one who would bring in the large
amount of credit needed for the attempt. He had to go to the
City.</p>

<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century two contrasted types of
exploiter were trying to draw wealth, ease, and power out of the
new forces of enlargement; one the reorganiser of employment upon
new lines, and the other the operator with credit. The method of
the latter was to saddle the new production or the new service with
as heavy payments as it could stand&mdash;or at any rate to operate
and get away with a profit before the limits of payment were
apparent. The former was a cheap producer and seller who sought new
customers; the latter was a collector of savings which he led
towards investment in the. new enterprises, and deflected more or
less on the way thither. The organiser encroached upon and
destroyed the freedom of the small man; the financier enmeshed the
organiser. That stately process continues. To nowhere in
particular. The smaller people, superseded by the new machine- and
power-using enterprise, had to take care of themselves as well as
they could. Most of them the new developments took by surprise and
they were impoverished or pauperised before they realised clearly
what was happening. After the immemorial practice of mankind, the
new labour needed was obtained as cheaply as possible and left to
get as much above a bare subsistence from the social economics
effected as it could.</p>

<p>Among the early victims of the new drives towards larger scale
business were the small cultivators whose way of living was knocked
to pieces by the Enclosures Acts, and the weavers and spinners and
other workers who were crushed or devoured by the factories. The
railways put an intricate and picturesque high-road life out of
action, ruined coach-owners, horse-owners and horse-breeders,
wayside inns. On the whole the new methods were increasing
production very greatly, but they were requiring a smaller
proportion of skilled and capable workers among the people they
employed, and so the larger share of the increased output went to
support a great expansion of population, a proliferation of
low-grade human beings. Everywhere arose great new towns, vast
sprawls of mean streets and slums, in which the bulk of this
additional unspecialised and unselected population sheltered.</p>

<p>It is one of the dearest assumptions of the Marxist theorists
that there has been a concentration of wealth in the hands of a
vigorously acquisitive and steadily concentrating minority
throughout the last two centuries. It is amazing how many of us,
with eyes in our heads, with museums, ancestral mansions, and
collections of old furniture to refer to, with pictures and books
at hand, novels, plays, collections of letters, poems with
dedications, have come to accept that concentration as a fact. But
relatively to the common lot the life of the rich and noble in the
seventeenth century was manifestly finer and ampler than it is
to-day. They had far more space and beauty, more respect, more
servile human service. Music of the finest quality, delightful art,
every sort of decoration&mdash;such printing and bookbinding, for
example, as we cannot rival today&mdash;mental freedom, existed for
them alone. It is preposterous to say that the rich have become
richer and the poor poorer in this last phase of history. The
increase in production has gone along quite another channel. It has
neither been monopolised by the property-owner nor distributed
throughout the general mass. It has merely expanded the general
mass. It has been absorbed by blind breeding. Since my father was
born, in that little space of time, the population of England has
doubled. So has the population of Germany. By internal increase and
in spite of considerable emigration. Since 1850 the population of
the world must have increased by many hundreds of millions. No one
is much better off nor worse off as yet for the change of scale;
there are only more people.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b2-sec14" name="b2-sec14"></a>§ 14. THE CITY AND MY
FATHER</h2>

<p class="first">SHORT-SIGHTED rearrangements of production under a
conspiracy of helpful circumstances, and then blind borrowing and
purblind lendIng, reckless breeding; evasion of toil and
responsibilities above; congested, reluctant, protesting labour
below; and nowhere any clear vision of the whole&mdash;that was the
substance of the nineteenth-century spectacle, and it followed
logically and necessarily in the vein of all preceding social life.
Knowledge had so grown by the middle of the nineteenth century that
there might have been enough for all and unprecedented freedom for
all. But this possibility concerned nobody in particular. The
practical fact which concerned everyone was that there was not
nearly enough for most people because of the primitiveness and
incoherence of proprietary and monetary methods.</p>

<p>Quite the strongest and most remarkable of the impressions of
financial men my own dealings with finance have left me is their
superficiality and inattention. Men follow science and art, pursue
agriculture, organise manufactures, or go upon the seas to trade,
<i>closely</i>, because these things are profoundly and
sustainingly interesting. But no one is in business in the City for
the sake of business in the City. Men go there to come out of it
again, successful. There is no instinct for arithmetic, no lust for
computation, in the make-up of a normal human being; I doubt even
if those abnormalities they call calculating boys get any pleasure
from their gift until it is applied; the only living interests in
the City are acquisition and the excitements of risk and conflict
that might be pursued as easily at Monte Carlo. The activities of
the City and its younger, perhaps stronger, offspring in Wall
Street&mdash;for who knows now which is leading which?&mdash;affect
the intimate lives of all mankind, but this is not present in the
consciousness of the City. It is the peculiar quality of money and
credit to abstract reality from transactions and remove it to an
immense distance. Finance is forgetful of the world in its
processes, and the world thinks as little as possible about the
finance that thrusts it along and pushes it about. Hardly anyone in
the City is going an inch further than he is obliged to do beneath
the surfaces on which he moves his pieces. The City has grown up
from forgotten beginnings; City men accept it as it is and follow
its rules and traditions. They no more want an inquiry into what
lies beneath it than cricketers want people to geologise beneath
their pitch.</p>

<p>In the course of my life I have met a certain sprinkling of
bankers, and I do not think there is any sort of human being more
marvellous and incredible. They take money for granted as a terrier
takes rats; when they see it they go for it; but they are
absolutely immune to any philosophical curiosity about it. From no
other profession do men fly so rapidly to the distraction of other
occupations; bankers become collectors, naturalists, historians,
critical writers; the profession is a hotbed of amateurs. The world
of banking and finance draws princely incomes from processes it
does not understand clearly and that, with a strong self-protective
instinct, it will, if it can, prevent anyone from understanding
clearly. I can imagine no more preposterous caricature of reality
than the representation of the City and Wall Street and the bourses
and exchanges of the planet generally as a sort of synthetic,
wicked, watchful, many-headed spider, scientifically sucking the
life-blood from the world. The spider sucks blood because it wants
to do it, but banking does it merely because it does it.</p>

<p>No doubt the activities of the City tangle the whole world, but
they do so aimlessly. The men who rush about its narrow ways do not
know what they are up to. They would be very angry to be told as
much, but so it is. They impress themselves and each other and
their clerks and their typists and the anxious, greedy, investing
public as strong men and bold men and decisive men and little
Napoleons; some of them are controlling altogether colossal sums;
but in their heads are brains that still remain&mdash;it is
offensive but it must be said&mdash;inadequately developed. They
are youngsters who have never taken time to grow up, youngsters
over-blown. They have never struggled on to the fully adult stage.
They are ignorant of fundamentals, they do not see themselves
plainly, they are individualistic in their aims, the sense of being
a possible part in one complete social organisation has not come to
them, and all these characteristics are the characteristics of
immaturity. Their great enterprises, their debts, their loans,
their technicalities and methods are solemn vast puerilities; it
does not make them any the less puerilities that all mankind
suffers because of them.</p>

<p>That congested City is still the chief credit whirlpool of the
world confusion, and thither the money goes and there it must be
sought again. About its ways went our father in his time, in a
becoming black top-hat and an impressive frock-coat after the
fashion of the period, red-whiskered and comely and engaging in his
manners, bold and enterprising to his own undoing. And thither came
Dickon and I later on, sniffing after the credit and the money
which are the keys of personal liberty and without which there is
neither food nor freedom nor power in the world.</p>

<p>I will not disinter my father's story here. Indeed, many
essential phases of it are now so covered up and hidden and
untraceable that I do not think I could, even if I wanted to do so.
He seems to have worked with his father's firm for a time and to
have been at first an alert but quite wary speculator. There were
many people in the City who liked him and who kept their faith in
his ability and recuperative power right up to the wild
preliminaries of the final disaster. He did very little with
railways; railways had been built, had been over-capitalised, had
failed to pay, and had been made to pay&mdash;by excursion trains
and an educational campaign&mdash;before his time. The railways
were settling down after a wild youth. But the new possibilities of
large-scale retail trade the railways had created were still in
process of active exploitation. It was an open question then
whether the greater changes would follow the lines indicated by the
increased ease with which customers could be brought to centres, or
those denned by the increased facilities of distribution. Bright,
pushful men were looking for presentable aspects of both these
possibilities with which to woo the City and, in co-operation with
the City, the investor at large. My father was early in this field,
and he seems to have done very well along both lines.</p>

<p>He looked for easily transported goods and hit upon tea; he
brought together some tea wholesalers, some lead-packet people, and
a small retailer in Clapham named Partington, whose shop it was
possible to claim was "Established in 1810," and out of these
ingredients he created "Partington's Pure Packet Teas; Partington's
Own Delicious Blend." At first there was to have been a postal
order business, but, instead, the packets were found to be
particularly marketable on the counters of small retailers. People
with sweetstuff shops and confectioners and so on, who had never
weighed out tea, could sell packet tea. Simultaneously he revealed
to Nickleby's, the drapers of Camden Town, that they were the North
London Central Bazaar, "the shopping and social centre of North
London Life," and got them into a phase of hectic enlargement. He
worked with sustained energy and very closely in those early years;
there was reality and substance in both these concerns, and it was
rather through the pressure of natural business development than
any nefarious intention that by the time he had altogether disposed
of these organisations he had sold them for about ten times their
actual value as going concerns. Partington's, with a group of other
firms of very unequal value, presently became the London United Tea
Company, and then launched boldly into World Tea Plantations;
Nickleby's also expanded into London and Empire Stores, with shops
at Brighton and Manchester and a place in Durban, and another, a
shocking failure, in Bombay. The belief of the investing public,
and particularly of the small investor in associated shop
constellations, was growing steadily all these years, and my father
took his own where he found it.</p>

<p>In those days my father was by the best City standards a sound
man. He was watching what he was doing quite carefully. His
reputation for soundness was greatly enhanced by the Red Gulch and
Throttle Lode affair. Either he got a tip in some way, or he made a
happy fluke with a large parcel of copper-mine shares and was out
and away with his profits before anyone had noticed what had
happened. It seemed a desperate fling to many City sages.</p>

<p>But after that raid he never went near that market again; they
never had a chance to get back on him. This resolution as it became
more evident turned people's momentary doubts into an accession of
confidence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was the beginning of his undoing; his natural
belief in his instinct and his luck was stimulated; he became
greedy and hasty, he spread himself out over ground he had never
explored with any care, he took liberties with his associates and
lied where before he had simply exaggerated. He went out for the
promotion of seaside resorts, for big housing schemes and
especially for service flats in huge architectural piles, for
gas-lighting&mdash;more particularly in South European
countries&mdash;and, arising out of that, for soft coal. I do not
even know the succession in time, much less the inter-relations, of
Cornwall Court Limited, the London Buildings Company, Seabreeze
Estates, the Gas and Metallurgical Coal Group and Mediterranean Gas
and South Coast Development; I know only that the mounting pile
culminated in London and Imperial Enterprises and crashed. But I
know enough of my father through my own nature to know that what
was the matter :with him was boredom, the frightful boredom of City
life, the boredom of enterprises getting more and more remote from
any living and breathing reality, the boredom of arithmetic in
little offices, of bluffs and misleading statements in board-rooms,
of deposit-books and cheque-books that one had to remember didn't
mean what they appeared to mean, and of remembering what So-and-So
didn't know and what Such-and-Such did. Stuff like that in the
brain must be like dry chaff in the mouth on a hot day. The City is
a trap for human energy: it promises life more abundantly and
wastes it ruthlessly. It is like the bottle of nuts with the
monkey; he can get his hand in and he can get his hand full, but to
get his hand out is another matter. And until he can get his hand
out the nuts are uncracked nuts.</p>

<p>My father must have felt that beneath the florid appearance of
success his life was passing away. I realise only too vividly his
desperate determination to clutch some concrete happiness, some
vivid splendour, high place or power, out of that mocking hurry of
dingy and doubtful transactions, before age or death overtook him.
Our removal to Mowbray was the first early symptom of his possible
impatience for realisations and expenditure. Afterwards, nearer the
end, there was some gaudy pleasuring; I have heard since of
brilliant but costly ladies assisting him to taste "life," and
there was a great time in a hired villa at Monte Carlo, of which
except for a few postcards no intimations ever reached Mowbray; and
a theatrical venture with a now forgotten actress, Lillie Morton,
whose private may have been greater than her public charm. I hope
it was, for my father's sake. Before he had reached my present age
the whole feverish story was over.</p>

<p>And so he passed, and so, with less acutely tragic incident, a
great multitude of brave and eager lads have passed through the
City, growing old as they passed but not really growing up, a swirl
and a superficial consequence upon a deep flood of changes beyond
their understanding.</p>

<h2><a id="b3-1" name="b3-1"></a>§ 1. DICKON FINDS HIS PURPOSE IN
LIFE</h2>

<p class="first">MY brother Dickon was physically very like my
father, but he had a sturdier quality of mind. His imagination was
as bold, but his self-restraint was steadier. Both of us indeed
were honest to a greater degree; our consciences were livelier and
more watchful, the sense of an obligation incurred gripped us more
firmly and did not so readily slip its hold. Some ancestor of
marked integrity must have been latent in my father. We were both
mainly Clissold, but physically Dickon was nearer to my father than
I. He was a better-looking youngster. He had my father's reddish
hair and something of his physical swagger, while I mingled threads
of my mother's darkness with streaks of paternal gold.</p>

<p>Dickon, I have told, professed individualism, but he has always
been a very sociable individualist; I was an unsocial Socialist
from the outset, with a greater disposition to go alone or with one
companion. Clara once said that Dickon was canine and I was feline,
and I think that expresses something very elemental between us.
Dickon's pink skin freckles at a mere glimpse of the sun, and he
has carried my father's sanguine amplitude of limb and body to a
considerable massiveness. He is now, in fact, a very fine figure of
a man indeed, a stout tweed-wearing man, "Nordic," they would say
in America.</p>

<p>In the preceding Book I brought the account of Dickon and myself
up to the later eighties, when we were studying science very
unevenly at the Kensington schools, and considering our attack upon
the world. Then I went off on the trail of Marx and the economic
history of the world. I left Dickon at loose ends.</p>

<p>He did not long remain at loose ends. It was at night in a show
called the Inventions Exhibition, while we were sitting watching a
crowd of promenaders and listening to a band, beneath festoons of
fairy-lights&mdash;little oil lamps they were&mdash;and in front of
a grass plot on which yet other fairylights, blue, red, and orange,
made a flickering guttering enchantment, that Dickon's ends ceased
to be loose and he unfolded to me his plan of campaign. It was to
be his life's plan of campaign, but I believe that it had
crystallised out in his mind only that afternoon.</p>

<p>That Inventions Exhibition was one of a series of annual shows;
there was one called the Healtheries and another the Fisheries, and
others, in what was then a great area of waste land in South
Kensington. Now most of that land is .filled up by the Imperial
Institute and by Museum galleries and buildings belonging to London
University, but in those days these exhibitions were able to spread
from the Exhibition Road to the Albert Hall, the upper galleries of
which building were somehow included in the spectacle. These
grounds were put in order and laid out with beds of geraniums and
calceolarias; they were illuminated in the evenings, and the
Exhibition was favoured by a succession of fine summer nights.</p>

<p>It would be interesting now to disinter the plans and
guide-books, if any copies survive, to that Inventions Exhibition.
It was before the coming of the safety bicycle or the automobile;
the gas-lamp still held its own quite hopefully against the
dangerous uncertainties of the electric light, and gramophones,
cinemas, wireless had hardly germinated in the womb of time. The
germs existed, but nothing had come to exhibition pitch. I remember
some very attractive omnibuses, driven by compressed air, wallowing
to and fro in a confined space. They were the only anticipation of
automobiles in the show, and I remember, too, how Dickon that
afternoon doubted whether electric traction could ever be anything
more than a scientific toy. It might be done, he said, but it could
never be done to pay.</p>

<p>Yet what we had seen had stimulated our imaginations
considerably, and while we listened to the band in the evening
after a frugal supper, we were both much more prepared to expect
great changes during our lifetimes than we had been when we pushed
through the turnstiles in the early afternoon. Our talk had ebbed
for a time and we were smoking unaccustomed cigarettes which Dickon
had made with a machine for the occasion.</p>

<p>"It is no good inventing things if you do not get people to make
use of them," said Dickon, coming up to the surface, so to speak,
after a profound meditation.</p>

<p>"No," said I, not in the least aware of his drift. "There's no
money in anything until people have been told of it."</p>

<p>"The money?"</p>

<p>"No," contemptuously, "the anything."</p>

<p>I perceived that he was taking up his standing problem of "how
to get it" again. "I suppose new things have to be sold," I
said.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And you have to make people <i>want</i> them." A
pause.</p>

<p>"Advertisement" said Dickon. "Advertisement is only, beginning.
Billy!&mdash;I see it. That's where my money is.</p>

<p>Advertising."</p>

<p>The distant band was playing a waltz tune just then for I
remember the rhythm of it. (Tra-la-la la pum pum, pum pum.
Tra-la-la la pum pum, pum pum. Tra-la-la la pum, pum, pum pum.
Tra-la-la la pum pum, pum pum, it went. (Am I filling in detail
from my imagination or was it the Blue Danube waltz?) And the
promenaders passed, keeping step to it; mysterious, romantic
promenaders, for the fairy-lights were not enough to show their
faces plainly.</p>

<p>With something of the manner of an explorer, the voice at my
side began to talk of the dark and dismal advertisement of that
time and to point out its defects and its possibilities. I
understood now why he had been so silent and preoccupied throughout
the afternoon. He had been reading all the advertisements in sight
and thinking about them. He had been struck by their limitation of
range; their crudity and formality; their inapplicability to the
sale of new devices. A realisation of unworked opportunities close
at hand had struck him dumb at first, and was now moving him to
speech. He began to talk of advertisement, and to the best of my
recollection he talked of advertisement for the next year or
so.</p>

<p>That evening I had a lecture on the things advertisers did and
the things they failed to do. It was delivered with the dogmatism
proper to an elder brother, and with a note of reprehension as
though I had in some way participated in the negligencies of the
commercial world. I said little, and what I said was brushed aside
or crushed. I did what I could to find excuses for backward and
unskilful advertisers and was soundly scolded for their sins.</p>

<p>I recall the feeling rather than the substance of his
outpourings. I remember that after a time we got up from our seats
and walked about the grounds, and Dickon was still weighing pros
and cons; we went into the more or less deserted exhibition
galleries, and he held me remorselessly before silent exhibits and
denounced the futility of their appeals. He was still at it as we
made our way at the close of the exhibition, with other
<i>jusqu'au-bout-ists</i>, along a tiled subway that echoed to our
feet and led to the Metropolitan station.</p>

<p>"Look at that thing!" he would cry. Look at that <i>silly</i>
thing! What's the good of sticking that here?"</p>

<p>I recall distinctly my agonised protest. "Damn it! <i>I</i>
didn't put it there!"</p>

<p>It restrained him not at all.</p>

<p>In the small hours he was sitting up in bed. "Advertisement,
Billy," he said. "Advertisement! And the School of Mines may go and
blast and burn and fuse and run itself to Jericho. The Voice has
reached me, Billy! Come over and help us! The Hoardings call to me,
the Magazines are moaning, and I come. I come."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>shut</i> up, Dickon! Good-night!" I said, pulling the
bed-clothes over my ears.</p>

<p>He dropped his work at the School of Mines almost immediately;
he made no pretence of finishing off his term, and for some weeks
he divided his waking time almost equally between an intensive
study of advertising methods and brooding in Kensington Gardens
upon his course of action. His first definite step was to go, after
a very careful and elaborate preliminary exploration of the special
field in question, to an advertising watchmaker in Cornhill, to get
an interview with him, and tell him why his watches were not
selling nearly so well as they might do in the West-end, in various
suburbs, among the City clerks, in the East-end, and what he
thought might be done to stimulate their sale. He had brought notes
and sketches of almost all the advertisements the firm was using,
and very politely and clearly he pointed out how stereotyped was
their appeal and how mechanical their distribution. He convinced
his hearer of advertisements going to waste and reaching nobody
here, and of areas neglected there, and in the end he was allowed
to make a scheme for a more scientific campaign. Hitherto the work
had been done in an almost routine fashion from the office. His
scheme was accepted. It succeeded, and his path in life was open
before him.</p>

<h2><a id="b3-2" name="b3-2"></a>§ 2. MILTON'S SILVER GUINEA</h2>

<p class="first">I DO not know whether it was luck or some
mysterious flair that made Dickon pitch upon Milton for his first
attempt, but I doubt if he could possibly have chosen better.
Milton liked him from the outset; and with Milton, Dickon at the
ripe age of one-and-twenty fixed up his first contract and began
pushing Milton's Silver Guinea by the score, by the hundred, by the
thousand, into the waistcoat pockets of the middle-class. Faster
than Milton could assemble his watches Dickon assembled his
customers. That was only a little while before the mass production
of watches was fully under way. Milton's watches, I fancy, came in
whole or in part from Switzerland. And when presently the Waltham
watches came, ticking very loudly from across the Atlantic, Dickon
made a brave and successful fight for Milton for some years, with
"Milton's Silent Silver Guinea; each personally tested, numbered,
and individually guaranteed."</p>

<p>In the end Milton left the field of popular sales and became a
professor of quality. Milton's Limited now sell "watches that are
beautiful and intimate," but Dickon still steers the bulk of the
output along the path of assertive veracity to the grateful
customer. Only last summer I discovered him in his smoking-room at
Dorking meditating profoundly over Milton's current advertisement
in <i>Punch</i> a most gentlemanly affair.</p>

<p>"Do you remember Milton's in the old days, Billy?" he said,
handing it to me.</p>

<p>"Rather."</p>

<p>"Changed since then. The money I've brought these people! Used
to be cheap stuff."</p>

<p>I considered the page of <i>Punch</i>. I know of no other
periodical whose advertisements so exactly catch the tone of the
morning-room of a good West-end club.</p>

<p>"There are times," he reflected, "when I almost think of buying
a Milton Beautiful and intimate .... They seem to be first-rate
watches."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-3" name="b3-3"></a>§ 3. FORTY YEARS OF
ADVERTISEMENT</h2>

<p class="first">MILTON'S was only Dickon's point of departure. A
great light had come to him, and for a time he saw life wholly as a
field of action in which he was to create appetites in people for
commodities they had never in the least desired hitherto, or to
direct their attention to the great superiority of common
necessities when they are labelled distinctly with a proprietor's
name.</p>

<p>Immense wealth lay in convincing people that an article could
hardly be considered to exist unless it was vouched for by a
respectable firm. In the days of our youth an enormous number of
things were sold anonymously that are now sold under the brands of
makers and packers. Our father had been one of the pioneers in this
christening of goods with his Partington's Packet Teas. When I was
a child every grocer had his own sorts of tea, his tea-chests with
different qualities, and he weighed the tea out and packed it up
for each customer. I can remember seeing that done. Almost
everything he sold them&mdash;bacon, butter, lard, pickles, jams,
biscuits&mdash;he sold from stocks of his own buying on his own
individual reputation. He had pickled onions and cabbage in a great
tub, as they still have them here in France. He used to display
sugar-loaves in his window and chop them up in his shop; I would
gaze fascinated at the sugar chopping in the Duxford grocer's. And
the oilman sold his own lamp oil, and no one asked :where he got
it. Mustard used to be bought for Mowbray at the chemist's.</p>

<p>But even in our childhood there was already a number of vigorous
firms reaching their hands over the retail tradesman's shoulder, so
to speak, and offering their goods in their own name to the
customer. As an infant I used to love a particularly fascinating
Oriental who infested the back pages of magazines, pouring stuff
into the mouth of a forked fish in the interests of Nabob Pickles.
He seems to have vanished utterly. Colman's Mustard insisted
already upon being the only English mustard. It just stuck up its
name in bright letters&mdash;everywhere. I do not know if it ever
became the only mustard, or if there are other mustards now. There
was also a "Keen's Mustard." Is "Keen's" still with us? "English"
mustard that is&mdash; there are all sorts of other mixings here in
France. But I saw yesterday in the window of an <i>épicier</i> in
Grasse neat little tins of Colman's, with the same vivid yellow
ground and the lettering I remember spelling out from a train
window in my childhood. If it is not the only English mustard
everywhere, it is certainly that here.</p>

<p>Then there was soap. The great firm of Pears in those days had
already thrust an individuality upon soap. <i>Pears' Soap</i> marks
an epoch; I hope history will not neglect it. It was advertised
with an unprecedented swagger; there were magazine and newspaper
articles about how the firm did it; Pears bought Academy pictures
by R.A.'s to reproduce in a sort of facsimile, gilt frame and all,
and were among the first of all advertisers to be funny and laugh
at themselves. Harry Furniss did a picture in <i>Punch</i> of a
dirty tramp writing a soap testimonial: "Two years ago I tried
Pears' Soap; since when I have used no other." They secured it and
made a great thing of it.</p>

<p>These and a hundred other siren voices had called to me from
wall and hoarding and printed page from my childhood up, but it was
only now that Dickon was talking about them that I gave them more
than a casual attention. I had never yet stirred up a restaurant by
demanding Nabob Pickles and rejecting all inferior imitations, nor
refused mustard until I was reassured by a sight of the Colman tin;
but now I began, if not to clamour, at least to watch and
discriminate under Dickon's critical guidance. He was grappling
with a multitude of curious problems, and he insisted upon
discussing them with me to the exclusion of every other
subject.</p>

<p>"You see, Billy, you help me. The things you say&mdash;not much
in themselves but they give me ideas."</p>

<p>Queer amusing problems some of them were. Cocoa had come into
English life, and a number of firms were struggling to monopolise
the market, among them Van Bouten, probably a Dutch firm, and Epps
and Cadbury. Dickon was making a careful comparison of their
different methods. "<i>Epps' Cocoa, Grateful and Comforting</i>,"
Dickon would repeat. "Wonderful words. Wonderful! Genius in
them.... Billy, do you think <i>any</i> of these cocoas are the
least bit different from the others?"</p>

<p>So earnest were our researches that we tried them to see. We
sipped our cocoa and regarded each other with grave, inquiring
faces.</p>

<p>These were purely English firms, I suspect. The battle of the
cocoas, if it was fought in America at all, was probably fought
under other names. I doubt if any commodity straddled the Atlantic
in those days.</p>

<p>I remember him sitting on the hard, wooden seat of a compartment
in the dingy, dirty, sulphurous Underground Railway of those
primitive times, with three or four magazines on the seat beside
him, discoursing of the advertisements of a medicine called, if I
remember rightly, "Owbridge's Lung Tonic." Always those
advertisements were encircled by a monstrous O. "Now, why that O?"
he demanded. "It individualises. It is also probably on the bottle.
If there is any other lung tonic going, it serves to make the other
fellow seem an undistinguished nobody. But does it make people want
to take the stuff much? Does it do anything to catch the eye of
consumptive people? Think of anyone with lung trouble and a cough.
Suppose he had this advertisement on one side, and on the other
side one that said quite quietly, 'Clissold's Lung Tonic soothes
and gives peace. And in that peace you heal,' which would you want
to try? Think of those words, Billy, not too big and noisy but put
where they seem to catch the eye almost by accident! Just whisper
it. '<i>And in that peace you heal</i>.'"</p>

<p>In that period there was a great c1amour of pills and
proprietary medicines generally; I think they were far more
vigorously pushed then than they are now. Hardly anything in
domestic medicine that was not being dragged out of its anonymous
phase in the prevalent research for big business in small things.
It is natural that many people should experience a certain internal
dullness on occasion, and require artificial animation. In the
pre-Victorian days this was almost always supplied by homely
remedies; castor oil which chastened and sweetened the soul,
rhubarb pills and anti-bilious pills, Epsom salts, and, for the
defenceless young, flowers of sulphur. One took these things and
corrected oneself as a cat eats grass. But no philanthropist ever
filled columns with the praises of these more immediate gifts from
God. So they were thrust aside by Beecham's Pills, Worth a Guinea a
Box (marvellous words, oh! marvellous words!), Eno's Fruit Salts,
and a crowd of other highly named and vividly packed proprietary
mixtures.</p>

<p>The age of the secret remedy, says Dickon, is drawing to an end.
Advertisements of medicine decline. Not that people are giving up
their resort to a tabloid or a cupful of something out of a bottle
directly they feel out of condition, but they are more and more
disposed to take known and specified drugs and preparations. This
does not mean a return to the little chemist's scales and
measures&mdash;in Britain the little chemist has been almost
syndicated out of existence&mdash;but a development of the
great-scale marketing of tabloids and capsules, made up to this or
that prescription, by firms of manufacturing druggists. Dickon has
been pressing manufacturing chemists to bolder and bolder
advertisement for some time. He wants them to market attractive
little medicine cases for dressing-bags. The ordinary citizen will
then have his physic at hand, like a case of golf-clubs, to meet
all occasions. He will play upon himself as a conductor plays upon
his orchestra, summoning the drums, soothing the brass. Far more
entertaining this will be than the tin-whistle solo of the old
panacea. There will certainly be great changes of fashion in the
contents of these cases, and the objective of the advertiser of the
old-fashioned proprietary medicine will be more and more to get and
keep a footing in the case; to ensure his position as a
contributory instrumentalist, so to speak, in the internal symphony
of the citizen. He will become like the advertiser of automobile
accessories instead of a principal dealer.</p>

<p>To compare one of the great American magazines, or even a
modernised London weekly, with its equivalent of forty years ago,
is an amazing revelation not only of the increased equipment of
life nowadays, but of the continuous extension of strongly
organised big businesses into what were then the trades and
occupations of a great multitude of independent individuals. When I
was young, England was far in front of America in the process, but
American advertising has long since overtaken and outstripped
anything we do on this side. France still follows us&mdash;now
rather rapidly. Many of these big organisations seemed and still
seem to be aiming at monopoly, but their sustained advertisement is
the proof of their sustained sense of insecurity. Some have failed
to achieve their object. Nobody has yet succeeded, for example, in
replacing the small baker, though there have been various well-
supported attempts; and cheese remains, like art, above all
standardisation.</p>

<p>I suppose that, as far as provisions go, it helped greatly in
the concentration of the distribution trade into big stores in
England that so much of the food of the country was imported. The
shipping of it necessarily accumulated it into bulk, and made bulky
handling easy. And the fact that America and other new countries
were exporting so much of their food production developed a
collection at centres there, and so made concentration easy for
them also.</p>

<p>It was after some rather unfruitful work for an advertising
shoemaker that Dickon began to interest himself in the bicycle.
Big-scale selling of boots and shoes, he said, would come a little
later, when machine manufacturing was better developed, but the
bicycle would not wait. The bicycle was here and now. So he jumped
on to the bicycle and travelled some way on it. The more he
inquired into this then fashionable toy, the more convinced he
became of its future as a normal means of transport. First it would
develop as a holiday amusement, and then it would cheapen down to
the daily worker's needs. He attended early shows and races and
himself rode with some fury. He was an early believer in the
diamond frame which has long since ousted all others. He was in
bicycle advertising from the first, and he started one of the
earliest bicycling weeklies, the <i>Flying Wheel</i>, which he
afterwards sold and which still survives in an incorporated state.
He made great efforts to organise the advertisement of wayside inns
in cyclists' magazines. For a time he was very keen indeed upon
what he called consumers' magazines. The ordinary citizen, however,
refuses to accept the specialisation implied in a specialised
magazine. In the case of bicycles, motor-bicycles, and automobiles,
in the world of pet-fanciers and photography, such publications
have worked fairly well, but they have never yet superseded
advertising to the general consumer.</p>

<p>Quite early in his novitiate as an advertiser, I remember Dickon
pointing out to me the interesting conflict between the
advertisements in what he called Trade Papers and advertising to
consumers. By Trade Papers he did not mean the Trade Papers of such
great industries as iron and steel, but the Trade Papers of the
smaller distributor. These latter appeal to the retailer,
shop-keeper or hotel-keeper or whatever he may be, and the goods
advertised are often just those plausible imitations against which
the big advertiser is warning his public. Often these less
well-known goods are the output of minor packers and manufacturers
selling on too small a scale for a public advertisement campaign,
but supplying a quite sound and honest article. These typical Trade
Paper advertisers want to sell their stuff to the man behind the
counter and not to the public; they are on his side against his big
enemies, and they expect him to pit his personal recommendation
against the pervading public advertisement. The retailers' Trade
Paper was in fact, according to Dickon, not advertisement, properly
speaking, at all, but anti- advertisement.</p>

<p>But for Dickon, I suppose, I should never have seen an inch
below the superficial appearances of countryside commerce. But
because of the education he has given me, I recognise still in
every wayside advertisement, in every article in every shop, in the
steep streets of Grasse here, and upon the highway through
Magagnosc to Nice, in the patches of cultivation about me, and the
inscriptions upon my wine bottle and mustard jar, the flying
fragments, the living details of the great battle between small and
big, between the standardising organisation and the huckstering
individual, which is still a dominating aspect of human life
to-day.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-4" name="b3-4"></a>§ 4. MEDIA</h2>

<p class="first">ONE of Dickon's main discussions in those early
days concerned what he called "media." A medium for him was
anything you stuck your advertisement upon&mdash;a wall, a
hoarding, a railway station, a landscape, a public conveyance, a
book, a newspaper or other periodical. Or it might be an Exhibition
or a Market Show. And then there was the house display, the
shop-window, the imposing premises, the van. He invented for these
primitive explorations of what has since become, in America at
least, the great science of advertising, two beautiful terms, the
<i>advertisand</i>, which was what you wanted to sell, and the
<i>advertisee</i>, who was the person you wanted to sell it to. A
good advertisement had to reach as many advertisees as possible as
inexpensively as possible; it had not only to reach them but it had
to create a buying desire for the advertisand; it had not simply to
do that, but it had to make the route to the purchase clear and
plain. These were his criteria in his judgments on the
advertisements we saw about us, and by this standard he judged his
"media."</p>

<p>He would weigh them against each other with extreme gravity.
Walls or hoardings lasted longer than any daily or weekly
periodical, and he went to great pains to estimate the life of a
poster; he would even waylay and talk to billstickers. Enamelled
metal was already in use; sheets of that, he reflected, talked for
years. But they were difficult to place, and if there was any need
for a change of appeal they were hard to recall. Also, they tired
people by repetition.</p>

<p>"Imagine passing the same plaque every week-day for a year!
There's season-ticket holders have to. Horrible, Billy!"</p>

<p>He was far in advance of the times in perceiving that an
advertisement should not bore; the advertisers of those days sought
strenuously to bore. He held also that landscape should be
respected; he believed that it was very easy to arouse an
antagonism to a commodity by rude and blatant methods. He
considered the advertisements he saw in stations and vehicles
abominably ill-done. They shouted where there was no need to shout.
In those days railway advertisements were almost conscientiously
ugly, and they vied with each other in the size of their letters.
"No need for such an uproar, Billy&mdash;no need for it. You've got
your people there&mdash;they're standing about and their minds are
unoccupied. They're quiet and at your disposal. Ready to take an
interest. Why bawl at them?"</p>

<p>He was the first to offer the public anything of length and
interest to read upon a railway platform.</p>

<p>Yet he could be compact with the best of them when the medium
required it. It was he who thought of advertisements on the risers
of the staircases going up and down to rail way stations, spaces
hitherto neglected and mute. How. well I remember the excitement of
that novel idea, the weighing of considerations, the problem of who
to take it to, the feverish hope of great developments. "It must be
witty," said Dickon. "Short and witty. I won't have them just
yapped at." To whom should he take it? For a time he hovered
between a flea-powder and a chewing-gum.</p>

<p>It was in periodical publications that the greater future of
advertising lay, he believed, and particularly in monthlies and
weeklies. They were left about in the house and were turned over
again and again by different people. "But advertisement must be
fresh and different each time. This sort of
thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes, it was, I remember, that same conversation in the
Underground Railway I am recalling, and he pointed to a standard
announcement in the back pages of some monthly magazine.</p>

<p>"This sort of thing is as exasperating as hiccoughs. It comes up
again and again and you can't control it."</p>

<p>He doubted whether the daily newspapers were very much good for
proprietary articles. They were good for theatres and amusements of
all sorts, but not for an advertisand that had to go on selling. He
watched people reading papers in trams and buses. They showed a
vulture's eye for the news they wanted and a wonderful capacity for
sweeping disregard fully across the most tremendous displays of
advertisement. He declared it was possible to print a newspaper
advertisement so big that it was totally invisible. People would
not read type that was visible three yards away. Their eyes went
through the gaps.</p>

<p>"But any sort of stuff that has a quality of news&mdash;'Salmon
is exceptionally cheap to-day,' for example, with a reason for it,
or 'Mackerel in the Channel and Oranges in the Bay,' would get
them. <i>What</i> Bay? There you are! People would read that sort
of thing like any other news."</p>

<p>He weighed that idea carefully. Fishmongering and fruit selling
were still far from any syndication or he would have started a
scheme for a "Fishmongers' Chalk Board" and a "Fruit Shop Bulletin"
in some of the old dailies, a sort of eleventh hour announcement of
goods to hand.</p>

<p>And as the grouping of shops into big centralised stores whIch
my father had done so much to promote, went on, Dickon became more
and more keen on what he called bringing the shop window into the
morning paper. In those days it was beneath the dignity of the
London <i>Times</i>, for example, to admit what are called
displayed advertisements or break its grave grey expanses with
pictures. The other papers in those conservative days did not care
to be very different from <i>The Times</i>, and for a long time,
indeed until the great Americanisation of the press by Harmsworth
and Pearson, Dickon's idea remained an aspiration. Long before it
was done in England, the stores' advertisements flared all over the
American papers; there was an interval of a quarter of a century or
more before the big London stores were brought into a similar
intimate relationship to the popular press.</p>

<p>How recent all this seems to a man of my age! I remember when
shop windows were made of little oblong panes, and lit in the
evenings by a few jets of unassisted gas or an oil-lamp or so, and
when the aim of the window-dresser seemed to be rather to impress
the amount and nature of his stock upon the observer than to
interest and attract him. Then came plate-glass and a depth and
vastness of window-front hitherto undreamt of, and gas-mantles and
electric light. People found a new interest in looking at the long
array of shop windows, and the enterprising heads behind them
realised by degrees&mdash;and there again my father with his
"Shopping and Social Centre of North London Life," was a
pioneer&mdash;that it might be wise to allow people to make a
resort of the interior of their establishments without being
compelled, as they used to be compelled, to make purchases
forthwith or get out. But for a long time the big stores were
content with the local crowds they assembled, and I believe it was
Mr. Gordon Selfridge, coming from America with the brightest and
newest ideas, who at last realised my brother's anticipation and
carried his shop window into the London daily paper.</p>

<p>My brother has a great admiration for Mr. Selfridge, and I have
been privileged to meet him, an unobtrusive man with something of
the shy quiet of a poet. My brother compares him to Mozart on
account of his interest and variety. "He makes some of the older
advertisers sound like the village idiot at a fair beating on a
pan," said Dickon. "A great artist! Oh! a very great and subtle
artist! Some day people will make collections of those Selfridge
advertisements."</p>

<p>So it was Dickon developed. The lax and incidental student of
pure science became the enthusiastic specialist in marketing, an
active force in that change of scale in distributing methods which
is one of the most striking aspects of my immediate world. He began
as I have told, with watches and boots and the early bicycle. He
extended his interests into the special journalism of the bicycle,
and then into a great variety of magazine enterprises. He found
helpers and confederates, associates with capital and partners. He
has always had the gift of being liked, and, oddly enough, his name
helped him. It gave people a shock to begin with, so that they
always remembered it distinctly, and then as they got to know him
they went about remarking upon the paradox of his sterling honesty.
He always kept faith not only with what he said but with what he
thought the other fellow understood by it. In a little time he was
the essential partner of Clissold and Breakspear, and he had his
active fingers in several of the most promising of the new popular
magazine firms that were then appearing.</p>

<p>In six or seven years he was already very well off, able to
marry and establish himself in a fine house in the Cromwell Road.
Quite early he relinquished in my favour his share in the hundred
and sixty pounds a year my mother allowed us, so that I could go
and live in more comfortable apartments near to the Royal College
and carry on as a research student there. He went eastward to a
flat in Bloomsbury until his marriage brought him west again.</p>

<p>But of that marriage and of mine I must tell later.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-5" name="b3-5"></a>§ 5. PHIL. TRANS. AS A MEDIUM</h2>

<p class="first">THERE drifts into my mind the substance of a silly
little conversation that must have occurred somewhen in those old
days before our divergent marriages had diminished our mutual
familiarity. It was before my marriage anyhow, because I see Dickon
in my only armchair as he talks, and there is a litter of notebooks
and drawing material on the table.</p>

<p>He had been asking questions about the drift of my stuff and
confessing himself baffled by it. "You're the brains of the family,
Billy," he said a little ruefully. "Undoubtedly you are the brains
of the family."</p>

<p>"Different brains," I said. "There is <i>one</i> glory of the
sun and another of the moon and another of the stars."</p>

<p>"And another of the hoardings and magazine-covers," said
Dickon&mdash;still a dozen years from sky signs and twenty years
from smoke-writing on the blue.</p>

<p>He fingered the pages of my first papa in the Philosophical
Transactions, a tetter of formulae, and then ran his eye over the
rest of the contents.</p>

<p>"Blastopore of the snail," he objected. "Fancy poking about at
the blastopore of the snail! It's&mdash;indelicate. And
cryohydrates! This chap Oliver Lodge seems to be all over them.
Wonder what they are? Well, this is your affair, Billy. It's up to
you to display the name of Clissold properly in these Philosophical
Transactions. If that is the end of life. Not my pitch. Not in the
least my pitch. I wouldn't try to sell even a stethoscope through
these Philosophical Transactions. No."</p>

<p>He ran his hand over the edges of the pages with a shuddering
sound and reflected profoundly. A liveliness became apparent
presently beneath his depression.</p>

<p>"But all the same, Billy, one of these days, mark my words, I'm
going to cheer up this respectable and awe-inspiring periodical.
Just to please myself. I know exactly what I'm going to do. I'm
going round to the Secretary of the Royal Society, and I'm going to
put such an innocent-looking contract past him that he won't see
for a moment what I'm up to, and then I'm going to give these dull
old Philosophical Transactions of yours a real, spirited Christmas
number, a genuine advertisement display. I'm going to have
everything&mdash;coloured inset leaflets, extra sheets in the
cover, cosmetics, lip-salves, hair-dyes, wigs, corsets&mdash;
<i>men's</i> corsets!&mdash;scents, sensational pictures of
lingerie, toilet fittings in ivory and silver and gold, the
Parisian note loud and clear, soaps recommended by Lillie Langtry
and Sarah. Bernhardt, and complexion stuff by Mary Anderson,
ravIshing portraits of these ladies in colour, super-colour, bath
scenes by Alma Tadema, Lucullus bathrooms, smart restaurants,
hotels, plages, Monte Carlo, Ascot week, Cowes, grey toppers,
hatters to the Prince of Wales, manicure establishments, turf
commission agents, dealers in real diamonds."</p>

<p>I said his advertisers wouldn't like that.</p>

<p>"The poor old dears! Temptation of St. Anthony wouldn't be in
the same field with it!" said Dickon with the confidence of a man
who knows what advertisers will stand. He did not worry about them.
He was thinking of grave, earnest men in spectacles, aghast.</p>

<p>"Tonics," he said, as an afterthought. "Cures for debility.
Ginger. Do you sing in your bath?"</p>

<p>Dickon never had a proper respect for the Royal Society.</p>

<p>"They lead devoted lives," I said.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Dickon. "I know 'em. I know their secret cravings.
They'll eat those advertisements. Doctor Faustus asks for his youth
again! Mephistopheles restores it&mdash;small bottles, one guinea.
You bet."</p>

<p>"Confound it!" I remonstrated. "Dignified work! Vital work! Why
<i>will</i> you always insult men of science?"</p>

<p>And then at the sight of my artless indignation he threw a great
fit of chuckles. "Oh, Billy!" he cried. "Oh, Billy! I got you," and
kicked his legs about.</p>

<p>Always a great lout, my brother Dickon.</p>

<h2><a id="b3-6" name="b3-6"></a>§ 6. DICKON REFLECTS</h2>

<p class="first">WATCHING Dickon and watching the world through
Dickon's eyes has been at times almost more instructive than
watching it through my own. He embarked upon advertising at first,
as I suppose most of the early advertisers did, in a cheerfully
piratical spirit. It was to be his way of "getting it"&mdash;and
that was all that mattered.</p>

<p>But as time went on and his interests spread and his wealth and
power increased, he was obliged almost in spite of himself to
recognise the part that he and his like were playing in the
rephrasing of human life. They were assisting at a synthesis that
was replacing the scattered autonomous various individualism of the
past by a more and more intricate inter-dependent life. He began to
think of advertising less and less as an adventure, and more and
more as an integral social function, with obligations and standards
of its own.</p>

<p>Temperamentally he had never liked falsehood; he had disliked
even reserve if it misled; he always kept as clear as he could from
the pill and patent medicine field, in which lying and bluff figure
so largely, but he had never felt quite happy in his assertion that
in the long run it was better to understate than overstate in an
advertisement. It is largely true, but it has never been wholly
true, that for the individual in business honesty is the best
policy. For a trade as a whole it is certainly true, but not for
the incidental adventurer. He can achieve his "get away," as the
American criminals phrase it, leaving his trade discredited.</p>

<p>Dickon has been a prime mover in the organisation of advertisers
into a professional organisation since the war.</p>

<p>He has helped to found lectureships and establish examinations
in advertisement. I believe he would like to see a special
university degree, Bachelors and Doctors of Advertisement. Some day
we may come to that. Even before the war he was thinking of schemes
for making deliberate falsehood, either in an advertisement or in
the news columns of a newspaper, a felony. "If it was felony for
our father to issue a false balance-sheet which only caused people
monetary loss, it is far more felony to tell some poor old woman in
a cottage that the filth you want to sell cures the pain in her
back, and so waste her last chance of proper treatment for kidney
or cancer."</p>

<p>"Proper treatment!" said I. "Where?"</p>

<p>Dickon stuck to his own line of thought. "Here we have people
making fortunes by keeping people ill, misinforming them about
their symptoms, inducing them to trust in misdescribed goods.
Billy, it's a crime against the Empire. It fills the streets with
uncomfortable people. Poor mothers, induced to give the children
they cared for innutritious muck, so that they grow up
disappointing weeds. All these weedy people in the streets, in the
buses, everywhere&mdash;just because you let advertisers say their
muck is flesh-forming and frame-building and bone-making when every
competent authority knows that it isn't. The poor mother isn't a
competent authority. How can she be? She finds it out too late.
Can't help herself. And in the long run it's bad for advertising.
<i>It's had for advertising</i>. The advertising world has to
sacrifice its black sheep. <i>Has</i> to! Advertisement, Billy, is
too big a thing for lying&mdash;too big a thing. Much too big a
thing. It's the web of modern life; it's the call of the flock. For
most people, flat statement in advertisements is warranty, absolute
warranty.</p>

<p>And it ought to be. They take it as they take the news in the
adjacent columns. The voice of print, Billy, is the voice of God.
To them it is. And it's up to us to see that they get it divine and
true."</p>

<p>I raised my eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Divine and true," said Dickon, raising his voice above me
massively.</p>

<p>I said I supposed our legal theory was that if there was
misdescription there could be an action for damages.</p>

<p>"But how can the poor mutts bring actions against a firm with
scores of thousands to play with? How can they do it? No, I want
the fellows handled by the Public Prosecutor at the instance of a
properly constituted Advertisement Society, and sent to jail."</p>

<p>I was amused. It was down at Dorking, and in 1912 or 1913, that
he discoursed in this fashion. We had been playing tennis and we
were on the terrace above the court. Dickon was sitting in a
deck-chair looking flushed and freckled and over&mdash;healthy and
very, very earnest, drinking an inadvisable whisky and soda.</p>

<p>I raised the old issue between his individualism and my
Socialism. What was all this talk about? Where were his lifelong
principles? He was preaching rank Socialism. Wasn't <i>caveat
emptor</i> the sound principle for an individualist world?</p>

<p>"Individualist be blowed!" said Dickon. "<i>Caveat emptor</i>
was all very well between two Latin peasants at a bargain in that
little old parochial Roman world&mdash;as it <i>was</i>, Billy, as
it was&mdash;but the odds have altered now. I'm thinking of those
weedy children and the old woman with a pain in her side."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-7" name="b3-7"></a>§ 7. THE ADVERTISER AS PROPHET AND
TEACHER</h2>

<p class="first">THE Great War did much to develop Dickon's
conception of his role in the world. He expanded mightily upon a
diet of propaganda. There was a phase in the Reconstruction Period
when it seemed to him that only an adequate advertisement campaign
was needed to achieve the Millennium. I have given these vignettes
of him in the eighties, in the later nineties, and in the pre-war
days as he grew in strength and confidence. Let me anticipate for a
section and complete his apotheosis of advertisement. I must recall
what I can of a discourse of his towards the end of 1918. Then you
will see how the imagination of Dickon the advertiser grew from
that of the watch peddler he was forty years ago to its present
dimensions.</p>

<p>If the Great War made nothing, it did at least appear for a time
to have disorganised everything. The idea that society had been
shattered and would need rebuilding was very prevalent in 1915.
Everything was going to be rebuilt, fairer, sounder, juster,
happier; that went without saying. That was the justification for a
war that was otherwise inexplicable; it was a Phoenix flare. By
1916 this had become a standard promise for all the optimists who
were engaged in whipping up the flagging enthusiasm of the nation.
It crystallised into the word Reconstruction. All our English world
talked Reconstruction, from the pro-war intellectuals, who dropped
off from the war propaganda into silence or opposition after the
collapse of the Stockholm Conference, to the deep <i>John Bull</i>
bellowings of Horatio Bottomley, most popular of patriots and
stimulators.</p>

<p>"A world fit for heroes," said Lloyd George&mdash;phrase
unforgettable. How tremendously that word Reconstruction was
bandied about! It waved as gallantly, it vanished at last as
abruptly, as a contested banner in a riot. Many of us can still
feel uncomfortable if some thoughtless person chances to revive
it.</p>

<p>There was much pitiful moral tragedy in that fiasco, but to
begin with Reconstruction embodied some bold and righteous hopes.
And it completed the evolution of Dickon. Under its spell he became
temporarily a Utopian, more Utopian even than I in my Brompton
days, and planned a world which never had been, but which, it
seemed to him then, might very easily be. He had realised the
tremendous possibilities of handling people in great masses
revealed by this war advertising, in which he had played a
conspicuous part; possibilities of teaching hygienic practices for
example, suggesting new habits or routines, restating and changing
general ideas, altering outlooks altogether. For a time these
realisations possessed him completely.</p>

<p>His Utopianism was amateurish; he had all the crudity of a
sudden convert. He wanted to see the energy that had been gathered
into the great Ministry of Munitions turned directly to the
material rearrangement of the country, the railways re-made, the
countryside re-planned, slums swept away, old beauties restored,
and much of our present towns and cities rebuilt. Then manifestly
the war would not have been in vain. He saw himself directing the
demobilising millions back to abundant work, and homes renewed and
happy, through a vast advertisement organisation. "A land fit for
heroes," he quoted continually&mdash;in his profession they call
that sort of thing a "slogan"&mdash;and it seemed plain to him
after the vision of large-scale human co-operation the war had
given him, that the whole food supply of the world was capable of
control, that population could be poured from district to district
like water, instructed in the requirements of its new surroundings
and held to its effort. He had some magnificent moments in that
Utopian phase of his.</p>

<p>"The war's been a bloody mess, Billy, but at least it's taught
us to handle things in the big way," he said: "the advertising way.
We learnt it by selling mustard and motorcars, but these were only
the things we learnt upon."</p>

<p>And again: "Advertising; what is it? Education. Modern
education, nothing more or less. The airs schoolmasters and college
dons give themselves are extraordinary. They think they're the only
people who teach. <i>We</i> teach ten times as much. Why! even the
little chaps who write the attractions in the big weeklies and
monthlies, Kipling, Jack London, Bennett, Galsworthy, Wodehouse,
all that lot&mdash;teach more than the schoolmasters do.</p>

<p>"Schoolmasters! What do you mean by education? When you get down
to hard tacks. <i>Just old-fashioned, primitive advertisement done
by word of mouth in a room!</i> Why! a class-room schoolmaster
teaching by shouts ought to be as out-of-date nowadays as a
town-crier!</p>

<p>"The only use I've got for schools now is to fit people to read
advertisements. After that, <i>we</i> take on. Yes, we&mdash;the
advertisers. You may laugh, Billy; it's true. All new ideas come as
a shock at first. Don't just laugh at it like that. Don't sit like
an oaf and grin. Tell me what's wrong with it.</p>

<p>"And even in the schools we could put ten times better lessons
over the heads of the masters now&mdash;with a properly organised
cinema. Ten times better. But we leave the cinema to a lot of
music-hall muckers and close-up chorus girls, as though it wasn't
worth using."</p>

<p>He laid great stress upon the cinema, but I do not recall him
saying anything about broadcasting in those Reconstruction days.
But, of course! One forgets how fast the world moves. In 1919 there
was no broadcasting. With broadcasting I can see Dickon reducing
his poor schoolmasters to the last extremity of usherdom&mdash;mere
conductors on his omnibus to knowledge. Before broadcasting he had
at least to leave them an occasional use of their voices. Now they
would just hum on the loud-speaker and stand about and mark
registers. Gagged, perhaps, to prevent any personal
intervention.</p>

<p>His denunciation of schoolmasters increased and intensified, of
schoolmasters and the clergy, as his imagination of what might be
done with the crowd developed. He would talk to me in his
hectoring, elder-brother way, but always with a twinkle in his eye
and a touch of burlesque in his tone and an evident readiness to
jump overboard from his argument at any time with a sudden splash
of laughter if it became too difficult to maintain; and his
argument was always exaltation of the modern advertising method and
always contempt for the refinements of the intellectual world.</p>

<p>"These fellows in caps and gowns think you can make things
decent by being genteel in a corner and shuddering and sneering
whenever you hear a noise. I ask you! You've got to <i>explain</i>
your Millennium to people, Billy; you've got to make 'em want it,
and you've got to tell 'em how to get it. Then they'll get it. Just
as they get Lucas lamps and safety-razor blades or any other old
thing. The advertisand is different, but the method is the
same.</p>

<p>Why, Billy! Look at things plainly. With all
reverence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He adapted his ruddy face roughly and quickly to express all
reverence. It was just an habitual concession unnecessary in my
case.</p>

<p>"What were the twelve Apostles? Drummers, just drummers.
Travelling in salvation. Introducing a new line. Why did Paul raise
his voice at Athens? Because he hadn't a Megaphone. And the
miracles they did? Sample bottles. To this day it's advertisement.
What is a wayside crucifix?&mdash;an advertisement of the faith.
What is Christianity?&mdash;an advertisement campaign. Tell 'em.
Tell 'em. Tell 'em all you can. It's the method of social
existence."</p>

<p>He turned to biology, to the poetry of life.</p>

<p>"The very flowers by the wayside, Billy, are advertisements for
bees!"</p>

<p>My grin armed the fighting spirit in him.</p>

<p>"Vulgar you think it is?"</p>

<p>"Frightfully."</p>

<p>"If there's anything vulgar about modern advertisement, Billy,
it's because it's been so concerned about pills and soap and
pickles. Just a passing phase. A man or a class or a religion
or&mdash;anything that will not advertise isn't fit to exist in the
world. It means it doesn't really believe in itself. To want to
exist and not to dare to exist is something beneath vulgarity....
That's why I have such a contempt for your rotten, shy,
sit-in-the-corner-and-ask-the-dear-Prince-of-Wales-to-dinner-once-a-year
Royal-Society.</p>

<p>"If the soap-boilers did no more for soap than your <i>old</i>
Royal Society does for science," said Dickon, "nobody would
wash."</p>

<h2><a id="b3-8" name="b3-8"></a>§ 8. DICKON'S MARRIAGE</h2>

<p class="first">BUT this post-war talk is, as I intimated, out of
place. I will return to the Period of Reconstruction later. If
nothing else was reconstructed then, we were, and our post-war
interchanges form a distinct and separate chapter in our history.
Before I go on to tell how the war shook up and released and
stimulated our ideas about things in general, I must tell of his
marriage and of a considerable divergence of our ways of living.
When I was three-and-twenty things happened to make me break away
from the life of pure research I had seemed destined to follow. I
became an employee and later a director of Romer, Steinhart, Crest
and Co., I left London to live at Downs-Peabody, and I became more
and more involved in the huge industrial developments that have
occupied the greater half of my life. They had little or no
advertising side. They brought me into a world of associates quite
apart from Dickon's; they carried me abroad for long spells and
made me by comparison cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>He remained extremely English. He lived for some years after his
marriage in the Cromwell Road, and then he bought Lambs Court near
Dorking and became a substantial figure in the substantial
suburbanism of Surrey. I, too, married a little while after he did,
but marriage, which stabilised him, disorganised all my intentions
about life. My marriage was a failure. I will tell of it in due
course, but for some years a certain chagrin may have helped to
make my visits to Dickon's home less frequent than they might
otherwise have been. His marriage was heartily successful,
ostentatiously successful; and for a while I suspected him, I think
now unjustly, of feeling that I was to blame for the muddle I was
in.</p>

<p>Ostentatiously successful I write, but whether it is to be
regarded as a perfect marriage I do not know. I doubt if there is
any such thing as a perfect marriage. It may happen&mdash;as an
accident. To this day I find a certain lurking perplexity about my
sister-in-law in my mind; I have never been able to exorcise it.
There was something extraordinarily fine about her&mdash;and
something cold and aloof. Nor do I yet see as a clear and
consistent thing Dickon's relations to her. He was so incapable of
aloofness. He was floridly and magnificently loyal to her and she
was profoundly loyal to him, but I do not know, I cannot imagine
what there was down there at the very bottom of things between
them. Was it love, the tenderness and infinite consideration she
had for him? It was love at first, no doubt. And mixed with his
infinite respect for her, his pride and his rare overwhelming
tenderness, there was something resentful. Did he always suppress
that resentment in her presence? I do not know. I will tell as much
as I know, what I saw, what I inferred, and leave it to the reader.
Plainly there are things here outside the range of my feelings and
experiences.</p>

<p>She was a very small person; she had fine exquisite features;
she was not a short woman, not dwarfish in any way, but simply made
upon a delicate scale; she looked much more fragile than she was,
and when I first encountered her she was a little strained and
artificial in her manner because she was so valiantly resolved not
to be shy. I met her only a month or so before the marriage, and
when the marriage was already fixed. Dickon had discovered her III
Bloomsbury, and I had a sense that she had been sprung upon me
after a period of uneasiness and concealment on Dickon's part.
There was a sort of tea-party in Dickon's sitting-room, and she was
there under the protection of a cousin, whom I forget altogether,
and I had the spectacle of Dickon, my stern, dogmatic brother,
almost dishevelled with nervousness, proffering tea, handing cakes,
asking me&mdash;me!&mdash;if I took sugar, and watching my face for
the faintest intimations of a judgment.</p>

<p>She was little, not very well dressed, guarded. That much I saw
at the time. We talked about pictures, about which none of us knew
very much, and about music. At Lambs Court there is still a
photograph of her in those early days. One had to sit quite still
for some seconds in those days in order to be photographed, and so
if one did not get blurred one looked like wax-works. She had
contrived to sit quite still. How unaccustomed now are our eyes to
those later Victorian costumes! She had a collar to her dress that
reached to her little ears and great puffed sleeves and a
whale-bone figure.</p>

<p>I forget most of the incidents of that meeting now, but I
remember Dickon afterwards parting from me at Hyde Park Corner.
"You don't see what there is in he!" at first, old man," he said,
for the third or fourth time. Though I had never said a word to
betray that I did not think her the most obviously and instantly
desirable of all possible sisters-in-law. I had hardly said
anything. I did not know what to say.</p>

<p>On our way to Hyde Park Corner he had told me things about her.
She was the daughter of a doctor in Bloomsbury, a very competent
general practitioner. She was a connection of his early partner,
Breakspear. She had passed some examinations&mdash;I forget what
they were but they were difficult ones. She drew beautifully. She
was clever at musk and spoke French and German wonderfully well.
She was an only child, which, I think, accounts for a sort of
reserved inwardness in her manner; she was untrained in the
exposures, criticisms, recriminations, and habitual intimacies of
family life.</p>

<p>She read, I was to discover later, and she studied, but she was
not accustomed to talk. There were moments when I was to watch her
listening to Dickon's discourse and compare her in my mind with a
passenger waiting for a ferry with the river in flood. Waiting as
one waits on a fine agreeable day when waiting is no hardship.
Waiting, moreover, with no intention of travelling on the stream.
And&mdash;to begin with, she was, in a peculiar still way, in love
with Dickon and devoted to him. He, too, was in love with her, but
just the least bit disappointed, I felt, that she did not make a
better show in front of me. Once or twice during those early
encounters he tried to draw her out and exhibit her paces, but she
had little, scarcely perceptible, ways of stopping that. It was
amusing to see Dickon interested in an article that declined to be
pushed. He would have been a terrible impresario for a showy
woman.</p>

<p>I began to think her a little less undistinguished after a
fourth or fifth meeting, and at the wedding I had a feeling that
for some obscure reason she had hitherto been concealing from me
and the world in general an ability to be, if she chose,
conspicuously pretty.</p>

<p>But I still didn't see why it had been necessary for my bright
and exuberant Dickon to marry her. I did not see why he of all
people should be mated to incarnate restraint.</p>

<p>It was a thoroughly respectable wedding, and the house hold they
set up in the Cromwell Road was in the highest degree respectable.
A time was to come when I was to think a lot of Minnie's taste, but
in the furnishing of that first house nothing of her sensitive
fastidiousness appeared. Perhaps it was not yet fully awake. I
suppose Dickon must have just carried her through the furniture
shop with him and given <i>her</i> no time to meditate. The house
was, my brief disturbing wife declared, when she paid <i>her</i>
introductory visit, "utterly and hopelessly <i>banal</i>."</p>

<p>I was married, as I will tell later, about a year and a half
after Dickon, and my marriage took him by surprise as much as his
had taken me. I kept Clara an even closer secret from Dickon than
he had kept Minnie from me. Perhaps I felt what his opinion would
be of the Allbut ménage. I sprang her upon Dickon and Minnie within
a few weeks of our marriage. I took her to call upon Minnie. I went
in a faintly irritated mood because Clara had seen fit to
supplement her wardrobe from an aunt's supplies, and had suddenly
become much more a woman of the world and much less of a hard-up
art girl than was seemly in the future wife of a struggling
research student.</p>

<p>A natural antagonism flared up at the first encounter of Minnie
and Clara. Clara was an effusive human being, and particularly so
with strangers. She fell upon Minnie with cries and embraces. "What
an exquisite little dear you are!" she said.</p>

<p>I was beginning to forget that Minnie was so very small; I saw
her disentangling herself with an unobtrusive distaste from those
swift familiarities. Clara praised her clothes loudly&mdash;they
were in the current fashion of the time&mdash;insisted upon
regarding them as the triumph of :t special effort, and then, with
an obscure perception of rebuff, turned her enthusiasm to the house
and the furniture.</p>

<p>"Jolly <i>good</i> things you have!" she exclaimed. "Where did
you get them all?"</p>

<p>"Dickon and I went to Maple's," said Minnie, regarding her
strictly later Victorian surroundings for a moment as though she
had just seen them for the first time.</p>

<p>Clara looked round for some piece that might be exceptional.
There was nothing exceptional. So she pounced on a book.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> read George Meredith too!" she said.</p>

<p>"Here's Dickon!" said Minnie, relieved as the door
opened....</p>

<p>I became more acutely aware of the sketchy quality in Clara's
smartness as Dickon came in. It was my turn now to watch for
unspoken verdicts. Clara's way with men was sometimes a little
over-confident....</p>

<p>It was not a good call. Dickon, I could see, did not warm to
Clara. Minnie seemed deliberately to be refrigerating the
conversation, and we left with Clara in a splendid rage.</p>

<p>"So <i>that's</i> my prospective sister-in-law!" I remember her
saying on the doorstep.</p>

<p>She paused. "<i>Watchful</i>," she whispered. "She watches."</p>

<p>And then she embarked upon an exhaustive summary of Minnie's
deficiencies. The burthen was that there was nothing in Minnie, but
for all that it was clear that there was much to be said about her.
Firstly, she was personally insignificant. Secondly, she was
cold-blooded. Next, her style of dressing was provincial, timid,
genteel. She was under-dressed. On such an occasion as this it was
rude and offhand to under-dress. One was expected to dress a
little. To meet a chosen sister-in-law was an important occasion
and ought to be treated as such. One ought to make an effort.</p>

<p>The ashes of our controversy over the borrowed finery glowed
again for a moment.</p>

<p>Minnie's furniture and her household management, insisted Clara,
had the same limitations as her costume and the same uncivil
negligence. The tea, for some reason, bad greatly offended Clara.
There had been a lack of variety in the tea; for the first visit of
an imminent sister-in-law there ought to have been display;
everybody nowadays gave little sandwiches, cucumber sandwiches,
paste sandwiches. Amusing things. Light things one just took in
one's hand. It looked skimpy not to do so. And dull. Buttered buns
were ridiculous; hefty things like that ought to be relegated to
the nursery. (At tea Clara had "adored" buttered buns, had received
them with acclamation.)</p>

<p>And that furniture! That <i>heavy</i> furniture! Maple's!
<i>Carte blanche</i> to them to furnish, no doubt. No
individuality. No character. Where <i>could</i> my brother have met
her? No doubt we should have to go to dinner there so soon as we
were married. It would be our first dinner party together. Could we
last two hours? What should we talk about? Even in that forty
minutes' call the talk had caught and hung time after time.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," reflected Clara, "I shan't want much of a frock
for <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>I said very little to Clara's tirade, because it shocked and
irritated me to hear my own secret judgments on Dickon's wife
caricatured, made monstrous and preposterous, and expressed in
terms of intense personal hostility. "She isn't so bad," I said.
"And she makes Dickon happy."</p>

<p>"<i>Does</i> she make him happy?</p>

<p>"Your brother," said Clara, following up her own question,
"would never own to a failure if he felt he could pull it through
to look like a success. He's&mdash;stiff stuff. As stiff as you
are. Obviously she's as flat as ditchwater. Uninteresting. Prosaic.
She paralyses him. If she hadn't been there&mdash;he would have
been different.</p>

<p>Sooner or later he'll be going round the corner. You mark my
words, Billy. But he'll never own up."</p>

<p>I detested her for saying it, but there was something of a
likeness to Dickon in that.</p>

<p>"And she won't either," jerked Clara, suddenly completing her
impression.</p>

<p>"Won't what?"</p>

<p>"Own up."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-9" name="b3-9"></a>§ 9. LAMBS COURT</h2>

<p class="first">THERE with the help of Clara's vivid
expressiveness, which sometimes succeeded in being on the whole
unaccountably right with every detail wrong, you have a sketch of
Minnie. She was neither fiat nor prosaic; she was never
uninteresting; but it is true that she never seemed to take hold of
Dickon, and that she did not seem to take hold of life. He had
taken hold of her, and she liked that; it warmed her as much as
anything could warm her, but there was nothing about her holding on
to him if presently he let go. She was, I had long realised, a
creature of fine secondary shades and complicated shynesses and
reserves, and I have never known anyone with a less voracious will
to live.</p>

<p>I doubted from the first whether he appreciated her fine shades.
His natural disposition was towards poster colourings more suitable
for display. But gradually I came to see that it was not the
delicacy nor the fine shades that he cared about. He had a profound
unshakable belief in her honesty, loyalty and common sense, and she
justified his belief. Whatever else she mayor may not have been to
him, she was, so to speak, his treasury, his brake, his wary
councillor. And though she was never a brilliant talker in society,
I noted that when he quoted her sayings and cited her opinions,
there came out a shrewd individuality quite different from his
own.</p>

<p>They did not have children for a while. Then in the course of
four or five years came a couple of sons and a daughter, and they
went to the space and dignity of Lambs Court and took a great flat
in Queen Anne's Mansions as their <i>pied-à-terre</i> in London. It
was only after her death and the marriage of young Richard that
Dickon left Queen Anne's Mansions for the chambers in Bordon Street
in which this book begins. There were gaps sometimes of two or
three years when I would be abroad, or in the north, or in the
Midlands, and when I saw little of Dickon and Minnie, and so my
memories pass almost abruptly from that rather commonplace, rather
nervously self-conscious and apologetic home in the Cromwell Road
to a very prettily furnished and well-ordered country house, with a
small but very well-dressed and maternal Minnie, keeping a
competent eye on her nursemaids and instructing an entirely
respectful gardener in the development of the very beautiful
terrace gardens she created. The two figures do not merge so
completely as they would have done if our acquaintance had been
continuous. In that case I have no doubt the earlier, immature,
more fragile and shyer Minnie would have been replaced day by day
and bit by bit and effaced altogether from my memory.</p>

<p>In that second phase Minnie had far more confidence, far more
grip upon the world, than in the first. There was a subtle
difference in her relations with Dickon, but it would be hard to
define what that difference was. Perhaps she had passed through
phases of dismay and reassurance. I thought his attitude towards
her was a little more effusive and formal than it had been, and
more habitual. I thought that she seemed no longer to be observing
him with the happy interest of their earlier time. It was as though
she had got used to him and had accepted something that had not
been present in the beginning, or resigned herself to the absence
of something she had once thought there.</p>

<p>She had become a great gardener, which was rather wonderful
after a girlhood in Bloomsbury, and she was also beginning to know
quite a lot about furniture and pictures. Later on she was to
become something of a buyer of pictures and etchings. She would
help struggling artists, until she felt the touch of proprietorship
to which the helped are prone. The children were happy and
delightful then, in a perfect nursery and with an excellent, kindly
nurse; but I do not remember ever seeing Minnie romp with them, and
I doubt if in all her life she ever lost her temper with them. Yet
she loved them. Flowers and furnishing, I think, she cared for more
than living things; she could do so much more for them without
provoking them to come back upon her clamorously. They did not
climb upon her, they did not shout or hammer at her, as human
beings might at any time do.</p>

<p>After a time I went no more to Lambs Court. I stayed away for
nearly seven years. While Dickon's marriage had turned out
successfully, mine had ended in the uncomfortable tangle I will
describe later. I was tied to Clara legally for the rest of my
life, and unable to marry again. I was welcome at Lambs Court as a
sort of bachelor brother, very welcome, even after I had been cited
as a co-respondent in the Evans divorce case, but I felt a certain
exemplariness in Dickon's attitude towards me and an implicit
criticism in the immense discreet silences of Minnie. There were
times when Dickon's gestures, pauses, acts seemed to say almost as
plainly as though he spoke the words: "My dear fellow, why are you
in this uneasy mess? It is so perfectly simple. All you have to do
is to marry Minnie, make much of her, stick to her, stand up for
her, stick to business&mdash;and keep strange women in their proper
place. Out of the picture. And there you are, you know!"</p>

<p>Quite possibly my suspicions were unjust. At any rate he was
habitually proud of her and as good and faithful a husband as most
of the rich and rising business men of Surrey.</p>

<p>Then came my attempt to live with Mrs. Evans. That was in the
turn of the century and people in England were still unprepared to
tolerate a menage, however stable, of two unmarried people. So long
as I was a man of the world, carrying on a series of incidental
intrigues almost openly, I was socially acceptable anywhere; but an
attempt at illicit domesticity, with a still undivorced Clara,
however disreputable, in existence, was too much for the standards
of the time. If I could have divorced Clara and married Sirrie
Evans, all would have been well. I wouldn't accept that verdict. I
fought. I betrayed excessive resentment.</p>

<p>I would not ask Minnie for any help in the matter, I made no
attempt to bring her and Sirrie, together, I said nothing to
Dickon, but I felt acutely theIr failure to apprehend our
situation. Minnie ignored it. She did not know this Mrs. Evans, and
apparently she would not know this Mrs. Evans. She asked me to come
to Lambs Court alone, and I never answered her invitation. I did
not see her again or communicate directly with her until a year or
more after Sirrie's death.</p>

<p>To this day that lack of initiative perplexes me. By the time of
the Evans affair she and I had become very friendly. She did not
know Sirrie, she may not have been prepared to take any very
serious risks about her, but still she might have assumed that I
should not have become attached to a woman without good qualities,
and it would have been quite possible for her to have found out and
met Sirrie in some roundabout way before committing herself. But
she just did nothing. She was one of a number of people who just
did nothing to help us. Something cold and distant there was in
that. Or something profoundly timid? Or some aversion from
relationships into which there entered a possible thread of
passion?</p>

<p>Dickon knew Sirrie slightly. One might have imagined that he
could have broken down that icy barrier by a word or so. But he did
not, and perhaps he could not. The barrier may not have been solely
for the benefit of Sirrie.</p>

<p>I do not know. Sirrie may have symbolised many things for Minnie
and Dickon that had little to do with me. I continued to meet
Dickon in London. We had both become members of the Ermine Club,
and we would lunch or dine and gossip together without any allusion
to the complete separation of our households. Nothing was ever
explained. We belonged to the same group of after-lunch talkers. We
gibed at each other's opinions and went to one or two theatres
together. But about the rest of his life during that estrangement I
made no inquiry beyond such information as he volunteered. I
continued to be aware of Minnie only in relation to him.</p>

<p>He varied towards her no doubt. Sometimes when I met him in
London Minnie was as remote from him but as necessary to the world
and as much taken for granted as the Atlantic or the Equator. At
other times he was full of quotations from her and references to
her. Then, oddly enough, I was not so sure of his serene and
complete assurance about her. It has been the common habit of our
two lives never to pry into the intimate proceedings of the other,
but I have had a feeling that in these phases of allusion, these
passages peppered with "My wife says this" and "Minnie does that,"
he perceived himself under a necessity to maintain her. Yet it
would be difficult to define what it was he maintained her
against.</p>

<p>Whatever imperfections and difficulties there were in his
married life, whatever hidden relaxations there were of its outward
integrity, none of them ever came to the surface as a visible
infringement of Minnie's dignities. There were, I happen to know,
what the French call <i>passades</i>, but the heroines were obscure
young ladies, amply compensated and silenced. He was, I repeat, as
good and faithful a husband as most honourable, prosperous men.</p>

<p>One spring day in 1910 I found myself put down at a Romer lunch
party next to Minnie. I was sure they would put me next to her as
soon as I saw her in the drawing-room. She had altered very little;
she was, perhaps, stronger and firmer and better dressed. She
looked like very good porcelain amidst the metallic splendours of
Lady Romer's assembly.</p>

<p>I put as good a face as I could upon the encounter. I asked
after Lambs Court and the children.</p>

<p>"William the Second," she said, "is absurdly like you. He has a
gift. He is going to draw&mdash;wonderfully. The two brothers
together are like Dickon and you&mdash;even to the way they insult
each other."</p>

<p>She said something about my coming down to see them. Then in a
pause she made a great effort. "Billy," she said very softly, "I
was so sorry to hear of your loss."</p>

<p>I was too astonished to say anything.</p>

<p>"I wanted to write. I was stupid.... I often don't do things I
want to do."</p>

<p>She was feeling her way towards an apology, and she was flushed
and sincere. It was a sort of confession for one who could not
confess. She became more incomprehensible to me than ever. I was
quite unable to get her into relationship with that old and now
healing sore. I dismissed the attempt.</p>

<p>"I would like to see something of William the Second," I said,
after a clumsy interval. "I've neglected my god-son."</p>

<p>"Next week-end?" she said as awkwardly....</p>

<p>It was the most intimate moment we ever had together.</p>

<p>Thereafter our outward friendship&mdash;and I can imagine no
friendship of Minnie's that except for the rarest moments was other
than external&mdash;was resumed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-10" name="b3-10"></a>§ 10. HONOURS LIST</h2>

<p class="first">BETWEEN that meeting and my later memories of
Minnie, streams all the storm, tragedy, and illumination of the
war. The war that has changed so much and yet ;t times seems to
have changed nothing.</p>

<p>I never expected the war to happen until it was actually
happening. Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co. were naturally in touch
with much pre-war armament business, and armament seemed to
us&mdash;to me, at any rate, it seemed&mdash;a foolish way of using
up good metal that fools had got to pay for as highly as possible.
I still think the war need not have happened, and that the amount
of good that has come out of it is incomparably smaller than the
waste and evil. It is easy to be wise after the event and say how
inevitable the catastrophe was, but I do not think it was
inevitable even so late as July, 1914. More intelligent men in the
Foreign Offices could, I think, have averted it even then. But few
of us were intelligent and imaginative enough to realise the
enormity of the disaster until it was upon us. We expected a quick
war, possible humiliations, great changes of the map and far less
strain, destruction, and uprooting. Most of our Governments and
rulers were as little able to foresee and fear as so many mentally
defective children with a box of matches in a powder magazine. At
last a match was dropped. Then for a time the skies were darkened,
the world was full of thunder, the torrents of disaster poured.
There was a clatter of falling things, a flare of burning. Millions
of young men suffered detestable things and died and passed. And at
last when it had come to seem that no end would ever be possible,
the storm was over and the skies cleared magically.</p>

<p>The tornado struck Lambs Court, seemed likely to extinguish the
life of Lambs Court altogether, and left it at last&mdash;with
scarcely a flower-bed ruffled. Dick and William, my nephews, both
went into the war and survived it</p>

<p>William unscathed, Dick with a bullet wound and a six months'
spell of prison in Germany after Gough's disaster in 1918. Indeed,
Lambs Court came through it amazingly. Week-end parties were
already resumed in 1919. And Dickon was made a baronet! Dickon was
made a baronet and Minnie became Lady Clissold&mdash;to my infinite
amazement and perplexity.</p>

<p>The war, I say, took me by surprise, but so soon as it was under
way my role was marked out for me. I was too old for the earlier
enlistments, and I doubt if in any case I should have volunteered.
I gravitated naturally to technical work, and was presently
involved in the new-formed Ministry of Munitions. I did four years
of bitter contentious work, and I should suppose that Roderick and
I between us saved the British taxpayer many, probably negligible,
millions of pounds. My estimates of current honesty and current
intelligence were considerably lowered by those experiences; I
conceived a passionate contempt and distaste for the higher ranks
of the British Army that I still have trouble in controlling, and I
came to consider and treat the military, naval, and aerial expert,
salaried adviser of the War Office to-day and highly salaried
official of an armament group to-morrow, as the moral inferior of a
Constantinople tourists' dragoman.</p>

<p>At the end I dodged the shower of honours with considerable
difficulty. There were a number of people who were deeply concerned
that I should get something and be generally soothed, pacified,
implicated, and shut up. I transferred a particularly persistent
suggestion of a K.B.E. to a useful subordinate who might have been
passed over, the sort of man to appreciate it, and I tried to use
whatever claim to attention I might have in hunting down one or two
exceptionally scandalous cases. In that I failed completely. The
Press would not touch my entirely convincing facts. Nobody would
touch them. One of my worst offenders married his loot to American
money and became a bright ornament for any London dinner-party;
another took the fancy of Royalty; another embarrassed me by
appearing on the board of an allied steel firm with which we had
the friendliest relations. After a while I realised that I was
being unreasonable and self-righteous. I began to laugh at my own
virtue. If there was to be a real inquisition into stolen goods,
where should we end?</p>

<p>Dickon was more surprised by the war even than I was. He had
never believed that these European armies were really in earnest,
and he had been inclined to approve of German imperialism as of
something pleasantly flamboyant and picturesque in an age inclined
to be prosaic. It advertised amazingly. When the guns began to go
off he was outraged beyond measure at the breach of faith. It was
as though a large bill-stickers' hoarding had begun to kill and eat
people. There seemed nothing for it at first but violence with an
axe.</p>

<p>He was furiously indignant against the Germans. So indeed was I
in the early months. So was all England. At this resurrection of
war. The awakening of England in the autumn of 1914 may have been
uncritical and foolish, but it was thoroughly honest, and so far at
any rate as the million odd volunteers were concerned, heroic. By
the end of the year Dickon had somehow contrived to get into khaki.
He was fully fifty, and I do not know how he managed it, but he
did. He had once in the early bicycle days spent some months in
that now forgotten supplement to the military might of Britain, the
Volunteers. He was keen then on cyclist riflemen. He may have
exaggerated his former standing in that force. At any rate, he was
taken on. I cherish a snapshot of his substantial figure with a
lieutenant's star upon his collar, looking very earnest and
unsuitable. Afterwards, for some reason of etiquette in connection
with supplies, they jumped him up to be a temporary colonel, and at
that he could stand beside the stoutest of them, stouter than any
and taller than most. He was trained at Checkershill and then on
Cumberbatch Moor, but that was as near as he travelled on the road
to the trenches. He went to France, indeed, but by a different
route. They found they wanted him on the commissariat.</p>

<p>A man who could advertise things for retail sale was naturally
supposed by the military authorities to know how to buy and
distribute anything. He did some thoroughly sound work for them,
and afterwards he became a great factor in civil food-control
organisation. He worked hard under Rhondda, an able, ailing,
concentrated man who might be alive to-day, perhaps, if it had not
been for the strain of that work, and after Rhondda died Dickon
went on with Clynes, a Labour leader, who had joined the
Government. Through Dickon I met Clynes on two or three occasions.
He was a little intelligent-looking cockatoo of a man, who, like
Brer Rabbit, kept on saying nuffing all the time, in the face of
every conversational allurement. Perhaps, like one or two others of
his colleagues, he needs a platform, a large hall and adequate
interruption, before he can really express what is in him.</p>

<p>"Does he know anything?" I asked Dickon afterwards. "He knows
what he doesn't know," said Dickon.</p>

<p>"He's perfectly satisfactory to work with."</p>

<p>A foretaste of the Labour Government of 1924.</p>

<p>Dick, my elder nephew, volunteered before his father at the
beginning; William was taken later, protesting, but without
bitterness, that it wasn't his fight. Lambs Court was presently
filled with convalescents and a trained staff, and my niece Winnie
was sent up to London, out of sentimental range, to work with great
energy at the manufacture of bandages, a little resentful because
her mother would not allow her to drive a car for the Ministry of
Munitions. Minnie presided capably at Lambs Court, and presently,
after strains and endless petty hardships, scanty food, darkened
homes, tiresome air-raids, gleams of leave for the boys, almost
overwhelming anxiety over Dick's disappearance&mdash;he was
"missing" for three weeks&mdash;and a sort of universal
neurasthenia, the war came abruptly to its hysterical end. Down
either side of Pall Mall hundreds of captured guns were displayed,
the streets of London were alight again and swarming with a vast,
wearily enthusiastic multitude which laughed and shouted because it
did not want to howl and cry, and the war was over. And Dickon was
talking with passionate conviction of a Britain born again out of
these troubles and of a "reconstructed" world.</p>

<p>That was the background so to speak to the affair of his
baronetcy.</p>

<p>I realised that he did not intend to refuse it, with an
indignation that now strikes me as excessive. At the time it seemed
extravagantly important to me that my brother should not accept
this thing. I suppose I was overworked and worried, in a state of
inflamed honesty, more indignant and less cynically patient than I
have ever been before or since. I was in conflict with my business
associates. Perhaps I should have been better employed in watching
them. Brampsheet particularly&mdash;he had just got his
peerage&mdash;was against all post-war scandals and inquiries, and
my anger extended to the social world which was sheltering the men
I wanted to expose. This had been the war that was to end all that
sort of thing. These exasperations made me see Dickon's title as a
sort of treason to the insurgent radicalism that had always been
implicit between us.</p>

<p>"Dickon!" I protested. "That old livery! In an age of
Reconstruction!"</p>

<p>"Historical, time-honoured."</p>

<p>"Everything we want to say good-bye to."</p>

<p>"All the same&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean to take it, Dickon?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, I think I may take it."</p>

<p>"You'll have to kiss the king's hand?" I invented.</p>

<p>Dickon pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>"You'll have to kiss his hand," I jeered.</p>

<p>"No more than kissing a book."</p>

<p>He went off at a tangent to answer unspoken objections of mine.
"You live in a sort of dreamland, Billy," he said. "Science and the
future and all that. Even now. In spite of your business and money.
But I live in the present time. I'm here and now. I'm contemporary.
A child of the age. This sort of thing is the fashion of our time.
It's just a symbol of success and service. Very well. It may not be
the best of media, but it's one way of saying 'I'm here!' That's
how I look at it."</p>

<p>It was as if we were back in our Brompton diggings.</p>

<p>That, I remembered suddenly, had been his standing argument
against my Socialism.</p>

<p>"It's bolstering up the old order. You take the honour,
yes&mdash;but you give your adhesion."</p>

<p>He said I lacked <i>savoir-faire</i>. That if one went on those
lines one would become a "lone wolf." One didn't bolster up the old
order. On the contrary, it acknowledged itself subdued. It stood on
one side to make way for one. Saluted. And besides&mdash;with a
quick change of line&mdash;he wanted Minnie to be Lady
Clissold.</p>

<p>"Have you asked her?"</p>

<p>"And the old man's name," said Dickon, with a second flash of
deafness. "I've always had a feeling about the honour of the old
man. Here it is at last&mdash;his name rather than mine. Sir
Richard Clissold, Bart. After the way they let him down. After that
last scene at the Old Bailey."</p>

<p>"Sir Richard Clissold Boop," said I.</p>

<p>"Eh? "</p>

<p>"Boop. The Boops and their Jubilee. Good God, man, you haven't
forgotten the Boops, have you? All this, Dickon, strikes me as the
most infernal Boopery. You'll have to wear a little Boopy sword.
And silk legs! And the Boops will stand around in their little
Boopy robes, dressing-gowns and tea- cosies and table-cloths and
curtains and antimacassar wigs and newspaper hats, all very solemn
and solemn, to welcome you. Don't you remember? "</p>

<p>He did. But he didn't want to do so. He embarked upon an
insincere defence of royalty. "They" were so hard-working, so
devoted. "Hardest-working couple in the Empire."</p>

<p>"To no purpose," said I, "except to stick on."</p>

<p>"So much to do," said Dickson. "Reconstruction everywhere. Why
dIvIde people by quarrelling with that?"</p>

<p>I told him that people of his sort defended the crown because
they were too lazy to set about getting it out of their way. They
only pretended to like it. It obstructed the traffic. It falsified
realities.</p>

<p>"Bit too many royal visits and processions just now, I admit,"
said Dickon. "Still&mdash;they <i>are</i> the decentest!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and tried to look indulgent and
reasonable and as much like <i>The Times</i> and <i>Punch</i> and a
white top-hat in Ascot week as possible.</p>

<p>It was not only the traffic in the streets, I said. It was the
traffic in men's minds. It put the common people wrong about the
purposes .of the State.</p>

<p>"They love it," said Dickon.</p>

<p>"That's just it," said I. "It's a lumbering perversion of human
respect. A modern community can't afford to waste its respect like
that!"</p>

<p>That consideration has been my unwavering objection to monarchy
and has made me that rare being, an English republican. I am
puzzled by the readiness of liberal-minded English people to
acquiesce in and conform to the monarchy. The king is necessarily
the head and centre of the old army system, of the diplomatic
tradition, of hieratic privileges, of a sort of false England that
veils the realities of English life. While he remains, the old army
system remains, Society remains, the militant tradition remains.
They are all bound up together, inseparably. The people cannot
apprehend themselves in relation to the world while, at every turn
and crisis of the collective life, the national king, the national
uniforms, the national flags and bands, thrust blare and bunting
across the realities. For millions these shows are naturally
accepted as the realities. They personify and intensify and ensure
the national distinction, the separation of the marching, fighting,
grabbing Empire from the general business of mankind. How else can
a monarchy work considering how monarchs are made and trained and
flattered?</p>

<p>For a time Dickon and I wrangled over the issue between monarchy
and republicanism. The United States, said Dickon, could be
republican and intensely nationalist; France&mdash;this was in
1919&mdash;was republican and militarist. Americans, I said, were
not nationalist, but were obsessed by an unavoidable sense of
difference. As for France&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"King!" said Dickon, with a nimble change of front, "but after
all what's the king got to do with my baronetcy? I shall scarcely
see him long enough to make a face at him. He'll ask, 'Who's that
fine man?' And forget when they tell him. It's L.G.'s affair.
You're taking the whole of this business too seriously, Billy. You
are indeed. You're putting it on too broad a basis. You're so
fierce a republican I doubt if you'd read a book if you found it
was printed on crown octavo."</p>

<p>He followed that up. "It isn't as though L.G.'s titles were so
damned serious as all that. There's something like derision in most
of his creations. They're just a flare up at the end. The last
dance of the old costume ball. Before it is all swept away."</p>

<p>"In that case Lady Clissold becomes a comic title."</p>

<p>"If it was only for the pleasure it would give the servants at
Lambs Court I'd take the title," said Dickon.</p>

<p>"You won't take it," I said.</p>

<p>"I'll do it&mdash;if only to annoy you."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"It's just like buying a fur coat for Minnie. It's a decoration.
It's a way of putting her over the heads of a lot of showy,
chattering bitches that aren't worth a tenth of her."</p>

<p>"There's no need to make Minnie a Lady by the King's grace," I
said. "And as for putting her over those other ladies, you're just
putting her among them. And that reminds me: have you asked her
about it?"</p>

<p>He had not. And I realised in a flash he was not quite sure what
she would say about it. That was why he was trying over the
proposal on me first of all, to get a review of the possible
objections.</p>

<p>"She won't let you," I said. "She won't let you." But she did
let him. Dickon took his baronetcy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-11" name="b3-11"></a>§ 11. MINNIE'S FAREWELL</h2>

<p class="first">MINNIE died very suddenly in the early part of
1920. She died under an operation that no one had thought very
dangerous. But though she told it to no one, she had a feeling of
danger, and she did a thing that was to reveal to me as nothing
else could have done, the real quality of her relations to Dickon
and the world, their aloofness and their filmy tenderness.</p>

<p>Her presentiment of death was very strong. But I do not think
she was very deeply troubled at the thought of dying. I suppose
that people who live with delicacy rather than intensity can die
without any great mental agony. She was troubled about Dickon much
more than on her own account; she thought her possible death might
be a shock for him, and she feared that shock. So she wrote him a
letter&mdash;a letter that was only to reach his hands if she died.
Otherwise it would just have vanished like many another thing she
must have thought of and done in that reserved life of hers. I saw
that letter. He was impelled to show it to some one, and he showed
it to me.</p>

<p>I was at Dorking with him after the funeral, and he suddenly
came into the library with it in his hand. It was already a little
worn with much re-reading. He looked at me with eyes that were
distressed and perplexed.</p>

<p>"Billy," he said, "I want you to read this. I want you very much
to read this. From her. After she died."</p>

<p>I was inclined to demur.</p>

<p>He pushed it into my hand. "Read it," he said, and again
impatiently as he went out of the room, <i>"Read it."</i></p>

<p>A pencilled note, it was, but in a firm, clear hand. Written
without haste. Punctuated, so that one seemed to hear Minnie's
characteristic little pauses for deliberation. No outpourings. No
abandonment to her impulses, no confidence in her impulses. A
skilful letter written carefully for a definite purpose.</p>

<p>It was Minnie come back to life. It was Minnie quintessentially.
Except for one or two phrases at the end that stuck in my memory, I
cannot remember much of its exact wording. I read it only once. But
it was, I think, the tenderest of all imaginable caresses that she
reached across the grave to give him. Like Minnie, like all of
Minnie, it was faintly aloof from complete participation in life.
Because it was faintly aloof it was also faintly insincere.
Insincere, I mean, in the sense that she did not seem to believe
completely even in her own life and death. But not in any egoistic
sense insincere. She was not posing. She did not seem to be
thinking about herself at all. She said not a word of any
unwillingness to be torn untimely from life. So far as she was
concerned, I feel she was capable of saying: "Have I to go, then ?
Very well, I am ready," even with the faint shadow of a smile upon
her lips.</p>

<p>But Dickon in distress, Dickon left alone, big Dickon with his
capacity for vivid remorse hiding a heartache, and with no
possibility of a word to cure it, was another matter. That had got
through to her as a real and dreadful possibility, and she had done
her best with it.</p>

<p>"If I have to leave this queer, wonderful existence," she said,
"I want you to know how happy you have made me in it.</p>

<p>That was the text of it, that was all she wrote about, the value
he had given life for her. Nothing else.</p>

<p>I thought of many things between them. I saw for the first time
as I read her letter with what comprehension she had understood his
quality. I saw how well she knew him, and how she feared his easy
and abundant remorse. She said nothing of any contentious things,
harped upon no forgiving for the derelictions she must have known
he had committed, but she said how happy and full she had found
every hour with him, she reminded him of many kindnesses and
generosities he had shown her, and of the great joint adventure of
their worldly success. She recalled a score of little intimate
delightful things, mostly from their early years, that she had
treasured in her memory.</p>

<p>"The fun we have had, Dickon! The dear boys and Winnie! They
were such fine and happy things to have launched into the world.
And they get their brightness and courage, my dear, from you."</p>

<p>All things must end, she said, and if this was the end of this
strange, lovely, difficult world for her&mdash;well, she was sorry
to leave him, sorry indeed, but thankful for all she had had, and
thankful to him.</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Dickon, my own, be sorry&mdash;I know you
will be sorry for the parting; but do not <i>grieve</i>, dear
Dickon. Do not <i>mind</i> too much about things that never really
mattered, do not <i>mind</i> about them. Think of the life that has
been so good with you and not of the death at the end. Think of the
work that lies before you and the big tasks you have to do. You are
only beginning. I know there is endless work before you yet. I wish
I could have watched you and stood beside you a little longer.
Dickon, my <i>dear</i>, thank you and thank you and thank you....
And again, dear Dickon, thank you and God bless you, and, if it
must be, good-bye."</p>
<br>

<p>In that manner, in such words, it ended.</p>

<p>Dickon stood before me again and I gave him back the letter.</p>

<p>"You've read it?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Well.... Tell me something.... Was she really happy, Billy? Did
I really make her happy?, As she says I did?"</p>

<p>"Certain, Dickon."</p>

<p>"Then why should she doubt?"</p>

<p>"Doubt what?"</p>

<p>"About what I should feel. If she didn't think that perhaps I
had seen that she&mdash;she wasn't quite as hard and happy as she
braved it out she was. There were times&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're tormenting yourself."</p>

<p>"But isn't she just saying those things&mdash; She may be just
saying those things&mdash; Thinking of me.... She did things like
that. She couldn't bear-hurting. Anybody being hurt. She'd a kind
of terror of anybody being hurt&mdash;or remorseful....</p>

<p>"You don't know, Billy, at times when I've been a bit disposed
perhaps to be heavy-handed with the boys&mdash;how she's stood
in....</p>

<p>"And the thought she had&mdash;for old servants. For people in
trouble.... I could tell you things. Noticing when an old housemaid
wanted glasses. Feeling when people were overworked or burthened.
Things like that. Always for going gently...."</p>

<p>He stared at me. "A man lives with a woman all his life, Billy.
Eats with her, sleeps beside her. Happiness. Tears. Endless.... And
he doesn't know much about her. At the end, he doesn't know much
about her."</p>

<p>"She loved you all right, Dickon. More than you deserved, old
man. And you made her happy. I've watched her. She was a happy
woman, proud of you, proud of the opportunities you gave her, proud
of this house and life here&mdash;and content."</p>

<p>"But you know, Billy, and I know&mdash;I've been like most
men...."</p>

<p>"So far above such things, Dickon," I said; "they never touched
her."</p>

<p>"But many a time I must have been&mdash;a bit of a lump to
her.... A man's so much rougher and clumsier."</p>

<p>"She didn't feel it like that."</p>

<p>"Eh!" he said, and then for the first and last time in my life I
saw my brother weep.</p>

<p>Never in our childhood and boyhood had I seen his tears, not
even when our father died. But now he did not conceal his distress.
"Tears won't bring her back," he said. "Not tears. Not wishing. Not
repenting.... Nothing will bring her back to me.... Not for a word.
Not for a moment&mdash;to tell her... <i>What could I tell
her?</i>"</p>

<p>He went to the window and stood there with his back to me to
hide his face.</p>

<p>"If I could be sure," he said. "If I could believe it! That I
made her happy?"</p>

<p>He became quite still, an immense broad back against the park
and the sky.</p>

<p>"Kindness," he whispered to the unresponsive heavens.</p>

<p>"Kindness, tenderness, the years of it, from the beginning to
the end.... That quiet kindness."</p>

<p>He turned and addressed me&mdash;how can I put it?&mdash;as
though I wasn't there.</p>

<p>"Nobody knew her but me," said Dickon. "Nobody knew anything
about her really but me. Nothing at all. Nobody thought enough of
her. Nobody had any idea. I've been her husband for thirty-one
years, Billy&mdash;I've never found her lying to me or herself. And
courage&mdash;I've never known her flinch. A little thing she was
and she could look pain in the face. Take it as something one had
to take. And when Dick was missing&mdash;that April! Three weeks we
had of it and never a flicker because she had to stand by me. I
just saw one day how white her face was. Or else I might have
thought she didn't feel.... But she felt....</p>

<p>"What a time that was!... Loyal! Strong! And I've let her be in
the background. I've let it seem as though she wasn't anything so
very much... didn't matter....</p>

<p>"Billy, I was silly to take that old title, but don't you see
how desperately a man may feel that his wife ought to be honoured?
Somehow. When she won't take any honour! So that he sticks tinsel
on her&mdash;in desperation. She let me do it. She understood....
My lady! Princess she was! Princess&mdash;with something cool and
sweet. Like moonlight.... Silver.... All my days ought to have been
gratitude....</p>

<p>"Oh, what <i>good</i> is it talking?"</p>

<p>He looked out of the window again and I could have imagined he
was expecting a reply from the twilight.</p>

<p>"Silence," he said, at last.</p>

<h2><a id="b3-12" name="b3-12"></a>§ 12. PERIOD OF
RECONSTRUCTION</h2>

<p class="first">WAS she a cynic? I think the answer is Yes. On
that basis I can explain her but on no other. Hers was a cynicism
fine as carved ivory, but it was cynicism. It had neither
aggression nor insult in it, but for her I do really think that
Virtue, as the Ancient Cynics meant it, and Freedom, were the only
good things. She was as completely disillusioned about the pomps
and vanities, the received values and accepted gratifications of
the life we live as I, but in addition she was disillusioned, as I
have never been, about the power of the life within us. She was
weak in effort and she knew it. So she would not thrust out to
blunder. She accepted. She accepted good and avoided evil. She
thought fighting evil was itself an evil. It made one hot and
angry. So one went by on the other side. She could not understand
the sort of drive that achieves, even if it achieves blunderingly.
She could not understand the "dust and heat" of endeavour.</p>

<p>Because of that way of thinking she came a little to underrate
Dickon, I suspect, after his first glamour had faded. His
infidelities, his urgencies, his sudden changes of direction, his
excessive admirations of questionable leaders&mdash;of Lloyd
George, of Milner, of Northcliffe, for example&mdash;his storms of
combative energy that had to find an outlet and so often found a
wrong one, were incomprehensible to her. Yet as that last letter
showed, she kept an infinite kindliness for him to the end.</p>

<p>Dickon, as people say, "adored" her, and yet he never seemed to
me perfectly self-forgetful and at his ease with her. Even if she
did not underrate him, his tender conscience made him feel she
ought to do so. He was capable of a good deal of expressive
coarseness in his conversation, but in her presence he was always
rather carefully decent. He never talked before her of his sincere
enthusiasm for his calling. The rising tides of Advertisement broke
and recoiled from the gates of Lambs Court. The best conversations
I had with him during her life were away from her, and it is since
her death that he seems to me to have developed most interestingly
and boldly. Dickon was incapable of amateurism, and not only his
life, but his whole view of life, had to centre upon his
occupation. Even more than in my own case, his activities had to be
related to the beginnings of things and the utmost star. But he
felt her gentle irony at the gravity of his prolusions, her
scepticism of the values in his drama, her recognition of his
egoism. She was terribly, because so unconsciously and inevitably,
a delicate lady, and not an actress upon the stage of life.</p>

<p>This contrast between them intensified as the years went on. At
first he carried her with him much more than he did in their later
years. He talked most of his thoughts to her. When he talked to her
he could persuade her. Then, I think, he became shy of something
passive in her assents. She approved, but she never came to meet
him. He felt that in her presence his ideas became huge and clumsy,
sweaty and crude&mdash;as new things must be crude, and that he
forced them on her. So he ceased to force them on her. There is a
vein of self-distrust deep in Dickon's nature.</p>

<p>His ascendency over me was established so early and so firmly in
our student days that it only dawns upon me now that at times
Dickon must have been sensitive to my opinions. Innovation,
experimenting, "giving the thing a try," were the quality of his
life. He felt the risk in some of his views and acts. And she so
manifestly favoured ripened and finished things, fine old
furniture, works of art rather than works of science, polished
conduct and acts as perfectly adjusted from their very inception as
the muscles of a Persian kitten.</p>

<p>Dickon was greatly stirred by the war and by his own experiences
of the war. As I have told, he was attaching very broad ideas to
advertisement even before the war. Propaganda was an immensely
stimulating discovery for him. And the idea of Reconstruction after
the war seized upon him, interwove with those expanding ideas about
advertising, and for a time possessed him altogether.</p>

<p>The Period of Reconstruction is still only five or six years
behind us, and already it is difficult to revive its emotions and
expectations. Even more difficult is it to recall the mental states
of the war.</p>

<p>We began with heroism and sacrifice. I shall insist to the end
of my days that the last months of 1914 were a tragically splendid
phase in European experience, months of high, heroic, terrified
living for a great multitude of people. I do not think that so far
as we English were concerned the war degenerated greatly until the
latter part of 1916. Then with conscription the mirage of greatness
vanished. Like a mirage its disappearance was imperceptible. One
became aware that it had gone. The war was discovered to be a daily
tale of stupid and beastly destruction, moral even more than
physical.</p>

<p>And then it was that the clam our for Reconstruction became
strong. All this bloodshed and waste was the agony in which a new
and fairer world was to be born; the war was to end war and social
injustice. This slaughter was the seed-time sacrifice from which we
should reap the brotherhood of man.</p>

<p>In the years immediately after the war, with the frightful
squalor and sufferings, the fear, pain and stress, the atrocious
wastage and tragic heroisms of the struggle fresh in our minds, it
was a moral impossibility not to think that there must have been
something more than mere destruction, mere warning, in this immense
disaster; that somehow a price had been paid and a gain achieved. I
suppose I am an exceptionally sceptical man, but I confess that was
my conviction for some time. Only very slowly did I begin to accept
the possibility that the abyss had swallowed up that enormous
wealth of life, effort, and material accumulation, that it was gone
for good, gone never to return, without recompense or
consolation.</p>

<p><i>Now</i> we can begin to face that monstrous verity. The war
did no more for mankind than the Black Death or a forest fire. It
solved nothing, inaugurated nothing. At best it swept away
illusions. The Period of Reconstruction was the hectic death of one
of the greatest of these; that good arises automatically out of
suffering.</p>

<p>But while my resort to the consolation of the Reconstruction
Period was at least temperate, Dickon's acquiescence in that idea
of a comprehensive and forward movement in human conditions was
passionate and complete. "A world fit for heroes," he reiterated.
"Magnificent phrase, Billy! And it's alive. It will do things."</p>

<p>He did think it would do things. But what he thought it would do
I still do not find very clear.</p>

<p>Across the seas came Woodrow Wilson, with that large, gaunt face
of his, solemnly inscrutable, bringing his schoolboy essay in
politics, his Fourteen Points. We knew nothing then of his vanity
and narrowness nor of his limited authority. Nor.did he. He seemed
to promise the organisation of a world peace. Within the framework
of security this ensured, there was to be a sort of voluntary
collectivism. It was not to be Socialism we were
assured&mdash;because a great number of influential people had
declared they were not Socialists, and it would be embarrassing for
them to contradict themselves&mdash;but it was to have the effect
of Socialism. There were to be worldwide labour laws, health laws,
protection of women and children, protection of races at a
disadvantage, throughout all the planet. Just how it was to be done
Dickon seemed to regard as an unimportant detail. He was too full
of the spirit for any such particularisation. He would do his job
of propaganda and preparation and the other fellows would do their
jobs. In that magic word Reconstruction there was no really
definite constructive idea at all, no taking apart and putting
together again, but instead there was undeniably an enormous amount
of what Americans call "uplift." Something was to be done, very
large, very generous, very beneficial and splendid; and that was
all it amounted it.</p>

<p>I write something was to be done, but now I come to consider it,
I believe that what we really thought was that something was going
to do itself. And we were to be its ministers and henchmen.</p>

<p>The Lytton Stracheys of 1990 or so may find in this Period of
Reconstruction material for much amusing writing. My own failure to
be thoroughly amused by it is due, I admit, to a want of humour. I
am still too close to it and its immense, if irrational,
disappointments. It was a movement of the extremest incoherence and
inconsistency. Men full of undisciplined individualism were rushing
about talking about collective effort and the subordination of
every enterprise to social ends. Men of the rankest patriotism were
rushing about talking of the League of Nations. Schemes for
re-housing the people of London in great and admirable buildings in
London jostled amicably with schemes for scattering the population
of London over the countryside. Everywhere beautiful houses were
promised for the populace, and nowhere did they appear. Also there
was to be a great exportation of the unemployed to the Colonies. On
scientific lines. And a colonisation of England that would render
emigration unnecessary. There were to be wonderful new high roads.
London was to have a railway clearing-house and save incalculable
acres of wasted building land. Civil air transport, moreover, was
to make both roads and railways superfluous. Productivity at the
touch of the new spirit of collective organisation was to leap up
like a man who has sat on a wasp. Everything was to fetch a good
stimulating price, but then wages would be enormous. Charing Cross
bridge was to be rebuilt very gloriously as a war monument, and
everybody was to go to school up to the age of sixteen. The output
of blue prints must have been enormous in those wonderful days. The
projects were upon every scale and with every amplitude of
scope.</p>

<p>Entangled with a number of self-mobilised business men and
jarring upon them every moment was a miscellany of young university
graduates, economists, sociologists, professors of political
science, very convinced and guiding and empty; and there were
temporary and permanent Civil Servants in the movement, all
mysteriously devious with the devious discretion of men who have to
think of their chiefs and their departments; and journalists and
novelists turned statesmen, making generous vacant phrases for us
in the utmost abundance; and inventors of this, that, and the other
implement for altering human life completely; and so down to pure
faddists and founts of richly printed matter with which one's
letter-box was choked, beings who filled the souls of men of
affairs with terror and contempt, and drove them back in panic from
their new viewpoints to their old business ways.</p>

<p>And the moral hotch-potch was just the same as the intellectual.
Mixed up with the entirely honest types like Dickon were the
complicated and half-honest; and about these again a considerable
crowd of adventurers who were not honest at all, who canted
reconstruction and presently canted de-control, and whose one
clearly apprehended reality in the pother was an opportunity to
snatch. Some of them snatched amazing handfuls. Though perhaps it
is not for me to complain of that, seeing the derelict Government
undertakings that have fallen back into the hands of Romer)
Steinhart, Crest and Co. and their associated enterprises.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-13" name="b3-13"></a>§ 13. THE ABORTIVE SPRING</h2>

<p class="first">THEN there came a chill. There is a book of
Tarde's called <i>Fragment d'histoire future</i>, which Mr.
Brereton has translated into English as <i>Underground Man</i>. It
describes the unexpected extinction of the sun. A sudden
extinction, like a gas-light being turned off. It is springtime in
France, the almond blossom has come, the birds are nesting, people
are going afield, when the catastrophe occurs. The sun rises
already shorn of its radiance, cools to a red orb at midday, is
dulled to a sullen coppery glow, and a snowstorm that grows thicker
and thicker fills the air, driven before a cold and devastating
wind. The young elder leaves, the almond petals whirl past and are
forgotten. Everyone is presently in flight for shelter and
searching frantically under cover for fuel. The icicles gather
along the eaves and fall clattering like broken glass before the
freezing gale. The plants bud no more, the birds sing no more, a
great darkness comes upon the world. Naturally those who have fuel
cling to the fuel. The quicker-witted start for the coal-mines and
begin to burrow down towards the central heat.</p>

<p>In much the same fashion did the hope of Reconstruction vanish
from the sky. Peace conditions had returned and the phase of ready
borrowing was at an end. The golden sun of credit veiled its
countenance. A heavy ground swell in the European currencies gave
place to a storm. The States had over-borrowed and mankind was
collectively in debt.</p>

<p>Even during the war the belligerent States had rarely dared to
take men's possessions outright. Lives and bodies they had taken
freely and recklessly, handing over millions of men like cattle to
their poor bluffing and blundering milItary chiefs to waste and
torture as their fear and folly determined, but the property of men
these Governments would not conscript. Because, you see, <i>human
society is a labour-imposing, labour-shifting, property-money
complex and life, the more or less of it, only an unpremeditated
by-product</i>. It ought not to be so, perhaps, but it is so. The
human complex has grown in that fashion according to its nature,
and it is not to be hastily and easily changed into some different
play of relationships.</p>

<p>When they might have taken the warring Governments had bought,
often at exorbitant prices, and they had borrowed to pay. The bills
of these usuries were now being presented. Dickon and I and a
number of others of us, business men first and money men
afterwards, went to and fro in the year of the Versailles
Conference, making a great noise about Reconstruction, putting
heart, temporary heart, into a multitude of depressed people; and
we no more realised what our real circumstances were than so many
bumble bees in a roomful of spiders' webs. But as the grey
filaments wrapped round us and wrapped round us, the note of our
buzzing and booming changed. Only those who have hard and vivid
memories know how much it changed. But it would be interesting to
take a newspaper of the year 1918, let us say, and another of 1924,
and count how often the words "Reconstruction" and "Debts" are to
be found in each.</p>

<p>The era of Reconstruction faded out, with practically nothing to
show for its enthusiasms; it gave place to the era of
Debt-collecting and what is apparently a strained and painful
attempt to restore the comparatively stable state of affairs that
had prevailed in the three or four decades before 1914. Finance and
the manipulation of money became the burden of life. The voice of
the "constructive" business man died away; nobody wanted to hear it
any more; he himself did not wish to hear it any more; and all the
world watched the quiet whispering goings to and fro of the bankers
and finance ministers.</p>

<p>But though debt and debt-collecting now dominated our thoughts,
I do not think that the rapid evaporation of human hope was
entirely due to the entanglements of finance. It was certainly not
due to any plotting and scheming and foresight on the part of the
financiers. No little, diabolically intelligent knot of men had
waited at the centre of the threads and said, "Patience! Presently
all these poor fools will be in our nets. Then we'll stop this
nonsense of hope."</p>

<p>Finance is not a malignant conspiracy; it is only a malignant
stupidity, a stupidity we all share actively or passively. It is a
persistent, timid adherence to conventions and methods that cannot
possibly work out beneficially for the mass of mankind. I have
lived near and in business and finance for a large part of my life,
and I here declare with the fullest deliberation that I do not
believe there are any men of supreme intellectual quality, good men
or bad men, now active in the world of finance. There are no doubt
many very energetic and quick-witted men, but their acquisitive
process is essentially automatic, arising out of the current
methods of monetary issue and credit. Every human being alive is
something of a toil-shifter, and happier in getting than in
yielding; most human beings have, in addition, a sneaking craving
for power and precedence over their fellows, and the weaknesses of
the system are found out by the pressure of these common
tendencies, quite mechanically, just as the weaknesses of an
embankment are found out by the weight of every particle of water
it restrains.</p>

<p>Dickon, as he saw his dream of heroic Reconstruction stained and
crumpled and spoilt and defeated, was disposed to be very fierce
about the Money Power. He would talk of the Money Power throttling
the Productive Power, and assert that at last all great
combinations of industrial plant fell into the uncreative grip of
the banks. He deplored his share in popularising loans when he
ought, he now declared, to have been explaining and steadying the
country under the "conscription of wealth." But I was never with
him in that direct antagonism between money and productive
organisation. Finance, I agreed, had sewn up the world in a shroud
of debts, but it did that almost as innocently as a blow-fly lays
eggs in a carcass. Without a carcass a blow-fly is a merely
secondary nuisance easily driven away. When you end litter you
abolish flies. Had there been sufficient constructive will and
knowledge in the world it would have made short work of that web of
debts, that enslavement of the world to the counting-house.</p>

<p>It became very plain to me as things went on that Dickon and I
were impractically vague in our intentions. Yet we two were among
the more clear-headed and capable of the active hopes of the
Reconstruction movement. He had considerable prestige as a
propagandist. I was a successful industrial organiser. Until we
came to this test we had neither of us realised that in practical
affairs we were mere fortunate amateurs following the inertias of
our early successes, and no longer in the habit of solving novel
problems. We were two samples of a body of perhaps a few hundred,
or at most a few thousand, would-be Reconstructors. All of us,
individually and collectively, were entirely inadequate to the task
we imagined we were attempting. Opportunity gleamed upon us
suddenly and found us unprepared&mdash;and passed.</p>

<p>How shallow was our conception of Reconstruction!&mdash;was
every conception of Reconstruction I ever encountered! To most of
the hopeful people of that time Reconstruction meant
simply&mdash;all they wanted&mdash;at once. Labour, for example,
demanded an immediate shortening of hours and a rise in wages, and
was blind to any necessity for intermediate phases or auxiliary
constructive effort. In England, trade after trade struck
vigorously, and got its advances, its eight hours' day, and crowded
off at once to see the cinemas and football matches, leaving the
working-out of the Millennium to anyone else who chose to bother.
Nobody chose to bother.</p>

<p>I do not blame labour; it acted according to its nature, just as
the creditors and investors acted according to their nature; but
the Reconstruction collapse was, I think, brought to a crisis quite
as much by the failure of labour to understand as by any exactions
and obstructions of finance. Neither the unhelpfulness of labour
nor of finance was the primary factor. The primary factor was that
the organising and administrative people like Dickon and myself,
men of concrete affairs as we professed to be, men who ought to
have known if anyone did, how to set about reconstructing things,
were caught without a scheme of action&mdash; without the ghost of
a scheme of action. We had no sense nor measure of what was
happening to us and the world. We ought to have known that labour
would be obdurate, and finance insist upon its pound of flesh at
any cost to the body politic. Labour always has been and always
will be unwilling, and creditors will cling to their claims and
have to be dIspossessed as firmly if as gently as possible, to the
very end of human existence.</p>

<p>We learnt our measure in those days. We were as planless as the
Bolsheviks in Russia. We were planless for exactly the same
reason&mdash;because there never had been any plan. There is no
plan. There is no Capitalist plan; there is no Communist plan.
There is no plan at all. We have traditions and usages on which we
innovate timidly, and they have the claptrap of Marx and Lenin.
Both capitalists in the West and the Bolsheviks in Russia
extemporise and experiment&mdash;with an air of knowing all about
what they are doing. We big business men had seemed to be running
the economic system in Britain, but, put to the trial, we showed we
had no power over it at all. Things had happened and we had
happened in consequence.</p>

<p>I do not see that we Western Reconstructors have much excuse for
looking down upon the Bolsheviks on the score of failure. They
failed to reconstruct from the ground upward amidst the ruins of
Russia, and they had a very bad famine and a series of foreign
raids to complicate the job for them. We in a shattered and
impoverished England failed just as much as they did. But since
everything was smashed in Russia before they took on the attempt at
reconstruction, their failure showed starkly. In the West nothing
was smashed, although everything was strained, and the social and
economic inertias carried us through. Our gestures and essays in
reconstruction were swept aside by the virtual resumption of the
old order, and there was no open revelation of futility. In March,
1925, under Mr. Baldwin&mdash;we seem almost back in March, 1914.
The difference between the failure of the constructive spirit in
Russia and in the West was the difference between a man on a desert
island where there is nothing to eat and a man on a walking tour in
France who finds he has forgotten to put food in his knapsack. Both
may have intended to be self-sufficient, but the former starves,
the latter takes refuge in an inn and says no more about it. He
eats his dinner and reads of the other fellow's death with a
feeling of superiority. But the money with which he pays may be
borrowed money, and financially his balance-sheet may be even worse
than that of the dead man. Debt is <i>not</i> so bad a thing as
death, but it lies in the same direction. It is a parallel road to
frustration.</p>

<p>There was no plan and there is no plan. When the restless,
inquiring minds among us have worked out the broad lines of a
plan&mdash;and that is being done now, and in a generation or so it
will be sufficiently worked out&mdash;when we have painted and
established upon the screen of the future the realities of human
possibility in terms that will convince and compel, then the real
Age of Reconstruction will have begun, and this queer phase of hope
and insufficiency that came to mankind in the beginning of the age
of confusion that followed the great war, will be recognised as the
first uneasy stirrings of the sleeping world-state before its
conclusive awakening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-14" name="b3-14"></a>§ 14. NORTHCLIFFE AS HERO</h2>

<p class="first">LOOKING back at it now, as it settles itself into
the general perspective view of our lives, I see that this effort,
this disappointment of the Reconstruction Period and the reaction
that followed, was a cardinal phase both for Dickon and myself; a
being born again or&mdash;a better image perhaps&mdash;a
coming-of-age. It is easier for me to see the change that happened
to Dickon than to trace it in my own case. So far as one's own self
is concerned, when one gains new perspectives and gets one's
conception of things expanded and cleared, the new vision is apt to
swallow up the old, and so one forgets one's earlier limitations.
But I remember Dickon before the war as fragmentary and dogmatic
and instinctive, in comparison with his more recent self. He took
the world for granted then, he took it as established and in all
its broader aspects beyond his control. The stress, excitement,
hope, and frustrations of the last ten years have pulled him
together.</p>

<p>Before the war I was a revolutionary, a theoretical
revolutionary, decidedly unreal and amateurish in my views, and he
was not. My insistence upon change and the need to change, such as
it was before the war, he was always putting aside until to-morrow.
It was interesting but impracticable; it was Utopian; he lived for
the world as it was. But after the reconstruction effort, and
particularly after the death of Minnie, he changed&mdash;almost
fundamentally. The world had hitherto been open to criticism
indeed, but good enough for him. He could still take a baronetcy in
1919. He is no longer like that.</p>

<p>The war was the beginning of this new birth, but like so many
violent accidents, its real quality and consequences were masked by
the immediate shock. Even now they are only beginning to come
through.</p>

<p>It is curious how irrelevant the actual details of the war seem
to be now, and how enormous the effects we begin to realise. I
could tell a hundred stories of the war, of our special
productions, of hunts for raw material, of ingenious substitutions,
of our tragic explosion at Lembury, of our replacement of men by
women workers, and how good the first lot were and how bad all the
others, of the spies we suspected and the spies we had, of our
poison-gas work, and of how we sank a hundred tons of that filth in
the North Sea after the war was all over, because there was nothing
else to do with it&mdash;stories interesting enough in themselves
but of no wide significance in my world now, even to me.</p>

<p>Nor do the accounts of the air-raids we stood, the persistent
attempts of the German raiders to localise our works and
particularly the plant at Downs-Peabody, seem to matter very much
now. One moonlit night of crashes and vast silences, in a wide
empty street near Victoria, I came upon a man clinging to a railing
and mooing like a cow, and his intestines protruded from his
waistcoat; he had just been torn open by anti-aircraft shrapnel; I
made up a bed for him with some cushions I borrowed and went off
into the wilderness of Pimlico to find an ambulance, and when I got
back he had disappeared and nobody knew what had become of
him&mdash;or the cushions: I had to pay for the cushions; and I was
dining not a hundred yards from Buckingham Palace with Stetson
during an air-raid when a naval shell, which happily proved a dud,
I suppose from some boat in the Thames, danced in from somewhere at
the back, made a vast smash of falling brickwork and broken
window-frames, and came to rest among the hats and umbrellas in the
hall without injuring a soul; but these things are now like
something seen in a show or dreamt or read about. They join on to
nothing. They are like travel snap-shots or like the promiscuous
collections of picture postcards my nephew Dick used to make when
he was a very little boy. They call for no more than a passing
allusion here. What is of infinitely more moment is the revelation
that they brought home to us of the undirected instability of the
world's affairs, the realisation that we were not mere passengers
but as much responsible navigators upon the ship of human destiny
as anyone.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1920 Dickon and I had a long discussion. We had
indeed several, we were much together at that time, but it will
suit my purpose best to concentrate the substance of it all into
one conversation. It crystallised out a number of ideas that I had
had in solution for some time. That week or so of discussion marks
the establishment of the new phase, the definitive phase, of our
attitude to life. I find as I recall it, already well in evidence,
the embryonic but recognisable form of that revolutionary project
which :it is the main object of this book to state, and to which I
shall come after our own story has been sufficiently told.</p>

<p>It was influenza that had thrown us so much together, and fever
maybe quickened our ideas. It was in the early days of the Bordon
Street Chambers. Deland, to whom we were a great find, could not do
enough for us. The influenza of that year was rather more feverish
and bronchial than the current one and a little more prone to
unfavourable developments. Deland would permit us to take no risks.
We sat indoors of an evening, and before us was a big copper kettle
steaming on a bright coal fire. We had screens about us, screens
that Deland had insisted upon, and we drank hot whisky and Dickon
opened his thoughts to me abundantly and frankly.</p>

<p>He certainly said or implied most of the things I am now going
to make him say.</p>

<p>I remember him sitting in the low armchair, in a blue
dressing-gown under a shaded light, that made his head by contrast
look like a great orange, ruffled by eyebrows and split by a
smiling mouth below, and with the unusual trick of producing two
level blue eyes from below the eyebrows at salient points of the
conversation, and I remember, too, that he grunted more than
usually when he moved. At his elbow Deland had put a low table and
the tray and all our convivial material. And his discourse, which
arose out of his complete admission of the failure of the
Reconstruction Movement, went in this fashion:</p>

<p>"Addison"&mdash;Dr. Addison was the Minister of Health
then&mdash;"won't get his half-million new houses; he won't get
sixty thousand, and Fisher"&mdash;the Right Honourable H.A.L.
Fisher was to have been the great light of a better
education&mdash;"won't get the school-leaving age raised to
sixteen. That's all as dead as mutton now, Billy. Addison may make
some sort of fight for it, but it won't be any good, and Fisher
will let it go because he's that sort of a chap. Then it's ages
since we heard a word about that State-controlled milk-trade which
was going to save ten thousand babies a year, and your people and
people like you are going to take over those national factories
that Chiozza Money said inaugurated a new economic system, take
them over at scrapping prices, and run them on strictly
profiteering lines. Oh! I've been watching you, Billy. Well,
perhaps not strictly profiteering. Business lines. I've been
watching you and I've been watching Brampsheet follow his nose.
What a nose he has! And it's true there's no one else to run them.
No one. But the mines are different. That's not true about the
mines. Nothing is going to be done about the mines either. That's a
clear miss. The mine-owners are mucking along in the dear old
fashion in spite of the Sankey Report&mdash;and elementary common
sense. Public health is as you were, or a bit worse, and nobody
will get anything much done except the money-bugs. And so we go on.
Reconstruction was quack medicine, and Lloyd George is a liar, and
here we are bilked and done."</p>

<p>"And men of our age," I probably remarked, "ought never to have
believed that anything else was possible."</p>

<p>Dickon reflected over his tray.</p>

<p>"And yet, for all that, there is a lot in this idea of
Reconstruction," he said. "I've acquired that idea of
Reconstruction for good. It's like being vaccinated."</p>

<p>Some sound of guarded assent from me.</p>

<p>"Bigger job than we thought it was," said Dickon, shaving
delicately at the lemon peel with the razor Deland had brought for
the purpose.</p>

<p>"We aren't going to make over this old muddle of a :world yet
for a bit," he said, and cut a translucent slice and rejected a pip
fastidiously. "I shall leave you to put the sugar, Bill.... No....
But it's been a lesson." He completed his duties as host.</p>

<p>He made a compelling gesture towards me with the open razor to
hold my attention until he began. Then he composed himself to
talk.</p>

<p>"I perceive, Billy, that this little old world of ours has been
ready and asking for a revolution, a complete and thorough
revolution, for three years. Three years. Since about the middle of
1918. The market was ready, the demand there&mdash;and no supply.
What has been missing has been somebody to know what was wanted and
able to produce it. The world had its mouth open. It was scared
tame. Lord! Billy, how funny all this is really. The expectation!
The result! That solemn goose of a Wilson laying his addled egg in
Paris. Day by day, each day a little more of it out. Mankind
awe-stricken. Go on, Great President! Go on! And the
Bolsheviks&mdash;Not even an egg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sought for an image.</p>

<p>"Making a mess," I suggested hastily.</p>

<p>"Making a mess&mdash;a little weak mess&mdash;in the middle of
the remains of Russia."</p>

<p>He shook his head at the fire. "Tremendous pause. Mankind
puzzled. 'That is all, gentlemen. No, there is nothing more;
nothing more at all!' And then presently the old things, the dreary
things, the slow and pompous things, the shams, the vested
interests and the ancient rights, the kings that mean nothing and
the uniforms that mean nothing, come crawling out of their shelters
and hiding-places, scarcely able to believe they are still alive.
As they are, Billy. As they are! .</p>

<p>"Yet there <i>was</i> that pause," said Dickon. "There was a
time when the door stood open."</p>

<p>He surveyed history at large. "I suppose there never has been
much imaginative greatness in the handling of human affairs. The
greatest of men is still an ape&mdash;what was
it?&mdash;'imperfectly depiled.' Good phrase that! All damned
nonsense about the dignity of history. Dignity hasn't begun yet.
We've had great figures stuck up for us. Caesar and Marcus
Aurelius. Really no better than Winston or Wilson. It's always been
this sort of thing really&mdash;or worse?"</p>

<p>Dickon returned to his main discovery. "These have been
extraordinary years. If there had been a clear project ready and
men to put it over, it could have been put over. It was the
psychological moment for a great change.... I for one thought there
was going to be a really great change. A new age. Here and now,
Billy. We seemed to see the promised land. And now where is it?"
'</p>

<p>"But isn't there something still to be done?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Dickon, and added&mdash;as though he</p>

<p>poised the name in his hand&mdash; "there's Northcliffe."</p>

<p>"Northcliffe!" said I, and sat amazed.</p>

<p>Then I reflected that Dickon saw all the universe through a haze
of publicity. Hadn't he called the temples of the world God's
advertisements?</p>

<p>He began to talk about that great newspaper adventurer in tones
of affectionate perplexity. In some obscure extensive way outside
my sympathies, Northcliffe had taken a very steady grip upon
Dickon's imagination. He had become more than himself for Dickon;
he had become a symbol for forces Dickon partly apprehended and
partly hoped for in the world about us. He spoke of the "New Men,"
the "New Adventurers," and at a scrutiny of these phrases he always
fell back on Northcliffe. Northcliffe was still the master of
<i>The Times</i> then and of a powerful group of newspapers, but
for a year or so he had been making a poor figure in the world's
eyes on account of his concentration upon a bitter personal feud
between himself and Lloyd George. This after clambering
courageously through a phase of great unpopularity to a commanding
influence in national affairs. His war services had been enormous
and on the whole sound. There was a story that Lloyd George had led
him to hope he might go to the Versailles Conference and had then
disappointed him. At any rate, Northcliffe had behaved like one who
had been stung by an intolerable treachery. For a time his
conspicuous vindictive resentment had robbed him of any largeness
of effect. It had disappointed and estranged many who like Dickon
had hoped for great things from him. But Dickon stuck to him. "He
is a big man," said Dickon stoutly, "he is a big man."</p>

<p>Northcliffe, said Dickon, had never known what a big man he was
going to be until his greatness was upon him. Opportunity had taken
him by surprise. As it takes most successes nowadays by surprise.
He had found himself powerful before he had had time to turn round
and realise ,what he wanted to do.</p>

<p>"That's more or less the history of all our sort," said Dickon.
"We strive with all our little mights&mdash;just to get freedom,
just to get out of the ruck&mdash;and what we thought was a wall of
stone and iron turns out to be cardboard and <i>phut</i> it goes,
and we find ourselves right through, with power in our hands and
nothing in the whole universe between us and the ironical eye of
God."</p>

<p>"Mr. G.," I said.</p>

<p>"God I mean in this case," said Dickon.</p>

<p>He sketched out the adventure of the Harmsworths.</p>

<p>The father was an Irish barrister who had come to London and
been called to the English Bar, and who had died before success
could be won there. He seems to have been an able man who died too
soon, with a restless, ambitious, stimulating home and a wise,
strong, patient wife. His chief delight, I have been told, was to
speechify in a mock Parliament in some Camden Town tavern. From
that he hoped perhaps to clamber to the other mockery at
Westminster. Alfred, the son, went to a little private school in
St. John's Wood, and began a journalistic career with a
jelly-graphed school magazine. The schoolmaster knew how to seize
an aptitude and develop it, and he promoted Harmsworth's purple
smudgings to the dignity of print and periodicity.</p>

<p>"I've seen some numbers, Dickon. "It was pretty common stuff;
cricket scores and school news and so forth. Northcliffe never
wrote a distinguished line in his life.... Well&mdash;writing
distinguished lines isn't everything. Though, of course, it
helps."</p>

<p>While still in his teens, young Harmsworth launched out with a
weekly paper called <i>Answers</i>. Then came some awful things for
errand boys and the cheapest public, <i>Comic Cuts</i>, that crying
outrage. "Great money makers, I'm told," said Dickon.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> followed and was a brilliant success. The
world became aware of a personality different from the ordinary
newspaper personality, an influence and an energy. Then carne
opportunity, and this Harmsworth of <i>Comic Cuts</i> secured a
controlling interest in <i>The Times</i> and became a power,
presently a very considerable power. The peerages of himself and
his brother were formal recognitions of his substantial success.
Northcliffe and Rothermere became the golden flowers on the stem of
Harmsworth Brothers. He pushed forward to something like a
commanding position in the country among the uncertainties,
hesitations, and novel occasions of the war.</p>

<p>"It makes our little rush up look quite a gentle ascent," said
Dickon.</p>

<p>Dickon had become associated with Northcliffe during his
propaganda activities. There was a real liking between them. "He's
got imagination, real imagination, the quality that makes a great
man, Billy; almost the only man he is with a touch of greatness in
our public affairs. The <i>only</i> one."</p>

<p>"You don't think there's something great about such a type as
Arthur Balfour?" said I.</p>

<p>"That damned Madonna lily!" said Dickon. "He grows where he's
planted," and came back without further comment to Northcliffe.</p>

<p>"He knows that we are a new sort of men, and that this is an age
of new things. He knows there is the possibility of great
reconstructions in the air. He's not clear about it, but he feels
it. He's alive to it. He's not afraid to change the world. That's
what makes him signify, Billy."</p>

<p>Dickon gave me a little vignette of Northcliffe and himself
sitting in a room in Crewe House, a fine town-house of the old
regime that had been requisitioned for propaganda headquarters
against the Austrians and Germans, an easy spacious town-house with
a garden of its own up behind Shepherd's Market in the heart of the
West-end, full of eighteenth-century dignity and eighteenth-century
furniture. "They talk of revolutions," Northcliffe had remarked in
that soft whispering voice of his. "Our being here <i>is</i> a
revolution."</p>

<p>"That," said Dickon, "is Northcliffe near his top note. A bit
exalted. None the worse for that. But seeing things. Seeing
changes. Seeing forces."</p>

<p>He leant forward, poked the fire, and spread his amplitudes
before the blaze. "In a sense," said Dickon, "it was true. In a
sense&mdash;it was nonsense.</p>

<p>"Potential revolution," said Dickon. "There I agree."</p>

<p>He frowned; he shook his elder-brother finger at me and frowned.
"There is something wrong about Northcliffe, Billy. Something
grotesque and tragic. Like a string that jerks him back."</p>

<p>The man, he said, had moods, alternations of moods that went
beyond the limits of sanity. At times he had to go away and hide
from everything. He would fly off to his wonderful old mother at
Totteridge. His brothers, his secretaries and subordinates took
charge. Dickon knew of these dark interludes already three years
before Northcliffe died insane. But all through Northcliffe's life
was a succession of moods and phases&mdash;vast inequalities. His
boldness, his vision, seemed to come in phases and vanish again.
Sometimes he had the assurance of immense power&mdash;"and it's
there for his using," said Dickon&mdash;and at others he was just
vain and empty, in the air, "posturing or frightened, fat and
frightened, and no sort of good at all."</p>

<p>Dickon shrugged his shoulders. "And there you have in his
hands&mdash;with no-one really able to control him, a gigantic
Publicity, the supreme power still in modern life. Yes, Billy,
there is no power now, none in all the world, like the power to
speak plainly and uninterruptedly to the crowd. My God! the power
he and the other big newspaper people could exercise even now, if
they chose to take it up and use it. Even now&mdash;still
to-day&mdash;the empire and the world are absolutely in the hands
of the big press owners and the new men they ought to work with.
This is their time of opportunity. The situation stiffens; it
stiffens every day, but it hasn't congealed yet. There may be years
yet before it has completely congealed."</p>

<p>A note of lamentation crept into his voice. "Not twenty men," he
said. "And nine-tenths of the British newspaper sales in their
hands. And all concentrated in London, not scattered like the
American papers in a score of places. They might march this country
wherever they chose and the rest of the world would follow. If they
had the dignity of their power. Who could stop them? How could you
stop them?"</p>

<p>But they drifted. They achieved nothing except great, clumsy,
overwhelming fortunes. Opportunity was a touchy visitor if you
didn't go down at once to receive her. Northcliffe felt that, but
the others didn't. That was where he was different.</p>

<p>I suggested that Dickon over-estimated the strength of these
newspaper proprietors. They would lose circulation at once if they
tried to put big things over. Dickon was convinced they would not.
"The public likes initiative," he dogmatised. "Wants it. And
besides, altogether, they control the paper supply and
distribution. And there's still no one yet with the courage and
decision to stand up against them if they chose to begin!"</p>

<p>And even if the public didn't like them it would have to stand
them, now. Who would they lose circulation <i>to</i>? The public
must have some sort of paper. No other sort of paper was possible
at the present time. These press barons had the power surely
enough. But they had no common idea. They had no idea of
themselves. And the power slipped away from them. It was like that
moment when Wat Tyler, the Kentish rebel, was killed. The crowd
stood irresolute. There was the Press, as the prince had been,
mounted and in full view, capable of saying what it chose to say
and take control. And there it was with nothing to
say&mdash;exposed in that expectant silence.</p>

<p>"These men," he remarked, "carne up by being new. If they stop
being new, they fall back into a position of subordination to the
old gang, and cease to matter. They amalgamate with the old crowd
and are lost.... They don't know their opportunities. They are
afraid of their opportunities. Too big for them.... Except possibly
Northcliffe. I'm not so sure of Northcliffe."</p>

<p>Dickon made a gesture of despair and dismissal, with a glass
that was fortunately nearly empty.</p>

<p>"They could say what they like," he said, "even now. The whole
world still listens for an idea."</p>

<p>He went on to a general review, an irritated, exaggerated,
influenza-touched review, of what he called the new forces in
English affairs: "The men like us." Those new forces had never
realised their quality and their outlook. That was our trouble. No
mental synthesis, no clear understanding was there.</p>

<p>I give Dickon's views as well as I can. They are not precisely
my views, but they are the brothers of my views. He saw things from
the angle of a great advertiser, he overvalued the conspicuous, and
his choice of new men was very different from mine. But I do not
remember that I argued :with him that night. I let him cite his own
cases.</p>

<p>Lloyd George, Dickon insisted, was one of the "new forces." In
1920, certainly, he was still a very big figure. "In politics he's
just what I am in advertisement, and Northcliffe is in journalism,
and you in metallurgy&mdash;a new sort of man with new scale
methods." None of us could have existed in 1880, neither Lloyd
George nor Northcliffe, nor ourselves, nor any of the prominent men
of the day under sixty. Asquith and Balfour and Grey were by
comparison just dignified statesmen in the Victorian tradition.
They had learnt to be British statesmen at the Universities under
the best tutors. They were incapable of freshness or adaptation.
"Locums," said Dickon. They had been pushed aside for a time, and
all their type and tradition could still be thrust aside. Thrust
aside for good. An active figure like Lloyd George made them look
like historical monuments.</p>

<p>But in Lloyd George also there was something that made for
futility. "He's just a magnificent weed. In flower. Where one might
have a great tree. He lives from hand to mouth. He's as clever as
six foxes. Sane&mdash;too sane. Meanly sane. What's the matter with
him? Just the opposite of Northcliffe. No end of cool, clear
brains, but they don't seem to be in the right place or the right
way up, or something. No length of vision. No imaginative warmth.
There Northcliffe has the pull of him. And Lloyd George can't wait.
You must have long views before you can wait. Temperamentally he
can't wait. And he's broken with Northcliffe. He ought to have let
Northcliffe take a hand in the Government and sent him to Paris. It
might have changed the course of history if Northcliffe had gone to
Paris.</p>

<p>"But, of course, the Paris show was too big a temptation for
George, just as it was too big a temptation for Wilson.</p>

<p>"And here we are!" said Dickon.</p>

<p>He passed the other great powers of the British newspaper world
in review and dismissed them all. Imaginative insufficiency. They
could do SO much if they chose. And they did not choose.</p>

<p>"Riddell&mdash;a clever man. A cynic. Laughs at his peerage.
What is he after in life? Beaverbrook? He has as much brains and
imagination as anyone. But&mdash;he's impish." Where Northcliffe
was disposed to be grandiose. "Northcliffe," said Dickon again,
"that's the <i>big</i> man." Beaverbrook was devoted to Bonar
Law&mdash; they came from the same Canadian village, Dickon
believed&mdash;and he meant to make his friend Prime Minister.
"Possibly he will. And beyond that, so far as I can see, he regards
the world as a playground, and isn't quite sure of his fun. Eager,
feverishly eager, to be all alIve, and no idea what life is. Will
he ever grow up? If he grew up.... He's young still."</p>

<p>Dickon turned away from that.</p>

<p>Lord Burnham of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> was a good sort, with
a greater sense of public obligation than the others. But no inner
light, no drive, and no desire. His idea of a newspaper, a pillar
instead of a power.</p>

<p>"Lords of Journalism," said Dickon. "Newspaper nobles."</p>

<p>Scott of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> was a star apart. "But
you can't do very much as a star apart," said Dickon. "Twinkling is
good enough for him. He doesn't <i>want</i> to do." The
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> and the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> of
Milan were after their fashion the two finest newspapers in the
world, but anything might happen to them at any time because of
their isolation. So Dickon prophesied in 1920. For the
<i>Corriere</i> now it is prophecy no longer.</p>

<p>Dickon sees as drama what I see as process. He sees it as a
drama of publicity. What is not seen and known by the public is not
reality for him. That night he reviewed our political world
entirely as a display of these newspaper adventurers and "new men"
of his&mdash;Lord Birkenhead, with his careless freedom of word and
act, and Lord Reading, who was Rufus Isaacs, almost as "new" in
type, he held, as Lloyd George or Northcliffe&mdash;and he declared
that only a realisation of their common interest in a boldly
reconstructed political and social order could prolong and
stabilise their adventure. The old things were biding their time,
reaction impended, and these new men were attacking and undermining
each other, doing nothing revolutionary, and letting the weeks and
months slip by. They did not seem to think they had anything to
fear from the old conservatives. "Wait," said Dickon. "I've seen
and heard a thing or two."</p>

<p>He made me realise the latent power of what he called the "old
gang" in things British and American, less audible, less brilliant,
slow and tenacious, the old gang of long-established property, of
banking and rent, the implacable gold standard and the unwearying
creditor, the old gang who want nothing more to happen for ever. He
made an acute guess that found its confirmation in the General
Election of 1924, when almost all the residue of his "new men,"
battling one against the other, were swept away or driven into
secondary positions. The chill of the coming day when Mr. Asquith
would become an earl and a Knight of the Garter, Lord Birkenhead a
minister-journalist, and Lloyd George a comparative nobody was upon
him. Though he foresaw the coming phase of reaction, he was not yet
reconciled to its inevitability. He still clung doubtfully to his
hero, Northcliffe, a loyalty that was so soon to be shattered by a
pitiful death.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-15" name="b3-15"></a>§ 15. NEW SORT OF MAN
WANTED</h2>

<p class="first">THE fever and the whisky and the quinine that were
working together in Dickon's blood that night seemed only to give
his mind a wider sweep. He generalised with unusual freedom. He
expanded his discourse upon British affairs, until it became an
exposition of a worldwide struggle to re-make. He saw that struggle
everywhere as a triangular conflict. First there were these "new
men" of his, the Sons of Light, still uncertain in their quality;
and next there were the "haves," the holders, the creditors, the
financiers, the antagonists weaving the nets about these
extraordinary Sons of Light he had chosen and thirdly there were
the have-nots," labour that would not labour, that did not want
anything that anybody else wanted, but did not know what it wanted,
the retrogressive obstruction, the massive veto, the eating,
breeding crowd.</p>

<p>We two had grown up in an age of rapid progress, and :We were
too much disposed to take progressive change as the natural order
of the world. We were only beginning to realise that the rush of
progress had brought also a stimulation of the defensive, a
strengthening of the resistances that protected established things.
The forces that had been disturbing and enlarging the scale of
human affairs for four or five generations might have exhausted
themselves in the catastrophe of the Great War. "Crashed," said
Dickon. It was an unpalatable line of thought for him, but he
followed it manfully for some time. The owner was resuming his
loosened grip everywhere; the creditor was recovering from his
earlier dismay and confusion, and there was no residue of creative
force to resist his return.</p>

<p>Perhaps we were in for a phase first of stagnation and then of
retrogression. It was, yes, it was possible. It might last as long
as the forward rush and undo much of its achievement. The
conservative forces wanted, indeed, only to fix and retain; they
were as unwilling to go back as to go forward, but you cannot fix
and retain without stagnation, you cannot have stagnation without
decay, and you cannot have decay without disorder. For a whIle
Dickon was morbid. Life asserts itself in the unused organ as
putrefaction or cancer. Decay meant conflict even more certainly
than did such an excess of energy as had led to the Great War. But
the conflicts of a phase of decay had not even breadth of motive.
The creditor, the property-owner, might avert the confiscations of
a creative revolution, but at the price of reviving the brigand.
"That begins already in Italy," said Dickon. China, India, had
passed through "ages of confusion." Why should not our Western
world do the like? Why should there be any recovery at all in human
affairs?</p>

<p>But this was too depressing for Dickon's temperament. I have
never known him keep a purely pessimistic poise for long, and
presently he was saying that the real age of
Reconstruction&mdash;which he had tacitly restored to the scheme of
things&mdash;might still be centuries away. To talk of the world
not really going forward was for him just talking;' it signified
nothing at all&mdash;a polite gesture to the insanities of
possibility. Wasn't he himself going forward?...</p>

<p>He sat staring into the glowing coals.</p>

<p>The influenza germ reasserted itself.</p>

<p>"Unless you have men to tell people how things stand and what
they have to do&mdash;&mdash;" he said, and broke off.</p>

<p>"Where are the other men to be looked for?" he said. "Where
shall we find the new forces? Perhaps this is naturally a
conservative and creditor country. But&mdash;for
example&mdash;America?"</p>

<p>He returned to his main hope. "Northcliffe is talking of going
round the world," he said. "I wonder if he will. He seems to have
this same feeling we have that a big reconstruction is due.
Somewhere that isn't perhaps London or England. He wants to look
for it. He talks of greater Britain, of the Empire. I wonder if
that's it. I wonder what he will find if he does go round the
world. I wonder what he expects to find. Banquets he will get
everywhere. Flattery. Immense publicity. No rest. No thought. But
his instinct is sound. That man, Billy, is like a big lonely wasp
at a grocer's window pane. He knows there is something important to
him behind it, but he doesn't seem able to get through. He tries to
find a way. Perhaps he will never get through."</p>

<p>He never did get through. Two years later that poor giant with
the feet of clay, that great vulgar man of energy whom Dickon had
idealised to the level of genius, went round the world even as he
had proposed. His progress is to be found recorded with a straining
amplitude in the files of his <i>Times</i>, and as he journeyed his
exorbitant brain glowed and became more and more confused. The
problem was too vast for him, he was too utterly uneducated, he
staggered with a fundamental instability. His desire to do great
things in the world gave place to alternations of childish grandeur
and frantic suspicion. The little folks about him whispered and
soothed him and tried to put as seemly a face as possible upon the
dismal business, and then presently, close home again in Germany,
suddenly he became hopelessly mad and violent and was overcome and
restrained and passed altogether out of the comity of men.</p>

<p>I doubt the reach and power of imagination that Dickon ascribed
to him. But I agree that there was greatness in him and that his
story is a tragic one and his destruction a loss to the world. And
I agree, too, that he did embody forces that are still operating
largely about us.</p>

<p>From his exposition of Northcliffe, Dickon began in a large
febrile way to seek through all our world for what he called
"creative far-reaching men." The world needed them; the world was
ripe for them; these "new men" of to-day were only the precursors
of the men who had to come. To him it seemed essential that they
should appeal to a great multitude of hearers, be audible to the
ends of the earth. Until a thing had been put through to the
multitude and had taken hold of the multitude, it had not, from his
point of view, been done. From the very nature of the case it was
manifest that the primary thing in the career of these redeeming
advertisers would be that we should know about them. And we did not
know about them.</p>

<p>For a time he discussed the American publicity people and such
great newspaper men as Hearst and the Pulitzers. From that he
spread out upon a general comparison of English and American. "I've
met Hearst," he said, "as often as I've met Rothermere; I've spent
days with both the Pulitzers, and do I begin to know anything about
them? No. I've not the faintest idea of what they are up to, or
what they <i>think</i> they are up to. Billy, why are Americans,
all Americans, Americans without exception, such mysteries to us?
European race. More often than not <i>our</i> race. Our language.
Conditions after all very like ours. A bigger country, of course. A
different pace. Difference of phase. But while you seem to get
Englishmen and Frenchmen all round and through and through, half an
American is in a loud glare and the other half is darkness. It's
like seeing things by the beam of a searchlight after you have been
seeing them in a light that is soft and grey and generally
diffused.</p>

<p>"That's it, perhaps, Billy. A profound difference in their
publicity, using publicity in its widest sense. From the way that a
child gets looked at and talked about, onward. They're lit up
differently, inside and out. And what is life but a consequence of
illumination? When you go to America and see headlines and
interviews with a girl about her engagement, or with a professor
about his resignation, you at first say, 'Good God. There's no
privacy here at all!' And then you discover that outside that
crude, cheap, hasty, flat, misleading lighting-up of salient
objects and events, there's abysses of darkness, immense pits where
much goes on and nothing is exposed&mdash;and people, rich people
especially, unobserved in them and doing the most extraordinary
things.</p>

<p>"In Europe a man may have a private life, yes, but in America he
has a secret life, lit by sudden shouting judgments and flashes of
journalistic lightning. In which you get an impression&mdash;vivid
enough but wrong. Things about him that would be plain here are
invisible there, even to himself. And other things come out with a
kind of scream, all out of proportion by our standards. It's
because of that, Billy, that to our European senses Americans never
seem quite real. The quality of the exposure, the method of
illumination to which they have had to adapt themselves, account
for nearly everything between us. That sort of watchful reserve
they have, mixed up with a desire to make general, over-simplified
explanations of themselves. The queerness of these greyish-faced,
slow-speaking Americans in grey, who watch your face as they talk
to you! If the searchlight jumps round upon them they are ready all
the time. They talk about themselves as we never do. They try and
hide their nakedness behind autobiographical statements. They
instance themselves as types. They snatch suddenly at your verdict
upon them. They have none of our sense of sustained scrutinies and
slowly maturing judgments; none at all."</p>

<p>Was there any such gathering and influential body of men and
women in America set upon Reconstruction as we two were set upon
Reconstruction?</p>

<p>"Allowing for all the differences in pace and phase," he said,
"the fact remains that we and they are going along the same road in
the same direction." The need for a great reconstruction was common
now to all the world; there were only these differences in phase.
Business had grown there faster and bigger than it had grown here,
and their banking was rapidly overshadowing ours. They were bound
to lead the world's affairs for a time. But how far were they able
to keep the lead or do anything with it?</p>

<p>He sized up the prospects of a world under American leadership.
Were the Americans producing an American mind that would be
large-thinking and powerful enough for the whole world? In certain
things they were broader-minded than Europeans. The United States
had always been more curious and intelligent about China and
Eastern Asia, for example, and more restrained in its imperialism.
It had been far ahead of the European intelligence in its grasp of
the importance of a properly regulated currency and credit system
to economic life. It had got currency into politics long before
Europe suspected there was such a thing as a currency riddle. But,
nevertheless, it was shallow. All its energy&mdash;and its energy
was tremendous&mdash;seemed to be on the surface. Woodrow Wilson
was typical of the American quality that perplexed us. The idea of
some great settlement of world affairs, some world peace
organisation, was magnificent. Quite beyond the scope of the
European outlook or the compass of European statesmanship. One saw
the United States leading the world into a new age. Then for the
realisation of that vision, the Fourteen Points, as trite and
superficial as a magazine article.</p>

<p>And after that&mdash;America the Creditor.</p>

<p>"And while we sit here asking, 'Can the Americans develop a
world mind and lead the world?' there may be just such another pair
of brothers as we are, Billy, in Indianapolis or Chicago saying,
'Why don't the Europeans show a sign of a world mind?' I believe
our sort of ideas are fermenting in the world everywhere. We're not
such original chaps as to be very far from the general trail. What
brings us here will bring others here. And Americans most of
all....</p>

<p>"It's just that we don't know about them. They aren't talking
yet....</p>

<p>"This new reconstructed world, Billy, is like a big dragon-fly
jerking itself bit by bit out of its larval skin. Jerking and then
resting. It's wet and quiet just now, a little disposed to quiver,
making no noise, but it's nearly here; it's almost out; it's coming
on."</p>

<p>"And presently, all at once, it will spread out its wings and
buzz," I said.</p>

<p>"And then we shall know about it."</p>

<p>He looked at me with that queer experimental expression of his,
like a small boy who has given his little brother a dose and does
not quite know how it will agree with him or he with it. I looked
back at him and laughed. "You'd like to be sure."</p>

<p>"There is a lot in what your friends the Communists call the
economic interpretation of history," said Dickon. "If material
needs make political and social forms, then big business and
international finance will presently develop a soul of its own,
become really conscious of itself and make itself known to the
world. The same experiences will beget the same ideas. There must
be fellows not only in America but Germany and France who are
getting, as we are getting, towards their idea of positively making
a new world system&mdash;not letting it happen merely, but making
it happen."</p>

<p>Dickon reflected. "China? Japan? India? It can't be all aimless
mooning. Here two or three are talking, there some one is writing.
Convergent thoughts perhaps. Surely convergent. Every day there
must be some one pushing the new ideas just a little further,
clearing up, rounding off, maturing, making possible and
practicable. That is the real Reconstruction. But for the world in
general they are still inaudible, smothering, unable to speak out
yet within the swelling, uncomfortable old institutions. Then some
one says something, definite effort is started, the trouble
begins."</p>

<p>He paused, a little troubled by his growing and distending
metaphor. He was always begetting these metaphors and finding them
too much for him.</p>

<p>"Then is the time for the man-midwife," I suggested, "the
propagandist, the advertiser, to set about his task, and bring the
new order into the world."</p>

<p>As we talked we replenished our glasses with a reasonable
moderation from the decanter and the kettle on the hob, and I think
we talked on at last partly because the influenza made us feel as
physically lazy as we were mentally flushed, and disinclined us for
the little effort needed to get ourselves from the fireside to our
waiting hot-water bottles. And it was interesting to have my
brother spreading out his general ideas to me again after so many
years. It was interesting to see how close he had come to certain
speculations of my own.</p>

<p>At last the little clock upon the mantelshelf pinged one o'clock
in the morning, and Deland, whom we had supposed asleep, coughed
rather markedly in the passage. He would not go to bed before his
precious charges were safely tucked away.</p>

<p>Dickon stood up, a great bulk, and stretched out his freckled
fists.</p>

<p>"That whisky and the talk have done me good, Billy. Well, the
Reconstruction of the world is going to be a long job&mdash;but
it's going to be done. Even if <i>we</i> die futile. The present
muddle isn't going on for ever.... Reconstructing the world. It's
interesting. And besides, Lord! <i>what else is there to do with
life</i>?"</p>

<p>He drooped and stood with his hands in his pockets staring at
the fire.</p>

<p>"Minnie. And the children married and scattered. It's passed
like a dream."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-16" name="b3-16"></a>§ 16. VISHNU, SIVA, AND
BRAHMA</h2>

<p class="first">SO, in effect, Dickon talked and thought four
years ago&mdash;nearly five years now.</p>

<p>I think it was Dickon who first hit upon the image of Vishnu,
Siva, and Brahma, the Indian triad of fundamental gods, to express
the main forces in the world about us. We found that a very happy
symbolism for our ideas. Neither of us can stand a dualism in
politics or social life, a mere antagonism of the ins and the outs,
the haves and the have-nots. Both of us have an instinctive hatred
of eternal rhythms. Dickon, even more than I, insisted upon the
triangularity of human affairs. The war of Vishnu, the stubborn
conservative, against Siva, the democratic destroyer who ploughs up
and inundates, would mean only a dreary alternation of dullness and
catastrophe, if it were <i>not</i> for Brahma the inventor, the
creative spirit, for whom politics has so rarely found expression.
He is the innovating thing; he is always young and being born into
the world, always struggling to become effective. That Hindu
trinity is far nearer to political and social realities than the
Persian dualism of light and darkness, the dualism of the good and
the bad, that the party system suggests.</p>

<p>Like modernist theology, like all such applications of ancient
and time-worn phrasings to new necessities, it fails a little under
scrutiny. Dickon's treatment of Lord Northcliffe and Mr. Lloyd
George as Sons of the Morning, lit by the spirit of Brahma, is
decidedly unsatisfactory. Something has gone wrong there. I make
identifications in quite another direction, but of those I will
tell later. My identifications, too, are provisional and for want
of any better. But I think they are nearer than Dickon's. Mr.
Baldwin is better as Vishnu's Prime Minister, and there is much to
be said for the view that the Duke of Northumberland is a modern
incarnation of Vishnu. But the genteel Ramsay MacDonald and the
inexpressive Clynes, man-of-the-world Thomas, and Catholic
Communist Wheatley are not very good as&mdash;shall I say
Sivatheria? Siva keeps his temple, if he keep a temple anywhere, in
Moscow. Does Siva tolerate temples? <i>One</i> thing I know, that
in the heart of every youngster forced at the very dawn of
adolescence to accept a destiny of obedience, inferiority, and
uncongenial toil there is a potential altar to Siva with the red
fire waiting to be lit.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be better to stress the eternal intermingling
of the triad. The spirit of Vishnu&mdash;that is to say, the stiff,
fierce cowardice of established advantage, the spirit of Siva, the
wild resentment of exclusion and imposed inferiority, the spirit of
Brahma, the urge of curiosity and creative experiment; all these in
varying degrees work everywhere and in all of us. Wherever there is
ownership and government Vishnu installs himself; wherever there
are dispossessed masses Siva reigns. Brahma, who makes all new
things, dominates neither ruler nor crowd, but moves throughout the
universe, progress eternal....</p>

<p>If Vishnu rules among the creditors and conservatives and Siva
is the god of debtors and the parties of the left, does it follow
that Brahma is to be identified with liberalism?</p>

<p>This is a matter for discussion not so much for me as for the
bright young gentlemen, often now quite middle-aged, who spend
their vacations reviving the Liberal Party in conferences and
summer schools. I admit that liberalism has always attracted me,
and even in my socialist days as a student I called myself also a
liberal, I still call myself a liberal and my views liberalism, but
the repulsion of the Liberal Party has been as strong as the
attraction of its name. When I dabbled in politics in that rather
excited and uncritical reconstruction period after the war, I
joined the Labour Party&mdash;l do not now recall exactly why.
Possibly because of the little bunch of intellectuals who gave it a
delusively constructive air. Under democratic conditions all
parties are the same stuff and all politicians are alike; the game
they play is the same for all of them, and every team must be made
up of much the same sort of men. But nevertheless&mdash;though Mr.
Vivian Phillipps, Chief Whip, I understand, of the surviving
fragments, would not own me&mdash;I am a liberal. And so is Brahma
the Creator. Though I do not think he would own Mr. Vivian
Phillipps.</p>

<p>Of all kinds of men who have ever been active in affairs, I
suppose the English Whig of the eighteenth century is most after my
heart. Yet I doubt if the real Lord Brahma is very like an
eighteenth-century English Whig....</p>

<p>Since Dickon took to monetary reform as his special and
comprehensive task, he has, I remark, restricted Vishnu more and
more to the creditor spirit and the power of gold. And if he were
pressed for some evidence of the existence of Brahma, he would find
it in the projects for a regulated currency as they have been
sketched by Mr. Maynard Keynes. But where he will find the spirit
of Brahma expressed in the public affairs of America I do not know.
I hesitate between Mr. Henry Ford and&mdash;&mdash;. But why should
I be thus specific about men so far away from my continual
observation? Let me keep my personal allusions for the lands I
know. Here in France they are quite sure that the one God of
America is Vishnu, the Transatlantic Brahma is as inaudible to them
as he is obscure to us, and Siva, they gather, is either detained
at Ellis Island or safely in gaol.</p>

<p>A golden incarnation of Vishnu rules America, as they see it
from these broken European countries, rules America absolutely,
sitting upon a Treasury full of gold. Indeed, the American Vishnu
sits, in this vision, like a golden weight upon all the world,
smiling gold stoppings at the figure of Hope. But I am an
Anglo-Saxon myself and I know that I do not know America. More may
be hidden in a market-place than can be hidden in a desert. America
seems to be leading the world now and seems likely to go on leading
the world for some tIme, m the reconstruction of economic life upon
this new scale, the scale of the great modern business
combinations. It cannot do this, I hold, without producing, in
addition to a vast encumbrance of merely wealthy common persons, a
great number of energetic and capable directive men and women of a
definable type, people who will ultimately be bored and irritated
by existing political institutions and current ways of living, and
who will set themselves, more and more intelligently and
co-operatively, to the entire reconstruction of human affairs.</p>

<p>At present such types are still ineffective in America, because,
among other difficulties, they have to struggle towards
understanding through thickets of mind-destroying slang and swamps
of verbose cant. You do not hew your way across a great continent
in three generations and carry your vocabulary intact. America has
partly lost the ancient gift of rational speech. American thought
is more hampered than we realise by the necessity of expressing
itself in a language that is habitually depraved. It is kept at a
low level by the universal resort to the common school, with its
badly trained teachers and poor equipment, and by those
peculiarities of illumination upon which Dickon expatiated, which
sacrifice clearness so ruthlessly to vividness, and precision of
dealing to harshly dramatic effect.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-17" name="b3-17"></a>§ 17. SENSE OF HUMOUR</h2>

<p class="first">ONE other aspect I want to give of Dickon before
his picture is completed, a glimpse of something very deep in him.
What I have to tell may seem extraordinarily nothing to the reader,
but to me it is the very heart of Dickon. It was one day, at most
two years ago, after my very first discovery of Provence and before
he' went off to Brussels, that this incident occurred. I was
sleeping that night at Bordon Street, and when he came in I was
reading by the fire.</p>

<p>It was late. He was a little flushed and crumpled, in dinner
dress and with his decorations. I did not know at the time where he
had been; I learned that afterwards.</p>

<p>There had been a great dinner of Advertisers&mdash;I rather
think it was one of the organisations he had created&mdash;and he
had spoken and let himself go. A little warmed by champagne and
professional fraternity, he had spread out his dream of the
Advertiser as prophet and teacher to a pleased but incredulous
gathering. Some one had laughed, and he had sounded a prophetic
note in reply. "We are the masters of the newspapers and they know
it," he had said. "We and we alone have the ear of the world. We
can dictate what shall be known and what shall not be known, what
shall exist and what shall not. We can educate the people or
degrade the people, exalt right things and humble base things. We
can be the guide, philosopher, and friend of the common
man&mdash;working together (renewed laughter). Why should we not
rise to the full height of our possibilities?"</p>

<p>Then he had paused and come to something like an anticlimax.</p>

<p>"Are we never to reach beyond motor-cars and medicines,
cigarettes and pickles?"</p>

<p>He lowered impressively for a second or so and then sat
down.</p>

<p>The Organized Advertisers cheered and hammered the tables, but
also they looked curiously at one another and glanced at Dickon,
flushed and already doubtful of the wisdom of what he had said.
They had heard some of this before from him, but not so much nor so
plainly.</p>

<p>"There was moderation in all things," commented a subsequent
speaker. "Our energetic and masterful friend to whose organising
fervour our profession owed so much," was, he thought, a little
prone to exaggerate. It was not perhaps altogether a fault in an
advertiser (laughter) within limits (renewed laughter). But though
it might be good business to exaggerate, it was not wise to
threaten (hear, hear). We had our share, a great share, he would
indeed go so far as to say a vital share, in stimulating and in
sustaining the currents of trade, the prosperity of our mighty
empire, but it was a share&mdash;in subordination. It had its place
and its limits. There was such a thing as taking one's bit too
seriously....</p>

<p>Possibly through sheer clumsiness he had circled about and
repeated this thought three or four times. But he was encouraged by
"Hear and hear" and some gentle rapping on the table. What had been
intended as a friendly reproof became an attack upon Dickon, and at
the end what they call a trouncing.</p>

<p>Dickon was a respected and popular figure in the advertisement
world, but his was the reluctant popularity accorded to success.
His associates liked him but they felt at times I think that he did
little to compel them to like him. This talk of their high
responsibilities after dinner had not so much flattered them as
made them feel uncomfortable, and the gathering fell back very
readily into a sympathetic deprecation of "exaggeration" and "lack
of humour." They applauded warmly; they nodded their approval.
Later speakers showed an increasing disposition to echo and even
exceed the trouncer, and a funny man saw his opportunity, and the
applause and laughter grew.</p>

<p>The arrow still chafed in Dickon's hide. He stood before the
fire and brooded immensely before his explosion.</p>

<p>"This damned sense of humour!" he cried suddenly and
violently.</p>

<p>"Eh?" said I, looking up from my book.</p>

<p>"You might do a decent thing that would make you look a bit
high-falutin'. And so you do a shabby, lazy, second-rate thing
instead, and grin and say, 'Thank God I've got a sense of humour.'
That's what it amounts to."</p>

<p>"Is this me, Dickon, you're talking to?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Billy! I never talk to you. I was thinking. Man I heard
speak to-night. Took me up&mdash;for blowing a bit too strongly
about advertisement....</p>

<p>"Perhaps I said too much.... Perhaps I did." He went on as if he
addressed some third person.</p>

<p>"But <i>Modesty</i>! Knowing your place in the world! Rot it all
is! Rot I tell you. Cringing, shamming, shirking muck they bully
into boys in public schools. And from an Advertising Man of all
people! An Advertiser! Think of it! Modesty! Not going all out for
the things that have to be done! Let a child drown under your eyes!
Thank God <i>you</i> don't profess to be a swimmer. <i>You</i>
don't take upon yourself to rescue all the drowning kids in
Christendom. If some presumptuous silly ass who can hardly swim at
all chooses to, go into the water and gets himself into a mess,
<i>you</i> aren't going to do anything but smile. Flick a pebble at
his head as he comes up for the third time. You're a quiet smiler,
you are! "</p>

<p>I leant back in my chair to appreciate my brother better. There
was nothing else to do. I was still at a loss to know what it was
all about. He was just the slightest bit drunk, but mostly this
was, I perceived, a rational passion.</p>

<p>"Sense of humour!" said Dickon. "There isn't much of that poison
in Advertisement, anyhow...."</p>

<p>He seemed to recall my presence.</p>

<p>"You may laugh, Billy! But that blamby-pamby idiot to-night has
got my goat. I've been a hot man to-night in a world of quiet
smiles. Fuming. He let me up to seeing what all this gentlemanly
grinning and smirking and enjoying the fun of it quietly and
unassumingly really means. Why should a man be guyed for taking
himself seriously?: what else <i>is</i> there to take seriously?
Those chaps who won't take themselves seriously ought to have been
headed off by birth control and never begun. All this half-doing
things! All this living with the guts out!... A joke's a joke in
its place, but most of this not taking yourself too seriously is a
dirty sin against heaven."</p>

<p>And suddenly Dickon soared above me. He became a pulpit and my
admirable armchair a pew. His voice mingled expostulation and
passionate assertion in the most extraordinary way.</p>

<p>"Because one sets out to do big things, Billy, because there are
big things to be done, because one works until one gets ragged and
sore, it doesn't follow one is presumptuous. We two are successes,
Billy; life has pampered us, petted us, put its best carpets under
our feet. Have we a right to be anything but serious men?
<i>Damned</i> serious men! It's no want of modesty to attempt
everything one can; to play as big a game as one can; it's a sense
of obligation. What we <i>are</i>.... That's another question.</p>

<p>"Don't we know each other through and through, Billy? Do we
pretend? Do we put on airs? Don't I know what asses we are, I who
can't leave a scrap on my plate and you who brighten at the swish
of a girl's skirt? But you <i>do</i>, Billy! Every one sees it.
Don't we know how we blunder, how we lose our little tempers, the
endless <i>silly</i> things we do ? Yes, and all the same, with all
our weaknesses upon us, we've got to be in deadly earnest and do
our biggest job.</p>

<p>"If we don't, who will? Look here, Billy.... Is there a race of
Gods among mankind, that you and I can slack? Who will do things if
we don't? If we stand aside, smirking in our elegant modesty, who
is there to take hold of things? A sense of humour, I tell you,
Billy, is no fit possession for a decent man. Let the failures have
their damned sense of humour! Cuddle it and nurse it. They need it.
Let them snigger and sneak and steal, and make funny faces behind
the backs of the men in earnest. That's <i>their</i> road, the low
road. But for us&mdash;things have been put before us, Billy, and
we have to take hold of them. We may not be aristocrats; our luck
may be all chance; but for good or evil, God has put us among the
masters in the affairs of men. And a master I mean to be. Oh, I'd
rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused to assemble it.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be a skunk and set myself to outstink this drain
into which I have fallen, stink and stink hard instead of making
for fresh air, than be one of these damned sense-of-humour business
men."</p>

<p>Queer how Dickon could be stung at times!</p>

<p>He was quiet for a moment. "I know I'm a fat ass," he said in an
altered voice. "Oh, I know I'm a fat ass and deserve to be grinned
at. Don't I <i>know</i> it!"</p>

<p>He went on talking to himself in broken sentences. "Take the
second plateful.... Go to the club. How can one help eating too
much at the Ermine? Sleepy afternoon.... Half one's efficiency
gone.... Things like that. Temper over a tight collar.... The times
I've shocked Minnie! Such a poor <i>comic</i> thing!..."</p>

<p>The muttering died away into an incoherent rumbling that was
presently ended in a nod and a "Yes."</p>

<p>Then he stood quite still. And suddenly whispered something that
gripped me strangely. He whispered it quite forgetful of me, as one
whispers a phrase that one has thought out and chosen long ago and
repeated many times. I perceived at once that it had been his
ultimate consideration on many such occasions of trouble.</p>

<p><i>"Weak as we are,"</i> said Dickon, <i>"those others are
weaker."</i></p>

<p>I stared at him. I had known Dickon all my life, and suddenly it
dawned upon me that in some things I hardly knew him at all.</p>

<p>He woke up again.</p>

<p>"Pity I got in a temper!" he said. "Oh!&mdash;a damned pity!</p>

<p>"I could have murdered that fool.</p>

<p>"I showed it and they grinned at me.... I'm glad I had you to
blow off to, old man....</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have slept all night. Sometimes cursing him and
sometimes cursing myself. No one knows the nights we spend, some of
us, Billy.</p>

<p>"You see, Billy, what I said wasn't exactly what I meant to say.
I overdid it. What I said was right, but somehow I overdid it. I
gave him a loophole. I don't say things exactly. It's too beastly
hard to say things exactly.</p>

<p>"But they got what I was after all right.... Damned sight too
much for them....</p>

<p>"They like being funny little nibbling beasts. They <i>like</i>
it...."</p>

<p>I forget what else he said. I was not listening any longer. I
was turning over his astonishing aphorism in my mind. <i>"Weak as
we are, those others are weaker."</i></p>

<p>That, I think, is the quintessence of Dickon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b3-18" name="b3-18"></a>§ 18. STRATUM OF FUTILITY</h2>

<p class="first">IT is curious how the social uses of Lambs Court
have dissolved away since the death of Minnie. Richard Clissold
Junior has married now, and Winnie has gone to live with her
husband in Italy, and young William, my godson, is something of a
rebel and a painter (but, I begin to think after my last visit to
his studio, a very good painter), and until my great-nephews and
great-nieces repopulate it Lambs Court above stairs is an empty
place, left more and more to the routines of old and trusted and
conservative servants.</p>

<p>Dickon's life, for all our early divergence, reverts to the
pattern of mine&mdash;the life of a man who has come through the
ordinary drama of the world with the sense of a part played out,
who is yet full of vitality and anxious to get things done, who
still has strong and deep desires, but who is no longer swayed by
that intensity of personal reference that narrowed hIS life before.
In that period of renewed intimacy that followed Minnie's death we
discussed almost as if we were students again what we were doing
with the years that still remained to us. Both of us were at loose
ends. Both of us were becoming acutely aware of our dwindling
handful of life, and both of us were asking ourselves, as it soaked
away between our fingers: "What am I doing with it? What is the
best that I can do with it?"</p>

<p>We were pulling ourselves together for the last lap of coherent
living. We were entirely vague then about our objectives. I had
been so for some years; but with Dickon the phase was more acute.
And more decisive. Since then Dickon, with characteristic
concentration, has settled down to a task of his own, a task that
will need all that is left of him to accomplish, and I, for more
complicated reasons, am no longer under the same cloud of feeling
that then made me unhappy. But for a while it was as if something
long forgotten anxiety of youth, anxiety about the purposes of life
had come back to us out of those far-off adolescent days.</p>

<p>I find myself wondering how many of our contemporaries have
experienced such a fresh start, such a phase of doubt and
resumption in their middle years. I question if many intelligent
people escape that sort of trouble in adolescence. It is so
universal that I would call it distinctively "anxiety of youth."
Then for most of us comes immediate necessity, the pressure of
events; we are caught up and hustled along and excited and
distracted and amused, and many of us, perhaps most human beings,
never reach those open and interrogative silences again before
death ends the storm of experience. Unless there is a space of
leisure, a release from the thickets of need, I do not see how that
trouble can return. And some happy souls hear no more of these
interrogations, because, like Sir Rupert York, they have answered
them once for all. It is well I have already given a picture of him
in this book, because there at least you have one man who has said,
simply and completely: "This work is good enough for me." He will
go on unhurryingly., with his bones and his other specimens and the
subtle and satisfying problems that concern him, until at last one
morning he will not get up, but lie, peaceful and done.</p>

<p>He is one of a number of men of science whom I know to be men
serene in their souls and happy in the essence of their lives. But
scientific work is a world apart, a magic island cut off from
futility. Music, too, may be another magic island, cut off not only
from futility but from reality. There is a protective isolation
about most of the arts. But Science has most of this precious
detachment. And is yet profoundly real. Scientific workers work to
the end, though at last they may go gently like a boat coming home
as the wind falls in the evening. I was once upon that island of
enduring work. Had I kept upon it I should not have been writing
this book now and making these half-envious, half-admiring
reflections.</p>

<p>Even when there is a space of leisure I doubt if that phase of
middle-aged unrest happens very generally. It is natural for me now
to find the quality of middle-aged people's lives particularly
interesting. I am impressed by the present proliferation of the
middle-aged. They form a larger proportion of mankind than was ever
the case in the world before. And I am more aware of them.</p>

<p>Quite as important in human affairs as that change of scale upon
which I have been dwelling in recent sections is the prolongation
of life now in progress. I do not think I am being led away by my
own circumstances to exaggerate its importance. The average age of
the English, for example, has risen steadily for the last century.
For that, at any rate, we have fairly trustworthy figures. In
Elizabethan times one was mature at thirty and old at forty;
Shakespeare was already a worn-out, unproductive old man in
retirement at fifty. Everything was earlier and younger then; Romeo
had the years of a raw undergraduate, and Juliet was a child. One
loved and loved again and married and had children, and by the time
they were of age the game was done. The ordinary man of fifty was
fat or grey or bald and his teeth had gone beyond repair. There was
no repair.</p>

<p>Young people died freely at all ages; more children died than
lived to maturity. There was a fever, therefore, to the crises of
life before the chance was snatched away.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"What is love? 'tis not hereafter;<br>
Present mirth hath present laughter;<br>
What's to come is still unsure:<br>
In delay there lies no plenty:<br>
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,<br>
Youth's a stuff will not endure."</p>
<br>

<p>That was the note of it. To be old and hale was remarkable. It
was to be distinguished and isolated. The aged of fifty and upward
formed a dwindling chorus to the song of youth. They sat and looked
on at the dance&mdash;a little outstaying their welcome. The
literatures of the world still preserve the spirit of that more
transitory time, and its tradition dominates us to-day.</p>

<p>In all classes now, but particularly in the prosperous classes,
people do not die as once they did. More and more hold on. And they
are cared for and mended; it is not merely life that is prolonged,
but vigour. Vigour and the desire for living. An accession is
developing to the human life cycle; a stage after the family life,
which itself grows less and less prolific and uses up the available
energy less and less completely. And this elder stratum has no
traditions as yet to shape its activities. Literature has not
prepared us for it, and we come through to it with a sort of
surprise. As soon as they have done with loving and getting, the
novels, the plays dismiss us with a phrase. We are supposed to be
enfeebled, sated, and done. We discover we are not so easily
dismissed. We have not finished. We are not enfeebled. We demand a
better role than to act as chorus to the next generation and offer
it out-of-date advice. Here I declare on the edge of sixty is
living still to be done, in a new mood and for a new end.</p>

<p>I believe that as civilisation develops this elder stratum is
going to play a determining role in human development. In the first
part of this book I told of a talk I had with Dr. Jung of Zurich.
Among other things that I brought away from that evening was the
fruitful idea that the prevalent states of mind of quite grown-up
people in past ages are preserved as phases in the development of
the immature to-day, and that a new, more fully adult phase is
spreading from the fifties and forties downward in human
experience. This proportionate increase in the elder stratum will
contribute greatly to the intensification and extension of this new
adult phase. It will ultimately make life more disinterested and
more deliberate and less romantic. It will make novels and plays
that set out to present life aspects of history instead of stories
of mating. But that will only be when this stratum has developed a
consciousness of its distinctive quality and role. Then it will
impose its standards upon the younger generation and assist it
sooner and sooner to maturity. At present things are still the
other way about, and the elder stratum is dominated by the
overemphasised standards of the younger generation. At present it
has still to realise itself. It is like a new actor thrust upon the
scene before a part has been found for him. For a time it is a
conspicuous encumbrance even to itself.</p>

<p>What an extraordinary spectacle of waste do the lives of the
great majority of us middle-aged and older prosperous people
present to-day!</p>

<p>An immense proportion of the property and spending power of the
world is now in the hands of old folks, who would in every previous
time have died and left things to their heirs. The heirs remain
allowanced and functionless, going about the world in a state of
arrested reality. They are amateurs of everything, provisionally
active, waiting for a call that lingers.</p>

<p>About here in Provence, and especially along this coast from
Saint Raphael to far beyond Genoa, there is gathered an abundant
assemblage of this old, prosperous multitude for my astonished
observation. Under eighteenth-century conditions not <i>one</i> per
cent. of these people would be alive. Now their still peculiar sham
youthfulness sets all the fashions of living. The amount of
altogether futIle VItality upon these hills and coasts is
incredible, until one has gone to and fro through it and mixed with
it and watched it.</p>

<p>There is, first of all, a very considerable resident population
here of oldish wealthy people. They build, they own or lease
beautiful villas with great gardens and lovely prospects. There
must be hundreds of thousands of such people along these coasts ;
from England and America alone they must number scores of
thousands; and they must represent an aggregate income of hundreds
of millions of pounds. They employ the lives of hundreds of
thousands of servants, they spread their gardens over great areas
of land, they send up the cost of living for everyone, and they
crowd the pulmonary refugees out of the sunshine. They are often
men and women who playa vigorous game of tennis, stand the fatigues
of whole days of motoring, they come and go among themselves,
lunching, dining, assembling, dispersing, and I cannot find a soul
among them that is doing anything of large importance in the world
or stretching its energies to the full, in any direction whatever.
They declare they have played their parts in the world and
finished. There are women who have borne and brought up one or two
or even three children, and women who have produced none. I could
assemble a score of men within an hour's motoring of this
<i>mas</i>&mdash;younger men than I, who say they have "retired."
Under that phrase they contentedly rule themselves dead for all
effectual ends. They are just playing about, the little innocents,
until Nurse Angel-of-Death comes to put them to bed.</p>

<p>Close to me here is a fairly representative sample of these
Riviera residents; she is the widow of old Sir Ralph Steinhart, and
she was a niece of the original Romer; she inherits an interest in
the activities of Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co. and their
subsidiaries from both sides. Every time I have done a hands-turn
for any of our concerns I have made her richer. Here she is, within
half an hour's drive of me, silver-haired&mdash;the natural grey
made an even white by skilful bleaching&mdash;high-coloured and
bright-eyed. She is a little bent and restlessly active. Her
gardens are very spacious and fine. We pass them usually when we go
to Nice. She has, I observe, obstructed a number of the peasants'
paths to make her domain more secluded; she threatens them on
boards with <i>pièges à loup</i>, and they must go round by a
longer way outside her fences to do their business. Inside one
rarely sees anything moving among the olive terraces and the
frequent stone jars; it is still and deserted except that sometimes
in the cool of the evening a manservant is visible taking a pet dog
for its sanitary stroll. Nearer the house there are great hedges of
agave and cactus, groves of palm and glimpses of glorious colour
which, save for herself and a few guests, delight only God and her
gardeners. She has bought and evacuated half a dozen peasant
houses, she told me one day, to assure the amenities of her
view&mdash;which, on the whole, is not so good as mine.</p>

<p>I am obliged almost in spite of myself to know something of her
house and her life. When she is here&mdash;for two-thirds of the
year she is not here and the house stands empty except for a
caretaker or so and a casual priest or so, a luxurious blank on the
face of the earth&mdash;when she is here, she makes continual
efforts to cultivate my acquaintance. It is not that she likes me
or that I even pretend to like her, but because she is inordinately
curious about my relations to Clementina, and because generally I
perplex her and because, more than anything else, she has nothing
better to do. She persists in raiding me with parties of
high-coloured, bright-eyed, observant Romer and Steinhart nieces
and in-laws. Or with a literary party of those beastly little
cigarette dealers who write novels for the English county families,
and their crumpled and dishevelled womenfolk. Or with a scratch lot
from the dramatic world. Or even with one of her selected
collections from the aristocratic Catholic circles of Paris. But
these last are rarer. That is the side of her life she turns away
from me. Her car does its best and sticks inside my pillars, and up
they all come on foot, either quietly agog and staring about them,
or else with an impelled reluctant look, according to their race
and breeding.</p>

<p>As soon as the car is observed below, Jeanne flies upstairs to
put on what is known with us as a Lady Steinhart apron, and while I
entertain the party upon the terrace with a taciturn amiability,
tea is served in cups of coarse Provençal ware. The party is made
to spread a peculiarly fluid and difficult cherry jam on toasted
crusts with large holes in them, through which the red stuff drips
on anything below it, and I converse about the Provençal
climate&mdash;which has recently developed Anglomania&mdash;and
intimate my readiness to hear the purport of the visit. If
Clementina is present she is silently polite, and regards the
visitors in a way that serves at least to embarrass their scrutiny
of the books, newspapers, and other oddments scattered about the
terrace. Her dog goes a little way off and yaps protestingly and
usefully, in a tone that shows that the whole affair is to be
considered unusual. After a time something seems to break, and her
ladyship and party gravitate down the hill again. I never ask her
to repeat the visit, and she always does.</p>

<p>She cannot understand why I should live here for so much of my
time in a house that I rent for three thousand depreciated francs a
year, wearing dirty old flannels and employing a solitary servant.
She knows that I pay ten thousand pounds a year or so in super-tax
and income-tax, and this way of living seems to her like a wicked
waste of God's bounty. She cannot understand why I sit for so many
hours in this upper room to which her way is always barred. And,
above all, she cannot understand why Clementina sometimes isn't
here and sometimes is; why she has so many meals here, and why she
sits dangling her long legs over the wall of my terrace and smoking
my cigarettes with an air of complete domestication, while I am
upstairs writing. As I never explain Clementina to anyone, as I
shall probably not explain her completely even in this book, it is
natural that to Lady Steinhart she remains unexplained.</p>

<p>Consequently Lady Steinhart never quite knows whether she really
knows Clementina and whether she may, or possibly even ought to,
invite Clementina to lunch, and what would happen if she did. And
all that is excellent exercise for Lady Steinhart's mind.</p>

<p>Visits like this seem to take up a large part of her
<i>time</i>. She and a multitude of other people are always rushing
about this country seeing each other; and I will confess I cannot
imagine a less interesting series of sights. Like all Romers and
Steinharts, she is addicted to discovering and dropping young
musicians, and for these special parties have to be assembled. And
also she gets through a considerable amount of time altering her
house and garden. She is always digging something up or laying
something down, or planting out something or opening out a vista,
and if she can manage it she takes you to the spot affected and
asks your advice. And while you are giving your advice she is
thinking of the next thing she will bother you about. She pursues
and buys old furniture, pictures, pottery, and jewellery
remorselessly and voraciously. It's a clever little
fifteenth-century pot that gets away from her once she is on its
trail. And when she has bought a thing she glories in it for a
little while, and shows it to her friends and makes them guess what
she gave for it, and puts it in her already very congested house,
where it presently sinks down out of sight among the other stuff;
and when she has forgotten all about it, as she must do, I hope her
tremendous and implacable major-domo steals it and sells it to some
one to sell to her all over again. Then there is also much to be
done about her clothes and her dresses and her hair. So her days
are always emptily busy and the net result of them is exactly
nothing at all.</p>

<p>But you must not think that Lady Steinhart's life is wholly
consumed by these activities. She is a very moral woman; there is
no talk of a lover for her although she is still short of sixty,
and she does not dance more than two or three times a week. But the
gap thus left is filled in by a rather distinguished serious side.
This serious side she does not let me see as much of as I should
like to do. It is the one thing she does not press upon me, and it
is the one thing about her that interests me. She is a little
bashful with me about it; I do not know why. It reaches high and
far. You might imagine that a born Romer, who is a</p>

<p>Steinhart by marriage, would be a Jewess, but this is not the
case with her. She is hostile to Jews. She is a Catholic. She is
substantially one of the old noblesse. She is a Catholic and a
reactionary, and it is alleged that she made even Sir Ralph a
Catholic after he became speechless before his death. She is
involved in French politics at an angle proper to an aristocratic
and pious woman. Priests, bishops, monsignori are to be found at
her house, moving about quietly, speaking in undertones, forming
little black clumps in the bright flower-gardens, obscurely active,
mysteriously wary. She has done much for the Church, and she may do
more.</p>

<p>And the Church which has always had a weakness for pious women
of property makes her a great concession. She has a private chapel
of her own to play with; it is her dearest interest. She buys it
petticoats and lace and ornaments and jewels and metal pots and
pans to put on&mdash;and take off. It is in the house somewhere,
and often when one goes in, one is reminded of her serious side by
a whiff of incense. from some recent function. She can go there
alone and meditate, and I suppose she can regale herself with
special services, but what she thinks of God when she meditates is
as hidden from my imagination as what God can think of her. There
is usually a subdued-looking priest or so at her table. Not
excessively pampered. The Romer blood is in her veins, and you
feel, and you can feel they feel, that they have been paid for.</p>

<p>That private chapel is the crown of her life. It is a great
privilege, and she must have sought it for many years. It is the
consummation of her bric-à-brac. No doubt the Church weighed the
matter and decided that it was worth while to respect her spiritual
possibilities to that extent. Perhaps the Church does not know the
Romers quite so well as I know them. Anyhow, she has it. The chapel
is her distinction. Take that away and substitute a lover, or
bridge, or the higher amateurishness in art or criticism, or a
specialised collecting mania, or a cherished illness, or just blank
interludes, and you have the life of quite a large number of these
great ladies of the Riviera. And the men, the "retired" men, the
resident sort, cultivate their gardens also, play tennis, make love
in a vague, furtive way, indulge in wistful reminiscence of the
days when they were alive, and are on the whole much less animated
than the women. Some are vicious in an elderly, elaborate, Roman
way, and their establishments are barred and secret, and their
rather too smart menservants go about visibly clad in light and
becoming blackmail. French journalists are modest upon such
questions, and the Riviera has no Suetonius. There are not many
married couples in constant association among our residents. The
prevalent thing is a single personality engaged, with the widest,
most dignified, and expensive of details, in futility.</p>

<p>But the residential side of the Côte d'Azur is not, after all,
its most typical aspect. Where the big hotels cluster, the
multitude grows dense. Sooner or later everyone in the Western
world who has more than three thousand pounds a year must come to
the Riviera. An invisible necessity seems to bring us here just as
the souls in the Swedenborgian books go undriven to their ultimate
destinies. I am here, and, after all, I am rather pretending not to
belong to it than honestly detached. For so many of us there is
nowhere else to go&mdash;quite remarkably there is not. To the
north are murderous climates and to the south murderous
discomforts. A few come once or twice and then not again, but most
who have come continue to come. A middle-aged hunger for the sun is
an active, physical cause. The transients come and go
tremendously.</p>

<p>Many of them still function in some reduced or inattentive way
elsewhere; some of the younger set between forty-five and sixty are
frankly recuperating; but most have altogether discontinued any
contribution to the world's affairs. In the hotels we sit and watch
them, guessing ages. The average is astonishingly high. Golden lads
of sixty step it briskly with gay girls of forty-five. The grey
heads bob to the black music. The other day we found an incessant
couple in a Cannes hotel, who golfed all the forenoon and danced
together until one in the morning, and both were over seventy. The
only young people here seem to be subsidiaries. I make no objection
to all this activity on the part of old people. I would rejoice to
see them dancing and generally active at ninety and a hundred, but
my perplexity is their universal disregard of anything else in the
world but amusement taken in a quasi-juvenile form.</p>

<p>For a large proportion of this multitude the belated juvenility
needs more questionable expression than golfing and dancing, Darby
and Joan. Since they have yet to discover that there is any graver
business in life than getting, they must gamble, though they are
rich and easy; and since they know of no livelier desires they
still want most desperately to go on with the adolescent modes of
love. With a little care and effort much may still be effected in
that matter. One can still be jealous and vindictive, still charm
here and break-off there, be cold and cruel and fitful and make the
yearning lover realise the wretchedness of an insecure allowance.
When one is no longer overanxious to steal away with one's dear
mistress, one can still be seen about with her. Which accounts for
the prevalence here of a large number of really very beautiful and
brilliant and highly decorated young women between the ages of
fifteen and forty, and a large variety of utterly detestable young
gentlemen. A mistress must look the part and have a lavish and
pampered air. And for some of those who have had a hard struggle to
win to this Paradise of ease and power, there seems to be a
peculiar charm in gilt-edged passions; Russian exiles, often with
quite genuine titles, nobility from almost everywhere, countesses,
duchesses, princesses divorcing or divorced, royal bastards (in
profusion and with every degree of authenticity), ex-royalties, and
even precariously current royalties are here, and only too ready to
oblige. The Americans, they say, are particularly generous and
abject paymasters to such people. That is probably a libel on the
Americans; there are merely more of them with money.</p>

<p>And, thirdly, there is the sport, the mechanical gratification
of shooting pigeons, the assembling to look on at racing, polo,
flying, fencing, tennis. The worship of tennis becomes more amazing
every year. The papers that come here, even the <i>Manchester
Guardian</i> and the <i>Nation</i>, discuss it earnestly, deeply.
Photographs of its heroic figures fill the illustrated weeklies.
The women have a sort of wadded look about the feet and ankles; the
men's faces, in the absence of a ball to hit, are alertly empty. We
study the characters, the mannerisms, of these gifted beings.
Minniver, it seems, is amusingly short-tempered; he insults his
partner and swears. You can hear it all over the court; you can
hear about it all over the world. Judkins has a peculiar
penetrating sniff. It is, I understand, to be broadcasted.</p>

<p>In relation to all these things cluster the shop-folk and all
sorts of dealers, the professionals, the teachers of dancing, the
manicurists and complexion specialists, the hoteliers,
restaurateurs, and so forth, with, their own sympathetically
imitative tennis and sport and private vices out of business
hours.</p>

<p>It is still full season down there on the beaches, for I got my
<i>lit-salon</i> reservation for next week from Cannes at only
eight days' notice&mdash;I have to run to London for some business
and leave this writing for a few weeks. But presently this
widespread crowd of aimless property will begin to pour home like a
sluice along the roads and in the expresses <i>de luxe</i>, and so
to Paris and more especially to England in May and June, to the
Paris dressmakers and body-makers and face-makers and on to the
jostling splendours of the London Court, and the culmination of all
things at Henley and Ascot&mdash;especially Ascot. Grave men will
wear grey top-hats with the serious elation befitting such an act,
and every sort of dress except the old and shabby will be
displayed. The King and Queen, those perfect symbols of the will
and purpose of the British Empire, will be gravely presiding over
the parade amidst the clicking cameras. Wherever there is a
foreground there also will be the Countess of Oxford and Asquith,
and no doubt some oaf of a Labour member will be well in evidence
in a white bowler hat and a loyal grin&mdash;just to make it clear
that there is nothing different about Labour. And if you study the
photographs and pictures of this immense inane gathering you will
see they represent mature and oldish people in an enormous
majority, deliberately and gravely assembled, dressed with
extraordinary attention, and doing nothing, nothing whatever except
being precisely and carefully there.</p>

<p>In the wane of the season here, to replace our first-class
assembly, there will come a char-à-banc crowd of the merely
prosperous, also middle-aged and getting on with it, filling the
Monte Carlo Casino at reduced entrance fees, gambling at five
francs a go, and learning how to be rich from the margin. They will
envy, they will emulate, they will peep over the villa walls and up
the Casino staircases to the private rooms. Some may even go up
those staircases. Adventurously. The wives will return to Sheffield
or Main Street or Pernambuco marvellously changed about the hair
and the skirts and the souls. These are the reserves of the great
spending class. They are learning. They spread the stratum wide and
deep into the general life. Tons of illustrated papers go out
weekly to them to keep them in touch; books and plays of a special
sort are made to satisfy their cravings. They have no God, and
Michael Arlen is their prophet.</p>

<p>I have written of the "elder stratum," but when I think over my
occasional glimpses of life at Monaco and Monte Carlo and Nice I am
doubtful whether "elder fester" would not be the better expression.
When one traces it away from here to Paris, London, Vienna, New
York, California, to Biskra and Egypt, to High Savoy, to Biarritz,
Palm Beach, and endless other places, to race meetings and summer
resorts, to Scotland and New England, and so to its town houses and
country houses and its places of origin, one realises something of
its scale and significance in our Atlantic world. It is all that
pays super-tax; it is the surplus of the world's resources. Yet
extensive and impressive as it is, it is nevertheless, so far as
its present characteristics go, almost as new as the great growth
of advertisement in Dickon's lifetime. Its precursors in the town
and Court life of the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries were
relatively younger, more actively self-assertive and more assured,
and incomparably less abundant and diffused. They were a little
intimate community, and this is an auriferous flood. I do not
believe that its present development is anything more than one
distinctive feature of a transitory phase in the great unfolding of
human society that is now in progress. This way of living is no
more permanent than the way of living one finds recorded&mdash;in
caricature indeed, but in illuminating and convincing
caricature&mdash;by Petronius in his <i>Satyricon</i>. It is an
overspill of gathering human energy like the spots on an adolescent
face. No state of human affairs that releases so vast a splash of
futile expenditure can be anywhere near equilibrium. It must be, it
manifestly is, undergoing rapid changes. Intelligent people, even
the intelligent people in the rich elder stratum itself, will rebel
against this mode of life, as Dickon and I have rebelled. And all
those who are outside of it have only to learn of it to desire to
end it, because it is so plainly a vast waste of spending power by
essentially powerless people.</p>

<p>Circumstances may have made Dickon and me rather tougher and
more refractory stuff than most of our class, less afraid to lie
awake at night and look what used to be called the Eternities in
the face. But none of these people can be of a very different clay
from Dickon and myself, and what has happened to us must happen
with slight differences in quality and quantity to most of them.
There is a great dread of lying awake at night manifest everywhere.
The activity to escape mental solitude is remarkable. Most of the
rushing about in motor-cars is plainly due to that. The rich,
ageing Americans in particular seem constantly In flight across the
Atlantic from something that is always, nevertheless, waiting for
them on the other side, whichever side it happens to be. There
would not be all this vehement going to and fro if they were not
afraid of something that sought them in the quiet places. And what
else can that something be but just these questions that have
confronted us. "There is only a little handful of water left now.
What do you mean to do with it? What under the stars is the meaning
of your life?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" they say at the first intimation of that whisper,
"where are we going to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Below and behind and all about the petty glittering activities
of the elder fester a sane and real next adult phase must surely be
preparing even now, the realisation that life can be lived indeed
to the very end, and that learning and making need never cease
until the last hour has come. Surely there dawns the immense
undying interest of social development, of the establishment of a
creative order, of the steady growth of human knowledge and power
upon the blank outlook of the present. Can these poor, raddled,
raffish, self-indulgent, aimless, wealthy types of to-day go on
existing as that grows clearer? There is no need of any great
convulsion to chase them from existence; they will fade out of the
spectacle. Some will learn, some will be expropriated; many types
among them will be made impossible by less speculative methods of
production. In that direction things must be moving now.</p>

<p>If I could return to this countryside in only a hundred years'
time, I am sure I should find the villas, hostels, roads,
promenades of all these places, and all the life that fills them,
changed profoundly. The buildings will be for the most part rebuilt
and less miscellaneous in their quality. Villa Cocotte in its
louder variations may have gone; the gaudy casinos and dancing
restaurants will have been cleared away; the gardens will be more
beautiful and less strenuously exclusive. The present fences of
wire, the <i>pièges à loup</i>, and fierce little intimations
against trespassing will have been abolished noiselessly by a
general amelioration of manners. The peasants' homes will have got
bathrooms, and their cultivations will be less labourious and more
skilful.</p>

<p>These bathrooms may be already close at hand. Jeanne tells me
that one reason given for the cutting down of olive-trees here is
that the olive harvest comes in winter and that picking olives
swells and stains and chaps the hands. Enough labour cannot be got
for the picking. People will not lend their hands to such work. A
new phase of civilisation is near when the human hand has won to
this much respect.</p>

<p>Swift, silent cars will run about this fairer land on smoother
roads, less numerously perhaps, and with a greater appearance of
purpose. The advertisement boards, like a clamour of touts that
ruin so much of the roadside scenery, will be banished altogether.
This Provence is too kind and lovable not to remain the resort of
great multitudes of people, but they will no longer be living days
of busy inconsecutiveness and pursuing the shadows of unseasonable
pleasures.</p>

<p>Perhaps my hopes run away with me, but it seems to me that even
in so short a time as a hundred years there may be a far larger
proportion of true adults amidst the retarded adolescents of our
elder stratum, and that their tone of thought and their quality of
conduct will have soaked far into the whole social body. Youth is
eager and passionate, but youth is not naturally frivolous, and at
present an artificial and meretricious frivolity is forced upon the
young by the greedy urgency of their aimless seniors. Youth also
may be something graver and stronger a hundred years from now.</p>

<p>However evident its approach, it is certain that the coming
adult phase is not yet in the ascendant. And since it has still to
come as a general thing, and since its essential quality is a
merger of one's romantic, adventurous, individual life into the
deathless life of the being of the species, manifestly it is not to
be attained in its fulness by a few isolated pioneers. The men of
science of this time are as a class more nearly able to be
adult-minded than any of the rest of us&mdash;so far, that is, as
their science goes. They are more in touch with an enduring
reality; they have their side of the world comparatively organised,
and they are joined up into a kind of collectivism. The rest of us
are rather people who have heard of this way of living and are
seeking it than who are actually living in the new stage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all the available forms and conveniences necessarily
remain those of our stratum. We must wear the clothes the fashions
prescribe unless we want to have our lives eaten up by minor
troubles and explanations. We must live in the usual way, for how
else can we live? If we want to travel we must travel by
<i>trains-de-luxe</i> or go slow and dirty, catch colds, and be
crowded, stifled, and disgusted; we must go to the hotels that
quiver to the strains of jazz, for there are no others at present
to go to; and eat either in restaurants amidst processions of
mannequins or with dancers jogging our elbows, or perplex our poor
stomachs with questionable fare. And if we want air and exercise,
is anything so convenient as tennis? Which demands all sorts of
conformities.</p>

<p>So we two Clissolds go about the world looking like any other
fairly rich spenders&mdash;crypto-adults at the best. If I live
upon the hills here, and very simply for a part of the year, it is
only because I have hit upon a remarkable young woman who has seen
fit to make it possible for me. And Heaven knows how long that will
last! It is only here that I can live like this&mdash;it is a
little abnormal adventure of my own&mdash; and for the rest of my
existence there waits a setting of hotel managers and porters and
maidservants and valets and all that is <i>comme-il-faut</i>.</p>

<p>Yet we appear to be much emptier worldlings than we are. We are
both, after our fashion, refusing to accept the fundamental stigma
of the elder stratum&mdash;which is the cessation of all serious
work. We have no blank enjoyments and we work as long hours as ever
we did. Longer perhaps. Dickon grapples now day and night with the
mysteries of what he calls the Money Power. To release our dear
Lady of Business from the paralysing grip of the Creditor is the
final quest of his life. He is thrusting in a sullen, persistent
way through a dark jungle of finance round about her in search of
something vulnerable. He believes there is a concrete dragon
somewhere in that darkness to be slain, and if so he will slay it.
Wherever there is a promise of light upon these obscurities Dickon
goes. Last November he was in Detroit in earnest conference with
Henry Ford, who possessed, he thought, a peculiar point of view and
special experiences about the evil thing. He crossed the Atlantic
in winter for that. And he is developing an angry, industrious
patience with currency and credit theorists. When he catches me in
England he makes me talk about them. He wrangles with me and will
not be denied. He talks now about money just as <i>he</i> used to
talk once about advertisement&mdash;continually, with <i>his</i>
heart as deeply in it.</p>

<p>I am quite unable to estimate what his activities amount to,
whether he is just hammering at a door which isn't a door but a
rock, or whether he is getting through to some working
generalisations. In the past Dickon had a way of getting out
results, but this is an immense business.</p>

<p>Apparently he cannot wring anything fundamental out of the
bankers. I have heard him in his wrath denouncing them as "beastly
little Abacuses; rotten little roulette wheels, bagging the odd
zero chance." He clings to it that they are automata and have not
the least idea of their role in the general economic life of the
world. He compares them with the Freemasons, who "had some sort of
a secret once and have forgotten it." He talks of "going into
banking" to find out. A pretty manager he'd make for a local
branch! The district would wake up.</p>

<p>I cannot write down his opinion of various Chancellors of the
Exchequer. The Treasury he sometimes reviles and sometimes only
bemoans. "Some of these chaps seem to think," he says. "Seem to be
able to think. But being officials by nature&mdash;they won't let
on. They control it. Or they might hit on something important and
upset their nice little lives." He wants to have the Treasury "dug
up and replanted." It is "pot bound"&mdash;which is, I believe,
some sort of horticultural metaphor. (I am no party to these
criticisms.) Certainly, he has hit upon nothing definite yet, or we
should have had him at once setting about to "put it over." Just as
once he "put over" Milton's Silent Silver Guinea.</p>

<p>May he do so before I die! I dream at times of my dear old
Dickon, so amazingly stout and still so amazingly active, engaged
upon his last and greatest campaign, leading a band of big
manufacturers and engineers, Titans of industry, mammoth
distributors and cosmic shippers, piling Pelion on Ossa, newspapers
on hoardings, and cinematographs on wireless, shaking all the
markets and shocking all the mints in the world, in a stupendous
effort to scale and storm the Olympus of Wall Street and the City
and dethrone the golden usurer who reigns there.</p>

<p>As for me, I work along a different line. I doubt if this simple
treatment of the Money Power as the One True Devil gets to the
bottom of things. We need a true sound money, yes; but that is only
to be got with quite a number of other developments that belong
together. I have failed to find any place in politics, which is
just as well for me; I have satisfied myself that I was in a state
of dangerous fog about economics and education, and at last I have
come to this quiet and seclusion in the sunshine&mdash;I said last
year, to think things out, and now as I get them thought out, I
say, to write my mind clear and try my creed over by making this
book.</p>

<h2><a id="b4-1" name="b4-1"></a>§ 1. STRESS OF YOUTH</h2>

<p class="first">BUT now I must come to my own personal history,
which perhaps I have kept back unduly. I must tell of my own
marriage and my lapse from scientific work to industrial chemistry,
and how I also like Dickon became a rich man, as perplexingly aware
as he of creative power almost in reach and yet evading us. To tell
the story fairly I must go right back again to our student
days.</p>

<p>It is part of the romantic travesty of reality that youth is a
happy trivial time. Childhood can be made happy and is made happy
nowadays for an increasing number of children, but I doubt if very
many human adolescences can be truthfully called happy. For the
enormous majority of human beings since ever humanity began to
develop social life, adolescence has been anxious and perplexed.
The creature is still at bottom the child of the Old Man of the
rough Stone Age, half-man, half-ape, and wholly egoist; its
adaptation is imperfect, and as adolescence comes on there is a
struggle between the necessities that keep it tame and social and
the deep-seated urgencies of its past. As the instinctive obedience
and trustfulness of childhood fades, the natural man, the natural
boy or girl, is discovered to be reserving a personality, becoming
self-assertive, difficult, recalcitrant, and interrogative.
"<i>Why</i> should I?" is the note of youth, and usually it is
consciously a resentful note, a plea in opposition.</p>

<p>The parents and schoolmasters of our simpler past made no
concealment about the matter. They understood the reality of
original sin, and they did not spoil the child by sparing the rod.
Youth was a sobbing, snivelling, howling time, jackets were dusted
thoroughly and great girls trounced and spanked, and withal the Old
Adam was never very thoroughly beaten out. To this day, smacks,
blows, shakings, bangings, confinement, privations, and threats are
the normal fare of ninety-nine out of a hundred young people. So
soon as they come out of the gentle shelter of parental
affection&mdash;and even that is sometimes very free with hand and
slipper&mdash;the storm begins.</p>

<p>People so intelligent as to read a book like this are also
probably intelligent enough not to have many children, and to
provide those they have with a skilful, kindly, healthy upbringing,
and it may seem to them that this is a too distressful view of
human existence. But let them think not of their own clean
nurseries, but of all the world from China to South Africa and Peru
and of all classes of people. We are too apt to think about life in
terms of cultivated homes in hygienic Atlantic countries. Taking
the whole world over, almost half the children born into it are
dead before they reach twenty-one, and most of the survivors have
suffered great hardships. It is a quite unnecessary state of
affairs now, but so it is. The process of getting dead before you
are twenty-one cannot, I maintain, be a very jolly and amusing
one&mdash;all the optimists and kindly smiling humourists of the
world notwithstanding.</p>

<p>By the time they are eleven or twelve most of the young people
alive in the world&mdash;less than two-thirds of the children born,
that is (for more than a third are already dead)&mdash;are put out
to toil. By toil I mean uncongenial exertions that are imposed upon
their free activity, exertions we would all shirk if we could. A
few advanced countries hold off the curse of Adam until thirteen or
fourteen, and some are making a serious effort to retain young
people at educational work, and to make that attractive and even
joyous, until they are sixteen. The rest of mankind is neither
consulted nor persuaded in this matter of toil; hardly any have a
choice between this toil or that; they are. put to it and there is
an end to the matter. And they hate it, and if their lives are not
altogether unhappy it is not because they do not suffer
humiliations, frustration, physical deprivation, and futile desires
and hopes in abundance, but because they are submissive and
forget.</p>

<p>They can forget and they can hope and they can forget their
hopes and still hope again. And at length as energy ebbs comes
resignation.</p>

<p>The common human life is a tissue of expectations that are never
realised and anticipations that are never fulfilled, of toil for
unsatisfying ends and pursuing anxieties, of outrageous, tormenting
desires, of fever and fatigue, anger and repentance, malaise, and
death.</p>

<p>I state these facts as brutally as possible because I think they
are excessively disregarded in the art, literature and general
thought of prosperous, cultivated people. Perhaps in the past it
was necessary to disregard them because there was little power to
alter them. But now there is power to alter them, and literature
may venture to make a step from poetry towards sincerity. We can
face the fact that a very large proportion of human beings are
still fobbed off with the mere offals and broken meats of life,
because now we are beginning to realise that there is a possible
salvation for them. It is no longer necessary to pretend that youth
and everyday life overflow with excitement, fun, and happiness.</p>

<p>In the past I cannot imagine how the ancestral ape could have
been carved into our present poise of tormented association and
dawning collective power without the sufferings of billions of
lives. That struggle was a necessary thing&mdash;so far as I can
apprehend any necessity in things. It was in effect an immense
surgery. It was not indeed an immense cruelty, for the sufferings
of a million people are no greater than the sufferings of a single
soul; such things do not aggregate because there exists no central
brain to aggregate them; nevertheless, the operation was immense.
The chloroform of a thousand illusions and distractions was
unavoidable, but now those fumes pass off&mdash;and may pass. The
price of power has been mainly paid. Where once the ape lurked in
the thicket there are fields and houses and the lowly multitudinous
rich material for a secure, powerful, and generous society.</p>

<p>It is possible now so to launch human lives and so to care for
them that they may be balanced and serene, full and creative,
eventful and happy, from beginning to end. And, moreover, these
human lives we set going can be so directed that death will no
longer appear as defeat; they will rather broaden out and
<i>flow</i> on into the general stream of perception and effort
than end, in any tragic and conclusive sense, at all. We are living
in a cardinal change of phase in the history of conscious and
wilful being. For the first occasion, it may be, in the whole
process of space and time, a star of conscious and immortal
resolution has been born out of the dreaming inconsecutive
sufferings of animal life into the night of matter.</p>

<p>But we are still begotten carelessly, and we are still foolishly
prepared for life.</p>

<p>When I go back among my memories I find the partially effaced
evidences of profound conflicts. These are largely effaced, because
that is the self- protective habit of the mind. But infancy and
childhood are normally distressful for human beings. They are not
necessarily such happy phases as they seem to be in the case of a
kitten or a puppy. Much of my subsequent life, though it has been
full of activities and satisfactions and the liveliest interest,
has often been far from happy. There were long phases of sustained
strain and dissatisfaction. And yet I have been one of the
fortunate few. I have had physical vigour, I have had worldly
success, I am comparatively rich, and have won through to freedom
and monetary power, and it is this that gives me the measure of the
common lot. What has distressed me must have distressed and
distresses most people more than it has done me. My difference is
only in my luck and in my escape to consolations and security. If
life has not been wholly happy for me, if it has been troubled and
vexed, then much more so must it be for most of the people about
me.</p>

<p>When I probe among these faded and suppressed recollections of
the unpleasant side of my past, I find among the early scars the
traces of a queer instinctive struggle against instruction and
direction. As a little child I had already a lively and curious
mind. I wanted to learn, but I wanted to learn in my own way and
for my own ends. But this I was not allowed to do. So that from an
early stage I seem to have been protecting my personality against
invasion almost as strenuously as I was attempting to add to its
powers. Instinctively I disbelieved in the good faith of my
teachers.</p>

<p>I believe most children have a similar instinctive disbelief. At
the bottom of my heart I realised that the teachers did not
particularly want to teach me; that they found the job irksome, got
through it as easily as possible, and cared scarcely at all whether
they distorted me by their reluctant and insufficient direction and
the pressure of their compulsions. They hated me as the keystone of
a hated but unavoidable job, and subconsciously they sought to
injure me. They, too, had personalities in defensive revolt.</p>

<p>My lesson-times with my governesses and tutors were full of
petty malignant conflicts of will. It was so with most of my
schoolmasters. Their work, I knew, was jaded and insincere. Gilkes
at Dulwich I came to believe in, Wallas, and one or two others, but
even under these exemplary teachers I was jealous of direction.</p>

<p>The same self-protective conflict went on against the customs
and procedure of out-of-school life. Why did they shove all these
good manners on me? My recalcitrant soul objected obscurely but
perceptibly. Why should they be so insistent that it was for
<i>my</i> good that I had to keep these observances? And new
clothes? Things that altered one's feeling of oneself and made the
mirror unfamiliar. Were these changes really for me or for the sake
of some hostile subjugating outer power? There was always a fuss)
persuasions, resistance) slappings, and scolding) and when I had
new clothes, until I was ten or twelve, and even after that I was
darkly suspicious about them for some years.</p>

<p>At first I was horribly frightened about religion. Then, long
before I had come to clear-headed scepticism, I became incredulous
and began to detest the people who were trying to put this
dismaying obsession upon me. I cannot remember a time in my boyhood
when I really believed that a clergyman went about his business in
good faith. It was his business, and a jolly rotten business I
thought it was.</p>

<p>And as I grew up I began to apprehend the confused dangerousness
of life and to perceive that I was being driven into the scrimmage
anyhow, that though my mother and stepfather made large, copious
gestures of concern, yet at the bottom of their hearts they did not
care very much what kicks and shames, what subjugations,
servitudes, and frustrations awaited me in the struggle.</p>

<p>Aided by Dickon, encouraged by one or two teachers, helped by my
astounding luck, I found myself doing intensely congenial work
before I was nineteen, but I went through enough conflict, anger,
and anxiety to realise what must be the obscure inner tragedy of a
lad who, without any special gift or advantage, is sent to drudge
in a shop or office or mine, just when his intelligence is
awakening to the interests of life at large. That is the common
lot. That is what happens to ninety-nine out of a hundred
youngsters in a modern civilised community. They are pushed into
work they do not want to do, and it cramps and cripples them. It is
the meanest cant to pretend that we people who succeed are in some
way different from the general run, that "they" don't feel it as we
did, that "they" are really interested by subjections and routines
and duties that would bore us of the finer strain to death. Going
to work is a misery and a tragedy for the great multitude of boys
and girls who have to face it. Suddenly they see their lives
plainly defined as limited and inferior.</p>

<p>It is a humiliation so great that they cannot even express the
hidden bitterness of their souls.</p>

<p>But it is there. It betrays itself in derision. I do not believe
that it would be possible for contemporary economic life to go on
if it were not for the consolations of derision. I suppose nearly
all servants and employed people find it necessary to ridicule
their employers and directors. They find it necessary to divest
these superiors of their superiority, give them undignified
nicknames, detect their subtler frustrations, and then with a gasp
of relief, ha, ha! life becomes tolerable again.</p>

<p>The root of all laughter lies in that whim of Fate which in the
course of a brief million years or so made of the fiercest and
loneliest species of animals the most socially involved of all
living things. The adaptations are complex and clumsy and lie
heavily upon us. We live under the tension of an imposed respect
for our fellow-creatures. When that tension snaps, when the
compelling orator sits down on his hat, or when the neatly dressed
dandy struts defying our depreciation, all unconscious of the
flypaper he picked up from his last chair, we shout with joy at the
release. And none of us likes to be laughed at, because we feel
that thereby our protection from our fellow-creatures is stripped
from us. Our claim upon their respect is torn and flung back at us.
There is sublimated rebellion and menace in all laughter.</p>

<p>Dickon and I in the days of our youth were both great laughers.
We showed our teeth at the toils of existence about us, at the
religious fears we struggled to escape, at the dull pomp and
circumstance of monarchy and Jaw, at the vast solid arrogance of
well-off people. I have told of our standing jests of Mr. G. and
the Boops. I have told how for days we hardly spoke to each other
except to talk facetious nonsense. Almost all our reading beyond
the bright circle of our special interests was in funny books, and
all we really cared for in public entertainments was the
<i>comic</i> part. We read Mark Twain and Max Adler; Jerome K.
Jerome rose upon us and seemed to us a star of the first magnitude;
Dickon and I were both married men and very busy when W. W. Jacobs
began to write, but my discovery of him was a matter to tell Dickon
with haste and enthusiasm. More laughter we sought, and yet more.
We had, and I believe the whole human race in bondage has, an
unappeasable craving for laughter. Nearly all our world could be
made digestible with mockery, and it was intolerable to us in any
other mode. But there was one thing we two could not laugh about,
could not talk about, and which, indeed, we never tried to talk
about, and that was the immense urgency of sex.</p>

<p>So far I have been able to tell of the forms and quality of my
world without very much more than a passing allusion to sexual
things. But now I must begin to deal with that vivid and
disconcerting reality. From my late days at school onward I was
tormented by sexual desire. It was not desire for any particular
person; it was plain unassigned lust, and the tension grew with
every year of my life. And interwoven with it, a thing springing up
with it in me, and not, I am certain, derived to any considerable
extent from teaching or other outer influence, was a feeling of
intense shame and an impulse to conceal this burning appetite.</p>

<p>I do not know how far I was abnormal, or how far it is the
common lot to be thus obsessed throughout adolescence. I can only
tell my own story. I think perhaps Dickon and I were both rather
more reserved and restrained than the average; our circumstances
reinforced our natural character and developed our distrust of our
fellow-creatures very early. I did not betray this red secret, I
know, to any living being, nor did I attach my desires to any
living being. I do not remember that I ever looked to any human
being for their gratification except in the most transitory
fashion. I kissed the servant at my lodgings once in a sudden
tumultuous fashion, and was instantly disgusted with myself and
ashamed. She was, poor girl, so manifestly a substitute for
something else, with her untidy hair and soiled apron. My desires
were developed in relation to nude pictures and statuary, they were
stimulated by monstrous dreams, they were directed by glowing
imaginations that arose unbidden. And since I was convinced that
they were essentially enervating desires, I kept myself, except for
the most incidental lapses, under a rigorous restraint.</p>

<p>That sexual desire arises of itself in young people in their
early teens, that it is something quite distinct from personal
love, and that it may never become closely associated with personal
love, are facts that run altogether counter to the romantic
travesty of life upon which most current moral judgments are based.
Edwin, in a state of spotless purity, encounters the lovely and if
possible even blanker Angelina. Innocent toyings lead to the naIve
discovery of passion. Which burns, without heat or smoke, with an
instinctive moderation, and Edwin and Angelina are happy ever
after. So it is supposed to happen, and generation has followed
generation with the strangest, richest, most terrifying,
distressing, and debasing tumult in their blood and in their moods
and dreams, and a bright pretence of never having heard of the
business in their general deportment.</p>

<p>I doubt if there was anything in my behaviour during those
strained years before my marriage to betray, except to a skilled
observer, the tormenting distraction within. My work suffered from
phases of inattention, and I had moods of sullen and sometimes
frantic anger. At times the drive in my nerves would summon up
alluring visions of sweet, lovely, and abandoned women, and I would
count the scanty money I had available and leave my work and prowl
about the dim London roads and streets looking for a prostitute,
and when I approached one her poor painted charms and cheap
advances would seem so repulsive that I would quicken my pace and
hurry past her in a commotion between desire and disgust. I would
wander for hours in that fashion, and return fatigued and footsore
and still incapable of restful sleep.</p>

<p>I do not know if this sort of thing happened to Dickon. I can
only guess. We never betrayed our sexual life to one another. We
were too close together and unable to escape from each other to
risk even the beginning of confidences. To this day Dickon and I
have never talked about sex.</p>

<p>I want to insist upon the fact that this wolfish impulse, with
its disposition to carry me out with it and prowl in the twilight
with me, did not lead me to fall in love with anyone and was on the
whole a barrier to my falling in love with anyone. It was something
much deeper, more animal, more elemental in my being, pre-human,
something a tom-cat could understand. There were women students at
the college, some very clever and attractive; there were friendly
girl students in the Art College near by; they seemed aloof from
passion and preoccupied with minor interests; I did not associate
them with my hot desires. They had an inordinate liking for walking
about the Museum and making tea and conversing in groups after the
tea was made. Such entertainment offered small solace to my
feverish cravings. I can guess now that they were not so serene as
they seemed. And no doubt I seemed to them also cool and detached,
a very self-controlled young man reputed to be good at molecular
physics.</p>

<p>Since those days fiction and conversation in England have grown
much more outspoken, but I doubt if that increasing frankness has
done so much as people pretend to assuage this part of the stress
of youth. That was an age of repression and concealment, yes; and
to bring a thing into the light is the first step to dealing with
it sanely; but mere frankness and exposure alone will no more cure
these troubles than they will heal a broken leg. So far as I can
judge, humanity suffers from periodic waves of putting too much
clothing on and then of taking too much off. From round about the
end of the century up to the present time we have been flinging
aside everything, from top-hats and collars and neck-wraps and
boots and shoes, down at last to the fig-leaves. And the breadth
and freedom of our conversation, and particularly the conversation
of some of our clever young ladies, leaves nothing unspoken and
everything to be desired. But the questing beast does not fly from
the sight of itself; lust does not evaporate under the influence of
chatter. Lust remains lust and is going to be a monstrously
troublesome thing to human beings, whether we hide everything and
never speak of it, never name it, never think of it, or whether we
decorate our nurseries and elementary schools with nothing but
undraped marble and wax models, and treat all conversation that is
not directly sexual as improper. I have studied these affairs, not
always theoretically, through nearly forty of my fifty-nine years
of life, and I am inclined to think that between the utmost
frankness and the severest concealment there is very little
practical difference. It is a matter of usage.</p>

<p>Some there are, going a little further than the frank exposure
school&mdash;moral homaeopathists&mdash;who would allay by
gratification. There is something to be said for that doctrine; it
abolishes most of the morbid repressions and shifts the stresses
from the deeper to the more superficial strata of the mind, but it
does not end the trouble. I am for moderation, for moderate
gratification, but it is not always easy to arrange or define
moderation. It is in the nature of sexual desire to be inordinate.
That is the crux of this perennial perplexity of our species. That
is the justification of decency and restraint.</p>

<p>This is a thing that I now see I realised instinctively in my
youth, and which is present and very important in all adolescents.
Sexual enterprise grows with success. It clamours for more. Give it
an inch and it takes an ell. Permit the song of Pan to be sung and
presently it will be demanded with variations. Nothing complicates
so easily and rapidly. Nothing is so steadfastly aggressive.
Nothing is so ready to enhance itself with insane fantasies.
Nothing under check or defeat is so apt to invade and pervert other
fields of interest and take substitutes and imitations rather than
accept complete denial. I can quite understand the disposition of
most churches and religions to fight sexual desire from the
beginning, to kill it at the door rather than fight it when it is
already half in possession of the house.</p>

<p>A point that I think is very important if one is to see this
business clearly is that I never really identified my lust with
myself in these early phases. So far as I can ascertain how matters
stand with other young people, that is the normal case. I can best
express my state of mind by saying that I felt it to be a damned
thing that had come in me. It did not seem to be myself as my
passionate desire to carry on research in crystallography and
molecular physics was myself, or as my care for my future or my
affection for my brother and my few friends was myself. St. Austin
has drawn the most interesting theological deductions from this
autonomous detachment of carnal desire from the essential
personality, and it is plain how easily it must have led to a
belief in diabolical possession.</p>

<p>If anything was needed to clinch our belief in the naturalists'
explanations of man's origins, it would be this extravagance of our
sexual side. No designing mind, no mind, at any rate, with a
glimmering of human reason, would have produced a sort of life so
dominated and swamped by sexual desire as we are, nor have
permitted that desire to escape so easily from fruition to quite
fruitless gratifications. But a mechanical process whose variations
of method were subjected to no other criterion but survival would
plainly have produced just such a state of affairs as exists. Only
such a process could have made an unconditional clinging to life,
hunger, and an insensate direction of every accumulation of energy
into the reproductive channel, even when that channel led almost
certainly to nothingness, the crude elements of existence. The
billion futile pollen-grains of the cedar-trees are no more
astonishing than the futile cravings, love-makings, couplings, and
sexual tumult of human beings. "What matter the waste," says old
Nature, "if there is a chance of one pollen-grain reaching an ovum?
What else do you think you are for? Why should I economise? What is
economy? I neither need you nor hate you. Take your chance. More of
you. More of you to live or more of you to die. What does it matter
to me?"</p>

<p>So it is that for the begetting and bearing of three or four
children, a matter of a few minutes in the life of a man and of a
few months in the life of a woman, the sexual shape is imposed upon
almost all their activities. No other shape has any appeal to
Nature. We are driven by imagination, feverish wishes, rivalries,
hostilities, hates, resentments, all arising out of sex; we dress
for sex, we disport ourselves for sex, it drenches our art, our
music, our dreams. For that much practical outcome our whole lives
are obsessed. And if it were not for that obsession, for its hopes
and excitements and collateral developments, I do not know where
the great majority of lives would find the driving force to
continue.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-2" name="b4-2"></a>§ 2. THE CREWES AT HOME</h2>

<p class="first">SO I remember my adolescence and my young manhood
as a period of hidden struggle and sustained anxiety, mitigated by
ridicule and laughter. Careless youth indeed! Within was this
ever-recurrent, alluring, and terrifying attack of sex upon my
freedom and activities; without was the dangerous world, the
hostility of the tradition of the Old Man to youth, the social
obstacles and imperatives, the powers of direction and the powers
of denial and restraint that manifestly meant to trip up and
capture and subjugate the vast majority of my generation to lives
of subservience, self-effacement, frustration, and toil.</p>

<p>I had an objective clearly before me, which I believed to be the
realisation of my essential self; I wanted to saturate myself with
immediate experimental knowledge of molecular science and to give
all my energies to its prosecution, and I knew that I had to win
and hold, against a mass of adverse influences, the necessary
position and opportunity. Research in those days was even more
scantily endowed and permitted than it is to-day. But I had got my
foot in the door, so to speak, and I think I could have won through
to an assured place if I had kept myself steadfast and
concentrated. But I could not do so. Sex caught me unawares one day
and wrenched away the mastery of my life from science. I fell into
a passion of desire and I married. It was as if the walls of my
laboratory collapsed, and my inStruments and notebooks were
overturned and scattered by a rush and invasion of stormy,
commonplace, ill-conceived purposes. I married for the sake of a
kiss, and I made a great entanglement for myself in life.</p>

<p>I do not know whether even now I have emerged from the
developments and consequences of that great entanglement. It
diverted me altogether from the narrow scientific trail I had
intended to pursue. It turned me into the paths I have followed. I
fought my way through it to this very different sort of freedom
that I now enjoy. It is, perhaps, a broader freedom. But it is an
encumbered freedom; it is not aloof and serene like the freedom of
science. All the problems and cares of life seemed enmeshed with
it.</p>

<p>I dislike having to tell this story of my marriage. I perceive I
have delayed it as long as possible; that I have, for example, told
almost everything I have to tell about my brother first, very
largely because of this reluctance. There is no sound reason now
why I should not face the facts of this the most remote phase of my
past&mdash;for it seems real much remoter than my
childhood&mdash;but I have suppressed it so long that the habit of
suppression has been established in me. I find it difficult to
recover the facts in their order, and about many of my moods I must
needs be as speculative now as though I told of the acts of some
one quite outside myself.</p>

<p>After Dickon went to Bloomsbury I was very lonely for a time in
Brompton, and then the gaps of time his departure left me began to
be filled by other people. The social life of the South Kensington
student in those days was hardly organised at all; there was no
Students' Union as yet and no tennis clubs nor suchlike facilities
for meeting. There was not even a students' refreshment-room. There
was a small debating society very much in the hands of a little
gang of biological and geological students, from whom I got my
first ideas of socialism. I scraped acquaintance .with a youngster
of my own age named Crewe, who was also doing advanced work in
physics, and with him I began to walk and gossip in the park and
gardens, and I became fairly intimate with one or two of the
debating society men. Crewe had a brother in the art school, and
introduced me through him to that more picturesque side of South
Kensington life.</p>

<p>The London art student in those days was still only very
imitatively Bohemian; he was very new to the art of being an art
student; but there were Morris dresses and florid ties and velvet
jackets and casual meals in studios and a research for
conversational brilliance. Presently I found myself rather shyly a
visitor at the Crewes' house.</p>

<p>The Crewes occupied a large, ramshackle, grey, semidetached
house in a road that branched out of the Fulham Road; though I went
there scores of times, I cannot now remember either the name of the
road or the number of the house. They had gatherings there every
Sunday afternoon and evening; open house and a cold supper with
sandwiches and salad and stewed fruit. The paternal Crewe was a
very old, mooning gentleman with a long, thin beard, who seemed
always to be standing about with his hands in his pockets, wishing
he was somewhere else. He had kept a private school and retired.
The presiding spirit was Mrs. Crewe. She was much younger than he,
very pink and very ample, with a shapely wrist, a harp, strange,
elegant gestures, and a remote allusive style of conversation
acquired from the novels of Mr. George Meredith. She was a woman of
letters; she wrote charming little love stories and children's
stories in the magazines, and poems and criticism. She did not get
much money for these things, she made you understand; so far she
was among the elect. She loved youth and youthful hopes; she had a
devouring sympathy and a great craving for confidences. She was
constantly trying to "draw one out," as the phrase went, but as
there was very little in the depths of my mind except quartz
fibres, certain little riddles about the relations of various
triclinic crystals to their <i>monoclinic</i> cousins, and an
impatient but very formless rage with nature and the social order,
it was very difficult for me to respond as freely as I wished to
her kindness.</p>

<p>She wrung from me that I had scientific ambitions, and that for
her meant that I wanted to be "like" Professor Huxley or Lord
Kelvin. That I could possibly want to know things without
dramatising myself as a copy of some eminent savant never entered
her head. And she was restlessly eager to find out that I had some
one, a girl necessarily, who "inspired" my ambitions, although I
should have thought that feminine inspiration was biological rather
than molecular. I evaded her probings&mdash;sometimes, I fear, a
little ungraciously&mdash;and it is only now in the retrospect that
I realise how sedulously she must have restrained her appetite for
confidences in the matter of my father and mother. And it was also
an alleviation of her inquiries that the influence of Meredith
robbed them of any brutal directness.</p>

<p>She irritated me, she embarrassed me, and I liked her&mdash;I
don't know why&mdash;very much. She liked me too. I would find her
very bright little brown eyes seeking me across the room, and her
funny round face, under the tremendous cap she wore, bobbing and
nodding to me, with an effect of encouragement and
reassurance&mdash;I cannot imagine what about.</p>

<p>She would even beam deep understandings at me while she was
plucking her harp strings and exhibiting her Vic, tori an wrist.
Always every Sunday she played the harp for a while and all the
talk was hushed. And one of us would always be caught to sit on the
little stool close beside the harpist. But usually this fell to
some unwary newcomer who had not discovered the imminence of
harping. He had to look rapt.</p>

<p>"Young Sir Philosopher still brooding over his crucibles," she
would cry across the room to me.</p>

<p>"Beware the witch's warning!" And she would shake her finger.
"There are cauldrons as well as crucibles, Sir Alchemist."</p>

<p>I would pretend to understand what she meant. "Not only the
stars can twinkle," she would throw at me and turn for some other
victim.</p>

<p>I had never before encountered such perplexing brilliance.</p>

<p>All sorts of people came to these Sundays of hers. One or two
were quite well-known literary and dramatic people, people whose
names you saw on programmes or at the bottom of signed articles,
but mostly the company consisted of beginners, some of them
manifestly late starters, but as portly and important and whiskered
as the well-known. There were early Fabians and eccentric thinkers.
A modestly resolute man in a drab kilt with wildernesses of hairy
knee was frequent; he was Erse or Gaelic or one of those things,
and he eXplained to me on one occasion that properly he ought to be
wearing a broadsword. He felt "incomplete," he said, without it.
One evening Mrs. Crewe's conversation was exceptionally delirious;
"red hair from green meals," she said, "warbling his Dublin
woodnotes wild. That delicious accent!" and I became aware of Mr.
Bernard Shaw in his celebrated Jaeger costume talking in a corner.
At that time he was a lean young music critic with an odd novel or
so to his credit, giving few intimations as yet of the dramatic
career that is now culminating so magnificently&mdash;if even now
it is culminating&mdash;in <i>Saint Joan</i>.</p>

<p>But the larger element was undistinguished youth. There were
three Crewe girls, each with a large circle of intimates, and both
the sons also brought in their friends.</p>

<p>And often youth prevailed to such an extent that the pretence of
a <i>conversazione</i> was abandoned and we played juvenile games.
We would play dumb-crambo or charades, and in these charades a
certain inventiveness I have, and a certain capacity to act
preposterously and gravely, gave me a kind of leadership.
Dumb-crambo is an inferior entertainment to fully developed
charades, and after a time the latter banished the former from the
Crewe household and grew into a kind of consecutiveness. We
contrived to make many of them into quaint little three, four, and
five act plays. Those were the absurd days of the British theatre;
Barrie and Shaw had yet to dawn upon us; even the mockery of
Wilde's <i>Importance of Being Ernest</i> had not relIeved the
pressure of the well-made play, and two leaden masters, Henry
Arthur Jones and Pinero, to whom no Dunciad has ever done justice,
produced large, slow, pretentious three-act affairs that were
rather costume shows than dramas, with scenery like the
advertisements of fashionable resorts, the realest furniture and
the unrealest passions and morals it is possible to conceive. This
sort of thing lent itself to joyous burlesque. I remember we spent
one very happy evening in the big ramshackle drawing-room with the
folding doors upstairs, reading and rehearsing a play called
<i>Michael and His Lost Angel</i>, by one or other of those twin
glories of that departed age. I was Michael, very dark and high and
gloomy, as far as possible in the manner of Mr. George Alexander,
and there was misconduct "off stage" in a lighthouse or down the
barrel of a big gun or in some such bed of roses.</p>

<p>The Crewe gatherings went on until the schools broke up in the
summer, and in May and June they flowed out into the garden, a
town-stained garden of gravel and plane-trees, which owed whatever
magic it possessed to twilight and darkness, assisted by perhaps a
dozen Japanese lanterns.</p>

<p>And it was in that garden one moonlight night that Clara was
suddenly transfigured to beauty and mystery, and that we whispered
very close to one another and hesitated and kissed. For the first
time in my life I knew what it was to hold a sweet and living body
in my arms and drink the passion of a kiss.</p>

<p>In that moment all the diffused disturbance of my life became
concentrated upon one desire, to possess Clara. I held her to me,
but abruptly her responsive passion ceased, and she wriggled out of
my embrace.</p>

<p>The door had opened and some one was coming out of the house
into the garden. "It's late," she said. "They will miss us. Let us
go in."</p>

<p>We two went back into the gas-light and the belated dispersal of
the party with scarcely a word more, but I knew that we were
affianced. Clara, now that I could see her face, seemed to be lost
in some remote, faintly triumphant dream. She did not look at me. I
do not think she looked directly at me again that evening. Our
hostess was in the passage and saw us come in.</p>

<p>"Is it a flush of warmth at last," she whispered darkly, "on Sir
Galahad's white shield?"</p>

<p>I said I had had a very pleasant evening and asked whether I
might come again when the Crewes returned in September.</p>

<p>"I feared the dawn would never come," said Mrs. Crewe.
"<i>Now!</i> Ah!&mdash;you will be human."</p>

<p>No doubt I made some sound like a reply, but I forget that now.
I remember I wanted to walk to Clara's home with her, but she was
entangled with a party of cousins, so instead I went off by myself
for a long prowl in the flooding moonlight along the Serpentine and
across Hyde Park.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-3" name="b4-3"></a>§ 3. INADVERTENT MARRIAGE</h2>

<p class="first">I CANNOT recall my first meeting with Clara. She
had emerged by degrees from the little bunch of young people who
frequented the Crewes' house. I would find her looking at me or
fluttering to my side. She intimated a distinctive friendliness by
a multitude of trivial preferences and attentions. She was a
dark-haired, slender, restless, talkative girl, with aquiline
features and hazel eyes. At first I had not thought her very
pretty. Until this great desire to possess her seized upon me I had
learnt nothing of her parentage or her worldly circumstances.</p>

<p>Now here it is that I find my story most difficult to tell.
Except for one or two vivid memories, I really do not know how I
felt during the phases of this love affair. I suppose I must call
it a love affair, and I suppose my state was what is called being
"in love," but I cannot for the life of me recall any such moods of
tenderness and self-forgetfulness as a romantic tradition requires
of a lover. I will admit that the record has been thrust aside and
out of the light and out of the way for many years; it has its
pages blurred and discoloured; much may be absolutely forgotten.
But it seems to me now that I wanted Clara with a simple, hard
desire to own her and keep her. And I am in doubt whether she felt
more towards me than a reciprocal extravagance of desire.</p>

<p>Perhaps while one can still remember tenderly one still loves,
and love only ceases with the effacement of tender memories. The
effacement of memories about love relationships and acts of love
may be exceptionally easy in the mind; there may be some biological
reason for that. Scenery, a great variety of casual incidents,
chains of reasoning, passages from books, live far more vividly for
me than what I am convinced must have been high moments of intense
sensuous and emotional experience. I am sure there is something
lost altogether between Clara and myself, and that this hard story
I tell is a mere framework of facts, a skeleton robbed of all
living substance and significance.</p>

<p>Apparently at this time there were in my mind two sets of
motives so entirely inconsistent and incompatible that I sit and
ask myself whether I am not seeing all this phase of my past
through some distorting medium. There was my passion for research
which called for all my best energies and my most lucid and
energetic hours, and there was this new passion for Clara, which
also was bound to develop into a whole-time job, and yet for more
than a year at least I do not seem to have realised any
contradiction in these matters. I seem to have gone right on with
both, and to have been sincerely perplexed and astonished when at
last their divergence took so practical a form that it was no
longer possible for me to ignore it.</p>

<p>In some way surely I must have sought to reconcile them. I doubt
if I could have adopted Mrs. Crewe's idea that the desire for the
constant companionship, kissing, fondling, and embracing of a young
woman constituted an "inspiration," that it disposed and empowered
me to speculate deeply and subtly upon the constitution of atoms
and the nature of electrical charges. But I may have bad a
persuasion that these love exercises gave pride and energy and
peace of mind.</p>

<p>I do not remember that I ever talked very much to Clara of the
work I was doing. I recall her on one occasion when we were at
Deal, praising the beauty of a lighthouse, and saying that with its
steady light, its smooth and certain rotation, its beautifully
adjusted mirrors, it was "like science." I was extraordinarily
pleased at her saying that. I was so pleased that it is plain she
did not often say things like that. But generally our nearest
approach to my scientific concerns was the canvassing of the
characters of Professor Guthrie and Dr. Boys and others of the
Royal College workers in those days, and speculations about the
fortune of Lord Kelvin, and the possibility of making artificial
precious stones, and so forth. The thought that I might make
diamonds dazzled her. On the side of my socialism we were better
able to meet. She, too, called herself a socialist, but she
approached it rather as a campaign of benevolence towards the
"slums"&mdash;supplemented by a general preference for wool
garments, red ties, art fabrics, and archaic oak furniture.</p>

<p>If I can remember no moods of actual lovingness between us, I
can at least say that we were greatly interested in and desirous of
each other. We must have gone for walks together, walks and talks,
from first to last, for many hundreds of miles. She had read much
more widely than I had in the literature of the time, and she
instructed me in the study of Meredith and Hardy and Walter Besant
and Swinburne and the Pre-Raphaelites. She introduced me to the
writings of William Morris and the early Bernard Shaw, the Shaw of
the <i>Star</i> days. She was keen on pictures, keen on music, keen
about the theatre. She was keen about the movements and characters
of public people; keen about fashions and social events. So keen
she was upon so many things that at times her whirling conversation
seemed to whistle like a blade through the air about me. She made
me feel thick and slow and underinformed. This lively diversity of
her attention was mainly due to the fact that she had no objective
in particular&mdash;unless it was her adventure as a sexual animal
in the world. She was acutely aware how literature, art, the drama,
and every social subject turned upon sex as a door turns on its
hinges, and towards all other things except that hinge she was an
active amateur.</p>

<p>She acted; she was almost on the edge of things theatrical, but
she had no intention of becoming an actress; she sketched cleverly,
but she had no intention of following art. When there were
elections she became an excited political helper, but she pursued
no sustained political aim, and though she was poor and keenly
interested in success, she made no movement towards business
activities. She had, indeed, no intention of doing anything
seriously and steadily but living as a sexual consumer, and talking
about it, and she approached life with an immense receptivity. She
was a feminist after the manner of those ancient days, the days of
George Egerton and <i>The Woman Who Did</i>.</p>

<p>Soon after that first kiss of ours she took me home to see her
"people." They lived in a rather crowded little house in a square
near Earls Court Station. There was an obscurely silent
father&mdash;their name, by-the- by, was Allbut&mdash;who came in
at odd times, and did not seem to like me; he was an architect, I
learnt at once, and later on I realised he was also a speculative
builder. He was one of those people who have quite a lot of money
that is always "locked up" in something or other and meanwhile the
household "carries on."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allbut was very like Clara, except that in her a certain
Mediterranean flash of dark alertness became distinctively Jewish.
She seemed to be running her household with an acute watchfulness
towards material things and an evasion of any control of her four
fuzzy-haired daughters. Clara was the second of this band of
sisters. They displayed on this opening occasion a cheerful harmony
that was, I found later, exceptional with them. They all talked
with incredible rapidity and a tremendous <i>savoir faire</i>, so
that all I had to do was to bear myself meekly under their swift,
critical inspection. We played a game suitable for harpies, called
demon-patience, a game of pouncing and snatching in a snowstorm of
cards, and I got a new measure of the limitations of the
philosophical mind. I was so inferior at first that my masculine
self-conceit took refuge in a puerile burlesque of myself.</p>

<p>How different was the outlook of those girls and myself, and how
unaware all of us were of those very profound differences! To them
I was Clara's captive, one of her captives, for they knew, even if
I did not, that she had other possibilities, and my role was to be
retained captive so long as it suited Clara to retain me, and then
either to be discarded or to be converted skilfully and surely into
a secure and permanent basis for Clara's miscellaneous keenness,
whenever and if ever it became desirable to effect that conversion.
They also were doing their best to secure a selection of
practicable captives. They appraised me; they petted me and drew me
out; I suspect they speculated secretly whether it was possible and
worth while to filch me from Clara's bundle to their own
collection.</p>

<p>My reading of my part was entirely different. I was, I conceived
it, the masterful male, recipient of Clara's furtive but extremely
effective endearments, conqueror of her heart and instincts,
aspiring to be her kindly owner and&lt; ruler with the privilege of
soothing and entertaining myself with her easy delightfulness
whenever I chose. Her physical docility, her lively attention, was
the cause of an enormous pride in me. She ruffled my hair and
called me "Flosopherlost" when my demon-patience was particularly
disastrous; she seemed unable to keep her quick hands off me, and
all four of them evidently found my ineptitude a very promising and
endearing trait.</p>

<p>I remember that first afternoon very vividly; the rather dark
room, the circular table from which the cloth had been removed, the
bare arms, the soft glowing faces close to mine, Clara's hair
sometimes brushing my cheek as she reached across me with a card.
Doris, the third sister, was the quickest of all. "Stop&mdash;Out!
no you <i>don't!</i>" she would cry, return some belated card to
its player, and cut short the pelting struggle.</p>

<p>Later on I stole an evening or so from my work to study this
demon-patience. I was not used to cards, but I perceived that it
was absurd for a fairly good mathematician to be unready with the
groupings and variations of four sets of thirteen cards. I drilled
myself a little, thought out a few principles of action, and
afterwards made up in science what I lacked in speed. Until at last
I could truncate a hand with "Stop&mdash;Out!" as often as Doris
and win a hundred up against her.</p>

<p>I was rewarded for these infidelities to my work by Clara's
brightly expressed approval. Doris was amazed and dismayed at
certain tactical inventions of mine; she would scream and lose her
head as I slapped down an accumulated series of cards, humming
distractingly as I did so, and Clara would slacken her play and
come near to applause. It was evident her sisters had pronounced me
stupid after my first début, and that it pleased her to see me
vindicate myself.</p>

<p>For more than a year Clara filled all my waking thoughts that
were not given to my work, and she domInated my dreams and
reveries. All my vague and dispersed sex fantasies gave place to
the thought of her. She was a very exciting girl by nature, bold in
her thoughts and for that very remote and decorous time very bold
in her talk and acts. We found a thousand opportunities in that
ill-lit old Kensington for kisses and embraces, and she taught me
everything that there was to be known in the fine art of caressing.
For that she had a natural genius. It is wonderful what lurking
places and kindly shelters there are to be found in streets and
parks and house-porches and passages and gardens that seem quite
open and exposed to unimpassioned eyes. Since no other girl now
existed for me I could not imagine that any other man existed for
her. And she volunteered the information time after time that none
did.</p>

<p>After a time I defied the possible disapproval of my landlady,
and Clara ventured with books and parcels and messages to my
lodgings for bouts of philandering. I can see again the little
circle of light upon my scattered notes under my shaded lamp as we
stand body to body in the shadow.</p>

<p><i>"Shall we turn the key in the door?"</i> she whispers.</p>

<p>And in the summer she went with her mother and sisters to St.
Margaret's Bay, and I went to Deal so that I could walk over and
discover them by accident and share their bathing tent and join
them in the sea. Clara and her sisters were good swimmers, and we
would float side by side or bask on the beach in the sun together,
and in the night I would lie in bed and bite my wrists and arms
black and blue with the violence of my desire for that wet body in
its closely clinging dress. She had a project which was never
realised of a great swim by moonlight. It stirred my imagination
greatly, and in my reveries we struck out into the unknown, into
the darkness further and further from shore&mdash;and, at last,
faint with effort and delight, turned with our arms wide open
towards each other. And sank.</p>

<p>But there were various other youths and men about, and they made
it very difficult for Clara and me to get at each other alone. A
certain Billy Parker was particularly obnoxious. His elder brother
was affianced to Marjorie, the elder sister, and tIe had a stupid
proprietary way with Clara, hovering about her, joining in her
conversations. She assured me he bored her to death, and that when
they were alone together she said the most humiliating things to
him and praised me continually. Clara, not to lose a moment of me,
would walk part of the way with me back to Deal, and Billy would
always insist on coming with us, so that she should not return to
St. Margaret's Bay alone. She would take my arm up to the parting
and do most of the talking to me, and then as she and he went off
back: she would take his arm, no doubt to hold him the more firmly
while she drove the barbed humiliations home. And there was a Mr.
Crashaw staying at St. Margaret's Bay, quite a middle-aged man, a
friend of her father's, she said, but evidently focussed upon her.
He had twice asked her to marry him, she told me.</p>

<p>"I'd send him packing altogether," said Clara, "if it wasn't for
his kindness to mother. You see, he's got no end of money."</p>

<p>Until that seaside holiday I had not been jealous of Clara nor
even very urgent to be finally engaged to her. Now an irrational
jealousy infected me, and also an extreme impatience to possess her
wholly. But she would not be engaged to me until there was an
immediate prospect of marriage. "You can't doubt I love you," she
said, "but life <i>is</i> life. Marjorie marries Fred Parker this
September, and then mother will be at me to get out of Doris' way.
Night and day she'll be at me."</p>

<p>"But you don't mean&mdash;!" I was breathless.</p>

<p>"It's tragic, Billy. It's horrible. How can I love an old man
like that? How can I endure him? After your kisses. And babies!
Little old babies they'd be! Oh! don't let me think of it, Billy!
Don't make me cry! Let us be happy while we can."</p>

<p>My soul went cold and white within me. I thought no more of
stresses in crystals for a time. I was filled with an angry
resolution to marry Clara. If research was to suffer it had to
suffer; if it stood in the way it had to be pushed aside. But I
still hoped, in spite of the manifest fact that I was now parting
my life into two unequal portions and giving the greater part to
Clara, to hold my own in science. The staff in the department of
physics was being rearranged, and I knew that I had merely to ask
in order to get a demonstratorship at three hundred and fifty
pounds a year. It would of course mean a serious invasion of the
time I could give to research, but there the job was, with a room
of its own separated by only a wood partition from the research
laboratory. Three hundred and fifty pounds was not so small an
income in those days as it would be now. In addition, there was the
hundred and sixty pounds a year coming from my mother. I went to
her to know how far that was the limit of my interest in my
father's savings. She was troubled in her mind by my questions, and
retired upstairs with a headache, but my stepfather took me into
the garden, and in the course of an hour or so of carefully worded
explanation made it clear that he found any increase impossible.
Still that made five hundred a year, and in those days one could
get charming little houses in Kensington and Fulham for fifty or
sixty pounds a year.</p>

<p>"We need not begin with a baby right away," said Clara. "I don't
want to do that," said I.</p>

<p>"I'm dying to bear you a child, Billy," she said. "But for a
time&mdash;we must wait. Your child. Your life. All your warm life
in me! But I'll be patient...."</p>

<p>I was prepared to be enormously patient. I could think of a
child only as something that would come between me and Clara.</p>

<p>"It ought to be enough," she said. "With management that ought
to be more than enough. You should see what mother has to get along
with at times."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-4" name="b4-4"></a>§ 4. LAIR IN DISORDER</h2>

<p class="first">IT was only after we had married that I began to
realise fully the extraordinary dislocations of motive that had
occurred in me. Sex, which had been like a foreign thing inserted
in my being, had become fully incorporated and was now the dominant
thing in my life. It had expanded from a physical need and
developed into a great power of self-assurance, a restless,
recurrent triumph in possession. My researches went on for a time
without notable deterioration. I had been so interested, so fertile
before Clara obsessed me, that my work had got an immense way upon
it. I ceased indeed to invent new things, to have flashes of
intuition, make dazzling and ecstatic leaps upon remote lurking
connections, leap out of bed at night to scribble sheet after sheet
of notes. But I had enough in hand to go on with fruitfully. To
that period belongs almost all the work upon the strains at the
contact of dissimilar crystalline masses in rocks that was
published between '92 and 1901, and secured my fellowship of the
Royal Society, and I worked out also in this time those methods of
examining by reflected light the ruptured faces of crystallised
alloys that later stood me in such good stead with Romer,
Steinhart, Crest and Co. It would have been imperceptible to anyone
else; for some time it was imperceptible to me that the mental
exaltation of the work had vanished.</p>

<p>I had grown up, I had become fully adult, I had consummated my
life; I had bought my young woman and held her exultant in my arms.
We made an excellent festival of each other. And presently we
emerged from our mutual preoccupation a little habituated to these
excitements with most of the problems of life still before us.</p>

<p>As I have told, we called upon Minnie and Dickon.</p>

<p>I suppose it was&mdash;if one may use a preposterous
metaphor&mdash; the intention of old Mother Nature that we should
now produce a number of children, and that while Clara bore them
and cherished them I should go hunting for more and more food and
comfort. That also was the tradition of human society. Some of the
children would live and some would die, and by the time the task
was done, our jokes exhausted and our tears dried, we should be
ready to depart. In those days it was not the custom to correlate
the large developments of human affairs with the things of the
individual life, and so it was only vaguely and personally that we
apprehended that children were no longer wanted in such abundance
as heretofore and that a new sanitation, new methods of education,
were lifting the burthen of complete reproductive specialisation
from womankind&mdash;and putting very little in its place. For a
time upon quite personal grounds we were resolved to have no
children. We had insufficient money; we had insufficient room; and
Clara, with her all-round intelligent amateurishness, was left very
much at loose ends. I, too, with my ill-paid, pure research was far
away from the traditions of the normal breadwinner. I needed time.
I was always in want of more hours, hours for thought, hours for
calculation and experiment. Clara on the other hand had nothing to
do with her time. She was quick and clever with her little home,
and through with its monotonies in an hour or so. Between our
seances of love-making, therefore, I was hurried and driven, and
she was slack and bored.</p>

<p>Though neither of us was nearly as avid of life as young people
seem to be nowadays, we were still sufficiently impatient to
develop the discordances of our position into very great
distresses. The once wonderful house in Edenbridge Square with a
green door and a brass knocker, brightly furnished with money that
Dickon had lent me, which had seemed at first the most delightful
of love-nests, became a lair from which we both absented ourselves
more and more. I would steal an increasing proportion of our waking
hours for the laboratory, and she would be driven abroad, almost
penniless, in her cheap but clever clothes, to find some amusement,
some excitement, for her vacant hours. For a time she came to the
laboratory to help and work with me, but her nimble hands were more
often than not in the wrong places and her quick inaccurate wits
were extraordinarily fertile in faintly irritating misconceptions.
And after a while she found laboratory assistance, without complete
intellectual participation, boring, and took offence at my frequent
disinclination to knock off and make love to her in my private
room. It seemed to Clara the primary use to which a private room
ought to be put.</p>

<p>She thought she would act; she thought she would develop her
gift for painting and drawing. Philip Weston, who afterwards as
Dickon's prize artist was to do so much to make the London poster
artistic, was very ready to give her lessons. She made considerable
progress and attained to everything except originality and
intensity. She rejoined the Fabian Society, which she had left
before her marriage, and various other societies that promised
drawing-room meetings. But most of these things were things of the
evening, when time and the exigencies of life were not so heavy on
her hands. Art in a convenient studio is on the other hand
naturally an affair of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Across the interval of a third of a century I can look back at
the strains between these two young people, one of whom has become
myself, and I can see that neither she nor I can justly be blamed
for our disaster. Like all human beings we were borne upon the
great flood of change, and it chanced that we were caught in an
eddy. She did not know the forces in her and without her that had
taken hold of her and were spinning her so giddily, and I had as
little self-knowledge. I wanted to drive on with my work and drive
on with my work. In such time as I could spare she could minister
to my love and pride in her.</p>

<p>For the rest of her days I had no care except that she did
nothing to infringe my lordship over her. And being anxious not to
distress me unduly, when presently under the urgency of her need
for entertainment she began to infringe upon my lordship, she saved
my pride and temper by some very excellent lying.</p>

<p>What a vivid silly creature she was, and how inevitable was her
drift to that exciting eXploitation of her physical personality
which was her instinctive gift! It needs all that third of a
century for me to record with detachment that while I was sitting
over my petrographical microscope, getting nearer and nearer to the
interference colour scale that enabled me to determine the
proportion of the bases in the micas and feldspars, she and Philip
Weston, having discovered they were perfect physical types, were
obliging each other as models for a series of drawings from the
nude. In the atmosphere of aesthetic gravity thus created, what the
world in general calls misbehaviour became an almost negligent
extension of their interesting studies. And I admit she was a
pretty thing, well worth drawing and deserving to be drawn, and for
the moment less mischievous when posed than active.</p>

<p>I did not know of such little adventures in liberality at the
time, but I felt them in the air. I became curious about her
movements. I was horrified to find myself suspicious and jealous. I
did not think of Weston at first, but I was startled to find that
Billy Parker had turned up again with a touching disposition to
take her out to rather expensive lunches. Billy was her sister's
brother-in-law, a privileged relationship; and she talked of him so
frequently and needlessly that a wiser husband would have perceived
that he was not at any rate the central figure of the
situation.</p>

<p>But after a time I began to see all sorts of things about Billy
down the petrographical microscope.</p>

<p>Now it was against all my conceptions of our relationship that I
should question her, much less make any objection, about her use of
her leisure. We had had many very liberal and far-reaching talks
about the relationship of men and women before we had married, and
it had been agreed between us that we should not be «tied" by that
antiquated ceremonial. We were both to keep a "perfect
freedom."</p>

<p>I suppose young people of high and advanced pretensions have
talked in that way for generations. It pervaded the brief life of
Shelley, and in his letters and recorded conversation the phrases
of a noble sexual generosity have already a used and customary
quality. I suspect the revolt against marriage, and against the
fierceness of marriage, has been growing with changing social
conditions, with increased social ease and security, with the
decline in the necessity for the lair-home, for a long time. It can
be remarked in the social life of Imperial Rome; it peeped out in a
score of usages during the days of chivalry; the last two centuries
are full of it; half our novels are about it. I doubt if an animal
can become so rapidly economically social as man has done in the
last million years without becoming also sexually social; a
solitary beast is a pairing beast, but man is almost the only
gregarious beast that attempts to pair. But at the time I did not
philosophise so broadly as that. I did not realise that half the
trouble in the little houses round such squares as Edenbridge
Square and all the similar and kindred squares and roads and
suburbs of London and Paris and New York&mdash;and I suppose Pekin
and Bombay&mdash;is a struggle between the dispositions of the lair
and the dispositions of the herd. I happened to be on the liberal
side, by chance as much as by anything; I preached the tolerations
of the herd with the exclusive passion of the lair rich in my
blood. I controlled my instinctive impulse to dominate and
monopolise. But the tension of these suppressions found an outlet
in other directions. The things I would not allow myself to say
about Clara's morals I said about her meals. I became abruptly
aware of a galling disregard for my comfort in our little home. I
became acutely sensitive to Clara's domestic casualness, to the
indiscipline of her one servant, to her absence from home if by any
chance I came back at an unusual hour. I began to nag, I became
irritable and objectionable. We quarrelled, we sulked, we made it
up without explanations under the compulsion of our vigorous young
appetites. Presently we found ourselves in money difficulties. She
had supplemented her pocket-money by diverting various sums due on
our tradesmen's bills. On our first year of house-keeping together
we were nearly a hundred and seventy pounds in debt and with
nothing in hand.</p>

<p>And just at this inopportune time she became extraordinarily
preoccupied with the idea of a child. She declared she wanted a
child passionately, that it was dishonourable for us to go
childless, that it was our duty to balance our peculiar gifts
against the rapid multiplication of the unfit. And she was going to
waste. She was demoralised through her thwarted instinct of
maternity. She was no good without a child. Anything might happen
to her unless she had a child to steady her. She expressed herself
with extreme impatience. I objected. While we were entangled and
short of money a child wouldn't have a fair chance with us.
Couldn't we wait a year or so?</p>

<p>"While I muddle about," she said. "Billy! I'm going to have that
child."</p>

<p>"Not yet," I said.</p>

<p>She spoke slowly and with her utmost emphasis. "Billy,</p>

<p>you don't understand. I'm going to have a child."</p>

<p>"But, good God!" said I. "How is that possible?"</p>

<p>She made no answer. Suddenly I took her by the</p>

<p>shoulders and looked into her face.</p>

<p>"How is that possible?" I said.</p>

<p>She explained garrulously and unsoundly. One was never sure. In
a dozen ways it might be possible.</p>

<p>But my doubt of her had been a very transitory one. My
solicitudes as a reluctant breadwinner came across my mind to
shield her from my scrutiny. And as yet I did not distrust her to
the extent of that doubt.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to face it," I said, singularly free from the
joys and exaltations of fatherhood. "Will you be ill, do you think?
So far you've carried it well. You'll carry it off all right.
You're a very perfect female animal, you know, made for the
business. And we must squeeze some sort of a nursery into the
house.... I wonder what it will cost us.... We'll manage.... But it
will be a tight job for us. You're a devil, Clara, at getting your
own way&mdash;in spite of science and art."</p>

<p>She seemed, I thought, to flinch.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be afraid of," said I. "You're one of Nature's
daughters."</p>

<p>There was something already at the back of my mind which had
been there, indeed, since I realised the deficit on our first
annual budget. But I did not tell Clara of it, because I hated to
think of the alacrity she would have displayed in grasping all the
possibilities it opened to us. I knew that I could carry off all
this trouble quite easily by a simple transfer of my activities
from the laboratories of the Royal College of Science to the
laboratories of the great metallurgical and chemical firm of Romer,
Steinhart, Crest and Co. They had heard of me, they wanted me
badly, although they did not nearly know all I might be able to do
for them. But at any rate they wanted me to the extent of eight
hundred pounds a year, rising by increments of fifty pounds to
twelve hundred, and that seemed to offer an immediate surcease of
all my present anxieties. The heavy work of the elementary course
of the college was over for the year; it had finished in February,
and there would be little difficulty about my resignation.</p>

<p>A year before I should have told Clara of this possibility and
discussed it with her, but now I kept it to myself. Even in that
moment of acceptance of the new situation I wasn't quite sure of
myself. I thought it over for three or four days still before I
went to Romer, Steinhart's. I seem to remember that I was on the
whole amused, bitterly amused by what had happened to me. I
realised quite clearly that I was bidding a long farewell to the
living realities of research. In all probability it would be a
lifelong farewell to the service of pure knowledge. For the rest of
my life, as I saw it then, I should be nosing out artful ways for
underselling magnesium or making aluminium cheap. Fine fun! I was
to be a scientific truffle-hunting dog for predacious business.
Which was predacious by instinct and did nothing worth doing with
the money. I remember recalling one day how old Mrs. Crewe had said
to me, "Ah, now&mdash;you will be human!" and laughing aloud in the
street. This was being human.</p>

<p>I did not pay very much attention to Clara during these days,
but afterwards I perceived that she, too, had been greatly
preoccupied. She was manifestly dismayed at the prospect of bearing
a child in our diminutive house, and though I could have relieved
her of that apprehension in half a dozen words, I did not find it
in my heart to do so. At times she would express an effusive
penitence for the trouble she had been the means of bringing upon
me; at times she would be extraordinarily thoughtful and aloof. One
of the chance things I had said to her stuck in her mind. "I'm one
of Nature's daughter's," she said. "And she's got me."</p>

<p>I wonder if I felt tenderly for her. I do not recall any
tenderness at all.</p>

<p>I had an interview with old Romer, and then with him and three
other of the directors, and after that we clinched our
arrangements. I informed the Royal College people of their
approaching loss, and still I forbore to tell Clara of her improved
prospects. Perhaps I wanted it to be a pleasant scene, and I feared
that her joy and relief would provoke my resentment and make me say
something bitter.</p>

<p>Then one day at breakfast I saw she was looking unhappy. I had
never seen real unhappiness in her face before. Hers was a very
animated face, and I knew a thousand of its
expressions&mdash;angry, bored, and forgetful&mdash;but this was
something different. She thought I was reading my paper; she had
forgotten I was there, and she was sitting quite still and staring
in front of her&mdash;as though hope had suddenly gone out of her
being. "Cheer up, Clara!" said I, and she became aware of me with a
violent start. She looked at me with a question in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Billy," she said.</p>

<p>I glanced at the clock. "It's nothing to be afraid of," I said,
getting up and gathering together some papers for my despatch-case.
I took her in my arms and kissed her. She kissed me back, but how
forced was her kiss and how dead she had become to my touch!</p>

<p>I had to hurry away or I would have told her of the
Romer-Steinhart arrangement there and then. But her expression of
wretchedness went with me. It troubled me all day. She showed deep
feeling so rarely that the idea of her being miserable came with a
special painfulness. I felt I had been too hard with her over a
misadventure that was as much mine as hers. And generally lately I
had been hard upon her. She was in for much the worst side of the
trouble before us. I wasn't playing the game by her; I was being a
vexatious and unhelpful partner. I was making her suffer for my
disappointments, disappointments she could not possibly
understand.</p>

<p>I was so concerned to relieve her worries that I came home
early. But she was out; she did not come in until past six. When
she came in she was no longer wretched looking; she was flushed and
grave-faced, but extraordinarily alive. I had been sitting in the
little drawing-room and living-room that was also my study, poring
rather inattentively over a file of notes upon some work I was
closing down, and waiting for her to come in. I stood up as she
entered.</p>

<p>"Back early?" she said.</p>

<p>"Before five."</p>

<p>"Your fire's out."</p>

<p>"I didn't watch it."</p>

<p>"Ellen got you some tea?"</p>

<p>"She was out. I got it myself."</p>

<p>She stared at the things on the table, with her mind far away.
"Billy," she said, "I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"At your service," I said.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;serious stuff."</p>

<p>I stared at her, unable to guess what was coming. She did not
look at me. Her eyes looked past me at the blank fireplace behind
me.</p>

<p>"It's got to be said," she remarked. "Sooner or later it has to
be said."</p>

<p>Her voice quickened. "It's better to have it out than to go away
with nothing explained. It's better to have things said. Better to
be plain. It's something I've had in mind for weeks. Now it has
come to a head. I don't know if you remember all we used to talk
about before we married, about either of us giving the other their
freedom if they wanted it. I don't know how much you meant about
that sort of thing, or whether you mean to stand by it now. But all
these months while we have been so unhappy together I have been
thinking of what we used to say. I've been thinking of how we used
to declare that no law, no marriage, ought to hold a man and a
woman together if they did not love. And all the while you have
been growing colder and harder to me and making life more difficult
for me. I have been asking myself, Billy, more and more if you and
I are really lovers any longer, if you and I can even pretend any
longer to be in love."</p>

<p>"Quite recently," I remarked, "the pretence has worked."</p>

<p>"Oh! Proximity! Habit! How can one save oneself? But is it love,
Billy? Is it truly love? For that matter, has it ever been
love?"</p>

<p>I realised that I was facing something absolutely strange to me.
This was a new, a different Clara who stood before me. I remember
vividly the picture she made in our darkling room and the effect of
discovery her words produced. And I noted for the first time that
she was already physically changed. Her pretty shoulders seemed a
little broader and lower, her neck softer and whiter. Her eyes;
there was something changed in her eyes. I observed, but I do not
remember what I thought nor what I said in reply to her words. I
observed that she was declaring that we had never loved, and I
apprehended, with a kind of astonishment at not having had it clear
before, that that was true. Why had it not been clear before?</p>

<p>This opening comes back to me very plainly, but much of the talk
that followed must have slipped out of my memory altogether. I
cannot remember in what phrases she made me aware that she meant to
leave me nor by what transitions my mind adapted itself to the new
situation. Then in harsh relief against that fog of forgetfulness I
see her with her hands gripping each other and a sort of swallowing
movement in her throat before she blurted out: "I'm not going away
alone. You don't understand, Billy. You don't understand what I am
trying to tell you. I'm going away with Philip Weston. I have been
at his studio all this afternoon."</p>

<p>In a flash I saw everything plainly. I recall a gleam of
sympathy for the wincing courage with which she faced me. A dozen
different mental processes seemed to be going on in my mind, quite
independently of one another. I remember quite distinctly that I
thought I ought to kill her, and that it would be extremely
agreeable and exciting to take her pretty neck, which I had kissed
with delight a thousand times, and squeeze it, squeeze it in my
hands. I was dangerous, and she knew I was dangerous. And yet at
the same time, in the same brain was a leap of relief that I was
quit of her. And then a pang of exasperation because my agreement
with Romer, Steinhart was signed and fixed and my successor at the
Royal College already appointed. For a time I didn't think much
about Weston. Clara in the foreground blotted him out.</p>

<p>I stood still on the hearth rug, and the moment for murder
passed.</p>

<p>"So that, in all probability, is where the baby comes from?" I
said.</p>

<p>She moistened her lips with her tongue and nodded, with her eyes
still warily on mine.</p>

<p>"And Weston is in a state to believe that?"</p>

<p>"He loves me, Billy."</p>

<p>She felt she was over the worst.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know you yet. All this puts one out to a certain
extent. I didn't see it coming. Where, for example, do you propose
to sleep to-night, Clara? Here? We might fall victims to&mdash;what
did you call it?&mdash;Proximity. Habit. And then I might strangle
you. And that would surprise and annoy Weston."</p>

<p>She did not seem to have thougt that out yet. She decided to
take a few things and go back to Weston. He would be waiting in the
studio. He would be sure to be waiting.</p>

<p>"I ought to be strangled," she said, with that idea still
lingering in her mind. I perceived that she would have liked a
little strangling&mdash;and then perhaps tears. But I was
immeasurably remote from tears.</p>

<p>It came to me as I stood on the hearth-rug before her that I was
gathering and expanding and spreading out a sort of peacock's tail
of derisive hate. I had no feeling for her then but derisive hate.
It was as if I had never done anything but hate her. I was teeming
with insulting phrases like a thundercloud ready to burst, and
saying nothing. At the same time I realised that this was not how a
civilised man of advanced views ought to react to our amazing
situation. It was before me, but I did not grasp it yet.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say to you," I confessed. "Get your things
together. Tell Ellen some old lie. Tell her your mother is ill and
you want to be with her. And go. Get out. I shall go out&mdash;now.
And just walk about and try and figure out what has happened. I
shan't come back for an hour or so. I promise you that. You'll have
plenty of time to pack and get off.... It's sudden. And yet I
suppose I ought to have seen it coming...."</p>

<p>I considered. "What else is there to say?" She appeared at the
door of the sitting-room as I was going out of the house. An idea
had dawned upon her. She spoke with a note of perplexity.</p>

<p>"Billy," she said, "this may be our good-bye!"</p>

<p>I stared at this new aspect. She wanted an emotional parting!
She wanted a scene in which I was to play the part of poor old
Billy. She felt a certain remorse and pity was due to me. She
conceived the situation as cheaply as that. She had no sense of the
murderous fury that filled me.</p>

<p>"Well," I answered, after a pause, in a brutal voice; "what the
hell else do you suppose it to be?"</p>

<p><i>"Billy!"</i> she whispered, aghast, and gripped her hands
together. "Oh, Billy!"</p>

<p>I did not slam the door wilfully, but it seemed to slam
itself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-5" name="b4-5"></a>§ 5. QUEEN'S PROCTOR</h2>

<p class="first">IT is a difficult undertaking to reach across the
interval of thirty-odd years and reconstruct the state of mind of
that dismayed and angry human animal who walked about Hyde Park
while his wife, dismayed likewise, and as troubled, perhaps, at
herself and him and the universe as he was, packed for her
departure from the poor little home that had contained their
passions and dissensions for a year and a half. There was no
tenderness, no pity in my mood; it was almost entirely a state of
rage. And I do not think that even then it was directed against
Clara. What I raged against had the shape of Clara, wore her
delightful body, but it was really the passion and desire in myself
for the glories, thrills, and gratifications she could give me that
maddened me. She had become a consuming necessity in my life, and I
had lost her.</p>

<p>I do not remember that in all the storm there entered anything
at all that one could speak of as love. In most&mdash;in
ninety-nine per cent of love affairs, there is, I am convinced,
hardly any love at all. There was hate. Hate, a wildly scornful
hate for Clara's nimble lying, would come over my mind like the
quivering red glare one sees for a time among thunderclouds, and
pass again. It was not a very pointed and personal hate. I hated
the situation and her share in it, but even then I knew that she
was as much the victim of uncontrollable drives in her own nature
as I was.</p>

<p>But what in this belated retrospect impresses me most about the
state of mind of this young Mr. William Clissold in Hyde Park one
April afternoon in 1891 was the primary importance in it of wounded
vanity and self-love. I realise again as I sit and think these
things over and write about them here the profound mental effect a
woman has upon the man to whom she gives herself. She becomes the
sustainer of his self-esteem, she imposes her values upon his
vanity; she secures an enormous power of humiliation over him. In
every love affair there is a campaign of :flattery and reassurance.
It seemed of the first importance to me that evening that I should
not be the rejected one, that I should, so to speak, shout it at
her: "I don't want you. I never want to touch you again."</p>

<p>What an incredible thing that young man of twenty-three is to
myself of fifty-nine! I am astonished as I look back into this
little pit of memories at his narrowness and violence. Maybe I am
self-righteously astonished and nearer to him still than I like to
think myself. But how entirely self-centred he was! I suppose every
young thing has to be self-centred if it is to get anywhere in a
scrambling world. Youth and individuality are self-assertion; they
have no other possible significance. :Yet I cannot but feel that my
self-protection was excessive.</p>

<p>I had a great desire to lie to Clara and tell her that I, too,
had been unfaithful. It filled me with shame and anger that I had
been steadfastly faithful to her and content with her. It would
have been so much easier to have been able to write to her
magnanimously: "Go your own way. I, too, love someone else." It
appeared,. in deed, as I walked about Hyde Park, fantastically
important to me that I should balance Clara's infidelity with
equally liberal behaviour of my own. Just to define Clara's place
once for all and banish this "poor old Billy" business from the
world.</p>

<p>I doubt if my behaviour was very abnormal by our present
standards. Human society had passed beyond the phase of passionate
possession between the sexes, when it was natUral and proper for
the husband to kill the wife for her treason and the lover for his
robbery. That "Old Man" husband is buried deep now beneath whole
mountains of suppression. But not so deeply as to be beyond danger
of eruption. The mountains of suppression quake and move. I had
trained my mind in the fashion of our time and held Clara to be a
free person on an equality with myself. It remained to me,
therefore, to solace my shattered vanity as well as I could, and
above all to release myself as soon as possible from the ascendency
that Clara had gained over my senses. Because I knew quite clearly,
even then, that if I did not do that, if I let myself dwell upon
her relations with Weston, I ran the risk of an exasperation of
mind that might fling me back again, in spite of all my
civilisation, towards archaic violence.</p>

<p>And so for a time I thought very little either of my science, my
teaching, or of the new position I was to take up in the autumn. I
set out upon a search for sexual adventure, and, with the advantage
of such knowledge as my marriage had given me, it was not long
before I had distracted myself from the obsession of my divorce
proceedings with several intrigues. So long as one did not love and
was not too scrupulous about the truth, making love was by no means
a difficult art. I could be plausible and talkative, and had the
instinct that restrains a caress until it is desired. I could soon
count "successes" and had a</p>

<p>healing reassurance that I could be desirable. For illicit love
in London it is not so much charm and splendour that are needed as
convenient premises and a certain leisure. There was hardly a
particle of love, it seems to me now, in any of these businesses,
and in the intervals of my various adventures I found myself wildly
and terribly unhappy. Yet it may be, so queerly selective are our
memories in all that touches sex, there was much tenderness,
gratitude, friendliness that I have forgotten. Yes&mdash;there was
friendliness; of that I may tell later.</p>

<p>It was profoundly necessary to me that I should flaunt my
freedom before the eyes of Clara, and since I had refused to play
the part of "poor old Billy" in the drama it became almost as
necessary to her to demonstrate her satisfaction with Weston. One
among my three or four "affairs" had emerged to a sort of
predominance. It was with a girl named Jones, who was a model, a
sunny-haired, smiling, amoral creature whom everybody called
Trilby. I had met her in some studio party. Du Maurier's
<i>Trilby</i> had been the success of a publishing season, and the
name itself was being splashed about the whole English-speaking
world. She was blond and handsome and more effective than Clara;
she knew her and had some obscure hostility to her, and so we
contrived to be seen about together and even to encounter Weston
and Clara on one or two occasions and go through the gestures of a
liberal amiability.</p>

<p>And Clara and I were sedulous to assure everyone in our two
little worlds that what we were doing was high and calm and exactly
what ought to be done, that we had parted because we did not love
each other as people ought to do if they were to live together, but
that we maintained the highest esteem and the utmost affection
towards each other. Our marriage had been a mistake. An agreeable
mistake that had not lasted. She was drawn to Weston by an old and
natural passion. We said little or nothing about the decisive
intrusion of the coming child or of any doubt that had ever
troubled us about its paternity. After all, very few people were
likely to check us back with a calendar. And in my heart I hated
Clara with a virulent hatred.</p>

<p>For the life of me I cannot now recall the exact motives and
intentions of these posturings and pretendings.</p>

<p>I know we were all set most resolutely upon being emancipated,
unconventional, free, and natural. I think we all had a muddled
sense of changing conditions, of the obsolescence of the standards
of the past, due to the altered population question and of the
necessity of readjustment; we young intellectuals were among the
first detached particles to fall into what is now a great whirlpool
of almost instinctive readjustments.</p>

<p>Unhappily in all the proud and magnificent disengagements and
renunciations of our readjusting process we took no account of an
important legal functionary, who was called in those Victorian days
the Queen's Proctor. It was this gentleman's business to
investigate the particulars of such divorces as the resources of
his office brought within his scope, in the six months between the
granting of the decree <i>nisi</i> and its being made absolute and
final. To this day English law has no tolerance for divorce by
consent. Its conception of marriage is the orthodox Christian one;
its attitude towards divorce is punitive. There must be a party who
is aggrieved and a party who is blameless, a party rolling and
wallowing in "Sin" and a party of unspotted purity. The latter
longs to continue the marriage, but the former has made it
intolerable. The petitioner must to the climax live in a state of
chaste grievance and hold out hands of reconciliation. It is the
business of the Queen's Proctor to see that he or she does so. If
the petitioner is rich, the petitioner goes abroad and, with a few
expensive but simple precautions, is relieved of this obligation;
the Queen's Proctor cannot, in the interests of national economy,
pursue such a petitioner. But if the petitioner is poor, cheap,
unpleasant persons of the minion type conduct their rude inquiries
into his or her purity. They did into mine.</p>

<p>I petitioned. I got my decree <i>nisi</i>, and while Clara was
in the amphibious state of a wife living in sin and under legal
notice to quit, a daughter who is legally mine was born. Then the
Queen's Proctor intervened, and I failed to get my decree made
absolute. I was already at the laboratory at Downs-Peabody&mdash;I
had been there two months&mdash;when I learnt by telegram that our
iniquities were discovered and that since we had made it manifest
that we <i>both</i> wanted a divorce, Clara was still, and was
going to remain for the rest of our lives so far as I could see, my
wife.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-6" name="b4-6"></a>§ 6. CLARA AT LARGE</h2>

<p class="first">NONE of us had reckoned with the Queen's Proctor.
We had all been told of his legal possibilities, but we had
answered airily that "they don't do that sort of thing now," and we
really believed it. That was the <i>fin-de-siècle</i> assumption,
that unfair or unpleasant laws did not work in the case of
agreeable people, and it needed the startling trial and
condemnation of Oscar Wilde that year to remind the world that even
in the end of the most wonderful century old laws might still crush
the wittiest, most impudent, and debonair of offenders. Elderly
judges sat in the divorce courts delivering judgments that were
none the less operative because all the clever people thought them
half a century behind the times.</p>

<p>For my own part I was infuriated beyond measure by this smashing
vindication of established institutions against our modernism. My
hatred of Clara was overshadowed by a comprehensive rebellion
against the world. It remained inconceivable to me that I was to
have the burthen of her support and be barred against any decent
remarriage, perhaps for all the rest of my days. I thought quite
seriously for an hour or so one day of killing the Queen's Proctor
to "ventilate" my grievance. I wonder what sort of dried-up old
lawyer would have been swept out of existence if I had consummated
that impulse. But that such a thought should have crossed my mind
is a measure of my estimate of the situation. And I made a
resolution, and kept it for three years, that whatever Weston
decided to do about Clara, and however the law might stand in the
matter, I would contribute nothing to the support of either her or
her child.</p>

<p>She wrote a letter saying she wanted a good talk in private with
me&mdash;"just to ourselves"&mdash;about "our daughter's
prospects," but the latter phrase so irritated me that I did not
answer. She wrote again twice. I was now getting deeply interested
in the peculiar needs and conditions of Romer, Steinhart, but it
happened that I had to come to London for a conference upon a more
economical rearrangement of the refuse tilts at Downs-Peabody and
that I had to visit the house in Edenbridge Square which I had at
last let, in order to see a man and arrange for the forwarding of
some of my books and the sale of the rest of the furniture.
Accordingly I made an appointment with her there, and there it was
we met for the last time.</p>

<p>(Except that once about fifteen years ago I saw her pursuing an
omnibus in Trafalgar Square, I never set eyes upon her again. She
died of influenza at Nice five years ago.)</p>

<p>She had arranged herself for my reconquest, very plainly but
very prettily, and no one would have suspected her of a baby four
months old. But I had determined to be insusceptible. I had
hardened my heart and fortified myself. She asked me what I meant
to do and what I thought she ought to do. Nothing, I said. She
could go on just as if she had been divorced. She could call
herself Mrs. Weston. The press notices of the dismissal of our
decree absolute had been very inconspicuous; even the notices of
our brief trial had been rare and compact; we were too obscure for
attention, and if she stuck to it stoutly that she and Weston were
married, no one was likely to make any trouble in the matter.</p>

<p>She said that was reasonable, very reasonable, but there was
something troubling her mind. She faltered for a moment and decided
to be blunt.</p>

<p>"Philip," she said, "isn't sure about the child."</p>

<p>She eyed me. She seemed to be weighing my receptivity for some
elaborate and circumstantial confidences. "Nor am I," she added
meanwhile.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. "I don't feel an interested party," I
said.</p>

<p><i>"Billy!"</i> she cried. "You're pretty tough.... Legally
anyhow&mdash;It's yours.</p>

<p>That stung me. I swore compactly.</p>

<p>"Well, we have to face facts," she said.</p>

<p>"Philip's your man."</p>

<p>"I shan't feel safe with Philip. I don't feel safe with myself.
I was a fool, Billy."</p>

<p>"You were careless about yourself, Clara. And about me.
Haphazard is the word. I've never thought of you as a fool."</p>

<p>"There's still the old tang in the things you say, Billy."</p>

<p>I had no defence against that. There was no one she had ever
found so satisfactory to talk to as I was, she said. I put things
so clearly and freshly. We had had some great times together. She
glowed at her memories and sighed. "I suppose I've learnt too
late," she said, "that everything one does has consequences. I've
made a beastly mess of things." Life was like turning on taps that
wouldn't turn off again. When one was a child one squalled and
somebody came and slapped one and shut the tap off and put
everything back. Then suddenly one was grown-up and nobody came.
But the slaps came. "I've had some bad times, taking that in," said
Clara.</p>

<p>I was touched. I relaxed a little in my manner. I said that what
she needed in life was not a husband like myself, but a large
sedulous male attendant of about fifty. Perhaps it was too late now
to prescribe that. Old Crashaw for example. Where was he?</p>

<p>"He's married," she said, "and idiotic about her."</p>

<p>"So that's no good."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I was a fool. I should have played the game by
you."</p>

<p>I said that some day perhaps we should defer the age of moral
responsibility untIl people were thirty or thirty-five. "As if I
didn't know how I have spoilt things for you!" she exclaimed
suddenly, the most successful thing she said in the whole
conversation. It had never occurred to me before that she could
recognise the damage I had suffered.</p>

<p>"I bit it off," I said, "and I had to chew it. You're not to
blame for that."</p>

<p>"Poor old Billy ! You've had a beastly time."</p>

<p>She was positively embracing my admission that the affair had
hurt me. The mule's ears went back again.</p>

<p>"Suppose now after all I come back to you," she threw out, so
that it was doubtful :whether it was an idle remark or a serious
suggestion.</p>

<p>I forget the exact form of my reply. I considered the
possibility for a moment. I told her that then, very carefully and
deliberately, without causing her unnecessary pain, I should set
about killing her. But if I forget my exact words I remember
hers.</p>

<p>"That's the most attractive thing you've ever said to me!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"All the same, you'd better stick to Philip," I said. "You can
explain things to him so that he will believe. Unless you've
muddled already with his confidence."</p>

<p>She was not quite convinced now of her power to hum-bug Philip,
I could see. And once she had been so certain.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're up to, Clara," I said, "but your one
chance in life now is Philip. If you try any second string business
with him he'll smell it, even if he doesn't know about it. Have you
been shaking him already&mdash;by something? You pile your little
all on him. I swear to you I'll go to gaol for ever rather than do
anything to help you."</p>

<p>"I've never asked for that, Billy."</p>

<p>"What good would it be?"</p>

<p>But she still hovered undecided before the course she had to
take.</p>

<p>"It gives Philip a frightful power over me. Whatever he does I
shan't be able to divorce him."</p>

<p>"No doubt you'll contrive some consolation for your wounded
pride," I said.</p>

<p>"You can sting. You could always sting...."</p>

<p>It was clear our talk was coming to nothing for her.</p>

<p>Whatever vague intentions she had had, whether of a
reconciliation, or an entangling afternoon's adventure, had failed.
I wonder to this day what she had wanted in that interview.</p>

<p>At the end we shook hands and then with my hand in hers her eyes
scrutinised mine. Mine told her nothing. She hesitated. She took
her chance with me and flung her arms about me, and gave me the
last of those wonderful kisses of hers that I was ever to receive.
Her first kiss had seemed to me to come straight out of heaven;
this last, straight out of stock. I accepted the favour without
excitement. I held her in my arms&mdash;considerately, even
appreciatively. "Ah!" she sighed, detaching herself and
scrutinising my face again.</p>

<p>"You'd better playa straight game with Philip," I said, as
though nothing had happened. "You won't&mdash;but you'd
better."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you <i>make</i> me play a straight game with
you?"</p>

<p>I don't think I answered that.</p>

<p>"You could have done it so easily."</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"You had everything in your hands."</p>

<p>After she had gone I sat for a long time at the little table in
the drawing-room at which I had worked so often, thinking.</p>

<p>I was extremely sorry for her. Suddenly, having thus beaten her
off from me, I was sorry for her, as I had never been sorry for her
before. This futile attempt to raid back to my affections
alleviated my hate for her by its very futility. I saw her
flimsiness at last plainly, the poverty of her equipment, the
adverse chances against her. Our separation had robbed her of her
personal hold over me; I saw her now as a stranger, as detachedly.
For the first time in my life I realised that pity for women which
comes to all decent men sooner or later&mdash;in spite of our
endless humiliations and subjugations and the way we spoil our
lives through them. For it is not they who spoil men's lives, but
the accidents of a bad time and a misdirection in ourselves that
misuse them to our own hurt and belittlement.</p>

<p>But was I to blame? What else could I have done from first to
last except the things I had been impelled to do?, And now what was
there to do?, It was impossible for me to take her back even were
she prepared for that. A little more kindness perhaps? But even
that might prevent her from doing the one wise thing before her,
which was to make herself Philip's only woman and he her only
man.</p>

<p>I had a half-generous, half-insulting impulse, and I found a
sheet of paper in my bureau and wrote her a note telling her to
take all the furniture left in the house for herself. She had
bought it with a certain avid interest; she was always a
bright-eyed buyer, and suddenly I saw clearly that its poor little
pieces and arrangements were personal to her and I had no right to
deprive her of them. Fortunately the furniture man had made so poor
an offer for the stuff that I had held it over to consider, or I
could not have done even this petty act of decency. The real owner
of the furniture I reflect now with a smile was Dickon. I had still
to repay his brotherly loan. But I did not see it in that light
then. Possibly because I knew certainly that I would repay.</p>

<p>I did everything I could to keep Clara out of my mind for some
years and to heal the scar of her excision. But presently came a
time when she was in dismay. She wrote to me pitifully and
shamelessly. The menage with Weston had broken down; I do not know
how, the truth in these things is always obscure and complex and
indescribable even to the principals in the quarrel. Her family had
turned against her, and not one of her three sisters was well
married. She was evidently as concerned for our daughter as for
herself, and I have every reason to suppose she was by nature and
intention a good mother. She was always cleverer and kinder with
dogs and cats than I was; she had quick responses to all living
things that came near her, and I have no doubt she was
exceptionally attentive and kind to her own child. I decided to
help her. But I helped her in such a way that even now I am not a
little ashamed to write it down. The truth has to be told because
it is an illuminating truth. It shows the make-up of the human
male. I arranged she should be paid three hundred a year, and I
saddled it with an ungracious condition that the money should be
paid to her "while she remained chaste." She had to swallow that
insult. My solicitor saw nothing objectionable in this ugly
proviso, and would even have amplified it by a clause against
"annoyance." But the law still keeps its moral ideas in cold
storage in the vaults of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Two years later I made it an unconditional three hundred a year.
What right had I to dictate her conduct of her life in this
fashion? And when things were already going well with me and the
sense of security and property was established in me, I heard that
our daughter was being ill-taught in a National School in Hoxton,
to the great distress of her mother, and suddenly I made a
settlement of a thousand a year on Clara. My solicitor advised me
to make it on the daughter with Clara as trustee, but I had as much
confidence in Clara's maternal instincts as I had in her inevitable
unchastity. It worked quite well, and she brought up her daughter
as a very pleasant young lady, and married her off finally just
after the war when the marriage market was good, to a prosperous
doctor in Cardiff, who had met her first on war service. Then Clara
travelled for a time, with first one woman friend and then another,
visited Egypt and the Garden of Allah, and acquired a taste for
roulette at Monte Carlo. Of her sisters I never heard anything
more. I have been told she dressed young during this final phase,
and was sometimes charming and sometimes rather haggard. She always
had one or two very old men or very young men in attendance. Her
death was due to the impatience that made her get up for a dance
before she was well of her influenza. The fresh chill, and the
casualness of the hotel where she was staying alone, killed her.
She was about four hundred pounds in debt and overdrawn when she
died, which sum seemed to me to be almost exactly like
her&mdash;neither very scandalous nor quite solvent.</p>

<p>I made the acquaintance of our daughter as a school-girl at a
vehemently healthy, manly girls' school at Brighton. I had learnt
from Clara that she was a little worried in her mind, assisted by
her schoolfellows, at the aloofness of her father, and so I went in
state on several visiting days and showed myself with her and was
introduced to her friends and found occasions to take her about in
London. She was quite easy to be nice to. She did not resemble me
in the least, but also she did not resemble Weston; I have
sometimes fancied a resemblance to Billy Parker, but that may be a
morbid fancy. She played and plays tennis very well, and is
ridiculously grave and important in the art, practice, and politics
of this epidemic.</p>

<p>I liked her, and I still like her, and I perceive that I loom
large in her scheme of things, but I have never warmed to her; I do
not feel and, to be plain about it, I do not believe, that she is
bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. I feel none of the
instinctive harmony and intimacy that I do with my nephew William
or even with his brother Richard. But I love William. I was
temperately generous at her marriage, and I know that she has
expectations that my will must not altogether disappoint. Sometimes
I pay her a flying visit when my business takes me to Cardiff, and
sometimes there will be a dinner and a theatre party in London. On
occasion she sits on my knee, ruffles my hair, and calls me
"Daddy." But always a little tentatively. I am gracefully
responsive, and all the while I feel as unreal as if I were acting
a Charles Wyndham part in a play by Sir Henry Arthur Jones, and she
were the celebrated and charming Miss So-and-So. The doctor is
good, solid stuff, though rather too prejudiced against
psycho-analysis, and the two children are healthy, jolly little
experimentalists with life, as amusing to play with as puppies. If
they are not exactly bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, I have
no doubt they would be quite willing to be so. It is not their
fault if they are not.</p>

<h2><a id="b4-7" name="b4-7"></a>§ 7. EMPTY HOUSE</h2>

<p class="first">I SAT for a long time in our empty house after
Clara had departed, with my note about the furniture on the table
before me. I sat there long after it was quite dark. Then I found a
candle and lit it and went about the house musing over the things
that had happened in the various rooms, incredulous of its
evaporated happiness. What a poor, stuffy little house it had
become, and how: proud we had once been of it! I came down to the
drawing-room again and sat there.</p>

<p>It must have been half-past ten or even later before I dosed the
door behind me, because when I went by the Underground Railway to
the Strand to get some food I found the people streaming out of the
theatres. It was the narrow old Strand that is now being swept
away; it :was lit then by a queer mixture of gas-lamps,
mantle-lamps, and fizzling arc-lights on trial that made variegated
glares and pallors on the bobbing heads of the crowd. The people
jostled me because I was still half lost in thought, and when I sat
down in Gatti's I remember the waiter annoyed me because he would
not take "Oh, anything that's going," as a definite order, but
insisted upon making suggestions.</p>

<p>That session with myself in that dusk-invaded room, in my first
and last home, became for me a cardinal point in my life, the end
of a chapter, the beginning of a new phase. It stands out in my
conception of my life as our departure from Mowbray stands out, or
the night when Dickon and I announced our secession from the
Walpole-Stent household stands out. It marks the real beginning of
the man I am now, the passing of a much more instinctive,
passionate, and direct being. I have described my youthful self as
a very detached scientific intellect in conflict with what seemed
an alien and destructive sexuality. The two had fought a battle
that was really an admixture. For a&lt; time sex had stormed along
its own path with me, had seemed to carry all before it. It had
made me aggressive and combative; it had turned me to acquisition
and had made me aware of the need of power. My intelligence had not
been so much defeated as hammered into new recognitions. The two
had come now to a phase of balance and understanding. I still
thought that research, the clambering to new visions of reality
beyond any limits of knowledge yet attained, was the best thing in
life, but I knew that I could not go on with that toilsome ascent
until the craving hungers that torment and distract unless they are
satisfied were assuaged, until my personal pride was secure, until
I could command beauty in my hours if I desired it.</p>

<p>I had realised at last the profound importance of the sexual
motive in life. I could not live fully without that self-respect,
that zest in my personal life that only woman could give me. I had
to discover now how I could come to terms with womankind. I had to
do this under the handicap of my entanglement. I had so to frame my
life and to achieve such relationships that I should be safe from
such another disaster as this empty house embodied. I had to gain a
certain security and amplitude in the world, so that if presently I
was able to build up some more than temporary liaison, it should be
secure from the tension of wants and debts and safe against the
attractions and distractions of a more prosperous Philip Weston. I
had not realised before the <i>quid pro quo</i> in love. It was
plain to me now and plainly reasonable. I saw why Clara :with the
thought of motherhood had been scared from the narrow bleakness of
our little home, and I saw, too, the manifest connection of her
attempted reconciliation with my new prosperity.</p>

<p>Can a creature made for motherhood be indifferent to a laid I
will not say coarsely that I learnt that women are to be bought,
but I saw quite clearly that they have to be paid for. Well, I must
be able to pay for them. I could not think now what it was I had
expected from Clara. I had made vast assumptions. But though a man
does research, so that new light and wonder such as no one has ever
known before pour into the world, so that new things begin and all
things are altered and turned about, yet if that involves personal
poverty, a certain preoccupation of mind, an inability to cherish
and supply, no woman has any use for him.</p>

<p>I was not man enough, I saw, or perhaps I should say I was too
much of a man, to accept the role of a scientific devotee, vowed
for the best part of his life to celibacy and poverty. That would
cripple me with a suppressed sense of inferiority and all the
mental distortion that entails. I needed material success, embodied
in its Jiving symbol. I must have that living symbol. I had learnt
now in terms of Clara and bitter experience what I had disregarded
when Dickon told it to me in words that then had no meaning for me.
"Research!" he had said. "Please yourself for a bit, Billykins, so
long as you're let. But there's not even freedom of thought in the
world for a man who isn't his own master. The show is a scramble,
and it's going to be a scramble yet for centuries."</p>

<p>So I, too, would become predatory and set out to overtake Dickon
in his scramble to possession and freedom and purchasing power.
And, freedom and power assured, I must square my account with this
craving that obsessed me. Then, as Dickon had said, for
disinterested service, scientific research, or anything else, as
the mood might take me.</p>

<p>Already I had learnt a great deal from the beginnings of my work
with Romer, Steinhart. I had been able to measure myself against
most of my directors and get some inkling of the scale and vast
possibilities of their organisation. For those days it was a very
great company, though it was a mere infant compared with the giant
ramifications of annexed, subsidiary, dependent, and associated
concerns into which we have since grown. We had practically no
relations with America or Sweden at all then, and towards our
German and other Continental homologues our attitude was still one
of naive rivalry. The authorised capital of the mother company is
now thirty-two million pounds; in those days it was seven hundred
and fifty thousand. The works at Downs-Peabody were still the
largest part of our plant. But even then in the early nineties the
firm's rate of growth was sufficient to foreshadow its present
scale. Our ordinary shares of a pound were creeping up and round
about thirty shillings. And it was clear to me that with my quite
special knowledge and my peculiar aptitudes it would be extremely
easy for me to secure a fair and handsome participation in the big
things coming.</p>

<p>My directors had not yet made up their minds how I was to be
handled. But I had already formed very clear ideas of how the firm
was going to be handled. I had been brought in by Julian Romer, the
younger son of old Romer and the brother of the great Roderick, the
head of the firm. Julian was, perhaps, the best equipped
technically of all the second generation of Romers. Roderick was a
far better administrator, but of no account from the technical
standpoint. Old Romer had been the business organiser of the
concern; Steinhart had been the scientific spirit; but both the
Romer sons&mdash;Steinhart had daughters only; Ralph Steinhart is a
nephew&mdash;were sent abroad to learn something sound about modern
chemistry and metallurgy before the intellectual lassitude of the
English public school could submerge them. Julian had a real
aptitude for scientific work and also considerable business
ability. He had marked the drift of my early papers and leapt, long
before I had a suspicion of that side of the matter, at the
industrial applications foreshadowed. He had explained me to his
co-directors and sought me out. He was a high-coloured,
black-haired, warm-blooded, bright-eyed little man, very quick in
his movements, very confidential in his manner, coming up very
close to you, insinuatingly. We were to work in the same laboratory
for a time. He was, if possible, to pick my brains; I was to be the
auriferous quartz, and he was to be the extractor. His sedulous
amiability, his pressing persuasiveness, were, however, just a
little too warm and eager for the metallic Clissold temperament. We
exchanged. He learnt something of what I knew&mdash;enough to
realise the full value of what I could do for the
industry&mdash;and I learnt very rapidly of his business and
productive organisation.</p>

<p>I perceived I could be, that I was made to be, the goose that
could lay golden eggs for Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co. I did not
intend, however, to lay them in full sight of my employers. After a
week I found Julian's interest in my private thoughts so lively
that I took all my notebooks out of the laboratory back to my
lodgings and bought a safe to keep them in. I just carried one
notebook in my pocket. When Julian embarked upon discussions with
me I stressed the philosophical side. Julian showed a real feeling
for pure science, and I saw to it that he got it chemically pure. I
carried our talk at times, I believe, to a very close approximation
to some of Einstein's subsequent work, but I doubt if Julian fully
appreciated the high and novel matter I was giving him. One day he
made a sort of quarrel because I didn't let him know what I was
doing upon the crystallisation of alloys, and hinted quite plainly
that I was paid to confide all my notions to him&mdash;at least all
that occurred to me in business hours.</p>

<p>"Results," I corrected. "But I have to follow the laws of my
being. I couldn't think if I thought I was watched while I was
thinking. It would make me self-conscious and nervous. But when I
have results I shall give them to you properly, ready for use.
They're coming, rest assured."</p>

<p>"But I could help you so much more," said Julian, "if I could
follow what you were up to."</p>

<p>"Couldn't bear you at my heels," I said. "It would paralyse
me."</p>

<p>"I've got ideas."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it? But you will have to bear with my
limitations."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and pouted and looked hurt and
unhappy. "I had looked forward so to working with you, my dear
fellow."</p>

<p>Quite at the outset I did some good work that proved my value to
the firm. It was nothing out of the way; it was the natural
consequence of bringing a fresh young mind to bear on an
established routine. The system of the refuse tilts had grown up
bit by bit, had been adapted several times to changes of method,
had become a thing of use and wont to all the directors, and an
increasing element of waste had crept in with each adaptation.
Things had moved fast; there had been a lot of patching. No one had
thought of standing the whole thing on its head, so to speak. I saw
almost at once that that could be done at a very considerable
profit, simply because I was not habituated to the old sequence. If
I had been in the firm for ten years, I should have been just as
blind to it as the others were. They saw my points and nodded to
each other.</p>

<p>Julian behaved at the meeting as if he had begotten me, trained
me, and taught me what to say. Also he prompted me. But this first
golden egg established me with the firm and gave me time to work
out my more primary and extensive problems in applied metallurgy
and to devise a method of conceding them upon terms whereby the
profit should be mutual.</p>

<p>My mind was already full of that possibility when I sat and
thought in my empty house.</p>

<p>I remember very distinctly thinking over Julian, Clara quite
forgotten for a while, and smiling to myself in the darkness. I was
already very fond of him then, and my affection has grown with the
years. He is one of the few men I can bear to play golf with. He
knows so much, he puts his heart into every game, and he achieves
even worse results than I do. With outcries, with something near
tears. "What have I done?" he cries, to God and <i>me</i> to the
caddie and the earth and the sky and any casual birds or beasts
that chance to be within earshot. "My God! But <i>look at
it!</i>"</p>

<p>He had left London directly after the meeting on the previous
afternoon for Downs-Peabody, and he had been most solicitous that I
should do all I had to do in London before I returned. I had
thanked him warmly. I had expected something of the sort and
prepared for it.</p>

<p>When I had unpacked at Downs-Peabody I had found, among other
things in my boxes, two or three fragments of meteorites I had
brought away from the Royal College. Just before leaving to come to
London, I had fused these up together in a dark and intriguing
lump. One side I cut and polished beautifully. I had marked this
lump "B. in reserve. Final phase," packed it away in a little box,
and left it, as if inadvertently, in the drawer of my laboratory
table for Julian's benefit. I felt sure it would amuse him while I
was away. He was probably busy with it now, missing his dinner to
examine and perhaps analyse a scrap of it, and it was pleasant to
calculate what he would make of it.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> "in reserve" and "in its final phase." What else
was there to be done with it?</p>

<p>No doubt my meditations wandered for a time to the
characteristics of his people. I do not believe very much in all
this modern fuss about races; everyone alive is, I am convinced, of
mixed race, but still some of us are more white, some of us more
negro, some of us more Chinese than others. Compared with me Julian
was Mediterranean, South-Eastern, Jewish; compared with him I was
Northern and Western and blond. And our minds worked with the most
entertaining differences. In his presence I felt slow and
stupid&mdash;but solid. His mind could dance round mine as it
marched. It came into a question like a brisk young dog, which
comes into a room, seems to see, hear, and smell everything, knows
what you feel about, wags its tail all the time, makes a remark or
so almost absent-mindedly, and goes out again quite assured there
is neither biscuit nor bone there. He thought so quickly that he
never stopped to think. I had as little chance against him at chess
as a gorilla. And yet I could get to things and do things that
seemed impossible to him and that he knew were impossible to him. I
could produce a path where he was convinced there was no path, and
I could see, and make him see, things he had never seen. While he
raced through the labyrinth of a question, learning its every turn,
I seemed able to look over and reach over.</p>

<p>But the more one tries to state these differences, the more one
realises how subtly they defy formulation. These brunette peoples,
these dark-whites, made civilisation for us. I doubt if either we
blonds or the yellows or the blacks could have done as much for
ourselves. Then we came in upon an established system, we Northern
and Atlantic peoples, migrants, invaders, sceptics, protestants,
obstructive questioners, slow, recalcitrant learners, less
brilliant but more original, rupturing conventions, releasing
debtors, opening new ways, resuming the forward movement upon
obscure new lines....</p>

<p>Perhaps Julian and I represent a blend that may become very
effective in human affairs. We two and Roderick have done quite a
number of things together that <i>none</i> of us could have brought
off in exclusive association with men of our own type.</p>

<p>But I see I am astray beyond my thoughts in my empty house in
Edenbridge Square. From Julian my musing probably passed to my
other associates at Downs-Peabody, and so came back to more
intimate questions. For the first time in my life since I had begun
to observe and think I had come into contact with rich people and
with able people engaged in getting richer, and I was beginning to
apprehend a number of points about human motives and my own
possibilities that had hitherto escaped me. I had not properly
understood before what there is in this process of getting and
keeping rich; my estimate of motives had been too simple. I had
regarded only the forms and habits of life. I was now getting a
grasp upon the driving forces of life.</p>

<p>I can best put it by saying that in my younger view of the
social order into which I had been born I had seen it mainly as a
business of toil-shifting and a struggle for freedom. People were
poor, limited, and oppressed because they had had too much of the
necessary toil of the community thrust upon their shoulders, and my
early socialism was a simple and reasonable scheme for the
redistribution and economy of toil. Everybody might be relieved
from any excess of toil and given leisure and a sufficiency of
freedom. Then&mdash;seen from the angle of back streets and the
common life of worry and insufficiency&mdash;it seemed reasonable
to expect that everyone would be happy. But now I had begun to
share the lives of these Romers and Steinharts and Crests and their
womankind, and to realise the power of pride among their driving
motives. I had come back into large houses and parks and gardens
and into an atmosphere of many servants and abundance and display;
a multitude of dormant memories of Mowbray were revived in me, and
I was reminded that so soon as a human being is housed, fed, and
made to feel secure, it proceeds at once to seek occasion to
swagger over other human beings. It seeks reassurance.</p>

<p>That everyone should have a fair prosperity, no one toil, no one
be enslaved, would not simply leave this overbearing and conquering
craving unsatisfied; it would release it to unexampled activity.
The Romers and Steinharts spent and swaggered like English county
families out of the best novels, with touches of Oriental splendour
they did their insufficient best to restrain. Roderick's
dressing-gowns are indescribable, and I have always suspected
Julian of secret cloth-of-gold pants. The Crests, an old English
family born to coal and ore, were in comparison coldly and
haughtily victorious over the common ruck of mankind. Crest was
about as intelligent in our business as a horse, but his very
incapacity increased his effect of being thoroughbred. He was
silent in the board-room and very cunning; for generations the
Crest family had grown richer and richer by being in the way and
having to be bought out, and I think that both he and Lady Muriel,
his wife, despised the Romers and Steinharts for actively creating
wealth instead of passively insisting upon it. Julian in lapses
from his habitual ingratiation had had occasion to remind me once
or twice that I was a salaried employee, but the Crests made me
feel it from the moment we were in sight of each other. They were
going to walk on me. They were going to be aloof, condescending,
unaware. Such ascendencies were what life was for.</p>

<p>I had been over to lunch with the Crests at Folingden, and Lady
Muriel had made it abundantly evident that I was unsuitable for
sustained conversation. I had to be addressed with polite
consideration, I had to answer when I was addressed, and then I had
to lapse into respect. Having honoured me as one might pat a dog,
she proceeded to talk across me with Mrs. Roderick Romer about the
condition of the poor in their respective parishes. The cottagers
in the Crest village were not providing sufficient girls for
domestic service; the Romer village had plenty of girls, but our
works at Downs-Peabody were too near and were beguiling them
away.</p>

<p>"I want Roderick to close the works to Brampsheet girls," Mrs.
Roderick had said.</p>

<p>"A girl who is not broken to service by fifteen," Lady Muriel
had generalised, "will never make a good servant."</p>

<p>"I tell him he's destroying the breed. He's destroying all their
standards."</p>

<p>Difficult stuff for the excluded middle to cut in upon.</p>

<p>A sad and handsome "Nordic" face with an expression of
enigmatical aloofness had hovered behind Mrs. Roderick's Oriental
opulence. It was the Crests' family butler, waiting with the peas.
He might have been Crest's first cousin. He was exactly the same
creature&mdash;minus the acres that had the coal and iron
below....</p>

<p>I sat in my empty house and I found my irritation against the
Crests and my sense of the exuberant triumph of the Romers and
Steinharts over the Oreshire domestics and poor, interweaving with
my bitter realisation of the share that economic inferiority had
played in my disaster with Clara. I philosophised widely. I was
beginning to understand how the issues and ramifications of sex
spread into the whole complex of social life. I had thought two
years ago that sex was simply a sensuous craving, an appetite
needing assuagement and trailing with it a sense of beauty. I knew
now that that was not the tenth part of it; that was merely the red
centre of a far ampler desire&mdash;a desire for possession,
assurance, and predominance. I understand now how that spread out
into the general competition of life. The desire of a woman to own
and dominate a man, or the desire of a man to own and dominate a
woman or women, is only the intense focus of a vastly greater
nimbus of purpose, to dominate men and women at large. It spreads
out into a craving for servants, for dependents, for wills that
wait on our wills. It branches out into a desire for possessions of
all sorts; it finds a grotesque specialisation in the accumulation
of pets. This hunger for the sense of mastery over life accounts
for the otherwise idiotic pleasure people take in the shooting of
pheasants and suchlike poor, attractive creatures. The ultimate
expression of dominance is to kill. The specifically sexual drive
is merely the apex of a drive which at its broadest is a desire to
own and dominate all life.</p>

<p>And I was, in fact, as sexual, as aggressive upon life as these
Romers and Steinharts and Crests, as Dickon and all the rest of the
world. Only I had failed to perceive it until Clara had developed
me.</p>

<p>So I saw it in my empty house. I saw life stripped bare and
plain as a struggle from which there was no remission. One might
have the freakish desire for scientific knowledge; it was no
excuse. One had to fight for its gratification just as one would
have to fight for any other fantasy that caught one's will. One had
to fight or gratify the <i>lust</i> and the craving within one
before one could serve it, just as one had to fight the conflicting
purposes of one's <i>fellow</i> men and the antagonism of nature.
The service of mankind through science gave one no natural claim
for help or consideration in the scramble of life. One had to
struggle with one's enemy and beguiler, woman, just as much as one
had to struggle against one's enemy and rival and would-be
subjugator, man. That was the quality of life. Fight, establish
yourself, or go under&mdash;go under even though your every wish
was benevolent. And happily for me I had a weapon in my special
gifts and in this metallurgical knowledge I had chanced to
acquire.</p>

<p>I would fight. What else was there to do? The prospect of a
frank struggle to get the better of the world bored me but did not
dismay me. I was fairly sure of myself. I would somehow get to
power and freedom round the reservations of Romer, Steinhart, and
the Crests, as I would somehow get round the entanglement Clara had
made for me to the gratification of my desires. And that was how
the prospect of life spread itself out before me. To that I had
come at that time. Such quasi-scientific, quasi-religious mysticism
as I have now is all of later growth. In those days I had no
intimation of that wilful reconstruction of human affairs which now
dominates my activities. That came during and after the war. That
was a result of the war. Simply I contemplated and nerved myself
for struggle. If I contemplated anything at the end of that
struggle it was a resumption of pure research, aloof from and
disregardful of the common affairs of men. I was a hard young man,
far more narrowly egotistical than I am now.</p>

<p>The memory of those hours is all dark loneliness and stern
resolve. Clara was already at an infinite distance, clean out of my
universe. I had parted from her and given her the furniture, and
she was, I thought, handsomely disposed of.</p>

<p>The candle flared down to extinction at my elbow, and made the
shadows dance about me. Outside a bleak gas-lamp lit the railings
and black bushes of the unfrequented square.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-8" name="b4-8"></a>§ 8. WINDOW WIDE OPEN</h2>

<p class="first">IT was not until nineteen seven or eight that I
could feel I was accomplishing what I had set out to do and that
the Romers had accepted me for good and all as a necessary part of
their combination. By that time I could count myself a rich man as
riches go now. It would be a long and tedious story to tell, full
of petty manoeuvres and cunning shifts and counter-shifts, before
my group came to realise that they had to pay fairly for the
science and initiative I could give them. Crest did his best to
block my intrusion upon the board-room and even drove me to
negotiations with a German-American group. He would not understand
what I signified. His preponderant inheritances were against me. To
this day he treats me with a sort of provisional equality, as
though he had somehow mislaid his social ascendency over me, but
that at any moment his butler might find it in the hall or
conservatory and restore it to him. But Lady Muriel, with the
social flexibility of her sex, now consults me about the incipient
love affairs of her grandchildren.</p>

<p>Within four years I was a director of one of our subsidiaries,
our queer little profitable Clissold Mineral Paint Company, but I
did not become a director of the mother company until after ten
years of steady work. It was interesting, this business; it was
exasperating and it was boring; it was difficult at times to resist
the temptation to smash the game and get out of it all, and the
years between twenty-five and forty-five slipped away almost
unperceived. Meanwhile I continued a respectable scientific career
with a steadily ebbing freshness and vitality of thought. I got my
F.R.S. in 1902 chiefly on the strength of my papers upon
intercrystalline stresses, but two young Germans, Stahl and Butow,
were already running away with my ideas and getting at things I had
been too preoccupied to see. And so my purely scientific career
petered out.</p>

<p>In 1907 I made an attempt to revive my scientific passions. I
organised a private laboratory. It was beautifully equipped, but
from the first it had an incurable flavour of the amateur. Julian
pad just such another. His was as neat as a dressing-bag, as lavish
and handy as the things on the toilet-table of a professional
beauty. It had everything that heart could desire in a
laboratory&mdash;except the heart to use it. Julian even had an
assistant, a London B.Sc., a sort of intellectual valet who brushed
and folded his researches and put them out for him when he wanted
to resume them. I didn't go to that length. I did some reading,
brought myself up to date. But the glory had departed.</p>

<p>I do not think I have spent three hundred hours in my private
laboratory altogether since it was finished eighteen years ago. And
half that time was given to special war stuff of no scientific
value. I feel that such seclusion is now an affectation for me. I
am no longer a leader anywhere upon the scientific front, and I
lack the special energy to push up again. For the last year
Siddons, not the astronomical Siddons but the Cambridge brother, E.
A. P. Siddons, has been using the place and justifying its
existence. Siddons, I think, will presently come in with us and
take his place beside Trippman at the head of the firm's central
research station. When I came into the firm we had exactly
twenty-one men working in our laboratories, from myself to the
bottle-washer and counting in Julian. Now we have four hundred and
seven qualified men doing scientific work for us. It is all I can
do to keep in touch with the new stuff they are opening up. Most of
them are, of course, of the "trained" type and their research is
routine inquiry, but ten or a dozen are fairly original men, and
one or two of these are personalities of quality who promise well
for our future.</p>

<p>Between 1908, when Sirrie Evans died, and the beginning of the
war I passed through several phases of deep discontent and
unhappiness; I shall say more about these experiences later. I was
dissatisfied with life and restless. Whatever I did, I wanted
presently to do something else; wherever I was, I wanted to be
somewhere else. I found business excuses for travel; I went into
Russia, into further India and stayed for the better half of a year
in Siberia. But nowhere was there any escape f rom this uneasiness
of mind, this persuasion that in some essential respect my life was
not right.</p>

<p>Then came the profound excitements of the war, and for a time it
was possible to believe that real and fundamental things were
happening. I have already written about that period in my account
of Dickon. As I have told, disillusionment was harsh and speedy.
Another phase of profound distress and unsettlement followed. It
was complicated by a queer irrelevant passion that distracted me
excessively. The need of a clear unifying purpose in my existence
became imperative if I was not to go to pieces altogether. It rose
to complete ascendency over the confusion of my desires. It brought
me at last to this tranquil sunny room in Provence and this pause
for a final assembling of my purposes, before it is time for me to
go altogether.</p>

<p>I have been working here at this book&mdash;with three brief
intermissions in England&mdash;since last November. It is now June.
Once more I note with gratitude the intimate and tranquillising
beauty of this land. In April there was a great blaze of blossom;
the big Judas-trees flowered magnificently, and a lot of little and
medium sized Judas-trees I had hitherto not observed, its family,
flowered in unison. There was also a great foam of lilac. All sorts
of iris clamoured successfully for attention, and the roses, always
more or less in flower here, suddenly took their task of beauty
seriously and did wonderful things. That was our spring after a wet
and windy March that flooded our kitchen. Now the days are baths of
warm sunshine, and my common daily wear is pyjamas. The nights are
nights of magic. They are scented nights. This week they are
saturated in moonlight, and they abound in fireflies, fire-flies
that prick the darkness intermittently as they drift athwart the
pallid roses and lilies and the black, still bushes and branches.
In the depths of the ivy lurk green glowworms. I find the
nightingales too abundant and very tiresome with their vain
repetitions, but Clementina does not agree; her mind has been
poisoned by literature, and she does not really hear the tedious
noises they make, she hears Keats. On the other hand, the carpet of
sound made every evening by the frogs in the valley below is
indescribably beautiful in itself. We disputed agreeably, and now
she has gone and left me to my study table and my thoughts.</p>

<p>Here, tranquil before the still moonlight, serene as shining
silver, defended from moth and mosquito by an invisible gauze, I
can brood over my papers into the small hours. I have been sitting
here not troubling to write since eleven. It is now nearly one.
Here I can get all that Romer, Steinhart turmoil into something
like its proper perspective against the world at large. I can look
back upon it now across an interval of five-and-thirty years and
make a companion picture to those still hours I spent in Edenbridge
Square when my adventures with Romer, Steinhart lay all before me.
Space, time, and the pressure of life are all altered in their
values now. I can see our huge combine broadly, and my work for it
as a quite typical item in that change of scale and material that
is the essential fact of current history. I can see how
extraordinarily representative we are of the general quality of
contemporary life, both in its large wilfulness and its retarded
consciousness of itself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-9" name="b4-9"></a>§ 9. THE MARKET TREE</h2>

<p class="first">HOW new and significant a thing we are! Of the
various substances that we extract from crude matter and pour into
the workshops of the modern world there is scarcely one that was
even thought of a hundred years ago. Even the various steels we
co-operate with White and Halbow in producing are new. Steel was a
fudged, rule-of-thumb product in 1825; nobody knew what it was
exactly; it was variable and uncertain, and to have produced a
hundred-pound lump of it would have been thought a miracle. Now we
can make steel play tricks like a performing seal; we can make you
steels as brittle as glass and steels almost as flexible as rubber,
we can make crystalline steels as obdurate as carbon and malleable
steels that at a temperature below red heat you can draw into wire
and beat into leaves hardly less thin and ductile than gold. All
you have to do is to pay the price. Some of these steels are still
expensive toys, but to-morrow they will be staple needs. But that
is only an overflow of our metallurgical activity. Steel is not our
main interest. In ten years' time every other automobile body will
be made of our light alloys, and in twenty there will be scarcely
an aeroplane in the air that is not made of some stuff of ours.
Again, for main roads, for all roads and streets where the wear is
hard, Romer, Steinhart in twenty years' time will supply the only
possible road metal, all over the world. There is hardly a modern
contrivance from an incandescent lamp to a gramophone needle and
from a toughened lamp chimney to the type that will print this
book, that does not owe something to us&mdash;and pays it.</p>

<p>All this has grown f rom nothing in less than three quarters of
a century. In 1858, the original Steinhart, who was a Swedish
chemist of Jewish extraction visiting England, met the original
Romer, who was then travelling in mohair trimming for his uncle.
They met in a train between Sheffield and London, and Steinhart
talked about the slackness of the English and the peculiar
opportunities that were, he thought, going to waste upon the coal
and iron properties of the lordly Crests. Romer, who was a youth of
nineteen at the time, and who detested mohair and his uncle, jumped
at the possibilities of independent action these remarks opened
out, and made himself so ingratiating to Steinhart and afterwards
so importunate to Crest our present Crest s father, that at last he
brought together the first experimental company, the founder
company of all our branching tree. This was the Crest Slag Works,
and it was afterwards reconstructed as the Crest Bye-Products.
Romer, who had a really vigorous intelligence, went off to Germany
and studied metallurgical chemistry for two years to fit himself
better to control this business he had made possible.</p>

<p>In 1879 he succeeded in shifting the central works from the
Crest properties to Downs-Peabody so as to be in easy reach of the
Brampsheet and Hinton-Peabody deposits, and the Crest Bye-Products
Company was swallowed up in the bolder enterprise of Romer,
Steinhart, Crest and Co. with a capital of fifty thousand pounds.
The rearrangement of the names showed, among other things, that the
Crests were no longer on the back of the concern but dragging along
at its side. Where alas! they continue to drag.</p>

<p>But I do not see why I should write here the details of an
industrial development which are easily accessible to the curious
in a variety of forms. The external facts have always been stated
very plainly and fully at our annual meetings; we are widely
documented. What interests me now is the social and mental
significance of this rapid and amazing growth. It spreads through
the once formless worldwide commerce in metals and raw material for
mechanical production, it sends out processes, it joins on to
cognate bodies and bodies that become cognate in a way that is
extraordinarily suggestive of the appearance of a vertebral column
and its linking up to rudiments of rib and limb in the body of an
embryo. And side by side with it and capable of either consuming or
amalgamating with it are similar and rival organisations. Parallel
with it are other great organising systems dealing in oil, great
food trusts, cotton, shipping combinations. It is a new economic
structure where formerly there was fragmentation, open market, and
crowd commerce. It is only being recognised for what it is. We
ourselves, Romers, Steinharts, Crests, and myself, and all the
other twenty-odd outsiders who have come into the direction of our
main or openly associated concerns, are only beginning to see what
it is we are doing. Hardly any of us realise the full extent of our
tentacles; we expand as if by instinct, and at times our right hand
has scarcely a suspicion of what the left is closing upon. It is
still more interesting to compare what we are, we creatures
inflated by expansive forces beyond our expectation, with what we
might be and what perhaps we ought to be.</p>

<p>I do not believe that our primordial Steinhart dreamt for a
moment of the nature of the egg he was laying in the nest of the
conservative Crests. There was a bolder imaginative touch about our
ancestral Romer; he may have had previsions of the things that are
coming. Not one of our present gang has ever seen what we are doing
as a whole. Or if anyone has, the vision has vanished again
instantly like the Holy Grail. Here am I in Provence, the new
Thebaid, living the life of a hermit&mdash;with Clem installed
within a mile as the official temptation&mdash;in order to get a
view of it. Possibly Roderick comes nearer than anyone to a
comprehensive conception of our role in the world's affairs. He is
something of a statesman. He made a mistake in taking a peerage. He
is rather lost up there as Lord Brampsheet. He has barred himself
out of the House of Commons by this splendour, and only discovered
too late that he can make quite good political speeches. It was
some feeling between the wives about the Crest barony that added
Brampsheet to the glorious roll of Lloyd George's peers. Crest
wanted his caparison, Lady Romer saw an opportunity of drawing
level with Lady Muriel, and manifestly it was impossible to honour
the impassive Crest and leave the energetic and possibly malignant
Sir Roderick untouched. And Sir Roderick at the time did not
realise what he was doing for himself. Perhaps it is just as well,
for him as for us. He likes to argue, and this vice of debate might
have grown upon him until he gave to party what is meant for the
business of the world.</p>

<p>He has imagination; he has ideas; he is aggressive; he is not
content to fall into the moulds of preceding things. He will talk
at times in quite revolutionary fashion. He respects Crest more
than I do, but he hates him just as much. He respects Crest more
than I do, because there is still a lingering instinct in the Romer
blood, due to a thousand years of pogroms, that these hippoid types
should be propitiated. He dare not believe as I do that modern
science and mechanism have made cavalry and the landed gentry
obsolete. Apart from this weakness my Lord Brampsheet is as
progressive as myself and much more energetic. To him we owe the
steady extension of our interests beyond industrial production to
international finance. Through his tentacular instincts and the
intervention of banking it is that we are in co-operation instead
of cut-throat competition with our German and French and Swedish
parallels, and allied and linked to mining and coal interests in
all parts of the world, to cotton growing, and gold and diamond
mining, which were once as remote from us as concerns in another
planet.</p>

<p>Roderick is physically a bigger man than my Julian, and his
methods of address are less insinuating and more familiar.
Occasionally he seems to be trying, as the Americans put it, to
"jolly" you. By an odd coincidence he resembles the Bolshevik
leader Zinovieff so closely that when first I met the latter in
Petersburg in 1920 I laughed aloud. They might be identical twins.
Yet neither is pleased to hear of this resemblance.</p>

<p>The parallelism is more than physical. Their imaginations are
similar, constructive, and a little grandiose; they have an
enormous amount of mental energy, and mental energy, I should
think, of very much the same type and grade. In 1920, after the
phase of extreme Communism, Bolshevism in Moscow was as
intellectually bankrupt as any "capitalist" government. In spite of
such purely comic efforts as Lenin's "electrification of Russia"
and Trotsky's valiant splutterings, it plainly did not know what to
do next. But Zinovieff had already hit upon the spacious idea of an
appeal to Asia, and the evocation of a sort of godless Islam out of
Russia and the Turk and Central Asia. So far as any politico-social
idea has ever realised itself, Zinovieff's dream might realise
itself. And so in this vastly richer Western muddle of ours, which
has so much more time and stuff to waste before it gets down to
bare realities, I find in Roderick an idea where other people seem
to have no ideas; not, indeed, a clear idea, but an adumbration
with something very like an outline, the idea of a sort of shelving
or subordination of political forms and a reorganisation of
economic and social life under the control of a union of big
financial and industrial groups. The same idea looms up even more
distinctly in some American circles. It foreshadows a statecraft of
realities. Beside Roderick, our old Asquith seems to me as unreal
and empty as one of those figures of Chinese porcelain that nod
their heads and move their hands in country houses. I do not mean
that Roderick has ever sat down and worked out his idea to even its
broad implications. He has never detached himself enough from
current activities for that. But he has it. Power has happened to
him. In this present world he is one of a number of men who wake up
in middle age to find power flowing past within their grasp. He has
at least awakened. He blinked, he snorted and made startling
sounds, he shut his eyes again, but he had awakened.</p>

<p>He knows as well as I do that the politics, the parties, the
'governments, and empires of the world to-day are all a swiftly
passing show, masking, but growing at last dimly transparent, to
reveal the real processes that are going on in human life.</p>

<p>But these things belong to a later part of this book. I am
discussing now the motives and ideas that have made us what we are.
Roderick interests me most of all our group, and I watch him as
closely as anyone. What do these gleams, these phases of broad
politico-social vision amount to altogether with him? Very
little&mdash;yet. To me they amount to much more, but with me also
they are conceptions that stir rather than conceptions that
control. With him they have a quality almost of improper thoughts.
When we talk of these things and I betray a belief that there is a
vital reality in our talk he becomes manifestly a little shy, a
little scared. "But to come back to business, my boy," he says. "To
come back to business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He has not made himself. He has been made. His motives in
building up this great system about Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co.
have been all of a piece with my motives. He wanted to live, to
assert himself vigorously upon things and upon life, and he came in
at a lucky angle. I believe, with the same differences that make
him physically a contrast with myself, his mental and moral life is
very parallel to mine.</p>

<p>And for the rest of our people I find no driving force at all
commensurate with the great plant which nominally belongs to us,
but to which we indeed belong. Men like Spink and Gedge came in by
making themselves useful, young Brand by making himself agreeable.
Trippman is able and alive, but almost wholly a chemist. Siddons
may develop; there is more in him than in the others, and he is
still very young. The rest are wheels or links. Several do good
research work and make excellent arrangements to exploit their
results, but they do not seem to apprehend the business as a whole
and in relation to the world as a whole. They run after fine houses
and fine wives; they appreciate knighthoods and baronetcies; or
they sniff after the imaginative excitements of the artistic and
dramatic world, and the sands of their lives run out.</p>

<p>None of us are very great sportsmen; it is too heavy a call on
our time. Lord Crest is still under the impression that he is a
great English country gentleman a little distended by commerce, and
so in need of a sort of moral tight-lacing. He is enormously
respected in the Carlton Club, and both his sons have been through
the Guards. Everard represents Offerton in the conservative
interest and will some day succeed his father as the drag on our
wheels. Sons and father are all associated with various attempts to
create strike-breaking and quasi-Fascist organisations in England
against the active Labour people. Gods! how that sort of prancing
and threatening exasperates some of our men, some of our very best
men! Crest has recently had his portrait painted in the Ruritanian
style as Lord Lieutenant of Oreshire, scarlet and splendid. The
background even is romantic. No chimneys are visible. There is a
beautiful carriage with horses in London for Lady Crest, as well as
several cars. Lady Muriel is a friend of the Family, of the most
exalted Family.</p>

<p>"My boy," said Roderick, when I was letting myself go one day
upon Crest's costliness and general ineffectiveness, "have you ever
thought of his value as our shopwalker?"</p>

<p>"Mask," said I.</p>

<p>"Mask!" said Roderick with a sudden outbreak of racial
self-derision. "You've said it, my boy! He can go and do our
business where I can't show my nose...."</p>

<p>I sit here and think over these things, I think of Roderick and
Julian and the rest of our group, and the wives and houses and
dinners and week-ends, I review the galaxy of our chief
shareholders and dependents and profit-spending associates, not
forgetting my little neighbour Lady Steinhart, whom I have already
described; I recall what I can of the phases and moods, the
cravings and pettiness of my own story, and then my mind wanders
off to our works, to our wonderful plant with science and subtle
ingenuity in every trough and tap and furnace and mould, to our
staffs of skilled workers, to our collateral associations with
mines of every type in every climate, to the great regions we
search for ores, fluxes, solvents, to the cultivators whose output
we buy by the countryside. When I think of this worldwide system,
seeking, extracting, recovering, and sorting the crude substance of
the earth, fusing, sublimating, condensing, fining, allaying,
placing its finished substance at last in the hands of ten thousand
sorts of manufacturer and returning its sifted by-products to
fertilise a hundred lands, when I think of the myriads of workers
whose lives we direct, the hundreds of myriads with which our work
is associated, and the far greater multitudes whose employment we
make possible, when I contemplate the totality of all this
achievement threaded through the jostling human crowd, and then put
the swift, incessant efficiency of this human process of ours side
by side even with the best of the motives that move us who are its
nominal directors, it seems to me it is not so much we who have got
all these things out of the earth as the things themselves that
have called to us and compelled us to extract them.</p>

<p>They have compelled us as the soil of any place selects and
determines the trees that shall grow there and stunts them or gives
an extravagant vigour to their growth. Romer, Steinhart, which
began as a single sapling, has become a great tree, that like a
banyan, the Indian market-tree, expands a grove and joins to other
groves and shelters great multitudes and may at last coalesce into
one single canopy of confederated businesses to cover the economic
life of the world.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="b4-10" name="b4-10"></a>§ 10. OLD STYLE AND NEW</h2>

<p class="first">OUR main plants, our essential companies, are
things of a new economic type. I doubt if many people realise how
new they are. Our businesses are not only new in scale and
correlation; they are new in their internal constitution. There is
not the same necessary antagonism of employer and employed in them,
because they are not merely nor mainly toil-shifting organisations.
We employ hardly any brute labour at all in our own concerns.</p>

<p>Almost all our labour is either skilled or semi-skilled. Over
three thousand of our people draw more than a thousand pounds a
year each from us, and that number increases in a larger proportion
than the increase in our general employment. There is nobody at all
with us on a flat subsistence wage; not a soul. And since our
plants have been costly to construct and are destined to be
superseded by better plants within very definite limits of time,
since many of them would deteriorate rapidly with disuse, it has
always been the policy of the firm, from our early Crest
Bye-Products days onward, to keep its workers content and
interested in our common welfare, and so never to have a break in
production. We have never been held up by a strike in all our
history, and we have never closed down a plant upon its staff
because of trade fluctuations. We have kept our workers together
and our plants going steadily&mdash;if only for the sake of the
machine. Business shrewdness and a certain goodwill were both
active in determining that policy; the original Steinhart was, we
know, a student of Robert Owen, and regarded his employees with an
amiable generosity of intention. His idea, and it is still a
tradition of the firm, was that there is a sort of moral
partnership of the business inherent in those who have been
employed by it for some time. But I won't pretend that our virtue
has had to struggle against our interests; old Steinhart's good
intentions happen to have yielded the very best policy possible for
us.</p>

<p>Wherever we have bodies of our own workers in sufficient numbers
we subsidise the science teaching in the elementary and
continuation schools in that locality as generously as possible,
and at Downs-Peabody we run a big technical institute at which
scholarships can be held, side by side with our research
laboratories. We have nine professors with salaries far above the
normal University scale. Spink and Gedge are both sons of men who
worked in the Crest Bye-Products for weekly wages. We have a
savings' bank organisation and an investment system; we have
workers who, some of them, hold up to two thousand pounds' worth of
our ordinary shares. We pay no day wages at all, and we are
steadily changing our weekly wage-earners to a monthly and
quarterly salariat. In alliance with our staffs we participate in
subordinate housing companies, recreation grounds, cricket clubs,
swimming-baths, two art museums, and a number of social clubs. We
subsidise two weekly newspapers to explain what is going on in our
business and what becomes of our products.</p>

<p>All this is just sound modern business. We cannot afford to use
our premises as social battlefields. We do not discuss the right of
this or that person to a greater or lesser share of the surplus
profit of our activities, but we mean to keep our processes going
on as largely, handsomely, healthily as possible, and this is the
way it has to be done. And one must remember we are not demoralised
by any vehement competition&mdash;which is the true cause of most
sweating and commercial ugliness. The sweating system is only an
economic expression of fear and greed, the economic bad manners of
rush conditions. But we happier moderns are working often with
patented processes, often with a monopoly of raw material, with a
staff of workers that it has taken half a century to assemble, and
always with a scientific and technical superiority that makes us
unapproachable. Energetic new people do not seek to wrest things
out of our hands; it would be hopeless; they come in and offer to
work with us.</p>

<p>We do not spread our broad methods about the world without
internal friction. The Crests have held lands in Oreshire since the
thirteenth century; great grabbers and savers they have always
been, a hard-fisted, firm-mannered race; they guessed right at the
dissolution of the monasteries and grew mightily at their expense.
Galsworthy's Forsytes are mild stuff compared with our Crests.
Crest seems to have kept the beastly economic mediaevalism of his
ancestry intact. He is as hard and mean as a French peasant and a
British duke rolled into one. In the unproductive disorder of the
Middle Ages the only ways of getting rich were to oppress, compel,
sweat, or rob outright. Usury was forbidden, and besides, usury
required arithmetical gifts accorded only to the Jews. Trade was a
rare occupation, and as a trader you monopolised naturally, even if
you had to fight and murder to do so. There was no increase in
values going on; what you gained someone else lost. What you got
you held with a scowling, swaggering dignity tempered only by the
showiest possible largesse on holiday occasions. When some unasked
improvement in our workers' condition is in contemplation, Crest
will still come to our board meeting with the clatter of rusty
armour in his voice and demand where all this sort of pauperisation
is to end. Where is the money to come from? he asks.</p>

<p>Nothing will ever convince him that our dividends do not come
out of the pockets of other people, nor that our profits are not
abstracted from the wages of workers who have been held down while
the abstraction is effected. He is equally persuaded that the
object of foreign trade is to pauperise foreigners. He is not
really an employer as we conceive it; he is a mediaeval robber
baron who offers terms. He is always trying to force our people
into rifle clubs and the Territorials because it would give them a
sense of discipline, and once he wanted a man dismissed because he
did not touch his hat to him outside the works. The man was,
unfortunately, a humorist. "Hey, my man!" said Crest. "I don't
think you know me!"</p>

<p>"Don't think I do," said the man. "Who might <i>you</i> be ?
"</p>

<p>"I'm Lord Crest."</p>

<p>"I'm Billy Watkins. What aba't it?"...</p>

<p>It took nearly half an hour of our time at the next board
meeting to convince Crest that gestures of social abjection were
not among the duties for :which Billy Watkins drew his pay.</p>

<p>"We can't Interfere with their manners, my boy," said Roderick,
pawing Crest's shoulder with a familiarity that made Crest pale
with anger, and infusing an unusually Eastern oiliness and the
shadow of a lisp into his voice, "and that's all about it. Why! if
we began on that sort of thing where should we end? I'm always
speaking to Julian now as it is about tapping in the tops of his
eggs. <i>Will</i> tap 'em in. It isn't done in the best families.
It gives us away. All of us Romers. And Clissold went out of this
very room before me only yesterday. He's equal to going out in
front of <i>you</i>. No sense of precedence. You've got to put up
with this sort of thing these Bolshevik days, Crest, and thank God
if they do their work."</p>

<p>"If you <i>want</i> to see discipline go to the devil&mdash;!"
flashed my Lord Crest, and dropped the subject....</p>

<p>But as our tentacular connections have spread our interests from
our original mineral and metallurgical operations, we have come
into relations with labour and with organisations for production
developed upon less fortunate lines than our own. There we find
ourselves tangled in responsibilities of every grade of difficulty.
That's the less pleasant side of our picture. In the. early days,
for example, we bought the whole Crest Collieries output upon a
sliding-scale arrangement and left the treatment of the miners to
the parental Crest, their Union and God, and afterwards we filled
our increasing need for coal in the open market. Now we have the
infernal Crest mines practically on our hands; we hold all their
shares, we are bound in a Federation to this, that and the other
line of action, and indirectly by various purchases, working
agreements, and amalgamations we have become miners and sellers of
coal as well as consumers, but we have no finger in the direction,
nor in the labour organisation.</p>

<p>Mining is as ancient a business as the first Pharaohs; it has
always been a form of mass labour, and, like all labour which draws
its traditions from the ages before machinery, it is a very
unpleasant, inhuman, and wasteful form. That side of our great
machine remains excessively unsatisfactory to me. It runs along,
jarring and occasionally jamming, wasteful in substance and
wasteful of life. The typical British mine-owner still belongs very
generally to the horse-headed class; the equestrian tradition still
dominates mine-owning. Economically he is an antiquated nuisance.
Since he gave nothing for his coal and ore he does not care how
much of it is wasted so long as the royalties come in. Royalties to
these landowners are a tax on every coal- consuming industry. Cheap
coal is as necessary to the industrial life of Britain as good
roads. Coal winning is a common interest that we industrialists are
fools enough to treat as a private trade.</p>

<p>I am not on the Crest Collieries directorate, and it is
difficult for me to do more than gibe and grumble at this
equestrian inheritance. Our mining and mineral interests are dotted
all over the world, and conditions in the mines that concern us,
here and abroad, are determined by conditions in the others beyond
our reach, and one set cannot be changed without the other. Before
we can begin a fight with Vishnu we must be reasonably sure that
Siva will not rise against us both. Much the same sort of thing
applies to our transport interests also. We are big enough to be
affected, but not big enough yet to exercise an effective control.
I would like to see our tentacles grow and grow, bigger and
stouter, until a single combine could take the whole mineral
resources of the world into one problem. But that seems a long
dream still, and before it can be realised and the creative Brahma
can get to work, Siva, in other words the passionate
destructiveness of labour awakening to its now needless limitations
and privations, may make Brahma's task impossible. I would even
favour nationalisation if I believed, which I don't, that there was
even a sporting chance of the politicians sustaining a competent
management.</p>

<p>I am afraid of the obstinate injustice of all these ancient
forms of employment, mining, shipping, transport work which still
carry on the traditions of the gang slavery of the ancient world.
There seems never a day when one can turn them round into a new
path and animate them with a new spirit. Yet on their present lines
they are accumulating wrath and disaster for the whole system. The
wastage of life is frightful. There is no more reason now why coal
should be picked out from the seam bit by bit by hunched-up men
working in darkness and dirt and foul air than there is that
steamship furnaces should be hand-fed by sweating stokers or the
harvests of the world reaped by hand.</p>

<p>Some day I may begin to see more clearly than I do at present a
way of extending our hard and scientific methods into these old
industries that the needs of finance and the markets have obliged
us to annex to our comparatively clean, original system of
enterprises. I would like to tackle a whole coal district as one
system, survey it and sound it, reassemble the housing and surface
cultivation, burrow into it with passages and air tubes and pour
out coal tar, carbonised road-metal, pipe-steam and electric power
for the towns and houses and factories, and so let the whole
countryside run happily until nothing more was left below to burn.
That might not be for a century or so, and by that time our
industrial people would be moving on quite cheerfully to some new
district and some fresh phase in the exploitation of natural
resources, and we should have the old Black Country coming back
daily and beautifully to agriculture and horticulture again. And as
for our miners I would have them on salaries instead of day wages,
work them at most five days a week and ten months a year, pay them
for two months' annual holidays, pension them comfortably when they
had done thirty thousand hours' work, even if they hurried up and
did it soon, and get tons of coal out of them where now we worry
out hundred-weights. This is no dream, but an entirely practicable
possibility. Only Crest and his kind, and the general foolishness
that tolerates and supports them, stand in the way.</p>

<h2><a id="b4-11" name="b4-11"></a>§ 11. SIRRIE EVANS</h2>

<p class="first">THIS book, however, is not to tell of my social
and economic imaginations and desires, but about the conflict of
motives that has gone on in me, beneath the surface of my very
considerable business activities. I write about my motives not
because I suppose they are at all remarkable, but just because they
are not at all remarkable among my class. I try to lay bare in
myself the soul of a successful business man. A considerable number
of active men nowadays are in much the same case as myself. I am a
fair sample of a new attitude of mind which is appearing here and
there in the world and becoming more and more common.</p>

<p>I worked. I succeeded. I appeased myself with women.</p>

<p>That is my history in brief. I followed out the programme I had
planned in my empty house. But I was not satisfied. Al ways I was
restless. And since mine is an intelligence which dresses itself up
very little, this unrest of the spirit found its chief outlet for
many years in fresh sexual activities. I suppose all the energy of
life is sublimated from the sexual energy; the waters have a
compelling tendency to return to the ocean from which they
arose.</p>

<p>I have been what the eighteenth century called a rake. It is
natural for me to find redeeming characteristics in a rake, to
plead that he is at least obliged to be personally clean and fit
and seemly, and that he must needs be of some imaginative activity
and responsiveness. And also that no mere force of physical desire
makes a rake. Grossness is no incentive to change and exploration;
there is no need in modern life for a simply lascivious man to
betray that quality to the world. The house of ill-fame is the
natural resort of the man of good repute. But to me such
conveniences, such imitations, have always been shameful and
abominable. Bodily desire has been the lesser part of this business
to me. Whatever else I have desired, invariably the leading thing I
have desired has been personal response. And the next thing to that
has been&mdash; something hard to name, a kind of brightness, an
elation, a material entanglement with beauty.</p>

<p>And still there was something more. I think now that I have been
the victim of one of those exaggerations of promise that our
restless, purblind old mother Nature never hesitates to put upon
us. Always through my fuller years there was a feeling, a
confidence I never had the power or will to analyse, that somewhere
among womankind there was help and completion for me. How shall I
express it? The other half of my androgynous self I had lost and
had to find again. You remember the fable Aristophanes told in the
Symposium.</p>

<p>I have never found that completion. For me, at any rate, it has
been no more than a sustaining illusion. But I do not repent of my
love experiences. I am glad old Nature put that <i>ignis fatuus</i>
into my wits and nerves to lead me the dance I have had. All these
affairs have been touched by imagination and have revivified my
imagination. I have nothing to reproach myself about in them. I
have never prostituted a human being in any of them, I have never
cheated, made dishonest promises, nor wilfully inflicted
humiliation. If I have lied at times I have lied in small matters
to mitigate or reassure; I have escaped from essential and
fundamental lies. I am a rake unrepentant and unashamed.</p>

<p>I state these things here not by way of apology, but because
they interest me as matters of fact. It is too often assumed that a
rake is necessarily a seducer, a sort of area sneak of the
affections. He breaks down the sweet temple of virtue in spite of
its pitiful pleadings and resistance; ransacks it, leaves it
hideously and incurably defiled, departs with triumphant mockery.
But that is pure romanticism. There are just as many women, in this
modern world at least, as ready for love and as impenitent about it
and as little desolated by it as men.</p>

<p>If I were seeking an exoneration for my life I suppose I could
make great play with the fact that I was so tied to Clara that I
could not marry again and live in a seemly, ordinary fashion. I am
sorry for that fact because I would have liked to have sons and
daughters; I envy Dickon his youngsters, those sympathetic,
organically linked extensions of oneself; but if I am to be frank
with the reader as with myself, I am not sure that if I had been
married and tied to almost anyone of the women I have known
intimately, my life would have been essentially different from what
it has been. I understand how deeply husband and wife may trust one
another, but there must be excitement in love and a sort of magic
and adventure. It must be difficult to sustain the excitement,
magic, and adventure year after year, with anyone whose every
gesture and intonation one knows by heart. A separation and then a
homecoming to dear familiar things? That is a different story.</p>

<p>But then, as I have written already in my account of my own
futile marriage, I think that the same forces that are breaking
down the separations between small businesses, fusing production
into concerns upon a world scale, and driving the peasant from his
immemorial holding, are breaking down the walls of the home. The
faithful, fruitful wife was a possessed and secluded woman. But now
the home is a service Hat, a lodging, a suite in some hotel, and
the man who once tilled the soil his ancestors tilled before him
wanders from job to job about a world that is almost as homeless
for him as the high seas. Man, who settled down to plough and
increase and multiply twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, is now
getting adrift again in great streams and clouds; it is a sort of
harvest of mankind from the fields into the great camps of the new
towns, and the woman who was his helpmeet is becoming once more his
camp-follower. Or is ceasing even to follow his camp and, against
all nature and precedent, setting up one of her own. Or is simply
at large in the streaming crowd and amazed.</p>

<p>My life has been spent where the disintegrative forces are most
at work. As a young man I was living rather exceptionally the sort
of existence a great and increasing number of young people are
living to-day. I indulged in great freedoms that are no longer
freedoms but widespread practices. From the days of my separation
from Clara until I was nearly thirty-two my opiate for that
recurrent hunger in my heart was a series of intrigues that often
overlapped and sometimes went on simultaneously two or even three
together. The facts of these relationships are so Hat and
commonplace that it is hard to convey the glamour, the sense of
depth and delight and reassurance they could afford.</p>

<p>Most of that satisfaction was the most patent illusion. I have
to confess that, considered as a man, I am the least marvellous
that can be imagined; the chief word in my description upon my
passport is "normal," repeated several times; remarks,
<i>"none"</i>; eyes grey, hair brown. A new hat makes me
unrecognisable to most of my acquaintances. I suppose I am fairly
alert and interested in people, and that is my most attractive
quality. Yet my entire lack of personal splendour has not prevented
my being the happy lover of a number of charming and interesting
women. I can only suppose that they wanted to make love as much as
or even more than I. I admired them, I was grateful, delighted in
them, and as a man I was good enough to pass muster. 0 f course, we
called each other "wonderful" and "delicious," and so forth. We
were so, I suppose, in that light&mdash;as any meadow may be
wonderful at dawn. What I gave them was almost exactly what they
gave me&mdash;an exquisite sense of personal reception, a vividness
of being, a surcease of this pursuing hunger of the heart that
overtakes us in leisure and security.</p>

<p>Women have gained great freedom even during my lifetime. A few
generations ago a woman's work, as the proverb said, was never
done. Now for many it is over before it has begun. It is not that
they are better paid, but that they are wanted less. Much knowledge
that was once hidden has come to them. Motherhood is no longer an
oppression, nor even the fear of motherhood. For a great number
this means a release of sexual imaginations. They have blank time,
unexpended energy, and an inherent predisposition for the
excitements and beauties of love.</p>

<p>I do not think these modern women want men very badly; they want
love. Usually they are married women or women already possessing
lovers. But their man is masterful and oppressive, or he is
negligent or wandering in his attentions, or preoccupied and dull.
Mr. Smith or Brown reminds our lady too plainly, too flatly, that
she is just Mrs. Smith or. Brown. He ceases to make her a goddess
for his adorations. In a life of thin, unexacting routine love also
becomes a routine. She has no sense of glorious giving, no sense of
self-escape. But when she steals away to a lover all that is
changed. You can hardly call her an unfaithful wife, for when she
steals away she is no longer a wife. She ceases to be Mrs. Smith or
Brown. That is the gist of the whole thing. As her lover ceases to
be Mr. Jones. They both keep holiday from these commonplace
verities. They go out of the world. She becomes as much a goddess
as Diana visiting Endymion. As Mrs. Brown she would no doubt be
betraying Mr. Brown, but as Diana in a secret cave remote from the
things of everyday she betrays nobody. Restored to her
self-respect, to her belief in her possible loveliness, she can
return to her too casual and negligent husband with a pleasant
sense of dignity preserved and equality restored.</p>

<p>It is a fundamental convention in the romantic version of life
that when a married woman takes a lover she prefers him to her
husband. In three-quarters of the illicit love affairs in such a
great centre as New York, London, or Paris, this is not true. It is
probably less true even than the converse proposition about men.
And the mere suggestion to most of these modern women rakes that
they might go off and live in blissful union with the lovers they
have been adoring would, I believe, be quite sufficient to end the
affair for them. I cherish no illusions about my relations to the
goddesses for whom I have been a worshipped and worshipping god,
dear friends though they have been to me. For only one of them have
I been the anti-husband. For most, I have no doubt that if the
husband's life or prosperity or pride had been seriously threatened
I should have been sacrificed with about as much regret as, let us
say, a once worn dinner-dress that he had found too frank and
discreditable, or a pet dog he did not like.</p>

<p>And yet in the secret cave we would be very earnest about our
business and things would be very lovely between us. In all these
affairs there are not only questions of more or less, but each one
has its distinctive elements that do not enter into the others.
Athwart my memories of these little opium doses of love there flits
the tall, slender figure of Sirrie Evans, with her fever-touched
cheeks, her strong profile, and her burning, deep-set eyes. She
came into my life like any other adventure, but perhaps a little
more vividly and happily. There was nothing to tell me that she was
destined to live with me for nearly seven years and die at last
exhausted in my arms.</p>

<p>I met her first at a dinner party in London&mdash;I think at the
Rudhams'; it was a large white dining-room with grey marble
pillars&mdash;and she did not sit next me but across the table. We
glanced at each other and liked each other. We were both being held
rather tenaciously by dinner partners of the low- voiced,
semi-confidential type, the sort that cut up dinner parties into
horrid little cellules of viscid duologue. I seem to remember that
my own lady was plying me with questions like the questions in an
old Confession Album in a search for common ground, and I rather
suspect that Sirrie was being subjected to arch and clinging
compliments. Our eyes met in a common distress which changed to a
mutual appeal. We recognised kindred. "Let's get out of this
somehow," we telepathed.</p>

<p>The couple at the end of the table were talking rather loudly;
the man was a challenger, the sort of man who makes controversial
statements and looks about him. "The Russian moujik," he said,
"will be the Saviour of Europe, simple, industrious, profoundly
Christian, worshipping his Tzar as God's Vicegerent." They all said
that before the war.</p>

<p>I let a question on my left fade out neglected. "I don't agree
with you," I said. "Have you been there?"</p>

<p>"They have divine beards," said Sirrie, grasping the situation
with decision and speaking directly to me.</p>

<p>"They are extremely kind to animals," said the lady at the
end.</p>

<p>"I judge by the evidence of the Russian literature," said the
man I had contradicted. "Dostoievsky in particular."</p>

<p>It was a large reply, but I took it up manfully.</p>

<p>The others fell helplessly into their proper places, and we kept
the conversation at our end of the table general until the ladies
departed. By that time we had discussed Russian literature and
Russian characteristics, peasants, and primitive people generally,
whether peasant art and peasant costumes were not everywhere very
much the same in Europe and Eastern Asia, and whether the
essentials of peasant life had altered very greatly since the
Middle Ages, and so it was natural for me when presently we went
upstairs to go across to Sirrie and pick up the threads again.</p>

<p>It was not so much a case of love-making between us as of mutual
attraction. We arranged to meet next day to see what there was of
peasant art in the Museum at South Kensington, as though that was
the most natural thing in the world to do. Later I learnt her
name&mdash;I had missed it before&mdash;and discovered that a
sturdy, dark, thickset man with an expression of defensive
self-satisfaction was her husband. I saw him watching us, and when
he was aware that I observed him he turned away. She ignored him.
Always she ignored him. And I ignored him too, as completely as I
had ignored the Queen's Proctor in my separation from Clara.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey by writing and telling the
distinctive effect and charm of Sirrie as I knew her at that time.
She was a brave thing&mdash;essentially brave. It was not the thing
she said or the thing she did that seemed to matter so much as her
sty Ie and carriage. She had a gallantry all her own, an alertness,
very fine dark blue eyes, very fine brows; her cheeks were a little
hollow and her voice very beautiful. But altogether she was
beautiful. She had a lovely adventurous humour that seemed always
seeking for the fun and quaintness and colour of life. She had a
strong impulse to travel, to wander into fresh surroundings, to
discover freshly different things. She was a born explorer.</p>

<p>The greater substance of our early escapades was altogether
innocent. She loved to prowl in out-of-the-way parts of London, to
peer into queer shops, to see contrasted sorts of life. She wanted
a congenial man to go with her. We spent days exploring
Whitechapel, Shoreditch, Clapham, the Crystal Palace. She would
laugh with delight at the old and neglected exhibits at the latter
place. Her sense of the absurdity of forgotten pretensions was very
acute. "What were they up to here?" she would ask. "What did they
think they were up to?" We never missed the stuffed animals; we
traced the decay of the ethnological groups. The Picture Gallery
was a great joy to us. And the "antediluvian animals." Seeing
things with her was like looking through a telescope in the
sunlight at familiar garden flowers. We stole a night or so from
our outward for our inward lives and went for walks and boated
together upon little flower-smothered Surrey and Sussex rivers and
canals. They were not so much passionate times as glad times that
we spent together in those days. Never before had I known so keen a
flavour of pure holiday.</p>

<p>It was only very gradually that I came to understand that the
underlying force in her life was an intense hatred for her husband,
and that beneath her keen superficial interests and quick responses
she hid the wounds of some profound exasperation. She had been one
of four brilliantly pretty sisters, and he had married her before
she was eighteen. I do not know what particular things had happened
between her husband and herself; she never talked to me about them
and I never questioned her; but they had so scarred her that even
her happiest moments at that time were touched with the quality of
something done in his despite. I am by no means sure that she was
altogether in the right. Possibly her hatred of him was unjust and
freakish. She was quite capable of inexplicable animosities. She
had neither justice nor morality in her apart from her aesthetic
standards. She never said an action was wrong. She would condemn it
as "not pretty." A gallant act was good enough for her.</p>

<p>Even in those days Evans was rich and growing richer in that
slow, unproductive, creeping way that adds nothing to the wealth of
the world. To him a wife also was no doubt an acquisition. From his
point of view he had bought her, but the four lovely sisters
thought they were a gift to the world. He had to beg for her
thrice; when he married her I imagine he was already exasperated by
the resistance to his wooing and by her gay flirtations with other
men. She on the other hand may have been exasperated by the fact
that she had yielded. He was the sort of man who is filled with
dull, deep anger at the idea that he is not the most attractive and
irresistible male in all time and space. The Old Man of the
primordial tribe must have been much the same. He seems to have
tried to break and subjugate Sirrie so soon as she was legally his.
She tried some "nonsense" with him, and he stood no nonsense from
her.</p>

<p>But I do not know what happened. I do not know what happened and
I do not care to know. Perhaps very little happened. Perhaps she
merely discovered that Evans was Evans and that she was inseparably
linked to him. She had sold something for too Iowa price, something
of fundamental value, something without which life was spoilt for
her. And she had sold to an ungracious purchaser. At any rate,
within a few months of his marriage he had this slip of a
schoolgirl fighting him bitterly and successfully for her
freedom&mdash;for her quite excessive conception of freedom.</p>

<p>The weakness she seized upon at first was his inordinate tender
vanity, his fear of appearances. She made him realise that at any
moment she might appeal against him to friends, to servants, to
passers-by. Her appeal might be startling and unjustifiable; he was
not safe from her unless he let her go her own way. I know that
quite early she ran away from him for two days and dealt with him
from an unknown address by telephone. "Leave me alone," she said in
effect, "and I will still appear to be your wife. Otherwise, though
it tears my world to pieces, I go."</p>

<p>But even though in a sort of way he left her alone, she would
not respect his public honour. She despised and hated him too much
for that. She broke the treaty, not he. I do not defend her. I set
these things down. She came to me out of this ugly past, and it was
not my concern to judge her.</p>

<p>Evans, blinded by his essential vanity to the fact that the most
animated of women can still find many men entirely unattractive,
sought to awaken her jealousy. She should be kept short of
attention, kept short of money, left about and humiliated. She
retorted by a scarcely ambiguous friendship for a young Guardsman,
Lord Hadendower, about whom I know nothing. I never met him; he was
killed at Soissons. Evans made his infidelities conspicuous and
stopped her allowance altogether. She concluded rather rashly that
the former action made a divorce impossible, so she, too, made her
infidelities public and met her financial inconveniences by running
up bills. All their world talked. He did not like advertising to
restrain her credit and her allowance was turned on again. For a
time she had the upper hand, and Evans was her suitor.</p>

<p>This bickering, dismal business developed. He shirked the rude
publicity of a divorce for five or six years. She tired of
Hadendower very soon and flung him away from her. But that meant no
kindness to Evans. She was not a woman of strong passions, but an
absence of passion is often associated with an absence of shameful
emotion, and she was lively in her imagination and wild in her talk
and letters, and quite reckless of appearances. Somewhere she had
met a dangerous and folly-begetting word, the word Orgy. She was
much sought after socially, a brilliant talker, a mimic,
unfeelingly funny, capable of a calm indecorum of speech that left
people gasping but delighted, and Evans was acutely aware of the
powerful support she would have in any open breach in which he was
not entirely in the right. So he waited until he was entirely in
the right. For a time he made no breach. He had developed a
consuming desire to recover her. He tried to buy her back, threaten
her back; at last even to win her back. But nothing he could do now
could touch her detestation. Her life became more and more a
scoring of pleasures, social successes, stolen outrageous
adventures that had a subsequent publicity, defiant freedoms,
against him, the heavy thing to which she had got herself chained.
His love, such as it was, became at last a deep vindictive hate.
That was the bristling situation into which my wanderings had led
me.</p>

<p>I just imagined I had had the good fortune of an exceptionally
refreshing <i>passade</i>.</p>

<p>I had known Sirrie scarcely four months when Evans exploded his
long-prepared mines under her feet and commenced proceedings for
divorce. It was his amiable intention to make it as scandalous and
dirty a divorce as possible and ruin her completely. Since at last
he must come to complete publicity, he seems to have decided, then
the uglier it was the better. He wanted to drive her into hiding
and exile so that her visible existence should no longer trouble
him. She should know what poverty was. She should appreciate the
rare and precious advantages she lost by despising him. Every
possible or probable man was cited as a co-respondent so as to
present her as entirely abominable, disgust her lovers with her and
deprive her of any help in the world. It was a great case for the
newspapers.</p>

<p>None of her lovers stood by her at the outset. Not one. I was as
bad as the rest at first, jealous and ashamed. I had not known a
third of the things thus dragged into the light. My first feeling
was anger, because she had troubled so little about my being
implicated. She must have known of the gathering storm.</p>

<p>So far as I was concerned we had been cleverly watched and
documented. The other side got at me very neatly with a nasty
little clerk who broke things to me. They were so quick at the
crisis that Sirrie had no chance to tell me beforehand of what was
coming. I managed to be out of London when the case came up. I read
the first day's proceedings in the morning paper.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said I, over my breakfast things at Downs-Peabody.</p>

<p>"Damn!" became, so to speak, the password of the day.</p>

<p>I took my little car and started vaguely north before Julian
could get at me.</p>

<p>The plain English of that is that I ran away. I ran away for the
better part of a day at an average speed of about thirty-five miles
an hour and left my reckless, shameless, brilliant fellow-sinner to
face her consequences alone.</p>

<p>In the morning I was blindly angry with her, merely angry. I saw
myself&mdash;I remember the phrase among my
self-reproaches&mdash;as "one of a row of accursed fools." My views
about the charming levity of promiscuity were badly shattered. It
was only as the morning wore on that she became anything more in my
mind than an object of anger. Slowly she came through the wrathful
mist, no longer as a feminine mischance, Eve and be damned to her,
but as herself.</p>

<p>I began to see her face and hear her voice. And&mdash;for all
the circumstances&mdash;her form was still slender and her face
still fine.</p>

<p>How was the business taking her? After all, it wasn't going to
be such very great fun for her. She must be having a nasty time up
there in London while I was motoring northward, a very nasty time.
She would have to go into the box. That was the idea that stuck
itself like a thorn to my mind and gradually changed its tone. I
tried to think of her still as a shameless woman, exposed and
exposing all her friends. But I could not do so. I ceased to think
of what she had deserved by making me ridiculous and asked myself
what she must be feeling and how she would be carrying it off.</p>

<p>I began to be obsessed by the figure of her as she would stand
there, with the court staring at her and the clever ones sketching
her, slender and flushed and holding her head up&mdash; I knew she
would hold her head up. Whatever happened to Sirrie, she would
certainly keep her head up. That, you see, was how it was set on
her neck. And there would be no whimpering or being overcome. Once
I had surprised her at a theatre with her eyes bright with tears
and that memory supplied the high light of my picture. Tears were
possible to her but not weeping. "If I did these things I did
them," she would say. "But I didn't do them like that." And that
would be true. The more illogical the distinctions she made, the
sounder they always were.</p>

<p>They'd ask her filthily intimate things. The old judge and
lawyers would gloat over her. The court would be crowded. At the
back all the young lawyers would be packed, alert not to lose the
chance of a juicy line. Evans would see his lawyers did the job
properly and that the juicy lines were forthcoming. She had written
some exaggerated letters. She had a trick of using improper
words&mdash;almost as a child uses them to startle. She had done
that in her letters to me, and I had no doubt she had done it to
everybody. They wouldn't give such letters a chance, I knew; they
would read bits out without the qualifying context. The pure-souled
gentlemen in the wigs and gowns would boggle modestly at her worst
expressions as they read them. The court would blush to its
straining ears. "I'm afraid I must paraphrase this, me lud." She
had been wild and fantastic. These comparatively passionless women
can say and do the most outrageous things at times&mdash;through a
kind of insensitiveness. "Why not?" is their formula.</p>

<p>"How old is she?» I asked, and did little sums. She had been
married at seventeen. She was not four- or five-and-twenty.</p>

<p>I can only recall dimly now what sort of see-saw went on in my
mind. I have to guess at most of that as though it was something in
the mind of a stranger. I must have felt a great disgust at the
whole business, I must have been indignant with her and have
condemned her or why should I have continued to travel north hour
after hour?</p>

<p>But I must have dismissed all that indignation later. I cannot
recover it. It is like trying to reconstruct the torn letters from
the wastepaper basket of the day before yesterday. Perhaps it was a
sort of inertia kept my foot upon the accelerator.</p>

<p>"If I go back to her," said I.... "It's a complete return."</p>

<p>My decision hung fire all day and then it exploded. Suddenly I
knew what I was going to do. As if I had known all along. It was
the last possible train to London I took that night. It was behind
time, and I got to London in the small hours. She was all alone, I
found, except for one sister, at Berridge's Hotel. I telephoned and
was answered by the sister&mdash;she was in bed and asleep, tired
out. The next morning I went to her.</p>

<p>"I've come to stand by you," I said.</p>

<p>"You'll learn a lot of new things about me," she answered,
looking me squarely in the eyes. "Not very graceful things."</p>

<p>"I've read the morning papers."</p>

<p>"You could hardly help it. It isn't a pretty case, is it?"</p>

<p>"Unpleasant for both of us," I said. "I admit the surprises.
Nevertheless, I'm going to stand by you."</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;the things&mdash;. They'll bring them up in the
ugliest way&mdash;but substantially&mdash;they will be true."</p>

<p>"I don't expect to see you vindicated like a Drury Lane heroine.
I've thought that out."</p>

<p>"What does this mean? What do you mean to do?" "Stick by
you."</p>

<p>She stood without betraying any emotion, rather like a woman who
weighs a business proposition. Then she turned to me with the same
air of entirely controlled reasonableness.</p>

<p>"But you didn't know of these other affairs. You came in late
and innocent. I gave you no warning. I ought to have had the
sense&mdash;There is no earthly reason why <i>you</i> should come
into this mess. It's <i>my</i> mess. My little affair with Jim.
Silly to think so much of Jim&mdash;to hurt oneself annoying a
thing like that! I drove Jim frantic and he's got me. I've...
There's been some rotten men in this. I've been an utter fool at
times. No one will blame you for standing out."</p>

<p>"No one will blame the other fellows either. I see that. But you
want some one. In this business. After all, I'm the last on the
list. Forgive me if I'm unsentimental; I won't even pretend to be
in love just now&mdash;but I'd as soon see a little child drown
under my eyes, a little child I knew, as let you go through this
alone."</p>

<p>"But after?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?,"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;I like you. More than I dreamt I did."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I stand by you&mdash;now and afterwards. I'm not a green
youngster. I've told you&mdash;how things are with me. You won't be
taking advantage of my innocence. I know a little about women. It's
easy to love you. But somehow also in spite of all this&mdash;I
respect you. I'm not shocked. I don't care what their evidence is.
It can't alter the knowledge I have of you. You have&mdash;a crazy
side. I don't know all you may have done, but I have some idea of
what you are. For me you began when we met. Have I seen nothing of
you? All the evidence in the world won't convince me that your
soul&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;isn't as straight as your
body."</p>

<p>She did not speak at once. She shrugged her shoulders at my last
sentence. She seemed to be taking in the new situation.</p>

<p>"You'll come to the court?"</p>

<p>"Every day. Your brother. Your friend."</p>

<p>"Like some one holding my hand! Oh!... Billy! when you know the
sort of thing&mdash;!"</p>

<p>She stopped short. The tears Bashed for a moment in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Friendship," said I.</p>

<p>"Friendship," she echoed, and her eyes questioned me, and then
slowly she smiled at what she saw in my face. "You old brick," she
said, and for a moment her mouth was awry before she recovered her
smile. She held out her hand. "All right."</p>

<p>We clasped on it, a hand-clasp that was better than any
embraces.</p>

<p>"I've been playing rather a lone hand," she began.</p>

<p>"I've deserved what I've got...."</p>

<p>She bit her lip and looked helpless.</p>

<p>"Put a hat on," said I with my spirits rising unaccountably.
"Run! The court won't wait."</p>

<p>And in that way in the lounge of Berridge's Hotel I married
myself for all practical purposes to the scandalous Mrs. Sirrie
Evans and faced for the first and last time the legal consequences
of my adultery. For two days I sat in court, to the great interest
of the smart women who crowded it, and was conspicuously assiduous
to the needs and comfort of the respondent. And when it was all
over I carried her off and put her in a flat and for all possible
purposes treated her as my wife.</p>

<p>It was an irrelevant accident, an extraordinary digression in my
life. I went to her and I went to the court primarily because of a
sense of obligation. I was bound to stand by the consequences of my
own misconduct. But insensibly and very quickly my attitude changed
to one of what was I now admit unreasonable championship. It was
unreasonable, it was instinctive. I felt that Sirrie was
essentially as honest as, and finer spirited than I, that her sex
put her at a frightful disadvantage and threatened to penalise her
horribly for acts no more immoral than many I had committed with
impunity. I took up the cause of laxity in general, in my
appearance at her side. I defended the whole series of my paramours
in her. We were fellows in the common business of erratic and
forbidden adventure and desire. But from championship and
fellowship I passed very rapidly to a keen affection and pity for a
creature misused by herself and by the :world that had produced
her.</p>

<p>And the affair opened a new phase in my own life. I had been
hitherto an exceptionally lone animal. Now I found myself carried
completely out of myself by care for another human being. I did my
ineffectual best to reinstate Sirrie socially, to mitigate the
penalties of those sins of hers that I could understand so well. I
enabled her to take a pretty little house, secured her good
servants, and would not dine nor associate outside my business with
any people who did not treat her as my wife. We travelled and
visited together. We were faithful to each other, and every moment
that my very active business occasions permitted we spent
together.</p>

<p>Weighing this phase over now, I am most struck by the fact that
our living together was not the result of any passionate crisis,
not the outcome of any grand passion. There was no tremendous
declaration, no irresistible elopement. I do not remember any
strong desire to possess her or be with her before we lived
together. There was no such urgency. Our union was forced upon us
by Evans' malevolence. I am not sure that I should have gone to her
if I had not been cited in the case. Before the divorce we had
liked each other greatly, been pleasant to each other, made love
lightly. My dominant mood at the trial I can best describe as a
sort of indignant tenderness. That so fine a thing should be
treated so scurvily! So fine a thing!</p>

<p>It was only after we had kept house together for some time that
we developed very deep personal feelings for each other. We grew
into one another by imperceptible degrees.</p>

<p>I have never been able to make up my mind whether my early life
was one of exceptionally starved affections or not. I know of no
quantitative standard by which one can measure oneself against
others in these matters. I have never been able to determine
whether young people are as capable of love as their elders,
whether disinterested love is not necessarily a concomitant only of
the fully adult state. My own youth was certainly a very loveless
time. I had an imaginative love for my father, and a brotherly
affection for Dickon was always present, but beyond that there was
very little. There were no passionate boyish friendships, or if
there were they have faded out of my mind. Even before our mother
estranged us by her second marriage I did not care very greatly for
her. Either I never loved Clara or that love is effaced. I was on
good terms with many men and women, but none seemed necessary to
me, and for none was I prepared to sacrifice myself in any way.</p>

<p>My impulse to defend and vindicate Sirrie surprised myself. It
also surprised Sirrie. She had liked me greatly from the first, but
after her divorce she became acutely interested in me and curious
about me. There was a phase in our life when she seemed always
asking me questions about myself&mdash;questions that were
excessively difficult to answer. I had not been in the habit of
answering questions about myself. I was something new and
unexpected in life for her, and, as it appeared to her, something
unexpectedly good. She had had bad luck with her men. She threw
over her idea of being a wicked woman, a sort of defiant insistence
upon it as her <i>métier</i>, without another thought. I heard no
more of it.</p>

<p>She set herself to understand my motives and the way I worked.
Her social outlook had never included a laboratory, a railway, or a
smoking chimney, and she thought that the lower classes were all
either cottagers or servants. Trade unions were as much outside her
world as totem groups. She thought that when you wanted anything
you went to the best West-End shop that sold it, and I doubt if she
realised completely that the first step to getting it was to wring
or wrench its substance out of the soil or out of the rocks. How
far she ever carne to understand my ideas I do not know. She
accepted my urgent preoccupations with business as a strange but
forgivable thing in my composition. Since it mattered to me, it
mattered to her, but it might just as well have been the Turf or a
preoccupation with big game.</p>

<p>But if she did not understand my ideas, she came to understand
many things in my character that are still hidden from me. She
controlled me for my own happiness, invisibly, imperceptibly. She
gave me a disinterested friendship, which is so much greater a
thing to give than sexual love. While she lived my discontent with
life was greatly allayed. I never worked so well as I did during
those years.</p>

<p>When I had made a home for her I had had a streak of warm
self-approval in my mind. I had thought I was doing something
rather handsome and generous. Instead, for the first time I was
getting the most precious things in life, love, faith,
understanding, fellowship, and the reality of home. I was getting
all that was good in marriage except children. But plainly she was
tuberculous; we knew from the outset that her lungs were "wrong,"
and we did not dare to have children.</p>

<p>It was a friendship, it was a fellowship; it was these things
first and foremost. We made love; we had spells of intense
happiness of that kind, but our reality was our friendship, based
on our unfaltering belief in each other's soundness and goodwill
and our common repudiation of the current moral verdict upon us. I
do not think we would have been very jealous of each other if there
had been any real occasion for it, but there was not. I was too
busy in those days to follow up any competing interest, and she was
too tired of men to experiment with them further. Jealousy is an
active reaction to a sense of insecurity, and we were both very
secure with each other.</p>

<p>Our first home was a little pinched-in house on Richmond Hill
with an iron balcony in front and a wedge-shaped walled garden
behind. There Sirrie could be ingenious and decorative and
house-proud. But later we had to move to Bournemouth because of her
health; I was growing in wealth, I could give her a fine new house
there, gracefully designed, and she made a pretty garden amidst
rocks and pine-trees on a slope that looked towards the sea. I
would run down by the afternoon express like the most orderly and
moral of business men, and she would meet me in her car. How well I
remember her erect figure and her fine thin bright face,
brightening still more at the sight of me. And every time I settled
down in the car beside her to be driven home, to my home, I would
have the same thought pass through my head&mdash;the wish that she
was really my wife and that this pleasant security against passion
and unrest could last for ever.</p>

<p>But I had the best of these two homes. While I was there we had
each other, and she was very skilful in making me happy. What did
she do when I was away? The "nice" people kept away from her both
at Richmond and Bournemouth&mdash;which did not prevent them from
being endlessly curious about her doings; and the incorrect people
who did call were for the most part rude or dull or humiliating
with their freedoms and confidences and assumptions. She took my
name of Clissold; she was my wife in the sight of the butcher-boy,
but everyone who mattered knew about us and remembered about her.
She was wonderful stuff for the imaginative anecdotalist <i>sotto
voce</i>.</p>

<p>She read enormously. The house was always full of new novels.
She was acutely critical of the problems in conduct they raised. We
had great discussions. She made me a reader of contemporary
novelists&mdash;a thing unusual among business men. She also played
with her garden endlessly. But she was an impatient gardener. She
suffered a few acquaintances. She must have spent endless hours
staving off the talk and tedium of their limitations with the new
game of bridge, that presently developed into auction bridge. She
became a great bridge player&mdash;when I was out of the way, and
if these callers and associates bored her at the time, she got a
certain compensation in preserving their choicer fatuities for my
entertainment. She could be extraordinarily funny, but at times
more than a touch of bitterness was mixed with her derision. She
developed an acute perceptiveness for furtive tentatives to
gallantry on the part of timid, vain, mean and unsubstantial men
and for the elements of pose and falsehood in the romantic
confidences of the women.</p>

<p>Those years we spent together seem to me now in the retrospect
to have passed very quickly. They were broken up by long journeys I
had to make through the Urals, into Siberia and into the Canadian
Rockies. It was impossible to take her on these expeditions. But
wherever I could I took her, for her passion for travel was
insatiable. She went to the Argentine with me and to Sweden. It was
only very slowly and too late that I realised how rapidly she was
dying. The last three winters of her life were spent, one in North
Italy and two in Switzerland, and it was in a sanatorium in
Switzerland that she died.</p>

<p>I do not remember when her cough began, but it is an essential
part of my memory of her. She grew thinner, her cheeks more hollow
and more flushed, and her eyes intenser. As she grew weaker she
grew more daring. A craving, a great love for speed grew upon her.
Motoring was developing, and I got a big Italian car that could
jump up to eighty miles an hour on a straight. She would crouch
together by my side, wrapped in her furs, her eyes gleaming over
the grey stole that covered her mouth, silent, ecstatic. "Faster!"
she would whisper.</p>

<p>Once or twice she drove&mdash;and these were memorable
experiences for me. I held myself still beside her, controlling an
impulse to snatch the wheel from her poor wasted hands.</p>

<p>As I realised her weakness and her sufferings, insensibly
companionship gave way to protection. For the last four years her
movements were more and more restricted, rain and sundown drove her
indoors; she had to live in rooms at a measured temperature; she
could no longer face exertion. Her restlessness increased
perpetually; she did not like any place she was in because she did
not feel well there; she wanted to go on, where the sun was still
kindlier and the air easier to breathe. She had phases of acute
unhappiness, but her hopefulness always rescued her. She felt the
shadow of social isolation that lay upon us as though it was a
chill, and that, too, drove her on. She fretted, she had a vague,
shamefaced ambition for some social demonstration, some
vindication, some recognition imposed upon people. I cannot imagine
her troubling about anything of the sort if it had been freely
available. But she felt and imagined exclusion. The further one is
abroad, the less evident is that exclusion. At an infinite distance
from London all English people meet. She wanted to be met. It was
childish, no doubt, to feel desire for a worthless thing simply
because it was denied, but are we not all children when it comes to
such social uneasiness?</p>

<p>When she died we were planning a journey to the South Sea
Islands and afterwards a tour right round the world. I could
contrive it without breaking up my own activities too much, for
everywhere now there are minerals and possibilities for Romer,
Steinhart. She would sit with a soft green and blue and crimson
Spanish shawl about her, the most fragile and ethereal of
creatures, with a dozen travel books upon her couch and one or two
on a table close at hand. "I must see Easter Island," she would
say. "It cannot be far out of our way to see Easter Island."</p>

<p>I would bring the Atlas and sit down on the couch beside her.
"Let us see where it is. Yes.... Yes, I think we can bring in
Easter Island."</p>

<p>Her hand would stroke my head.</p>

<p>"Billy Cook, the dear World Tourist Organiser. You can really
spare me all this time?"</p>

<p>"I want to see these places," said I.</p>

<p>"I'm rather a lump to take about. But down there I shall
recover. Last week&mdash;unless that machine is wrong&mdash;I
gained two ounces. And we will swim in the warm, warm sea."</p>

<p>"And I will guard your toes from the sharks with a cutlass
between my teeth."</p>

<p>"Brave Billy! Of course you will! Kiss me, Billy dear."</p>

<p>She hoped and longed for the south seas to the very day of her
death. She hoped to the end. On the morning of the day when she
died, she explained how favourable a thing haemoptysis was.</p>

<p>"I believe that was the last of that stuff," she whispered. "One
coughs away... all the diseased tissue... all the tainted blood...
and then, of course, one heals... heals."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, my dear," I said. "Talking isn't good for you. You
will have to heal quickly if we are to start next month."</p>

<p>She was very tired that afternoon. She had had a spell of
coughing so violent that it had alarmed me; she had nearly choked
with blood. The flow ceased at last; the doctor gave her a sedative
and she went to sleep in my arms. "Stay with her," said the doctor.
"You had better stay with her. If she wakes she may cough again.
She is very weak now."</p>

<p>But she did not cough again. A tired, flimsy, pitiful frame she
had become, something that one just took care of and treated very
gently; her motionless eyelashes touched my cheek, and she passed
away so softly that until, with a start, I noted her coldness, I
did not suspect that she was dead.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-12" name="b4-12"></a>§ 12. MIRAGE AND MOONSHINE</h2>

<p class="first">SHE died in 1905, and I was just forty. Her death
left a very great gap in my life. While our relations lasted my
life had an effect of being filled and my hunger of the heart was
assuaged. I was needed, I was necessary. If I was not fully
satisfied I was at least fully occupied. Since then I have never
quite lost the sense of loneliness as a thing painful in itself. I
had acquired a habit of looking to someone else for kindness. I
wanted some one to smile a welcome to me and be glad when I came
home. It was a new need.</p>

<p>During my years with her I had parted from an earlier, harsher
self and become the more tolerant and less intense self I am
to-day. My earlier self seems to me to have been tacit, whereas now
I am explicit; it was, in comparison with what I am, compact of
self-reliance tempered by lust. Only through desire did I ever
trouble myself in those younger days to propitiate my
fellow-creatures. For it seemed I could get everything else without
propitiation. But that had now been changed. In part that change
may have been a natural change as one ripens, but far more I think
it was the effect of my relationship to Sirrie. With her
friendship, her charm, and at last her weakness, her involuntary
appeal for kindness and service, she gave me in a few brief years
all that is given to most men by marriage and parentage. I had
acquired the habit of referring myself to the needs and standards
of a life that was not my own. From her at least I did not take.
From her I had learnt the fear for something one desires to protect
and cannot always protect. Her death, moreover, coincided very
nearly with the close of a phase in my relations with Romer,
Steinhart. The fun of winning my way to the inner fastnesses was at
an end. My position was acknowledged and my share established; I
was Roderick's most trusted colleague; I was becoming free to do
something, if I would, with our great businesses.</p>

<p>I remember myself during that decade of copious low-grade living
that passed at last into the Great War, as empty with the
deprivation of my lost solicitude for Sirrie, consciously lonely,
and with my old dissatisfaction with the disconnected
multitudinousness of my impressions greatly deepened and broadened.
The world as it ceased to be a battlefield became a riddle. The
struggle for existence being won, came the less natural question of
what to do with existence, to which question&mdash;except for
reproduction&mdash;nature offers no instinctive reply. So we fiddle
about with reproduction and do not even reproduce. I will not say
that such moods of discontent possessed me, but they were always in
waiting for me when I was not vividly active. They did not hinder
me from continuing to play a leading part in the aggressive
extension of Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co. throughout the
world.</p>

<p>Copious, low-grade living seems to me to express the quality of
that time very exactly. The automobile was becoming prevalent, and
prosperous people were using it more and more in headlong attempts
to escape from their tedious and uneventful selves. The vacuous
face of our collective life grimaced with the pretence of a solemn
grief at the death of plump old Edward the Seventh, and then went
through expressions of grave expectation at the accession of his
worthy, conscientious, entirely unmeaning and uninteresting son.
Save for some irreverent verses by Max Beerbohm that solemn front
was scarcely broken. The parading attention to the immense passings
and comings of our intrinsically insignificant royal personalities,
blocking the traffic, filling the papers, delaying business and
legislation, caught my mood of disillusionment, and accentuated for
me the extraordinary triviality of human association. These
pervading unavoidable royal personages stole dignity from
knowledge, mocked progress, and dishonoured all life for me. When
they went in public procession to thank the God of Earth and Heaven
for an averted illness or a fresh addition to their respectable
family, or to open something or come back from somewhere abroad
whither they had expensively, ridiculously, emptily gone, I found
the closed streets, the oafish spectators, incredibly
exasperating.</p>

<p>This stuff was the formal crown of my existence. This was the
Empire, the legal purport of my world. For this, I reflected, our
great organisation was supposed to work, for this we won our
beautiful metals from the obdurate earth, and fought nature and
human indiscipline. To this end we increased the wealth and power
of mankind. The German cousins, the Russian cousins, in their still
more gaudy uniforms, came and went; envious rich American women
crowded to London, bowed down and worshipped.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that this sort of thing might go on
indefinitely. Life was not even tragic in those days; it was
neither tragic nor comic; it was elaborately silly and vaguely
dangerous. Flags, armies, national anthems, stuck upon my world
like straws and paper gew-gaws on the head of an idiot. But I did
not conceive this idiot could blunder into actual war.</p>

<p>The result of maintaining political forms that are beneath human
dignity and religious pretensions that are beneath human belief is
to impose a derisive cynicism upon great multitudes of people who
would otherwise live full and vigorous lives. I link the feverish
playing of games, the onset of rowdy dancing, the development of
night-clubs in every city in the world, the hunt for immediate
pleasures that was already in full tide before the war, with this
dominance of outworn loyalties and faiths that block out any living
vision and sustaining hope from the general mind. Amidst the
rhythms of jazz and the heavy blare of national anthems, what other
voices could be heard? Industrial recriminations there
were&mdash;strikes. The mere shadows then of our present
considerable discontents. They brought no hope to me.</p>

<p>My unhappiness in those pre-war years, you may say, was
essentially grief for Sirrie. And the personal loneliness to which
she had left me. But that is not exact. The loss of my
preoccupation with Sirrie exposed me much more than I should
otherwise have been exposed to the clamorous futility of the times.
But it was the times that distressed me, the times and a certain
growth of my mind, my powers and my sense of responsibility. I
wanted not simply a better life for myself, but a better life
altogether. Thousands of people were as consciously bored and
distressed as I was, by the resonant emptiness of those years.
Millions were bored and feverish without any clear apprehension of
their trouble.</p>

<p>It is one of the most respected conventions of the contemporary
literary man that people's lives and actions are never determined
by political and social conditions, but only by personal reactIOns.
That preposterous limitation may be the reason why so few fully
adult people read modern novels. Life is more coloured by the
morning paper than the literary man will admit. I know, for
example, that the enormous preoccupation of the community with the
fuss of the king's coronation and with the posturings of the German
Emperor, irritated and depressed me far more than the actions of
any individual with whom I came in contact during that foolish
period. I was a unit in a half-witted social body quite as much as
an individual, and I suffered acutely from the mental degradation
of the half-wit who included me.</p>

<p>For a little while I was interested in the new invention of
flying. I worked upon a group of light alloys with special
reference to the elimination of wood from the framework, and I was
a good deal at Eastchurch in 1911-1912. Those were primitive times
in the air. I used to have joy rides in aeroplanes of 35 h.p. and
less, and Shortt was considered a bold pioneer when he put 80 h.p.
engines into his machines. But after a few flights I lost any sense
of wonder when we ceased to bump along the earth and roared up over
the cows in the meadows and worked our laborious spiral way up and
up until we were over the Medway and looking down on the Thames and
Essex coast. There we hovered, churning the sweet air, rather
conscious that we were holding ourselves up and that it was
undignified to come down too soon. It would have been a fascinating
method of travel if there had been anywhere to go, but the only
really long journey aviators made in those days was a sudden,
unexpected nose-dive out of the world. They were only discussing
air-pockets in those days; no one was ever strapped in, and every
landing was an adventure. But the essential things were done.</p>

<p>"This we can make," said I to myself, high and swaying unstably
above the Thames estuary. "This we can improve. This is only the
beginning...."</p>

<p>And then: "What will be the good of it?"</p>

<p>It was this pointless achievement of flying that first forced
upon me the realisation how largely inventions were being wasted on
mankind. That foolish gift-giving uncle, Science, was crowding up
the children with too many mechanical toys. The children I half
discerned could only misuse them and hurt each other. Or fail to
use them at all. I recall that thought, and with it I associate a
downward vision, washed with bluish haze, of little fields, a pale
yellow thread of road along which a slow-moving black dot was a
motor-car, and a group of farm buildings seen in plan, all roof and
hayrick.</p>

<p>"What will be the good of it all?" said my private devil in my
ear. "Why bring the duffers sailing up here? Leave them to grow
turnips and swap diseases till the crack of doom."</p>

<p>I suppose I did quite a lot of promiscuous love-making in those
vacuous days. It is nothing to boast of and nothing to conceal. For
a long time I found no one I could love very much, and I began to
prefer women who plainly did not care for me very greatly to women
who brought a personal passion, or the pretence of one, into the
game. I was ready enough to admit they were charming and delightful
creatures, but not that they were personally indispensable, and
that I was tormented by yearnings, uncertainties and monstrous
fidelities on their account. I began to feel a tolerance for
meretricious love which I had once thought revolting. But I rarely
came to absolutely meretricious love. If I had been a poor man and
manifestly ungenerous I should have failed in some of these love
affairs in which I did not fail, so much of paying was there in it,
but that is not quite the same thing as meretriciousness.</p>

<p>Such was the quality of my life in the middle forties. Cut down
in this fashion to its heart, it was friendless, loveless and
aimless. But that is not to say that there was not steady,
extensive, interesting toil, much fellowship and kindly commerce
with pleasant men and women, aesthetic gratifications, fun,
excitements, a great deal of incidental happiness in it. But always
there was dissatisfaction waiting for me in the shadows and the
quiet moments. It was not good enough. Life was passing by. I was
not being used to the full. By all the common standards I was a
winner at the game of life&mdash;and I was doing nothing with my
winnings. Romer, Steinhart was a big thing to be in, but I was not
taking Romer, Steinhart anywhere; it was taking me nowhere in
particular. If I had been a less successful man I might never have
discovered my unhappiness. But then I should have had no story to
tell. I should have lived, suffered, spun my hurried time about the
whirlpool and vanished according to precedent.</p>

<p>Came the huge, thronging, deafening excitements of the war, the
stresses and fatigues of the war, the headlong hopes of that period
of Reconstruction that I shared with Dickon, and our rapid and
immense disillusionment. That disillusionment, I see, was necessary
and had to arise from vast and tragic events. If it did not seem
ungracious to the valiant dead and to those who still suffer in
body and memory from that tremendous catastrophe, I could find it
in my heart to say the war was a good thing for the world. Not in
what it destroyed nor in what it achieved, but in what it released.
I have told of our reactions to the war in my account of Dickon. I
have told of our realisation of our own haste and superficiality
and how at length we subdued our minds to the real nature of world
reconstruction, which that period of frothy projects had only
caricatured. Of my ill-conceived attempts to enter politics I will
tell nothing here; they were tiresome, humiliating, expensive and
absurd. We had, we realised, to brace ourselves to serve in a cause
for which we might never see even the beginnings of a triumph, but
an imperative and unavoidable cause, a cause identifiable with the
main process of life.</p>

<p>That needed a great effort in me, all my mind, a reexamination,
a reorientation of my ideas. Without that effort I should fall back
into the dissatisfied cynicism of the pre-war period. But my
efforts to pull myself together, for what I have already termed the
last lap of living, were complicated and impeded by an emotional
entanglement into which I had drifted without any appreciation of
its possible power. I was deeply in love, in love in a fashion that
was new to me, and I was in love with a woman who had no knowledge
of nor interest in these vital troubles.</p>

<p>Once more, just as in that early passion which led to my
marriage, I found my double nature tormenting me. I had vowed in my
empty house in Edenbridge Square that no woman should ever again
turn my life about. I would take my freedoms and have the better of
women. And for all my incidental adventures and digressions I had,
in the main, kept my course. Suddenly now I found myself in the
toils again. I had a mistress without whom, it seemed, I could not
live. And, equally, I could not live with her and continue
myself.</p>

<p>This story I have to tell about myself and Helen is I perceIve,
an experience different in kind from any other love affair in which
I was ever involved. It is too recent for me to write about yet
with complete detachment. In a sense Helen has been exorcised here
in Provence; I can hardly trace how; but the scars are fresh and
plain. The essence of every great passion is by its nature a thing
untellable. We do not tell our love experiences; at best we tell
things about them. Only the reader who was in love with Helen could
see her as I saw her. For other people she was a strong, clever,
ambitious actress with a charming smile, an adorable voice, a
reputation for a hot temper, and an ungracious way with obtrusive
admirers. Many people found her beautiful, but no one called her
pretty. She was a mistress to be proud of, but only a brave man
would attempt to steal her.</p>

<p>For me she was wonderful and mystical; she was beautiful and
lovely for me as no human being has ever been; she had in my
perception of her a distinctive personal splendour that was as
entirely and inseparably her own as the line of her neck or the
timbre of her voice. There was a sideways glance over her shoulder
full of challenge; there were certain intonations, there was a
peculiar softness of her profile when it was three-quarters turned
away, that gave me an unanalysable delight. My passion was made up
of such things. If that explains nothing, then there is nothing
that can be explained.</p>

<p>We met before the end of the war, and then she was a
comparatively unknown young woman, very fearless, and quite
prepared to be interested and excited by a man of my standing and
reputation. She fell in love with me and I with her, and I ceased
to trouble myself about any other woman. We loved romantically,
ostentatiously. Hitherto she had despised her suitors. We became
lovers, friends, allies and companions. F or a time I was very
happy again. I immersed myself in the reconstruction movement, and
I spent all the time I could spare and refreshed myself greatly
with her. She, too, was busy with her profession; she was doing
fine work and becoming well-known, and almost from the first we had
to fit our times rather carefully to get together as we did. But to
begin with we did not mind that trouble.</p>

<p>How easily can we fling one common name over different things
and believe they are the same! I suppose everyone would say that
with Clara, with Sirrie, with Helen, just as with the chance love
affairs that have happened to me, I was a lover and the business
was love. So far as the chance love affairs go, they had many
things in common&mdash;the furtive elation, the gratified senses
and vanity; but all these three relationships, these relationships
that signified, were unique in root and branch and substance. With
Clara I was animated by the sexual egotism of the young man, with
Sirrie by a profoundly tender protectiveness, with Helen by the
glamour of a beautiful personality. Only when we began to be
estranged did I realise the hold her quality had taken upon me and
the depth of my feeling, my utterly irrational feeling, for
her.</p>

<p>What a lovely thing Helen was&mdash;and is! She not only evoked
and satisfied my sense of beauty in herself, but she had the
faculty of creating a kind of victorious beauty in the scene about
her. She had a vision that transformed things, annexed them, and
made them tributary to her magic ensemble. It was our custom to
snatch a day or so and go off together from my business and her
career, and I do not remember a single place we ever went to that
did not reveal, through her, the most happy and wonderful
qualities. It was as if the countryside turned out to salute
her.</p>

<p>We frequented the Thames Valley, and I shall never go there
again for fear of finding the soft morning mists over the brown
mirror of the water, the deep shadows of the trees, the tall
attendance of the still poplars, and the brightness of the little
inns all disenchanted. There is a small, squat hotel under the
shadow of Corfe Castle. Is its sunlit garden of flowers among the
grey stones the loveliest in the world? I remember that it was. I
will never risk a disillusionment. I will never drive my car again
through old Warham's streets and along that white causeway beyond
the prehistoric earthworks and so to the Swanage Road. That was the
way to Corfe and to a walk over the grassy hills above, commanding
vast distances of marsh and woodland and inlet, that touched the
heavens of loveliness. Thrice we went there. There is a great park
near Tunbridge Wells and an inn with some quaint armorial
decorations of gates and chains; is it the Marquis of Abergavenny?
I think it is the Marquis of Abergavenny. That also is an enchanted
pavilion. A tall, broad-browed, smiling woman will haunt that place
for me to the end of time.</p>

<p>I remember, too, an inn that cannot really exist, but I remember
it as out beyond Staines and Egham&mdash;the inn at Virginia Water.
One goes southward along a broad tarred road, bearing red omnibuses
and char-à-bancs and tradesmen's vans and tooting motor-cars and
motor-bicycles and bicycles, a dusty din of traffic hurrying to no
end of places. That stream flows on into the twilight and
presently, with an outbreak of headlamps, far into the night. It is
as modern and prosaic an improved and enlarged motoring road as can
be. One comes upon this inn I write of at a dip in the road; comely
enough it is and busy all the day with excursionists and trippers,
but apt to become empty and quiet after sundown. At night the
passing headlights flare upon its face, and its face is very
still.</p>

<p>One descends to be welcomed by an easy, accustomed waiter. It
seems no different from a score of such good wayside inns. You do
not see at first what it and the tall trees about it are hiding.
But there is a great winding artificial lake there, a queer freak
of George the Fourth's. It stretches away with wooded islands and a
further shore of woods for six or seven miles into the Windsor
Great Park. This is the Virginia Water. It is not without some
daylight vulgarities. There is a cascade of the utmost
artificiality close by the inn, and further away some sham
quasi-classical ruins, made of polished pillars and marble capitals
that were stolen from Greece in the great days of Lord Elgin and
intercepted royally on the way to the British Museum. These are
unimportant accidents. By day the trippers swarm about them and
gape and go away, and more trippers come. In the evening all that
is changed. The black knots of trippers vanish before the gloaming.
Sounds of the road become quite remote and negligible. The stolen
ruins are wrapped up in a deep blue veil and disappear. Perhaps
they are carried away. Perhaps they go back to haunt their proper
place in Greece. Imperceptibly beauty prevails and is presently
discovered enthroned. The still water reflecting the slumbering
trees and a hemisphere of afterglow becomes a magic mere in a world
of infinite peace.</p>

<p>"Death will be like this," said Helen, standing white and
shadowy beside me. "With the high-road we have left&mdash;near and
yet&mdash;suddenly&mdash;quite away from us. Perhaps we shall come
to a place like this some day, my dear, and we shall scarcely
realise we are dead."</p>

<p>"The high-road matters no longer," I said, and believed it as I
said it.</p>

<p>I had a new and interesting car in the garage behind us, and
some faint memory of its presence may have passed by me and faded
into the shading tranquillity about us.</p>

<p>Our hands touched.</p>

<p>"We have done with the high-road to-night," I said. "I wish we
had done with it for ever."</p>

<p>How vividly I remember that quiet moment side by side, and how
passionately I longed later to recall its quality! And yet it was
as unreal as a picture painted on glass. It was a picture we had
found to buy and hang up and presently forgot. It was the loveliest
shamming.</p>

<p>We stood in silence.</p>

<p>"What a scene this would make!" said Helen in a voice that was
almost a sigh....</p>

<p>How vividly, too, do I still remember her shadowed face as she
watched the reflections from the wavelets dance upon the brickwork
of a bridge across the Thames.</p>

<p>She had discovered that there was a definite pattern at play in
them.</p>

<p>"Like thoughts&mdash;with a sort of order, a sort of logic," she
said, and it seemed the wisest thing I had ever heard said.</p>

<p>How was it that at times she could say such things? She did say
them.</p>

<p>I thrust an oar into the reasoning liquid and turned its
argument to quivering ecstasy. The reflection danced upon her face.
And I, too, was all a-quiver with love for her....</p>

<p>But such memories as these will mean little to the reader. It is
only for me that they are charged with beauty. They have the
intense, irrational significance of some of my childish memories.
There were moments, many such moments, with Helen that seemed to be
worth all the rest of life put together. Inexplicably and
incommunicably.</p>

<p>And we quarrelled and parted. We quarrelled and parted because
neither of us, when we were put to the test, would consent to
regard these moments as worth any interference with our work and
the things we wanted to do. We did not really apprehend them as
real. We could feel together, but we could make no sacrifices for
our feelings. Ours was an intensely sympathetic and an intensely
selfish fellowship. We were exacting with each other and
grudging.</p>

<p>I confess I had little respect for her work, and she regarded
mine as coldly. What was this making that I found worth while? What
was this business of producing strange and untried materials from
which ten thousand beautiful devices and creations could be wrung?
She could not and would not understand. She thought one did such
things to make money. And then when one had made money one sought
the proud and magnificent Queen who satisfied pride and dispensed
hap pines. Her imagination lived in a world of brave men and
beautiful women, and would have no other.</p>

<p>I could as little understand her ambitions. The eXploitation of
a personality in public was a thing incomprehensible to me. She, on
the other hand, was the conscious priestess of her oWn divine
qualities, her grace and dignity, her wonderful voice, her power to
evoke the lurking emotions of her audience. She could not see what
better role there was for me than to be her champion and supporter
in this lovely self-absorption.</p>

<p>I put our antagonism plainly here, but it was not apparent in
our earlier relations. It came into them by little degrees, and
surprised and amazed us as we discovered it. At first we were
greatly in love with each other in the sense that we felt an
extreme need for each other. It was from my side that the first
revelation of dissevering motives came. But when I had been with
her a little time, and when I was fully assured of her, then aglow
with happiness and fit and energetic, I would hear the call of my
business operations and of my political interests as a call to
self-completion. All the other women I had ever had to deal with
since I became an actively prosperous man had accepted these
inattentions and disappearances as things in the course of nature.
I had been used to go away to my real life. But my going away,
becoming customary, must have impressed Helen as the supreme
outrage. Because, you see, it was not that I went away to see to
tiresome, necessary things; that might have been forgiven. But I
went away to things because they were more important to me. She was
incidental and they were essential! It was incredible.</p>

<p>Could anything be more important in life than the service of
personality and the mood of love?</p>

<p>I knew I was costing her tears, but I could not suspect how much
I hurt and stung her. She was not jealous; she was too
magnificently sure of herself to be jealous; but she was superbly
angry. I threw her back, amazed and wounded, upon her own proper
work. She had loved me, she had made me her lover, and I was only
half a lover. She had sailed into life very bravely and
confidently, and a perfect lover had seemed one of her elementary
rights. I had failed to be the perfect lover.</p>

<p>I am telling all this with the utmost simplification, but to
tell it in any other way, to relate comings and goings, moods
hidden and betrayed, insensible changes of attitude, would mean an
inordinately long and complicated story. It would need the
intricate faithfulness of a Henry James. I doubt if I could retrace
my steps through that maze. At first I was stronger than Helen, and
I was overbearing with her and thoughtless and cruel. But she was
younger than I was and with greater powers of variation and
recuperation, and a time soon came when she was stronger than
I.</p>

<p>The life of any actress is a life of uncertainties. Now
everything falls away, the sense of frustration and failure is
overpowering, and the poor lady is beyond measure miserable. This
is the lover's moment, to console and sustain, to make life worth
living. Then, quite irrationally, things conspire to make the
actress queen of the world. She blazes into success, her
personality is illuminated and admired from every point of view,
she is talked about, sought after, she blossoms gloriously. The
lover must run in the shadow then, carrying the cloak, ready for
the moment when she will have to go out of the warmth and light
again into the chill.</p>

<p>I perceive that always it was impossible for me to have been a
worthy lover of Helen. In Paris&mdash;or, at any rate, upon the
Parisian stage&mdash;there is the sort of lover I ought to have
been. And there are such men&mdash;indubitably. But there was
something in me, whether it was innate or the result of my
upbringing I cannot tell, which declared that though I found Helen
almost intolerably lovely and necessary to me, I would be damned if
I waited about for her in the shadows with a cloak. And there was
something equally powerful in her which insisted that, although she
was intensely fond of me and fond of my company, she would not
bother her head for a moment about me while she was actively
warming her hands at the great blaze of applause and adulation she
had lit. Meanwhile there were quite a lot of arms ready to hold the
cloak in the shadows, and many intimations of consolation for me
during these periods of neglect.</p>

<p>I had seen very little of the world of theatrical folk before my
relations with Helen took me into it. I found it saturated with an
excessive self-consciousness, with a craving for strong unsound
effects; its lack of intellectual conscience continually amazed me.
It was pervaded by sly and hovering young men and by habitually
self-explanatory women who made up their personalities as they made
up their faces. It never seemed sure whether it was smart or
Bohemian. It affected a sort of universal friendship and great
liberties of endearment. It sat about at unusual hours and gossiped
and talked about itself, endlessly, emptily. And collectively it
was up to nothing at all.</p>

<p>At first I could not believe it was up to nothing at all. For me
the theatre hitherto had been something to which one went
occasionally and contemptuously, preferably to see something
laughable. I was prepared to concede there was a serious drama,
outside my range of attention, but, I did not really believe in its
existence, I merely avoided dispute and inquiry. I liked and
admired Shakespeare, though I did not find anything fundamental in
him. I regarded&mdash;and I still regard&mdash;most of the popular
fuss about him exactly as I regard the popular fuss about the smile
of the Prince of Wales. I mean, there is about the same amount of
original judgment in both these cases. The rest of the Elizabethans
I thought to be highly artificial or rather drunken or delirious
stuff. I liked a good many English and French comedies from
Congreve and Gay down to Barrie and Noel Coward. I lumped
Ibsen&mdash;except for <i>Peer Gynt</i>&mdash;with Pinero and Jones
and all the other "serious" dramatic shams of the Victorian time. I
knew that such people as Granville Barker read lectures about a</p>

<p>National Theatre and produced intricate and industrious plays to
substantiate their talk; but that mattered as little to me as the
Turf. Shaw alone I read with interest, a perverse but entertaining
Manichean, an elusive wit, who took refuge from solid, sober
expression on the platform or behind the glare of the footlights,
and then repented and came back in a preface to say plainly all he
had not said plainly&mdash;a preface that itself became forthwith
as tricky as a platform speech. But always in the clearest, easiest
English prose that was itself a delight to me.</p>

<p>Now with the advent of Helen I did my best to modify these views
and believe that behind the "Drama" was some reality that could be
correlated with my general vision of life, just as I assumed that
within her was something fine and immortal that also could be
correlated with that general vision. I tried to impose a grave
attentiveness to things theatrical upon my unformulated
sub-conscious conviction that a show is a show and the stage of the
very slightest importance in serious human activities. I went about
as far as possible with the air of a man who regards the Theatre as
a great human institution.</p>

<p>I became more and more like a playwright soliciting the great
actress with an inappropriate and unattractive play. My play, which
I had been working out all my life, was the drama of our whole
universe, the soul of man growing conscious and wilful out of
nothingness under the silent stars. I wanted Helen, with her grave
beauty, her air of tender wisdom, to be a heroine in that eternal
play. But Helen had no suspicion of the existence of that drama,
could apprehend no hint of it. Her idea of a play was one with a
sustained series of emotional states and a crowning situation that
would do justice to her fine voice, her lifted face, and the
inimitable gestures of her arms and hands.</p>

<p>Absurd that two people so incompatible should have clung
together, with conflicts and quarrels and partings and reunions,
for nearly six years! My own obsession I can understand, but I have
no inkling of hers. Perhaps she realised her peculiar hold upon me,
and knew that such a power might never be given her again over any
other man.</p>

<p>My love for her and my jealousy of her deepened together. I was
jealous of her, not on account of any rival, but on account of the
world of display that was taking her away from me. From
indifference I passed to an irritated detestation of most of the
people who gathered about her, the serviceable young men, assiduous
dear Bobby This or dear Freddy That, who were always free to fetch
and carry for dear Helen because they were doing nothing that
mattered, the over-familiar journalists who intimated by a sort of
cringing patronage how necessary they were to her publicity, the
little agent fellows entangling her in vexatious agreements, the
galaxy of women intimates who consumed dear Helen's time with
lunches and confidences, the large, <i>idle</i>, rich men exuding
vague suggestions of taking a theatre for her, the men of letters
about town who lifted her reputation to the higher levels of
culture, the hostesses with an air of helpfulness in their
stupendous exactions, the intrusive Americans coming frankly and
blankly to admire, loudly, interminably, unprofitably&mdash;a
lengthening, inexhaustible queue of them. I had to wade,
ankle-deep, knee-deep, and at last waist-deep in this swamp of
people to have any time with her at all. I performed incredible
gymnastics of civility.</p>

<p>Year by year and month by month I saw her subdued to the
likeness of this crowd, becoming more insolently assured of its
incense and attendance, less and less free for any privacy and
depth of living. If at first I had gone away from her overmuch,
she, as her successes grew, became more and more deeply embedded
against me. And yet we retained an obstinate attraction for each
other. I had long days of anger and frustration, and then an hour
or so together would silence every discord. By act and letter we
could slight each other unendurably, but we could not continue to
quarrel face to face. Her smile enchanted me, and she had a habit
of affection for me.</p>

<p>Yet we had some sharp encounters.</p>

<p>"Damn that telephone!" said I, in her flat.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;<i>you</i> want a slave in a harem...."</p>

<p>"You ought to make your private secretary your mistress," she
said, coming back from her conversation. "Then she'd be always at
your disposal."</p>

<p>"You will end by marrying your impresario."</p>

<p>"Well, I may have to. If I can't manage him without it."</p>

<p>Anger.</p>

<p>"He'd know his place. He wouldn't make me cry. Why do I stand
you? Why on earth do I stand you? Why do I let you bully me? Nobody
has ever made me cry but you."</p>

<p>It was a ridiculous and pitiful situation. Our several careers,
our several conceptions of what was good in life, a deep obstinacy
in both of us, tore us apart inexorably, and yet we had a primitive
and essential affection for each other. For the reader this can be
nothing but comedy, but that does not alter the fact that these
things wrenched me abominably and hurt her very greatly. We were
not only hurt but perplexed by ourselves. That quarrel in her flat
recalls another preposterous occasion. We had gone to an inn near
Petworth for two or three days, and she brought down a new play by
Lawrence Lath with her, an utterly empty play, twenty thousand
words of smartness, called <i>The Golden Woman</i>. She was
learning her part; she was full of little ridiculous problems; how
to treat this foolish line and what action was best to bring out
the flavour of that. Consultation was imposed upon me. An exegesis
of Lawrence Lath!</p>

<p>"I can't stand this rubbish," I protested. "It is cheap,
knowing, vulgar&mdash;Rue de Rivoli. Why have you got yourself
mixed up with it?"</p>

<p>"How can I learn my part when you talk like that?" "Why are you
in the position of having to learn such a part? "</p>

<p>"It's a part. My dear, what does it matter? I shall come right
through it."</p>

<p>"And what do you come to when you come right through? "</p>

<p>"Is this to begin all over again?"...</p>

<p>"And meanwhile have I no existence? Is there nothing in me, no
obligation to call me away from this&mdash;this vacant
pleasantness?"</p>

<p>Helen became an indignant queen and the manuscript part of
<i>The Golden Woman</i> a sceptre. "Go back to your
money-grubbing!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I'll go!"</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>A sudden appeal to high heaven for justice against me. "And I
have to be ready with this for rehearsal to-morrow afternoon! How
can I <i>think</i>? How can I do any decent work?"</p>

<p>We broke off with each other and repented and came back together
again with tears and tenderness. We renewed our conflicts. There
loomed up a tour in South Africa for her, a tour which might extend
to the United States and become indeed a conquest of the
Anglo-Saxon globe. She would cease to be an ordinary human being;
she would become as universally visible as some celestial body. I
protested selfishly and savagely at this vast separation.</p>

<p>"Your wife is dead now," she said suddenly. "You could marry
me."</p>

<p>"What difference would that make?"</p>

<p>"We could go about quite openly. We could travel together."</p>

<p>"You mean you would give up the stage?"</p>

<p>She appealed: "What would be left of me if I did?" "You mean I
am to marry myself to the theatrical profession and follow you
about?"</p>

<p>"You put everything in such ugly fashion. I am asking you to
marry me...."</p>

<p>She became obsessed by the idea that I must marry her, and then
everything would be different."</p>

<p>It was only too plain to me that nothing would be different. We
parted again with some heat and bitterness and had a second
inconclusive reconciliation. I had never before begged for mercy
from a woman, but I confess I did from her. What did I beg of her?
That she would be in some profound and fundamental way different,
that she should not be herself in fact, in order that I should be
myself. What did I really want of her?</p>

<p>There were times when I behaved like a thwarted child. She had
become a habit of mind with me. I beat myself against her. I
stopped thinking about things in general. I neglected business. She
had got my imagination so entangled with her that for a while it
would not serve me for any end of my own. I came near to a complete
surrender and to giving her a marriage that would have done nothing
at all for either of us. And then, filled with wrath, not so much
with her as with myself, I set myself, sullenly and steadily, to
break those humiliating and intolerable bonds.</p>

<p>I told her that now at last we had come to the end of our
relationship.</p>

<p>We parted in a phase of grim anger&mdash;and she started out
upon the subjugation of South Africa.</p>

<p>How completely had this hard, ambitious young woman changed from
the dark, tall girl I had loved! And how swiftly so soon as she
departed did she become again the dark, tall girl I had found so
splendidly lovable! How I longed to hear her voice once more and
see her again with my eyes! Directly she had gone I was asking
myself why I had let her go. I forgot that for three years she had
been going away from me far more than I had been going away from
her, and it seemed to me simply that I had let her go. The love
alone was remembered; the quarrels all forgotten. Why had I let her
go?</p>

<p>And at the same time, cold and clear in me, disregardful of my
general tumult and dominant over all, was my decision that we had
to part.</p>

<h2><a id="b4-13" name="b4-13"></a>§ 13. REVOLT AGAINST LOVE</h2>

<p class="first">I WAS left in England with my nerves, my personal
pride, and my imagination jangling unendurably. Gusts and eddies of
unreasonable anger whirled about in a vast loneliness of spirit. I
did my utmost to pull myself together, and for a time I could not
do so.</p>

<p>This phase of distress is still very present in my memory. It
seems the worst phase I have ever been through, and perhaps it was
the worst phase. The perennial conflict in my nature between
sensuous eroticism and creative passion had come to its ultimate
crisis. I had made my last attempt to reconcile them, and it had
failed. I had decided for creation and broken my servitude to this
romantic love, but at a price. My will went about now with a white
face and no power to do anything further.</p>

<p>The universe said to me in effect: "You are founded on sex. All
you call life is founded on sex. You have been given the woman who
is the loveliest woman in the world so far as you are concerned,
and you have refused to give your Ii f e in return. Very well, you
suffer . You have some gimcrack idea of getting the best of me, me
who made you yesterday, me who need not trouble to destroy you
because of your own self you die to-morrow. Success is yours and
the beauty of that woman might still be yours.</p>

<p>And yet you cannot be content until this gimcrack idea of
service rules it all. You have a sense of obligation!</p>

<p>What sense of obligation? To whom? You insult my gifts. Victory
and possessions, women and spending-power are all the gifts there
are for men, and all these have come to you. Not good enough for
you! Then somewhere beyond sex and hunger you must find the thing
you need. I cannot give it you. Go your way, but I doubt you will
end your life on a pillar like St. Simon Stylites, cut off from
earth and not much nearer heaven!"</p>

<p>For a while it seemed to me that I had at last brought my life,
outwardly so successful, to a revealed defeat. My will was crippled
by the strength of this desire for Helen that I had still in me; it
had exhausted itself in the effort to break free from her, and I
was left incapable of any vigorous initiative, neurasthenic and
suffering.</p>

<p>I thought of making a tour of the world to get away from the
thought of her, but I knew that flight would accomplish nothing
real. It would mean at best the stupefaction of fatigue. The other
end of the world had no secrets and no releases for me that were
not also in London and Paris. Excitements were mere temporary
refuges; I might as well take to drink or drugs. Flight was not to
be thought of, therefore; I had to sit down in front of this
desolation and dig myself in and fight and beat it. I had to set my
scattered thoughts in order and arrange my work for the last years
of my life.</p>

<p>I had become so used to the delight of Helen's company, her
voice, her careless close affectionateness, that all the world
seemed haunted by her. For five years I had never been outside the
beaten track of business except to go with her. I had been moved
neither to happiness nor anger except through her. I had referred
my pride to her; she had been my sufficient satisfaction. In
England I was quite unable to escape from my memories. I went
abroad. I wanted something which might excite and revivify my
imagination. I thought I would go to the meeting of the Assembly of
the League of Nations in Geneva and interest myself in such hopes
of world peace as that gathering could afford. I flew thither on a
private plane from London through a great storm of wind and rain
that fell from us like a cloak as we crossed the Jura; and that at
least was entertaining.</p>

<p>It was the year when that queer, vain simulacrum of a statesman,
Ramsay MacDonald, was posturing with poor Herriot as his rather
abashed protagonist. MacDonald played to an imaginary audience, a
Victorian audience that had been dead five-and-twenty years.
Herriot and he, he intimated, were two great, noble and righteous
men in an otherwise wicked and foolish world. He made dramatic
scenes with Herriot, holding out his arms to him from the rostrum
and almost embracing him. Mighty things were to be done against
"the powers of darkness." Beyond that he was vague. His second in
command, Lord Parmoor, amazed the gathering by a display of simple
evangelical piety unusual in European statesmen. I sat with cramped
knees in the stuffy gallery of the Assembly and listened to the
slow unfolding of these discussions that discussed nothing, in
which there were no exchanges, in which every prepared and
inconsecutive speech was duplicated by an interpreter's rendering.
I listened. I laughed bitterly at some of the phrases my
representatives used. I could not even be indignant. These
political men seemed now all flibber- gibbers and phantoms, who
could do nothing but recall the forms and gestures of a life that
has passed out of reality. What substance, what nearness was there
in all this stuff compared with the substance and nearness of a
remembered face?</p>

<p>I went about Geneva in a state ripe for disillusionment, and I
was abundantly disillusioned. The gathering was enormously polyglot
and various, and there was a tremendous lot of lunching, dining,
meeting and talking, plotting and intrigue going on beside and
beyond the formalities of the Assembly. It was too crowded for me
altogether. There were deputations of all kinds of odd people
seeking all sorts of queer ends. I remember a charming Red Indian
from Canada with a wonderful belt of wampum; it was a treaty all
done in beads; by it the British Government gave sovereign dominion
for ever and ever to the remnants of the Five Nations over a long
strip of country running right through Canadian territories,
territories in which prohibition and all sorts of bizarre modern
practices now prevail. The Canadians were infringing the freedoms
of that ribbon of liberty by sending in excise-men and the like. So
the Five Nations, with a grave copper face, wampum treaty very
carefully wrapped in tissue paper, were appealing from the British
Empire to mankind.</p>

<p>Another figure that stands out in these recent memories of
Geneva is Dr. Nansen, tall, white-headed, with the big black slouch
hat of an artist. I do not know him, but I saw him about
everywhere. He was tremendously set, I was told, upon the inclusion
of the Germans in the League of Nations. They refused to come in
prettily, and he was spending considerable sums in cables of
exhortation to Berlin. There was also a little group of German
socialists, sadly, endlessly explanatory of the obduracy of their
Government. There was a score or so of shock-headed, bright-eyed
boys and girls from some Maori school in New Zealand; they all wore
hat ribbons of red, white and blue, and what they were doing in
Geneva I cannot imagine. They exercised Swiss curiosity
considerably but not sufficiently. I was told by my hotel porter
that they were Siamese, and by a policeman that they came from
Madagascar, while a cabman said Mexicans without hesitation. After
a day or so I never set eyes on any of these Maoris without at once
seeking a new point of view from the nearest Swiss, and I never
failed to get one. It was the most cheerful item in my Geneva
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>There were unofficial as well as official Chinese about. There
were Druses with grievances against the French, and Turks and Kurds
with grave charges against the British. There was a strong
contingent of representatives from the various societies, unions
and so forth formed to sustain the League by propaganda. They were
there, I suppose, to administer first-aid if it showed any signs of
distress. And there was a vast concourse of Americans. One was
always coming upon them having large luncheons and dinners and
meetings or going for excursions on the lake, in the interests of
this League their country had put upon us Europeans and then
declined to support. I met scores of them. Brilliant rich girls in
enormous automobiles; small, grey, rich men with great retinues of
stenographers and secretaries. They were prepared to champion the
League of Nations against all comers. They took enthusiasm in
enormous volume into the Assembly galleries, ready to endorse
whatever happened. A little gentleman named Filene&mdash;they told
me he was the Selfridge of Boston&mdash;had been offering some huge
number of dollars for a solution of the problem of peace, and a
considerable proportion of the less attractive American men
appeared to be candidates for this reward and would at the
slightest provocation draw duplicated manuscripts from their hip
pockets upon totally inoffensive strangers.</p>

<p>It was sunny and close and dusty in Geneva all the time; there
was no air that did not seem to have been breathed several times by
every nationality on earth; to respire properly one took a
motor-boat out upon the lake or an automobile far up into the
mountains. My central memory in the scene is that long bridge which
spans the Rhône from the principal hotels to the Assembly.
Everybody seemed to be always going or coming over it. There anyone
could be waylaid. Heaven knows how many times I myself did not
tramp to and fro across it trying to get away from myself to
something that would hold my interest.</p>

<p>In any other state of mind I should have found much to watch and
think about in that astonishing gathering, but my mind was
heart-sick. The Labour Bureau of Albert Thomas was something
escaping from the initial foolishness of that polyglot sham
Parliament of Mankind, and men like Salter and Maderiaga, whom I
met, might have told me, had I been tuned to listen, of many less
conspicuous and more important activities that were arising in this
meeting-place, out of the mere fact that it was a meeting-place.
Some day soon I must go back to Geneva and look at it again from
the angle of these things. In a hotel lounge one afternoon I saw
Lamont, of J. P. Morgan and Co., and Lubbock, of the Bank of
England, sitting together with an air of having met by chance and
fallen talking about nothing in particular. Yet these two, while
Ramsay MacDonald and Parmoor waved arms and bombinated in the
Assembly, were doing things of fundamental importance to human
life. And I saw my friend Louchcur, who is now taking his
turn&mdash;a transitory turn, I fear&mdash;at saving the franc in
Paris, very busy eating in the Restaurant du Pare, and wondered for
a moment what schemes he might have brought with him and why he had
brought them.</p>

<p>But I could not induce my distracted mind to penetrate below the
most superficial aspects of Geneva at that time. Wherever I was I
fretted to be somewhere else, and there was no peace in me.
Everything irritated me. This is all, said I, that humanity can
muster to make a world order. This is, perhaps, as near as it may
ever come to establishing a world state. Compared with the size of
the world and the immensity of the problems the League pretends to
face, this is a small city and a small multitude of debaters and
workers, and yet nine-tenths even of those who are here are
trivial, frivolous, dishonest or absurd!</p>

<p>And then in this phase of discontent Helen suddenly came back
bodily and took possession of Geneva.</p>

<p>Of course she was away in South Africa, but it chanced there was
a woman about in the town sufficiently like her to play the part of
her double. I was lunching with Edwin Mansard at a restaurant on
the lake when I became aware of this woman sitting with a man at a
table a little way off; she was talking to him, and as she talked
her very pretty hand, exactly like Helen's hand, was playing with
her roll and the things upon the table exactly as Helen waS wont to
do. My imagination was so out of control that I could hardly keep
my talk with Mansard going for watching her.</p>

<p>My intelligence, my eyes, told me that it was impossible that
this could be Helen; nevertheless, the resemblance released a storm
of pent-up longing.</p>

<p>"I'm not boring you with all this?" said Mansard, pulling up in
the account he was giving me of the International Labour Bureau. I
suppose I had answered him vaguely.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," I said. "Not in the least. Go on, my dear
fellow." But I spoke with my eyes still on this double of
Helen's.</p>

<p>Then with a wrench I turned myself to Mansard's of fended face.
"You were saying?" said I.</p>

<p>Presently the couple got up to go. She held herself like Helen.
She walked like Helen.</p>

<p>With a renewed effort I returned to Mansard.</p>

<p>Afterwards I saw her, high up above me on the balcony of some
hotel looking on to the lake. She was wearing a blue dress of a
shade that became Helen extremely. Helen had just such another
dress, and would lean on a balcony rail and look at a sunset in
just that fashion. I stood gaping. I was filled with the fantastic
idea of seeking out this woman and getting into talk with her. But
this was madness. I pulled myself together, packed up, and fled to
Paris.</p>

<p>As I pitched about in the <i>wagon-lit</i> through a sleepless
night I argued with myself. In some way I must get back my control
over my mind and drive my thoughts away from this obsession. I was
persuaded that the best thing to exorcise one woman from one's mind
is to invoke another, but so far I had not been able to get up
sufficient interest in another woman to make love that was in the
least degree convincing either to myself or to her.</p>

<p>I found myself envying the good Catholics for whom there were
cloisters and retreats, cool, quiet places in which one could
escape from galling suggestions and inflammatory reminders, and
settle one's business with one's soul, deliberately and
definitively. A time may come when we who have parted from the old
religions long ago shall also have our retreats.</p>

<p>As the train tossed about, tearing along too fast on the bad
French permanent way, with a clumping rhythm of the wheels and
strange roarings and echoings as we passed over bridges or through
tunnels and cuttings, I found myself wishing there could come a
conclusive smash, a wild clatter, blows and crushing impacts, fire
perhaps, and one last ecstasy of pain that would take me out of all
my perplexities. I have a strong conscience against suicide, but
latterly I had been flying a good deal and with a preference for a
defective engine in an overworked service in bad weather, and I now
realised how this smothered desire for a release was at work in me.
It was impatience. It was cowardice and indolence. I knew in my
heart of hearts that I was not beaten, that at last I should come
out of these distresses of desire and be my own master again and
serene; nevertheless, they did so weigh upon me that the chance of
death had become a temptation.</p>

<p>I talked aloud to myself in the swaying, jangling, creaking
compartment. "Now what are you going to do with yourself?" I said.
"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p><i>Whump, bump</i> went the train over some points; one was
tossed up and jolted sideways, a receding diminuendo of bumps.</p>

<p>There was a beastly contrivance in the compartment so that you
could not turn out the light completely. When I turned off the full
light a nasty little mauve lamp came on and threw a ghastly pallid
illumination on racks and curtains and the greasy shining
panelling, and there was no way of extinguishing this.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do? Since there are no monasteries for
you, you must go into retreat by yourself. Be a hermit. There were
hermits before monasteries....</p>

<p>"What you have to do is to get it plain&mdash;write it down....
Get it plain. Write it down. Get it plain. Write it down."</p>

<p>I argued the thing out with that accursed railway playing
cup-and-ball with me and shaking the teeth in my jaws, roaring and
chanting my thoughts into rhythms.</p>

<p>What was wrong with Geneva? What was the good of turning my back
on that attempt unless I had something better in mind? It missed
its object, but what was the object it had missed? It didn't deal
with realities. Very well, think how men were to deal with
realities. That wasn't clear. Then get it clear. No one had got it
clear. Then some one had to begin.</p>

<p>If only the train would run smoothly for a moment I felt I
should have everything right.</p>

<p>The vile uproar of this train was only an intensification of
life. One never had time to assemble one's ideas.</p>

<p>Never. One was always being hurried on, always being forced to
think in rhythms and refrains because of the beating oscillations
of the vehicle. Through it all quivered that idea of a retreat, a
hermitage. It must not be a place with a lot of other people. It
must be a little house alone. My mind insisted, for some obscure
reason, on a little white house, very low and long. It was to stand
in sunshine and air. Plenty of air&mdash;not like Geneva. And
isolated. Far away from people with arguments and irrelevant
grievances, wampum treaties and telegrams to Germany; and, above
all, far away from anyone who looked like Helen. There I could live
very simply for a time. I might look after myself and walk to an
inn for a meal.</p>

<p>And there I could have a table&mdash;I saw the table, too, very
stout and plain&mdash;and at it I could jot down all the heads of
my difficulties, and balance this against that and <i>think</i>.
There would be no hurry; day would stretch beyond day. Then I could
decide what I meant to do with this universe, which hitherto, it
seemed to me, had done what it liked with me.</p>

<p>And there must be no more women in it&mdash;no more women.</p>

<p>The engine, as if I had amused it, set up a whooping, derisive
scream, blundered clumsily over points, and rushed through a
station, and a flicker, flicker, flicker of lights in fives and
fives glared and swept and vanished one after another, athwart the
walls of the compartment.</p>

<p>I felt that I should never sleep again and that for all the rest
of my life my head would ache. My throat was dry, I was excessively
thirsty, and my mouth had the evil taste of sulphurous coal
fumes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it had suddenly come into my mind that I was
fighting my last battle with my universe and that I was going to
win. Perhaps the metallic uproar of the train had suggested the
metallic uproar of a battlefield and stirred some slumbering
imagined wilfulness the wartime had left in me. I became militant.
I swayed and vibrated through that noisy night, but now, within an
infinitude of vain repetitions, I was making definite plans.</p>

<p>Where was I? There were to be no more women at all&mdash;no more
women. That was it. I was losing all purpose in my life because I
had never faced and fought my essential weakness. I must do without
women. Henceforth I must do without women. Henceforth I must do
without women. Henceforth I must do without women. That is what I
ought to have decided in Edenbridge Square a third of a century
ago.</p>

<p>I talked aloud against the loud mockery of the train. "This is
the end of women. Overdue that! Long overdue! I have wasted time
and strength and influence upon them. I deserted science. I
deserted science."</p>

<p>My mind held to that. Clara became mysteriously identified with
Helen, and Helen with Clara. They were my enemies, my wasters,
Alpha and Omega, the chiefs of a great array of adverse women.</p>

<p>"But what are women for?"</p>

<p>I thought for an interval and then raved.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Leave them alone, my boy. Get on with your job,
damn you. Get on. Do it, as you <i>can</i> do it, alone. Tackle
these half-condensed ideas and get them clear. Think it out. Work
it out. What else is there to do? What else is there to do?"</p>

<p>The train accompaniment changed into a genial, obstinate,
confidential "Get on with your work, <i>alone</i>. Get on with your
work, <i>alone</i>." And then burst into a clatter that was like
the laughter of a giant gear-box in hysterics.</p>

<p>"The little white house, anyhow," said I. "And if the worst
comes to the worst and the old craving must be drowned
again&mdash;the brothel in the valley."</p>

<p>For a while I held myself still and stared that mauve light in
the eye. Hell will be lit by such little, insufficient,
unquenchable lamps. I do not know if hell is hot or cold, or what
sort of place hell may be, but this I surely know, that if there is
any hell at all it will be badly lit. And it will taste like a
train.</p>

<p>I must have slept. I found myself standing up in the swaying
compartment, raising the blinds. Trees and fields were visible,
hurrying past me. The dawn had come, the sky was flushed and clear.
There were exquisite bands of cloud, band beyond band, like
luminous rose-coloured knife-blades.</p>

<p>Nothing lasts for ever, I reflected. Presently I would breathe
fresh air in Paris, I would hold my head under cold water for a
bit, and then for a bath and that cottage, and we would see.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b4-14" name="b4-14"></a>§ 14. RECULER POUR MIEUX
SAUTER</h2>

<p class="first">I PUT up in some rooms I had had before at the top
of the Hotel Meurice and looking on the gardens, and I recall it as
a quite extraordinary thing that this fancy of a little white house
high up in the hills, where the ordinary passions of life are
allayed or forgotten, so comforted me that for a day or so I was
almost at peace. And then I began to be troubled by the problem of
where I was to find this house and how I was to obtain possession
of it. And in the lounge I turned over a back number of the
<i>Bystander</i> and came upon a portrait of Helen that I had not
seen before, and that also ruffled me. It was not Helen as I loved
her, but it was Helen looking very magnificent and successful and
triumphant, Helen more of a banner and a challenge than ever.</p>

<p>It is queer what limitations there are to everyone's ability.
People call me a fairly competent man; I have planned great works
and carried through great business operations, but I found myself
now quite incapable of discovering any such house as this I dreamt
of. I have not that delicacy of touch. I could not imagine how to
set about looking for it; I did not know even whether I should look
for it in Italy or Greece or Austria or France, and I felt I could
neither secure it nor furnish it and organise its service if I
found it. I saw all this as an impossibly complex and laborious
task. Largely this was due to my neurasthenia, which deprived me
for a time of any power of effort, but it was also due in part to
the fact that I had never done any of these things; always before I
had got some one to do them for me. I thought vaguely of sending
over and borrowing old Deland from Dickon.</p>

<p>I stayed two or three days at the Meurice doing absolutely
nothing, and then came a warm, serene and illuminated day, a
quintessentially October day that would have lifted the heaviest
heart a little, and in the afternoon, as the sun was setting, I
turned out for a walk, and I crossed the Place de la Concorde and
set my face towards the Arc de Triomphe.</p>

<p>Far away the outline of the great bluish arch stood up without a
feature visible against a sky of intense pale gold. The upper lines
of the remote, tall houses on either side of it were faint yet
clear, the nearer trees very bright and hard and black against
their softness. A few lights were appearing in the distant shops
and windows; some of the hurrying traffic in the roadway had
already lit its lamps. Nearer to me was the space and dignity of
the gardens that set back the exhibition palaces from the broad
main avenue. What a gracious and splendid vista is that of the
Champs Elysees, the finest, I think, in the world! Even the late
afternoon loungers seemed tall and dignified as they strolled
past.</p>

<p>For a time I was filled with the golden beauty of the scene, and
then the faint sadness that lies so close to all purely aesthetic
pleasure took possession of me. I reflected again that I was
solitary and now not very far from being old, and that I had made
myself solitary all to no purpose, with such a waste of will-power
that I seemed unable to do anything now to justify my revolt
against Helen. I had worked all my days to make myself one of the
leading slaves of a great industrial machine that was as will-less
as myself. And that was all I had been able to make of life.</p>

<p>It is a habit with me, and I suppose it is with most men, to
note the women I pass. It is an almost unconscious habit of
observation. Only now and then one notes what one's mind is taking
in about them. Then one not only notes but notices. My life has had
little occasion for casual encounters, but in some parts of Paris
and London at certain hours one is aware that one is walking
through gossamer filaments of adventurous invitation, faint elusive
provocations, delicate strokes of not too critical approval. These
gossamer threads become more perceptible the blanker one's
thoughts. "Turn your back on your problems," they insinuate. "And
if the problems return to-morrow you may find something else to
amuse you."</p>

<p>So in the Champs Elysees I became interested in a graceful woman
with a slender neck and a wisp of hair that was darkly ruddy
against the light, who was going in the same direction as myself.
She was promenading so nearly at my pace that only presently by
quickening my steps did I overtake her. She walked easily. But
there was that indefinable quality in her gait, a faint
aimlessness, I think it must be, and something a little careless in
her smart-spirited costume, that told me she was one of those who
wait upon the accident of an encounter. She had not put on her
clothes for herself or for anyone in particular. When she was still
far off I saw her twice turn towards men with the unmistakable
forced invitation of her kind and turn away. Then she ceased to
heed the passers-by.</p>

<p>Her brows and cheek and chin I discovered as I came nearer to
her were prettily drawn. A vague curiosity, the absurd and
instinctive curiosity of the wandering male, brought me up
alongside of her to see her profile.</p>

<p>So it was I first discovered Clem's abstracted countenance,
elfin and pensive, infantile and sage. The uniform amber light
revealed her professionally undisguised make-up and robbed it of
personal significance. Those dabs of paint and powder were nothing
essentially hers; it was as if her face had been ill-treated by
some alien thing. Beneath these addenda she was perceptibly pale.
She was looking at the great arch and the shining sky, forgetful
for a moment of the hungry business that had brought her out,
oblivious of the awakening interest of the quite possible Monsieur
who was walking beside her.</p>

<p>I do not see why one should intrude upon a woman because,
roughly speaking, it is her calling to be intruded upon. She paid
no heed to me. I walked past her and went on before her. But her
quality remained in my mind.</p>

<p>Old Nature&mdash;i sometimes suspect the old harridan of a
visible body and a mocking mind&mdash;must have been cheered by
this new interest of her rebel son's. He had with immense exertion
cast himself off from Woman, and here he was back at the old
lure.</p>

<p>Clementina had seemed rapt in the beauty about us. That marched
with my mood. And there had been something sad and tired in her
abstracted face. That, too, appealed to me. And she was very
graceful. Here was an extraordinarily interesting young woman, I
said to myself.</p>

<p>"But hadn't I perhaps just imagined things?" said the Vieux
Marcheur in me.</p>

<p>So often I have imagined things. I did not want to stare round
at her. I dropped back to see if I should still find her off her
guard.</p>

<p>She was, and then she woke up to my presence. Instantly her
expression changed and her face became a mask, defensive but
seductive. She was the woman of her class at the moment of
invasion. And her personality and privacy hustled away out of
sight. "Ware man!" What sort of loose, detached, occasional male
was it this time? Was he of the impossible kind instantly to be got
rid of? Or was he to be considered, attracted, dealt with? Two very
intelligent hazel eyes met mine, businesslike and scrutinising,
under long slanting brows.</p>

<p>I passed muster, I perceived, by such standards as she could
maintain. She decided to smile interrogatively, but her eyes
remained guarded.</p>

<p>I made up my immediate mind forthwith. For an hour or so I would
forget my ache.</p>

<p>"I am all alone in Paris this evening," I said. "Would you care
to dine with me?"</p>

<p>"This is very sudden," she answered in English, with a faInt
accent that for a moment I could not place.</p>

<p>"But will you?" I said, also in English.</p>

<p>"It is early for dinner yet."</p>

<p>"We could walk on to the Arc de Triomphe and then come
back."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said, with no pretence of pleasure. "There is a
comfortable restaurant at the Rond Point, the Franco-Italian. We
could dine there."</p>

<p>She aroused herself to appear interested.</p>

<p>"That would be charming," she said.</p>

<p>"I want only companionship," I said, and she looked at me to
read the significance of that. "Let me be pleasant to you for an
evening."</p>

<p>"As you will," said she, and braced herself, I fancied, for the
task of being pleased. Had she been free, I felt, that evening
would have been her own.</p>

<p>"You like walking?" she asked.</p>

<p>"And you? You walk too easily and gracefully not to like
it."</p>

<p>She smiled with a little less effort. "I could walk for
miles.... Often I prowl about Paris&mdash;for no purpose."</p>

<p>"It is the most amusing city to prowl about in the world."</p>

<p>"There is a cheerfulness. Until the winter comes."</p>

<p>"Even in the winter."</p>

<p>"Even in the winter. If one is warm."</p>

<p>"There is a hard, clear animation on the coldest days."</p>

<p>"When it does not rain. But sometimes in the winter there are
days when the gutters swill and the river is swollen and watery and
Paris is wet and disgusting. Now, at any time, such days may come.
And, anyhow, I feel the cold."</p>

<p>I had jumped into the encounter on a momentary impulse, and I
had no intention of inflicting myself upon her to any extent that
she might .find disagreeable. I was buying her company for an
evening; that was my conception of the affair. I had to treat her
like any other pretty lady I might happen to know except that I
must not press my attentions upon her as I might have done upon
anyone who was quite free of me. I had no compunction about being
seen about with her; that sort of thing has never troubled me. I
began to talk of Paris to her and praise the place, its gay
urbanity, its spacious grace, its light and freedoms, its brilliant
kindness to the stranger. I supposed she was a Parisienne, and that
this would flatter her.</p>

<p>But she made it appear that she was not a lover of Paris. "It is
crowded. It is full of noises. They talk of the roar of London; it
cannot be worse than this. London may roar; Paris&mdash;barks.
Everything thinks only of itself, and yet everything clamours for
attention. And nobody attends. They push against you. Everything
pushes against you. I am always just missing being killed by
taxi-autos and automobiles."</p>

<p>She spoke like one who was tired and at an ebb.</p>

<p>"But you were thinking Paris beautiful to-night."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Just now when I overtook you."</p>

<p>"No. The sunset made me long for the south. I was dreaming of
the warm sunshine down in Provence. Where I spent a
holiday&mdash;it seems ages ago."</p>

<p>I made her talk; I was surprised by my own interest in her. It
was good anyhow to stop thinking about myself and Helen, even for a
little while. In some way I didn't clearly understand at the time
this red-haired, pale young woman was also a disappointed and
perplexed person.</p>

<p>I have learnt more since. Nowadays I am almost a specialist upon
the subject of Clementina. She was the daughter of a Scotch
engineer who had worked upon tramways in Athens and Asia Minor, her
mother Was Greek, and she had had a chequered and polyglot
upbringing. She had grown up strongly patriotic both towards
Britain and Greece, and she had had the unusual advantage of two
sound religious trainings, Greek and Presbyterian. Her social
experiences were jagged and distorted by the gradual lapse of the
Scotch father from honourable employment into continuous but still
dignified drunkenness. In the absence of an income the family, I
have gathered, subsisted by the economies effected by the mother.
In the distressful years at the end of the war Clementina, who was
then one-and-twenty and fatherless, fell in love with an amorous,
romantic, carefully beautiful but quite orthodox French subaltern
in Athens, followed him to Paris, transferred all her patriotic
emotion to France, and all her waning but still considerable gift
of faith to the Roman Catholic Church. There was a menage in Paris
which went on rather happily until it was time for the orthodox
French subaltern to marry the featureless but entirely eligible
wife selected for him by his aristocratic family. The parting was
upon the correctest pattern. He wept very freely and frequently
over Clementina, he contemplated suicide from a safe distance and
found it inconsistent with Catholic principles, he declared he
would never love any woman but her, he promised always to seek her
advice and help in moments of difficulty, and he gave her a ring of
no great intrinsic value that had belonged to his mother and a
quite surprisingly small present of money. He declared that he
would not insist upon her subsequent chastity, and that he had
abandoned any right to do so, but the bare thought of his being
supplanted evoked passions of such splendour and violence in him,
such tearing of hair, such clenching and waving of virile fists,
that he broke two ornaments in her flat, pawnable ornaments that
under the circumstances she could ill spare, and departed to his
own aristocratic milieu in a mood of the utmost nobility before she
had time to estimate the dimensions of his parting present. The
Greek mother had already died and left her daughter a small,
untraceable, and possibly imaginary house in Smyrna. So equipped
Clementina had to face the world on her own account.</p>

<p>In quite a few years she had become a woman of considerable
experience, experience rather than wisdom. Scotch heredity and
Greek heredity do not mix; they make a sort of human Macedonia, a
melange of hostile and incompatible districts in the soul.
Clementina is in streaks beautifully logical and clear-headed, and
in streaks incoherently but all too expressively passionate; she is
acutely artistic and rigidly Philistine. Flung across this piebald
basis are the three great religious cultures of Christendom, not so
much following as traversing the racial boundaries. There are
chunks of intense Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Calvinistic feeling
in Clementina, pervaded latterly by a broad disillusionment and
scepticism.</p>

<p>Her social ideas are also of very confused origin, drawn on the
one side from the home life of a high-minded and influential Scotch
engineer, whose austere respectability increased rather than
diminished in his drunken phases, and from the excellent if
extremely snobbish English school in Athens to which he sent his
daughter, and on the other from the abundant voluble family of the
Greek mother, aunts, cousins, uncles, hangers-on, which infested
the sinking home, critically and voraciously, up to the very moment
when it went right under water and ceased to be a home at all. She
has the defensive disposition due to the mixed and uncertain social
status of her childhood; she is alert to detect and resent
imaginary slights and insults and to magnify negligencies into
cruelties.</p>

<p>Imposed upon her heterogeneous traditions are the impressions
and suggestions of two or three European literatures, for
Clementina is a swift responsive reader. And then just at a
susceptible age had come the dignified and dishonest conventions of
Catholic France, which has sanctioned and codified even the
fornication of its tenderly fostered but otherwise gallant young
men. One must know only the right people; one must behave with an
icy loftiness in the nastiest situations; one must keep one's wife
and one's mistress apart; the meaner the act the finer the gesture,
and so on. So constituted there was and alas! there still is a very
considerable amount of jangling in Clementina. Through it all, I
declare, runs a thread of gold, which I discovered at the outset
and select as the real Clementina. She is delightful in that phase
and for its sake I am prepared to accept or forgive all her other
phases.</p>

<p>I will not venture to guess what role in life Clementina was
originally best fitted to fill. She was certainly not fitted to
become, at the age of three-and-twenty, a brilliant adventuress
with no social position in Paris. There may have been something
meretricious in the Greek heredity, but whenever she was involved
in a love affair that was not an earnest business of body and soul,
the Scotch engineer arose staggering but resolute and damned it
root and branch. She had learnt to dance beautifully from the
charming young aristocrat; his name, by-the-by, was Rene, but she
always called him Dou-Dou; and she did her best to make something
more than a sexual liaison out of her affairs with a series of the
kind of men detached young women meet in dancing places. I am
carefully incurious about all this part of her life; it has nothing
to do with me; she was, I believe, given an establishment and put
among her furniture once or twice, and each time her Presbyterian
father or her Catholic puritanism or her fundamental veracity made
a shipwreck of the business. Her native pluck was very great, but
there must have been times when she looked at this amazing universe
with considerable dismay. Where was this sort of thing going to
end? And how long would it take before it ended?</p>

<p>There had been some great row just before I happened upon her.
Neither Clementina nor I have any disposition to gossip about it,
but I am inclined to believe that it was with a rich and agreeable
gentleman from the Argentine who had carried his confidence in his
personal charm and his general right to do what he liked with his
own so far that it had become suddenly necessary to smack his face,
throw the more suitable of his presents at him, say a selection of
unforgettable things, and depart from the flat he had taken. It was
a mess, and there was no going back on it.</p>

<p>Clementina had reverted to a single room in an obscure street
and to perplexity about herself and God's intentions. She
experienced a great longing for Provence. She had gone thither in
the Dou-Dou days. It had not been really smart enough for Dou-Dou,
but he had laughed and shown his beautiful teeth; it had been
inexpensive, at any rate, and they were able to descend once or
twice upon the Riviera coast, where he could display her quality to
his similarly provided friends. There had been mistress-parades no
doubt in Cannes and Monte Carlo, and everybody had shown off
tremendously. All that she had largely forgotten. But the warm and
gentle quality of friendliness in this land among the hills had
sunken deeply into her spirit.</p>

<p>The better I know Clementina, the better I understand how
hopelessly she was caught in a net from the very moment she was
conceived. She feels and understands beauty exquisitely; she has
the finest sense of intellectual and moral values, and a fire of
disorder burns within her that will not let her rest. And also she
has a passion for writing poetry in languages whose finer shades of
sound she misses or misconceives.</p>

<p>Now in a mood of extreme disillusionment with Paris and all that
Paris concentrated for her she was idealising this Provençal
countryside and longing to be back there. She was under the charm
of a dream of living in some extraordinarily cheap pension,
walking, brooding, possessing herself. Then she could think over
her life and its riddles; then she could make decisions. In Paris
one was hustled f rom day to day. Things happened to one; one did
nothing to determine them. She talked of this dream of getting away
as we sat at dinner together with an admirable frankness and
freshness of feeling. It fell in very aptly with my own desire to
get away.</p>

<p>She might have gone to Provence a month or so ago; she had had
money then, a few thousand francs, but she was <i>not</i> the sort
of person who could make simple, quick decisions. She had lingered
and her money had run out.</p>

<p>She talked easily and unaffectedly in her Scotch-English, a
little Frenchified, I helped out with French words and phrases.
There was nothing common in her voice or gesture or the quality of
her thought. Her thought was fine spun silk, and in that at least
there was very little mixture. She was open and wholesome in her
mind, very outspoken, but never indecent. She was instinctive
enough to know that I had a directness of mind to match her own.
She talked of the inevitableness of prostitution in some form for
women like herself. She had had no training of any sort, she
explained; she was not capable even of hard physical work. She fell
into no place. She had no race, no nation, no people, no class. She
was the sort of bird that other birds peck at. Her manners were
samples, and her social code a patchwork. She had tried
dactylography, but she could not spell; she was bored, and ceased
to attend to a task at once difficult for her and inane. She was
not steady and continuous enough for a workroom. She had been
rejected as a governess and as a companion. She was too
distinguished for the one and too disrespectful for the other.
Marriage of any sufferable sort was hopeless for her. The stage was
beyond her. She couldn't act. What else was there to do but trade
on her sex? She might be "rescued," but for what? Rescue in France
meant a sham penitence, a surrender to the subtle Catholicism that
had smiled on her relations with her first lover; it meant a
subjugation to narrow and authoritative nuns, scrubbing, meticulous
needlework, and being driven and sweated in those close, inevitable
economies that underlie all Latin benevolent institutions. She
would come out of that worse than she went in&mdash;and with her
pretty wardrobe scattered and her hands rough and spoilt.</p>

<p>"Nothing for it but the streetS of Paris."</p>

<p>"Thank your stars they are not the streets of London," said I.
"But aren't there girls in shops?"</p>

<p>"<i>Vendeuse</i>? I'd rather sell myself straightly and simply
than give myself in as a tip to my employers....</p>

<p>"There are too many women in the world," said Clementina.</p>

<p>"Too many pretty women," said I.</p>

<p>"I see no advertisements for the plain ones."</p>

<p>I reflected. "Tell me more about this Provence of yours. I am
interested. Are there little houses, little isolated white houses
that look in the face of the sun and are simple and quiet?"</p>

<p>"White?" said Clementina. "No. They paint their houses pink or
yellow. But there are many pleasant little houses among the grey
olives, rather <i>austere</i>, but always with a <i>terrasse</i> in
front of them with flowers and trees where the peasants dine and
sit. A Provençal <i>mas</i> can be very delightful in its plain
way."</p>

<p>"I want a little house," I said. "Let me tell you something
about myself. You are bored with Paris, but I am bored with the
whole world. I want to get away from it and think. I want a respite
for thinking. Every now and then&mdash;for I am still a very busy
man. I have thought of a little white house in the sun, very quiet
and simple. A little white house where I can think things out and
recover my will. But I do not know where to go to find it; France,
Spain, Italy, Greece?, I do not know where to turn for it."</p>

<p>"You might find it in Provence," she considered. "I remember a
little place where we had lunch one day, named Châteauneuf, the
most adorable of villages. Perhaps one could be quiet and happy
there."</p>

<p>I had had an idea germinating in my mind for some minutes. It
shot up suddenly now, complete.</p>

<p>I broached it. "I think," I said, "I could give you a rest from
the streets of Paris. I think I could find you a job that would
take you back to your Provence for a time."</p>

<p>She scrutinised my face and waited.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said I, "I made you my house-hunter and sent you to
find a little white house down there in Provence."</p>

<p>"Pink is more probable," she said.</p>

<p>"A pretty house, anyhow, tucked away out of sight. With a quiet
white room and a table to write upon. To which I could come and go.
And if you found me also a discreet servant who could cook and look
after me, and if generally you established me there. Could you do a
job like that? Can you be practical enough for that?"</p>

<p>"I'd try," she said. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"I have to go back to England in a day or so for some business.
I shall have to be there a fortnight or three weeks. But I could
give you my address, and you could pack off to Provence at once and
begin looking, and when you had looked for a bit write and tell me
all about it. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Why are <i>you</i> tired of things?" she asked. "You don't have
to prowl about accosting people."</p>

<p>"One gets tired. I can't tell you my history now. And it would
be unnecessary. And too complicated. But I want that job done for
me, and you could do it."</p>

<p>She had dined, and she was warmed by my friendliness. The face
that had seemed jaded was now ten years younger and very animated
and pretty. "I think I would like to do a job for you," she
said.</p>

<p>"Well, do it."</p>

<p>"You would be a pleasant employer."</p>

<p>"For once you need not sell yourself. This is straight
employment."</p>

<p>Our eyes fenced. I could not see the Scotsman anywhere. "Tell me
more about the sort of house you want," she said.</p>

<p>I sketched a house for her briefly, as I desired it.</p>

<p>"I am to find it and arrange it for you?"</p>

<p>"So that I can come and go."</p>

<p>"How could we do it?"</p>

<p>"I shall give you ten thousand francs for the job right
away&mdash;I will give them to you at my hotel to-morrow&mdash;and
afterwards you will tell me what your out-of-pocket expenses are,
and I shall pay those."</p>

<p>"You mean to give me all that money right away?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"But shan't I vanish into Paris with it and never appear again?
Shan't I go off and spend it with my <i>maquereau?</i> What sort of
woman do you take me for?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you will," I said. "For example, you don't keep a
<i>maquereau</i>. You've no use for that sort of pet. If you do
vanish there is nothing to prevent you, of course.</p>

<p>I shall have guessed wrong, that is all. I shall have lost my
stake. I shan't set the police after you, I promise you. You'll be
perfectly free to steal the whole lot of it. I shall have to try
some other way of finding a house."</p>

<p>"I will take that job," said Clementina. "You are not the sort
of man one wants to vanish away from."</p>

<p>She came to a delicate question with the aid of a liqueur. "I am
to live in that house?" she tried and blushed under her paint. She
could blush, for all her <i>savoir-faire</i>.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "That is exactly what you are not to do. I shall
live in that house alone. I want you to take this job as a business
job. Forgive me if I am plain with you. I am tired of love affairs,
grave or gay. I am near to being old. I am not making love to you.
I... I have recently had my heart completely and finally broken. I
don't see why I shouldn't tell you as much. You had better
understand now. When it's mended I mean to keep the vestiges locked
up out of harm's way. You said yourself you were tired of that sort
of thing. You are going to be my house-hunting, servant-finding
secretary. It's a purely business arrangement."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Clementina.</p>

<p>"This is plain business," I said, "and you will be free."</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;I wonder."</p>

<p>"No," I said very firmly, and we smiled at one another. "Does it
seem too good to be true?"</p>

<p>"I'll get you the house you want if I have to build it myself,"
said Clementina in an agreeable burst of approval.</p>

<p>She rested her chin upon her hands and looked at me. It was
still all east and south in her eyes, and they were very charming
eyes. There might have been no Scotland in the world.</p>

<p>"It can't stay like that," she said.</p>

<p>"I mean it to."</p>

<p>She fiddled with a grape upon her plate. "As you will," she said
modestly. "I will try to be a good secretary."</p>

<p>We were now feeling very friendly towards each other. Friendly
and rather amused at our strictly defined relationship. It seemed
to me that she was disposed to linger, but at last I carried her
off in a taxi-auto and dropped her at her obscure address. We did
not loiter at her door. I made my parting salutations with a
respectful decisiveness and returned to the taxi. To-morrow she was
to come and lunch with me at the Meurice and receive her ten
thousand francs. She came, very resolute and businesslike. There
was just a little more of that tentative lingering, but not very
much of it, and then, after a warm hand-shake, off she went with
her money.</p>

<p>But the affair still seemed, I suppose, unsettled and incredible
to Clementina. And in a sense wrong. Her father had been Scotch and
conscientious, her mother Mediterranean and very feminine. For once
the two strains worked together. She had not been gone two hours
and I was writing some letters in my sitting-room when there came a
<i>petit bleu</i> from her.</p>

<p>"You have left me humiliated," it said. "Please come to see me
for a little hour before I go south. There is something important I
really must say to you."</p>

<p>It proved to be of no importance to this history. She went
south, and I returned to England.</p>

<p>The amazing part of the story is that within a week she had
found this delightful Villa Jasmin for me and she had discovered my
excellent Jeanne, which are all and more than I could have desired.
At times I am tempted to believe that after all there must be a
Providence, but one more lax and sympathetic than the nineteenth
century supposed. She wrote me several long, charming letters, in a
sort of Scotch-French-English, describing her success and asking
for instructions, and I astonished her by sending more money to get
the garden and furniture in order before I came. So soon as I could
get my hands clear I followed her and installed myself amidst her
simple and clever arrangements.</p>

<p>But now began a serious trouble that still clouds our
tranquillity here. Deep in Clementina's nature is an exorbitant
desire to love, a possessive, protective, active and caressing
love. She had done her best to lavish it upon the Catholic young
officer and experimentally upon a diminishing series of unworthy
successors. It was like a beautiful gift garment for which she
could find no suitable wearer and not even a peg to hang it upon.
This robe of passionate abandon had not been apparent in Paris; it
had been packed up and put away, but now it became extravagantly
evident in Provence. She declared with plainness and fulness and
inflexible resolution that I was the Heaven-sent recipient of that
delightful, soft and clinging cloak. She demanded the right to
protect and cherish me for the rest of her days.</p>

<p>My own mind was fixed in the idea that I had done with love and
love stories. I was kind but hard with Clementina. I insisted, and
still insist, upon my inviolate study and my inviolate hours. I do
not object to her being the official salaried guardian of my garden
and my household, but I make her go on living in the little pension
on the main road up the hill, in which, with that small,
muff-shaped dog of hers dating from the Dou-Dou days, she had taken
up her quarters. After all, it is not ten minutes away, and when it
is dark I go with her up through the olives. We lunch and dine
together, we go for long walks and keep holiday together, but my
life as a whole remains my own. To these terms Clementina agreed
with a feminine insincerity that never ceases to encroach.</p>

<p>So we go on. She has stayed on here, and in spite of some
dangerous struggles I have been able to sustain my tyranny. We are
intimate friends, and for the most part I keep her at arm's length
from my personal freedom.</p>

<p>It is not always harmony here. Clementina can display some
astonishing moods. The Scotch engineer must have had the devil of a
temper, and the Greek mother transmitted a pagan streak straight
from primordial times. I feel, too, that there must have been
unrecorded odd elements on the side of the Scotch engineer's
mother. She was, I guess, an extremely argumentative person.
Rhetorically argumentative. Swift and fierce in her opinions. But
all the Clementinas are swift and fierce in their opinions,
whichever constituent opinionates. Sometimes everything is judged
from the standpoint of a chateau in a backward part of France
(Dou-Dou), sometimes from a Parisian <i>parterre</i> (various other
authorities), sometimes from the Piraeus (mother and the
relations), and sometimes from the Longer Catechism. This
complexity is perplexing, but by no means repulsive to a scientific
intelligence. And in the end Clementina herself adjudicates.
Through all these moods and confusions flow&mdash;sometimes in the
sunlight and sometimes underground&mdash;a stream of
affectionateness and whim and generosity that is all the Clementina
that matters. It makes the final decisions.</p>

<p>There are occasions when I wish she would not ask quite so many
questions about this book I am writing or that she would ponder
some of the answers more profoundly. And generally that she would
construct more of her conversation in some other form than the
interrogative. But that is a minor trouble.</p>

<p>I know too vividly how Clementina in a stubborn or a storming
mood can disturb and upset this philosophical tranquillity, but I
doubt if I begin to estimate how much I prey upon her, what a
stroke of luck this freak of devotion is for me, and how entirely
she makes things possible here. Here I can come and go, working out
the last phase of my life. Here at last I seem to find complete
unity and peace of mind. I lead a full man's life here, and yet I
exist also in London and at Downs-Peabody quite as fully and
competently.</p>

<p>My life has, in fact, been doubled. If my mind stales in
Provence, I go to the stir of England again, but I am glad to come
back. Always a little more pleased to find Clementina still
besieging me. I can appreciate my contentment with this place more
easily than I can explain it. There is a novel and peculiar liberty
in this seclusion. I am able to think in it without haste or
disturbance. One came into the world to think. I am astonished to
consider how little I have thought consecutively before I came
here. Now I can live for days together without restlessness or
urgencies, without invasions or distractions, apart from the world
and yet still in the sunshine of life.</p>

<p>This house, this room, give exactly the aloofness and the
detachment I was seeking&mdash;a detachment so animated and
qualified by Clementina that it neither bores nor distresses me. I
am never lonely spirited here.</p>

<p>With some hope of results now I can review my world as a whole,
balance alien considerations, work out the form of the great
revolution that is happening in human affairs and in the human
mind. Here I can define at last the Open Conspiracy that arises in
the human will to meet and wrestle with the moulding forces of the
universe, that Open Conspiracy to which in the end I believe I
shall succeed in correlating all my conscious being.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-1" name="b5-1"></a>§ 1. METAMORPHOSIS OF MANKIND</h2>

<p class="first">Now with my story told I can come to the gist of
my matter, to the new ways of living that are, I believe, opening
out before mankind. I will at first set out only the broad lines of
my ideas. After I have written this book I hope to return to the
questions I am now raising and work over much that here I give in
skeleton.</p>

<p>I will write as clearly as possible, but I must ask the reader
to be patient if at times I am a little heavy and reiterative in
this part. I am not a professional man of letters; my interests
have been in things and practical ideas rather than in fine and
graceful writing, and my utmost ambition is to be plain and strong.
If I could set out what I have to say with charm and brilliance I
would be only too glad to do so. I would make it as attractive as I
could. But I am writing for the sake of the matter and not for the
sake of the writing.</p>

<p>I have already given a sketch of the development of life and of
the forces and accidents that have made human society out of what
was once a sub-human species, rare in its numbers and scattered and
almost solitary in its habits. In a few thousands of centuries this
profound essential change has been brought about. From being a
prowler man has become a hunter, a hunter in packs, and in the last
hundred centuries or so he has taken to agriculture, become the
first of the mammals to be economic as well as social, and
developed societies on such a scale as life has never known before,
not even among the termites and ants and bees. This process still
goes on with if anything an increasing rapidity. No living species
except such as have passed under catastrophic circumstances towards
extinction has ever been under so violent a drive of change as
man.</p>

<p>The violence of the drive is even more conspicuous when it is
measured against the length and scope of man's individual life. In
my own lifetime his usual food, his range of activity, his rate of
reproduction and the spirit in which he reproduces, his average
length of life, his prevalent diseases, his habitations and his
coverings have changed. No animal species has ever yet survived
such rapid and comprehensive changes.</p>

<p>I have sketched a brief history of the beginnings of habitual
labour, of the network of money and debts which holds us now all
dependent upon one another, and of the rapid expansion of scale
which has been the dominant theme in our affairs for the last two
centuries. I have shown the lives of my father and my brother and
myself as whirled along the lines they have taken, by the forces of
this enlargement. My father with the swift poison gripping his
heart and holding it suddenly still, Dickon bashfully accepting a
baronetcy, and I, with Sirrie Evans sleeping and then dead in my
arms, Minnie and my mother, Helen and Clementina, Roderick and
Julian, are all no more than minute specks upon the figure, atomies
in the body, of this synthetic evolution of human society that is
in progress.</p>

<p>I would compare what is happening to the human species with what
happens to an insect that undergoes a complete metamorphosis. Man
was a species living in detached and separated communities; he is
now being gathered together into one <i>community</i>. He is
becoming one great co-operative interplay of life which is
replacing a monotony of individual variations. He is changing in
every social relationship and developing a new world of ideas and
mental reactions, habits of mind and methods of feeling and action,
in response to the appeal of the new conditions. Nature, I take it,
is impartial and inexorable. He is no specially favoured child. If
he adapt he passes on to a new phase in the story of life; if he
fail to solve the riddles he faces now he may differentiate, he may
degenerate, he may die out altogether. One thing Nature will not
endure of him: that he stay as he is.</p>

<p>I do not regard the organisation of all mankind into one
terrestrial anthill, into Cosmopolis, the greater Athens, the Rome
and Paris and London of space and time, as a Utopian dream, as
something that fantastically might be. I regard it as the
necessary, the only possible continuation, of human history. To
fail to take that road will mean a fraying-out and a finish to that
history, a relapse through barbarism to savagery, to the hard
chances of animal life, for a creature too scarce and long-lived to
be readily adaptable, and so at last surely to extinction.</p>

<p>None of this is theorising; it is a statement of truths, austere
and manifest. These alternatives are as much a matter of fact as
the starvation of a large majority of mankind if ploughing and
sowing were abandoned.</p>

<p>Another aspect, another idea of the human synthesis I have also
developed throughout these papers, and I return to it now and take
it up again. It is this: that since the earlier stages of the
individual development through its embryonic and childish and
youthful years are more or less mutilated vestiges and imperfect
recapitulations of earlier adult states, fish, reptile, early
mammal, monkey, and savage, so all the moods and motives of adult
life in our nearer history must now, if the race is to achieve its
necessary accommodations and survive, be in process of relegation
to the status of puerility and adolescence; and a new phase of
wider, less personal feeling and outlook, must be expanding to fill
the main years, the lengthening span of years in the individual
life of the coming generations. Man like any other living creature
must change with new conditions, and this, if he is to go on, must
be the direction of his change. The new stage of human experience
demands what I have already been calling a new adult phase, and
conceivably also a new post-adult phase, in the normal life, based
on broader and sounder common ideas, expressed in new terms and new
artistic forms, and accompanied by profound nervous and other
physiological changes. From man's soul to man's chemistry this
necessity to change and expand extends.</p>

<p>It involves altogether new political habits, a rearrangement and
readjustment of moral and religious ideas and feelings, a new
conception and method of education. The religious teachings of the
past, the honours, loyalties, heroisms that adorn history, its
science, its philosophy, its artistic expressions take on from this
standpoint a juvenile and incomplete air. They will seem, they
begin to seem, childish, puerile, sentimental, and greenly
youthful. The great kings and conquerors of the past are already
apprehended, and will be more and more apprehended as naIve and
short-witted; we realise how egotistical and vain they were,
egotistical and vain as leading and clever children who "show off"
are egotistical and vain, we see them in their glory, tawdry,
limited, and artlessly, almost innocently, wasteful and cruel. We
see war no longer as a tragIc necessity in human life, but as a
horrible puerility. We apprehend conquest as a blunder, and
patriotism like the barking of village dogs.</p>

<p>Many people in this present dawn of an age of conscious change
are coming to accept this transfiguration of the dignities of
history; but such a realisation of the past as preparatory is only
a prelude to the realisation of the present as provisional, in form
and in texture. This next mental step has still to be taken even by
the majority of educated and intelligent people to-day. They have
still to apply <i>Panta rhei</i> to their own affairs, to their
activities to-day and their plans for to-morrow. That is less easy
for them to achieve because it implies a change in their habits of
living. Many stick at the mental, and almost all of them stick at
the practical, recognition that the traditions, morals, political
and economic usages of this time, dissolve, cease to be imperative
or make new demands upon them, year by year, as they live out their
lives. They feel the times toss and jostle and strain them, but
they are not yet prepared to. thrust back against and control and
steer the changes of the times.</p>

<p>This is a transitional state of affairs. Almost all this
revelation of the current metamorphosis of human society and
relationships has been made quite recently, since indeed my father
was a young man. What I have been writing here in the last few
pages of the metamorphosis in progress is now known in
matter-of-fact guise, by any well-read, well-educated person. The
statement is made very clearcut here and put aggressively, but
there is nothing absolutely new in it. Yet it would have seemed
fantastic beyond description, shockingly fantastic, to anyone born
a hundred years ago. No one was fully awake then to what was
already going on. It is no great wonder that a vision so newly
attained has yet to produce the changes it is ultimately bound to
produce in our ways of living and in the spirit of our lives.</p>

<p>It is, as I pointed out in my introduction, in the nature of
childhood to believe this is a permanently arranged world. In the
past hardly anyone got beyond childhood in this respect. People
thought that change was incidental, upon the surface of permanent
arrangements. It is only now that a few of us begin to realise with
any fulness that it is change which is fundamental and permanence
which is only apparent and incidental. It is a natural thing to
think in the former way; it is a result of experience and thought
to awaken to the latter. And so it is that people are everywhere
going on with old, and now often mischievous, loyalties and
patriotisms, with old economic habits and old social assumptions
that are no longer valid, that they are failing to make the new
generation that grows up under their care realise the insecurities
among which they are living, and that the metamorphosis of human
society proceeds against such increasing resistances that it may
even fail to achieve itself, and end in the failure and death of
the specIes.</p>

<p>The present resistance to the reconstruction of human affairs
comes quite as much from the uninstructed young as from the
unconverted old. These resistances are not merely due to the
inadaptability of a generation that will presently die out. The
young are revolutionary, in as much as they rebel naturally against
constituted authority, but they are also reactionary in so far as
they recapitulate the mental phases of the past. And we are doing
little or nothing to correct that innate disposition. Our
educational methods do not merely fail to inform the young of the
immense demands life is making upon them; they conceal those
demands. Humanity is confronted by the necessities and
opportunities of a great metamorphosis, and our wills and
imaginations are lagging and we are failing to square ourselves and
prepare our successors for the great tasks of our inheritance.</p>

<p>This "Open Conspiracy" I am now setting myself to explain, is a
project to make the apprehension of this metamorphosis fundamental
and directive in human affairs. It is an attempt to harmonise
people's lives with this metamorphosis and to undermine and defeat
the resistances that may divert its forces towards destruction.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-2" name="b5-2"></a>§ 2. OPEN CONSPIRACY</h2>

<p class="first">I DO not see this attainment of a new maturity for
our race, which will thrust back what have hitherto been the adult
characteristics of mankind into a mere phase of development, as a
necessary and inevitable one. The attempt may fail. It may fail and
mankind may fail and become extinct; there is no guarantee whatever
against that, no modern rainbow of assurance in our ampler skies.
The metamorphosis of mankind calls imperatively upon the will and
effort of all who grasp its significance. By their response it
succeeds or fails.</p>

<p>And now I come to the question of the gathering together of this
open conspiracy to change the laws, customs, rules, and
institutions of the world. From what classes and types are the
revolutionaries to be drawn? How are they to be brought into
co-operation? What are to be their methods? How much are they to
have in common?</p>

<p>To begin with the answering of that. Manifestly it is absurd to
think of creative revolution unless it has power in its hands, and
manifestly the chief seats of creative power in the world are on
the one hand modern industry associated with science and on the
other world finance. The people who have control in these affairs
can change the conditions of human life constructively and to the
extent of their control. No other people can so change them.</p>

<p>All other sorts of power in the world are either contributory or
restrictive or positively obstructive or positively destructive.
The power of established and passive property, for example, is
simply the power to hold up for a price. The power of the masses is
the strike, it embodies itself in the machine-breaking,
expert-hunting mob. I have written already of Vishnu and Siva. The
point I want to make clear here is that it is only through a
conscious, frank, and worldwide co-operation of the man of science,
the scientific worker, the man accustomed to the direction of
productive industry, the man able to control the arterial supply of
credit, the man who can control newspapers and politicians, that
the great system of changes they have almost inadvertently got
going can be brought to any hopeful order of development.</p>

<p>Such men, whether they mean to be or not, are the actual
revolutionaries in our world. Among them it is and in no other
direction that we must look for the first effectual appearance of
the new adult mind in co-operative association. If they cannot lead
mankind forward to an assured possession of its new ampler life
then I do not see how that necessary forward stride can ever be
made. Humanity may stagger for some time if they prove ineffectual,
for a few score years, a few centuries perhaps, upon the verge of a
world unity, thinking great thoughts, expressing noble sentiments,
making some lovely things, to relapse definitely into a decadence,
a slipping back, a slackening hold, a sliding, and a falling.</p>

<p>I admit how poor are the present materials for this creative
conspiracy. In what has gone before I have examined the scope and
motives of the possessing, directing sort of people in the world
and in particular I have done what I can to lay bare the quality of
my brother and myself. I believe we two are fair average specimens
of the outlook and impulse of our kind. I have tried to show how
tentative we are and how we are entangled at every turn
with&mdash;-shall I call it Crest? The Crest tradition. The
necessary start from a partnership with Crest. I have done my best
to confess my own tangle of desires, to indicate at least my
warring impulses and obsessions and indisciplines. Yet, as Dickon
said, "weak as we are, those others are weaker." It is out of us
and our sort, and from among the scientific workers we can
associate with us, that the consummation of the great revolution
must come. There appears no other kind of men better able to carry
it through. There are none. If we did not start through Vishnu as
partners of Crest, then we should have to start as officials for
Siva, fags for the doctrinaires, after a Communist revolution.</p>

<p>Give me the armorial Crests! Rather the dukes than the
doctrinaires. I have no doubt&mdash;after my glimpses of Bolshevik
industrialism&mdash;that ours is the more hopeful method of
beginning.</p>

<p>I know some good men who are of the other way of thinking, but
they are scientific rather than directive men. For my own part I
shall keep to the right now and not try the left. Neither road goes
straight to the goal we have to attain, the goal of a
scientifically organised economic world unity, but though the right
road be rocky and tortuous, it is I believe far more likely to get
there in the end than the left. I may be influenced by my own
economic position: every Communist is trained to that explanation;
and if I am wrong, well, then good luck to the left! For my own
part I shall travel by the blue train to the end of my story. I
shall look to America rather than Moscow for the first instalments
of the real revolution.</p>

<p>It must be quite evident that we and our generation of
enterprising and power-attaining men are only a beginning, that we
are a mass of unrealised possibilities. As Dickon said of
Northcliffe, power took us by surprise. We are not the finished
samples of the new sort of men; we are only the raw material. We
were not told, we were not educated, we were not aware of our kind;
we had to disentangle ourselves from a world jungle of misleading
representations. It is not necessary that those who follow us
should be at such a disadvantage.</p>

<p>I believe that Dickon and I are not abnormal types. I believe
that we industrials and the financiers are beginning to educate
ourselves and broaden our outlook as our enterprises grow and
interweave. I believe that if we can sufficiently develop the
consciousness of contemporary business and associate with it the
critical co-operation and the co-operative criticism of scientific
and every other sort of able man, we can weave a world system of
monetary and economic activities, while the politicians, the
diplomatists, and soldiers are still too busy with their ancient
and habitual antics to realise what we are doing. We may grow
strong enough not only to restrain, but suppress their
interference. We can build up the monetary and economic world
republic in full daylight under the noses of those who represent
the old system. For the most part I believe that to understand us
will be to be with us, and that we shall sacrifice no advantage and
incur no risk of failure, in talking out and carrying out our
projects and methods quite plainly.</p>

<p>That is what I mean by an Open Conspiracy. It is not a project
to overthrow existing governments by insurrectionary attacks, but
to supersede them by disregard. It does not want to destroy them or
alter their forms but to make them negligible by replacing their
functions. It will respect them as far as it must. What is useful
of them it will use; what is useless it will efface by its stronger
reality; it will join issue only with what is plainly antagonistic
and actively troublesome. It seeks to consolidate and keep alive
and develop the living powers in the world to-day by an
illumination, a propaganda, a literature, a culture, an education,
and the consciously evoked expectation of a new society.</p>

<p>It is only natural that a common interest and understanding
should develop among all of us who are dealers in world realities
as our enterprises extend and intertwine more and more. The
nationalist groups and cliques that divide us to-day, the feuds and
rivalries, are mere legacies from the passing order from which we
release ourselves. Their persistence is part of our crudity and
inexperience. Our true quality is cosmopolitan. We become the true
International, because our activities extend throughout the world.
Our international ideas are complex, material, and real. When we
cease to think ourselves British, American, German, or French, we
do not become vaguely cosmopolitan; we become world-steel,
world-shipping, world-cotton, world-food.</p>

<p>The International of the Workers, in spite of its more explicit
organisation, is even now an altogether less substantial affair
than the business-international. It has been easier to organise for
that very reason. It is so of necessity because of the limited
outlook of the common worker, put to work too soon, ill-informed,
and easily misled. He has feelings in the place of ideas. His
International is a mere community of resentful sentiment directed
against the general order of the world and against us as employers.
And we I think incur that hostility not so much on our merits as on
account of our association as successors and partners, with the
Crest tradition and its disregard of common human needs, and
because of the aggressive extravagances of expenditure in which we
permit our creditors and our Lady Steinharts&mdash;and ourselves in
our laxer moments&mdash;to indulge. If European business men are
men tainted with "Crestism," the Americans seem to me to carry a
heavier load of useless women and heirs. These are matters needing
correction. But a clearer day may come when the improving manners
and intelligence of the employer and the better information of less
stupidly directed workers may bring these now antagonistic
Internationals to an understanding.</p>

<p>Many things that now seem incurably antagonistic, communism and
international finance for example, may so develop in the next
half-century as to come to work side by side, upon a parallel
advance. At present big distributing businesses are firmly
antagonistic to co-operative consumers' associations; yet one or
two of the big distributors have already made important deals with
these large-scale economic organisations from the collectivist
side. Both work at present upon very crude assumptions about social
psychology and social justice. Both tend to internationalise under
the same material stresses.</p>

<p>I find it hard to doubt the inevitability of a very great
improvement in the quality and intellectual solidarity of those who
will be conducting the big business of the world in the next
century, an extension and an increased lucidity of vision, a
broadened and deepened morale. Possibly my temperament inclines me
to think that what should be must be. But it is patently absurd to
me to assume that the sort of men who control so much of our
banking today, limited, traditional, careless, or doctrinaire, are
the ultimate types of banker. It seems as irrational to suppose
that such half-educated, unprepared adventurers as Dickon and
myself and our partners and contemporaries are anything but
makeshift industrial leaders, and that better men will not follow
us. Dickon and I are, after all, at best early patterns, 1865 and
1867 models. And the spirit of the money market and of business
enterprise to-day is far finer than it was in my father's days.
These things in the logical course of their development must
improve.</p>

<p>Equally absurd is it to suppose that the modern newspaper is
more than a transitory medium of communication and discussion, and
that we shall not presently produce men who will handle the press
and the new powers of public suggestion and education still latent
in the cinematograph and broadcasting, with a creative intelligence
far beyond any present experience. Economic life in a few score
years ahead may be carried on in a light and with an education and
inspiration almost incomparably better than ours.</p>

<p>And the labour leader that we know to-day, so vacuously
emotional and unsound, is equally a transitory type. The younger
men are different, clear, harder, less disposed to clasp hands with
us and more able to lock minds with us and come to practical
understandings.</p>

<p>None of these new types of men that begin to appear can have had
anything but sentimental and acquiescent regards for the things of
the past. It is incredible to me that many of them have not been
thinking as Dickon and I have been thinking, and that their
thoughts will not presently find expression in discussion and
literature, and that they will not produce a distinctive culture,
affect education profoundly and develop an international social
life of their own. Sir George Midas is half a century out of date
as a study of the <i>nouveau riche</i>. After all he was only
emphasising the glories of the old order when he got himself cigars
and diamond rings a trifle too large and filled his marble halls
with footmen in plush. The Victorian Crests were foolish perhaps to
sneer him on to better things. Most of the big business men I know
to-day are men of unassuming presence and temperate expenditure.
They dislike display and evade Society. They practise much private
civility. They seem to be illiterate and Philistine at present
largely because contemporary literature is so extensively concerned
with fantasies and imitations and allusions that have no
significance for them, and art with the vogues of the studios. The
insufficiency is rather in the art and the literature they
disregard than in themselves. The art and literature of the
eighteenth century was done to please an aristocracy and of the
nineteenth century to please a bourgeoisie. They have still to
develop a relationship to the modern man of energy.</p>

<p>As these new powers realise more and more completely their
distinctive quality, and produce fresh aspects and complementary
functions of this new adult phase they are constituting, they will
necessarily evoke types of literary and artistic work in harmony
with their general activities, and depart more and more definitely
from the second-hand social customs to which they now rather
ungraciously adapt themselves.</p>

<p>Because of its continual progressiveness this great revolution
which is now becoming apparent must necessarily continue to be open
and explicit, continue to appeal to fresh types and extend its
spirit and understandings into the lives of a larger and larger
proportion of mankind. In no other way can it escape frustration.
In that sustained openness it differs from any preceding process of
success and replacement. History is full of the rise and fall of
classes, priesthoods, dynasties, aristocracies. Each class as it
comes up to predominance in the story sets itself to establish
itself for ever; makes laws, constitutions, to fix its
characteristics and defy all subsequent change. It rules, it
tyrannises, it loses vigour and flexibility; with a diminishing
resourcefulness and a fatal obstinacy it fights the slow and
merciless will that has ground it out and will grind it away.</p>

<p>That is the common history of all past ascendencies. Such
attempts at fixation were possible because the rate of change in
their conditions was not fast enough to make such hopes of
permanence manifestly futile. But the modern maker of values never
reaches a breathing point f or such delusions to establish
themselves. The adaptation of modern enterprise is unceasing. Each
victory is no more than a foothold for the next phase. Success is
not a throne but an entrance. We of Romer, Steinhart do not dare to
disregard new suggestions or exclude new able men from a share in
our directorates. All our monopolies are conditional monopolies;
our patents pass out of our hands if we do not avail ourselves of
them. We live only if we keep alive.</p>

<p>This which I call a conspiracy to reconstruct human life is
therefore necessarily open and outspoken because all who are
concerned in it realise that their utmost knowledge is provisional
and their utmost achievement experimental. There is no part of the
world, no race, no station, that presently may not be able to
contribute something essential. This open conspiracy is indeed the
application of the scientific method to the whole of life. Since
scientific research ceased to be a secret occupation, since its
great expansion began three centuries ago with the beginning of f
rank publication and unrestricted discussion, miners, cobblers,
lapidaries, grocers' assistants, rustic priests (not least these
last), side by side with noblemen like Cavendish and great
professors like Huxley, have contributed inestimable things. The
social and political revolution before us must cast its net as
widely. Necessarily it begins in practice in and about the
direction of great financial and industrial developments because
these things are the vital centres of social existence. There we
are likely to find the greatest concentration of energetic types.
But the greater these grow the less can they remain proprietorial.
The less can they sustain any privacy about their general
operations. The less can they exclude the outside man who is able
and determined to participate in their control, who is able and
willing to criticise and offer suggestions.</p>

<p>Exclude! We invite! In spite of Crest we keep up a perpetual
hunt for capable and vigorous men whom we can bring into our
operations. So do such systems as the American Steel Trust and J.
P. Morgan and Rockefellers and Brunner Mond and Schneider-Creusot
and Krupps and Tatas and the German electrical and chemical
combines and the Ruhr steel group and the wonderful Zeiss firm and
Kodaks and Fords and so on and so forth up and down and all through
the tangle of modern productive and business activities. It is a
far simpler, more honest and more certain career now for a poor and
gifted young man to set out to make himself a director in the
Romer, Steinhart system than to become an office-holding
politician. The work is cleaner, the pay better, the position more
assured.</p>

<p>This disposition towards the open board-room has increased
conspicuously during the last few decades, and it will go on
increasing. We industrials have got our affairs on to a scale when
we want to hear them discussed and avail ourselves of every
suggestion. The financiers are following us towards the light. We
all realise the need of being understood. We realise the danger to
ourselves and to our concerns and to the whole world, in secret
operations. We are more afraid of our own shadows than of anything
else whatever. We want to be lit on every side. We do not want to
cast shadows because the shadows we cast are so large that the most
destructive mischiefs, thefts of energy, diversions of purpose, can
hide and mature in them.</p>

<p>I think now I have made plain what I mean by Open Conspiracy. It
is the simplification by concentration into large organisations of
the material life of the whole human community in an atmosphere of
unlimited can dour. It is explanation and invitation to every
intelligent human being to understand and assist. It is the
abandonment of all reservation in the economic working of the
world. It is the establishment of the economic world-state by the
deliberate invitation, explicit discussion, and co-operation of the
men most interested in economic organisation, men chosen by their
work, called to it by a natural disposition and aptitude for it,
fully aware of its importance and working with the support of an
increasing general understanding.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-3" name="b5-3"></a>§ 3. WORLD DIRECTORATE</h2>

<p class="first">HOW does this open conspiracy stand to the
governments, the legal systems and the politics of to-day? These
governments embody the evaporating ideas of the past. They occupy
the ground we need. They are now largely entanglements and
obstacles. They are like deadweight debenture-holders or old plant
in the face of revolutionary inventions. They have a certain value
in maintaining order and suppressing local violence, but they carry
very poisonous traditions with them, they function inadequately,
dangerously and at a heavy price; they divide, they waste energy
upon false rivalries; they may quite possibly check the development
of new methods altogether.</p>

<p>The larger part of human troubles at the present time, the
undiminished peril and pressure of war, the recurring waves of
financial and economic disorder, are due almost entirely to the
relative unalterability of political and legal methods in the face
of a general process of material change. Types of ships, railways,
roads, machinery of every sort, methods of manufacture, methods of
credit, are superseded, scrapped, replaced; scale of businesses,
areas of operation enlarge; systems of production and distribution
absorb, extend, amalgamate; they do so against friction, sometimes
against friction that becomes nearly overwhelming. The kings, the
parliaments and congresses, the law courts and flags and
boundaries, on the other hand, stick on with the imbecile
inadaptability of inanimate figures.</p>

<p>Their relative inflexibility is enormous. They are not regarded
in general as methods at all; they are regarded as sacred
conditions to which the living activities of human society must
adapt themselves. They are sustained; they sustain themselves by an
immense propaganda of conservatism. The chief problem before the
progressive revolutionary, after he has secured his primary need,
freedom of speech and discussion, is to bend, break, evade,
minimise, get round or over or through the political institutions
of the present time. The political history of the world since the
war has been largely a story of conference after conference.
Washington, Geneva, Locarno, for example, in which in a sort of
blindfold way the better sense of mankind has striven to release
itself from these stupid and dangerous entanglements and feel its
way towards a wider welfare.</p>

<p>Our purpose in this Open Conspiracy, in which we do not so much
engage ourselves as discover ourselves engaged, is to build up the
organisation of a world state, a single terrestrial system of
economic production and social cooperation. We do this not upon an
open site but upon a world already mapped out in an extremely
impracticable and inconvenient fashion into sovereign states,
empires, kingdoms, republics, each of which is fenced in by the
most elaborate defences against overt absorption. Each sovereignty
is an implicit repudiation of our purpose.</p>

<p>What is going to be our strategy in the face of this
opposition?</p>

<p>There is a disposition apparent in many quarters to mitigate the
present political fragmentation of mankind by methods drawn from
the old politics. eminent statesmen of sovereign states,
unaccustomed to anything between themselves and high heaven, are to
meet and arrange for very considerable mitigations of sovereignty.
They are to bind themselves and their national governments to
respect the arbitration of largely alien tribunals, to agree to
various measures of disarmament and mutual assistance, each
according to his own measure of efficiency and good faith. This is
no doubt the only strictly legal way; none the less is it a way of
highly improbable issue. In the end it might, under the most
hopeful conditions, give the world a sort of super-Washington, a
Supreme Court of international law and a confederated world
government with a limited ability to call upon national armies and
navies to enforce its decisions. But though this is the only proper
legal way, I doubt if it is the effective or desirable way, and I
doubt still more whether the sort of Federal World Congress it
might ultimately produce, with its delegated and attenuated powers
and its constitution repeating the most approved features of its
constituent governments, would be able to perform any of the chief
functions of an adequate world control.</p>

<p>It follows therefore that the way we have to pursue must
be&mdash;-how shall I phrase it?&mdash;sub- or super-legal. That is
to say, revolutionary.</p>

<p>People are too apt to assume that a world directorate, a world
republic, would have to be just the sort of government we find
to-day in a typical sovereign state, magnified to a world
size&mdash;a sort of Parliament of Mankind with a World President,
a World Emperor, in some suitably placed palace. They imagine some
one hoisting the "world flag" amidst an uproar of military bands
and a blaze of "world" uniforms. I think that is an entirely
misleading assumption. All the governments that exist in the world
to-day are combative governments fundamentally; a world directorate
would be on the other hand fundamentally a government for the
preservation of peace. The old type of government from which our
present ones derive, regarded war as the primary fact in life and
took the small scale multitudinous economic affairs of its people
almost for granted. The world government we desire will be
primarily social and economic. It will have hands instead of teeth
and claws. It will not be a descendant or a direct development; it
will have evolved along a different line.</p>

<p>No existing government seems capable of doing without a flag.
Yet a flag has no real significance for peaceful uses. The head of
the current state is traditionally a fighting figure. Before the
war the numerous royal families of Europe almost lived in uniform.
They were ready, aye ready. Their survivors show no disposition to
relinquish the swaggering role. Wherever the remaining monarchs go
the soldiers still turn out and salute, and every loyal Englishman
ceases to be a rational creature and stiffens to the likeness of a
ramrod at the first blare of the national anthem. No king would
ever dream of turning out and inspecting the electricians or the
economic entomologists or the medical officers of health. He is a
soldier by blood on the distaff side quite as much as on the other.
Not an old lady among them that is not at least a colonel two or
three times over. Even to-day the aunts and grandmothers of royalty
are carried to the grave on gun-carriages and buried with military
honours. At the slightest provocation to the national consciousness
at an Empire Exhibition for example, or at a patriotic tattoo, the
Prince of Wales and the Duke of York leap into scarlet and
bearskins and become almost magnificent figures.</p>

<p>No doubt the multitude feels its dread of foreign foes and their
knavish tricks greatly assuaged by these displays; it likes to
think of those dear old ladies as Brunhildas and Bellonas and of
pleasant young gentlemen as War Gods, but the whole spirit of this
royalty business is flatly incompatible with world unity. And let
me remind the American reader that this essentially combative
attribution is as true of the White House as it is of Windsor. The
presidential office only reaches its full development when the
States are at war. Then in sentiment if not in practice Mr.
Coolidge is expected to buckle on the sword of George Washington,
summon his levies and lead out the embattled farmers of New York,
Chicago, Fall River, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlantic
City and Denver, to victory or death.</p>

<p>But a world government will not be a combative government; there
will be nothing to combat. The world republic will be fighting
nothing but time and space and death. It will have no foreign
minister. It will have no army or navy. Its general suavity will be
tempered by an effective intolerance of armaments and of the making
of lethal weapons anywhere. Necessarily. It will have no need to
express itself even by the most generalised of flags, the most
amalgamated of uniforms, the most attenuated of breastplates,
swords and spurs. It will neither expand nor conquer nor subdue nor
include the governments of to-day; it will efface them.</p>

<p>If on the one hand the coming world directorate will obliterate
many of what we now regard as the most essential aspects of
contemporary governments, it will on the other penetrate far more
deeply than they do into the current life of mankind. It will be
actively organising the world production and world distribution of
most staple products; it will have incorporated the steel trust,
all the mineralogical industries, all the chemical industries,
power production and distribution, agricultural production and
distribution, milling, catering, the transport organisations of the
world and the chief retailing businesses into one interlocking
system. It will exploit all the wind and water power of the world.
It will in fact be the gigantic world-plant of which Romer,
Steinhart, Crest and Co., their allies, subsidiaries and
associates, are the germ. It will be not a world kingdom nor a
world empire nor a world state but a world business
organisation.</p>

<p>Its constitution will have grown with its development; it will
no doubt have an extremely intricate constitution but one
nevertheless in practical harmony with its functions. It will be
checking its efficiency and varying and improving its processes
easily and naturally through the research departments it will have
evolved. It will be making a record of its proceedings and exposing
itself freely to criticism. And it will be directing the education
and biological life of the world community because of the same
necessities that have already made Romer, Steinhart's, almost in
spite of themselves, founders of technical schools, library and
theatre proprietors, builders of industrial suburbs, vital
statisticians, and keepers of their workers' health.</p>

<p>It is because of this essential difference between the old order
and the new that I disbelieve in any political methods of effecting
the change. The difference is so wide that to a certain extent the
two orders can have a collateral existence. For nearly a century
the new has been able to develop very considerably in despite of
the old. But the two systems are necessarily entangled, and sooner
or later they must interfere and come into conflict.</p>

<p>Political activities on the part of those who are renovating
civilisation may then be necessary, but even so they will remain
secondary activities. It may become"imperative that men of the new
type should throw their resources into the scale with or against
Vishnu or Siva in the supreme interest of free discussion and
personal liberty. Some bravo government may have to be lifted from
the shoulders of a people. Or the gags of some doctrinaire
domination may have to be relieved. But though the old-type ruler
and politician may often be an antagonist and sometimes an ally, he
can never be an instrument. The further he is kept away from
economic and biological administration the better for the world. He
is the wrong man to look to. Creative-minded people have been
wasting themselves for a century by looking to him.</p>

<p>It is not only that by his nature he would be obliged to operate
these new worldwide processes within the localised limits of
national and imperial boundaries, but also that by the very
conditions that raise him to power he is always either rigidly
traditional or tempted at every turn to sacrifice sound working to
a reassuring effectiveness. And whether his transitory power is the
outcome of inheritance or of an election or of a pronunciamento, he
will still be profoundly inexperienced in the intricate balances
and reactions of economic life.</p>

<p>It was by turning towards politics and deserting the vigorous
initiatives of that inspired industrialist, Robert Owen, that
Socialism went astray, and it is to the political delusion that we
owe now, in nearly every country under the sun, the spectacle of a
large futile Labour-Socialist party which clamours while it is in
opposition for the nationalisation and socialisation of everything,
and gives way to a helpless terror of administration so soon as it
finds itself in office. The public meeting where every breath of
response is magnified to an immense impressiveness, the party
committee rooms, the fretful attic, are the worst of all possible
preparatory schools for business management. The only people,
practically, who know how to manage transport, the exploitation of
natural products and industrial activities generally are the people
who are engaged in doing so now.</p>

<p>This is an unpalatable truth for other kinds of men, but it has
to be stomached. What we have to do is to develop the common
consciousness of such directive people and liberate them from the
traditions of the past. We want them to extend themselves to the
moral and biological consequences of their activities. We want them
to realise themselves completely. It is equally futile to think of
putting them under Lenin's dreadful "armed workers" or leaving them
subject to the interference of the traditional rulers of the
western world. They themselves have to rule.</p>

<p>If we set aside political methods as hopeless for the purpose of
replacing the present fragmentary and combative governments of
mankind by an intelligent world rule, then we must cast about for
other ways of forwarding that revolution. It needs no very profound
analysis of the situation to show what these must be. The first
group of activities is mental. We have to exhibit and persuade. The
new phase in world affairs has reached a point of development at
which self-assertion is not only possible but imperative. The world
republic must begin to explain itself, to challenge the still
dominant traditions that impede its full growth, to make a
propaganda for the conscious adhesion of men and women. It has to
call for its own literature and use the press it already so largely
sustains, explicitly for its own creative ends. Big financial and
big business men have often, I know, a considerable fear of
publicity, but it is a fear out of which they must grow. They dread
Siva too much and tolerate Vishnu too easily. It is high time to
end this furtiveness. We have to remember that the sole strength of
the political and social institutions amidst which we live and make
our way to-day so tediously and wastefully and dangerously, lies in
the fact that they are traditional and established. If we could
start humanity afresh, wipe out its memories, and confront it only
with the material, apparatus and problems of the present and the
future, no one would dream of setting up the nationalisms and
particularisms and privileges that entangle us to-day. Their sole
justification lies in past engagements. They are not painted in
fast colours and the memory of them needs to be continually
renewed. For them at any rate there is no recuperative force in the
silent touch of living realities.</p>

<p>When the old order tootles its trumpets and waves its flags,
obtrudes its tawdry loyalties, exaggerates the splendours of its
past and fights to sustain the ancient hallucinations, the new must
counter with its tale of great bridges and canals and embankments,
of mighty ships and beautiful machines, of the subtle victories of
the laboratory and the deepening wonders of science. It must tell
of lives lit up and life invigorated, of new releases and new
freedoms and happiness ensured. The new world we establish is
visibly greater and nobler than the old; it liberates the last of
the slaves, rejectS servility, calls on every man for help and
service. It gives finer stuff for poetry and&mdash;better news for
the press. I would lay stress upon that point that even now it
gives the better news. The old stuff bores. It is no mere detail
but a fact full of hopefulness that, for all itS affectation of
romantic interest, the old stuff bores. Patriots are bores;
nationalists are bores; kings and princes are <i>ex-officio</i>
terrible bores. Boredom is a great motive power. I myself am a
revolutionary mainly because the formal and established things, the
normal entertainments of a successful man, have bored me to the
limits of endurance. I am convinced they are beginning to bore
multitudes of people.</p>

<p>You can see the still almost inadvertent conflict of the new and
old in the vague, copious, inattentive newspapers of to-day. Here,
ignorantly set out indeed but still arresting, is the intimation of
some new discovery, some mechanical achievement, the martyrdom of a
man of science, a vivid statistical realisation. Side by side is
some dull picture of a row of politicians, the latest cabinet of
Briand for example, or a still duller display of royalties in
wedding dress or highland costume, doing nothing in particular.
Most significant of all are the photographs of some huge dock or
novel engineering structure, a towering display of mechanical
achievement, and President This or Prince That solemnly "opening"
it, doing his poor level best to look as though he was in some
remote way responsible for it and not indeed a fetish as casual and
irrational as a black cat put upon a first-night stage.</p>

<p>But though mental preparation for the revolution is fundamental
it is after all only preparatory. While that preparatory process
still gathers force, there are already, and more and more there
will be, a series of issues breaking out between the new ideas and
the old. These must be the second series of activities of the Open
Conspiracy. An enormous quantity of power is already in the hands
of the new sort of men, and every day their proportion of power in
the world increases. It is only now that the men of finance and
industry are coming together freely and talking plainly, that we
begin to realise how much of the old order is already existing
merely on our sufferance. It is within the power of the bankers of
the world now to forbid the growth or even the maintenance of
armaments. They can forbid the building of battleships and insist
upon education. They can turn expenditure from unproductive to
productive channels. If they do not do so it is because they are
disunited and unaware or unsure of their power.</p>

<p>And this is even more true of the big industrial organisations.
If the Romer, Steinhart group of firms and their allies throughout
the world decided now to restrict the supply of certain products
and munitions to any particular power, or any particular body of
persons, that power, that body would be given an overwhelming
military advantage. No soldier in existence can stand against the
general will of the chemists and metallurgists of the earth. He is,
from his under-exercised brain to his over-decorated buttons,
antiquated and altogether ineffective without our help. If he get
the usurer and credit manipulator upon his side, he is still
incapable of producing the weapons he now requires without our
assent. Sooner or later people like Dickon will throttle the
soldiers' publicity and tie the hands of the credit
manipulator.</p>

<p>As the story of the Tanks and a score of kindred experiences
make plain, the generals cannot devise nor even use novel apparatus
properly without unprofessional instruction. Indeed they cannot
understand them. Tanks, said Kitchener, the British War Lord, were
"mechanical toys." Professional soldiers love to "use" men instead
of mechanical toys. The men feel. The history of the war is one
long record of the bloodstained obstinate unteachableness of the
professional soldier. To the end of the struggle, with excellent
telpherage systems available, the British military authorities kept
thousands of live men in toil and torment and danger, bearing
burthens along the communication trenches. The men panted and were
exhausted, many fell and were drowned in mud, but the alternative
would have been for the military gentlemen to think out the use of
telpherage systems. That was an impossible alternative. Slowly,
slowly, at a great price of lives, they did indeed learn a little
about gas, about modern transport, about the use of aeroplanes. But
to the last they choked their lines with cavalry and great stores
of fodder, and to this day they clink about in spurs. There was no
military conclusion to the war&mdash;it was a moral collapse.</p>

<p>The general's elder brother the Admiral is no better stuff. A
generation ago we took away his sails and wooden walls and put
engines in him and wrapped him up in steel plates, in spite of his
utmost resistance, and now to-day he still clings to his
battleships&mdash;and will, until we send him and his gold lace
sky-high in one. No one has ever yet written our private thoughts
about the exploits of the British Navy in the Great War. There were
some cries from Admiral Fisher, but he died. At Jutland the guns,
range-finders, submarines, torpedoes, and aeroplanes of this huge
spending department, were all behind the times. But to this day the
Admiral lords it amidst this machinery that has outgrown him. In
spite of the protests of Weir, Parsons, Thornycroft, and our own
people, the naval engineer remains a civilian officer under these
splendid militants in blue and gold lace. It is the current state
of affairs in one vivid instance. And&mdash;is it
wonderful?&mdash;there is a dearth of able naval engineers.</p>

<p>In 1914 the financiers and industrial leaders were taken by
surprise and the gentlemen in uniform got loose. It is our fault,
our want of vision, if ever again they get loose on that scale. It
becomes increasingly unnecessary every year that they should get
loose at all on any scale or that we should bear the burden and
incur the dangers of their continued existence. The struggle of the
financiers and business men of the world to tie up the professional
soldiers of the European states again after the war, and to impede
and mitigate nationalist extravagances, though it has been
instinctive rather than deliberate, has been an extraordinarily
interesting one. Scattered and unorganised though we still are,
things have on the whole gone our way. As I write they are signing
the Treaty of Locarno in London. This is bad news for the dealers
in national flags. And the Compagnie Internationale des
Wagons-Lits, stimulated by this triumph of cosmopolitan business
interests over the dreams of national revenge and readjustment, is,
I learn from to-day's <i>Petit Niçois</i>, building a new type of
blue sleeping-carriage that will soon be traversing all the main
lines of the continent from Calais and Cadiz to Moscow and
Constantinople.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-4" name="b5-4"></a>§ 4. THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD</h2>

<p class="first">AS the new order struggles to assure itself
against a repetition of the disaster of 1914 and is forced towards
self-realisation in the effort, its peculiar characteristics become
plainer. The world republic is going to be as different from any
former state as, let us say, an automobile from a peasant's cart.
Its horse-power will be in its body. There need be no visible
animal, no emperor nor president at all; and no parliament of
mankind.</p>

<p>It is an anthropomorphic delusion that a state must have a head.
A world republic needs a head no more than a brain needs a central
master neuron. A brain thinks as a whole. And as for Assemblies and
Councils, why should people meet to talk nowadays&mdash;especially
to talk different languages&mdash;when they can exchange ideas far
more effectively without doing so? Writing and print have been
tested now for centuries; they are quite trustworthy contrivances.
They admit of pithy and precise statement and exact translation.
Why overwork the human throat? Polyglot debates are a delusion, a.
horror of empty noises and gesticulation.</p>

<p>The boredom of these sham discussions! In which no one ever
answers anyone, in which sudden interventions are impossible!
Twice, at Washington and Geneva, I have sat out multi-lingual
debates, and God save me from any more of them! As the interpreter,
a Dutchman with an extraordinary quickness and aptitude for the
task, rose to perform his incredible feat of promptitude, to say at
once all over again, within measure, what had just been said, an
audible groan passed like a breeze through the gathering. His voice
rose and fell imitatively, his arms swayed out in alien gestures,
as he tried to reproduce the actual speaker. Sometimes there were
three versions, when the speaker used neither French nor English.
With a further displacement of gesture and stress and precision. A
few rare prigs in the galleries followed the paraphrases and noted
differences and defects with an intelligent interest. The rest of
the audience marvelled at the interpreter's gifts and creaked and
whispered and suffered. After the interlude of translation,
proceedings mumbled forward for awhile and then halted again.</p>

<p>These things mock reality. The decisions of importance to
mankind grow silently and deliberately in the minds of those best
placed to make them, and are no longer to be arrived at&mdash;or
upset&mdash;by dramatic scenes and feats of eloquence in senates
and assemblies.</p>

<p>In the world republic we shall need rather parlours for informal
conferences than parliament houses for stirring debates, and great
libraries of current statistics, competent digests of complicated
facts, and a concentration of administrative headquarters
convenient for intimate talks and settlements. These facilities
need not be all in one place. There need be no World Capital. The
swifter and safer air-travel and the easier the transmission of
speech and diagrams become, the less is a capital city necessary.
Men can do their business now without swarming like bees. Even now
you could steal and hide Washington away for weeks and, if the
newspapers made no fuss, the average citizen of the United States
would be unaware of his loss.</p>

<p>A modern government of the world should never be in session and
always in action. Men of importance would come and go, as the
Caesars did, where and when occasion required. The main structure,
the constitution, the directorates if you will, of the great
republic, may be in active existence long before it is clearly
perceived and described as such.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-5" name="b5-5"></a>§ 5. GENEVA</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE already told something of my flying visit
to Geneva the summer before last, but I have told of it so far as
an aspect of an emotional state and laid stress only on the
overcast mind I brought to bear on it. I wanted to give my own
experiences of motive, my conflict of desires, a conflict to which
I will presently return. But I perceived and heard more at Geneva
than I was aware of at the time.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Assembly, as I have confessed,
disappointed and bored me. I was prepared to be bored and
disappointed. I had never been in love with this idea of a world
league with a written constitution and two chambers and fittings
complete that came over to us from America. It did not come to us
from the practical intelligence of America, nor had it, at first,
any great support among big business men; it was engendered by
professors, very pedantic professors. Their minds were strictly
legal, and they were too self-sufficient to consider any criticism
that came from a non-legal standpoint. Wilson was a law professor
quintessentially, an American law professor with historical
perspectives that hardly went back beyond the War of Independence.
He had no mental nor moral humility, and he lacked any proper pride
in the greatness of his opportunity. The queer parliament of
nations he created, based upon obsolescent ideas about sovereignty,
was unattractive from the outset. Everybody in council and assembly
alike was there as a national partisan. Nobody represented mankind.
Sooner or later Geneva was bound to become an arena for disputes
between nations, with a sounding-board to carry the passionate
notes of these disputes to the ends of the earth. The civil war
that nearly tore up the American republic was brought about by a
dispute about the representation of states in congress and the
efforts of one faction to secure an advantage over the other. The
League of Nations seems constructed to engender a parallel quarrel.
Its Council and Assembly are still a greater danger to the peace of
Europe even than Italy.</p>

<p>Yet there are certain possibilities of cosmopolitanism at Geneva
that I did not at first foresee, and things are germinating there
that may grow and flourish as instruments of the world-republic
long after Council and Assembly have been wrecked, abolished or
reconstructed out of recognition and any power of mischief.</p>

<p>I have mentioned my conversation with Mansard one sunny morning
while we lunched at a lake-side restaurant, and how my attention
wandered from what he was saying. Mansard was one of a little group
of men who set themselves to explain Geneva to such curious
visitors as he supposed me to be. A lot that Mansard had to tell me
I hardly heard at the time, and yet I must have heard it, because
afterwards I found it in my brain. His estimate of the Assembly and
the Council was not much higher than mine, but what he was driving
at all the time was the possibility afforded by the League of
developing an international secretariat for a great series of world
functions. He was insistent upon the possible importance of Albert
Thomas' Labour Bureau, its independent importance. He said that the
various officials came from their countries to Geneva in a national
or at best an international spirit, that the first effect of the
place upon them was often to stimulate comparisons between nation
and nation and exacerbate their patriotism, but that presently
their interest in their work almost imperceptibly
"cosmopolitanised" them. There was a real cosmopolitan <i>esprit de
corps</i> arising in Geneva.</p>

<p>That was Mansard's besetting theme; the growth which he
professed to detect of a cosmopolitan mentality, an "international
mind," he called it, among the permanent officials in Geneva. When
you gave him your ear and encouraged him, this germinating seed
would grow with extraordinary rapidity into a plant, that spread
and branched until it overshadowed the world. He quoted Sir Mark
Sykes, who had been advocating a League of Nations militia when he
died in Paris in 1919, for the sake of just the same end, a
cosmopolitan <i>esprit de corps</i>. Mansard would quote the church
in the Middle Ages, its religious fraternities and orders, and
particularly the Knights Templars as instances of a successful
cosmopolitan loyalty in the past. His imagination would go on to a
dream of the British Navy, detached from its parent stem,
developing an autonomy of its own, and becoming the sea police for
all mankind.</p>

<p>"And how can you run air routes except as a world service with a
cosmopolitan <i>esprit de corps</i>?" asked Mansard.</p>

<p>So Mansard. I quote him because he strengthens me "here, but I
will not even comment on his ideas.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-6" name="b5-6"></a>§ 6. DAVID LUBIN</h2>

<p class="first">IF ever the history of this great revolution in
human affairs that may now be in progress should come to be
written, there must be at least a vignette of that prophetic
American Jew, David Lubin. He was a precursor, a figure rather like
Roger Bacon in his unappreciated anticipations. He left a very
sharp impression upon my mind. We dined together twice and
exchanged several letters. My last letter from him is dated
October, 1918.</p>

<p>I met Lubin by chance in the boat train from Dover to London,
some three or four years before the war. He was dying to talk to
some one and I was the only other occupant of his compartment. He
was indignant at some incident of the Customs examination. I think
they had scrutinised some French books he was bringing with him.
They had, he thought, betrayed a suspicion that he&mdash;he of all
people! David! King David Lubin!&mdash;would import improper
books.</p>

<p>I was quite prepared to sympathise with him. I hate Custom
houses as I hate kings, as salient reminders of the foolish
barriers that cut up the comity of mankind. Encouraged by my
sympathy he opened himself out to me. That was altogether his
spirit, he agreed. But he explained that so far as he was concerned
he had done tremendous things to bring these separations to an end.
He had a flamboyant, overwhelming manner and an exaggerated style
of exposition; he was obviously extremely vain, and at the time I
gave what he had to say a very measured amount of belief.</p>

<p>He was already an oldish man then; he had the burning eye and
the gestures and intonations of a major prophet; I can imagine a
certain resemblance to the great Mr. Gladstone, the other "Mr. G."
of my childhood. What he had to say was mixed up with the most
remarkable theories about Israel and the world; he was a Jew,
intensely race-conscious, Bible-fed, Hebrew-speaking, born in
Poland and brought up amidst the excited sentimental and democratic
enterprise of developing western America. He had, he told me,
started work with some cheap jewellers in Massachusetts at the age
of twelve, first as a polisher of scarf-pin&mdash;she had got into
trouble by polishing too hard and getting all the gilt off when he
began&mdash;and then as a maker of blue goggles which the firm
contracted to supply Sherman's army. He had gone west at sixteen,
he had travelled in oil-lamps, prospected for gold, packed lumber
and launched the first "one-price" store in Sacramento City. "One
price" meant in this case fixed prices; it was not a one-price
store like Woolworth's in London. That "one-price" store had been
the foundation of a substantial fortune. "David Lubin," he said
with a sort of shout, <i>"one price,"</i> and pawed towards me with
his hand. He had slept under the counter of his store in a bunk of
his own making. He had known thirst and hunger. In ten years he had
the largest Department Store and Mail Order House on the Pacific
Coast. But also he had been lost for two days in the desert during
his time as a prospector, and the sense of God, that Desert God of
Israel, had overwhelmed him. So he did not "eat pork," like so many
successful Jews, when wealth came upon him.</p>

<p>"Not for <i>me</i>, your monocle, your girl with the yellow
hair!" He took his old mother, who had taught him to sing Hebrew
songs and read Maimonides, on a pilgrimage to Palestine. He was
giving all his life now, subject to such attention as the Mail
Order House still required, to the God of Israel and the service of
mankind. After the success of his store, had come experimental
farming to restore the simplicity of his soul, and then great
economic discoveries and his Mission. Throughout our conversation
it never dawned upon him that I too might have had something of a
fight with the world, or any idea of a function towards mankind at
large. He talked to me as if I must be a perfectly stable
Englishman, as if I had been exactly what I was for centuries at
least, as though no one ever rose or fell in Europe or felt the
call to service there, so that the Transatlantic marvel of a man
working his way up from small things to considerable wealth was
bound in itself to fill me with amazement and admiration. It did
nothing of the sort. But it interested me acutely just then to hear
his interpretation of his Mission.</p>

<p>My first impression was that he had used it to treat himself to
an eccentric tour of the heads of all the governments of Europe. He
said he had just been talking to the Grand Vizier in
Constantinople; that he was corresponding with the Queen of
Roumania; that he had called on the King of Italy on his way back;
that he had been in communication with Stolypin, who was at that
time the Tzar's Imperial Chancellor, and visiting the home of the
Russian Minister of Finance in Finland. He added that he had made
treaties on his own behalf with more than forty separate
governments&mdash;I forget the exact number which at the time I
supposed to be either some fantastic metaphor or a downright
lie.</p>

<p>Yet it was not a lie. It was literally true. This
crazy-mannered, posturing, one-price merchant had a real Mission,
and was doing a work of the utmost significance. He was, upon one
side of him at least, a very great man. He had enlarged his
experiences as a successful mail-order merchant and an unsuccessful
Californian fruit shipper, until they embraced the economic life of
mankind. His inner vanity was not blinding him in the least to the
broad realities of human economics. Within him there was a life of
almost childish fantasy; he seemed to find a Messianic significance
in the fact that he had been christened David the King and not
Pinchus after his grandfather, because his face had been burnt by a
candle flame when he was four days old and an old Rabbi had
foretold a great destiny for him to comfort his mother; he
identified himself with a mystical immortal Israel that was linking
all the nations. Isaiah was his dialect. By Israel's scars the
nations should be healed. But directly he turned his face outward
he was the western prospector, farmer, and trader, and his eye was
clear and keen.</p>

<p>The International Institute of Agriculture which his
persistence, emphasis, and audacity had already called into being
by 1905, and which was now seated firmly in a building of its own
in the grounds of the Villa Borghese, embodied a vision of one
worldwide human community leading a righteous, productive, and
happy economic life. It quite justified all he claimed for it and
for himself. He had gone to Rome, thrust himself amazingly into the
royal shooting-box at San Rossire and prophesied to the young King
of Italy, extraordinarily after the fashion of some prophet in
goatskin from the desert standing before a king of Israel or Judah;
and the king had built this institute for him and had given him
facilities that had opened doors to him in Washington and every
country in Europe. He appeared as if from nowhere, prophesying and
not so much organising as provoking organisation. He played off
America against Europe and Europe against America in the astutest
fashion, while he brought this Institute into being. He had
projected the thing (American fashion) as a sort of economic
parliament with an upper and lower house&mdash;what a curse to the
human imagination the British and American Constitutions have
been!&mdash;and I rather guess that his last years were
overshadowed by the fact that there was hardly any recognition that
it was he who had invented the "Original League of Nations"; but
the reality he had begotten, as he expounded it to me, was
something much more modern, practicable, and far-reaching than any
League of Nations. It was not organised talk but assembled
knowledge he had evoked.</p>

<p>The International Institute of Agriculture, to begin with, was a
census of world production. It was sustained by subsidies from
fifty-two governments, each subscribing to an identical treaty, and
it was administered by a permanent committee of representatives of
the sustaining nations. It kept a record of the state of the crops
and the general agricultural outlook throughout the world, based on
telegraphic reports from the boards of agriculture of its
constituent countries. Week by week and month by month production
was recorded, so that the destinations of all the prospective
supplies could be adjusted to the probable demands. In addition the
Institute had developed departments dealing with the world
prevention of plant diseases and with meteorology and agricultural
legislation. That much existed.</p>

<p>But Lubin was quite clear and resolute that matters could not
stop at that. As this fabric of economic intelligence was built up,
there would arise the plain necessity of a world revision of
transport conditions. On that second step he was working when I
knew him and up to the time of his death. The current interstate
and international transport of commodities was, he recognised,
altogether too haphazard and speculative for world welfare. Given a
centralised control, an all-seeing eye, a regulated system of
warnings, it could be made as clear and as definite as a mail-order
business. And moreover, he argued, agriculture was not the whole
substance of economic interests; the methods of the Institute once
they were established could be applied with suitable adaptations to
the other main staples of human consumption, to coal, to oil, to
steel and other metals. So this mail-order prophet from Sacramento
reached out until he touched hands with Romer, Steinhart, Crest and
Co. Instead of the dark, crowded, unco-ordinated adventurousness of
contemporary business, we could, he maintained, following along the
lines of his Institute, substitute an illuminated, orderly,
worldwide merchandising. I told him Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co.
would be quite willing to subsidise his Institute whenever the
Kings and Viziers failed him.</p>

<p>The storm of the great war submerged Lubin's internationalism.
There was a dismally sentimental little dinner in August, 1914,
when the French, German, Austrian, and Belgian members of the staff
drank together to the world peace of the future, talked of their
immediate duty, and dispersed in a state of solemn perplexity to
their several belligerent countries. It was the beginning of the
end of that chapter in the history of internationalism. Presently
Italy was swept into the war, and what was left of the
Institute&mdash;staffed now by women and by the mutilated and the
unfit&mdash;devoted itself to the problems of the allied food
supply.</p>

<p>Since the war I have heard little of it. It has passed into
obscurity in the shadows about the eclipsed king. Lubin died in the
influenza epidemic at the end of 1918 before he could think out the
war at a sufficient distance to get clear of the combatant note; he
had been altogether pro-ally, and when he died, the hand of the
Lord God of Israel was still heavy against Germany in all he said
and did. F or some time, I think, Lubin had been ailing and losing
his grip upon things. The war posed a multitude of troublesome
riddles to him, and it was not always easy for his undisciplined
mind to find where Isaiah had hidden the answer. Almost his last
effort was to commend his Institute to those who were concerned
with the prospective League of Nations. His last letter to me was
about that.</p>

<p>He was buried at Rome early in January, 1919, and his funeral
passed disregarded through streets that were beflagged and
decorated to welcome the visit of President Wilson.</p>

<p>Wilson ignored him and his Institute and his suggestions.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-7" name="b5-7"></a>§ 7. ASSEMBLING THE
CONSPIRACY</h2>

<p class="first">I WILL return now to something I have already used
once as a point of departure. It is that I am projecting, not
foretelling. All this estimate of creative forces here is
speculative; the revolution I write about is not assured. For all I
know it may be inevitable, it may be in the very nature of things;
I have no evidence for or against that view. But I am convinced
that it will remain only a possible thing, an unsubstantial
appearance, until it is embodied in a wilful understanding among
the people who can carry it out.</p>

<p>I write of the increasing power of the financiers and the big
industrials, to control human affairs, to prohibit wars,
consolidate international production and distribution, restrain and
direct governments, dictate policies; they are the great Barons for
a World Witenagemot, but at present their power is either partial
or unconscious in its use, or merely a potential power. It does not
follow they will ever use that power systematically or use it for
great ends. The metamorphosis has gone so far I think that one can
distinguish the broad lines of the new social Leviathan, the world
republic; but it sleeps still, it does not move, it has not yet
awakened to its possible existence. The assembling of this "Open
Conspiracy" is still a thing for the future.</p>

<p>The fact that I am writing my own mind clear about these things
down here in this tranquillity among the olive trees is evidence
enough that what I am propounding concerns a merely incipient
reality. The substance of the preceding book is mainly the history
of how I and Dickon came to these still developing ideas. But my
case is that we are not abnormal men but samples of ordinary
Successful modern men, and that what we are thinking a lot of other
similar and similarly circumstanced people must be thinking also,
with individual differences but on the same general lines. I have
come away here to Provence and made myself a sort of hermit for the
better half of the year, in order to get on with this complex
readjustment of my vision. It has been and still is for me a task
more important and urgent than any concrete business
operations.</p>

<p>To some extent I may be exceptional in this direct transfer of
my attention to the general problem. No one else among active
business men so far as I know has come away like this for an
exhaustive consideration of the general position of business. Such
moods and disappointments as have rendered it not only an easy but
an almost necessary thing for me to concentrate on these questions,
may not have chanced as yet to anyone else. Accident may have made
me a sort of pioneer in expressing these views.</p>

<p>But Dickon, though he has not come away and is much too busy, I
think, ever to come away, has developed quite similar views. He
however has made no such attempt to crystallise them out. They come
and go in his mind. His must be the more usual state of affairs.
Such a pause for self-expression, such a realisation of the need
for statement and a clearing up of the outlook has not yet come to
the world of great business as a whole. I think it is nearly due.
The new order is still mute; I chant my saga of the future without
accompaniment; the politicians and political personages,
journalists, religious teachers and schoolmasters who supply
together the ordinary forms of political thought in use, repeat
nothing but the accepted formulae of the passing state of affairs.
But the phase of self-realisation and <i>self-expression</i> may be
close at hand. It may come very fast when once it begins to
come.</p>

<p>There are, I grant, few signs of its coming. As yet we think by
ourselves alone as I am doing, or we talk only by twos and threes
as I shall do when I return to England. We have still to talk by
groups and then in books and organs of our own. Clearly while this
mental fragmentation continues the world of contemporary expansions
will be deprived of the larger part of its sustaining power, and
the old order will <i>still</i> be in a position to hold on and
recover its losses to us. A time comes when every social process
must become conscious of itself. No great creative development can
go on in modern social life beyond a certain point without a
literature of explanation and criticism. We talk, I say, by no more
than twos and threes. Almost all the talkers are men. Few if any of
the womenkind of men of affairs seem to share these ideas that the
practical handling of power is evoking. Nor do we make any
<i>éclaircissement</i> with our business partners; we educate no
successors. We hand on our impressions and vague intentions only by
the most fragmentary hints and suggestions to our sons. Our homes,
our families, our social life, are still quite submerged in
traditional ideas. We work submerged.</p>

<p>This is a state of affairs that is necessarily transitory. The
men who have been the means of developing the large scale methods
thus far, the men of science, the inventors, the men of imaginative
business enterprise, the men of financial understanding, cannot
leave human affairs in this present crisis of discordance between
world wide achievement and nationalist outlook to which they have
brought them.</p>

<p>But they cannot go on to the subtle and enormous tasks of
intellectual and moral adjustment that are required of them without
a consolidation of their own still largely scattered activities,
and the support of a widening confidence and participation in what
they are doing. They have to bring not only the world of science
but the world of literary activities and their own womenkind and
families into understanding relationship with themselves. They have
to produce a social life of their own that will sustain and ensure
the continuance of their work and be harmonious with that work.
They have to evoke a literature and an education that will record
and continue and spread their awakening creative spirit. They have
to bring that spirit out of their laboratories and works and
offices and country houses into all the concerns of mankind.</p>

<p>I do not know if they can do that, but I do know that if they do
not do it, a long period of violent stresses and probably of
degenerative disorder lies before mankind. The old order of things
such as it was can never recover its former confident stability; it
has been sprung like a worn-out tennis racket; it has lost its
moral ascendency over men's minds even if it has kept its grip on
their affairs. But the new scale world can achieve itself only
under onerous conditions. Economic revolution trails with it every
other sort of revolution. It involves a new way of living, new
habits, new relations between the sexes, an artistic and literary
renaissance, a new handling of the methods of publicity, an
educational revolution. And it is only people of our type and
freedoms who can have the knowledge and experience to plan, and the
courage, ability, and worldwide advantages to achieve, so great a
reorientation of human attention and effort.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-8" name="b5-8"></a>§ 8. A NEW SOCIAL ROUTINE</h2>

<p class="first">A NEW social life must necessarily develop step by
step with the progress of the world republic. It will be
aristocratic in the sense that it will have a decisive stratum of
prominent and leading individuals who will wield a relatively large
part of the power and property of the community, but it will be
democratic in the sense that it will be open to everyone with
ability and energy to join that stratum and participate in its work
to the extent of his or her ability and energy. It will have
routines of its own, and they will be widely different from the
routines of the present time.</p>

<p>The social routines of the present are determined largely by the
assembling of a government and the existence of a court. Society
gathers at some sort of capital and entertains and is entertained.
There are routs, parties, pageants, and theatrical displays. Then
it disperses to carry on the traditional motions of the conquering
nomads from whom most old-world governments derive, to hunt, shoot,
frequent the open air. There is no need to hunt or shoot now; the
hunting is a public nuisance and the shooting a massacre of tamed
birds, but still the thing goes on. At convenient times society
races, bets upon, and trades its now rather obsolete horses. Its
costume, its language, is gravely equestrian.</p>

<p>This seasonal coming to town and return to the country that was
once necessary to powerful people in the past, has undergone great
elaborations and modifications as these powerful people have become
more and more a creditor community no longer in direct contact with
realities. All the procedure has become more formal and more
trivial.</p>

<p>Games have become displays and functions rather than general
exercises. I have told already of the disillusionment of Dickon and
myself as we clambered up from the struggle for freedom and power
and realised the nature of the feast, the feast of honours and
satisfactions, at present spread for success.</p>

<p>The new social life will be the life of people in close and
keenly interested contact with the realities of economic,
directive, and administrative affairs. They will have no time for
systematic attendance at courts, parliaments, race meetings, and
the like; they will find much better fun in the work they are
doing. And there will be no capital, no court, no parliament, and
no race meetings. I doubt if these adults will have any use for
mass assemblies.</p>

<p>The present disposition of people to assemble in monstrous
crowds, the great Epsom festival of Derby Day for example, is a
very curious and probably a now passing phase in the human
development. The crowds seem urged to gather by an immemorial
habit, but they do not seem to be very happy or busy when they have
gathered. They stare about. In India immense congestions of a
religious sort occur. In the past there were great fairs and
pilgrimages; Mecca is still a pious Epsom. There appear to have
been such assemblings at Avebury and at Stonehenge, with races and
sacrifices. Solutre, to judge from the vast accumulations of picked
horse bones, was an annual camp and fair for the horse hunters of
the Palaeolithic period many thousands of years earlier. This
custom of seasonal assemblies goes back therefore to the early
beginnings of social life. It was dictated first perhaps by the
habits of the grazing animals to scatter when the food is scarce
and the calves or fawns are young, and to reconstitute the herd at
the breeding time. Man the hunter followed the herd, and learnt to
assemble as the herd did.</p>

<p>All need for these swarmings has evaporated now with increased
freedom of individual movement. They are survivals. All the world
is a meeting place for the new type of man. An uncrowded meeting
place. All the world is our court and our temple, our capital and
our fair.</p>

<p>This disappearance of a "social round" from the lives of the
more modern types of people does not mean a decline in
sociability&mdash;but an intensification. Just as a king or a
president becomes ridiculous now as a symbol of the will and
purpose of mankind, so jostling innumerable people, roaring in
unison with them, cheering some regal mannequin, promenading in our
best clothes and eating by the hundred, fails to satisfy our
deepening sense of intercourse and co-operation.</p>

<p>We want to get at other individuals closely and effectively. We
want to develop resemblances and understand differences. For that
purpose social life needs to be a series of small duologues and
group meetings. Its encounters cannot be very definitely arranged.
Staying together in a well-managed country house for a few days'
holiday, joint membership of a club, meeting frequently to lunch or
dine, taking exercise or sitting in the sun together, working in
proximity or co-operation, going on an expedition for a week or so,
sharing a walking tour, a day or so in a yacht or the like, these
are surely the best forms of personal contact. What more does one
want? All the other social things are mere occasions for mass
excitement. And when we come to contacts of personality, the actual
encounter is often the least part of the relationship.</p>

<p>I am reminded of Heine's visit to Goethe and how the chief
blossom of that long anticipated encounter was a remark upon the
excellence of the fruit trees by the wayside. Our realest
intimacies are often with people we have never seen.</p>

<p>Writing often affords a closer encounter of minds than a
personal meeting. After all I am living here in this <i>mas</i> up
a byway in Provence, not because I want to get away from people but
because I want to get more effectively at them. I have so much to
say, and the saying of it needs such careful preparation, that it
is absurd to think of saying it by word of mouth. I want to say it
when the people to whom it appeals are ready to hear me. I want to
lie ready for the mood of attention, and as a book on a table or
even as a book on a shelf I am sure at least that I shall not be
met in a phase of defensive disregard. At a set and dated meeting,
especially if it lasts only an hour or so, anything may happen.</p>

<p>I once met J. M. Keynes at a lunch party. I rather think I had
asked to meet him. I had and have a great admiration for him. It is
the only time I have ever encountered this idol of my brother
Dickon. I could have imagined all sorts of topics we might have
discussed together, but as a matter of fact all we did on that
occasion was to fall foul of each other rather sharply about a book
called <i>The Mongol in Our Midst</i> and the way in which a
gorilla sits down. Neither of us really cared very much about the
way a gorilla sits down, but we both chanced to be wickedly
argumentative that day. We scored off each other, and that is all
that passed between us.</p>

<p>Yet Keynes has affected both Dickon's ideas and mine profoundly,
and I shall be disappointed if this stuff I am writing here among
the olives does not reach him at least in Cambridge&mdash;with my
friendly greeting.</p>

<p>A life of active work that continues to the end, a life in which
everyone goes apart at times to think and write things out in order
to communicate them better, a social life of meetings by twos and
threes and fours, a social life that has no use for crowds and for
crushes and for mere passing salutations, a social life where men
speak to one another by books or by pamphlets more effectively than
by speech, in which there are no debates, no public decisions by
means of oratory and voting, will necessarily produce its own forms
of house and garden; its own apparatus of intercourse. One needs a
place or places to work in, and that accommodation must vary
enormously with the nature of one's work. It may call for indices,
libraries, laboratories, secretaries; assistants, colleagues,
summaries may need to be readily accessible. And away from the
working place, but not too far away, one wants to dine and rest in
some unexacting beautiful apartment, a flat in a retired quarter,
rooms in a riverside inn or the like, some corner of freshness,
light and quiet. And then one wants a break in one's work, the sort
of break people now call a "week-end," and for that is indicated
the pleasant country house, with good company and tennis, or
racquets or lawn tennis or swimming or good walking. Or this
<i>mas</i> here. And further one needs the occasional refreshment
of going abroad to a different climate and of encountering a
different fashion in all the incidentals of life.</p>

<p>I say "week-end," but I will confess I wish the ancient people
who invented the week had invented it longer and larger and with
more than one day of rest at the end of it. Six days' work and then
one day off may have been all very well for the peasants of ancient
Babylonia or among the vines and fig trees of Palestine, but I find
it one of the tightest misfits of the modern world. The English
"week-end" lasts from Saturday afternoon until Monday at lunchtime,
and leaves four days and two half-days for getting things done. One
is always knocking off too soon. I could do most of the things I
have to do in England far better in spells of from six to eight
days of steady work to be followed by three or four days of play,
gossip, laughter, and rest. But people treat this Neolithic week as
though it was an astronomical necessity, like day and night. For
one person who will be shocked by my republicanism, a score will
cry impossible at a ten or twelve day week, with a three or four
day Sabbath to it.</p>

<p>Here in Provence Clem and I can practise it, and it succeeds
wonderfully. I can call up a little automobile I now keep in Grasse
for our Sabbath, and we can go anywhere within a hundred and fifty
miles, to the sea, North Italy, Avignon, Nîmes, Grenoble, or just
down to Nice or Marseilles for an urban day or so. I believe a
longer week would suit almost everyone in a modern community better
than the Babylonian legacy.</p>

<p>The freedom to get away that a longer week would give the
ordinary worker would revolutionise the everyday life of labour.
His present Sabbath is merely a pause in his toil; it is neither a
rest nor a change. Before anything can happen it is over. The
ordinary wages-worker comes back on Monday morning less disposed
for work than when he left it on Saturday. He wasn't worked out
when he left, and he isn't refreshed when he returns.</p>

<p>Some day perhaps the world will keep such an enlarged week. This
change in the timing of life to a longer, slower rhythm, this
relinquishment of mass gatherings and periodic and formal social
functions, this intensification of personal encounters, this
expansion of interest to worldwide activities, this resort not only
to reading but to writing and publication as a normal part of one's
social existence, must be necessary aspects of the development of a
new adult stage in human experience. The new sort of people can no
more submit to the social routines, the time apportionments, the
etiquette of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, than they can
keep an automobile in order with tools of wood and flint.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-9" name="b5-9"></a>§ 9. HEIRS AT A DISCOUNT</h2>

<p class="first">THIS new way of living demands not only different
rhythms and routines, it demands also a changed spirit of conduct
for women, differing from any that prevails at the present time.
How far women will come with us and how far they will let us go is
a question I must tackle in a separate book of its own. But here I
will venture to say that family life will be less the habitual mode
than we now pretend it is.</p>

<p>It is a venerated assumption among lawyers and suchlike
preservers of antique psychology, that men work and organise great
industries in order to "found families." I cannot imagine how
anyone with the most rudimentary powers of observation can repeat
so foolish a statement. I doubt if any big business man or any big
financial man for the last hundred years has done what he did for
the sake of his family. Far more was it for the sake of business.
In former times of insecurity one may have looked to one's sons and
connexions by marriage to hold together the estate one had created,
but even then I believe the care was mainly for the estate. And
nowadays, though sons or nephews may often prove congenial junior
partners, a really vigorous business man is much more likely to
care for a capable stranger than for a disintegrative son. The
later Caesars did. They were constantly adopting
colleague-successors. The most disastrous of the Caesars were the
ones who were born to the purple. And look at the families cc
founded" by the earlier American millionaires!</p>

<p>No energetic directive people are deeply in love with
inheritance; it loads the world with incompetent shareholders and
wasteful spenders; it chokes the ways with their slow and aimless
lives; it is a fatty degeneration of property. If Romer, Steinhart,
Crest and Co. could avoid carrying Lady Steinhart and the Crests on
our backs we should all rejoice. Our only reason for resisting the
heaviest possible death duties is that the alternative to our
present load of heirs would probably be the active interference of
some rascal appointed by political intrigue to look after the
growing share of the old-style State in our concerns. Rather Crest,
rather a score of Crests, than one of Lloyd George's convenient
friends. Rather Lady Steinhart's possessive bad manners, her fences
and her <i>pièges à loup</i> for a mile or so and another
generation or so, than a network of tiresome unintelligent
restrictions over the better part of the world.</p>

<p>In course of time these great business systems as they become
the ostensible as well as the real government of the world may
evolve some method of voluntary dispossession. We may for example
return our individual shares of the capital into the business and
become annuitants after sixty-five. Or we may devise ingenious
Trusts that will save our work alike from the paralysis of the
politician, from the weight of a layer of rich widows, and from the
ravages of the heir. We may make the personal share smaller while
retaining the power to wield large masses of property so long as
one is on the active directorate.</p>

<p>Few of us realise how rapidly family life, home life in a little
group of parents and young, fades out of modern existence. Royalty
makes an immense parade of its family life because that is its
<i>métier;</i> but a great majority of the more influential people
in the world, though they keep quarters here and there, no longer
centre upon a home. Lambs Court is a sort of home for the
Clissolds, but now only servants inhabit that place continually;
Dickon who for a modern man of enterprise was exceptionally
domestic, hardly ever goes there now; for nearly half his life he
has been as homeless as I have for nearly all of mine. Family seats
are traditional things, and they may be pleasant things to sojourn
in for a few happy years, but they are no longer any more necessary
to human life than capital cities. Half the great country houses in
England are for sale to-day. Just as all the world may some day be
the seat of government, so the common safety and welfare may at
last dissolve the walls and seclusion of the family altogether.</p>

<p>I do not think that this reduction of cohabitation and this
diminution of inheritance in property involves a disregard of blood
relationships. A man may come to care all the more for his kin,
because he is less encumbered with them. A son who no longer
regards his father as a tyrant or a lock-up investment may come to
realise his value as a friend and as a kindred experiment in
living. The less perhaps the habit of proximity the more the magic
of consanguinity. Where there is a natural peculiar sympathy it
will out, in association and co-operation, and where there is not
there is no profit to parent or child or the world in a forced
succession. If the son becomes a competent director, well and good,
but we do not want him as an inert shareholder. Let the son justify
his sonship. Let the widows and feminine dependents be limited to
comfort and security, house and gear. A man who has been privileged
to direct great business has no right to encumber its controls or
impoverish its reserves with his domestic byproducts.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-10" name="b5-10"></a>§ 10. CIVILISATION BY
NEWSPAPER</h2>

<p class="first">THIS increasing, free-moving cosmopolitan society
of vigorous individuals, with its habits and methods spreading out
into larger and larger strata and sections of the human community,
will produce its own literature. It will live very much by and
through its literature. Literature will be a form of social
intercourse.</p>

<p>There will be much thinking and reading and writing in the next
phase, but it will not be delegated work. It will be a literature
of activity. It will not be a professional literature. A modern man
of affairs, like an Athenian gentleman or a Chinese gentleman, will
work out his own philosophy and make his own comments and records.
A few may specialise in expression, but I do not see that we need
continue the vicious practice of the Roman plutocrats and keep a
class of philosophers and men of letters to ease us of our
responsibility for these things,&mdash;and lose them at last in the
necessary pettinesses and pedantries of men without experience.</p>

<p>We shall need newspapers that will give us news simply and
plainly. We shall certainly have no use for the vast sheets of
advertisements set off with inaccurate news, quasi-amusing trash
and political frothings that now invade our homes every twenty-four
hours. The daily papers of educated people half a century ahead may
be a tenth of the size and ten times the price of these wildly
flapping caricatures of contemporary happenings.</p>

<p>I am not even sure that, so far as our own interests go, we want
them daily. It is the betting man and the stock exchange speculator
who follow the fluctuations of the day and hour, and if our sort of
people gets a real grip on the world there will be very little
betting and speculation. For most people the daily paper is a daily
disappointment&mdash;to which they are drawn by habit and against
which habit forbids them to rebel. I lie in bed here of a morning
with a mind at peace, inaccessible to any correspondence, and think
of the hundreds of millions of rustling sheets away in England that
are being opened with a sort of jaded eagerness for something
really wonderful. Recently our postman here has become erratic; he
brings the Paris papers, the London papers, sometimes at eleven,
sometimes at four, sometimes not at all. Americans over the hill
get them; to him one Anglo-Saxon seems as good as another. It
matters hardly at all. There are four packets unopened now on the
bench at my side. I may rip them open and glance through them
to-day or to-morrow.</p>

<p>The weeklies interest me much more. The new order may find a
weekly newspaper sufficient. In seven days things have had time to
shape themselves a little. Ten days would be still better. The best
of all newspapers, to my mind, is <i>Nature</i>. That tells you of
things that matter, and tells you adequately. The weekly
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> and the <i>Weekly Times</i> too are
good, but they would be better if they left out more of the
literary stuff and gave a fuller abstract of the news and more
articles of relevant information. I do not know enough of the
American press to say whether there is any periodical at all over
there, daily or weekly, which gives as competent a digest of the
general news as <i>Nature</i> does of scientific happenings.</p>

<p>I may seem perhaps a little too ample in this criticism of the
press. I may seem to some readers to be enlarging on a superficial
matter. But indeed it is not a superficial matter. The press
colours the general tenour of life now and makes the background of
all we do. If it is noisy, uninforming, inexact, we live just as
though we had to live in a house with all the windows open upon an
incessant railway station or an unending fair. The hurdy-gurdy of a
roundabout is an unimportant instrument of music in itself, but not
if it drives the workers in a great laboratory frantic and makes
their work impossible.</p>

<p>And it is not only as the background of our own lives that the
press is essential to our social life It is the medium of
relationship between the active directive people and the mass of
the population which, consciously or not, is in cooperation with
them. It is the only medium through which the bulk of the community
may ultimately be brought into conscious co-operation. But at
present it fails to possess that function. At present the great
distributing businesses which provide the financial basis on which
our newspapers rest and which dictate their tone are not
sufficiently self-conscious to see beyond mere circulation. The
newspapers tell of the lines and bargains offered by the
distributors to their customers, and what else the newspapers may
be doing with those customers does not seem to concern the
advertiser. So long as the advertisements are carried far and wide,
so long as there is no hostile discussion of the advertised
commodities and so long as no plainly subversive doctrines are
preached in the papers, the big distributors do not care what else
is or is not given to the public. They are still too new and too
untaught to maintain any conscious relations of policy and action
with the transport organisations of the world as a whole, with the
merchandising of staples in bulk and the general industrial
network, and they behave as though they had neither come out of a
past that was different nor as if they headed, as they surely do,
for equally great changes and developments in the near future.</p>

<p>The newspapers on that account are still quasi-independent of
the distributing trades. Because of the inadvertence and
inconsecutiveness of these latter. But that is a conditional and
transitory freedom of the press. It is diminishing rapidly.
Newspapers have nothing like the power they had in their hands
during their period of opportunity at the end of the war. I have
recorded my brother's lamentation of their blindness already. In
the long run newspapers may become merely instruments in the hands
of the retailers.</p>

<p>There is still a delusion which many business men share, that it
is the public that determines the pattern and sets the key of the
press for which it contributes its pennies. This is no more true of
the newspaper than it is of the theatre or the cinema. The role of
the public in these affairs is to endure. You can feed the public
anything you like in all these things, within the limits of its
endurance. It is helpless against you. Its only possible veto is to
die, riot <i>en masse</i>, be ostentatiously sick or abstain from
what you give it. Short of these extremes it must accept. It may
grumble but it must accept. Given competition it will prefer
whatever bores and repels it least, but its freedom of choice is
limited by the very great and growing limitation of competition.
Exceptionally great masses of capital are needed to start a paper
nowadays or to make any sort of big public show. The public may
wish for all sorts of things in its paper, but unless it carries
its wish to the effective point of refusing to take the paper
altogether unless it is satisfied it will not, of its own
initiative, get them. Nearly everyone has the newspaper habit; and
the newspaper proprietors can defy your individual objection so
long as they maintain a general understanding among themselves.</p>

<p>The only possible effective control of all these processes of
publicity, so that this shall be given and that withheld, is to be
found in the hands of the active proprietors and directors of the
great newspapers themselves, and in the advertisers who sustain
them. If these people choose to give the public well-written daily
or weekly papers, responsible and large-minded, the public will get
them, but it will get them in no other way.</p>

<p>The public does not make the newspaper nor the cinema, but on
the other hand the press and the cinemas do more and more make the
public. They provide the social background for an increasing
proportion of people, they determine the characteristics of the
modern social atmosphere as nothing else now does. The pulpit and
the home circle sink to relative insignificance. And if we men of
large material influence propose, as I am proposing here, to accept
our manifest responsibilities and reconstruct the world as we can
do, upon broader, finer, and happier lines, then it is in the world
of the press and the show and the new methods of publicity that our
first overt struggle must occur. If the conspiracy of circumstances
that has put power into our hands is to be changed into an open
creative conspiracy, it is to these things that we must first
address our awakening intelligence.</p>

<p>And it is with Vishnu rather than Siva that Brahma must struggle
here, Vishnu who wants the people blinded and divided and misled so
that he may rule unchangingly for ever. But Vishnu's way is always
either to suppress newspapers or make them so dull as to be
unreadable, and Siva tears his own papers to pieces and will not
tolerate success even in a labour journalist. But Brahma is
persistent and inventive, and if one way is blocked to him he will
find another. In the long run the press comes back into his hands
because he interests.</p>

<p>Open, candid, exact, full and generous, these are the qualities
the newspaper of the new life must possess, for these are the
necessary qualities of the new life. It must suppress nothing, lend
itself to no shams and outworn superstitions, throw all its weight
in the scale against particularism, sectarianism, and
traditionalism. Day by day or week by week, by text and picture, it
must bring to every mind capable of receiving it the new
achievements of human effort and organising power, the victories of
conscious change. Even in its reports of litigation and police
courts it will display the struggle of the old Adam against the
needs of a growing society. There is never a case before the
magistrates that does not afford either a criticism of law or
custom, a lesson in psychology, or the revelation of some
educational defect. Life will be shown as incessantly interesting,
and the anniversary, the ceremonial and the crowded occasion, so
necessary to mankind amidst the dullness and deprivation of
mediaeval life, will sink down to unimportance.</p>

<p>By an organisation of publicity and suggestion and
entertainment, upon wise and liberal lines, the new social life can
be sustained and reflected in the minds of an increasing proportion
of the people of the world, and the growth of the new order in the
body of the old assured. The press, the cinema theatre,
broadcasting centres, book publishing and distributing
organisations, are the citadels that dominate Cosmopolis. Until
they are in the hands of the creative revolution human progress is
insecure. They may be held by brigands, they may be gripped by the
forces of reaction and the life of the world may be starved or
stifled. The :firm establishment of a great press throughout the
world, reasonably free from the interference of national and local
politicians, and, in the last resort, capable of assailing them
effectively, is the first course in the foundation of the conscious
world republic.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-11" name="b5-11"></a>§ 11. FORCE AND VIOLENCE</h2>

<p class="first">HUMAN society rests upon physical force. Law is in
the first place the systematic forcible suppression of instinctive
and incoherent violence, so that property and life are generally
safe. Law in the past may have been at times little better than the
will of the ruler or</p>

<p>the pressure of tribal opinion, but it has always had in it a
certain element of system, the implication at least of a definite
pledge to protect and observe conditions. But hitherto it has been
applied only locally, it has been reserved for the subjects of a
state; it still varies enormously from land to land.</p>

<p>It would make an extraordinarily interesting book if some one
were to give us a history of the extension of legal protection to
the stranger and the alien, the growth of the idea that a man could
have rights not only as a citizen, not only as the protégé of a
foreign state sufficiently powerful to avenge his wrongs, but
simply as a man. There. would be some entertainingly tortuous
chapters upon extra-territoriality and diplomatic privilege. It
must be quite recently that the conception of a worldwide
protection for anyone whatever, an even justice for the stranger
and the native, has become practically effective. It has been
associated with the general widening of mental horizons in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has been accompanied by
certain social developments of the most interesting and promising
sort.</p>

<p>Quite the most significant of these is the modern policeman. If
we could bring back to contemporary London or Paris or New York a
capable Roman administrator, he would, so soon as he had got over
the enormity of the traffic, the astonishing width of the roadways,
the plate-glass shop-windows, the artificial lighting, and suchlike
obtrusive material differences, concentrate upon those rare
impassive persons, who smoothed and pacified and assured and
facilitated the thronging concourse. For the modern policeman is
something new in the world. He appears in history even later than
the modern press. He is something very essential and very
significant in the new phase of human association in which we are
living. He embodies new ideas. He has great possibilities of
development.</p>

<p>I suppose the learned could give us a long history of
constables, watchmen, and the like throughout the ages. I suppose
there was some sort of watch and controls in ancient Rome and
Babylon. They were not so much sustainers of order as a prowling
reminder of order in dark and dangerous places. Rarely have such
arrangements created enough confidence to dispense with the bearing
of arms by private citizens. How recent and how complete is the
individual disarmament of mankind! I have been round and about most
of the earth, and in some very lonely and desert and wild places; I
have flown thousands of miles, been underseas in submarines, had my
fair share of personal dangers, but&mdash;except as a formality
during the war&mdash;I have never carried a weapon upon me. How
astonishing that would have been to my Tudor and Plantagenet
ancestors! How different a mental atmosphere it implies! Before the
Tudor Clissold went out at nights, he made sure that his very
ornamental dagger came easily out of its decorative sheath. He put
a wary hand upon the hilt at every corner.</p>

<p>So unobtrusively that there is little about it in the histories,
these new police organisations came into being and spread, with
macadamised roads and gas-lamps and newspapers, into a changing
world. All these innovations seem commonplace, almost vulgar,
nowadays. But they transfigured the ten our of social life. Very
rapidly it appeared that with the aid of print and telegram the
common man also could apprehend the world as a whole. Imperceptibly
it was realised that life and property could be made so secure that
it was reasonable to demand release from anxiety upon either score.
It was demonstrated that freedom of movement and freedom of
activity wherever in the world one's interests might take one,
might be conceived of as common rights.</p>

<p>The ideal of the civil police developed in the eighteenth and
early nineteenth century. Though I imagine it arose first in
France, it developed in England more rapidly and completely than
anywhere else. It was, as the English mind apprehended it, a new
organisation of force for novel ends. The policeman was to be the
servant of all, he was to be kept entirely out of politics, his use
of force was to be strictly limited, he was to be unarmed or very
lightly armed with a truncheon or suchlike blunted implement, and
he was to protect and not infringe private liberties. He had to be
alert but not inquisitorial, warn rather than command. If he did
not hit hard, he was to hit surely; instead of a spasmodic and
vindictive omnipotence he was to embody a gentle, inevitable
omnipresent urgency.</p>

<p>In England and America and every European country there has been
a struggle of these profoundly modern ideals with older and baser
applications. Every British Home Secretary has felt the temptation
to give the policeman a political twist, and almost always that
temptation has been resisted. Both the United States and England
have felt a certain pressure to set him such difficult and
unsuitable tasks as the regulation of sexual morals, insistence
upon bedtime, restrictions upon drinking and eating; and every
attempt of this sort has been found to overstrain him morally and
make him inconvenient. But he has never been so far demoralised
anywhere yet as not to be a betterment in every community in which
he appears.</p>

<p>Police force and military force, in their typical and contrasted
forms, might almost be taken to symbolise the new human order and
the old, the one candid, universal, protective and releasing, the
other selective, combative secret, and compulsive. In the French
and English newspapers during the last week or so there has been a
curious display of both types of force. A group of criminals with
romantic political pretensions has been forging French paper money
in Hungary, and they have been caught by the frank concerted action
of the French and Hungarian police. A robbery in England has been
brought to book in Paris by an equally frank co-operation of the
police of France and England. By being kept out of nationalist
politics, the European police have been free to form a sort of
international of their own to the universal benefit. There one sees
the filaments of the new order leaping across the separations of
the old. But at the same time a very nasty little affair has come
to light in Toulon; mysterious Englishmen, it seems, have been in
the stews of that city, inciting poor little prostitutes to worm
secrets&mdash;what secrets can they be?&mdash;out of French sailors
and arsenal workers. Secrets got in this way are not worth the
stink they are wrapped in. But there you have the old order at work
and there is your patriotic nationalism in its logical development.
My intellect is cosmopolitan but my pride and instincts are
patriotic, and I am not pleased by the suggestion in the French
papers that my Admiralty has been caught under the beds of the
Toulon brothels.</p>

<p>A civil police is the proper method of force in the modern
state, as a regenerate press is its proper method of mental
intercommunication, and so the civilisation, the
internationalisation of the police mentality is plainly the second
line of work to which the creative revolutionary should address
himself. The development of a great world press with common ideas
<i>and</i> a common aim, and the development of an
intercommunicating network of police forces throughout the world,
animated by a common conception of security for life, property,
movement, and thought, constitute the two main practical activities
to which those who wish to secure the metamorphosis of social life
should devote their attention, their energy, their ambitions, and
their resources. An International Court between nations is all very
well in its way, but far more penetrating and significant would be
the organisation at Geneva or elsewhere of a central police bureau
to co-ordinate the protection of life, property, and freedom
throughout the world without distinction of persons under a
universally accepted code.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-12" name="b5-12"></a>§ 12. RACE FANTASIES</h2>

<p class="first">THERE is a vast amount of racial prejudice in the
world, and perhaps I am disposed to undervalue its importance as a
force antagonistic to the development of a world republic. I am
fairly alive to small differences and with quickly roused racial
feelings, but though they affect my personal relationships in all
sorts of ways, I do not find they are any encumbrance to social and
business co-operation and interchange. It is quite plain to me that
there are, for example, subtle differences between the reactions of
Clissolds as a class and of Romers as a class to the same
circumstances, and it is amusing to observe them and play with them
and natural, a natural extension of one's self-love, to arrange a
scale of values in which these differences are so estimated as to
count in favour of the Clissolds. But my affairs have brought me
into contact with most sorts of European transplanted to America,
with Indian iron-masters and Chinese and Japanese business men in
some variety, and while everywhere there were differences,
differences in quality that were almost always exaggerated by
differences in culture and training, nowhere did I find anything
that could be considered an insurmountable barrier against their
common citizenship in a world republic. The negro is the hardest
case. But the negro has hardly ever had a dog's chance of getting
civilised in considerable numbers, and yet his race has produced
brilliant musicians, writers, and men of scientific distinction. In
the eighteenth century he was the backbone of the British navy. I
refuse to consider even the black patches of the world as a
gangrene in the body of mankind or shut any kind of men out of a
possible citizenship.</p>

<p>It is foolish to deny the variety of human types. There are
strains with an earlier maturity, a shorter span of years, quicker,
more vivid sensibilities, less inhibitory, less enduring. There are
heavier and slower strains. There may be a great range of
susceptibility to particular shocks and diseases and stresses. I
doubt if there is any strain at all that can be picked out and
isolated and described as being an all round inferior strain. At
the utmost I will concede that some strains may give a larger
proportion of feeble and inassimilable individuals. I do not see
why all of these varieties should not mingle and play different
parts according to their quality.</p>

<p>The great society of the future will call for a large range of
special aptitudes. Uniformity of type is impossible in it. There is
already a natural segregation of the extremer types. They are
subtly adapted to particular roles or to special climatic
conditions. You might pour Singalese by the shipload into Norway or
Highlanders into the Congo forests; in a few centuries you would
look for their type in vain. However much humanity is stirred
together, however much it interbreeds, I see no end to its variety
so long as its opportunities vary. Some types may disappear but new
ones will appear to replace them. The pattern of the kaleidoscope
may change but there will always be a pattern. A time may come when
we shall talk no longer of a man's race but of his temperamental
type. But the number of temperamental types will have increased
rather than diminished. As the world republic develops there will
be a general lengthening of life and a longer phase of fully adult
living, but every race may reveal its own distinctive possibilities
of ripeness.</p>

<p>This book is to give one man's vision of this world; it is not a
controversial book, and I do not propose to write any formal reply
to the many preposterous volumes of incitement to race jealousy and
conflict that have been published in the last few years, books
about the Yellow Peril, the Rising Tide of Colour, the Passing of
the Great Race, and so forth. Even the titles are banners and
aggressions. Most of them impress me as the counterparts in
ethnology to the profound historical researches of Mrs. Nesta
Webster. There are scarcely the shadows of facts to correspond. I
was sufficiently concerned about this suggestion a few years ago to
give some time to ethnological realities. There has never been any
Great Race, but a continual integration, dispersal, and even
reintegration of active peoples drawn from the most diverse
sources, and there is hardly a people which has not contributed
some important release or achievement to the common progress.</p>

<p>Race trouble there is no doubt in very many regions of the
world, but it may be questioned whether anywhere it is a trouble
that arises entirely out of differences of race. Let us examine the
conditions under which these conflicts have arisen. In no cases do
racial stresses appear to be more powerful than the economic with
which they are mingled.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the change of range and scale that has
been going on since the ocean-going ship appeared, has been to
bring together or to bring into vigorous reaction peoples once
widely and securely separated, and almost always there have been
profound differences in the culture and in the phase of social
development of the peoples thus flung together. The western
Europeans had the leadership in the new phase, a leadership given
to them quite as much by geographical accidents as by
blood&mdash;for so level were east and west in material attainments
five hundred years ago that it was practically a toss-up whether
America should be discovered and settled by Chinese and Japanese
junks or by European ships. The lead fell to the Europeans, and in
America and Africa and the East Indies they blundered both upon
vast regions for material eXploitation and also upon populations
sufficiently backward and helpless to be exploited in that work.
The negro, as the extreme example, was needed as a slave and he was
taken as a slave, and the interests of the whites came to help
their prejudice in damning him to a natural inferiority. There have
been the most powerful inducements for the spreading European to
believe and to behave in accordance with the belief that the brown,
yellow, and black peoples upon whom his good fortune had thrust him
were unteachable or weak-willed or ill-disposed or perverse, and
fit only for a servile relationship to a profit-making master. The
disadvantages that came from illiteracy and inexperience and
inferior and antiquated traditions, are so indistinguishable from
innate disadvantages, that the testimony against the exotic peoples
was as easy to produce as it is difficult to confute.</p>

<p>To-day we are still in the midst of this unequal struggle. The
means of getting at the backward populations are still increasing
their efficiency, the large scale handling of things, mass and
plantation production, are still spreading, and the scientifically
constructed state still lags in its attempts to overtake the
headlong rapacity of its Crests, to whom its science has given
weapons and wings. The methods of the modern order develop too
slowly for the old traditions that possess men's imaginations. The
Crests are for unskilled mass labour to-day, for serfdom and for
slavery, just as firmly as the first Pharaohs, and as they once
grabbed our coal and ore and turned our factories into hells for
children and our industrial regions into slums, so now&mdash;as our
own people have developed resistance and our industries have
modernised their methods&mdash;they have spread their grasp
wherever a less recalcitrant population seemed accessible to
them.</p>

<p>Through all this picture I have been giving of my world as a
developing economic and social system, runs the idea that in the
process of change of scale that is going on now, there are two
almost distinct strands, one unprecedented and one a repetition of
a former human experience. The latter repeats the expropriation of
small freemen and the concentration of wealth and economic power,
that made and then destroyed Imperial Rome. The former is something
that men have never known before, it is the progressive
organisation of a scientific conservation and exploitation of
natural resources on a world scale, for the common ends of mankind.
This is Brahma taking the sceptre from Vishnu. It means a new type
of industry; a supersession of human toil by machinery whenever it
is merely toil, the progressive abolition of the ignorant and
unskilled human being and the progressive development of skilled
and mentally participating workers. Wherever it goes, it seeks to
sanitate, train, educate, and reform. Its dearest, most cherished
factor, is its labour. In the old system, labour was the cheapest,
universal driving power under hunger and the whip. I have already
drawn a contrast between our works at Downs-Peabody and the Crest
Collieries. You may find that contrast running through all the
industrial and agricultural developments of the world to-day and
see the two systems everywhere fighting a still very uncertain
battle.</p>

<p>The earlier system which arose from the first exploitation of
the change of scale under the burthen of the old traditions,
obsessed with the idea that an unlimited supply of labour, as
nearly animal as possible, was a necessary condition to its
progress, resisted education, resisted all organisation of its
workers, underpaid them and did not protect them from the rapacity
of adulterating retailers, sub-landlords, and every sort of
middleman; it produced slums at every industrial centre, and it
created swamps of agricultural labourers at the pauper level,
slaves or peons, wherever it set up its plantations. The creative
industrialism of today, demanding as it does a high type of labour
and as much participation as possible, has no more use for slums
and a reserve of unemployed than it has for ghettos or slave ships.
It is not that it is humanitarian but that it looks further and
works cleaner. But it is only winning its way slowly to the control
of the world's economic life, and what is effectively ascendent in
the processes of production and distribution to-day remains the
scrambling, crowding, profit-seeking, unorganised competitive
tradition that was developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. Its methods were evolved in western Europe, and they
have extended throughout the world.</p>

<p>Now these broad facts need to be borne in mind when the question
of contemporary race conflicts is considered. There has been
modernisation everywhere, but it has not brought up the regions
that were backward a century ago to a level with the still rapidly
changing modern states. While in the Atlantic countries the slum
phase is past its maximum, the once autonomous Ii f e of Asiatic
and African countries is, with improving communications, being
invaded and drawn into world-trading relationships and repeating
the story of western Europe.</p>

<p>A large part of the brown, yellow, and black population of the
world is arriving now at a phase of economic development from which
our Anglo-Saxon worker is gradually and with intermittent set-backs
emerging. The baser factory industries emigrate to Asia. The east
end of the world wins the empire of cheap and nasty from the east
end of London. A universal characteristic of every population as it
parts from its old economic and social balances and begins to eat
bought and imported food and work regularly and uninterestingly for
remote and unknown customers, is a vast, dingy proliferation. That
happened in England. But it has ceased there. It is happening now
over great areas of the world.</p>

<p>Not only do real and dreadful slums of the same type as those of
middle nineteenth-century England appear in the great Indian and
Chinese towns, but there is what one might call a general
"slumification" of entire populations. Their original economic and
social balances are destroyed by an influx of new commodities and
new employments. They become politically protected from warfare and
raids. They lose native control over their best lands. The essence
of a "slum" it seems to me is this: that it is a portion of
population dependent on economic processes over which it has no
control, fed so that it proliferates; it is the breeding of
low-grade, uneducated employed. A Kaffir kraal, an Egyptian
cotton-growing village, the Chinese quarter of a treaty town, an
Italian township near some workable deposit of chemicals, may be as
much of a slum now as a Lancashire cotton town or a black country
district was in 1840.</p>

<p>The statistical aspects of this slum phase are extremely
terrifying to all that sort of people who can be terrified by
statistics. But indeed there is no reason for their terrors. Their
"rising tide of colour," and so forth, is this natural and
inevitable concomitant of the delocalisation of the economic life
of the lands of "colour." Populations that have been at a kind of
balance for centuries, multiply, add ten or fifteen per cent. at
every census. This docs not mean any sort of biological success for
the new peoples it is affecting. The new base population masses are
at too low a grade of adaptability for effective settlement abroad.
At the utmost they may transfer to congenial slums elsewhere where
the sweating is a little better. Only in alarmist computations can
they be considered capable of war. This "tide of colour" may rise
in its own tanks to even tormenting pressures, but it will never
overflow very extensively. And it is a tide that will ebb as the
economic planet passes on to its next phase.</p>

<p>It is remarkable what intelligent people can be infected by
these suggestions that we are all going to be turned black
presently&mdash;or at any rate a dark chocolate&mdash;by these
adverse birth-rates in the oriental and semi-tropical slums. They
begin to fret about number and fret more and more. They are seized
with a passionate advocacy of counter procreation. They write off
books exhorting the "white" peoples to up and have a fearful lot of
children. Nothing else they feel and declare will save us from
colouring up like so many Meerschaum pipes. We are to launch babe
against babe. I shall not be surprised to hear of exhortations to
the quiet folk who listen in to the broadcasters. "<i>Think!</i>
Seven little negroes and ten Chinese have been born in the last
quarter of an hour. We are able to transmit the squeals of the
last. Wa-a-a-a. A warning! 'Wake up, England! What are you doing
there? Oh, good! Good news to hand!&mdash;Triplets in Bermondsey,
<i>all</i> white, and twins at Salisbury. Good women! Remember
Nelson. England expects&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>I cannot respond to this clamour for children.</p>

<p>It does not alarm me in the least that the English birth rate
for 1925 is the lowest on record. With a million and a half
unemployed in England, I wish it could be lower. I hope it will be.
I hope the time is not far off when every child born in England
will be born because its parents fully meant it to be born and
because they wanted it and meant to rear it. A time will come when
all the world will have passed through and out of this slum phase
in the development of a large scale economic life, and when birth
control will be universal.</p>

<p>Birth control is indeed essential&mdash;nay, more, it is
fundamental&mdash;to the conception of a new phase of human life
that the world republic will inaugurate. I would make birth control
my test of orthodoxy between liberalism and reaction. All who are
for birth control are with me and essentially for the new world;
all who are against it are against the progressive revolution.</p>

<p>Birth control embodies in the most intimate and vivid form, the
essential differentiation of the newer conception of life from the
old. The old was based upon the idea of a meticulous Providence. It
not only took chances at every turn, but it found a kind of
superstitious delight in taking chances. It was always expecting
Providence to rig them in favour of good intentions. It retained
this childish attitude throughout life. Do what you are told to do,
submit, make no attempts to control consequences; its spirit lay in
such injunctions, and if it was so far inconsistent and illogical
as to struggle against competitors and rivals, to promote wars and
grip possessions, it always defended its inconsistency by a
surprised assertion that in these things it obeyed the way of
Nature and the Will of God. But the new idea of life admits no
limit to man's attempt to control his destinies. It plans as
largely as it can; it would plan more largely if it could; it
gathers together every available force to free man from accident
and necessity and make him master of the universe in which he finds
himself.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive a world republic existing and continuing
unless that automatic increase of population which follows every
increment in the food supply is restrained, and it can only be
restrained by a worldwide knowledge and universal acceptability of
the methods and means of birth control. The material gains of the
nineteenth century were largely swallowed up by the disorganised
increase in population. Given sufficient wisdom to control that,
and these nightmares of civilisation suffocating under th
multiplicity of its darker and baser offspring, dissolve into
nothingness.</p>

<p>No variety of the human species has any overwhelming and
uncontrollable desire for offspring as such; that old Crone Nature
has never yet given the desires of sex so long a range of vision;
and as the standard of living and the multiplicity of interests
increase, there are no sort of people anywhere who will not welcome
the freedoms and the relief from burthensome families that birth
control affords. The love and pride of children will ensure the
sufficient continuation of the race. But that very love and pride
is opposed to the swarming ill-conducted household under an
exhausted mother that is the characteristic slum home. The most
philoprogenitive would surely rather breed three masters than a
dozen slaves.</p>

<p>When we find a race or a people alleged to have an overwhelming
desire for children as children, it will be found almost always
that they are living under conditions which render possible the
early utilisation of these children, who are sent into the fields
or sent out to work or sold for servitude and outrage&mdash;before
childhood is fairly at an end. These simple-hearted folk, you will
find, are breeding themselves, as well as their chickens and pigs,
for profit. It is easy to cite the Bombay Hindu as a man who will
recoil from birth control with a noble, a religious, an instinctive
horror, but he is easier to understand when one learns that he may
have two or three wives, get children by all of them, send wives
and all the children as soon as they are toddling into the cotton
mills and fill his paunch with their combined pay. But shut these
mills to little children and married women, brace up his social and
educational responsibilities, and you will find his ideas about the
family westernising at a headlong pace. In a little while he will
be another Hindu gone over, as they say, to "western materialism,"
and you will find him studying birth control advertisements in his
native press as eagerly as he studies the offers of nerve tonics
and cures for impotence that now adorn these publications.</p>

<p>I do not want to minimise the grave dangers of the slum strata,
these pockets and mines and veins of slum matter, that are so
widespread now on our changing planet. But they do not threaten us
with great racial conflicts, wars of white against yellow, gigantic
all-black insurrections or the like. And they are not to be cured
by a countervailing domestic activity that will distend every
respectable "white" home with babies, and send back the whites to
insanitary mediaevalism. What these great "slumifications" may
engender is a delaying and destructive malaria of ignorance and
misconception, a fever of violent politics.</p>

<p>The remedy is not more white babies, but more civilisation. It
lies in the hands of the men of worldwide business .interests and
great financial power. They and they alone can exercise a
sufficient directive force to hurry the economic development of the
more dangerous lands past the festering phase. It is they alone who
can arm or disarm, corrupt or control. With them resides the
possibility of a concerted breaking down of the fantastic barriers
to trade, transport and intercommunication that now protect
backward, wasteful, misplaced and slum-creating forms of
employment. No other sort of men can do that, but only big business
men. They can strengthen the hands of the labour intellectuals and
enforce their demand for a rising minimum standard of living
throughout the planet. With a rising standard of comfort the
springs that feed these dank dangerous marshes of low-grade
breeding will dry up, because whenever comfort rises, the
birth-rate falls. And it is the big-business men who can and who
should subsidise and stimulate liberal education everywhere. They
can loosen restrictions on press and publication in these matters,
with an effectiveness peculiar to their position of advantage.
Everywhere they can make aids and assistance conditional upon open
windows and unrestricted light. Their moral influence can be
enormous. Even now it can be enormous, and as their realisation of
their responsibilities grows, as the Open Conspiracy realises
itself, it will become the guiding power in world affairs.</p>

<p>And as the world republic dawns into economic being, this
literature of race panic and breeding scares that now gives such
grave concern to so many unsoundly informed people, will seem more
and more preposterous and curious.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-13" name="b5-13"></a>§ 13. ANTIQUITY OF YOUTH</h2>

<p class="first">THERE has been a fashion lately of flattering the
young. The young have been told that they are the hope of the earth
and that their naIve instincts are better than all the painfully
acquired wisdom of mankind. But to be young is not necessarily to
be new. All immaturity is by its very nature a throw-back. The gill
arches of the human embryo recall the Cambrian period and are the
roundabout way of nature to a jawbone that one would be glad to
have developed more directly, and to earbones one could have wished
better designed. The infantile mind recapitulates the successive
suppressions of the ape and the savage. The adolescent young man or
woman is a barbarian by nature, ready to revive, eager to revive,
all the tawdry romanticism that we adults are clearing away. Young
people are not conservative perhaps, but they are instinctively
reactionary.</p>

<p>Since the war we have been much oppressed by the generation that
grew up and missed it. They grew up while their fathers and elder
brothers were away and for many of them the spanking hand, the
reproving voice, never returned. It has seemed to many of this raw
stratum that it was their business to take control of the earth.
But their proper business is to learn something about the
earth.</p>

<p>Adolescent mentality has had an opportunity to display itself
since the war, as it has never had before in the whole history of
mankind, and everywhere it has shown itself the same thing,
violent, intolerant, emotional, dramatic, stupid and blind to all
the vaster intimations of the catastrophe. Everywhere it has rushed
to follow extremist leaders and to follow them with a fierce
devotion. The Communist Party in Moscow is substantially youthful,
and its devotees in Europe and America are rarely over thirty. The
fascist nuisance is its natural counterpart.</p>

<p>The mind of youth is a medieval mind. It takes us back to the
age of persecution, to the age of theology and urgent fear. Life
crowds upon the young with an effect of intense impatience; all the
decisions youth makes seem to its inexperience to be conclusive
decisions. It snatches at guiding principles and defends them
dogmatically. Youth like an undisciplined army dare not risk
manoeuvre or retreat for fear of a panic. It seeks to silence and
kill criticisms&mdash;not because it believes intensely but because
it fears that it will not believe. Its violence veils a profound
intellectual cowardice, the dread of a phase of indecision, the
horror of being left at loose ends.</p>

<p>Few minds are mature enough and stout enough before thirty to
achieve a genuine originality. The originality of the young is for
the most part merely a childish reversal of established things. The
independence of the young is commonly no more than a primitive
resistance to instruction. The youthful revolutionary is merely
insubordinate and his extremist radicalism an attempt to return to
archaic conditions, to naturalism, indiscipline, waste, and dirt.
The youthful anti-revolutionary turns back to mystical loyalties
and romance.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-14" name="b5-14"></a>§ 14. SUPERSESSION OF
SCHOOLMASTERS</h2>

<p class="first">IT is necessary to educate the young for the new
order. But that everyone should be educated does not mean that
every one is to go to school or that schools are to be enlarged and
multiplied. People are too apt to identify schools and education.
Never was there a more mischievous error. Schools may merely fix
and intensify those adolescent qualities it is the business of
education to correct.</p>

<p>My distant cousin Wells&mdash;if a character may for once turn
on his creator and be frank about him&mdash;has written frequently
and abundantly of the supreme necessity of education, of that race
he detects in human affairs between "education and catastrophe." I
agree about the urgency of the need for education, but I doubt if
he has sufficiently separated the idea of education from the idea
of schoolmastering. He was, I believe, for some years at an
impressionable age, a schoolmaster, and he has shown a pathetic
disposition throughout a large part of his life to follow
schoolmasters about and ask them to be more so, but different. His
actions have belied his words. He was indeed so much of an educator
that quite early he found it imperative to abandon schoolmastering.
He produced encyclopaedic schemes and curricula that no
schoolmaster would or could undertake. He wrote a text-book of
history that shocked the scholastic mind beyond measure. Finally he
settled down to a sort of propaganda of Sanderson of Oundle, whose
chief claim to immortality is that there never was a man in control
of a public school so little like a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Dickon discovered Oundle, and both Dick and William spent their
school years there, and in my capacity of uncle I met Sanderson
quite a number of times. We two had just missed meeting him thirty
odd years before. He must have come to Dulwich as science master a
year or so after we had gone on to South Kensington. But what a
schoolmaster! His methods were passionately anti-scholastic. The
answer to the riddle, "When is a school not a school?" used to be,
"When it is Oundle." He was trying to make his school a factory, a
laboratory for agricultural biology, a museum, an institute for the
preparation of reports upon everything under the sun, a musical and
dramatic society. He would get explorers, investigators, industrial
leaders, to come and freshen the scholastic air by talking to his
boys. His enemies said he let down the games, let down the
scholarship of the place. I believe he did. It is not least among
his claims to honour. He made it as nearly an educational
institution as any English public school has ever been. The games
and grammar prig was at a discount at Oundle all through
Sanderson's time.</p>

<p>Dickon was greatly taken by Sanderson; even physically they had
something in common. They were both ruddy, ample men with a spice
of rhetoric in their composition. But Sanderson was always rather
out of condition, fattish, with a shortness of breath that should
have warned his friends of the heart weakness that snapped him off
from life in mid-activity. He spoke with a pant in his voice and in
broken sentences, and there was a faint remote echo of Northumbria
in his intonations.</p>

<p>The school, he said, should be a model of the world not of the
world as it is but of the world as it ought to be. It had to send
out boys prepared for adult life, ready to take hold of affairs. So
he did his utmost to bring reality to them; he filled his place
with machines and models of mines, with charts of trade and
production. He sent batches of boys to factories and collieries, to
live among the workers for a week or so. He put up a building which
he called the Temple of Vision with money he got from Sir Alfred
Yarrow, and he was going to fill it, he told me, with charts and
exhibits to display the whole story of human achievement from its
very beginnings to the present time. It was quite empty when I saw
it, a little while before his death, and I believe it is empty
still, but as he stood amidst its echoing bareness and expounded it
to me, I saw plainly a vision of that soul of creative
industrialism he was trying to evoke. He died before any of his
wider plans materialised. His greater Oundle was never more than a
project, and the big, prosperous, and liberal school he left behind
him reverts to the normal conditions of an English public school.
The games and the "scholarship" have been restored; the novelties
cut out; the Yarrow Memorial has never become a Temple of Vision.
My nephews, I think, were lucky indeed to have fallen into
Sanderson's time and have him as their master; they liked him
enormously, not wIth awe but wIth a great affection; William
particularly was his loyal friend.</p>

<p>When one met and talked with Sanderson it was possible to
believe, as my cousin Wells believed, that there could be a mighty
reconstruction of the life of England and the world, through
schools, through an expansion and glorification of public schools.
One saw for a dazzling interlude, England all dotted with Oundles,
each with its biological laboratory in contact with agriculture,
its workshops in contact with industry, its youngsters alive to the
realities of the life of the community. One saw a new generation
of. young Englishmen, broad-minded, helpful, generous-spirited,
capable, technically equipped, going out into the world, servants
and masters of the republic of mankind. The fallacy of that hope
lay in the fact that from the scholastic point of view Sanderson
was a complete abnormality. There were no other schoolmasters like
him, and there are not likely to be any. He was the antithesis of a
public schoolmaster; a complete "outsider," in the opinion of most
of his fellow heads, a lamentable, scandalous incident that had
happened to a small, respectable grammar school.</p>

<p>You need only consult the nearest secondary schoolmaster to
verify the statement. To ask such a one about Sanderson is like
asking a "fully qualified," dull and dangerous general practitioner
about that famous osteopath, Sir Herbert Barker, and his forty
thousand forbidden cures. "<i>Oow!&mdash;Sanderson?</i> That Oundle
fellow!" The man goes green. His nostrils twitch into a sneer. He
intimates with an unreal gentleness that you know very little of
schoolmastering if you think Sanderson is a schoolmaster; "very,
very little." And under encouragement he develops his case.</p>

<p>Sanderson was originally an <i>elementary</i> teacher, not a
real schoolmaster at all. He went to Cambridge on a special
scholarship. His religious orthodoxy was more than doubtful. He had
radical views. His patriotism was uncertain. His mathematical
teaching was eccentric. Moreover, he did nothing new, and whatever
he did new was done better, elsewhere. "By men who don't advertise,
y'know." And&mdash;"he let down the games and all that!" He was
good at squeezing money out of his governors, of course. Had his
points, no doubt. So the <i>secondary</i> schoolmaster.</p>

<p>This idea that Sanderson in his later years entertained and
expanded to the Rotary Clubs and to Weir and Yarrow and Bledisloe
and my cousin and all and sundry, this idea that we might start a
new way of life, a new phase of civilisation in the schools, that
we might make them models of the world as it ought to be, forecasts
of and training places for new achievements in civilisation, is
vitiated by just this <i>one</i> little flaw that the last human
beings in the world in whom you are likely to find a spark of
creative energy or a touch of imaginative vigour are the masters
and mistresses of upper middle-class schools. I say of upper-class
schools because the origins and quality of the teachers in the
popular schools of Europe make them psychologically an entirely
different species. But these schoolmasters and school-mistresses,
as distinguished from teachers, to whom we entrust the sons and
daughters of nearly all the owning and directing people of our
world, are by necessity orthodox, conformist, genteel people of an
infinite discretion and an invincible formality. Essentially they
are a class of refugees from the novelties and strains and
adventures of life. I do not see how as a class they can ever be
anything else.</p>

<p>In the past there was nothing paradoxical in the fact that
schools were conservative social organs. They were established not
to innovate but restrain, to transmit a rule, a ritual, conventions
of writing, speech and computation, to priestly neophytes, to
prospective rulers. The less they changed, the better they observed
the spirit of their foundation. So far as my casual knowledge goes,
the idea of a <i>progressive</i> school dawned only after the onset
of the New Learning at the Renaissance. Even then I doubt if the
idea of the idea of progress actually entering the schools can be
traced. The new schools were to teach Greek and ope}} the world of
liberal thought as the man left the school and went on into life.
Greek was the key to a liberal and creative culture; but the school
handed over the key rather than opened the door. The highest virtue
of the school was still precision; with blows and exhortations it
handed on a correct tradition of languages and calculation, and
presumed but little beyond.</p>

<p>Larger pretensions on the part of the schoolmaster grew with the
development of boarding-schools in the past three centuries. The
Jesuit schools, which in accordance with Bacon's counsels, provided
the pattern even in the most Protestant countries for the new
schools of Europe, took boys right out of their homes for the most
formative years in life. This no doubt did very much to break up
the solidarity, the clannishness of families; but it substituted a
new clannishness, loyalty to the school. Men became prouder of
their schools than of their fathers. The pedagogue added the duties
of a delegated parentage to his teaching. He set himself to
character building. The English public schools ran away with this
pattern and became the extreme instance of the new development. In
the nineteenth century their influence reached its zenith. By the
middle of that century the prevalent Englishman abroad and in
public affairs had become a type noticeably different from any
other nationality. He had become stiff, arrogant, profoundly
ignorant, technically honourable, and utterly incomprehensible to
the uninitiated rest of mankind. He was no longer the Englishman of
the Elizabethan and Cromwellian model, half Kelt, half Viking; he
was no longer any sort of man; he was a public-school boy, the
finished product. Amid the harsh realities of business he did not
so much abound, and there and in art and literature one may still
find the native Englishman, comparatively unwarped by
schoolmastering. But the clue to the manifest change in character
that Britain and its Empire have displayed during the last hundred
years, the gradual lapses from a subtle and very real greatness and
generosity, to imitative imperialism and solemn puerility is to be
found, if not precisely upon the playing fields of Eton, in the
mental and moral quality of the men who staff its public
schools.</p>

<p>It was manifest to a man like Sanderson that the ruling and
directive English of to-day had been <i>made</i> politically and
socially by the public school. It seemed logical to him that if you
turned the public school about towards creative things, you would
in the same measure turn about the Empire and the drama of the
world in which it still plays so large a part. But since he was a
complete "outsider," as they said, to public-school life, since he
picked his assistants very forcibly to suit himself and his own
methods, it was natural for him to remain to the last blind to the
inevitable characteristics of the men who would in general staff
the boarding-schools of an upper class, wherever such
boarding-schools came into existence, and their fantastic
incompatibility with any such salvation of the world by schools as
he projected.</p>

<p>The last time I was in England I had occasion to go to Dimbourne
to put in a friendly word for my eldest grandson who is on the
waiting list for that ancient foundation. It is not my wish that
has sent him there. He has to go there because his father was a
Dimbourne boy before him, and I am supposed to be influential
because Walpole Stent, the next master under the Head&mdash;I
forget for a moment his exact title&mdash;is my half-brother. He
did not follow Dickon and myself to Dulwich and so come into the
Sanderson orbit, because the Walpole Stents also had a Dimbourne
tradition. He went to Dimbourne on some special terms reserved for
the children of old Dimbournians and got a school scholarship for
Oxford, achieved a moderate degree in Greats, and after various
assistantships returned to the old place. There I found him and
walked about the scattered school buildings with him, inspected the
dormitories of his house, looked at some cricket, visited the
wonderful old cloisters and the dreadful new War Memorial, all of
white marble, and the arms of our allies and colonies and
dependencies in gilt and colour, met his various colleagues and
dined with the Head and refreshed my impressions of the directive
forces at the heart of representative English manhood.</p>

<p>I had not seen him for a dozen years or more, and I was struck
by his increasing resemblance to my departed stepfather. He bends
his forehead forward now with just the same effect of undirected
preoccupation that failed to win the respect of Dickon and myself
forty odd years ago. I must be twelve or thirteen years older than
he is; but I felt that of the two of us he was rather the senior.
He seemed to realise that too. It came into my head suddenly when
he greeted me that my father was a convicted felon and a
suicide&mdash;a thing that had not troubled me in the least for a
score of years. He seemed to feel that I was not quite worthy of
Dimbourne, but that he would do his best to overlook that, and be
kind to me and make me understand the place. His voice is quite
different from his father's. It is an acquired voice. At times it
brays rather querulously. He pitches it up in the air and keeps it
there, dominating you as no doubt it dominates a classroom. It
seems to tire him. I do not remember my stepfather ever betraying
fatigue in the use of his voice.</p>

<p>We sat in his study at night after I had been through the staff
and the Head, and before I departed to sleep in the horrible
parents' Inn, in the town. We talked as much like blood relations
as possible. He has some traits of my mother in his chin and jaw
and about his eyes. He tried to condescend but he had no courage.
He speedily fell back upon the defensive offence. At times sheer
propitiation came to the surface. He knew I was the stronger animal
and he left the conversational leads to me.</p>

<p>The room, like all scholastic studies I have ever seen, was
lined with bookshelves. They reached up to about two-thirds of the
height of the room, and above that against a dingy green wallpaper
were various of those extraordinary violent black and white prints
in which Piranesi guyed the monuments of Rome. All schoolmasters
admire them. They exaggerate so heroically. There must be a
perpetual copying and reprinting of these things to replenish the
scholastic market. There were also two very large photographs of
the Matterhorn which my intrepid half-brother has twice ascended,
an ice axe and some ski. And there was a cast, a very cheap cast,
of the head of that statue of Antinous which is in a niche in the
Vatican Museum. For some reason that is not perfectly clear to me
it is associated with a memory of marsh mallows growing in a marble
basin. It is, I think, called the Belvedere Antinous, the one I
mean with the downcast face. I remember the head as a very
beautiful one, and I have seen many photographs and even copies of
it that have recalled much of its loveliness, but this cast was a
half-size cast, made from the work of some poor copyist, and it
had, I reflected as the evening went on, much the same relationship
to its fresh and gracious original that the erudition of a Greats
scholar has to philosophy and the Greek spirit. That dulled
reminiscence, that false claim to an intimacy never achieved, was
so placed that it looked down on my half-brother as he sat and
talked to me of the richness and wonder of the Dimbourne tradition.
On the table was an untidy litter of papers, various books, a
tobacco jar and pipes. My half-brother is a conscientious and
systematic smoker, with a pipe for every day in the week. It is by
his smoking and the mightiness of his pipes, by his cricket and by
his feats among the classical mountains, that one knows him for a
man.</p>

<p>I do not recall and I could not imitate our dialogue. I have
already quoted him once, for it was he who called Sanderson "that
Oundle fellow." I became curious to know him, for he was still
alive. I tried him over modern writers a little rather carefully so
as not to scare him. Shaw was "that crank who runs down
Shakespeare"; Nietzsche was a madman of whom he could not "make
head or tail"; Samuel Butler, William James, Maurice Baring, Philip
Guedalla, Cunninghame Graham, James Joyce, James Branch Cabell,
Christopher Morley, Sherwood Anderson, Mencken, Tchehov, Julian
Huxley, Fairfield Osborne, Sir Arthur Evans, Jung, were among the
names he had either never heard of or forgotten, but Freud, he
knew, was "pigs' stuff." His phrase. He had caught two boys talking
about Freud and "pulled them up pretty sharply." Anatole France he
had heard of, but not read. That took my breath away.</p>

<p>"One can't keep pace with it all," he said wearily. "Luckily I
don't have to buy for the school library. That faIls to Gunbridge,
and he tells me the difficulty of getting any modern books that a
clean healthy boy may open without danger is&mdash;frightful."</p>

<p>W. H. Hudson, for some inexplicable reason, he supposed to have
written a text-book of English literature. Sinclair Lewis, he
thought, had "seduced poor George Eliot." Perhaps I was a little
exacting about American writers, but I wanted to know what the
young lions of a ruling class were likely to get from him about
that really rather important country. So I tried him up and down
the list. He knew absolutely nothing of any living American writer
at all unless Professor Nicholas Murray Butler can be considered
one; him he had met at some academic treat at Oxford. He spoke of
the "poverty" of contemporary letters.</p>

<p>"What wouldn't they give for our Newbolt or our Kipling?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"You think there is no promise at all there?" I put in. He
shrugged his shoulders and grimaced. I pretended to understand.</p>

<p>I turned back to science and philosophy. Charles Darwin, he
thought, "rather blown upon nowadays." He had been "exposed a good
deal," he understood, by the Abbe Mend!. Einstein for some occult
reason, he said, "chopped logic." I would like to have pursued
that, but I felt it might be unwise to press him too closely. Even
as it was, he had become a little restive under my rather
persistent soundings. "You have more time for reading than I have,
I see," he expostulated suddenly. "Here the work is
incessant&mdash;incessant. And when I have a holiday&mdash;well, I
put a little worn volume of Catullus into my pocket. That suffices.
Old-fashioned stuff, you will say. Old, old stuff. Yes, I admit
it."</p>

<p>I note in passing that these rare holidays of his amount to
almost three months in the year.</p>

<p>I felt he had managed his "get away" rather creditably. I did
not pursue him further in that direction.</p>

<p>I got him to talk about the boys in the school. And the fathers
and uncles&mdash;"and the mothers!" said my half-brother&mdash;who
came respectfully and intermittently when the disciplines of the
school permitted it. "Odd people we have now," he said. The waiting
list had never been longer. Business people from the Midlands were
discovering Dimbourne, people with factories and so forth. "It's a
good omen for the country," he said.</p>

<p>He had an air of forgetting that Dickon and I belonged to this
lowly but opulent stratum. "We do what we can to civilise them," he
said. "Some of the boys are quite jolly. But the fathers ask the
most impossible things. Oh! One of them wanted us to take up
Russian, and another was here only yesterday demanding a German
master. I don't mean a man to teach German <i>inter alia</i>, I
mean a real live Hun. Modern German. German without literature or
history. So that they might <i>speak</i> it&mdash;like commercial
travellers. And there's a working model of an ore crusher one of
them has given us. It's in one of the corridors. A frightful thing
for getting in the way. Near the Roman galley and the restoration
of Jerusalem. One has to tide over that sort of thing. One has to
parry. The mothers are fussy about health and warm baths and
flowers on the dinner table, dreadfully fussy at times, but most of
that falls on the matrons, thank Heaven! They are much more
amenable about the curriculum&mdash;much more amenable. They seem
to feel what we are really driving at, more than the men."</p>

<p>He was under way now and I found it less necessary to follow him
up closely. I abstained from asking what he was really driving at.
My eyes wandered to the bookshelves. There were hardly any real
books at all. There were schoolbooks, dictionaries, Macaulay's
History, Green's History of the English People, classical and Bible
Encyclopaedias, Murray's Guide to Switzerland, school editions of
the classics with notes, informative books on mountaineering and
ski-ing and fly-fishing and cricket. There was an annotated
Shakespeare, the "Works" of Sir Walter Scott, the Vailima
Stevenson, various Kiplings, an odd volume of <i>Picturesque
Europe</i>, something called <i>Rab and his Friends</i>, a book
called <i>Friends in Council</i>&mdash;what could that have been? A
stray Quaker volume?&mdash;a lot of dingy leather-bound books that
looked like sermons and may have been bought to fill up. What on
earth is the Badminton Library? There was a lot of it....</p>

<p>My attention reverted for a time to my half-brother. "I can say
with a good deal of confidence, with considerable confidence in
fact, that Dimbourne is one of the <i>cleanest</i> schools in
England. It needs constant watchfulness....</p>

<p>"Send them to bed tired," said my half-brother thoughtfully, as
he knocked out the ashes of his pipe upon the top bar of the grate.
"Send them to bed tired."</p>

<p>So that was what he had got to. It was time I too was sen t to
bed tired.</p>

<p>I roused myself from a private meditation upon heredity. I had
been thinking of the beach near Saint Raphael&mdash;how many years
was it ago?&mdash;and of a longer, leaner, but extremely similar
Walpole Stent in knickerbockers, bowling and bowling to Dickon's
hefty smacks, never by any chance getting him out, and all the
while lecturing, helpfully, improvingly, confidently, on Dickon's
way of holding his bat, which was wrong, which was all wrong.
<i>Plank</i>, and away went the ball for four. "You have a good
eye," said my stepfather, "but it's all wrong; the knuckles of the
left hand ought to be much more forward."</p>

<p>And from these memories I had strayed to questionings that
touched my suppressed but incurable patriotic pride. Which of us
represents "God's Englishman"&mdash;as Mr. John Milton put
it&mdash;most nearly? We Clissolds or these Walpole
Stents&mdash;the wild English or the tame?</p>

<p>Whatever the answer to that may be, there is little doubt in my
mind which of the two, Sanderson or Walpole Stent, is the
representative schoolmaster, the schoolmaster with whom we creative
people have to reckon. I do not see how it is possible in any
country where there are great differences in class and where the
schoolmasters are drawn from the middle and upper classes, that the
average schoolmaster should ever be a much better thing than my
half-brother. The whole crowd of upper-class youth has been picked
over again and again before the schoolmasters come; the most
vigorous and innovating men have gone in for diplomacy, the law,
politics, the public services, science, literature, art, business,
the hard adventure of life; and at last comes the residue. "Poor
devil!" I once heard my nephew Dick say of a friend of his. "He's
got a second-class. His people have no money. His games are pretty
fair. He'll have to go into a school." A few public schoolmasters
may have a vocation; the body of them, the substance of the
profession, is that sort of residue. Its mentality is the mentality
of residual men.</p>

<p>That is a neglected factor which has to be reckoned with in the
history of the British Empire during the last hundred years. That
is something the foreign observer has still to realise. A larger
and larger proportion of its influential and directive men
throughout this period have spent the most plastic years of their
lives under the influence of the least lively, least enterprising,
most restrictive, most conservative and intricately self-protective
types it was possible to find. We have bred our governing class
mentally, as the backward Essex farmer bred his pigs, from the
individuals that were no good for the open market. The intelligent
foreigner complains that the Englishman abroad has been growing
duller and stiffer in every generation. I offer up my half-brother,
Walpole Stent, as the clue.</p>

<p>From quite early years this scholastic type has to develop a
private system of compensatory false values. Life would be
unendurable without it. These men of a secondary grade of vitality
whose lot it is to figure in the rump of the first or second class
in every examination, and to go in to bat in the tail of the
eleven, find their refuge in an ideal of modest worth, something
richer, better, and truer than flaunting success, something which
is the real opposite of failure. Walpole Stent's phrase about
Dimbourne cricket returns to me. "We always manage to put up a
decent show." And he used another phrase, "We don't pretend to be
miracle workers." It was an intimation that "miracle working"
wasn't really in quite the best form. It was something you
"pretended" to. The mathematical teaching at Dimbourne "does not
claim to turn out calculating boys." But Dimbourne used to "cut a
good figure" in the old Mathematical Tripos, and had a "decent"
list of First, Second, and Third Wranglers in that perverted test
of unphilosophical discipline. Style, good form, is a great
consolation for the impotent. Mr. Shandy's bull, one remembers, was
a master of style.</p>

<p>And another powerful word with Walpole Stent was "scholarly."
The substance might be platitudinous, the argument inconclusive,
the deductions wrong; those things were upon the knees of the gods;
but one could at any rate be accurate upon minor points and
polished, stylish, careful, and allusive about the irrelevant. No
examination ever discovered genius, intellectual power, and "all
that sort of thing"; no examination is or can be a test for poverty
of the imagination; and so the worthy man gets through "quite
decently" and presently finds himself, in his armour of
compensatory values, less thrust, it seems to him, than called, to
domination over schoolboy minds. He has never been first before,
but now in this world of school he is master, and he can make his
compensations his standards. It is inevitable, it is without malice
or compunction that he does so.</p>

<p>Inevitably he is conservative. He has abandoned free, novel, and
powerful things to bow himself to the existing state of affairs,
and he resents the freedoms, enterprises, and novel successes that
reflect upon his own retractions. He becomes the quiet,
inaggressive but obstinate champion of the old order against his
bolder contemporaries. He desires their defeat because it involves
his own justification. He will thwart where he can and deprecate
always. But he loves to exalt the past, the classic, magnified
past, the glory of the splendid dead&mdash;who are deader even than
he. How can it be otherwise with him?</p>

<p>That is the stuff that must be in general control of the
development of our youngsters, so long as we are content to send
them off to these boarding-schools. No other stuff is available for
such places, which by their very existence insist upon class
distinctions and class traditions. And just as it is unavoidable
that nine out of ten schoolmasters will be of this type, so also
are certain reactions unavoidable upon the minds of the generations
they will influence. They will not inspire, they will not compel,
they will not stimulate nor evoke. If they had the quality to do
that they would not be public schoolmasters. Catholic schoolmasters
with the immense traditions of the Church behind them may try to
shape boys to a preconceived pattern, but not the English public
schoolmaster. His boys are too strong and well-connected for him to
impose a type. His action is negative. He lets a type happen. His
results lie not in what he imposes but in what he permits. He
surrounds his boys with an atmosphere in which "good form" is
better than great achievement. He infects with his habitual, his
tacit, disparagement of exhaustive performance. Intensity or
concentration of interest he marks as priggishness, as unhealthy,
as presumption. New and stirring things are belittled&mdash;because
if they are not belittled the humiliating question arises, "Why
then are you not taking part in them?" Persistently the suggestion
is conveyed to the boys that the great things of life are shams and
only the little things are real. There is a fatal responsiveness in
boys to such treatment. Boys who will resist commands and
prohibitions with the utmost vigour and persistence yield with
extraordinary ease to a sneer. So he restrains the criticism of
life; deflects attention from all strenuous issues towards
formality and convention, in politics, in economic assumptions, in
religion. F or religion, the hushed voice, the averted mind. For
sex, darkness. "Pigs' stuff." The world is full of things one does
not do, one does not speak about.</p>

<p>And his teaching! The public schoolmaster is in temperamental
sympathy with just that intractability, that hatred to being taught
and changed, which is natural to recalcitrant youth. He is the
natural ally of the unenterprising boy against the boy who may make
the pace too hard for the two of them. None of that at Dimbourne.
He is doing nothing in the world but teaching, but how can one
teach with any vigour unless one also does the thing one teaches
and does it well? Who can teach mathematics who never deals with
forms and quantities in real earnest, or a language if there is no
attempt at expression? So he does not teach with vigour. He is
bored and he bores. He bores apologetically. "You fellows do not
like this stuff, nor do I. But it's the Right Thing to do
it"&mdash;in a certain fashion. It doesn't <i>mean</i> anything, of
course, but "the grind"&mdash;the grind, he calls it, "is good for
you."</p>

<p>He flies from the classroom to the playing fields. There he has
his strength as a man to exact a kind of respect for himself, from
himself and the rest of them. "Well hit, Sir! <i>Oh! Well hit</i>!"
One can forget one's contemporaries then who are struggling up to
economic and political power, who are going about the great world
outside, doing considerable things. There are some splendid moments
after all for the schoolmaster. When his heart swells near to
bursting for the dear old school. When he is popular about some
petty issue, the Tuck Shop question or the Summer Camp, and the
boys stand up and cheer. He composes himself to look modest and
even a little ruffled. But how fresh, how honest is that schoolboy
approval, bass and tenor and alto all together! "Three cheers for
Mr. Walpole Stent. Hip. Hip. Hooray!"</p>

<p>These boys have an instinct. Many of these "painter fellows,"
these "much-belauded writers," these old scientific moles, never
get such a cheer throughout their entire lives. Unless they come
down to us for Speech Day and we incite the boys about them.</p>

<p>There is the real schoolmaster. I do not blame the man for being
what he is, a retarding shadow upon the best youth of our country;
he achieves his self-respect against great difficulties, and I
would gladly leave him alone in his self-satisfaction if it were
not for the manhood he arrests. But I do not see how we of the new
order of things can be content to see our sons, our nephews, bright
boys of every origin, every sort of boy who is to be given
opportunity, the majority of our successors, left to his dwarfing
restrictions for want of a better routine. So long as we pass our
youth through the sieve of the public schools, we shall find them
triturated down to his dimensions, and the "rank outsider" will
still be needed to save us by his unimpaired initiatives. Dickon
and I, like so many men in business and public affairs in England,
are outsiders, but I do not hold a brief for the outsider as a
class. They have faults all of their own, a huge carelessness,
Wastefulness, inco-ordination. Is not all this book about their
faults? But at least they were not partially paralysed by growing
up under the shadow of subconsciously futile men.</p>

<p>So there appears a third integral part of a creative revolution
in my world, parallel with the gradual creation of a liberal world
press, and equal in importance to the systematic replacement of
militant ideals by police ideals: the development of a boldly
conceived new education and a release of the main supply of our
directive and progressive youth from the cramping influence of
these establishments. All this sending apart of young people, out
of our homes and affairs, to acquire an attitude of supercilious
evasiveness towards living and progressive things, makes directly
for stagnation and reaction. The best education for reality is
contact with reality.</p>

<p>I can understand parents who live in an evil climate or lead
disorderly lives or ply some disgraceful trade, sending their sons
and daughters out of their surroundings into a better atmosphere,
but not men and women pursuing active and influential careers,
directing interesting industries, promoting important economic and
social developments. I do not see how we can at one and the same
time believe in ourselves and in the public schoolmasters. If our
homes and businesses are not fit for our children to live through,
it seems to me that a change in the spirit and direction of our
home and business life is indicated. "We should in that case mend
our manners or our morals. If I had had sons I would have seen to
it that they were first and foremost Clissolds and not
"Dimbournians." I might have entrusted them to Sanderson at Oundle,
but I know of no other school to which I would have delegated my
paternity.</p>

<p>I would have us recover all this "formation of character" work,
all the cultivation of taste, the interpretation of history and the
establishment of standards of conduct and aim, out of the hands of
these "upper class" schoolmasters into which they have so largely
drifted in Britain and western Europe and into which they seem to
be drifting in America. And reduce these all too influential
pedagogues to their original and proper function of the skilled
teaching of specific things. If they proved&mdash;which is by no
means certain&mdash;to be equal to the skilled teaching of specific
things. We want skilled teachers badly, but the fewer schoolmasters
we have the better. The world, and the social atmosphere it throws
around us, is the final maker of all of us. When it was barbaric
and dangerous, then there was some excuse for making little refuges
and fostering places for civilised traditions and learning, under
monastic sanctions. They gave a narrow and cramping education but
it was better than none. Men like Saint Benedict and Cassiodorus,
indeed, saved European learning, but that is no reason why we
should go to Subiaco or the fastnesses of Monte Cassino now to
learn to read and do sums. Now that the world grows safe and
orderly and decent there is less and less justification for
withdrawing young people from the general life in order to equip
them for that general life.</p>

<p>A good case is to be made out for the well-equipped, skilfully
conducted, sociable Kindergarten for a dozen or a score of
children, against the home with only one or two. I do not think
that childhood is the period when close contact between parent and
child is most advisable. And since many of us now move about the
world very freely and since social life increases in the variety of
its relationship, there may be excellent reason for a great use and
extension of schools of the ((preparatory" type, as they call them
in England, schools, often largely staffed by women, and not very
big, where little fellows between seven and fifteen live a
quasi-family life. But from fifteen onward the more directly a boy
lives in contact with the real world the better alike for the real
world and himself.</p>

<p>Then it is that the tradition of his family or the achievements
of his parents may become of interest to him, and he may benefit by
learning what these beings, so exceptionally like himself, think of
life, and how they have dealt with it before him. By fourteen or
fifteen special aptitudes should be apparent, and a boy should
begin to work hard in some technical school according to his
intentions and interests and quality. But if possible he should
live at home. He should begin to see something of his father's life
and his family business. There is a tremendous leap forward in the
capacity of a boy's mind between fourteen and sixteen which the
English public schools, retaining boys to eighteen or nineteen, do
not recognise and help powerfully to arrest.</p>

<p>The boy's sister should be active upon parallel lines. They
should both be reading widely, listening and talking freely in a
community in which the boy will habitually encounter adult minds
and girls and women, and the girl, men. They should go to special
schools for special ends. Not even in these special schools should
the boy meet Walpole Stent or sniff the wind of his frowsy
study.</p>

<p>What will happen to Walpole Stent in a modernised world I do not
know and I do not care. He might make a good timekeeper in a
factory. The teachers of the modern specialist schools will not be
the residuum of a social class, but specially equipped men of any
social origin, and they will actually teach what they profess to
teach. Their business will be what old Sanderson called "tool
sharpening"; mathematics, scientific processes, languages; and the
only moral influence they will exert in their classrooms will be
the best moral influence of all, the one our public schools most
frequently omit, the example of work seriously and vigorously
done.</p>

<p>When one turns either in England or in France from the old
schools, the upper class schools with a long tradition, to the new
popular schools for elementary instruction, sustained by the state,
that have become numerous in the last century, one comes upon
entirely different psychological processes. The two sorts of
schools are different worlds. These latter schools were carefully
planned to supply a certain necessary minimum of education to the
working-classes without any disturbance of class relationships.
They made no pretence of character forming; that they were given to
understand from the first would be presumption; their business was
to supply a carefully limited amount of instruction. They were
designed to preserve a sense of inferiority in their pupils. Not
even the residuum of the universities was cheap enough to staff
them and a special sort of teacher was evolved, trained in a
specially cheap and inferior college, or trained only by service
under a trained assistant. These elementary teachers also were to
be humble and industrious. They were to be pursued in their work by
inspectors of a higher social class, and docked in their pay at any
signs of slackening. So, without any serious rise in wages or loss
of social discipline, it was hoped that a more intelligent type of
workers would be bred. Even then, the dear old Victorians were
astounded at their generosity in supplying these schools, and there
was considerable repining at the idea of educating "other people's
children."</p>

<p>But a better knowledge of psychology might have made our
Victorians doubt the sustained subservience of these elementary
teachers. In the main they were drawn from the working-class; they
were the clever boys and girls who were not quite strong enough to
be put to wages-earning early. They saw in the educational service
a door to the life of an educated human being, and when they found
themselves confronted by bars and barring prejudices to any ascent
from the elementary schoolroom, when they realised the
insufficiency of their pay for any cultivated way of living and the
insulting cheapness of their educational opportunities, they
displayed a certain resentment at the blessings conferred upon
them. They were often individuals of considerable energy. While the
secondary and upper-class teachers were essentially a residuum,
these were essentially an elite. And drawn from a very numerous and
hitherto untapped stratum. They had a vulgar energy. They refused
to be suppressed. An expanding number struggled up to degrees in
the new universities as external students. Many of them became, and
many of them are, better teachers than the upper-class masters and
mistresses. Many have clambered off into journalism, literature,
and all sorts of quasi-intellectual occupations. Many pass on into
the upper-class schools, and infuse a new vigour into their
classrooms. Sanderson for example. Few are as gracefully
subservient as those who evoked them hoped they would be.</p>

<p>A lively social insubordination is as characteristic of the more
intelligent trained elementary teacher as a discouraging
conservatism is of his unskilled social superior. In England the
elementary teachers supply a contingent to the Labour Party which
brings in a disciplined mental vigour it might otherwise lack, and
in France there would hardly be such a thing as a Communist party
if it were not for the teachers. But in Britain elementary
schoolmasters are to be found in all sorts of positions. There is
quite a bunch of ex-elementary teachers in the House, and, for
example, G. E. Morgan, who practically runs our labour affairs at
Downs-Peabody, was one. They constitute a very miscellaneous body
in Great Britain; there is, I am told, a frightful fringe of barely
qualified cheap teachers in the backward rural districts, but on
the whole they are a new and increasingly important force in public
life, and I am all for making them, and not the Walpole Stents, the
backbone of the teaching profession of the future.</p>

<p>Above the elementary schools&mdash;which will run parallel for a
time with our Kindergartens and our excellent preparatory schools
until these become good enough for us to dispense with any
educational differences of class&mdash;we who possess the power of
financial initiative can do much to develop a new system of special
schools, studios, and laboratories, for arts, sciences, languages,
and every sort of technical work. The style of work will be new. We
want nothing of the classroom methods, the "prep," the recitations,
and all the other monkish devices the old schools have preserved.
And it is to the sources that have given us the elementary teacher
and not to the exhausted cadres of the universities that we must
look for the staffing of these modern institutions with
modern-spirited teachers. Even then it will be a teaching
profession much more limited in its pretensions and much sounder in
its work than is the schoolmaster, as prosperous English people
know him to-day.</p>

<p>The reality of education for every one over fourteen in a modern
state lies more and more outside any classroom. The world grows
more explicit every year. The finest minds in the world can speak
now almost directly to everyone. A copious and growing literature
about life and the direction of life makes the personal director
unnecessary. The fewer the school-made values a boy has, the juster
will be his apprehension of reality. So far as the general business
of education goes, beyond mere special drillings and instructions,
the need for schools dwindles to the vanishing point. So that I am
rather an educational gaol-deliverer than a school reformer. I do
not so much want to alter and improve the schoolmaster as induce
him as gently as possible, and with the fullest recognition of his
past services to mankind, to get out of the path of
civilisation.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-15" name="b5-15"></a>§ 15. AN INQUEST ON
UNIVERSITIES</h2>

<p class="first">I EXTEND my scepticism about schools to
universities, and particularly to what one might call the
universities for juveniles like Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and
Yale, the annual cricket, boat-race, baseball, and football
universities, where every sort of intellectual activity is
subordinated to a main business of attracting, boarding and amusing
our adolescents. I think that we who deal with the world's affairs
have been very negligent about the things that have been done to
our sons and daughters in these institutions, and that we need to
give them more attention than we have shown hitherto. In England
they are not giving value for the money and respect they
get&mdash;less even than public schools&mdash;and in America I have
a suspicion they are worse even than in England.</p>

<p>My observations of these places are necessarily external. Dickon
and I were under no sort of discipline during our student days in
London; London University knows no proctors, and its undergraduates
are as free in their private lives as errand boys. No tutors brood
over their intellectual development; the London crowd scatters and
absorbs them before they can develop consciousness of themselves as
a class and a type. They never become aware of themselves as local
colour and feel no consequent obligation to be sprightly and
entertaining and characteristic. We took our university on the way
to other things; we scarcely thought of it as a university; it
stamped no pattern upon us.</p>

<p>My nephew Dick had two years at Oxford, and his career there was
cut short by the war, so he too is no more than a partial witness.
William refused stoutly to go either to Oxford or Cambridge. He
said that he wanted to paint like a man from the start, and that at
either place he would have to think and talk about painting and
paint like a clever boy. When he was told that one went to a
university to rub shoulders with one's fellows and exchange ideas,
he said one exchanged nothing better than shibboleths. He thought
he was quick-witted enough to pick up shibboleths as he went along
without wasting three years upon their acquisition. When the
advantages of meeting distinguished men were pointed out to him, he
said first of all that dons were not as a class distinguished men,
they were only men who had conferred distinctions upon one another,
and secondly that in practice one never met them but only their
"damned wives" at tea parties. The really distinguished men at
Oxford and Cambridge were always "cutting up to London" at every
possible opportunity, to get out of the "dried boy" atmosphere. One
was much more likely to get talks with them in London. "Dried
boys?" Interrogated on this remarkable phrase, William asked what
else one could call them?</p>

<p>"And I shouldn't be able to stand the Rags," said William. "The
Rags that are such a Delightful Feature of undergraduate life. The
dressing-up and the oh! such fun! When the little bleaters started
a rag I should want to go out and kill some of them."</p>

<p>So William, in accordance with the dictates of his savage
Clissold heart, took up his abode in Chelsea, to prowl in studios
and see men at work, to argue in the 1917 Club with all sorts of
queer people, to write, to paint, to see all the new plays and
pictures and dances so soon as they came out, to brood in museums
and read voraciously, and to paint and again to paint.</p>

<p>I'm all on William's side. I believe that the day of Oxford and
Cambridge as the main nuclei of the general education of a great
empire, draws to an end. Since the war this has become very
evident. These universities fail to do any adequate educational
work upon the larger part of the youngsters who spend what are
perhaps the cardinal years of their lives in their colleges. Only a
minority do sound work. They do it against the current of
opinion.</p>

<p>Much of it they could do far better in closer touch with London
or in any other habitable town. Both Oxford and Cambridge lie in
low river valleys, the heavy air demands much time out of every day
for exercise, and a vast industry of games has grown up to
overshadow all intellectual activities. In spite of such exertions,
there is a prevailing slackness. There is a tradition of
irrelevance, which only the most resolute workers escape. Much time
is given to "Rags," those industriously organised, toilsomely
humorous interruptions of the leisurely routines of study. There is
no effective supervision by the tutors who are supposed to guide
the mental growth of the undergraduates, and a considerable number
of these youngsters waste their time in little musical and dramatic
societies that lead neither to musical nor to dramatic achievement,
and in similar forms of amateurism. Such opportunities for
frittering away time are endless.</p>

<p>Few of the dons are of a quality to grip the undergraduate
imagination. Many of the most conspicuous seem to be wilful
"Freaks" who set out to be talked about. Nowadays these dons seem
more disposed to carry on the traditions of discouragement and
suppression that dominate the great English public schools than to
excite a new generation to vigorous thought and effort. Cambridge
University earned an unenviable notoriety during the war by its
treatment of Bertrand Russell, and it has recently done its best to
dismiss a great biological teacher because he was corespondent in a
divorce suit. Oxford, I see, proposes to send down all youthful
communists. By such tokens these places put the repressive training
of the young above knowledge and freedom of thought.</p>

<p>I encounter a growing discontent with Oxford and Cambridge among
many of my friends who have had undergraduate sons. I know three or
four who have been bitterly disappointed in reasonable hopes. They
send their boys trustfully and hopefully to these overrated
centres. They find themselves confronted with pleasant, easy-going,
evasive young men, up to nothing in particular and schooled out of
faith, passion or ambition.</p>

<p>I think we must be prepared to cut out this three or four year
holiday at Oxford or Cambridge, and their American compeers, from
the lives of the young men we hope to see playing leading parts in
the affairs of the world. It is too grave a loss of time at a
critical period; it establishes the defensive attitude too firmly
in the face of the forcible needs of life. I offer no suggestions
about the education of girls because I know very little about it,
but the conviction has grown upon me in the last few years that as
early as fifteen or sixteen a youth should be brought into contact
with realities and kept in contact with realities from that age on.
That does not mean that he will make an end of learning then, but
only that henceforth he will go on learning&mdash;and continue
learning for the rest of his life&mdash;in relation not to the
"subjects" of a curriculum, but to the realities he is attacking.
We are parting from the old delusion that learning is a mere phase
in life. And all the antiquated nonsense of calling people
bachelors and masters and doctors of arts and science, might very
well go with the gowns and hoods that recall some medical alchemist
or inquisitor, to limbo. They mean nothing. There is no presumption
that a man who has the diploma, or whatever they call it, of M.A.,
is even a moderately educated man. The only good thing I have ever
heard in defence of a university gown is that it is better than a
tail-coat for cleaning chalk off a blackboard. And even for that a
pad of velvet is better.</p>

<p>One may argue that to clear out the colleges and disperse the
crowds of spoilt and motiveless youth that now, under a pretence of
some high and conclusive educational benefit, constitute the
physical bulk of Oxford, Cambridge, Yale and Harvard, is not to put
an end to universities; but the value of that argument depends upon
the meaning we assign to the word university. No doubt the modern
world requires an increasing number of institutions conducting
research, gathering and presenting knowledge, affording
opportunities for discussions and decisions between keenly
interested men, working perpetually upon the perpetually renewed
myriads of interrogations with which the intelligent adult faces
existence; but are such institutions, without teaching pretensions,
really universities in the commonly accepted sense of the word at
all?</p>

<p>A whole book might be written about the varying uses of that
word. In one sense the Royal Society of London might be called a
university, but it seems to me that in ordinary speech "university"
conjures up first and foremost a vision of undergraduates engaged
in graduation, a scene of caps and gowns, brightly coloured hoods
and scarlet robes, of learned doctors who are supposed to have
imparted their precious accumulations to the receptive youth at
their feet, and of candidates, shaken and examined when full,
certified to "know all that there is to be knowed" and sent into
the world, in need of no further intellectual process for the rest
of their lives except perhaps a little caulking. That is the
current idea of a university, embalming the artless assumptions of
an age that passes. It seems to me that age may very well take its
universities with it&mdash;into history.</p>

<p>The new institutions, the research and post-graduate colleges if
you cling to the word, will offer no general education at all, no
graduation in arts or science or wisdom. The only students who will
come to them will be young people who are specially attracted and
who want to work in close relation as assistants, secretaries,
special pupils, collateral investigators, with the devoted and
distinguished men whose results are teaching all the world. These
men will teach when they feel disposed to teach. They will write,
they will communicate what they have to say by means of conferences
and special demonstrations, and their utterance will be worldwide.
There is no need whatever now for anyone to suffer and inflict an
ordinary course of lectures again. The new institutions for the
increase of knowledge will become the constituent ganglia of one
single world university, and a special press and a literature of
explanation and summary will make the general consequences of their
activities accessible everywhere. The modern university, as Carlyle
said long ago, is a university of books. So far as general
education is concerned I agree entirely with that.</p>

<p>There it is that we to whom power is happening are still most
negligent. It is not merely that we have great possibilities of
endowment, we have also great opportunities of organisation. As the
prestige of tradition and traditional institutions fades, an
immense desire for knowledge and for new sustaining ideas spreads
through the world. There are millions of people, half educated and
uneducated, vividly aware that they are ill-informed and
undirected, passionately eager to learn and to acquire a sense of
purpose and validity. This new demand for information, for
suggestion and inspiration, is perceptible now not only in the
Atlantic communities but increasingly in India, in China, in
Russia, and in the Near East. We make no concerted effort to cope
with it. We allow it to be exploited meanly for immediate profits.
Much absolute rubbish is fed to this great hunger, and still more
adulterated food. This appetite, which should grow with what it
feeds on, is thwarted and perverted.</p>

<p>It rests with us, the people with capital and enterprise, to
treat this phase of opportunity with a better respect, to show a
larger generosity in the promotion and distribution of
publications, to use the great new possibilities of intellectual
dissemination that arise worthily and fruitfully. The world
university must be a great literature. We cannot have our able
teachers wasting and wearying their voices any longer in the
lecture theatres of provincial towns; we want them to speak to all
the world. And it must be a literature made accessible by
translation into every prevalent language. Each language and people
will still produce its own literature, expressive of its own
aesthetic spirit and developing its own distinctive possibilities,
but the literature of ideas must be a worldwide literature
sustaining one worldwide civilisation.</p>

<p>To this sustaining contemporary literature in its variety and
abundance our young people of all classes must go for their general
conception of life, and throughout all their subsequent lives they
will follow it and react to it and develop mentally in relation to
it. Such personal teaching of adolescents as will remain in the
world will direct their attention to what is being written and
said, and will advise and assist in study and selection. That in
effect is the real upper education of to-day, that is how we are
being kept alIve as a thInkIng community now. Apart from the
modicum of technical instruction they impart, the upper schools and
universities of our world already betray themselves for an
imposture, rather delaying, wasting and misleading good intentions,
rather using their great prestige and influence in sustaining
prejudice in favour of outworn institutions and traditions that
endanger and dwarf human life, than in any real sense educating.
They are the most powerful bulwarks, necessarily and inseparably a
part, a most vital and combative part, of that declining order
which our revolution seeks to replace from the foundations
upward.</p>

<p>Here as with monarchy and militant nationalism we do not need so
much to attack as to disregard and neglect, to supersede and
efface, through the steadfast development of a new worldwide
organism of education and intercourse, press, books,
encyclopaedias, organised translations, conferences, research
institutions.</p>

<p>A time must come when Oxford and Cambridge will signify no more
in the current intellectual life of the world than the monastery of
Mount Athos or the lamaseries of Tibet do now, when their colleges
will stand empty and clean for the amateur of architecture and the
sight-seeing tourist.</p>

<p>Perhaps effigies wearing gowns and robes will be arranged in the
Senate House to recall the quaint formalities of the ancient days.
Or perhaps a residue of undivorced soundly orthodox and
conservative dons will by that time have ossified into suitable
effigies.</p>

<h2><a id="b5-16" name="b5-16"></a>§ 16. LIBERALISM AS
SIMPLIFICATION</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE now sketched out the main lines of my hopes
and sympathies in relation to the economic, social, and political
processes of my time. This book is primarily autobiographical and
not a dissertation upon politics, and I tell of these things
without detachment because they are a part of me, because they are
the subject of a large proportion of my waking thoughts and
determine my acts and the lay-out of my days more and more. This
conception of an open conspiracy to realise the World Republic is
the outline into which I fit most of my social activities. It is as
much a part of me as my eyesight or my weight. I have tried to show
not only the character of this outline, but how it has grown up in
my mind.</p>

<p>This Fifth Book which now draws to its close&mdash;though I feel
there is much that needs expansion in what I have set
down&mdash;may be taken, I suggest, as a statement of
twentieth-century liberalism. The statements of liberalism made in
recent years, because of its entanglements with political factions
and their transitory accommodations, have been formless and
rhetorical, but liberalism is quite a definable thing, and I am by
any possible definition a liberal type. I am as much a liberal as I
am a Londoner or an industrialist or a Fellow of the Royal Society.
It is a fundamental fact in any description of me.</p>

<p>Liberalism is essentially a product of the last two centuries
and mainly of the last hundred years. It is an attempt to express
in thought and social and political activities, the apprehension of
urgent readjustments produced by the change in scale. It began
therefore largely as a system of denials, as a repudiation of
existing authority, of privilege, of dogma, of tradition. Its first
profession Was freedom; its first-fruits upheaval. It found its
natural exponents in the new social types in business men, in
lawyers, in shipping people, in western industrialism. It talked
republicanism. It sought help against established things among the
excluded; it emancipated, it enfranchised. It stirred up subject
peoples by "sympathising with their aspirations." From the first it
was in conflict with national as well as social restrictions. It
allied itself with the internationalism of Jewish finance. It
evolved the idea of free trade.</p>

<p>In contact with things political it lost its way here and there.
In Britain it was exploited by the Tory-spirited Gladstone, in
France by Napoleon the Third. It was baffled by Trades Unionism. It
could make nothing of, and it ought to have made a great deal of,
this collateral synthetic process that was substituting a
collective bargain for a chaotic scramble for work. Its advocacy of
insurgent peoples made it presently a champion of nationalities and
the instigator of pseudo-liberal nationalism in Germany and Italy.
That pseudo-liberal nationalism, has brought forward thorns of
swords and bayonets and bitterly unattractive fruits. Moreover
British liberalism became curiously imperialist at the end of its
shipping lines, though even in India for a time it sought to
educate and modernise, and promised to release. It got on in the
world and made compromises with the Crests.</p>

<p>Already by the days of the Franco-German war of 1870, it had
assumed something of its present loose amiable indeterminate cast
of countenance; it was getting its Asquith face. But it still held
stoutly to free trade, to <i>popular</i> education, to free speech,
to the open mind in religion.</p>

<p>It had unhappily pinned itself prematurely to an extreme freedom
of private property, to the philosophy of Individualism, and it was
perplexed when the socialists appeared with their idea of a
large-scale non-competitive business organisation of society. They
had got in front upon the constructive path by another route. In
the subsequent controversies neither liberalism nor socialism
succeeded in keeping more than a one-sided grasp upon the processes
of economic and social developments. I have told how Dickon and I,
typical adventurers of the new sort, typical cadets of the new
scale, were puzzled in our student days by these conflicting
statements. The history of our experiences and ideas, as I have
spread it before the reader, is the history not merely of the
struggle of our two minds but, in our two selves as samples, of the
general practical intelligence of our generation, to get a
comprehensive grip upon the main issues of our time.</p>

<p>This new statement of liberalism I am making here is the
outcome. What we think, many other men, in business and public
affairs, are beginning to think also. As I have written in an
earlier section, individualism and socialism have reached a phase
of coalescence and rephrasing. Political liberalism dies to be born
again with firmer features and a clearer will.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how much of the liberalism of the middle
nineteenth century is still living in our minds, in a fuller and
more co-ordinated form. We two at least have returned to its
republicanism and its cosmopolitanism. We realise ever more fully
the fundamental importance of free speech, freedom of belief,
freedom from barriers of privilege and adverse presumption. We can
be bolder now in our cosmopolitanism because we have before our
eyes a whole series of successful international experiments. We
have a firmer apprehension of the means and methods by which the
progressive transformation of human affairs towards the World
Republic may be achieved. Our faith in progress has seventy years
of added justification.</p>

<p>Essentially the project of modern liberalism is an immense
simplification. For a century liberalism has been like the spirit
of a young giant striving against almost intolerable bonds, bonds
in which he was born and which cripple and threaten his growth and
existence. Its main purpose is to clear away an infinitude of
complications that trouble and waste life. It is creative by
release, like the chisel of a sculptor. It sets its face against,
and in the long run it will overcome and efface, the boundaries,
the flags, the enforced and exaggerated separations that keep men
from wholesome and brotherly co-operation round and about the
world. It would smooth out every kink and every dark place in which
greed, suspicion, cruelty, and evil disposition can now find a
purchase and operate and do harm to the human commonweal. To that
end it would sweep away all the custom houses, passport
requirements and all the barriers that far beyond nature's
limitations cramp and confine human activities and human commerce
upon this little planet. It would make the money and credit system
of the world one; it would put the land and sea transport of the
world under one control; it would watch over the production and
distribution of staple needs everywhere. It would rationalise the
property-money complex that holds us all together, by scientific
analysis and systematic law-making in accordance with that
analysis. It would bring all men under a common law. It would
recrystallise the political life of the world as a single economic
and police directorate. It would remove crowns and courts and all
the residue of the warring states of the past as a discreet surgeon
will remove an appendix, because mischief lodges in these things.
And in the place of our little ancient secluded learning-places, in
the place of knowledge given almost furtively by word of mouth,
there would be a released education, a great common literature, and
universally accessible information, bringing all mankind into one
understanding and a broad unanimity of will.</p>

<p>I have told how the conception of this simplification of human
affairs grew up in my own mind, and what forces seem to me to drive
towards it, making it not only possible but probable and necessary.
I have painted my own mental and moral portrait against its only
appropriate background, which is two hundred years of change of
scale and the dawn of human unity. Believing in that progressive
simplification and in the progress of man's spirit that will
accompany it, I can take life serenely, I can find a purpose in my
activities outside myself. This simplification, this clearing of
the ground for a new beginning in the human adventure, makes effort
seem worth while. But if now I lost the faith that has grown in me
with my ripening, in the continuing power of these synthetic and
creative processes, I confess that there would be little savour
left for me in life. Without the idea of progress life is a
corrupting marsh. If this present age is not an assembly for great
beginnings, confused and crowded still but getting into order, then
it is a fool's fair, noisy, tawdry, unsafe, dishonest, infectious.
In spite of the strange light of beauty that falls at times upon
it, in spite of incidental heroisms and relieving humours and the
fun of first pushing one's way into it, it is a fool's fair,
speedily wearying and at last repelling. The small insecure
accumulations of science, the rare perfect art one finds in odd
corners, unless they are to be recognised as mere intimations of
greater things to come, are out of all measure insufficient to
redeem so vast a futility. I should be glad to get out of the glare
and turbulence of so unmeaning a spectacle, and I should not be
particular what way I took back to nothingness and peace.</p>

<p>I have passed through deep moods of doubt and I am still not
altogether immune to them. But these moods of doubt have always
come in phases of fatigue, or when there was a great noise about me
and when I was too close to things. It is disconcerting at times to
read too many newspapers. They make life seem entirely a clam our
of superficialities; they make it seem impossible that any men
anywhere will ever think more than a week or so ahead in regard to
public matters. There is only one newspaper that comforts my soul,
and that is <i>Nature</i>. This place up here is good for
retirement and thought, but there is a terrible infection of
vacuity about the faces and bearing of all these well-to-do
fellow-countrymen who crowd Cannes and the front at Nice. When my
business or some rare social occasion takes me down to these
places, I have to resist the suggestion that within my brain I am
perhaps a wild, fantastic, almost scandalous rebel, a "crank," a
changeling, and that it would become me better as an Englishman of
standing to put away Clementina privily and all these solicitudes
for the republic of mankind, and to go down to Cannes and take up
the quarters proper to my position, deport myself stiffly and
carefully, talking about Suzanne and Miss Wills and polo and the
fall of the franc and the severity of taxation in suitable terms,
relaxing myself with bridge, and exercising myself with golf and
elderly tennis until my time comes to an end. Instead of spending
these days of sunshine and these nights of beauty in mental toil,
in plotting, planning, writing and rewriting. Because, says the
devil of that despondent mood, think I never so hard and work I
never so well, these people will never understand, cannot
understand; they will live and die, a mass against such solitary
fretting sports as I, firmly sustaining all that I condemn and
giving the lie to all my prophesying.</p>

<p>The other day I went to Marseilles, and as I sat with Clementina
taking our coffee, after lunch, at the big cafe in the Cannebière
and watched the active various crowd about me, each individually
brighter than I, and all sanely intent upon little things, and all
doing these little things so much better than I could do them, it
came to me with overwhelming force that it was as reasonable to
anticipate one planetary will from such beings as from a canful of
small frogs in summer. I had some French newspaper in my hand
telling me of the eighth or ninth failure of the petty inveterate
political groups in Paris to pass a possible budget, and that the
Treaty of Locarno, so recent, so hopeful, was already in effect
moribund, poisoned by petty disputes about the entry of Germany
into the League of Nations. That had set the key of my
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Achieve!" said I. "They do not even desire. The republic of
mankind is a dream."</p>

<p>But here in this secluded peaceful place and especially at night
when everything is still, one can take a larger view, see things
upon the scale of history, see the wide-sweeping radius of destiny
tracing its onward path across the skies. Then change has a
countenance of purpose, the World Republic like the stars seems
close at hand, and it is the fashions of pose and occupation and
the multifarious ends and conflicts of the hurrying eddying crowds
that dissolve like the mists in the morning and take on the quality
of a dream.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b5-17" name="b5-17"></a>§ 17. FULLY ADULT</h2>

<p class="first">"BUT why should you care for a World Republic you
will never see?" asks Clementina, who has set herself with a
gathering tenacity to understand what I and this book are
about.</p>

<p>"Why should the thought that men will never get to the World
Republic make you unhappy when it does not seem to trouble you in
the least that presently you must die? "</p>

<p>That is a fair question.</p>

<p>Why should I have become almost miserly with my days and hours
in order to work for ends I can never live to see? Why do these
things occupy and compel me so that I forget myself? Why do I not
simply take the means of pleasure that I possess now so abundantly
and "enjoy myself"?</p>

<p>The answer to that runs like a thread through all this complex
fabric of observation and reasoning and suggestion that I have been
weaving. It is that I have grown up.</p>

<p>I have become fully adult in a world in which as yet most human
beings do not press on to a complete realisation of their adult
possibilities. It has happened to me to do so not because there is
anything very exceptional in my quality but because my
circumstances and experiences have prevented my accepting and
settling down to interpretations and routines that are satisfactory
enough to delay and stop the development of the generality of
people. I missed those public-school and university disciplines
which arrest the development of so many of the fortunate minority
at a puerile stage, I escaped from that employment by other people
which robs the greater majority of its opportunities for full
growth, I did not chance to marry happily and settle down to that
family life which becomes as it were a plateau of cessation for
those who live it. I was never so engaged and interested at any
stage by the details of life as to forget my interest in life as a
whole. I went on moving mentally when most other people, according
to the customs and necessities of our world, were either sitting
down of their own accord or being obliged to sit down. And thus
left to the unchecked drive of the forces within me, I went on
growing up.</p>

<p>I have grown at last altogether out of regarding myself as the
prime concern of my life. I am no longer vitally impassioned by my
own success or failure. I have done with my personal career as my
chief occupation. That complete preoccupation with the feelings and
deeds and pride and prospects of William Clissold with which I
started has been modified by and has gradually given place to the
wider demands of the racial adventure. That now grips me and
possesses me. William Clissold dwindles to relative unimportance in
my mind and "Man" arises and increases.</p>

<p>And though William Clissold, my narrow self, will surely die
before any great portion of this present revolution can be
achieved, yet just as surely will man, that greater self in which
my narrow self is no more than a thought and a phase, survive.
Insensibly I have come to think, to desire and act as man, using
the body and the powers of William Clissold that were once my whole
self as a medium. And while all that I do expressly and
particularly for the pleasure, delight and profit of William
Clissold ends, I perceive, and will presently be forgotten and its
refuse put away in some grave, all that I think and attempt and do
as man goes on towards a future that has no certain and definable
end and that need not be defeated by death.</p>

<p>It is only by this conception of a slowly emergent fully adult
phase of the human life cycle that I can explain the main facts of
my own development, the gradual fading out of my childish
intensities of hope and desire and fear, that were once as swift
and fierce and transitory as the moods of an animal, the softening
of my adolescent hardness of spirit, the wane of physical and
worldly jealousies, the attainment of virtual indifference to
happenings that once would have thrown me into furies of
self-assertion, into despair of life or into the profoundest
humiliation. And these things have fallen from me with no
diminution of vitality but through the progressive establishment of
a more disinterested system of passions that were at any earlier
stage altogether outside the orbit of my concern. I have extended
and become less self-centred, year by year. I care for myself less
because I care more and more for the republic of mankind. There
have been and are reversions to passion, to resentments and anger,
to acute personal reference and spasmodic greed, but they become
briefer, rarer and more completely amenable to the growing and
releasing generosity of the wider reference. They become unreal and
unimportant in relation to it.</p>

<p>And what has happened to me can happen to most people. It will
begin to happen to many. My release from my excessive narrow self
is not abnormal; it is only a little unusual at present to this
extent. Most other people could be brought on past the stages of
petty irrelevant occupations and habitual intense self-regard just
as I have been. They all have occasional moods of larger interest.
In a saner, juster, less meanly urgent world those moods would be
sustained, multiplied, connected, and made dominant.</p>

<p>In this present part of my book I have been stating this idea of
a great revolution in the economics and politics and social
relations of mankind, in the form of a project as wide as the
earth. But it could also have been stated in another fashion, in an
older fashion, in the form of a project as narrow and concentrated
as a single heart. The attainment of the World Republic and the
attainment of the fully adult life are the general and the
particular aspects of one and the same reality. Each conditions the
other. The former would release man from traditions, economic
usages, social injustices, mental habits, encumbering institutions,
needless subserviences and puerile interpretations, that dwarf,
confuse and cripple his life upon this planet, that divide it,
impoverish it, keep it in a continual danger from the wasting fever
of war and threaten him with extinction. And the other would
liberate the individual man from a servitude to instinctive
motives, unreasonable obsessions and an embittering concentration
upon personal ends that can have no other conclusion but age and
enfeeblement, defeat, disappointment, and death. In the service and
salvation of the species lies the salvation of the individual. The
individual forgets the doomed and defined personal story that
possessed his immaturity, the story of mortality, and merges
himself in the unending adventure of history and the deathless
growth of the race.</p>

<p>That is my philosophy of conduct, my mysticism, if you will, my
religion. That is my answer to Clementina's question. This is my
final conception of my life as I live it, set in the frame of my
world. To this fully adult state men and women are, I believe,
finding their way through the glares and threats, the misstatements
and absurdities, the violence, cruelties, tumults, and perplexities
of the present time. A few come to it now, doubtfully and each one
alone, as I have done, but presently more will be coming to it. As
they do, the path to the World Republic will open out and this new
phase of human life become the common phase throughout our mounting
race.</p>

<p>We shall put away childish things, childish extravagances of
passion and nightmare fears. Our minds will live in a living world
literature and exercise in living art; our science will grow
incessantly and our power increase. Our planet will become like a
workshop in a pleasant garden, and from it we shall look out with
ever diminishing fear upon our heritage of space and time amidst
the stars.</p>

<p>We shall be man in common and immortal in common, and each one
of us will develop his individuality to the utmost, no longer as a
separated and conflicting being but as a part and contribution to
one continuing whole.</p>

<h2><a id="b6-1" name="b6-1"></a>§ 1. NEED OF ADULT LOVE</h2>

<p class="first">THIS Sixth Book I shall dedicate to women, to the
love and fellowship, distrusts and antagonisms of men and women. I
have not yet done with my Fifth Book, but I shall leave that now
for awhile until I can shape this Sixth Book out. A score of vast
questions have been started and left almost immediately in that
Fifth Book; I must return to them later; but I am impatient, I do
not know why, to see the completed form of my work before I deal
with them further. The immense projection of a unified world
civilisation is at any rate visible in Book Five as it stands. The
great revolution is stated there.</p>

<p>But all such schemes are abstract and jejune until they are made
real by the comprehension of women. Man comes from woman and
returns to woman for confirmation and realisation. He may explore
new worlds alone but he cannot settle, cannot establish himself,
unless he bring his womankind.</p>

<p>My sense of the value of woman, my care for and interest in
woman, has grown very greatly since I was a young man. I began with
infantile dreams of abjection to women, these faded out in boyhood
and gave place to indifference qualified by a hot unkindly lust.
Desire tinged with antagonism was the quality of my adolescence. I
had a considerable dread of losing my personal freedom.
Imperceptibly a strongly suppressed craving for help and
companionship escaped from its suppressions. To-day, though I
struggle against the admission, I find my mental serenity
extraordinarily dependent upon the companionship of Clementina. If
she were to vanish now this life here would collapse. I cannot
estimate how great a tragedy that might not be for me.</p>

<p>I have known many women. I have known several of a masculine
creativeness and vigour of self-assertion. Some of the main
features of the modern view of life, the propaganda of the idea of
birth control, for example, are largely woman's work. And yet I do
not know how far this austere conception of life devoted to the
establishment of a great deliberation in the place of the present
impulsive confusions of the world, can count upon the support and
service of women or how far they will be open antagonists or subtle
opponents or passive, instinctive, or even unconscious
obstructionists of the things we desire.</p>

<p>The revolutionary forces of to-day are at present operating
through scattered individuals. It has been my argument that these
forces cannot become efficient and consciously and securely
dominant without the development of a social life to express and
confirm them. What impresses me very greatly is that the active and
creative men do not as a rule get into relationship with either
actively creative women or with women who can be effective helpers
and protectors and subordinates, and that, so far as I know, the
much rarer women of creative and scientific quality remain single
or are indifferently mated. They seem to think and speak in an
idiom that is different and to have a different idiom of behaviour.
This is not a complaint against the opposite sex&mdash;against
either sex. It is rather a statement that these busy preoccupied
men and women are careless in this relation, are taken unawares,
and do not know how to set about securing themselves against
diversion and wastage. They are the critics and disturbers of the
current world, and the current world, the habitual and accepted
thing, protects itself and takes its unpremeditated revenge upon
them by tying them up to demands, responses, exactions,
obligations, conventions, recriminations, that distress,
disorganise, disappoint, overstrain, and help to defeat them.</p>

<p>I have much reason to be grateful to women, and I have a sense
of ungraciousness in writing these doubts about them. But I cannot
help but recognise the atmosphere of intensifying sexual antagonism
in which we are living. One of the four women who have played large
parts in my life sustains me loyally now; one would have been my
friend and helper had she but had the strength left in her. But of
the two others, one was a disloyal waster of my poor gifts, and the
other a frank and open opponent, who in the end came to use her
power over my emotions very ruthlessly. The story of my married
life, brief, crude and vulgar, as I have told it, is yet very
typical of the conflicts of the time. It is the common
misunderstanding in gross and heavy detail.</p>

<p>I am dissatisfied with my sexual history and my dissatisfaction
quickens my apprehension of the general uneasiness of the sexual
world about me. A great majority of business men and active men of
affairs I know are frittering their sexual interests away as I have
done for most of my life, getting no use or companionship out of
women in their essential lives, marrying wives elegantly aloof from
their vital concerns, begetting sons to be turned over to the old
order by pedagogues and dons, practising small adulteries, having
"affairs" with little dancers, chorus girls, and a miscellany of
such women. It is not what they want if ever they stopped to ask
themselves what they want of that side of life; it is what happens
to them. No sort of woman is developed as yet to respect and look
after them and life has been too unexpected and crowded for them to
be able to look after themselves.</p>

<p>I know that my insistence in this book upon a completely normal
sexual life for an energetic man is a breach of literary decorum. I
shall be called over-sexed, when indeed I am merely normally sexed
and only abnormally outspoken. But our literary standards derive
from schools and universities that have sheltered almost to the
present day the dishonest and inwardly unclean chastity of
mediaeval romanticism. We must, they rule it, either hide or
titter. We must pretend we have no desires or only the very
funniest desires, and that anyhow they do not matter in the least
and have no significance whatever. I decline to follow these
monkish usages and put a fig-leaf upon my account of myself,
because once upon a time certain blushing prelates went round the
Vatican Museum and started such wear for the classical statuary
that had fallen into their hands. I do not believe that a normal
man can go on living a full mental life in a state of sexual
isolation. I refuse to entertain the idea that I should have
accepted celibacy and devoted myself entirely to scientific work.
On those questions our medical science is absurdly discreet and
vague, and so I have to go upon observations that may be greatly
deflected by my temperamental bias. My impression is that
abstinence involves so large an amount of internal conflict) so
urgent and continuous an effort of self-control, such moods and
humiliations and compensatory adjustments) that the diversion of
attention and the wastage of energy are far greater than the
average disturbances and deflections of a normal life.</p>

<p>This is, I am convinced, as true for an ordinary woman as for an
ordinary man. There may be exceptional types released from this
issue altogether in some, to me, unimaginable fashion, and free to
specialise vigorously in creative work. I know none, but it may be
so. Such an unembarrassed chastity is alleged to have been achieved
by various religious mystics of great administrative power, Saint
Theresa and Saint Dominic and Saint Ignatius Loyola for example.
Such a release with unimpaired energy is against all biological
presumptions, and the general tone of celibate priesthoods and
devotional literature suggests not so much release to me as
consuming negative obsession. For most of us sex life is a
necessity, and a necessity not merely as something urgent that has
to be disposed of and got rid of by, for instance, incidental
meretricious gratifications, but as a real source of energy,
self-confidence, and creative power. It is an essential and perhaps
the fundamental substance of our existence. For me and my kind the
house of ill-fame is of no more use than the monastery. My need is
for the respect, friendship, sympathy, and willing help of a woman
or women just as much as for her sexual intimacies. And if you come
to discuss this with a fully developed intelligent woman I believe
she will say of herself exactly what I say of myself. Mate came
before husband, wife or mistress in the story of life, and may
outlast both of these relationships.</p>

<p>Most or all of the men and women who will constitute the main
directive community of this modern world-state towards which human
affairs are moving, must mate happily and live happily mated, if
they are to do their work; and all the social institutions and
moral codes that prevail to-day must continue or change in
accordance with that primary condition. As they become aware of the
distinctive difference of their aims and work, and as their own
sexual life develops, they will evolve their own conception of
restraints, imperatives and reasonable conditions, and fashion a
new code. At present we live sexually in a world of mixed and
broken codes, and irregular and extravagant experiments and
defiances. Most people are doing or pretend to be doing what they
believe to be right in the eyes of their friends and neighbours.
Few people have the courage of their internal want of convictions.
The larger part of the younger generation of educated and
semi-educated people in Europe and America seems to me to have no
sexual morals at all, but only cynical observances, the plain
inevitable result of an atmosphere of manifest shams and
insincerities.</p>

<p>It will be worth while to become historical again here and to go
over the development of prohibitions, customs, traditions, codes,
and conventions that have contributed to our present welter. To
discuss how one has got to a situation is often the way to discover
how to get away from it again. Let us see to what extent this
confusion can be analysed, and find out whether we are being
reasonable or impossible in making this demand for a free society
of mated and co-operative men and women.</p>

<p>It may be that we are asking for the moon, that an insoluble
conflict of interests and instincts exists between men and women,
and that to the end of the story our race must go on, as I have
lived, as most of the people I know are living about me, now
tormented, now delighted, now distracted, now wasted by the
untameable and irreconcilable impulses of sex. Our creative work
can never in that case amount to the sum of our lives, it will be
only what we can rescue from this devouring inheritance of desires
and gratifications that has arisen for us out of the struggle by
which we were made.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-2" name="b6-2"></a>§ 2. THINGS FUNDAMENTAL</h2>

<p class="first">I WRITE of men and women co-operating and mating
on terms of equality. That is our modern idea. But have men and
women ever met on terms of equality?</p>

<p>I am sceptical that there has ever been equality between them.
The greater probability seems to me to be that from the ancestral
ape upward the female of our line has been at much the same
physical disadvantage as most other mammalian females. The sexual
reactions of reptiles, fishes, insects, crustaceans, may follow
lines entirely outside our sympathetic understanding, but the whole
mammalian series has in common the devotion of the female to the
young. The new creature hampers her before its birth, preys upon
her, becomes her parasitic associate, clamours for her protection,
and her instincts respond. The male, less preoccupied, grows to
greater strength, is freer in his movements. He is linked to the
female primarily by desire. Nature in forming the mammal has never
discriminated between the sexes so far as to deny the male and the
female a touch of the acquisitions of the other; most male animals
have a certain maternal tenderness for young things, and hardly any
mammalian female is altogether a slave and sacrifice to breeding;
but the broad distinction holds. I take it that primitive man as
male desired, fought for, dominated and did his best to enslave his
woman and have done with her. Most of us still do that. She
Complied or she evaded; she resisted or submitted. I doubt if she
had much choice or much freedom of initiative. I do not suggest she
was wholly passive, but on the whole the disadvantage was hers.
When he and she were sexually attractive and active that was their
relationship; that was and that is the primary sexual
relationship.</p>

<p>But the life of the primitive men and the sub-men their
ancestors were lives of struggle, and the sexual motive was not
always uppermost. They hunted, and probably he hunted best. She was
generally either immature or nursing or pregnant. She could not
keep up with him, and so she stayed behind. She kept the fire and
kept by the fire. As economic life began, the greater part of the
work WaS not so much thrust upon her as fell upon her. It began
naturally with minding the children and the fire, with tidying the
lair and furnishing the lair. She probably had to gather fruits and
little things. She cooked. She ground the seeds. He made his casual
magnificent exertions, but the first toil was hers. Woman was the
first drudge; the man sat about. But hers was the hearth and home.
That must have been the primary economic relationship of the sexes.
Put an ordinary man and woman together to-day in a hut or a cottage
or a one-roomed tenement, and almost without discussion things
adjust themselves in that spirit.</p>

<p>But there was a third primary relationship of a different sort.
The man and woman were not always in a sexual relationship, male to
female; sometimes he was son and junior, and she was mother and
senior. Then she was his protector. She shielded him from the
jealousy and injustice of his father; she was great and wise in his
eyes, beautiful and kind and helpful. That wove a <i>different</i>
strand of feeling into the complex of relationship. Most male
animals seem to forget that phase, but the comparative helplessness
of the human young lasts so long and memory is relatively so good
in us, that in all their subsequent lives the appeal for feminine
help and kindness lingers in the human being. I can trace that
strand from quite infantile imaginings reappearing, vanishing,
turning up again, throughout my life. And it interweaves with the
two others, so that women at large are at once our seniors and our
juniors. We do not classify them or they us; life is too entangled
for that. They are this to-day and that to-morrow. When a woman
takes a man in her arms she takes a duplex creature, a conqueror
and a refugee. And he holds a queen and a slave. In the Egyptian
mythology, Isis, the Star of Heaven, held the child Horus in her
arms and Osiris was her lord and Horus was Osiris. This remembered
dependence is the primary defence of women; the mitigation of the
material inferiority to which their physical disadvantage subjects
them. The woman resists, evades, submits, but also she aids and
pities and mysteriously she commands respect.</p>

<p>In his intimate relations to a woman, without any planning or
intention but of the necessity of his nature, a man is continually
ringing the changes between these three primary colours of his
emotional palette. And she flashes her own correlated variations.
That much is in our natures. And in our natures also is something
that I think transcends sex, though it is habitually turned to the
uses of sex, and that is our personal abasement before some
shining, lovely, admired and overwhelming person. The dog has this
aptitude for personal worship extravagantly, but man now has it
too.</p>

<p>All these things are natural inalterable factors that We must
respect in perfecting the relations of modern men and women.
Another factor in our make-up that must come in for any sort of
balance to exist between them is comradeship. Comradeship is a
relationship that became emotional I think first between men and
men, in the hunt, in the battle. It has still to enter into the
ordinary tangle between the sexes. Whether it can do so is the most
doubtful question of all. It is not in the established precedents
of nature. Man, we must remember, is now the most social of
animals, and the nearest approach to level mating has occurred
hitherto among the more solitary beasts, lions and tigers and such
great carnivores. Man is in the minority of social animals in his
disposition to pair. None of the economic creatures pair. The
social animals when they are undisturbed by rut, go off peaceably
with their like, the hinds together, the young stags together. But
man is not to be ruled by the practice of the beasts. He has to
work out for himself his own distinctive methods. He is not subject
to their seasons of rut and indifference.</p>

<p>In the past woman was the material and moral inferior of man
mainly because she was so soon and so completely overtaken by the
oppression of sex. Now that in the modern communities she is not so
overtaken, since now she may carry that burthen as lightly as a
man, it is interesting to see how rapidly she approximates to the
freedoms and physical energy of a young man. The Western girl among
the prosperous classes of to-day is far more different in physique
and morale from the young lady of a hundred years ago, than she is
from her brother. And one can think of her as a man's mate and
comrade, as one could never do of the young lady. Perhaps now one
exaggerates the resemblances as formerly one exaggerated the
differences. But I find it possible to imagine a world in which a
large proportion of the leading people will be mated colleagues.
Assimilation can go further than it has gone. I doubt if it will
ever obliterate the feminine disadvantage completely. Still more do
I doubt if there will ever be any essential inversion of the roles.
Typically the man will produce the larger initiatives, and in their
intimacy the pair will realise those balanced reactions of
subjugation and tenderness that come to us from the past.</p>

<p>The world moves from uniformity to diversity, and there will be,
no doubt, a multitude of exceptional cases, and there will be
freedom and tolerance for such exceptions. What I am writing of
here is the prevailing fashion in which the men and women of a
creative energetic type would probably group themselves. And so far
I have been discussing only the natural inherent reactions of men
and women and the common sense necessities of people whose lives
are shaped by the desire for a maximum of creative work in a world
at peace. Directly one turns outward from such speculations, one
faces a world entirely antagonistic to them, a crowded gregarious
world of feverish entertainment, of decoration and displays and
general extravagance, excitements, provocations, pursuits,
jealousies. One finds the companion-mate as a dream in the hearts
of a few people here and there, as an experiment, an almost
hopeless experiment, like a match lit in a high wind or a swimmer
borne away by a stream.</p>

<p>Is it no more than a dream, this conception of an active austere
social life, not crowded with persons, lived much in the company of
a dear associate or so, but generous and free in spirit, and with
interests and activities wide as the world? I do not think it is a
dream. But how can I reconcile this project, this expectation, with
the manifest realities of life to-day? Where, you ask, are these
women, these mates, these men happily mated? Where are these fully
emerged adults?</p>

<p>I cannot point to them; I have never met them; that is indeed my
personal story. I can only foretell them. But I foretell them as I
foretell a coming world control by sane and powerful people. This
world control, gradually becoming evident, will make the flags and
the armies, the rulers and governments, which seem to monopolise
all the concrete realities of our collective life to-day, weaken,
become thin and manifestly unreal, and presently fade very swiftly
out of existence. So too I believe the current social life to-day
will grow transparent and palpably flimsy and suddenly fade in a
few decades out of its present compelling predominance. Our ways of
living are even more provisional now than our governments.
Everybody does this or that to-day which nobody will do to-morrow.
The change in manners and morals, in customs and conventions during
the last half-century has been tremendous, but it may seem nothing
before the changes of the next half.. century. We are living in the
hectic last phase of a dying order.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-3" name="b6-3"></a>§ 3. RULING TRADITIONS</h2>

<p class="first">THE manners and morals, the laws and arrangements
between the sexes to-day, the expectations people have and the
rights they claim in love and marriage constitute now a vast,
dangerous, unhappy confEct and confusion. It has ceased to follow a
code or a system.</p>

<p>It is like a panic, like a debacle. In the past, there have been
stress, suppression and sorrow in sexual life, but never so
chancey, unjust and wasteful a time as this one. It is a state of
affairs in which no one is safe for happiness, and no conduct sure
of success. For most of us there is an obligation to blunder.</p>

<p>I have tried to make out of my observations and experiences some
sort of classification of the medley of tradition,s and guiding
ideas which determine men and women's treatment of one another.
That is a necessary preliminary to any attempt to reach conclusions
in the universal problem. We start complex in these affairs as I
have shown, but that complexity is nothing to the complexity of our
traditions and suggestions. We are always shifting about among
these without realising what we are doing; now we behave in
obedience to one set of values and before we know it we have
changed our course because of a new wind from quite another
quarter. To give the next generation some help in referring their
motive 'ideas in sexual matters to their source is one of the main
educational tasks before those who seek to realise a new and better
phase of human life.</p>

<p>I have not seen much sexual happiness either in my own life or
in the lives of those about me. I have seen much pleasant coming
together and much bright hope, but the usual fate of the
contemporary love-story is that it tarnishes and the colours fade.
I do not believe there is any such natural antagonism of man and
woman as to make disappointment necessary in this, the main affair
of most people's lives. I believe nearly all the jangles and
disappointments of contemporary life can be traced to a confused
unpreparedness of mind, to a profound ignorance of physical and
psychic fact, to fluctuating and impossible expectations and
unjustifiable assumptions about what is right and reasonable and
graceful and honourable in sexual conduct. Out of disappointments
arise resentments, estrangement, malice, cruelty. The contemporary
love-story begins in illusions and goes on by way of
misunderstandings to conflict. It opens cheaply and ends in dispute
or dull resignation.</p>

<p>Certain main classes may be distinguished into which all these
codes, fragments of codes and traditions of sentiment and
expectation which we find determining people's activities, fall.
These classes differ in their fundamental nature, arise from
different strata in our being, are not equivalent dimensions but
things of diverse categories. First one may distinguish and set on
one side all those motives, judgments, ways of taking sexual
things, into which the idea of Sin enters. There is a factor of
fear and repulsion. Of this one can make a first whole class of
ideas. They give us what may be called the Woman of the Sinful Man.
Desire drags against shame and a terrified predisposition to
abstinence. There is an immense exaggeration of chastity. The ideal
woman is a sexless female, helpful, serviceable, but perpetually
virgin and even so a temptation; marriage, though it be consummated
with extreme infrequency after prayer and fasting, amidst austerely
unpleasant details, remains an unclean affair, a lapse from the
better life. These ideals embody fundamentally masculine
conceptions; the man of the sin-conscious woman is a secret that
has never been betrayed in sane literature. But women, with their
extraordinary facility for adapting themselves to
<i>expectation</i>, have produced in response the role of the woman
wholly chaste and unapproachable, have protected themselves
enormously from unwelcome attentions by that impersonation, and
have established an almost inestimable value for such shameful
concessions as they may at last consent to make to the hysterical
importunity of the sinful man in his phases of moral debacle.</p>

<p>Within a lifetime the codes, manners, sentimental systems
centring upon this conception of the sinfulness of sex, prevailed
widely throughout the world. They gave women artificial value and
dignity at the price of incessant restraint. But the great gales of
controversy, that have cleared away so much fear and moral fog from
mankind, have left but little sense of sexual sin in the modern
mind. The covered inaccessible woman, that veiled mysterious
indulgence, is passing out of the general life. The protective
shamming of indifference ceases to be a part of feminine tradition
and training.</p>

<p>Less a code than a body of practice is a second great system of
methods of treatment, the way of the vulgar sensible man and woman,
the secular sexual life of the peasant, the farmer, the little
shop-keeper, the man with a living need for a helper and
confederate. In the settled communities of mankind throughout the
ages, the multitude has lived in a roughly but rationally adjusted
manner, poised in a not unequal fashion, and with the woman as near
self-respect as women have ever got in the whole experience of the
race. She was necessary, she was consulted, she need make no great
attempt either to withhold herself or charm an exacting male. She
could be mother to the full extent of her desires. At times her
wishes in that direction were outrun, but the friendly germs of
infant mortality kept the balance down. No doubt the priest
troubled the couple at times with strange hints of sin and
damnation, troubled but did not disturb profoundly, and no doubt,
too, the law held the woman was man's chattel and would duck or
chastise her spasmodically for small misbehaviours and
disloyalties. But she knew her place and power better than the law;
did she not cook the man's dinner, make his bed, and keep or
shatter his peace and his pride?</p>

<p>For a hundred centuries from China to Peru this common life has
gone on, in which the woman was as necessary and as respected upon
all practical issues as the man. Its real practice&mdash;for like
the English common law it had no code&mdash;was handed down from
woman to woman and imparted by mother to son. Religions may permit
polygamy to the prosperous, as Islam does, or Court or Town
practise the most fantastic tricks; the common life has varied
little from the common formula. The Anatolian peasant is as mated
to his one woman as the Irish farmer. In this country about me the
tradition of the vulgar sensible folk is to be found strained by
new forces, but still vigorous among the jasmine and olive
terraces, in every other <i>mas</i> that the rich Americans and
economising artists and suchlike invaders as Clementina and I have
left intact. It has been so much the life of our species since man
became man, that for anyone without historical perspective it is
easy to call it the immemorial natural life of mankind.</p>

<p>It is nothing of the sort. <i>Panta rhei</i>. That change of
scale which is the present form of human experience as a whole,
invades the vulgar sensible way of living in every practical detail
and in every imagination. The niggling cultivation of the soil in
small patches that was once the only possible basis of the social
structure is becoming economically unsound, and even more is the
toil of the woman being robbed of the dignity of necessity. The
change is visible even here, in neglected olive trees, in crumbling
terrace walls and in the cyclist figures flitting along the paths
at dusk to betray the fact that our typical neighbour is no longer
a cultivator of the soil but a worker in a Grasse factory. These
are new developments here. It is in the suburban homes of the great
towns of our typical England and the United States&mdash;and
England now for the half of its area is no better than a scattered
suburb&mdash;that the change is most fully displayed. The man is
still a worker and even more of a toiler than he used to be, but he
works away. It needs a liberal education for him if he is to
realise the significance and scope of the economic machine in which
he is a cogwheel. And the woman at home has been stripped more and
more of her fundamental economic importance and reduced to the
position of a sexual complement. She knows little or nothing of her
husband's affairs; they are too far away. She does not brew, she
does not bake. She does not so much cook as "warm up." She does not
make her linen or control her house, she merely ('shops" for it.
The gas company is her hewer of wood and the municipality her
drawer of water. She touches a button to light her home. To her own
relief and her husband's and the community's, she ceases to breed,
and such children as she bears are far better educated for her by
the trained teachers in properly equipped schools. Change has
robbed her of her normal employments just as it has released her
and her man from the sense of sin. There she is.</p>

<p>What is she to do with herself&mdash;with herself and her
immensely empty afternoons? What are we to do with her? The
percentage of these Claras increases in all the modern communities.
I am for making boys of them and breaking up these mere empty
shells and shams of suburban households. Let them live in flats and
chambers and have their men come and go until they find a proper
mate and a task they can share with him. Let them be educated and
trained as well as their brothers and put to research and business
and productive work. Let them cease to regard their sex&mdash;I
will not say as a marketable commodity, but as a negotiable right
for which they may secure a comfortable living. And as I think of
some of the girls one sees to-day, short-cropped like handsome
youths, as tall, as energetic and bold as their brothers and often
franker in thought and act, it seems to me that in writing these
things I write with the spirit of the time, of a not impossible
transformation.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-4" name="b6-4"></a>§ 4. ROMANTICISM IN FLOOD</h2>

<p class="first">BUT there is still another main class of ideas and
traditions that have to be taken into account before this survey of
the moral field of force in which women are living is complete.
These are the various romantic and chivalrous traditions that
complicate its issues and confuse most women's minds irreparably
with the suggestion that woman is the queen of beauty, the chief
object of men's lives, the sufficient reward for every conceivable
service and devotion. She is not, she never has been, she never
will be. But these traditions saturate poetic literature; their
roots entangle with the whole history of our race.</p>

<p>The two groups of standards and values we have considered
hitherto correspond to two main ways of living, to the way of
living when misery is abroad and when religious fear predominates,
and to the way of living of the cheerful, laborious, sensible,
settled folk in normal times. For thousands of years the huge
majority of ordinary men have lived with women continually, worked
side by side with them, joked and planned with them, beaten and
caressed them, and regarded them for most practical purposes as
equals and responsible mates. But there has always been a third
sort of man who went apart from women not to brood but to do. This
was the herdsman, the hunter, the warrior, the knight-errant, the
raiding nomad, the desert merchant, the seaman. In his phases of
hardy abstinence came dreams of desire, but they came not with the
quality of sin but with the quality of reward. No more than the
God-fearing saint did he need woman as a companion. She and her
possible litter would cumber the ship and lag upon the trail. But
she was neither on the sea nor in the desert to distract him, and
he did not see her as the saint saw her in the light of an
incessant allurement, defeating his ends. He came back to her,
alive with desire, excitable, with his hands full of spoil and
pay.</p>

<p>There ensues from these lives of departure and return systems of
relationship widely divergent either from those of the sin-haunted
abstainer or the gross habitual familiarities of the accustomed
man. This third type of system may be in its essence far more
ancient than those of the normal settled life. The men of the Old
Stone Age were hunters, and they have left paintings on the Spanish
rocks showing the firelit feasting of a return or a tribal
gathering&mdash;the hunters dancing and showing off, the women
dancing too in poses that exaggerate the contours of their figures
provokingly. The Spanish rock-paintings reflect the self-same
spirit that one would find to-day in a party of Spanish-American or
Anglo-Saxon cowboys come down after a spell of adventure to scatter
their dollars among the women of the town. The men and women meet
excited. The women allure, the men show off, they compete, fight
perhaps for the women, pay and give. Even the gestures of the
Spanish-American dancing are similar to those in the rock
paintings, the arms akimbo, the protruded breasts. There is much
perplexing and wounding with jealousy. The men are in their
brightest garments. The women paint and dress themselves for
vividness and swift effect.</p>

<p>This third great class of sexual relationship in which the man
comes along, goes far away, returns, is, with local variations,
spread over all the world. It is an open-life way since first the
plough began, and probably it has never been the way of more than a
minority of humanity. But it has been a potent minority. The cowboy
tradition prevails over the whole Spanish-speaking world. There it
produces its typical beauty, its typical costume. Love is vivid and
jealous in this life because of the pent-up period of separation.
When the man has won his woman he is apt to demand her seclusion.
The supreme virtue of woman becomes sexual loyalty to the absent
man. Hardly any other is asked of her. "Can she brew or can she
bake?" It matters little. Better a red carnation in her bright
black hair and a shawl drawn tightly over the curves of breast and
hip.</p>

<p>A parallel world of romance, dances, provocations, pursuits,
seclusions, is that of the desert Arab. The Arab keeps his
womankind veiled and in tents. They see nothing. Their housekeeping
is despicable. They do not even sew. A little stenographer with her
bicycle and her tennis in a crowded country like England knows far
more of exercise and the open air than many a young woman in the
vast spaces of the desert. The Arab woman reclines in the sultry
shadows of the tent, planning her captivating allurements against
her one great event, the man's return, his return and his choice.
She brightens her eyes and paints her face and puts on her jewels
and keeps herself supple for the secret dance. If she goes abroad
she must go in state, protected, watched, bedizened with all the
evidences of the man's appreciation. She is his supreme treasure;
the crown of his life. And this triumphant seclusion from dust and
exertion, this life of honour in a place apart, is given her upon
two simple conditions. She must keep faith with her man while he is
away, and she must remain young and attractive. The romantic code
takes little or no cognisance of old, worn, or ailing women.</p>

<p>This third group of codes is begotten of the life of wanderers
and waste places, but its influence reaches far beyond those
limits. It has gone with the sword of the rider&mdash;everywhere.
Since social history began there is a story of conquest and
conquest and again conquest of the settled lands, the cultivated
regions, the towns and cities, by men out of the wastes, out of the
deserts or from overseas. The wanderer has the habit of the upper
hand. He has supplied the rulers, the aristocracies, the
tax-collectors, the landowners, the lordly ones of nearly every
country in the world, and they have kept his standards. The
conquered womenfolk have been quick to mitigate their first
abasement. His assumptions about women have been inevitably
romantic. He cannot play his distinctive role tied to a woman's
apron strings. In the mood of going forth he finds them
encumbrances, and after a phase of solitude they become magically
attractive. They become objects of cupidity and then possession,
animated possessions, richly decorated and pampered possessions,
with hidden souls, whom one must watch jealously. Nobody planned
the codes he follows; he brought the seeds of them with him into
the settled lands; they are his natural reaction to his conditions.
This is his way with women, just as a senior partnership is the
peasant's way and avoidance the way of the sin-haunted soul.</p>

<p>The romantic codes, the codes of the adventurers, have had a
disproportionate influence upon the life of to-day because they
were associated naturally with ruling and powerful people, and so
the poets and singers, the romancers and playwrights found their
interest in observing them. They yielded better stories, with more
colour in them. They carried more decoration. The common life is
uneventful by nature; its good faith and sober industry yield no
such strikingly recordable and transmissible impulses, have no such
epic nor dramatic quality. Yet it is not from the conquerors and
aristocrats and romantic, generous, wasteful figures of the past
that the modern order arises, but from men addicted to creative
toil, from sublimated artisans and skilful makers; and the mates
they need if they are to round off their revolutionary activities
into a new world system, are far more like the free-going, kindly,
smiling, assisting womankind of the peasant and the artificer than
the fascinating houri of the excited cowboy or her exaltation, the
fine lady of the chivalrous tradition.</p>

<p>What has happened in the sexual life of our western communities
during the last two centuries, and which is now becoming worldwide,
can be represented by certain very broad statements about these
three great systems of promise and sentiment. Firstly the economic
revolution, the change of scale in economic operations, has done
much to break up the homely practical equality of commonplace men
and women, by taking one domestic task after another out of the
woman's hands, taking economic realities out of her sight and
understanding, gathering men workers into offices, office
districts, factories, and warehouses, and so reducing the link
between husband and wife down at last to its sexual core. The
increase of knowledge has also lifted the burthen of child-bearing
from the woman. The circumstances of stratum after stratum of women
have approximated more and more to a low-grade, impoverished
reproduction of the leisure and expectancy of the lady of the world
of chivalry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there has been a vast extension of reading and a
cheapening of books. The literary methods have naturally followed
the romantic tradition of the ruling class; for some generations
women of the poorer sort were reading nothing but the cheap
editions and worn library copies originally written and published
at a high price for the gentlefolk, and this amounted in effect to
a most subtle and effectual propaganda of the romantic attitude to
sexual life. There has been a tremendous flooding of the thoughts
and motives of the entire community with these cowboy-chevalier
ideals. Hitherto these ideals had carried little weight in the main
Illiterate mass of the community; even in the upper classes they
had been much restrained and modified by the sin idea and the
defensive dignity that idea enabled many women to assume. But now
the sense of sin was being lifted from the world with the decline
in confidence of those old religious teachings. The theatre, and
to-day with enormous force, the cinema, is confirming the teachings
of the reverie and the novelette. An increasing multitude of girls,
probably a huge majority of them now, in America and western
Europe, is growing up to womanhood with no idea of any sort of
worth-while career except that of the heroine of a love-story with
a powerful, patient, constantly excited and always devoted man.</p>

<p>Unhappily there has been no corresponding increase in the supply
of cowboy-chevaliers and successful sailor adventurers. The young
man who sits beside the thrilling girl in the cinema theatre is
already, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred, a subordinated
young man; he is always going to be rather preoccupied with the
interest and difficulties of the work he has to do, and he is never
going far away to execute wonderful deeds. Still less is he ever
coming back with his hands full of gifts and his eyes full of
crystalline desire. He is doomed, therefore, to be treated as a
second-best thing by a young woman who would, if she were put to
the equivalent test as a heroine, fail to prove herself even
second-rate. He is going to be judged by false standards and
treated upon false assumptions. He may be goaded to spirited acts
that will bring defeat upon him, and to a swagger that will fail to
deceive her trained judgment. Humiliation awaits him, and for her
wait the scurvy reactions of a humiliated man.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how the whole aspect of social life has been
changed since I was a child, by the flooding out of all other
traditions by the traditions of romance. It is visible in the
streets, where once the best part of the women were dowdy and
uneventful. Now every two women out of three call for the man of
spirit, in their provocative clothing, in their conscious assertion
of a cared-for beauty, in their challenging bearing. There have
been times in London in Paris when I have wanted to go along the
gallant streets apologising for myself and my sex. This change of
attitude is evident even in our murders. England has few murders;
it is not a murdering country, but such murders as there were in my
boyhood were sordid, practical, business-like affairs, the
realisation of an insurance, the removal of some encumbering
person. Now three-fourths of our murders are romantic. In England,
in the last eight or ten years, there have been hung some score of
romantic lovers, for jealousy&mdash;lovers usually of the middle
and lower middle class. They have done things, high tragic things,
that seem to have been inspired by the aristocratic Elizabethan
drama.</p>

<p>It is impossible to believe that this pervasion of the
contemporary world by sexual romanticism is anything but a passing
phase in the huge social readjustments now in progress. It is like
a summer cloud-burst that leaves the crops flat for three or four
days and scarcely hurts them. There <i>is</i> no substantial
support for these new attitudes; the thrust of economic necessity
is against them. The harsh truth is that there is now an
over-production of willing beauties and heroines; the market is
more than glutted. Every prosperous man, every successful
adventurer, finds there are charming, cultivated, unscrupulous
young women alert for him at every turn. A lot of us have our
returned cowboy phases, no doubt, times when the easy dollars fly,
but most of us are much too busy and preoccupied to give these
delightful creatures the full attention they expect and demand. The
comparatively successful ones who get a hold on a man, go off
presently with dresses and furniture and precarious settlements. A
few struggle to an unstable and mortified married state. Many never
get anything at all but passing attentions, and hang on until the
revealing dresses reveal beauty no longer but defeat. Our fiction
is still romantic, and no one has yet written the true story of
lovely women among modern rich men. They do better with the heirs,
perhaps, which is one reason why most of us are prepared to put
great restrictions upon inheritance. We prefer the survival of our
business to the seduction of our sons.</p>

<p>The winding-up of this phase of over-competition among heroines
lies with women themselves. The warnings of the disillusioned had
already started off to overtake the romantic novel twenty-five
years ago. The pursuit continues. It was inevitable that to begin
with women should awake to a sense that they had been cheated and
rail against the men for cheats. But men are not to blame for the
comparative rarity of Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. It
was in the nature of things, and not out of the blackness of the
male heart, that these generations of women should be led to expect
too much and receive so little. The flow of romance still runs high
and strong, but gradually the less agreeable truths about men and
women will invade the consciousness of the young girl in time to
save her from the current disappointment. She will be brought back
to the fact that her equivalent man is neither a god nor a cheat
but a human being very like herself, and that for all practical
purposes there are neither gods nor villains after the fashion of
the romancers.</p>

<p>She must realise that though she can be violently attractive to
a man she is only spasmodically attractive, and that on the whole
her need for him is greater than his need for her. The fatal
delusion that a woman can be the crown of a man's life, his
incentive to action, his inspiration, has to be cleaned out of her
mind altogether. Women may have been an incentive to action for
certain types of men, but that is a different statement. The desire
for women has indeed driven men to robberies, piracies, gambling,
insurrections, conquests, gripping possessiveness, waylaying and
forestalling. Woman has been able to make a price and obliged men
to find it&mdash;and so brought herself under the obligations of a
purchased article. But no man has ever done any great creative
thing, painted splendidly, followed up subtle curiosities as a
philosopher or explorer, organised an industry, set a land in
order, invented machines, built lovely buildings, primarily for the
sake of a woman. These things can only be done well and fully for
their own sakes, because of a distinctive drive from within; they
arise from that sublimated egotism we call self-realisation. Some
women have prevented and thwarted the self-realisation of men, and
others have protected and aided men, but from first to last they
have been accessory. Man is and will remain incurably egotist. To
cease to be an egotist is to cease in that measure to be an
individual. Even when he devotes himself wholly to the science of
the species, it is that he seeks to realise his individual
difference to the full in order to add it to the undying experience
of his kind. Even religion has exaggerated rather than suppressed
the egotist by its horrible lure of egoistic immortality. The
devotee, prostrate with adoration in his cell, wants to make his
service to his Lord exceptional and distinctive. "Lord," he prays,
"remember ME."</p>

<p>It is the fundamental falsity of the romantic tradition that man
should subordinate himself to the egotism of a woman. Let her not
dream of it. It lures her on to the development of an enhanced
exaggerated ego, pitifully painted, scented and adorned for
worship. In that she sinks her actual personality and only
perceives the cheat when she finds the slave become owner and
bully, imprisoning his mistress in the jealousy that is his
instinctive, unpremedItated revenge for the unnatural subordination
that has been imposed upon him.</p>

<p>On the whole women are not so highly individualised nor so
strongly egotistical as men. The romantic tradition suggests that
they are more so. The first lesson the modern young woman has to
learn is to reject that suggestion and accept the facts of the
case. The greater part of the life of a modern woman&mdash;and it
is astonishing now to see how far down these influences have
extended&mdash;is the sedulous pursuit of an enforced and
superposed individuality. In that pursuit goes all the vigour that
might have enabled her to develop her more essential qualities. Her
hair, her skin, her figure, her behaviour, her emotions, must be,
in the same way, tortured to "distinction." Her very scent must be
distinctive; her entry into a room must have "style"; she must wrap
strange and striking effects of colour and texture round her
mediocrity. Failing any inner radiance, she must secure the
limelight. The manufacture of individuality for women is a vast
industry; in Paris, in New York, in London it is dominant; it is
perhaps the most skilful and wonderful industry in our world. Men
and women of fine intelligence exert their utmost gifts to produce
"creations"; those must be sold in secret and with passionate
asseverations that they are exclusive, to the happy, rich, ordinary
women who are lifted by such efforts for a few days or a few weeks
out of the undistinguished chorus of female minds and bodies to
which naturally they belong. A title, some historical pearls, a
collection of jewels, a few anecdotes can be added with advantage.
Then with a certain enterprise, and a setting and a retinue, titled
attentions perhaps, and the press and the press photographers, the
goddess is built up. And you take it home with you out of the
clamour, and you take its marvellous clothes off it and you wash
off what you can of its grease and paint and powder, and you find a
poor little human body of no remarkable quality and a mind and a
character of no quality at all.</p>

<p>The flower of the romantic tradition has been the fine lady, who
disappears, who becomes already a little ghostly and incredible.
Its practical outcome has been that curious code of claims and
behaviour by which multitudes of women are living to-day, here in
dear, lucid, logical, impatient, shallow-minded France
particularly, and the code is embodied in the phrase <i>"La
Femme."</i> By it men and women cease altogether to be
fellow-creatures. The first convention in the cult, <i>La
Femme</i>, is that every woman, except such women as are to be
altogether swept aside as <i>stupides</i> and <i>laides</i>, is
delightful, desirable, exceptional, and rare. The second is that
without her life is intolerable to a man, that she is his
comprehensive objective, that all he is and does is for her
sake&mdash;her sake or her rival's. That is the one thorn in the
paradise of <i>La Femme</i>&mdash;the other woman. The man appears
in her life, seeking, seeking, sometimes rather blindly and
requiring assistance, but always seeking his end, his completion.
After suitable inquiries and an exchange of references between the
parents, she allows herself to love. She "gives" herself. The male,
faint with gratitude and amazement, becomes her slave. Her lifework
is over; the rest is harvest. In return for this stupendous, this
almost unheard-of beneficence she is entitled to dress, leisure,
amusement, servants, and an establishment considerably above her or
her husband's station. The male is rewarded or admonished by
repetitions or refusals of the supreme gift. It is adorned for his
birthday and reserved during Lent.</p>

<p><i>La Femme</i>, particularly in phases of doubt and
disillusionment, is apt to become gregarious and voluble. She
gathers in flats at tea-time and talks her fears and angers down
and out. She asserts her inflexible principles, her unflinching
claims. She exchanges views upon what may be borne and what
justifies deceit and rebellion. Almost everything justifies deceit
and rebellion. And at the back of her talk, most sacred of
conventional beliefs, pretension no tea party would ever dare to
question or qualify, is the doctrine of the eager, accessible
<i>amant</i>. An enormous number of prowling rich men are supposed
to exist, men in reserve, the ultimate stabilisers of all the
troubles of <i>La Femme</i>. If the husband prove intolerable, if
his meanness and incapacity sink below the needs and pride of his
impatient priceless one, she will, she declares, fall back at last
upon that one certain resource. There it is. <i>Que
voulez-vous?</i> She will just go out of the home, somewhere,
and&mdash;a mere movement of prehension&mdash;"prendre un amant, un
riche amant."</p>

<p><i>"Je les vois prenant ce riche amant,"</i> says Clementina,
the wise, the disillusioned.</p>

<h2><a id="b6-5" name="b6-5"></a>§ 5. SEXUAL INTEGRITY</h2>

<p class="first">THIS phase of social life, this submergence of
upper and middle class and even artisan life by a flood of sexual
romanticism must be a transitory one. There are too many women and
not enough men seeking to realise these dreams, and such romantic
men as are to be found are discovering the increasing cheapness of
their charmers. They become arrogant beyond enduring. The sense of
sin was the last restrictive force upon the abundance of women, and
it has gone. There is too much humiliation and disappointment in
this interplay for girls and women and normally circumstanced men.
The situation eases itself by young women taking up work with
increasing sincerity and ability. It can be profoundly modified by
the social atmosphere able women may create. But it will never ease
itself completely until there is a great reduction in the prizes
that can still fall to an impudent and lucky adventuress.</p>

<p>That rests with the men who have the power to change economic
conditions. The final cure for the vulgarisation and suffusion of
life by the extravagances of the romantic lady, in action or in
magnificent retirement, and of her myriads of unsuccessful or
partially successful imitators and competitors, is the abolition of
the cowboy type, the lucky lad, the gambler. As we regularise
business and the exploitation of staple productions, clip
adventurous finance to economic sub-service, destroy restrictive
monopolies, mitigate the pressure of the mere creditor and restrain
inheritance, the resources of the spendthrift male will dwindle and
the ground vanish from under the feet of the heroine. As the
sanitation of the world's economic life progresses, the romantic
tradition will fade in the measure of that reorganisation. For some
generations yet the romantic tradition will be fighting after its
gorgeous fashion, in novel and play, in the press, upon the screen
and in custom, costume, manners, and conversation, in every daily
affair, against the conception of a graver, non-parasitic
womanhood.</p>

<p>I know very little about the younger women of to-day. They say
that quite new types have appeared since the war but they have been
outside my explicit experience. I find I am too old now to get any
exchange of ideas with a Woman under thirty. William Clissold the
Second might be able to add much to what I am writing here. But I
am neither deaf nor blind; I have a certain aptitude for seeing
things with my left shoulder or the back of my head where girls and
women are concerned. The romantic tradition is not altogether
outside the imagination of these types, but a new code is pushing
it aside. One sees the struggle in the dress they wear. The short
hair, the kilts, spell freedom, but many of them&mdash;even the
very young ones&mdash;paint like whores. Some of the leaders must
know their own minds, but most of the rank and file seem quite
uncertain whether it is heroine or comrade they mean to be. Chance
may determine. Maybe Angelina is a comrade on Monday and reverts to
the role of heroine after the excitement of the cinema on Tuesday
evening. That must make very uncertain going for Edwin.</p>

<p>Chastity, by which I mean an invincible power of abstinence, has
long been falling down the scale of feminine virtue from the days
when it was not only the supreme but practically the only adornment
needed by a good woman. She could be mendacious, cowardly, and
indolent; these things merely added an agreeable piquancy to the
charm of her essential goodness. But if the new types no longer
esteem virginity as a glory and chastity as an obligation, it does
not follow that their code will tolerate a careless promiscuity and
still less the mercenary exploitation of men's sexual desires. On
that modern women join issue openly with the romantic tradition,
which shelters under its ample pretences both the successful
prostitute and the parasitic wife. At present I believe these
recalcitrant women are working out their own conception of sexual
integrity. They are in a phase of experiment, and for many of the
weaker sisters experiment degenerates into aimless and undignified
laxity. They do not so much follow the desires of their hearts as
do what they are asked. The task of developing the new ideals is
intricate and complex. The general proposition is an easy one: it
is that women should make love only for love. But like most easy
general propositions, it says very little because it is open for
anything whatever to shelter under that word "love."</p>

<p>There is a Mediterranean lucidity about Clementina in these
matters. There is a Mediterranean disregard of intentions that do
not immediately clothe themselves in terms of explicit reality. She
examined this repudiation of any mercenary element in love.</p>

<p>"You say a woman must not give herself for what she
gets&mdash;only for love. Yes; very good. And what makes her love a
man at first? In nine cases out of ten, what makes her begin to
love him? The effect of kindness, the effect of power, the quality
of the givah. Because she feels he can give. She gives herself for
love&mdash;yes. But she loves because she feels something stronger,
safer, protective in the man. Is that being mercenary?"</p>

<p>I considered the proposition.</p>

<p>"Do I love you?" she went on. "Do you doubt of it? You know I
love you. You know. I would die for you. But what made me love you
first? Desiah for your beauty, Clissoldaki mou? It was because you
suddenly came to me, strong and kind and helping. Because you had
powah over all the things that defeated me. You came to me.
Confident you were. I was afraid. I was hungry&mdash;I was hungry
that night. You said: 'If you want to go to Provence, my deah, go.
I let you.' It was so wonderful. You can open roads, give freedoms,
make houses and gardens submit to you, put safety round my
life."</p>

<p>"Is it only that?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. You know. My deah, you know. But does a woman fall
in love with a man if a man isn't that? If he fails. If he lets
himself be frustrated. If he cannot protect and give. All the new
ideahs in the world can't alter that. Women will turn to the strong
man, the capable man, the man who has mastery. Their <i>hearts</i>
will turn. Their honest love. As yours turn to beauty. When the
love is won, ah! <i>Then</i> you can be weak. <i>Then</i> you can
be cruel. But to the end of time, my deah, you will never be able
to tell whether this woman or that sold herself for the powah a man
had or gave herself for the love he commanded."</p>

<p>Gestures from the isles of Greece came to reinforce her
asseverations. "Many don't <i>know</i>," she drove it home. "Many
never know."</p>

<p>Then with an extended finger: "I have seen girls sell
themselves, and come to love their husbands, and come to despise
the pooah lover who could do no better than a serenade&mdash;and
make eyes at her. Could not even take her away. Failed."</p>

<p>This, I admit, is an important gloss on that definition of
sexual integrity, but I do not see that it destroys it. The
free-spirited woman who seeks to attract and welcomes as a mate a
man with some sort of power is quite a distinguishable type from
the one who cultivates her charms for the market. The superficial
effect may be the same, but the direction of the <i>attention</i>
is different. <i>Serena Blandish</i>, that pathetic novel, tells
how the old-fashioned trade declines.</p>

<p>"Sexual integrity," said Clementina, "is not to be independent
or dependent. Sexual integrity is to keep faith with your
lovah."</p>

<p>"But if there is no lover?"</p>

<p>"To keep faith with the lovah that is to be."</p>

<p>"But in your own case&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I was finding my way to you."</p>

<p>There is at times a magnificence about Clementina that takes my
breath away.</p>

<p>"I was talking," I said after a pause for recovery, "of the
morals of the free and equal woman. I was not thinking of the woman
who accepts her need of dependence on men. I was thinking of the
sort of woman who has turned her back on the <i>romantic</i>
tradition and sets out to be a self-subsisting citizen. She claims
all the freedoms of a man. But since you took hold of the question
this free and equal woman of mine has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Was she ever there?" said Clementina.</p>

<p>"She was materialising," I asserted.</p>

<p>"I can only speak of women as I know them," said Clementina. "We
have to love and we are not as strong as men."</p>

<p>But <i>if</i> Clementina has not met this new sort of woman, I
at least have had glimpses of her and the sexual integrity she has
in mind is something more and perhaps something less than sexual
faithfulness to a lover actual or foreseen. In limiting it to that
Clementina goes right back to the sentimental emotional view of
woman's position. She is obsessed by the idea that love is the
cardinal thing in life. That is just what the newer type is
struggling a way from at any cost. They are in profound reaction
against that idea because in it they find the clue to their general
cheapness and subjection. Some repudiate it, by treating sex as
something as trivial as chocolate. But there are others who
appreciate it for the enormous and far-reaching thing it is in
life, and yet are resolved not to be subordinated and enslaved
through it. They want to reserve it, to keep it private) outside
all negotiations, detached from all ambitions and all other
activities. They want to do their work and establish their status
in despite of it. As a man does. Freedom and dignity are the good
things that it seems most to attack and endanger. For the sake of
them they realise woman must cease to be beauty, heroine,
temptress, darling, and become&mdash;a citizen. For the sake of
them she must abandon the artificial advantages and refuse the
restrictions of a wife. So they see it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find in Clementina a vigorous antagonist to
this conception of the modern woman's role, because it is one I
seem to have held always. I do not remember that I ever scrutinised
it very closely. Instinctively I have been in sympathy with it. As
a student I was already talking to Clara about our being perfectly
equal and perfectly free. I do not remember that I ever questioned
the moral assumptions of Godwin and Shelley. I have taken this
attitude with women all my life. It is only recently that I have
come to realise the passion in Clementina's repudiation.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-6" name="b6-6"></a>§ 6. THEIR THREE CHIEF
FAILINGS</h2>

<p class="first">THIS sexual integrity towards which women seem to
be moving from that conception of status entirely sexual which the
romantic tradition imposed upon them is entangled with certain
other moral dispositions. I have been trying to state them, not
very successfully, because they are so interwoven. They are to be
found already in the code of a man; it is just because they have
been and are so disregarded by women that it is necessary to
emphasise them in that relation. I had written yesterday a list
beginning "(1) a greater hardness towards facts, a refusal to be
accommodating towards a falsehood." Then came "(2) an acceptance of
a natural personality in the place of the dressmaker's substitute."
But I will not give the rest of that list. After lunch I invoked
Clementina.</p>

<p>"Think for me a little," I said. "There are some things a woman
ought never to do. What are they?"</p>

<p>Clementina made a false start. "If a woman loves a man," she
began, "there is nothing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, whether she loves or not," I said, and pulled her back
to the question again. "Clementina, tell me, what are the common
faults of women? What are the chief weaknesses against which they
ought to set rules and prohibitions for themselves if they are to
look men in the face?"</p>

<p>"We are liahs," said Clementina unhesitatingly, and then fell
into a meditation while I gave Titza crumbs of sugar from my
coffee-cup.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, and paused for my full attention. "There are
three things wrong with us,&mdash;three. There are three chief
faults of women. They are all forms of weakness. We are liahs, we
are vain, and we give no fair play in our dealings with men."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are different," I said.</p>

<p>"At the bottom of her heart," said Clementina, "a woman
knows&mdash;knows she cannot accomplish fairly. She is afraid. She
is afraid of herself. She is afraid she will go to pieces if she is
left to do a thing alone. She has no confidence. She has no
confidence she can do fairly."</p>

<p>"She has no confidence she will be treated fairly," I said.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, she has no confidence. So that as soon as things seem
likely to go wrong she cheats. She lies, she shirks, she betrays.
Feah."</p>

<p>"It is right," I interrupted, "that women should be fearful. It
was&mdash;it still is&mdash;necessary for herself and her children.
Always that has been so. She was afraid of the dark thing round the
corner and of the quick violence of her offended mate. Hiding is
instinctive. And so is lying. For a woman. She has had to ease off
the truth so often. Diplomatic. Evasive. It wasn't her job to face
the dark thing round the corner. And she had to keep the peace with
the dark thing in the cave."</p>

<p>"It will be long before fear goes out of women's lives," said
Clementina. "It isn't all upbringing; it isn't all circumstances.
It is in us. We have clear minds even if we have weak bodies, and
we know things, we <i>know</i>, which either you don't know or you
are too polite to say. We have to judge men. We have to judge what
goes to make success. We know the qualities. And we know we haven't
got them. Little knowledge, little or no training, and something
more. Not such power of concentration. Not able to keep on and keep
on gripping. Women get quicklier tired and more muddled in their
brains when they have to think out difficult things. They learn
quickly&mdash;oh! we can be wonderfully clever, give us rules,
details, words, but when it comes to big general things we
<i>flinch</i>."</p>

<p>"Training," I said. "Tradition."</p>

<p>"I wonder."</p>

<p>"And the willing, convenient man ready to say: 'Leave it all to
me'!"</p>

<p>"But no man will leave it all to someone else, even when you say
it to him. But we are glad to leave it. We are afraid, even when we
could."</p>

<p>"A traditional want of pride," said I.</p>

<p>"Pride," she said, and reflected.</p>

<p>"Women are not proud enough," said Clementina, thinking aloud.
"Telling the truth is a sort of pride."</p>

<p>"This is how I see it, and be damned to you," I tried it over.
"That's all right."</p>

<p>"And they are vain also because they have no pride. Their
vanity. Their industrious vanity. They fly from their own real
selves. They snatch at any flattery, they stick on any trimming,
any colour, any ornament, because they feel they are nothing in
themselves. It's not only food and shelter they want from men. They
want, always they want, to be reassured. We say: 'Do you love me?
Say that you love me!' Until you wave your arms at us as if we were
flies and you say 'Shuddub' to us and 'Go away!' Pitiful it is. And
we are greedy for the least bit of praise. Praise is the food of
love. A wise man&mdash;even a kind man&mdash;makes his woman feel
that she is pretty&mdash;every day. And the less she is the more he
ought to."</p>

<p>"I have seen men greedy for robes," I said. "I have known men
find flattery sustaining."</p>

<p>"And their ungenerosity," said Clementina, pursuing her own
thoughts. "Their absolute disregard of give and take. The way they
will take from men they despise! The way they will let a worried,
overworked husband they pretend to love pay and pay! The way they
will take dependence as their privilege! The way they accept being
put first, shirk little tasks, are lazy, and do not try! Until they
are positively driven to try. And then&mdash;they drudge.
Inattentively&mdash;not trying to do it. Protesting. All of it, all
of it is want of pride. All of it. But you are right. We have no
pride."</p>

<p>Then with a swift transition, with a lift of her eyebrows and a
change of voice:</p>

<p>"Where is my pride with you, Clissoulaki? Where is my pride with
you?"</p>

<p>She reverted to a philosophical attitude. "Can women have pride?
Will they ever have pride?"</p>

<p>It would be impossible for a voice to express completer
resignation.</p>

<p>"Clementina," I said, "women now are struggling towards pride.
They are struggling towards pride out of conditions that have
become increasingly humiliating for them. They have been
trivialised and cheapened by economic forces, and demoralised and
cheated by traditions that require them to be rare and sought after
when in reality they are abundant and omnipresent. They can only
get back to dignity by being proud, by refusing all differential
treatment and insisting upon all the masculine
virtues&mdash;whether the men like it or no. Courage. Truth. Fair
play."</p>

<p>Clementina made no answer.</p>

<p>"That," I said, "is the quintessence of feminism. That is what
the vote symbolised for them, and all the agitations of the last
five-and-twenty years. A struggle back to pride."</p>

<p>But Clementina was away upon a trail of her own. Suddenly she
looked up at me.</p>

<p>"In some things, Clissoulaki, you are very clever, and in some
you are very dense. I do not think it has ever dawned on you in all
your life how unfair and how cruel a thing it can be to take a
woman into your life and treat her as your equal."</p>

<p>"How can it be unfair to play on equal terms?"</p>

<p>"Equal terms! When we love with all our beings! And you
love&mdash;! I love little Titza here, more than you have ever
loved me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-7" name="b6-7"></a>§ 7. RETURN TO MORALITY</h2>

<p class="first">EVIDENTLY I must come to a discussion of this love
which Clementina, in spite of all my resistances, forces into the
foreground of my mind. Yet still for a section I shall cling to my
analysis of the forms of sexual relationship, if only because it is
within these forms that love as she conceives it goes on. One
cannot love in the air, painted ceilings notwithstanding. I will
disentangle all I can of the general forces that interweave to make
our individual cases before I come down to these last intimate
realities. I will complete my bird's-eye view of the changes that
are going on between men and women by a forecast of the coming
state of affairs.</p>

<p>In spite of all the romanticism, extravagance, excitement, and
waste in the life of women to-day, in spite of its almost universal
levity and triviality, I do not believe that these conditions have
any real permanence. Though the flood is nearly universal, the
ground is near below. I do not believe this era of triviality will
Endure, because I perceive that there is too much disappointment
and mortification in it for women. That the vast majority of women
to-day show no signs of any disposition to change the present state
of affairs does not trouble me in the least. Women can adopt new
attitudes <i>en masse</i> much more readily even than men. Feminine
values are and always have been very unstable, and the zephyr of
the afternoon may become the hurricane of to-morrow. I am prepared
to find much promise therefore in very unsubstantial
intimations.</p>

<p>Women in the past have shown the extremest plasticity in their
ideals of life. We have seen the homely, sheltered woman swept away
by the romantic inundation; we have had an epidemic of heroines;
for a time it seemed as though woman had no other end but dancing.
We have encountered the rebel woman, the frantic sex-antagonist.
There are forces now that make for pride and reservation in women,
and there is a great need for pride. As the creative and directive
men who are building up a new world order in the living body of the
old become aware of the full significance of the work they do and
of their full possibilities, inevitably there will be women
awakening also, to share in the new understandings and the new
ambitions. They will be interested in these things not only
directly, but because they interest the men. Nothing that men have
nowadays is altogether kept from women. I do not see how these new
women can be other than women practically active, soberly beautiful
in dress and bearing, a little hidden in their love, and friendly
to men.</p>

<p>Their standards and habits, more than any other single
influence, will determine the tone of social life in that emerging
world-community with its wider outlooks, its longer rhythms, its
more sustained vitality I have anticipated. To these first adapted
women will come influence and power and prestige as the active men
will disentangle themselves and their time and energy from the
worn-out nets of the meretricious women. When paint and scent go
they will go very fast because they will be aware of their own
conspicuousness. They are not inadvertent things. They came because
there was a premium upon over-emphasis; they have no intrinsic
beauty or charm. The new types will set the fashion and provide the
models for their weaker, more imitative sisters. The swing back
will pass far beyond the types it first expressed. Gravity,
capacity, independence will become the common wear.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do not apprehend a wave of Quaker drab
submerging the ten thousand standard advertisements of sex that now
animate our streets. Women in desperation will no longer make a
flagrant appeal to all and sundry, but that does not mean they will
become indifferent to their effect. Within the code of pride I have
foreshadowed for women the life of the new community will have much
variety, and that will display itself in costume and bearing. The
new community will be one of more freely developed personalities
than ours, and upon the basis of its common standards there will be
a far greater diversity of personal experiences. We shall not all
be boxed up by twos and twos and relaxed in crowds. The new variety
will be due, not to a tangled confusion of traditions and
accidents, but to an open development of personal idiosyncrasies.
Our lives to-day will seem as limited, uniform, and stereotyped to
the larger living, fuller living, wider living people of the days
to come as a crowd of Central African negroes in an explorer's
photograph&mdash;all alike in paint and feathers and armed alike
and nearly all in the same attitude&mdash;looks to our eyes
to-day.</p>

<p>The institution of marriage as we know it has a false air of
having lasted unimpaired throughout the ages. It has, as a matter
of fact, varied enormously, and it continues to vary, in its
obligations, its restrictions, its availability and solubility, its
duration. People are constantly discussing, "Are you for or against
marriage ? Would you abolish it?" We are an for and against
marriage, and we abolish it piecemeal continually. We vary the
implications of the bond by fresh legislation every few years; we
have in my lifetime reduced the former headship and proprietorship
of the husband to a shadow, robbed him of rights of assault upon
his wife, taken away his privilege of not educating his children,
and relaxed the conditions of divorce. The marriage of to-day is
not the marriage of yesterday, and still less is it likely to be
the marriage of to-morrow. When you rule out of consideration an
the points upon which marriage varies in the civilised communities
to-day and consider what remains after the stripping, you will find
it amounts to very little more than the legal recognition and
enforcement of that natural tendency of the human animal to mate
and to sustain a joint establishment for the protection of the
resultant offspring.</p>

<p>The force of reason is in alliance with the forces of social
convenience in narrowing down marriage to a child-protecting bond.
Until that is done it is clear that the state will be depriving
adults, needlessly, of their legitimate sexual freedom, to the
grave demoralisation of such law and police organisation as may be
required to enforce these all too intimate restrictions. The
community only becomes concerned with sexual affairs when the
publIc health is affected or a child is begotten and born. The
public responsibilities are incurred, obligations must be
acknowledged, and home life and upbringing ensured for the new
citizen of the world.</p>

<p>At present legal marriage is more than such a public bond,
partly out of regard for the dwindling social necessity of a rule
of inheritance and partly because of the impudent intolerance of
our intellectually and morally discredited religious organisations.
In every generation now we humiliate and injure scores of thousands
of lives under the discrimination of bastardy, in deference to the
imaginary needs of keeping together estates that our death duties
are busily breaking up, and because the endowments of religion are
still sufficient to maintain strenuously orthodox parsons and
priests. These are things of the old order, and the forces of
progress thrust them aside, slowly but steadily. As the bastard is
equalised with the legitimate son, and the proprietorship of the
husband and wife attenuated to the privileges of lover and
mistress, the world will cease to inquire for a wife's "marriage
lines" and marriage signify little more than habitual
association.</p>

<p>Already some people are dropping the change of a woman's name at
marriage, and that may extend until it is the general practice.
When women write, or act, or paint, it is becoming common. Dr.
Marie Stopes is really Mrs. Roe, Viola Tree is really Mrs. Parsons,
and there are hundreds of such casts. Hotel proprietors all over
the world, and experienced butlers in the best houses, behave as
though there were millions. The time may come when the
ministrations of the clergyman, the orange blossoms and the robe of
white, "The Voice that Breathed O'er Eden," the hired carriages,
and the white favours will be the quaint social survival of the
backward suburbs and the provincial towns.</p>

<p>Such a fading out of marriage from its present stereotyped
rigidity will put no end to mating. The men and women of the wider
life and the larger views will still feel our common necessity to
go in couples for longer or shorter periods. But there may be much
diversity in the character of their coupling. The stereotyped
relations of man and wife and of man and mistress&mdash;which
latter are at present a sort of left-handed reflection of
marriage&mdash;will have given place to many variations of
association. In the ampler, easier, less crowded, less ceremonious
social life of to-morrow, a life of more adult, more individualised
people, the consorts will not always be upon a convention of
equality. Perhaps they will rarely be upon terms of equality. As we
begin to take off the stays, blinkers, traces, hoods, masks,
fetters, gags, we have put upon the sexual imaginations of human
beings, and examine into the living realities below, we may realise
that we have been trying to adapt an immensely various collection
of types to one standard bilateral arrangement. We may find they
are not only diverse in temperament, but that they go through
diverse phases of development, so that what is reasonable and
desirable for a man of five-and-twenty may be cruel nonsense if it
is applied to a man of five-and-fifty. Our moral judgments may need
to vary not only with temperament but with stage of development of
the individual we judge. Human growth goes on through out life; we
do not "grow up" and have done with it, as our forefathers
supposed.</p>

<p>The Christian marriage, like most marriage institutions in the
world, met the needs of a peasant life with a passable success. It
happened normally about the early twenties, or a little later for a
man, and it carried the couple on for twenty years, by which time
toil and exposure had aged them, their children were growing up,
and there was little more to be done for them. It is extraordinary
how young in years some of the old women and bent ancients about
here are. The romantic tradition of the nomad and his descendant,
the aristocrat, was even nearer adolescence. One day came love and
another death. I have already pointed out the youthfulness of
Shakespearean romance. But nowadays we live much longer, we do not
age so fast, we learn quicklier and mature more rapidly, and a new
stage opens and widens in life between the thirties and the
seventies, for which the institutions, traditions, sentiment, and
poetry of the past cannot be expected to provide a complete
outline. This is the stage, the new adult stage, upon which the
coming order will be built and which is being cleared of its
encumbrances of childish, youthful, and adolescent habits and
feelings, and short and narrow views. Mating and marriage and the
rearing of a family must still be a part of this new life, but only
a phase of it. It was George Meredith, I think, who set the world
talking twenty years ago by suggesting ten-year marriages. That is
surely too short. The practical endurance of a marriage is
determined by the need of children for a home. The home now docs
not last a lifetime. England now is full of houses left like a last
year's nest. At best the old home, like Lambs Court, becomes a
meeting-place and club-house for the growing clan. Commonly it
dissolves. The Riviera here swarms with people whose homes have
come to pieces.</p>

<p>Probably Darby and Joan will still be found in the new world,
but it may be that the common practice will be an exchange between
different ages. I have an impression that at the present time the
very young people do not, in the majority of cases, hit it off
together very easily. Youth is too egotistically preoccupied to
show much consideration for the egotistical preoccupations of
another undeveloped personality. Perhaps it is more natural to have
one partner rather protective and stronger, and one fresher and
more spontaneous.</p>

<p>Or it may be that the common human life passes through phases
that begin with love for a strong adult type, go on to a love of
equals, to partnership and the home and children, and give place to
a keener interest in and a finer understanding for the young. Some
of my contemporaries have gone through such phases, and I can find
traces of them in my own rather aberrant experiences. But though
this may be true of men, it may not be so true of women. I do not
know. They are disguised from me, and I have not been so closely
interested as I might have been in the feelings and reactions of
women older than myself. Just as the young man, from the age of
eighteen onward, under the pressure of the romantic tradition, is
forced to imagine himself a virile adult, and stronger and coarser
and wiser and more wilful than any woman at all, so every woman,
unless she has turned her back upon all thoughts of attraction,
must go on playing the tender juvenile part. Women pretend even to
themselves, so that they can tell you nothing real; and it defeats
my poor powers of psychic analysis altogether to guess at the
suppressed and distorted mightiness of their imaginations. Venus
Absoluta is, for all practical judgments, the unknown goddess.</p>

<p>Perhaps Catherine the Great of Russia and Ninon de Lenclos were
intimations of the quality of Venus Absoluta. Or perhaps they were
merely energetic and versatile men who happened to be of the female
sex.</p>

<p>For many in the reconstituted human community matters may come
full round to the ancient balance of the peasant life again when
men and women alike were workers. At a higher level and in a more
lucid co-operation. In just the measure that men are able to get
rid of the predatory and gambling and merely acquisitive processes
in the new world society, in just that measure may the old intimate
fellowship of man and woman return. And there, I think, comes a
possible reconciliation of Clementina's assertion of ineradicable
differences and dependences with the new spirit of freedom and
pride. It becomes possible, when a man works not for himself but
for the race, that a woman should at once remain equal and proud of
herself and yet work in subordination to him. It may be that by
nature his initiatives are more resolute and less hesitating than
hers.</p>

<p>The humiliations of women in recent times have been very largely
due to their realisation that their lives were subordinated to
men's merely personal ends. That, they feel, is shameful, half-way
to the common prostitute. Their recalcitrance was of a piece with
the recalcitrance of a worker who finds his life limited, used, and
exhausted for the mere individual gratifications of a
profit-hunting employer. There is no share nor pride in the end for
the subordinate in either case. The forces of revolution work to
abolish that sort of employment and any sort of dependence on
individual whim. But subordination takes on an altogether different
quality when it is subordination to a captain, who himself is
subordinate. He also serves, and if manifestly he serves in good
faith there is no loss of honour in following his leads. No social
state has ever been conceived, nor can I conceive any, in which
most of the men and women will not be living subordinated lives. I
see no great hardship if in the future as in the past the role of a
large proportion of women remains in reality ancillary. That need
not prevent them living happily and beautifully, proud of what they
are and of what they do.</p>

<p>But I grow more and more speculative; and these women of the
days to come, for all their pride and graciousness, remain
conspicuously featureless. My reason evokes them, fine-spirited and
wise, but they are aloof from me. Their faces remain blank ovals
that have not so much as eyes to look towards me.</p>

<p>The night is late, and early to-morrow Clementina is coming down
for a great walk we have long promised ourselves into those grey
wildernesses of stone and scrub above Gourdon. It will be too far
and too stony for Titza's incessant little feet. I shall carry food
and drink in my rucksack, and we shall sit among the rocks in the
sunlight under the blue sky and wrangle and discourse about these
endless riddles.</p>

<h2><a id="b6-8" name="b6-8"></a>§ 8. TROUBLE IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE been reading over the sections I have
written in the past two months. Many of them impress me as bare and
abstract. I have written of the change of scale in economic life,
of the supersession of schools and colleges and methods and
institutions and forms of government, of the conflict between
traditions of relationship. It has been necessary to reason close
and hard and stick to general terms.</p>

<p>"Tradition of relationship" is, I admit, an arid term to cover
people's love troubles. I have been attempting a diagram of the
whole of human life as I see it passing before me, and perhaps it
is absurd of me to regret now that it is diagrammatic. Both the
telescope and the microscope take us at last to the inhuman. But it
is upon the gaunt loom of these economic processes, educational
influences, guiding traditions, that all our lives are woven.</p>

<p>I return from this long flight, this bird's-eye view of human
affairs in the sluices of change, to the hangar, so to speak, of
this room. I clamber out of my framework of generalisations. I come
back from map scale to life-size again. And I find many things in
the story I have told of myself and my brother, and many other
things I have seen in life that had seemed irrational and perverse
and adventitious, falling into a kind of reasonableness in accord
with the broad lines that outline inspection has revealed.</p>

<p>It is possible now to distinguish, if not to separate, the
essential living matter of these experiences from the streams of
suggested ideas, imitations, subconscious responses, imposed
habits, uncritical acquiescences that flowed through that living
matter into acts. I discover the compulsions in what seemed wilful
actions, the mechanical quality of many inconsistencies and much
misbehaviour.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have thought that Clara's offence against me was that
she was unfaithful to me; but now I perceive that the essential
trouble was this, that she married me and I her without lucidity or
sincerity. I must have disappointed her acutely in many things; but
most, and most disastrously, by my unconscious self-betrayals of my
belief that I had bought her, that I had bought her at no great
price, chiefly to relieve my cloddish sensuality&mdash;in relieving
hers. The shams we had accepted to clothe our transaction were thin
enough for at least a subconscious apprehension of the truth. Only
now do I realise how much of our relationship stripped down to
that. We phrased it differently, in phrases that I have largely
forgotten. But by nearly all the standards that mingled in her mind
she had, I see, a case against me, and though I might have pleaded
that she misled me in what she promised me and in what she meant to
give me, far more had I misled myself. She and her sisters were
saturated in that degeneration of the romantic tradition which has
turned the haughty and pampered beauty into a needy and pursuing
beauty. It seemed normal and proper for them to cheat in the face
of such marriages as confronted them. They were already primed to
cheat and snatch before I knew them. At times she must have been
amazed by the realisation of her own turpitude, at the net into
which her temptations and prevarications and justifications had
entangled her. She must have wondered, like a beast in a cage, how
it had come about that she was in such a tangle.</p>

<p>It is easy to condemn Clara as a bad woman, and so dispose of
her. That in effect is how I treated her. But there is another side
to her offences that I am only now beginning to appreciate at its
fun significance. I have thought often enough how they hurt me, but
for the first time I am coming to think how they hurt her. What
devastating hours of dismay and perplexity must Clara have lived
through&mdash;even before our rupture! When she thought of what she
had done and how and when I might find out, and what would happen
then, and why, why in Heaven's name she had done it. Because life
had not been made plain to her, because she had been lured and
shouted at by a confusion of impulses and voices bidding her go
hither and thither. For every impulse, for every suggestion there
had been some sort of formula and a quality, however flimsy, of
excuse. If it was only the excuse of saying I deserved it. She must
have lain awake at nights by my side, trying to persuade herself
she was safe and all was well with the outlook, while the gathering
dangers marched round about her and threatened her. Or that by some
feat of rhetoric and ratiocination she would be able to "explain."
And afterwards, through the tangle of adventures and
misrepresentations that ended in Weston dropping her and through
her subsequent difficulties, what fresh series of unsolvable
perplexities must have assailed her unprotected sleepless
hours.</p>

<p>Some years ago the sort of people who find life too ample for
them used up their surplus time in putting together again extremely
dissected and dispersed pictures caned jig-saw puzzles. Humourists
would make the difficult impossible by mixing two or three of these
puzzles and presenting a selection of the <i>mélange</i> to the
unwary solver. The fact beneath poor Clara's indulgences, evasions,
and artificialities was a mixed jig-saw puzzle of problems of
conduct. I doubt if she ever had a suspicion of the trick Mr. G.
had played upon her life. She never saw anything of the
joke&mdash;and now I see it too late to mitigate the harshness
there was even in my belated kindnesses to her.</p>

<p>She had a capacity for suffering as great as mine. She never had
any successes at all; life battered at her; she felt it all more
than I should ever have done because she had nothing of my ultimate
power of stoical self-detachment f rom pleasant or harmful things.
She was altogether submerged in life and had no such escape.
Perhaps she had her consolations, a run of luck at boule or
roulette, a passing conquest, an assignation, and she may have got
a fulness of gratification out of such things that I cannot
imagine. They could not have balanced the account. Luck treated her
badly, and I cannot jest with Mr. G. about her life as I can about
my own.</p>

<p>I turn now to the memories of my other love adventures, the
casual encounters, the <i>passades</i>, the brief passions of
pursuit and success. I have told the reader little about them
except that they occurred. What else was there to tell? Surveyed
again now in this geographical, this historical fashion, they look
less bright and smaller than they did before. They happened, they
entertained me, some of them delighted me; I make no apology for
them, and I do not repent. But there was little beauty in them, and
a sort of pettiness pervaded them. I find the condemning quality
about them an idleness, a pointlessness. Such things may happen
with a certain grace and brightness in the heats and curiosities of
youth, but not in the habitual life of. a grown man. They have
their value and justification In assuagement or in reassurance. But
they were mere apologies to love. We were frittering away something
precious for which our world provided no better use.</p>

<p>My life with Sirrie arose out of one of these <i>passades</i>
and made an end to them. Few people, even among my nearest friends,
seem to understand how good a thing for me were those years I spent
with her. Why will they not accept my judgment of her? They have
newspaper reports, scandalous stories, the false knowledge of a few
hours. I lived with her for some years. Never was the bare truth
about a woman so false a libel as it was on Sirrie. Never did facts
make so cruel a caricature. I was the first friend she had ever met
among men, and she was the first close friend I had ever known
among women. When I think of the beauty and spirit she had, her
mental and physical fineness and hardihood, I am grieved, even now
I feel real grief, at the wastage of her and the suffering and
desolation that brooded behind the drugs and drink and misdeeds to
which she had resorted. I had no hand in that, and it is only now
that I can consent to look squarely at all these poor flounderings
and follies that dropped her at last, a coughing refugee, into my
care.</p>

<p>But the solitary side of life! The sleepless nights when all our
mental restraints have been put off with our daytime clothes, and
our stark, defenceless selves face the immensities of remorse, of
self-accusation and fear! I think of that eager, slender girl at
seventeen, hopefully triumphant&mdash;I have a picture of her then,
and she is adorable&mdash;and then of the woman who would come from
her room to mine in our early days at Richmond, whispering
shamefacedly in the darkness: "Pity me! Pity me! Take me in your
arms. I can't <i>sleep</i>, Billy; I keep on thinking. I can't
<i>sleep</i>."</p>

<p>It was a phase that came to an end with her, so that latterly
she slept like a child and ceased to trouble, but it was a dreadful
phase. Before she was twenty life was already staring and grimacing
at her.</p>

<p>With her, just as with Clara, the impulses and voices in the
confusion had urged her this way and that. How was she to judge?
How was she to know? The traps looked like fun. The base marriage
looked like wisdom and help for all her family. These two unhappy
brains are just glimpses of what a "conflict of traditions," what
"variable standards of sexual conduct," what "obsolete marriage
laws and insincere observances" mean when they are translated into
individual sensations. The jig-saw puzzles have no solution. The
baffled creatures struggle over the verge of despair.</p>

<p>Helen, too, suffered from life, though I knew far less of her
inner world than I did of Sirrie's. She had the gifts of pride and
anger, and they are powerful talismans against the powers of
darkness. But she wept at nights, and I was an immense
disappointment of her expectations. I still wish I could atone for
that to her, though indeed it was not I, but the heroic standards
she had chosen for her lover and the wide divergence of our
ambitions, that tore up our romance. But if she wept with rage and
chagrin, I also had my share of these wakeful torments. I have told
already of a journey from Geneva to Paris, when my own mixed
jig-saw had the upper hand with me. I must have spent scores of
hours in my tortured endeavours to fit Helen and myself into
<i>one</i> happy and hopeful scheme of life.</p>

<p>I have been writing of the equal, proud woman as an ideal. In
Helen I met her. In the early days we were equal and proud to the
swaggering pitch. But unless the proud and equal woman travels an
identical road, how is one to keep her?</p>

<p>Neither Helen nor I need to be pitied as those others who are
weaker and less coherent are to be pitied; both of us have
something in us that sustains us and at last takes us out of all
such distresses. At an early limit we grow exasperated, damn the
jig-saw puzzle, and sweep it out of the way. The jig-saw puzzle is
not a primary thing with us. We are more wilful and more strongly
individualised than the common run of people. I have my philosophy
of life, my faith, my religion, and she has the compelling impulse
of her art.</p>

<p>A great actress is not the feminine equivalent of a great actor;
being a great actress is not the same thing as acting; it is a
thing peculiar to womankind. It is the sedulous development of a
personality to superb proportions. The actress can lie and think of
that effect she creates, that legend which grows, as I lie and
think of the great revolution that began before I was born, that
will continue after my death, to which I have given myself. We have
these preoccupations in which our egotisms are chambered and
protected; we know what we mean to do) we have banished all
essential confusions of purpose, the gnawing desires for some
particular but incompatible recognition, the hopes that are
dependent on others, remorse for things that seemed right and yet
became morally dislocated, the fluctuations of decision as one
standard gives place to another; these things wait disregarded for
the most part in the antechambers of our minds with little chance
of snatching a passing audience and none of invading the inner
places.</p>

<p>The schemes I entertain of a world republic, of a simplified
economic system, of a cleansing and illumination of the individual
and social and sexual relationships, may seem to aim only at the
outer forms of life. I may seem to be harsh and merciless towards
the dear old dignities and loyalties, the time-honoured social
inequalities, the quaint moral prejudices, the romantic
interpretations, the subtle, intricate, well-meaning religious
dogmatisms, amidst which the great mass of human beings struggle up
towards the light; but the brakes and thorns of this picturesque
jungle are not simply outward things. They penetrate to the nerve
centres and torture there.</p>

<p>The inner aspect of these things is hundreds of millions of
baffled, perplexed, frustrated brains. The inner aspect is
suppression and humiliation, the prowling onslaughts of thwarted
desires and discharges of unreasoning hate that never come to the
surface because of fear. We are all at sixes and sevens; those we
love disappoint our dearest expectations, and our acts recoil upon
us amazingly, disconcertingly, embitteringly. The great herd of
mankind wanders in strange and difficult and dangerous places; it
has no clear guidance towards the open lands, and its insecurity
and uncertainty determine the drama in well-nigh every brain that
is born into it. These things belong together, the outward
maladjustment of the race and its reflection in the individual
mind.</p>

<p>The peace of the world, the just and creative society, and the
common peace of the human soul can only come, each with and through
the other. Some may escape the common lot by the vigour of their
egotisms or the strength of their philosophy; some may reach
forward in creative work from the incompatibilities of the
present.</p>

<p>Some find a drug or a religious dogma sufficient for
stupefaction. The ordinary personal life is still a sensitised
meeting-place of conflicting forces that rather imagines itself to
be, than is as yet, an individual. These political, economic,
social, historical discussions, so far from being unreal, touch the
very core of reality; they are a sorting-out of the mixture of
moral jig-saw puzzles in which every individual is
entangled&mdash;a sorting-out that may at last leave the individual
man or woman with a consistent problem that is capable of
solution.</p>

<p>Biologists say that the greater part of our bodies is dead
matter or mere nutrition, our hair, our skins, our bones and teeth,
our blood. The only fully living reality is the protoplasmic thread
hidden away in nerves and fibres and cells. And of the whole
display of human life, the houses and cities and cultivations, the
markets and crowds and factories and schools, the only vital part
is really this struggle with the jig-saw puzzle of "What am I to
do?"</p>

<p>I return to this inner and hidden life. This is what feels, this
is what responds, this is what matters, this is what is. This is
the life that in the daytime and commonly we hide even from
ourselves. The night is its time for revelation. Then for all our
resistances we find ourselves taken and stripped and put upon the
rack of these blundering contradictions of standard and desire.
Then come writhings and cries. The angel and the ape appear. The
morning finds us already most sedulously forgetting that dreadful
interview with our bare selves. We dress, we examine our faces in
the glass to be sure that we are masked before we risk the
observation of our fellow-masqueraders.</p>

<p>The streets are alive with people, grave, decorous-looking
people. They pass intent upon their various businesses, with an air
of knowing exactly what they are and exactly what they are doing.
And last night this self-possessed young woman bit her pillow and
beat the air with clenched hands and cried, "0 God! 0 God! Shall I
never escape?" and that grave and respectable gentleman with the
gold-tipped cane stared out of his bedroom window at the dawn and
wished and came near contriving another man dead.</p>

<p>It is Clementina who has brought me down from my bird's-eye
survey of humanity to these troubles of the innermost. She has been
telling me things about herself that hitherto she has hidden. She
has been so gay and happy a companion that I did not realise she
could also be full of unspoken distresses. How blind and stupid we
can be even to those whom we meet continually and love dearly!</p>

<p>We walked up into those hills to the west of the Gourdon road as
we had arranged, and Mr. G. gave us one of the best of his days.
How few of the thousands who pass in their automobiles along that
starred and recommended track and stop at the celebrated viewpoints
and crane their necks over the grey battlements to look down into
the gorge below, suspect the sweet desolations, the clean cool
loveliness of the uplands they skirt! It is as if God had run short
of matter when he made the rocks and turf and little flowers up
there, and had woven in warm sunlight to complete the job. I lay on
a patch of turf beside her and talked of these traditions of
relationship about which I had been writing. No one, I said, has
fully measured the cruelties that could happen within the bonds of
marriage.</p>

<p>When poorish respectable people were tied together and had no
means of escape. The secret hatred, the ingenuities of vexation and
humiliation that might occur.</p>

<p>"And if people are free," Clementina demanded, "they cannot be
cruel?"</p>

<p>"Why need they be cruel? They can go away."</p>

<p>Clementina made no answer.</p>

<p>Presently I glanced up at her and she was sitting, chin in hand,
with that long beautiful back of hers drooping, so that all her
figure was a note of interrogation. She was not looking at me; she
was brooding on what she wanted to say to me.</p>

<p>"Clissoulaki," she said. "Do you think&mdash;Do you think you
have never tormented me?"</p>

<p>I considered it. "No."</p>

<p>"I want to tell you some things. You have been writing this
great book of yours about everything in earth&mdash;and whatever
used to be heaven, and you have come at last to women. You have
been all over the world and seen and done all sorts of things. You
know nearly everything, my dear. But do you know anything at all
about love?"</p>

<p>"I know you," I said.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I wish you did."</p>

<p>She had something prepared for me and so I waited for her to go
on. "I want to tell you things. Some of them seem ungracious. Some
of them are unfair. But I want to tell you them. I've hidden
them....</p>

<p>"You took me when I was an utter failure. I had gone down.
Heaven knows how far a woman can sink, or how long her natural
cowardice will force her to endure things, but anyhow I was very
low. I did not know how to set about killing myself. But my heart
had gone. I should have been glad to die. And then you came, the
friendly thing you are. Surely whatever you give I ought to take.
Life began again. Hope! How happy you have made me! What happy
times I have had here! And all the same you torment me. You give me
heartaches. I love you. I love you altogether. I give myself to you
with both hands. And you smile. And put me aside as if all that was
nothing."</p>

<p>She paused. "If you had not met me in the streets of Paris you
would not put me aside.</p>

<p>"No, don't interrupt me, my dear. I shouldn't have said that. I
want to tell you what I am telling you now while it is clear in my
mind. Perhaps that was not true. At least you need not notice it.
But I think it sometimes in the night. You should know I think it.
When a woman loves a man she forgets what she was or what he is.
She is not even grateful to him if she loves him. She just wants
him, and wants him with all her being. No other woman has ever
loved you as I love you, and no other woman ever will. The more you
give me, the happier and healthier I am here, the sweeter life is
with you, the more I am tormented by the thought that this is just
a holiday for you, a rest, and presently you will go away. All this
year I have been hiding that. I have been thinking it and hiding
it. It seems so ungracious, so unfair. Why should you not do so if
you chose to do so?</p>

<p>"Don't touch me, my dear. Now I have begun, let me show you my
heart....</p>

<p>"Night after night I have lain awake in my little
bedroom&mdash;the bedroom that is so pretty and gay with the things
you made me buy&mdash;and I have been tormented!... If I was to
lose you, then I think it were better I had died in Paris, before I
knew what happiness was. I am haunted perpetually by the fear of
losing you. And particularly when you have been away in England,
doing I don't know what. Always then I was sure you would never
come back to me. Something would happen. You would be killed. You
would be snatched away. Or simply&mdash;why should you come back to
me? You used to send me those little off-hand cards, telling me
nothing. Sometimes you missed three days. You were busy, I know.
But down here I was not busy. Three days here can be eternity.</p>

<p>"I used to come for great walks up over these hills. I have been
here sometimes, stumbling over the stones, belated, in the
twilight, afraid of sheep-dogs. Because I was still more afraid of
that little bedroom down below there.</p>

<p>"Misery! Misery beyond reason! I have stuffed the corner of my
sheet into my mouth to prevent myself crying out and waking those
English old maids in the next room."</p>

<p>"But had you no faith in me?"</p>

<p>"Faith! In the night! With you away!"</p>

<p>She turned upon me the eyes of an elf in despair. "You take love
so lightly ! You take it so easily! Love has come to you. Women
have loved you. And you know nothing of love."</p>

<p>I was to lose you, then I think it were better I had died in
Paris, before I knew what happiness was. I am haunted perpetually
by the fear of losing you. And particularly when you have been away
in England, doing I don't know what. Always then I was sure you
would never come back to me. Something would happen. You would be
killed. You would be snatched away. Or simply&mdash;why should you
come back to me? You used to send me those little off-hand cards,
telling me nothing. Sometimes you missed three days. You were busy,
I know. But down here I was not busy. Three days here can be
eternity.</p>

<p>"I used to come for great walks up over these hills. I have been
here sometimes, stumbling over the stones, belated, in the
twilight, afraid of sheep-dogs. Because I was still more afraid of
that little bedroom down below there.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-9" name="b6-9"></a>§ 9. CHANGE HANGS OVER US</h2>

<p class="first">THIS situation at the Villa Jasmin is, I perceive,
coming to an end. I return to earth again after my flight over past
and present and future, and find the securities and tranquillities
about this familiar writing-table dissolving and passing away. It
has pleased me so well to come and write here that I watch the end
approaching with a selfish pang. But always there has been a
certain unreality in this happy refuge; from the beginning it had a
touch of dream stuff in its composition.</p>

<p>It is a dream that seemed to have materialised more completely
than it has done. I dreamt it first in that train journey from
Geneva to Paris, and I wanted it and needed it so much that in some
way it was bound to exist. It was easy to take the happy chance of
Clementina and incorporate her and make her the priestess and
divinity of the place. True, it should have been a little low white
house and not pink as this one is, but I forgave it that for all
the other pretty details with which it surprised me.</p>

<p>I have always maintained that this place and this seclusion
could not last, that it was too serene and beautiful a setting to
be permanent. <i>Panta rhei</i>; its little fountain greeted me
with that reminder when first I came to it. But it was my belief
that it would be Clementina who would shatter it all, by confessing
herself bored, finding a more amusing and less preoccupied lover
and departing. I had always prepared myself to let her go, and
everything was in readiness to secure her going from the anxieties
and indignities of material need. I should not have stayed long
alone here. Each time I returned it was a delight to find her still
eager for my coming.</p>

<p>But it is I and not she from whom the decree of conclusion must
come. This freakish and fantastic menage has been founded on
distresses and hopes deferred, of which I had no inkling, and now
that this has been brought home to me, the dream fades.</p>

<p>It was Helen who used to talk of "coming through" a part.
Clementina has come through her part. She was the whimsical,
delightful, elfin visitant of the Villa Jasmin. That was the role I
thrust upon her. She chose to play at being utterly in love with
me, and I to be cold and preoccupied. We talked of the siege of the
Villa Jasmin. The siege is over and the play is done, and we find
ourselves man and woman face to face. She has come through her part
and it seems I am coming through mine.</p>

<p>While I was soaring up there in the air surveying "traditions of
relationship" and men and women in "general terms," I remarked,
among other memorable things, that much of the present unhappiness
of men and women was due to a reference to different standards;
that people imposed their own codes and expectations upon one
another and so almost unwittingly arranged conflicts and cruelties.
But this is exactly what I have been doing to Clementina. I have
assumed an extreme modernity in this antique mind of hers, held her
to the practice of it and treated her struggle against it as an
entertaining pose. I have made her angry and baffled her and
laughed at her a score of times and thought no more of it, and only
now do I apprehend that I have also made her and may still be
making her exceedingly unhappy.</p>

<p>I do not blame myself nor her for the creation of these
stresses. They have happened. They might have been foreseen, but I
did not foresee them. It was my impulse to make her free of me, to
refuse to buy her, to give her a position and a salary and a light
agreeable task beside me. That was well enough in its way. That she
chose to make me her lover was my good fortune. I did not ask it or
refuse it. The convention was that that might cease at any time,
that she was free to take another lover or do whatever might please
her. Her duties were to supervise my little house, stand between me
and servants, buy and arrange furniture for me as she thought
proper, lunch with me and companion me for the afternoon. Then with
a liberal gesture I dismissed her to her excellent pension, she a
free woman and I a free man. Here in Provence she could rest for a
time, here was peace and healing and self-respect for her, and when
she saw her way to a more attractive life I would help her to
achieve it. These were the handsome pretences of our bargain.</p>

<p>At the pension, people came and went, quite possibly interesting
people. I did not see them. She had two pleasant rooms, and we had
obliterated the bleak furnishing with oriental rugs and hangings
and a multitude of books. She could read, write poetry&mdash;if she
chose to write poetry&mdash;readjust her perplexed and broken Ii f
e. Down here in my gently modernised <i>mas</i> I could think and
work, come and go as my mood or my business interests required. If
I went away for long months or a year or so, that was my affair.
She could draw her salary, keep an occasional eye on the place,
travel if she felt disposed to do so&mdash;she had the means for
that. Jeanne could be trusted to mind the house. There was no need
that Clementina should fall in love with me, none that she should
fall so extravagantly in love with me and charge all our reactions
with passion.</p>

<p>But she has done so. She has gone beyond all the obligations of
our agreement. She has worked for me as no one has ever worked for
pay since time began. She has enveloped me with a tender personal
devotion. I too, quite insensibly, have lapsed from the hard
rationalism of my first intentions. She is the most to blame, but I
have been unwary. While I have been building up a conception of a
finer, freer mating in the future, the passing days have betrayed
me. A great affection has grown up between us now.</p>

<p>I do not know how necessary she has become to me, but it is
plain she has become very necessary. Her company, her conversation,
her ways, delight me as the warm sunshine delights me. I like the
sound of her now and the sight of her; I .find myself watching her
unawares; her tastes please me; she pleases me wonderfully. But
what is more than any of these things, her happiness and her
unhappiness have taken hold of me so that I can no longer hurt her
and be at peace.</p>

<p>But though there has been all this change and growth of feeling
between us, the forms and customs of our life here still follow the
light-hearted artificiality of our original treaty. Clementina is
still the domestic secretary who walks down at lunch-time from her
rooms at the pension to see that all is in order here, hushes the
barking of Titza if I am still writing or thinking, interviews the
gardener and the plumber and buys the material to re-cover the
chairs. And I come and go upon my mighty businesses and make it
plain that I am scandalised when she tempers her services with
endearments and caresses. There is a convention which even Jeanne
affects to observe that we are not lovers. But all this, which was
so bright and entertaining a year ago, rings hollow now and more
hollow every day. She wants to be more easily with me, and I want
her more at hand.</p>

<p>Yet Villa Jasmin is a little house, and the silence of this
study was very vital to me. In this place I can conceive no other
way of life than the one we have led here.</p>

<p>This is the situation Clementina, with her face of involuntary
distress, brings to a crisis. Her fears and instincts run ahead and
confront her with the riddle of what is to come. "I love you
wholly," she says. "I have put my life in your hands. I have no
other life now but the life you made for me here. Do you mean to go
away from me? What are you going to do with me now that the book
you set out to write here is coming to an end?"</p>

<p>She may count upon it that I shall not go away from her. We
shall go away together when the good days of the Villa Jasmin have
reached their allotted term.</p>

<p>But I do not yet know how: we shall go away nor whither we shall
go. I have been so intent upon the diagrams of my world that this
problem takes me by surprise. Until I have some inkling of the
solution I do not know what to tell her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-10" name="b6-10"></a>§ 10. CLEMENTINA'S IDEA OF
LOVE</h2>

<p class="first">WE began our life here in a vein of genial make
believe, and the play still goes on and masks the forms of the very
deep and very far-reaching relationships that have com into being
between us. Clementina has thrown a passionate love into our sunny
comedy, and I have pretended not to see. We two love each other
very greatly now, but each after his and her own fashion. The
fashions are very different. I am not sure what we shall find when
we cease to pretend, and come face to face with each other.</p>

<p>Clementina professes love. She is my instructress in this great
science, this great art. It is her occupation, her subject. For
her, love is an absolute; for me it is a thing to examine and
question. She speaks of love as of something that women understand
by nature and that men do not; they have to learn. It is a
difference between us as fundamental as the difference of sex, a
matter that affects every possible view about the position and
rights and wrongs and all the standards of women. Love, she
maintains, is created and imparted by women.</p>

<p>This is frankly opposed to my treatment of love, throughout this
book, throughout my life. I have dealt with it as something as
incidental as beautiful, as something that may come into a "sexual
relationship" like the fires of red and gold that come suddenly
from windows when the sunlight is reflected by them. And I have
treated it always as a thing as much masculine as feminine.</p>

<p>I have told something of Clementina's mixed origins and varied
misadventures. I do not know whether these things make her the most
unique or the most representative of women, a freak or a
compendium. I do not know whether we two are as much man and woman
as Adam and Eve, or whether we are queer accidents of our time and
of no significance to anyone except ourselves. Clementina has no
doubt in the matter. She is Eve. Rarely it is "I and you" with her.
"A woman feels," she says, or, "That is the way with a man."</p>

<p>I have argued with her that this love of hers, in its abundance
and completeness, is not really a natural nor a fundamental thing
at all. I declare it is an artificial thing, a disposition, and not
a necessity. It does not come by instinct. It is developed, it is
secondary; it is a thing of culture. It is a dogmatic thing, and
she has wilfully given herself to its exaggeration and
glorification. She has given herself to personal love exactly as
some women give themselves to love in religion. Her love has the
sedulous quality of a religious devotion. She searches her
conscience for imperfections and disloyalties in her love in order
to cast them out.</p>

<p>"But that is the nature of women," she pleads. "It is religion.
It is the same thing. Or rather&mdash;religion is love. One sort of
love. My life for you is exactly like religion. If&mdash;I cannot
imagine it&mdash;but if I thought of any man but you, it would be a
sin. That is the great commandment. Thou shalt have no other love
but me."</p>

<p>She argues very subtly about this specialty of hers.</p>

<p>We all want to be held together within ourselves, she asserts,
echoing my own thoughts in that. We all need interior unification
for our peace of mind. I have this strange conception of world
revolution, of the great creative work of setting up a World
Republic, to which I give myself. By that I unify my aims and my
life. She cannot unify upon that. "A woman" cannot unify on such
great abstractions. But her personal love holds her together in
just the same fashion. If she were to lose it, she would "go to
pieces," just as I should go to pieces if I lost belief in my
revolutionary idea.</p>

<p>"But why not religion?" I ask.</p>

<p>"A woman must see and touch," she says. "Women are more
immediate. In convents now there are thousands of women praying,
longing, desiring for what they call a vision. They call it a
vision because they are taught to do so, but what they want is a
tangible reality. For them images are a necessity. I tell you it is
exactly that which holds me to love. You are my image. Have you
noted the <i>life</i> they put into Catholic images&mdash;the
blood, the distresses, the tears? Mortifications, inflictions,
pain, these things comfort religious women because they are
contact. Sacrifices, new refinements of material devotion, fill
their minds. But even then one must have faith. Without that the
images will not even sigh or turn their eyes. That is why I failed
to be religious. At one time, almost, I had faith."</p>

<p>"You were a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"But things my father had said about the Catholics kept on
seeming true. When he was not quite sober my father could be a
wonderful theologian. He undermined me with things I hardly knew I
was hearing at the time. But I found I could not believe. When I
prayed, something he had woven into me said: 'You're not believing
all that. You're just thinking you believe it!' And it was a live
thing I wanted and not a spirit, a thing with a body, a man to
respond and answer&mdash;you."</p>

<p>But then, said I, bringing in St. Augustine against her, she was
not in love with me, she was in love with love.</p>

<p>"You complain that you are all directed to me and that I am
directed away from you," I said. "But that is not true. You are no
more turned to me than I to you. You are turned to love, and you
are trying continually to make me also centre my life on love."</p>

<p>She can meet that with no rational argument. "It is you I love,"
she says.</p>

<p>There she stops with an absolute statement. No analysis avails
here. This love, which has embodied itself in me, has become an
inseparable, organic part of herself. It is exorbitant, but she has
loved so plainly and consistently that I can no more deny the
reality of this love of hers than the reality of her soft brown
neck or her shining eyes.</p>

<p>It is an intensively possessive love. It impels her to invade my
liberties. I like flying, and at times when the skies are clear the
plutocrat in me asserts itself, and I scrap my railway ticket
hither and charter an aeroplane from London to Antibes. A little
while ago I flew from here to Geneva. But she has a fantastic dread
of flying accidents; she will not distinguish between the many
deaths that happen during training and experiments, and the rare
casualties of passenger flights. Her discipline is not good enough
to prevent her making appeals to me to promise, promise never to
fly. I am in a quandary. I argue the matter because it goes right
to the roots of our relationship. All my disposition is against
such restrictions, but her despair is real. I make no promise, but
my last two journeys here have been by boat and train, under
protest.</p>

<p>"If you loved me," I say, "you would let me do what pleases me
best."</p>

<p>"But if you should be killed!"</p>

<p>"It is part of a man's job to be killed now and then."</p>

<p>Her tenderness entangles me. I cannot have the swift, sweet
delight of the high air because she has infected me with a vision
of herself intolerably alone, left desolate because I have seen fit
to crash and burn myself to death. That thought pursues me now up
among the clouds. I should feel the meanest thing in creation if I
found myself rushing down to a disaster. I could not die with
self-respect. Her tearful "told-you-so" would reproach my last
moments. But if men are to be afraid with the fears of loving
women, how can they ever be anything but afraid?</p>

<p>Yet also this possessiveness flows into a hundred gracious
thoughts and services. It is a very captivating thing to know
oneself cared for, thought for, and sure of willing agreement. I
cannot tell of the absurd little attentions she shows me. They are
too humble and too touching. Always when I need her no other thing
may intervene, she ,is ready for walk or expedition and any help I
wish from her. How often she effaces herself! How often has she
kept a smiling face when she was faint with fatigue, until some
little thing betrayed the hidden trouble!</p>

<p>She disciplines herself on account of love. I discover her
suppressing her impulses, developing a tremendous self-control she
did not possess a year ago. We are both extremely hot-tempered, but
years have made me quick to arrest and recall and repair what I can
of the evil of an angry act. But her instinct for expression is
vigorous. Not for nothing are the Greeks said to be the first
people in history to make a rich and abundant use of language. And
she has an over-sensitive vindictiveness begotten by her years of
imposed inferiorities and humiliations. She used to watch for petty
injustices from me and examine every careless criticism as an
attack.</p>

<p>I should find it hard to describe one of our storms in detail.
They sprang from minute wants of consideration on my part, from
impalpable nothings, from a clumsy French phrase of mine or an
English expression misunderstood. Then suddenly, in the course of a
walk, at our lunch table, my sunny, happy companion would vanish,
give place to a white-faced creature with wicked eyes, suffering
unendurably, full of a wild passion to hum mate and wound.</p>

<p>Very deep in Clementina's heart is resentment at life. She was
defrauded, ill-treated. Hers is more than the common resentment of
those who start at a disadvantage; it has been embittered. Then at
last she found me, and she has been building up and reconstructing
her life upon me. She has turned once more, after defeat,
defilement, and disaster, to love. But she has to hold on hard to
love. Sometimes she seems to find it quite easy to love me. But her
grip is only now beginning to be sure. At first trivial accidents
could loosen it. She would find herself slipping from the position
she wanted so desperately to maintain.</p>

<p>It has always been some quite little thing that seemed to reveal
to her the earthen substance of her god, a casual selfishness, a
careless assumption. Then for a time I became just another of those
men who had trampled on her life, one of those beings who trample
over all life, taking, exacting, disregarding, making the world
despair.</p>

<p>I did not understand at first. I would shrug my shoulders and
meet her "temper" with a flinty face.</p>

<p>But these quarrels that came out of nothingness are
disappearing. They would last in the beginning for a day or
so&mdash;when she would not come down to the Villa Jasmin, when she
gave me to understand she was packing for some unknown destination
in this world or the next. How stonily I treated her then! How
little I tried to find a way back for her! Later on these outbursts
diminished in their violence and persistence. They carne down to
hours. Recently they have been mere jars of ten minutes or so, and,
now I come to think of it, there have been hardly any for some
time.</p>

<p>This change from fitful conflicts to serenity has been all her
doing. She has taken that disposition to swift resentment in hand,
just as a religious novice is trained to deal with a besetting sin.
She has fortified her faith in me, until at last that jealous
questioning of my quality has been almost overcome. So,
deliberately and wonderfully, she has built up such a relationship
with me as I had never known before, as I have never before
believed could exist between two human beings. It is her work.</p>

<p>When last I came back here from England I discovered a portable
typewriter in her sitting-room. She had not expected me, and she
had thrown a piece of Indian silk over it. "I did not mean you to
see that until I had had all my lessons," she said. She had bought
the thing and gone to the school in Grasse and was already
reasonably competent&mdash;and she had taken all that trouble
simply because I had been sometimes put out by waiting for the
typist who clears up these writings for me in Cannes.</p>

<p>"After all, why should you send your typing away? I can do
it."</p>

<p>"Why should you? It is toilsome and dull."</p>

<p>"I want to share in what you are doing. I want to take trouble
for you."</p>

<p>"But you were to study for yourself. You were to read here. You
were to write poetry. You were to find yourself."</p>

<p>"I've lost my interest in poetry. It was always poor stuff I
wrote. Always. Since I have been here it has got more and more like
the devotional books they used to give me in my Catholic days. I
can't bear it. Love can be made ridiculous if you write it
down&mdash;the more you love, the more strained and exaggerated it
seems, and yet it is all true. And I want to know about this book
of yours."</p>

<p>"You said once it was just about Marx and politics."</p>

<p>"I know better now."</p>

<p>Then with a change to vexation:</p>

<p>"Don't you see that I want to be useful? Don't you want me to be
useful? Don't you see that I want to make myself necessary to you?
Is it nothing to you that I Want to be necessary? I'm reading
English. To get back my English perfectly. To cure my spelling.
Every day when you are away from here I go into Grasse. I study.
What else is there to do? Commercial stuff. <i>Comptabilité</i>.
Sums, you call it! It isn't sums. It's business. I was always bad
at calculation. Now I want to know about these business things. Oh!
you think it's absurd. You <i>laugh!</i>"</p>

<p>"My dear!" I said. "No need for you to cry. But why do you not
do work of your own? Why do you cast away and destroy everything
that gives you a life outside mine? I'm writing out my own faith
here, getting my ideas into order for the last spell of work that
is left to me. Why don't you do the same thing for yourself, beside
me? I am such a preposterous thing to worship&mdash;old,
egotistical, slow in all sorts of ways&mdash;and the world we can
serve is so complex, so full of splendid possibilities! I am
ashamed to have such a slave. It makes me ridiculous. It confronts
me with what I am. It makes me feel my hundred limitations. I love
you. Don't I tell you so? Be my ally."</p>

<p>"An ally, yes&mdash;if I am always at your side?"</p>

<p>"After the same ends, my dear, wherever they lead us."</p>

<p>"No. At your side. The world means nothing to me unless I am
with you. It can be cruel. It can be crowded and unjust and ugly. I
do not care what becomes of it, as you do. After I have lost you I
do not care if it is all burnt with fire. I do not want the world
or life or anything except with you."</p>

<p>That is where Clementina stands.</p>

<p>She is certainly not acting or lying; if this was <i>not</i> her
inevitable self, it is now her unalterable self. Is this indeed
womanhood? Or is there some difference in race and quality between
Clementina and the other women I have known? It was a woman
speaking to another woman, who said: "Thy people shall be my people
and thy God my God." Milton may have known more than we moderns
give him credit for when he wrote of the devotion of Adam and Eve:
"He for God only; she for God in him."</p>

<p>Clementina is unabashed at my argument that she has made a
culture of love. "Every woman," she says, "who is properly a woman
wants to make a culture of <i>love</i>. That does not mean that
love is artificial because we cherish and protect it and make much
of it. You might as well say a baby was artificial and not in the
nature of women."</p>

<p>Still I doubt if this splendour of self-abandon is either wholly
or permanently Clementina. For a time it is her self-expression. It
seems to her to be her complete being. But I have known her for
less than two years, and I have no data yet for the full cycle of
her life. This may be a season, the high summer of love. This may
be a phase in which many needs and desires converge and fuse. It
may be Clementina's life will not always pour along this narrow
channel of personal obsession. I am, I reflect, not merely
Clementina's man, her mate and her lover; I am as yet her whole
family, I am her children unborn. She is not only my companion and
mistress; towards me she is also an arrested and perverted mother.
I have monopolised the love of a household.</p>

<p>There, it seems, lies the clue not only to the inequalities of
our passion, but to the nature of the new life to which we have to
turn now that the routines of the Villa Jasmin are drawing to an
end. For my own part, I confess, it has troubled me and restrained
me and also made the daily substance of my life unprecedentedly
happy to monopolise for these months of sunshine I have spent here
the love of a household.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-11" name="b6-11"></a>§ 11. WHAT IS THIS LOVE?</h2>

<p class="first">IF this insatiable craving, this tender
prostration that possesses Clementina is love, then it is true what
she says: "I have never loved, and I do not know what love is."</p>

<p>Perhaps what is true of me is true of all normal men.</p>

<p>There may seem to have been some moonlight resemblance to this
radiant warmth in my desire for Helen and in my distress at her
loss, but the resemblance goes no further than the desire and the
distress. I wanted with an equal vigour indeed, but in an
altogether different fashion. There was no devotion, no trace of
self-subjugation; I did not change at all, I wanted Helen to
change; though I demanded much I gave nothing, and our last two
years of association were years of antagonism as strong almost as
the necessity we felt for each other. I have never given myself to
anyone. I have never wanted to give myself to anyone. Either, then,
I am abnormal, or Clementina is abnormal, or here is a profound
spiritual difference between the sexes that I am only now beginning
to apprehend.</p>

<p>Here am I, very much in love. I am thinking now for a large part
of my time of how I am to adjust my life so as to take Clementina
wholly into it and to make her as completely happy as I can. I do
this because in my fashion I love her, her happiness is my
happiness. But let me tell the truth about myself plainly. Even now
she is not necessary to me. I could and I should go on without her.
I should suffer but I should go on. She is not necessary and no one
has ever been necessary to me. I cannot conceive that anyone could
ever be necessary to me. And what is more, I am not even necessary
to myself. That is to say, I am not afraid to die. I am not
distressed that presently I shall be completely dead, nor to think
that in a little while I shall be altogether forgotten. Ultimately
these things do not matter to me in the least.</p>

<p>Now Clementina is in life, inextricably in life. Life means so
much to her that she could even, if it disappointed her dreadfully,
commit suicide. It matters to her like that, and her suicide would
be a real tragedy. But I do not believe that it would be possible
for me to commit suicide. Or to make any very incredible exertions
to escape death. Only by over-statement can I express what I am
feeling after in these sentences. Let me say, then, that
fundamentally I am outside life, receiving experiences. I like and
want to do things with life; but I am not of the substance of life,
any more than I am of the substance of matter.</p>

<p>It may be that here I am over-defining a difference between
myself and Clementina. No doubt there are less than fundamental
contrasts here. I have the resignation of sixty and she has the
vitality of thirty, and I am Northern and metaphysical and she has
all the positive realism of her Mediterranean blood. But after all
deductions have been made on these scores I am still disposed to
think that the fundamental difference that remains is one that
holds good between the masculine and the feminine all up and down
the scale of being. Masculine and feminine, I write, and not men
and women, because in all men there is something of the woman, and
in all women a touch of virility. Nature has never completely
sorted out the sexes in any mammalian species. Nevertheless, the
biological distinction of masculine and feminine is as plain as
east and west. The female is the life itself, the continuation; the
male is an experimental projection from life. It is in our nature
as males to try and to do, to create and to pass away; it is in the
nature of women as feminine to seize upon our distinctive selves
and to seek to preserve and perpetuate them. So it has been between
the sexes since the beginnings of life; so it must continue to be
for the race to survive. And how in any other fashion can the race
go forward, and endure?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="b6-12" name="b6-12"></a>§ 12. SHADOWS OF THE END</h2>

<p class="first">I DO not see how I can ever part from the Villa
Jasmin or let the simple peace of this room be disarranged. I shall
try to buy this little house or get a lease that will at least make
it ours for all our lives. And we will come back here ever and
again. But from this time forth it ceases to be what it has been to
me hitherto. For a time it was necessary for me to be alone, and
here in the mornings and evenings and nights I have been alone, and
I have been able to assemble my ideas and view my world simply. The
outline and substance of my book exist; this end is incomplete, and
Book Three still reads like chunks of a prospectus, but the thing
is shaped. This may be the last evening for a long time that I
shall spend in solitude at this table.</p>

<p>I have thought for a year and a half that, so far as Provence
went, I was resting and reviewing life; but I discover that it is
here, and neither in London nor at Downs-Peabody that I have been
most actively living. That casual young woman of the Parisian
sunset has become by imperceptible degrees the dominant figure in
my thoughts and life.</p>

<p>There is only one way to deal with our situation, and that is
for me to marry her. That has been plain to me for some days. She
has never betrayed a thought of marriage; she has had so
extraordinary a training in social abasement from the days of
Dou-Dou onward; and at first I believe it will dismay and terrify
her to think of herself as a wife. She will imagine immense
establishments, mysterious social duties, crowded functions, a
stupendous strain, and it will take some time to dispel these
terrors. They will be dispelled and she will have to marry me, even
though she is carried squealing and protesting to the altar. I
shall have to work out some way of living&mdash;a house near Paris,
or in Touraine or Normandy or Brittany perhaps&mdash;in which
methods of housekeeping and social procedures will not be too
strange and difficult for her; and there she will gradually
realise, what I have realised long ago, that she has considerable
administrative ability, and will rapidly become a house-proud
woman. There I can build her up socially.</p>

<p>She shall be slowly accustomed to the austere and dreadful
manners of the English, and when by carefully selected sample
visitors she is sufficiently indurated, I will take her to London.
It will amuse no end of people to find me at last a married man. I
would like to take her to London in early June, and walk with her
through St. James' Park in the morning when Lu-Lu Harcourt's
herbaceous perennials are at their best. We will feed the
water-fowl and turn back to look at the towers and pinnacles of
Westminster. Then we will taxi to Hyde Park Corner and walk on by
way of the rhododendra paths to the Serpentine and lunch in the
pavilion in the open air. Or, perhaps better, we will go by the
trees in blossom and the flower-beds right through Kensington
Gardens to the High Street and lunch in that grim room in the big
hotel where Orpen's Chef was once wont to preside. Afterwards we
win visit that little sunk garden by Kensington Palace. She thinks
London is a cramped, sombre, unbeautiful place, not to be compared
with the artistic eloquence of Paris, and this may put her in a
better frame of mind.</p>

<p>In that house we shall get I want her to have children. I see no
reason why we should not have a son or so, and it is very important
that we should. It is very important that Clementina's affections
should come out of the canon in which they flow at present and
spread themselves. She will have great scope in a nursery. The
sooner that comes the better.</p>

<p>It did not seem to matter so much when I chanced upon Clementina
in Paris that I was a man close upon fifty-nine and she was under
thirty. It has not been a very troublesome fact here. But now that
things have become thus serious and practical between us, it is a
fact I have to take into very careful consideration. I have to
think of her whole life. It is a result of Clementina's disastrous
upbringing that she has never troubled to think so far on as to see
me aged or dead; her mind has been filled by the ambition to become
my assured and inseparable mistress, and after that&mdash;suicide
or endurance. That was her training. There are moments when I can
find satisfaction in the thought of kicking Monsieur Dou-Dou, that
Catholic young gentleman, her first and chief trainer, hard and
continuously. She has accepted from everyone the role of a scrap of
social wastage. Her mind even now does not go beyond a vision of
that scrap in love and in luck. But indeed she is as good a woman
as any woman, and it shall not be my fault if she does not, after
all, get the full measure of life. She will not do that unless she
is able to grow out of me before some hitch of health or accident
brings out the disparity of our years. When our children come she
will be a little distracted from me. She will love me just as much
but not so actively and consciously. She will be more in the
nursery and I shall be away in the study. Quite unawares she will
acquire new habits, new interests; she is still a growing creature.
Even down here I have marked how she has read and thought and
extended her curiosities. I shall go on with this work I have
plotted out for myself, always a little detached from her. She will
be less eager to participate when she is more fully employed.</p>

<p>It has never been my habit to think about death, but latterly,
once or twice, it has occurred to me that there were limits to
one's right to behave as though one was immortal. One should begin
to think of the delicate sensitive tentacles of affection and
dependence that tie other people to oneself, as the final
interruption becomes nearer and more probable. One has failed to
live completely well if too large and painful a gap is left by
one's going. The ripe fruit should fall off without tearing. The
successors should be ready, the plan of campaign imparted, and no
one should he monopolised, as in our youth we may monopolise those
we love.</p>

<p>It is no ungraciousness to Clementina if I plan, not so much to
break as to divert some of the threads in this matted web of
feeling which she, dear spider of the heart that she is, has woven
out of her living self about me. I see myself as a man of
seventy-five or so, I hope not senile I dread that, but going easy,
working and handing the work on as Yorke is doing now, and she a
woman of four-and-forty, full of life, busy with many activities,
our sons about her; making a domestic deity of me no doubt, a
position I shall be well content to fill in her world, subject to
the emendations of my sons, but no longer living as she does now,
upon my direct reactions. More and more I shall be accepted and
taken for granted by her. I shall be less looked to for initiatives
and interests. And at last a death may be achieved that will be
ceremonial rather than tragic.</p>

<p>That is how I plan our life. I am a little amused to find myself
making this plan, for plainly it is a retrogression. This is the
old-fashioned marriage in which I have never believed, and I am
linking myself to a woman of an ancient type according to ideas
that are to be found in their full explicitness rather in the
immemorial traditions of a Hindu family than in our modern world.
But for that Clementina and accident are to blame. She has said
many acute and some very profound things to me, but none more
memorable than her outcry that it was not fair to treat women on
terms of equality unless they were prepared for it.</p>

<p>Never was a woman less prepared for it than Clementina. I do not
think that I have gone back upon my old opinions materially, but I
have&mdash;for my own case, anyhow&mdash;suspended them. I still
think that in the progressive society of the future, sex will be a
controlled and used and subordinate thing, that love will defer to
and mingle with creative passion, and that there will be a very
considerable assimilation of the sexes. They will become more alike
in costume, bearing and behaviour. That is already going on, and it
is most manifest in the new and northern societies. But it has a
long way to go, it has to disentangle itself from a jungle of
complex inheritances, and it has to evolve its proper social
conventions before men and women can meet on terms of real
equality. By all means let us help this development forward, but do
not let men fall into the error of anticipating it to the hurt of
women.</p>

<p>For nearly a couple of centuries advanced people have been
making premature attempts at an unchartered freedom of
relationship, without a proper regard for the handicaps of women.
Shelley is a typical instance of this logically fair freedom which
works out in practice as facile abandonment, cruelty and atrocious
injustice. Shelley did all he did to women, I fully realise, in
good faith, but all the Shelley-like adventures that go on about us
are not in good faith. By all means let us treat women openly on
equalitarian terms, but not in our secret thoughts. In truth they
have not our weight of egotism, they have not our disregardfulness
of aim. Commonly as it comes about, they are younger than we are. A
man must hold himself responsible for the woman he deals with. The
last concomitant of freedom she should have is the one that is
first thrust upon her, responsibility. Let women hold women
responsible for all they do; that is their affair, not ours. We
have not the right.</p>

<p>And, anyhow, whatever progress the world has made towards free
and equal womanhood, Clementina and I are, as a couple, far behind.
She accepts, welcomes and cultivates the subordinate role. She puts
herself defenceless in my hands, and she would always have put
herself defenceless into somebody's hands. I have to protect her
and foresee for her. I have to take care of her life.</p>

<p>That is why I shall insist upon marrying her. So far as I can
read history the wife has always been something inferior to the
free princess. She has been private property. I will not flood the
reader with archaeological lore and quote from the Spartans to the
Zulus and from Atkinson and Weismann upon the point. I shall marry
her to direct and take care of her, because I am older, stronger,
and better placed than she. I will not continue with her as my
mistress after our <i>éclaircissements</i>. To the best of my
ability in my own poor practice in life I have made love to my
mistresses on free and equal terms. But a woman who is in
Clementina's position must be covenanted and ensured.</p>

<p>This is the logic of our situation. The reality is that I am
filled with tenderness and solicitude for Clementina, that I mean
to do all I can for her life, and that if the logic were all the
other way round it would not make the least difference to what I am
resolved we are to do.</p>

<p>I do not know where we shall go from this place nor what our
next arrangements will be. I shall marry her soon. The particular
dispositions to make will probably rest with her. What she asks for
she can have. We may take our car on a sort of house-hunting
honeymoon, westward towards the heart of France. My work will no
longer be her rival and her danger, and she will, I know, do
everything in her power to forward it in our reconstructed
life.</p>

<p>In this dear peace and sunshine I have put my mind in order, and
I have a far clearer idea than ever I had before of what I want to
do with my world. Meditation is a good thing in so far as it
contemplates an ultimate translation into action. For long spells
of time out of the better part of two years I have pursued this
meditation here, surveyed and questioned my world, until the great
revolution has come out plain and sure, as the inevitable form and
subject of all I shall henceforth do. It has been, all things
considered, not so very unlike a piece of industrial research,
leading to a reorganisation in method. I must go on now to the
practical application of what this scrutiny of my will and
experience has taught me. I must take this set of ideas to a number
of people, and if they are sympathetic, consult them about its
flotation.</p>

<p>Flotation is the word I choose deliberately. I contemplate the
promotion of a new scheme for doing the business of mankind. I want
to try over this conception of a World Republic, as something now
ripe and seeking realisation, with a variety of minds. If it seems
to stand the test, or if it requires only partial amendment, then
the rest of my life must be occupied in activities that will
contribute to it. That is the logical development of the situation.
This germinating World Republic needs a literature; it has to
invade the press; it must develop a propaganda for the young and
youthful-minded. It has to discover, educate, and organise its
adherents, and test the uses of every form of persuasion and
publicity. It must develop a multitude of subsidiary schemes and
define their relations one to another. There must be a
discrimination between businesses, organisations, institutions,
that with more or less modification are capable of incorporation in
a world scheme of human activities, and those which are essentially
useless, obstructive, or antagonistic. It has to pervade the minds
and discourse of publicists and leading men and outstanding figures
with a realisation of this creative process, the developIng plot of
the drama in which their activities go on. Just as they apprehend
and secure it, are they significant and fit for history. Just as
they disregard it are they trivial, mere nuisances and
obstructions, supernumeraries, voices, and figures in the
crowd.</p>

<p>Things seem clear in the Villa Jasmin with a clearness that may
be delusive. I want to try over all this that I have thought and
written down here, on other active men, to discover why they are
not already exactly of my way of thinking. I have to test my ideas
by this question; how far has this man or that man whom I have
sound reason to respect, got towards my positions? How far is he,
within himself and less explicitly, of my way of thinking? I want
to try it out on Roderick for example, and on one or two others of
our directors who have imaginative breadth. I want to see what
resistances Dickon will put up to my creed of creative action. And
there are a number of other men against whom I would like to put
it. A man who rouses my curiosity greatly is Sir Alfred Mond of
Brunner Mond and Co., that kindred octopus which runs so parallel
and interdigitates so frequently with our great network. He is
difficult to talk to, nervous, and either aggressive or defensive.
He flounders about in politics, and goes from party to party rather
absurdly. I would give much to know what is his real philosophy,
and if fundamentally he is anything coherent and determined. What
at the bottom of his heart, if he has ever gone to such depths,
does he think of parliamentary methods, of crown, of empire, of the
war and the rule of the world? Or does he just accept it all as a
cat accepts house and master? Some of <i>his</i> kind do, but not I
think he. I must seek him out and a score of other men, Lord Weir,
for example, and Sir Robert Hadfield, who have manifestly very
active minds which range far beyond merely business activities.
What is clear in them? What is implicit in them? And then I come to
the financial side of human activities. Keynes I must certainly
know more of, and such a man in and out of politics and finance as
McKenna. I have never yet got to grips with a banker largely
because my ideas hitherto have been too unformed to give him a
definite hold in return for my own. Dickon declares that the minds
of all financial people run about between fences, and that if they
were not trained to respect their fences they would become too
original and embezzle, but I believe that even now a number of them
do look over their fences without such serious results, and that if
they were encouraged they would look over quite a lot, and make all
sorts of illuminating remarks about the ways of the economic
process.</p>

<p>One sort of man I shall pursue with my inquiries will be of the
type of Lord Buckmaster, with whom the Rettinger-Dunton process has
recently brought me into contact. He is a business man&mdash;in
oil. Before he came into oil, he was a lawyer and a statesman; he
was Lord Chancellor, if I remember rightly, under Mr. Asquith. I
have met him socially several times, and always he has pleased me.
He talks well, thinks finely and powerfully, and he must have a
very wide knowledge of both the political and economic worlds. Now
how far is the present system, the parades of the royalties, the
tedious humbug of parliamentary proceedings, the manoeuvres of the
political groups, the social round, "patriotism" and our
international rivalries, all this life that is so unreal and
unsatisfactory to me, how far is it real and sufficient and final
to him? How far does such a man merely go upon the surface of it,
and how far does he penetrate? I cannot but believe he penetrates.
And if he penetrate, how far does he see the revolution as I see it
and shape his thoughts and acts and conscience in relation to it?
Has he an established sense of it as a coherent process? As I have?
I am immensely curious about his sort of man. I name Buckmaster
because he comes into my head as a convenient representative, but I
could name a score of such men, able, prominent, successful, who
seem to me manifestly too fine-minded to be satisfied with the play
of human affairs as it is staged to-day, and yet who go about as if
they were. Why are they not more explicitly restless and
revolutionary?</p>

<p>Then I want to explore the socialists. The Labour Party&mdash;or
it may be the Independent Labour Party, for I made no note at the
time&mdash;has recently come out with a scheme for dealing with the
coal mines. It is in many ways an excellent scheme, a large scale
scheme of scrapping and reorganisation for exhaustive production
that would make all British coal one business. It would override
many of the arrangements of Romer, Steinhart, Crest and Co., but
such things could be readjusted. It could be bolder upon the
possibilities of civilising the miner than it is, and of changing
his methods of work. Of course the Labour politicians the world
knows best, those men who make speeches with their fists and monkey
about in court suits, are as capable of carrying out such a scheme
as Jeanne here, my excellent cook, is of taking a modern battleship
into action. But I find in this report the hands of at least two
men, Tawney and Greenwood, who are manifestly both men of wide
knowledge and evident power. They must know as well as I do what
their party, as a party, amounts to, what a mere cave in
liberalism, what a dreary haggle for office it is. Their
imaginations are certainly as broadly constructive as mine. Tawney
is a man I would welcome upon the board of Romer, Steinhart, Crest
and Co. almost as warmly as I would rejoice at the departure of
Crest. He would be better occupied with us than in making schemes
that can never be realised by the associates he has chosen. Why is
he in one camp and Keynes in another and I in a third, while the
Crests and the Percies and their kind in massive unity, with
nothing but their instincts and traditions to hold them together,
can impede progress for a whole lifetime?</p>

<p>I mention Tawney and Greenwood as I have mentioned Buckmaster
and the others, casually. They have happened to come first into my
mind. They are types, not abnormalities. If I set about it I could
make a list of some hundreds of Englishmen alone dispersed through
the worlds of finance and industry and public affairs who are of a
quality that makes their collective futility and their acquiescence
in existing things amazing.</p>

<p>Now either my conception of a World Republic as the proper form
of life presented to my intelligent and active contemporaries is
false, or else it is latent, or it exists in some similar form, but
perhaps under disguising terms, not as yet completely assembled, in
the minds of all such men as those I have cited. They are all of
them men at least as able and intelligent as myself; most of them
are much abler and more intelligent; our brains must be all
similarly constituted, and, with a few variations of proportion and
angle, they know the facts as I know them. Of course', they are
where they are, as I am where I am, without premeditation. They
have got in and come through to it and found themselves at
forty-five or fifty-five or sixty-five before they could make an
extensive survey of things about them. But now? After the war, in
the midst of the most illuminating stresses and troubles, with the
needs of the world growing plain? Surely they must be awakening, as
I have awakened, to possibilities that transcend all accidents of
association with nation, caste, party, office, or firm.</p>

<p>There are times when it seems to me that these men must be
indeed far cleverer and far more subtle than myself, and that they
see all that I do and far beyond. But that through some further
subtlety they go on being scattered and divided one against
another. At any rate, I have to come out of this retirement now in
which I have been able to spin the web of my world state so
happily, and I have to find just what it is, in my scheme or in my
fellows, that bars its conscious use as a guide in public affairs.
Then, with such adaptations as may be needed, I have to set about
the work of getting them together in relation to it, first in
groups and then through literary, journalistic, and suchlike
activities, and then with a conscious creative direction of
monetary and industrial developments.</p>

<p>It is not a task I shall do well. I know that quite plainly. I
have no such powers of persuasion and combination and arrangement
as old Roderick, for instance. I am a sociable man, but not
associative. I am by nature a solitary worker, and almost all my
best results have been got with inanimate material, free of all
malice or vexatious feelings, in the laboratory, in the open, or in
the works' apparatus and routines. But the logic of my faith
requires me to go on to this work until at least some abler person
takes it on from me and does it better. As old Lubin would have put
it, the word of the Lord is upon me and I have now to leave this
pleasant wilderness and go down to London, that mighty Babylon, and
prophesy. The trouble is that nowadays prophesying is a skilled
occupation. The happy days when all that was wanted in a prophet
was a large staff, some simple slogan, and a goatskin over his
shoulders, and all that he had to do was to go down to the king and
make himself unpleasant by repeating his slogan harshly and
inexorably, have gone. I conceive that I have to contribute to the
early stages of a very intricate, difficult, and enormous creative
propaganda that will end in the world-state, and it is a task in
which I realise I may easily do more harm than good.</p>

<p>I shall begin in the world of English affairs, because there I
best know my way about. Here on the Continent I cannot speak to
people unless they know English well. I have come to speak French,
German, Italian, and Spanish fairly well, which means just not well
enough for any really satisfactory conversation. I can talk to men
like Caillaux and Citroen here in France enough to know they are
upon the same line of thought, but not enough for any
hand-and-glove relationship. In Germany there are the same
difficulties. The next field for me after the English field,
therefore, is the American field. Into that I must carry my
inquiries and tentatives as soon as I have something started in
England. American intellectual life has always been a perplexity to
me. It is not easy to get at, because it has no central
meeting-place, and because it has not as yet developed any such
periodical literature and methods of exchange as are needed for
mental co-operation at a distance. Elementary ideas pass across the
face of America like the sound of a trumpet-blast through a crowd,
but you cannot find out what the exceptional and influential men
are thinking. They do not converse. They have not the habit. Some
talk, but with little give and take.</p>

<p>But I cling to the persuasion that the idea of an economic world
republic and a single world civilisation, as an objective, must be
developing in many more American brains, and developing further,
than over here. That sententious emptiness of outlook, that
resonant vacuity affected by so many American business men in their
talk and speeches, cannot be anything but a mask and a shyness. I
can no more accept the idea that they regard their blessed
Constitution, the bragging nationalism that is taught in their
common schools, the cold-blooded, jealous, and selfish "patriotism"
affected by their press, as more than temporary conditions on the
way to a great destiny, than I can imagine my Lords Birkenhead and
Buckmaster and Beaverbrook dying together romantically on the
stricken field for a rightful king. They know, even more than we
know, that these things are provisional. But what is wanted now is
something more than knowledge and tacit assumptions; it is
recognition, it is admission. The propaganda to which I have to
give myself now is not a propaganda for acceptance but a propaganda
for open acknowledgment.</p>

<p>That is the nature of the work to which, it seems, my energies
must be directed. I have just compared myself with a prophet, but,
after all, that is not quite what I have to be. That is too
grandiose a role. I can be neither the prophet nor the leader nor
the organiser of a world revolution. I observe it advancing and
seek to point it out. It is not the sort of revolution that has
leaders and organisers. My work is to be rather a ferment, a
catalytic agent, a provocation. It is a difficult and subtle task,
vague and perplexing in its responses. Never shall I know what I
have achieved nor what I have failed to achieve. It is a task to
which I am quite unaccustomed and for which I am temperamentally
unfitted. But here it is, at hand; I have, so to speak, thrust it
into my own hand, and I must do it. I must find out how to do it
and train myself where training is needed.</p>

<p>I wish I was not sixty; I wish I had more of Dickon's geniality;
I wish there was an inexhaustible supply of nervous energy between
myself and the phase of irritation. Sixty. Perhaps I have fifteen
years still left, or it may be twenty. Much may be done in such a
ration of time, with a flying start and good fortune. But it leaves
little margin for delays and set-backs. When I began this book, a
year and a half ago, I wrote that life was too short. More and more
do I realise that. It is too short, much too short by the scale of
modern things. I feel to-night that all my sixty years have been no
more than a prelude and that it is now that life and work
begin.</p>

<p>I must go warily in what I have to do. For all I know, I may
find dozens of men presently attempting the same or kindred things.
I have to keep my faith and yet remember that the scheme I propound
is provisional and experimental in frame and detail. I have to be
patient if presently I find men working upon schemes akin to mine
and yet in some respects vexatiously askew to it. I have not been a
patient man in such cases hitherto. Hard it is to do one's utmost
in contentious things and yet keep one's place; to know that
everything is exacted from one and yet that one is nothing, that no
cause is great or worthy of service unless it calls indifferently
on others and depends on no single person.</p>

<p>I have changed greatly since first I came here. My will was very
exhausted then, and now it is renewed. I have rested and rallied
myself, and ahead of me I see years of work and a home. I was a
very homeless creature, an exile from nearly everything in life, in
Paris a year and a half ago. None of this would have happened as it
has done without Clementina. How much do I not owe to
Clementina&mdash;or to the gods of Chance that gave me her!</p>

<p>My thoughts come back to her, to the almost new Clementina, the
ultimately real Clementina, who has been growing upon my
consciousness during the last few weeks. In November last year I
wrote my account of our first meeting in Paris, and it is well I
did it then, for now I do not think I could have recalled the
brightly adventitious Clementina, the amusing Clementina, I have
set down in that passage. The Clementina of the long siege of this
<i>mas</i> is also beginning to fade, the intermittent Clementina
of raids and startling incidents. The new Clementina is near and
warm and larger; she fills more of the landscape and sky. She is
still a lean, long, red-haired, clear-skinned woman, and she has
kept her amber-brown eyes and that sweet oddity of brow and lip and
nostril which betrays gnome blood. Her voice is the accustomed
thread of bright silver in the world's fabric of sounds. But now
she takes possession here and reaches past me into the future, and
my future also is hers.</p>

<p>For her, just as for me, the future means much work and effort
and little easy-going. She will have many disappointments, for it
is her quality to expect vividly; she will often find things
intractable and be tried to the limit of her patience. She will
have to face endless difficulties in her home-making. She has been
so long a nomad, adrift. And often I shall fail her. Just when she
will want me to be patient and comforting, I shall be away in body
or spirit, irritated by the effort of my own affairs, perplexed and
totally absorbed by my perplexities, unwilling to fret a sore
situation in my mind by talking about it even to her, by even
telling her it is there. It has always been my habit when I work to
work to the very limit of my capacity and good temper. We are both
going back to activity, to effort, and strain. Neither of us is
completely and surely sugar-coated. She has not done with tears and
resentments, nor I with fits of anger.</p>

<p>But these will be transitory things for us, the wind on the
heath of life. This love, which she has invented and made and
developed and wrapped about us, will temper and outlast all those
storms. She can turn even her exasperations suddenly in
mid-explosion into acts of beauty.</p>

<p>I come back to the point from which I started to-night. In some
manner I must keep this <i>mas</i> in our lives and have it
available for us. We must be able to come back at times to our
memories of this good interlude and these simplicities. This must
be our retreat from angers and peevishness and the incessancy of
the world's demands.</p>

<p>My little grey room is as still as death, my papers seem to have
fallen asleep in the circle of the lamplight, and outside the night
is very still. It is late. I do not know how late, for my
wrist-watch has stopped.</p>

<p>This may be the last of some two hundred or more of quiet nights
I have spent before my window thinking my world into order. Never
has the scene been quite the same. There is an unexampled
loveliness at this moment, like nothing I have ever observed
before. Everything is silent; there is not a whisper in the fronds
of the palm. There are a few stars in the sky, dots upon a vast
expanse of silky moonshine. All the hillside of Peyloubet is
dreaming; very faint and yet very clear. I can distinguish the pale
houses, the terraces, the patches of trees. The moon I cannot see.
It must be setting over the hill behind this house, and everything
in the foreground is submerged in shadow and intensely,
impenetrably black. The palm tree, the olive trees, the medlar
rooted in the darkness of my terrace, come out against those
luminous phantom slopes in exquisitely sharp silhouettes.</p>

<h2><a id="b6-13" name="b6-13"></a>§ 13. SPRING MORNING AT THE
VILLA JASMIN</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a grave, foreseeing man who wrote at this
table last night and into the small hours of to-day. I read over
what he has written with a sympathy that is already detached. I was
<i>that</i>, ten, eight hours ago? The writing runs on with few
hesitations, most reasonably. This is to be done, then that. There
is a first list of names of people to be interviewed. I like the
idea of the World Republic in hot pursuit of Sir Alfred Mond. And
the treatment of Clementina is&mdash;to put it
mildly&mdash;rational....</p>

<p>That methodical, anxious, planning fellow is, I admit, my better
self. I am still so far identical with him that I can correct some
slips of the pen and alter a sentence or so that has gone askew
from its intention. But I can write nothing more in that vein.</p>

<p>Nor, it seems, in any vein. For an hour now I have not written a
word. I sit at my table, according to the inflexible laws that have
ruled the Villa Jasmin since first we came here, but my mind
wanders away from me. I can think of nothing but Clementina.</p>

<p>What a queer, chance-begotten, whim-borne history ours has been
J At the end, as at the beginning of every individual thing, stands
careless, irresponsible chance, smiling at our rules and foresight
and previsions. The great life of the species has, it may be, some
other law&mdash;I more than half believe it has some other
law&mdash;but this is the quality of its atoms, our individual
lives.</p>

<p>Last night I was on terms with the stars. I was not simply
historical and geographical; I was astronomical. I was immense. I
sat and wrote of the great revolution of mankind, of growing old
and of the grave responsibilities of growing old, and of death.
This morning I am any age or none. I am a man, and presently my
woman is coming down to me, and I have gifts for her and happiness
I can bestow upon her.</p>

<p>I wish she were here with me now, but it is my own will that set
these rules between us. I have kept her waiting a year and a half
and now I am impatient over minutes. I want to tell her all I have
decided upon.</p>

<p>Last night I see that I was not even sure when we would change
things and doubted whether I would take her at once into this
<i>mas</i>. To-day I am consumed with eagerness to see her and
sweep the last cloud from the sunshine of her mind. She will do as
I wish. She shall do as I wish. And now. It would be intolerable to
think that this afternoon we shall not be bringing down her
possessions from the pension to install her here, her dear carpets,
her little typewriter, her chosen books and her pots and bowls, and
that she and I will not be talking together to-night of the united
life that we have now to make for ourselves.</p>

<p>This day is full of sunshine, and only the habits of a year and
the fact that Clementina is late in coming to lunch to-day keep me
within hail of this writing-table. I sit, scribble a little, get up
again. Thrice have I been downstairs and walked to the end of the
<i>terrasse</i> to look up the straight green path down which she
will come.</p>

<p>I know exactly how she will come, chin up, striding with that
dancing step of hers&mdash;she is very light on her feet&mdash;her
short skirts fluttering, her sweet face grave but charged with a
smile&mdash;that suddenly flashes out at the sight of me. It is a
most ungrudging smile. How often has it not delighted me!</p>

<p>I have been downstairs three times, but I do not know how many
times I have looked out of the open window upon the bright array of
the waiting lunch table beside the palm under the Japanese
medlar.</p>

<p>There is a quality of fete about the day; the sunlight is as if
it had been burnished, and the shadows are still with expectation.
Everything is very quiet&mdash;a holiday quiet. Even my cat
motionless upon the parapet might be the soft grey image of a cat.
The flower-beds are blazing with colour. The roses are wonderful,
and I have never seen such iris and such carnations.</p>

<p>I have felt just this pleasant torment of waiting for a dear
event in my childhood at Mowbray, the same restlessness, the same
going to look again and again when my father was coming home.</p>

<p>Something must have delayed her, something unimportant; and
since there are two ways down the hillside and she may come by
either, I must needs stay here now and fiddle with these writing
things until she comes.</p>

<p>I will wait for her in this room. Here we shall certainly be
alone. Down there Jeanne may be hovering interested, and up the
slope there may be some peasants at work ready to observe. The few
words I have to say arc for us alone. That moment must be
particularly ours. Here it is I will say these words, here in this
room which in theory has always been forbidden to her.</p>

<p>I fancy I hear a distant yap, which may be Titza in at
tendance.</p>

<p>This April day is full of life and stir, full of the warmth and
urgency of spring. I am trembling, which is absurd.</p>

<p>Titza's little yelp again. And now I know that she is coming. I
hear her voice quite close now, her clear, sharp voice, that makes
me think of bright cold water. "Titza!" she cries. "Come.
Come."</p>

<p>In a few moments now she will be standing in my door way,
doubtful of her reception. She will look gravely at me for an
instant and then smile softly when she sees I have turned my chair
away from my table. For that means the morning's writing is
over.</p>

<p>There will be a moment of mutual scrutiny, for she will realise
immediately that something has changed, and as for me, I shall be
diffident, I know not why.</p>

<p>"Do I interrupt?" she will ask according to our custom.</p>

<p>And I shall say&mdash;What shall I say?</p>

<h2><a id="epi-1" name="epi-1"></a>§ 1. THE DEATH OF WILLIAM
CLISSOLD</h2>

<p class="first">AND there my brother ceased to write and never
wrote again. None of these expectations were to be realised, none
of these plans were to be carried out. No more work was required of
him, beyond this strange book he had so nearly finished. I cannot
guess what more he may have intended to say. There are not even
notes for any later sections. It is manifest that as he wrote about
her, Miss Campbell, his Clementina, came into the room. He ceased
to write. And never returned again to his writing-table before the
window.</p>

<p>He was killed in an automobile accident upon the narrow road
leading from the gorge of the Loup to Thorenc on April 24th, 1926.
Miss Campbell, who was with him in his car, was killed at the same
time. This was perhaps only a day, or a day or two, after the
unfinished passage was left. He was a skilful, careful driver,
careful as every man with a quick imagination must needs be, but
the chances were against him. The automobile of Dr. Pierre Lot of
Haut Thorenc was drawn up as much off that slender track as
possible in a place where there was room to pass, and the doctor
himself was up at the house of a shepherd which faces the ravine at
this spot. My brother was passing the doctor's car when
suddenly&mdash;so far as we could gather&mdash;one of the
shepherd's children ran out from behind it and stopped dismayed in
mid-road a metre or so from my brother's radiator. No doubt he
clapped on his brakes, but also he swerved so as to miss the
paralysed child. It was a matter of inches, the doctor told me. The
wheel tracks showed that his left wheels went over the turf edge of
the road and that three or four stones loosely embedded in the turf
gave way.</p>

<p>The car turned right over sideways, dropped a sheer score of
yards, crushed its two passengers, rolled over them completely, and
went smashing down for nearly thirty yards more. I have never seen
a car so knocked to pieces. It had left a wheel and its seats and
two mudguards behind it, and the radiator was pierced by a fir
sapling. The doctor was called out to discover what had happened by
the terrified child.</p>

<p>Miss Campbell was quite dead. Her head was dreadfully crushed.
She must have died instantly. My brother was still alive. His back
was broken, and he was mortally injured, but he lived, pointlessly
and irrationally, for some time. The doctor seems to have acted
with excellent sense and decision. He had straw and sacking and a
mattress brought down to him from the shepherd's house, he made my
brother as comfortable as he could on the slope where he lay, he
had morphia available for an injection, and so without excessive
suffering my brother lay in the sunlight for two hours and at last
died. The doctor stayed beside him all that time.</p>

<p>The doctor speaks very passable English, and he was at some
pains to tell me all that happened.</p>

<p>Billy became conscious after a while. His eyes questioned the
doctor. He said: "Une dame?"</p>

<p>The doctor told him not to trouble his mind, but he attempted to
lift his head and look about him. The doctor restrained him.</p>

<p>"Is she badly hurt?" my brother asked, and appeared to have some
difficulty in recalling his French. "Elle est mal blessée." The
doctor with his instinct for documentation had written the exact
words down.</p>

<p>The doctor assured him that she was not suffering. My brother
did not hear that. "Testaments," he muttered. "Non. Non. My will.
Depositions." He fretted. "Hell! what does one <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p>"I realised," said the doctor, "what it was that troubled him.
'Elle est morte,' I said."</p>

<p>"Morte?" He did not recognise the word for a moment, and then
his expression became thoughtful and presently quite tranquil, as
though a vexatious task had been lifted from his mind. "Good," he
said.</p>

<p>Then: "Vraiment? She did not suffer?"</p>

<p>He also said something about "marriage."</p>

<p>The doctor reassured him, speaking slowly and in English.</p>

<p>"Killed instantaneament. Never knew that she was dead. Before
she could feel."</p>

<p>But after these exchanges the anaesthesia of shock wore off and
pain surged up from his injuries. He was dreadfully broken; there
was a possibility of frightful suffering. I thank God for the happy
chance of the doctor and his morphia. He might have had to bear all
that alone or with some peasant staring at him unhelpfully.</p>

<p>Towards the end the pain abated and for a little while his mind
came back to the world again; it returned indistinctly and blindly
through the drug, like some one who returns to his home in a fog
and never quite gets to the door. He talked, but in English and
disconnectedly; the doctor made a phonetic note of all that he
could not understand.</p>

<p>"Il a parlé de Monsieur Dji. Qui est-ce Monsieur Dji?"</p>

<p>For a moment I could not recall.</p>

<p>The doctor consulted his notes. At one time my brother had
seemed to smile. He had said something which the doctor had written
down and could not interpret. "II a dit quelque chose&mdash;
<i>'neeta you Mister Dji.'</i> Un sourire."</p>

<p>I reflected. "Neat of you, Mr. G.!" said I.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said the doctor.</p>

<p>I did not enlighten him. But the reader who has read my
brother's book will be in a better position to guess what was going
on in his fading brain. These were, I believe, his last words. The
mind that came back to say them and smile&mdash;l can almost see
that wry smile of his&mdash;receded into the fog, sank deep into
the darkness, vanished from eyes and lips, and was swallowed up
altogether in the night. That mind had meant, no doubt, to reach
Thorenc and rest there and return to continue this truncated book,
and carry out the' schemes he had developed in it, but it had
swerved just a few inches to the left and got into quite another
direction, <i>sens unique</i>, from which there was no recall. Just
this ineffective backing, this half-return, this smile over the
shoulder, before the decisive parting of the ways.</p>

<p>In that fashion did my brother leave the world.</p>

<p>Doctor Lot and the two or three peasants and their children who
assisted at this scene were presently alone with the twisted and
overturned car and with two stiff, broken bodies covered and quiet
among the flowers and grey stones and turf upon the afternoon
hillside.</p>

<h2><a id="epi-2" name="epi-2"></a>§ 2. TITZA SOLE MOURNER</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was some delay in communicating with me, and
when I reached Provence the remains of my brother and his
Clementina had already been brought back to the Villa Jasmin, and
two graves had been made for them side by side below the wall of
the cemetery of that church of Magagnosc which stands out so boldly
to the right of the Nice Road. I saw no reason for altering these
arrangements. I could not have found a better or more suitable
place. The people of Magagnosc are pleasant people and spoke of
them both in a very kindly fashion. The two of them lie out on that
headland, commanding a wide view of gorge and hill and valley and
sea. The sea appears high and far through a great gap, a broad and
broken and flattened V in the hills. The olive terraces and wooded
crests of Provence, that beautiful, kindly, slovenly land they both
loved so well, spread unheeded before their feet. But old habits of
imagination are strong in us all, and it seems to me that my
brother must still be seeing and thinking up there, still surveying
and planning the future of his world, still conceiving yet further
additions to this book of books he had so spaciously conceived.</p>

<p>I was quite unable to trace any relations of this Miss Campbell.
I have never heard of anyone so completely alone in the world. Her
little "brown muff" of a <i>loulou</i>, Titza, is in quarantine on
its way to a kindly English home. It is a little oldish,
sharp-nosed bitch, and for a time I feared it would be
inconsolable. It wanted to follow its mistress' coffin to the
grave, and then decided that she could not possibly be in that
queer thing and returned to wander about the Villa Jasmin looking
for her and whining. It set off once to find her at her
boarding-house and was nearly run over by an automobile as it
crossed the high-road, so distraught was it. Jeanne, the servant,
who has a great affection for the dog, missed it and followed it
and brought it back. It would touch no food for a day or so, and
then it ate slinkingly and shamefacedly. But it ate and lived.</p>

<p>For a time I thought of leaving it with Jeanne, but Jeanne
herself wants to take another situation; she knows no other way of
living, and it is uncertain whether she will be able to carry a pet
about with her. I did not care to leave the poor little thing to
the chapter of accidents in Provence when I could be sure of
kindness and bones and a not too austerely kept garden for it in
England. So it broods and frets in quarantine on its way, I hope,
to contentment.</p>

<p>The grey Persian cat my brother mentions once or twice, the
philosopher of the mirror, betrayed no corresponding depth of
feeling, and is quite comfortably housed and satisfied with a
widowed lady in Cannes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="epi-3" name="epi-3"></a>§ 3. EDITORIAL, FRATERNAL</h2>

<p class="first">SO it was my brother never completed his
manuscript, and his dream of a vast conspiracy in London and
America and throughout the world, to bring order into the dangerous
chaos of human affairs, remains an unfinished scheme, a suggestion,
a plan waiting to be worked out. I have given it to the reader as
he left it, a thing begun, unproved, a project that is still half
an interrogation.</p>

<p>He has played so large a part in my life, he has done so much to
influence my ideas, that I cannot pretend to be anything but a
partisan in the editorial task which falls naturally to me. I, too,
am one of these discontented monetarily successful men who find
this world unsatisfying. I adhere to his revolution. The show, I
agree, is not good enough. It can and it must be made a better
show. In all sorts of details I may differ from him, but in the
main outlines of his world I am at one with him. If I could have
written this book of his I should have written it much as he has
done. I have secured suitable help and sought to give these
writings as good a text and as advantageous a publication as
possible. I have altered nothing and set nothing aside, although in
one or two places I am moved&mdash;shall I say to demur?&mdash;to
qualify some strokes that. touch me rather nearly.</p>

<p>I do not mean in regard to myself. Occasionally it is manifest
he makes fun of me, and I do not see why he should not make fun of
me. Maybe it is easier to take me seriously if I am made fun of.
There is no malice in what he writes of me, and in places his swift
and fitful affectionateness comes darting through in a way that was
wholly his own. He has, if I may so put it, been dramatising his
economics, and he has seen fit to magnify me a little, magnify me
in several ways and make me a representative of the democratic side
of big business&mdash;the retailing and advertising side, business
over the counter and in the newspaper. For this purpose he has even
exaggerated my size and weight a little&mdash;I was hardly two
inches taller than he, and I doubt if I was ever much more than a
stone heavier, certainly not two&mdash;and, as he admits in one
place, he has trimmed and dressed up my talk. But that, I think, is
quite fairly done. I do not see why I should refuse to become a
type. What I find impossible to leave without a word or so is his
discussion of my wife.</p>

<p>And yet that is a very difficult word or so to write.</p>

<p>I understand the necessity he felt for that discussion. It has
been one of the things in my life to which I can never be
reconciled that my brother and my wife never quite hit it off
together. I do not know what it was between them; I have not the
gift to fathom that sort of misunderstanding. But he did not
understand her, and though she never told me plainly what she
thought of him I know she was always a little uneasy in his
company. Perhaps she felt he criticised her and it made her
self-conscious. And perhaps he felt she criticised him. Here in
this book he discusses her, he <i>puzzles over her</i>.</p>

<p>It was just that puzzling over which made it impossible for him
to be anything but puzzled by her. In life as I have found it, it
is better to live first and think people over afterwards. Affection
can only be invested with big risks. There are no gilt-edged
securities in that world. You must put your heart down and take
your chance. But both he and she, who differed in so many other
things, had this in common that they thought first. He did not take
her for granted so to speak at the beginning as I think one has to
take people for granted from the first if affection, real
affection, is to have fair play. He took me for granted, and he
took our father for granted because we were in his world from the
beginning, but the difficulty he had about other people, and the
reason why he, who was one of the most interesting and attractive
of men, had very few friends and hardly any intimates in the world,
was due to this priority of the critical faculty in his mind that
forbade provisional acceptance. Two people indeed he loved at last
unreservedly, Mrs. Evans and, as I now realise here for the first
time from his manuscript, Miss Campbell, his Clementina, and in
both cases it was because accident and his anger with the injustice
of the world towards them, brought them close to him before he
could institute that preliminary examination of his that was so
hard to pass. Closeness and mutual trust was forced upon him. And
so they got their chance.</p>

<p>It is with no little pain that I analyse his analysis of my
wife. Pain on his account and on hers. What he says of her is so
close to the reality and so far from being true. He too was
troubled and dissatisfied by these impalpables that made an easy
happy triple friendship impossible. Troubled and unable to recover
them. He wanted that triple friendship, I can see, as Minnie wanted
it, as we all wanted it. And then that streak of ruthless criticism
came in between us, the analyst with his pitiless acids. His
merciless intelligence seizes upon the fact that my wife was a
little lacking in physical exuberance, that she was deliberate
rather than quick in her responses, and it makes out a Sort of case
against her as a cold and cynical woman. His intelligence seems to
oblige him to do this in spite of his disposition to think well of
her. He carries her physical quality into his moral estimate of
her. Cynicism is the word he weighs and uses. He tones it by a
flattering adjective or so but it remains cynicism, albeit of the
highest quality, carved ivory cynicism, as he eXplains. It is so
wrong a judgment and yet so close a judgment that it baffles me.
There was nothing at all cynical about my wife. It was the last
word to use about her. Somehow&mdash;for reasons that still defeat
me&mdash;he could not find the way to her gentle, finely sensitive
nature. He saw her delicacies and difficulties as timidity or
evasion or indifference. He did not know what things could hurt
her, and not to know that much about a human being is to know very
little.... I have nothing of his aptitude for the suggestion or
delineation of character or I would correct his story here, I would
tell how beneath the pride and loyalty and honour that he
recognised so plainly, lived such a deep sweetness and tenderness,
a fragility and withal a courage so humanly appealing, that I have
never in truth thought of any other woman as of quite the same
species as my Minnie.</p>

<p>I fully realise that she too was difficult with him. I lament
it. I cannot understand it. If I justify her against my brother, as
equally do I justify him against her unspoken injustice. On both
sides it was injustice. They were my nearest and my dearest human
beings. I can find no fault with either. They were gold; they were
the best of my life. I cannot express what they were to me. And
they were opposed. There are, I think, a great multitude of such
faint ineluctable estrangements between fine people in this world.
Conceivably I am unreasonable. I may be greedy for perfect
harmonies in a world in which there must needs be differences of
key. But the waste through those fine differences!</p>

<p>There I must leave this. I would have given&mdash;I do not know
what I would not have given&mdash;I would have given extravagantly
to have what is told here about Minnie told differently&mdash;told
with a touch of retrospective affection. It need not have been so
very differently. I once showed him a letter of hers&mdash;he tills
of it&mdash;because I thought it was a letter that would make him
understand. After her death. But that too I learn now for the first
time, he found artificial. And it was so tender a letter!</p>

<p>I leave things as he wrote them. I cannot mutilate his book.</p>

<p>His loss is still very fresh with me. It has carried me back to
our boyhood, to our years as stepsons in close alliance against
rather suffocating suppressions, to our hard and strenuous life as
students together. I feel there is little to add. Knowing him so
well it is easy for me to find his personality quite sufficiently
displayed in what he himself has given. I may however say here that
he has a far kindlier disposition than is apparent in his
manuscript, and that there is a tone of irritation in his attitude
to many things in contemporary life that was not a part of his
everyday self.</p>

<p>Always, you must remember, he intensifies. He found a sort of
fun in over-emphasis. He laughed in everyday affairs much more than
this book conveys. Print cannot give his eyes, his intonations.
Here he sweeps in his picture with bold strokes, in his third book
more particularly; he does not trouble to niggle or accommodate his
line. It may be that that was unavoidable. It may be there was no
other way of telling things forcibly. One must state before one can
qualify. He lays bare very great ideas that are coming into men's
minds, that are necessarily antagonistic to established
institutions, he wants to emphasise their contrast and antagonism,
and in doing so his argument takes on a militant quality by the
mere force of its direction; his tone becomes aggressive.</p>

<p>He could be very kind, indeed he was habitually kind to
individuals, but he was impatient with humanity generally, and
particularly so with certain classes and professions that seemed to
him to embody the old order. Politicians, royalties, schoolmasters,
dons, professional soldiers, professional literary men; he can
hardly mention them without a cuff. I do not think he ever once
names the unfortunate Ramsay MacDonald without an opprobrious
epithet. Yet MacDonald is a man of conscious distinction, refined,
high-principled and exceptionally cultivated. And how rough he is
with our poor dear half-brother, Walpole Stent!</p>

<p>There was an evident change in my brother as his book
progressed, due to the increasing reality of this vision he was
evoking of a greater world, close at hand and within our reach. The
more he believed in it&mdash;if I may be paradoxical&mdash;the more
massive it became, the greater was the effort needed to believe,
the greater the nervous stress. His expressed disrespect for
contemporary conditions became more and more resentfuL He was
always a mocker at the vapid assurance of the established thing,
even as a student he was a great mocker, he tells a little of that,
but as his conviction that much that he mocked at was already
superannuated and unnecessary, that here and now it could be
replaced by better things and was not being so replaced, gathered
power in him, his mockery betrayed with ever increasing plainness
the anger surging up beneath. "Don't they mean to move it after
all?" he asked himself. "Is all this still going on?" The effort
for self-control is not always sustained. "Oh! stop this damned
foolery! An end to this life-wasting foolery!" writhes and mutters
beneath many a passage of this book.</p>

<p>His book in this regard does but parallel his life. His
disposition to fly in the face of mass opinion was evident even in
our student days. He recoiled from all crowds and not simply from
"oafish" royalist crowds. With every year he seemed to trouble
himself less about the standards and approval of his community. He
became more and more estranged from the normal man. His disregard
of minor social obligations became conspicuous after the war. He
ignored people, neglected invitations, dropped all irksome
civilities. He no longer kept up with current books and plays and
the interests of the day. He was "leaving the show." If he dressed
and behaved in the usual fashion it was simply to save himself the
bother of being eccentric. He cared too little for everyday usage
in such superficial things even to seem to challenge it.</p>

<p>There was indeed always something isolated about him. From the
beginning he had an exceptional quality. Even as a boy he was
rather alone. He was precocious and he had a marked individuality,
and he went directly for the things that appealed to him. Cricket
bored him as it bores most clever boys, because of the amount of
time it demands if it is to be played well. He rebelled against
that priggishness in games which is so sedulously forced upon
English schoolboys, and on the other hand a laboratory drew him
magnetically. But he was never aloof nor outcast. He could make
himself very agreeable to other boys, and despite the harsh things
he says about their profession his masters not only did not
persecute him but one or two of them took a vivid interest in him.
He did not sulk nor shirk; at times he could be delightfully
facetious. But his inner isolation grew as his life went on out of
his circumstances and with his convictions. Gradually he found out
that he did not like the general tenor of existence, prevalent
ideas, prevalent ways of behaving about things. People seemed to be
wasting their lives in dull and stupid activities, and he felt that
the best of his own possibilities were being wasted in the general
waste. His belief in man's possibilities made him at times inhuman.
He was harsh with our kind because he expected so much from it. His
flight to the simple life of Provence, which he tells of so
appreciatively, his increasing disposition to return thither and
think of the world from that perspective, was only the coming to
the surface of an innate tendency to free himself from immediate
and distracting things.</p>

<p>Yet for all his isolation he was in no sense self-sufficient,
and there I think lies the clue both to the religiosity of his
attitude towards the Being of the Species and to the deeper element
in the love affairs he describes. If he left his ordinary world it
was not because he did not want a world, but because he wanted one
more helpful and akin. Ours in London gave him too little that was
worth having and encumbered him too much. The love affairs he tells
about so frankly betray far more than a temperamental proclivity.
It was as true of him as it can be of anyone that he was born out
of his time. In the more "adult" days of 2026 A.D. he might have
found an easy circle of understanding friends, and lovers after
h"is own heart. He was by no means an unhappy man; he was
temperamentally sanguine; unpleasant things made him combative
rather than miserable; but the progressive detachment of his ideas,
his undervaluation of things still widely accepted, the fear he
seemed always to be fighting down that the crowd with its
gregarious instincts might at last defeat him and his kind and all
his dreams and go its own road to extinction, threw the shadow of a
great loneliness on him, and he would set about exorcising it in
ways which displayed only too plainly his almost unconscious
contempt for established conventions.</p>

<p>His life with the notorious Mrs. Evans, which did for a time
estrange him from us, was more than an unconscious defiance. She
was a banner for him. He would believe no ill of her. He would not
listen to a word against her. He would see no harm in what she had
done. She was his way of damning "all this chastity nonsense," as
he would have called it at that time, and much else besides. He had
acquired already in those days a real prejudice against women who
were socially correct. That submission and acquiescence should
count as possible virtues, roused him to fierce and practical
denials. As hard was it for him to condemn rebellious courage, even
such rebellious courage as that of Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p>There must have been the same element of defiance in the
beginning of the last affair with Clementina Campbell. He does not
admit it but it peeps between the lines. He never told me of her,
but that may have been because the apt occasion never came to us.
We were both busy men, we did not meet very much in 1925, and he
never wrote a letter if he could help it. I did not even know she
existed until I went down to Provence after his death. I am
extremely sorry that I never saw her; that except for a few
snapshots I found of her in a drawer, I do not even know what she
was like. Whatever his state of mind about her at first, whatever
the quality of this earlier relationship, there can be no doubt of
the depth and sincerity of their affection at the end. Mutual
affection I think of a better quality than he had ever had before.
His tenderness for her is manifest every time he mentions her. But
it is not all tenderness towards her. He pulls at his cord. It does
not need close reading between the lines to detect his disposition
to symbolise her as he symbolised Mrs. Evans before her, and turn
her to his own rebellious uses. With her he might have succeeded.
The way the people spoke of her round Magagnosc and Grasse
suggested a very charming person indeed, and it may be that in
these laxer times and married to her, he would have been able to
reinstate her completely in the world that had cast her out. He
loved her very much it is plain, more I should think than he had
ever loved any other woman, but I am sure that the spectacle of the
old order eating its own judgment upon her would have played no
small part in his satisfaction at her happiness.</p>

<p>He was coming back into the world with her and he was coming
back for a last great fight, a completer, more systematic fight
than he had ever essayed before, against most established things.
He was still full of life.</p>

<p>I wish he could have fought that fight. I wish he could have
fought that fight and that I could have been beside him. It is not
natural that he should have gone before me. He has been a great
thing in my world, from those early days of brooding and brilliance
when with a disadvantage of two years he could beat me in my school
work almost as a matter of course. He has refreshed me and
stimulated me all my life; I cannot imagine what I should have
become if it had not been for his corrections. Circumstances threw
us very closely together. Never at any time were we more than half
estranged. And beyond habit and companionship there was something
in him, strong yet weak, defiant yet dependent, free and obstinate
in thought and action and yet cravingly affectionate, that leaves a
heartache for him I must carry now to the end.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing to say, but I do not realise yet that he
is dead. He has been so much in my life since its conscious
beginnings that it is difficult to feel that he has gone right out
of the world, that he is not away in America or Siberia or South
Africa and presently coming back. I had a sense of his possible
comments whenever I wrote. I have that still. If to-morrow I found
a laconic postcard from him among my letters I should not be
surprised. It would be only after a minute or so that I should
begin to perceive it strange.</p>

<p>And it is all over. I think of an eager little chap in
knickerbockers, with bright eyes and a quick colour&mdash;guying
his governess or bolting from me with a squeak between delight and
dismay after some outrageous unexpected attack. I remember him
standing naked in the sunshine on a beach somewhere in France, and
how it dawned upon me that he was beautifully built. I fight again
in a great scrap we had with some French boys at Montpellier. And
there is the keen face of the young socialist, too intent upon his
argument to note the spring flowers in Kensington Gardens, and the
student gone clean over my head out of the common laboratory
through the dark-green door that shut off research from the rank
and file of learners. And so the memories come crowding one after
the other, the better half before the twenties were reached. As it
comes nearer the figure is larger but less bright. I see him in
tennis flannels at Lambs Court, now wary, now wild as a cat in
thundery weather, a most uncertain player always; I see him smiling
recognition at me on the gangway of a big liner or threading his
way to my corner through the groups in the club smoking-room. And
at the end comes the picture, so irrelevant and so dreadful, of
that crumpled automobile I saw amidst torn turf and snapped off
saplings.</p>

<p>My dear brother!</p>

<p><i>Panta rhei</i>. He too has passed. These words, and they are
wonderful words and come like a refrain throughout his book, shall
be put as his sole epitaph upon his grave!</p>
