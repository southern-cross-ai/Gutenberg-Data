<h4>PREFACE.</h4>

<p>The British Colonies now form so prominent a portion of the
Empire, that the Public will be compelled to acknowledge some
interest in their welfare, and the Government to yield some
attention to their wants. It is a necessity which both the
Government and the Public will obey with reluctance.</p>

<p>Too remote for sympathy, too powerless for respect, the
Colonies, during ages of existence, have but rarely occupied a
passing thought in the mind of the Nation; as though their
insignificance entitled them only to neglect. But the weakness of
childhood is passing away: the Infant is fast growing into the
possession and the consciousness of strength, whilst the Parent
is obliged to acknowledge the increasing usefulness of her
offspring.</p>

<p>The long-existing and fundamental errors of Government, under
which the Colonies have hitherto groaned in helpless subjection,
will soon become generally known and understood--and then they
will be remedied.</p>

<p>In the remarks which will be found scattered through this work
on the subject of Colonial Government, it must be observed, that
the system only is assailed, and not individuals. That it is the
system and not <i>The Men</i> who are in fault, is sufficiently
proved by the fact that the most illustrious statesmen and the
brightest talents of the Age, have ever failed to distinguish
themselves by good works, whilst directing the fortunes of the
Colonies. Lord John Russell, Lord Stanley, Mr. Gladstone--all of
them high-minded, scrupulous, and patriotic statesmen--all of
them men of brilliant genius, extensive knowledge, and profound
thought--have all of them been but slightly appreciated as
Colonial rulers.</p>

<p>Their principal success has been in perpetuating a noxious
system. They have all of them conscientiously believed their
first duty to be, in the words of Lord Stanley, to keep the
Colonies dependent upon the Mother Country; and occupied with
this belief, they have legislated for the Mother Country and not
for the Colonies. Vain, selfish, fear-inspired policy! that keeps
the Colonies down in the dust at the feet of the Parent State,
and yet is of no value or advantage to her. To make her Colonies
useful to England, they must be cherished in their infancy, and
carefully encouraged to put forth all the strength of their
secret energies.</p>

<p>It is not whilst held in leading-strings that they can be
useful, or aught but burthensome: rear them kindly to maturity,
and allow them the free exercise of their vast natural strength,
and they would be to the parent country her truest and most
valuable friends.</p>

<p><i>The colonies of the Empire are the only lasting and
inalienable markets for its produce</i>; and the first aim of the
political economist should be to develop to their utmost extent
the vast resources possessed by Great Britain in these her own
peculiar fields of national wealth. But the policy displayed
throughout the history of her Colonial possessions, has ever been
the reverse of this. It was that grasping and ungenerous policy
that called forth a Washington, and cost her an empire. It is
that same miserable and low-born policy that still recoils upon
herself, depriving her of vast increase of wealth and power in
order to keep the chain upon her hapless children, those
ambitious Titans whom she trembles to unbind.</p>

<p>And yet poor Old England considers herself an excellent
parent, and moans and murmurs over the ingratitude of her
troublesome offspring! Like many other parents, she means to do
well and act kindly, but unhappily the principles on which she
proceeds are radically wrong. Hence, on the one side,
heart-burning, irritation, and resentment; on the other,
disappointment, revulsion, and alarm.</p>

<p>Is she too deeply prejudiced, or too old in error, to attempt
a new system of policy?</p>

<p>In what single respect has she ever proved herself a good
parent to any of her Colonies? Whilst supplying them with
Government Officers, she has fettered them with unwholesome laws;
whilst giving them a trifling preference over foreign states in
their commerce, she has laid her grasp upon their soil; whilst
allowing them to legislate in a small degree for themselves, she
has reserved the prerogative of annulling all enactments that
interfere with her own selfish or mistaken views; whilst
permitting their inhabitants to live under a lightened pressure
of taxation, she has debarred them from wealth, rank, honours,
rewards, hopes--all those incentives to action that lead men
forward to glory, and stamp nations with greatness.</p>

<p>What has she done for her Colonies--this careful and
beneficent parent? She has permitted them to exist, but bound
them down in serf-like dependence; and so she keeps them--feeble,
helpless, and hopeless. She grants them the sanction of her flag,
and the privilege of boasting of her baneful protection.</p>

<p>Years--ages have gone by, and her policy has been the same--
darkening the heart and crushing the energies of Man in climes
where Nature sparkles with hope and teems with plenty.</p>

<p>Time, however, too powerful for statesmen, continues his
silent but steady advance in the great work of amelioration. The
condition of the Colonies must be elevated to that of the
counties of England. Absolute rule must cease to prevail in them.
Men must be allowed to win there, as at home, honours and rank.
Time, the grand minister of correction--Time the Avenger, already
has his foot on the threshold of the COLONIAL OFFICE.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 1.</h3>

<h4>COLONISTS.</h4>

<p>The Spirit of Adventure is the most animating impulse in the
human breast. Man naturally detests inaction; he thirsts after
change and novelty, and the prospect of excitement makes him
prefer even danger to continued repose.</p>

<p>The love of adventure! how strongly it urges forward the
Young! The Young, who are ever discontented with the Present, and
sigh for opportunities of action which they know not where to
seek. Old men mourn over the folly and recklessness of the Young,
who, in the fresh and balmy spring-time of life, recoil from the
confinement of the desk or the study, and long for active
occupation, in which all their beating energies may find
employment. Subjection is the consequence of civilized life; and
self-sacrifice is necessary in those who are born to toil, before
they may partake of its enjoyments. But though the Young are
conscious that this is so, they repine not the less; they feel
that the freshness and verdure of life must first die away; that
the promised recompense will probably come too late to the
exhausted frame; that the blessings which would now be received
with prostrate gratitude will cease to be felt as boons; and that
although the wishes and wants of the heart will take new
directions in the progress of years, the consciousness that the
spring-time of life-- that peculiar season of happiness which can
never be known again-- has been consumed in futile desires and
aspirations, in vain hopes and bitter experiences, must ever
remain deepening the gloom of Memory.</p>

<p>Anxious to possess immediate independence, young men, full of
adventurous spirit, proceed in search of new fields of labour,
where they may reap at once the enjoyments of domestic life,
whilst they industriously work out the curse that hangs over the
Sons of Adam.</p>

<p>They who thus become emigrants from the ardent spirit of
adventure, and from a desire to experience a simpler and less
artificial manner of living than that which has become the
essential characteristic of European civilization, form a large
and useful body of colonists. These men, notwithstanding the pity
which will be bestowed upon them by those whose limited
experience of life leads to the belief that happiness or
contentment can only be found in the atmosphere of England, are
entitled to some consideration and respect.</p>

<p>To have dared to deviate from the beaten track which was
before them in the outset of life; to have perceived at so vast a
distance advantages which others, if they had seen, would have
shrunk from aiming at; to have persevered in their resolution,
notwithstanding the expostulations of Age, the regrets of
Friendship, and the sighs of Affection--all this betokens
originality and strength of character.</p>

<p>Does it also betoken indifference to the wishes of others?
Perhaps it does; and it marks one of the broadest and least
amiable features in the character of a colonist.</p>

<p>The next class of emigrants are those who depart from their
native shores with reluctance and tears. Children of misfortune
and sorrow, they would yet remain to weep on the bosom from which
they have drawn no sustenance. But the strong blasts of necessity
drive them from the homes which even Grief has not rendered less
dear. Their future has never yet responded to the voice of Hope,
and now, worn and broken in spirit, imagination paints nothing
cheering in another land. They go solely because they may not
remain--because they know not where else to look for a resting
place; and Necessity, with her iron whip, drives them forth to
some distant colony.</p>

<p>But there is still a third class, the most numerous perhaps of
all, that helps to compose the population of a colony. This is
made up of young men who are the wasterels of the World; who have
never done, and never will do themselves any good, and are a
curse instead of a benefit to others. These are they who think
themselves fine, jovial, spirited fellows, who disdain to work,
and bear themselves as if life were merely a game which ought to
be played out amid coarse laughter and wild riot.</p>

<p>These go to a colony because their relatives will not support
them in idleness at home. They feel no despair at the
circumstance, for their pockets have been refilled, though (they
are assured) for the last time; and they rejoice at the prospect
of spending their capital far from the observation of intrusive
guardians.</p>

<p>Disgusted at authority which has never proved sufficient to
restrain or improve them, they become enamoured with the idea of
absolute license, and are far too high-spirited to entertain any
apprehensions of future poverty. These gallant-minded and truly
enviable fellows betake themselves, on their arrival, to the
zealous cultivation of field-sports instead of field produce.
They leave with disdain the exercise of the useful arts to
low-bred and beggarly-minded people, who have not spirit enough
for anything better; whilst they themselves enthusiastically
strive to realize again those glorious times,--</p>

<p>"When wild in woods the noble savage ran."</p>

<p>In the intervals of relaxation from these fatigues, when they
return to a town life, they endeavour to prove the activity of
their energies and the benevolence of their characters, by
getting up balls and pic-nics, solely to promote the happiness of
the ladies. But notwithstanding this appearance of devotion to
the fair sex, their best affections are never withdrawn from the
companion of their hearts--the brandy flask. They evince their
generous hospitality by hailing every one who passes their door,
with "How are you, old fellow? Come in, and take a nip." Somehow
or other they are always liked, even by those who pity and
despise them.</p>

<p>The women only laugh at their irregularities--they are such
"good-hearted creatures!" And so they go easily and rapidly down
that sloping path which leads to ruin and despair. What is their
end? Many of them literally kill themselves by drinking; and
those who get through the seasoning, which is the fatal period,
are either compelled to become labourers in the fields for any
one who will provide them with food; or else succeed in exciting
the compassion of their friends at home, by their dismal accounts
of the impossibility of earning a livelihood in a ruined and
worthless colony; and having thus obtained money enough to enable
them to return to England, they hasten to throw themselves and
their sorrows into the arms of their sympathizing relatives.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more absurd than to imagine that a fortune may
be made in a colony by those who have neither in them nor about
them any of the elements or qualities by which fortunes are
gained at home.</p>

<p>There are, unfortunately, few sources of wealth peculiar to a
colony. The only advantage which the emigrant may reasonably
calculate upon enjoying, is the diminution of competition. In
England the crowd is so dense that men smother one another.</p>

<p>It is only by opening up the same channels of wealth under
more favourable circumstances, that the emigrant has any right to
calculate upon success. Without a profession, without any
legitimate calling in which his early years have been properly
instructed; without any knowledge or any habits of business, a
man has no better prospect of making a fortune in a colony than
at home. None, however, so circumstanced, entertains this belief;
on the contrary, he enters upon his new career without any
misgivings, and with the courage and enthusiasm of a newly
enlisted recruit.</p>

<p>Alas! the disappointment which so soon and so inevitably
succeeds, brings a crowd of vices and miseries in its train.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2.</h3>

<h4>ST. JAGO.</h4>

<p>The reader may naturally expect to be informed of the reasons
that have induced me thus to seek his acquaintance. In one
word--I am a colonist. In England, a great deal is said every day
about colonies and colonists, but very little is known about
them. A great deal is projected; but whatever is done, is
unfortunately to their prejudice. Secretaries of State know much
more about the distant settlements of Great Britain than the
inhabitants themselves; and, consequently, the latter are seldom
able to appreciate the ordinances which (for their own good) they
are compelled to submit to.</p>

<p>My own experience is chiefly confined to one of the most
insignificant of our colonies,--insignificant in point of
population, but extremely important as to its geographical
position, and its prospects of future greatness,--but the same
principle of government applies to all the British
settlements.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was the victim of medical skill; and being
sentenced to death in my own country by three eminent physicians,
was comparatively happy in having that sentence commuted to
banishment. A wealthy man would have gone to Naples, to Malta, or
to Madeira; but a poor one has no resource save in a colony,
unless he will condescend to live upon others, rather than
support himself by his own exertions.</p>

<p>The climate of Western Australia was recommended; and I may be
grateful for the alternative allowed me.</p>

<p>As I shall have occasion hereafter to allude to them
incidentally, I may mention that my two brothers accompanied me
on this distant voyage.</p>

<p>The elder, a disciple of Aesculapius, was not only anxious to
gratify his fraternal solicitude and his professional tastes by
watching my case, but was desirous of realizing the pleasures of
rural life in Australia.</p>

<p>My younger brother (whose pursuits entitle him to be called
Meliboeus) was a youth not eighteen, originally designed for the
Church, and intended to cut a figure at Oxford; but modestly
conceiving that the figure he was likely to cut would not tend to
the advancement of his worldly interests, and moreover, having no
admiration for Virgil beyond the Bucolics, he fitted himself out
with a Lowland plaid and a set of Pandaean pipes, and solemnly
dedicated himself to the duties of a shepherd.</p>

<p>Thus it was that we were all embarked in the same boat; or
rather, we found ourselves in the month of April, 1841, on board
of a certain ill-appointed barque bound for Western
Australia.</p>

<p>We had with us a couple of servants, four rams with curling
horns-- a purchase from the late Lord Western; a noble
blood-hound, the gift of a noble Lord famous for the breed; a
real old English mastiff-bitch, from the stock at Lyme Park; and
a handsome spaniel cocker. Besides this collection of quadrupeds,
we had a vast assortment of useless lumber, which had cost us
many hundred pounds. Being most darkly ignorant of every thing
relating to the country to which we were going, but having a
notion that it was very much of the same character with that so
long inhabited by Robinson Crusoe, we had prudently provided
ourselves with all the necessaries and even non-necessaries of
life in such a region. Our tool chests would have suited an army
of pioneers; several distinguished ironmongers of the city of
London had cleared their warehouses in our favour of all the
rubbish which had lain on hand during the last quarter of a
century; we had hinges, bolts, screws, door-latches, staples,
nails of all dimensions--from the tenpenny, downwards--and every
other requisite to have completely built a modern village of
reasonable extent. We had tents, Macintosh bags, swimming-belts,
several sets of sauce-pans in graduated scale, (we had here a
distant eye to kangaroo and cockatoo stews,) cleavers, meat-saws,
iron skewers, and a general apparatus of kitchen utensils that
would have satisfied the desires of Monsieur Soyer himself. Then
we had double and single-barrelled guns, rifles, pistols, six
barrels of Pigou and Wilkes' gunpowder; an immense assortment of
shot, and two hundred weight of lead for bullets.</p>

<p>Besides the several articles already enumerated, we had
provided ourselves with eighteen months' provisions, in pork and
flour, calculating that by the time this quantity was consumed,
we should have raised enough to support our establishment out of
the soil by the sweat of our brows. And thus from sheer ignorance
of colonial life, we had laid out a considerable portion of our
capital in the purchase of useless articles, and of things which
might have been procured more cheaply in the colony itself. Nor
were we the only green-horns that have gone out as colonists: on
the contrary, nine-tenths of those who emigrate, do so in perfect
ignorance of the country they are about to visit and the life
they are destined to lead. The fact is, Englishmen, as a body
know nothing and care nothing about colonies. My own was merely
the national ignorance. An Englishman's idea of a colony (he
classes them altogether) is, that it is some miserable place--the
Black-hole of the British empire--where no one would live if he
were allowed a choice; and where the exiled spirits of the nation
are incessantly sighing for a glimpse of the white cliffs of
Albion, and a taste of the old familiar green-and-yellow fog of
the capital of the world. Experience alone can convince him that
there are in other regions of the world climes as delightful,
suns as beneficent, and creditors as confiding, as those of Old
England.</p>

<p>The voyage, of course, was tedious enough; but some portion of
it was spent very pleasantly in calculating the annual profits
which our flocks were likely to produce.</p>

<p>The four noble rams, with their curly horns, grew daily more
valuable in our estimation. By the sailors, no doubt, they were
rated no higher than the miserable tenants of the long-boat, that
formed part of the cuddy provisions. But with us it was very
different. As we looked, every bright and balmy morning, into the
pen which they occupied, we were enabled to picture more vividly
those Arcadian prospects which seemed now brought almost within
reach. In these grave and respectable animals we recognised the
patriarchs of a vast and invaluable progeny; and it was
impossible to help feeling a kind of veneration for the sires of
that fleecy multitude which was to prove the means of justifying
our modest expectations of happiness and wealth.</p>

<p>Our dogs also afforded us the most pleasing subjects for
speculation. With the blood-hound we were to track the footsteps
of the midnight marauder, who should invade the sanctity of our
fold. The spaniel was to aid in procuring a supply of game for
the table; and I bestowed so much pains upon his education during
the voyage, that before we landed he was perfectly au fait in the
article of "down-charge!" and used to flush the cat in the
steward's pantry with the greatest certainty and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Jezebel, the mastiff-birch, was expected to assist in guarding
our castle,--an honourable duty which her courage and fidelity
amply warranted us in confiding to her. Of the former quality, I
shall mention an instance that occurred during the voyage. We had
one day caught a shark, twelve feet long; and no sooner was he
hauled on deck than Jezebel, wild with fury, rushed through the
circle of eager sailors and spectators, and flew directly at the
nose of the struggling monster. It was with difficulty that she
was dragged away by the admiring seamen, who were compelled to
admit that there was a creature on board more reckless and daring
than themselves.</p>

<p>We were now approaching the Cape Verd Islands. I daresay it
has been frequently mentioned, that there is in these latitudes a
vast bed of loose sea-weed, floating about, which has existed
there from time immemorial, and which is only found in this one
spot of the ocean; as though it were here compelled to remain
under the influence of some magic spell. Some navigators are of
opinion that it grows on the rocks at the bottom of the sea,
beneath the surface on which it floats. Others maintain that it
has been drifted across the Atlantic, having issued from the Gulf
of Mexico. Here, however, it is doomed to drift about hopelessly,
for ever lost in the wilderness of waters; on the surface of
which it now vegetates, affording shelter to small crabs, and
many curious kinds of fishes.</p>

<p>One of the latter which we caught, about an inch in length,
had a spike on his back, and four legs, with which he crawled
about the sea-weed.</p>

<p>We approached the Island of St. Jago, sailing unconsciously
close to a sunken rock, on which (as we afterwards learnt) the
"Charlotte" had struck about six weeks before whilst under full
sail, and had gone down in a few minutes, barely allowing time
for the crew to escape in their boat.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding we had been five weeks at sea when we dropped
anchor in Porto Praya roads, the appearance of the land was by no
means inviting to the eyes. A high and extremely barren hill, or
large heap of dry earth, with a good many stones about it, seemed
to compose the Island. Close to us was the town, a collection of
white houses that looked very dazzling in the summer sun. Beside,
and running behind it, was a greenish valley, containing a clump
of cocoa-nut trees. This was the spot we longed to visit; so,
getting into the captain's boat, we approached the shore, where a
number of nearly naked negroes rushing into the sea (there being
no pier or jetty) presented their slimy backs at the gun-wale,
and carried us in triumph to the beach. The town boasted of one
hotel, in the only sitting-room of which we found some Portuguese
officers smoking pipes as dirty as themselves, and drinking a
beverage which had much the appearance of rum and water. There
was no one who could speak a word of English; but at length a
French waiter appeared, who seemed ravished with delight at the
jargon with which we feebly reminded him of his own lively
language "when at home." Having ordered dinner, we wandered off
in search of the coca-nut valley, and purchased bananas for the
first time in our lives, and oranges, the finest in the
world.</p>

<p>Those who have been long at sea know how pleasant it is to
walk once more upon the land. It is one of the brightest of the
Everlasting flowers in the garland of Memory.</p>

<p>We walked along the sea-beach, as people so circumstanced must
ever do, full of gladsome fancies. There was delight for us in
the varied shells at our feet; in the curious skeletons of small
fishes, untimely deceased; in the fantastic forms of the drifted
sea-weed; in the gentle ripple of the companionable waves by our
side. And little Fig, the spaniel, was no less pleased then
ourselves. He ran before us rejoicing in his fleetness; and he
ran back again in a moment to tell us how glad he was. Then as a
wave more incursive than its predecessor unexpectedly wetted his
feet, he would droop his tail and run faster with alarm, until
the sight of some bush or bough, left high and dry by the last
tide, awakened his nervous suspicions, and dreading an ambuscade,
he would stop suddenly and bark at the dreadful object, until we
arrived at his side, when, wagging his tail and looking slyly up
with his joyous eyes, he would scamper away again as though he
would have us believe he had been all the time only in fun.</p>

<p>What profound satisfaction is there in the freedom of land
after so long a confinement! The sunshine that makes joyous every
object around us finds its way into the deeps of the heart.</p>

<p>And now we determined to bathe. So we crossed over a jutting
rock, on the other side of which was a beautiful and secluded
little bay, so sheltered that the waves scarcely rippled as they
came to kiss the shell-covered beach. Here we soon unrobed; and I
was the first to rush at full speed into the inviting waters.
Before I got up to my middle, however, I saw something before me
that looked like a dark rock just below the surface. I made
towards it, intending to get upon it, and dive off on the other
side; but lo! as I approached, it stirred; then it darted like a
flash of lightning towards one side of the bay, whilst I, after
standing motionless for a moment, retreated with the utmost
expedition.</p>

<p>It was a ground-shark, of which there are numbers on that
coast.</p>

<p>We lost no time in putting on our clothes again, and returned
in rather a fluttered state to the inn.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER 3.</h3>

<h4>THE MUTINY.</h4>

<p>We remained a week at St. Jago, the captain being busily
engaged in taking in water, and quarrelling with his crew. One
day, at the instigation of our friend, the French waiter, we made
a trip of seven miles into the interior of the island, to visit a
beautiful valley called Trinidad. Mounted on donkeys, and
attended by two ragged, copper-coloured youths, we proceeded in
gallant style up the main street, and, leaving the town, crossed
the valley beyond it, and emerged into the open country. It was a
rough, stony, and hilly road, through a barren waste, where there
scarcely appeared a stray blade of grass for the goats which
rambled over it in anxious search of herbage.</p>

<p>At length, after a wearisome ride of several hours, we
descended suddenly into the most fertile and luxuriant valley I
ever beheld, and which seemed to extend a distance of some miles.
A mountain brook flowed down the midst, on the banks of which
numerous scattered and picturesque cottages appeared. On either
side the ground was covered with the green carpet of Nature in
the spring of the year. Everywhere, except in this smiling
valley, we saw nothing but the aridity of summer, and the
desolation caused by a scorching tropical sun. But here--how very
different! How sudden, how magical was the change! Every species
of vegetable grew here in finest luxuriance. Melons of every
variety, pine-apples, sweet potatoes, plantains, and bananas,
with their broad and drooping leaves of freshest green and rich
purple flower, and ripe yellow fruit. Orange-trees, cocoa-nut
trees, limes--the fig, the vine, the citron, the pomegranate, and
numerous others, grateful to the weary sight, and bearing
precious stores amid their branches, combined to give the
appearance of wealth and plenty to this happy valley. It was not,
however, destined to be entered by us without a fierce combat for
precedence between two of our steeds. The animal whom it was the
evil lot of Meliboeus to bestride, suddenly threw back its ears,
and darted madly upon the doctor's quadruped, which, on its side,
manifested no reluctance to the fight.</p>

<p>Dreadful was the scene; the furious donkeys nearing and
striking with their fore-feet, and biting each other about the
head and neck without the smallest feeling of compunction or
remorse; the two guides shrieking and swearing in Portuguese at
the donkeys and each other, and striking right and left with
their long staves, perfectly indifferent as to whom they hit; the
unhappy riders, furious with fright and chagrin, shouting in
English to the belligerents of both classes to "keep off!" The
screams of two women, who were carrying water in the
neighbourhood, enhanced by the barking of a terrified cur, that
ran blindly hither and thither with its tail between its legs, in
a state of frantic excitement--altogether produced a tableau of
the most spirited description. Peace was at length restored, and
we all dismounted from our saddles with fully as much
satisfaction as we had experienced when vaulting into them.</p>

<p>There is little more to say about the valley of Trinidad. The
cottagers who supply the town of Porto Praya with fruits and
vegetables are extremely poor, and very uncleanly and untidy in
their houses and habits. We had intended to spend the night with
them, but the appearance of the accommodations determined us to
return to our inn, in spite of the friendly and disinterested
advice of our guides.</p>

<p>St. Jago abounds with soldiers and priests; the former of whom
are chiefly convicts from Lisbon, condemned to serve here in the
ranks.</p>

<p>The day for sailing arrived, and we were all on board and
ready. Our barque was a temperance ship; that is, she belonged to
owners who refused to allow their sailors the old measure of a
wine-glass of rum in the morning, and another in the afternoon,
but liberally substituted an extra pint of water instead.</p>

<p>There is always one thing remarkable about these temperance
ships, that when they arrive in harbour, their crews, excited to
madness by long abstinence from their favourite liquor, and
suffering in consequence all the excruciating torments of thirst,
run into violent excesses the moment they get on shore. St. Jago
is famous for a kind of liquid fire, called aguadente, which is
smuggled on board ship in the shape of pumpkins and watermelons.
These are sold to the sailors for shirts and clothing; there
being nothing so eagerly sought for by the inhabitants of St.
Jago as linen and calico.</p>

<p>Our crew, being thoroughly disgusted with their captain, as
indeed they had some reason to be, and their valour being
wondrously excited by their passionate fondness for water-melons,
came to a stern resolution of spending the remainder of their
lives on this agreeable island; at any rate, they determined to
sail no farther in our company. The captain was ashore, settling
his accounts and receiving his papers; the chief-mate had given
orders to loose the fore-topsail and weigh anchor; and we were
all in the cuddy, quietly sipping our wine, when we heard three
cheers and a violent scuffling on deck. In a few moments down
rushed the mate in a state of delirious excitement, vociferating
that the men were in open mutiny, and calling upon us, in the
name of the Queen, to assist the officers of the ship in bringing
them to order. Starting up at the call of our Sovereign, we
rushed to our cabins in a state of nervous bewilderment, and
loading our pistols in a manner that ensured their not going off,
we valiantly hurried on deck in the rear of the exasperated
officer. On reaching the raised quarter-deck of the vessel, we
found the crew clustered together near the mainmast, armed with
hand-spikes, boat-oars, crow-bars, and a miscellaneous assortment
of other weapons, and listening to an harangue which the
carpenter was in the act of delivering to them. They were all
intoxicated; but the carpenter, a ferocious, determined villain,
was the least so.</p>

<p>At one of the quarter-deck gangways stood the captain's lady,
a lean and wizened Hecate, as famous for her love of rum as any
of the crew, but more openly rejoicing in the no less
objectionable spirit of ultra-methodism. Screaming at the top of
her voice, whilst her unshawled and dusky shoulders, as well as
the soiled ribands of her dirty cap, were gently fanned by the
sea-breeze, she commanded the men to return to their duty, in a
volume of vociferation that seemed perfectly inexhaustible.
Fearing that the quarter-deck would be carried by storm, we
divided our party, consisting of the two mates, three passengers
with their servants, and Mungo the black servant, into two
divisions, each occupying one of the gang-ways.</p>

<p>In a few moments the carpenter ceased his oration; the men
cheered and danced about the deck, brandishing their weapons, and
urging one another to "come on." Then with a rush, or rather a
stagger, they assailed our position, hoping to carry it in an
instant by storm. The mate shouted to us to fire, and pick out
three or four of the most desperate; but perceiving the
intoxicated state of the men we refused to shed blood, except in
the last extremity of self-defence; and determined to maintain
our post, if possible, by means of our pistol-butts, or our fists
alone. In the general melee which ensued, the captain's lady, who
fought in the van, and looked like a lean Helen MacGregor, or the
mythological Ate, was captured by the assailants, and dragged to
the deck below. Then it was that combining our forces, and
inspired with all the ardour which is naturally excited by the
appearance of beauty in distress, we made a desperate sally, and
after a fearful skirmish, succeeded in rescuing the lady, and
replacing her on the quarter-deck, with the loss only of her cap
and gown, and a few handfuls of hair.</p>

<p>After this exploit, both parties seemed inclined to pause and
take breath, and in the interval we made an harangue to the
sailors, expressive of our regret that they should act in so
disgraceful a manner.</p>

<p>The gallant (or rather ungallant) fellows replied that they
were determined to be no longer commanded by a she-captain, as
they called the lady, and therefore would sail no farther in such
company.</p>

<p>I really believe that most of them had no serious intention
whatever in their proceedings, but the officers of the ship were
firmly convinced that the carpenter and one or two others had
resolved to get possession of the vessel, dispose of the
passengers and mates somehow or other, and then slip the cable,
and wreck and sell the ship and cargo on the coast of South
America.</p>

<p>Whilst the truce lasted, the second mate had been busily
engaged making signals of distress, by repeatedly hoisting and
lowering the ensign reversed, from the mizen-peak. This was soon
observed from the deck of a small Portuguese schooner of war,
which lay at anchor about half a mile from us, having arrived a
few hours previously, bringing the Bishop of some-where-or-other
on a visitation to the island. The attention of the officer of
the watch had been previously attracted towards us by the noise
we had made, and the violent scuffle which he had been observing
through his glass. No sooner, therefore, was the flag reversed,
than a boat was lowered from the quarter-davits, filled with
marines, and pulled towards our vessel with the utmost rapidity.
The mutineers, whose attention was directed entirely to the
quarter-deck, did not perceive this manoeuvre, which, however,
was evident enough to us, who exerted ourselves to the utmost to
prolong the parley until our allies should arrive.</p>

<p>The carpenter now decided upon renewing the assault, having
laid aside his handspike and armed himself with an axe; but just
at this moment the man-of-war's boat ran alongside, and several
files of marines, with fixed bayonets, clambering on to the deck,
effected a speedy change in the aspect of affairs. Perceiving at
once how matters stood, the officer in command, without asking a
single question, ordered a charge against the astonished sailors,
who, after a short resistance, and a few violent blows given and
received, were captured and disarmed.</p>

<p>There was a boy among the party called Shiny Bill, some
fifteen years of age, who managed to escape to the fore-shrouds,
and giving the marine who pursued him a violent kick in the face,
succeeded in reaching the fore-top, where he coiled himself up
like a ball. Two or three marines, exasperated by the scuffle,
and by several smart raps on the head which they had received,
hastened up the shrouds after the fugitive, who, however,
ascended to the fore-top-mast cross-trees, whither his enemies,
after some hesitation, pursued. Finding this post also untenable,
he proceeded to swarm up the fore-top-gallant-mast shrouds, and
at last seated himself on the royal yard, where he calmly awaited
the approach of the enemy. These, however, feeling that the
position was too strong to be successfully assailed by marines,
deliberately commenced their retreat, and arrived on deck, whilst
their officer was hailing the immovable Bill in Portuguese, and
swearing he would shoot him unless he instantly descended.</p>

<p>Disdaining, however, to pay the least attention to these
threats, Shiny William continued to occupy his post with the
greatest tranquillity; and the officer, giving up the attempt in
despair, proceeded to inquire from us in Portuguese-French the
history of this outbreak. The scene concluded with the removal of
the mutineers in one of the ship's boats to the man-of-war,
where, in a few moments, several dozen lashes were administered
to every man in detail, and the whole party were then sent on
shore, and committed to a dungeon darker and dirtier than the
worst among them had ever before been acquainted with. But before
all this was done, and when the boats had pulled about a hundred
yards from the vessel, Shiny Bill began to descend from his post.
He slipped down unobserved by any one, and the first notice we
had of his intentions was from perceiving him run across the deck
to the starboard bow, whence he threw himself, without
hesitation, into the sea, and began to swim lustily after his
captive friends. Our shouts--for, remembering the abundance of
sharks, we were very much alarmed for the poor fellow--attracted
the attention of the officer in the boat, to whom we pointed out
the figure of Bill, who seemed as eager now to make a voluntary
surrender, and share the fate of his comrades, as he had
previously been opposed to a violent seizure. The swimmer was
soon picked up, and, to our regret, received in due season the
same number of stripes as fell to the lot of his friends captured
in battle.</p>

<p>The prisoners remained several days in their dungeon, where
they were hospitably regaled with bread and water by the
Portuguese Government; and at the end of this period (so unworthy
did they prove of the handsome treatment they received) the
British spirit was humbled within them, and they entreated with
tears to be allowed to return to their duty. The mates, however,
refused to sail in the same vessel with the carpenter, and it was
accordingly settled that he should remain in custody until the
arrival of a British man-of-war, and then be returned to his
country, passage free.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 4.</h3>

<h4>THE PRISON-ISLAND.</h4>

<p>It was nearly the end of August when we approached the
conclusion of our voyage. The wind was fair, the sun shone
brightly, and every heart was gay with the hope of once more
being upon land. We drew nigh to the Island of Rottnest, about
sixteen miles from the mouth of the river Swan, and anchored to
the north of it, waiting for a pilot from Fremantle.</p>

<p>And there we had the first view of our future home. Beyond
that low line of sand-hills, which stretched away north and
south, far as the eye could reach, we were to begin life again,
and earn for ourselves a fortune and an honourable name. No
friendly voice would welcome us on landing, but numberless
sharpers, eager to prey upon the inexperienced Griffin, and take
advantage of his unavoidable ignorance and confiding innocence.
There was nothing very cheering in the prospect; but supported by
the confidence and ambition of youth, we experienced no feelings
of dismay.</p>

<p>In order to wile away the time, we landed on the island, and,
passing through a thick wood of cypresses, came to a goodly-sized
and comfortable-looking dwelling-house, with numerous
out-buildings about it, all built of marine lime-stone.</p>

<p>As the particulars which I then learned respecting this island
were afterwards confirmed by experience and more extended
information, I may as well enter upon its history at once.</p>

<p>The gentleman who was then Governor of Western Australia, was
Mr. John Hutt, a man of enlightened mind, firm, sagacious, and
benevolent. From the first, he adopted an admirable policy with
regard to the native inhabitants.</p>

<p>Exhibiting on all occasions a friendly interest in their
welfare, he yet maintained a strict authority over them, which
they soon learned to respect and fear. The Aborigines were easily
brought to feel that their surest protection lay in the
Government; that every act of violence committed upon them by
individual settlers was sure to be avenged by the whites
themselves; and that, as certainly, any aggression on the part of
the natives would call down the utmost severity of punishment
upon the offenders. By this firm administration of equal justice
the Aboriginal population, instead of being, as formerly, a
hostile, treacherous, and troublesome race, had become harmless,
docile, and in some degree useful to the settlers.</p>

<p>But it was not the policy of Mr. Hutt merely to punish the
natives for offences committed against the whites; he was anxious
to substitute the milder spirit of the British law in lieu of
their own barbarous code; and to make them feel, in process of
time, that it was for their own interest to appeal for protection
on all occasions to the dominant power of Government, rather than
trust to their own courage and spears. This was no easy task, and
could only be accomplished by firmness, discrimination, and
patience; but in the course of a few years, considerable progress
had been made in subduing the prejudices and the barbarous
customs of the Aborigines. Although it had been declared by Royal
Proclamation that the native inhabitants were in every respect
subjects of the British throne, and as such entitled to equal
privileges with ourselves, and to be judged on all occasions by
the common and statute laws, it proved to be no easy matter to
carry into practice these views of the Home Government. People in
England, who derive their knowledge of savages from the orations
delivered at Exeter Hall, are apt to conceive that nothing more
is requisite than to ensure them protection from imaginary
oppression, and a regular supply of spiritual comforts. They do
not consider that whilst they insist upon these unfortunate
creatures being treated exactly as British subjects, they are
placing a yoke on their own necks too heavy for them to bear in
their present condition. Primitive and simple laws are necessary
to a primitive state of society; and the cumbrous machinery of
civilized life is entirely unsuited to those who in their daily
habits and their intellectual endowments are little superior to
the beasts that perish. By declaring the savages to be in every
respect British subjects, it becomes illegal to treat them
otherwise than such. If a settler surprise a native in the act of
stealing a pound of flour, he of course delivers him over to a
constable, by whom he is conveyed before the nearest magistrate.
Now this magistrate, who is an old settler, and well acquainted
with the habits of the natives, is also a man of humanity; and if
he were allowed to exercise a judicious discretion, would order
the culprit to be well flogged and dismissed to his expectant
family. But thanks to Her Majesty's well-meaning Secretaries of
State for the Colonies, who have all successively judged alike on
this point, it is declared most unadvisable to allow a local
magistrate the smallest modicum of discretion. He has only one
course to pursue, and that is, to commit the offender for trial
at the next Quarter Sessions, to be held in the capital of the
colony. Accordingly the poor native, who would rather have been
flayed alive than sent into confinement for two months previous
to trial, whilst his wives are left to their own resources, is
heavily ironed, lest he should escape, and marched down some
sixty or seventy miles to Fremantle gaol, where the denizen of
the forest has to endure those horrors of confinement which only
the untamed and hitherto unfettered savage can possibly know.</p>

<p>Among savages, the 'Lex talionis'--the law of retaliation--is
the law of nature and of right; to abstain from avenging the
death of a relative would be considered, by the tribe of the
deceased, an act of unpardonable neglect. Their own customs,
which are to them as laws, point out the mode of vengeance. The
nearest relative of the deceased must spear his slayer. Nothing
is more common among these people than to steal one another's
wives; and this propensity affords a prolific source of
bloodshed.</p>

<p>They have also a general law, which is never deviated from,
and which requires that whenever a member of a tribe dies,
whether from violence or otherwise, a life must be taken from
some other tribe. This practice may have originated in a desire
to preserve the balance of power; or from a belief, which is very
general among them, that a man never dies a natural death. If he
die of some disorder, and not of a spear-wound, they say he is
"quibble gidgied," or speared by some person a long distance off.
The native doctor, or wise man of the tribe, frequently pretends
to know who has caused the death of the deceased; and the
supposed murderer is of course pursued and murdered in turn. This
custom necessarily induces a constant state of warfare. Now it is
very right that all these barbarous and unchristian practices
should be put an end to; but, whilst endeavouring to suppress
them, we ought to remember that they are part and parcel of the
long-established laws of this rude people, and that it is not
possible all at once to make them forego their ancient
institutions and customs. The settlers would gladly see punished
all acts of violence committed among the natives in their
neighbourhood. Were they permitted to inflict such punishments as
are best suited to the limited ideas and moral thraldom of the
Aborigines, these, without cruelty or injustice, might gradually
be brought within the pale of civilization; but when the law
declares it to be inevitable that every British subject who is
tried and found guilty of having speared his enemy shall be
hanged without benefit of clergy, the colonists out of sheer
humanity and pity for the ignorance of the culprit, refrain from
bringing him to trial and punishment--a proceeding which, by the
way, would cost the colony some fifteen or twenty pounds--and
thus he goes on in his errors, unreproved by the wisdom or the
piety of the whites. Sometimes, however, it happens that the
officers who exercise the calling of Protectors of the
Aborigines, anxious to prove that their post is no sinecure, make
a point of hunting up an occasional law-breaker, who, being
brought to trial, is usually found guilty upon his own
evidence--the unfortunate culprit, conscious of no guilt in
having followed the customs of his ancestors, generally making a
candid statement of his offence. The sentence decreed by the
English law is then passed upon him, and he would, of course, be
duly subjected to the penalty which justice is supposed to
demand, did not the compassionate Governor, in the exercise of
the highest privilege of the Crown, think proper to step in and
commute the sentence to perpetual imprisonment. As it would have
entailed a serious expense upon the colony to have had to
maintain these prisoners in a gaol in the capital, his Excellency
determined to establish a penal settlement at Rottnest; and this
he accordingly accomplished, with very good effect.</p>

<p>At the time we visited the island, there were about twenty
native prisoners in charge of a superintendent and a few
soldiers.</p>

<p>The prisoners were employed in cultivating a sufficient
quantity of ground to produce their own food. It was they also
who had built the superintendent's residence; and whenever there
was nothing else to do, they were exercised in carrying stone to
the top of a high hill, on which a lighthouse was proposed to be
built.</p>

<p>The Governor has certainly shown very good judgment in the
formation of this penal establishment. It is the dread of the
natives throughout the colony; and those prisoners who are
released inspire among their fellows the greatest horror and
dismay by their tales of the hardships they have suffered. No
punishment can be more dreadful to these savages--the most
indolent race in the world--than being compelled to work; and as
their idleness brings them occasionally in contact with the
superintendent's lash, their recollections and accounts of
Rottnest are of the most fearful description. Certain, however,
it is, that nothing has tended so much to keep the Aborigines in
good order as the establishment of this place of punishment. It
is maintained at very little expense to the colony, as the
prisoners grow their own vegetables, and might easily be made to
produce flour enough for their own consumption.</p>

<p>It was a clear, beautiful, sparkling day, and there was a
sense of enjoyment attached to the green foliage, the waving
crops, and the gently heaving sea, that threw over this new world
of ours a charm which filled our hearts with gladness.</p>

<p>Having returned to our ship, we saw the pilot-boat rapidly
approaching. As it came alongside, and we were hailed by the
steersman, we felt a sensation of wonder at hearing ourselves
addressed in English and by Englishmen, so far, so very far from
the shores of England. With this feeling, too, was mingled
something like pity; we could not help looking upon these poor
boatmen, in their neat costume of blue woollen shirts, canvass
trousers, and straw hats, as fellow-countrymen who had been long
exiled from their native land, and who must now regard us with
eyes of interest and affection, as having only recently left its
shores.</p>

<p>No sooner was the pilot on board than the anchor was weighed,
the sails were set, and we began to beat up into the anchorage
off Fremantle. Night closed upon us ere we reached the spot
proposed, and we passed the interval in walking the deck and
noting the stars come forth upon their watch. The only signs of
life and of human habitation were in the few twinkling lights of
the town of Fremantle: all beside, on the whole length of the
coast, seemed to be a desert of sand, the back-ground of which
was occupied with the dark outline of an illimitable forest.</p>

<p>It was into this vast solitude that we were destined to
penetrate. It was a picture full of sombre beauty, and it filled
us with solemn thoughts.</p>

<p>The next morning we were up at daybreak. Certainly it was a
beautiful sight, to watch the sun rise without a cloud from out
of the depths of that dark forest, rapidly dispersing the cold
gray gloom, and giving life, as it seemed, to the sparkling
waves, which just before had been unconsciously heaved by some
internal power, and suffered to fall back helplessly into their
graves.</p>

<p>How differently now they looked, dancing joyously forward
towards the shore! And the sun, that seems to bring happiness to
inanimate things, brought hope and confidence back to the hearts
of those who watched him rise.</p>

<p>Flights of sea-birds of the cormorant tribe, but generally
known as Shags, were directing their course landward from the
rocky islands on which they had roosted during the night. What
long files they form! --the solitary leader winging his rapid and
undeviating way just above the level of the waves, whilst his
followers, keeping their regular distances, blindly pursue the
course he takes. See! he enters the mouth of the river; some
distant object to his practised eye betokens danger, and though
still maintaining his onward course, he inclines upwards into the
air, and the whole line, as though actuated by the same impulse,
follow his flight. And now they descend again within a few feet
of the river's surface, and now are lost behind projecting rocks.
All day long they fish in the retired bays and sheltered nooks of
the river, happy in the midst of plenty.</p>

<p>The river Swan issues forth into the sea over a bar of rocks,
affording only a dangerous passage for boats, or vessels drawing
from four to five feet water. Upon the left bank of the river is
the town of Fremantle. The most prominent object from the sea is
a circular building of white limestone, placed on the summit of a
black rock at the mouth of the Swan. This building is the
gaol.</p>

<p>On the other side of the roadstead, about ten or twelve miles
distant from the main, is a chain of islands, of which Rottnest
is the most northern. Then come some large rocks, called the
Stragglers, leaving a passage out from the roadstead by the south
of Rottnest; after these is Carnac, an island abounding with
rabbits and mutton-birds; and still farther south is Garden
island.</p>

<p>Fremantle, the principal port of the colony, is unfortunately
situated, as vessels of any burthen are obliged to anchor at a
considerable distance from the shore. Lower down the coast is a
fine harbour, called Mangles Bay, containing a splendid
anchorage, and it is much to be lamented that this was not
originally fixed upon as the site for the capital of the
colony.</p>

<p>The first impression which the visitor to this settlement
receives is not favourable. The whole country between Fremantle
and Perth, a distance of ten miles, is composed of granitic sand,
with which is mixed a small proportion of vegetable mould. This
unfavourable description of soil is covered with a coarse scrub,
and an immense forest of banksia trees, red gums, and several
varieties of the eucalyptus. The banksia is a paltry tree, about
the size of an apple-tree in an English or French orchard,
perfectly useless as timber, but affording an inexhaustible
supply of firewood. Besides the trees I have mentioned, there is
the xanthorea, or grass-tree, a plant which cannot be
intelligibly described to those who have never seen it. The stem
consists of a tough pithy substance, round which the leaves are
formed. These, long and tapering like the rush, are four-sided,
and extremely brittle; the base from which they shoot is broad
and flat, about the size of a thumb-nail, and very resinous in
substance. As the leaves decay annually, others are put forth
above the bases of the old ones, which are thus pressed down by
the new shoots, and a fresh circle is added every year to the
growing plant. Thousands of acres are covered with this singular
vegetable production; and the traveller at his night bivouac is
always sure of a glorious fire from the resinous stem of the
grass-tree, and a comfortable bed from its leaves.</p>

<p>We landed in a little bay on the southern bank of the river.
The houses appeared to be generally two-storied, and were built
of hard marine limestone. Notwithstanding the sandy character of
the soil, the gardens produced vegetables of every variety, and
no part of the world could boast of finer potatoes or cabbages.
Anxious to begin the primitive life of a settler as speedily as
possible, we consulted a merchant to whom we had brought letters
of introduction as to the best mode of proceeding. He advised us
to fix our head-quarters for a time near to Fremantle, and thence
traverse the colony until we should decide upon a permanent place
of abode. In the meantime we dined and slept at Francisco's
Hotel, where we were served with French dishes in first-rate
style, and drank good luck to ourselves in excellent claret.</p>

<p>In the early days of the colony, Sir James Stirling, the first
Governor, had fixed upon Fremantle as the seat of government; and
the settlers had begun to build themselves country-houses and
elegant villa residences upon the banks of the river. These,
however, were not completed before it was determined to fix the
capital at Perth, some dozen miles up the river, where the soil
was rather better, and where a communication with the proposed
farms in the interior would be more readily kept up.</p>

<p>The government officers had now to abandon their half-built
stone villas, and construct new habitations of wood, as there was
no stone to be found in the neighbourhood of Perth, and brick
clay had not then been discovered.</p>

<p>It was in one of these abandoned houses (called the
Cantonment), situate on the banks of the Swan, about half a mile
from Fremantle, that, by the advice of our friend, we resolved to
take up our quarters. The building was enclosed on three sides by
a rough stone wall, and by a wooden fence, forming a paddock of
about three quarters of an acre in extent. It comprised one large
room, of some forty feet by eighteen, which had a roof of thatch
in tolerable repair. The north side, protected by a verandah, had
a door and two windows, in which a few panes of glass remained,
and looked upon the broad river, from which it was separated by a
bank of some twenty feet in descent, covered with a variety of
shrubs, just then bursting into flower. A few scattered red-gum
trees, of the size of a well-grown ash, gave a park-like
appearance to our paddock, of which we immediately felt extremely
proud, and had no doubt of being very comfortable in our new
domain. Besides the large room I have mentioned, there were two
others at the back of it, which, unfortunately, were in rather a
dilapidated condition; and below these apartments (which were
built on the slope of a hill) were two more, which we immediately
allotted to the dogs and sheep. This side of the building was
enclosed by a wall, which formed a small court-yard. Here was an
oven, which only wanted a little repair to be made ready for
immediate use.</p>

<p>For several days we were occupied in superintending the
landing of our stores, and housing them in a building which we
rented in the town at no trifling sum per week. A light dog-cart,
which I had brought out, being unpacked, proved extremely useful
in conveying to our intended residence such articles as we were
likely to be in immediate want of.</p>

<p>The two men had already taken up their abode there, together
with the rams and dogs; and at last, leaving our comfortable
quarters at the hotel with something like regret and a feeling of
doubt and bewilderment, we all three marched in state, with our
double-barrels on our shoulders, to take possession of our rural
habitation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 5.</h3>

<h4>FIRST ADVENTURES.</h4>

<p>We had providently dined before we took possession; and now,
at sunset, we stood on the bank before our house, looking down
upon the placid river. The blood-hound was chained to one of the
posts of the verandah; Jezebel, the noble mastiff-bitch, lay
basking before the door, perfectly contented with her situation
and prospects; and little Fig was busily hunting among the
shrubs, and barking at the small birds which he disturbed as they
were preparing to roost.</p>

<p>One of the men was sitting on an upturned box beside the fire,
waiting for the gently-humming kettle to boil; whilst the other
was chipping wood outside the house, and from time to time
carrying the logs into the room, and piling them upon the hearth.
As we looked around we felt that we had now indeed commenced a
new life. For some months, at any rate, we were to do without
those comforts and luxuries which Englishmen at home, of every
rank above the entirely destitute, deem so essential to bodily
ease and happiness.</p>

<p>We were to sleep on the floor, to cook our own victuals, and
make our own beds. This was to be our mode of acquiring a
settlement in this land of promise. Still there was an air of
independence about it, and we felt a confidence in our own
energies and resources that made the novelty of our position
rather agreeable than otherwise.</p>

<p>There was something exhilarating in the fresh sea-breeze;
there was something very pleasing in the gay appearance of the
shrubs that surrounded us--in the broad expanse of the river,
with its occasional sail, and its numerous birds passing rapidly
over it on their way to the islands where they roosted, or
soaring leisurely to and fro, with constant eyes piercing its
depths, and then suddenly darting downwards like streams of light
into the flood, and emerging instantly afterwards with their
finny prey. The opposite bank of the river displayed a sandy
country covered with dark scrub; and beyond this was the sea,
with a view of Rottnest and the Straggler rocks. A few white
cottages relieved the sombre and death-like appearance of that
opposite shore. Unpromising as was the aspect of the country, it
yet afforded sufficient verdure to support in good condition a
large herd of cattle, which supplied Fremantle with milk and
food.</p>

<p>Here, then, the reader may behold us for the first time in our
character of settlers. He may behold three individuals in light
shooting coats and cloth caps, standing upon the bank before
their picturesque and half-ruinous house, their dogs at their
side, and their gaze fixed upon the river that rolled beneath
them. The same thoughts probably occupied them all: they were now
left in a land which looked much like a desert, with Heaven for
their aid, and no other resources than a small capital, and their
own energies and truth. The great game of life was now to begin
in earnest, and the question was, how it should be played with
success? Individual activity and exertion were absolutely
necessary to ensure good fortune; and warmly impressed with the
consciousness of this, we turned with one impulse in search of
employment.</p>

<p>Aesculapius began to prepare their supper for the dogs, and
Meliboeus looked after his sheep, which were grazing in the
paddock in front of the dwelling. As for myself, with the ardent
mind of a young settler, I seized upon the axe, and began to chop
firewood--an exercise, by the way, which I almost immediately
renounced.</p>

<p>And now for supper!</p>

<p>Our most necessary articles were buried somewhere beneath the
heaps of rubbish with which we had filled the store-room at
Fremantle. Our plates, cups and saucers, etc., were in a crate
which was not to be unpacked until we had removed our property
and abode to the inland station which we designed for our
permanent residence. There were, however, at hand for present use
eight or nine pewter plates, and a goodly sized pannikin a-piece.
In one corner of the room was a bag of flour, in another a bag of
sugar, in a third a barrel of pork, and on the table, composed of
a plank upon two empty casks, were a couple of loaves which Simon
had purchased in the town, and a large tea-pot which he had
fortunately discovered in the same cask with the pannikins.</p>

<p>The kettle fizzed upon the fire, impatient to be poured out;
the company began to draw round the hospitable board, seating
themselves upon their bedding, or upon empty packing-cases; and,
in a word, tea time had arrived. Hannibal, as we called the
younger of our attendants, from his valiant disposition, had
filled one of the pewter plates with brown sugar from the bag;
the doctor made the tea, and we wanted nothing but spoons to make
our equipage complete. However, every man had his pocket-knife,
and so we fell to work.</p>

<p>Butter being at that time half-a-crown a pound, Simon (our
head man) had prudently refrained from buying any; and as he had
forgotten to boil a piece of the salt pork, we had to sup upon
dry bread, which we did without repining, determined, however, to
manage better on the morrow.</p>

<p>In the meantime we were nearly driven desperate by most
violent attacks upon our legs, committed by myriads of fleas.
They were so plentiful that we could see them crawling upon the
floor; the dogs almost howled with anguish, and the most sedate
among us could not refrain from bitter and deep execrations. We
had none of us ever before experienced such torment; and really
feared that in the course of the night we should be eaten up
entirely. These creatures are hatched in the sand, and during the
rains of winter they take refuge in empty houses; but they infest
every place throughout the country, during all seasons, more or
less, and are only kept down by constant sweeping from becoming a
most tremendous and overwhelming plague, before which every
created being, not indigenous to the soil, would soon disappear,
or be reduced to a bundle of polished bones. The natives
themselves never sleep twice under the same wigwam.</p>

<p>After tea, the sheep and dogs being carefully disposed of for
the night, we turned out before the house, and comforted
ourselves with cigars; and having whiled away as much time as
possible, we spread out our mattresses on the floor, and in a
state of desperation attempted to find rest. We escaped with our
lives, and were thankful in the morning for so much mercy
vouchsafed to us, but we could not conscientiously return thanks
for a night's refreshing rest.</p>

<p>At the first dawn of day we rolled up our beds, lighted the
fire, swept out the room, let the dogs loose, and drove the rams
to pasture on the margin of the river. After breakfast, which was
but a sorry meal, we determined to make our first attempt at
baking. Simon, a man of dauntless resolution, undertook the task,
using a piece of stale bread as leaven. It was a serious
business, and we all helped or looked on; but the result,
notwithstanding the multitude of councillors, was a lamentable
failure. Better success, fortunately, attended the labours of
Hannibal, who boiled a piece of salt pork with the greatest
skill.</p>

<p>Mutton at this period, 1841, was selling at sixteen-pence per
pound (it is now two-pence), and we therefore resolved to depend
upon our guns for fresh meat. We had brought with us a
fishing-net, which we determined to put in requisition the
following day.</p>

<p>The most prominent idea in the imagination of a settler on his
first arrival at an Australian colony, is on the subject of the
natives. Whilst in England he was, like the rest of his
generous-minded countrymen, sensibly alive to the wrongs of these
unhappy beings-- wrongs which, originating in a great measure in
the eloquence of Exeter Hall, have awakened the sympathies of a
humane and unselfish people throughout the length and breadth of
the kingdom. Full of these noble and ennobling sentiments, the
emigrant approaches the scene of British-colonial cruelty; but no
sooner does he land, than a considerable change takes place in
his feelings. He begins to think that he is about to place his
valuable person and property in the very midst of a nation of
savages, who are entirely unrestrained by any moral or human
laws, or any religious scruples, from taking the most
disagreeable liberties with these precious things.</p>

<p>The refined and amiable philanthropist gradually sinks into
the coarse-minded and selfish settler, who is determined to
protect himself, his family, and effects, by every means in his
power--even at the risk of outraging the amiable feelings of his
brother philanthropists at home. In Western Australia, the
natives generally are in very good order; they behave peaceably
towards the settlers, eat their flour, and in return occasionally
herd or hunt up their cattle, and keep their larders supplied
with kangaroo.</p>

<p>It is very rarely--I have never indeed heard of a single
well-authenticated instance--that any amount of benefits, or the
most unvarying kindness, can awaken the smallest spark of
gratitude in the breasts of these degraded savages. Those who
derive their chief support from the flour and broken meat daily
bestowed upon them by the farm settlers, would send a spear
through their benefactors with as little remorse as through the
breast of a stranger. The fear of punishment alone has any
influence over them; and although in this colony they are never
treated with anything like cruelty or oppression, it is
absolutely necessary to personal safety to maintain a firm and
prompt authority over them.</p>

<p>When we first arrived, we were philanthropists, in the usual
sense of that term, and thought a good deal about the moral and
general destitution of this unfortunate people; but when we first
encountered on the road a party of coffee-coloured savages, with
spears in their hands, and loose kangaroo-skin cloaks (their only
garments) on their shoulders, accompanied by their women
similarly clad, and each carrying in a bag at her back her
black-haired offspring, with a face as filthy as its mother's--we
by no means felt inclined to step forward and embrace them as
brethren.</p>

<p>I question, indeed, whether the most ardent philanthropist in
the world would not have hesitated before he even held forth his
hand to creatures whose heads and countenances were darkened over
with a compound of grease and red clay, whose persons had never
been submitted to ablution from the hour of their birth, and
whose approach was always heralded by a perfume that would
stagger the most enthusiastic lover of his species.</p>

<p>But it was not merely disgust that kept us at arm's length. We
must confess we were somewhat appalled at this first view of
savage life, as we looked upon the sharp-pointed spears, wild
eyes, and well-polished teeth of our new acquaintance. Although,
in truth, they were perfectly harmless in their intentions, we
could not help feeling a little nervous as they drew nigh, and
saluted us with shrill cries and exclamations, and childish
bursts of wild laughter. Their principal question was, whether we
were "cabra-man?" or seamen, as we afterwards discovered their
meaning to be. After a good deal of screaming and laughing, they
passed on their way, leaving us much relieved by their absence.
They seemed to be, and experience has proved to us that they are,
the most light-hearted, careless, and happy people in the world.
Subsisting upon the wild roots of the earth, opossums, lizards,
snakes, kangaroos, or anything else that is eatable which happens
to fall in their way, they obtain an easy livelihood, and never
trouble themselves with thoughts of the morrow. They build a new
house for themselves every evening; that is, each family, erects
a slight shelter of sticks covered over with bark, or the tops of
the xanthorea, that just keeps off the wind; and with a small
fire at their feet, the master of the family, his wife, or wives,
and children, lie huddled together like a cluster of snakes--
happier than the tenants of downy beds. Far happier, certainly,
than we had lately been in ours. We had, however, devised a new
plan for the next night. Having each of us a hammock, we
suspended them from the rafters; and thus, after the first
difficulty and danger of getting into bed was overcome, we lay
beyond the reach of our formidable enemies, and contrived to
sleep soundly and comfortably.</p>

<p>The next morning we breakfasted early. My brothers resolved to
try the effect of the fishing-net, and I myself arranged a
shooting excursion with a lad, whose parents rented a house
situated about a quarter of a mile from our own. We were to go to
some lakes a few miles distant, which abounded with wild ducks
and other water-fowl. Preceded by Fig, and more soberly
accompanied by Jezebel, we set out upon our expedition.</p>

<p>It was the close of the Australian winter, and the temperature
was that of a bright, clear day in England at the end of
September. The air was mild, but elastic and dry; the peppermint
and wattle-trees were gay with white and yellow blossoms; an
infinite variety of flowering shrubs gave to the country the
appearance of English grounds about a goodly mansion; whilst the
earth was carpeted with the liveliest flowers. It was impossible
to help being in good spirits.</p>

<p>We passed up a valley of white gum-trees, which somewhat
resemble the ash, but are of a much lighter hue. They belong to
the eucalyptus species.</p>

<p>I shot several beautiful parroquets, the plumage of which was
chiefly green; the heads were black, and some of the pinion
feathers yellow. The country presented very little appearance of
grass, though abounding with green scrub; and frequently we
passed over denuded hills of limestone-rock, from which we beheld
the sea on one side, and on the other the vast forest of banksias
and eucalypti, that overspreads the entire country. The river
winding among this mass of foliage, relieved the eye.</p>

<p>After a walk of two hours we approached the lakes of which we
were in search. situated in a flat country, and their margins
covered with tall sedges, it was difficult to obtain a view of
the water. Now, then, we prepared for action. Behind those tall
sedges was probably a brood of water-fowl, either sleeping in the
heat of the day, or carefully feeding in the full security of
desert solitude. "Fig! you villain! what are you about? are you
going to rush into the water, and ruin me by your senseless
conduct? I have got you now, and here you must please to remain
quiet. No, you rascal! you need not look up to me with such a
beseeching countenance, whilst you tremble with impatience, eager
to have a share in the sport. You must wait till you hear my gun.
I am now shooting for my dinner, and perhaps for yours also, if
you will condescend to eat duck, and I dare not allow you the
pleasure of putting up the game. You understand all this well
enough, and therefore please to be silent;--or, observe! I'll
murder you."</p>

<p>Leaving the boy with the dogs, I began to steal towards the
lake, when I heard his muttered exclamation, and turning round,
saw him crouching to the earth and pointing to the sky. Imitating
his caution, I looked in the direction he pointed out, and beheld
three large birds leisurely making towards the spot we occupied.
They were larger than geese, black, with white wings, and sailed
heavily along, whilst I lay breathlessly awaiting their approach.
The dogs were held down by the boy, and we all seemed equally to
feel the awfulness of the moment. The birds came slowly towards
us, and then slanted away to the right; and then wheeling round
and round, they alighted upon the lake.</p>

<p>Creeping to the sedges, I pushed cautiously through, up to the
ankles in mud and water. How those provoking reeds, three feet
higher than my head, rustled as I gently put them aside! And now
I could see plainly across a lake of several acres in extent.
There on the opposite side, were three black swans sailing about,
and occasionally burying their long necks in the still waters.
With gaze riveted upon that exciting spectacle, I over-looked a
myriad of ducks that were reposing within a few yards of me, and
which, having discovered the lurking danger, began to rise en
masse from the lake.</p>

<p>Never before had I seen such a multitude. Struck with
amazement, I stood idly gaping as they rose before me; and after
sweeping round the lake, with a few quacks of alarm, whirled over
the trees and disappeared.</p>

<p>The swans seemed for a moment to catch the general
apprehension, and one of them actually rose out of the water, but
after skimming along the surface for a few yards, he sank down
again, and his companions swam to rejoin him. Gently retreating,
I got back upon the dry land, and motioning the boy to remain
quiet, hastened round the lake to its opposite bank. More
cautiously than before I entered the grove of sedges, and soon
beheld two of the swans busily fishing at some distance from the
shore. What had become of the third? There he is, close to the
border of the lake, and only about fifty yards from my position!
My first shot at a swan!--Now then--present! fire!-- bang! What a
splutter! The shots pepper the water around him. He tries to
rise, He cannot! his wing is broken! Hurrah! hurrah! "Here
Jonathan! Toby! what's your name? here! bring the dogs--I've hit
him--I've done for him!</p>

<p>"Fig, Fig!--O! here you are; good little dog--good little
fellow! now then, in with you! there he is!"</p>

<p>With a cry of delight, little Fig dashed through the reeds.
The water rushed down his open throat and half-choked him; but he
did not care. Shaking the water out of his nose as he swam, he
whimpered with pleasure, and hurried after the swan which was now
slowly making towards the middle of the lake. Its companions had
left it to its fate. We stood in the water watching the chase.
Jezebel, excited out of all propriety, though she could see
nothing of what was going on, gallopped up and down the bank,
with her tail stiff out, tumbling over the broken boughs which
lay there, and uttering every now and then deep barks that awoke
the astonished echoes of the woods. Sometimes she would make a
plunge into the water, splashing us all over, and then she
quickly scrambled out again, her ardour considerably cooled.</p>

<p>"Well done, Fig! good little dog! at him again! never mind
that rap on the head from his wing."</p>

<p>Away swam the swan, and Fig after him, incessantly
barking.</p>

<p>Had not the noble bird been grievously wounded he would have
defied the utmost exertions of the little spaniel, but as it was,
he could only get for a moment out of the reach of his pursuer by
a violent effort, which only left him more exhausted. And now
they approached the shore; and the swan, hard pressed, turns
round and aims a blow with its bill at the dog.</p>

<p>This Fig managed to elude, and in return made a snap at his
enemy's wing, and obtained a mouthful of feathers; but in revenge
he received on his nose a rap from the strong pinion of the bird
that made him turn tail and fairly yelp with anguish. "Never
mind, brave Fig! good dog! at him again! Bravo--bravo! good
little fellow!" There he is, once more upon him. And now, master
Fig, taught a lesson by the smart blows he had received,
endeavours to assail only the wounded wing of the swan. It was a
very fierce combat, but the swan would probably have had the best
of it had not loss of blood rendered him faint and weak.</p>

<p>He still fought bravely, but now whenever he missed his
adversary, his bill would remain a moment in the water, as though
he had scarcely strength to raise his head; and as he grew
momentarily weaker and weaker, so Fig waxed more daring and
energetic in his assaults; until at length he fairly seized his
exhausted foe by the neck, and notwithstanding his struggles, and
the violent flapping of his long unwounded wing, began to draw
him towards the shore. We hurried to meet and help him. Jezebel
was the first that dashed breast-high into the water; and seizing
a pinion in her strong jaws, she soon drew both the swan and Fig,
who would have died rather than let go, through the yielding
sedges to the land.</p>

<p>The swan was soon dead; and Fig lay panting on the sand, with
his moth open, and looking up to his master as he wagged his
tail, clearly implying, "Did not I do it well, master?" "Yes, my
little dog, you did it nobly. And now you shall have some of this
bread, of Simon's own baking, which I cannot eat myself; and
Jonathan and I will finish this flask of brandy and water."</p>

<p>And now we set out on our return home, anxious to display our
trophy to envious eyes.</p>

<p>As we approached the Cantonment, I discharged my unloaded
barrel at a bird like a thrush in appearance, called a
Wattle-bird, from having two little wattles which project from
either side of its head.</p>

<p>The salute was answered by a similar discharge from the
Cantonment, and soon afterwards Meliboeus came running to meet
us, preceded by the blood-hound at full gallop. The dogs greeted
one another with much apparent satisfaction. Little Fig was
evidently anxious to inform his big friend of all that he had
done, but Nero was much too dignified and important to attend to
him, and bestowed all his notice upon Jezebel.</p>

<p>The fishermen had succeeded in catching a dozen mullet, which
were all ready for cooking; and the frying-pan being soon put in
requisition, we were speedily placed at table.</p>

<p>Being still without legitimate knives and forks, the absence
of the latter article was supplied by small forked-sticks, cut
from a neighbouring peppermint tree. Those who did not like cold
water alone were allowed grog; and the entertainment, consisting
of fish and boiled pork (which a few months before we should have
considered an utter abomination), being seasoned with hunger,
went off with tolerable satisfaction.</p>

<p>The following day we had the swan skinned and roasted, but it
certainly was not nearly so good as a Michaelmas goose.
Nevertheless, it was a change from boiled pork, and we
endeavoured to think it a luxury. Simon had been more successful
in his latter efforts at baking, and, on the whole, things
assumed a more comfortable aspect.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 6.</h3>

<h4>PERTH--COLONIAL JURIES.</h4>

<p>So soon as we were well settled in our new abode, we began to
think of pushing our researches a little farther into the
country. We thought it high time that we visited the capital, and
paid our respects to the Governor. About a mile and a half from
our location, the Fremantle and Perth road crosses the river
(which is there about four hundred yards wide) by a ferry.
John-of-the-Ferry, the lessee of the tolls, the Charon of the
passage, is a Pole by birth, who escaped with difficulty out of
the hands of the Russians; and having the fortune to find an
English master, after a series of adventures entered into the
employment of an emigrant, and settled in Western Australia. He
had now become not only the lessee of the ferry, but a dealer in
various small articles, and at the time to which I refer, was the
owner of several Timor ponies. Singular enough for a horse-dealer
and a colonist, John had the reputation of being an honest man,
and his customers always treated him with the utmost
confidence.</p>

<p>Having learnt his good character, we repaired to his neat,
white-washed cottage on the banks of the river to inspect his
stud; and soon effected a purchase of two of his ponies. These
animals, about thirteen hands high, proved to belong to the
swiftest and hardiest race of ponies in the world. They required
no care or grooming; blessed with excellent appetites, they
picked up their food wherever they could find any, and came night
and morning to the door to receive their rations of barley,
oat-meal, bread-crusts, or any thing that could be spared them.
The colony had been supplied with several cargoes of these ponies
from Timor, and they proved extremely useful so long as there was
a scarcity of horses; but afterwards they became a nuisance, and
tended greatly to keep back improvements in the breed of horses.
Pony-stallions suffered to roam at large, became at length such
an evil, that special acts of Council were passed against them;
and as these did not prove of sufficient efficacy, the animals
were sometimes hunted like wild cattle, and shot with rifles.</p>

<p>It was some amusement to us to break in our small quadrupeds
to draw my light cart; we had brought out tandem-harness; and in
a short time we got up a very fair team. But, alas! there was no
pleasure in driving in that neighbourhood--the road being only a
track of deep sand. One bright and tempting morning the doctor
and myself mounted our steeds, and leaving our affairs at the
castle in the faithful charge of Meliboeus, wended our way
towards the capital of the colony. The river at the ferry has a
picturesque appearance, precipitous rocks forming its sides, and
two bays, a mile apart, terminating the view on either hand,
where the river winds round projecting head-lands.</p>

<p>The old road to Perth was truly a miserable one, being at
least six inches deep in sand the whole way. It was scarcely
possible to see more than fifty yards ahead of you, so thickly
grew the banksia trees. After crossing the ferry, we lost sight
of the river for several miles, and then diverged from the dismal
road by a path which we had been directed by the ferryman to look
out for, and which brought us to a sandy beach at the bottom of a
beautiful bay, called Freshwater Bay. From this point to the
opposite side was a stretch of several miles, and the broad and
winding river, or rather estuary, with its forest banks,
presented a beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>We now ascended from the shore to the high land above. The
forest through which we passed resembled a wild English park;
below was the broad expanse of Melville water, enlivened by the
white sails of several boats on their way from Perth to
Fremantle. Farther on, the mouth of the Canning River opened upon
us; and now we could see, deep below the high and dark hill-side
on which we travelled, the narrow entrance from Melville water
into Perth water. At length we obtained a full view of the
picturesquely situated town of Perth.</p>

<p>It stands on the right bank of a broad and crescent-shaped
reach of the river Swan, in an extremely well-chosen locality.
The streets are broad; and those houses which are placed nearest
to the river, possess, perhaps, the most luxuriant gardens in the
world. Every kind of fruit known in the finest climates is here
produced in perfection. Grapes and figs are in profuse abundance;
melons and peaches are no less plentiful, and bananas and
plantains seem to rejoice in the climate as their own.</p>

<p>The town has a never-failing supply of fresh water from a
chain of swamps at the back, and the wells fed by them are never
dry. Many of the houses are well built--brick having long since
superseded the original structure of wood--and possess all the
usual comforts of English residences.</p>

<p>In the principal street, most of the houses stand alone, each
proprietor having a garden, or paddock of three quarters of an
acre in extent, about his dwelling. The great misfortune of the
town is, that the upper portion of it is built upon sand, which
is many feet deep. The streets, not being yet paved, are all but
impassable; but happily, each possesses a good foot-path of clay,
and it is to be hoped that the cart-ways will ere long be
similarly improved. Sydney was originally in the state that Perth
presents now; but there the natural unfavourableness of the soil
has been entirely overcome. Increasing wealth and population will
ere long do as much for us.</p>

<p>It is not until we reach Guildford, eight miles farther inland
than Perth, that the stratum of sand ceases, and a cold and marly
clay succeeds, which reaches to the foot of the Darling range of
hills, and extends many miles down the coast.</p>

<p>The banks of the Swan River, as well as of the Canning and
most other rivers of the colony, contain many miles of rich
alluvial soil, capable of growing wheat sufficient for the
support of a large population. Many of these flats have produced
crops of wheat for sixteen years successively, without the aid of
any kind of manure. It must, however, be owned, that a very
slovenly system of farming has been generally pursued throughout
the colony; and, in fact, is commonly observable in all colonies.
The settlers are not only apt to rely too much upon the natural
productiveness of the soil, but they are in general men whose
attention has only lately been turned to agriculture, and who are
almost entirely ignorant of practical farming in its most
important details. The Agricultural Society of Western Australia
has for some years exerted itself to improve this state of
things, and has in some measure succeeded.</p>

<p>It must be observed that with the exception of the rich flats
of the Swan and Canning rivers, the vast extent of country
between the coast and the Darling Hills is a miserable region,
scarcely more valuable for the purposes of cultivation than the
deserts of Africa, except where occasional swamps appear like
oases, and tempt the hardy settler to found a location. As all
the worst land of the colony lies unfortunately near the coast,
those who visit only the port and capital usually leave the
country with a very unfavourable and a very erroneous impression
of its real character.</p>

<p>It is not until the granite range of the Darling Hills is
passed over, that the principal pastoral and agricultural
districts are found. There are the farm settlements, the flocks,
and herds of the colony. From the Victoria plains north of
Toodyay, for hundreds of miles to the southward, comprising the
fertile districts of Northam, York, Beverley, the Dale and the
Hotham, is found a surface of stiff soil, covered over with
straggling herbage, and many varieties of trees and shrubs. But I
am travelling too fast: I must pause for the present at
Perth.</p>

<p>Circumstances determined me to take up my residence there,
instead of accompanying the rest of my party into the interior,
as I had originally intended. I liked the appearance and
situation of the town; and I liked the people generally. And here
I may state, with many kindly feelings, that never was a more
united or cordial society than that of the town of Perth, with
its civil and military officers, and its handful of merchants. No
political or religious differences have hitherto disturbed its
harmony; nor have there yet been introduced many of those
distinctions which may be necessary and unavoidable in large
communities, but which, though generally to be met with in all
societies, are not only lamentable but highly ridiculous in small
out-of-the-way colonies. Such divisions, however, must be
apprehended even here in progress of time, and the period will
come when we shall look back with regret to those days when we
were all friends and associates together, and when each
sympathized with the fortunes of his neighbour. The kindly
feeling which thus held society together, was ever manifested at
the death of one of its members. Then not only the immediate
connexions of the deceased attended his funeral, but every member
of his circle, and many also of the lower classes. It has more
than once happened that a young man has fallen a victim to his
rashness and nautical inexperience, and met with an untimely fate
whilst sailing on Melville water. I myself twice narrowly escaped
such a calamity, as perhaps I may hereafter narrate. Every boat
belonging to the place is immediately engaged in search of the
body, and many of the boatmen freely sacrifice their time and
day's wages in the pursuit. And when at length the object of that
melancholy search is discovered, and the day of the funeral has
arrived, the friends, companions, neighbours, and fellow-townsmen
of the deceased assemble at the door of his late residence, to
pay the last testimonies of sympathy and regret for him who has,
in that distant colony, no nearer relative to weep at his grave.
It is a long procession that follows the corpse to its home,
passing with solemn pace through the else deserted streets, and
emerging into the wild forest which seems almost to engulph the
town; and then pursuing the silent and solitary path for a mile
until, on the summit of a hill, surrounded by dark ever-green
foliage, appears the lonesome burial-ground. Ah! how little
thought the tenant of that insensible body, late so full of life
and vigour, that here he should so soon be laid, far from the
tombs of his family, far from the home of his parents, to which
his thoughts had so constantly recurred! I do not think any one
ever witnessed the interment in that solitary place of one whom
perhaps he knew but slightly when living, without feeling in
himself a sensation of loneliness, as though a cold gust from the
open grave had blown over him. It is then we think most of
England and home--and of those who though living are dead to
us.</p>

<p>But these are only transient emotions; they are idle and
unavailing, so away with them!</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to give an account of my first appearance
before a colonial public. Some of the crew of our vessel,
exasperated by the conduct of the captain, who refused to allow
them any liberty on shore after their long voyage, and encouraged
and even led on by the chief mate, had broken into the
store-room, and consumed a quantity of spirits and other stores.
Now as we had been most shabbily treated by the miserly and
ruffian captain, and as the stores thus stolen had been paid for
by the passengers, and withheld from them upon the voyage
(stolen, in fact, by the captain himself), we were delighted with
the robbery, and extremely sorry to hear that the chief mate had
been committed to prison for trial as the principal offender. In
fact, the captain thought proper to wink at the conduct of the
others, as he could not afford to part with any more of his crew.
The General Quarter Sessions drew nigh, and the day before they
commenced I received a kind of petition from the prisoner,
entreating me to aid him at this pinch, as he had not a friend in
that part of the world, and would inevitably be ruined for what
he considered rather a meritorious action--taking vengeance on
the stinginess of the captain. Though I did not see exactly of
what benefit I could be to him, I repaired to the court-house on
the day of trial. It was crowded with people, as such places
always are when prisoners are to be tried; and as I had met at
dinner most of the magistrates on the Bench, I did not much like
the idea of making my first public appearance before them as a
friend of the gentleman in the dock, who had improperly
appropriated the goods of his employer.</p>

<p>The amiable desire, however, of paying off old scores due to
the captain, annihilated every other feeling; and when the
prisoner, on being asked whether he was guilty or not guilty of
the felony laid to his charge, instead of answering, cast his
imploring eyes upon me, as though I knew more of the business
than himself, I could not refrain from advancing towards the
table occupied by the counsel and solicitors, and asking
permission of the bench to give my valuable assistance to the
prisoner. This being graciously accorded, the mate, with a most
doleful countenance, and a very unassured voice, made answer to
the plain interrogative of the Clerk of Arraigns-- "Not guilty,
my Lord."</p>

<p>Whilst the prosecutor was being examined by the Advocate
General, I conned over the indictment with a meditative
countenance, but without being able to see my way in the least.
The captain, scowling atrociously at me and my persecuted friend,
gave his evidence with the bitterest animosity. He proved his
losses, and the facts of the store-room door having been broken
open, and the prisoner and most of the sailors being found drunk
by him on his repairing one evening to the vessel. It now became
my turn to ask questions, as</p>

<p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your ship, Captain W., is commonly called
a Temperance ship, is it not?</p>

<p>Captain (after a ferocious stare). I should think you knew
that.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. And being a temperance ship, you do not allow the
men, at any time, any other liquor than water?</p>

<p>Captain. No.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. In temperance ships, I suppose it sometimes
happens that the men contrive to buy liquor for themselves?</p>

<p>Captain (looking like a bull about to charge a matadore).
Boo!</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Do you remember the day we were off Madeira?</p>

<p>Captain stares and snorts.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Do you remember on that day several of the sailors
being remarkably light-headed--reeling about the deck?</p>

<p>Captain (roaring, and striking the table with his hand).
Yes!</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Was this the effect of a 'coup de soleil', do you
think?</p>

<p>Captain. No!</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Very well. Do you remember, whilst we were on the
Line, the second-mate being in your cabin helping Mrs. W. to stow
away some things in the lazarette, and both being found
afterwards extremely unwell, and obliged to be taken to bed?</p>

<p>Chairman (interfering). I think the witness need not answer
that question.</p>

<p>Advocate General. I should have made the same objection, Sir,
but-- (aside) I was laughing too much.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Very well, Sir. I will not press it if it be
disagreeable. Do you remember at St. Jago the whole of the crew
being every day notoriously drunk--from eating water-melons?</p>

<p>Captain (recovering from an apoplectic fit). Ah-h!</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Do you remember, when off the Cape, the sail-maker
and several others being unable to do their duty, and being
pronounced by the doctor to be in a state of liquor?</p>

<p>Captain. Yes.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Then, as it appears that on board of a temperance
ship, men do occasionally (and in your vessel very often) get
drunk, might not the prisoner at the time of his alleged offence
have been drinking other liquor than that which formed part of
your stores?</p>

<p>Chairman (the Captain being too full of rage to articulate).
The jury will be able to draw their own inference as to that.</p>

<p>Captain. It was he, gentlemen; it was this--gentleman
(forsooth-- ha! ha!) who gave the men money on landing in order
to make them drunk.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Thank you for that evidence. The intelligent
gentlemen in the box will perceive that it was at my expense that
the unfortunate prisoner got drunk, and not at the captain's.</p>

<p>The prosecutor was now permitted to retire, which he did
growling like a bear, amid the jeers of the populace, who always
sympathize with misfortune when it appears impersonated in the
dock.</p>

<p>The jury were also evidently in high glee, and cast most
friendly looks at the prisoner, and the 'fidus Achates' who stood
up for him so stoutly.</p>

<p>The next witness was the sail-maker, who reluctantly owned
himself to have aided the prisoner in drinking some brandy which
had come from the ship's stores.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. But, Sails, you do not mean to say that the
prisoner told you he had himself taken it from the ship's
stores?</p>

<p>Witness. Oh no, Sir, certainly not.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. In fact, of your own knowledge, you do not know
where the liquor came from?</p>

<p>Witness. No, Sir; oh, no, Sir!</p>

<p>Here the Advocate-General administered such a lecture to the
witness, who was considerably more than half-drunk at the time,
that he entirely lost his wits and memory, and answered so
completely at random, that the jury begged he might not be asked
any more questions.</p>

<p>Advocate General. It is of no importance. I shall call no more
witnesses, as I hold in my hand the prisoner's own confession,
made before the committing magistrate, who was yourself, Mr.
Chairman.</p>

<p>This was a knock-down blow to me, and made the jury look
extremely blank. They gazed on one another in despair. The
document was duly proved, and the case for the prosecution
closed. The chairman asked if I wished to address the jury, but I
declined, and observed that the prisoner must explain for himself
what he meant by this extraordinary confession. Every thing
seemed dead against the prisoner, who hung his head and looked
remarkably simple. I read over the paper, which stated that he,
the prisoner, with several others, on a certain day took a
quantity of the captain's brandy, and got drunk thereupon.</p>

<p>A ray of hope beamed upon me. I started up, and the jury
instinctively began to brighten; they had given up the prisoner
as lost, and now they were ready to catch at a straw. I addressed
the unfortunate "You state here, that you took the captain's
brandy with certain of the sailors. Do you mean by that, you
'partook' of the brandy which other sailors were drinking?"</p>

<p>Prisoner (balbutiant). I--I--ye--ye--</p>

<p>P. Counsel. What do you really mean, Sir, by this written
document? Do you mean to say that you yourself took this brandy,
or that you partook of it with others?</p>

<p>Prisoner. Yes, Sir,--that I partook of it.</p>

<p>P. Counsel. Then, gentlemen of the jury, this document does
not convict the unfortunate man at the bar; and what appears like
an admission of guilt is only to be attributed to his imperfect
mode of expressing himself. He admits that he partook of certain
brandy stated to be the captain's, which the captain, himself,
however, would lead you to suppose had been provided by me. The
witness who has been examined throws no further light upon the
matter; and though the prisoner himself has admitted that he
partook of liquor which he believed belonged to the captain, that
admission does not convict him under the present indictment,
which charges him with having "feloniously taken and carried
away," etc.</p>

<p>The jury were evidently delighted with this construction; and
the people in the gallery and body of the court could scarcely be
restrained from giving three cheers.</p>

<p>The chairman recapitulated the evidence, and left the matter
in the hands of the jury, who jostled one another out of the box,
and retired to "consider their verdict." As they passed through
the ante-room to the apartment in which they usually held their
solemn deliberations, they caught up a bucket of water which the
bailiff of the court generally kept at hand for thirsty counsel
or magistrates; and as soon as they had decently secluded
themselves, and indulged in a genial fit of merriment, the
foreman produced a bottle of brandy from his pocket, and seizing
the pannikin which floated in the bucket, poured forth a good
libation, and drank "towards all present." Each juryman in turn
then drank the health of the foreman. After that, they all drank
the prisoner's health; and as one of the number afterwards
assured me, they would have conscientiously toasted the
prisoner's counsel, but the liquor unfortunately failed.</p>

<p>The foreman then said, "Come, my lads, there's no more left,
so we may as well go back again." So they jostled one another out
of the room, and with composed countenances returned to the
court, where they were ostentatiously conducted to their box by
the sheriff's officer amid loud cries of "Silence in the court!
silence there!"</p>

<p>Their names having been called over, the Clerk of Arraigns
asked the usual question, "Have you considered your verdict,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" interrupted the foreman, as if he feared lest
the prisoner should be convicted in spite of the jury.</p>

<p>"How say you," continued the clerk, "is the prisoner at the
bar guilty or not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" cried the whole jury to a man; and amid thunders
of acclamations the prisoner was released from the dock, and
turned out of court, where he was seized upon by a multitude of
sympathizers, and carried in triumph to the next public-house.
There he spent the ensuing four-and-twenty hours, the hero of the
day.</p>

<p>In this slight sketch I am conscious that I have only been
able to convey to the reader a very faint idea of A COLONIAL
JURY.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 7.</h3>

<h4>BOATING UP THE RIVER.</h4>

<p>Whilst I was making acquaintances at Perth, my brothers,
mounted on our Timor steeds, were making a tour of inspection
beyond the Darling Hills. They fixed at length upon a farm at
York, with about three thousand acres belonging to it, and having
a good farm-house, with excellent barn and out-buildings
attached. This evinced a more comfortable and luxurious state of
things than they had anticipated, and they returned in high
spirits to head-quarters.</p>

<p>It now became necessary to consider how the various goods and
utensils were to be conveyed to the new settlement, which was
seventy miles distant from Fremantle. We sold most of our flour
and pork at a fair profit, and left by far the greater part of
the other articles which we had brought out with us to be sold by
a commission agent, as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>From various causes, but chiefly from our own ignorance in
selecting our goods in London, we lost a considerable sum upon
the things we had brought out. Emigrants, unless they are men of
great experience, should bring all their capital to a colony in
bills or specie, and not attempt to increase their property by
speculating in goods. On their arrival, they will most probably
find the markets already glutted, and they will be compelled
either to sell at a sacrifice, or leave their effects in the
hands of an agent, who will charge enormously for warehouse-rent
and other expenses, and will take especial care that the
unfortunate emigrant is not the party who profits most by the
sale of his goods.</p>

<p>We had brought out with us an old artillery waggon; and all
hands now set to work to put it together, which was accomplished
after a good deal of difficulty. We also purchased three pair of
bullocks, which were at that date very dear. One
pair--magnificent animals certainly--cost fifty guineas, and the
other animals twenty pounds a-piece. Now, however, the best
working bullocks may be obtained for about fifteen pounds a pair.
As the road so far as Guildford was excessively heavy, we
resolved to convey most of our goods by water to a spot a few
miles beyond that town, where a friendly settler had placed at
our disposal a wooden building, consisting of a single room,
situated on the banks of the river, and used occasionally by
himself as a store-house for his own goods on their transit to
his dwelling. The same friend lent us his own whale-boat; and by
determining to convey our effects ourselves we avoided a very
heavy expense. The cost of conveying necessaries from the coast
to the farm settlements in the interior, has been one of the
chief drawbacks to the colony. The boatmen made fortunes, whilst
the farmers were nearly ruined by their charges, and those of the
storekeepers in the towns.</p>

<p>For fifteen years, at least, the latter have grumbled with
violent indignation unless their goods have realised from two to
five hundred per cent profit. Resolved, therefore, to be our own
boatmen, we moored our vessel at a little wooden jetty below our
house, and began to pack up such articles as were designed to
compose the first cargo.</p>

<p>I remember well the pleasure with which we stood upon that
wooden jetty one summer's evening, looking upon the boat in which
we were to perform our first voyage up the river, as she lightly
floated before us, scarcely giving a strain upon the rope which
held her to one of the posts at the end of the pier. Fig and
Jezebel, always intimate friends, were hunting for
bandicoots--animals less than a kangaroo-rat--which abounded in
the bank below our dwelling.</p>

<p>Upon this bank, Hannibal was to be seen cleaning the tandem
harness, suspended from the bough of a tree, and occasionally
casting an eye in the direction of the sheep, for whose safety he
was responsible. By the river side, our bullocks were busily
engaged picking the scanty herbage. The sea-breeze blowing
steadily up the river cooled the air, and seemed to bear health
and spirits on its wings.</p>

<p>The only sound that met the ear was a rushing noise, which
every now and then rose from the water along the shore. It was
caused by myriads of little fish rushing into shoal water to
escape from some pressing foe.</p>

<p>There are some minds that draw pleasure from things which in
no degree affect others; to such, this was one of those seasons
of tranquil happiness that leave no regrets behind. The
consciousness of independence--the pleasant nature of our
duties--the cheerful aspect of all around--the flattering
whispers of Hope, though false as usual--all helped to form for
the mental eye a picture which it loved to look upon.</p>

<p>And now we were busied in loading our boat. What pride we
felt! no shame at being seen performing manual labour; but pride,
and pleasure, and exultation. We had always been fond of boating,
and now that it was about to be an useful employment, it seemed
additionally agreeable. And what a noble scene for this our first
adventurous voyage, upon that broad river or rather arm of the
sea! We had found out the secret of human happiness, long hidden
from us --business had become our pleasure. I was to be the
captain, and my youngest brother and Simon composed the crew.</p>

<p>The boat was not loaded until late in the afternoon, and our
departure was therefore postponed until the sea-breeze should set
in on the following day. Still, we could not resist the delight
of making an experimental trip, and so the sprit-sail and jib
were set, and we shoved off into the tide-way. A whale-boat goes
very fast before the wind, but will not beat, nor will she go
about well without using an oar; she is not, therefore the craft
best adapted for nautical evolutions, but we were too happy to
find much fault with her on that occasion; and so we sailed
several times across the river and back again in the very height
of enjoyment. Then suddenly luffing up in the middle of the
stream, the anchor was let go, and the sail brailed up, in order
that we might have the pleasure of sitting still in the very
midst of the waters, and rest, as it were, in the plenitude of
our satisfaction; and when the anchor dragged a few yards over
the sand before it held, and then suddenly brought up the boat
with a jerk, it seemed the climax of our pleasure. This, the
sagacious reader, in the depth of his gravity, will consider
extremely boyish. But should we not rejoice and be thankful
whenever we find among the many simple pleasures of our boyhood,
a single one which retains the power of gladdening our maturer
years? Alas! one after another they die down, and are no more to
be revived. We are apt to fancy that when the pleasures of youth
have lost their sweetness, and are no longer desired, it is an
evidence of our increasing wisdom. But it proves only that our
tastes, grown more vitiated, have taken new directions. We have
only changed our follies--and for the worse.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *"'Tis sweet to think we grow more wise When
Radcliffe's page we cease to prize, And turn to Malthus, and to
Hervey, For tombs, or cradles topsy-turvy; 'Tis sweet to flatter
one's dear self, And altered feelings vaunt, when pelf Is
passion, poetry, romance;-- And all our faith's in three per
cents." R. R. Madden</p>

<p>The breeze! the breeze! the glorious sea-breeze comes stealing
swiftly over the bar; it crosses the first bay. Like a dark
shadow it moves along the face of the river, and now it has
reached our landing-place and gone swiftly forwards, bringing
pleasure and thankfulness on its path. Now, my men, jump in! hand
me the grog and provision basket--and now loose the sails, and
shove off. There, we are fairly under weigh, and little Fig
whimpers his adieu to Jezebel and Nero, who for some minutes
accompany the course of the boat along the shore; and then
finding we are really going, remain fixed with astonishment,
gazing upon their departing friend. Soon, how soon, vanishes from
their breasts every feeling of regret! Before we have turned the
first headland we perceive them playfully biting each other about
the ears and neck: and now Nero scampers off under the trees in
the direction of the house, and Jezebel (type of her sex!)
hurries after him.</p>

<p>The breeze came rattling up the river, and the boat flew
merrily before it. We had occasionally sailed to Perth in the
passage-boats, and therefore knew something of the channel.
Sand-spits frequently run far out into the river, and those who
think only of steering a straight course, are very sure of
running aground several times during the voyage.</p>

<p>The distance from Fremantle to Perth, by water, is about
twelve miles, and it is about as many more from Perth to
Guildford. After passing the ferry-reach, the river appeared
about a quarter of a mile broad, having abrupt rocky banks on
either side; far a-head was the wooded bottom of Freshwater Bay.
Instead of coasting round this bay, we passed through a channel
cut across the spit into Melville water. Here is a beautiful site
for a house: a sloping lawn, covered with fine peppermint trees,
which in form resemble the weeping willow, and a great variety of
flowering shrubs, down to the water's edge. The view from the
house (lately the seat of Alfred Waylen, Esq.) is exceedingly
pleasing; on one hand is the fine sheet of Melville water, seven
miles in extent, and three or four in breadth, surrounded by
thick woods; in front is the graceful curve of Freshwater Bay;
and on the opposite side of the house from Melville water, the
river sweeps abruptly round through the deep and broad channel I
have already mentioned towards the ferry-reach.</p>

<p>We passed up Melville water, and in about an hour and a
quarter after starting came abreast of the town of Perth, which
we left about three-quarters of a mile on our larboard side, and
continued our passage up Perth water. We had now a difficult
channel to pass through, where the river is extremely shoal; and
in our inexperience we soon got the boat aground. Jumping into
the water, we succeeded in shoving her again into the channel,
and passed by a small island called Harrison's Island. It was
here that a French exploring party took refuge after they had
come so far up the river in spite of many alarms. These men were
some of the crew of Captain Perron, who was engaged in a survey
of this part of the coast of Australia, for the French
Government. During the night they were thrown into a state of
agitation and alarm by hearing incessant noises in the thick
woods on the main land, that were thought by some to be the
bellowing of wild bulls; by many the howling of wolves; and by
others the cries of savages. After a night spent in momentary
expectation of attack and massacre, the Frenchmen got into their
boats and hastened down the river again with the utmost
expedition, and scarcely thought themselves quite safe until they
were once more on board their ship.</p>

<p>This account of the French navigators was uppermost in the
minds of the English settlers on their first arrival, and
contributed greatly to the dread they felt at wandering a few
yards from the settlement. In those days, an orderly scarcely
durst take a message from the Governor to the Surveyor General's
tent, within sight, unless accompanied by a couple of his
fellows, with their muskets ready for action.</p>

<p>The borders of the river were in many parts, especially on the
present town site of Perth, so entangled with thick brushwood,
that enemies might be lying in swarms, close at hand, without the
least fear of detection. When Sir James Stirling and his party
first passed up the river in boats, they had the accounts of the
French sailors fully in mind, and were very cautious how they
landed. They passed the night in a state of preparation, if not
of alarm, and were kept in constant vigilance by the same fearful
noises.</p>

<p>The woods were now supposed to be filled with wild beasts, and
it was not until some time had elapsed that people became
convinced that the dreadful sounds which assailed their ears at
night proceeded from myriads of frogs. These little creatures
swarm in the samphire marshes near the river, and possess voices
far surpassing anything known in their species in Europe.</p>

<p>I was once looking out for ducks or coots in a thicket of
bulrushes higher than my head, when I was startled by hearing a
loud "bomb!" at no great distance from me. Having no idea what
kind of wild beast had made its lair in that dense thicket, I got
ready to fire both barrels on the first appearance of danger.
Again the same awful noise! It must be the snorting of a bison,
or vast buffalo, seeking shelter from the sun--or it may proceed
from some kind of water-dragon, I thought. I looked in every
direction, but could see no living creature; and at last was
about to retreat in the quietest manner possible, when I espied a
little frog perched on the top of a reed, about a yard from my
nose, and apparently looking full in my face, whilst, ever and
anon he inflated his cheeks, and uttered the fearful sounds I had
heard.</p>

<p>But besides the dread of wild beasts, the colonists were long
in the greatest apprehension of losing themselves in the vast
wilderness of forest by which they were on every side enclosed.
The country being extremely level, up to the Darling range of
hills, which is seen trending north and south about twelve or
fourteen miles at the back of Perth, a man once in the woods has
no object but the sun by which to direct his course. Every now
and then he comes upon an impassable swamp, which throws him out
of his track, and causes him infinite difficulty before he can
get round it, and then he begins to doubt of his true direction.
This is certainly, an awkward predicament; and nothing is so easy
as for inexperienced bushmen to lose their way. When once a man
begins to doubt whether he is right, he loses all confidence in
himself; he wanders first in one direction and then in another,
in the hope of finding something to guide him; and fears lest
every step should take him farther into the labyrinth of the
forest-wilderness. I have myself been several times lost for a
short period, and know how very unpleasant is the sensation. A
common soldier, sent on a message from Perth to Fremantle,
happened to get off the track. Becoming alarmed, he tried to
recover it, but as it had made a bend, he walked as far as he
thought its position ought to be, without success, and then
fancied he must have mistaken the direction. He therefore
diverged at right angles, and after walking a short time,
recollected that he must now be going in the wrong direction, as
he had left the path originally on his left hand. Accordingly he
turned back again, and walked so far without perceiving any signs
of the track that he now fancied he must be going parallel with
it. Had he gone on a few yards father, all would have been right,
but now he really took a parallel course, and after walking for
some time longer, he again turned back, and walked in another
direction. Now this man had the sea on one side of him, and the
river on the other, at most not more than four miles apart; yet
the dread of having walked back into the wilderness behind Perth
overpowered his faculties, and he walked for hours in a circle of
about half a mile in diameter. He might have considered that the
Darling Hills were behind Perth, and must have brought him up,
but reason does not always act freely at these times. At length,
completely exhausted, he sat down at the foot of a tree, where he
remained all night, expecting death from starvation, from the
natives, or some unknown wild beasts.</p>

<p>The next day he walked again as long as his strength would
allow, but before night sank down in the extremity of despair. It
was not until the third day of his misfortunes that he was
tracked up by a party sent in search of him, and guided by
friendly natives, who followed his many devious steps with
unerring eyes.</p>

<p>Another man, similarly lost in the interior, after vainly
trying to recover the road, determined to make for the coast,
which he knew lay to the west. He was also confident that the sun
regularly set in that quarter, and therefore, he boldly
determined to trust himself to the guidance of the sun, making
sure, that if he followed it far enough, it must lead him to the
coast at last. Accordingly, he marched after the sun till
night-fall and then went cheerfully to sleep, having supped upon
some bread and pork, which he carried with him. The next morning,
at sunrise, he started off in the direction of his guide,
perfectly unconscious that he was now retracing his steps, and
journeying eastward. All day, however, he continued to follow the
sun, and when it set, wondered that he had not yet reached the
sea. At night, he finished his bread and pork, and the next
morning set off again on his long and tedious journey; still, at
night, there was no appearance of the ocean, and he fired off his
gun at a black cockatoo, which he killed with his only charge of
shot.</p>

<p>Upon this bird he lived for the next two days, and for two
more he subsisted upon roots. He had now given up all hopes of
discovering the sea, and had lain down to die, when he was found
by his master and a party of natives, who had come in search of
him.</p>

<p>It appeared that he was found upon almost the very spot on
which he had first lost himself.</p>

<p>When once a man begins to believe that he is lost in the
wilderness, he feels as helpless as one who is blind-folded at
the game of blindman's buff, and who has been twirled round so
often, that he has no idea whereabouts the door or the fire-place
is situated. Those who are used to the bush steer their course
with almost unerring precision by the sun, and a few known
objects, but there are numbers who never acquire this power. the
natives appear to know by instinct the direction of every spot
they wish to reach; and many white men seem to possess the same
faculty.</p>

<p>But I have almost forgotten that we are all this time sailing
up the rive in our whale-boat. It was a very beautiful sail, and
we repeatedly passed cheerful-looking farm-houses on either
bank-- sometimes goodly mansions with park-like enclosures about
them. In the afternoon we dined upon cold wild-duck; and as each
man sipped his grog in his pannikin, we felt so exceedingly
cheerful, that Simon and Meliboeus favoured the public with "Away
with melancholy!" and divers other agreeable ditties. The wind
however died away, and evening set in as we passed Guildford. The
banks of the river had now risen into steep cliffs, which threw a
deep gloom over our course. We had furled the sails, and taken to
the oars, and as we blindly poked our way, we began to think this
kind of work was not quite so agreeable as it had at first
appeared. Nothing was now to be seen but the outlines of the
steep sides of the river on which occasional houses were visible,
the light streaming through the windows, and making us fancy how
comfortable every thing must be within, and how pleasant it would
be to be sitting at supper in a cheerful room, instead of toiling
at our oars with blistered hands, and without the prospect of a
good bed at the end of the voyage.</p>

<p>Romance was gone; the sad reality of life remained. Still we
pulled along, steering by turns, and doubting and wondering every
hundred yards whether we had not gone past the place we sought.
Sometimes we paused on our oars to debate the question, but still
we continued to push on; till at length we found ourselves close
abreast of the wooden building we were so anxiously looking out
for, and experienced a sensation of surprise as well as of
delight.</p>

<p>The boat was soon safely moored, and the door of the building
unlocked; and by the light of a wax taper, which we had brought
on purpose, we found ourselves in a large empty room, without any
fire-place. A heap of dead wood was soon collected at the
entrance; and a glorious fire lighted up the small enclosure
which surrounded the building, and sufficiently illuminated a
considerable portion of the room itself. The kettle being put on,
we soon had tea ready, and managed to get through our rations of
bread and pork, not forgetting to give little Fig his supper, who
sat very seriously before the fire, wondering what it all
meant.</p>

<p>Cigars, and brandy and water, having been duly administered
before bed-time, we next proceeded to litter down coats and
cloaks; and having made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances
would admit of, stretched ourselves on the floor, with a few
sighs and thoughts of home, and slept until day-break.</p>

<p>The first thing we did next morning was to unload the boat;
and then having breakfasted, and secured the door on our effects,
we started on our homeward trip, and had the satisfaction of
pulling the whole distance to Perth, where we were obliged to
sleep the next night, as it was impossible for us to get down
Melville water in the teeth of a strong sea-breeze.</p>

<p>When we had to start again with another load of goods, our
hearts were much heavier than on the first excursion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 8.</h3>

<h4>FARMS ON THE RIVER.</h4>

<p>First impressions endure the longest, and are recalled with
most pleasure. Further acquaintance does not always give us a
truer idea of the value of the object, as familiarity frequently
makes us overlook as insignificant that which is constantly
before us. It is not the object that is proved to be really less
valuable as we become better acquainted with it, but our own
views which change with our position. My first impressions on
visiting the various farms, or rather gentlemen's residences, on
the banks of the Swan, were extremely agreeable. I thought
nothing could be more delightful than to live at one of those
picturesque and lovely spots. If the romance of that first
feeling be now faded from my heart, it is not because I have
discovered that all which I then saw was an illusion, but because
a more sober state of mind--that state into which the mind
settles as the excitement of sudden change and unwonted novelty
subsides--teaches that happiness is not local, and that it is no
more likely to be found in the finest country residence than in
the main street of a town.</p>

<p>At the first view we are apt to imagine that people who live
in one of these pleasant retreats must needs be happier than
ourselves, who possess nothing but a miserable shilling.</p>

<p>This is the delusion; and when with increasing knowledge, we
recover from this, we cease to envy and to covet.</p>

<p>My first ride up the Swan was a most delightful one. No park
in England could be more beautiful than the grounds around some
of the dwellings.</p>

<p>The ride through the scattered village of Guildford, with a
view of the rich and extensive flats of Woodbridge, the property
of Sir James Stirling, and the frequent bends of the river, is a
very agreeable one. The whole country of the middle and upper
Swan resembles a vast English park. We passed the pretty country
church of the Middle Swan, with its modest parsonage beside it,
and then proceeded through wooded ravines along a pleasant drive
to one of the most hospitable mansions in the colony. Extensive
stables, barns and out-buildings occupied the back of the
premises. As it was now too late in the evening to see much of
the surrounding scenery, we entered the house of Samuel Moore,
Esq., and sat down to an excellent dinner. In the evening we had
music--pianos are as common in Western Australia as in England.
At night I occupied a sofa in the parlour. The excitement and
novelty of my present situation--so many thousands of leagues
removed from the spot on which, only a few months before, I had
deemed I was to spend my life--kept me wakeful; and about one
o'clock I arose, and opening the French window, stepped out into
the verandah. How solemn was the scene before me, faintly lighted
by the moon! In front of the house was a pretty sloping garden,
and below this stretched a broad clearing, now waving with corn,
amidst which rose up a number of scattered, lofty, dead trees,
which had been purposely killed by ringing the bark. How mournful
they looked in that gloomy light!</p>

<p>The river bounded this clearing, and beyond the river
stretched its high bank, covered with forest trees, the advanced
lines, as it were, of the vast wilderness which lay behind. From
out the depths of those woods rose the occasional shrieks of an
owl, or other night bird, and at intervals the long dismal howl
of a wild dog--the only carnivorous animal indigenous in that
country. The air was balmy, but there was something in the
mournful aspect of the scene that weighed upon the spirits, and
made one feel inexpressibly lonely in the midst of that boundless
wilderness of forest.</p>

<p>Time soon takes off the edge of novelty, and long ago I have
learned to feel perfectly at ease and cheerful, whilst lying in
the midst of much deeper solitude, with no companions but my
horse grazing near me, and the fire at my feet. There is no
country in the world so safe for the traveller as Western
Australia.</p>

<p>The next day we went over the farm of our host. His best land
was on the flats at the river side, but his upland, by judicious
cultivation, is made productive and valuable. A carriage-drive
extends through the grounds and affords beautiful prospects of
the river, and of the estates through which it runs; and on the
other side, of the Darling Hills. The hedge-rows on this property
are planted with olive, almond, and peach trees--an admirable
policy, which ought to be adopted throughout Australia. In a few
years-- for the olive bears fruit much sooner here than in the
south of Europe--a valuable traffic in olive-oil may be expected
from this colony.</p>

<p>The ingenious gentleman who owns this property (which is, in
point of soil, one of the worst farms on the Swan) continues
annually to add to its value by his persevering system of
improvement. He has had a steam-engine constructed on his own
premises, and under his personal superintendence; and he grinds
his own flour as well as that of his neighbours.</p>

<p>The neighbouring estate of W. L. Brockman, Esq., is a more
valuable property, and equally attractive in possessing a
well-cultivated farm, a beautiful situation, a comfortable
residence, and an amiable family.</p>

<p>With similar energy and savoir faire, all the beautiful farms
on this river might be made most enviable residences.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of farming, I may mention a
reaping-machine which has been introduced into this colony from
South Australia, where it was invented. It is only adapted to a
very dry climate, but there it is most valuable. A pair of horses
push a machine before them, which consists of a threshing-machine
and a set of revolving combs, some six feet wide. These combs, in
their revolutions, catch up the wheat, and tear off the ears from
the stalks, throwing them back into the threshing-machine. A
field of wheat is thus reaped and threshed as fast as the horses
can walk over it. The straw is afterwards mown.</p>

<p>The roads are hard and good in this neighbourhood, and some of
the settlers keep their open carriages.</p>

<p>I doubt whether I have conveyed to the reader a just idea of
some of the pleasantest spots which are to be met with in this
colony; but I would not have him (full of romantic thoughts and
agricultural purposes) rush hastily into the mart and sell his
substance in order to lead a life of tranquil retirement in this
distant Eden. It requires a good deal of philosophy to make a
contented settler. Most colonists leave England full of virtuous
resolutions--with bosoms glowing with the ardent love of nature;
and fully persuaded that they need nothing to make them happy but
a small farm, beautifully situated, with its cottage ornee, and
its spreading vines, and a noble fig-tree, beneath which they are
to sit in the cool of the evening, with their little ones around
them. All this they may really possess; and for some time they
are in raptures at the novel feeling of being men of landed
interest. This is always the first ambition of a colonist--to
have some property which he may lawfully call his own. And,
indeed, the human heart never expands with more satisfactory
pride than in the breast of him whose territorial possessions
have hitherto been confined to a few flower-pots in his
parlour-window, but who now stands firmly beneath a lofty
gum-tree, and looking round him, murmurs "This is mine!" It is,
indeed, a very pleasant sensation, but, unfortunately, it is very
short-lived.</p>

<p>Men do not come out to a colony to spend an income, but to
make a living. When once their capital is laid out in the
acquisition of a farm, and in the necessary purchase of stock,
they have to raise money out of it to pay their labourers' wages,
and find their households with tea, sugar, clothing, and
"sundries." Many things may be grown upon your farm, but not
everything. At first, the settler is satisfied with finding that
he can sell sufficient produce to enable him to pay his way,
provided he practise the utmost economy, and exhibit a reasonable
degree of good management.</p>

<p>But soon there are extra expenses to be liquidated; a long
illness in his family brings him in debt to the doctor; or his
neighbour has injured him, and he has, thereupon, further injured
himself by going to law and avenging the wrong. He now becomes
discontented, and thinks he is as badly off as he was before he
left England; or, perhaps he may have sustained no losses, and is
just able to live on his property without getting into debt; he
forgets, however, the principles on which he came out to settle;
he begins to complain that he is not making money. It is true he
leads an easier life than he did in England; he is not striving
and struggling for existence as he was there, but he is making no
money. His wife asks him daily, in the pleasantest connubial key,
why he brought them all from England, to bury them there, and see
nobody from morn till night? What, she urges, is to become of
their children? Will Jonadab, their first-born, be a gentleman
like his maternal ancestors?--But how, indeed should he, with the
pursuits of a cow-boy and the hands of a scavenger? It is very
well for one who cares nothing for genteel society, and whose
bearish manners, in fact, unfit him for it, to lead such a life;
but is she to endure this for ever, and see her daughters married
to men who wear long beards and Blucher boots?</p>

<p>These incessant attacks at length overthrow the ennobling
philosophy of the colonist. He knows not where to procure more
than he already possesses, or he would gladly return to the
country of his fore-fathers; but alas! he sees no prospect of
gaining even a bare livelihood there. Without knowing, then, how
or where to improve his condition, he deplores the penury of his
lot, and sighs for wealth which he has no prospect of ever
obtaining.</p>

<p>My own opinion has ever been that colonists, with few
exceptions, must always be poor men. They may possess large
estates and numerous herds; but the more numerous these herds,
the less is their marketable value: for population and demand can
never increase in equal ratio with the supply. A man, therefore,
who possesses the elements of wealth, may still be poor in the
article of money.</p>

<p>Nor will his estates produce him more income than his herds;
for in most cases the only rent which his tenants can afford to
pay is in kind. 'The only real wealth to a colony is the
incessant influx of immigration, combining capital and
labour.'</p>

<p>There are some of us, happily, who still retain the ancient
philosophy. We have not thought of pecuniary wealth, and are
content to live easily, with those moderate blessings which
attach to a beneficent climate and a simple mode of life.</p>

<p>So very little is required which money can buy, that men seem
to be annoyed at the fact, and insist upon creating new
wants.</p>

<p>A great deal of discontent and repining generally prevails in
a colony. People who have lived miserably in England, who have
long doubtfully hovered between suicide and highway robbery,
determine at length to adopt the still more melancholy
alternative of emigration. After bequeathing a few tender sighs
to the country which they have hitherto regarded rather as a
step-mother than a parent; and having pathetically solicited the
sympathy of those who more readily bestow upon them a few pounds
than a few tears, in the pious hope of never seeing them more,
our emigrants betake themselves to the favoured land of their
adoption, in the full and confident belief that they have nothing
now to do, but live "like gentlemen," though without the means,
or any other qualifications of that class. Their Faith is of that
affecting and unlimited description, as to lead them to suppose
that He who beneficently feeds the ravens will not neglect the
rooks or the drones.</p>

<p>In a very short time, however, they find that they are no
better off in the new than they were in the old country. The
gum-trees do not produce bread, nor the banksias shoulders of
mutton; and, consequently, their hopes have been miserably
disappointed, and they loudly proclaim their wants and sorrows in
the streets. There are unfortunately in all colonies--those
'refugia peccatorum'--many emigrants of this class, idle and
worthless, who have never done well, and never will succeed in
any part of the world.</p>

<p>A colonial life is not for these men, and we recommend them to
pass on to some other region as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 9.</h3>

<h4>THE MORAL THERMOMETER OF COLONIES.</h4>

<p>In the chief town of every colony, there is always agreeable
society to be found among the resident Government officers, and
the other principal inhabitants. Many estimable individuals are
to be met with in all communities; in that in which I have myself
resided for some years, there are many for whom I entertain the
highest regard. I hope, therefore, it will not be considered
that, in the remarks which I am about to make, I am actuated by
any ill or invidious feeling, or at all allude to individuals.
Since I have undertaken the task of drawing sketches of colonial
life, I must not endeavour to conceal any portion of the truth,
nor tacitly allow erroneous conclusions to be drawn from my
remarks.</p>

<p>I have already observed that a good and kindly feeling towards
one another prevails in this colony among the settlers generally.
But I must qualify this remark by adding--in all cases in which
individual interests are not concerned. There is less perhaps of
the 'spirit of dealing' in this colony than in any other of the
British empire. Ours is not a mercantile community, and the
farm-settlers generally are young men of good birth and
gentlemanly spirit. Still, even here, beyond all question, exists
the same odious tendency (though less apparent) which prevails
more or less in all colonies, to advance self-interest on every
possible occasion, without being deterred by any scruples
whatsoever.</p>

<p>When men become emigrants, they leave behind them their
relations, friends, connexions, and all their old associations,
and appear upon a new theatre of action, where they have no
feelings to consult beyond their own personal wishes and
interests.</p>

<p>They find themselves suddenly emancipated from all those
restraints which formerly acted with a salutary influence upon
their natural inclinations; and having no one near them whose
opinion they regard, or whom they care to conciliate, they fall
rapidly into the belief that they have no one to live for but
themselves, and, consequently, make self the sole guide of all
their actions, and sole god of their idolatry.</p>

<p>This spirit of 'Yankeeism' is the prevailing spirit of
colonies. It is the natural consequence of the isolated state in
which men feel themselves to exist, when they have no longer
those less selfish motives of action that influenced and
regulated their conduct under other circumstances. The eye of a
parent no longer watches over them with approbation or anxiety;
and what has a still more powerful influence upon their conduct,
they are now beyond the observation of that circle of friends,
relations, and acquaintance, to which they had been known from
childhood; which had constituted their world, and the censure or
approbation of which determined their state of self-reproach or
self-satisfaction. Few men may be trusted far who can say, "I am
not known here," for these are always the people who care least
what they do. Good and well-meaning persons will exclaim,
"Colonists can have very little sense of religion, if they allow
themselves to act at a distance differently from what they would
do at home." Those who have more than a theoretical acquaintance
with mankind, and who are used to look upon them in their
undisguised selfishness, know well that their sense of religion
is greatly dependent upon the circumstances in which men find
themselves placed. We are not speaking of what such and such
people would do and feel, but of what is really done and felt by
thousands.</p>

<p>Besides, I have already premised that it is not every colonist
who acts on these principles, but that such is the general
tendency to act in a colony.</p>

<p>We can now understand the origin of that intense selfishness
in the American character, which has never yet been cast aside,
and which, in fact, is perpetuated by a republican form of
government.</p>

<p>The high and nice sense of honour, the chivalrous generosity,
the frank acknowledgment of superiority, and the ready devotion
of self to the interests of others at the call of duty,
constituted the brightest ornaments of the feudal system, and
still glitter (though with feebler lustre) among the fragments of
that system throughout civilized Europe.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Trade, which has shattered feudalism, has
impaired the brightness of that principle which was the soul of
feudalism. Nor has religion yet succeeded in supplying the loss.
Religion, which is the bond between Man and his God, has less
influence in regulating his dealings with his fellows than
Honour, which is the bond between man and man.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *In making this observation, I refer to the general
conduct of the World; and am far from intending to say, that
honour ought to have more influence with mankind than religion.
The truly religious, a small but sacred band, "do justly, love
mercy, and walk humbly with God."</p>

<p>And when the principle of honour loses its purity, you may be
sure that the principle of religion is already decayed or dead.
Now the principle of honour being (so to speak) of human origin,
depends greatly for existence upon the opinions of men; and when
we are emancipated from all great regard for those opinions, it
almost inevitably follows that our sense of honour becomes much
impaired; and having no longer any fear of censure, we no longer
have any feeling of shame.</p>

<p>In a colony, then, is most apparent the accursed Spirit of
Trade-- that insidious spirit which undermines the truth of the
heart, which destroys its most generous impulses, and sneers at
every manifestation of disinterestedness. The first object of a
colonist is that of a petty shopkeeper,--to grasp at every thing
which is likely to benefit himself, without regard to justice,
religion, or honour. His own interest is the only guide of his
actions, and becomes the very soul of his existence. He came out
to make a fortune, if possible, and he thinks himself justified
in using every means to this end. Do not suppose that he is a
downright villain who would commit highway robbery. He would be
greatly shocked at such an imputation, for his conscience is
still too timid for so flagrant a crime. He merely follows the
golden maxim of 'caveat emptor', and, like the petty shopkeeper,
thinks he is justified in cheating those who are too stupid to
look after their own interests, and too ignorant or too feeble to
enforce their just dues.</p>

<p>When that nice sense of honour which rules the conduct of the
high-minded gentleman, and makes him scorn to take advantage of
the ignorance or the necessities of another, ceases to influence,
the accursed spirit becomes dominant, and men look with suspicion
on all around them.</p>

<p>It has become the pride and the boast of colonists, as of
horse-dealers, that they are sharp fellows; that they have cut
their eye-teeth, and are remarkably wide-awake. These honourable
distinctions are acknowledged by the simple-minded with alarm.
They feel like men involved among a mob, and instinctively button
up their pockets.</p>

<p>The moral thermometer in a colony is lamentably low.</p>

<p>We do not, however, look upon this state of things as
irremediable, and without hope; on the contrary, we doubt not but
the Better Spirit will in time resume its pre-eminence, and
colonists will be respected for their elevated sentiments and
high sense of honour, rather than for their acuteness in driving
a bargain. This evil, which is the natural consequence of their
present condition as isolated atoms, unconnected together by
those bonds of mutual respect which confine men in older
countries, will cease as society becomes re-organized, and men
feel themselves occupying in a colony the same position, as
regards obligations and duties, that they would have filled in
the parent state. As they settle themselves more firmly in their
places, they will come to feel that respect which ever attaches
to the character of HOME; and conscious that example is necessary
from men who occupy prominent positions, a higher tone will
insensibly be assumed, and the Better Spirit again be diffused
throughout all the ramifications of society. But to this end, it
is most essential that every aid should be given that Government
has the power to bestow. Religious instruction, and that good
example which, we may assume, is ever afforded to society by the
English clergy, are the principal instruments to be sought. In
Western Australia there are at this time only six clergymen, who
are scattered over a country many hundred miles in extent. Many
districts are, unavoidably, entirely without the exhortations and
offices of a minister. At King George's Sound, an important post,
no clergyman is seen from one year to another. Human beings are
born, married, and buried, without a minister to baptize, to
teach, to bless, or to give consolation in their extremity. There
is no bishop to consecrate, to watch over, or to reprove.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *By the munificence of Miss Burdett Coutts, a
bishopric has been recently founded in South Australia; and the
Western Colony is for the present to be included in the same
diocese. But when it is remembered that there is no over-land
communication between the colonies, and the route by sea occupies
about ten days, it must be evident that this provision is very
inadequate to our wants.</p>

<p>This is a state of things that must be remedied, or moral
improvements cannot be expected.</p>

<p>The Roman Church has been more thoughtful of her children in
this colony, there being now settled here a bishop, and about a
dozen priests of that persuasion--reason the more for the active
interference of a Protestant Government to protect the spiritual
welfare of the Protestant community.</p>

<p>The next most important object is the education of the youth
of the colony. So soon as ever Government can afford the grant of
a few hundreds a year, free-schools ought to be established in
various districts. Such is usually the scarcity of money in a
colony, that parents cannot afford to bestow even the commonest
education upon their children. Of course, I allude only to the
general condition of society; there are individuals who educate
their families in a judicious and sufficient manner; but the
great prevailing want is not the less felt and deplored. Boys,
the sons of men who have themselves been well educated, are early
made to supply the place of labourers and servants. Hardy and
manly in appearance, they are naturally rough and uncouth in
manner, and unhappily possess no mental stores beyond those early
principles of gain which have grown with their growth. In their
anxiety that their sons should do well in the world, the parent's
first object is to impress upon them the necessity of making the
most of every thing. Their early powers are exercised in selling
stores, sheep, cattle, or other produce, and they are applauded
in proportion to the hard bargain which they have driven. If a
man, threatened with law proceedings, is compelled to sell his
whole crop of potatoes at a ruinous loss, our keen and knowing
youngster glories in the opportunity of making a bargain by which
he shall profit to the amount of a hundred per cent., though the
seller return to his agitated family writhing with despair. The
malleable intellect of our youth is annealed by the Demon of Gain
upon the anvil of Self-interest.</p>

<p>National education is one of the first objects of a paternal
government. The course of study ought ever to be adapted to the
circumstances and position of the scholars. In the first years of
a colony, the human mind peculiarly exhibits a downward tendency.
Few men prove themselves in their new condition of life superior
or equal to the character which they had formerly borne, as
pious, learned, or humane. The circumstances which formerly so
eminently conduced to the maintenance of piety, the cultivation
of intellect, and the exercise of benevolence, no longer exist.
Solitary and selfish from position, men of naturally generous
temper and good disposition, feel their hearts contract and
shrivel within them. Surrounded by a sordid and selfish crew,
they find no objects for sympathy, no inducements for the
increase or the preservation of knowledge, no animating impulse
to lead them forward in a good cause. Struggling for a time in
the net which is around them, they at length fall from the edge,
down into the seething cauldron, and become fused among the
mass.</p>

<p>'The tendency of colonization is to deteriorate.' The first
object of Government should therefore be to arrest this impulse,
and remedy the evil so far as may be accomplished. If the
original settlers degenerate in their moral condition, their
children sink still lower. When parents cease to feel the
influence of those high and pure principles in which they were
themselves brought up, they naturally forget to inculcate them in
the minds of their offspring. What, then, are the guides that
direct these in their progress through life? What can they be but
Self-interest, relieved perhaps occasionally by a few touches of
Good-nature?</p>

<p>The young women inevitably grow up mere creatures of impulse.
Where are those high qualities which are necessary to give them
their proper influence over the minds and actions of the other
sex? Where is that powerful sense of the duties of their calling
and position, that is necessary to create confidence in the
breast of the lover or the husband? Where are those unswerving
principles which alone can keep them, through trial and
temptation, in the right way?</p>

<p>Woman, alas! has lost her power, when she ceases to inspire
veneration and command respect.</p>

<p>It is the interest of every colony, and the duty of every
Government, to raise the moral character and condition of the
people. The necessity of this must be forcibly present in the
minds of those to whom the duties of legislation are intrusted;
and as the most obvious means of improvement lie in the judicious
instruction of the young generation, the attention of Government
must soon be directed to this grand object.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 10.</h3>

<h4>COUNTRY LIFE.</h4>

<p>It is most undeniably true, "that there is no place like
England," for men who are in "easy circumstances," and who
therefore think no more of direct or indirect taxation, and of
those multitudinous burthens which highly-civilized life imposes,
than a besom-maker's ass does of the load under which it daily
journeys. But how many thousands are there (children of sad
parents--Toil and Sorrow) who find their utmost efforts scarcely
sufficient to keep them out of the debtor's prison! Continual
gloom fills the chambers of their hearts; the sun bestows its
cheering rays in vain; and all the gay and beautiful influences
of the bright world of Nature fail to inspirit him whose every
energy is directed to the task of raising his family beyond the
threatening grasp of Want. In his few moments of relaxation, when
those whom he loves--for whom he is toiling unto death--hang
around him with gentle fondness; in those sweet moments, when
love unutterable beams through the glistening eye, and tender
solicitude watches the care-worn face, seeking to win one happy
smile--even then, he dare not give himself up to joy. The thought
is never absent from him that life perhaps is ebbing fast; the
very labours to which his only hope of income is attached, are
gradually wearing him down to the grave; and when he is no more,
what shall be the lot of those whose beaming faces smile so
sweetly? What struggles, what miseries are in store for the
beloved wife, and those young and innocent daughters whose hearts
are full of him! No! he dare not give himself up to joy; he
smiles in answer to their endearments--but it is rather a shadow
than a sunbeam that passes across his countenance.</p>

<p>How many thousands are there in England so circumstanced, who
curse the artificial state of society in which they are compelled
to live! In their profession or trade they are bound to keep up a
certain degree of appearance, or they are shunned by those whom
it is their chief interest to conciliate. The great bug-bear ever
present in the mind of an Englishman, is the dread of not being
thought sufficiently "respectable." Professional men and
tradesmen depend for their subsistence upon appearances. To be
flashy is as bad as to be shabby; the great object is to appear
substantial. If you are rich, you have less temptation to be
dishonest, and may consequently be trusted. Every man, therefore,
who depends upon the opinion of others, is compelled to assume
the appearance of being comfortably circumstanced in order to
inspire confidence. Character is the life-blood of Englishmen,
but character alone will seldom extricate a man from the slough
of Poverty. In our highly artificial state of society, something
more powerful than character alone is required to place a man in
the road to fortune--call it as you please, tact or humbug.</p>

<p>This necessity for keeping up appearances in order to move in
that rank of life which his business requires him to occupy, is
the heaviest tax imposed upon the income of an Englishman. How
often does it draw from him all his profits, leaving him to
lament how little he is enabled to lay by annually for his
children! Many times, without doubt, he wishes he durst retire to
a cottage too small to admit the visits of the heartless
acquaintance who form his "fashionable" world. Does their society
afford him or his family any real happiness? Is it not rather the
cause of many heart-burnings to him and to them? How much happier
he feels he should be, had he never looked abroad for happiness,
but sought it only around his own hearth! To see his daughters
elegantly attired, would gratify him extremely, were it not for
the unwelcome reminiscences of expense. But would they look less
lovely to his eyes, or be less dear to his heart, when moving
about him in the useful performance of domestic duties, clad in
homely garments, and thinking more of him and home than of
visiting and display?</p>

<p>How economically, and how happily too, might he live, were his
own house his world, and his wife and children the only beings
for whose opinion he cared! But alas! these are the persons whose
opinion is of least importance in his pursuit of fortune. He must
do as the world does if he would secure its smiles, and is
compelled to think less of happiness than of gain.</p>

<p>Is such a man happier, leading such a life, than he would be
as a colonist? Here--ever blessed be the recollection!--there is
no necessity for sacrificing peace of mind to appearance. The man
whose conduct proves him to be of gentlemanly mould, is
everywhere treated as an equal; and though his occupation and
mode of living be ever so humble, he loses nothing in the
consideration of his fellow-colonists. The half-pay officer, or
gentleman farmer, who occasionally drives his own cart, or sows
the seed which he has purchased in the market, is not thought
less qualified to act as a magistrate, nor is less respected by
the great and small in his neighbourhood. His cares are all
directed towards obtaining substantial comforts for his family,
and not towards making a display in the eyes of the little world
around him.</p>

<p>Conscious that he is respected only for his character as an
upright man, and that as every one knows he is not wealthy, it
would be ridiculous to affect the appearance of wealth, he wears
the coarsest garments with more pleasure than the finest coat,
and draws all his happiness from domestic sources. His sons and
daughters equally indifferent to show--though the latter, at
least, are always neatly dressed--are busied with their different
duties, all tending to promote the general comfort.</p>

<p>Happy family!--how pleasantly the evenings pass in your
society! Gladly would I ride many miles to spend such pleasant
hours, and witness happiness so unpretending and real. How
cheerful looks that large room, with its glorious fire of
Jarra-wood and black-boys, (for it is the winter season,) and how
lightly those young girls move about, arranging the tea-table,
and preparing for the evening meal! The kind-hearted mother,
relieved of all duties but that of superintendence, sits by the
fire chatting cheerfully with the guest, whose eyes,
nevertheless, wander round the room after a certain light and
dancing shape; the host, a man of eld, but stalwart in
appearance, full of hospitality and noble courtesy, appears in
his easy slippers and an old and well-worn coat, which formerly
had seen service in London ball-rooms. He discourses not only of
the crops and colonial politics, but of literature, and the last
news from England; for like many other colonists he receives the
English papers, and patronizes the 'Quarterly Review'. On the
sofa lie the latest numbers of 'Punch' and 'the Illustrated
London News'--some four months old, of course--for the ladies
like fun and pictures, whilst their father laboriously wades
through a three months' accumulation of the 'Times'.</p>

<p>With what alacrity the old gentleman rises up and welcomes a
traveller, who has unexpectedly arrived, and has just stabled his
horse, and seen him fed before he made his appearance in the
parlour! There is no beating about the bush for a bed, or an
invitation to supper. Of the latter he is certain, and
indifferent about the former; for having slept the last night
under a tree, he feels sure of making himself comfortable on the
sofa, or on the hearth-rug before the fire. And then the girls,
who have no affectation or nonsense about them, crowd round the
new-arrived, and ply him with questions about their young friends
in other parts of the colony, and whether he was at the last ball
at Government House, and what was most worn on that
occasion--until the good man, laughing, breaks through the
circle, declaring he will answer no more questions till he has
had his supper, and, it may be, a glass of whisky-toddy
screeching hot.</p>

<p>During the evening the girls sing, and happily they sing well;
and they take most pleasure in those songs which papa likes best
to hear. And the poor bachelor-guest, who looks on, feels his
heart melting within him, and reviles himself for the destitution
in which he lives at home. Suddenly, perhaps, horses at a gallop
are heard to enter the yard; and soon afterwards two young
fellows, fresh from the capital, come dashing into the room, full
of spirits, and vowing they have gallopped over on purpose to
ascertain whether the ladies were still living. Here is authority
of undoubted value for everything relating to the ball at
Government House; and the merits and appearance of every person
who attended it are soon brought under discussion. This naturally
inspires the young people with a desire to dance; so the table is
pushed aside, and papa being squeezed nearly into the fire, mamma
takes her place at the piano, and bursts off with the Annen
Polka.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to you, dear reader, who have an idea that
colonists are merely wild beasts, that such things should be. But
so it is; and though people may dance the Cellarius with more
gravity in the saloons of St. James's, I question whether dancing
be half the fun there that our light-hearted colonists seem to
think it. There are no strangers in small colonies--it is always
a family party dancing together; and consequently, people are as
merry as if it were Christmas-time all the year round.</p>

<p>Your fashionable people may pity them; but God help them, poor
things! In their dark and degraded state they seem to enjoy
themselves so much, that I should not like them to be put out of
conceit with themselves, or made to repudiate whatever gives them
innocent pleasure. Nor are they entirely insensible to the good
opinion of great people; for when they learnt that the Polka was
thought vulgar at Buckingham Palace, they had serious intentions
of denying it admittance into the ball-rooms of Perth; and I
sincerely believe it would speedily have pined away and died,
like a maiden under the breath of slander, but for a confidently
entertained hope that her Majesty would never hear of the
offences of the people of Perth--and people will do all kinds of
things when they can do them secretly. So the Polka continues to
be danced in Western Australia; and the courage of the dancers
has been much revived of late by hearing that it is still greatly
in vogue at home, notwithstanding the august censures said to
have been passed upon it.</p>

<p>A country life might always be a happy one, were people
possessed of the smallest competence, and of properly regulated
minds. There is as much unhappiness, or at least discontent, in
colonies as elsewhere; but discontented colonists are the
greatest fools in the world, because they have themselves created
the evils, and the remedies are generally in their own power. The
grand object of man's search is happiness, which he strives to
obtain by a thousand various ways. Wealth he covets, because he
fondly believes that it contains the prize he seeks; but if
happiness may be found without wealth, of what value are riches?
Money is not so indispensable a necessary in a colony. Very
little indeed suffices to enable a proprietor on the banks of the
Swan, the Avon, or the Brunswick, to bring up his family in
comfort, and to perform all the rights of a generous hospitality.
The discontent which is so often felt in colonies arises from two
causes: first, it is the natural feeling of those who emigrate
late in life; who, although unsuccessful at home, have ever been
fondly attached to home associations, to the friends and
connexions with whom they have been bound up during many years,
and to the national belief that a man can never be truly happy
out of England. In addition to this, the emigrant of mature years
has been so long accustomed to feel himself living in the very
centre of intelligence, he has so long been accustomed to watch
the progress of political action at home and on the continent,
and to drink the fresh draughts of scientific discovery at the
fountain-head, that now, when far removed from the busy and
exciting scenes of the ever-moving panorama of European life, he
feels lost in the wilderness--a fragment of drift-wood washed
ashore and left far behind by the fast-progressing waves of
Knowledge and Action.</p>

<p>The second cause of discontent is found in the non-acquisition
of money. Every one goes out to a colony with the full conviction
that he shall make a fortune in a few years, and then return to
England and become a man of landed interest.</p>

<p>A man has to conquer his first disappointments before he can
become a happy settler; he has to form new and more just ideas of
his actual position. Generally, it is necessary that he should
return to England once more before he can entirely appreciate the
advantages open to him in a colony. He then fully perceives how
much more difficult it is to obtain a bare subsistence in the old
country. He finds that with the utmost economy he cannot supply
the numerous wants of his family, and he longs for his old
Australian dwelling again, and the easy, independent life which
he was accustomed to lead, when his children used to run about in
brown holland, and his wife looked becoming in printed cotton,
and thought no beverage so good as the wine which she had
assisted to make.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 11.</h3>

<h4>PERSECUTIONS.</h4>

<p>Scepticism is the offspring of ignorance. There are many
people still living who doubt the existence of dragons; who go so
far as to assert that such creatures never did exist upon the
face of this earth, and never did torment and destroy the
inhabitants thereof, and persecute forlorn maidens. They scoff at
the records which have descended to our times, as fabulous
legends, composed by idle monks; who were accustomed to write
fictitious histories during the dark ages. They deny to
historical ballads that authority which Mr. Macaulay attaches to
them; and yet the principal fact in the biography of Andromeda
(even before the times of the monks) may have been true; and the
poor people of Wantley may really have been harassed by the
celebrated dragon of that ilk. We speak seriously.</p>

<p>Geologists have ascertained beyond a doubt that winged
monsters of the size described in ancient legends did really
inhabit this earth at some period or other. Happily they no
longer exist of the same dimensions as formerly; like the
descendants of Anak, they have become 'fined down', as it were,
in the course of ages, until their proportions no longer awaken
personal fear, nor do their exploits engage the attention of
historians. Sometimes, however, the ancient ferocity, the
propensity for devastation, still breaks forth, even in the
diminutive descendants of this formidable race, and persecuted
Man feels himself driven to the brink of despair.</p>

<p>Soon after I had settled at Perth, in a small house, with
three quarters of an acre of ground about it, I began to think of
improving my little territory. I thought it was a duty I owed to
society to set a good example, by bringing my property into a
high state of cultivation.</p>

<p>I intended to "make the barren desert smile"--to embower my
dwelling in the midst of blossoming peas, and aspiring kidney
beans, --to draw around me, as it were, a little luxuriant Eden,
which should be the admiration of a Sunday public, as they stood
riveted at the palings, unable to pass by without a lengthened
survey; whilst the envied possessor, stooping behind his
magnificent cabbages, would listen to their unstudied bursts of
rapture with justifiable pride. Glowing with horticultural
fervour, I rose early in the morning, and dug up the soil with
stern resolution, toiling with a Patagonian pick-axe at the great
roots which ran in every direction, until I thought myself a
perfect pattern of a settler. My man also exerted himself with
equal energy and more steady endurance; and in process of time a
considerable portion of ground was got ready for seed. In order
that nothing might be wanting to insure the most unlimited
success, I purchased a quantity of manure, and had it drawn upon
the ground. Then it was that the Evil Genius who (like the wicked
Enchanter that always kept his eye upon Don Quixote,) hath ever
dogged my steps, made his baleful presence manifest by the most
rampant hostility. The day on which the manure arrived, I went
out in my pleasure-boat upon Melville Water, accompanied by my
man Hannibal, to manage the head-sheets. On our return, at dusk,
we found the manure scattered all over the premises, as if it had
been kicked about by a party of dancing demons.</p>

<p>The traces of talons were clearly discernible on the ground. I
knew not what to make of it. I thought a dragon must have been
rampaging about the premises. Well! the next day the man
scratched the manure together again as well as he could, and we
sowed a quantity of seed --peas, beans, and divers succulent
vegetables. The following morning Hannibal rose late, having
overslept himself, as he alleged. I was awakened by his sudden
appearance at my bed-side, but no sooner sat up than I fell back
again, appalled by the ghastliness of his visage.</p>

<p>"The d--ls," said he, "have been again, and have scrat up the
earth far and wide; and (he added using a strong expression,)
I'll be dashed if there's a seed left!"</p>

<p>Alas! "'twas but owre true." The ground so neatly raked the
evening before, which I had returned again and again to look at
with fond pride, until it was obscured by darkness, was now torn
up and defaced throughout its length and breadth.</p>

<p>"Well!" I exclaimed, as soon as I could speak, "there are
dragons in the world."</p>

<p>I could now enter into the feelings of the poor husbandman of
the dark ages, when he got up in the morning, and found a dragon
finishing the last of his highly-prized dairy cows. If I could
only catch him at it! I felt immediately a fit of
blood-thirstiness creep over me. I could have destroyed a dozen
dragons with pleasure, might I only come within reach of them.
Calmly, however, I ordered Hannibal to sow the seeds again, and
keep better watch and ward in future.</p>

<p>It now became a serious question how my property was to be
protected. Am I to be subject to these incursions without
defence? Is there no safeguard in this country for a man's
possessions?</p>

<p>I finished breakfast hastily, and went to consult the chief
magistrate. To my question as to how I ought to guard my garden
and vegetables from the attacks of the insidious enemy, he
replied by referring me to the 2 Wm. IV. No. 2, a local act, by
which people whose property is trespassed upon, are allowed the
privilege of impounding the trespassers.</p>

<p>Impound a dragon! I thanked the worthy magistrate, "But," said
I, "the creatures that destroy my substance have wings, and are
not to be caught by men who have none."</p>

<p>"The law," replied his worship, "is decisive on the subject;
you must follow the law, whether you be able to follow the
offender or not."</p>

<p>"But," said I again, "if the law gives me no protection--and
merely to authorize me to impound a creature with wings, is a
mockery unworthy of the dignity of the law--I may surely protect
myself? I will have a file of men on guard, and fire on any
creature that infringes upon the vested rights which I possess in
my property. I will defend myself," said I, growing warm under
the oppressive weight of the law, "and maintain my vested
rights."</p>

<p>"No man," replied the worshipful justice, "as you know very
well, has a right to defend himself, except with the weapons of
the law. You will only get into scrapes if you fight with any
other weapons."</p>

<p>Finding that I was kicking against the pricks, I made my bow,
and went home again in a very ireful mood.</p>

<p>Hannibal had resown the beds, and was at work upon others. On
seeing me, he stepped up to a fine Nuytsia floribunda, which
ornaments my grounds, and taking up a double-barrelled gun that
was leaning against it, gave a few significant slaps upon the
breach, and smiling complacently, winked his eye. I turned away
and entered the house, filled with a kind of grim satisfaction,
as thoughts of vengeance flitted through my brain. Too much
disturbed to sit still, I paced up and down the room, listening
eagerly for sounds which should announce the hour of slaughter
and revenge.</p>

<p>The milk of human kindness had curdled in my breast; I felt
that I could sympathize with the restless anxiety of Charles IX
on the memorable eve of St. Bartholomew. But the butchery of
unarmed Huguenots was a different affair altogether from a war of
extermination against invading dragons. I looked out of the
windows every moment to see what Hannibal was about; but there he
continued hoeing, and weeding, and raking, and looking as calm
and amiable as the Duke when he awaited the proper moment to
attack the French. Suddenly he paused; I watched him quietly drop
his rake, and retire backwards behind a bush, where he remained
crouching down, with the double-barrelled gun in his hands.</p>

<p>Unable to remain quiet any longer, I opened the window, and
cried in a fierce whisper, "Kill! kill!" With his hand he
motioned me to be quiet, so I withdrew and paced about the room
with feverish anxiety. The discharge of both barrels made me drop
into a chair. Murder had been committed! Vengeance was satisfied,
and remorse arrived as usual. Remorse, the ill-favoured offspring
of Fear!</p>

<p>"You will get yourself into scrapes," said the chief
magistrate, "if you use any other weapon than the law." I
reasoned with Conscience; I repeated the argument that I had a
right to defend my property when the law failed to afford me
protection. Dragons, said I, are 'ferae naturae'; the people of
Perth, it would seem, are in the habit of keeping them as pets,
and thus they come to be considered private property. But then,
let the people of Perth destroy their own substance, and not
mine. If they do not choose to have gardens of their own, they
have no right to prevent the growth of my radishes. Because they
do not like sack, shall we have no more cakes and ale? Because
they can exist without cauliflowers, must I renounce all hopes of
having hyssop in my pottage?</p>

<p>What! am I to rise up early in the morning and sow the seeds
of carefulness and labour, merely for the sustenance of other
people's harpies?</p>

<p>To whom am I to look for redress, when I know not to whom the
ruthless creatures belong?--Creatures that wander far and wide in
search of food; that gain their precarious subsistence by plunder
and rapine; and are intensely hostile to the labours and
improvements of civilization. No wonder the poet looked upon them
as hell-born, and called them a pest and a curse to
society:--</p>

<p>"------nec saevior ulla Pestis et ira Deuim Stygiis sese
extulit undis."</p>

<p>I had made these reflections, and received a good deal of
comfort from them, when Hannibal appeared at the door with a
pallid countenance.</p>

<p>"Two of them, Sir, are done for; one's a big un--eight pounds,
if he weighs an 'unce. He's a handsome feller, that un; black
feathers, and spurs to his heels six inches long. They'll make a
houtcry about him, I expect."</p>

<p>"What have you done with the carcases?"</p>

<p>"Dragged 'em behind the bushes. 'Tan't legal to lift the
bodies."</p>

<p>"Go on with your work, Hannibal, and don't appear at all
fluttered or discomposed. Look as if nothing had happened. If any
one calls, I am not at home."</p>

<p>An outcry was raised about the death of the dragon. He was the
favourite of a young lady who was a pet of her papa's--(next to
dragons, children are the most horrid nuisances).--An accursed
dog (the D---l take all dogs! say I,) had found the body, and
dragged it into the street, where it was recognised by the girl.
The papa, furious at the sight of the favourite's tears, roamed
and raged about the town in search of witnesses. Men of Belial
are always to be found, especially in a colony, and Hannibal was
openly accused of the murder.</p>

<p>The whole town was in a state of excitement. People seemed to
think that a blow had been struck at the very roots of civil and
religious liberty; and as every one had his favourite dragon,
every one felt alarmed for its safety so long as Hannibal
remained unpunished.</p>

<p>The ladies were especially bitter in their remarks and
innuendoes.</p>

<p>I was told by 'friends', that more than one lady had observed,
that an old bachelor like myself cared nothing about dragons, and
therefore it was just like my selfishness to seek to deprive them
of their innocent pleasures and amusements.</p>

<p>No one would listen to my plea of self-defence; no one
regarded my losses; I was not looked upon as a sufferer; and
instead of sympathy received only abuse.</p>

<p>A summons being issued against Hannibal, he appeared before
the tribunal of two of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace,
accused of a grave misdemeanour.</p>

<p>As every one knew that I was the instigator of the offence, I
magnanimously avowed the fact, and was requested to stand in the
place of Hannibal.</p>

<p>In vain, however, did I use every argument to justify the
deed. The chief magistrate reminded me that I had been fully
advised to proceed only according to law, under the Act, 2 Wm.
IV. No. 2, amended (!!) by 4 Wm. IV. No. 5; by either of which I
was fully authorized to seize and impound all trespassers--a
limit and license that included dragons.</p>

<p>My defence was allowed to be a sensible and rational one; but
the law was opposed to it, and their worships were bound by oath
to prefer the law to common sense. (I doubted myself whether
dragons came within the Law, but the Justices decided that they
were poundable animals.) This being the case, I was under the
necessity of paying the sum of ten shillings damages, and as many
more for costs and expenses incurred by the bailiff, in
travelling up and down his bailiwick in search of the body of
John Hannibal Muckthorne (whose body was all the time sitting
quietly in my kitchen)--rather than go to Fremantle gaol for a
month, and help to draw stones about the streets in a large
cart.</p>

<p>I need scarcely add, that I returned home a wiser and sadder
man. "Hannibal," said I, "the Spirit of the Age in this colony is
opposed to territorial and to social improvement. My grounds must
still remain a barren waste. Instead of embowering myself in
fertility, as I had intended; instead of creating new beauties
which should transfuse fresh charms into the minds of the
peripatetics of Perth; I must continue to live in a desert, and
shall doubtless soon subside into an ascetic recluse. Hannibal!
turn the horses into the garden, and let them trample over the
beds."</p>

<p>Thus have I reluctantly shown the reader that the dark ages
still cast their shadows over the city of Perth;--the dawn of a
high state of civilization is still wanting there, where man
continues defenceless from the ravages of noxious monsters
peculiar to an early and uncivilized era.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *The laws which colonists make for themselves are
often as absurd as any that the Imperial Parliament thinks proper
to enact for them. To this day, the only legal remedy (except an
action and a shilling damages) against the winged and long-clawed
nuisances that destroy the hopes and break the heart of the
horticulturist, is to impound them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 12.</h3>

<h4>MICHAEL BLAKE, THE IRISH SETTLER.*</h4>

<p>[footnote] *A dry and humorous old man, who I cannot help
suspecting coins a good many of his anecdotes, gave me this
account of one of the early settlers, just as I record it. The
fact of Blake's coming to this colony, solely because he had
heard there was an estate in it called Skibbereen, (after the
place of his nativity,) struck me as being something truly Irish
and original. The man's whole history is given almost in the
words of my informant, who professed to have received it pure
from the fountain-head.</p>

<p>Michael Blake was a native of Skibbereen, a well-known barony
in the "ould country." His parents lived in a hut, "quite handy"
to the road, in the midst of a bit of turf-ground where they
managed to rear their annual crops of potatoes and their sprouts
of children with as little trouble to themselves as possible.
Michael, as he said himself, was the youngest of four, but there
were five younger than he. As soon as he could walk, his mother
clothed him in an old coat of his father's, the tails of which
swept the ground far behind him, as he trotted over the
cabin-floor with a stick in his hand to wallop his favourite
companion, the long-legged and long-snouted sow, as she lay
dreaming in the door-way. His father was an upright man, and
dealt equal justice among his children, whom he 'lathered' daily
with the strictest impartiality. This was all the education they
had any reason to expect, as the priest was always in a hurry
when he called at their door, and had not time to dismount from
his pony, from whose back he bestowed his blessing upon the
tattered crowd of children as they pressed around, and gazed upon
his Reverence with their wild grey eyes and open mouths. And
their parents could not be expected to give any other education
than they had themselves received.</p>

<p>Michael grew up, therefore, as might be expected, a hungry,
dirty-faced, unbreeched, long-coated urchin. Although his parents
had done no more for him than to usher him into a life of mud and
misery, Nature had been more compassionate. She had bestowed upon
him a restless imagination, apparently for the purpose of
removing him from this scene of trouble as quickly as possible.
It led him, at an early age, to explore the passes of a
neighbouring bog, where he fell into a deep hole filled with
water, and was just on the point of escaping from the cares of
the world, when his eldest brother unfortunately came by, and
fished him out. Their father seized the opportunity, and lathered
them both.</p>

<p>Michael next travelled in a northerly direction, and reached
the high-road with another brother, who was sent out to beg. Here
they both sat upon a stone and cried for their breakfast, until a
brilliant idea occurred to Michael, which dried his tears. He
made a dirt-pie, and presented it to his brother; and they both
passed their time very pleasantly, until an English carriage
appeared coming along the road. Little Pat ran forward, begging
and praying their honours to give him a halfpenny for the love of
the Virgin, as he had been carefully instructed to do by his dear
mother, whilst his father took measures to impress the lesson
upon his mind and person. Michael, on his part, made a vigorous
effort to cross over to the other side, crying lustily, "Please
Sir, a halfpenny!" but his mother, in order to give him a good
appearance in front, had buttoned the old coat wrong side before,
and poor Mike, in his haste and hurry, happening to put one of
his little feet into the remains of a pocket, unhappily tripped
himself up, and rolled before the horses' feet. The post-boy
cleverly turned them aside as quickly as possible, but nothing
could prevent the hind-wheel of the carriage from grazing one of
Michael's shins, and making him squall out in the most dreadful
manner.</p>

<p>A young lady and gentleman descended from the carriage, and
showed the greatest compassion for the sufferer, whom they caused
to be carried by a servant to his father's hovel, whither they
accompanied him, and soon relieved the anxieties of his parents
by a present of five golden guineas.</p>

<p>Some years elapsed, and things went on in the old way with the
Blake family. Mike had sprouted out into a fine gossoon of a boy,
and exercised his errant disposition by running after the
gentlemen when they went out shooting, and helping the keepers to
carry the game. One day, a gentleman who was shooting in the
neighbourhood called at his father's cabin, and asked for the
little boy whom he had run over in his carriage some seven years
before. Mr. Blake, senior, after blessing his honour for his
goodness, and wishing him long life and every earthly happiness
called to the young spalpeen to get out of that; and why was he
not for coming when the gentleman was spaking to him? Mr. Blake
hinted to his visitors that he should correct the manners of the
youth at an early opportunity, and in the meantime Mike slyly
approached with a gun that he was carrying for the keeper in his
hands, and received the compliments of the gentleman on his good
looks.</p>

<p>The end of it was that the gentleman, who was an officer, took
Mike into his service; and in process of time, when he joined his
regiment, Michael became his constant attendant. Dying, however,
unexpectedly, as most people do, the worthy Mr. Blake, junior,
was left to his own resources; and finding nothing better to do,
he accepted a shilling from a friendly serjeant, and entered Her
Majesty's service as a full private.</p>

<p>In process of time he married a wife--a real jewel, from that
"gem of the sea" so dear to poor old England--and accompanied his
regiment to Van Dieman's Land, en route to India. He was well
known and liked by the officers, having a peculiar talent for
blarney; and nothing pleased him so much as a little conversation
with a superior.</p>

<p>The regiment remained seven years in Van Dieman's Land, and
then passed on to its destination, leaving a number of men, who
had received their discharge, to become settlers in the colony.
Among these was Mr. Michael Blake, who soon established himself
on a block of land, and became a prosperous colonist. But times
grew bad, ere he could retire with a fortune. His wife formed
undesirable acquaintances, and Michael endeavoured to reclaim her
by wholesome correction; but, unhappily, he bestowed so much
attention upon her amendment that he entirely neglected himself,
and before he was aware that he was falling into error, had
become an habitual drunkard.</p>

<p>Everything now went wrong. Mike, hating himself, began to hate
everything about him; he hated the colony; he hated the
magistrates, who now and then imposed a penalty upon him; he
hated the laws, and discovered the difference between law and
justice, without being able to find any traces of the latter. His
fences fell into decay; his pigs and cattle committed trespasses,
and the neighbours made him pay damages. It was the fault of the
law, or rather of the lawyers, whom he condemned to the flames
with dreadful imprecations.</p>

<p>Unable to pay the storekeeper for sugar and tea, judgment was
given against him, and his last surviving cow was seized by the
sheriff. He had the satisfaction of beating the officer nearly to
death; but the cow was sold notwithstanding, and he took a
month's exercise on the treadmill, whilst his wife spent the time
with her friend the excise-officer, and drank to his better
health and general improvement.</p>

<p>On being released, he complained to the Governor, and
presented petitions to the Legislative Council against the unjust
judges who ruled the land, and crushed the hearts out of the
people.</p>

<p>Soon, however, softer feelings came over him; thoughts
returned of home, so long forgotten in days of prosperity. He
wondered whether his parents were alive, whom, forty years ago,
he had left in the barony of Skibbereen, and had not heard of
since.</p>

<p>He thought of the home of his boyhood; of the antiquated cabin
in which, at the will of his father, he had so often "eaten
stick;" of the long-legged and long-snouted sow, that used to
grunt uneasily in her dreams before the fire; of the potatoes and
salt for breakfast and dinner, of which he never got enough; of
the puddle before the door, in which he used to love to
dabble--all these visions of the past came back upon him now in
the time of his sorrows, and filled him with a craving for the
scenes of his youth.</p>

<p>Every one in trouble goes to the Governor, who has
consequently plenty of morning-callers. A few words of sympathy
from his Excellency are very consoling, and serve the afflicted
for a topic of conversation for some time to come. "His
Excellency, the last time I saw him, desired me to write to my
friends." "His Excellency particularly wishes me to make it up
with Smith, or I'd never have forgiven him for seizing my cow."
"His Excellency swears that he can't spare me from the colony, or
nothing should make me stay another day in it," etc. etc.</p>

<p>Mike presented himself at the government-offices, and after
waiting a couple of hours, caught sight of the Governor as he was
passing out through the ante-room.</p>

<p>"God bless your Honour, it's bould I am to be stopping your
Honour and Excellency this way, and you going out too with the
business of the Nation upon your Honour's shoulders."</p>

<p>"What do you want, my good friend, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"It's your Honour and Excellency that's the good friend to me
and the poor, and many's the prayer that's offered up night and
morning for your Excellency, by them that blesses the Good God
and the Virgin for having sent your Honour to reign over
us."--</p>

<p>"What is it, Mike, what is it? I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"And is it me that's hindering your Honour? sure and I'll walk
wid ye to the world's end and talk all the same. Och, and it's
the bad times that have come upon us all entirely--and the ould
settlers feels it the most, as is likely. Faith and we'd all die
off, out and out, if it wasn't for your Excellency thinking of
us, and schaming to do us the good turn, when the Council (bad
luck to 'em!) raises the duties."</p>

<p>"My horse is waiting; I really cannot stay."</p>

<p>"Arrah, and it's a fine baste that same, and the two of you
looks well together, with the white cockatoo feathers, and the
sword all gould and diamonds."</p>

<p>Here his Excellency showed signs of mounting his horse, so
Mike hastened to whisper confidentially,</p>

<p>"Governor, dear, my heart's broken entirely for the ould
country, and the poor father and mother that's looking out for me
night and morning these forty years, to give me their blessing;
and the woman at home, the crathur, kills me day-by-day with her
going on; and I'd like to see ould Ireland once before I die, and
Skibbereen, which your Honour knows is the finest place under God
Almighty's blessed canopy, and I can't die in pace till I see
it--'deed I can't, Governor dear; and ther's a Man-of-war, no
less than the Shannon herself, going to sail for the Indies,
where I'd get passed on by Colonel Maxwell (God bless him for the
rale gintleman!) only, Governor dear, spake the good word for me
to Captain Widdicombe, and I'll be took to Calcutty free for
nothing; and it's not a tinpenny-piece that I have in the world,
the blessed Virgin pity me!" --Here his Excellency, being mounted
on horseback, felt himself in more independent circumstances, and
told Mike that he must not think of leaving the colony without
his wife, as it would be most improper conduct (the Government
would have to support her), and that he himself had no interest
with Captain Widdicombe--His Excellency's charger, being of an
impatient temper, allowed no further time for parley, but
cantered off with his rider, leaving Mike rather at fault.</p>

<p>The more numerous the difficulties that appeared in the way of
Mike's return to Skibbereen, the more yearning became his desire
to lay his bones there. Every day he appeared at the
Government-offices, and waylaid the Colonial-secretary, or the
Attorney-General, or some other of the officials, entreating them
to obtain a free passage for an old soldier, whose only desire on
earth was to die among the bogs of Skibbereen.</p>

<p>He talked incessantly of that beautiful spot, and swore that
he loved it better than the Garden of Eden. He pined after
Skibbereen as the melancholy pelican pines for his desert home;
but hope gradually seemed to leave him--all other friends had
long since abandoned him, and he had fallen helplessly into the
power of his arch-enemy the Rum-bottle, when a fellow-countryman
arrived at Hobart Town from Western Australia. Mr. Denis Maguire
listened patiently to Mike's pathetic lamentation over the lost
Skibbereen, and then calmly replied, "Och, but it's little that
I'd disthract myself for a place like that in the ould country;
sure isn't there Skibbereen near the Swan River, belonging to Mr.
O'Driscoll, and isn't it a beautifuller place entirely than any
other Skibbereen in the world?" "What!" interrupted Mike, "is
there Skibbereen at the Swan River, and is it Mr. O'Driscoll
that's living there? Arrah! say that again, my darling, if you
plaze." Maguire repeated the statement; on which Mike, starting
up, began to dance an Irish hornpipe; and then, stopping short of
a sudden swore that he was the happiest boy alive, and thanked
the blessed Saints for all their goodness to him.</p>

<p>The next day he managed to sell all the remains of his
property, and made a bargain with the owner of a small
coasting-vessel to convey him and his wife (whom he was compelled
to take with him) to Swan River, where he arrived in due course
of time, and managed to locate himself at Skibbereen, where he
built a hut, cultivated several acres of land, and became quite a
reformed character.</p>

<p>Although his landlord, Mr. O'Driscoll, was his countryman,
Mike managed to blarney him so that he did just what he liked,
and never paid any rent either in cash or in kind. His yearning
desire had been to live at Skibbereen, and now that he had
attained his object he was (wonderful to say) contented and
happy.</p>

<p>He frequently came to Perth for the sake of a little chat with
the storekeepers and the gentry, and as he was sure to blarney
some one into giving him a dinner, he always returned home light
of heart and unimpaired in pocket. But alas! poor Mike was not
destined to die in peace at Skibbereen. A large party of the
natives had suddenly attacked the abode of a neighbouring
settler, and put the owner to death. Michael Blake and two of his
friends, without waiting for other assistance, hastened to the
rescue, imperfectly armed. They were overpowered in an instant.
Blake and one of his companions fell pierced with many spears,
whilst the other, being on horseback, escaped, carrying with him
four spears fixed in his body. Years afterwards, one of the
natives who had assisted at the slaughter coolly related the
particulars of the death of Michael Blake.</p>

<p>When he was lying on the ground, said this man, he turned
round, and supporting himself on his arm, entreated for mercy in
the most moving terms. The savages stood round him, looking on,
and listening patiently to his address.</p>

<p>"Did you show him mercy?" asked my informant.</p>

<p>"No!" replied the savage, with calm indifference.</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"We cut his tongue out."</p>

<p>"Wretch! what for?"</p>

<p>"He wongee (chattered) too much."</p>

<p>Poor Mike! his blarney could not save him; it had often before
done him good service, but the savages valued it not.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 13.</h3>

<h4>WILD CATTLE HUNTING.</h4>

<p>Having received intelligence that a numerous herd of wild
cattle had lately been seen grazing upon some extensive plains a
day's journey south of Perth, I got up a party with the intention
of hunting them.</p>

<p>Our preparations were made the day before starting on the
expedition. A bullock-cart was loaded with fire-arms, kegs of
brandy, various kinds of provisions, and cloaks and blankets. A
couple of natives had been engaged to act as guides, and these,
with their wives and families, spent the greater part of the day
lounging about my premises, idly inspecting the arrangements, and
sleeping in the sunshine, lazy as the pigs, which they surpassed
in filth. In the afternoon, taking with them a supply of flour,
they commenced their journey, intending to sleep upon the road,
and leave us to overtake them on the following day.</p>

<p>At day-break the next morning we were in our saddles, the
bullock-cart having started during the night. The party consisted
of three, who were all clad in blue hunting-shirts, and had
polished horns hanging at their backs, filled with eau-de-vie,
wine and water, or the simple fluid, according to the taste of
the wearer. As we passed down the silent street at that early
hour, one of the party, an officer, agreeably dispelled the
slumbers of the peaceful inhabitants by a most able performance
upon a key-bugle; the others gave vent to the exuberance of their
spirits by loud "tally-ho's!" and cries of "hark away!" and other
encouraging expressions addressed to imaginary dogs. Then we gave
our able steeds the head, and dashed along with all those happy
and exulting thoughts which bubble in the breast of youth
hurrying to the chase. Is there any moment in life so dear to
memory as those we have passed on horseback, in the fine air of
morning, when we hurried along towards the haunt of cunning
Reynard, and expected every instant to see him break cover? Less
exciting by far is hunting in Australia, but still it is hunting,
and we are on horseback, and eager as ever for a gallop. Passing
over two well-built wooden bridges, connected by a causeway, we
crossed the river, and took the road for the Canning.</p>

<p>Thick woods of banksia, wattle, and eucalypti, closed in the
view on every side; but occasionally we ascended a gentle slope,
and then looking back we could see a beautiful picture before us.
In the still air and misty light of the morning, Perth water lay
clear and tranquil amidst the vast forest by which it is
surrounded. The heights of Mount Eliza looked down into the
glittering mirror. On the right bank were the white houses of the
capital; far to the left we caught glimpses of Melville water.
Except the occasional flights of wild ducks, and the dark gusts
which from time to time swept along the waters, heralding the
rising land-wind, all was still and breathless. One could not
help asking oneself how long this scene had existed as we now
beheld it? Was it designed for thousands of years to be viewed
only by savages, mindless as the birds or fishes that frequented
its waters? Had it always existed thus, or been growing during
centuries under the hand of Nature, until it should be adapted to
the habitation of civilized man? And was that period now arrived,
or were we premature in seizing upon our inheritance before it
was thoroughly prepared for our reception? Many times have we
asked ourselves this last question. This singular country appears
to represent the ancient character of the earth in one of the
earlier stages of formation. It represents that epoch when animal
life was first developed in the lowest order of quadrupeds.</p>

<p>There are a few small exceptions, but it may be laid down as a
general rule, that all the animals indigenous to this country are
marsupial--from the kangaroo, the largest down to the little
field-mouse.</p>

<p>The animals not indigenous are Man, the wild cattle, and the
wild dogs. Many speculations have been hazarded as to the origin
of the first: to me it appears there can be little doubt that the
first tribes found their way hither from the eastern islands,
having proceeded originally from India. The language of the
natives bears more traces of the Hindu than of any other. This, I
believe, is the opinion of the Rev. J. Mitchell, M.A., of the
Middle Swan, whose long residence in India, and intimate
acquaintance with some of the languages of that country, give
weight to his conjectures. Many of the words used by the natives
of both countries are identical in sound, and express the same
meaning.</p>

<p>I have also noticed that the Coolies of India and the natives
of this colony manage to understand one another much sooner than
is the case between the latter and the whites.</p>

<p>The wild cattle have long existed in the interior, as appears
from their remains. Both they and the wild dog have probably
descended from animals cast ashore by shipwreck. The indigenous
tribes are those of the kangaroo, the opossum, and the lizard. It
is curious to observe how the distinguishing features of the
first are manifested in a great variety of animals, of all sizes
from the kangaroo downwards--the long hind, and short fore legs,
the three toes on the former, the rat-like-head, the warm pouch,
betokening the immature parturition. The opossums also are
marsupial. All these animals seem to belong to an early age of
the geological world. Many of the plants speak the same
language--especially the Zamia. The rocks, too, of this portion
of New Holland are all primary, except the limestone and
sandstone near the coast. Is this country, then, a portion of the
world that has remained in the same state for thousands, or
hundreds of thousands, of years; or is it of comparatively recent
formation, exhibiting that condition which at one period belonged
to the whole surface of the earth? The latter, of course, must be
the case; and if so, we cannot help thinking that further changes
must take place in its geological character before it shall be
permanently occupied by civilized man. At present, however, it
must be admitted there is no sign of volcanic action going on to
effect these changes. Our conjectures are purely speculative, and
will probably meet with no sympathy from the reader, but we throw
them out because the subject is full of wonder and mystery; and
those who have brought personal observation to bear upon it, best
know it to be so. As we wander through the lacustrine valleys
which abound here; valleys once the beds of rivers, but now broad
swamps choked up with lofty reeds--we feel as though we were in
the land and the age of the Saurians.</p>

<p>The whole country swarms with lizards, some of which, to the
northward, grow to the size of five feet; but the most common are
the 'Iguana', or 'Guana', a creature some ten or twelve inches
long, with a flat head, very wide mouth, and only the stump of a
tail. they are perfectly harmless, and subsist upon frogs and
insects. One variety of this species, found in the district of
King George's Sound, was brought to my notice by my brother. It
is usually found in a tuft of grass, where it lies completely
hidden except its tongue, which is thrust upwards, and bears an
exact resemblance to the petal of a flower, crimson and pink.
Flies seem to delight in resting upon this deceptive flower,
which being covered with an adhesive mucous substance, takes them
prisoner, and proves their destruction.</p>

<p>We have now had a long canter, which has brought us to the
neighbourhood of the Canning River. The country hereabouts
resembles a wild English park. The trees are all of the eucalypti
species, large and dispersed; the surface of the ground is level,
affording a view of the Darling Hills, which appear to be close
at hand. Crossing the river by a rustic bridge, we ascended the
opposite bank, whilst our trumpeter blew a charge that was
intended to announce our approach at a farm-house close at hand.
As we rode up to the door, the proprietor, attended by three
stalwart sons, hastened to greet us. He was a gentleman who had
passed a good portion of his life on the Continent, but having a
large family to bring up had resolved to seek his fortune in the
Southern hemisphere. Breakfast was already set out for us in a
large room which served as the baronial hall of the mansion;
whilst our horses, partaking of the prodigal hospitality of the
farmer colonist, were tethered in various parts of a fine field
of clover.</p>

<p>Breakfast is a famous meal after an early morning ride, and
people have then not only good appetites but good spirits.
Half-a-dozen kangaroo-dogs, attracted by the clatter of knives
and the tempting savour that arose from the large dish of sheep's
fry, crowded round the open door, whilst they seemed to feel
keenly the selfishness of those who appropriated the whole of the
feast to themselves. Every now and then arose a howl of anguish
from the group, as one of the young men would arrive with fresh
supplies of coffee or fried bacon, and kicked a clear passage for
himself into the room. One only of the canine race was allowed to
approach the table--the venerable Tip, who having formerly, in
times of scarcity, earned his master five pounds a-week by
catching kangaroos for the market of Fremantle, was now entitled
to sit at his right hand, where a few morsels were occasionally
bestowed upon him, which he received with becoming gravity and
decorum.</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, we saddled our horses and proceeded on our
way, accompanied by one of the sons of our host. We pushed along
towards the foot of the hills, over a sandy country covered with
scrub, and trees of various magnitudes.</p>

<p>The birds that we saw were chiefly fly-catchers and
parroquets; and occasionally the wild turkey, or bustard sailing
along in the distance, made us sigh for a nearer
acquaintance.</p>

<p>After a cheerful ride of several hours, having the hills on
our left hand, we crossed a few small plains; and understanding
from our guide, Tom H-----, that we were now at our destination,
we began to look about us for our bullock-cart, whose track we
had noticed from time to time as we came along. Our "cooeys" were
answered by voices not far distant; and following the sound, we
soon came within view of a column of smoke curling lightly above
the trees; and on arriving at the spot whence it arose, we found
our man, assisted by the natives, busily engaged in erecting a
kind of hut, or rather skreen of boughs, for our night quarters.
The bullocks were feeding quietly at a short distance; the cart
was conveniently placed for being unpacked; and a group of three
native women and their children, squatted round a fire of their
own, about a hundred yards from ours, and busily occupied in
baking flour-dampers, signalled our approach by shrill cries of
welcome without rising from their places.</p>

<center><b>Sketch of "The Bivouac"</b></center>

<br>
<br>


<p> </p>

<p>Our horses were soon relieved of their saddles, and each man
leading his own steed by the long tether-rope which had been
carefully coiled round its neck, took it to a neighbouring pool
to drink, and then proceeded in search of the best pasture. Our
animals having been attended to, our next thought was of
ourselves; and every one took his bundle of blankets and cloaks
out of the cart, and unrolled it beneath the sloping skreen of
boughs, and prepared his bed according to his particular taste or
experience; testing the accommodation from time to time by
flinging himself upon his couch, and ascertaining the different
vents by which the wind would be likely to prove annoying during
the night. These were next stopped up by handfuls of xanthorea
leaves, or by strips of bark from the paper-tree.</p>

<p>The lodging being pronounced perfect, and the sun being level
with the horizon, we hastened the preparation for our meal; and
hampers and boxes soon gave forth their stores of cold fowls,
tongues, hams, and meat-pies. Sausages are excellent things in
bush-campaigns; and as every man toasts his own on the point of a
long stick, a high degree of nervous excitement is felt by each,
lest he should lose his savoury morsel in the fire.</p>

<p>The kettle soon boiled, and as we ate our tea-dinner, the sun
went down, and night quickly swallowed up the short twilight,
leaving us to depend entirely on our fire, which presented a
goodly pile that shot forth cheerful flames, making the scenery
around us bright with light. The ground for the space of many
yards glittered beneath the flickering rays; the bowls of the
tall trees seemed whiter than usual; even the brown cheeks of the
natives looked less dark, as they chattered and laughed over
their supper. Cold grog, or hot brandy-and-water, was leisurely
sipped by those who lay on their couches in the full tranquillity
of after-dinner ease; and as digestion proceeded, songs and
catches awakened the echoes of the woods.</p>

<p>Tired at last, we sank to sleep, having first, however,
visited our horses and changed their tether. During the night I
woke up. All around were fast asleep in different postures; some
rolling about uneasily in their dreams; others still as the dead.
I heaped fresh logs upon the fire, which blazed forth anew. The
natives were all huddled under their wigwams, which are about the
size and shape of an open umbrella resting on its edge. The night
was dark throughout the forest, and overhead; the little circle
of light within which I stood, seemed like a magician's ring,
sacred and safe from evil spirits that filled the air around. It
was as the speck of Time amid the ocean of Eternity--as Hope,
bright and solitary in the midst of unfathomable darkness. There
I felt safe and secure--but without --who might tell what spirits
roamed abroad, melancholy and malignant? Peering into that dark
boundary of forest, the eye vainly endeavoured to pierce the
gloom. Fancy peopled its confines with flitting shapes, and
beheld a grinning hobgoblin in the grotesque stump of many a
half-burnt tree, on which the light momentarily flickered. The
ear listened eagerly for sounds in the distant solitude; and one
almost expected to hear shrieks of laughter or of terror borne
upon the night-wind from the recesses of the hills. Evil spirits
seem peculiarly the companions of heathen savages. A wild,
desert, and desolate region, traversed only in the day-time, and
rarely even then, by straggling barbarians whose hearts have
never known a single gentle emotion, seems naturally to be the
haunt of the Spirits of Evil.</p>

<p>Chingi, the terror of our natives, is often seen by them, as
they lie cowering under their kangaroo skins, and huddled
together in the extremity of fear, stalking giant-like and gloomy
along the summits of the hills, whilst the moon shrinks timidly
behind her curtain of clouds.</p>

<p>On that night, however, there was no moon, and Chingi was not
visible to me, nor did any sound break in upon the silence of the
forest, save that of our horses eating their food, and giving an
occasional snort as the sand affected their nostrils. Anxious to
behold any spirits that might please to be visible, I walked to
the spot occupied by my quadruped, with the intention of changing
his quarters; but finding him comfortably stretched in repose, I
left him to dream of his own distant manger and two quarterns of
oats, and returned to my couch. The appearance of the bivouac, to
one viewing it from the surrounding darkness, was very
picturesque. Every object was lighted up by the cheerful
blaze--the cart with its packages in or about it, the sleepers in
their blue or red woollen shirts, under the sloping roof, their
guns leaning against the uprights, their shot-belts and pouches
hanging in front--the kangaroo-dogs lying round the fire, and as
near to it as possible--the surrounding trees and shrubs
glittering with a silvery light, their evergreen foliage rustling
at the breath of the soft land-breeze--altogether formed a
striking and peculiar scene.</p>

<p>Next morning we were up before the sun, and having
breakfasted, proceeded on horseback in search of the herd of wild
cattle, which we knew, from the reports of natives, to be
somewhere in the neighbourhood. We rode down an extensive plain,
covered plentifully with grass, and presenting numerous clumps of
trees, which afforded shelter to bronze-winged pigeons and
immense flights of white cockatoos. The latter screamed fearfully
as we drew nigh, but did not remain long enough to allow us the
chance of a shot. Many tracks of the cattle were visible,
traversing these plains in every direction; but on reaching a
small pool, we found such recent traces as led us to believe the
animals could not be far distant. Remaining stationary for a few
moments, we allowed the two natives who accompanied us to
ascertain the direction in which the herd had wandered, and their
signs soon led us to follow in profound silence. The natives
walked rapidly ahead; the tracks were very apparent, and we were
all in high glee, and growing extremely excited. The sun shone
brightly, but as it was in the month of May, the air was mild and
pleasant, without being hot. After proceeding along the plains
for several miles we came to a thick jungle, through which the
cattle had formed a path. The interior presented a rocky area of
considerable extent. Fragments of rock lay jostled together,
among which trees and shrubs appeared, and here and there an open
space afforded room for the herbage which had tempted the cattle
into this rough scene. In parts where grass refused to grow,
beautiful purple flowers raised their heads in clusters--and ever
in the most rugged and barren spots the gayest flowers are found
to bloom. How grateful do we feel to Nature for bestowing such
charms upon the wild desert! cheering our spirits with a sense of
the beautiful, that else would droop and despond as we journeyed
through the lone and dreary waste.</p>

<p>Although we sometimes proceeded over a surface of bare rock,
and at others over large and loose stones, where no foot-print
was visible to the eye of a white man, the natives never failed
to discover the traces which they sought with unerring sagacity.
After a ride of nearly two hours we observed one of the natives
making signs to us to halt. "There they are!" passed in eager
whispers from one to the other. Before us was a belt of wood,
through which we could perceive about a dozen cattle grazing on a
broad plain.</p>

<p>Already they had a suspicion of danger, and began to look
around them. One of the natives, with my double-barrelled gun
loaded with heavy ball was creeping toward them through the grass
upon his hands and knees, whilst we cautiously drew up at the
side of the wood.</p>

<p>The herd consisted of a huge mouse-coloured bull, with an
enormous hunch on his shoulders, and about a dozen cows, with a
few calves. The bull came slowly towards us, muttering low
bellows, and shaking his fierce head and ponderous neck, on which
grew a short, black mane. From some unexplained cause or other
the native fired his gun before the animal was within range, and
the bull, being a beast of discretion, stopped short, as though
extremely surprised, and after a little hesitation, turned round
and rejoined his female friends. The whole herd then began to
trot off at a slow pace across the plain, which was thereabout a
mile broad. We were now all eagerness for the pursuit; and Tom
H-----, the most experienced of the party, calling on us to
follow him, dashed off at right angles from the herd, and outside
the belt of wood, in the belief that he would be able to head the
animals by a little manoeuvring; but at the instant he started
the old bull turned short on his course, and made across the
plain in a new direction. I happened to be the last of our party,
and was the only one who perceived this new disposition of the
enemy. Anxious to be the first in the melee, I allowed my friends
to gallop off, and dashed myself through the wood directly in
pursuit of the herd. Thinking there was no time to lose, I waited
not for my gun, but resolved to trust to the pistols in my
holsters.</p>

<p>The cattle, who had begun their retreat at a steady trot,
increased their speed as they saw me gallopping up to them. I was
afraid of their crossing the plain, and escaping in the thick
forest beyond, and so pushed my good horse to his utmost speed.
He seemed to be as much excited as myself, and in a few minutes I
headed the herd, and tried to turn them back; but they would not
deviate from their course, and would have rushed through a
regiment of foot, had it been in their way: I therefore avoided
the old bull, who came charging along at the head of the phalanx,
and found myself in the midst of the herd. It was a moment of
delightful excitement; some skill was required to avoid the
hurtling forest of horns, but I turned round and gallopped with
the mass; and having perfect confidence in my horse and
horsemanship, I felt that I could pick out any of the animals I
pleased. My gun, however, was wanting to bring the huge bull to
his bearings. He looked so enormous as I gallopped alongside of
him, that I despaired of making any impression with a pistol, and
resolved to limit my ambition to the slaughter of one of the
cows. We were now across the plain, the bull had entered the
forest, and the others were in the act of doing the same, when I
rode against the outside cow, in the hope of turning her away
from the thick cover, and keeping her in the open plain. She
would not, however, turn aside, and I fired my first pistol at
her eye, and though I only grazed her cheek, succeeded in
separating her from her companions, and turning her up the long
plain. At this moment four kangaroo-dogs, (a cross between a
greyhound and a blood-hound, bold, powerful, and swift,) that had
followed me in the chase, but had only gallopped alongside of the
cattle, finding me seriously engaged with one of the number, made
a simultaneous dash at the unfortunate cow, and endeavoured to
impede her career by barking, and biting at her nostrils,
dew-lap, and flanks.</p>

<p>It was a fine sight to see these four noble hounds chasing
away on either side of the animal, whilst she, every now and
then, stooped low her head and made a dash at them, without
pausing in her career. Away she went at a slapping pace, keeping
me on the gallop. Fearful of hurting the dogs, I refrained from
firing for some time, but at length got a chance, and aimed a
ball behind her shoulders, but it struck her ribs, and penetrated
no deeper than the skin. Loading as I rode along, I delivered
another ball with better success, and she began to abate her
speed. The rest of the party now came up, cheering and hallooing,
but the game had dashed into a swamp in which the reeds and
shrubs were high enough to conceal horses and huntsmen;
nevertheless, we pushed through, and found her on the bank of a
muddy pool, where she stood at bay, whilst the dogs barked
cautiously before her. She was covered with sweat, blood, and
dirt, and perfectly furious; and the moment we approached she
made a rush, trampling over several of the dogs; and darting
madly against the nearest horseman, caught his charger on the
flank, and steed and rider rolled together on the ground. The
furious assailant stumbled over her prostrate foes, and was
saluted with a discharge of fire-arms, which, however, did not
prevent her from rushing against me in return for a ball in the
shoulder, but I eluded the assault, and the animal fell exhausted
to the ground.</p>

<p>All this may sound savage enough to those who read in cold
blood, but it was very exciting at the time; and MAN, when a
hunter, becomes for the moment ruthless and blood-thirsty. This
was a very severe chase; the animal had run full five miles over
a rough country at such a pace as to cover our horses with foam,
and they now stood thoroughly blown, and shaking in every
limb.</p>

<p>We returned to our home after a short rest, taking the tail
with us as a trophy. A party was despatched in the evening with
the cart, and a large portion of the carcase was brought in and
skilfully salted by the experienced hand of Tom H.</p>

<p>This evening passed away as pleasantly as the last, and as we
were all rather fatigued, we retired early, and slept until
awakened by the sun.</p>

<p>A native arrived early in the morning with the intelligence
that a herd of wild cattle was now grazing in a ravine of the
hills about four miles distant. As we could not well follow them
on horseback in that locality, we started off on foot armed with
our rifles. The morning as usual was brilliant, but not too warm,
and we walked along in high spirits. We had not proceeded far
through the woods when one of the natives, who was in advance,
stopped short on a sudden, and we all instinctively did the same.
Stealing back to us, he took my rifle out of my hands without any
ceremony, and telling us to remain perfectly still, crept slowly
forward, stooping nearly to the ground. We now perceived a small
plain about two hundred yards a-head of us, on which were six
wild turkeys leisurely feeding and walking about.</p>

<p>The native had dived among the scrub, and we lost all signs of
him. It soon, however, became evident that the turkeys suspected
danger; they erected their tall brown and grey necks, and looked
about them like alarmed sentinels. "They're off!" cried we--but
just as they were preparing to run, which they do with great
rapidity, one of them was seen to flutter his wings and tumble
over, whilst the crack of the rifle proclaimed the triumph of
Migo. We rushed through the brush-wood, elated as schoolboys who
have shot their first throstle with a horse-pistol, and found the
bustard flapping out its last breath in the hands of the native,
whose dark visage gleamed with triumphant pride.</p>

<p>Resuming our march, we passed over the side of a hill covered
with inferior Jarra trees, and soon entered the ravine in which
we expected to find the cattle. They were not visible; so we
crossed the valley, and passed up the other side for about
half-a-mile, when we entered another valley, some distance up
which we perceived a herd of cattle quietly grazing, or lying
ruminating in the confidence of perfect security. We endeavoured
to creep towards them as quietly as possible, but their senses of
smelling and hearing were so acute that they became acquainted
with their danger too soon for us, and trotted gently up the
valley before we could reach them. We now dispersed in the hope
of heading them. Attaching myself to Migo, who considered my
rifle the most likely to prove successful, as he had killed the
bustard with it, we walked for half an hour across the hill-side
without seeing anything of our game. A rifle-shot and a loud
shout prepared us for something, and in another minute we heard
the crashing of branches and the tread of feet, and soon beheld
half-a-dozen cows and two or three calves making their way up the
hill at a short distance from us.</p>

<p>"What for you no get behind tree?" said the native in an angry
whisper, and giving me a push that prevented my staring idly any
longer, and sent me into a proper position.</p>

<p>"Oh! why will they go in that direction? Why will they not
come within range? I will give everything I have on earth for one
good point-blank shot!"</p>

<p>And sure enough a bouncing bull-calf, turning aside from a
thick clump of trees, came within about a hundred yards of me
apparently wild with fright, and not knowing which way to run.
Just as he was turning off again, I fired, and he fell upon his
knees, struck in the shoulder.</p>

<p>Migo was upon him in an instant, and felled him to the earth
with a blow of his stone-hammer. I shouted the paean of victory,
and was answered by a loud "cooey" from the valley and the voice
of my friend Mr. B. calling out, "I have killed a splendid cow
and dispersed the herd. The bull and several cows are gone down
the valley towards the plains."</p>

<p>All the party, with the exception of Tom N., were soon
assembled round the body of B.'s cow, which was black and
fine-limbed. She was evidently in milk, and there was little
doubt that the calf slain by me had belonged to her.</p>

<p>Every one now asked what had become of Tom, whose assistance
was absolutely necessary in cutting up the carcases. B. had heard
his rifle down the valley, and we now began to "cooey" for him.
In a few moments we heard a faint "cooey" in reply, and started
in that direction. After walking for about ten minutes towards
the opening of the valley we heard distinctly, and at no great
distance, the bellowing of a bull. Proceeding cautiously, with
our rifles all ready, we soon arrived at the spot, and there
beheld a huge bull tearing up the ground with his feet and horns,
and bellowing in the most savage manner. A shout of joy directed
our attention among the boughs of a low banksia tree, where our
unfortunate friend Tom sat painfully perched, only just out of
reach of danger. The animal below every now and then fell upon
his knees, crushing and smashing something which we had great
difficulty in recognising as poor Tom's rifle.</p>

<p>"He is badly wounded," cried Tom, "pitch into him, and don't
be afraid!"</p>

<p>Without waiting for this exhortation, we let fly a volley,
which brought the animal down upon his knees; and after a few
staggering efforts to run at us, he sank to rise no more; whilst
his first assailant, Tom, slipped down from his perch, and limped
towards the remains of his rifle, execrating the dying bull in a
furious manner, and even venting his wrath in a kick. As Tom wore
a red shirt that only reached to his hips, he had no chance of
concealing an enormous rent in his nether garment, through which
protruded the remains of a shirt, which at the best of times was
probably far from presenting the appearance of virgin purity, but
now was stained with blood. As people in Tom's plight, when not
seriously hurt, are usually more laughed at than pitied, the
chagrin of our friend enhanced the interest with which we
listened to his story.</p>

<p>Knowing that there was no escape for the herd of cattle up the
valleys, as they terminated in steep rocks, and that therefore
they would either cross over the side of the hill, or return down
the first valley towards the plains, Tom hung back, leaving the
rest of the party to head them. After some time had elapsed, he
distinguished the bull and several cows trotting along the
hill-side; and hastening to meet them, he posted himself behind a
tree, close to which he saw they would soon pass.</p>

<p>Anxious, however, to get a view of the game, he stepped out
from his ambush just as the bull had approached within fifty
yards. Each saw the other at the same moment. The bull stopped
short, and Tom felt rather queer. He did not like to fire at the
vast head of the animal, lest the ball should glance off without
effect. The bull, instead of turning aside, began to bellow and
tear up the ground with his hoofs. The cows stood still, and
stared at Tom, who began to think the state of his affairs looked
gloomy; but he knew that his best policy was to remain
stock-still; so he looked at the bull and the cows, and the bull
and the cows looked at Tom. At length the bull had sufficiently
nerved his resolution, and began to advance, tearing up the
ground and bellowing as he came on. Tom took aim between the
shoulder-blade and the neck, and fired; the enemy staggered, and
roared with fury, rushing like a whirlwind upon Tom, who took to
his heels, and began dodging round the trees. But the bull was in
earnest; and savage with rage as a thousand lions, he tore round
the trees more quickly even than Tom, carrying his head close to
the ground, and his tail straight out behind, whilst his eyes,
Tom said, glared with such fury, that our poor friend's heart
froze up within him. Luckily he espied a banksia tree which
seemed easy to ascend; but just as he reached it the bull was
upon him. The bull roared, and Tom, roaring almost as loudly,
made a spring at the tree but slipped down again just upon the
horns of the animal. The next hoist, however, rent his garments,
and lacerated a portion of his person which he had always
considered especially sacred; but as the thrust heaved him
upwards at the same time, and gave a fresh impulse to his
agility, he succeeded in scrambling upon a bough that kept him
just out of danger. No one may describe the pangs of despair by
which he was assailed when he beheld the utter destruction of his
only rifle. He threw his cap in the face of the bull, but he only
lost his cap as well as his rifle by this rash and inconsiderate
action, which was the highest proof he could have given of the
extremity of his distress.</p>

<p>Poor Tom! he had often been made a butt of, but had never been
so butted before.</p>

<p>The cup went merrily round that evening, and many and jovial
were the songs that were sung, and witty and pleasant were the
jokes that passed freely at the expense of the unfortunate
'tauricide', who, bereft of his rifle, and dilapidated in
reputation and pantaloons, was heartily glad to be able to hide
his sorrows in sleep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 14.</h3>

<h4>WOODMAN'S POINT*</h4>

<p>[footnote] *This is a more sentimental story than that of
Michael Blake, but I owe them both to the same authority.</p>

<p>There is a pleasant ride along the shore from Fremantle to a
little bay about seven miles distant, one side of which, covered
with lofty trees, runs far into the sea, and is called Woodman's
Point. The sea in this part appears to be only a few miles broad;
Garden-island forming the opposite shore, the southern extremity
of which seems almost to join Cape Perron, and thus presents the
appearance of a vast bay. Not long ago, the blackened remains of
a small house, or hovel, were to be seen on the verge of the
wood, facing towards Cape Perron. Around it might be
distinguished the traces of a garden of considerable extent; a
few stunted vines still continued annually to put forth the
appearance of verdure, which served only to tempt the appetite of
the stray cattle that wandered down to this solitary spot. A
large bed of geraniums had extended itself across the path which
used to lead to the door of the house; and their varied and
beautiful flowers, rejoicing in this congenial climate, gave
additional melancholy to the scene. It was evident those plants
had been reared, and tended, and prized for their beauty; they
had once been carefully cultured, pruned, and watered--now they
were left to bloom or to die, as accident permitted. Near to this
bed of geraniums, but apart and solitary, untouched even by
weeds, of which there were only few in that sandy soil, grew an
English rose-tree. Its long, unpruned boughs straggled wildly on
the ground. It looked the picture of desolation and despair. A
few imperfect flowers occasionally peeped forth, but knew only a
short and precarious existence, for the shrub being no longer
sheltered behind the house, was now exposed to the daily violence
of the sea-breeze.</p>

<p>This widowed rose, deprived of the hand which had tended it so
carefully, and of the heart which its beauty had gladdened,
seemed now in its careless desolation awaiting the hour when it
should die. It really looked, with its drooping boughs, its torn
blossoms, and its brown leaves, rustling and sighing to the
breeze, like a sentient being mourning without hope. Those who
have never lived in exile from their native land, can have no
idea of the feelings with which a lonely colonist, long separated
from all the associations of home, would regard a solitary plant
which so peculiarly calls up home memories. Pardon us, good
reader, this appearance of sentiment; you who will read these
lines in Old England--that land which we must ever think of with
pardonable emotion--will evince but little sympathy with us, who
necessarily feel some fond regard for the Mother from whom we are
parted, and are naturally drawn towards the inanimate things by
which we are reminded of her. There is in this colony of western
Australia a single daisy root; and never was the most costly
hot-house plant in England so highly prized as this humble little
exile. The fortunate possessor pays it far more attention than he
bestows upon any of the gorgeous flowers that bloom about it; and
those who visit his garden of rare plants find nothing there that
fills them with so profound a feeling of interest as the meek and
lowly flower which recalls to their memories the pleasant
pastures of Old England.</p>

<p>But to return to the ruins of Woodman's Point. This plot of
land, now so neglected and forlorn, was once the blooming garden
of a very singular old man, who owed his support to the
vegetables which it produced, and to the fish that he caught from
the little cobble which danced at anchor in the bay, whenever the
weather permitted the fisherman to exercise his art. No one knew
his history, but his conversation and deportment told you that he
was of gentle birth, and had been well educated. His manners were
particularly amiable and retiring, and every one who visited the
solitary old man came away impressed with a melancholy interest
in his fate.</p>

<p>He always welcomed a visitor with gentle pleasure, and seemed
glad of the opportunity of showing his crops of vegetables and
the flowers in which he delighted.</p>

<p>The rose-tree never failed to arrest his steps for a moment.
He had brought it himself from England as a cutting, and there
was evidently some history attached to it; but he never shared
his confidence with any one; and the history of the rose-tree,
like his own, was never revealed.</p>

<p>There was only one point on which he betrayed any feeling of
pride-- and that was his name. No one else would perhaps have
been so proud of it, but he himself ever seemed to regard it with
veneration.</p>

<p>He called himself Anthony Elisha Simson; and never failed to
make you observe that his patronymic was spelt without a "p".</p>

<p>Nothing irritated him so much as to receive a note addressed,
"A. E. Simpson, Esq."</p>

<p>The Simsons, he would assure you, were an old family in the
northern counties of England, and traced back their genealogy to
the Conquest; whereas the Simpsons were of quite a different, and
doubtless inferior origin. Nothing more than this did he ever
relate concerning his family or his personal history.</p>

<p>He arrived in the colony a few years after its foundation,
without any other effects than what were contained in a
portmanteau and carpet-bag, and with only a few sovereigns in his
purse. Without associating himself with any one, he early fixed
upon the spot where he afterwards built his house, and
established his permanent abode. Here he began to make his
garden, and did not disdain to earn a few shillings occasionally
by cutting fire-wood for a man who supplied Fremantle with that
necessary article. It was this occupation that caused the
settlers, who knew nothing more of him, to give him the title of
"The Woodman"--a name which soon attached to the locality.</p>

<p>After he had been some time in the colony, Mr. Simson began to
express great impatience for the arrival of letters from England.
Whenever a vessel arrived at the port, he would put on his old
shooting-coat, and walk along the shore to Fremantle, where,
after having inquired in vain at the post-office, he would
purchase a pound of tea, and then return home again.</p>

<p>Years went by. Every time that a vessel arrived, poor Simson
would hurry to Fremantle. He would watch, with eyes of
ill-repressed eagerness, the mail carried to the post-office in
boxes and large sacks. Surely amid that multitude of letters
there must be one for him! Patiently would he wait for hours at
the window, whilst the post-master and his assistants sorted the
letters; and when he had received the usual answer to his
inquiry, he would return to his abode with down-cast looks.</p>

<p>As time passed on he grew more fretful and impatient.
Receiving no intelligence from England, he seemed to be anxious
to return thither. He would drop expressions which led his
visitors (generally government officers who called upon him in
their rides) to believe he would depart from the colony were he
rich enough to pay his passage, or were he not restrained by some
other powerful motive.</p>

<p>His mind ran altogether upon the Old Country, and it was with
reluctance that he planted the vegetables and cured the fish
which were essential to his support.</p>

<p>For many hours during the day he used to be seen standing
fixed as a sentinel on the low rock which formed the extremity of
the ridge called after himself--the Woodman's Point--and looking
homewards.</p>

<p>Doubtless, thought was busy within him--the thought of all he
had left or acted there. None had written to him; none remembered
or perhaps wished to remember him. But home was in his heart,
even whilst he felt there was no longer a home for him. A
restless anxiety preyed upon his mind, and he grew thin and
feeble; but still whenever a sail was seen coming round the north
end of Rottnest, and approaching the port, he would seize his
staff, and set out upon his long journey to Fremantle to inquire
if there were, at last, a letter awaiting him.</p>

<p>May we imagine the growing despair in the heart of this poor
old exile, as life seemed ebbing away, and yet there came no
news, no hope to him from home? Frequently he wrote himself, but
always to the same address--that of a broker, it was supposed, in
Throgmorton-street. But no answer was ever returned. Had he no
children--no friends?</p>

<p>Naturally weak-minded, he had now grown almost imbecile; but
his manners were still so gentle, and every thing about him
seemed to betoken so amiable and so resigned a spirit, that those
who visited him could scarcely part again without tears. As he
grew more feeble in body, he became more anxious to receive a
letter from home; he expected that every one who approached his
dwelling was the bearer of the intelligence so long hoped for in
vain; and he would hasten to greet him at the gate with eager
looks and flushed cheeks--again only to be disappointed.</p>

<p>At length it was with difficulty that he tottered to the
Point, to look for a vessel which might bring him news. Although
no ship had arrived since he last sent to the post-office, he
would urge his visitor, though with hesitating earnestness, to be
so good as to call there on his return, and ascertain if by
chance a letter were not awaiting him. He said he felt that his
hour was approaching, but he could not bear to think of setting
out on that long journey without having once heard from home.
Sometimes he muttered, as it were to himself, that treachery had
been practised against him, and he would go and expose it; but he
never allowed himself to indulge long in this strain. Sometimes
he would try to raise money enough by drawing bills to pay his
passage, but no one would advance anything upon them.</p>

<p>Daily he became more feeble, and men began to talk of sending
him a nurse. The last visitor who beheld him alive, found him
seated in the chair which he had himself constructed, and
appearing less depressed than usual. He said he expected soon to
receive news from home, and smiled with child-like glee. His
friend helped him to walk as far as the rose-tree, which was then
putting forth its buds. "Promise," said the old man, laying his
trembling hand upon the other's arm, "promise that when I am gone
you will come and see them in full blow? Promise! you will make
me happy."</p>

<p>The next day they sent a lad from Fremantle to attend upon
him. The boy found him seated in his chair. He was dead. A mound
of earth at the foot of a mahogany-tree, still marks the spot
where he was buried. Those 'friends' at home who neglected or
repulsed him when living, may by chance meet with this record
from the hand of a stranger--but it will not move them; nor need
it now.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 15.</h3>

<h4>HOW THE LAWS OF ENGLAND AFFECT THE NATIVES.</h4>

<p>The native population of our colony are said to be a much more
peaceable and harmless race than those of any other part of
Australia. In the early days of the settlement they caused a good
deal of trouble, and were very destructive to the pigs and sheep
of the colonists; but a little well-timed severity, and a
steadily pursued system of government, soon reduced them into
well-conducted subjects of the British Crown. There appears,
however, to be little hope of civilizing them, and teaching them
European arts and habits. Those of mature age, though indolent,
and seldom inclined to be useful in the smallest degree, are
peaceful in their habits; and when in want of a little flour will
exert themselves to earn it, by carrying letters, shooting wild
ducks with a gun lent to them, driving home cattle, or any other
easy pursuit; but they appear to be incapable of elevation above
their original condition. Considerable pains have been bestowed
(especially by the Wesleyans) upon the native children, many of
whom are educated in schools at Perth, Fremantle, and other
places, in the hope of making them eventually useful servants to
the settlers. Most of these, however, betake themselves to the
bush, and resume their hereditary pursuits, just at the age when
it is hoped they will become useful. Very frequently they die at
that age of mesenteric disorders; and very few indeed become
permanently civilized in their habits.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more anomalous and perplexing than the
position of the Aborigines as British subjects. Our brave and
conscientious Britons, whilst taking possession of their
territory, have been most careful and anxious to make it
universally known, that Australia is not a conquered country; and
successive Secretaries of State, who write to their governors in
a tone like that in which men of sour tempers address their
maladroit domestics, have repeatedly commanded that it must never
be forgotten "that our possession of this territory is based on a
right of occupancy."</p>

<p>A "right of occupancy!" Amiable sophistry! Why not say boldly
at once, the right of power? We have seized upon the country, and
shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it
expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted exactly as Julius
Caesar did when he took possession of Britain. But Caesar was not
so hypocritical as to pretend any moral right to possession. On
what grounds can we possibly claim a right to the occupancy of
the land? We are told, because civilized people are justified in
extending themselves over uncivilized countries. According to
this doctrine, were there a nation in the world superior to
ourselves in the arts of life, and of a different religious
faith, it would be equally entitled (had it the physical power)
to the possession of Old England under the "right of occupancy;"
for the sole purpose of our moral and social improvement, and to
make us participants in the supposed truths of a new creed.</p>

<p>We have a right to our Australian possessions; but it is the
right of Conquest, and we hold them with the grasp of Power.
Unless we proceed on this foundation, our conduct towards the
native population can be considered only as a monstrous
absurdity. However Secretaries of State may choose to phrase the
matter, we can have no other right of occupancy. We resolve to
found a colony in a country, the inhabitants of which are not
strong enough to prevent our so doing, though they evince their
repugnance by a thousand acts of hostility.</p>

<p>We build houses and cultivate the soil, and for our own
protection we find it necessary to declare the native population
subject to our laws.</p>

<p>This would be an easy and simple matter were it the case of
conquerors dictating to the conquered; but our Secretaries of
State, exhibiting an interesting display of conscientiousness and
timidity, shrink from the responsibility of having sanctioned a
conquest over a nation of miserable savages, protected by the
oracles at Exeter Hall, and reject with sharp cries of anger the
scurrilous imputation. Instead, therefore, of being in possession
by right of arms, we modestly appropriate the land to ourselves,
whilst making the most civil assurances that we take not this
liberty as conquerors, but merely in order to gratify a
praiseworthy desire of occupying the country. We then declare
ourselves seised in fee by right of occupancy. But now comes the
difficulty. What right have we to impose laws upon people whom we
profess not to have conquered, and who have never annexed
themselves or their country to the British Empire by any written
or even verbal treaty?</p>

<p>And if this people and country be not subject to our rule by
conquest, and have never consented or desired (but the contrary)
to accept of our code of laws, and to submit themselves to our
authority, are they really within the jurisdiction of the laws of
England--'especially for offences committed inter se?'</p>

<p>Such is the anomalous position in which the native inhabitants
are placed through the tender consciences of our rulers at home.
A member of a tribe has been speared by one of another tribe, who
happens to be patronized by a farm-settler, and is occasionally
useful in hunting-up stray cattle. The friends of the dead man
proceed to punish the assassin according to their own hereditary
laws; they surprise him suddenly, and spear him. The farmer
writes an account of the fact to the Protector of Natives at
Perth; and this energetic individual, rising hastily from dinner,
calls for his horse, and endowing himself with a blue woollen
shirt, and a pair of dragoon spurs, with a blanket tied round his
waist, fearlessly commits himself to the forest, and repairs to
the scene of slaughter.</p>

<p>He learns from the mouth of the farm-settler, that the facts
are really what he had been already apprised of by letter; and
then, having left word that the offender may be caught as soon as
possible, and forwarded to Fremantle gaol, he hastens back again
to his anxious family; and the next morning delivers a suitable
report to his Excellency the Governor of all that he has
performed. In course of time the native is apprehended--betrayed
by a friend for a pound of flour--and brought to the bar of
justice. His natural defence would be that he certainly slew an
enemy, as he is accused of having done, but then it was a
meritorious and necessary act; he glories in it; his own laws
required that he should slay the murderer of his relative; and
his own laws, therefore, accuse him not. What are English
customs, prejudices, or laws to him? He is not a British subject,
for he is not the inhabitant of a conquered country (as English
governors tell him), nor has he, or any of his tribe or
complexion, consented or wished to be placed under the protection
of our laws. Why, then, should he be violently dragged from the
arms of his 'wilgied' squaws, and his little pot-bellied
piccaninnies, and required to plead for his life in the midst of
a large room filled with frowning white faces? Much obliged is he
to the judge, who kindly tells him, through the interpreter, that
he is not bound to convict himself, and need not acknowledge
anything that may operate to his disadvantage in the minds of the
jury.</p>

<p>The unfortunate savage disregards the friendly caution, and
heeds it not; he maintains, stoutly, that he 'gidgied' Womera
through the back, because Womera had 'gidgied' Domera through the
belly. He enters into minute details to the gentlemen of the jury
of the manner in which these slaughters were effected, and
describes the extent and direction of the wounds, and every other
interesting particular that occurs to him. The gentlemen of the
jury, after duly considering the case, return (of necessity) a
verdict of "Wilful murder," and the judge pronounces sentence of
death--which is afterwards commuted by the Governor to
transportation for life to the Isle of Rottnest.</p>

<p>Now if our laws had been imposed upon this people as a
conquered nation, or if they had annexed themselves and their
country to our rule and empire by anything like a treaty, all
these proceedings would be right and proper. But as it is, we are
two nations occupying the same land, and we have no more right to
try them by our laws for offences committed 'inter se', than they
have to seize and spear an Englishman, according to their law,
because he has laid himself open to an action of 'crim. con.' at
the suit of his next-door neighbour.</p>

<p>Look at the question in another point of view. Is jurisdiction
a necessary incident of sovereignty? Do a people become subject
to our laws by the very act of planting the British standard on
the top of a hill? If so, they have been subject to them from the
days of Captain Cook; and the despatches of Her Majesty's
Secretaries of State, declaring that the natives should be
considered amenable to our laws for all offences which they might
commit among themselves, were very useless compositions. We claim
the sovereignty, yet we disclaim having obtained it by conquest;
we acknowledge that it was not by treaty; we should be very sorry
to allow that it was by fraud; and how, in the name of wonder,
then, can we defend our claim? Secretaries of State have
discovered the means, and tell us that Her Majesty's claim to
possession and sovereignty is "based on a right of occupancy."
Jurisdiction, however, is not the necessary incident of
territorial sovereignty, unless that sovereignty were acquired by
conquest or treaty. We question, indeed, whether it is the
necessary consequence even of conquest--the laws of the conqueror
must first be expressly imposed. The old Saxon laws prevailed
among the people of England after the Conquest, until the Norman
forms were expressly introduced.</p>

<p>It is well known in colonies, that the laws propounded in
certain despatches are more powerful, and more regarded and
reverenced, than any others, human or divine. A kind of moral
gun-cotton, they drive through the most stupendous difficulties,
and rend rocks that appeared to be insuperable barriers in the
eyes of common sense or common justice. Judges are compelled to
yield to their authority, and do violence to their own
consciences whilst they help to lay the healing unction to those
of their lawgivers.</p>

<p>The most convenient and the most sensible proceeding, on the
part of our rulers at home, would be to consider this country in
the light of a recent conquest. Instead of declaring, as now,
that the natives are to be treated in every way as British
subjects--thus making them amenable to the English law in all its
complexity, whilst their own laws and habits are so entirely
opposite in character--it would be better to pass a few simple
ordinances, in the nature of military law, which would be
intelligible to the natives themselves, and which would avoid the
difficulty of applying the cumbrous machinery of our criminal
code to the government of savages who can never be made to
comprehend its valuable properties. It is most essential that the
natives who commit offences against the persons or property of
the whites should be brought to punishment. At the same time it
is most difficult to establish the guilt of the party accused,
according to the strict rules of legal evidence. The only
witnesses, probably, were natives, who understand not the nature
of an oath, and who lie like the Prince of Darkness whenever they
have wit enough to perceive it is their interest to do so. In
general, the only chance of obtaining a legal conviction is
through the confession of the prisoner; and as it is most
desirable that he should be convicted, when there is no moral
doubt of his guilt, as his acquittal would be looked upon as a
triumph by his fellows, and make them more daring in their
opposition to the law, very little delicacy is used in obtaining
that confession.</p>

<p>Were the prisoner defended by counsel, who did his duty to his
client, without regard to the interests of the public, the guilty
person would escape in almost every instance. As it is, the law
is outraged, and a trial by jury made an occasion of mockery and
gross absurdity, in order to obtain a conviction which is
necessary to the welfare of the white population. Nothing would
be more easy than to legislate for the proper government of the
Aborigines; but you must begin 'de novo', and throw aside with
scorn the morbid sentimentality that refuses to look upon those
as a conquered people, whom, nevertheless, it subjects to the
heavy thraldom of laws which they are not yet fitted to
endure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 16.</h3>

<h4>REMARKS ON THE PHYSICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIVES.</h4>

<p>The native inhabitants of Western Australia are only superior
in the scale of human beings to the Bosjemans of Southern Africa.
Their intellectual capacity appears to be very small, and their
physical structure is extremely feeble. In some respects the
Australian peculiarly assimilates to two of the five varieties of
the human race. In the form of his face and the texture of his
hair he resembles the Malay; in the narrow forehead, the
prominent cheek-bones, and the knees turned in, he approaches
towards the Ethiopian.* There is a remarkable difference between
the jaws and teeth of the Australian and those of any other
existing race. The incisores are thick and round, not, as usual,
flattened into edges, but resembling truncated cones; the
cuspidati are not pointed, but broad and flat on the masticating
surface, like the neighbouring bicuspides. This may be
attributable to mechanical attrition, depending on the nature of
the food which the teeth are employed in masticating. The upper
does not overlap the under jaw, but the teeth meet at their
surfaces. This peculiarity of teeth has been noticed by
Blumenbach as a characteristic of the Egyptian mummy; but he
thinks the nature of the food not sufficient to account for it,
and imagines it to depend on a natural variety. He observes, that
"although it seemed most easy to account for this appearance by
attributing it to the nature of the food used by the Egyptians,
yet the generality of its occurrence in Egyptian mummies, and its
absence in other races, are remarkable; and it affords some
probability that the peculiarity depends upon a natural
variety."** A constant uniformity in the structure and
arrangement of the teeth is an important particular in the
identification of species; and if any human race were found to
deviate materially in its dentition from the rest of mankind, the
fact would give rise to a strong suspicion of a real specific
diversity. I have examined the teeth of infants and children, and
found them in every respect similar to those of Europeans of
similar ages. Moreover, the process of degradation may be traced
in natives of different ages up to the teeth worn to the level of
the gums in the old man. I therefore consider it the effect of
attrition; but it becomes an interesting question to determine
what may be the nature of the food which produced the same
character in the ancient Egyptian and the modern Australian. Did
the fathers of science live on barks and roots, like the wretched
Australian? Although attrition may cause this singular appearance
of the teeth, the real question is, why does the lower jaw so
perfectly and exactly meet its fellow? And is this confined to
these two examples?</p>

<p>[footnote] *The observations in this chapter were contributed
by Henry Landor, Esq., Colonial Surgeon on the Gold Coast, who
resided five years among the natives of Western Australia, and is
intimately acquainted with all their habits and
peculiarities.</p>

<p>[footnote] **In a former chapter (13.) I have expressed an
opinion that the natives are descended from the old inhabitants
of India, which I think is exceedingly probable. It is
interesting to remember, that the ancient Egyptians are supposed
to have originally come from the same country.</p>

<p>There is no fixed law determining invariably the human
stature, although there is a standard, as in other animals, from
which deviations are not very considerable in either direction.
Some varieties exceed, others fall short of, the ordinary stature
in a small degree. The source of these deviations is in the
breed; they are quite independent of external influences.</p>

<p>In all the five human varieties, some nations are conspicuous
for height and strength, others for lower stature and inferior
muscular power; but in no case is the peculiarity confined to any
particular temperature, climate, or mode of life. The
Australians, in general, are of a moderate stature, with slender
limbs, thin arms, and long taper fingers. Although in general
stature there is nothing to distinguish one variety of man from
another, yet in the comparative length of the different parts of
the human frame there are striking differences. In the highest
and most intellectual variety (the Caucasian) the arm (os humeri)
exceeds the fore-arm in length by two or three inches--in none
less than two inches. In monkeys the fore-arm and arm are of the
same length, and in some monkeys the fore-arm is the longer. In
the Negro, the 'ulna', the longest bone of the fore-arm, is
nearly of the same length as the 'os humeri', the latter being
from one to two inches longer. In a Negro in the lunatic asylum
of Liverpool (says Mr. White) the ulna was twelve and a half
inches, and the humerus only thirteen and a half. In the
Australian, the ulna in some I have measured was ten and a half,
nine, ten, eleven and a half; the humerus was in those
individuals respectively eleven and a half, ten and a half,
eleven and a half, twelve and a half. Thus, in none of the
measurements did the humerus exceed the ulna two inches, which in
the Caucasian variety is the lowest number. In all the black
races the arm is longer in proportion to the stature than in the
white. The length of the leg of the Australian averages
thirty-six inches; in one man it was only thirty-three and a
half, and the tibia of that man measured sixteen and a half,
leaving only seventeen to the femur--a very remarkable
disproportion.</p>

<p>Thus in the proportion of their limbs, the Australian ranks
far below the European; nay, even below the Negro, and approaches
far nearer to the simiae than any of the other races of mankind.
Perron, in his voyage, made an estimate of the average strength
of the arms and loins of the Australian, and of some French and
English; this is the result in French measures:--</p>

<pre>
                                  ARMS.               LOINS.
                                   Kilogrammes.        Myriagrammes.

English . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  71.4 . . . . . . . .16.3
</pre>

<p>Thus in whatever manner the capacity of the race is tested,
its inferiority is strikingly exhibited. We shall find, when
examining the skull, that the coronal suture falls on the
temporal instead of the sphenoid bone, which is one of the
strongest marks of the simiae, and does not occur in other human
skulls.</p>

<p>I have no desire to place the Australian lower in the scale of
intelligence than he is fairly entitled to rank, but I cannot
shut my eyes to facts; and if his organization is in conformity
with his inferiority, there he must rank, in spite of the wishes
of his warmest friends. At the same time I agree with the most
enthusiastic philanthropist that no attempt should be left
untried to amend his condition, and bestow upon him the blessings
which Providence has lavished upon us; but I cannot help fearing
the result will be disappointment. A fair comparative experiment
says Mr. Lawrence, has been made of the white and dark races of
North America; and no trial in natural philosophy has had a more
unequivocal result. The native races have not advanced a single
step in 300 years; neither example nor persuasion has induced
them, except in very small numbers and in few instances, to
exchange the precarious supply of hunting, and fishing for
agriculture and the arts of settled life.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin is chocolate, and resembles the Malay,
although perhaps a little darker. The colour of the skin is, of
course, greatly dependent upon the nature of the climate and the
constant exposure of the surface of the body to the sun; the
parts under the arms are of a brighter colour than those more
exposed. We find in human races, as in vegetation, that every
successive level alters its character; thus indicating that the
state of the temperature of high regions assimilates to high
latitudes. If, therefore, complexions depend upon climate and
external conditions, we should expect to find them varying in
reference to elevation of surface; and if they should be actually
found to undergo such variations, this will be a strong argument
in favour of the supposition that these external characters do in
fact depend upon local conditions. The Swiss in the high
mountains above the plains of Lombardy have sandy or brown hair.
What a contrast presents itself to the traveller in the Milanese,
where the peasants have black hair and almost Oriental features!
The Basques, of the tracts approaching the Pyrenees, says Colonel
Napier, are a strikingly different people from the inhabitants of
the low parts around, whether Spaniards or Biscayans. They are
finely made, tall men, with aquiline noses, fair complexions,
light eyes, and flaxen hair; instead of the swarthy complexion,
black hair, and dark eyes of the Castilian. And in Africa what
striking differences of complexion exist between the Negro of the
plains and of the mountains, even whilst the osteology is the
same, therefore I pass over the hair and skin of the Australian
as parts too much subjected to the influence of climate to afford
means of legitimate deduction. It is the general opinion that
these natives are not a long-lived race. The poverty of their
food may account for this, together with the want of shelter from
the vicissitudes of the climate. The care taken by civilized man
to preserve health is, by increasing susceptibility, the indirect
cause of disease; the more rigid is the observance of regimen,
the more pernicious will be the slightest aberration from it; but
a total disregard of all the comforts of regular food, and
efficient shelter, the habit of cramming the stomach when food is
plentiful, and of enduring long abstinence when it cannot be
procured, has a far more baneful effect upon the human
constitution than all the excesses of the white man. As man
recedes from one hastener of destruction, he inevitably
approaches another: "Gross riot treasures up a wealthy fund Of
plagues, but more immedicable ills Attend the lean extreme."</p>

<p>I have observed that the natives mix the gum of certain trees
with the bark, and masticate both together. This is attributed to
the difficulty of masticating the gum alone; but I am persuaded
that it has another cause also, and that it arises from that
experience of the necessity of an additional stimulus to the
digestive organ which has taught the Esquimaux and Ottomacs to
add sawdust or clay to their train-oil. It arises from the fact
that (paradoxical as it may appear) an animal may be starved by
giving it continually too simple and too nutritious food; aliment
in such a state of condensation does not impart the necessary
stimulus, which requires to be partly mechanical and partly
chemical, and to be exerted at once on the irritability of the
capillaries of the stomach to promote its secretions, and on the
muscular fibres to promote its contractions.</p>

<p>I shall now point out the difference between the Australian
skull and those of some other races, without giving a description
of skulls in general, which would unnecessarily lengthen these
observations. "Of all the peculiarities in the form of the bony
fabric, those of the skull are the most striking and
distinguishing. It is in the head that we find the varieties most
strongly characteristic of the different races. The characters of
the countenance, and the shape of the features depend chiefly on
the conformation of the bones of the head."</p>

<p>The Australian skull belongs to that variety called the
prognathous, or narrow elongated variety; yet it is not so
striking an example of this variety as the Negro skull. If the
skull be held in the hand so that the observer look upon the
vertex, the first point he remarks is the extreme narrowness of
the frontal bone, and a slight bulging where the parietal and
occipital bones unite. He also sees distinctly through the
zygomatic arches on both sides, which in the European skull is
impossible, as the lateral portions of the frontal bone are more
developed. The summit of the head rises in a longitudinal ridge
in the direction of the sagittal suture; so that from the
sagittal suture to that portion of the cranium where the diameter
is greatest the head slopes like the roof of a house. The
forehead is generally flat; the upper jaw rather prominent; the
frontal sinuses large; the occipital bone is flat, and there is a
remarkable receding of the bone from the posterior insertion of
the 'occipitofrontalis' muscle to the 'foramen magnum'. It is a
peculiar character of the Australian skull to have a very
singular depression at the junction of the nasal bones with the
nasal processes of the frontal bone. This may be seen in an
engraving in Dr. Pritchard's work. I have before described the
teeth, and mentioned the remarkable junction of the temporal and
parietal bones at the coronal suture, and consequently the
complete separation of the sphenoid from the parietal, which in
European skulls meet for the space of nearly half an inch.
Professor Owen has observed this conformation in six out of seven
skulls of young chimpanzees, and Professor Mayo has also noticed
it in the skulls he has examined. But although this is a
peculiarity found in this race alone, it is not constant. I have
a skull in which the sphenoid touches the parietal on one side,
whilst on the other they are separated a sixth of an inch; and in
the engraving, before referred to, the bones are slightly
separated, but by no means to the extent that they are in
European skulls. The super and infra orbital foramina are very
large, and the orbits are broad, with the orbital ridge sharp and
prominent. All the foramina for the transmission of the
sensiferous nerves are large, the auditory particularly so; while
the foramen, through which the carotid artery enters the skull,
is small. The mastoid processes are large, which might be
expected, as their hearing is acute. The styloid process is
small; in monkeys it is wanting. The position of the 'foramen
magnum', as in all savage tribes, is more behind the middle
transverse diameter than in Europeans; but this arises in a great
measure, though not entirely, from the prominence of the alveolar
processes of the upper jaw. Owing to constant exposure to all
seasons, the skulls of savages are of greater density, and weigh
heavier than those of Europeans:--</p>

<p>Upon an examination of the foregoing points of diversity, it
is unquestionable that the Australian skull is inferior in
development to the European, and the capacity of the cranium of
much less.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 17.</h3>

<h4>SKETCHES OF LIFE AMONG THE NATIVES.</h4>

<p>The Natives have very few traditions, and most of those which
they relate resemble the disconnected phantasies of a dream
rather than the record of a series of facts.</p>

<p>They have some indistinct ideas about Chingi, the Evil Spirit,
but no notion whatever of a Supreme God. When first the English
arrived, many of the Aborigines considered them to be the spirits
of their deceased relatives; and some of them fancied they could
trace the features of former friends in the lineaments of
individuals among the whites. One of these natives, still living,
has more than once told me that his late uncle is now a certain
eloquent and popular member of the Legislative Council. The
nephew and resuscitated uncle occasionally meet, when the former
never fails to claim the relationship, which the latter
good-humouredly acknowledges; and the relatives separate with
mutual expressions of politeness and good-will.</p>

<p>One of their most remarkable and most intelligible traditions
was recorded some time ago in the 'Perth Inquirer', by Mr.
Armstrong, Interpreter to the Natives.</p>

<p>It is as follows:-- "The natives assert that they have been
told from age to age, that when man first began to exist, there
were two beings, male and female, named Wal-lyne-up (the father)
and Doronop (the mother); that they had a son called
Biu-dir-woor, who received a deadly wound, which they carefully
endeavoured to heal, but without success; whereupon it was
declared by Wal-lyne-up, that all who came after him should also
die in like manner. Could the wound have been healed in this
case, being the first, the natives think death would have had no
power over them. The place where the scene occurred, and where
Bin-dir-woor was buried, the natives imagine to have been on the
southern plains, between Clarence and the Murray; and the
instrument used is said to have been a spear thrown by some
unknown being, and directed by some supernatural power. The
tradition goes on to state that Bin-dir-woor, the son, although
deprived of life and buried in his grave, did not remain there,
but arose and went to the west; to the unknown land of spirits
across the sea. The parents followed after their son, but (as the
natives suppose) were unable to prevail upon him to return, and
they have remained with him ever since."</p>

<p>The following is one of their fables:--The kangaroo was
originally blind, and could only walk or crawl. The frog seeing
it so much at the mercy of its enemies, took compassion on it,
and anointed the sightless eyeballs of the kangaroo with its
saliva, and told it to hop as he did. The kangaroo did so, and is
now become the most difficult animal in the world to catch.</p>

<p>Besides Chingi, the evil spirit who haunts the woods, there is
another in the shape of an immense serpent, called Waugul, that
inhabits solitary pools. Snakes that frequent both water and
land, of great size--twenty feet long, according to some
authorities-- have been occasionally seen, and give a colour to
this belief of the natives. One day, whilst bivouacking at a
lonely and romantic spot, in a valley of rocks, situated some
forty miles north of Perth, called the 'Dooda-mya', or the Abode
of Dogs, I desired a native to lead my horse to a pool, and let
him drink. The man, however, declined with terror, refusing to go
near the pool, which was inhabited by the Waugul. I therefore had
to take my horse myself to the spot, whilst the native stood
aloof, fully expecting that the Waugul would seize him by the
nose and pull him under water.</p>

<p>The natives are polygamists. Each male is entitled to all the
females who are related to him in a certain degree. A newly-born
child is therefore the betrothed spouse of a man who may be
thirty years of age, and who claims her from her parents so soon
as she is marriageable--when she is twelve years old, or earlier.
Some men have, consequently, four or six wives of various ages,
whilst others have none at all. The latter are therefore
continually engaged in stealing the wives of other people.</p>

<p>This causes incessant wars among the tribes. When the
legitimate husband recovers his wife, he does not restore her to
the full enjoyment of domestic happiness, until he has punished
her for eloping. This he does by thrusting a spear through the
fleshy part of her leg or thigh.</p>

<p>The natives are very good-natured to one another; sharing
their provisions and kangaroo-skin cloaks without grudging. The
head of a family takes the half-baked duck, opossum, or wild-dog,
from the fire, and after tearing it in pieces with his teeth,
throws the fragments into the sand for his wives and children to
pick up. They are very fond of rice and sugar; and bake dampers
from flour, making them on a corner of their cloaks.</p>

<p>Fish and other things are frequently baked in the bark of the
paper-tree.</p>

<p>The following observations have been sent to me by my youngest
brother: "Every tribe possesses a certain tract of country which
is called after the name of the tribe--as Moenaing Budja--the
Moenai-men's ground. They are not always very particular about
trespassing on their neighbour's territory. Many of the colonists
say that each tribe has its chief or king; but among all whom I
have seen, I never could discover that they paid any particular
respect to one individual, though they appear to reverence old
age; and I have frequently seen a party of young men, alternately
carrying an old grey-headed patriarch during their excursions
from one encampment to another.</p>

<p>"They have no religion whatever, but they believe in some kind
of an evil spirit. I have often tried to discover, but could
never clearly understand, whether they believe in only one
all-powerful evil spirit, or whether it is merely the spirits of
their departed friends that they fear; or, (as I am inclined to
believe) they fear both; and for these reasons:--wherever there
is a large encampment of natives, each family has its own private
fire and hut, but you will always perceive another fire about one
hundred yards from the camp, which apparently belongs to no one;
but which the old hags take care shall never go out during the
night; for they will frequently get up and replenish that fire,
when they are too lazy to fetch fuel for their own. They call
that Chingi's fire; and they believe if he comes in the night he
will sit quietly by his own fire and leave them undisturbed. That
they likewise believe in the reappearance of departed spirits,
may be easily proved by the manner and the formalities with which
they bury their dead. In the first place they cut off the hair
and beard; they then break his finger-joints and tie the thumb
and fore-finger of the right hand together; so that if he rise
again, he may not have the power to use a spear and revenge
himself. They then break his spears, throwing-stick, and all his
other implements of war, and throw them into the grave, over
which they build a hut; and a fire is kept lighted for a certain
length of time. It is likewise customary for his wife or nearest
relation, if at any future period they should happen to pass near
the grave, to repair the hut, rekindle the fire, and utter a long
rigmarole to the departed, to induce him to lie still, and not
come back and torment them. Nothing will induce a stranger to go
near a new grave, or to mention the name of the departed for a
long time after his death. They always speak of him as
So-and-so's brother, or father. If the deceased be the father of
a family, it is the duty of his eldest son, or nearest relation,
to avenge his death by killing one of the next, or any other
tribe; and this often leads to furious battles or cold-blooded
murders; for they are by no means particular whether it be man,
woman, or child who is the victim; and it is generally the poor
women who suffer on these occasions; the men being too cowardly,
unless under the influence of very strong passion, to attack
those of equal strength with themselves. The women do all the
work, such as building huts, carrying water, digging up roots,
and procuring grubs out of the wattle and grass-trees. I have
seen a poor unfortunate woman marching twenty miles a-day, with
(at least) a hundred pounds'-weight on her back, including the
child and all their effects; whilst the husband has been too lazy
to carry even his cloak. A hunting excursion with a large party
of natives is capital sport. They choose, if possible, a valley,
at one end of which they station ten or twenty of the most expert
spearmen; with whom, if you want any fun, you must station
yourself, taking care to remain concealed. All the juveniles of
the party then start off, and make a circuit of many miles in
extent, shouting and hallooing the whole time. They form a
semicircle, and drive all the kangaroos before them down the
valley, to the spot where the old hunters are placed. Then comes
the tug of war, the crashing of bushes, the flying of spears, and
the thump, thump of the kangaroos, as they come tearing along,
sometimes in hundreds, from the old grey grandfather of six feet
high, to the little picanniny of twelve inches, who has tumbled
out of his mother's pouch; and numbers fall victims to the
ruthless arms of the hunters. The evening terminates with a grand
feast and a corrobery."</p>

<br>


<p> </p>

<p>Each tribe has its doctor, or wise man, who is supposed to
have supernatural powers of healing wounds, and is the oracle of
the tribe. One of these fellows described to me the mode of his
initiation. He said his father, himself a wise man, took him one
night to the edge of a steep hill, where he left him lying
wrapped in his kangaroo-skin cloak. He was very much frightened,
but durst not stir. During the night Chingi came and tried to
throw him down the hill, and to strangle him, but did not
succeed. Chingi was like something very black. He afterwards came
again, and told him a great many secrets; and thus is was that my
informant became a doctor and a wise man. I think I have heard of
people obtaining the power of second sight in the Isle of Skye by
lying on a rock all night, wrapped in a bull's hide, and
receiving a visit from the devil. The similarity between these
initiatory processes struck me forcibly.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 18.</h3>

<h4>THE MODEL-KINGDOM.</h4>

<p>A well-governed colony is the Model of a great kingdom. As in
the case of other models, every part of the machinery by which it
is moved is placed at once before the eye of the spectator. In a
great empire, the springs of action are concealed; the public
behold only the results, and can scarcely guess how those results
were brought about. In a colony, every one stands so close to the
little machine of Government, that he can readily discern how it
is made to work, and therefore takes a more lively interest in
the working of it. The model has its representative of a
sovereign; its Ministers, who comprise the Executive Council with
the Colonial Secretary as Premier; its Parliament, the
Legislative Assembly; its Bishop of London, who is represented by
the Colonial Chaplain, the dignitary of the Church in those
parts. In the Legislative Assembly there are the Government
party, consisting of the Colonial Secretary and the Attorney
General, who prove their loyalty and devotion by adhering to His
Excellency the Governor on every division, and (according to
general belief) would rather vote against their own measures than
against the representative of their Queen. Then there is the
popular party, consisting of the popular member, who speaks at
random on either side of the debate, but invariably votes against
the Government, in order to maintain inviolate the integrity of
his principles. We have also the Judge, or Lord chancellor, the
great Law officer of the Crown, who sits silently watching the
progress of a Bill, as it steals gently forward towards the close
of the second reading; and then suddenly pounces upon it, to the
consternation of his Excellency, and the delight of the popular
member, and tears it in pieces with his sharp legal teeth, whilst
he shows that it is in its scope and tendency contrary to the Law
of England in that case provided, and is besides impossible to be
carried out in the present circumstances of the Colony. The Model
Nation has its national debt of one thousand pounds, due to the
Commissariat chest; and this burthen of the State costs his
Excellency many a sleepless night, spent in vain conjectures as
to the best mode of relieving the financial embarrassments.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to learn from the model, how Government
patronage is disposed of in the Parent country. Kindly motives,
however, which never appear in the arrangements of the latter,
are always conspicuous in a colony. A public work is sometimes
created for the sole purpose of saving an unfortunate mechanic
from the horrors of idleness; and a debt due to the State is
occasionally discharged by three months' washing of a Privy
Councillor's shirts.</p>

<p>Then we have the exact fac-simile of a Royal Court, with its
levees and drawing-rooms, where his Excellency displays the
utmost extent of his affability, and his lady of her queenly
airs. There may be seen, in all its original freshness and
vigour, the smiling hatred of rival ladies, followed by their
respective trains of admirers; whilst the full-blown dames of
Members of Council elbow their way, with all the charming
confidence of rank, towards the vicinity of her who is the
cynosure of all eyes. The early levees of the first Governor of
Western Australia were held in a dry swamp, near the centre of
the present town of Perth. His Excellency, graciously bowing
beneath the shade of a banksia tree, received with affability
those who were introduced to him, as they stumbled into his
presence over tangled brushwood, and with difficulty avoided the
only humiliation that is scorned by English courtiers--that of
the person.</p>

<p>Ladies, in struggling through the thorny brake, had sometimes
to labour under the double embarrassment of a ragged reputation
and dress. To appear before the Presence, under such
circumstances, with a smiling countenance, proved the triumph of
feminine art, and of course excited general admiration. But this
was in the early days of the settlement. We have now a handsome
Government-house, where ladies who attend drawing-rooms incur no
danger of any kind.</p>

<p>From the financial difficulties of a small colony you may form
some idea of the troubles of the Chancellor of the Exchequer at
home. And yet there is less financial talent required to raise
five hundred thousand pounds in England than five hundred in an
impoverished colony. In the former country only a few voices,
comparatively, are raised in expostulation; and no one cares
about them, if Mr. Hume could be gagged, and the other patriots
in the Commons. But in a colony! threaten to raise the price of
sugar by the imposition of another half-penny per pound, and the
whole land will be heaved as though by an earthquake. Not only
will the newspapers pour forth a terrific storm of denunciations
against a treacherous Government, but every individual of the
public will take up the matter as a personal injury, and roar out
his protest against so monstrous a political crime. Those who
called most loudly for the erection of a necessary bridge, will
be most indignant when asked next year to contribute towards its
cost.</p>

<p>The Governor of a colony should not only be a good financier,
but if he would avoid the bitter pangs of repentance, must
possess great firmness in resisting the innumerable calls upon
the Government purse.</p>

<p>His Excellency may lay his account to being daily vituperated
for not consenting to the construction of this or that national
work, but he will be still more taken to task when the melancholy
duty of paying for it becomes imperative, and is found to be
unavoidable.</p>

<p>It is the general belief, that in a colony we are altogether
out of the world; but it has always appeared to me, that within
the narrow confines of one of those epitomes of a kingdom we may
see more of the world than when standing on the outer edge of
society in England.</p>

<p>A man thinks himself in the midst of the world in Great
Britain, because he reads the newspapers and knows what is
passing and being enacted around him. But the same newspapers are
read with equal diligence in a colony, and the same knowledge is
acquired there, though some three months later. To read the
newspapers, and to hang, close as a burr, upon the skirts of
society, is not to be in the world. The world is, in truth, the
heart of Man; and he knows most of the World who knows most of
his species. And where, alas! may this knowledge, so painful and
so humiliating, be better acquired than in a colony? There we
have the human heart laid open before us without veil or
disguise: there we see it in all its coarseness, its selfishness,
its brutality.</p>

<p>How many fine natures, cultivated, delicate, and generous,
have gone forth from their native land, full of high resolves,
only to perish in the mephitic atmosphere of a colony!</p>

<p>There we find whatever there is of good and bad in human
nature brought immediately before our eyes. It is a school of
moral anatomy, in which we study subjects whose outer covering
has been removed, and where the inner machinery (fearful to see!)
is left exposed.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the world! if we gain it not in a colony, it
must ever remain a sealed book to us.</p>

<p>We shall leave but a bad impression on the mind of the reader
in concluding this short chapter with these sombre observations;
but we would not leave him without hope. Time will remedy all
this. Some moral evils correct themselves; as the water of the
Nile becomes pure again after it has gone putrid.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 19.</h3>

<h4>TRIALS OF A GOVERNOR.</h4>

<p>Except the waiter at a commercial inn, no man has so much upon
his hands, or so many faults to answer for, as the Governor of a
colony. If public affairs go wrong, every voice is raised,
requiring him immediately to rectify them; and as every one has a
particular plan of his own, the Governor is expected instantly to
adopt them all. Nor has he public calamities only to answer for;
the private misfortunes of individuals are, without hesitation,
laid at his door. He is expected to do something, and not a
little, for all who are in trouble; he has to devise expedients
for those whose own wits are at fault: it is among his duties to
console, to cheer, to advise, to redress, to remedy; and, above
all, to enrich.</p>

<p>As men set up a block of wood in a field to become a
rubbing-post for asses; as bachelors take to themselves wives,
and elderly spinsters individuals of the feline race, in order to
have something on which to vent their occasional ill-humours, so
is a Governor set up in a colony, that the settlers may have a
proper object or mark set apart, on which they may satisfactorily
discharge their wrongs, sorrows, wants, troubles, distractions,
follies, and unreasonable expectations. A Governor is the
safety-valve of a colony; withdraw this legitimate object of
abuse, and the whole community would be at loggerheads. A state
of anarchy would be the immediate consequence, and broil and
blood-shed would prevail throughout the land. Sometimes a
Governor forgets the purpose for which he was sent out from home,
and placed on high in a colony, as a rubbing-post; he sometimes
lapses into the error of fancying himself a colonial Solon, and
strives to distinguish his reign by the enactment of laws, which
only increase the natural irritability of the settlers, and cause
him to be more rubbed against than ever. On these occasions he is
not always entitled to much sympathy; but when private parties
come crowding round him to have the consequence of their follies
averted, or merely in a state of discontented irritation, to have
their backs scratched, his poor Excellency is much to be
compassionated.</p>

<p>Almost every morning a long-eared crowd assembles around the
Government-offices, where the rubbing-post is set up, and one
after another they are admitted to find what relief they may from
this cheap luxury. It is pleasant to observe that they almost all
come out again with smiling countenances. For a moment, the sense
of pain or discontent has been alleviated by the gentle
application.</p>

<p>Sometimes an honest farmer has ridden fifty miles in order to
have the pleasure of complaining to his Excellency of the
mal-administration of the post-office department, evidenced by
the non-delivery of a letter, which, after a vast deal of
investigation and inquiry, turns out never to have been posted.
Sometimes a man comes for advice as to the propriety of going to
law with his neighbour about a bull which had taken the liberty
to eat some of his turnips. One man wishes to have his
Excellency's opinion upon a disease which has lately broken out
among his pigs; another has mysteriously carried a piece of
iron-stone in his pocket for a hundred miles, and claims the
reward for the discovery of a coal-mine; a third has a plan to
propose for fertilizing the sand-plains around Perth, by manuring
them with sperm oil. Some are desirous that their sons should be
made Government clerks, and insist upon their right to all vacant
appointments on the plea of being "old settlers." Others have
suggestions to make the neglect of which would prove ruinous to
the colony: general misery is only to be averted by the repeal of
the duty on tobacco: no more ships need be expected (this is
after a gale and wreck,) unless a break-water be constructed,
which may be done for ninety-five thousand pounds, and there was
a surplus revenue last year over the expenditure of thirteen
shillings and sixpence, the local government being also indebted
to the Commissariat chest in the sum of nine hundred pounds odd.
Some complain of roads and bridges being in a defective state,
and wonder why two thousand pounds extra per annum are not laid
out upon them; these are succeeded by a deputation from the
inhabitants of Rockingham, requesting, as a matter of right, that
half that sum may be applied in ornamenting their principal
square with a botanical garden. Then the Governor has to attend
to complaints against public officers. The Commissioner of the
Civil Court has proved himself to be an unjust judge by deciding
for the defendant contrary to the truth, as proved by the
plaintiff; or the Commissioner of the Court of Requests has
received a bribe of three-and-fourpence, and refused to listen to
the complainant's story. The magistrates have granted a spirit
license to a notorious character, and denied one to the
applicant, an unimpeachable householder. The Post-Master General
has embezzled a letter, or the Colonial Secretary has neglected
to reply to one.</p>

<p>All these things, and a thousand others, the Governor is
expected to listen to, inquire about, remedy, or profit by.</p>

<p>One day, I remember, I went myself to complain of the
absurdity of an Act of Council which I thought might be
advantageously amended by the aid of a little light which had
lately dawned upon me.</p>

<p>Among those who haunted the ante-room, waiting for admittance
to the rubbing-post was a tall Irish woman, who had seen better
days, but was now reduced to much distress, and was besides not
altogether right in her intellects.</p>

<p>She was in the frequent habit of attending there, for the
purpose of complaining against the Advocate General, who never
paid her proper attention when she went to lay her grievances
before him. This woman was the terror of the Government officers.
She never allowed her victim to escape when once she had begun
her story;--in vain might he try to edge away towards the
door--if he were not to be retained by the fascination of her
voice, she would seize him by the coat with a grasp of iron, and
a fly might as well try to escape from a pot-bellied spider.
Whenever she appeared, no public officer was ever to be found. A
general epidemic seemed to have fallen upon the offices, and
exterminated all the inhabitants. The Colonial Secretary would
rush out to luncheon, deaf as an adder to the cries of female
distress that rang in the troubled air behind him. The Advocate
General, hearing the well-known voice inquiring for him in no
friendly key, would hurry away through an opposite door, and dive
into the woods adjoining Government-house, and there gnaw his
nails, in perturbation of spirit until he thought the evil was
overpast. His Excellency himself would sooner have seen the
Asiatic cholera walk into the room than Miss Maria Martin, and
invariably turned paler then his writing-paper, and shuddered
with a sudden ague. She had so many wrongs to complain of, which
no human power could redress, and she required so much to be done
for her, and insisted upon having reiterated promises to that
effect, that no wonder she excited the utmost terror in the minds
of all whom she approached. She was, moreover, a huge, brawny,
fierce-looking creature, and though upwards of fifty years of
age, had the strength of an Irish porter. She was reported on one
occasion to have taken a gentleman of high reputation, and
unimpeachable morals, by the collar of his coat, and pinned him
up against the wall, until he had promised to speak for her to
the Governor; and when he subsequently accused her of this
violence, she retorted by saying that it was in self-defence, as
he had attempted improper liberties. The fear of such an
unscrupulous and cruel accusation made Government officers,
especially the married ones, extremely shy of granting a
tete-a-tete conversation to Miss Martin; and as no one was, of
course, more correct in his conduct than his Excellency the
Governor, no wonder that he should feel extremely nervous
whenever he was surprised into an interview with this interesting
spinster.</p>

<p>When I found her in the ante-room I naturally recoiled, and
tried to back out again, smiling blandly all the time, as one
does when a violent-looking dog comes up. and begins sniffing
about your legs. Miss Martin, however, was used to these
manoeuvres, and suddenly getting between me and the door,
intercepted my retreat, and insisted on telling me, for the
twentieth time, how villanously the Advocate General had deceived
her. Escape was impossible; I groaned and sweated with anguish,
but listen I must, and had to suffer martyrdom for an hour, when
the Governor's door opened, and he himself looked out. On seeing
the Gorgon he tried to withdraw, but she pounded like a tigress
through the door-way, and slamming the door after her, secured an
audience with his Excellency, which she took care should not be a
short one. I could remain no longer, and therefore owe the rest
of the story to public report. After an hour's tete-a-tete, his
Excellency's voice grew more imperative. The clerks, highly
interested, conceived that he was insisting upon her withdrawing.
It is supposed that he could not possibly escape himself, as she
of course cut off all communication with either the door or the
bell-rope. The lady's voice also waxed higher; at length it rose
into a storm. Nothing more was heard of the poor Governor beyond
a faint, moaning sound; whether he was deprecating the tempest,
or being actually strangled, became a matter of grave
speculation. Some asserted that they heard his kicks upon the
floor, others could only hear convulsive sobs; then all fancied
they could distinguish the sounds of a struggle. The officials
debated whether it would be proper or indelicate to look in upon
the interview; but it became so evident that a scuffle was going
on, that the private secretary's anxiety overcame all other
considerations. The door was opened just as his Excellency,
escaping from the grasp of the mad woman, had made a vault at the
railing which ran across the farther end of the Council Room (to
keep back the public on certain days), in hopes of effecting his
escape by the door beyond. Nothing could have been better
conceived than this design; but unhappily the lady had caught
hold of his coat-tail to arrest his flight, and therefore instead
of vaulting clear over the rails, as he had anticipated, his
Excellency was drawn back in his leap, and found himself seated
astride upon the barrier, with a desperate woman tugging at his
tail, and trying to pull him back into the arena. Nothing, we
believe, has ever exceeded the ludicrous misery displayed in his
Excellency's visage on finding himself in this perilous
situation. But seeing the private secretary and a mob of clerks,
with their pens in their hands, hastening to his rescue, he made
a desperate effort, and cast himself off on the other side; and
finally succeeded in rushing out of the room, having only one
tail hanging to his coat, with which he escaped into an adjoining
apartment, and was received into the arms of the Surveyor General
in a state of extreme exhaustion.</p>

<p>Such are some of the troubles and afflictions incident to the
unenviable office of Governor of a colony. Those innocent country
gentlemen who have expended the better part of their property on
contested elections, and now weary heaven and Her Majesty's
Principal Secretaries of State for colonial appointments, little
know what they invoke upon themselves. In my opinion Sancho Panza
had a sinecure, compared with theirs, in his Governorship of the
island of Barrataria.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *Our love of the ludicrous frequently makes us
delighted to find even the most estimable characters in a
ridiculous position. The above anecdote is perhaps exaggerated,
but it is here recorded as a moral warning to those who yearn
like Sancho Panza for a government, and not from a desire to cast
ridicule upon one who was universally respected and esteemed, for
the quiet decorum of his life, his high principles, his strict
impartiality, and the conscientious discharge of all the duties
of his office.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 20.</h3>

<h4>MR. SAILS, MY GROOM.--OVER THE HILLS.--A SHEEP STATION.</h4>

<p>Soon after I was settled in my residence at Perth I purchased
a couple of young mares unbroke, recently imported from the Cape
of Good Hope. They were the offspring of an Arab horse and Cape
mare, and one of them, a chestnut, was almost the handsomest
creature I ever beheld. They cost me thirty guineas each; but
since that period the value of horses is greatly diminished.</p>

<p>I was very much pleased with this purchase, which recalled the
memories of boyhood and a long-tailed pony, whenever I found
myself feeding or grooming my stud--which I often thought proper
to do, as my establishment, though at that time numerous, did not
comprise a well-educated groom.</p>

<p>Besides my own man, I had two runaway sailors from the ship in
which we had come out, quartered upon me. They expressed so
flattering a regard for me, as the only person whom they knew in
this part of the world, and were so ready to dig the garden and
plant potatoes, or do any other little matter to make themselves
useful, that I had not the heart to refuse them a nook in the
kitchen, or a share of our daily meals. I now called their
services into activity by making them assist at the breaking in
of my mares; and whilst I held the lunging-rein, Mr. Sails would
exert himself till he became as black as a sweep with dust and
perspiration, by running round and round in the rear of the
animal, urging her forward with loud cries and objurgations,
accompanied with furious crackings of his whip. These sailors
never did anything quietly. If told to give the horses some hay,
they would both start up from their stools by the kitchen fire,
as if in a state of frantic excitement; thrust their pipes into
the leathern belt which held up their trousers, and jostling each
other through the doorway like a brace of young dogs, tear round
the house to the stable, or rather shed, as though possessed by a
legion of devils. Then, unable to use a fork, they would seize as
much hay as they could clasp in their arms, and littering it all
about the premises, rush to the stalls, where they suddenly grew
exceedingly cautious; for in fact, they felt much greater dread
of these horses than they would have done of a ground shark. Then
it was all, "Soh! my little feller! Soh! my pretty little
lass!--Avast there--(in a low tone) you lubber, or I'll rope's
end you--none of that!" This was whenever the mare, pleased at
the sight of the hay, looked round and whinnied. Unless I
superintended the operation myself, the hay would be thrown under
the horse's feet, whilst the men took to their heels at the same
moment, and then turned round to see whether the animals could
reach their fodder. If they could, these worthy grooms would come
cheerfully to me and tell me that the horses were eating their
allowance; but if not, they filled their pipes, and took a turn
out of the way, trusting the hay would all be trampled into the
litter before I happened to see it. Whenever I was present, I
made them get upon the manger and put the hay into the rack, (I
never could teach them to use a fork,) but it was with fear and
trembling that they did this. One day, Sails was standing on the
manger, with the hay in his arms, when the mare, trying to get a
mouthful, happened to rub her nose against the hinder portion of
his person. Sails roared aloud, and let the hay fall upon the
mare's head and neck.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, man?" said I.</p>

<p>"By Gad, sir," cried Sails, looking round with a face of
terror, and scrambling down, "he's tuk a bite out of my
starn!"</p>

<p>After the horses had been well lunged it became necessary to
mount them. In vain, however, I tried to persuade Sails or his
comrade Dick to get upon their backs. I therefore mounted first
myself, and after a deal of plunging and knocking about was
dismounted again, with the mare, who had thrown herself down,
actually kneeling upon my body. All this time, Sails stood
helplessly looking on open-mouthed, holding the lunging-rein in
his hands; and I had to call to him to "pull her off" before he
made any attempt to give assistance. This accident effectually
prevented my gallant grooms from trusting themselves on
horseback; but they proved more useful in breaking in the animals
to draw the light cart. One would ride whilst the other drove,
and their nautical phrases, and seaman-like style of steering the
craft, as they called it, excited the admiration of the
neighbourhood. But they never could bring themselves to like the
employment of tending horses; and finding that I insisted upon
their making themselves useful in this way, they at last gave me
up, and volunteered as part of the crew of a vessel about to sail
for Sincapore.</p>

<p>Long after this period I drove the dog-cart over the hills to
York races. My brother had come down to Perth, and we went
together, taking with us our friend the amiable and talented
editor of one of the Perth journals. Attaching another horse to
an outrigger, we drove unicorn, or a team of three.</p>

<p>It was a splendid October morning, (the commencement of
summer,) and we rattled over the long and handsome wooden bridges
that cross the two streams of the Swan, at a spanking pace,
whilst the worthy editor, exulting in his temporary emancipation
from office, made the wooded banks of the river ring again with
the joyous notes of his key-bugle.</p>

<p>Half an hour carried us over five miles of road, and brought
us to Mangonah, the beautifully situated dwelling of R. W. Nash,
Esq., barrister at law, the most active-minded and
public-spirited man in the colony. After a short delay, to laugh
at one of our friend's last coined and most facetious anecdotes,
and also to visit his botanical garden, we rattled off again to
Guildford; a scattered hamlet that was made acquainted with our
approach by loud strains from the editor's bugle. Here, however,
we paused not, but proceeded along a hard and good road towards
Green Mount, the first hill which we had to ascend. Green Mount,
six miles from Guildford, is famous for a desperate skirmish
which took place some years ago between a large body of natives
and Messrs. Bland and Souper, at the head of a party escorting
provisions from Perth to the infant settlement at York. Whilst
slowly ascending the hill, a thick flight of spears fell among
the party, wounding several of them. No enemy was visible, and
the greatest consternation prevailed among the men, who hastened
to shelter themselves under the carts. This induced the natives
to rush out of their ambush, when they were received with a
shower of balls; and at length driven back, after losing a good
many men. Mr. Souper had several spears sticking in his body, and
others of the English were severely wounded, but none
mortally.</p>

<p>The natives are very tenacious of life, and so are all the
birds and animals indigenous to the country.</p>

<p>The natives often have spears thrust completely through their
bodies, and without any serious injury, receive wounds that would
prove mortal to the whites. A vagabond who had speared one of
those noble rams of ours, of whom honourable mention has been
already made, was shot by our shepherd whilst in the act of
decamping with the carcase. The ball passed completely through
his lungs, and would have made an end of any white man; but the
native recovered in the course of a few days, and walked a
hundred miles heavily ironed, to take his trial for
sheep-stealing at the Quarter Sessions.</p>

<p>From Guildford to the foot of Green Mount, the country
presents a vast plain of cold clayey soil, unfit for cultivation,
and though covered with scrub, affording very little useful
herbage.</p>

<p>On ascending the hill, we come upon what is generally called
the iron-stone range, which extends nearly to York, a distance of
forty miles. These extensive hills (about fifteen hundred feet
above the level of the sea) are composed almost entirely of
granite rocks, with occasional tracts of quartz; and the surface
is generally strewn over with a hard loose rubble.</p>

<p>Although the sides and summits of the hills present scarcely
any appearance of soil, vast forests of large Jarra trees, and
other varieties of the eucalyptus, extend in every direction; and
flowers the most beautiful relieve the sombre appearance of the
ground. Some few of the valleys afford a few acres of alluvial
soil; and in the first of these, called Mahogany Creek, six miles
from Green Mount, we found a comfortable way-side house, with
good out-buildings, and other accommodations; and here we halted
to lunch, and bait our horses.</p>

<p>Many other individuals, bent upon the same journey as
ourselves, were lounging and smoking before the house, or
partaking of the refreshments. Most were travelling on horseback;
some in gigs, and some in light spring-carts. A famous round of
cold beef, with bottled ale and porter, proved extremely
agreeable after our drive.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we proceeded fifteen miles farther, to the
half-way house, where on my first arrival in the colony I had
been initiated into the art of cooking a saddle of kangaroo, and
serving it up with mint-sauce. The road, through a dense forest
of evergreen trees, is excessively dreary, and the quarters for
the night were never very satisfactory; but the traveller might
always look forward to a comfortable sitting-room, kangaroo
steaks and pork, with plenty of fresh eggs and good bread. Since
that time the house has been given up by the energetic landlord;
and the Local Government is partly responsible for the loss of
this accommodation, in consequence of having insisted upon a
heavy license being annually taken out. In good times, when the
farm-settlers of the York and Northam districts brought their
wool and other produce down this road to the capital, they
invariably spent a merry evening at the half-way house; but since
money has become scarcer in the colony, they have been compelled
to avoid this place of entertainment, and kindle instead a fire
by the road-side, where they spend their evenings in solitary
meditation, to the advantage doubtless of their minds and purses.
In the morning, full of philosophical thoughts and fried rashers
of pork, they calmly yoke their bullocks to the wain, unafflicted
by those pangs which were often the only acknowledgment rendered
to the hospitality of Mr. Smith--pangs of mental remorse and a
bilious stomach. And yet the worthy host never suffered a guest
whom he respected to depart without administering to him what he
called "a doctor"--of which, about five o'clock in the morning,
the poor man usually felt himself much in need; and at that hour,
as Aurora entered at the window, would mine host (equally
rosy-cheeked) enter by the door, and deliver his matutinal
salutation. This "doctor," a character universally esteemed by
travellers in those parts, was a tumbler of milk fresh from the
cow, tinctured with brandy.</p>

<p>The glory had not departed from the half-way house at the
period to which I refer; and as we drove up to the door, amid the
liveliest strains of the editorial bugle, our jovial host
welcomed us with his heartiest greeting. This spot is truly an
oasis in the desert, affording a few acres of tolerable land, and
some excellent garden-ground which, in the season, produces
abundance of grapes, peaches, apples, figs, and various kinds of
vegetables. A deep brook runs at the bottom of the garden which
is very well watered; and on its margin, in the midst of a green
plot, protected by palings from rude encroachment, is the quiet
grave of one of Mr. Smith's children. How different looks the
solitary grave of the desert from the crowded churchyards of
England! How much more home it comes to the heart! Across the
brook is a large barley-field, and down the valley are several
other inclosures; all around, beyond these, is the dark,
melancholy, illimitable forest. At one end of the house, which is
of goodly size, stands a huge erection of wood, resembling a
gallows, from which are suspended the bodies of three kangaroos.
Not far from this, a group of natives--men, women, and
children--are squatted round a small fire, eating baked opossums,
and chattering, and uttering shrill screams of laughter, with all
their might. Half a dozen large kangaroo dogs are hanging about
this group with wistful eyes, but evidently without any
expectations of obtaining a morsel.</p>

<p>The house, being filled with people on their way to the races,
resounded all the evening with jokes and merriment; and when the
well-disposed retired to bed, and flattered themselves they were
just sinking into repose, a mob of their evil-minded friends,
headed by an Irish barrister and the usually sedate Crown
Solicitor, beat down the door, and pulled them forth again. Then
were the four walls of the room (which contained four beds) made
witnesses to a scene exhibiting all the horrors of war. Dreadful
was the conflict: bolsters and carpet-bags were wielded with
fierce animosity; pillows and rolled-up blankets flew about the
room like cannon-shot; and long was the contest doubtful, until
the despair of the besieged at length overcame the impetuosity of
the assailants, and succeeded in driving them from the
apartment.</p>

<p>The half-way house was often so crowded that some of the
guests had to sleep upon the dining-table, the sofas, and the
floor. At early dawn it was usually cleared of its visitors, who
would push on to breakfast at Mahogany Creek; or if going to
York, at St. Roman's Well, distant some fifteen miles. It was
here that we breakfasted, sitting upon the grass, whilst with our
camp-kettle we boiled our chocolate, and enjoyed our morning meal
exceedingly.</p>

<p>York is a scattered hamlet of good farm-houses. The country is
highly interesting. A lofty hill, or mountain, called Mount
Bakewell, confines the view on one side, and below it is the
river Avon, a broad stream in winter, but in summer consisting
only of deep pools in various parts of its course. The
neighbourhood is beautifully wooded, and has the appearance of a
park. In the centre of the hamlet a modest-looking, white-washed
church "rears its meek fane." Nothing could be more peaceful and
serene than the whole aspect of the place.</p>

<p>At my brother's farm, comprising 4,000 acres, the property of
R. H. Bland, Esq., Protector of Natives, we found a hearty
reception, and a very pleasant dwelling-house. For several days
it was filled with young men who had come from various parts of
the colony to attend the races.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were most of them young men of good family,
and well educated, who having only a small patrimony, and having
been brought up to no trade or profession, had come out to a
colony in the hope of acquiring landed estates, and of founding
in this part of the world a family of their own. In the meantime
they had to drive their teams, shear their sheep, thresh their
corn, and exhibit their skill in husbandry; whilst their houses
were as ill arranged and uncomfortable as could be expected from
the superintendence of bachelors who thought more of their
stables than of the appearance of their rooms. They care more
about good horses than good cooks, and in most cases prefer doing
without kitchen stuff rather than be troubled with a garden.</p>

<p>Freedom of discourse and ease of manner characterize the
social meetings of our bachelor aristocracy "over the hills."</p>

<p>Dinner is only to be obtained by dint of incessant shouting to
the slave (frequently an Indian Coolie) who presides in the
detached kitchen, and brings in the viands as fast as he "dishes
up." The roast mutton gradually cools upon the table while Mooto
is deliberately forking the potatoes out of the pot, and
muttering curses against his master, who stands at the
parlour-door, swearing he will wring his ears off if he does not
despatch. In order to moderate the anguish of stomach experienced
by the guests, the host endeavours to fill up the time by sending
the sherry round. The dinner is at length placed upon the table,
and Mooto scuffles out of the room whilst his master is busy
carving, lest he should be compelled to wait, an occupation less
agreeable than that to which he returns, and which engages most
of his time--sitting on an upturned box before the fire, and
smoking his pipe. Here, piously thanking Vishnu and Brama for
such good tobacco, he puffs away, heedless of the shouts of his
suzerain, who has just discovered there are only eight plates for
twelve people. One of the guests volunteers a foray into Mooto's
territory, chiefly for the sake of relieving his own feelings by
making that worthy acquainted with the opinion he entertains of
him, and returns to his seat with cold plates and a tranquillized
mind.</p>

<p>When the villain lacquey has smoked his pipe, he brings in the
cheese, and clears away. No unnecessary feelings of delicacy
restrain the guests from reviling him seriatim as he removes the
platters; and he retires to his own den and the enjoyment of a
pound of boiled rice with undisturbed equanimity, leaving the
others to boil the kettle and concoct egg-flip, which, together
with wine, brandy, cigars, and pipes, enables the party to get
through the afternoon. Some remain at the table, drinking out of
wine-glasses, tumblers, or pannikins (every vessel which the
house contains being put in requisition), and talking loudly
about their horses, or making bets for the next day's races;
others having thrown off their coats, and flung their persons
upon a sofa, with their feet on a window-sill, puff away in
meditative silence, only joining occasionally in the
conversation; whilst two or three walk up and down the verandah,
in solemn consultation as to the best mode of hedging, having
unhappily backed a colt for the Margaux Cup that turns out to be
a dunghill.</p>

<p>I trust my good friends over the hills will not think I am
making an ungrateful return for much hospitality by this rough
and imperfect sketch. Heaven knows they are a worthy,
kind-hearted, hospitable set of good fellows as ever drew a cork
or made egg-flip; but I must say some of the bachelor
establishments are rather in a rude and primitive state at
present.</p>

<p>Those houses which are fortunate enough to possess a presiding
genius in the gentle and attractive form of Woman are very
differently ordered. English neatness and English comforts
pervade the establishment, and the manners and customs of
well-regulated society are never forgotten.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant sight in the evening to watch the cattle
driven into the stock-yard by the native boy, who has been with
them all day in the bush. Some of the old cows go steadily enough
in the right direction, but others, and especially the young
heifers, are continually bunting one another, and trying to push
their next neighbours into the ditch. Several, tempted by a
pleasant field of barley, have leapt over a broken rail, and are
eating and trampling down all before them. But soon they are
perceived by the dusky herdsman, who incontinently shrieks like
one possessed by demons, and rushing after the stray kine with a
bough hastily picked up, chases and belabours them up and down
the field (the gate of which he has never thought of opening),
until he has done as much mischief as possible to the crop.
Somebody then opens the gate for him, and the cattle are at
length secured in the yard.</p>

<p>Next arrives a flock of two thousand sheep, driven by white
shepherds. On coming to the entrance of the fold-yard, they stop
and hesitate, refusing to enter. All is uncertainty and
confusion, the rearmost urged forward by the shout of the men and
the barking of the dogs, who run from side to side, thrusting
their noses into the soft white fleeces, press into the mass;
great is the scuffle, the rush, and the pattering of feet over
the loose pebbles of the yard. At length, a hardy and determined
ram in the vanguard gives a leap of ten feet through the open
gateway, and the others hustle through after him, every one
leaping as he had done, and all congratulating themselves on
having thus cleverly eluded the designs of some unseen enemy.</p>

<p>I do not intend to give an account of the races, though they
afforded more amusement probably than is common at Epsom or
Ascot. Every one knew everybody and everybody's horse; and as the
horses were generally ridden by gentlemen, there was no doubt of
fair play. There was an accident, as usual, in the hurdle-race;
but not being fatal, it did not interrupt the sports. Large
groups of the natives, sitting on the ground, or standing leaning
on their spears, gave increased effect to the picturesque
scenery. Some clumps of forest-trees still occupied the centre of
the course, and through these you caught glimpses of coloured
jackets and jockey-caps as they flashed by. The green side of
Mount Bakewell was spotted with sheep, and above them frowned a
forest of dark trees.</p>

<p>A loaf of bread stuck upon a spear was a mark and a prize for
native dexterity. The dusky savages forming a line in front, and
clustering eagerly upon one another behind, took their turns to
throw at the coveted target; and every time that a spear left the
womera, or throwing-stick, and missed the mark, a shrill yell
burst simultaneously from the mass, relieving the excitement
which had been pent up in every breast. But when a successful
spear struck down the loaf, trebly wild and shrill was the yell
that rent the air.</p>

<p>The York and Northam districts afford a vast quantity of land
suitable for all kinds of grain. The sheep and cattle runs are
excellent, but they are now fully stocked, and new settlers must
direct their steps to the southward, the Dale and Hotham
districts affording scope and verge enough for many a flock and
herd. Our own sheep were generally kept at a squatting station on
the Hotham, some sixty or seventy miles south of York. Thither,
after the races, we drove to inspect the flock. There was no
road, and only an endless succession of trees, and of gently
rising and falling country. How my brother and his men used to
manage to hit upon the site of the location is more than I can
conjecture. People accustomed to the bush seem to acquire, like
the natives, the faculty of knowing exactly the direction,
position, and distance of the spot they want to reach.</p>

<p>On the way, we fell in with one of those extraordinary nests
constructed by that singular bird called by the natives the Now.
Mr. Gould's description of a similar bird in New South Wales, the
Brush Turkey 'Talegalla Lathami' does not exactly tally with that
which we should give of the Now. His description is as
follows:--"For some weeks previous to laying its eggs, the Brush
turkey collects together an immense mass of vegetable matter,
varying from two to four cart-loads, with which it forms a
pyramidal heap; in this heap it plants its eggs about eighteen
inches deep, and from nine to twelve inches apart. The eggs are
always placed with the large ends upwards, being carefully
covered, and are then left to hatch by the heat engendered by the
decomposition of the surrounding matter. The heaps are formed by
the labours of several pairs of birds. The eggs are white, about
three inches and three quarters long by two and a half in
diameter, and have an excellent flavour."</p>

<p>Of this bird, Professor Owen observes, "On comparing the
osteology of the 'Talegalla' with that of other birds, it
exhibits all the essential modifications which characterize the
gallinaceous tribe; and among the Rasores, it most nearly
resembles the genera Penelope and Crax."</p>

<p>The Now of Western Australia does not build its nest of
vegetable substances, but collects together an immense heap of
earth, sand, and small stones, into the form of a broad cone,
four or five feet high in the centre, and about ten feet across.
Directly in the centre it either leaves or subsequently hollows
out a hole large enough to admit itself, into which it descends
and deposits its eggs. The powerful summer sun heats the earth
sufficiently to hatch the eggs, and the young birds come forth
active and able to provide for themselves. Not the least
astonishing part to me is, how they manage to scramble out of
that deep hole. The natives declare that the hen frequently
visits the nest, and watches the progress of incubation, and then
when the young ones are hatched, they get upon her back, and she
scrambles out with her family about her.</p>

<p>This bird is about the size of a pheasant, has long legs, and
a very deep breast-bone. It runs fast. Each nest is supposed to
be built by a single bird, but it is believed that other birds
may occupy them in succeeding seasons.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the second day after leaving York, we
descended into a broad valley, abounding with grass and scattered
gum-trees. A large flock of sheep were being driven towards the
bottom of the valley, where we could discern signs of human
habitation.</p>

<p>On arriving, we found a hut built of piles or stakes
interwoven with boughs, before the door of which was a fire with
a large pot upon it, from which a powerful steam arose that was
evidently very grateful to a group of natives seated around. Two
families seemed to compose this group, consisting of a couple of
men, four women, and five or six children of various ages. As we
drew nigh, the whole party, without rising, uttered a wild scream
of welcome, accompanied by that loud laughter which always seems
to escape so readily from this light-hearted and empty-headed
people.</p>

<p>On descending from the vehicle, and looking in at the hut
door, we perceived lying in his shirt-sleeves on a couch composed
of grass-tree tops covered with blankets and a rug made of
opossum skins, the illustrious Meliboeus himself, with a short
black pipe in his mouth, and a handsome edition of "Lalla Rookh"
in his hand. Perceiving us, he jumped up, and expressing his loud
surprise, welcomed us to this rustic Castle of Indolence.</p>

<p>When a large flock of sheep is sent into the bush, and a
squatting station is formed, the shepherds take the sheep out to
pasture every morning, and bring them home at night, whilst one
of the party always remains at the station to protect the
provisions from being stolen by the natives. This person is
called the hut-keeper. His duty is to boil the pork, or kangaroo
flesh, and provide supper, etc., for the shepherds on their
return at night. Meliboeus, who superintended this station,
undertook the duties of cooking and guarding the hut whenever he
did not feel disposed to go out kangaroo-hunting, or shooting
wild turkeys or cockatoos. In all things, sports or labours, the
natives were his daily assistants, and in return for their
services were rewarded with the fore-quarters of the kangaroos
killed, and occasionally with a pound or two of flour. There were
some noble dogs at the station, descendants of Jezebel and Nero;
and my brother had a young kangaroo, which hopped in and out with
the utmost confidence, coming up to any one who happened to be
eating, and insisting upon having pieces of bread given to it.
Full of fun and spirits, it would sport about as playfully as a
kitten; and it was very amusing to see how it would tease the
dogs, pulling them about with its sharp claws, and trying to roll
them over on the ground. The dogs, who were in the daily habit of
killing kangaroos, never attempted to bite Minny, who sometimes
teased them so heartily, that they would put their tails between
their legs and fairly run away.</p>

<p>The great enemies of the sheep in the Australian colonies are
the wild-dogs. At York, and in the other settled districts, they
are very troublesome, and require the shepherd to keep a constant
lookout. We were therefore much surprised to learn that although
wild dogs abounded near this squatting station, they never
attempted to touch our flocks. A sheep was to them a new animal;
they had yet to learn the value of mutton. A cowardly race, they
are easily intimidated, and as they have not the art of jumping
or clambering over a fence, a low sheep-fold will keep them out,
provided they cannot force their way under the palings or
hurdles. They cannot bark, and utter only a melancholy howl. The
bitch generally litters in a hollow tree, and produces four or
five puppies at a birth.</p>

<p>The production of wool--the careful acquisition of a good
flock of well-bred sheep, and the attainment of the highest
degree of perfection in preparing the fleeces for the English
market--appears to us to be the proper ambition of an emigrant to
the Australian colonies. When ill-health compelled my steps
hither, it was the intention of myself and brothers to invest our
capital entirely in sheep; and retiring into the bush for some
six or seven years, gradually accumulate a large flock, the
produce of which would soon have afforded a handsome income. It
has never, however, appeared to be the object of either the Home
Government or the Local Government of any colony (though
unquestionably the interest of both) to encourage emigration.
Settlers have invariably every possible difficulty thrown in
their way. On arriving in this colony, we found to our
astonishment that squatting was illegal, and that we would not be
allowed, as we had designed to carry our goods into the interior
and form a station upon Government land. No license could at that
time be obtained, and if we bought the smallest section allowed
to be sold, which was 640 acres, for as many pounds, it was ten
to one but we should soon find the district in which it was
situated insufficient for the run of a large flock, and should
have to change our quarters again. The consequence was, that we
were compelled to abandon our project: my brothers took a farm at
a high rent, and wasted their capital upon objects that could
never bring in a good return; whilst I (infelix!), instead of
listening to the gentle bleatings of sheep, and ministering to
the early comforts of innocent lambs, have been compelled to
hearken to the angry altercations of plaintiff and defendant, and
decide upon the amount of damages due to injured innocence when
the pot had insulted the kettle.</p>

<p>Now, however, limited licenses are granted to persons wishing
to go as squatters upon Government land; and even before these
were issued, we were OBLIGED to send our sheep upon Crown lands,
and form a station, for want of room in the settled
districts.</p>

<p>Sheep flocks constitute doubtlessly one of the most profitable
investments for the employment of capital, notwithstanding the
many obstacles and discouragements still thrown by both
governments in the way of the wool-grower. They yield a very
large return TO THOSE WHO ATTEND TO THEM IN PERSON, and who
confine their attention entirely to that pursuit, growing only
corn enough for their own consumption.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 21.</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTS FROM THE LOG OF A HUT-KEEPER.</h4>

<p>May 10th.--Felt rather lonely to-day, in the midst of this
endless solitude. Sat before the hut-door thinking of Zimmerman
and his Reflections. Also thought of Brasenose, Oxford, and my
narrow escape from Euclid and Greek plays. Davus sum, non
Oedipus. Set to work, and cooked a kangaroo stew for the three
shepherds.</p>

<p>June 4th.--We have removed the sheep from the Dale to the
Avon. We go wandering about with our flocks and baggage like the
Israelites of old, from one patch of good grass to another. I
wonder how long it will be before we make our fortunes?</p>

<p>28th.--K. arrived from York with a supply of flour, pork, tea
and sugar. Brings no news from England, or anywhere else. Where
the deuce are all the ships gone to, that we get no letters?
Moved the station to Corbeding.</p>

<p>29th.--K. returned to York with his bullock-cart. No chance of
my being relieved at present. Went out by myself kangarooing. The
pup, Hector, out of Jezebel, will make a splendid dog. First
kangaroo fought like a devil; Hector, fearing nothing, dashed at
him, and got a severe wound in the throat; but returned to the
charge, after looking on for a few moments. Crossed an immense
grassy plain, eight or nine miles wide, without a tree upon it.
Had to carry a kangaroo more than five miles on my back. Wished
it at Hanover, and twice abandoned it, but returned for it again,
being so much in want of fresh meat.</p>

<p>30th.--Spent the day in dreary solitude in the hut. All my
books have been read, re-read, and re-re-read.</p>

<p>July 1st.--Went out with the dogs, and caught three kangaroos.
Passed over some splendid country--wish it were peopled with
white humans. How pleasant to have been able to call at a
cottage, and get a draught of home-brewed! On the contrary, could
not find even a pond, or a pint of water, and was nearly worried
to death by sand-flies.</p>

<p>2d.--Some scabby sheep having got among our flock, have played
the deuce with it. The scab has regularly broke out. I had rather
it were the plague or Asiatic cholera, and cleared them all off
(my own sheep are fortunately at York). Dressing lambs all
morning-- beastly work. In the afternoon went out with the sheep,
and left James to mind the hut. Sand-flies infernal.</p>

<p>3d, Sunday.--Stayed in the hut all day. Smoked sheep-tobacco,*
all my Turkish being finished. Felt pious, and wrote a short
sermon, choosing the text at random--Jeremiah ii. 7: "And I
brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof
and the goodness thereof." Read it at night to the shepherds.
James said it was "slap-up."</p>

<p>[footnote] *Coarse pig-tail, used as a decoction for dressing
the diseased sheep.</p>

<p>4th.--Went out kangarooing. Killed an immense fellow: when
standing on his hind legs fighting with me and the dogs, he was a
foot higher than myself. He ran at me, and nearly gave me a
desperate dig with his claw, which tore my only good
hunting-shirt miserably. Smashed his skull for it.</p>

<p>5th and 6th.--Dressing sheep all day. Out [band of] York
natives, whom we have hitherto kept with us, are all gone home
again, leaving me and my three men, with only two guns, among a
suspicious and treacherous tribe that cannot understand a word we
say to them. Wish my brothers would come and look after their own
sheep. It would do E.'s health more good than sitting in Court,
hearing a set of fools jabber. Sand-flies eat us alive here, and
the mosquitoes polish our bones.</p>

<p>7th.--Muston and myself dressed fifty sheep to-day. John out
with part of the flock.</p>

<p>8th.--Heavy rain last night. Cannot go on dressing. Did
nothing all day.</p>

<p>9th.--Stayed in the hut doing nothing.</p>

<p>10th, Sunday.--Ditto.</p>

<p>11th.--Tired of doing nothing. Dressed sheep most of the day.
Muston out kangarooing; caught three.</p>

<p>12th.--Cooking. Made a "sea-pie," which was generally
admired.</p>

<p>August 1st.--The Doctor arrived from York, driving tandem in
E.'s trap. He has brought me a parcel of books just come from
England. Blessings on my dear sister for remembering me. I
thought myself forgotten by all the world. Sisters (Heaven for
ever bless them!) are the only people that never forget. News
from home! How many thoughts come flooding upon me!</p>

<p>2d.--Last night, I confess, I cried myself to sleep, like a
great big baby. I am very comfortable and contented so long as I
receive no letter from home; and yet I am such a fool as to wish
for them; and when they come I am made miserable for a week
afterwards. Somehow, they make me feel my loneliness more. I feel
deserted, forgotten by all but ONE. She says she is constantly
wishing for me in her rides. They seem to enjoy themselves more
at home than they used to do, now that we are gone--always
picknicking, boating, or forming riding parties. "Fairy"
continues the favourite--I always thought she was a good hack.
"Light-foot," whom I lamed hunting, was obliged to be sold. It
seems to be a sore subject with the Governor. I wonder how Juno
has turned out; she was a splendid-looking whelp. I wish they'd
enter more into particulars when they write. It's ridiculous my
asking questions, as it will be more than a year before answers
can arrive. They ought to write about EVERY THING. I cannot bear
to think to-day of anything but home.</p>

<p>3d.--The Doctor gone back to York--sulky about the sheep being
so bad. Why does he not send us more tobacco and turpentine? Says
we smoke it all. The Doctor is an----. Promises to send K. next
week with mercurial ointment; it is therefore useless to waste
any more tobacco on the sheep--the stock is low enough as it
is.</p>

<p>4th.--Lay all day on my couch, reading "Rose d'Albret." Wish I
had her here. One wants somebody to sympathize with so
desperately in the bush.</p>

<p>5th.--Ditto, ditto.</p>

<p>6th.--Reading Punch all morning. In the afternoon made a
damper, baked it, and eat it in company with the others. "Pit a
cake, pat a cake, baker's man!" etc.</p>

<p>16th.--Dressing sheep all day with mercurial ointment. Wish
this job was over. Dreadful work bending one's back all day, and
rooting amongst the wool for the diseased places.</p>

<p>18th.--Went out with the dogs, and killed two kangaroos. It
rained tremendously all the time, and I wish the kangaroos at
the----. The natives happened to be hunting in a large party,
driving the game before them; and as I stood in the midst of a
large plain which they had surrounded on three sides, multitudes
of kangaroos--I believe I might say thousands--of all sizes, came
rushing past me. The dogs were quite bewildered, and remained at
my side aghast; and it was several minutes before they recovered
themselves enough to give chase. The natives took no notice of
me. In the evening fifty of them came about the hut. We took care
to show our guns, and I shot a green parrot, sixty yards off,
just to show them what we could do. They were quite peaceable,
and danced a corrobery at night.</p>

<p>20th.--I dressed twenty-five sheep this morning myself. In the
afternoon William came from York with six hundred more sheep
(mine among them), which were found to be scabby. More work! This
is really too bad, thrusting all this cursed business upon me. He
had been four days coming, and had not lost a single sheep.</p>

<p>21st.--Went out kangarooing, quite disgusted. Wandered a long
distance, and had to carry a large buck several miles. Could
scarcely find my way back, but at length got home (!!) quite
knocked up, and more and more disgusted with human nature and
every thing.</p>

<p>22d.--The Doctor is enjoying himself at York, and E. lives on
the fat of the land at Perth, whilst I have never tasted anything
but salt pork and kangaroo for many months, and have nothing to
drink but tea. I have almost forgotten the taste of a potato. We
have nothing here but kangaroo and pork, and unleavened bread,
called damper. I wish I could exchange our bill of fare
occasionally with that French fellow who complained of having
"toujours perdrix." He would be the loser, I take it. I could eat
even perdrix aux choux--a villanous dish formerly--but we have no
more cabbages than partridges to thank God for. I have long been
obliged to leave off saying "grace after meat;" it really became
an impious mockery, and was also impolitic and uneconomical, as
my stomach used to turn against it. I consulted John this morning
about killing a sheep, as none of them seemed inclined to die
naturally. John caught at the idea with great quickness. He
really is an intelligent fellow; and both he and the other poor
devils are so patient and unrepining, that the Doctor is little
better than a beast not to order them some mutton occasionally. I
consider it absolutely necessary for their health. We fixed upon
one of E.'s sheep, as it looked the fattest; and he being the
richest, and never coming himself to look at his flock, will not
care about a few sheep more or less. I'd kill one of my own, but
they are such a seedy lot. No one is answerable for the murder of
this sheep but myself, as I hereby confess that I killed it with
my own hand, and afterwards held a coroner's inquest on the body,
directing a verdict of "Visitation of Providence" to be recorded
in the accounts relating to the flock. We had the liver for
supper. Excellent! never tasted anything half so good.</p>

<p>23d.--Dined on sheep's head and trotters. (Tea to drink,
toujours.)</p>

<p>24th.--Saddle of mutton.</p>

<p>25th.--Leg.</p>

<p>26th.--Shoulder.</p>

<p>27th.--Leg.</p>

<p>28th.--Shoulder.</p>

<p>29th.--Finished the sheep, and polished the bones.</p>

<p>[The rest of the Journal runs on much in the same way. This
specimen will probably be enough for the reader.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 22.</h3>

<h4>PELICAN SHOOTING.--GALES.--WRESTLING WITH DEATH.</h4>

<p>The large estuary of the Swan affords ample scope for boating
or sailing in small pleasure-yachts.</p>

<p>Perth water, on the northern bank of which the capital is
built, extends from two to three miles in length, and about the
same distance in its broadest part, its form being that of a half
moon. It is connected with Melville water by an opening of a
quarter of a mile across. Melville water is some six miles long,
and from three to four broad; a splendid bay, called Freshwater
Bay, developes itself at the western extremity of this fine sheet
of water; and the river, or estuary, here makes a turn at right
angles, and pursues its course towards the sea between high
precipitous rocks of marine limestone, which are from six to
seven hundred yards apart.</p>

<p>My pleasure-boat has enabled me to pass many agreeable hours
upon this estuary.</p>

<p>At first, especially, it was exceedingly pleasant to make
expeditions for the purpose of exploring the different bays and
inlets, which abounded with ducks, swans, and pelicans.</p>

<p>My youngest brother and myself would frequently rise at a good
hour, and having supplied our little vessel with a stock of
provisions, and a few bottles of ale or other drinkables, hoist
the sails, and bear away upon a cruise. The warm dry air,
tempered by the sea-breeze, made boating exceedingly pleasant;
and as we often touched at gardens situated at the mouth of the
Canning, or on the shores of Melville water, and procured a
basket of grapes, or peaches and melons, we managed to lunch
luxuriously, having first cast anchor and bathed.</p>

<p>Many readers must have felt the excitement experienced by
young sportsmen when they have the luck to fall in with some bird
or animal not previously known to them. Every one remembers the
delight with which, when a boy, he shot his first wood-pigeon, or
lay in ambush behind a hedge for an old crow.</p>

<p>When first we beheld a group of huge tall birds, standing
lazily in the sunshine upon a sand-spit which ran far into
Melville water, we could scarcely believe our eyes that these
were really live pelicans; and it was not only with intense
interest, but with feelings of self-reproach, that we drew nigh
with hostile intentions to birds which in the days of our
boyhood, when visiting Mr. Wombwell's menagerie, had filled us
with awe and reverence, as creatures that were wont to evince the
depth of parental devotion by feeding their young with their own
blood.</p>

<p>Our first overt act of hostility against the pelicans was
unsuccessful. The sea-breeze was blowing strong, and we had to
beat out against it close-hauled; just as we made the last board,
and were bearing down upon the enemy, the huge, heavy birds,
awakening from the siesta "with a start," raised their heads and
looked about them. Then the foremost began to flap his long
wings, and lift himself on tip-toe, whilst the others followed
his example; and soon they were all heavily skimming along the
surface of the water, trying to launch themselves fairly into the
upward air; and having at length succeeded, they rose higher and
higher in wide gyrations. The leader seemed resolved to hide
himself in the distant blue of the cloudless heavens; and
upward--up, up, up--they continued to mount, going round, and
round, and round, in lessening circles--whilst the spectator
gazed in wonder at the slowly diminishing specks, that were
almost lost in ether; and at length, moving slowly towards the
east --the unknown, mysterious wilderness--they altogether faded
away. We have heard of eagles soaring into the sun, but I doubt
whether even they could soar much higher, or look much grander,
than the noble pelican of the desert.</p>

<p>The sheets were eased off, the long boom of the graceful
sliding-gunter (a kind of latteen) sail, stretched far over the
gun-wale of the boat, which slipped along easily and rapidly
through the water, the rolling waves heaving up her stern, and
sending her forward with a gentle impulse. We were opening the
broad mouth of the Canning, when Meliboeus pointed out two other
pelicans fishing in-shore on the lee-bow. Gently we edged away
towards them; Meliboeus standing before the mast with his
double-barrel ready, and motioning to me how to steer, as the
main-sail hid the birds from my view.</p>

<p>They perceived us, and began to swim along shore at a rapid
rate; the water was shoaling fast, and we greatly feared they
would escape, but still we held on. The majestic birds rose
slowly from the water, one following the other, and made towards
the Canning. "I'll let fly at them" cried Meliboeus, in an
intense whisper, "luff up!-- hard-a-lee!" The helm was jammed
down, and the sheet hauled in; the boat luffed into the wind, and
became stationary, only bobbing upon the waves, whilst her sails
shivered and rattled in the breeze. Meliboeus fired--and the
hindmost bird declined gradually towards the water; its long
wings became fixed and motionless at their widest stretch, and
slowly it sank down upon its heaving death-bed. Loud shouted the
sportsman; and momentary envy filled the heart of him who
steered.</p>

<p>Away goes the boat before the freshening breeze, and soon it
dashes past the body of the pelican, which is seized by the ready
Meliboeus, and with great difficulty hauled on board. A shot had
penetrated to its brain and killed it instantaneously. The wind
up the Canning was nearly abeam, and we dashed through the deep
and narrow passage called Hell's Gates, and held on till we came
to the foot of a steep and rounded hill, Mount Henry. The river
here turns at right angles, sweeping round the base of the hill,
and leaving a broad and deep bay called Bull's Creek, to the
southward. This is a famous spot for ducks and swans, and many a
pleasant bivouac have I formed near it, waiting for early morn
when the birds are busy feeding. As we rounded Mount Henry, we
observed a large slate-coloured bird lazily flying across the
river ahead of us. The Canning is here about four hundred yards
broad, widening occasionally to a quarter of a mile. The wind was
now right aft, and we soon came upon the line of the bird, which
appeared to be a crested crane. The boom was topped-up in a
moment, the jib-sheet let fly, and the boat's nose ran crashing
through the sedges which in this part fringed the bank. The crane
had alighted on the very summit of a straight and lofty tree, and
there she sat, unconscious of the danger at hand.</p>

<p>Too much excited to care for any obstacles, and with eyes ever
fixed upon the game, I tore my way through brambles, thickets,
water and mud, until with no little difficulty I arrived at
ground free from underwood. The bird was still sitting patiently
on her lofty perch, and my heart beat anxiously with hope that I
should be able to creep within shot. What a moment of interest!
It is still vivid in the memory, with all its doubts and fears
and wildly-beating hopes. The crane seemed preparing to fly.
Death! I felt nearly distracted with apprehension. The interest
and excitement became intense. I crept from tree to tree, and
whenever I thought I was observed, stood motionless. My eye-balls
became dry and hard with incessant gazing. I feared to wink lest
she should be gone. She extended her wings! I bounded forward.
She was just off, and barely within reach, as I fired; a single
number two shot struck her pinion, and down she tumbled to the
ground with a glorious wallop.</p>

<p>A loud shout from Meliboeus, who had sat in the boat scarcely
daring to breathe, proclaimed the presence of a witness to my
triumph.</p>

<p>Since then I have shot cranes without emotion or much feeling
of interest.</p>

<p>Boating, as an amusement, ought only to be followed during the
summer months, from the 1st of October to the 1st of April. In
the winter season there are extremely violent gales of wind from
the north-west, that sometimes last for three days together.
Their arrival is generally foretold by the rapid falling of the
barometer; and at Perth it is almost always preceded by the
rising of the estuary. A singular storm visited the district of
Australind in the night of the 17th June, 1842. It crossed the
Leschenault estuary, and entered the forest, making a lane
through the trees from three to four hundred yards wide. In this
lane, which extended for many miles, nothing was left standing
but the stumps of trees; whilst the trees on either wide of the
land stood up like a wall and were perfectly uninjured. The storm
in its course, which was in a direct line from N.W. to S.E.
levelled the trees in the valleys as well as those on the hills.
Its effects were not like those of a whirlwind, when trees appear
twisted round, and scattered in every direction; in this lane the
young healthy trees, which were generally broken off about two or
three yards from the ground, all lay in the same direction.</p>

<p>Twice have I nearly paid dearly for my rashness in boating. My
boat was once capsized in a moment in a squall, and Hannibal and
myself were soused in the water before we knew what had happened.
I caught hold of the bilge of the boat, and nearly drowned myself
with laughing at the Son of Amilcar, who was splashing about
shrieking with terror, and swallowing quarts of salt-water, as
his open mouth popped every moment under a wave. In vain I called
to him to come to me, and lay hold of the boat; he could neither
see nor hear, and would have soon joined his illustrious namesake
in the Elysian fields, had I not managed to throw the bight of a
rope round his neck, and towed him within reach, when I held him
up by the collar of his jacket (ducking him under water
occasionally to make him cease from howling) until we were
rescued by a fishing-boat.</p>

<p>One day, the 11th April, 1843, feeling disposed to take my
book on the water and enjoy the calm air, I embarked by myself--a
most unusual occurrence, as I scarcely ever went out alone. What
little wind there was blew down the estuary, but only gently
ruffled the waters; and my boat glided noiselessly before it. A
couple of hours took me to the farther extremity of Melville
water, and here it fell calm. I now began to feel uncomfortable,
for the air was close, and dark clouds appeared rising in the
north-west. The wind began to blow in gusts; a sudden puff,
curling the waters, would strike the boat and make her heel over
until her gunwale kissed the wave, as with a sudden start she
rushed forward under the impulse of the blast. I was now making
homeward. The heavens became black with angry clouds; the wind
first sighed and moaned like a reluctant Spirit driven forth to
fulfil its task of evil, feeling something of remorse at crimes
foreshadowed and inevitable; and then working itself into fury,
as though it would stifle thought, and crush out the germ of
pity, the Wind in its might and rage rushed roaring over the
waters, making the foam fly before it, and tearing up the face of
the estuary into rugged lines of wild tumultuous waves. The
little bark vainly strove to keep her head to the storm, which
bore her down until the water poured over the gunwale.</p>

<p>It was about six o'clock in the evening, and darkness, hurried
on prematurely by the tempest, spread suddenly around. The waves,
as if trying to leap beyond the reach of some internal agony,
rolled high above my head, as the "Fair Maid of Perth" sank
hopelessly in the deep channel, with rocking mast and shivering
sails. But not yet submerged, she rose again, and fronted the
storm, struggling desperately to reach the northern shore, which
was not far distant. But the skies grew blacker still; the storm
became a hurricane; the wind roared so loud that no voice of
human agony or despair might be heard above its tremendous fury;
the waves grew higher and mightier, and became rushing hills of
water, overwhelming, irresistible. To me, quailing in my frail
bark, in all the consciousness of helplessness and ruin, it
seemed as though the winds and the waves were really sentient
beings combining to overwhelm me, and increasing their efforts
the more I struggled.</p>

<p>This is no fiction that I am relating, but a reality that
happened to myself, and which it would be impossible to
exaggerate. Never shall I forget the last tremendous wave that
came down upon me, impelled by a maddening gust which whirled
tearing along through the wild air, and scooping its deep passage
through the waters. In vain was the jib-sheet let fly; in vain
did I luff into the wind. I could not quit the helm, and
therefore was unable to lower the sail which in that hurricane
could not have been got in easily, and in the meantime the boat,
breaking off from the wind, would have been swamped. I was so
near the shore that I hoped still to reach it, the wind being
abeam, in the course of a few minutes. But nothing could
withstand the last wave and blast. The boat lurched, and broke
off. Hurled on her beam-ends, the boom was in the water; the
waves rushed over the side; she struggled bravely, and tried to
right herself; but after staggering forwards a few seconds, the
weight of the in-rushing water bore her down, and she slowly fell
over on her side. The sensation was by no means pleasant. I felt
her going, without being able to prevent it. I glanced around for
aid or hope; but there was neither. I could see nothing but
waves, and hear nothing but the roaring blast. The shore was
close to me, but the high waves, and the darkness of the
hurricane, prevented my discerning even the tops of the trees. As
the boat capsized, I kicked off my shoes and threw off my coat
and waistcoat, and seizing the main-sheet, let myself down in the
water, trying to find bottom, but there was none within
reach.</p>

<p>I struck out towards the shore, but the ablest swimmer that
ever swam could have made no progress against that sea, and I
could scarcely swim at all.</p>

<p>I scrambled back to the boat, which now lay on her side, level
with the surface. On getting upon her, you may conceive--but no!
you cannot--the horror of the moment, as I felt her gradually go
down --sink, sinking beneath me. All now seemed over. My time had
arrived; my last moment was come. I collected my thoughts, and
prepared for it.</p>

<p>I did not feel so much terror as I should have anticipated in
such a scene. Death seemed inevitable, and I nerved myself, and
prayed. All the past did NOT press upon me at this moment, in
this death- struggle, as some readers may imagine. I thought not
of my sins, nor of my friends, nor of time misspent and work left
undone--my whole mind was absorbed in the sense of DEATH and
FUTURITY. The glances, rather than the thoughts which shot across
my soul, seemed like revealings of immortality. My sensations
were mixed of horror and hope; the CHANGE from the old to the new
Life seemed beginning within me. It might have been excess of
terror, but I did not feel terrified. I felt that all was over,
and there was no room for the anguish that arises from doubt. All
struggling was vain, and though in tumult and horror, I yet felt
resigned. The World of Time was past, and new being was at
hand.</p>

<p>Such is the memory which I must ever bear of the hour when
(yet vigorous and full of Life) I was held in the arms of
Death.</p>

<p>The boat went down. The waves rushed over me; the enemy held
me by the throat, and seemed to press me into the opening grave.
Even as the light faded from my eyes, and the Spirit waited for
that quick, sharp touch of the dart which should free it from the
bonds of mortal life, I perceived the stem of the boat rising
slowly out of the waves, whilst the stern was borne down by my
weight.</p>

<p>Instinctively I swam forward, and got upon another part of the
boat. Down it went again; and as the water dashed against my
face, I saw the stern now rising up, whilst the stem plunged down
into the depths below. I scrambled amidships; the sea and the
wind struck her, and she rolled heavily over, righting herself
for a moment, with her mast and sail erect; but soon she lay on
her larboard side, deep in the water. I had been washed off her,
but clung to the main-sheet, and so got back again. I now held on
to the side with one hand, whilst I managed to strip off all my
clothes except my shirt and flannel waistcoat, first taking my
knife out of my pocket. With this I tried to cut away the stays
which held the mast in its place, hoping that it would then fall
out, and relieve the boat of the sails which weighed her down so
low in the water. Most fortunately I had not sand-ballast, in
tarred bags, as most of our pleasure-boats had, but water-ballast
in breakers, which now proved no additional burthen to the boat.
It was also fortunate that she was built partly of deal, and had
only her lower streaks of jarra wood, which does not float.</p>

<p>The blade of the knife, which was only a pen-knife, soon
broke, and I was obliged to give up the attempt to remove the
sails. Still the hurricane blew on, wild and terrible as ever;
the spray washed over me like rain; the waves dashed me
repeatedly from the boat, which was whirled and tossed about in a
strange manner; sometimes rolling completely over, sometimes
going down head, and sometimes stern foremost, I had to scramble
from part to part, and exercise a good deal of agility in saving
myself from being struck by the gunwale, or by the boom and sail,
as they rose from the water and fell back again.</p>

<p>And now I could see but small prospect of being eventually
saved. The only chance was that the boat would drift, in the
course of time, across the estuary, here nearly four miles broad.
Then I tried, and for a long time vainly, to ascertain whether
she drifted at all. The anchor, with about five-and-twenty feet
of cable, had doubtless fallen out, and the boat was probably
stationary. Night had set in, and it was too dark to distinguish
even the shore with its forest of trees. These gales sometimes
continue three days, and I knew it would be impossible to exist
many hours immersed in water. I dreaded lest I should become
benumbed and unable to hold on to the boat.</p>

<p>In order to keep up circulation as much as possible, I shouted
aloud, and rubbed my breast and thighs with my disengaged
hand.</p>

<p>Some dark object was on the water near me. It moved; it came
quickly towards me. I could just discern that it was a whale-boat
containing several men. It had no sails or oars, yet it flew
before the blast. I shouted and screamed as it went by, not
twenty yards from me; and the men turned their heads and waved
their arms, and doubtless answered, but the gale roared with
unabated fury, the waves intercepted them from my sight, and I
could not hear their voices.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *These men were about a mile and a half astern of
me, when the hurricane began, and tried to pull in shore; but
just as they thought to have reached it, one of their oars broke,
and being now helpless, they were obliged to scud before the
wind. By good fortune they were carried up the Canning, where
they remained all night.</p>

<p>The moon had now risen, and the clouds were partially
dispersed, so that I could at length distinguish the woods on the
weather-shore; and I could see the weary waste of waters over
which I must drift before I could possibly be saved.</p>

<p>Sometimes the wind blew with lessened violence, and I could
sit upon the submerged bilge of the boat, and consider my state
and prospects. After long observation, I felt assured that the
boat did really drift, but it was very slowly; and I feared that
as we approached the other shore, her anchor must inevitably
bring her up in twenty-five feet water, and that nothing could
save me from perishing of cold. It never occurred to me during
this memorable night, that when I set sail in the afternoon I had
shortened the cable to about five feet in length, in order the
more easily to trip the anchor. This was one of the
circumstances, providentially ordered, that tended to save my
life.</p>

<p>Some miles down the estuary I could distinguish a light in the
house at Point Walter, high placed on a steep bank; there two of
my friends were at that moment carousing, whilst I was being
buffetted by waves and tempest, and fearing that the saturated
sails and heavy wood at length would sink the unfortunate boat to
the bottom. I yet could scarcely hope to escape; my mind was
still made up to die, and I tranquilly awaited the event.</p>

<p>The moon had now made half of her journey across the heavens;
the wind had moderated, and I redoubled my exertions to keep off
the cold by shouting and rubbing myself. My flannel-shirt was
another instrument of safety to me. It felt warm to my body
though the waves poured continually over it.</p>

<p>The outline of the forest on the lee side of the estuary was
now distinguishable, and hope would have been rife within me but
for the expectation of finding myself anchored fast at a fatal
distance from the shore.</p>

<p>Every thing appeared so indistinct in the gloom of the night,
that I could not guess how far I was from land; and it was with
surprise, as well as delight and gratitude, that I felt the boat
bump against the sand. Oh that first bump, which told me of
safety and deliverance after five hours of incessant peril! Shall
I ever forget the thrill of delight which it gave me? I could
scarcely credit my senses, and put down my benumbed feet with
doubt; but they rested on the sand-- real, hard, blessed terra
firma! and without delay I waded through the water to the
beach.</p>

<p>The wind had now fallen, and it began to rain.</p>

<p>I was on the edge of a thick wilderness of forest, without any
house within reach--the nearest was some miles distant, and to
reach it in the dark, and without shoes, through swamps and
thickets was almost impossible.</p>

<p>The Canning River was about half-a-mile from me, and on the
farther side of it was a settler's house; but though I might
reach the bank of the river, I could not hope to make myself
heard half a mile off, amid the howling of the dying storm, and
by people fast asleep. There was nothing for it, therefore, but
to make myself as comfortable as possible, and remain where I was
until morning. Fortunately, I recollected having seen the ruins
of a goat-shed not far distant, when I had landed on this spot
with my gun two or three months before. With some difficulty, and
some pain to my feet from thorns, I discovered this relic of a
hovel. Part of the roof was yet entire, and sheltered me from the
wind.</p>

<p>The door was lying inside, and this I made my bed. Then,
having wrung out my shirt and flannel-waistcoat, and returned
thanks to the Almighty for preserving a life not, perhaps,
sufficiently prized by the owner, I lay down completely exhausted
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Awaking at daylight, I started off through the woods, stiff
and hoarse with cold, but light of heart; and having reached the
Canning, succeeded at last in making myself heard by the farmer
opposite, who took me across in his boat, breakfasted me, and
lent me his clothes, and finally conveyed me to Perth, where I
found my friends preparing to go in search of my body.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 23.</h3>

<h4>THE DESERT OF AUSTRALIA.--CAUSE OF THE HOT
WINDS.--GEOLOGY.</h4>

<p>I intend in this chapter* to give an explanation of the cause
of the hot-winds of Australia; to throw out a suggestion on the
most likely mode of prosecuting discovery towards the interior;
and to conclude with a slight sketch of the geology of the
colony. Before doing this I shall give a brief account of a
journey made by myself and Mr. Maxwell Lefroy in search of the
inland sea so often talked of, and which a native promised to
show to us; so large, he said, that when he stood on one shore he
could not see the other. Although this sea turned out to be a
pure fiction, the journey was not entirely useless, nor
altogether uninteresting. As this sea was probably not more than
200 miles distant from York, according to the reckoning of the
native, who said it was "ten sleeps off," I judged that one
month's provision would be sufficient.</p>

<p>[footnote] *This chapter I owe to Mr. Henry Landor.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mr. Lefroy and myself started on the expedition,
on horseback, taking with us a native boy, and a pack-horse
loaded with flour, tea, and sugar, and other necessaries. It will
be sufficient to state that we pursued a south-east course,
crossing the Hotham, the Williams, and the Arthur rivers, and
traversing an indifferent country, but in many places fit for
sheep-grazing, before we came to the lake, or sea, of which we
were in search. When we arrived at it, we were disappointed to
find it not more than six miles long, although the natives, with
their usual amount of exaggeration, had increased it to an
illimitable ocean. Before descending from the high land to the
plain in which the lakes are situated, we caught a distant
glimpse of what appeared to be a grand and broad river, pursuing
a winding course through a magnificently wooded valley, with its
clear bright waters dwindling in the distance to a silvery
thread. A nearer examination, however, dispelled the illusion,
and the beautiful river turned out to be nothing more than a
chain of shallow lakes, situated in a woody valley; and only in
very wet seasons flowing from one to another.</p>

<p>We determined to follow the chain of lakes eastward, so long
as our provisions should last, or as long as our horses could
find food for themselves. We proceeded east for six days, passing
numberless lakes, and observing that the chain divided, one
branch of lakes running north-east, and the other due east. We
followed the latter until we came to a lake called Dambeling, by
far the largest we had seen, being about fifteen miles long by
seven or eight wide, with a good sheep country on its northern
bank, and a river, which we called the Lefroy, falling into its
eastern end. The river was about thirty yards wide, with a clayey
bed, and large fresh-water pools, and flowed from the east,
through the worst country we had seen, it being an apparently
endless desert, and level to the horizon. We went one day's
journey into this inhospitable country, but the want of food for
our horses, and our own unprepared state, prevented us from
penetrating farther. On our return, we went for two or three days
north, on the outskirts of the desert, before we turned westward
on our way back to York.</p>

<p>The only land we crossed in this expedition was situated on
the head of the Hotham and Williams. The area of this country is
undoubtedly very great, but its average character is below the
York district, although it is well adapted for sheep-grazing.</p>

<p>But the most interesting feature is the barren and desolate
country to the east of Lake Dambeling, doubtless a continuation
of the same sterile country seen by Mr. Roe, the
surveyor-General, east of York many years previously; and
probably from Mr. Eyre's observation, extending quite down to the
southern coast. We had no means of ascertaining the width of this
dreary country, but we did not think it could be impassably wide
because the river Lefroy appeared to come across it. This river,
in a geographical point of view, may be important, as the
character of its bed, without trees, more water-worn than the
other rivers of the colony, its size, and the direction from
which it comes, render it exceedingly interesting to determine
how it is supplied. The sandy nature of the country on its banks,
and for many miles east, and the flatness of the country,
preclude the idea that it receives its supply of water from the
immediately surrounding district. It must either be supplied by a
country of a far better character to the eastward, or it is the
outlet of another and larger lake far in the interior. From the
natives we could learn nothing but that there were no kangaroos,
no opossums, and no water to the east; but as their knowledge
never extends 100 miles, and they would tell any lie to avoid
going where they had no inclination to go, their opinions are
worthless. It might be worth the while of the colony to send
forth another expedition to determine the boundaries of this
desolate country, as it is not improbable that a practicable rout
might be discovered to South Australia by means of the river and
lakes.</p>

<p>The outlet of the lakes is into the river Beaufort, and
possibly also into the Gordon. There is no doubt that in
exceedingly wet seasons the whole valley is one continuous
stream, when all the lakes would be united and present a truly
magnificent appearance; but as the area of evaporation is so
large, and the banks of many of the lakes are high, the quantity
of rain must be enormous before the valley becomes filled with a
running river. Lake Barbering, where the valley divides, has a
steep shore, with three distinct marks of former water-levels.
All the lakes have two or more shores, showing either a decrease
of rain or an elevation of the land itself, probably both.
Between the present and ancient shores there is a belt of
swamp-oaks and tea-trees, which show that some length of time has
elapsed since the water left its old levels.</p>

<p>The water to fill these large reservoirs must come down the
river Lefroy, as the neighbouring country is too sandy to supply
it in sufficient quantities.</p>

<p>No question in geography has presented a wider field for
conjecture than the much-debated one of the nature of the
interior of Australia. Is it desert, or water, or pasture?
inhabited, or destitute alike of animal and vegetable life? The
explorations of Captain Sturt, and the journey of Mr. Eyre, would
incline us to believe that the country is one vast sterile waste;
but the journey of the latter is worth nothing as an attempt to
expose the nature of the interior, since he never left the coast.
It certainly shows how much suffering the human frame can endure;
and whilst, as illustrative of Australian geography, it is
valueless, it is highly creditable to the energies of the
traveller.</p>

<p>The expedition of Captain Sturt has shown that to the north of
South Australia the country is chiefly desert, totally incapable
of supporting animal life: while the geological specimens of that
traveller prove that the rich mineral strata of South Australia
extend far beyond the pastoral boundaries of the colony. A
reference to the journey of Mr. Lefroy and myself, from York to
the south-east, will show that there exists a low level country
running far beyond our farthest eastern point, which may afford
abundance of water and pasture for any future expedition
proceeding in that direction.</p>

<p>An expedition starting from these lakes in the BEGINNING OF
WINTER, so as to take advantage of the first supplies of water,
might advance far enough into the interior to discover at least
the possibility of proceeding before the succeeding summer would
render it impossible to return; for the lakes alone would not be
sufficient to ensure a supply of good drinkable water during the
summer, as they generally become quite salt long before summer is
over. It would be necessary to find a good deep water-hole for
the party to remain at during the dry season, and from which they
could push out small lateral expeditions as a sort of foundation
for the next season's main advance. Expeditions in Australia
require great circumspection. It is not the most rapid traveller
who will get the farthest, but the most prudent and cautious. I
consider it quite possible to get across the island, either to
South Australia or to Port Essington. Most probably it would be
easier to get to the latter than the former.</p>

<p>From observations made on the rains and winds in Western
Australia, and careful inquiries on the same subjects when I was
in South Australia, and on a comparison of the two, I am inclined
to believe that the climates of the two colonies assimilate. A
wet winter in one is a wet winter in the other. Both receive
their rains when the wind blows from the north-west to
south-west. Thus the rains from South Australia pass from the
Indian Ocean over Western Australia, and the whole island, to
South Australia. The hot wind of Western Australia blows from the
north-east; and, in fact, the hot wind of both colonies comes
from the same portion of the great island. That which is the hot
wind in summer in Western Australia is the cold wind in winter;
and the same in South Australia. The reason is obvious. It is
evident, from the fact that South Australia receives its rain
from the Indian Ocean, that there are no mountains in the
interior of sufficient elevation to intercept the clouds; that
there are no mountains in the interior, is shown also by the
absence of rivers emptying themselves into the ocean. From the
observation of Mr. Lefroy and myself, we were led to suppose that
the interior consisted for the most part of immense clay plains;
the lower portion of these plains being hollowed into the large
shallow lakes we meet with in our journey. Where the country is a
little more elevated the plains are sand instead of clay. In
winter these plains are covered with water, as the drifted leaves
on the bushes testify; and the marks of water on the surface are
very evident. Now, when the winter winds pass over these immense
masses of water, the great evaporation renders them intensely
cold; and they arrive in the colony laden, (if I may so
unphilosophically express it,) with cold, caused by rapid
evaporation. In summer these very plains are equally the cause of
the hot wind; for when the rains cease, and the sun acquires his
summer power, the water is quickly evaporated, the clay becomes
baked, and the heat is reflected from the hard heated surface
quite sufficiently to raise a thermometer to 110 degrees in the
shade. The wind is now driven towards the colony laden with heat
from the cracked, baked, clay-plains in the interior; and thus it
is, that at different seasons the same country produces such
opposite effects. But although the general state of the interior
is barren and unproductive, as I imagine, I do not suppose that
it is entirely so. I believe there are many cases of good pasture
land in the midst of this sterile country; fertile spots, small
when compared with the vast area of indifferent country around
them, but large in themselves. And these pastoral oases are more
cultivated than the worthless land amid which they are placed. In
these patches of good land there are always water-holes to be
found, and water-courses well marked, conducting the surplus
waters to the lakes in the clay plains. That there are such
fertile spots in the Australian deserts is certain, for I have
seen many of them myself, and they are mentioned also by the
South Australian travellers. The similarity in most respects of
vegetation in Western Australia and in South Australia, and the
identity of many plants, proves also a country of good quality
lying between the two colonies; by which such plants were
conveyed from one country to the other. Thus, the so called
white-gum is the same tree in both colonies; the mungat, or
raspberry-jam tree, is common to both; and also to the plains of
New England, in New South Wales, where (I understand) it acquires
a larger size than in Western Australia. The manch is another
tree also common to the two colonies; so is the black-wattle. The
grasses are many of them alike. But this similarity is not
confined only to the vegetable kingdom. The birds and animals are
many of them also alike. The white and the black cockatoo are
common to the three colonies, as are many kinds of the smaller
parrots, the kangaroo, and the kangaroo-rat, the numbat, the
opossum, the native cat, and many others. And this is not only
true of animals of great locomotion, or birds of long flight, as
the pigeon or cockatoo, but equally so of the opossum, the quail,
and the wild-turkey. The quail and the turkey are birds chiefly
found in grassy lands, and neither fly to any great distance: at
least the quail never does; the turkey will when much disturbed,
but not otherwise. Also the water animals, as the tortoise, are
to be found in both colonies; but not the platypus, which is
confined to the country east of the great river Murrumbidgee and
its tributary the Darling.</p>

<p>The natives are also alike in feature and habits, evidently
the same race, with language similar in character, in both
countries, with similar weapons and methods of procuring food;
having also similar customs and laws.</p>

<p>Now, I infer from these facts, that the population, animal as
well as vegetable, proceeded from one country to the other; and
that many forms of vegetation in the two colonies possess no
greater difference, than the difference of soil and latitude may
account for; and that it may therefore be possible for men to
find a route from one country to the other, by carefully noting
and following the lay of the water-courses, the direction of the
oases, and the nature of the geology of the country; for that no
impenetrable desert exists between the countries, is evident from
the passage of vegetables and animals from the one to the other.
What will be the benefit, some one may ask, when such a route is
discovered? Why, independent of the knowledge gained to
geography, there will be the great practical good of opening the
boundless pastures of Western Australia to the flocks of the
already overstocked lands of the other colonies. To Western
Australia the gain would be great; and to South Australia it
would be equally advantageous, as it would maintain the value of
stock there, which will rapidly fall when no more land can be
found fit for occupation. Even with all the rapid increase of
population which the great mineral abundance of that colony will
continue to create, sheep will multiply faster than the
population, until they become of the same low value as in New
South Wales, where, if there be no run sold with them, they are
not worth more than the value of the wool on their backs.</p>

<p>It is therefore most desirable that attempts should be made to
find a stock route from the western to the eastern coasts.</p>

<p>Intra-tropical Australia is more abundantly supplied with
rivers, and of a larger magnitude, than any out of the tropics,
the Murray alone excepted; and doubtless a journey across the
island within the tropic would present fewer difficulties than
one direct from Perth to Sydney, or Adelaide; but, excepting for
the advancement of geographical knowledge, there is no object to
be gained by such a journey. The best way is along the valley of
the lakes, guided as the party proceeds, by the nature of the
country.</p>

<p>I earnestly hope that an expedition will be sent to make some
effort to penetrate the great extent of an unknown country, lying
east of Western Australia, as it is an object well worth the
attention of the Government, or of the Geographical Society.</p>

<p>The geology of Western Australia is not very interesting, as
the country is entirely of primary formation to the east of the
Darling range of hills: the granite every where crowning the
summit of the hills, and the immense plains consisting entirely
of granitic sand, or of hard clay containing nodules of primary
rocks. This formation, which does not in Western Australia
consist of the stratified primary series, as in South Australia,
cannot be expected to yield the abundant mineral riches that the
strata of South Australia exhibit. Probably gold may be met with,
and copper and lead may be found in the Koikunenup Range, which
is not entirely a granitic range, but is, I believe, capped with
clay slate. The level country lying between the Darling hills and
the sea is of a much more recent formation; but has not been
sufficiently examined to determine its age precisely, though I
imagine it will be found to belong to the pliocene tertiary
formations. Certainly it contains many shells of species now
living in the neighbouring ocean; and the limestone ridge running
parallel with and close to the coast, and which in the colony is
falsely called magnesian limestone, contains a great proportion
of modern shells. The country lying between the hills and the sea
contains many beds of lignite; one of which, at Nornalup, on the
south coast, is more than two feet thick, and shows itself on the
face of the cliff on the north shore of the estuary. Following
the line of coast in any part of Australia, the geologist cannot
fail to be much struck by the evident marks of a gradual
elevation of the land; he will every where see the marks of the
sea on the cliffs, at a considerable height above its present
level. At Cape Chatham, on the south coast, these sea-marks are
visible 300 feet above the present level of the ocean; and can be
seen on the face of the rocks, in the hills at some distance from
the coast. On my journey to Nornalup, I discovered a lake
containing shells in abundance, which appeared to me, and were
also considered by the late Dr. Hinds (Surgeon, Royal Navy) a
skilful conchologist, to be a littoral species, common to the
shores of various parts of the globe. These shells, of no
interest in themselves, become excessively interesting as
evidence of a connexion once existing between this lake and the
ocean, from which it is now at least forty miles distant. This
lake is not more than 100 feet above the present level of the
ocean, and entirely separated from any other lake or river. How,
therefore, could these marine shell-fish be living in a salt
lake, unless they had continued to exist there from the period
when it was a portion of the ocean itself? That many generations
of them had lived and died in this spot, was quite certain, from
the abundance of dead shells on the shores of this very
interesting lake. Nor is the evidence of elevation confined to
the coast; all the lakes seen by Mr. Lefroy and myself have
ancient shores much higher than the present waters ever reach.
The same evidence of elevation is to be seen in the harbour of
Sydney, and in Spencer's Gulf, in South Australia. At the head of
the latter the shingle and rolled-stones clearly show that the
gulf has formerly run much farther inland: probably to Lake
Torrens, the superfluous waters of which are now discharged into
the head of the gulf. The whole plain of the Murrumbidgee has
been, at not a very distant date, beneath the ocean; as the
Madrepores, and other fossils in the limestone cliffs of the
river testify. Earthquakes have been felt in South Australia
since its settlement. A very intelligent gentleman there told me
that he had noted eleven since his arrival; quite perceptible
enough to leave no doubt as to their character. Probably the
country was elevated at each shock, in a slight degree; and
perhaps before the volcano of Mount Gambier became extinct the
elevatory movements were more rapid. Be that as it may, I am
quite convinced that they are going on at this moment; and it
would be well to make marks on the cliffs in various parts of the
coast, at the present sea-level, in order to determine, after the
lapse of years, the rate of elevation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 24.</h3>

<h4>COLONIAL GOVERNMENT.</h4>

<p>We have already observed that a vast deal of discontent
prevails in colonies. With all the natural advantages of a
fruitful soil and a heavenly climate, colonists are always
dissatisfied with their position; because, in a pecuniary point
of view, they are always poor. And why are they so? The answer is
a startling one. The excess of their abundance is the first cause
of their poverty; the instability of their government, the
second. They possess more than they can dispose of, and are borne
down by the weight of their possessions. Place the markets of
England and the labour of Ireland within their reach, and they
would become millionaires were they to cease to be colonists; but
so long as they continue to be colonists, governed by a Power
altogether distinct from that which rules over Englishmen in
their native land, they will continue to be helpless, oppressed,
and poverty-stricken.</p>

<p>They alone, among British subjects, are living under an
absolute Monarchy; the caprices of which render property insecure
and of uncertain value; neutralizing industry, paralyzing
enterprise, and crushing with fatal authority the energies and
the spirits of the people.</p>

<p>In the absolute recklessness of colonial rule, no sooner does
private enterprise raise its head, and throw out the first
feelers on the way to wealth, than a watchful government steps
forward, and careful only to secure gain to itself, crushes out
(in the first feebleness of existence,) the germ of vitality.</p>

<p>In all new countries in which the sources of wealth are
imperfectly developed, the expense of applying the means
necessary to their development is so enormous, as to leave but
small profit to the speculator. Labour is always dear in new
countries, where there is so large an outlet afforded to the
labourer to escape from the toils of servitude, and become
himself an occupant or an owner of the soil. All that he gains by
the exchange is an ideal independence; which is, unhappily, but
too attractive to the uneasy spirit of modern improvement.</p>

<p>The prosperity of a colony is the aggregate of individual
wealth. the prosperous advance of the colonist, is, therefore,
the first duty of a superintending Government. But the first aim
of that watchful guardian is ever to wring from the settler as
much as may be extracted by pressure. The lowest demand for land,
which would be dear at half-a-crown an acre, is eight times that
amount. No sooner does the settler, by his science or industry,
discover some lucrative opening, than government steps in with
its restrictions, its taxes and duties, and at once cuts down the
budding promise. If the design be to bring to light the mineral
wealth of the country, royalties are immediately imposed; and no
chance of profit is left to the speculator when the rents are
raised according to the probabilities of success. It is the same
with all other speculations; no one will embark, even in a
timber-trade, when he knows that he is placing his capital at the
mercy of a grasping and short-sighted Government.</p>

<p>How much more lucrative, and how much more statesman-like
would it prove, were our rulers to display as much good policy as
the peasants of Norfolk, who do not pluck their geese until they
be well feathered! Colonists, like cabbages, should be allowed to
acquire the necessary strength, and attain the proper dimensions,
before they be seriously operated upon. You might then cut and
nick them with reasonable hope of their sprouting forth anew.</p>

<p>But the worst evil of an absolute Government arises from the
destruction in the minds of the people of all faith and
confidence in its truth and honour.</p>

<p>One Secretary of State countermands the edicts of his
predecessor; and as the Executive Government of a colony is
composed of the paid servants of the Crown, and is merely the
machine of the Secretary for the time being, the ordinances which
it promulgates are distinguished by only one uniform feature--the
announcement of broken promises and betrayed faith.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of colonies, disappointed and deceived, have
no trust in their rulers, and dare not invest their capital in
enterprises which may be ruined in a moment by an arbitrary
edict. At one period, for instance, they may have been induced,
upon the faith of the Government, to purchase remission tickets,
which entitle the owner to a certain quantity of land wherever he
may choose to select it. A succeeding Government confines this
right of selection within certain narrow limits; whilst another
decides that the holder shall be allowed to purchase with these
tickets only land that is entirely valueless. At one period men
are encouraged to attempt the production of colonial spirits; but
no sooner is a large amount of capital expended, than it is made
illegal to distil. Some parties are permitted to purchase land at
a distance from the capital: and after years of toil and expense
are deprived of all protection from the Government, and allowed
no compensation for its withdrawal.</p>

<p>But it were vain to attempt to enumerate the acts of broken
faith on the part of an absolute Government, from whose decree
there is no appeal, and from whose oppression no redress. The
moral evil to colonies is crushing and fatal.</p>

<p>The best informed among English statesmen know nothing of
colonies: but their hardihood in legislating for them is,
unhappily, equal to their ignorance. It was only last year (1846)
that the bill for the government of Western Australia was
(according to newspaper report) opposed in the House of Lords by
a noble duke, on the ground, as his grace alleged in an animated
and interesting speech, of the wretchedly immoral state of the
colony, arising from the system of transportation, which so
deluged the country with convicts that it was now a perfect hell
upon earth! A noble lord, then Under-secretary for the Colonies,
apologised, with the best grace he could assume, for this
lamentable state of things, and assured the noble duke that the
Government was quite aware of the evil, and was turning its
attention to a remedy for it. Had any one of the noble lords
present known anything at all about the subject of the debate, he
might in a few words have relieved the anxiety of the Government,
by informing it that Western Australia is not, and never has
been, a penal settlement--that convicts are not sent thither for
punishment; that even a single bush-ranger has never been known
within the territory; and that, in the words of an Adelaide
journal, "it is as free from stain as any of the rural districts
of England."</p>

<p>Another Australian colony (that of Port Phillip) calls for the
attention of Government more imperatively, perhaps, than any
other of these settlements. At present an appendage to Sydney,
but situated at a most inconvenient distance from that capital,
it is compelled to remit thither between fifty and one hundred
thousand pounds annually for rates, taxes, and duties, not a
tithe of which ever finds its way back again. It is deprived of
roads, bridges, and all public works of importance, solely
because it is friendless at home, voiceless and unrepresented.
Might Englishmen be made to feel that interest in colonies which
in general they are ever ready to accord to the unfortunate, they
would glow with indignation at the wrongs, the injustice, and the
oppression under which the inhabitants of distant settlements
bend in silence. "If you don't keep your colonies in a state of
dependence," are the memorable words of Lord Stanley, in May,
1846, "of what use are they?" Such has ever been the
narrow-minded and unstatesman-like policy of the British
Government. And yet even the infant colonies of the empire,
though fettered, cramped, and swathed like the young progeny of
the Esquimaux, are useful still to the Mother Country. They
afford the best market for her produce; and when freed from the
pressure of their bonds, like plants released from the torturing
confinement of their earthenware prison, and allowed to extend
their roots abroad in the free soil of Nature, they will display
new strength and viridity, and bring forth fruit in increased
abundance. Her Majesty's present Secretary of State for the
Colonies (Earl Grey) entered upon his office with truly liberal
and right-minded views, which, we trust, will be carried out into
operation wherever found necessary and practicable. "There can be
no doubt," said his Lordship in the House of Lords, shortly
before taking office, "that in our colonial empire we have the
advantage of possessing warm friends and allies in all quarters
of the world, who, commanding great natural resources, are united
in heart and soul to defend our trade and our interests, and to
take part with us in all contests against our enemies. We have
garrisons of the cheapest kind in every quarter of the universe.
On the other hand, the colonies have this inestimable
advantage--they have the glory and security to be derived from an
intimate connexion with the greatest, the most civilized, and the
most powerful nation on the face of the earth. They have the
glory--and they feel it to be a glory--of calling themselves
British subjects, and feeling that in defence of their interests
and best rights, the power and might of this country are ready at
any moment to be called forth and exercised in their behalf. This
is a substantial advantage of the most important kind to the
colonies; and they are fully sensible of it. And if with this we
pursue a liberal policy, and extend to them the dearest privilege
of Englishmen--THE PRIVILEGE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT, AND DO NOT
VEXATIOUSLY INTERMEDDLE WITH THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS; in short, if
we pursue a liberal policy towards them, both commercially and
politically, we shall bind them to us with chains which no power
on earth may break, and the connexion between the parent state
and those great dependencies may continue until they far exceed
us in population."</p>

<p>These are generous sentiments and profound truths, and they
have shed the bright beams of Hope over that vast colonial empire
to which they refer.</p>

<p>In legislating for colonies, let it not be forgotten that one
of the chief drawbacks to their prosperity is the want of
confidence in the stability and permanency of existing
regulations. There can be no success, and there can be no safety,
whilst those regulations and laws are liable to the influence of
peculiar views or individual caprice. It is the people
themselves, for whose government the laws are intended, who
should be allowed to impose, to modify, or to expunge them.</p>

<p>The predominating evil in colonies is THE WANT OF CONFIDENCE
AND FAITH IN THE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 25.</h3>

<h4>ONE OF THE ERRORS OF GOVERNMENT--ADVENTURE OF THE
BRAMBLE.</h4>

<p>It has ever been considered one of the first principles of
good government, that a frequent and ready communication and
intercourse should be maintained between the ruling power and the
possessions subject to its authority. The first act of Roman sway
was ever to lay down good lines of road through the conquered
country; and nothing has tended so much to maintain the authority
of the United States over the Red Indians of America, as the
formation of roads through the wilderness. The rulers of Great
Britain entertain the opinion that when they have once seized
upon a distant country, and thrown into it a handful of troops
and a few of their importunate friends, with the title of
government officers, they have done all that is required of them.
They wait with resignation for any account that may be brought of
the progress of the new colony, by some wandering
merchant-vessel. Despatches, frequently dated twelve months
previously, during which time they have been making the tour of
all the oceans at present known upon the globe, are brought to
Downing Street; and are then thrown aside, or at least are never
attended to, probably because they are too old to be deemed
interesting. No matter how pressing and immediate the wants of
the colony, chance alone affords the opportunity of making their
necessities known at home. Letters and despatches accumulate in
the Post-office; no vessel arrives bringing intelligence from
England, or offering to take away a mail: the Colonial Secretary,
having exhausted every official resource in the way of mental
occupation, looks out at the window, and meditates upon
quail-shooting. His Excellency the Governor, questions the
possibility of adding another despatch to the hundred and fifty
already composed in illustration of the art of making despatches,
as Soyer makes soup, out of nothing; and oppressed by the
subject, becomes dormant in his chair of state; the clerks in the
neighbouring offices no longer exhibit the uplifted countenance
which, as justly observed by Sallust, distinguishes man from all
other creatures; nothing is to be seen of them but masses of hair
in wild profusion, and right hands extended on the table, still
mechanically grasping steel-pens, whilst every face lies
flattened upon a paper-case, and sleep and silence, broken only
by sighs and snores, reign throughout the building. Universal
stagnation prevails among government people; and merchants and
store-keepers appear to be much in the same condition. The only
person in office who is kept in a constant state of fever, is the
unhappy Post-Master-General, who is hourly called upon to state
when he is going to make up a mail for England. In vain he
apologises for the non-arrival of ships; there is something
radically wrong in his department, for which he is expected to
answer; and dark denunciations are muttered in his ear, until
worn out with anxiety and nervousness, he loses his appetite, and
gradually withers away, like grass in the oven.</p>

<p>And when at length a vessel arrives accidentally from Van
Diemen's Land, or perhaps from America, the Master at first
demurs about taking a mail, under the idea that it may convey
letters giving information of the state of markets that he
desires should be known only to himself and his employers; but
finally consents; and then, having received the mail on board,
carries it about with him from port to port, until at the
conclusion of a long voyage, having occasion to empty his vessel
in order to smoke out the rats, he discovers the forgotten boxes,
and conscientiously sends them ashore.</p>

<p>But if it be vexatious and inconvenient to have only this
uncertain means of despatching our letters to England, how much
more annoying is it to have no regular and stated time for
receiving them from home! What could be more painful than to have
to wait twelve months before you can receive an answer to an
inquiry; and what more destructive to the interests of commerce?
How many fluctuations are there in the state of the markets
during those twelve months!</p>

<p>It is one of the greatest of evils to have no regular
post-office communication between the Mother Country and her
colonies, and the interests of trade in both greatly suffer by
it.</p>

<p>Much has been said lately of establishing steam communication
with Sydney. A committee of Sydney merchants has been appointed
in London to consider the subject, and the restless and
indefatigable Lieut. Waghorn has written a pamphlet showing how
it may be done, provided the Government will contribute 100,000
pounds per annum towards the project. He proposes that a branch
line of steamers shall be established, to proceed from Sincapore
by the north of New Holland, touching at Port Essington, and
through Torres Straits to Sydney, and probably on to Van Dieman's
Land. But why follow such a route as this, through the most
dangerous channel in the world, where even steamers would have to
lie-to at night (as the Lieutenant admits), and where
light-houses would have to be erected and kept up at an
extravagant cost? Why take such a route, which presents not a
single place to call at, except Port Essington, a miserable spot,
intended only as a kind of refuge for shipwrecked mariners,
possessing no commercial or agricultural inhabitants, and only
enjoying the advantages and the society of a Governor, a handful
of soldiers, and three white women? Why insist upon expending so
much public money, and encountering so many dangers, without
conferring a single additional benefit upon the Australian
colonies, when the route by the south of New Holland is so
obvious, so practicable, and so superior? The projectors talk of
making Port Essington a depot for coal; but why not make this
depot in Western Australia? During the summer months, from 1st
October to 1st April, the steamers might touch at Fremantle; and
during the winter months, at Port Gladstone, fifteen miles to the
southward, affording a sheltered harbour where ships may ride
securely within one hundred yards of the shore. Coal mines will
probably soon be at work in the colony, vast beds of that mineral
having been discovered, thus offering every inducement to
steam-vessels to touch here. Nor could anything be more
advantageous, considering the great interests that England now
has at stake in these seas, than to form a general depot in this
colony, where her Majesty's steamers and ships-of-war might refit
on occasion. As there is no other spot in all New Holland, Van
Dieman's Land, or New Zealand, where first-rate ship-timber may
be obtained, and where IRON, COAL, and COPPER, are also
procurable in abundance, this colony offers advantages for the
formation of a Government Dock-yard and depot (at Port
Gladstone), that must be acknowledged by every unprejudiced
person.</p>

<p>Objections may be raised to doubling Cape Lewin during the
winter season; but let the steamers stand well out to sea, and
there would be no difficulty. The time lost would not exceed that
spent in lying-to in Torres Straits during the night. Our
colonial schooner, the Champion, goes round Cape Lewin at all
seasons.</p>

<p>We would propose that the mail steamers, instead of branching
off from Sincapore, as proposed by Lieut. Waghorn, should depart
from Point de Galle, Ceylon, make direct for Swan River, there
take in coal, and pass on to Adelaide, South Australia, and
thence to Van Dieman's Land, where they might put the Melbourne
and Sydney mails on board of the steamer already plying between
Van Dieman's Land and those places. By this route the Sydney
people would receive their letters quite as soon as though their
interests alone had been consulted, according to the desire of
the disinterested committee before alluded to; whilst Van
Dieman's Land would gain a few days, and South Australia and
Western Australia would be allowed to share in the general
advantage, from which they would otherwise be entirely
excluded.</p>

<p>But the Government and the public would also be gainers by the
route which we suggest. It would be much cheaper to them, because
it would be much more profitable to the company that carried it
out. The colony of South Australia is now a populous country, and
becomes more so every year; but the Steam Company would carry no
passengers and no goods for South Australia (perhaps not even for
Van Dieman's Land), if the route to Sydney were to be by Port
Essington and Torres Straits. The two colonies of South and
Western Australia deriving no benefit from such a course, could
give no support to the company. Government hitherto has resisted
the efforts of the Sydney merchants, and refused to sanction the
proposal of Mr. Waghorn, but chiefly upon the ground of expense.
And there is no doubt that Ministers would be guilty of a gross
misdemeanour, were they to consent to apply 100,000 pounds per
annum of the public money in furtherance of a scheme designed for
the exclusive benefit of a single colony. It is the duty of
Government to see that any sum which may be granted shall be so
applied as to confer the most extensive benefit upon all the
Australian colonies. That measures ought to be immediately taken
to ensure a regular communication between the home country and
every one of her colonies is a matter of no doubt to us. The want
of this has long appeared to be one of the grand errors of
colonial legislation. Let us hope that the day is not far distant
when this crying evil shall be remedied. Now that steam
navigation has come so generally into use, there is no valid
reason why it should not be made the means of uniting together,
as it were, the different outposts of the empire, drawing them
more closely towards their parent country as to a common centre.
It is full time that a greater appearance of sympathy were
exhibited at home for those distant settlements which have now
become the principal markets for British produce, and which,
therefore, deserve something more at the hand of Government than
what they have so long been accustomed to find--alternate periods
of tyranny and neglect.</p>

<p>By far the greater portion of English merchant-ships are
engaged in trading to the colonies; our manufactures there find
their principal mart; our surplus population is there cheaply
provided with maintenance and a home. These are the grounds on
which the colonies lay claim to the fostering care of the Mother
Country, and we trust the days are at hand that will see it
afforded.</p>

<p>The first step must be to ensure a regular and frequent
intercourse between the countries, without which there can be no
real protection; without which there is no sufficient
encouragement given to trade; and the parent state can therefore
reap but little advantage, comparatively, from a colony whose
powers are only imperfectly developed.</p>

<p>Since the above remarks were written, accounts have reached
England of the arrival at Fremantle of her Majesty's surveying
vessel Bramble, Commander Lieutenant Yule, after passing some
time in Torres Straits and on the coast of New Guinea.</p>

<p>Mr. Yule having kindly placed the notes of his voyage at the
disposal of a friend in the colony, they were partially published
in one of the local journals in the month of January last. The
portion relating to Torres Straits is instructive. The Bramble
sailed from Port Jackson about the end of December 1845, in
company with the Castlereagh tender, Lieut. Aird, Commander.
Touching at Moreton Bay, Mr. Yule visited his old acquaintance,
Captain Wickham, R.N., late in command of H.M.S. Beagle, and now
a settler on the Brisbane. In the words of the journal referred
to, "the Bramble proceeded slowly to the northward, being much
delayed by the bad sailing of the tender." The voyage presents
nothing worthy of notice, until the arrival of the ships in
Torres Straits, when it is impossible to help being struck with
the commentary which Mr. Yule unconsciously affords upon the
"perfect safety" of that passage, now so much vaunted by the
advocates of the northern route. While the Bramble and
Castlereagh were lying off Sir Charles Hardy's Islands, the
latter being deficient in ballast, Mr. Aird was despatched with
the boats to look for the "wreck" of the Maid of Athens and the
"wreck" of the Martha Ridgway, with the view of procuring some;
and having failed in discovering the former, and therefore in
procuring a sufficient supply, he was again sent to the "wreck"
of the Sir Archibald Campbell for the same purpose. So much for
Torres Straits!</p>

<p>Mr. Yule strongly recommends Cairncross Island as the best
station for obtaining wood and water for vessels navigating the
straits, there being abundance of both easily procurable, and
even large timber, if required. On this island they shot four
megapodii, and observed many of their nests, some of which Mr.
Yule describes as being twelve feet high, and upwards of fifty
feet in circumference.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 10th April they made the coast of New Guinea,
which presented a low and thickly-wooded coast-line, backed by
mountains of magnificent height and beauty; the country being
apparently very rich, with many villages, embowered in cocoa-nut
trees, scattered along the shore. While coasting along, in search
of a convenient place to land, they encountered a native vessel
of most extraordinary size and character, which we will allow Mr.
Yule to describe in his own words:--</p>

<p>"At daybreak, as the sun was rising, I was very much struck
with the grandeur of some very distant mountains in a
south-eastern direction --one in particular, the outline of whose
summit was only visible above the intervening clouds; immense
ranges of mountains were also distinctly visible this side of it,
extending in a N.W. and S.E. direction. It is seldom the rising
sun has disclosed to my sight so splendid a view as then
presented itself; but in a few minutes, when the sun's disk
appeared, the beautiful scene vanished, leaving only inferior
cloud-topped mountains visible, together with the rich and
undulating foreground. We shortly afterwards saw the strange sail
seen last night. Although she was much nearer, she proved more
unaccountable than before. As there was not sufficient wind to
enable us to weigh, I resolved to send Mr. Pollard in the second
gig to take a nearer view of this extraordinary vessel. I watched
the boat until Mr. Pollard must have gone nearly five miles from
us, when the boat's sails appeared a mere speck when close to the
wonderful stranger. On this officer's return, he informed me he
had approached within bow-shot of the vessel, which proved to be
a gigantic double canoe, which he conceives must have measured
fifty or sixty feet long, kept apart and together by a platform
from fifteen to twenty feet broad, which extended nearly the
whole length of the canoes, the after-end being square with the
sterns of the boats; six or eight feet of this was left clear for
the three steersmen, who guided the vessel with three long
paddles over the stern. With the exception of this part of the
platform, the whole was covered by a strong, well-built house,
made of cane, the roof being flat, and about five or six feet
above the platform. This roof answered the purpose of an upper
deck, affording the crew the means of conveniently walking on it.
This extraordinary craft was propelled by two large mat sails,
each spread between two bamboo masts, the heels of which were
fixed in the same step, the mastheads being spread (athwartships)
from twenty to thirty feet asunder, the sail being triangular
between these bamboo masts, which were supported by diagonal
shores fore and aft on either side; besides these two large
sails, the canoe had numerous smaller (square) ones suspended
from the principal masts; there was also a small square sail
forward. The whole of the spars and rigging was ornamented with a
sort of flags and streamers. Mr. Pollard thinks that he saw about
forty or fifty people on the roof, several of whom were in the
act of stringing their bows; except this precaution on the part
of the strangers, there was no demonstration of hostility. After
taking a good view of this most extraordinary canoe, Mr. Pollard
returned; and she ultimately was wafted out of sight. Whence she
came, or where bound, still remains to me a problem.</p>

<p>"At noon I obtained the latitude, which was 8 degrees 3
minutes S.; longitude, by chronometer, 145 degrees 28 minutes
E.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon the Castlereagh was visited by two small
canoes, with eight men, who had come off from a village we
discovered abreast of us. The natives brought off a few
cocoa-nuts and some bows and arrows, which they readily bartered
for such trifles as were given in exchange."</p>

<p>The lofty mountain which so much excited Mr. Yule's
admiration, was named by him Mount Victoria, and between it and
the shore were several ranges of inferior altitude, which gave
him "every reason to believe that the lower regions were well
watered and fertile."</p>

<p>Having fixed upon a favourable spot for commencing his
triangulation behind a promontory which served to conceal them
from the view of a native village which they saw at no great
distance, Mr. Yule went ashore in the first gig with five seamen
and one marine, accompanied by Mr. Sweetman, in the second gig,
with three seamen and two marines, all well armed, and proceeded
to hoist the Union Jack and take possession of the place in the
name of her Majesty Queen Victoria. Having successfully performed
this duty, and obtained the observations he required, Mr. Yule
thought it high time to return on board; but the surf had in the
meantime increased so heavily, that in the attempt the second gig
was swamped, and every thing in her, including the arms, lost,
except the quintant and chronometer, the boat herself being with
difficulty saved by being towed outside the surf by the other
gig. The rest of the adventure we shall give in Mr. Yule's own
words:--</p>

<p>"At this time I observed the Castlereagh about two miles
beyond Cape Possession, under sail; I therefore made signs to Mr.
Wright, in the first gig, to tow the second gig towards the
Castlereagh, which I concluded would attract Mr. Aird's
attention. In this I was not mistaken, as the Castlereagh was
immediately anchored about a mile and a half off, and her boats
sent to the relief of ours. In the interim I determined that
every thing which was washed on shore should be collected
together, after which we all huddled close under a bush near the
beech, whence we could see our boats and be hid from the view of
the natives as much as possible. The Castlereagh's boats having
at length closed with the Bramble's, the second gig was soon
baled out, when all four boats pulled up abreast of us outside of
the surf, which had continued to increase; the Castlereagh at the
same time weighed, which I confess alarmed me much, as I knew
very few persons could be left on board after she had dispatched
two boats' crews; I therefore concluded we were discovered by the
natives beyond Cape Possession. I was in a few moments confirmed
in my fears by seeing Mr. Andrews prepare to push his boat
through the surf. I waved him back, when he energetically pointed
towards Cape Possession. I fully understood his signs (that
natives were coming), but still waved him off, as I knew his
gallant attempt to relieve us would fail, and that he and his
boat's crew would be added to those already in distress on shore;
he, however, pushed through the surf, when, as I expected, this
boat was upset, and all his arms, ammunition, etc. lost. At the
same moment we observed crowds of natives coming round the point
of Cape Possession, armed with spears, clubs, and stone axes. Our
arms and ammunition had been all lost or destroyed; our situation
was therefore most defenceless, and, I may say, our retreat
hopeless; those boats at the back being unable to afford us the
least relief. I then thought it best to show no signs of fear or
mistrust, but to make friends with the natives, and amuse them,
until the next tide should enable a boat to back through the
surf. In the interim, Mr. Andrews, with his four men, and
assisted by some others, made three attempts to launch his boat,
which failed, and she was ultimately dashed in pieces against the
rocks. I advanced alone with playful gestures, waving a branch of
green leaves, in token of peace. One man pointed a spear at me,
but the others stared at me with more wonder depicted on their
countenances than ferocity. I then offered them some bits of
tobacco, which they would not approach near enough to take from
my hands. This shyness, unfortunately, did not continue long; for
when the main body came up, amounting to eighty or ninety men,
armed, they became troublesome, and laid their hands on
everything they could get hold of that was lying on the beach. To
these robberies I attempted to put a stop, and made them some
presents instead; but the savages must have known our helpless
condition, and became every moment more daring and rapacious;
and, to add to our tribulation, we observed two large canoes,
each containing thirty or forty men, come round Possession Point,
and heave to between the Castlereagh and the boats, as if with
the intention of cutting off the latter. The Castlereagh could
not unfortunately take advantage of her guns by firing grape or
canister, as we were completely intermixed with the natives. At
this critical stage of our anxiety, the second gig, at all
hazards, was veered through the surf, and, to our great joy, four
or five men were drawn off in safety. A second attempt was made,
and succeeded. Then came the awful moment for us who waited for
the last trip; for only a few moments before, I baulked a native
when taking a deliberate aim at one of our last men who embarked.
The natives now, seeing our numbers decrease, laid hands on us in
the most violent manner. My quintant was first wrested from my
coxswain, who in a tone of grief made me known the circumstance.
I immediately turned round and exclaimed 'Oh! don't part with
that'; but it was too late; and when I endeavoured to recover it,
I found a club wielded over my head. In making my escape from
this wretch I was secured by four others, who first took the
government micronometer, which was slung round my neck. I then
endeavoured to struggle out of their clutches, and escape with
the pocket chronometer and note-book, but these, AS WELL AS EVERY
ARTICLE OF CLOTHING I HAD ABOUT MY BODY, were stripped off; when
the second gig was opportunely again backed in, and in this
forlorn state Mr. Pollard, the two marines, and I, waded off, and
were dragged into the boat. We then went on board the
Castlereagh, which was at anchor about a mile from the shore; the
canoes slowly made off to the north-westward, after we had
embarked. The boats having been hoisted up and secured, we got
the anchor up and proceeded out to the Bramble, and anchored
close to her at 6h. 30m. p.m. I immediately afterwards returned
to the Bramble, truly thankful for our having escaped with our
lives. The loss of instruments grieved me exceedingly,
particularly as the nature of the coast rendered it next to
impossible to effect a safe landing to attempt their recovery.
From the account I heard of the ferocity of the natives where the
Fly had been surveying last year on this coast, I confess I fully
expected death would be my fate in a few minutes, and thought of
the similar position poor Captain Skying was in when murdered at
Cape Roso. If we had been possessed of six or eight muskets and
plenty of ammunition, I think the natives might easily have been
checked, but being defenceless, my only hope was to dissemble my
fears and amuse them, to give us time until we could effect our
escape. These people varied in complexion from black to a light
copper colour; they appeared well made and active; all of them
were ornamented, but some much more so than others; their
ear-rings were made of rings of tortoiseshell, a number of them
being fastened together, and suspended to the lower parts of the
ears, in which are holes stretched so large as to admit a man's
thumb being passed through them; the cartilage dividing the
nostrils is perforated in like manner."</p>

<p>This adventure of our old friends of the Bramble appears to me
sufficiently interesting to excuse my having wandered through
Torres Straits in order to record it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 26.</h3>

<h4>SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.--KANGAROO HUNTING.--EMUS.--LOST IN
THE BUSH.</h4>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the truth of the axiom that "facts
are stubborn things." Right or wrong, they seem to persist in a
resolution to force conviction upon a man however reluctant he
may be.</p>

<p>Sturdy facts are never wanting in support of erroneous views;
and more false conclusions are drawn from them than from the
subtlest arguments of the sophist.</p>

<p>When your theory is once confirmed by a fact, the question is
considered decided, and no further argument is admissible. I had
two theories not long ago, the pursuit and investigation of which
gave me a good deal of pleasure; they were built upon facts, and
therefore they were indisputable.</p>

<p>My first theory was upon the amount of evaporation at Perth
during the summer months.</p>

<p>The excessive dryness of the atmosphere proved that the
evaporation at the end of the rainy, or winter season, must be
very great indeed. My friend, Mr. H., had an hygrometer, which he
kept in a small room adjoining that in which he usually sat; and
this hygrometer afforded the ground-work for our theories. It
proved most satisfactorily that the evaporation exceeded every
thing of the kind known in any other part of the globe. It was
clear that our atmosphere was drier than that of a brick-kiln
when burning its best. But the great beauty and novelty of the
theory was, that the evaporation was greater at night than in the
day time.</p>

<p>This certainly puzzled us a good deal at first; but when once
you are sure of your facts, it is astonishing how soon you come
to mould your theory so as to make it perfectly agree with them,
and manage to reconcile yourself to the most startling
contradictions. After satisfying himself of the truth of the
fact--that the evaporation was really greater by night than by
day--Mr. H. proceeded to prove philosophically that nothing could
be more reasonable than such a circumstance. From all that I
could make out of his arguments, which were extremely logical and
ingenious, it seemed clear that as every thing in this country is
diametrically opposite to every thing in the old country, it was
perfectly consistent with the regulations of nature in Australia,
that evaporation should be greater at night than during the day
time. Moreover, he placed great reliance upon the attraction of
the moon.</p>

<p>For my part, seeing that facts were on his side, I embraced
his views with ardour; and went about as an apostle, proclaiming
the new tidings far and wide. It was one of those astonishing
truths in science that come suddenly and unexpectedly upon
mankind--like those connected with electricity--that take the
reason captive, and are beyond the reach of human investigation.
Men usually appeared incredulous when the theory was first
broached to them; but when convinced of the fact, as proved
indisputably by the hygrometer, they were compelled to
acknowledge the truth, and forthwith looked upon it as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>As the weather grew warmer--when the thermometer stood daily
at about 86 degrees in a cool room--the nocturnal evaporation
increased. At length it grew to such a pitch, that the tube of
the hygrometer containing the water was exhausted in a couple of
nights. Notwithstanding the astonishment of Mr. H., he was
enraptured at the triumphant confirmation of his theory. He
devoted every moment he could spare from public duties, to the
compilation of a learned and voluminous treatise upon the
subject. He looked upon himself as destined to be considered one
of the master-philosophers of the age, the promulgator of a new
and wondrous theory, based not only upon sound argument, but upon
long observation and indisputable facts. When any one ventured to
raise a doubt, he would smile with that ineffable sweetness which
distinguishes a man conscious of his superior knowledge and
sources of information. I, his enthusiastic adherent, picked up
the crumbs of instruction that fell from his table; and dealt
forth mysterious hints of the scientific errors about to be
corrected by the observations and treatises of Mr. H., who was
now generally known to have forwarded an account of his
discoveries to some of the learned Societies of London; and the
English papers were perused with avidity, in the hope of finding
that due honour had been paid to his merits.</p>

<p>As he walked along the streets he was looked upon with
additional reverence. He had raised the renown of Western
Australia, and was now considered to be at once its decus et
tutamen. The idlers who congregated in small knots about
luncheon-time at the corners of the streets, began to talk of a
statue in the market-place.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the philosopher secluded himself from the
vulgar gaze. The public wondered, and then became alarmed. The
philosopher had taken to his bed. After some days I was admitted
to his presence, and found him greatly enfeebled for want of
rest. It was evident there was something that weighed upon his
mind. After many ineffectual efforts, many sighs and some
blushes, he faltered forth a confession that he feared our
theory, (he seemed now, for the first time, kindly solicitous to
share the merit of the discovery,) of evaporation being greater
at night than in the day-time, was not well founded. An electric
shock, shivering the funny-bones of both elbows, could not have
startled me more. What did he mean? He continued, that one night
whilst engaged upon a new hygrometrical treatise, he had sat up
till a very late hour; the door of the room which contained the
instrument was open, and the light from his lamp fell directly
upon it. Absorbed in profound speculations, his eye occasionally
rested upon the little instrument which stood upon a table. There
it was--the pillar of his fame. It seemed to dilate in dimensions
until it rivalled the column in the Place Vendome, and on the top
of it was a figure, less sturdy than that of Napoleon. Suddenly
his vision was broken, and his thoughts were recalled from the
future to the present, by seeing a living object move along the
table, and quietly approach the foot of his column. Appalled and
paralyzed, he sat immovable whilst he beheld an actual mouse,
unrestrained by any scientific considerations, place its profane
snout in the bowl of the hygrometer, and drink deliberately until
its thirst was satisfied. It then retired, and other mice soon
came trotting along the table and did the same.</p>

<p>Mr. H. is a man of great self-control. He did not tear his
remaining locks, or commit any other rash act, but with all the
calmness of despair he set fire to the unfinished treatise, and
saw it consumed; then he retired to bed, a desolate individual,
and rose not again for several days.</p>

<p>My next theory was entirely my own. I claimed all the merit of
it, and felt the utmost pangs of jealousy when any one ventured
to assert that HE had long ago suspected it. Built upon a solid
foundation of facts, I maintained an opinion entirely at variance
with that of Professor Owen and certain Parisian professors, and
satisfied myself, at least, that the young of the kangaroo, and
of other marsupial animals, is produced, not in the usual way,
but from the teat of the dam. And although this theory is, and
must be erroneous, I can even yet scarcely bring myself to
believe it so--with such fidelity do we cling to error. There are
many men in the colony who have been for years in the constant,
almost daily, habit of killing kangaroos, and they have
consequently had opportunities of observing the young ones in
every stage of development. Females have been killed with young
ones hanging to the nipple, about half an inch long--the form not
fully developed, a mere foetus, presenting no appearance of
active vitality. The nipple to which it is attached is not merely
placed in the mouth of the foetus, but extends into its stomach,
where it serves the purposes of the umbilical cord in other
animals, whilst the lips grow round it, so that it cannot be
removed without rupturing the skin. A little older, and it
becomes evidently possessed of vitality--a quickened foetus. The
pouch of the doe is closed up until the birth of the young one;
and gradually enlarges to accommodate the inhabitant.</p>

<p>There are other marsupial animals, of the size of rabbits,
that are found with eight or ten young ones, or rather small
foetuses, similarly attached to the nipples of the parent.</p>

<p>Now I could not conceive how creatures with long sharp claws,
though provided with flexible wrists or joints, should be able to
take up the newly produced little lump of inanimate flesh, and
thrust a long, soft, yielding nipple down into the depths of the
stomach. I collected a number of FACTS to prove the contrary--but
the question is now considered to be set at rest by the
observations of French naturalists, and therefore I have quietly
strangled my theory, but am still occasionally haunted by its
ghost.</p>

<p>I may mention here that male kangaroos are sometimes found
provided with pouches; but these, I conceive, are lusus
Naturae.</p>

<p>This allusion to kangaroos (being good for nothing else) may
serve as an introduction to a hunting excursion. A party of us
started from Perth, equipped in the manner already described in
the chapter upon Wild Cattle.</p>

<p>We rode to the Canning to breakfast, at the house of the----s,
where we found the table ready spread with coffee, grilled fowls,
eggs, ham, etc. The room was a good one, having French windows,
looking out upon park-like scenery, among which the Canning River
pursued its lazy course. There was also a piano belonging to the
sister of our hosts, then absent on a visit. One of her brothers
informed us that he had availed himself of her absence to
abstract sundry of the wires from the piano in order to make
bell-wires, which he thought was turning the piano to good
account.</p>

<p>After breakfast we loaded our bullock-cart with our goods, and
left it in charge of a servant whom we appointed to meet us at a
certain spot where we were to bivouac for the night. The only
disagreeable part of travelling in Australia is the scarcity of
water, except at the end of winter, when all the gullies are
filled. Unless, therefore, the ground be well known, it is always
advisable to take a native, who can inform you where the pools or
springs are situated. Four of us set out, well mounted, and
attended by a native on foot, and five kangaroo dogs. These dogs
are descended from a cross between a bloodhound and a greyhound,
and combine strength, fleetness, scent, and sight. As it was the
middle of winter (late in June) the air was cool and pleasant,
and the sun bright and joyous, as he always is here. We were all
in high spirits, anticipating excellent sport, as the country to
which we were going abounds with game of great
variety--kangaroos, emus, quail, and turkeys, or bustards. A
rough coarse scrub, interspersed with small quantities of grass,
overspread the sandy soil. The only animal we saw for some time
was an opossum, which the native discovered in a tree and climbed
up for. I examined its pouch, but there was no young one within
it. At length we caught a glimpse of a kangaroo hopping along at
a distance, and we galloped off in full chase, but he was too far
ahead for the dogs to make anything of it; so we lost him.
Disconcerted and vexed we drew together again after a short run,
but had scarcely done so before we emerged upon an open prairie,
where on our right we beheld three kangaroos hopping away at a
gentle pace. the kangaroo uses only his hind legs in running. The
leg presses the ground from the hock to the toes, and its strong
sinews enable the animal to bound forward with immense leaps; the
heavy tail vibrating behind keeps him steady. Four of the dogs
rushed after the game, followed by all the horsemen, at full
gallop, hallooing and shouting vociferously. A more animated
sight could scarcely be conceived; three graceful kangaroos
bounding away in a line, with four large greyhounds laying well
after them, and the hunters chiveying along, and dashing through
brushwood and thickets like whirlwinds. The kangaroos, however,
fairly beat us; they gained a thick wood, dashed through it and
into a swamp beyond, and there we lost sight of them. We all
returned to the side of the wood, and waited for the dogs, who
came back with hanging heads and drooping tail, completely blown.
All returned but one--the oldest and most sagacious of them. He
had not gone with the four which followed the heels of the
kangaroos, but had made a short cut to the left, so that he was
in the wood almost as soon as the kangaroos, whilst the other
dogs were still a long way behind. We waited patiently for old
Tip (of whom honourable mention has been made before); his
master, Tom H., asserting confidently that he had killed. At
length as we were standing talking together, we suddenly
perceived Tip among us. His master examined his mouth, and
declared he had killed; then saying, "Show, Tip, show!" the dog
turned round, and trotted off before us; and going into the swamp
took us to the spot where the kangaroo lay dead.</p>

<p>It is not all kangaroo dogs that can be taught to show game,
and those that do so are therefore highly prized. It is a very
pleasing sight to observe how proud a dog is of this
accomplishment. He will come quietly back to his master, and
oftentimes lay himself down as if he were afraid the other dogs
should suspect he had got something to tell, and would run off in
search of it. And when his master gives the signal, he
deliberately proceeds to lead the way, snarling at the other dogs
whenever they run before him, and seem likely to arrive first at
the spot. Sometimes he tries to deceive them by going in a wrong
direction, and when the others have started off, full of
eagerness, as if they themselves (the senseless fools!) were
inviting people to follow, and were anxious to show them the
game, the old dog will rapidly turn aside, evidently laughing in
his sleeve, and dash forward to the spot where he left the
carcase. There you will find him standing over it; and as you
ride up he will give a faint wag of his tail, as though he were
glad that you are pleased with him, and yet he cannot help
feeling that he is not properly rewarded. His gaunt ribs and
melancholy eye speak of his hungry stomach; he seems to remember
that he receives from his rough master more kicks than caresses,
but still he does his duty, and will do so to the last; and
denies himself even a mouthful of the prey, which but for him,
would lie undiscovered in the thicket. I used to know an old
show-dog who displayed so much thought and sagacity, that I never
was in his company without feeling for him a certain degree of
respect. Whenever struck by brutes of lower order than himself,
he did not howl or display his teeth, but slunk aside with a look
of deep sorrow and reproach.</p>

<p>In the evening we bivouacked near a small pool of water, where
the cart joined us, according to previous arrangement. The horses
were tethered out and fed; a good fire was kindled, and with
kangaroo steaks, cold fowls and ham, and brandy and water, we
managed to make a tolerable supper. A fence against the wind was
constructed of upright sticks, and leaves of the black-boy
(Xanthorea, or grass-tree) resembling rushes, only brittle; and
with a good fire at our feet we were exceedingly warm and
comfortable. The wild dogs uttered their doleful, wailing cries
around our camp during the night, and caused our own frequently
to sally forth and give them chase.</p>

<p>We had kangaroo curry for breakfast next morning; and having
fed our horses, and sounded to saddle, set out again in pursuit
of game.</p>

<p>Proceeding across some plains, interspersed with swamps and
thickets, we soon perceived a herd of about a dozen kangaroos
feeding and hopping about. Keeping a covert in line before us, we
tried to get near them, but they soon made off, bounding away
like a herd of deer, which they much resemble at a distance. The
dogs started after them at full speed; and with loud halloos and
bounding hearts the horsemen spurred their steeds, and scoured
along the plain. There are, unfortunately, no fences in this
country, but there are a thousand worse obstructions--fallen
trees, thick clumps of black-boys extending right across the
plain, and therefore not to be avoided; woods through which the
game dashes at speed, and where you must follow at the risk of
striking head or limbs against the trunks or branches of trees,
or else you will be thrown out. Then of course you don't like to
be last, and you don't like to allow the gallant captain, who is
spurring at your side, the opportunity of bragging at mess that
he alone kept near the dogs, which you know he would be delighted
to do. So, determined to ride against the captain at any rate,
you keep your horse and yourself well together, and flinch at
nothing; dashing through thickets, tearing over rough ground,
steering between trees, ducking your head under boughs, and
twitching up first one leg and then the other to save them from
being smashed against black-boys or banksias. You clear the wood,
and emerge again upon a plain; the kangaroos are bounding along,
some three hundred yards in advance, the dogs lying well up to
them; and now the latter have fixed upon one of the herd, whom
they pursue with resolute fierceness. The others escape into
friendly thickets, but the doomed one, an old buck, some six feet
in height when resting on his haunches, still holds out, though
his enemies are fast gaining upon him.</p>

<p>At length, finding escape impossible, he makes for a broad
mahogany tree, where he suddenly comes to bay. The dogs hesitate
to rush in upon him, his eye gleams with such deadly ferocity,
whilst he sits erect upon his haunches, ready to dart the long
claw of his hind leg into the first assailant who comes within
reach.</p>

<p>A kangaroo in this position is no despicable enemy. He has
great power in his limbs; and if he happens to strike a dog with
his claw, he inflicts a grievous wound, and sometimes tears out
his entrails, and kills him on the spot. He rushes at men with
the same fury, and tries to clasp them with his fore-paws whilst
he strikes at them with his hind-legs. I rode up to the animal in
question, dismounted, and struck him a rap on the head with a
broken bough, as he rushed towards me with a fierce hissing
noise. As he staggered at the blow, the dogs darted upon him and
quickly despatched him.</p>

<p>We had several other good runs before luncheon, and then
baited our horses, and allowed them to rest for two or three
hours. Whilst riding towards our bivouac in the afternoon, a
native who was walking at my side, and who had accompanied us all
day, stopped suddenly, and, pointing with his finger, said,
"Emu!" About a mile distant across the prairie were two of those
large birds quietly feeding. The dogs were immediately called
together, fresh vigour seemed to animate the whole party, and we
proceeded to give chase in high spirits. Emus are sometimes shot
with the rifle, but the usual mode of obtaining them is by
hunting them with kangaroo dogs. If you happen to come near
enough to them without raising alarm, they may frequently be
detained, and even attracted almost up to your stirrup by
WHISTLING. I have known this to be repeatedly tried with success.
When you begin to whistle, the emu lifts up its head and listens
with attention; soon, delighted with the sound, he walks
leisurely in the direction from which it comes; then, perceiving
a human being, he pauses, seems irresolute, and finally walks
round and round you in circles gradually lessening, until he
approaches within a few yards. If his confidence be not repaid
with a bullet, he will, after gratifying his curiosity by a good
stare, quietly walk away through his native woods. Emus are
frequently speared by the natives, who, by taking care to stand
stock-still the moment the creature lifts up its head, manage to
approach within a few yards of them while feeding. Though the
savage may have his hand raised in the act of throwing the spear,
he remains fixed in that attitude whilst the emu takes a survey
of him. Perceiving only an object without motion, the bird takes
him for a tree, and continues to graze, falling a victim, like
other innocent things, to a misplaced confidence in its own
security.</p>

<h4>Emu Hunt</h4>

<p>The emus ran fast, and gave us a long chase; but at length the
headmost dog caught hold of the extended flapper of one of the
birds, and arrested its progress; the others, coming up, soon
pulled him to the ground, and by the time we reached the spot he
was dead. The feathers from the tail were distributed among the
party, and placed in our caps; and the legs being cut off, the
rest of the bird was abandoned. The legs alone afford any meat,
which is by no means a delicacy, and resembles coarse beef.
Whilst the process of cutting up was going on, my attention was
attracted to the movements of old Tip, who had stolen away from
the party, and was now, ventre a terre, scouring along the edge
of a belt of trees about a quarter of a mile from us. His master
in vain tried to recall him, and I set off to see what he was
about. Following him through the wood, I perceived him at the
other side in hot pursuit of half-a-dozen kangaroos, that were
bounding away some hundred yards ahead of him. It was in vain to
attempt to recall him, so I foolishly followed the chase, though
it was leading far away from the direction I wanted to take. Old
Tip held on unflaggingly, as though this were his first run that
day; and for nearly two miles we dashed along through woods and
across prairies, until I began to wish myself back with my
friends. At length we lost the game in a vast swamp, covered with
thick underwood, in which my horse floundered for some time in a
fearful manner. Thinking it worse to return than to push through,
we struggled on, in momentary danger of sinking for ever, and
after great exertions got upon solid ground again. When
dismounted, to rest the horse, who panted and trembled with the
efforts he had made, I called for Tip till the woods rang again,
but all in vain. At last I saw a single kangaroo, a fresh one of
immense size, break cover, with Tip about forty yards in his
rear. In the ardour of the chase, all prudential considerations
were given to the winds; and cheering on the gallant hound, I
followed the game more determinedly than ever. And what a race
that villain kangaroo led us!--through thickets where my
hunting-shirt was torn into strips, my arms and legs covered with
bruises, and my face lacerated with boughs that were not to be
avoided. The villain doubled like a hare, and led us in such
various directions, that I fancied we must have turned upon our
steps and gone past the spot where I had parted from my friends.
Unless a man be very well accustomed to the bush, he is certain
to lose himself in a few minutes. One clump of trees is so like
another--the thick swamps, the open plains, all bear such a
general resemblance to one another, that you feel quite
confounded whilst trying to recollect whether you have really
seen them before, and can form some tolerable guess as to your
position. The kangaroo was now approaching the foot of the long,
even, uninteresting range of the Darling Hills; his pace was
slow, he made his leaps with difficulty, and would soon have been
caught, had not poor Tip been equally dead beat.</p>

<p>It was evident the old dog could scarcely drag himself along,
but still he refused to give in. My horse, exhausted with
floundering in the swamp, was completely knocked up; and for some
time I had only been able to push him along at a jog-trot. Still
I was no more willing to give up the chase than old Tip. It
seemed to have become a point of honour that I should not desert
the hound; and moreover, feeling myself completely lost, I did
not like to part from my companion; and, above all, it would
never do to let the kangaroo escape after all the trouble he had
given us. So we all three continued to work along as best we
could.</p>

<p>At last my poor horse happened to set his foot in an empty
water-hole, and too weak to recover himself, came down on his
shoulder and side with great violence. I threw myself off as he
fell, but could not save my foot from being crushed beneath the
saddle, and so both horse and man lay extended on the ground. I
could just see the hound and kangaroo still struggling onward,
and almost close together. The horse made no attempt to rise, and
I tried in vain to extricate my foot; at length I managed to flog
him up, and then raised myself with difficulty. I had not
suffered much damage, though bruised, and in some pain, but my
poor horse had sprained his shoulder, and was completely hors de
combat. On looking about for the chase, I fancied I could
perceive the dog lying on a little rising ground, a few hundred
yards distant; and leaving the horse, I hopped after the game. On
arriving at the spot, I found the kangaroo and the dog lying side
by side, both alive, but completely exhausted; the one unable to
do any injury, and the other to get away. Securing the dog with
my handkerchief, I sat down, waiting till he should be able to
walk. In a few minutes the kangaroo lifted up his head, and
looked about him; the dog sat up, panting as though his heart
would burst, and took no notice of the other. The kangaroo,
scrambling to its feet, hopped away a few yards, and then stood
still again. "Go along, old fellow!" said I, "you have done us
abundance of mischief, but it would be criminal to kill you when
I cannot carry home even your tail--so farewell!" Off he jumped,
and was soon lost to view, leaving us alone--three miserable
cripples, far from any shelter, and (so far as I was concerned)
not knowing at all how to rejoin our friends. Tip being now able
to limp on three legs, and myself upon one, we returned to the
unhappy steed, who remained where I had left him, hanging down
his head, and looking the image of woe.</p>

<p>In vain I tried to determine the direction I ought to take;
trees and swamps were on all sides of me, and I could not decide
whether my friends were now on my right-hand or my left. I
remembered that our place of rendezvous appeared to be nearly
opposite an opening in the hills, some six or eight miles
distant; but there were openings in the hills on each side of me,
and which was the one to be sought I could not determine. I
therefore resolved to retrace the foot-marks of my horse, if
possible; and set out leading the animal, having Tip limping at
my side, and every now and then looking up as though he felt for
the ill plight in which we all appeared. It soon became evident
that the horse must be left behind; and therefore removing his
saddle and bridle, I placed them at the foot of a tree, and gave
him his liberty.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *Six months afterwards he was caught among the
horses of a settler on the Serpentine, perfectly sound and in
excellent condition.</p>

<p>After going some distance, I came within view of an extensive
swamp, which I fancied formed part of that I had so much
difficulty in crossing. Turning to the right, I followed its
course for some time, hoping to get round it, but it seemed to
extend towards the hills, cutting off all farther progress. The
sun was now about to set, and getting desperate, I plunged into
the thicket, and tried to push through the swamp. There was no
water, but the immense quantities of bind-weed, and other
thickly-growing plants, quite defied every attempt, and I was
obliged to turn back again. Tip and myself had now to retrace our
steps. It was getting dusk, and the state of affairs looked
uncomfortable. Again we tried in vain to cross the swamp, which
soon afterwards receded farther from the hills, and left a broad
plain before us, which we traversed in the course of half an
hour.</p>

<p>My foot seemed to get better with exercise, but night had now
set in, and it was useless to attempt making farther progress,
when we could not distinguish an object thirty feet in advance. I
now found myself stumbling up a rising ground covered with trees;
and here I lay down, with Tip at my side, to wait as patiently as
possible for morning. The dog, I imagine, had found some water in
the swamp, as he did not now seem to be suffering from thirst as
I was myself. He was soon asleep, and I envied him, for hours
elapsed before I could find repose. The land-wind, sweeping down
from the hill-side, moaned through the trees; the rising moon
shed her sickly and distorting light upon the bushes around; and
bruised and stiff, hungry, thirsty, and uncomfortable, I felt by
no means delighted with my quarters. A fire would have been
agreeable, but there were no means of procuring one. Sleep at
last befriended me, and I did not wake until the sun began to
shed his first rays upon the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>On rising I found myself exceedingly stiff, and by no means in
good condition for walking, but there was no choice; and when Tip
had got upon his legs, and given himself a good stretch and yawn,
and licked my hand, as much as to say he had no intention of
leaving me in the lurch, we started on our doubtful journey. In
vain I tried to encourage the dog to lead the way; he would not
stir from my side. Only once he darted after a kangaroo-rat, and
caught it before it had gone twenty yards. This afforded a
breakfast which I envied him. I now pushed on towards the coast,
but was continually intercepted by thick swamps impossible to
penetrate, and turned from the right direction. I looked about
for water, and found some at length in a muddy hole. It was most
refreshing, and revived my spirits, which had begun to flag
considerably.</p>

<p>Mid-day was long past, and I was still rambling over plains of
coarse grass, penetrating into woods, and struggling through
swamps; worn almost to death with fatigue and hunger, and the
pain of my ankle, now greatly swollen, I sat down at last at the
foot of a mahogany-tree in order to gain a little rest.</p>

<p>I knew that the hills were behind me, and the sea must be
somewhere before me, but as to my precise locality, and the
distance of the nearest settler's house, I was quite at a loss.
In vain I tried to satisfy myself as to whether I was much to the
south of the bivouac. I was growing dizzy with hunger and
weariness, and no longer felt any wonder at the confusion of mind
which seizes upon those who are lost in the wilderness. During
the day, I had repeatedly cooeyed as loudly as I could, in the
faint hope of attracting the attention of my friends; but no
voice responded.</p>

<p>It was now nearly five o'clock in the evening, and I had the
prospect before me of spending another night in solitude, and
felt some misgivings as to whether it would not be the last of my
existence.</p>

<p>I tried to struggle on a little farther, as it was possible
that I might be close to some farm on the Serpentine; but it was
difficult to move along. Tip seemed to be getting tired of this
slow progress; he grew fidgety, and I fancied he had formed the
base resolution of leaving me to myself. Suddenly he started off
upon our traces, and I was alone without a friend.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I heard behind me a distant shout, and
immediately afterwards a loud cooey met my ear. Oh how thankfully
I heard it, and answered it as loudly as I could! And then,
having returned grateful acknowledgments to the Almighty for this
seasonable relief, I began to walk towards the sounds, which were
repeated from minute to minute. Not long afterwards I perceived a
party of natives, followed by men on horseback, emerging from the
trees. The latter galloped towards me, waving their hats, and
shouting with friendly joy. It is due to Tip to state that he
reached me first, and gave his congratulations with warm
sincerity.</p>

<p>My friends had started at day-break with the natives, who had
tracked my footsteps without once losing the trail. They had
found the horse grazing near the place where I had left him, but
he was too lame to be removed; the natives had fully accounted
for every trace; they perceived that the dog and kangaroo had
lain side by side, and that the latter had recovered first, and
got away. They found and brought with them the saddle and bridle,
and followed my steps to the swamp, through which they saw I had
not been able to penetrate. And so they tracked me during the
whole of the day, whilst I was only going farther and farther
from my friends. I had wandered much more to the south than I
expected; and now, mounting a horse, we all rode to a house on
the Serpentine, where we were hospitably entertained, and where I
continued until able to return to Perth.</p>

<p>One evening in March, 1844, whilst standing at my gate
enjoying the pleasant balmy air and the conversation of a friend,
our attention was attracted to a luminous appearance in the sky
immediately above the horizon. We fancied that a large ship must
be on fire not a great distance from the coast.</p>

<p>The next evening, happening to leave the house at an early
hour, my eye was immediately caught by a grant novelty in the
heavens. A magnificent comet extended itself over an entire fifth
of the firmament. Its tail reached to the belt of Orion, whilst
its nucleus, a ball of fire resembling a star of the fourth
magnitude, was scarcely a degree above the horizon. It looked
like a fiery messenger rushing headlong down from the very
presence of GOD, bound with dread tidings for some distant world.
Beautiful, yet terrible messenger, it seemed to leave its long,
fiery trace behind it in its passage through the heavens. The
soul of the spectator was filled with the sense of its beauty,
whilst admiration was sublimed into awe. Speaking to us strange
and wonderful things of the hidden Holy of Holies which it seemed
to have left, it passed on its headlong journey of billions and
trillions of miles with the glad speed of a love-inspired
emanation from the Most High. It left us to wonder at its
transient visit, and to wish in vain for its return.*</p>

<p>[footnote] *This comet, having exactly the appearance I have
described, was visible nearly a week, gradually disappearing in
the northern heavens.</p>

<p>Whether it had or not any effect upon the season, I cannot
say, but the ensuing six months were the most unhealthy period
ever known in the colony. The natives, who were greatly alarmed
by the sudden appearance of the comet, declared that it would
cause many people to be mendik and die--so universal is the
belief in the portentous and malign influence of these
phenomena.</p>

<p>In general, as I have before observed, the climate is most
salubrious. "The Comparative Statement of Deaths to the
Population" proves the vast superiority of Western Australia in
this respect, not only over Great Britain, but over neighbouring
colonies. I refer to the able, interesting, and
carefully-prepared Reports of G. F. Stone, Esq. the Colonial
Registrar-General of Births, Marriages, and Deaths. Taking his
data from the Parliamentary Reports of 1836, he deduces the
following:</p>

<p>Comparative Statement of Deaths to the Population.</p>

<pre>
Western Australia . . . . . . . . . .1 death in 94 21/41
Van Dieman's Land . . . . . . . . . .1   "      65 161/220
Cape of Good Hope . . . . . . . . . .1   "      60 1/3

Mauritius . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1   "      44 2/5
</pre>

<p>The opinions of medical men, published in different reports, a
few of which happen now to lie before me, may prove interesting
to some readers, and I therefore extract them briefly:--</p>

<p>J. M. Johnson, Esq. M.D. Surgeon of H.M.S. Sulphur:-- "During
the three years that H.M.S. Sulphur was employed on that station
(Western Australia) not a single death, and very few important
cases of disease occurred, notwithstanding the very great
exposure of her men. When exploring the country for several days,
and sometimes weeks, they have been exposed to the sun; fatigued
in the evening after a day's excursion, slept in the open air,
(and that repeatedly in wet weather,) and suffered no
inconvenience. I have no hesitation in stating that such a life
in any other climate would have been productive of the most
serious sickness."</p>

<p>William Milligen, Esq. M.D. Surgeon 6th Dragoons:-- "I have
met with several individuals here, who, on leaving England, were
great sufferers from dyspepsia, and diseases of the digestive
organs, who have recovered their health in a wonderful degree
since their arrival. Children thrive remarkably well; and I may
add that every description of live stock, although collected from
different countries--England, India, America, Africa, etc.--find
here a congenial temperature."</p>

<p>Joseph Harris, Esq. Acting Government Surgeon:-- "Nothing can
be more delightful than the climate generally; and its
invigorating influences on the human constitution, especially
those of Europeans, render it more fit for invalids than any
other in the world. Several persons arrived in the colony
suffering from pulmonary and bronchial affections, asthma,
phthisis, haemoptysis, or spitting of blood, hopeless of recovery
in England, are now perfectly restored, or living in comparative
health--measles and small-pox are unknown."</p>

<p>W. H. Sholl, Esq. Government Surgeon, pro tempore:-- "From
pulmonary complaints we are happily free; and even when these
have gone to some length in other countries, removal to this
climate has been of the highest possible benefit. Children are
exempt from the diseases common to them in England;--small-pox,
measles, scarlet-fever, and hooping-cough, are unknown here."</p>

<p>W. P. Dineley, Esq. Surgeon of Fremantle Gaol:-- "We have
almost a cloudless sky, a clear dry atmosphere, and a climate
unsurpassed by any in the world."</p>

<p>Dr. Ferguson, of Australind:-- "We have no fevers or epidemics
here."</p>

<p>By the Registrar-General's Report for 1843, it appears that
the births in Western Australia are about 1 to 24 83/158, which
is a very high rate. Those readers who are fond of statistics
will be pleased to learn the following rather curious fact:--In
the year 1836, males were in respect to females, as about five to
three, but during the following seven years, females increased 21
per cent. more than males; and the continued preponderance of
female births promises speedily to adjust the balance of the
sexes.</p>

<p>The Registrar-General in his Report for 1844, makes the
following interesting observations:-- "Supposing the whole
population of the colony were now grown up and unmarried, out of
every 100 males, as many as 67 could find wives.</p>

<p>"Supposing the total population UNDER TWELVE were now of age,
and wished to marry; out of every 100 males 97 could find
wives.</p>

<p>"Supposing the total population OF PERTH were now grown up,
and unmarried, 87 out of every 100 males could find wives.</p>

<p>"But supposing the population OF PERTH UNDER TWELVE were grown
up, and wished to marry, out of 100 FEMALES, only 85 could find
husbands."</p>

<p>The temperature of the atmosphere is exceedingly dry, and
therefore the heat is not oppressive, though the thermometer may
stand at a high degree.</p>

<p>A rainy day in February or March is an extremely rare
occurrence at Perth, though not unusual at Australind, a hundred
miles southward.</p>

<p>In the hottest weather, farm-labourers work all day in the
open air, and feel no more inconvenience than reapers do in
England. This is owing to the dryness and elasticity of the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>I have no recorded observations of a late date, but the
following table is extracted from the journal of an obliging
friend, Robert Dale, Esq., who, when a Lieutenant in the 63d
regiment, was stationed some years in the colony.</p>

<p>The thermometer was kept in a cool house at Perth, from March,
1830 to June 1831.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 28.</h3>

<h4>THE BOTANY OF THE COLONY.</h4>

<p>Baron Hugel, Dr. Lindley, and Sir William Hooker, have
published lists of Western Australian shrubs and plants, but the
most complete and elaborate work on the botany of Western
Australia is the series of nineteen letters published in the
"Inquirer," by Mr. Drummond, of Hawthornden, in the colony, and
from them we shall compile the present chapter; but, interesting
as they are in their fullest and most minute details to
botanists, it is possible that they may be TOO descriptive and
extend too much into detail for general readers, and we shall
therefore abstain from giving a catalogue of the various
indigenous plants, and confine our remarks to the more useful
ones.* The first to which Mr. Drummond alludes is the blackboy,
of which there are several varieties. The glaucus-leaved York
blackboy is, however, the most important, and grows thirty feet
in height without a branch. It is considered by the settlers the
best material for thatch, and the young and tender leaves are
found to be an agreeable vegetable, and also fodder for horses,
goats, sheep, and cattle. The natives are particularly fond of
the blackboy, whilst its sound old flower-stalks furnish them
with the means of obtaining a light by friction. the native yam,
of the class Dioeceae, is stated by Mr. Drummond to be the finest
esculent vegetable the colony produces. The fungi, or mushrooms,
are also palatable to the Aborigines; one species belonging to
this order, and named the Boletus, is remarkable for possessing
the properties of German tinder, when well dried, and for
emitting a radiant light in its natural state.</p>

<p>[footnote] *This brief compilation is the work of Alexander
Andrews, Esq.</p>

<p>There are seventy species of grasses. The genus stripa has
several varieties, of which the seeds are injurious to sheep,
penetrating into the wool, and sometimes into the carcase and
causing death. By adopting the precaution of shearing before the
seeds are ripe, this mischief is however obviated. Another
description is distinguished as elegantissima, from its beautiful
appearance, and is used as a decoration, and for ornamenting
rooms.</p>

<p>The bulrush of Scripture is found here, and is used by coopers
to stanch their work. A large jointed rush has also been found of
great service, and introduced in the walls of houses to
advantage, and some varieties of the Restiaceae are useful in
thatch work; and in his sixth letter, Mr. Drummond mentions the
buttack as very useful in tyings. A climbing species of the
Thysanotus, near the Moore river, is much used by the natives as
food. The Madge and the Guardine are roots from which the natives
extract nutritious food; the pigs are also fond of them, and
besides these there are other white roots used as food by the
natives.</p>

<p>The oak-leaved Chenopodium is supposed to contain essential
oil; it was formerly used by the settlers as a vegetable, and is
proved to contain carbonate of soda, so that, as Mr. Drummond
suggests, "it would be worth inquiry at what price we could
afford barilla as an export." The Erythraea Australis is, we are
informed, a good substitute, and is used as such, for hops; and
one species of tobacco is indigenous to the colony. The
sow-thistle of Swan River was, in the early days of the
settlement, used as a vegetable, but is now eaten only by the
domestic animals, by whom it is much relished. As a salad, it is
said to be scarcely inferior to endive. The Helicrysum, a
biennial of the Vasse district, is a grateful fodder for horses,
and the Morna nitida for goats, sheep, and cattle, as are also
several species of Picris and other shrubs. There is also a
native celery, which forms a poor substitute for that of Europe;
two varieties of this species are mentioned--the Conna, of which
the roots are eaten by the natives after being peeled, and the
Kukire, the foot of which resembles the carrot in appearance,
with the smell and colour of the parsnip. The wild carrot is also
an excellent vegetable, and from its root rich wine has been
extracted. The order Eryngo has a species of which the roots when
candied have great restorative powers. Of the Hederoma latifolia,
Dr. Lindley remarks, that its half-ripe fruits, if sent to
Europe, would give several original and valuable scents to the
perfumer.</p>

<p>Of the sea-weeds, one particular species, supposed to be the
Fucus amylaeceus, thrown in great quantities upon the coast, is
mentioned as forming when boiled, sweetened, and spiced, a
nutritious and beautiful jelly of a fine rose colour; and as it
appears that it may be dried without injury and preserved for
years, it would be of value as an export.</p>

<p>The catalogue of indigenous fruits is not very extensive, but
one species, belonging to the order Epacrideae, is reported to
bear very palatable berries. The Vasse apple, of the size of a
peach, is stated when boiled with sugar to be an agreeable
sweet-meat.</p>

<p>Another fruit, of the species Mesembryanthemum, is of a less
pleasing flavour; but one of the same species, resembling the
English gooseberry, is said to be delicious. Mr. Drummond also
records the discovery, southward of the Vasse, of a nondescript
shrub of about five feet in height, and bearing fruit as large as
a middle-sized plum, of a fine purple colour, covered with a rich
bloom, and having a stone similar to the plum. It is reported to
have a pleasing taste. This completes the list of fruits, which
Mr. Drummond acknowledges to be imperfect, as the cultivation of
the vine, olive, currant, and other imported fruits has withdrawn
the attention of the settlers from the native productions; and we
shall now pass to the smaller classes of the Eucalyptus tribe.
The Doatta is a species of this class, and the bark of its root
is much relished by the natives, having a sweet and pleasing
taste, as is also the trunk of the red-gum; and its leaves,
washed in water, form an agreeable beverage. They also collect a
description of manna from the leaves of the York gum, which
yields a considerable quantity of saccharine matter. The common
green wattle of the genus of Acacia is found plentifully on the
alluvial flats of the Swan, and the bark is much used for
tanning; and the gum-wattle of the same order produces so great a
quantity of gum as to demand the attention of exporters. Another
shrub of this order is found in the Vasse district, and produces
galls similar to those of the oak, which might also be collected
for exportation. The gum of some of these species is used by the
natives as food, and the seeds, when ground, give them a
tolerable substitute for flour.</p>

<p>Instead of entering more at large into dry botanical details,
I will transfer to these pages a letter from my respected friend,
Mr. James Drummond, the botanist already alluded to, which
perhaps will prove more acceptable to the general reader.</p>

<p>This letter was published at the time in the local
journals.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,--I send you a few extracts from a journal of
observations which I made in a journey to the north, in company
with Mr. Gilbert, the ornithologist.* My sons had heard from the
natives that a considerable river and lakes of fresh water were
to be found about two days' journey to the north of their station
on the Moore River; and in company with Captain Scully, the
Government Resident of this district, they determined to explore
the country in that direction. Mr. Phillips and some other
gentlemen who were to be of the party, as well as Mr. Gilbert and
myself, arrived at the station too late; I shall therefore
principally confine my observations to Mr. Gilbert's transactions
and my own.</p>

<p>[footnote] * Mr. Gilbert, an enthusiastic naturalist, and an
amiable and highly respectable man, was treacherously murdered by
natives to the North-East of New Holland, whilst engaged upon a
scientific expedition.</p>

<p>"We left Hawthornden on the 22d August, and slept at the
residence of Captain Scully, who had set out some days before to
join the exploring party. On the 23d we proceeded on our journey
to the north, and in about five or six miles we examined some
remarkable masses of granite rocks a little to the right of the
road which is formed by our carts and horses passing to and from
the Moore River. Mr. Gilbert found a small but curious
fresh-water shell in some pools of rain-water on the rocks, and I
found two plants which I had not seen before. In about eleven or
twelve miles from Captain Scully's we reached a permanent spring
called Yoolgan, where there is excellent grass, and where we
stopped to dine and feed our horses. Soon after leaving Yoolgan,
we met with Mr. Phillips and Mr. John Mackie returning; they had
arrived at our station a day too late for the party; we therefore
knew that our hurrying on to join them was useless. In ten or
twelve miles from Yoolgan we reached Yeinart, a tea-tree swamp,
where there is grass and water to be had throughout the year. The
night threatened to rain, but we arrived too late to do much in
the house-making way; fortunately, the rain kept off until
daylight, when we soon covered our house with tea-tree bark, and
determined to stop for the day, which I consider the best way, as
no collections can be made when it is raining, and provisions and
everything get spoiled. It cleared up about ten o'clock, and we
went to visit a brushwood swamp, where my son Johnston had shot
several specimens of a beautiful species of kangaroo with a
dark-coloured fur, overtopped with silvery hairs, called Marnine
by the natives: we saw plenty of tracks of the animals, but could
not see a single specimen. On the top of a hill to the north of
the swamp I succeeded in finding two very distinct species of
Dryandra, new to me. I also found a fine species of Eucalyptus in
flower, which is distinguished from the Matilgarring of the
natives, the Eucalyptus macrocarpus of Sir W. T. Hooker, by
having lengthened recurved flower-stalks; the flowers are
rose-coloured.</p>

<p>"On the 25th we proceeded on our journey. I observed two new
species of acacia near Yeinart. We mistook our road, and made our
old station at Badgee-badgee, where we stopped to dine and feed
our horses. I also found some curious aquatic plants in the pools
of water among the rocks at Badgee-badgee. After dinner we
succeeded with difficulty in tracing our road to our present
station on the Mouran pool, the cart tracks being nearly
obliterated by the trampling of the sheep. On arriving, we found
that the exploring party had returned, and that Captain Scully
and my son James had left, on their return, about half an hour
before our arrival. The mutilated specimens of plants brought
home by the party, and the accounts of some which were left
behind, determined me to visit the new river myself, after
botanizing a day in the vicinity of the station, where I found a
fine glaucus-leaved Anadenia, and Mr. Gilbert got specimens of
the blue kangaroo, and several small new quadrupeds--one of them
apparently a true rat, almost as large and mischievous as the
Norway rat. Having got two natives, one of whom (Cabbinger) had
been with the party to the north, we started on the 27th, and
slept at a spring called Boorbarna. On the way I found a species
of the common poison which I had not seen before, and a beautiful
Conospermum, with pannicles of blue flowers varying to white. I
was informed, by my son Johnston, that a plant like horehound,
but with scarlet flowers, in tubes about an inch long, grew on
the top of a stony hill to the north of the spring; I went and
found the plant, which belongs to Scrophularinae; I also found a
Manglesia, allied to Tridentifera, but having the leaves more
divided; I also found a beautiful blue climbing plant, a species
of Pronaya, on the top of the same hill. On the 28th, soon after
setting out on our journey, I found two splendid species of
everlasting flower, of which my son Johnston had been the
original discoverer; one, with golden-yellow flowers varying to
white, has the flowers in heads different from anything of the
sort I have seen before, and will, I think, form a new genus of
Compositae; and the other with pink flowers, growing two feet
high, something like Lawrencella rosea, or Rhodanthe Manglesii,
but if possible finer than either. In nine or ten miles to the
north of Boorbarna, we crossed a curious tract of country,
covered with what I considered a variety of quartz, which breaks
with a conchoidal fracture, but it has very much the appearance
of flint; in many places the pieces were large, with sharp
angles; my sons complained that it injured their horses' feet,
but by alighting, and leading our horses over the worse parts, I
did not perceive any bad effects from it. This tract of country
produces some interesting plants; a splendid Calathamnus, with
leaves nine inches long, and showy scarlet flowers, was found by
my youngest son, and I got plenty of specimens.</p>

<p>"With regard to a new Banksia, allied to Aquifolia, which he
found here, I was not so fortunate, and he brought home no
specimens. After crossing several miles of this quartz formation,
we came upon an extensive flat of strong clay, covered with
Eucalyptus, and some curious species of acacia; we crossed a
considerable river, or brook, running strong to the west, and
about two miles, after crossing this brook, we made the river we
were in quest of at a place called Murarino by the natives. Near
the river I found a splendid plant, which had been first observed
by my son Johnston; he took it for a Lasiopetalum, but I expect
it will prove to be a species of Solanum; it grows two or three
feet high, with large purple flowers, with calyxes like brown
velvet; the leaves are irregularly shaped, acuminate, about two
inches long, and an inch and a half wide at their broadest parts;
the stems are prickly, and all the leaves covered with a down as
in Lasiopetalum. I am uncertain about the genus, not having seen
the seed-vessels, but whatever that may be, it is of our finest
Australian plants.</p>

<p>"We stopped to dine on the river, and in about four miles
farther to the north, we reached two fresh-water lakes called
Dalarn and Maradine. Ducks of various sorts were here in
thousands, and the water-hens, or gallinules, which visited the
settlements on the Swan some years ago, were plentiful. Mr.
Gilbert shot three or four at a shot. I found a fine Baechia,
which had been first found by my son James, and a curious new
plant belonging to Compositae, but not yet in flower. The
appearance of the country about these lakes, of which there are
several besides those I have named, and the plants which grow
about them, which are generally met with at no great distance
from the sea, seem to prove that the lakes are at no great
distance from it, and that the Darling Range does not extend so
far to the north. No hills of any description appeared to the
west; from the top of a hill to the east, two remarkable hills
appeared, apparently about thirty miles to the north; one of them
was observed by my son to have a remarkable peaked top, and they
supposed they might be Mount Heathcote and Wizard Peak. We saw,
as we came along, a high hill, which the natives called Wangan
Catta; they said it was three days' walk to it; it lay due east
of our course.</p>

<p>"On the 29th, we returned on our track for about seven miles,
until we reached the first running river we met on our journey to
the north. Our guides agreed to take us back by a different
route, and to take us to a hill where a curious species of
kangaroo called Damar by them, would be met with. My son Johnston
has shot several of these animals about a day's walk to the east
of our station on the Moore River. We therefore ascended this
river in a course S.E. by E., and soon after we were upon its
banks, we came upon a grassy country; three or four miles up we
stopped to dine and feed the horses, at a place called Nugadrine;
several pairs of beautiful falcons, the Falco Nypolencus of
Gould, were flying over us, and Mr. Gilbert succeeded in shooting
one of them. After dinner, we proceeded in the same direction for
nine or ten miles; we soon crossed the tracks of Captain Scully
and my sons on their return; they had gone up the main or
northern branch of the river, and had found but little grass
while they followed its banks; but they had passed over a great
deal of grassy land in crossing the country from it to the Moore
River.</p>

<p>"We travelled for ten or eleven miles through a splendid
grassy country, and met with a large tribe of natives, several of
whom had never seen white men before; they were very friendly,
and offered us some of their favourite root, the wyrang, which
grows abundantly among these grassy hills. They made so much
noise, that we wished to get some distance from them to sleep,
but they all followed us and encamped near, many of the single
men sleeping by our fire. In the morning of the 30th I went to
the top of a hill, near our bivouac, while Mr. Gilbert was
superintending the preparations for breakfast, and clipping the
beards of some of our new friends. After breakfast, we started
direct for our station on the Moore River; the natives who were
with us as guides considering our stock of flour insufficient to
proceed any farther in the direction of the hill where they
expected to find the Damars. For almost the whole of this day we
travelled over the most splendid grassy country I have ever seen
in Australia; the hill-sides, as far as we could see in every
direction, were covered with beautiful grass, and of a golden
colour, from the flowers of the beautiful yellow everlasting
flower which I have described in a former part of this letter,
which is only to be found in the richest soil. After reaching our
station, I was a day or two employed in drying my specimens of
plants. My son Johnston pointed out a most beautiful new
Dryandra, which he had discovered on the top of a hill near the
Mouran-pool; I have named the species Dryandra floribunda, from
its numerous blossoms, which almost hide the leaves; it grows
twelve or fifteen feet high, and in such abundance, that the side
of the hill on which it grows actually appears of a golden colour
for several miles. I consider it the most beautiful species of
the genus yet known for cultivation.</p>

<p>"I am, Sir, "Your obedient servant, "James Drummond.</p>

<p>"P.S.--Our course generally by compass from Hawthornden to
these lakes has been several points to the west of north. The
natives informed us, when at the lakes, that they could reach the
sea-coast long before sunset.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 29.</h3>

<h4>MISFORTUNES OF THE COLONY.</h4>

<p>Many causes have unhappily united to keep Western Australia
from rising into notice and importance with that rapidity which
has marked the career of the other Australian colonies. The
misfortunes of the first settlers, attributable in a great
measure to flagrant mismanagement, deterred intending emigrants
from tempting the like fate. The man who had the largest grant in
the colony allotted to him--a monster grant of 250,000
acres--made so ill an use of the means at his command, that
nothing but misery and misfortune has ever attended his steps.
The funds with which he was intrusted might have been applied
with the happiest effect, both for the advancement of the colony
and of his own personal fortunes. The people whom he brought out,
chiefly mechanics and labourers, to the number of four hundred or
upwards, were sufficient to have formed a settlement of their
own. By an unhappy fatality, the early settlers were landed on a
part of the coast the most unfavourable in the world for their
purposes. The whole country around them was a mere limestone
rock. Here, however, the town-site of Clarence was fixed upon,
but scarcely a yard of land was to be found that afforded space
for a garden. No attempt was made to sow grain, or plant
potatoes, to provide for the wants of the following year.</p>

<p>The people lived upon the provisions they had brought out with
them. The four hundred workmen being left by their principal
without direction or employment, soon consumed in riotous living
the abundant stores left at their disposal, and too soon found
that destitution is the inevitable consequence of idleness and
folly. Many perished miserably of want and sickness, and many
others effected their escape to Van Dieman's Land, where they
gave a melancholy account of the wretchedness of those who were
unable to flee from the scene of their errors.</p>

<p>The active intelligence, and unremitting exertions of the
Governor, Sir James Stirling, at length ameliorated the condition
of the unfortunate settlers. He removed the seat of Government to
Perth, and explored the neighbouring country in every direction
in the hope of finding tracts of land sufficient for the support
of the people under his charge. The flats of the Swan River
afforded all the facilities he required; but the settlers were
greatly intimidated by the treacherous attacks of the natives,
and were very reluctant to separate from the main body. In
consequence of these fears, many consumed their capital in their
present support, instead of applying it in the formation of
farms, and laying the ground-work of future prosperity.
Provisions being all imported, were sold at high rates, and the
hesitating colonists became unavoidably subservient to the
cupidity of the traders.</p>

<p>In addition to these misfortunes, no man liked to lay out his
money in building a house upon land which might not eventually be
allotted to him. He lived therefore, with his wife, children, and
servants, miserably under a tent, until the surveyor-general
should be able to point out to him the land which had fallen to
his share, in the general lottery of the Government. In many
cases this was not done for one or two years after the formation
of the colony, in consequence of the lamentably inefficient force
placed at the disposal of the able and indefatigable
surveyor-general; and even then, the boundaries of the different
allotments were not permanently defined. This state of
incertitude had the most fatal effect, not only upon the
fortunes, but upon the moral condition of the settlers. Those who
had come out resolutely bent upon cultivating their own land, and
supporting themselves and families by their manual labour,
refused to make the necessary exertions upon property which might
eventually belong to others for whom they had no desire to toil.
Waiting, therefore, in their tents on the shore, until the
Government should determine their respective locations, they
passed the time in idleness, or in drinking and riotous living;
and when at length they obtained their Letters of Allocation,
they found themselves without money or any means of subsistence,
except by hiring out their manual labour to others more prudent,
or more fortunate.</p>

<p>Other accidental circumstances have combined to retard the
progress of the colony. From ignorance of the seasons, many lost
their crops, and were obliged consequently to expend the last
remains of their capital in procuring necessary supplies. From
the same cause, vessels which brought emigrants to the colony
were not secured during the winter season in the safest
anchorages, and being exposed to the fury of the north-west
gales, were in too many instances, driven ashore and completely
wrecked.</p>

<p>Again, too, there has always existed a strong desire on the
part of Western Australia to connect herself with India,
conscious that there are great facilities of communication
between the countries, from favourable trade-winds, and that her
own climate is perhaps better suited to invalids than even that
of the Cape. This desire has been met by several influential
gentleman of Calcutta, and on two occasions, vessels were
freighted and despatched from that city to the colony, in the
hope of establishing a mutually advantageous connexion, and on
both occasions the vessels were lost on the voyage. At length a
small establishment was effected near Australind, by the agents
of Mr. W. H. Prinsep, for the purpose of breeding horses for the
Indian market; and we most sincerely hope success will ultimately
attend the enterprising effort. Indian officers have occasionally
visited the colony; but they have naturally received unfavourable
impressions, from being unable to find those accommodations and
luxuries to which they had been accustomed.</p>

<p>The settlers will not build houses and lay out their money on
the mere speculation of gaining advantage by the visits of Indian
officers, but if once there appeared a reasonable prospect of
early remuneration, every convenience would be provided, and
every comfort ensured to visitors. Living is now extremely cheap,
and there is a profusion of vegetables and fruits of every kind.
There are plenty of good horses and pleasure-boats, and there are
the amusements of fishing, and hunting the Kangaroo and Emu.</p>

<p>The misconduct of some, and the misfortunes of others of the
early settlers, tended to bring about calamities which were
echoed throughout Great Britain, and for many years had the
effect of turning the stream of emigration away from these
shores. Other causes have also contributed to this end. The
Government plan of giving grants of land to emigrants,
proportioned to the capital which they introduced into the
colony, was good to a certain extent, but the object was
perverted, and the boon abused. In almost all instances, men
received a much greater quantity of land than they were justly
entitled to. Every article of provisions, furniture, and
household effects, and even wearing apparel, were taken into
account. The valuations were made by friends and neighbours, who
accommodated one another, and rated the property of the applicant
at a most astounding price. The consequence has been, that large
grants of land have fallen into the hands of those who have never
lived upon them, or spent anything upon their improvement, beyond
a fictitious amount which they were required to specify to the
Government before they could obtain possession of their deeds of
grant. These original grantees have clung to their lands with
desperate tenacity, in the hope that some day their value will be
more than nominal. The idea that all the best portions of the
colony are in the hands of a few great unimproving proprietors,
has been one reason why emigrants have turned away from it.</p>

<p>But the provision, which has so long been an evil to the
colony, may now be looked upon, thanks to the narrow-minded
policy of the Home Government, as an advantage. These original
grants, which have proved so little beneficial to the owner, and
so highly detrimental to the community, are now far more easily
obtainable by the emigrant than the surrounding crown-lands. The
policy of the Government has entirely changed with regard to the
disposal of waste lands in the Australian colonies; instead of
giving them away with a lavish hand, it has for some years been
the practice to throw every obstacle in the way of intending
purchasers.</p>

<p>They are now valued at one pound per acre, though it is well
known, even at the colonial office, that five acres of Australian
land are requisite to maintain a single sheep; and as the average
value of sheep in all these colonies is six or seven shillings,
it scarcely requires the head of a Secretary of State to
calculate that every one who buys land for the purpose of feeding
his flocks upon it, must be content to purchase it at an
irreparable loss of capital. In consequence of this wise
regulation, no purchase of crown-lands are now made in any of the
Australian colonies, except of town allotments, which have a
factitious value, altogether irrespective of the qualities of the
soil. It is now that the holders of large grants find purchasers,
as they are extremely willing to sell at a much lower rate than
the crown. In Western Australia alone, however, are these grants
to be found; and here excellent land may be purchased at three
shillings an acre. Thus the careless profusion of one government,
and the false policy and unhappy cupidity of another, have proved
the means of placing this colony in a better position in some
respects than any other.</p>

<p>Western Australia has been unfortunate also in having had no
powerful company to support her cause in England. The
neighbouring colony of South Australia, with a much less
extensive territory, and without any natural superiority in the
quality of the soil, was immediately puffed into notice by the
exertions of her friends at home.</p>

<p>But whilst the settlers at Adelaide and their patrons in
London, proclaimed to the world the advantages of the new colony,
they scrupled not to draw comparisons between it and the Western
settlement, that were neither flattering nor just to the latter.
Not content with elevating their own idol with paeans and
thanksgiving, before the gaze of a bedinned public, they
persisted in shouting out their scorn and contempt at the
pretensions of their unhappy neighbour. The public, with its
usual discernment, gave implicit credence to both fables. Western
Australia had met its contumelious detractors with silence; and
the false statements were therefore looked upon as admitted and
undeniable. But notwithstanding the injurious misrepresentations
of enemies, and her own injurious silence, this colony has been
quietly and steadily progressing, until she has laid for herself
a foundation that no envious calumny can shake. The last blow she
has received was from the failure of the settlement at
Australind; a subject that I intend to treat of in a separate
chapter.</p>

<p>So many misfortunes and untoward accidents have combined to
prejudice the emigrating portion of the British public against
Western Australia, that no voice is ever raised in her behalf,
and scarcely any literary journal condescends to acknowledge her
existence. And yet, notwithstanding the veil of darkness that
conceals her from Northern eyes, there is perhaps no spot in the
world that contains so eminently within itself the elements of
prosperity and happiness. A climate more genial, more divine than
that of Italy, robs poverty of its bleakness and its bitterness.
Absolute want is never felt, and those who possess but little,
find how little is sufficient in a climate so productive and so
beneficent.</p>

<p>The purity and elasticity of the atmosphere induce a continual
flow of good spirits.</p>

<p>To all the fruits of Italy in most abundant profusion, are
added the productions of the East.</p>

<p>The regularity of the seasons is so certain, that the
husbandman always reckons with confidence upon his crops. No
droughts interfere, AS IN THE OTHER COLONIES, to ruin his hopes.
the vintages, annually increasing and improving, are equally free
from disappointment.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be denied that there are many natural
disadvantages which can never be overcome without a much larger
population.</p>

<p>In the first place, the only good harbour on the Western coast
has only just been discovered--June 1846--and is at least
thirty-five miles distant from Perth, the capital. Then,
secondly, all the superior land of the colony is situated about
sixty miles back from the capital, and the farmers therefore have
a considerable distance to convey their produce to the port; and
part of that distance the roads are extremely bad.</p>

<p>There is another objection to the colony in the opinion of
intending emigrants, which arises from a small plant, or shrub,
of the order leguminosae, a deadly poison to sheep and cattle.
This plant grows over the colony in patches, but is now so well
known, that accidents very seldom occur from it, shepherds being
careful not to allow their flocks to feed in its vicinity. It is
however to be observed, that neither sheep nor cattle will feed
upon this plant unless they be very hungry, and other food be
wanting. It is very seldom indeed that cattle, which are
sometimes left to roam at large over the country, are found to
have perished from pasturing upon it. This plant has no injurious
effect upon horses; but these animals have in several instances
been poisoned by eating the leaves of a small plant described as
resembling the ranunculus, which grows in small quantities in the
Southern portion of the colony. A gentleman once informed me that
he was riding up from Australind on a favourite and very fine
horse, which he allowed to feed, during several hours of rest, on
a spot where this plant unfortunately grew. On mounting to resume
his journey, the horse seemed full of spirit; but he had not
proceeded a mile before it stumbled, and was with difficulty kept
from falling. A little farther on, after proceeding with evident
difficulty, it fell, to rise no more, and died in a few hours of
violent inflammation of the kidneys.</p>

<p>However alarming these drawbacks may seem to people at a
distance, they are only lightly considered in the colony.
Fatalities are very rare among the flocks and herds, and many
diseases which prevail in New South Wales are entirely unknown
among us.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 30.</h3>

<h4>THE RESOURCES OF THE COLONY:--HORSES FOR INDIA--WINE--DRIED
FRUITS--COTTON--COAL--WOOL--CORN--WHALE-OIL--A WHALE-HUNT--CURED
FISH--SHIP TIMBER.</h4>

<p>The geographical position of Western Australia makes it one of
the most desirable colonies of the British empire. The French
would be delighted to possess so advantageous a station in that
part of the world, whence they could sally forth and grievously
annoy our shipping-trade. Vessels bound for China and the Eastern
Islands pass within a few days' sail of the colony. For my part,
I confess I should feel by no means sorry were we to fall into
the hands of the French for a few years, as they would not
hesitate to make such lasting improvements as would materially
add to the importance of the settlement. It requires that
Government should be made to feel the value of this colony as a
naval station before it will rise into anything like consequence.
The anchorage of Cockburn Sound, lying between Garden Island and
the main land, presents a splendid harbour, where hundreds of
ships of war might lie throughout all weathers in perfect safety.
Enemy's cruisers passing along the coast cannot come within
Garden Island from the south, and they would scarcely venture
without a pilot from the north, except with a great deal of
deliberation and caution, so that small vessels might readily
slip away and avoid the danger; and numbers of ships might lie so
close under Garden Island, that they never would be perceived by
men-of-war reconnoitring the coast.</p>

<p>There is no other colony in Australia so admirably situated
with respect to other countries. The Cape of Good Hope is four or
five weeks sail distant; Ceylon about twenty days; Calcutta,
Sincapore, and Batavia are all within easy reach. In exporting
live-stock, this is of vast importance; and in time of war a
central position like this would afford an admirable place for
vessels to repair to in order to refit. With the finest timber in
the world for naval purposes in unlimited profusion; with a soil
teeming with various metals; with harbours and dock-yards almost
ready made by the hand of Nature, all things requisite for the
wants of shipping may be obtained whenever a Government shall see
fit to resort to them.</p>

<p>It must doubtless surprise many that more has not been done in
a colony possessing such natural advantages. The reason is, that
the prejudices which have so long prevailed against this
settlement have retarded the progress of immigration, and the
small number of inhabitants has ever precluded the possibility of
any great effort being made by the colony itself.</p>

<p>Public opinion in England must turn in its favour before it
can rise from obscurity into importance; but public opinion is
never in favour of the poor and deserted. Time, however, will
eventually develope those resources, which at present lie dormant
for want of capital and opportunity.</p>

<p>The proximity of this colony to India peculiarly marks it as
the most advantageous spot for the breeding of horses for that
market. From Van Dieman's Land or New South Wales, ships are
generally about eight weeks in reaching an Indian port, and must
proceed either by the north of New Holland, through the dangerous
navigation of Torres Straits, or by the south and west, round
Cape Lewin. Either route presents a long and rough passage,
highly detrimental to stock, and of course increasing the cost of
the horses exported. The voyage from Fremantle may be performed
in half the time, and the animals will therefore arrive at their
destination in much finer order, and with much less loss.</p>

<p>It is well known that none of these colonies afford better or
more extensive pasture-ground for horses and cattle than ours.
Nothing is wanted but capital and population to produce a
thriving traffic in horse-flesh between this settlement and
India.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that Western Australia will
one day become a great wine country. Its vineyards are becoming
more numerous and extensive every year, and the wine produced in
them is of a quality to lead us to believe that when the art of
preparing it is better understood, it will be found of very
superior quality. It will, however, be a new kind of wine; and
therefore, before it will be prized in Europe, prejudices in
favour of older wines have to be overcome. Soil and climate
combined, give to different wines their peculiar flavour. The
vines which in Madeira produce the wine of that name, when
brought to another country, even in a corresponding latitude, and
planted in soil that chemically approaches as closely as possible
to that which they have left, will produce a wine materially
different from that called Madeira. So with the vines of Xeres
and Oporto; of Teneriffe or Constantia. Different countries
produce wines peculiar to themselves; and the wine of Western
Australia will be found to be entirely sui generis. All that I
have tasted, though made from the poorest of grapes, the common
sweet-water, have one peculiarity; a good draught, instead of
affecting the head or flushing the face, causes a most delightful
glow to pervade the stomach; and it is of so comforting a nature,
that the labourers in harvest prefer the home-made colonial wine
to any other beverage. Every farm-settler is now adding a
vineyard to his estate. The olive is also being extensively
cultivated. In a few years' time, dried fruits will be exported
in large quantities; but we almost fear that the colonists are
giving too much of their attention to the cultivation of grapes
and other fruits. In addition to exports, on a large scale, of
wool, horses, timber, and metals, these articles of commerce are
not undeserving of attention, but they should not be brought so
prominently forward as to form the principal feature in the trade
of the colony. Wine and fruit countries are always poor
countries; let us think of substantials first, and of wine and
fruit only by way of dessert.</p>

<p>Cotton is a plant that grows extremely well in this colony,
and might be cultivated on a large scale, and doubtless with
great success. Mr. Hutt, the late governor, whose constant
anxiety to promote the interests of the settlers in every way
must long endear him to their memories, always appeared extremely
sanguine as to the practicability of making this a great cotton
country.</p>

<p>But Western Australia contains, perhaps, greater internal
wealth than that which appears on the surface. She abounds in
iron, which must some day come into the Indian market; and as the
metal lies close to the surface, it may be obtained without much
expenditure of capital. There is no doubt, also, that she is
equally rich in copper and platina, but capital is wanting at
present to enable the settlers to work the mines. Soon, however,
companies will be formed, and operations will be carried on
rivalling those of South Australia.</p>

<p>Extensive fields of excellent COAL have lately been
discovered, and will prove the source of vast wealth to the
colony. Steam-vessels in the Indian ocean will be supplied with
coal from Western Australia; and the depots at Sincapore,
Point-de-Galle, and perhaps at Aden, will afford a constant
market for this valuable commodity.</p>

<p>The staple export of the colony is, of course, at present
wool. Our flocks, unfortunately, increase in a much greater ratio
than the inhabitants, and thus the scarcity of labour becomes
severely felt. A large flock becomes an evil, and men are
burdened and impoverished by the very sources of wealth. The
expense of maintaining becomes greater than the returns. The
emigrants who are most sure of improving their condition in a
colony, are those men who begin as shepherds, and having
established a good character for themselves, undertake the care
of a flock upon shares; that is, they receive a certain
proportion--a third, and sometimes even a half--of the annual
increase and wool, delivering the remainder to the owner at the
seaport, ready packed for shipping. These men, of course, soon
acquire a flock of their own, and then abandon the original
employer to his old embarrassment, leaving him, (a resident
probably in the capital, and already a prey to multitudinous
distractions,) to find out a new shepherd on still more
exorbitant terms. As large grants of land may be obtained by
tenants for merely nominal rents, or in consideration of their
erecting stock-yards or farm-buildings in the course of a term of
years, there is every inducement to men of this class to become
settlers.</p>

<p>The houses in some districts are built of clay, or prepared
earth, rammed down between boards, and thus forming solid walls
of twelve or eighteen inches in thickness, that harden in a short
time almost to the consistency of stone. The windows and doorways
are cut out of the walls. These edifices are built at a very
cheap rate; and when laths or battens are fixed inside of them,
may be covered with plaister, and either whitewashed or
painted.</p>

<p>Besides the extensive sheep-runs of the colony, there is an
unlimited extent of excellent corn-land. The crops in the
Northam, Toodyay, and York districts--though inferior to those of
the midland counties of England, for want of manure, and a more
careful system of husbandry--are extremely fine; and there is
land enough, if cultivated, to supply the whole of the southern
hemisphere with grain.</p>

<p>The sea on the western coast of New Holland still abounds with
whales, although the Americans for many years made it one of
their principal stations, and have consequently driven many of
the animals away. The whale is a very suspicious and timid
creature, and when it has been once chased it seldom returns to
the same locality. The Americans tell us that Geographe Bay,
about twenty years ago, abounded with whales at certain seasons.
Many of them came there apparently to die, and the shore was
covered with their carcases and bones. About the month of June,
the whales proceed along the coast, going northward; and then
visit the various bays and inlets as they pass, in pursuit of the
shoals of small fish that precede them in their migration. They
generally return towards the south about six weeks afterwards,
and at these times the whale-fishery is eagerly pursued both by
the Americans and the colonists. Bay-whaling is followed with
various success at Fremantle, Bunbury, the Vasse, Augusta, and
King George's Sound.</p>

<p>At these times swarms of sharks of enormous dimensions infest
the coast. At the Vasse, they were so numerous in 1845, that the
men in the boats became quite cowed by their audacity. Were a
whale killed in the evening, two-thirds of it would be eaten
before morning by the sharks. The monsters (sometimes thirty feet
in length) would follow the whale-boats, and strike against them
with their snouts and fins; until the men were so intimidated
that they even refused to go in pursuit of a whale which
otherwise they might easily have captured. Mr. Robert Viveash,
one of the principals at this station, told me, among other
anecdotes, that one day, standing on the deck of a small
schooner, watching the evolutions of an enormous shark, he saw it
seize the rudder with its teeth in a kind of frenzy, or else in
mere sport, and shake it so violently that the tiller, striking
against some heavy object on deck, was actually broken in two
pieces. It is a well-authenticated fact, that some years ago a
shark, playing round a whaling vessel of upwards of 300 tons,
whilst lying at anchor during a calm, got entangled in the
buoy-rope of the anchor, and in its efforts to free itself
actually tripped the anchor. The people on board, perceiving
something extraordinary had happened, hove up the anchor, and
brought the struggling shark to the surface. Having thrown a rope
over its head and secured it by a running bowline knot under the
pectoral fins, the fish was boused up to the fore-yard; and its
length was so great, that when its nose touched the yard, its
tail was still lashing the water.</p>

<p>There is something highly exciting in the chase of the whale.
I have watched the proceedings for hours from Arthur's Head, the
high rock between Fremantle and the sea. A man stationed here on
the look out, perceives a whale spouting about six miles off,
between the main-land and the opposite islands. He immediately
hoists a flag, and makes signals indicating the direction.</p>

<p>The crews of six whale-boats, which have been lying ready on
the beach, with their lines carefully coiled in a tub, and
harpoon and lances all at hand, assemble like magic. The boats
are launched, and pulling rapidly out of the bay, each with its
own particular flag flying at the bows; the steersman leans
forward, and gives additional force to the stroke-oar by the
assistance of his weight and strength; the men pull strongly and
well-together; the boats dance over the flashing waves, and
silence and determination reign among the crews. The object is to
meet the whale, and come down upon him in front; none but a
lubber or a knave would cross his wake; for his eyes are so
placed that he can see laterally and behind better than straight
before him, and the moment he detects a boat in pursuit he begins
to run. The lubber crosses his wake, because he has not steered
so as to be able to avoid doing so; the knave, because either out
of spite to his employer, or because he is bribed by an adverse
company, is desirous that the fish should be lost. If the boats
are a long distance astern when the whale begins to run, pursuit
is useless, and the men return, hoping for better luck another
time.</p>

<p>The boats come round Arthur's Head almost together. The men,
knowing that many hours of severe toil are probably before them,
pull steadily, but not so as to exhaust themselves at the outset.
At length one boat creeps out from the rest; the others gradually
drop into line, and the distance between each widens perceptibly.
The last boat, a heavy sailer, is half-a-mile astern of the
first. From the boats, your eye wanders to the spot where the
whale was last seen to blow. For some time you can discern
nothing, and fancy he must be gone off to sea again. At last a
thin white column of vapour is perceptible; the animal is
carelessly sporting about, unconscious of danger. The first boat
draws rapidly down upon him; it approaches nearer and nearer. The
fish has disappeared, but his enemies seem to know the direction
in which he is going, and are ready awaiting him when he returns
to the surface. You now perceive him blowing close to the first
boat, the steersman of which draws in the steer-oar and runs
forward, whilst the men have all peaked their oars, and remain
quiet in their seats. The steersman has seized the harpoon to
which the long line of coiled rope is attached; in a moment he
has plunged it into the animal's side. Starting at the stroke,
away it darts; the line flies out of the tub over the bow of the
boat; the men begin to pull, in order to ease the shock when the
line is all run out; and now away they go, the whale drawing the
boat after him at such speed that the water flies off from the
bows in broad flakes.</p>

<p>After running upwards of a mile, the fish dives down to the
bottom; there he remains some minutes, until compelled to return
to the surface for breath. His reappearance is heralded by a
column of water spouted from his nostrils.</p>

<p>Two of the boats are able to approach near enough to allow
lances to be thrown at him, which, penetrating through the
blubber, pierce his vitals, and cause him to run again as swiftly
as before. Again he sinks, and again appears on the surface; the
column which he now spouts forth is tinged with red. The boats
again approach, the more lances are driven into his sides, but he
is not yet subdued; he breaks away from the assassins, and tries
once more to escape; but, alas! his strength and his life-blood
are fast ebbing away; his breath begins to fail, and he cannot
remain long beneath the surface.</p>

<p>He comes up suddenly in the very midst of the boats, and, as
he rolls from side to side, he strikes one of them with his fin,
staving it in and making it a wreck upon the water. The drowning
men are picked up by their companions, and the whale is again
pursued. He is now in the death-flurry, spinning round and round,
and lashing the sea into foam with his broad tail. He is still;
and now the boats venture to come close up to the carcase, and
fixing grapnels in it, with tow-lines attached, they form in a
line, and commence towing their conquest to the shore, singing as
they row, their measured paeans of victory.</p>

<p>When the blubber is cut off and tryed out, it produces from
three to ten tons of oil.</p>

<p>Besides whales, there are immense quantities of fish upon this
coast. The best kind are called tailors, and have a good deal of
the mackerel flavour; and snappers, which somewhat resemble
cod-fish. The mullets and whitings are better than those on the
English coast, but every other fish is much inferior in flavour
to those known in England. We have nothing to equal salmon,
turbot, soles, cod, or mackerel; nevertheless, a snapper of
twenty pounds weight is a very eatable fish.</p>

<p>They are caught in great quantities, salted and exported to
the Mauritius, where they are acknowledged to be superior to the
fish imported from the Cape of Good Hope. Snapper-fishing is not
bad sport, as they bite freely. They go in immense shoals, and it
is not an uncommon thing to catch twenty-hundred weight at a
single haul. When H.M.S. Challenger was lying in Cockburn Sound,
some of the men with a very large seine-net, caught two thousand
fish at a single haul--averaging five pounds a-piece. This is
almost incredible, but it is related on good authority.</p>

<p>The fresh-water rivers have no fish but a small craw-fish,
that buries itself in the ground when the bed of the stream is
dry; and a flat-headed, tapering fish called a cobbler. This is
about twelve inches long, and has a sharp, serrated bone an inch
in length on each side of its head, that lies flat and perfectly
concealed until an enemy approaches. This bone is hollow, like an
adder's tooth, and contains a virulent poison, which is injected
into the wound, and causes intense pain for several hours. Men
are frequently stung by these wretches, whilst wading through the
water.</p>

<p>There are several valuable kinds of wood in this colony, which
do not exist in South Australia or New South Wales. We may
mention the sandalwood, which now finds a market in Ceylon, where
it fetches about 22 pounds per ton; but if it were sent direct to
China, (its ultimate destination,) it would obtain probably 35
pounds per ton. Sandal-wood is burnt in large quantities in
China, as a kind of incense. There is another highly-fragrant
wood peculiar to this colony, called by the settlers raspberry
jam, from its resembling that sweet-meat in its scent. A small
quantity sent to Tonbridge-Wells, was worked up into boxes, and
highly approved of by the cabinet-makers, who gave it the name of
violet wood.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful trees in the colony is called the
peppermint-tree; its leaves, which are very abundant, resemble
those of the willow, and, on being rubbed, smell strongly of
peppermint. It bears a small yellow flower. These is much reason
to believe that this is of the same species as the tree which
yields the valuable Cajeput oil, and it is highly desirable that
an endeavour should be made to distil this oil from the
leaves.</p>

<p>Many of the vegetable productions of Western Australia appear
to correspond with those of Java and others of the Eastern
Islands, modified by the difference of climate.</p>

<p>The timber adapted to ship-building purposes, extends in vast
quantities down the line of coast, and is of three kinds, all
varieties of the eucalyptus. The tooart in the districts of
Bunbury and the Vasse, and the blue-gum which abounds at Augusta
and Nornalup, are woods of large size, and remarkably hard and
close-grained in texture. It is well adapted for keel-pieces,
stern-posts, capstan-heads, and heavy beams: and its fibres are
so closely matted and interwoven together, that it is scarcely
possible to split it. It grows in lengths of from 30 to 60 feet,
and measures from 15 to 30 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>But the wood most highly prized and most easily attainable is
the Jarra, which grows upon the entire range of the Darling
Hills, distant from sixteen to twenty miles from the coast, and
extends over a country averaging at least twenty miles in
breadth. It was for a long time erroneously called mahogany by
the settlers, as it takes an excellent polish, and is extremely
useful for cabinet purposes. A small quantity recently sent to
England for the purpose of being worked up with furniture, has
been thus reported upon:--</p>

<p>"We have just inspected about two tons of wood brought to this
town (Leeds) under the name of Swan River Mahogany. Some of the
wood is firm and close in texture, with a very great abundance of
cross mottle;--in fact, it is quite crowded with figure. The
colour is something like old Jamaica mahogany, and it bears a
strong resemblance in some of its figures to the wood so
celebrated by Messrs. Collard as Ocean Wood. We are quite firm in
our opinion, that it is NOT mahogany, and do not know why it
should be nicknamed. Why not call it by its proper name?--for it
has sufficiently strong claims to maintain its own
independence.</p>

<p>"J. Kendell and Co. "Cabinet Manufacturers, Leeds."</p>

<p>Mr. Bond, of the firm of Gillows and Co., cabinet
manufacturers, 176 and 177 Oxford-street, London, to whom a small
quantity was submitted, has also made an equally favourable
report. Messrs. Chaloner and Fleming, of Liverpool, whose firm is
one of the most extensive importers of timber in the empire, have
reported that they "consider the specimens submitted to them to
be of rich figure, and very fine quality, although the colour is
rather dark. It is quite as fine in texture as the best Spanish
mahogany, and takes the polish remarkably well."</p>

<p>It is not, however, as cabinet wood that the Jarra is so
highly valuable. It has been found to be some of the best
ship-timber in the world. It is so extremely durable, that when
it is cut in a healthy state, it is never found to rot, even
though it be buried in the ground for years. For seventeen years
it has been constantly used in the colony for a variety of
purposes. As it resists the white-ant, an insect that destroys
oak and every other kind of wood, and is never subject to the
dry-rot, it is invaluable for building purposes. Boats
constructed of it, which have been in the water during the whole
of this period, and entirely unprotected by paint, are still as
sound as they were when first launched.</p>

<p>It resists the sea-worm; and our colonial vessels, when hove
down for repairs or survey at Sincapore, Launceston, or other
ports, have always excited the admiration of the surveyors, and
have been pronounced not to require to be coppered. This wood is
long in the grain, but very close and tough, and not only makes
very good planking, but excellent beams, keel-pieces, and many
other portions of a ship. Growing without a branch to the height
of from fifty to one hundred feet, and from eighteen inches to
three feet and upwards in diameter, it excites the admiration of
all practical men; and as its properties have been so long
tested, and are so generally admitted in the southern hemisphere,
it is matter of no less surprise than regret that it should be
still unknown in the English markets. Strong prejudice, and the
interest of parties connected with the timber-trade in other
countries, have served to keep the inexhaustible forests of
Western Australia in the obscurity which has hung over them from
primeval times. Besides this, although the Jarra wood exists not
in other parts of Australia, and is confined to the Western coast
alone, timber has been imported to England from New South Wales,
and is very little prized there. Timber-merchants, therefore, who
confound all the Australian colonies together, as most other
people in England do, are willing to believe that the Jarra of
Western Australia is the same as the Stringy-bark of New South
Wales, and therefore worth little or nothing for ship-building
purposes. The experience of seventeen years has proved the
contrary. Not only have the valuable qualities of the Jarra been
tested in vessels built in the colony, and employed in trading to
the neighbouring ports; but men-of-war and merchant ships have
been frequently repaired with it, and the wood so employed has
always been highly esteemed when subsequently inspected
abroad.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1845, the Halifax Packet, a barque of 400
tons, having parted from her anchor in a gale, and drifted
ashore, underwent repairs at Fremantle, to the extent of about
eleven hundred pounds. On being surveyed at the Port of London on
her return home, the new timber, which had never been previously
recognized at Lloyd's, though many efforts have been made to
obtain that sanction, was allowed to remain in the ship as being
perfectly serviceable. The following memorandum was addressed by
the Surveyor of Lloyd's to A. Andrews, Esq., a gentleman
interested in the welfare of the colony:</p>

<p>"The wood used in the repairs of the Halifax Packet at Swan
River, appears to answer the purpose very well. It is not found
necessary to remove any part thereof.</p>

<p>"From the samples which I have seen of Swan River timber, I am
of opinion that it will form a very desirable and serviceable
wood in ship-building; but this must be regarded as my private
opinion, the Society of Lloyd's Register, to which I belong, not
having as yet assigned any character to it in their rules.</p>

<p>(Signed) "P. Courtney, Lloyd's Surveyor. "Lloyd's, 24th
February, 1846."</p>

<p>This extraordinary timber grows to a size that would appear
incredible to readers in England. It is perhaps only manageable
and remunerative from 40 to 60 feet; but in the southern
districts of the colony--especially to the back of Nornalup and
Wilson's Inlet--it is found growing to 120 and 150 feet in
height, before the first branch appears. My brother and his
servant, when exploring in that district, took refuge once from a
storm in the hollow of an old Jarra tree, which not only
sheltered themselves but their horses; and the interior actually
measured in diameter three times the length of the largest horse,
an animal sixteen hands high and very long backed. This may
appear an astounding assertion, but the following is not less so.
The same parties found a Jarra tree which had fallen completely
across a broad and deep river (called the Deep River) running
between high precipitous banks, thus forming a natural bridge,
along which a bullock cart might have passed!</p>

<p>Timber of such large dimensions is perfectly useless; but
there are, of course, trees of every size, growing in boundless
profusion.</p>

<p>As Indian teak and African oak are now scarcely obtainable, we
look upon our colony as a store-house for the British navy; and
though we have hitherto vainly battled against prejudice and
private interest to make this timber known to our rulers, the day
will arrive when the wants of the naval service will compel men
in authority to acknowledge the value of wood, which is most
highly prized by all who have had the opportunity of testing its
qualities.</p>

<p>It is due to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to
state, that on two occasions they have promised to receive a
quantity of this timber, provided it were delivered at one of the
royal dockyards, and to allow a fair price for it. But
unfortunately, there is so great a scarcity of labour and of
capital in the colony, that the settlers have shrunk from the
outlay necessary to perform what would be, after all, only an
experiment.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed, that timber which has been tested in
every way for seventeen years, and is known throughout Australia
to be indisputably FIRST-RATE for ship-building purposes, should
be condemned at home as unserviceable. But the colonists know how
many prejudices and interested feelings environ the Admiralty;
and in general shrink from the experiment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 31.</h3>

<h4>RISE AND FALL OF A SETTLEMENT.--THE SEQUEL TO CAPTAIN GREY'S
DISCOVERIES.--A WORD AT PARTING.</h4>

<p>His Excellency the Governor having kindly invited me to be his
companion on a journey which he proposed to make to the new
settlement of Australind, about a hundred miles south of Perth, I
set about making the necessary preparations. I borrowed a pair of
saddle-bags, and having stuffed my traps into one side of them,
loaded the other with a cold roast fowl, a boiled tongue, a pound
of sausages, a loaf of bread, a flask of brandy, and sundry small
packages of tea, sugar, cigars, etc.</p>

<p>When I looked at the result of my labours, the swollen sides
of the leathern receptacle, I enjoyed a noble feeling of
independence; as though I were now prepared to ramble through the
world, and stood in no need of friendly welcome, or the doubtful
hospitality of an inn.</p>

<p>Having breakfasted at five o'clock on a December morning (the
middle of summer), and equipped myself in a broad-brimmed
straw-hat and light shooting jacket, I mounted my steed, and
sallied forth from my gate, followed by the sympathizing grins of
Hannibal.</p>

<p>His Excellency, true to the hour, was mounting his horse at
the door of Government House--and as the appearance of the whole
turn-out was rather unlike anything usually seen in Hyde Park, or
even connected with the morning drives of his Excellency the
Viceroy of Ireland, I may as well describe it.</p>

<p>The representative of our gracious Sovereign was habited in
his bush costume--a white hat, bare of beaver, having a green
veil twisted round it, a light shooting coat and plaid trousers,
shoes, and jean gaiters. His illustrious person was seated on a
pair of broad saddle-bags, which went flap, flap against the
sides of his charger, as he jogged steadily along at the usual
travelling pace. On the pummel of his saddle was strapped a roll
of blankets for the night bivouac, and to one of the straps was
attached a tin-pannikin, which bumped incessantly against his
horse's mane. Round the animal's neck was coiled a long
tether-rope, which every now and then kept coming undone, and the
caravan had to halt whilst it was being readjusted.</p>

<p>Behind us rode his Excellency's man, no longer the smug
gentleman in a black suit, with a visage as prim as his
neck-cloth, but blazing in a red woollen shirt, and grinning
incessantly with amazement at his own metamorphosis. Strapped to
his waist by a broad belt of leather, was a large tin-kettle, for
the purpose of making his Excellency's tea in the evening. Huge
saddle-bags contained provisions, knives and forks, plates, and
everything necessary for travelling in the Bush in a style of
princely magnificence. No scheik or emir among the Arabs wanders
about the desert half so sumptuously provided. I could not help
laughing (in my sleeve, of course,) at the figure produced by the
tout ensemble of John mounted on his ewe-necked and pot-bellied
steed.</p>

<p>In excellent spirits we jogged along to the Canning, and then
eleven miles farther, to a muddy pool called Boregarup, where we
baited the horses, and lunched on one of his Excellency's cold
meat-pies. The water in the pool was not very tempting, but we
ladled a little out in our pannikins, and mixing it with brandy,
managed to drink it. The want of water makes travelling in the
bush during summer a serious business. Frequently you find a
well, on which your thoughts and hopes have been fixed for the
last twenty miles, completely dried up; and you have to endure
thirst as well as you can for some hours longer. Sometimes by
scraping the bottom of the well, and digging down with your
pannikin, you come to a little moisture, and after waiting an
hour, succeed in obtaining about half-a-pint of yellow fluid,
compounded of mud and water. This you strain through as many
pocket-handkerchiefs as you can command, and are at last enabled
to moisten your baked lips.</p>

<p>On these occasions the traveller cares less about himself than
his horse, and often have we served the latter out of our
pannikin from holes into which he could not get his nose, whilst
denying ourselves more than a little sip.</p>

<p>After lying an hour on our blankets in the hot shade, smoking
a cigar, and waging incessant war with myriads of mosquitoes and
sand-flies, we decided that it was impossible to continue any
longer so unequal a conflict; and saddling our horses in haste,
we beat a quick retreat, and felt much cooler and more
comfortable whilst in motion. In the course of the afternoon we
passed through a vast dry swamp many miles long. The reeds on
each side of the track frequently reached to our heads, and
prevented our seeing any thing else on either side of us; and
when we did get a glimpse over the rushes level with our eyes, we
could behold nothing but an immense plain of waving green, like a
huge field of unripe wheat, edged in the distance by the stern
outline of the ever-sombre forest of eucalyptus trees. This swamp
is a terrible place to pass through in winter. It is nevertheless
one of the royal post-roads of the colony; and the bearer of her
Majesty's mail from Pinjarra to Perth, is frequently obliged to
swim for his life, with the letter-bag towing astern, like a
jolly-boat behind a Newcastle collier.</p>

<p>After emerging from the swamp, we passed through an extensive
plain, covered with coarse scrub and thinly-scattered grass, and
lined with forest trees and clumps of black-boys. When about
half-way down it, we came upon a herd of wild cattle grazing at
some two hundred yards' distance from the path. They seemed very
much astonished at the appearance of three such picturesque
individuals; and after gazing for a few moments, lost in wonder,
they tossed up their heads, and trotted along-side of us, keeping
their original distance. Having kept us company for about
half-a-mile, they relieved us of their society, (which was not
very agreeable, as we had no firearms) by coming to a halt, and
allowing us to proceed in peace, whilst they contented themselves
with brandishing their horns and tails, and butting against one
another in play.</p>

<p>That night we slept at the Dandalup, hospitably entertained by
F. Corbet Singleton, Esq., M.C., the owner of a fine estate of
twelve thousand acres, a good deal of it alluvial soil. Were the
population such as it ought to be in this fine country; and the
markets proportioned to the capabilities of the soil, nothing
would be more agreeable than to live on a beautiful property like
this, cultivating your corn lands and multiplying your flocks and
herds. But as it is, unfortunately, a man is soon overdone with
his own wealth. He has more corn than he can find a market for;
more cattle than he can sell; and he is obliged to allow his land
to run waste, and his herds to run wild, rather than be at the
expense of farming on a great scale without adequate
remuneration.</p>

<p>Let me advise emigrants to these colonies to turn their
attention chiefly to the breeding of sheep and horses, which are
saleable things in foreign markets. The growers of wool, and the
breeders of horses for India will make their estates profitable;
but large herds of cattle will produce nothing to the owner in a
thinly-populated country.</p>

<p>The next day, after inspecting the farm, we proceeded with our
host to Mandurah, crossing an estuary a quarter of a mile broad,
but so shallow that the water did not reach above our
saddle-flaps. And now (having parted from Singleton) we had to
swim our horses across the mouth of the Murray River. After a
little delay, a boat was found; with a couple of men to row it
across, and removing the saddles and other things from the
horses' backs, we prepared for the passage. His Excellency's Arab
mare was destined to make the experimental trip, and the
Governor, with many injunctions and misgivings, committed the end
of the tether-rope to the hand of his servant, who belayed it to
the stern of the boat, where he seated himself, to act as
occasion should require. The boatman rowed till the tether-rope
was out at full stretch; his Excellency coaxed and entreated the
mare to enter the water, and "shoo-ed!" and "shaa-ed!" and called
her a stupid creature, whilst I cracked my whip and jumped about,
and rattled my hat, and made as much noise as people usually do
on such occasions. The mare, on her part, reared up, and flung
herself back, and plunged about, and showed so strong a
determination not to go down the broken bank, that we feared we
should never get her into the river. At last, however, we managed
to back her into the water, when she was dragged instantly out of
her depth and obliged to swim. The men pulled so fast that she
could not keep up with them, and giving up the attempt, floated
quietly on her side, to the great horror of her master, who
thought he never should bestride her again, until he was relieved
by seeing her start to her feet in shallow water, and scramble up
the bank, dripping like a veritable hippopotamus.</p>

<p>The other horses behaved better; and when we had ourselves
crossed and remounted, we rode by the side of the river, or
rather estuary, a distance of ten miles, till we came to a
picturesque little spot called Mocha weir--a high bank, a clump
of trees, a brawling brook, (unusual sight in this country,) and
a patch of excellent grass.</p>

<p>Here we resolved to halt for the night. Each rider attended to
his own horse, which, however, did not get much grooming, and
then we prepared for the great business of life, and kindled a
fire, filled the kettle with limpid water, drew out our various
stocks of provisions, and arranged the dinner-table on the grass,
and made every thing look exceedingly comfortable and inviting.
Then we made tea, and invited each other to eat, and did eat
without invitation; and joked and laughed, and felt considerably
more happy and sociable than if vice-royalty had been
real-royalty, and the green canopy of the trees were the
banqueting-hall at Windsor Castle. The man munched his victuals
at a small private bivouac of his own, within easy call, as he
had to jump up every now and then, and bring the kettle, or wash
the plates for the second and third courses. When the things were
removed, we lighted cigars, and pleasantly discoursed, recumbent
before the fire. Our beds were already made of black-boy tops,
and, therefore we had nothing to do but await the hour of rest.
The sun had disappeared, and darkness, closing around us, drew
nigher and more nigh every moment, swallowing up object after
object in its stealthy advance, and seeming about to overwhelm us
in its mysterious obscurity. But John heaped logs of dry wood
upon the fire, and nobly we resisted all the powers of Darkness.
In the midst of that black solitude, our little circle of light
maintained its independence, nor yielded to the invasion which
had swallowed up all around it. Here was our Camp of Refuge, and
here we felt snug, and secure, and at home; whilst all without
our magic circle was comfortless and desolate.</p>

<p>Sometimes the active-minded John would dive, without apparent
dismay, into the black and hostile-looking regions of Night,
which seemed to close upon him as though for ever; and when we
had resignedly given him up, a prey to the evil spirits that
prowled around, he would reappear with startling suddenness,
issuing forth into the light like some red demon of the woods,
and bearing a huge log upon his shoulder --the spoils of his
"foray-sack"--which he would fling down upon the fire, making it
blaze up with sudden fierceness, and extending the circle of
light for a few moments to a greater distance around, so as to
give us a transient glimpse of things which were soon swallowed
up again in darkness--like glimpses of the dead in dreams.</p>

<p>I must hurry on to Australind, merely mentioning that we
passed two lakes not far from each other, one of which was fresh,
and the other salt--salt as the Dead Sea. It is usual in this
perverse country (though not so in this instance) to find a salt
lake surrounded with good, and a fresh-water lake with bad land.
Here it was bad altogether. The country, however, improved
greatly as we drew towards Australind; and about ten miles from
that place, we came upon a fine flock of sheep that seemed to be
doing extremely well.</p>

<p>We now passed along the banks of the Leschenault estuary, on
which Australind is situated; and soon we discovered three
figures approaching on horseback. these proved to be M. Waller
Clifton, Esq., the chief Commissioner of the Western Australian
Company, to whom the whole district belongs, attended by a brace
of his surveyors as aides-de-camp--one mounted on a very tall
horse, and the other on a very small pony. The Chief Commissioner
himself bestrode a meek-looking cart-horse, which, on perceiving
us in the distance, he urged into an exhilarating trot. His
Excellency, seeing these demonstrations of an imposing reception,
hastily drew forth his black silk neck-cloth from his pocket, and
re-enveloped his throat therewith, which, during the heat of the
day, he had allowed to be carelessly exposed. Gathering himself
up in his saddle, and assuming the gravity proper to the
representative of his sovereign, he awaited with as much dignity
as his state of perspiration would allow, the approach of the
Chief of Australind. As for myself, I plucked up my shirt-collar,
and tried to look as spicy as possible.</p>

<p>The first greetings over, the two chieftains rode into the
town side by side, as amicably as Napoleon and Alexander of
Russia; whilst I fell to the share of the aides, and related the
most recent news of Perth, and the last bon mots of Richard Nash,
for their entertainment; receiving in return an account of the
arrival of 400 male and female emigrants at the settlement the
day before.</p>

<p>We were entertained, as every guest invariably is, right
hospitably by Mr. Clifton and his amiable family.</p>

<p>Australind was then (December 1842) a promising new town. It
was alive with well-dressed young men and women, who were
promenading under the large forest trees which still occupied the
intended squares and most of the streets. They had only landed
from the vessel which had brought them some twenty-four hours
before, and they were evidently variously affected by all they
saw. Some appeared to be struck with the strange circumstance of
trees growing in the streets; some looked aghast at the wooden
houses and canvass tents; one thought everything looked
exceedingly green; another fancied that a town built upon sand
could not possibly endure long. And he was right: for the town
has long since been deserted, except by half a dozen families;
and the newly arrived settlers are dispersed over the colony.
This has not been the fault of the Chief Commissioner, nor is it
owing to any inferiority in the soil, but to causes which I
intend briefly to explain, as there are many people in England
who are, or were, interested in the fortunes of this promising
young settlement.</p>

<p>The Western Australian Company's grant of land at Australind
comprises 100,000 acres, among which there is a large quantity of
excellent pasture and arable land. It is well watered, and
generally well adapted for the site of a new settlement. The
flats of the Brunswick and Collic rivers would supply the whole
colony, if thoroughly peopled, with grain; and there is abundance
of feed for sheep and cattle, even to the summits of the
hills.</p>

<p>A great portion of this grant has been purchased by the
Company from Colonel Lautour, who, however, could not furnish a
good title to it. Having never performed the necessary
improvements which would entitle him to a deed of grant in
fee-simple from the crown, his right of possession became
forfeit; and in April, 1840, Governor Hutt, though much
interested in the success of the Company, of which his brother,
the member for Gateshead, was chairman, thought himself obliged,
in the conscientious discharge of his duty, to resume the estate
for the crown.</p>

<p>This proved to be a most fatal proceeding. The Company's title
to Colonel Lautour's grant had been confirmed by the
Home-government in November 1839, but owing to the non-existence
of regular post-office communication (that grand and inexcusable
error, which allows the British Empire to be composed of a mass
of unconnected settlements, dependent upon chance for
intelligence and aid from the mother country), the news did not
reach the colony until May or June following.</p>

<p>Accounts of the resumption of the grant by the Governor
reached England, and not only perplexed the Company, but greatly
disquieted the minds of the numerous individuals to whom they had
sold land, to the value of nearly 60,000 pounds. At this very
time, too, unhappily, arrived Captain Grey in England, on his
return from the expedition to the north-western side of New
Holland, of which he has since published a clever and popular
narrative. Captain Grey took an early opportunity of giving a
somewhat lamentable account of the Company's land at Leschenault,
or Australind, and a very glowing description of a district, many
miles to the north of Perth, between Gantheaume Bay and the
Arrowsmith River, which he had passed through on his disastrous
return. He also expatiated, in most precise terms, upon a
splendid harbour which he called Port Grey, and of which he made
an elaborate sketch; and on the 26th of October, 1840, addressed
to Lord John Russell "a detailed description of that portion of
the western coast of Australia which lies between Gantheaume Bay
and the River Arrowsmith, as it would be found useful in enabling
persons, intending to occupy that tract of country, to arrive at
correct conclusions regarding its capabilities." In the map of
his route, published by Arrowsmith, Port Grey is laid down as a
spacious, well-sheltered harbour, with a convenient point of land
extending a couple of miles out to sea from its northern
extremity, and having a useful reef of rocks projecting, most
happily, to the same distance, affording altogether a secure
shelter for shipping in seven fathoms' water.</p>

<p>The Directors of the Western Australian Company, alarmed at
the account related of Australind, perplexed by the proceedings
of the local Government, and captivated by the description of
Port Grey, with its splendid districts of "rich flats," and
"fertile downs," determined to change the site of their
settlement.</p>

<p>Captain Grey describes two "flat-topped ranges," in the
neighbourhood of this port, lying about twenty miles apart; and
in his diary of "Sunday, April 7, 1839," he says: "The country
between these two ranges was an open grassy valley thinly wooded;
and IT APPEARED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVELY FERTILE
portions of country which I had yet seen in Australia. After
travelling for another mile over the sandy downs, we reached
another romantic glen-like valley, bounded to the north and south
by steep limestone cliffs; we descended these cliffs, and at
their base found as in the last valley we had crossed, EXTENSIVE
FLATS, through which wound a water-course. All the hills I could
see in the vicinity consisted of limestone, and for the whole
distance I could see to the eastward (about seven or eight miles)
the country appeared to be of the MOST FERTILE and picturesque
character; the hills were slightly wooded with large timber, and
the valleys were nearly bare of trees and COVERED WITH GRASS. On
ascending the limestone hills to the south of the valley, we
found ourselves once more in open sandy downs; after travelling
three miles across these in a S. by E. direction, we again came
to a valley of the same character as the one above described; it
ran from the same direction; to the eastward we saw a fertile
valley. * * * We halted for some time immediately at the foot of
Mount Fairfax.</p>

<p>"We continued our route in the evening over the sandy downs,
which, at the distance of half a mile from the sea, terminated in
cliffs. * * * After travelling three miles, we halted for the
night.</p>

<p>"Monday 8th. The first three miles of our route lay over sandy
downs, when we found ourselves in grassy, wooded plains, lying
between the flat-topped range, and some dunes which bordered a
bay," etc.</p>

<p>It is well known that people in the latter stages of
starvation have constantly visions before their eyes of sumptuous
entertainments, rich meats, and delicious wines. Captain Grey,
who was then walking for his life, at a Barclay pace, with a very
empty stomach, was probably labouring under a similar
hallucination with respect to the country over which he passed;
beholding flowery meads and fertile vales in districts which we
fear would prove little attractive to a settler. He beheld fine
flowing rivers and sheltered bays, which have since altogether
disappeared, like the scenes beheld on misty mornings by Sicilian
mariners.</p>

<p>His account of the country determined the Western Australian
Company to change the site of their intended settlement. Calling
together the purchasers of land at Australind, the Directors
offered to return them the amount of their respective purchases,
or allow them to take up new allotments in the very superior
district of Port Grey. Almost all chose to reclaim their cash,
and declined further speculation.</p>

<p>The Company now, towards the close of 1840, sent out Mr.
Clifton, their "Chief Commissioner," with directions to remove
the whole of their establishment then settled at Australind, to
the new settlement of Port Grey. On arriving at Australind, Mr.
Clifton was agreeably surprised to find the country much superior
to what he had expected, after hearing Captain Grey's account of
it. So differently do the same objects appear to different eyes!
And perhaps Captain Grey had only viewed the sandy banks of the
inlet, without having passed into the interior, and seen the
flats of the Brunswick, etc. There is a very great deal more of
worthless than of good land at Australind, which is the case
throughout the whole of New Holland, in the very best districts.
The general character throughout all the settled parts of the
island, or continent, is bad, with scattered patches of good.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner, however, prepared to carry out his
instructions, though with much regret, as he doubted greatly
whether the proposed alteration would prove for the better. These
preparations were put a stop to by a communication from his
Excellency the Governor, informing him that the Government
schooner had recently returned from a survey of the coast and
district of the so-called Port Grey, and that no sufficient
harbour could be discovered along the coast; whilst the country
in every direction appeared barren and incapable of cultivation.
Mr. Clifton therefore remained at Australind with his party, and
used every effort and exerted every energy to found a flourishing
colony. But unfortunately, the change of site to Port Grey, and
then the return to Australind, and the various conflicting
accounts promulgated by the Company themselves, now lauding and
now condemning the two places in turn, operated so unfavourably
upon the public mind that no more sales of land could be
effected. It became, therefore, inexpedient to maintain the
expensive establishment of Commissioners, Secretaries, and
Surveyors at Australind, who were accordingly conge'd without
much ceremony; and the Western Australian Company, like the
"unsubstantial pageant," or Port Grey itself, "melted into air,
thin air," leaving "not a rack behind." Yet not exactly so, for
it has left behind, like some stranded wreck by the receding
tide, a most worthy and high-minded family who deserved a
brighter fate.</p>

<p>Such has been the lamentable result of Captain Grey's
discoveries in Western Australia; for whether there be or not a
good tract of land in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, Captain
Grey's denunciation of Australind, and his strongly urged advice
to the Company to change the site of their settlement, have
undoubtedly been the chief causes of their failure.</p>

<p>Three expeditions have been sent to the scene of this
Australian Fata Morgana, in the hope of beholding it again, but
like the door of the fairy palace in the rock, it is visible only
to Prince Ahmed; and unless the Governor of New Zealand will
himself found a colony there, it is most likely ever to remain
desert and valueless. The first expedition was that in the
Government schooner, in 1840, already alluded to; the second was
made in 1841, by H.M.S. Beagle, Captain Stokes, accompanied by
the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Clifton. A careful survey was made of
the coast as far north as the spot were Captain Grey was wrecked,
and began his march southward, but nothing was discovered at all
resembling the description given of Port Grey. The only bay in
which a ship could lie, and that with very doubtful security, was
Champion Bay; but unfortunately the country in every direction
from this spot is most barren and miserable. Captain Grey
travelled close along the coast-line, according to his journal,
but those who have gone in search of his "fertile valleys" have
penetrated some distance into the interior, without discovering
anything but scrub and desert.</p>

<p>Captain Stokes, in his published "Letter to the Surveyor
General of Western Australia," detailing his proceedings,
mentions having "now seen and examined an extent of country
little short of forty miles, nearly the whole of which deserved
the character of sterility." In another place, he related the
discovery of "the only piece of grass of a useful nature seen in
this route; it was, however, quite parched, and occupied a space
of three or four acres."</p>

<p>Not being able to find any tolerable shelter along the coast
besides Champion Bay, he concludes that it must be the spot
designated as Port Grey; and after exploring the country behind
it, with the effect just stated, he sailed away one morning
towards the north-west and meeting with a "favourable westerly
wind," by afternoon was carried "past the bight south of Point
Moore, sufficiently near to see that its shores were fronted with
many sunken rocks." This also led to the conclusion that
"Champion Bay is the port Captain Grey speaks of in his journal,
placed in Arrowsmith's chart twelve miles south of its true
position."</p>

<p>Since the date of Captain Stokes's survey, Captain Grey has
himself virtually admitted Champion Bay to be the locality
visited by him. In a letter to that officer dated, "Government
House, Adelaide, January 28, 1842," and published in the South
Australian journals, Captain Grey observes, "I have attentively
read your letter to the Hon. the Surveyor-General of Western
Australia; and have also considered the observations made by you
to me, relative to the error you suppose I have fallen into in
mistaking the Wizard Peak of Captain King for the hill named by
him Mount Fairfax, and I find I have certainly fallen into this
error--a by no means unlikely one, considering the very similar
character of the singular group of hills called Moresby's
Flat-topped Range, and the circumstances under which I was
journeying."</p>

<p>The hill, therefore, at whose foot Captain Grey halted on the
afternoon of April 7, 1839, was not Mount Fairfax, but the Wizard
Peak, or some other hill "to the north of Mount Fairfax." From
thence the "sandy downs," (mentioned in the extract from his
Journal that I have given above) over which he passed in the
evening continued to within "half a mile of the sea," where "they
terminated in cliffs." To have seen all this he must have been
walking at no very great distance from the shore during that
day's marsh. His object was to reach Perth as quickly as
possible; and he steered in the most direct course--"south by
east." We know, therefore, exactly the line of country traversed
by Captain Grey--the "singular group called Moresby's Flat-topped
Range" being unmistakeable.</p>

<p>In December, 1844, H. M. colonial schooner, Champion, under
the command of Lieutenant Helpman, R.N., accompanied by Mr. J.
Harrison, Civil Engineer, etc., was again despatched by Governor
Hutt to make further observations in the neighbourhood of
Gantheaume Bay. Lieutenant Helpman says in his report, "I coasted
close in from Champion Bay, collecting angles and soundings until
in latitude 28 degrees 10' 30", S. the low ridges of sand along
the shore induced me to land, being then (as I concluded from the
latitude given by Captain Grey) in the immediate vicinity of the
estuary." This estuary is described by Captain Grey in his diary
of the FIFTH April, who states that "for one mile we continued
along THE RICH FLATS which bordered the estuary" ... "we ascended
the limestone range, and got a view of the country to the
eastward and found it STILL GRASSY, and exactly the same
character as far as we could see. For the next five miles we
continued along the top of the limestone range, the estuary still
occupying the valley which lay to the west of us." ... "At the
end of a mile in a south by east direction, we found ourselves on
the banks of a river, the Hutt, from forty to fifty yards wide,
which was running strong, and was brackish at its mouth," etc.
Such was the appearance of the estuary and of the Hutt River in
the eyes of Captain Grey.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Helpman continues his report as follows:--</p>

<p>"On reaching the summit of the highest coast hill I found
myself abreast of the centre of the inlet, which was void of
water, but presented the appearance of a continuous sheet of salt
as far as the eye could reach. Passing over the coast ridges, I
came down, in about half a mile, to the edge of the estuary, and
followed it in a southerly direction for about two miles, when I
ascended another hill, from which I could clearly see the south
end of it, which was covered with the same description of
incrustration of salt.</p>

<p>"A gorge at the south-east corner of the estuary is probably
where the Hutt River discharges itself during the rainy season,
but there was no appearance of water in any part of the flat,
which was about two miles wide between the hills and the
south-east shore of the inlet.</p>

<p>"Observing that the north extremity of the estuary, as seen
from the hill just referred to, presented some slight appearance
of water, I was induced to examine it, and found the sand ridges
on the coast extremely low, nearly destitute of herbage, but
giving the idea of having had water passing over them. This I
judged to be the case, from a few blades of very coarse grass
which were laid flat on the ground, as if from the effects of
running water.</p>

<p>"From the highest point of these ridges, notwithstanding the
smoke from the numerous native fires, the whole north end of the
inlet was plainly seen to be covered with salty incrustations,
similar to those previously referred to.</p>

<p>"I conceive the point of land near which these latter
observations were made, and where I landed the second time, to be
Shoal Point of the chart; but, except that it is very low, I see
no cause for its name, as the water was deep close to it, and
having only a few rocks close off its extreme west point, within
a quarter of a mile of the shore.</p>

<p>"Following close in from Shoal Point, the coast is perfectly
clear of dangers; but I observed no opening in the hills
indicative of a river, nor could I discover any bay or place of
shelter for shipping to resort to.</p>

<p>"Red Point, which is the western entrance of Gantheaume Bay,
is a very bold headland of considerable elevation, it is
circular, and about four miles in extent. I landed at the east
end of the red sand cliffs, taking a specimen of the rock.</p>

<p>"The land to the northward from this promontory is of a white
sandy appearance, having ridges of sand hills along the coast of
moderate altitude.</p>

<p>"The low state of the barometer, and the strong northerly
winds, induced me to keep the vessel at a considerable offing.
During the day the breezes were very fresh, and had it not been
for the whale-boat with which I was furnished, I should not have
been able to have effected a landing on any part of the coast
which came under my observation. Under these circumstances, I was
compelled most reluctantly to abandon the idea of spending much
time in examining the interior.</p>

<p>"The VERY DRY STATE OF THE HUTT AT THIS SEASON seems to
indicate that but little water flows into it at any time; and I
am disposed to fancy, that the lagoon, or estuary, owes its
formation to the breaking in of the sea over the low sand hills
during the tempestuous gales of the winter months, more
especially towards the north end of the inlet, where the sand
ridges are lower than in any other part of the coast in that
vicinity."</p>

<p>Thus the luxuriant country of Captain Grey, like the
water-pools seen in the mirage of the desert, when approached,
vanishes from the view of the traveller.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that Captain Stokes and Lieutenant
Helpman surveyed these districts in the early part of the summer
season-- November and December--when they were more likely to
appear fertile than on the 5th and 7th April, quite at the end of
that season, and just before the commencement of the winter
rains.</p>

<p>Since the above passages were written, I have read an account
in the Perth journals of January, 1847, of the discovery of coal
by the Messrs. Gregory, about forty miles east of Champion Bay.
These gentlemen relate, that in journeying towards the coast,
they passed through a tract of country capable of being settled.
This may possibly be Captain Grey's luxuriant district; and yet
the district which he describes was close upon the coast. It is
also stated, that there is now ascertained to be a corner of
Champion Bay in which small vessels may find a safe anchorage;
and this is conjectured to be that Port Grey whose existence has
been so long denied. But, although a few miles of country may be
found in this neighbourhood capable of supporting a limited
number of flocks and herds, it is certain that there is no such
district here as would suffice for the purposes of a colony of
the magnitude contemplated by the Western Australian Company. The
advice, therefore, given them to change the site of the
operations from Australind, or Leschenault, to Champion Bay, or
Port Grey, was the most pernicious that could have been
bestowed.</p>

<p>But it may certainly be doubted whether the principles on
which the settlement of Australind was founded were in themselves
of a sound and permanent nature. They were those propounded
originally by Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and applied with
extraordinary success to the formation and to the circumstances
of the colony of South Australia. The most prominent features
which they present are,-- the concentration of population, and
the high price of land.</p>

<p>The land in the immediate neighbourhood of Adelaide is very
fine, and capable of supporting a dense population; it was
therefore perhaps, good policy to divide it into eight-acre
sections, valued at one pound per acre, which supported a body of
agriculturalists, who found a ready and near market for their
productions in the rapidly rising town. But there are few
theories that will bear universal application; and the mistake
made in the case of Australind was, in expecting to obtain the
same result from principles which were to be applied under very
different circumstances.</p>

<p>The land adjoining the town-site of Australind is generally
very indifferent, though the flats of the Brunswick and Collie
Rivers afford perhaps some thousand acres of excellent land, but
still not sufficient to maintain a large and dense population.
The Company's property was divided into farms of 100 acres, and
these were valued at 100 pounds each to the emigrants, who drew
lots for the choice of site.</p>

<p>When the settlers arrived and took possession of their
respective grants, they soon discovered that if they all produced
wheat, there would certainly be plenty of food in the settlement,
but very little sale for it; whereas, if they intended to become
sheep-farmers, and produce wool for the English market, one
hundred acres of land would not suffice in that country for the
keep of fifty sheep. The sections of one hundred acres were,
therefore, far too small for the wants of the settler, who found
that, although he might probably be able to supply his table with
vegetables, he had but small prospect of ever applying his capers
to boiled mutton, or initiating his family into the mysteries of
beef a la mode. Disgusted with the narrowness of his prospects,
and recoiling from the idea of a vegetable diet, the sturdy
settler quickly abandoned the limited sections of Australind, and
wandered away in search of a grant of some three or four thousand
acres, on which he might reasonably hope to pasture a flock of
sheep that would return him good interest for the capital
invested.</p>

<p>The Western Australian Company gave far too much for their
land in the first instance, and were therefore compelled to set a
much higher value upon it than it would bear. The ministers of
the Crown, who have adopted the principles of Mr. Gibbon
Wakefield, require one pound per acre for waste lands; and the
Company, though they purchased their property from private
individuals at a somewhat lower rate, expected to sell it again
at the same price. There is very little land (in proportion to
the vast extent of poor and of entirely worthless land)
throughout the length and breadth of all New Holland, that is
worth twenty shillings an acre. In the more densely populated
parts, arable land is worth that sum, and often much more; but in
the pastoral districts, three shillings an acre is in truth a
high price.</p>

<p>It has long been acknowledged in New South Wales, as well as
in other parts of Australia, that it takes from three to five
acres to support a single sheep throughout the year. An ewe-sheep
is worth about nine shillings; and if you have to buy three and a
half acres of land, at three shillings, to keep her upon, the
amount of capital you invest will be nineteen shillings and
sixpence. The profits on the wool of this sheep, after paying all
expenses of keep, shearing, freight, commission, etc., will be
barely two-pence, or about one per cent upon the capital
invested. But then you have her lamb? True, but you must buy an
additional quantity of land to keep it upon. Still there is a
gain upon the increase; and in process of time the annual profits
amount up to ten and even twenty per cent. But suppose the three
and a half acres of land, instead of 10 shillings and 6 pence had
cost 3 pounds 10 shillings and 6 pence, it would then be
perfectly absurd to think of investing money in sheep.</p>

<p>The course pursued by the home Government, in fixing the
uniform extravagant price of twenty shillings an acre upon the
pastoral lands of Australia, is probably more the result of
ignorance of their real value than of a desire to check or
prevent emigration to that country. It is an ignorance, however,
that refuses to be enlightened, and has therefore all the guilt
of deliberate injury.</p>

<p>The monstrous demand of twenty shillings an acre for
crown-lands, has not only had the effect of deterring capitalists
from embarking in so hopeless a speculation, but has grievously
wronged the existing land-owners, by raising the price of labour.
When land was sold at five shillings an acre, a fund was
accumulated in the hand of the local Government that served to
pay for the introduction of labouring emigrants. That fund has
ceased to exist in New South Wales and in Western Australia. The
value of labour has therefore risen, whilst the value of
agricultural produce, by the increase of the supply beyond the
demand, has grievously diminished. The advocates of the Wakefield
system triumphantly inform us that there never can be a
labour-fund in any colony in which private individuals are able
to sell land at a cheaper rate than the Government.</p>

<p>They point to South Australia, and bid us note how different
is the state of things there, where land universally is worth a
pound an acre or more. But to us it appears, that the character
of the soil is much the same throughout these countries--if
anything, being superior in Western Australia, where there are no
droughts, and where the wool produced, though the worst got up,
from the want of labour, is stated by the London brokers to be
pre-eminent in quality--that colony would most naturally be
sought by the emigrant in which the price of land is the most
reasonable. It is not the high price of land that has caused the
prosperity of South Australia. Every one who is well informed on
the subject, is perfectly aware, that in 1841 and 1842, before
the discovery of copper-mines, South Australia was universally in
a state of bankruptcy. Never was a country so thoroughly smitten
with ruin. Almost all the original settlers sank in the general
prostration of the settlement, and never again held up their
heads. The inhabitants slunk away from the colony in numbers; and
property even in Adelaide was almost worthless. The holders of
the eighty-acre sections produced far more of the necessaries of
life than the non-producing population required; and the
neighbouring colonies were deluged with the farm-produce of the
bankrupt agriculturalists of South Australia. This model colony
afforded itself the most signal refutation of the truth of the
Wakefield theories; and the whole world would have been compelled
to acknowledge the falsehood, but for the opportune discovery of
the mineral wealth of the colony. It is to its mines that South
Australia owes its good fortune, its population, and its riches,
and not to any secret of political economy bestowed upon it by
adventurous theorists. According to the opinion of these
philosophers, New South Wales and Western Australia can never
again by any possibility possess a labour-fund, because the
private owners of large grants of land, which they obtained for
nominal sums, can always afford to undersell the Crown. So long
as the Crown refuses to sell for less than a pound an acre, this
will certainly be the case; but the day will doubtless come when
our rulers will condescend to enquire into the necessities of
those over whose fortunes they preside; and will adopt a policy
suited to the actual circumstances of the case, and not vainly
endeavour to apply, universally, abstract opinions which have
long been proved to be, in almost all parts of Australia, totally
useless and inapplicable. THE ONLY WAY TO RAISE A LABOUR-FUND IN
THESE COLONIES IS, BY OFFERING CROWN-LANDS TO THE EMIGRANT AT THE
LOWEST MARKET PRICE. The Crown could always afford to undersell
the private land-speculator, and might establish a permanent fund
for the introduction of labour, by selling land at a low rate,
AND RESERVING A RENT-CHARGE, IN THE SHAPE OF A LAND-TAX-- OF ONE
HALF-PENNY PER ACRE. Thus, every grant of five thousand acres
would pay an annual tax to Government of 10 pounds 8 shillings
and 4 pence; and would, therefore, in a very few years,
accumulate a fund sufficient to supply itself with a labouring
population. When it is remembered how very small was the original
cost to the owners of most of the lands in Western Australia,
there will not appear much hardship in imposing this tax upon all
the private property of the colony, as well as upon lands to be
hereafter sold by the Crown. This course of legislation would
infuse new vitality into the colony; and at the end of the short
period of five years, the tax might be suspended as regards all
lands purchased by individuals PRIOR TO THE PASSING OF THE ACT,
but continued for ever upon lands purchased under the Act, and in
contemplation of having to bear such a rent-charge.</p>

<p>This is the only way by which emigration can be insured to the
colonies of New South Wales and Western Australia; and the time
will sooner or later arrive when this suggestion will be adopted,
though it may not be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's present Secretary of State for the Colonies is
the first really liberal minister we have had; and to him the
distant and struggling settlements of Australia look with
reviving hope. THE OBJECTS MOST EAGERLY SOUGHT BY THOSE COLONIES
ARE--A NEW SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, WITH LESS OF COLONIAL-OFFICE
INTERFERENCE; A REGULAR POST-OFFICE COMMUNICATION WITH ENGLAND;
AND A TOTAL REFORM IN THE EXISTING REGULATIONS FOR THE SALE OF
CROWN-LANDS, WITHOUT WHICH, IN COUNTRIES PURELY PASTORAL AND
AGRICULTURAL, THERE CAN NEVER AGAIN BE FORMED A FUND FOR THE
INTRODUCTION OF LABOUR.</p>

<p>In the hope of making colonial subjects more familiar to the
general reader, and more popular than they are at present, I have
perhaps given to this little work a character so trifling as to
make it appear unworthy of the attention of political
philosophers; and yet, inasmuch as it points out some of the
wants of a large body of British subjects, whose fortunes lie
entirely at the mercy of distant rulers, who have but little
sympathy with a condition of which they possess but a most
imperfect knowledge--it is a work (inadequate though it be) not
altogether undeserving of the consideration even of
Statesmen.</p>

<h4>NOTE TO CHAPTER 30.</h4>

<p>I am happy that this work will become the medium of informing
the Colonists of Western Australia of one of the most promising
events that has ever happened to that country.</p>

<p>The ship-timber of the Colony, a trial cargo of which arrived
in England this month (October, 1847), has just been admitted
into the Royal Navy. A highly favourable report has been made
upon it by the Government surveyors, and it is pronounced
admirably adapted for kelsons, stern-posts, great beams for
steam-frigates, and other heavy work. If a company be formed, on
good principles, and under proper management, a timber trade for
the supply of the Navy will be found most lucrative.</p>

<p>The principal portion of the labour should be performed by
Chinamen, to be obtained from Sincapore.</p>

<p>For this great boon, the Colonists are indebted to LORD
AUCKLAND, the First Lord of the Admiralty, for his ready
acquiescence in agreeing to receive the timber, by way of
experiment; to Mr. G. H. Ward, the Secretary, for the kind
attention he has paid to every request made to him on the
subject, notwithstanding that he has been sufficiently pestered
to have wearied the patience of the most amiable of mankind; and,
above all, to our late Governor, MR. HUTT, and his brother, the
Honourable Member for Gateshead, who have been indefatigable in
their exertions to promote the weal of the Colony.</p>
