<h2><a id="ch1">1</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE desert shimmered in the heat waves. Conan the
Cimmerian stared out over the aching desolation and involuntarily
drew the back of his powerful hand over his blackened lips. He
stood like a bronze image in the sand, apparently impervious to the
murderous sun, though his only garment was a silk loin-cloth,
girdled by a wide gold-buckled belt from which hung a saber and a
broad-bladed poniard. On his clean-cut limbs were evidences of
scarcely healed wounds.</p>

<p>At his feet rested a girl, one white arm clasping his knee,
against which her blonde head drooped. Her white skin contrasted
with his hard bronzed limbs; her short silken tunic, low-necked and
sleeveless, girdled at the waist, emphasized rather than concealed
her lithe figure.</p>

<p>Conan shook his head, blinking. The sun's glare half blinded
him. He lifted a small canteen from his belt and shook it, scowling
at the faint splashing within.</p>

<p>The girl moved wearily, whimpering.</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan, we shall die here! I am so thirsty!"</p>

<p>The Cimmerian growled wordlessly, glaring truculently at the
surrounding waste, with outthrust jaw, and blue eyes smoldering
savagely from under his black tousled mane, as if the desert were a
tangible enemy.</p>

<p>He stooped and put the canteen to the girl's lips.</p>

<p>"Drink till I tell you to stop, Natala," he commanded.</p>

<p>She drank with little panting gasps, and he did not check her.
Only when the canteen was empty did she realize that he had
deliberately allowed her to drink all their water supply, little
enough that it was.</p>

<p>Tears sprang to her eyes. "Oh, Conan," she wailed, wringing her
hands, "why did you let me drink it all? I did not know&mdash;now
there is none for you!"</p>

<p>"Hush," he growled. "Don't waste your strength in weeping."</p>

<p>Straightening, he threw the canteen from him.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" she whispered.</p>

<p>He did not reply, standing motionless and immobile, his fingers
closing slowly about the hilt of his saber. He was not looking at
the girl; his fierce eyes seemed to plumb the mysterious purple
hazes of the distance.</p>

<p>Endowed with all the barbarian's ferocious love of life and
instinct to live, Conan the Cimmerian yet knew that he had reached
the end of his trail. He had not come to the limits of his
endurance, but he knew another day under the merciless sun in those
waterless wastes would bring him down. As for the girl, she had
suffered enough. Better a quick painless sword-stroke than the
lingering agony that faced him. Her thirst was temporarily
quenched; it was a false mercy to let her suffer until delirium and
death brought relief. Slowly he slid the saber from its sheath.</p>

<p>He halted suddenly, stiffening. Far out on the desert to the
south, something glimmered through the heat waves.</p>

<p>At first he thought it was a phantom, one of the mirages which
had mocked and maddened him in that accursed desert. Shading his
sun-dazzled eyes, he made out spires and minarets, and gleaming
walls. He watched it grimly, waiting for it to fade and vanish.
Natala had ceased to sob; she struggled to her knees and followed
his gaze.</p>

<p>"Is it a city, Conan?" she whispered, too fearful to hope. "Or
is it but a shadow?"</p>

<p>The Cimmerian did not reply for a space. He closed and opened
his eyes several times; he looked away, then back. The city
remained where he had first seen it.</p>

<p>"The devil knows," he grunted. "It's worth a try, though."</p>

<p>He thrust the saber back in its sheath. Stooping, he lifted
Natala in his mighty arms as though she had been an infant. She
resisted weakly.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your strength carrying me, Conan," she pleaded. "I
can walk."</p>

<p>"The ground gets rockier here," he answered. "You would soon
wear your sandals to shreds," glancing at her soft green footwear.
"Besides, if we are to reach that city at all, we must do it
quickly, and I can make better time this way."</p>

<p>The chance for life had lent fresh vigor and resilience to the
Cimmerian's steely thews. He strode out across the sandy waste as
if he had just begun the journey. A barbarian of barbarians, the
vitality and endurance of the wild were his, granting him survival
where civilized men would have perished.</p>

<p>He and the girl were, so far as he knew, the sole survivors of
Prince Almuric's army, that mad motley horde which, following the
defeated rebel prince of Koth, swept through the Lands of Shem like
a devastating sandstorm and drenched the outlands of Stygia with
blood. With a Stygian host on its heels, it had cut its way through
the black kingdom of Kush, only to be annihilated on the edge of
the southern desert. Conan likened it in his mind to a great
torrent, dwindling gradually as it rushed southward, to run dry at
last in the sands of the naked desert. The bones of its
members&mdash;mercenaries, outcasts, broken men, outlaws&mdash;lay
strewn from the Kothic uplands to the dunes of the wilderness.</p>

<p>From that final slaughter, when the Stygians and the Kushites
closed in on the trapped remnants, Conan had cut his way clear and
fled on a camel with the girl. Behind them the land swarmed with
enemies; the only way open to them was the desert to the south.
Into those menacing depths they had plunged.</p>

<p>The girl was Brythunian, whom Conan had found in the
slave-market of a stormed Shemite city, and appropriated. She had
had nothing to say in the matter, but her new position was so far
superior to the lot of any Hyborian woman in a Shemitish seraglio,
that she accepted it thankfully. So she had shared in the
adventures of Almuric's damned horde.</p>

<p>For days they had fled into the desert, pursued so far by
Stygian horsemen that when they shook off the pursuit, they dared
not turn back. They pushed on, seeking water, until the camel died.
Then they went on foot. For the past few days their suffering had
been intense. Conan had shielded Natala all he could, and the rough
life of the camp had given her more stamina and strength than the
average woman possesses; but even so, she was not far from
collapse.</p>

<p>The sun beat fiercely on Conan's tangled black mane. Waves of
dizziness and nausea rose in his brain, but he set his teeth and
strode on unwaveringly. He was convinced that the city was a
reality and not a mirage. What they would find there he had no
idea. The inhabitants might be hostile. Nevertheless it was a
fighting chance, and that was as much as he had ever asked.</p>

<p><br>
THE sun was nigh to setting when they halted in front of the
massive gate, grateful for the shade. Conan stood Natala on her
feet, and stretched his aching arms. Above them the walls towered
some thirty feet in height, composed of a smooth greenish substance
that shone almost like glass. Conan scanned the parapets, expecting
to be challenged, but saw no one. Impatiently he shouted, and
banged on the gate with his saber hilt, but only the hollow echoes
mocked him. Natala cringed close to him, frightened by the silence.
Conan tried the portal, and stepped back, drawing his saber, as it
swung silently inward. Natala stifled a cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Conan!"</p>

<p>Just inside the gate lay a human body. Conan glared at it
narrowly, then looked beyond it. He saw a wide open expanse, like a
court, bordered by the arched doorways of houses composed of the
same greenish material as the outer walls. These edifices were
lofty and imposing, pinnacled with shining domes and minarets.
There was no sign of life among them. In the center of the court
rose the square curb of a well, and the sight stung Conan, whose
mouth felt caked with dry dust. Taking Natala's wrist he drew her
through the gate, and closed it behind them.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" she whispered, shrinkingly indicating the man who
lay limply before the gate. The body was that of a tall powerful
individual, apparently in his prime; the skin was yellow, the eyes
slightly slanted; otherwise the man differed little from the
Hyborian type. He was clad in high- strapped sandals and a tunic of
purple silk, and a short sword in a cloth-of- gold scabbard hung
from his girdle. Conan felt his flesh. It was cold. There was no
sign of life in the body.</p>

<p>"Not a wound on him," grunted the Cimmerian, "but he's dead as
Almuric with forty Stygian arrows in him. In Crom's name, let's see
to the well! If there's water in it, we'll drink, dead men or
no."</p>

<p>There was water in the well, but they did not drink of it. Its
level was a good fifty feet below the curb, and there was nothing
to draw it up with. Conan cursed blackly, maddened by the sight of
the stuff just out of his reach, and turned to look for some means
of obtaining it. Then a scream from Natala brought him about.</p>

<p>The supposedly dead man was rushing upon him, eyes blazing with
indisputable life, his short sword gleaming in his hand. Conan
cursed amazedly, but wasted no time in conjecture. He met the
hurtling attacker with a slashing cut of his saber that sheared
through flesh and bone. The fellow's head thudded on the flags; the
body staggered drunkenly, an arch of blood jetting from the severed
jugular; then it fell heavily.</p>

<p>Conan glared down, swearing softly.</p>

<p>"This fellow is no deader now than he was a few minutes agone.
Into what madhouse have we strayed?"</p>

<p>Natala, who had covered her eyes with her hands at the sight,
peeked between her fingers and shook with fear.</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan, will the people of the city not kill us, because of
this?"</p>

<p>"Well," he growled, "this creature would have killed us if I
hadn't lopped off his head."</p>

<p>He glanced at the archways that gaped blankly from the green
walls above them. He saw no hint of movement, heard no sound.</p>

<p>"I don't think any one saw us," he muttered. "I'll hide the
evidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted the limp carcass by its swordbelt with one hand, and
grasping the head by its long hair in the other, he half carried,
half dragged the ghastly remains over to the well.</p>

<p>"Since we can't drink this water," he gritted vindictively,
"I'll see that nobody else enjoys drinking it. Curse such a well,
anyway!" He heaved the body over the curb and let it drop, tossing
the head after it. A dull splash sounded far beneath.</p>

<p>"There's blood on the stones," whispered Natala.</p>

<p>"There'll be more unless I find water soon," growled the
Cimmerian, his short store of patience about exhausted. The girl
had almost forgotten her thirst and hunger in her fear, but not
Conan.</p>

<p>"We'll go into one of these doors," he said. "Surely we'll find
people after awhile."</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan!" she wailed, snuggling up as close to him as she
could. "I'm afraid! This is a city of ghosts and dead men! Let us
go back into the desert! Better to die there, than to face these
terrors!"</p>

<p>"We'll go into the desert when they throw us off the walls," he
snarled. "There's water somewhere in this city, and I'll find it,
if I have to kill every man in it."</p>

<p>"But what if they come to life again?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Then I'll keep killing them until they stay dead!" he snapped.
"Come on! That doorway is as good as another! Stay behind me, but
don't run unless I tell you to."</p>

<p><br>
SHE murmured a faint assent and followed him so closely that she
stepped on his heels, to his irritation. Dusk had fallen, filling
the strange city with purple shadows. They entered the open
doorway, and found themselves in a wide chamber, the walls of which
were hung with velvet tapestries, worked in curious designs. Floor,
walls and ceiling were of the green glassy stone, the walls
decorated with gold frieze-work. Furs and satin cushions littered
the floor. Several doorways let into other rooms. They passed
through, and traversed several chambers, counterparts of the first.
They saw no one, but the Cimmerian grunted suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Some one was here not long ago. This couch is still warm from
contact with a human body. That silk cushion bears the imprint of
some one's hips. Then there's a faint scent of perfume lingering in
the air."</p>

<p>A weird unreal atmosphere hung over all. Traversing this dim
silent palace was like an opium dream. Some of the chambers were
unlighted, and these they avoided. Others were bathed in a soft
weird light that seemed to emanate from jewels set in the walls in
fantastic designs. Suddenly, as they passed into one of these
illumined chambers, Natala cried out and clutched her companion's
arm. With a curse he wheeled, glaring for an enemy, bewildered
because he saw none.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he snarled. "If you ever grab my sword arm
again, I'll skin you. Do you want me to get my throat cut? What
were you yelling about?"</p>

<p>"Look there," she quavered, pointing.</p>

<p>Conan grunted. On a table of polished ebony stood golden
vessels, apparently containing food and drink. The room was
unoccupied.</p>

<p>"Well, whoever this feast is prepared for," he growled, "he'll
have to look elsewhere tonight."</p>

<p>"Dare we eat it, Conan?" ventured the girl nervously. "The
people might come upon us, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lir an mannanan mac lira," he swore, grabbing her by the nape
of her neck and thrusting her into a gilded chair at the end of the
table with no great ceremony. "We starve and you make objections!
Eat!"</p>

<p>He took the chair at the other end, and seizing a jade goblet,
emptied it at a gulp. It contained a crimson wine-like liquor of a
peculiar tang, unfamiliar to him, but it was like nectar to his
parched gullet. His thirst allayed, he attacked the food before him
with rare gusto. It too was strange to him: exotic fruits and
unknown meats. The vessels were of exquisite workmanship, and there
were golden knives and forks as well. These Conan ignored, grasping
the meat-joints in his fingers and tearing them with his strong
teeth. The Cimmerian's table manners were rather wolfish at any
time. His civilized companion ate more daintily, but just as
ravenously. It occurred to Conan that the food might be poisoned,
but the thought did not lessen his appetite; he preferred to die of
poisoning rather than starvation.</p>

<p>His hunger satisfied, he leaned back with a deep sigh of relief.
That there were humans in that silent city was evidenced by the
fresh food, and perhaps every dark corner concealed a lurking
enemy. But he felt no apprehension on that score, having a large
confidence in his own fighting ability. He began to feel sleepy,
and considered the idea of stretching himself on a near-by couch
for a nap.</p>

<p>Not so Natala. She was no longer hungry and thirsty, but she
felt no desire to sleep. Her lovely eyes were very wide indeed as
she timidly glanced at the doorways, boundaries of the unknown. The
silence and mystery of the strange place preyed on her. The chamber
seemed larger, the table longer than she had first noticed, and she
realized that she was farther from her grim protector than she
wished to be. Rising quickly, she went around the table and seated
herself on his knee, glancing nervously at the arched doorways.
Some were lighted and some were not, and it was at the unlighted
ones she gazed longest.</p>

<p>"We have eaten, drunk and rested," she urged. "Let us leave this
place, Conan. It's evil. I can feel it."</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't been harmed so far," he began, when a soft but
sinister rustling brought him about. Thrusting the girl off his
knee he rose with the quick ease of a panther, drawing his saber,
facing the doorway from which the sound had seemed to come. It was
not repeated, and he stole forward noiselessly, Natala following
with her heart in her mouth. She knew he suspected peril. His
outthrust head was sunk between his giant shoulders; he glided
forward in a half crouch, like a stalking tiger. He made no more
noise than a tiger would have made.</p>

<p>At the doorway he halted, Natala peering fearfully from behind
him. There was no light in the room, but it was partially
illuminated by the radiance behind them, which streamed across it
into yet another chamber. And in this chamber a man lay on a raised
dais. The soft light bathed him, and they saw he was a counterpart
of the man Conan had killed before the outer gate, except that his
garments were richer, and ornamented with jewels which twinkled in
the uncanny light. Was he dead, or merely sleeping? Again came that
faint sinister sound, as if some one had thrust aside a hanging.
Conan drew back, drawing the clinging Natala with him. He clapped
his hand over her mouth just in time to check her shriek.</p>

<p><br>
FROM where they now stood, they could no longer see the dais,
but they could see the shadow it cast on the wall behind it. And
now another shadow moved across the wall: a huge shapeless black
blot. Conan felt his hair prickle curiously as he watched.
Distorted though it might be, he felt that he had never seen a man
or beast which cast such a shadow. He was consumed with curiosity,
but some instinct held him frozen in his tracks. He heard Natala's
quick panting gasps as she stared with dilated eyes. No other sound
disturbed the tense stillness. The great shadow engulfed that of
the dais. For a long instant only its black bulk was thrown on the
smooth wall. Then slowly it receded, and once more the dais was
etched darkly against the wall. But the sleeper was no longer upon
it.</p>

<p>An hysterical gurgle rose in Natala's throat, and Conan gave her
an admonitory shake. He was aware of an iciness in his own veins.
Human foes he did not fear; anything understandable, however
grisly, caused no tremors in his broad breast. But this was beyond
his ken.</p>

<p>After a while, however, his curiosity conquered his uneasiness,
and he moved out into the unlighted chamber again, ready for
anything. Looking into the other room, he saw it was empty. The
dais stood as he had first seen it, except that no bejeweled human
lay thereon. Only on its silken covering shone a single drop of
blood, like a great crimson gem. Natala saw it and gave a low
choking cry, for which Conan did not punish her. Again he felt the
icy hand of fear. On that dais a man had lain; something had crept
into the chamber and carried him away. What that something was,
Conan had no idea, but an aura of unnatural horror hung over those
dim-lit chambers.</p>

<p>He was ready to depart. Taking Natala's hand, he turned back,
then hesitated. Somewhere back among the chambers they had
traversed, he heard the sound of a footfall. A human foot, bare or
softly shod, had made that sound, and Conan, with the wariness of a
wolf, turned quickly aside. He believed he could come again into
the outer court, and yet avoid the room from which the sound had
appeared to come.</p>

<p>But they had not crossed the first chamber on their new route,
when the rustle of a silken hanging brought them about suddenly.
Before a curtained alcove stood a man eyeing them intently.</p>

<p>He was exactly like the others they had encountered: tall, well
made, clad in purple garments, with a jeweled girdle. There was
neither surprise nor hostility in his amber eyes. They were dreamy
as a lotus-eater's. He did not draw the short sword at his side.
After a tense moment he spoke, in a far-away detached tone, and a
language his hearers did not understand.</p>

<p>On a venture Conan replied in Stygian, and the stranger answered
in the same tongue: "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Conan, a Cimmerian," answered the barbarian. "This is
Natala, of Brythunia. What city is this?"</p>

<p>The man did not at once reply. His dreamy sensuous gaze rested
on Natala, and he drawled, "Of all my rich visions, this is the
strangest! Oh, girl of the golden locks, from what far dreamland do
you come? From Andarra, or Tothra, or Kuth of the star-girdle?"</p>

<p>"What madness is this?" growled the Cimmerian harshly, not
relishing the man's words or manner.</p>

<p>The other did not heed him.</p>

<p>"I have dreamed more gorgeous beauties," he murmured; "lithe
women with hair dusky as night, and dark eyes of unfathomed
mystery. But your skin is white as milk, your eyes as clear as
dawn, and there is about you a freshness and daintiness alluring as
honey. Come to my couch, little dream-girl!"</p>

<p>He advanced and reached for her, and Conan struck aside his hand
with a force that might have broken his arm. The man reeled back,
clutching the numbed member, his eyes clouding.</p>

<p>"What rebellion of ghosts is this?" he muttered. "Barbarian, I
command ye&mdash;begone! Fade! Dissipate! Fade! Vanish!"</p>

<p>"I'll vanish your head from your shoulders!" snarled the
infuriated Cimmerian, his saber gleaming in his hand. "Is this the
welcome you give strangers? By Crom, I'll drench these hangings in
blood!"</p>

<p>The dreaminess had faded from the other's eyes, to be replaced
by a look of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Thog!" he ejaculated. "You are real! Whence come you? Who are
you? What do you in Xuthal?"</p>

<p>"We came from the desert," Conan growled. "We wandered into the
city at dusk, famishing. We found a feast set for some one, and we
ate it. I have no money to pay for it. In my country, no starving
man is denied food, but you civilized people must have your
recompense&mdash;if you are like all I ever met. We have done no
harm and we were just leaving. By Crom, I do not like this place,
where dead men rise, and sleeping men vanish into the bellies of
shadows!"</p>

<p>The man started violently at the last comment, his yellow face
turning ashy.</p>

<p>"What do you say? Shadows? Into the bellies of shadows?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the Cimmerian cautiously, "whatever it is that
takes a man from a sleeping-dais and leaves only a spot of
blood."</p>

<p>"You have seen? You have seen?" The man was shaking like a leaf;
his voice cracked on the high-pitched note.</p>

<p>"Only a man sleeping on a dais, and a shadow that engulfed him,"
answered Conan.</p>

<p>The effect of his words on the other was horrifying. With an
awful scream the man turned and rushed from the chamber. In his
blind haste he caromed from the side of the door, righted himself,
and fled through the adjoining chambers, still screaming at the top
of his voice. Amazed, Conan stared after him, the girl trembling as
she clutched the giant's arm. They could no longer see the flying
figure, but they still heard his frightful screams, dwindling in
the distance, and echoing as from vaulted roofs. Suddenly one cry,
louder than the others, rose and broke short, followed by blank
silence.</p>

<p>"Crom!"</p>

<p>Conan wiped the perspiration from his forehead with a hand that
was not entirely steady.</p>

<p>"Surely this is a city of the mad! Let's get out of here, before
we meet other madmen!"</p>

<p>"It is all a nightmare!" whimpered Natala. "We are dead and
damned! We died out on the desert and are in hell! We are
disembodied spirits&mdash;ow!" Her yelp was induced by a resounding
spank from Conan's open hand.</p>

<p>"You're no spirit when a pat makes you yell like that," he
commented, with the grim humor which frequently manifested itself
at inopportune times. "We are alive, though we may not be if we
loiter in this devil-haunted pile. Come!"</p>

<p><br>
THEY had traversed but a single chamber when again they stopped
short. Some one or something was approaching. They faced the
doorway whence the sounds came, waiting for they knew not what.
Conan's nostrils widened, and his eyes narrowed. He caught the
faint scent of the perfume he had noticed earlier in the night. A
figure framed itself in the doorway. Conan swore under his breath;
Natala's red lips opened wide.</p>

<p>It was a woman who stood there staring at them in wonder. She
was tall, lithe, shaped like a goddess; clad in a narrow girdle
crusted with jewels. A burnished mass of night-black hair set off
the whiteness of her ivory body. Her dark eyes, shaded by long
dusky lashes, were deep with sensuous mystery. Conan caught his
breath at her beauty, and Natala stared with dilated eyes. The
Cimmerian had never seen such a woman; her facial outline was
Stygian, but she was not dusky-skinned like the Stygian women he
had known; her limbs were like alabaster.</p>

<p>But when she spoke, in a deep rich musical voice, it was in the
Stygian tongue.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you in Xuthal? Who is that girl?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" bluntly countered Conan, who quickly wearied of
answering questions.</p>

<p>"I am Thalis the Stygian," she replied. "Are you mad, to come
here?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking I must be," he growled. "By Crom, if I am
sane, I'm out of place here, because these people are all maniacs.
We stagger in from the desert, dying of thirst and hunger, and we
come upon a dead man who tries to stab me in the back. We enter a
palace rich and luxuriant, yet apparently empty. We find a meal
set, but with no feasters. Then we see a shadow devour a sleeping
man&mdash;" He watched her narrowly and saw her change color
slightly. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well what?" she demanded, apparently regaining control of
herself.</p>

<p>"I was just waiting for you to run through the rooms howling
like a wild woman," he answered. "The man I told about the shadow
did."</p>

<p>She shrugged her slim ivory shoulders. "That was the screams I
heard, then. Well, to every man his fate, and it's foolish to
squeal like a rat in a trap. When Thog wants me, he will come for
me."</p>

<p>"Who is Thog?" demanded Conan suspiciously.</p>

<p>She gave him a long appraising stare that brought color to
Natala's face and made her bite her small red lip.</p>

<p>"Sit down on that divan and I will tell you," she said. "But
first tell me your names."</p>

<p>"I am Conan, a Cimmerian, and this is Natala, a daughter of
Brythunia," he answered. "We are refugees of an army destroyed on
the borders of Kush. But I am not desirous of sitting down, where
black shadows might steal up on my back."</p>

<p>With a light musical laugh, she seated herself, stretching out
her supple limbs with studied abandon.</p>

<p>"Be at ease," she advised. "If Thog wishes you, he will take
you, wherever you are. That man you mentioned, who screamed and
ran&mdash;did you not hear him give one great cry, and then fall
silent? In his frenzy, he must have run full into that which he
sought to escape. No man can avoid his fate."</p>

<p>Conan grunted non-committally, but he sat down on the edge of a
couch, his saber across his knees, his eyes wandering suspiciously
about the chamber. Natala nestled against him, clutching him
jealously, her legs tucked up under her. She eyed the stranger
woman with suspicion and resentment. She felt small and
dust-stained and insignificant before this glamorous beauty, and
she could not mistake the look in the dark eyes which feasted on
every detail of the bronzed giant's physique.</p>

<p>"What is this place, and who are these people?" demanded
Conan.</p>

<p>"This city is called Xuthal; it is very ancient. It is built
over an oasis, which the founders of Xuthal found in their
wanderings. They came from the east, so long ago that not even
their descendants remember the age."</p>

<p>"Surely there are not many of them; these palaces seem
empty."</p>

<p>"No; and yet more than you might think. The city is really one
great palace, with every building inside the walls closely
connected with the others. You might walk among these chambers for
hours and see no one. At other times, you would meet hundreds of
the inhabitants."</p>

<p>"How is that?" Conan inquired uneasily; this savored too
strongly of sorcery for comfort.</p>

<p>"Much of the time these people lie in sleep. Their dream-life is
as important&mdash;and to them as real&mdash;as their waking life.
You have heard of the black lotus? In certain pits of the city it
grows. Through the ages they have cultivated it, until, instead of
death, its juice induces dreams, gorgeous and fantastic. In these
dreams they spend most of their time. Their lives are vague,
erratic, and without plan. They dream, they wake, drink, love, eat
and dream again. They seldom finish anything they begin, but leave
it half completed and sink back again into the slumber of the black
lotus. That meal you found&mdash;doubtless one awoke, felt the urge
of hunger, prepared the meal for himself, then forgot about it and
wandered away to dream again."</p>

<p>"Where do they get their food?" interrupted Conan. "I saw no
fields or vineyards outside the city. Have they orchards and
cattle-pens within the walls?"</p>

<p><br>
SHE shook her head. "They manufacture their own food out of the
primal elements. They are wonderful scientists, when they are not
drugged with their dream-flower. Their ancestors were mental
giants, who built this marvelous city in the desert, and though the
race became slaves to their curious passions, some of their
wonderful knowledge still remains. Have you wondered about these
lights? They are jewels, fused with radium. You rub them with your
thumb to make them glow, and rub them again, the opposite way, to
extinguish them. That is but a single example of their science. But
much they have forgotten. They take little interest in waking life,
choosing to lie most of the time in death- like sleep."</p>

<p>"Then the dead man at the gate&mdash;" began Conan.</p>

<p>"Was doubtless slumbering. Sleepers of the lotus are like the
dead. Animation is apparently suspended. It is impossible to detect
the slightest sign of life. The spirit has left the body and is
roaming at will through other, exotic worlds. The man at the gate
was a good example of the irresponsibility of these people's lives.
He was guarding the gate, where custom decrees a watch be kept,
though no enemy has ever advanced across the desert. In other parts
of the city you would find other guards, generally sleeping as
soundly as the man at the gate."</p>

<p>Conan mulled over this for a space.</p>

<p>"Where are the people now?"</p>

<p>"Scattered in different parts of the city; lying on couches, on
silken divans, in cushion-littered alcoves, on fur-covered daises;
all wrapt in the shining veil of dreams."</p>

<p>Conan felt the skin twitch between his massive shoulders. It was
not soothing to think of hundreds of people lying cold and still
throughout the tapestried palaces, their glassy eyes turned
unseeingly upward. He remembered something else.</p>

<p>"What of the thing that stole through the chambers and carried
away the man on the dais?"</p>

<p>A shudder twitched her ivory limbs.</p>

<p>"That was Thog, the Ancient, the god of Xuthal, who dwells in
the sunken dome in the center of the city. He has always dwelt in
Xuthal. Whether he came here with the ancient founders, or was here
when they built the city, none knows. But the people of Xuthal
worship him. Mostly he sleeps below the city, but sometimes at
irregular intervals he grows hungry, and then he steals through the
secret corridors and the dim-lit chambers, seeking prey. Then none
is safe."</p>

<p>Natala moaned with terror and clasped Conan's mighty neck as if
to resist an effort to drag her from her protector's side.</p>

<p>"Crom!" he ejaculated aghast. "You mean to tell me these people
lie down calmly and sleep, with this demon crawling among
them?"</p>

<p>"It is only occasionally that he is hungry," she repeated. "A
god must have his sacrifices. When I was a child in Stygia the
people lived under the shadow of the priests. None ever knew when
he or she would be seized and dragged to the altar. What difference
whether the priests give a victim to the gods, or the god comes for
his own victim?"</p>

<p>"Such is not the custom of my people," Conan growled, "nor of
Natala's either. The Hyborians do not sacrifice humans to their
god, Mitra, and as for my people&mdash;by Crom, I'd like to see a
priest try to drag a Cimmerian to the altar! There'd be blood
spilt, but not as the priest intended."</p>

<p>"You are a barbarian," laughed Thalis, but with a glow in her
luminous eyes. "Thog is very ancient and very terrible."</p>

<p>"These folk must be either fools or heroes," grunted Conan, "to
lie down and dream their idiotic dreams, knowing they might awaken
in his belly."</p>

<p>She laughed. "They know nothing else. For untold generations
Thog has preyed on them. He has been one of the factors which have
reduced their numbers from thousands to hundreds. A few more
generations and they will be extinct, and Thog must either fare
forth into the world for new prey, or retire to the underworld
whence he came so long ago.</p>

<p>"They realize their ultimate doom, but they are fatalists,
incapable of resistance or escape. Not one of the present
generation has been out of sight of these walls. There is an oasis
a day's march to the south&mdash;I have seen it on the old maps
their ancestors drew on parchment&mdash;but no man of Xuthal has
visited it for three generations, much less made any attempt to
explore the fertile grasslands which the maps show lying another
day's march beyond it. They are a fast-fading race, drowned in
lotus dreams, stimulating their waking hours by means of the golden
wine which heals wounds, prolongs life, and invigorates the most
sated debauchee.</p>

<p>"Yet they cling to life, and fear the deity they worship. You
saw how one went mad at the knowledge that Thog was roving the
palaces. I have seen the whole city screaming and tearing its hair,
and running frenziedly out of the gates, to cower outside the walls
and draw lots to see which would be bound and flung back through
the arched doorways to satisfy Thog's lust and hunger. Were they
not all slumbering now, the word of his coming would send them
raving and shrieking again through the outer gates."</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan!" begged Natala hysterically. "Let us flee!"</p>

<p>"In good time," muttered Conan, his eyes burning on Thalis's
ivory limbs. "What are you, a Stygian woman, doing here?"</p>

<p><br>
"I CAME here when a young girl," she answered, leaning lithely
back against the velvet divan, and intertwining her slender fingers
behind her dusky head. "I am the daughter of a king, no common
woman, as you can see by my skin, which is as white as that of your
little blonde there. I was abducted by a rebel prince, who, with an
army of Kushite bowmen, pushed southward into the wilderness,
searching for a land he could make his own. He and all his warriors
perished in the desert, but one, before he died, placed me on a
camel and walked beside it until he dropped and died in his tracks.
The beast wandered on, and I finally passed into delirium from
thirst and hunger, and awakened in this city. They told me I had
been seen from the walls, early in the dawn, lying senseless beside
a dead camel. They went forth and brought me in and revived me with
their wonderful golden wine. And only the sight of a woman would
have led them to have ventured that far from their walls.</p>

<p>"They were naturally much interested in me, especially the men.
As I could not speak their language, they learned to speak mine.
They are very quick and able of intellect; they learned my language
long before I learned theirs. But they were more interested in me
than in my language. I have been, and am, the only thing for which
a man of them will forgo his lotus-dreams for a space."</p>

<p>She laughed wickedly, flashing her audacious eyes meaningly at
Conan.</p>

<p>"Of course the women are jealous of me," she continued
tranquilly. "They are handsome enough in their yellow-skinned way,
but they are dreamy and uncertain as the men, and these latter like
me not only for my beauty, but for my reality. I am no dream!
Though I have dreamed the dreams of the lotus, I am a normal woman,
with earthly emotions and desires. With such these moon-eyed yellow
women can not compare.</p>

<p>"That is why it would be better for you to cut that girl's
throat with your saber, before the men of Xuthal waken and catch
her. They will put her through paces she never dreamed of! She is
too soft to endure what I have thrived on. I am a daughter of
Luxur, and before I had known fifteen summers I had been led
through the temples of Derketo, the dusky goddess, and had been
initiated into the mysteries. Not that my first years in Xuthal
were years of unmodified pleasure! The people of Xuthal have
forgotten more than the priestesses of Derketo ever dreamed. They
live only for sensual joys. Dreaming or waking, their lives are
filled with exotic ecstasies, beyond the ken of ordinary men."</p>

<p>"Damned degenerates!" growled Conan.</p>

<p>"It is all in the point of view," smiled Thalis lazily.</p>

<p>"Well," he decided, "we're merely wasting time. I can see this
is no place for ordinary mortals. We'll be gone before your morons
awake, or Thog comes to devour us. I think the desert would be
kinder."</p>

<p>Natala, whose blood had curdled in her veins at Thalis's words,
fervently agreed. She could speak Stygian only brokenly, but she
understood it well enough. Conan stood up, drawing her up beside
him.</p>

<p>"If you'll show us the nearest way out of this city," he
grunted, "we'll take ourselves off." But his gaze lingered on the
Stygian's sleek limbs and ivory breasts.</p>

<p>She did not miss his look, and she smiled enigmatically as she
rose with the lithe ease of a great lazy cat.</p>

<p>"Follow me," she directed and led the way, conscious of Conan's
eyes fixed on her supple figure and perfectly poised carriage. She
did not go the way they had come, but before Conan's suspicions
could be roused, she halted in a wide ivory-cased chamber, and
pointed to a tiny fountain which gurgled in the center of the ivory
floor.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to wash your face, child?" she asked Natala. "It
is stained with dust, and there is dust in your hair."</p>

<p>Natala colored resentfully at the suggestion of malice in the
Stygian's faintly mocking tone, but she complied, wondering
miserably just how much havoc the desert sun and wind had wrought
on her complexion&mdash;a feature for which women of her race were
justly noted. She knelt beside the fountain, shook back her hair,
slipped her tunic down to her waist, and began to lave not only her
face, but her white arms and shoulders as well.</p>

<p>"By Crom!" grumbled Conan. "A woman will stop to consider her
beauty, if the devil himself were on her heels. Haste, girl; you'll
be dusty again before we've got out of sight of this city. And
Thalis, I'd take it kindly if you'd furnish us with a bit of food
and drink."</p>

<p>For answer Thalis leaned herself against him, slipping one white
arm about his bronzed shoulders. Her sleek naked flank pressed
against his thigh and the perfume of her foamy hair was in his
nostrils.</p>

<p>"Why dare the desert?" she whispered urgently. "Stay here! I
will teach you the ways of Xuthal. I will protect you. I will love
you! You are a real man: I am sick of these moon-calves who sigh
and dream and wake, and dream again. I am hungry for the hard,
clean passion of a man from the earth. The blaze of your dynamic
eyes makes my heart pound in my bosom, and the touch of your
iron-thewed arm maddens me.</p>

<p>"Stay here! I will make you king of Xuthal! I will show you all
the ancient mysteries, and the exotic ways of pleasure! I&mdash;"
She had thrown both arms about his neck and was standing on tiptoe,
her vibrant body shivering against his. Over her ivory shoulder he
saw Natala, throwing back her damp tousled hair, stop short, her
lovely eyes dilating, her red lips parting in a shocked O. With an
embarrassed grunt, Conan disengaged Thalis's clinging arms and put
her aside with one massive arm. She threw a swift glance at the
Brythunian girl and smiled enigmatically, seeming to nod her
splendid head in mysterious cogitation.</p>

<p>Natala rose and jerked up her tunic, her eyes blazing, her lips
pouting sulkily. Conan swore under his breath. He was no more
monogamous in his nature than the average soldier of fortune, but
there was an innate decency about him that was Natala's best
protection.</p>

<p>Thalis did not press her suit. Beckoning them with her slender
hand to follow, she turned and walked across the chamber.</p>

<p>There, close to the tapestried wall, she halted suddenly. Conan,
watching her, wondered if she had heard the sounds that might be
made by a nameless monster stealing through the midnight chambers,
and his skin crawled at the thought.</p>

<p>"What do you hear?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Watch that doorway," she replied, pointing.</p>

<p>He wheeled, sword ready. Only the empty arch of the entrance met
his gaze. Then behind him sounded a quick faint scuffling noise, a
half-choked gasp. He whirled. Thalis and Natala had vanished. The
tapestry was settling back in place, as if it had been lifted away
from the wall. As he gaped bewilderedly, from behind that
tapestried wall rang a muffled scream in the voice of the
Brythunian girl.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2">2</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Conan turned, in compliance with Thalis's
request, to glare at the doorway opposite, Natala had been standing
just behind him, close to the side of the Stygian. The instant the
Cimmerian's back was turned, Thalis, with a pantherish quickness
almost incredible, clapped her hand over Natala's mouth, stifling
the cry she tried to give. Simultaneously the Stygian's other arm
was passed about the blonde girl's supple waist, and she was jerked
back against the wall, which seemed to give way as Thalis' shoulder
pressed against it. A section of the wall swung inward, and through
a slit that opened in the tapestry Thalis slid with her captive,
just as Conan wheeled back.</p>

<p>Inside was utter blackness as the secret door swung to again.
Thalis paused to fumble at it for an instant, apparently sliding
home a bolt, and as she took her hand from Natala's mouth to
perform this act, the Brythunian girl began to scream at the top of
her voice. Thalis's laugh was like poisoned honey in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Scream if you will, little fool. It will only shorten your
life."</p>

<p>At that Natala ceased suddenly, and cowered shaking in every
limb.</p>

<p>"Why did you do this?" she begged. "What are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to take you down this corridor for a short
distance," answered Thalis, "and leave you for one who will sooner
or later come for you."</p>

<p>"Ohhhhhh!" Natala's voice broke in a sob of terror. "Why should
you harm me? I have never injured you!"</p>

<p>"I want your warrior. You stand in my way. He desires me&mdash;I
could read the look in his eyes. But for you, he would be willing
to stay here and be my king. When you are out of the way, he will
follow me."</p>

<p>"He will cut your throat," answered Natala with conviction,
knowing Conan better than Thalis did.</p>

<p>"We shall see," answered the Stygian coolly from the confidence
of her power over men. "At any rate, you will not know whether he
stabs or kisses me, because you will be the bride of him who dwells
in darkness. Come!"</p>

<p>Half mad with terror, Natala fought like a wild thing, but it
availed her nothing. With a lithe strength she would not have
believed possible in a woman, Thalis picked her up and carried her
down the black corridor as if she had been a child. Natala did not
scream again, remembering the Stygian's sinister words; the only
sounds were her desperate quick panting and Thalis' soft taunting
lascivious laughter. Then the Brythunian's fluttering hand closed
on something in the dark&mdash;a jeweled dagger-hilt jutting from
Thalis's gem-crusted girdle. Natala jerked it forth and struck
blindly and with all her girlish power.</p>

<p>A scream burst from Thalis's lips, feline in its pain and fury.
She reeled, and Natala slipped from her relaxing grasp, to bruise
her tender limbs on the smooth stone floor. Rising, she scurried to
the nearest wall and stood there panting and trembling, flattening
herself against the stones. She could not see Thalis, but she could
hear her. The Stygian was quite certainly not dead. She was cursing
in a steady stream, and her fury was so concentrated and deadly
that Natala felt her bones turn to wax, her blood to ice.</p>

<p>"Where are you, you little she-devil?" gasped Thalis. "Let me
get my fingers on you again, and I'll&mdash;" Natala grew
physically sick as Thalis described the bodily injuries she
intended to inflict on her rival. The Stygian's choice of language
would have shamed the toughest courtesan in Aquilonia.</p>

<p>Natala heard her groping in the dark, and then a light sprang
up. Evidently whatever fear Thalis felt of the black corridor was
submerged in her anger. The light came from one of the radium gems
which adorned the walls of Xuthal. This Thalis had rubbed, and now
she stood bathed in its reddish glow: a light different from that
which the others had emitted. One hand was pressed to her side and
blood trickled between the fingers. But she did not seem weakened
or badly hurt, and her eyes blazed fiendishly. What little courage
remained to Natala ebbed away at sight of the Stygian standing
limned in that weird glow, her beautiful face contorted with a
passion that was no less than hellish. She now advanced with a
pantherish tread, drawing her hand away from her wounded side, and
shaking the blood drops impatiently from her fingers. Natala saw
that she had not badly harmed her rival. The blade had glanced from
the jewels of Thalis's girdle and inflicted only a very superficial
flesh-wound, only enough to rouse the Stygian's unbridled fury.</p>

<p><br>
"GIVE me that dagger, you fool!" she gritted, striding up to the
cowering girl.</p>

<p>Natala knew she ought to fight while she had the chance, but she
simply could not summon up the courage. Never much of a fighter,
the darkness, violence and horror of her adventure had left her
limp, mentally and physically. Thalis snatched the dagger from her
lax fingers and threw it contemptuously aside.</p>

<p>"You little slut!" she ground between her teeth, slapping the
girl viciously with either hand. "Before I drag you down the
corridor and throw you into Thog's jaws I'll have a little of your
blood myself! You would dare to knife me&mdash;well, for that
audacity you shall pay!"</p>

<p>Seizing her by the hair, Thalis dragged her down the corridor a
short distance, to the edge of the circle of light. A metal ring
showed in the wall, above the level of a man's head. From it
depended a silken cord. As in a nightmare Natala felt her tunic
being stripped from her, and the next instant Thalis had jerked up
her wrists and bound them to the ring, where she hung, naked as the
day she was born, her feet barely touching the floor. Twisting her
head, Natala saw Thalis unhook a jewel-handled whip from where it
hung on the wall, near the ring. The lashes consisted of seven
round silk cords, harder yet more pliant than leather thongs.</p>

<p>With a hiss of vindictive gratification, Thalis drew back her
arm, and Natala shrieked as the cords curled across her loins. The
tortured girl writhed, twisted and tore agonizedly at the thongs
which imprisoned her wrists. She had forgotten the lurking menace
her cries might summon, and so apparently had Thalis. Every stroke
evoked screams of anguish. The whippings Natala had received in the
Shemite slave-markets paled to insignificance before this. She had
never guessed the punishing power of hard-woven silk cords. Their
caress was more exquisitely painful than any birch twigs or leather
thongs. They whistled venomously as they cut the air.</p>

<p>Then, as Natala twisted her tear-stained face over her shoulder
to shriek for mercy, something froze her cries. Agony gave place to
paralyzing horror in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>Struck by her expression, Thalis checked her lifted hand and
whirled quick as a cat. Too late! An awful cry rang from her lips
as she swayed back, her arms upflung. Natala saw her for an
instant, a white figure of fear etched against a great black
shapeless mass that towered over her; then the white figure was
whipped off its feet, the shadow receded with it, and in the circle
of dim light Natala hung alone, half fainting with terror.</p>

<p>From the black shadows came sounds, incomprehensible and
blood-freezing. She heard Thalis's voice pleading frenziedly, but
no voice answered. There was no sound except the Stygian's panting
voice, which suddenly rose to screams of agony, and then broke in
hysterical laughter, mingled with sobs. This dwindled to a
convulsive panting, and presently this too ceased, and a silence
more terrible hovered over the secret corridor.</p>

<p><br>
NAUSEATED with horror, Natala twisted about and dared to look
fearfully in the direction the black shape had carried Thalis. She
saw nothing, but she sensed an unseen peril, more grisly than she
could understand. She fought against a rising tide of hysteria. Her
bruised wrists, her smarting body were forgotten in the teeth of
this menace which she dimly felt threatened not only her body, but
her soul as well.</p>

<p>She strained her eyes into the blackness beyond the rim of the
dim light, tense with fear of what she might see. A whimpering gasp
escaped her lips. The darkness was taking form. Something huge and
bulky grew up out of the void. She saw a great misshapen head
emerging into the light. At least she took it for a head, though it
was not the member of any sane or normal creature. She saw a great
toad-like face, the features of which were as dim and unstable as
those of a specter seen in a mirror of nightmare. Great pools of
light that might have been eyes blinked at her, and she shook at
the cosmic lust reflected there. She could tell nothing about the
creature's body. Its outline seemed to waver and alter subtly even
as she looked at it; yet its substance was apparently solid enough.
There was nothing misty or ghostly about it.</p>

<p>As it came toward her, she could not tell whether it walked,
wriggled, flew or crept. Its method of locomotion was absolutely
beyond her comprehension. When it had emerged from the shadows she
was still uncertain as to its nature. The light from the radium gem
did not illumine it as it would have illumined an ordinary
creature. Impossible as it seemed, the being seemed almost
impervious to the light. Its details were still obscure and
indistinct, even when it halted so near that it almost touched her
shrinking flesh. Only the blinking toad-like face stood out with
any distinctness. The thing was a blur in the sight, a black blot
of shadow that normal radiance would neither dissipate nor
illuminate.</p>

<p>She decided she was mad, because she could not tell whether the
being looked up at her or towered above her. She was unable to say
whether the dim repulsive face blinked up at her from the shadows
at her feet, or looked down at her from an immense height. But if
her sight convinced her that whatever its mutable qualities, it was
yet composed of solid substance, her sense of feel further assured
her of that fact. A dark tentacle-like member slid about her body,
and she screamed at the touch of it on her naked flesh. It was
neither warm nor cold, rough nor smooth; it was like nothing that
had ever touched her before, and at its caress she knew such fear
and shame as she had never dreamed of. All the obscenity and
salacious infamy spawned in the muck of the abysmal pits of Life
seemed to drown her in seas of cosmic filth. And in that instant
she knew that whatever form of life this thing represented it was
not a beast.</p>

<p>She began to scream uncontrollably; the monster tugged at her as
if to tear her from the ring by sheer brutality; then something
crashed above their heads, and a form hurtled down through the air
to strike the stone floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3">3</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Conan wheeled to see the tapestry settling
back in place and to hear Natala's muffled cry, he hurled himself
against the wall with a maddened roar. Rebounding from the impact
that would have splintered the bones of a lesser man, he ripped
away the tapestry revealing what appeared to be a blank wall.
Beside himself with fury he lifted his saber as though to hew
through the marble, when a sudden sound brought him about, eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>A score of figures faced him, yellow men in purple tunics, with
short swords in their hands. As he turned they surged in on him
with hostile cries. He made no attempt to conciliate them. Maddened
at the disappearance of his sweetheart, the barbarian reverted to
type.</p>

<p>A snarl of bloodthirsty gratification hummed in his bull-throat
as he leaped, and the first attacker, his short sword overreached
by the whistling saber, went down with his brains gushing from his
split skull. Wheeling like a cat, Conan caught a descending wrist
on his edge, and the hand gripping the short sword flew into the
air scattering a shower of red drops. But Conan had not paused or
hesitated. A pantherish twist and shift of his body avoided the
blundering rush of two yellow swordsmen, and the blade of one,
missing its objective, was sheathed in the breast of the other.</p>

<p>A yell of dismay went up at this mischance, and Conan allowed
himself a short bark of laughter as he bounded aside from a
whistling cut and slashed under the guard of yet another man of
Xuthal. A long spurt of crimson followed his singing edge and the
man crumpled screaming, his belly-muscles cut through.</p>

<p>The warriors of Xuthal howled like mad wolves. Unaccustomed to
battle, they were ridiculously slow and clumsy compared to the
tigerish barbarian whose motions were blurs of quickness possible
only to steel thews knit to a perfect fighting brain. They
floundered and stumbled, hindered by their own numbers; they struck
too quick or too soon, and cut only empty air. He was never
motionless or in the same place an instant; springing,
side-stepping, whirling, twisting, he offered a constantly shifting
target for their swords, while his own curved blade sang death
about their ears.</p>

<p>But whatever their faults, the men of Xuthal did not lack
courage. They swarmed about him yelling and hacking, and through
the arched doorways rushed others, awakened from their slumbers by
the unwonted clamor.</p>

<p>Conan, bleeding from a cut on the temple, cleared a space for an
instant with a devastating sweep of his dripping saber, and cast a
quick glance about for an avenue of escape. At that instant he saw
the tapestry on one of the walls drawn aside, disclosing a narrow
stairway. On this stood a man in rich robes, vague-eyed and
blinking, as if he had just awakened and had not yet shaken the
dusts of slumber from his brain. Conan's sight and action were
simultaneous.</p>

<p>A tigerish leap carried him untouched through the hemming ring
of swords, and he bounded toward the stair with the pack giving
tongue behind him. Three men confronted him at the foot of the
marble steps, and he struck them with a deafening crash of steel.
There was a frenzied instant when the blades flamed like summer
lightning; then the group fell apart and Conan sprang up the stair.
The oncoming horde tripped over three writhing forms at its foot:
one lay face- down in a sickening welter of blood and brains;
another propped himself on his hands, blood spurting blackly from
his severed throat veins; the other howled like a dying dog as he
clawed at the crimson stump that had been an arm.</p>

<p>As Conan rushed up the marble stair, the man above shook himself
from his stupor and drew a sword that sparkled frostily in the
radium light. He thrust downward as the barbarian surged upon him.
But as the point sang toward his throat, Conan ducked deeply. The
blade slit the skin of his back, and Conan straightened, driving
his saber upward as a man might wield a butcher-knife, with all the
power of his mighty shoulders.</p>

<p>So terrific was his headlong drive that the sinking of the saber
to the hilt into the belly of his enemy did not check him. He
caromed against the wretch's body, knocking it sideways. The impact
sent Conan crashing against the wall; the other, the saber torn
through his body, fell headlong down the stair, ripped open to the
spine from groin to broken breastbone. In a ghastly mess of
streaming entrails the body tumbled against the men rushing up the
stairs, bearing them back with it.</p>

<p><br>
HALF stunned, Conan leaned against the wall an instant, glaring
down upon them; then with a defiant shake of his dripping saber, he
bounded up the steps.</p>

<p>Coming into an upper chamber, he halted only long enough to see
that it was empty. Behind him the horde was yelling with such
intensified horror and rage, that he knew he had killed some
notable man there on the stair, probably the king of that fantastic
city.</p>

<p>He ran at random, without plan. He desperately wished to find
and succor Natala, who he was sure needed aid badly; but harried as
he was by all the warriors in Xuthal, he could only run on,
trusting to luck to elude them and find her. Among those dark or
dimly lighted upper chambers he quickly lost all sense of
direction, and it was not strange that he eventually blundered into
a chamber into which his foes were just pouring.</p>

<p>They yelled vengefully and rushed for him, and with a snarl of
disgust he turned and fled back the way he had come. At least he
thought it was the way he had come. But presently, racing into a
particularly ornate chamber, he was aware of his mistake. All the
chambers he had traversed since mounting the stair had been empty.
This chamber had an occupant, who rose up with a cry as he charged
in.</p>

<p>Conan saw a yellow-skinned woman, loaded with jeweled ornaments
but otherwise nude, staring at him with wide eyes. So much he
glimpsed as she raised her hand and jerked a silken rope hanging
from the wall. Then the floor dropped from under him, and all his
steel-trap coordination could not save him from the plunge into the
black depths that opened beneath him.</p>

<p>He did not fall any great distance, though it was far enough to
have snapped the leg bones of a man not built of steel springs and
whalebone.</p>

<p>He hit cat-like on his feet and one hand, instinctively
retaining his grasp on his saber hilt. A familiar cry rang in his
ears as he rebounded on his feet as a lynx rebounds with snarling
bared fangs. So Conan, glaring from under his tousled mane, saw the
white naked figure of Natala writhing in the lustful grasp of a
black nightmare shape that could have only been bred in the lost
pits of hell.</p>

<p>The sight of that awful shape alone might have frozen the
Cimmerian with fear. In juxtaposition to his girl, the sight sent a
red wave of murderous fury through Conan's brain. In a crimson mist
he smote the monster.</p>

<p>It dropped the girl, wheeling toward its attacker, and the
maddened Cimmerian's saber, shrilling through the air, sheared
clear through the black viscous bulk and rang on the stone floor,
showering blue sparks. Conan went to his knees from the fury of the
blow; the edge had not encountered the resistance he had expected.
As he bounded up, the thing was upon him.</p>

<p><br>
IT towered above him like a clinging black cloud. It seemed to
flow about him in almost liquid waves, to envelop and engulf him.
His madly slashing saber sheared through it again and again, his
ripping poniard tore and rent it; he was deluged with a slimy
liquid that must have been its sluggish blood. Yet its fury was
nowise abated.</p>

<p>He could not tell whether he was slashing off its members or
whether he was cleaving its bulk, which knit behind the slicing
blade. He was tossed to and fro in the violence of that awful
battle, and had a dazed feeling that he was fighting not one, but
an aggregation of lethal creatures. The thing seemed to be biting,
clawing, crushing and clubbing him all at the same time. He felt
fangs and talons rend his flesh; flabby cables that were yet hard
as iron encircled his limbs and body, and worse than all, something
like a whip of scorpions fell again and again across his shoulders,
back and breast, tearing the skin and filling his veins with a
poison that was like liquid fire.</p>

<p>They had rolled beyond the circle of light, and it was in utter
blackness that the Cimmerian battled. Once he sank his teeth,
beast-like, into the flabby substance of his foe, revolting as the
stuff writhed and squirmed like living rubber from between his iron
jaws.</p>

<p>In that hurricane of battle they were rolling over and over,
farther and farther down the tunnel. Conan's brain reeled with the
punishment he was taking. His breath came in whistling gasps
between his teeth. High above him he saw a great toad-like face,
dimly limned in an eery glow that seemed to emanate from it. And
with a panting cry that was half curse, half gasp of straining
agony, he lunged toward it, thrusting with all his waning power.
Hilt-deep the saber sank, somewhere below the grisly face, and a
convulsive shudder heaved the vast bulk that half enveloped the
Cimmerian. With a volcanic burst of contraction and expansion, it
tumbled backward, rolling now with frantic haste down the corridor.
Conan went with it, bruised, battered, invincible, hanging on like
a bulldog to the hilt of his saber which he could not withdraw,
tearing and ripping at the shuddering bulk with the poniard in his
left hand, goring it to ribbons.</p>

<p>The thing glowed all over now with a weird phosphorous radiance,
and this glow was in Conan's eyes, blinding him, as suddenly the
heaving billowing mass fell away from beneath him, the saber
tearing loose and remaining in his locked hand. This hand and arm
hung down into space, and far below him the glowing body of the
monster was rushing downward like a meteor. Conan dazedly realized
that he lay on the brink of a great round well, the edge of which
was slimy stone. He lay there watching the hurtling glow dwindling
and dwindling until it vanished into a dark shining surface that
seemed to surge upward to meet it. For an instant a dimming
witchfire glimmered in those dusky depths; then it disappeared and
Conan lay staring down into the blackness of the ultimate abyss
from which no sound came.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4">4</a></h2>

<p class="first">STRAINING vainly at the silk cords which cut into
her wrists, Natala sought to pierce the darkness beyond the radiant
circle. Her tongue seemed frozen to the roof of her mouth. Into
that blackness she had seen Conan vanish, locked in mortal combat
with the unknown demon, and the only sounds that had come to her
straining ears had been the panting gasps of the barbarian, the
impact of struggling bodies, and the thud and rip of savage blows.
These ceased, and Natala swayed dizzily on her cords, half
fainting.</p>

<p>A footstep roused her out of her apathy of horror, to see Conan
emerging from the darkness. At the sight she found her voice in a
shriek which echoed down the vaulted tunnel. The manhandling the
Cimmerian had received was appalling to behold. At every step he
dripped blood. His face was skinned and bruised as if he had been
beaten with a bludgeon. His lips were pulped, and blood oozed down
his face from a wound in his scalp. There were deep gashes in his
thighs, calves and forearms, and great bruises showed on his limbs
and body from impacts against the stone floor. But his shoulders,
back and upper-breast muscles had suffered most. The flesh was
bruised, swollen and lacerated, the skin hanging in loose strips,
as if he had been lashed with wire whips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan!" she sobbed. "What has happened to you?"</p>

<p>He had no breath for conversation, but his smashed lips writhed
in what might have been grim humor as he approached her. His hairy
breast, glistening with sweat and blood, heaved with his panting.
Slowly and laboriously he reached up and cut her cords, then fell
back against the wall and leaned there, his trembling legs braced
wide. She scrambled up from where she had fallen and caught him in
a frenzied embrace, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>"Oh, Conan, you are wounded unto death! Oh, what shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"Well," he panted, "you can't fight a devil out of hell and come
off with a whole skin!"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" she whispered. "Did you kill it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It fell into a pit. It was hanging in bloody
shreds, but whether it can be killed by steel I know not."</p>

<p>"Oh, your poor back!" she wailed, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"It lashed me with a tentacle," he grimaced, swearing as he
moved. "It cut like wire and burned like poison. But it was its
damnable squeezing that got my wind. It was worse than a python. If
half my guts are not mashed out of place, I'm much mistaken."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" she whimpered.</p>

<p>He glanced up. The trap was closed. No sound came from
above.</p>

<p>"We can't go back through the secret door," he muttered. "That
room is full of dead men, and doubtless warriors keep watch there.
They must have thought my doom sealed when I plunged through the
floor above, or else they dare not follow me into this
tunnel.&mdash;Twist that radium gem off the wall.&mdash;As I groped
my way back up the corridor I felt arches opening into other
tunnels. We'll follow the first we come to. It may lead to another
pit, or to the open air. We must chance it. We can't stay here and
rot."</p>

<p>Natala obeyed, and holding the tiny point of light in his left
hand and his bloody saber in his right, Conan started down the
corridor. He went slowly, stiffly, only his animal vitality keeping
him on his feet. There was a blank glare in his bloodshot eyes, and
Natala saw him involuntarily lick his battered lips from time to
time. She knew his suffering was ghastly, but with the stoicism of
the wilds he made no complaint.</p>

<p>Presently the dim light shone on a black arch, and into this
Conan turned. Natala cringed at what she might see, but the light
revealed only a tunnel similar to that they had just left.</p>

<p><br>
HOW far they went she had no idea, before they mounted a long
stair and came upon a stone door, fastened with a golden bolt.</p>

<p>She hesitated, glancing at Conan. The barbarian was swaying on
his feet, the light in his unsteady hand flinging fantastic shadows
back and forth along the wall.</p>

<p>"Open the door, girl," he muttered thickly. "The men of Xuthal
will be waiting for us, and I would not disappoint them. By Crom,
the city has not seen such a sacrifice as I will make!"</p>

<p>She knew he was half delirious. No sound came from beyond the
door. Taking the radium gem from his blood-stained hand, she threw
the bolt and drew the panel inward. The inner side of a
cloth-of-gold tapestry met her gaze and she drew it aside and
peeked through, her heart in her mouth. She was looking into an
empty chamber in the center of which a silvery fountain
tinkled.</p>

<p>Conan's hand fell heavily on her naked shoulder.</p>

<p>"Stand aside, girl," he mumbled. "Now is the feasting of
swords."</p>

<p>"There is no one in the chamber," she answered. "But there is
water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hear it," he licked his blackened lips. "We will drink before
we die."</p>

<p>He seemed blinded. She took his darkly stained hand and led him
through the stone door. She went on tiptoe, expecting a rush of
yellow figures through the arches at any instant.</p>

<p>"Drink while I keep watch," he muttered.</p>

<p>"No, I am not thirsty. Lie down beside the fountain and I will
bathe your wounds."</p>

<p>"What of the swords of Xuthal?" He continually raked his arm
across his eyes as if to clear his blurred sight.</p>

<p>"I hear no one. All is silent."</p>

<p>He sank down gropingly and plunged his face into the crystal
jet, drinking as if he could not get enough. When he raised his
head there was sanity in his bloodshot eyes and he stretched his
massive limbs out on the marble floor as she requested, though he
kept his saber in his hand, and his eyes continually roved toward
the archways. She bathed his torn flesh and bandaged the deeper
wounds with strips torn from a silk hanging. She shuddered at the
appearance of his back; the flesh was discolored, mottled and
spotted black and blue and a sickly yellow, where it was not raw.
As she worked she sought frantically for a solution to their
problem. If they stayed where they were, they would eventually be
discovered. Whether the men of Xuthal were searching the palaces
for them, or had returned to their dreams, she could not know.</p>

<p>As she finished her task, she froze. Under the hanging that
partly concealed an alcove, she saw a hand's breadth of yellow
flesh.</p>

<p>Saying nothing to Conan, she rose and crossed the chamber
softly, grasping his poniard. Her heart pounded suffocatingly as
she cautiously drew aside the hanging. On the dais lay a young
yellow woman, naked and apparently lifeless. At her hand stood a
jade jar nearly full of peculiar golden-colored liquid. Natala
believed it to be the elixir described by Thalis, which lent vigor
and vitality to the degenerate Xuthal. She leaned across the supine
form and grasped the vessel, her poniard poised over the girl's
bosom. The latter did not wake.</p>

<p>With the jar in her possession, Natala hesitated, realizing it
would be the safer course to put the sleeping girl beyond the power
of waking and raising an alarm. But she could not bring herself to
plunge the Cimmerian's poniard into that still bosom, and at last
she drew back the hanging and returned to Conan, who lay where she
had left him, seemingly only partly conscious.</p>

<p>She bent and placed the jar to his lips. He drank, mechanically
at first, then with a suddenly roused interest. To her amazement he
sat up and took the vessel from her hands. When he lifted his face,
his eyes were clear and normal. Much of the drawn haggard look had
gone from his features, and his voice was not the mumble of
delirium.</p>

<p>"Crom! Where did you get this?"</p>

<p>She pointed. "From that alcove, where a yellow hussy is
sleeping."</p>

<p>He thrust his muzzle again into the golden liquid.</p>

<p>"By Crom," he said with a deep sigh, "I feel new life and power
rush like wildfire through my veins. Surely this is the very elixir
of Life!"</p>

<p>"We had best go back into the corridor," Natala ventured
nervously. "We shall be discovered if we stay here long. We can
hide there until your wounds heal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not I," he grunted. "We are not rats, to hide in dark burrows.
We leave this devil-city now, and let none seek to stop us."</p>

<p>"But your wounds!" she wailed.</p>

<p>"I do not feel them," he answered. "It may be a false strength
this liquor has given me, but I swear I am aware of neither pain
nor weakness."</p>

<p>With sudden purpose he crossed the chamber to a window she had
not noticed. Over his shoulder she looked out. A cool breeze tossed
her tousled locks. Above was the dark velvet sky, clustered with
stars. Below them stretched a vague expanse of sand.</p>

<p>"Thalis said the city was one great palace," said Conan.
"Evidently some of the chambers are built like towers on the wall.
This one is. Chance has led us well."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, glancing apprehensively over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"There is a crystal jar on that ivory table," he answered. "Fill
it with water and tie a strip of that torn hanging about its neck
for a handle while I rip up this tapestry."</p>

<p><br>
SHE obeyed without question, and when she turned from her task
she saw Conan rapidly tying together the long tough strips of silk
to make a rope, one end of which he fastened to the leg of the
massive ivory table.</p>

<p>"We'll take our chance with the desert," said he. "Thalis spoke
of an oasis a day's march to the south, and grasslands beyond that.
If we reach the oasis we can rest until my wounds heal. This wine
is like sorcery. A little while ago I was little more than a dead
man; now I am ready for anything. Here is enough silk left for you
to make a garment of."</p>

<p>Natala had forgotten her nudity. The mere fact caused her no
qualms, but her delicate skin would need protection from the desert
sun. As she knotted the silk length about her supple body, Conan
turned to the window and with a contemptuous wrench tore away the
soft gold bars that guarded it. Then, looping the loose end of his
silk rope about Natala's hips, and cautioning her to hold on with
both hands, he lifted her through the window and lowered her the
thirty- odd feet to the earth. She stepped out of the loop, and
drawing it back up, he made fast the vessels of water and wine, and
lowered them to her. He followed them, sliding down swiftly, hand
over hand.</p>

<p>As he reached her side, Natala gave a sigh of relief. They stood
alone at the foot of the great wall, the paling stars overhead and
the naked desert about them. What perils yet confronted them she
could not know, but her heart sang with joy because they were out
of that ghostly, unreal city.</p>

<p>"They may find the rope," grunted Conan, slinging the precious
jars across his shoulders, wincing at the contact with his mangled
flesh. "They may even pursue us, but from what Thalis said, I doubt
it. That way is south," a bronze muscular arm indicated their
course; "so somewhere in that direction lies the oasis. Come!"</p>

<p>Taking her hand with a thoughtfulness unusual for him, Conan
strode out across the sands, suiting his stride to the shorter legs
of his companion. He did not glance back at the silent city,
brooding dreamily and ghostily behind them.</p>

<p>"Conan," Natala ventured finally, "when you fought the monster,
and later, as you came up the corridor, did you see anything
of&mdash;of Thalis?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It was dark in the corridor; but it was
empty."</p>

<p>She shuddered. "She tortured me&mdash;yet I pity her."</p>

<p>"It was a hot welcome we got in that accursed city," he snarled.
Then his grim humor returned. "Well, they'll remember our visit
long enough, I'll wager. There are brains and guts and blood to be
cleaned off the marble tiles, and if their god still lives, he
carries more wounds than I. We got off light, after all: we have
wine and water and a good chance of reaching a habitable country,
though I look as if I've gone through a meatgrinder, and you have a
sore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all your fault," she interrupted. "If you had not looked
so long and admiringly at that Stygian cat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Crom and his devils!" he swore. "When the oceans drown the
world, women will take time for jealousy. Devil take their conceit!
Did I tell the Stygian to fall in love with me? After all, she was
only human!"</p>
