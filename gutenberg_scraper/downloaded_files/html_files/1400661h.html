  <p class="note">Superintendent Minter of the London Metropolitan Police,
  known by the nickname "Sooper", is the protagonist of several works that
  Edgar Wallace published in the 1920's. These include the novel <i>Big
  Foot</i> (1927) and the collection <i>The Lone House Mystery and Other
  Stories</i> (1929). Several short stories featuring the "Sooper" appeared in
  magazines in 1925 but were not collected during the author's lifetime. These
  include "The Get-Back," "The House of the Candles," and "The Little Dragon of
  Jade," all of which are available at Roy Glashan's Library and Project

  <p class="first">THE cleverest thing about a crook is the policeman who is
  following him, and even he wouldn't be asked to take the chair at a lecture
  on human intelligence.</p>

  <p>When I was a young officer I got all the psych&mdash;what's the word?
  Psychology, that's it&mdash;of the criminal mind from a man I pinched for
  bag-snatching.</p>

  <p>'I don't mind going inside. Sergeant,' he said: 'it gives me time to
  think.'</p>

  <p>'And what do you think about, you poor nut?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>'New ways of snatching bags,' he said.</p>

  <p>Jail is hell to people who are never likely to go there; and it's pretty
  bad for folks who hoped they wouldn't go there; but for the birds who've got
  to know every rose in the warden's garden and have their particular taste in
  cells, it is a home from home. After all, there are hundreds of men and women
  who live in prisons all their lives without knowing it. The hooter brings
  them out of their cells, and they march off to the workshop, where they do
  their hard labour; when that is over, they march back to their cells and go
  to sleep. They may walk round to the pictures and maybe they see a football
  match, but the big things of life are eating and sleeping and paying the rent
  and worrying about the interest on the mortgage or the instalment that's due
  on the new motorbike. In prison you get everything except worry.</p>

  <p>Thieving, like poetry and red hair, runs in families. Nobody knows why
  decent parents should rear crooks and murderers&mdash;it's one of the
  inscru&mdash; whatever the word is, acts of nature. There were three brothers
  named Larsen; they were all well brought up, they were all clever, and they
  all went to jail.</p>

  <p>When young Harry Larsen and his brother Joe came out of Wandsworth after a
  nine months' sentence. I went down to meet 'em. They were nice boys, but they
  suffered from illusions. Illusion Number One was that there was a way of
  getting a lot of money all at once without working for it. It is the illusion
  that makes people play the races and buy oil plots and thieve.</p>

  <p>Illusion Number Two was that, in spite of all previous troubles, they
  would succeed next time and get away with enough money to live happy ever
  after in some country where the extradition law didn't operate.</p>

  <p>I liked the boys; I had sent them down twice, but I liked 'em because they
  were clever and bore no malice&mdash;at least, not towards me.</p>

  <p>Now, my idea and object in turning myself into a Prison Gate Helpers
  League was to discover whether they bore any malice against Edward Lasthall.
  Personally, if I had been one of the two Larsen boys, I should have taken a
  gun and filled Mr Edward Lasthall full of nickel projectiles. I am speaking
  now as a born savage with a normal human being's natural drift towards
  homicide. Because nothing short of death and destruction was good enough for
  Ed Lasthall&mdash;from every point of view except mine, as a Superintendent
  of Police, and perhaps a judge and jury.</p>

  <p>There have been some beautiful words in the English language that have
  been degraded by misuse, but you couldn't call Ed mean without glorifyin' the
  expression and putting it up amongst the high-flown compliments. He was a
  money-lender, and a pretty rich man, and he banked with the Nethersole
  Company, one of the few private banks in London. I happen to know this
  because, when little Pat Larsen was arrested for forging and uttering a
  cheque for eighty pounds, I had charge of the case. Pat was in Ed's office:
  he got the job himself, the boys keeping well in the background because they
  wanted the kid to go straight and to start fair without being handicapped, as
  he would have been if Ed Lasthall knew that his brothers were on the
  register.</p>

  <p>Ed had his office at Notting Hill Gate, and he did a few things that
  weren't legitimate money-lending. He was the biggest diamond fence in London.
  If you were on the crook, and you snatched a tiara or a necklace, and you
  took the trouble to take the stones out of their setting, you could plant
  them with Ed and get about a hundredth part of their value. We raided his
  office once or twice, following in a well-known thief, but we never caught
  him with the goods.</p>

  <p>It isn't necessary to explain that we never actually raided <i>him</i>,
  and that we always pretended it was his client we were after, but it amounted
  to the same thing.</p>

  <p>I did not find out till a long time after how he got rid of the sparklers.
  His offices were on the third floor, and consisted of two rooms. On the
  second floor was a little office which had the name 'William Stott and
  Sons&mdash;Furriers' painted on the glass panel. That office was his, and his
  long-nosed sister used to sit there all the time he was upstairs, facing the
  door. At the first sign of danger&mdash;and she knew every C.I.D. man in the
  division by sight&mdash;she sounded a buzzer.</p>

  <p>By the side of Ed's desk was a speaking tube. If the warning came when he
  was handling stones, he dropped them one by one down the tube, and they fell
  into a wool-lined box in Sarah's office. Simple? I should say it was. Only I
  used to think that the speaking-tube went through to his clerk in the room
  next door, and I didn't know Sarah was his dear relative until after the
  trouble. He got rid of his clerk, and that is when Pat saw the advertisement
  and answered it.</p>

  <p>Pat was caught so simply that it doesn't seem true. An American crook
  named Wilson robbed a suite at the Green Park Hotel, and got away with eight
  hundred pounds and two diamond rings. If he hadn't been greedy he wouldn't
  have been pinched, but he wasn't satisfied with the money; he had two
  beautiful stones, and down he went to Ed's office. It was after banking
  hours, and Ed had run short of money. Would Wilson take a cheque? Wilson
  didn't want to very much, but he had got nervous about carrying the stones
  around, and Ed wrote him a 'pay bearer' cheque and Wilson went out. Now it
  happened that we had received an 'all stations' warning about the robbery and
  a description of the wanted man. It was an act of lunacy on the part of
  Wilson to stay in London after he'd made his bust, but, as I've said before,
  if a man could think straight he wouldn't act crooked.</p>

  <p>As the American left the office Sergeant Brett, who had spotted him going
  in, walked over and tapped him.</p>

  <p>'Come for a walk, Wilson&mdash;my chief wants to see you about your
  registration papers.'</p>

  <p>Wilson knew all that stuff about 'registration papers,' and took a quick
  decision. When he saw Brett's two men close on him, he took another and went
  quietly. When they got him to the station and 'ran him down,' they found most
  of the money and the cheque in his pockets.</p>

  <p>I went personally to Ed's office, and I had only to look at his face to
  know that he saw his number and landing. But he pulled a bluff.</p>

  <p>'I never gave that cheque or signed it,' he said; and here was the curious
  thing. The cheque hadn't been torn from his current book. It was one he had
  been carrying around in his pocket for months (that is my theory; I've never
  been able to prove it).</p>

  <p>'I didn't see this man Jones' (Wilson's name on the cheque). 'My clerk
  interviewed him.'</p>

  <p>I noticed that he was talking very loudly, and I thought that it was for
  the benefit of the clerk in the next room. Sarah wasn't known to me then, and
  how should I know that she was listening at the door?</p>

  <p>'I want to search your office, Lasthall,' I said, 'and maybe I shall ask
  you to come along to the station to see this man Wilson.'</p>

  <p>Now in this country you cannot search an office without a warrant signed
  by a magistrate, but I figured that he would not dare refuse.</p>

  <p>'You can do as you blame please,' he said. 'My own opinion is that my
  clerk knows more about this than I do. I've seen him imitating my
  signature.'</p>

  <p>He was still talking loudly, and this puzzled me. It wasn't likely that
  his clerk would take any blame that was coming. After I had turned over his
  room, we went into the outer office, but nobody was there. The boy had gone
  home, it appears, and we made our examination without his help. In the top
  right drawer we found the two stones, and on the blotting-pad, written three
  or four times, the words. 'Edward Lasthall,' and they were pretty good
  imitations of Ed's signature.</p>

  <p>Sarah was a quick and a bold worker. How bold she was you can gather, for
  she gave evidence not only before the magistrate, but before the judge, that
  she had seen the boy and Wilson in conversation on the landing, and noticed
  Pat Larsen take something from the man. Wilson didn't squeal, naturally. Ed
  was a very useful man in many ways. By some pull he had got himself made a
  Justice of the Peace for Middlesex, and used to sit on the bench and try
  poachers! And a J.P. can sign passports and do a whole lot of things that can
  help a man considerably.</p>

  <p>Pat was sent down for eighteen months&mdash;he was under twenty, and had
  never done a crooked thing in his life. That was the cruel part of it: I knew
  that he was innocent, but could say no word to save him, especially after it
  was known that he was a Larsen and that two of his brothers were
  'inside.'</p>

  <p>And that is just why I went down to Wandsworth to do rescue work. For one
  thing, I wanted to rescue Ed Lasthall from his evil surroundings and put him
  in a nice moral jail.</p>

  <p>As nine o'clock struck, the two boys came out through the little
  wicket-gate in their crumpled suits. They saw me at once, and came over
  towards me.</p>

  <p>'What's the idea, Sooper?' asked Joe. 'You've got nothing on us.'</p>

  <p>They thought it was a prison-gate arrest. We sometimes take a man as he
  comes out of jail for some offence he committed before he went in.</p>

  <p>'Nothing at all, boys.' I said in a hurry. 'Only I thought I'd come along
  and see if there was anything I could do for you.'</p>

  <p>Harry smiled lopsidedly and jerked his thumb at the prison door.</p>

  <p>'You can walk in there and bring out Pat,' he said. 'You put him
  there.'</p>

  <p>'Aw, listen,' said Joe, with a grin, 'what's the sense of bluffin',
  Sooper? You know who put Pat away. And, Sooper, we are going to make Ed
  Lasthall be very, very sorry for himself!'</p>

  <p>Harry nodded.</p>

  <p>'And when we've skinned him, we're going abroad to live on the hide,' he
  said. 'And Pat's joining us. We've given him the town and the place and the
  best way of getting there.'</p>

  <p>Personally. I take very little notice of threats when they are made at the
  right end of a sentence&mdash;which is the beginning. It doesn't worry me any
  when the man I've sent down turns as he leaves the dock and tells me what is
  going to happen to my face when he leaves jail. That is natural. After his
  time's up. he usually comes along to see me and apologize. But to be
  threatened after a sentence is through&mdash;that is different.</p>

  <p>'Skin him if you can, Harry.' I said. 'But there are eighteen thousand
  policemen in London whose job it is to see that you don't get away with the
  pelt.'</p>

  <p>And then I began to talk to them about Ed. I thought that, being sore,
  they would squeal a little. You see, I happened to know that Pat was the
  apple of their eyes, and that, if I got to them quick enough, they would
  spill everything in the basin. But I was wrong.</p>

  <p>'It's no use trying to smoodge us, Sooper,' said Joe, shaking his head.
  'We've never had any dealings with this man Lasthall. He doesn't know us, and
  we don't know him. But we're going to get better acquainted. Even Pat wasn't
  aware that he was a fence, though everybody else in town seems to have known
  it.</p>

  <p>I had my little car on the spot, and drove them to a coffee-shop in
  Wandsworth, where we had breakfast together. We talked about old friends
  inside and out, but all the time the Larsen boys were on their guard, and I
  got nothing out of them that I could put into an autobiography, if I ever
  wrote one. The food was better in Wandsworth than Pentonville; Hawkey, the
  coiner, was in charge of the library, and the 'screws' were more reasonable.
  In thieves' slang 'screw' means 'to look.' and warders and guards are called
  by that name because they look through the peepholes into the cells. They
  told me, before I left, that they were going to stay with relations at
  Lewisham, but that meant nothing.</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, I warn a man who has been threatened at the wrong end of a
  sentence, but Ed was my lawful prey, and I was looking forward to the day
  when I should put him in the steel pen and read over a charge to him. And
  those kind of birds you don't warn.</p>

  <p>When I saw him a few days after, he was coming out of Nethersole's Bank
  looking as black as thunder. His face changed a little when he saw me, but he
  was too mad to hide his feelings.</p>

  <p>'Morning. Sooper&mdash;what's the matter with that bank? I've been a
  client for twelve years, and they treat me like a dog!'</p>

  <p>'What's the trouble?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>It appeared that he had been negotiating for the purchase of a big block
  of flats in Baker Street. He bought and sold property as a side-line, and
  always at a profit, but this was one of his biggest deals.</p>

  <p>'I've never had less than thirty-five thousand pounds in my current
  account,' he said, 'and they know that I'm as solid at Rothschilds, and yet
  when I ask them for a twenty-thousand loan to finish this deal they treat me
  as if I were a thief. And I only want the money for three days and can lodge
  the deeds against the loan!'</p>

  <p>The sum he had to find was seventy thousand, which meant that his fluid
  account was somewhere in the neighbourhood of fifty thousand pounds. That is
  pretty big money in loose cash, and no business man would keep as much in his
  current account; but I have in my mind the idea that Ed expected a day would
  come when he would have to jump for safety&mdash;and jump quick.</p>

  <p>That's deduction, or maybe guesswork, or possibly good police work, for we
  had made a few discoveries about Ed Lasthall. Number One was his relationship
  with Sarah. Number Two was a seagoing motorboat that he kept in the estuary
  of the Thames.</p>

  <p>'1'11 change my bank,' he said. 'These old-fashioned private banks aren't
  safe, anyway.'</p>

  <p>Nobody knew better than Ed that Nethersole's was one of the toniest banks
  in London. All the big swells kept their private accounts with Nethersole's.
  and it was a good advertisement for Ed to be able to put 'Nethersole's Bank'
  on his notepaper.</p>

  <p>I don't suppose that he was seriously inconvenienced, because he had money
  on discount at the Credit Lyonnais. Anyway. I heard that the deal had gone
  through.</p>

  <p>I had Sergeant Brett into my office the day after I met Lasthall.</p>

  <p>'Watch out for the Larsen boys.' I told him, for my job was to keep the
  police end of the business in good shape and order. Brett had to know what
  the trouble was, and when I explained he seemed amused.</p>

  <p>'Thieves big and little have been trying to get money out of Ed ever since
  I've been in this division. Before he died, poor old Looey busted his house
  in Colville Gardens, and got nothing out of it but nine months' hard labour.
  The Larsen boys will have to improve on their style to have any hope of
  catching Lasthall.'</p>

  <p>I don't know that I agreed with him. As I have said before, all criminals
  are fools, and for this reason: they never choose the right material. Their
  workmanship is fine, but in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they are in
  the position of carpenters working on steel. There never was a good
  watch-maker who could do much with a pick and a shovel, and the Larsen boys
  had worked some of their cleverest gags on people with as much imagination as
  the average cow, and naturally they had come unstuck.</p>

  <p>The boys were kind of superior confidence-men, and they had got into
  trouble because they had operated on brokers and businessmen instead of on
  poets, parsons and ad writers. I've studied their methods very carefully, and
  I'm bound to admit that their graft was the cleverest that has ever come
  under my notice. But they had failed because they were aiming at the wrong
  target.</p>

  <p>For a swindle to succeed it is necessary that everybody concerned,
  including the poor pigeon, should have the minds of swindlers. No con man has
  ever made money except out of the potentially dishonest. I think
  'potentially' is the right word, but if it isn't you'll know what I mean.</p>

  <p>I saw nothing of the boys, nor did Brett, and it looked as though the
  Larsens had gone honest. There was no mention of them, either in
  confidentials or in the <i>Hue-and-Cry</i>. and although I read the
  newspapers carefully, I could find no record of a City merchant buying blocks
  of shares in North African gold mines or oil concessions in Bessarabia.</p>

  <p>The two boys had a little money put by (Joe was the saver of the family),
  and there was just a chance that they had decided to quit and had found work
  that hadn't got a come-back. But I was wrong, I got the story afterwards from
  Ed, and it wasn't an easy story to get, because every few sentences he either
  knocked his head against the wall or stopped to remark what he'd do to the
  Larsens if he ever laid his hands on them. And when he wasn't doing that he
  was praying that the Lord would do something vicious to Joe and Harry at that
  very minute. I never knew Ed had any religion in his system until then, but
  apparently he was rather strong for prayer.</p>

  <p>About the middle of April he had a letter from a man called Weiss, asking
  him on what terms he'd loan him a thousand pounds. Ed did a lot of
  advertising and had a pretty large connexion. He sent Mr Weiss the usual
  inquiry form; you know the kind of thing I mean&mdash;kindly state age,
  colour of eyes, where born, how often bankrupt&mdash;and in reply he had a
  strange letter, which I have seen:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I need hardly tell you that I have not
  given you my own name. I am in terrible trouble, not on my own account but on
  account of my brother. I am still hoping that the blow may be averted, and
  that it will not be necessary for me to come to you for money. How terrible
  it is that the sins of others should be visited upon the innocent! Your most
  kind and generous letter has touched me very deeply. I feel indeed that in
  you I have a good and loyal friend. I will write to you later when matters
  develop.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely, M. WEISS</p><br>

  <p>The letter was dated from an accommodation address in South London, and
  Ed's 'kind and generous letter' he wrote about was the usual brotherly hokum
  that Ed sent out to all prospective clients.</p>

  <p>Lasthall wasn't so much puzzled by the letter as I should have been. I
  guess he had a pretty curious correspondence; and being a professional
  moneylender, he knew that nobody borrows for themselves. They always want the
  money for a dear friend or for a husband or to help somebody else. They've
  either backed a bill for a near relation, or they've been the victims of
  other people's circumstances.</p>

  <p>Nothing further came, and Mr Weiss had gone out of Ed's memory until the
  third day of May, which was a Friday.</p>

  <p>Edward was sitting in his office reading a sporting paper. He was going
  away to Brighton that night to spend the weekend, and he was only waiting
  till Sarah brought up some letters for him to sign before he left the office.
  He had read through yesterday's racing and was wondering if any of his
  clients had been hit when his new clerk came in and said there was a young
  man who wanted to see him.</p>

  <p>'What is his name?'</p>

  <p>'Mr Weiss,' replied the girl: and then Ed remembered the mad letter he had
  had from him.</p>

  <p>'Shoot him in,' he said, and a second or two later Mr Weiss came in.</p>

  <p>Ed said he was a young and artistic looking man, and so far as I can
  understand, Ed got the notion that he was artistic because he wore no
  waistcoat, had a big black, flowing tie and longish hair. He seemed in a
  terrible state of agitation: his lips were trembling, and he couldn't keep
  still for a second. He was hardly in the chair where Lasthall politely asked
  him to sit than he was on his feet again, walking up and down the room.</p>

  <p>'Forgive me,' he said (Ed Lasthall repeated the conversation word for
  word: I guess it had burnt itself in pretty deeply). 'Forgive me, Mr
  Lasthall, but I hardly know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. This
  is dreadful&mdash;dreadful! I've guessed the truth all these months, yet the
  news has come as a blow to me. Oh, Johnny, Johnny, how could you!'</p>

  <p>He wrung his hands like a man in the last stages of despair.</p>

  <p>'Calm yourself, Mr Weiss,' said Ed. He had seen folk carry on in that way
  before, but it was usually after a loan came due.</p>

  <p>'My name isn't Weiss,' the young man replied, 'I am Arthur Jorlton.'</p>

  <p>Now Ed had no knowledge of art or poetry, but there was a dim idea at the
  back of his mind that he had either seen the name in the paper or had heard
  of it before.</p>

  <p>'I am Arthur Jorlton,' said the young man rather impatiently. 'You must
  know my work? I have a play at the Everywoman's Theatre.'</p>

  <p>And then Ed remembered. It was one of those highbrow plays that the
  critics like but the public won't pay to see, all about souls and the rights
  of women to do as they darned well please, and Ed, who was strong for girl
  and music shows, had enough knowledge of the theatre to know that
  <i>Tombstones</i> (that was the name of the play) was an artistic success and
  was losing money.</p>

  <p>'Why, yes. Mr Jorlton. I know your work very well,' he said. That play of
  yours is one of the greatest we've ever had on the stage and shows that the
  British drama is coming back to its own.'</p>

  <p>He remembered this bit from a criticism he'd read.</p>

  <p>'Artistic success?' said Jorlton bitterly. 'And here am I on the very
  threshold of fame... and this has happened!'</p>

  <p>Ed waited to hear what 'this' was.</p>

  <p>'I have feared it,' said Mr Jorlton, throwing his arms about like an
  actor. 'I taxed him with it in March. I said, "John, I cannot understand how,
  on your salary, you can afford to keep this expensive flat and to play the
  races as you do." He told me that he was earning a lot of money by his
  literary work, and, like a fool, I believed him.'</p>

  <p>'And what has he done?' asked Ed very gently. He was beginning to get the
  hang of the situation.</p>

  <p>'What has he done?' Mr Jorlton turned round on him fiercely. 'He has not
  only ruined himself irretrievably, he has not only ruined me, but by his
  wicked folly he has dragged down thousands of innocent men and women to
  penury!'</p>

  <p>Ed looked at the clock: it was ten minutes past three, and he was due to
  catch the 3.40 for Brighton.</p>

  <p>'Now listen. Mr Jorlton. You come along and see me on Monday morning and
  we'll have a heart-to-heart talk&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'On Monday morning it will be too late,' said the young man, who became
  calm in an instant and, pulling up his chair to the other side of the desk,
  sat down. 'Mr Lasthall. I am not a businessman,' he said. 'You would hardly
  expect that in one of my temperament. I am a writer, a dreamer, a poet, if
  you will. Only the terrible force of necessity would have brought me to you,
  but I am encouraged by the humanity of your letter. I want to borrow three
  thousand pounds for a fortnight.'</p>

  <p>'Really!' said Ed politely. 'That's a very large sum. Mr Jorlton, and, of
  course, you have security?'</p>

  <p>Nobody who had ever been to borrow money from Ed had had security, and he
  nearly dropped off his chair when the man took out of his pocket a thick
  envelope and produced a bundle of War Loan scrip.</p>

  <p>'There is a thousand pounds' worth of War Loan here.' he said. 'But a
  thousand pounds is not enough, and although I know nothing of business I
  realize that it is foolish to ask you to accept a thousand pounds' worth of
  security for a loan of three thousand.'</p>

  <p>Ed looked at the scrip and then at Mr Jorlton.</p>

  <p>'It is certainly not a proposition that I could listen to.' he said. 'I'm
  willing to give you a thousand pound loan on the security of this
  stock&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>'That is not enough. Indeed, three thousand pounds is not enough, but it
  would stave off the ruin which I fear is inevitable. The auditors are making
  a very careful examination of the books, and I am afraid the bank suspect
  something is wrong.'</p>

  <p>'The bank?' said Ed quickly. 'Which bank is this?'</p>

  <p>But Mr Jorlton was not agreeable to telling that.</p>

  <p>'It is a private bank, that is all I can tell you.'</p>

  <p>'And your brother has been robbing it?' asked Ed. 'How much money has he
  taken?'</p>

  <p>Mr Jorlton sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>'I can't tell you exactly. It must be between a hundred and fifty thousand
  and two hundred thousand. Sufficient, I fear, unless the joint-stock banks
  come to their rescue, to ruin this unfortunate house.'</p>

  <p>He took a drink of water to steady himself.</p>

  <p>'It's Nethersole's Bank, isn't it?' he asked, and the young man looked at
  him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>'How did you know that?'</p>

  <p>'Never mind, but I knew it.' said Ed roughly, 'is it or is it not?'</p>

  <p>'It is,' said Mr Jorlton in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Ed sat back in his chair and did some quick thinking.</p>

  <p>'Have these defalcations been discovered?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Not yet,' said Mr Jorlton, 'but I fear&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Never mind what you fear. You say the auditors are in and the loss hasn't
  been discovered? How much money has your brother taken?'</p>

  <p>The young man pulled a small book from his pocket and turned the
  leaves.</p>

  <p>'He has a record of a hundred and sixty-one thousand pounds. It has been
  taken from the account of a very rich man named Buckler&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Ed knew Buckler: a retired wine merchant who lived in Ladbroke Grove. As I
  say, Ed was a quick thinker. Nethersole's principal branch was at Notting
  Hill, and the peculiarity of the bank was that it kept on the premises an
  enormous cash reserve.</p>

  <p>'Is your brother at the bank?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'No.' said the young man. 'He has absented himself today. I couldn't let
  him run the risk of arrest. He sent a message to say that he was sick. Now,
  Mr Lasthall, can you help me?'</p>

  <p>Ed looked at the clock again: it was twenty past three: the bank closed at
  half past.</p>

  <p>'Just wait here.' he said. 'I'll go along to my bank and get some money,
  and then I'll fix you.'</p>

  <p>He seized his cheque-book, dashed downstairs and hailed a taxi. He only
  had about five hundred yards to go, but time was precious, and three minutes
  later he walked into the bank and made his way to the desk of the old cashier
  who usually attended to him. There were two or three people waiting to cash
  cheques or pay in, and Ed got almost beside himself as the hands of the clock
  moved towards half past three. At last it came to his turn.</p>

  <p>'Good afternoon. Mr Lasthall.' said the old clerk, who was rather
  talkative. 'I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but we're rather short-handed
  just now. One of our clerks is away ill&mdash;a young man whom you may have
  remembered seeing. He's a brother of Jorlton, the playwright.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes,' said Ed. 'Very interesting. Will you tell me the amount of my
  balance?'</p>

  <p>'We can't tell you anything.' said the oldish boy. 'We've got the auditors
  in just now...'</p>

  <p>Ed waited, hardly daring to draw a breath. By and by the cashier came back
  and pushed a slip under the grille. £38,500 was the amount, and with shaking
  hands Ed drew a cheque. The cashier looked at it.</p>

  <p>'That nearly closes your account, Mr Lasthall.' he said.</p>

  <p>Ed muttered something about buying property, and the cashier went away. He
  was gone a long time, and Ed was beginning to feel hot under the collar when
  the old gentleman came back and, laying a bundle of notes on the counter,
  counted them slowly.</p>

  <p>The outer doors of the bank were closed by then, but that didn't matter to
  Ed Lasthall as he stuffed the money into his pocket with a feeling that he
  had been hauled into a boat after going down for the third time.</p>

  <p>The porter opened the door for him and he went out into the street and was
  turning towards Notting Hill Gate when somebody called to him peremptorily,
  and he turned to see a strange and official-looking young man.</p>

  <p>'Your name is Lasthall, isn't it? I'm Sergeant Jefferson from Scotland
  Yard. Will you come along and see Sooper? He wants to speak to you.'</p>

  <p>'Sooper?' said Ed in surprise. 'What does he want with me?'</p>

  <p>'They'll tell you that at the Yard.'</p>

  <p>'But he's not at the Yard&mdash;' began Ed.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to argue with you,' said Sergeant Jefferson shortly. 'If
  it's any news to you, you're under arrest!'</p>

  <p>Lasthall nearly dropped. I guess he'd been expecting a squeal from some of
  the stone stealers for a very long time.</p>

  <p>'Sooper has got nothing on me.' he said, 'and if you arrest me there's
  going to be bad trouble.'</p>

  <p>There was a car waiting, and at Jefferson's signal it pulled up by the
  side of the kerb, and Ed was pushed in.</p>

  <p>'There's no sense in getting up in the air about this,' said Jefferson.
  'The Yard is always making mistakes, and probably this is one. And, anyway,
  I'm only doing my duty.'</p>

  <p>This calmed Ed Lasthall, though he was a bit shaken, I imagine, and when
  Jefferson offered him his case he took a cigarette with a laugh.</p>

  <p>'There's trouble coming to those people at the Yard,' he boasted. 'I'm not
  the man to stand for this sort of thing.'</p>

  <p>'I'll bet you're not,' said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>Ed told me that it was after he'd smoked half-way through the cigarette
  that he began to feel sleepy, but he was suspicious of nothing.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock that night Ed, covered with dust and looking as if he
  had been passed through a cinder sifter, staggered into the police station
  near Chislehurst Common. He hadn't any idea what had happened to him except
  that he'd gone to sleep, and that when he woke up he was lying on the grass
  with a pillow under his head, no money in his pocket, and a tongue like
  sandpaper. They brought him along to me, and he spilt his story with all
  kinds of emotional variations, and as soon as I'd heard it through I sent out
  a hurry call to pull in the brothers Larsen.</p>

  <p>Of course there was a young man at the bank called Jorlton, and he was the
  brother of the dramatist: but the 'dramatist' who called on Ed Lasthall and
  scared him into drawing his money from the bank was Joe Larsen, and the
  artistic detective was his brother Harry. I s'pose Joe was the car
  driver&mdash;Ed Lasthall remembered that he wore goggles. It was the
  cleverest thing that has ever been done in our division.</p>

  <p>We never caught the Larsens. When Pat came out of prison we put him under
  observation, but he slipped us and disappeared from England. The only clue I
  had was that whilst he was in prison he was learning Spanish, and that's no
  clue, except for detectives who go around deducting and theorizing.</p>

  <p>The only good thing that came out of it was that Nethersole's Bank, which
  is as sound as the Bank of England, closed Ed's account: but he must have had
  plenty of money, for when we pinched him, a year later, in connection with
  the Duchess of Helboro's diamonds, he briefed the best counsel in England and
  got away with three years when he ought to have had seven.</p>
