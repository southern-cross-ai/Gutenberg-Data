Letter from Sydney&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." by Wakefield (1829), and
further elucidate his influential views on the subject of colonization, shortly
before the passage of the Reform Bill. It was only later
acknowledged that "P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" was in fact
Wakefield.</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. I.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO THE LORD HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES.</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">London, 1st December 1830.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;For one reason, at least;
the public has cause to rejoice at your appointment to the place
lately filled by Mr. <span class="a">Horace Twiss</span>. It is
much to be doubted, whether, when that briefless Chancery lawyer
was made Under-Secretary for the Colonies he could have pointed
out on the map one out of three of the colonies of Britain. That
he was utterly ignorant of the condition, wants, resources, and
peculiar circumstances of all our colonies, is certain; except
that, perhaps, he might have known that the West Indies produce
sugar and slaves, that the Cape of God Hope once belonged to the
Dutch (though this is doubtful), that Canada is in the northern
division of America, and that New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land are used as convict jails. I do not pretend to knew what May
be the degree of your acquaintance with our colonies; but about
this, at least, I am not inclined to doubt,&mdash;that you wish
to acquire useful knowledge relating to your office, and that you
possess both the industry and the capacity for becoming complete
master of the subject. Further, though you belong to a proud and
somewhat haughty race, you may be supposed free from that
ridiculous presumption which so often Marks the bearing of
successful <i>parvenus</i>. Mr. <span class="a">Horace
Twiss</span> thought himself intimately acquainted with every
thing that a Minister for the colonies&mdash;ought to know. Your
pride, if not a better feeling, will spare you the reproach of
self-sufficiency. You will not be ashamed to learn that of which
you feel yourself to be ignorant, and 'which it Mast be plain to
one of your good understanding that you ought to know thoroughly.
Moreover, I entirely mistake your character, if-you do not judge
of the information that may be offered to you, dither by its
intrinsic value, if it have any, than by the medium through which
it may be conveyed to you. Mr. <span class="a">Twiss</span> would
have treated with a sort of Jack-in-office scorn, any thing
addressed to him in a newspaper: you, let it be hoped, are above
such despicable humours. Your predecessor belonged to the old
school, which imagines that office and knowledge, like newspapers
and impertinence; are synonymous terms; whilst your mind mast be
open to receive, if it have not already imbibed the conviction,
that it is disgraceful to hold Office without knowledge; and
dangerous, too, considering the power of the newspaper press. On
the whole, though your want of experience in business renders you
unfit for your place, in an other point of view, your youth mast
be satisfactory to the public; giving promise of modesty,
industry, respect for public opinion, and ambition to distinguish
yourself by rendering important services to your country.</p>
<p>By the above considerations I am tempted, to commence a series
of Letters, which I propose to address to you through the medium
of the <span class="a">Spectator</span>, in which I intend to
call your attention to the whole subject of <span class=
"a">Colonial Administration</span>. This is a subject of which
you cannot, I fear, know much, and which I have diligently
studied. If you are willing to learn, I am ready to teach; and
whether you learn or not, the trouble that I may take will not be
thrown away.</p>
<p>The point which I propose to notice first, and to which the
rest of this letter will be confined, is one with respect to
which you may be prevented from committing great practical
errors, by its being brought thus early to your notice.</p>
<p>The regulations for granting land at the new settlement in
Western Australia are on the point of expiring. They must be
either renewed or replaced immediately. Have you looked at those
regulations? If not, examine them, and say with what objects they
were framed. Inquire in your office, and learn the miserable
results which they have already produced. Grants of land, equal
in extent to English counties, have been made to individuals. It
is absurd to suppose that such immense tracts can be properly
cultivated by the persons in possession of them. What, then, must
be the effects of such profusion in disposing of the waste land
the property of the state? Must not its effects be to scatter the
settlers&mdash;to prevent them from combining their capital and
labour&mdash;to compel them to waste the capital which they have
been tempted, even by the profusion in question, to export from
England&mdash;to reduce them, or at least the generation that
shall follow them, to a state of poverty and semi-barbarism, like
that of the Dutch settlers at the Cape of Good Hope, of the
French settlers in Lower Canada, and of the Spanish colonists in
many parts of South America?</p>
<p>To what an infinite number of reflections do the above
questions lead! In order to answer those questions
satisfactorily, one ought to be pretty well acquainted with the
laws which regulate production, distribution, and consumption in
old countries; and, more especially, with the same laws as they
operate amongst bodies of men who, to use the words of
<span class="a">Adam Smith</span>, "take possession of a waste
country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily
give place to the new settlers." Few if any of the political
economists of Europe have seriously examined the latter branch of
the science which is their peculiar study; and they are not,
consequently, prepared even to admit that the economical
circumstances of "new countries" differ very greatly, and in many
very important respects, from those of the states of Europe
generally. Yet that this is the case, must be plain to him who
will give the subject a moment's attention. Let the endeavour to
prove the fact.</p>
<p>Nearly all that has been written about <i>Wages</i>, the
<i>Division of Labour</i>, the <i>Profits of Stock</i>, and
especially <i>Rent</i>, is almost wholly inapplicable to the
state of such communities as our colonies in South Africa,
Australasia, and America, as well as the United States. Have the
circumstances which produce a rise or fall of wages in England
any effect on the condition of labourers, that is, slaves, in
South Africa and America? Of what use is <span class="a">Adam
Smith's</span> admirable illustration of the advantages of the
division of labour, to one who like the Canadian backwoodsman, is
compelled by circumstances beyond his control to do almost every
thing for himself? In England we say that "the profits of stock
are high when the wages of labour are low"&mdash;yet throughout
North America, as well as in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, the profit of stock and the wages-of labour are <i>both</i>
extremely high when compared with the same things in England.
<i>Rent</i>, respecting which so much has been written in
England, being a payment by the occupier to the proprietor of
superior land, is a thing scarcely known in many new countries as
to a great portion of the 'land; and as to other portions of land
in the same countries, is governed by laws differing materially
from the laws which regulate rent in England. In New South Wales,
for instance, a very high-rent is paid for very poor land close
to a town, whilst no rent at all can be procured for some of the
richest land situated far from a town.</p>
<p>Again, in England, <i>timber</i> is always a highly valuable
commodity&mdash;in Canada it is, generally, a hindrance and an
evil. In England, marsh land by the side of rivers is of superior
value&mdash;in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, such land,
being wet and thickly wooded, is often of the least value, or
rather of no value at all, being completely unmanageable for want
of labourers to clear and drain it. In England, the competition
of labourers for employment&mdash;in many new countries the exact
reverse, the competition of capitalists for labour, are universal
complaints. In Europe, the pressure of population on the means of
subsistence is evident to all reflecting men, and is considered a
fact of such deep importance in the science of government, that
the writer who proved the fact is become perhaps the most
illustrious of philosophers. In great part of North America on
the contrary, in South Africa and Australasia, the pressure of
population on the means of subsistence is scarcely ever felt; yet
in other new countries, that greatest, because the most
productive of human ills, is constantly felt, though
apparently&mdash;the circumstances which operate so happily in
one case ought to have a similar effect in the other, and though
it be quite plain that, in the latter case, the evil do not
spring from the causes by which it is produced in England. I
allude here to the misery which prevails in the territory of
Buenos Ayres; whose inhabitants possess at least a hundred times
more land than they are able to cultivate. In England, at this
moment, labourers are sent to prison (how many, my Lord, within
the last month?) for compelling capitalists to furnish them with
profitable employment&mdash;in New South Wales, capitalists often
send labourers to prison for refusing to work at wages which in
England would be thought extravagantly high. I do not observe
that the rich are ever sent to prison for ill-treating the poor,
but this remark is beside the question. Mr. <span class=
"a">Potter Macqueen</span>, the late M.P. for Bedfordshire, In
order to relieve his English estate of a burthen, sent a number
of the labourers born upon it, to work upon his estate in New
South Wales: but these wretched paupers no sooner breathed the
air of the Antipodes than their whole nature seemed to be
changed, for instead of earnestly desiring labour and wages, they
refused to labour for any body at any rate of wages; and they are
now become competitors with their former master in the Australian
market of labour. In England, he who cultivates his own land
takes especial care to preserve its fertility: throughout North
America and the British settlements of Australasia, the
proprietor-cultivator Often destroys the fertility of his land as
soon as possible; and it is, moreover, dearly for his advantage
to pursue what in England would be called the ruinous practice of
exhaustion. In England we hive not the least difficulty in
procuring any desired number of labourers to perform the same
kind of work at the same time, in the same place, and for a
considerable period of time: but in many new countries this first
improvement in the application of labour, which incalculably
augments the produce of any given amount of capital and labour,
is found next to impossible. Hence, in some new countries, the
absolute necessity of employing slaves, if it be absolutely
necessary to produce commodities which require the employment of
many hands in one field. Hence the revival of slavery, scarcely
three hundred years ago, by bodies of Christian emigrants, whose
mother states had but lately abolished that wicked
institution!</p>
<p>Have I cited facts enough to prove that the political economy
of Europe is, for the most part, inapplicable to new countries
like the more extensive colonies of Britain?</p>
<p>I do not suspect Mr. <span class="a">Horace Twiss</span> or
Sir <span class="a">George Murray</span> of knowing much of the
political economy of Europe; nor is it perhaps absolutely
necessary that our European statesman should understand the
science, because he may always receive correction and assistance
from those to whom it is familiar. But the situation of a
Colonial Minister is very different. Lord Goderich and you, my
Lord, sitting in Downing Street, have to legislate, according to
your own will or whim merely, for three new Englands, each of
which surpasses England in extent, and must in time surpass her
in population and wealth. Has it ever struck yon, that the mode
in which you gentlemen of the Colonial Office may dispose of the
waste land in the colonies, has a most important influence on the
condition of the colonists? Probably you never gave the subject a
moment's thought. When Mr. <span class="a">Twiss</span> or Sir
<span class="a">George Murray</span> sat down to frame the
Regulations for granting land in Western Australia it never
occurred to him, I dare say, that for such a task some knowledge
was required of the peculiar circumstances which belong to
colonies like the one that he was about to found. Yet, as the
political economists of England were not likely to afford him
correction and assistance, he was under the deepest obligation to
acquire a thorough knowledge of the whole subject; provided
always, that the mode in which the state disposes of waste land
have an important influence on the condition and progress of new
colonies.</p>
<p>In a future letter I will endeavour to satisfy you that the
influence in question is paramount and universal.</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. II.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES.</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">13th December, 1830.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;I have undertaken to
satisfy you, that the mode in which the state disposes of waste
land, has a paramount and universal influence on the condition
and progress of new colonies.</p>
<p>What is meant by colonization? It is not necessary to encumber
the answer with any but the slightest mention of certain distant
possessions, sometimes improperly called colonies. Malta and
Hindostan are not, properly speaking, colonies of Britain.</p>
<p>A colony signifies a body, or successive bodies of men, who
take possession of a waste country; and the elements of
colonization are&mdash;first, Emigration, and secondly, Waste
Land at the disposal of the state.</p>
<p>But the latter term may be converted into the disposal of
waste land by the state; for it is not the land, of which much
exists at home, but the desert nature of the land, or still more,
the absolute power of the state over the land, which constitutes
one of the elements of colonization.</p>
<p>Already, then, the point in question is established by
reasoning <i>à priori</i>; for, if the disposal of waste land be
one of the elements of colonization, it follows, inevitably, that
the mode in which the state disposes of waste land has a
paramount and universal influence on the condition and progress
of new colonies. To deny this, would be to deny that one of the
elements, or essential ingredients of a thing, forms part of the
thing. One might as welt say, that the way in which a man uses
his legs has not an important influence on his mode of
walking.</p>
<p>But I will not insist on the force of any reasoning <i>à
priori</i>, however plain and conclusive it may appear. Let us
appeal to facts and experience. Yet what a wide field of inquiry
is opened by this proposal! Volumes might be filled with an
account of the effects produced on the condition and progress of
new colonies by the various modes of disposing of waste land
which have been pursued by. the colonizing states of modern
Europe. A mere statement of the various regulations for granting
new land in modern colonies, without any notice of their erects,
would form a book. Even, the slightest sketch of those numerous
systems or practices would occupy more space than the
<span class="a">Spectator</span> will afford for the series of
letters on Colonial Administration in general, which I propose to
address to you. Here I can do no more than hint at the extensive
inquiry which you are bound to make; unless you would deserve the
reproach of ignorance as to one of the most important subjects
with which an English Colonial Minister ought to be acquainted.
Not less than a thousand volumes afford very useful information
on this subject. Will you read all of them? Will you look at one
of them? The lawyer, your predecessor, certainly never opened one
of those books with a view to the inquiry hereby suggested to
you. But then, look at his preposterous regulations for granting
land at the Swan River; surpassed in folly only by those which
once existed at the Cape of Good Hope, where the Dutch settlers
were forbidden, in so many words, to locate themselves at a less
distance than three leagues from each other!</p>
<p>You are about to renew or replace those regulations. Have you
formed the least idea of any one principle that ought to guide
you in this work&mdash;a work of as much importance to the new
colony, as is the manner in which a house shall be built of
importance to its inhabitants?</p>
<p>Your colleague, Mr. <span class="a">Hay</span>, will tell you
that the existing regulations are excellent. Ask for the reasons
of his opinion, he will then talk to you about the propriety of
encouraging capitalists to emigrate,&mdash;as if, forsooth, the
permanent abstraction of capital were not hurtful to the mother
country,&mdash;as if those stupid regulations had not ceased to
produce the mischievous effect designed by them; since, already,
capitalists, have discovered that land in New Holland is worth
nothing, without the means of cultivating it, and that the
regulations in question absolutely forbid the existence in the
colony of a class either of tenants or of labourers for hire. Mr.
<span class="a">Hay</span> will tell you that it is better that
any body should possess the land&mdash;rather the savages and
kangaroos of the country. Perhaps it is thus that he would excuse
the possession of half of Prince Edward's Island in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, by his late master, Lord <span class=
"a">Melville</span>; and of the other half, or thereabouts, by
Lord <span class="a">Westmoreland</span>&mdash;neither of those
noble lords having either the means or the inclination to
cultivate their immense colonial possessions. But if so, why not
at once grant all the waste land of New Holland to the first
applicant? To do this would, you think, be preposterous. No doubt
it would; because as no one man, nor any thousand men, could
cultivate the land, whilst his or their title to the land would
enable them to prevent others from cultivating it, such a grant
might suddenly and for ever extinguish one of the elements of
colonization in New Holland,&mdash;namely, the power of the state
to dispose of waste land.</p>
<p>But then Mr. <span class="a">Hay</span> would answer (I repeat
the substance of language lately uttered by him), "We attach
certain <span class="a">Conditions</span> to each grant; and one
of those conditions is, that the land shall be <i>properly
cultivated</i>." I have no doubt that Mr. <span class=
"a">Hay</span> would put forth this apology with entire good
faith; but if so, was ever ignorance greater than his?</p>
<p>The charge which I bring against an industrious and
well-meaning person like Mr. <span class="a">Hay</span> must not
be left unsupported. He defends the regulations on the ground
that the Government possesses the means of exacting a due
observance of the condition in question. If the Government have
no means of exacting the observance of the condition, he who
talks of the condition as being effectual, speaks either
dishonestly or ignorantly. Sure I am that Mr. <span class=
"a">Hay</span> does not speak dishonestly; and the alternative is
manifest&mdash;he speaks ignorantly&mdash;provided, as I now
assume, that the Government have not, and cannot have, any means
of enforcing the condition. The correctness of this assumption
will be easily proved.</p>
<p>The condition of "proper cultivation" has often before been
attached to grants of land in British colonies. Probably the
grantees of the immense colonial tracts still desert, now
possessed by the Lords <span class="a">Melville</span> and
<span class="a">Westmoreland</span>, subscribed to that
condition. Be that as it may, I take upon myself to state, that
in no solitary instance has the condition been observed; and I do
not believe that the Government has frequently resumed possession
of the land in consequence of the non-observance by the grantee
of the main condition on which his land was obtained. For this
apparent neglect, by itself, no Colonial Government, nor indeed
anybody, deserves blame. The term "proper cultivation" is so
extremely vague, that a hundred colonists would give a hundred
different interpretations of it; a mode of expressing the
condition of a bond, blameable truly in the highest degree, but
which shields from censure the person who is prevented, by that
very obscurity, from enforcing the penalty of the bond. Mr.
<span class="a">Hay</span> might contend that "proper
cultivation" is not a vague term; but, by so doing, he would give
a strong proof of the ignorance with which I charge him.</p>
<p>The term signifies, in the abstract, that sort of cultivation
by which the greatest produce is returned to the least capital
and labour, <i>without impoverishing the land</i>; and here,
where the markets of labour and produce are not subject to
frequent and violent changes, a definition of the abstract idea
describes pretty accurately what experience proves to be the best
cultivation. But would your colleague say that this is what ought
to be insisted on, as the main condition of grants of land in
waste countries? Does he know, or is he ignorant, that in
countries of which the inhabitants are so dispersed that there
can be but little combination of capital and labour, the mode of
treating land whereby the greatest return is given to the least
capital and labour, is generally, not cultivation, in any sense
of the word, but the <i>impoverishment</i> of the land&mdash;the
exhaustion of its fertility&mdash;in the shortest space of time?
Does he know that in countries where labour is scarce, roads are
bad, and markets few, the mode of treating land by which the
greatest return may be obtained most easily, varies infinitely
with the infinite variety of degrees in which labour, roads, and
markets are available; and according also to the infinite variety
in the natural qualities of unreclaimed land? If he answer these
questions rationally, and still contend that "proper cultivation"
is not an extremely vague term' when applied to most new
colonies, then he is perfectly qualified for his office, and I am
an ignorant, impertinent meddler.</p>
<p>In order, however, that when you discuss this matter with him,
your general inexperience may not be misled by his experience of
the mere routine of office, I beg leave to remind you that, in
the regulations for granting new laud at the Swan River, the term
"proper cultivation" is not used, but that the condition attached
to grants is&mdash;that cultivation "which shall be satisfactory
to the Governor." Satisfactory to the Governor!&mdash;that
Governor: being an excellent sea-captain, but knowing less,
probably of the cultivation of land than you, or Lord
<span class="a">Goderich</span>, or I, know of navigation; and
having, moreover, besides 100,000 acres of his own land to attend
to, such multifarious and pressing occupations, that, were he an
<span class="a">Arthur Young</span> or a <span class=
"a">Coke</span> in knowledge of agriculture, he could never
"satisfy" himself as to the treatment of a thousandth part of the
immense tract of land over which the few colonists are
scattered!</p>
<p>This is more than enough, I hope, to convince you that your
colleague's apology for the laud regulations in the new colony,
is put forth through sheer ignorance.</p>
<p>Let us return to the main point. What are the principles that
ought to guide a colonizing state in the disposal of waste
land?</p>
<p>A preliminary question&mdash;though hardly a
question&mdash;must be determined; viz, the immediate
<i>objects</i> of the state in disposing of waste land. These
objects may be stated at once and finally, without stopping to
explain them, as the greatest prosperity and the greatest
progress of the colony.</p>
<p>You will imagine that in some one of the colonies of modern
Europe, for at least one short period, the Government must have
adopted, in the disposal of waste land, a <i>system</i>
deliberately formed with a view to the greatest progress and
prosperity of the colony. If you know of any such system, you
know more of colonization than I do; though I have examined above
one hundred practices' called systems, adopted by the different
Governments of Europe in the disposal of waste land in America
alone. Had the natives of the American islands been capable of
hard labour, the first grants made by the Spanish Government of
Hispaniola,&mdash;each of which included a grant of so many
natives in proportion to the extent of land granted,&mdash;would
have been more rational, and, putting aside the wickedness of the
proceeding, far more conducive to the prosperity and progress of
the colony, than Sir <span class="a">George Murray's</span>
regulations for granting land in the last colony founded by
England. Between these two miscalled systems, and during a period
of about three hundred years, there have existed not less, I am
inclined to believe, than three hundred different modes of
granting waste land. In no two colonies, and scarcely in any two
settlements of a colony, was the same mode ever adopted; whilst
no one mode was ever steadily pursued in any colony or
settlement. The changes of plan in most colonies have been as
frequent as the changes in the person of the colonial
governor&mdash;indeed much more frequent, inasmuch as most
governors have pursued several different plans in the course of
only a few years. Now, if you will take the trouble to reckon the
number of colonies or settlements planted both by the states of
Europe and by several colonies of those states, including the no
small number which have perished, you will find my statement as
to the <i>variety</i> of modes of granting waste land by no means
exaggerated.</p>
<p>What would be thought of an architect who, besides never
building any two houses alike, should employ half a dozen
different, and often contradictory plans in building each Single
house? Colonization is an art of greater importance, surely, than
architecture; and which, being the creation of all things except
land where nothing but land exists, requires for its due
performance the highest capacity and the most extensive
knowledge. Yet the persons intrusted with the performance of this
art have, for the most part, been incapable and ignorant to the
last degree; more especially in later times, since not even
energy of character was required for obtaining a governor's
salary, and with respect to the colonies of England in
particular, which have nearly always been treated by the Home
Government as mere pretexts for enriching the aristocracy and
their dependents at the expense of the people of England. What
think you of the integrity, sagacity, and diversified knowledge
of a Lord <span class="a">Bathurst</span> and Mr. <span class=
"a">Twiss</span>?&mdash;of the jockey and gambler who lately
received 15,000<i>l</i>. a year for misgoverning, nay, for
tyrannizing over, the Cape of Good Hope?&mdash;of a General
<span class="a">Darling</span>, who has carefully sown the seeds
of early revolt in New South Wales?&mdash;or of that naval
captain, on whose "satisfaction," as a farmer, depends every
settler's title to his land at the new colony in Western
Australia? It needs no conjuror to divine what you think of these
men's fitness for the important trusts reposed in them; and I
cannot doubt that now, when you are reminded that the disposal of
waste land in our colonies has generally been left to the mere
caprice of men like these, you will cease to wonder that the
numerous changes of plan, in operations which ought, perhaps,
beyond all others, to be conducted with an uniform regard to
certain main principles.</p>
<p>Here I must again impress on you the paramount and universal
influence on the progress and prosperity of a colony, of the mode
in which the Government may dispose of waste land. Think of this;
and immediately the conclusion arises, that frequent and violent
changes in the mode of disposing of waste land, must cause
frequent and violent fluctuations in the value of land, capital,
and labour. But trust not to any reasoning of mine. Read the
history of any colony where such changes have frequently
occurred, and the infinite mischiefs of the system, or rather
want of system, will become abundantly plain to you.</p>
<p>In the Swan River regulations it is expressly stated, that the
mode of granting land thereby announced, will last only till the
end of this year; and that, after this year, some other mode will
be enacted by "his Majesty's Government." Thus, the Government
deliberately provides for change, as to that of which the very
first good quality is permanency.</p>
<p>One remark more, and I have done with this part of the
subject. It seems hardly open to doubt, that if, by inquiry and
reflection, or by chance, any governor had discovered the best
mode of granting land&mdash;the mode that is most conducive to
the prosperity and progress of the colony&mdash;some account of
that mode would have been handed down to us, if only in the shape
of murmurs at its abandonment. Is there any such account, written
or traditional? I know of none; and of this I am sure, that no
mode has been found so good is to be maintained by the cries of
the colonists in spite of the frequent whims of successive
governors. Thus, from the universal and frequent changes in this
all-important proceeding of colonization, I am led to conclude
that the best system of granting new land remains yet to be
discovered.</p>
<p>So much for what relates to the variableness of the practices
hitherto adopted. A slight notice of some of those practices,
miscalled systems, will occupy a future letter.</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. III.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES.</h4>
<div class="date">27th December, 1830.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;If it be impossible to
describe, from experience, the best mode of using one of the two
main ingredients of colonization, it is extremely difficult to
name the worst mode hitherto adopted. I am inclined to think that
<span class="a">Sir George Murray's</span> Swan River regulations
constitute one of the worst; but they are all so miserably bad,
that each of them, as one dwells on it in turn, appears worse
than any other. Moreover, nearly all of them are so confused, so
contradictory in one part to the apparent design of another part;
and again, so few of those plans, which have been written down,
were ever executed, with respect even to a single
grant,&mdash;that one knows not how to compare them with each
other, or to speak, except in general terms as to the results
produced by any one of them. Altogether they terms, a mass of
jobbing, ignorance, caprice, and downright nonsense; and these,
the ingredients of the mass, are mixed in so perfect a disorder,
that the labour of an endeavour to explain them would be as great
as the waste of time. I shall not undertake a task so wearisome
and useless. But I propose to select from the heterogeneous mass
some few of the plans, which are not so absurd as to be
indescribable, and to lay these before you, for the purpose of
inviting you to further inquiries.</p>
<p>It must first be said, however, that in a great number of
instances no plan whatever has been acted upon; the Colonial
Minister at home and his Under Secretaries, the Governor and his
Secretaries, having each of them followed his own
pleasure,&mdash;having, that is, obeyed his own corrupt or
whimsical motives, in the disposal of waste land. Thus it has
often happened in a colony, that the Colonial Minister at home,
an ignorant lord&mdash;his jobbing clerk, a mere quill-driver in
intellect&mdash;such a Governor as Lord <span class="a">Charles
Somerset</span> or Sir <span class="a">Hudson
Lowe</span>&mdash;and two or three parasites of "His Excellency,"
have been making grants of land, each according to his fancy, and
all at the same time. Some of these grants had conditions
attached to them, and some no conditions; some one condition, and
some another; and some were so much opposed to and clashing with
each other, that not one of the number became effective, except
by preventing the effectiveness of some or all of the others. To
describe such cases as these, is impossible. Merely to think of
them produces confusion of mind; and as for explaining them, one
might as well attempt to give a. rational account of the conceits
engendered in madness.</p>
<p>I will now just mention five plans of granting land, merely as
a sample of the egregious stupidity displayed even in the least
blameable instances.</p>
<p>First&mdash;When the first settlers in Canada, whose sole
object in emigrating was to establish a trade with the Indians,
became of sufficient importance to be thought worth controlling
by the French Government, that Government invented for the colony
a system of granting land. The whole of the accessible country
was bestowed on a small number of adventurers, as tenants of the
Crown; each person obtaining an immense district, under the title
of a seigneurie. At the same time, these Canadian seigneurs were
precluded from alienating their possessions, but were enjoined to
grant sub-leases on the following conditions&mdash;1st, that the
lessee should pay a small yearly sum to the lord; 2nd, that the
tenant should bring his corn to be ground at the lord's mill,
with other such like feudal observances; 3rd, that the tenant
should not dispose of his lease without the lord's
permission.</p>
<p>The object of this barbarous scheme was, no doubt, to create a
Canadian noblesse. The effect of it was to check, or rather
prevent, emigration to Canada; to condemn the colonists to
poverty and barbarism; to render the colony a source of heavy
loss to its mother country, up to the time when England saw fit
to expend thousands of lives and millions of money in relieving
France of the burden, and taking it to herself.</p>
<p>The effect of this scheme had become sufficiently manifest
long before England took possession of Canada. Yet, as will be
plain to you on reading once more the well-known debate on the
Quebec Bill, <span class="a">Pitt</span> and <span class=
"a">Fox</span> and <span class="a">Burke</span> imagined that
nothing but an Act of Parliament was required to convert the
Canadian seigneurs of the desert into an effective aristocracy.
All Englishmen of decent education have read that debate; but it
is worth the while of every Englishman to read it again, for the
sake of learning how profoundly ignorant were the public men of
your grandfather's time concerning the mere elements of public
economy. In passing, I may observe that, however ignorant those
men were of the true principles of Colonization, and however
confident of their own perfect knowledge a the subject, they were
not, in these respects, behind "statesmen" of the present
day,&mdash;to wit, Lord <span class="a">Bathurst</span>, Mr.
<span class="a">Wilmot Horton</span>, and Mr. <span class=
"a">Horace Twiss</span>.</p>
<p>Secondly&mdash;In the French colony of Louisiana, a plan of
granting land was adopted, very different from that which I have
just described. "Grants of land," as the Abbé <span class=
"a">Raynal</span> informs us, "were made indiscriminately to
every person who applied for them, and in the manner in which he
desired them." One consequence of this system was, as the Abbé
goes on to say, that "immense deserts separated the colonists
from each other." In the end, the colony perished; and the land
is now being colonized over again by the Americans!</p>
<p>The Swan River system of granting land appears to have been
copied from this notable blunder of <span class="a">Law</span>;
with this difference only, that the Scotchman who approved, if he
did not draw up, the regulations for granting land at the Swan
River, does not propose to discharge the national debt by means
of colonization.</p>
<p>Thirdly&mdash;In Upper Canada, a considerable portion of the
accessible territory has been "<i>reserved</i> for the Crown and
the Church." In other words, the colonists have been commanded to
leave in a desert state certain tracts of land, so intermixed
with their own grants as to prevent them from living near to each
other. You will readily conceive that neither the Crown nor the
Church ever thought of cultivating those "reserves." The
malpractice in question, therefore, had the effect of permanently
interposing tracts of wilderness between the grants made to
settlers; a measure far less rational than would have been the
annihilation of those "reserves," since the latter operation,
supposing it had been possible, would not have affected the
colonists injuriously. The fullest information as to the ruinous
effects of these Crown and Clergy reserves is to be found in
<span class="a">Gourlay's</span> account of Upper Canada; but I
may observe, that the author, a man who would have done honour to
human nature if born under a representative government, has mixed
up with much valuable statistical information an account of his
own pre-eminent misfortunes, and a picture of his own mental
sufferings, so distressing&mdash;or, if your Lordship should
prefer the more aristocratic expression, so annoying&mdash;to the
reader, that it becomes difficult to extract from his book those
parts which are merely useful.</p>
<p>I am informed that Mr. <span class="a">Gourlay</span> is still
unfortunate. His talents and his honesty no one will question; he
was cruelly persecuted, and has had no redress; and his name is
popular in Canada. The <span class="a">Murrays</span> and
<span class="a">Twisses</span> would have appointed a footman or
a dog, rather than so honest and able a man as <span class=
"a">Gourlay</span>, to some colonial Office in which he might be
useful. What will Lord <span class="a">Howick</span> do, being
still young and generous?</p>
<p>Fourthly&mdash;The Spanish Government bestowed the greater
part, if not the whole, of the plains which lie between the Table
Land and the Gulf of Mexico on some dozen or so of Spanish lords,
residents in Spain or owners of mines and other property in the
mountains and Table Land. The only use which the noble grantees
made of their title to that immense and very fertile district,
was to prevent others from settling there; and <span class=
"a">Humboldt</span> informs us, that up to the time of his visit
to Mexico, the plains of Vera Cruz and San Luis Potosi were still
a wilderness of swamp. Here we have an instance of the
<i>extinction</i>, during snore than a century, of one of the
elements of colonization; and one instance, also, of the method
of granting waste land, which your colleague, Mr. <span class=
"a">Ray</span>, considers preferable to leaving the land in the
possession of savages and wild beasts. I must remark also, that
the grant of the whole of Prince Edward's Island between the
Lords <span class="a">Melville</span> and <span class=
"a">Westmoreland</span> is a similar example Of this curious mode
of colonizing a waste country.</p>
<p>Fifthly&mdash;In New South Wales, successive governors have
been instructed, or have thought proper, to compel emigrants
arriving from England to settle at the very outskirts of the
colony. In order to effect this apparently ridiculous purpose,
they have refused to grant land (except to favourites of their
own, and persons with powerful recommendations from Downing
Street) in what may be termed the settled districts. Even now,
though, in consequence of this malpractice, at least three
fourths of the settled districts are still the property of the
state, emigrants from England, having capital, but not having
found favour with General <span class="a">Darling</span>-or his
creatures, are compelled to travel across the Blue Mountains, or
to Hunter's River,&mdash;in either case a considerable distance,
and the more considerable since there are no roads&mdash;in order
to obtain a grant; passing, let this be remarked, in their way to
the spot fixed upon by his Excellency for their location,
hundreds of thousands, nay millions, of acres of fertile land
still desert and belonging to the Government, some of which they
would infinitely prefer to the allotment awarded to them by the
Governor or his Secretary at Sidney. What a beautiful system of
Colonization! Mr. <span class="a">Wilmot Horton</span> possesses
a paper, being "Minutes of a Conversation" between himself and
Mr. <span class="a">Blaxland</span>, one of the most intelligent
settlers in New South Wales, which admirably illustrates this
last mode of granting waste land. By the paper in question, it
will appear that Mr. <span class="a">Blaxland</span> exchanged
4000 acres, I believe, of land distant from labour, roads, and
markets, for 500 acres comparatively near to those means of
deriving profit from the cultivation of land. As Mr. <span class=
"a">Horton</span> earnestly contends that emigrants ought to be
allowed a perfectly <i>free choice</i> as to the appropriation of
waste land, he will probably publish the document in question;
but if he should not, I will. I have the honour to be, my
Lord,</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. IV.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">1st January, 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;I return to the question,
What are the principles that ought to guide a colonizing state in
the disposal of waste land?</p>
<p>You must find an answer to this question before you can, with
any satisfaction to yourself, prepare or approve of new
regulations for granting land in the last colony founded by
England. Further, it must be plain to you, that <i>a system</i>
of granting land, deliberately formed with a view to the greatest
prosperity and progress of the new colony in Western Australia,
would be applicable to the other more extensive colonies of
Britain,&mdash;Van Diemen's Land, New South Wales, the Canadas,
and Southern Africa; not to mention the numerous desert
countries, such as New Zealand, the Southern coast of New
Holland, portions of Ceylon, and perhaps even the interior of
Jamaica, to which, on account of the evils of redundant
population at home, it might he advisable to apply a rational
system of colonization.</p>
<p>Is there a system of colonization so good as to be fit for use
in the existing colonies, and as to justify the establishment of
other colonies? Considering the all-important influence on the
condition of new colonies, of the mode in which the state
disposes of waste land, it may be that there is a mode of
employing that element of colonization so as to produce, first,
in the colonies, a degree of prosperity sufficient to enable them
to defray the whole cost of their own government and protection;
and, secondly, such an amount of pauper-emigration from Britain,
as would greatly mitigate, if it did not prevent for generations
to come, the evils of over-population.</p>
<p>The former of those two objects must soon be effected by some
means, or the Representative Government which your noble father
has promised to the people of England will sever the connexion
between the mother country and her colonies&mdash;a connexion
which is at present an unmixed burden to both parties. The latter
object, to use the words of Mr. <span class="a">Mill</span>,
"deserves profound regard, since the principle of population has
been found to exert so great an influence on the condition of
human beings." Mr. <span class="a">Mill</span>, it is true, has
not yet bestowed his own serious attention on this most important
inquiry; but that he will shortly do so, we have every reason to
hope, considering how slight would be the effort to his
instructed and powerful mind, and that the wisest and best of his
countrymen now call upon him to say, by what means <span class=
"a">Good Government</span> may be obtained, without a series of
convulsions to arise from giving power to the many, who are yet,
and who seem likely to remain, ignorant, savage, and dishonest,
through the excess of their numbers.</p>
<p>"The great class," says Mr. <span class="a">Mill</span>, "who
have nothing to give for food but ordinary labour, are the great
body of the people. When every individual in the great body of
the people has less than the due quantity of food, less than
would fall to his share if the quantity of food were not too
small for the population, the state of the great body of the
people is the state of sordid, painful, and degrading poverty.
They are wretchedly fed, wretchedly clothed, have wretched
houses, and neither time nor means to keep either their houses or
their persons free from disgusting impurity. Those of them, who
either from bodily infirmities have less than the ordinary
quantity of labour to bestow, or, from the state of their
families, require a greater than ordinary quantity of food, are
condemned to starve&mdash;either wholly, if they have not enough
to keep them alive, or partially, if they have enough to yield
them a lingering, diseased, and, after all, a shortened
existence.</p>
<p>"What the ignorant and vulgar spectator sees in all this, is
not a redundant population,&mdash;it is only a poor population.
He sees nobody without food who has enough to give for it. To his
eye, therefore, it is not food which is wanting, but that which
is to be given for it. When events succeed in this train, and are
viewed with these eyes, there never can appear to be a redundancy
of population."</p>
<p>It is in this train that events succeed in England; and with
these eyes the Government has always viewed them,&mdash;an
"ignorant and vulgar spectator" of the misery of the working
classes. But the time is come, at length, when the small ruling
class must seriously endeavour to improve the condition of the
great body of the people. Special commissions, hangings, and the
transportation of great numbers to become slaves in the colonies,
may indeed check, though we may doubt whether it will prevent,
the use by the peasantry of the only means, hitherto effectual,
for obtaining wherewith to enjoy life. Whether wages, raised by
the fires (it would be absurd to deny this truth because it
alarms us), will be again lowered to the starvation rate, is very
much to be doubted; and if they be not, either the farmers must
be ruined by the great deduction from their profits&mdash;in
which case rent will cease&mdash;or the increase of wages must be
paid by a deduction from rent and tithe. In this latter case, the
increase of one shilling per day to the wages of two hundred
thousand labourers, would amount to above thirty millions per
annum, or three parts of the whole yearly rent. What a prospect
for the aristocracy, whose estates are encumbered to the amount
of at least the other quarter of the rent! But this is not all.
The Government now engages ships, for the transport of the
redundant peasantry, even <i>before</i> those miserable creatures
are convicted of the crimes to which they are driven by the
excess of their numbers in proportion to employment. This
astounding, fact will induce many to be no longer "ignorant and
vulgar spectators" of the workings of the principle of
population. Lastly, the ruling class is now very anxious to put
an end to that evil operation of the Poor-laws which promotes
excess of numbers; and the country expects from the new
Administration a repeal of the tax on bread; neither of which
benefits would it be possible to attain without, as Mr.
<span class="a">Senior</span> has lately shown, either deeply
aggravating for a time the evils of superabundant population, or
removing the superfluous number to the colonies. Upon the whole,
it seems more than probable that the Government will now
seriously endeavour to frame a sound and really beneficial
measure of emigration.</p>
<p>On this head, I have only to remark further, that emigration
is but one of the elements of colonization; and that the best
arranged and best conducted scheme of emigration, merely, must
inevitably fail of its object, <i>unless dependent on a
well-arranged and well-conducted scheme of disposing of waste
land</i>.</p>
<p>For the third time I ask, What are the principles that ought
to guide a colonizing state in the disposal of waste land? But I
will not attempt to answer the question. And, indeed, believing,
as I do, that the true principles of colonization,&mdash;that is,
of emigration and of the disposal of waste land,--]nave been
already laid before the public, I could not state those
principles here without quoting at great length from the works to
which I allude,&mdash;viz., two short pamphlets, entitled, "A
Statement of the Principles and Objects of a National Society for
the Cure and Prevention of Pauperism by means of Systematic
Colonization," and "A Letter to Sir <span class="a">George
Murray</span> on Systematic Colonization, by Mr. <span class=
"a">Charles Tennant</span>." I have the honour to be, my

<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">3rd February, 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;Men's minds are so deeply
excited by the great question of Reform, that one cannot, at this
moment, hope for much attention to any other subject: on which
account, I propose to abstain, for the present, from continuing
these Letters; but this one more I am impelled to write without
delay. My motive for doing so will be partly explained by the
following extract from the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of to-day,
the 3rd of February.</p>
<p class="quote">"It is a curious proof of the utter disregard
which this country feels towards its colonial possessions (except
only those which are represented in Parliament by the West India
body), that a document, which we published on the 20th ult.,
involving the deepest interests of our Australian Colonies, has
not been copied into any other journal, or even mentioned by the
press. We doubt whether it has been a subject of conversation
between any two persons in England, not immediately connected
with the colonies to which it relates.<br>
<br>
"The paper in question consists of regulations lately issued by
the Colonial Office, for the future disposal of waste land by the
Government, in Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales. A thing
never before attempted, perhaps, except in the United States,
even in a single modern colony since' the discovery of America,
is provided for by these regulations,&mdash;namely, a uniform
system in the use of the principal element of colonization, that
is, the disposal of waste land by the state. The object of this
measure will be little understood by Englishmen generally. By the
Colonists, we have no doubt that the measure will be received, as
an inestimable boon. To those unrepresented British subjects, the
frequent fluctuations in the value of land, capital, end labour;
occasioned by the power hitherto awarded to every Governor of
extending or restricting the appropriation of new land according
to his mere whim, have been an evil of the greatest moment; an
evil constantly pressing on them; and an evil, too, from which
they had no hope of escape, unless through a reform of the
English Government. For it must be remarked, that to deprive the
Governor of his power over waste land, is to take away from him a
fruitful vineyard of jobs and patronage. In this case, the
Colonial Minister was able to adopt a right course without the
authority of Parliament Perhaps, had Parliament been consulted,
the Governor's power to job with new land and bestow it on his
favourites, would have been preserved, as a 'vested right' or a
'venerable Institution.'<br>
<br>
"Why should not this excellent system of increasing the
disposable territory of the colonists be extended to South Africa
and Canada?"</p>
<p>I entirely agree with the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> in its
opinion of this important measure; which I venture to predict,
will, if properly followed up, be productive of incalculable
benefit to the Colonies, and of no small gratification to your
Lordship, its author. Nay, more&mdash;considering "the paramount
and universal influence on the prosperity and progress of new
colonies, of the mode in which the state disposes of new land;"
considering the profound ignorance of former Colonial Ministers
as to the art of colonization; and considering further, that with
some additions, easily made, these regulations will form a
perfect system,&mdash;I will add, that the time must come and
sooner perhaps than your Lordship expects, when the name of
<span class="a">Howick</span> shall be mentioned with respect and
gratitude throughout the more extensive colonies of England. If
you have read my preceding letters you may have observed, that I
do not commonly deal in the language of panegyric: my sincerity,
therefore, on this occasion, is the less open to doubt.</p>
<p>Two things, principally, are required, in order to perfect
your Lordship's regulations for disposing of new land in Van
Diemen's Land, and New South Wales.</p>
<p>First&mdash;That the system should be rendered permanent. Let
us not forget the enormous influence which the system now adopted
will exert on the prosperity and progress of the colony. Yet the
adoption of the system is announced to the public&mdash;how? by a
document, published without any mark of authority, in a
newspaper, without a signature, and 'without any indication of
being the work of Government, except that at the bottom of it
there are the words, "Colonial Office, January 20, 1831." Perhaps
this system of granting land will be more beneficial to the
Colonies, than would be to England a Reform of Parliament. What
should we think of a Reform of Parliament, announced and secured
like this system of Colonization? What is to hinder Mr.
<span class="a">Twiss</span> or Sir <span class="a">George
Murray</span> (in case, unhappily, the Jack-in-office faction
should displace the present Ministry) from overturning your
Lordship's system, even by writing (for it is not necessary to
publish) other regulations, having at the bottom of them the
words, "Colonial Office, * * 183*?" By the new system it is
decreed, that "henceforth" all waste land shall be sold to the
highest bidder above the minimum price of 5<i>s</i>. per acre.
What is meant by <i>henceforth</i>?&mdash;So long as Lord
<span class="a">Howick</span> shall remain Under-Secretary for
the Colonies? I can find no other meaning in fact, whatever the
word may imply. Then again, consider how the insecurity of the
system will prevent its working well, even whilst it shall last.
Who will purchase land for 5<i>s</i>. per acre, with the
prospect, or the chance, of being able to obtain an immense grant
for nothing, or rather for a little subserviency to the Minister
at home or the Governor abroad, by waiting till we have once more
a jobbing Administration? Not another word, I feel sure, is
necessary to convince you, that the system must, if you intend it
to be effectual, be guaranteed by the supreme authority.</p>
<p>Secondly&mdash;In order that the system may be made productive
of the greatest good, both to the Colonies and to the Mother
Country, it is indispensable that the funds obtained by the sale
of waste land should be wholly employed in conducting the
emigration of British labourers to the colonies. Trusting that
your Lordship has read the pamphlets to which I referred in my
last letter, I shall not now dwell on this point, further than to
say, that, according to the system now adopted, and supposing
that the funds obtained by the sale of land be not devoted to
emigration, the 'purchaser of land will pay but for two
things,&mdash;the land; and the uniformity of system, preventive
of ruinous fluctuations in the value of land, capital, and
labour: whereas, if the proceeds of the sales of land were
devoted to emigration, <i>four</i> things would be obtained by
the purchase of land,&mdash;the two just mentioned; thirdly, a
supply of <span class="a">Labour</span> in due proportion to the
increase of appropriated land, whereby the cultivation of land
would be rendered highly profitable; and, fourthly, an increase
of <span class="a">Population</span>, in the like proportion;
whereby, in point of fact, the land would still be given away,
though apparently sold; because the land purchased would
presently sell for more than the original sum paid to the
Government.</p>
<p>The <i>Chronicle</i> asks why "this excellent system should
not be extended to South Africa and Canada?" I will notice the
question presently; but first let me state the reasons why the
system, even though not perfected, must be at once extended to
the new colony in Western Australia.</p>
<p>First&mdash;Because, if the practice&mdash;I will not call it
a system&mdash;of allowing every one to appropriate for nothing
an unlimited quantity of new land, be maintained anywhere in the
neighbourhood of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, the more
ignorant and imaginative of the inhabitants of those colonies who
may be disposed to settle on waste land, will probably be tempted
to quit those colonies, in order to disperse and barbarize
themselves where the Government promotes dispersion and
barbarism. This would be injurious to New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land. Indeed, so great are the facilities of
communication between those settlements and the settlement on the
western coast of New Holland, that the three settlements form but
one colony in the eye of a political economist. It may be said,
therefore, that, unless the mode of granting land at the Swan
River be the same as that adopted in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, not one of the settlements will enjoy a <i>uniform
system</i> in the disposal of new land by the state&mdash;the
grand desideratum of all modern colonies.</p>
<p>Secondly&mdash;Because the class of persons who quit England
to settle in Waste countries, judging only from what occurs here,
are generally bent on obtaining the greatest quantity of land on
what they call "the most easy terms;" and because, consequently,
the profusion with which land is granted in one of the Australian
settlements&mdash;that of the Swan River&mdash;would probably
deprive the other Australian settlements' New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, of the due share which they would otherwise
receive of emigration accompanied by capital. This consideration
has, I understand, already produced some alarm amongst persons
now in England, but connected with Van Diemen's Land and New
South Wales.</p>
<p>Want of space must, I find, compel me to reserve for a future
letter some remarks on the applicability of the new system of
granting land to South Africa and Canada.</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. VI.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES.</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">7th February 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;The postponement for
another month of the Ministerial proposal of Reform, by allaying
the public anxiety on the subject, gives room to hope that
further observations, even respecting our neglected and despised
Colonies, and even at the present moment, may obtain some share
of public attention. Of Lord <span class="a">Howick's</span>
earnest attention to the subject I have no doubt, since I
learn,&mdash;what I am glad to have this opportunity of stating
to the readers of the <span class=
"a">Spectator</span>,&mdash;that he is unremittingly occupied
with the business of his office, and most desirous to pursue the
best course in whatever may come under his official notice,
without much regard either to party politics, or to those more
important questions which, though they agitate the public mind of
this country, bear but slightly and indirectly on the subject of
<span class="a">Colonial Administration</span>. I therefore
proceed with my Letters on that subject. The present one will be
devoted to showing the applicability to South Africa and Canada
of the Regulations lately issued for the future disposal of new
land,&mdash;that is, for the progress of Colonization,&mdash;in
Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales.</p>
<p>To begin with South Africa. Perhaps there is no colony in
which more fantastic tricks have been played with the principal
element of colonization. Mr. <span class="a">Barrow's</span>
account of the mode in which the Dutch Government used to dispose
of new land to its disbanded German soldiers, is perfectly
ludicrous. The Government, it seems, was, like all bad
governments, afraid of its subjects. Fear and craft, the peculiar
attributes of bad government, led it to embody the maxim,
<i>divide et impera</i>, in a set of regulations for granting
land. New settlers were forbidden to locate themselves, except at
a distance of several miles from each other. This forcible
dispersion of the colonists of course prevented the formation of
roads; so that, in point of fact, each settler was, all but cut
off from useful intercourse with his fellow-colonists. Occasional
intercourse indeed he had, for the dispersion of the colonists
rendered them weaker, and laid them open to the attacks of the
natives; so that, occasionally, they were induced to assemble for
the purpose, either of present defence, or of future safety
through present amusement,&mdash;the amusement being to hunt the
blacks, as wolves used to be hunted in England. Consequently, the
Dutch colonists of South Africa became, under the name of Cape of
Good Hope boors, the most brutal of men not called savages. The
only thing apparently, that prevented them from sinking to the
level of Caffres, was their possessing slaves, whereby they were
enabled to preserve some <i>combination of labour</i> in their
solitary farms and homes.</p>
<p>The original colonists of the State of New York were Dutchmen
also. Why did not they become boors and half savages like their
countrymen of the Cape of Good Hope? The reasons are plain. The
dense forests and more warlike savages of America prevented the
early colonists from loosely spreading, or their government from
dispersing them, over a great extent of country. Kept together by
their fear of the Indians, by tangled woods and impassable
swamps, they laboured in concert; their production was great, and
yet not greater than their wants, which were those of civilized
life. They flourished exceedingly, and founded, perhaps, the most
prosperous, wealthy, and civilized of modern colonies.</p>
<p>From this comparison, your Lordship will readily gather, that
the circumstances of South Africa&mdash;that is, the open nature
of the country, and the timid character of the native
Africans&mdash;have been peculiarly favourable to the dispersion
of the colonists. It seems so much the more expedient that the
Government should dispose of new land in the manner best
calculated to produce the proper degree of concentration.</p>
<p>The following remarks, which bear closely on this subject,
were published on the 1st of July 1828, in the <i>South African
Commercial Advertiser</i>; which journal is conducted by an
Englishman of first-rate intelligence and ability, and intimately
acquainted with the colony. They well deserve your Lordship's
most earnest attention.</p>
<p>"The white population at present is estimated at about 70,000.
In 1806, it was not more than 27,000. From a variety of causes,
some permanent, others accidental, they have been <i>scattered
over a larger space than was consistent with mutual aid and
support</i>. This retarded the progressive division of labour,
and exposed the solitary settler to many dangers and privations
which did not operate beneficially on his habits of industry.
Instead of trying how much produce of every kind they could
raise, they were rather led to consider on how little they could
possibly subsist. The limits of the settlement being perhaps too
rapidly extended, rendered defence, rather than cultivation, the
chief object of public attention. It is not meant that the
settlers should have been crowded together. The nature of the
colony rendered that impossible. But for some time no moderation
was observed in this respect, and a <i>great waste of capital and
misapplication of labour and strength</i> were the consequence.
The increase of population, provided the boundaries be now fixed
and adhered to, will gradually correct this evil, and bring both
labour and a market more and more <i>within the reach of the
farmer</i>. "If these views of the colony be near the truth, it
will be worth considering whether, when new settlers are to be
provided for, it would not be better to select locations for them
in detail as near the coast, the villages, and Cape Town, as
there can be found, than to set them down <i>in masses by
themselves on the outskirts of the colony</i>, or beyond its
peopled limits, in such situations they are not merely useless,
but a burden to the community for many years&mdash;requiring new
and expensive establishments for their protection, besides
<i>wasting their own means in fruitless undertakings</i>, begun
from mere ignorance of the real resources of the country. There
appears to be abundance of unappropriated land, or at least of
unoccupied, or, at all events, of uncultivated land, in most of
the districts, on which many thousands of industrious people
might be placed most advantageously to the old inhabitants, and
with a much surer prospect of providing for themselves and their
families all the necessaries of life, than <i>in those remote
places to which the stream of emigration is too often
directed</i>. It is true, the best places in those districts have
fallen to the lot of the first settlers. <i>But locations of the
second, third, or fourth quality, as regards the soil, &amp;c.,
near a good road or a town, may exceed in value, a thousand fold,
those of the first description, which possess no such
advantages</i>."</p>
<p>I would especially draw your Lordship's attention to the last
few lines of the above quotation, and suggest that you should
apply them to the doctrines of Colonel <span class=
"a">Torrens</span> and Mr. <span class="a">Wilmot Horton</span>,
put forth in the published "Controversy" between those gentlemen
and the Colonization Society. I should but weaken the other
statements and arguments of the South African writer, by dwelling
on them further.</p>
<p>But there is one other point relating to South Africa, on
which I must offer a few observations. To the shame of England be
it said, <span class="a">Slavery</span> is still maintained in
South Africa. As to the West Indies, the question of emancipation
is full of difficulty. But, in my humble opinion&mdash;and I have
diligently studied the subject&mdash;you, Lord <span class=
"a">Howick</span>, or, at all events, the individual Lord
<span class="a">Goderich</span>, may, by the stroke of a pen,
abolish slavery in South Africa, and without the least particle
of injury to any person whatsoever. In what way? Simply
thus:&mdash;Let the new regulations for granting land in Van
Diemen's Land and New South Wales be at once applied to all our
South African settlements: add to those regulations an article,
declaring that all the money obtained by the sale of land shall
be employed in conveying <i>free labour</i> to the
colony&mdash;and employed, too, so as to produce the greatest
amount of emigration at the least cost; that is to say, by giving
a passage cost free to young couples of both sexes in preference
to other applicants.</p>
<p>This system of colonization, if honestly administered, must
necessarily cause a substitution of free labour for slave labour;
a delightful change, which would take place gradually, so as to
prevent any danger from suddenly breaking the chains of a slave
population; and a change, moreover, which would prove of the
highest advantage to the colonial capitalist and
land-owner,&mdash;inasmuch as free labour, when there is enough
of it to be used in combination, is very much cheaper than slave
labour; and, all slave-owners in the colony being land-owners,
they would gain more by the rapid and great increase of free
population, than they could lose by the gradual extinction of the
slave's value as a producing machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am wrong in saying that so great and glorious a
purpose might be effected by a stroke of your Lordship's, or Lord
<span class="a">Goderich's</span> pen. The regulations which I
propose must be guaranteed by something more than having at the
bottom of them, "Colonial Office, February * * 1831."</p>
<p>Some remarks on Canada must needs be reserved for my next
letter.</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. VII.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES.</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">17th February 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;But for Mr. <span class=
"a">Wilmot Horton's</span> intended emigration to Ceylon, I
should hardly have dared to make any allusion to Canada; and even
though I had been so fortunate as to offer suggestions of value,
your Lordship would probably have hesitated to adopt one of them,
at the risk of an "interlocutory argument" with the lecturer on
political economy at the Mechanics' Institution. For many years
past, Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span> has claimed a sort of
property in the management of Canada; and various Governments
have it would appear, allowed the claim, by abandoning that
colony to the right honourable gentleman, as a field for his
experiments in the cruel art of pauper location. At first sight,
the claim appears a droll one; but, upon reflection, your
Lordship will perceive, that any man, who should get a seat in
the House of Commons and make himself troublesome, might easily
become the patron and disposer of any colony not represented in
Parliament. Thus, Mr. <span class="a">Grey Bennett</span>
formerly patronized New South Wales; and dire confusion he made
of it, with his Mr. Commissioner <span class=
"a">Bigge</span>&mdash;whose Report, with the measures founded
thereon, produced that burning jealousy and furious hatred which
now divide the colonists as though they were Dutchmen and
Belgians. So again, Mr. <span class="a">Barrow</span>, though
without a seat in Parliament, but armed with his quarto book of
travels and his <i>Quarterly Review</i>, asserted, and
successfully for many years, an exclusive right to the
promulgation of ideas concerning South Africa. But who cared for
these monopolies of interference with the colonies, so long as
neither Mr. <span class="a">Bennett</span>, nor Mr. <span class=
"a">Barlow</span>, nor Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span>
attempted to diminish the patronage of the Colonial
Office?&mdash;which, by the way, each of them helped to increase.
The unfortunate colonists&mdash;"la gent corvéable et taillable à
merci et miséricorde," governed by the maxim, "si vent <i>le
gouverneur</i>, si vent la loi"&mdash;were proud and happy that
any body here should take any sort of interest in their concerns;
and the only wonder is, not that the gentlemen above-named were
allowed to play tricks with the colonies, but that any body
residing in England should trouble his head about those generally
despised portions of the empire. Better times, however, are
arrived. Canada has, though I admit through mere accident, one
excellent representative in Parliament,&mdash;Mr. <span class=
"a">Labouchere</span>; whilst the British subjects of South
Africa and Australia will not in vain beseech the son of Earl
<span class="a">Grey</span> to bestow on them trial by jury and
local representation. The very pride of your noble-father, if you
inherit it, must incline you to protect those who implore your
pity from such oppression as distinguished the reign of a late
governor of South Africa, or the more vulgar tyranny of an
"Excellency" in New South Wales.</p>
<p>But to return to the waste land of Canada. Mr. <span class=
"a">Horton</span> being out of the way, a humble person like
myself may venture on his emigration-ground without fear of being
treated as a poacher in political economy. In Lower Canada, then,
the power of the Government to dispose of waste land has been so
lamentably abused, that a rational system of colonization cannot,
to any great extent, be adopted in that province. Though great
part of the land remain waste, and the natural fertility of no
inconsiderable portion of it have been destroyed, the Government
has no longer any power to dispose of it. Take, for example, the
still waste island of Prince Edward, the property in which is
nearly equally divided between the Lords <span class=
"a">Melville</span> and <span class="a">Westmoreland</span>. Here
nothing can be done by the judicious use of that element of
colonization, the disposal of waste land by the state; and this
is but a sample of the condition of the greater part of the Lower
Canada territory. In some districts, indeed, the Government still
retains portions of waste land; but it would be dreaming to
indulge a hope that such land will be readily <i>sold</i>, even
for 5<i>s</i>. per acre, whilst so many millions of acres in the
hands of individuals remain open to purchase at a much lower
price. We must, therefore, for the present, dismiss Lower Canada
from our consideration;&mdash;though I intend to take a future
opportunity of suggesting to your Lordship a simple' and, I
believe, unobjectionable means, for preventing the profusion of
past Governments in the disposal of land in the Lower Province,
from mischievously interfering with the sale of land in Upper
Canada.</p>
<p>Turning to Upper Canada, there is still much to regret on the
score of past profusion; but the existing disproportion between
appropriated territory and the demand for its use will be easily
cured, if time and fortune should conspire to keep Lord
<span class="a">Howick</span> in office, and Mr. <span class=
"a">Twiss</span> out, for two years to come. I mention so short a
period on the assumption, however, that the system of universal
sale at a fixed minimum price, lately adopted for New South
Wales, will be extended to the Canadas, and that the whole fund
obtained by the sale of land will be spent in the cheapest sort
of emigration.</p>
<p>It is matter of surprise with some, that the system of
selling, instead of squandering, should not have been applied to
the Canadas in the first instance, rather than to New South
Wales;&mdash;seeing that, in the immediate neighbourhood of the
Canadas, the system has been pursued for many years with
incalculable advantage to those who had the benefit of it;
whereas, in New South Wales, nothing of the kind was ever
contemplated for a moment,&mdash;or will be, until the colonists
shall receive your Lordship's new Regulations. I allude to the
almost universal sale of land at a fixed minimum price in the
States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Ohio, and the
Michigan territory, all adjoining the Canadian provinces. It
would be easy to cull from not less than a hundred volumes,
instructive accounts of the advantages which the Americans owe to
a uniform system in the disposal of new land by the Government. I
take one at random,&mdash;from the book of a plain man, who,
though prejudiced in favour of Canada, deserves entire credit for
his statements of fact.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="a">Joseph Pickering</span>, late of Fenny
Stratford, in his Narrative of a Sojourn in America from 1824
to-1830, says, at page 37&mdash;"I am once again under the
jurisdiction of the British Government and laws, and therefore
feel myself no longer an alien. Though the Americans in general
are civil and friendly, still an Englishman, himself a stranger
amongst them, is annoyed and disgusted by their vaunts of prowess
in the late puny war, and superiority over all other nations; and
they assume it as a self-evident fact, that the Americans surpass
all others in virtue, wisdom, valour, liberty, government, and
every other excellence. Yet, much as the Americans deserve
ridicule for this foible, still I admire the energy and
enterprize everywhere exhibited, and regret the apathy of the
British Government with regard to the improvement of this
province. A single glance down the banks of the Niagara tells on
which side the most efficient government has resided. On the
United States side, <i>large towns springing up; the numerous
shipping with piers to protect them in harbour; coaches rattling
along the road; and trade evidence by waggons, carts, horses, and
people on foot in various directions</i>. On the Canadian side,
although in the immediate vicinity, an <i>older</i> settlement,
and apparently <i>better</i> land, there are <i>only two or three
stores, a tavern or two, a natural harbour without piers, but few
vessels, and two temporary landing-places</i>."</p>
<p>To what is this most striking difference between the progress
of American and of Canadian colonization to be attributed? In
some measure, no doubt, to the fact, that a great portion of the
Americans who migrate from the Eastern coast to settle on the
outskirts of civilization in the West, are <i>young couples</i>,
in the highest vigour of mind and body, and impelled to the
greatest exertions, by that desire for reaching an improved
condition and obtaining the means of supporting future offspring,
which distinguishes the time of marriage. But the difference
between American and Canadian settlers in this respect, will by
no means account for the superior progress of the Americans. Nor
is it explained by their greater skill in handling the axe, their
speculative turn, or their democratic institutions. It is owing
to this&mdash;that, with them, the appropriation of new land is a
perfectly <span class="a">Free Trade</span>, <i>secured by
law</i>; every one having a right to appropriate as much land as
he desires, on giving for it a price high enough to prevent him
from leaving his property in a desert state, to the injury of
others; whilst, in Canada, the appropriation of new land has
proceeded in twenty different ways at the same time; by purchase;
by engaging to make roads and pay quit-rents, neither of which
were made or paid, unless the governor or one of his officers had
a spite against the grantee; by "Crown Reserves" and "Clergy
Reserves;" by gift to disbanded soldiers, American royalists,
English lords, and the Governor's parasites; by profusion here,
parsimony there, and corruption in a third place; by the mere
pleasure, in a word, of his Excellency Sir John at one time; and,
what makes the case worse, by the perhaps opposite pleasure of
his Excellency Sir Thomas at another. The statements of Mr.
<span class="a">Pickering</span> are hereby abundantly explained.
Nay, we may presume, that if the appropriation of land by
individuals did not take the land in some measure out of the
Governor's control, Upper Canada would have languished like the
Lower Province, where the seigneurs, each of whom being a
"governor" of his own extensive seigneurie, were forbidden to
alienate their mischievous power over the land. True it is, that
the governor of Upper Canada does exercise some very injurious
control as to the value of <i>appropriated</i> land, by
determining, according to his mere whim, the sites of towns, for
example, the direction of roads, the situation of other public
works, and the districts in which, and the extent to which,
future appropriation shall take place. But though his Excellency
(I speak not in particular of the present Governor, with whose
name I am unacquainted) does thus occasion the most curious, and
to some not less fatal, as to others not less fortunate,
variations, fluctuations, or convulsions, in the value of the
land, capital, and labour of certain districts,&mdash;still, as
the Colonists have some power of managing their own affairs in
their own way, the interference in question is not very hurtful,
when compared with that which the Governor exercises in the
appropriation of new land generally. This last is the grand curse
of Upper Canada; as it has been that of all modern colonies,
excepting only the Western settlements of America, which are, in
every sense of the word, colonies of the older settlements in the
East.</p>
<p>Can your Lordship hesitate about bestowing upon Canada the
great blessing of a national, fixed, and uniform system in the
disposal of waste land? I shall listen with extreme curiosity and
interest to the observations with which you may, on Tuesday next,
introduce "a Bill for the purpose of facilitating Settlements in
his Majesty's Foreign Possessions." The House of Commons will,
probably, turn a deaf ear to your Lordship's speech; unless,
indeed, you should propose some extension of Parliamentary
patronage, or some taxation of the landed interest for the
benefit of the miserable and debased peasantry. In the former
case, you will be greeted with "loud cheers;" in the latter, you
will be treated as a bore, and called <span class="a">Wilmot
Horton</span> the Second. But, at all events, you will not labour
under the disadvantage which constantly attended Mr. <span class=
"a">Horton</span>,&mdash;that of profound ignorance on his own
favourite and peculiar subject. And I make a false estimate of
your talents, knowledge, and intentions, if your proposal be not
conveyed, through the gallery, to three New Britains in America,
Africa, and the Pacific, and there received with transport;
returning, by-and-by, when your system of Colonization shall be
perfected, to obtain for you the gratitude of millions here.</p>

<h3>[LETTERS ON THE COLONIES&mdash;No. VIII.*]</h3>
<br>
<p class="foot">[* Also TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR THE COLONIES. NOTE: This letter has no heading; it
follows immediately on from No. VII.]</p>
<br>
<div class="date">18th February 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;I am urged, by persons
much interested about the Bill for Colonization which your
Lordship will propose to the House of Commons on Tuesday next, to
lay before you some further illustration of the expediency and
facility of converting the waste land of Canada into a means of
improving the condition of the labouring classes in Britain.</p>
<p>The immediate practical question is&mdash;whether the sale of
new land in Canada may provide a fund for the purposes of
Emigration, without having recourse to taxation either in England
or Ireland?</p>
<p>As respects the sale of waste land, there is in Upper Canada
an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, to which I am most desirous of
drawing your Lordship's attention,&mdash;I mean the Canada Land
Company. This body of London merchants lately purchased of the
Government 2,484,413 acres of wild land. Their contract permits
them to pay for the land by degrees; and they have already paid
for 415,000 acres, at the average price of 2<i>s</i>.
10½<i>d</i>. per acre. The land consists of what used to be
called the <i>Crown Reserves</i>, being detached lots of about
200 acres each, scattered through the different townships of the
province; secondly, of <i>blocks of land</i>, containing from
1000 to 40,000 acres each, situated in the western districts of
the province; and thirdly, of the <i>Huron Territory</i>, being a
tract of 1,100,000 acres, in the shape of a triangle, of which
the base is sixty miles in length.</p>
<p>Now, as to that great quantity of land, the Company has, in
point of fact, taken the place of the Government; but with this
difference, that the Company has paid, or will have to pay, for
its land, and that it labours under certain disadvantages from
which the Government was free. What, then, has been done by the
little government within the great one? Of the 415,000 acres for
which it paid to the Great Government, 57,500<i>l</i>, at the
rate of 2<i>s</i>. 10½<i>d</i>. per acre, it has resold 110,000
acres for 51,600<i>l</i>., at the rate of 9<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.
per acre. Why should not the Great Government have sold the same
land at the rate of 9<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. instead of 2<i>s</i>.
10½<i>d</i>. per acre? Mr. <span class="a">Wilmot Horton</span>
who, then filling your Lordship's place, and acting on behalf of
the Great Government, made so bad a bargain with the Little
Government, ought to answer that question before his departure
for Ceylon. Meanwhile, I will answer it, thus&mdash;The Little
Government, having paid for its land, knew the value of the
property, and therefore turned it to the best account; whereas
the Great Government has always been ignorant and reckless in the
disposal of its enormous and invaluable territorial
possessions.</p>
<p>By the last accounts from Canada, it appears that the sales of
the Company's lands are proceeding rapidly, and at an enhanced
price; and those who are best acquainted with the subject, have
no doubt that the whole territory of the Company may ultimately
be resold for at least 1<i>l</i>. per acre. If so, the difference
between the results of intelligence and prudence and ignorance
and improvidence will be highly instructive&mdash;for
example:</p>

</table>
<p>But peculiar praise is due to the Little Government, since it
labours ander disadvantages from which the Great Government was
free. It exists in the midst of the Great Government, of which
the ignorant recklessness exerts a most injurious influence on
all traders in land. Imagine the sagacious Company to see plainly
that, for the greatest progress of settlement, wealth, and
civilization, on the Huron Territory, it would be right to make
1<i>l</i>. per acre the minimum price to settlers. This may be
easily conceived, as I firmly believe it to be true. But of what
use will the conception he, so long as the Great Government shall
permit Sir John or Sir Thomas to squander the land, which, being
still the property of the state, adjoins the Huron Territory?
Then I observe, by the map which is attached to the last
published Report of the Company, that a great tract of land,
immediately adjoining the Huron Territory, is marked out as a
"Clergy Reserve." For the information of those who do not know
what that term means, I would explain, that it signifies a
declaration by the Government, that so much land shall remain in
a desert state, to the incalculable injury of the settlers around
the reserve, who, by it, are prevented from communicating with
each other. Thus, your Lordship will perceive, that the Company
must be constantly thwarted in its proceedings, by the profusion
on the one hand, and the very opposite of profusion on the other,
of that great, ignorant, corrupt, and blundering Land Company,
the British Government. And it will be equally clear to you, that
the Government might, merely by the exertion of a rational will,
sell land much more advantageously than this Company, whose
operations it now so hurtfully counteracts or disturbs.</p>
<p>However, the Company will for many years to come pay, at the
least, 19,000<i>l</i>. a year to the Government, as the
purchase-money of waste land. Why should not that fund be devoted
to defraying the cost of the cheapest sort of emigration from
Britain to the colony? Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span> shall
answer.</p>
<p>By reference to that person's evidence before the Select
Committee on the Civil Government of Canada, I find that great
part of the 19,000<i>l</i>. a year has been disposed of in all
sorts of jobs, of which some examples follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>8,500<i>l</i>. a year, for the "Civil Government of Canada."
The further disposition of this sum is not
explained&mdash;400<i>l</i>., 750<i>l</i>., and 750<i>l</i>. a year,
in salaries to a Bishop and certain clergymen&mdash;400<i>l</i>. a
year, as a pension to Colonel <span class="a">Talbot</span> (a
<i>protégé</i> of Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span>, I
believe)&mdash;2,566<i>l</i>. a year for seven years, as "compensation"
to certain officers of the land-granting department, for the loss
of&mdash;what would a plain man guess?&mdash;"their emoluments."
This "loss of emoluments" was, I suppose, a loss of the power to
job and play tricks with that portion of the waste land of Canada
which had been assigned to the Company. The stature of the loss
may be explained by the following passage of Mr. <span class=
"a">Hodgson's</span> "Letters from North America," vol. ii., page
47. "The surveyors receive their compensation in land, and
generally <i>secure the most valuable portions</i>. When I was in
Canada, they would sell their best lots for one dollar per acre;
while 13<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>., the fee on one hundred acres,
amount to more than half a dollar per acre. I never met with
<i>any one person amongst all those with whom I conversed on the
subject</i>, who did not agree, that, if a settler had but a very
little money, it would be much more to his advantage to buy land,
than to receive it from the Government."</p>
<p>For a long while, I could not understand Mr. <span class=
"a">Horton's</span> zealous animosity to the plan of the
Colonization Society, and especially to that part of it which
suggested the employment of money, derived from the sale of land,
in carrying labour to the colony. But the mystery is now cleared
up.</p>
<p>Still, is this disposition of the yearly receipts of
Government from the Canada Company irrevocable? If not, the
Government may, sooner or later, devote to the cost of emigration
the amount of the Company's payment-for
land&mdash;viz.&mdash;482,134<i>l</i>. from which sum, however, must
be deducted what Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span> has thrown
away.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Emigration Fund</span> might be increased
from another source,&mdash;viz., the fees received by the
Government for grants of land. I have in vain endeavoured to
ascertain the amount of such payments. The late Administration
pretended that there were no means of discovering the exact
amount; and Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span>, I am told,
contends, and is, using his favourite expression, "prepared to
show," that the public has no right to ask questions about a fund
which is as much the "private property of the Crown" as the
revenues of the Dutchy of Lancaster. <i>Therefore</i>, his
Excellency the Governor of Ceylon would tax the over-taxed people
of England for the relief which may be afforded by
emigration.</p>
<p>Whatever may be said of the last-mentioned source of relief to
the miserable labouring classes of Britain, applies, and with
greater force, to another means of increasing the <span class=
"a">Emigration Fund</span>,&mdash;I mean the <i>quit-rents</i>
payable in South Africa, New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land, and
the two Canadas. These amount, I have reason to believe, to a
very large sum. If the quit-rents agreed for by grantees be not
paid, that is the fault of the Government; but that they might be
regularly paid, and with great advantage to the grantees, is to
my mind unquestionable,&mdash;provided always, that the money
received on that account by the Government were expended in
increasing the Colonial population, and enhancing, incalculably,
the value of Colonial land. Tho difficulty which the Government
has hitherto experienced in collecting quit-rents, has arisen
from the poverty of the settlers; the poverty of the settlers has
arisen from this&mdash;that almost every man laboured for himself
and by himself, so that the production of capital and labour was
as small as possible, instead of being, as it might have been, as
great as possible, through the <i>combination of capital and
labour</i> and the primary cause of this series of evil causes,
was the irrational mode, or rather modes, of granting land
pursued by the Government.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have, as the source of an <span class=
"a">Emigration Fund</span>, the universal sale of new land at a
fixed minimum price. This system&mdash;for it really deserves to
be so called&mdash;your Lordship has already adopted as to New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. What reason is there against
its being extended to Canada? Mr. <span class="a">Horton</span>
may be "prepared to show" a thousand reasons; but why so much
preparation? His Excellency's Essay upon Land-granting has been
promised by advertisement in the papers, for above two mouths. I,
myself, have sent for it not less than half-a-dozen times; and
have always received for answer at the bookseller's, that it
would be published in a few days. But, perhaps, Mr. <span class=
"a">Horton</span> has changed his opinions as to the manner in
which. the very foundation of Colonization ought to be laid;
perhaps he now agrees with the Colonization Society, and does not
intend to answer Mr. <span class="a">Tennant</span>.</p>
<p>I have mentioned four sources from which the <span class=
"a">Emigration Fund</span> might be derived,&mdash;1st, payments
by the Canada Company to the Government; 2nd, fees paid for
grants; 3rd, quit-rents; and 4th, the universal sale of land at a
fixed minimum price according to the system pursued by the United
States. It is plain that, if the last great measure be adopted,
no more fees for grants will be received. The receipts, however,
from the Canada Company and from quit-rents, would be greatly
augmented. An estimate of what might be derived from the main
source of all, may be formed by reference to the actual receipts
of the United States on account of the sale of land. I have heard
that the United States obtain about 1,500,000<i>l</i>. a year by
the sale of new land. Surely, if this estimate be not far wide of
the truth, the British Government may promote emigration without
having recourse to the poor's-rate.</p>
<p>Trusting that this wildest of Mr. <span class=
"a">Horton's</span> wild schemes will form, no part of your
Lordship's proposal on Tuesday next,</p>

<h3>REPRESENTATION OF THE COLONIES.&mdash;No. IX.</h3>
<br>
<h4>TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE
COLONIES.</h4>
<div class="date">3d March 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;<span class="a">As</span>
the measure of Reform brought forward by the Government will very
greatly improve the representation of this country, so surely
will it deprive the Colonies of the representation, such as it
is, which they now enjoy in the Imperial Parliament. I propose to
lay before your Lordship the grounds of this assertion.</p>
<p>The number of members representing "the East India Interest"
is 62. These consist principally of directors of the Company,
proprietors of stock, East India agents, and servants of the
Company. "The West India Interest" is represented by 34 members,
most of whom are proprietors of estates and slaves in one or
other of the Anglo-American islands. Canada being a poor colony,
and contributing but little to the wealth of the empire, has but
two members&mdash;Mr. <span class="a">Edward Ellice</span> and
Mr. <span class="a">Labouchere</span>&mdash;whilst South Africa
and Australasia are represented, very inadequately I admit, by
about six members, owners of estates in those colonies, or
merchants trading with the Cape of Good Hope and New South Wales.
Of the 103 members so representing the white inhabitants of the
East and West Indies and of South Africa, and the whole
population of the Canadas and the Australasian settlements,
nearly three-fourths are returned by the boroughs which it is
proposed either to disfranchise or to dock of one member. Perhaps
not one out of twenty of these will be members of a parliament
elected as the Government has proposed. The others including Mr.
<span class="a">Labouchere</span>, for example, are members for
boroughs which would be "opened" by the bill before Parliament;
and very few of these would be again returned if that bill should
pass. The excellent "Anatomy of the House of Commons," published
in the <span class="a">Spectator</span>, 1st January, 1831,
states that the "influence" which prevails at Taunton is "money."
Will Mr. <span class="a">Labouchere</span> be again returned for
Taunton by that influence? I think not; and so think the people
of England, who are now shouting their approbation of the
Government plan of Reform.</p>
<p>Who then would represent the Colonies in a reformed House of
Commons? No one&mdash;is the unavoidable answer. But, say those
who are totally ignorant of the state of the Colonies, "The
Colonies have Legislative Assemblies of their own&mdash;why
should they be represented in the Imperial Parliament also?" I
answer&mdash;The colonial Legislative Assemblies are merely local
councils subject to the control of the Imperial Parliament, and
frequently controlled by it in affairs of the greatest
importance. I need not trouble your Lordship with illustrations
fact which every one at all acquainted with the Colonies will
instantly admit. Moreover, South Africa and Australasia have no
Legislative Assemblies. The local councils, which they do
possess, are productive of injury rather than benefit, inasmuch
as those councils, being composed only of the creatures of the
Local Government, are a <i>means of oppression</i>, which no
governor on his single responsibility would dare to practise.</p>
<p>The above statement will be used as an argument against the
Government plan of Reform; but the argument is worth nothing,
unless Sir <span class="a">Robert Inglis</span> and Mr.
<span class="a">Hart Davis</span> should first establish the
expediency of mock-representation at home, in order that the
Colonies may be indirectly, slightly,&mdash;nay, miserably
represented. Let members who are interested in the Colonies
propose an adequate representation of those worst-governed
portions of the empire; and the appeal will probably receive
attention from the present Government of public opinion. You, my
Lord, being the first Colonial Minister that ever spoke in
Parliament of the "shameful jobbing" which takes place in the
Colonies, might very appropriately become the author of an
efficient check to such abominations. I long to observe the
convulsions into which a proposal of the kind, made in Parliament
by the son of our reforming Premier, would throw Sir <span class=
"a">George Murray</span> and Mr. <span class="a">Twiss</span>;
but how much greater would be your satisfaction when, the measure
carried into effect, deputies should come to you from all parts
of the world charged with expressions of gratitude and affection
from millions of your fellow-subjects!</p>
<p>There are two modes of bestowing adequate representation on
the Colonies&mdash;First, That of establishing everywhere
Legislative Assemblies, elected by the inhabitants at large, and
giving to those assemblies a supreme authority in whatever
concerns the colony only. Secondly, That of permitting each
colony to send deputies to the Imperial Parliament. <span class=
"a">Adam Smith</span> has thoroughly examined both modes of
proceeding. After thus referring to his admirable Treatise on the
subject, I have only farther to observe, that if the Colonial
Minister of that day had listened to his generous suggestions,
the present United States would, probably, even up to this time
have formed part of the British empire.</p>
<p>I am tempted in concluding this letter, to express my
satisfaction at the rejection of Mr. <span class="a">Wilmot
Horton's</span> Emigration Bill by universal public opinion; and
to promise that, in case the public should not be made aware of
little share which your Lordship took in framing that obnoxious
measure, the whole truth shall be laid before them as soon as the
present excitement about Reform shall have subsided.</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES.</h3>
<br>
<h4>ADDRESSED TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
THE COLONIES.<br>
<br>
<span class="a">Letter X.&mdash;Swing's Reappearance in
Kent</span>.</h4>
<div class="date">1st June 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;I venture to congratulate
your Lordship and our Colonial brethren on the announcement, that
your predecessor Mr. <span class="a">Horace Twiss</span> has
resumed his wig and bag in the Court of Chancery. Such as he,
then, even they themselves are assured, will never again be
allowed to play tricks with the Colonies. For this, thanks to the
Reform Bill! The Reform Bill interrupted my letters to your
Lordship; and it is the Reform Bill which leads me to renew the
correspondence. The excitement occasioned by the Ministerial
proposal of Reform rendered the public careless of every other
matter; but now that the question is settled&mdash;now that all
men are confident of the success of the national cause, people
are beginning to look for some of the fruits of Reform. Of all
the good things which it is hoped that Reform will bestow on us,
none, perhaps, is so earnestly desired and confidently expected
as some decided improvement in the condition of the lowest and
most numerous class. Upon this point, therefore, a few remarks
will not be out of time.</p>
<p>There are two other reasons why the time for recurring to this
subject should not appear to be ill-chosen,&mdash;viz. the famine
in Ireland, and the revival of <span class="a">Swing</span> fires
in those parts of the South of England where wages have been
again brought down to the lowest rate short of starvation.
Notwithstanding the absorbing nature of the Reform question, the
reports front Ireland of starvings to death, deaths by the typhus
or hunger fever, and life sustained by sea-weeds, together with
the revived chalkings of <span class="a">Swing</span> on the
wails at Dover, will fix public attention on the condition of the
great body of the people.</p>
<p>The great body of the people&mdash;for so we may call the
needy competitors for land in Ireland, and for wages in
England&mdash;these, the three parts in four of the community,
have been led to expect that the Reform Bill will produce a
sudden and marked improvement of their condition. The poor
ignorant creatures! Do I so call them, scornfully? God forbid!
But they are poor and ignorant,&mdash;so pour as to long for
change as fat men dying long to live, and so ignorant its to
believe that the evils under which they labour will he suddenly
cured by an act of Parliament for changing our system of
representation! The competition for land in Ireland, and for
wages in England, to be instantly cured by a Reform Bill! This is
what they mean when they cry&mdash;"Reform for ever! God bless
the King and his Ministers!" This is what <i>they confidently
expect</i>. It was for the purpose of obtaining this, that they
unanimously supported Lord <span class="a">Grey's</span>
Cabinet&mdash;with the grand converting argument which the
Quarterly Review calls "dread of physical force." It is for this
that they are now waiting; appearing, meanwhile, starved though
they be in Ireland, and not far from starved in England, still
the most loyal people in the world. This, on which their souls
are bent, as the instant consequence of Reform,&mdash;viz. good
wages in England, and low rents in Ireland,&mdash;this, my Lord,
we are perfectly sure that Reform will not bestow on them. That
then must happen?</p>
<p>Let us suppose the worst&mdash;renewed Anti-Union agitation in
Ireland, and <span class="a">Swing</span> travelling
industriously through the rural parts of England; whilst the
working classes of the English towns make up their quarrel with
<span class="a">Hunt</span>, and take as their leaders, instead
of Earl <span class="a">Grey</span> and the Chancellor, that same
<span class="a">Hunt, Cobbett</span>, and men of their kidney.
"Well, and what then?" says one of the comfortable middle class
to whom the Bill gives a vote&mdash;" suppose they should be
savage once more, can't-we keep them down?" I
answer&mdash;yes&mdash;you may keep them down: you probably would
keep them down. But is Reform to end in <i>a system of keeping
down?</i> If so, what are we shouting for? and for what are we
persuading these poor devils to shout?</p>
<p>It is, I believe, plain to most reflecting men, that Reform
must be speedily followed by a system of keeping down, unless the
Government should find some means of curing the excessive
competition for land in Ireland and for wages in England,
<i>before disappointment shall again exasperate the lowest and
most numerous class against all above themselves</i>. It would be
bad enough if the system of keeping down were to last tea years;
though not so bad, some will think, as another possible
event,&mdash;that is, the successful rising up of the lowest
class, and the tumbling down of the higher classes. For my own
part, I doubt the power of any class to cope with the middle
class, when the latter is in earnest. I will not, therefore,
suppose a rebellion of the discontented lowest class, but will
state, as the worst that can happen, a lasting system of keeping
down. Is this had enough? Ten years of it would be bad enough.
Yet how are we to limit the evil to ten years? Being kept down,
implies being miserable, and therefore ignorant. The miserable
and the ignorant want the respect for property and the knowledge
which are considered indispensable qualifications for enjoying
the elective franchise. The middle class, therefore, to which
Earl <span class="a">Grey's</span> Reform Bill transfers the
whole power of making laws, will not bestow the franchise on
those whom that middle class keeps down. Indeed, to bestow the
franchise on the miserable and ignorant lowest class, would be to
leave off keeping them down, or rather to let them tumble you
down. It would appear, then, that a system of keeping-down,
applied by the middle to the lowest class, must last for ever,
unless suddenly overthrown by a revolt of the slaves. A revolt of
the slaves against every other class, though a possible, is not a
probable event. I assume, therefore, as the very worst, a system,
but a lasting system, of keeping down.</p>
<p>In this black prospect there is one little ray of light, which
may perhaps be nursed into broad sunshine for all. "Find some
means," say philanthropists and philosophers, "find some means of
improving the condition, first bodily and then mental, of the
great mass: fatten them first with comfort for body and soul.
Next,&mdash;which will then be easy,&mdash;improve their morals
and give them knowledge. And lastly,&mdash;to which there will
then be no objection,&mdash;give them an equal share in the power
of making laws for all." A very pretty process with a beautiful
result!&mdash;but what is the grand agent wherewith to begin by
making the hungry sleek, and comforting the care-worn? In England
competition for wages, in Ireland competition for land, are the
immediate cause of misery. Is the discovery made? No; we must go
deeper. The cause of both competitions is excess of people, in
proportion to land in Ireland, and to employment in England. Find
a cure for this excess, and your object is gained. "We have it,"
say <span class="a">Malthus, Mill</span>, and <span class=
"a">M'Culloch</span>; "teach the people to practise <i>moral
restraint</i>, and the fatal excess vanishes. Stop early
marriages, or let the marriages be less fruitful, and then the
dire competition for land and wages&mdash;the snatching of bread
out of each other's mouths&mdash;will be at an end with the great
body of the people. You may do this <span class="a">By
Teaching</span>."</p>
<p>Just so, one afflicted with dropsy was advised by his
physician as follows:&mdash;"You owe this complaint to want of
exercise; go take a walk; walk twenty miles a day; nothing can
save you but <span class="a">Walking</span>."</p>
<p>"Walking!" exclaims the patient; "why, I can't lift either
foot an inch from the ground: cure me this time by some other
means than walking, and, depend on it, I will keep off the dropsy
in the way you propose; but at present I am unable to stir."</p>
<p>"I can't help that," rejoins the physician; "I tell you that
the only cure for your complaint is <i>walking!</i>"</p>
<p>In like manner, Messrs. <span class="a">Malthus, Mill</span>,
and <span class="a">M'Culloch</span> reason in a circle, and I
had almost said talk nonsense, when they preach&mdash;"The end
being to fatten and comfort the people, in order that they may be
made sufficiently moral and instructed to enjoy equal rights, the
means is moral instruction: the end being to teach the people,
the means is teaching."</p>
<p>What little knowledge I possess of the subject on which I am
writing, I have derived from the instruction of Messrs.
<span class="a">Malthus, Mill</span>, and <span class=
"a">M'Culloch</span>. I am bound to speak of them, therefore,
with the respect in which they are held by the thousands who have
profited by their labours. But it would be blind and ridiculous
adulation to say of them, that they are infallible; and cowardly
to shrink from attacking one of their doctrines, which they
themselves have taught me to think erroneous.</p>
<p>"Teaching," then, it appears to me, is no more a cure for the
misery of the people than is "walking" a cure for the dropsy.
Cure the dropsy first, and then enjoin walking as a preventative.
Cure misery first, and then leach, in order to prevent the return
of misery. Feed the hungry; clothe the naked; still the pains of
physical want; stop the cries of the children; comfort the
harassed mother, and give peace to the troubled soul of the
husband and father&mdash;then teach! The attempt to teach an
Irish family, whose food is sea-weed, or a Buckinghamshire
peasant, whose eyes are sunk in his heath and whose legs are mere
calfless spindles, would be as clever as the attempt to coax an
Alpine wolf after three months' snow. Fatten first, then teach!
The great question is&mdash;how may the poor creatures be made
ready for the <i>preventative</i> (not the cure) of Messrs.
<span class="a">Malthus, Mill</span>, and <span class=
"a">M'Culloch</span>?</p>
<p>Proposing to devote my next letter to the discussion of that
question,</p>

<h3>LETTERS ON THE COLONIES.&mdash;No. XI.</h3>
<br>
<h4>ADDRESSED TO VISCOUNT HOWICK, UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
THE COLONIES.</h4>
<br>
<div class="date">8th June 1831.</div>
<p><span class="a">My Lord</span>&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"Fatten first; then teach! The great question
is-how may the poor creatures be made ready for the
<i>preventative</i> (not the cure) of Messrs. <span class=
"a">Malthus, Mill</span>, and <span class=
"a">M'Culloch</span>?"</p>
<p>The first difference between the great Political Economists
named. above, and the humble citizen who addresses you, is
this&mdash;that, whereas they allege teaching to be a cure, as
well as a preventative, of misery, I venture to contend that it
is not a cure, but only a preventative, and one too which cannot
be applied until after a temporary cure shall have been effected
by some other means. "Teach first," say Messrs. <span class=
"a">Malthus, Mill</span>, and <span class=
"a">M'Culloch</span>&mdash;"teach first, and thereby fatten."
Fatten first, I make bold to suggest&mdash;fatten first; then
teach, and thereby <i>prevent the return</i> of misery.</p>
<p>Another difference between the Political Economists and myself
is, that they have never told us how to administer their
medicine,-how to instruct the minds of men whose stomachs are
devoured by the gastric juice; whereas "I am prepared to show,"
as Mr. <span class="a">Wilmot Horton</span> says, that my
prescription will administer itself, and will moreover, if it
should effect a cure, enable their prescription to do the
same.</p>
<p>The evil is excess of people, in proportion to employment in
England, and to land in Ireland. All that I propose is, to cure
that excess for fifteen years, or such longer or shorter period
as may be considered sufficient for administering the
preventative of "teaching."</p>
<p>How shall the proportion of people to land and employment be
beneficially altered for fifteen years? We cannot increase the
land; and we should find it hard to increase the employment
faster than the people would increase. Let us then diminish,
relatively, the number of people. The proportion of people to
laud and employment being maintained, for fifteen years, at the
point which should permit all the people to grow fat, instruction
might be administered, and then "moral restraint" would prevent
the return of misery.</p>
<p>How may the number of people be reduced, and kept down for
fifteen years, to the desired point of plenty and
comfort?&mdash;By applying one of the old-fashioned checks to
population, which, at some time or other, in nearly every part of
the world, have caused temporary abundance. Let us examine some
of them.</p>
<p>First&mdash;What think you of an act of Parliament forbidding
inoculation and vaccination? This would not do; because small-pox
attacks the rich as well as the poor.</p>
<p>Secondly&mdash;The deliberate introduction of <i>cholera
morbus</i> or the little plague? This disease is said to attack
the poor, principally; but then we could not stop its ravages at
pleasure. It might thin the people far beyond the point when
those who remained should all grow fat, and be taught "moral
restraint." We must not think of it, therefore.</p>
<p>Thirdly&mdash;A good bloody war? This very old-fashioned check
to population, though sanctified by "the wisdom of our
ancestors," and though it operate principally amongst the poor,
is still open to two main objections. In the first place, it
destroys capital as well as people, and might not, therefore,
alter beneficially the proportion of people to employment; and
secondly, it is very unfavourable to "teaching,"&mdash;the object
that we have in view. For example&mdash;<span class=
"a">Buonaparte</span> thinned the people of France, to the extent
of having half of her fields cultivated by women and children;
but he checked the accumulation of capital and the progress of
education in an equal degree; and the consequence was, that the
poorest classes in France gained nothing by his bloody wars.</p>
<p>Fourthly&mdash;There is a method of proceeding which would
<i>appear</i>, though it would not be, effectual, viz, putting
down the Newspapers. The ostrich pokes her head into the sand,
and believes that nobody can see her. If there were no
newspapers, we should hear little or nothing of the misery of the
great body of the people. Such ignorance would be bliss to the
philanthropist. The world would wag on as in the times of our
wise ancestors; vice and misery would keep down population to the
limit of subsistence; but we fat philanthropists should not be
troubled with daily accounts of the vice and the misery. "Where
ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise;"&mdash;let us put down
the Newspapers!</p>
<p>"No! no!" I hear Lord <span class="a">Howick</span> exclaim;
"on the contrary, my father's Administration is about to take off
the taxes on knowledge, so as to give Messrs. <span class=
"a">Malthus, Mill</span>, and <span class="a">M'Culloch</span> a
chance with their teaching.' The newspapers have increased, are
increasing, and ought to increase. Whatever the vice and misery
of the great mass of our countrymen, we shall know all about it.
We do know all about it by means of the newspapers. In this
respect, we of the ruling class are wiser than any rulers of any
country in any period of the world. In all times and all
countries (except some new colonies), excess of people in
proportion to land or employment has been the cause of vice and
misery amongst the million. In this country, at the present time,
the old cause produces the old effects. The only novelty of our
situation is, that we know all about it. May this knowledge,
possessed by the minority; speedily lead to the happiness of
all!"</p>
<p>I have made your Lordship utter my own cherished opinion. The
newspapers will go on increasing. It were needless, therefore, to
suggest a fifth check to population, viz, a strong bad
government. Oppression is a very, very old-fashioned, and an
equally vulgar method of keeping down population to the limit of
subsistence. The best example of modern times is to be found in
our West India Islands, where (Mr. <span class="a">Fowell
Buxton</span> is my authority) the population is gradually
diminished in due proportion to the gradual decrease of demand
for the produce of those islands. But why cite examples of
oppression as a check to population, when we have established
that newspapers will go on increasing? Let us come to the
point.</p>
<p>Lastly&mdash;<span class="a">Colonization</span>? A very
old-fashioned check this, but differing from all the others in
several main points. All the others check absolutely; but this,
whilst it checks in one place, causes increase in another. All
the others are positively cruel; this is comparatively humane,
since, though emigration be an evil, it is a great blessing when
compared with the vice and misery of remaining at home in excess.
All the others are fatal to "teaching;" this would be no
hindrance to the schoolmaster, and it would, moreover, provide
him with fat and comfortable pupils, whom it would be his
business to teach how they might remain fat and comfortable. The
only question then appears to be&mdash;Is there any mode of
colonization which shall remove from vice and misery to virtue
and happiness, a sufficient number of the people to cause fatness
and comfort for fifteen years amongst those who should remain
behind?</p>
<p>Most of the Political Economists have, indeed, asked this
question&mdash;answering it, however, dogmatically, in the same
breath. Not one of them has examined the question
philosophically. Read the chapter of <span class=
"a">Malthus</span> on Emigration, and the essay of <span class=
"a">Mill</span> on Colonization, and say whether those papers
display any of the laborious research, or of the earnest and
profound thought, for which the authors of them are
distinguished. Mr. <span class="a">Mill</span> says that the
question "deserves profound regard." Yet he disposes of it in a
few words; all but confining his essay to collateral
questions&mdash;such as <i>the government</i> of colonies, <i>the
trade</i> with colonies, and other matters of secondary
importance. The grand question of the utility of colonization as
a cure for excess of people, he scarcely touches; and, what is
remarkable, having just touched it, he flies off, <i>in an essay
on "Colonization</i>," to descant on moral restraint as the only
cure for excess of people. A description not much dissimilar from
this might be given of the writings of the other Economists on
colonization as a cure for excess of people. I will spare your
Lordship the repetition; but as the books are by your side, I may
ask that you will be pleased to look at them, in order to verify
what I have dared to say.&mdash;I offer "the truth" in
justification of my boldness.</p>
<p>The limits to which I am confined, compel me to close this
letter. In my next, I propose to state the circumstances, which,
as it appears to me, have led the Political Economists to treat
the subject of Colonization superficially; and, if there should
be room, to describe a mode of colonization by which the great
body of the people may be easily fattened and made comfortable
for fifteen years.</p>
