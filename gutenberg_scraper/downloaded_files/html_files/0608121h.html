  <br>

  <p class="first">MASKAT, like many another port, is a haven for the drifters
  of many nations who bring their tribal customs and peculiarities with them.
  Turk rubs shoulders with Greek and Arab squabbles with Hindoo. The tongues of
  half the Orient resound in the loud smelly bazaar. Therefore it did not seem
  particularly incongruous to hear, as I leaned on a bar tended by a smirking
  Eurasian, the musical notes of a Chinese gong sound clearly through the lazy
  hum of native traffic. There was certainly nothing so startling in those
  mellow tones that the big Englishman next me should start and swear and spill
  his whisky-and-soda on my sleeve.</p>

  <p>He apologized and berated his clumsiness with honest profanity, but I saw
  he was shaken. He interested me as his type always does&mdash;a fine
  upstanding fellow he was; over six feet tall, broad-shouldered,
  narrow-hipped, heavy-limbed, the perfect fighting man, brown-faced, blue-eyed
  and tawny-haired. His breed is old as Europe, and the man himself brought to
  mind vague legendary characters&mdash;Hengist, Hereward, Cerdic&mdash;born
  rovers and fighters of the original Anglo-Saxon stock.</p>

  <p>I saw, furthermore, that he was in a mood to talk. I introduced myself,
  ordered drinks and waited. My specimen thanked me, muttered to himself,
  quaffed his liquor hastily and spoke abruptly:</p>

  <p>"You're wondering why a grown man should be so suddenly upset by such a
  small thing&mdash;well, I admit that damned gong gave me a start. It's that
  fool Yotai Lao, bringing his nasty joss sticks and Buddhas into a decent town&mdash;for
  a half-penny I'd bribe some Moslem fanatic to cut his yellow
  throat and sink his confounded gong into the gulf. And I'll tell you why I
  hate the thing.</p>

  <p>"My name," said my Saxon, "is Bill Kirby. It was in Jibuti on the Gulf of
  Aden that I met John Conrad. A slim, keen-eyed young New Englander he
  was&mdash;professor too, for all his youth. Victim of obsession also, like most
  of his kind. He was a student of bugs, and it was a particular bug that had
  brought him to the East Coast; or rather, the hope of the blooming beast, for
  he never found it. It was almost uncanny to see the chap work himself into a
  blaze of enthusiasm when speaking on his favorite subject. No doubt he could
  have taught me much I should know, but insects are not among my enthusiasms,
  and he talked, dreamed and thought of little else at first...</p>

  <p>"Well, we paired off well from the start. He had money and ambitions and I
  had a bit of experience and a roving foot. We got together a small, modest
  but efficient safari and wandered down into the back country of Somaliland.
  Now you'll hear it spoken today that this country has been exhaustively
  explored and I can prove that statement to be a lie. We found things that no
  white man has ever dreamed of.</p>

  <p>"We had trekked for the best part of a month and had gotten into a part of
  the country I knew was unknown to the average explorer. The veldt and thorn
  forests gave way to what approached real jungle and what natives we saw were
  a thick-lipped, low-browed, dog-toothed breed&mdash;not like the Somali at
  all. We wandered on though, and our porters and askari began muttering among
  themselves. Some of the black fellows had been hobnobbing with them and
  telling them tales that frightened them from going on. Our men wouldn't talk
  to me or Conrad about it, but we had a camp servant, a half-caste named
  Selim, and I told him to see what he could learn. That night he came to my
  tent. We had pitched camp in a sort of big glade and had built a thorn boma;
  for the lions were raising merry Cain in the bush.</p>

  <p>"'Master,' said he in the mongrel English he was so proud of, 'them black
  fella he is scaring the porters and askari with bad ju-ju talk. They be tell
  about a mighty ju-ju curse on the country in which we go to, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"He stopped short, turned ashy, and my head jerked up. Out of the dim,
  jungle-haunted mazes of the south whispered a haunting voice. Like the echo
  of an echo it was, yet strangely distinct, deep, vibrant, melodious. I
  stepped from my tent and saw Conrad standing before a fire, taut and tense as
  a hunting hound.</p>

  <p>"'Did you hear that?' he asked. 'What was it?'</p>

  <p>"'A native drum,' I answered&mdash;but we both knew I lied. The noise and
  chatter of our natives about their cooking-fires had ceased as if they had
  all died suddenly.</p>

  <p>"We heard nothing more of it that night, but the next morning we found
  ourselves deserted. The black boys had decamped with all the luggage they
  could lay hand to. We held a council of war, Conrad, Selim and I. The
  half-caste was scared pink, but the pride of his white blood kept him
  carrying on.</p>

  <p>"'What now?' I asked Conrad. 'We've our guns and enough supplies to give
  us a sporting chance of reaching the coast.'</p>

  <p>"'Listen!' he raised his hand. Out across the bush-country throbbed again
  that haunting whisper. 'We'll go on. I'll never rest until I know what makes
  that sound. I never heard anything like it in the world before.'</p>

  <p>"'The jungle will pick our bally bones,' I said. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Listen!' said he.</p>

  <p>"It was like a call. It got into your blood. It drew you as a fakir's
  music draws a cobra. I knew it was madness. But I didn't argue. We cached
  most of our duffle and started on. Each night we built a thorn boma and sat
  inside it while the big cats yowled and grunted outside. And ever clearer as
  we worked deeper and deeper in the jungle mazes, we heard that voice. It was
  deep, mellow, musical. It made you dream strange things; it was pregnant with
  vast age. The lost glories of antiquity whispered in its booming. It centered
  in its resonance all the yearning and mystery of life; all the magic soul of
  the East. I awoke in the middle of the night to listen to its whispering
  echoes, and slept to dream of sky-towering minarets, of long ranks of bowing,
  brown-skinned worshippers, of purple-canopied peacock thrones and thundering
  golden chariots.</p>

  <p>"Conrad had found something at last that rivaled his infernal bugs in his
  interest. He didn't talk much; he hunted insects in an absent-minded way. All
  day he would seem to be in an attitude of listening, and when the deep golden
  notes would roll out across the jungle, he would tense like a hunting dog on
  the scent, while into his eyes would steal a look strange for a civilized
  professor. By Jove, it's curious to see some ancient primal influence steal
  through the veneer of a cold-blooded scientist's soul and touch the red flow
  of life beneath! It was new and strange to Conrad; here was something he
  couldn't explain away with his new-fangled, bloodless psychology.</p>

  <p>"Well, we wandered on in that mad search&mdash;for it's the white man's
  curse to go into Hell to satisfy his curiosity. Then in the gray light of an
  early dawn the camp was rushed. There was no fight. We were simply flooded
  and submerged by numbers. They must have stolen up and surrounded us on all
  sides; for the first thing I knew, the camp was full of fantastic figures and
  there were half a dozen spears at my throat. It rasped me terribly to give up
  without a shot fired, but there was no bettering it, and I cursed myself for
  not having kept a better lookout. We should have expected something of the
  kind, with that devilish chiming in the south.</p>

  <p>"There were at least a hundred of them, and I got a chill when I looked at
  them closely. They weren't black boys and they weren't Arabs. They were lean
  men of middle height, light yellowish brown, with dark eyes and big noses.
  They wore no beards and their heads were close-shaven. They were clad in a
  sort of tunic, belted at the waist with a wide leather girdle, and sandals.
  They also wore a queer kind of iron helmet, peaked at the top, open in front
  and coming down nearly to their shoulders behind and at the sides. They
  carried big metal-braced shields, nearly square, and were armed with
  narrow-bladed spears, strangely made bows and arrows, and short straight
  swords such as I had never seen before&mdash;or since.</p>

  <p>"They bound Conrad and me hand and foot and they butchered Selim then and
  there&mdash;cut his throat like a pig while he kicked and howled. A sickening
  sight&mdash;Conrad nearly fainted and I dare say I looked a bit pale myself.
  Then they set out in the direction we had been heading, making us walk
  between them, with our hands tied behind our backs and their spears
  threatening us. They brought along our scanty dunnage, but from the way they
  carried the guns I didn't believe they knew what those were for. Scarcely a
  word had been spoken between them and when I essayed various dialects I only
  got the prod of a spear-point. Their silence was a bit ghostly and altogether
  ghastly. I felt as if we'd been captured by a band of spooks.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know what to make of them. They had the look of the Orient about
  them but not the Orient with which I was familiar, if you understand me.
  Africa is of the East but not one with it. They looked no more African than a
  Chinaman does. This is hard to explain. But I'll say this: Tokyo is Eastern,
  and Benares is equally so, but Benares symbolizes a different, older phase of
  the Orient, while Peking represents still another, and older one. These men
  were of an Orient I had never known; they were part of an East older than
  Persia&mdash;older than Assyria&mdash;older than Babylon! I felt it about
  them like an aura and I shuddered from the gulfs of Time they symbolized. Yet
  it fascinated me, too. Beneath the Gothic arches of an age-old jungle,
  speared along by silent Orientals whose type has been forgotten for God knows
  how many eons, a man can have fantastic thoughts. I almost wondered if these
  fellows were real, or but the ghosts of warriors dead four thousand
  years!</p>

  <p>"The trees began to thin and the ground sloped upward. At last we came out
  upon a sort of cliff and saw a sight that made us gasp. We were looking into
  a big valley surrounded entirely by high, steep cliffs, through which various
  streams had cut narrow canyons to feed a good-sized lake in the center of the
  valley. In the center of that lake was an island and on that island was a
  temple and at the farther end of the lake was a city! No native village of
  mud and bamboo, either. This seemed to be of stone, yellowish-brown in
  color.</p>

  <p>"The city was walled and consisted of square-built, flat-topped houses,
  some apparently three or four stories high. All the shores of the lake were
  in cultivation and the fields were green and flourishing, fed by artificial
  ditches. They had a system of irrigation that amazed me. But the most
  astonishing thing was the temple on the island.</p>

  <p>"I gasped, gaped and blinked. It was the tower of Babel true to life! Not
  as tall or as big as I'd imagined it, but some ten tiers high and sullen and
  massive just like the pictures, with that same intangible impression of evil
  hovering over it.</p>

  <p>"Then as we stood there, from that vast pile of masonry there floated out
  across the lake that deep resonant booming&mdash;close and clear
  now&mdash;and the very cliffs seemed to quiver with the vibrations of that
  music-laden air. I stole a glance at Conrad; he looked all at sea. He was of
  that class of scientists who have the universe classified and pigeon-holed
  and everything in its proper little nook. By Jove! It knocks them in a heap
  to be confronted with the paradoxical-unexplainable-shouldn't-be more than it
  does common chaps like you and me, who haven't much preconceived ideas of
  things in general.</p>

  <p>"The soldiers took us down a stairway cut into the solid rock of the
  cliffs and we went through irrigated fields where shaven-headed men and
  dark-eyed women paused in their work to stare curiously at us. They took us to a
  big, iron-braced gate where a small body of soldiers equipped like our
  captors challenged them, and after a short parley we were escorted into the
  city. It was much like any other Eastern city&mdash;men, women and children
  going to and fro, arguing, buying and selling. But all in all, it had that
  same effect of apartness&mdash;of vast antiquity. I couldn't classify the
  architecture any more than I could understand the language. The only thing I
  could think of as I stared at those squat, square buildings was the huts
  certain low-caste, mongrel peoples still build in the valley of the Euphrates
  in Mesopotamia. Those huts might be a degraded evolution from the
  architecture in that strange African city.</p>

  <p>"Our captors took us straight to the largest building in the city, and
  while we marched along the streets, we discovered that the houses and walls
  were not of stone after all, but a sort of brick. We were taken into a
  huge-columned hall before which stood ranks of silent soldiery, and taken before a
  dais up which led broad steps. Armed warriors stood behind and on either side
  of a throne, a scribe stood beside it, girls clad in ostrich-plumes lounged
  on the broad steps, and on the throne sat a grim-eyed devil who alone of all
  the men of that fantastic city wore his hair long. He was black-bearded, wore
  a sort of crown and had the haughtiest, cruelest face I ever saw on any man.
  An Arab sheikh or Turkish shah was a lamb beside him. He reminded me of some
  artist's conception of Belshazzar or the Pharaohs&mdash;a king who was more
  than a king in his own mind and the eyes of his people&mdash;a king who was
  at once king and high priest and god.</p>

  <p>"Our escort promptly prostrated themselves before him and knocked their
  heads on the matting until he spoke a languid word to the scribe and this
  personage signed for them to rise. They rose, and the leader began a long
  rigmarole to the king, while the scribe scratched away like mad on a clay
  tablet and Conrad and I stood there like a pair of blooming gaping jackasses,
  wondering what it was all about. Then I heard a word repeated continually,
  and each time he spoke it, he indicated us. The word sounded like
  'Akkaddian,' and suddenly my brain reeled with the possibilities it
  betokened. It couldn't be&mdash;yet it had to be!</p>

  <p>"Not wanting to break in on the conversation and maybe lose my bally head,
  I said nothing, and at last the king gestured and spoke, the soldiers bowed
  again and seizing us, hustled us roughly from the royal presence into a
  columned corridor, across a huge chamber and into a small cell where they
  thrust us and locked the door. There was only a heavy bench and one window,
  closely barred.</p>

  <p>"'My heavens, Bill,' exclaimed Conrad, 'who could have imagined anything
  equal to this? It's like a nightmare&mdash;or a tale from The Arabian Nights!
  Where are we? Who are these people?'</p>

  <p>"'You won't believe me,' I said, 'but&mdash;you've read of the ancient
  empire of Sumeria?'</p>

  <p>"'Certainly; it flourished in Mesopotamia some four thousand years ago.
  But what&mdash;by Jove!' he broke off, staring at me wide-eyed as the
  connection struck him.</p>

  <p>"'I leave it to you what the descendants of an Asia-Minor kingdom are
  doing in East Africa,' I said, feeling for my pipe, 'but it must be&mdash;
  the Sumerians built their cities of sun-dried brick. I saw men making bricks
  and stacking them up to dry along the lake shore. The mud is remarkably like
  that you find in the Tigris and Euphrates valley. Likely that's why these
  chaps settled here. The Sumerians wrote on clay tablets by scratching the
  surface with a sharp point just as the chap was doing in the throne room.</p>

  <p>"'Then look at their arms, dress and physiognomy. I've seen their art
  carved on stone and pottery and wondered if those big noses were part of
  their faces or part of their helmets. And look at that temple in the lake! A
  small counterpart of the temple reared to the god El-lil in Nippur&mdash;
  which probably started the myth of the tower of Babel.</p>

  <p>"'But the thing that clinches it is the fact that they referred to us as
  Akkaddians. Their empire was conquered and subjugated by Sargon of Akkad in
  2750 B.C. If these are descendants of a band who fled their conqueror, it's
  natural that, pent in these hinterlands and separated from the rest of the
  world, they'd come to call all outlanders Akkaddians, much as secluded
  oriental nations call all Europeans Franks in memory of Martel's warriors who
  scuttled them at Tours.'</p>

  <p>"'Why do you suppose they haven't been discovered before now?'</p>

  <p>"'Well, if any white man's been here before, they took good care he didn't
  get out to tell his tale. I doubt if they wander much; probably think the
  outside world's overrun with bloodthirsty Akkaddians.'</p>

  <p>"At this moment the door of our cell opened to admit a slim young girl,
  clad only in a girdle of silk and golden breast-plates. She brought us food
  and wine, and I noted how lingeringly she gazed at Conrad. And to my surprize
  she spoke to us in fair Somali.</p>

  <p>"'Where are we?' I asked her. 'What are they going to do with us? Who are
  you?'</p>

  <p>"'I am Naluna, the dancer of El-lil,' she answered&mdash;and she looked
  it&mdash;lithe as a she-panther she was. 'I am sorry to see you in this
  place; no Akkaddian goes forth from here alive.'</p>

  <p>"'Nice friendly sort of chaps,' I grunted, but glad to find someone I
  could talk to and understand. 'And what's the name of this city?'</p>

  <p>"'This is Eridu,' said she. 'Our ancestors came here many ages ago from
  ancient Sumer, many moons to the East. They were driven by a great and cruel
  king, Sargon of the Akkaddians&mdash;desert people. But our ancestors would
  not be slaves like their kin, so they fled, thousands of them in one great
  band, and traversed many strange, savage countries before they came to this
  land.'</p>

  <p>"Beyond that her knowledge was very vague and mixed up with myths and
  improbable legends. Conrad and I discussed it afterward, wondering if the old
  Sumerians came down the west coast of Arabia and crossed the Red Sea about
  where Mocha is now, or if they went over the Isthmus of Suez and came down on
  the African side. I'm inclined to the last opinion. Likely the Egyptians met
  them as they came out of Asia Minor and chased them south. Conrad thought
  they might have made most of the trip by water, because, as he said, the
  Persian Gulf ran up something like a hundred and thirty miles farther than it
  does now, and Old Eridu was a seaport town. But just at the moment something
  else was on my mind.</p>

  <p>"'Where did you learn to speak Somali?' I asked Naluna.</p>

  <p>"'When I was little,' she answered, 'I wandered out of the valley and into
  the jungle where a band of raiding black men caught me. They sold me to a
  tribe who lived near the coast and I spent my childhood among them. But when
  I had grown into girlhood I remembered Eridu and one day I stole a camel and
  rode across many leagues of veldt and jungle and so came again to the city of
  my birth. In all Eridu I alone can speak a tongue not mine own, except for
  the black slaves&mdash;and they speak not at all, for we cut out their
  tongues when we capture them. The people of Eridu go not forth beyond the
  jungles and they traffic not with the black peoples who sometimes come
  against us, except as they take a few slaves.'</p>

  <p>"I asked her why they killed our camp servant and she said that it was
  forbidden for blacks and whites to mate in Eridu and the offspring of such
  union was not allowed to live. They didn't like the poor beggar's color.</p>

  <p>"Naluna could tell us little of the history of the city since its
  founding, outside the events that had happened in her own memory&mdash;which
  dealt mainly with scattered raids by a cannibalistic tribe living in the
  jungles to the south, petty intrigues of court and temple, crop failures and
  the like&mdash;the scope of a woman's life in the East is much the same,
  whether in the palace of Akbar, Cyrus or Asshurbanipal. But I learned that
  the ruler's name was Sostoras and that he was both high priest and
  king&mdash;just as the rulers were in old Sumer, four thousand years ago. El-lil
  was their god, who abode in the temple in the lake, and the deep booming we
  had heard was, Naluna said, the voice of the god.</p>

  <p>"At last she rose to go, casting a wistful look at Conrad, who sat like a
  man in a trance&mdash;for once his confounded bugs were clean out of his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' said I, 'what d'you think of it, young fella-me-lad?'</p>

  <p>"'It's incredible,' said he, shaking his head. 'It's absurd&mdash;an
  intelligent tribe living here four thousand years and never advancing beyond
  their ancestors.'</p>

  <p>"'You're stung with the bug of progress,' I told him cynically, cramming
  my pipe bowl full of weed. 'You're thinking of the mushroom growth of your
  own country. You can't generalize on an Oriental from a Western viewpoint.
  What about China's famous long sleep? As for these chaps, you forget they're
  no tribe but the tag-end of a civilization that lasted longer than any has
  lasted since. They passed the peak of their progress thousands of years ago.
  With no intercourse with the outside world and no new blood to stir them up,
  these people are slowly sinking in the scale. I'd wager their culture and art
  are far inferior to that of their ancestors.'</p>

  <p>"'Then why haven't they lapsed into complete barbarism?'</p>

  <p>"'Maybe they have, to all practical purposes,' I answered, beginning to
  draw on my old pipe. 'They don't strike me as being quite the proper thing
  for offsprings of an ancient and honorable civilization. But remember they
  grew slowly and their retrogression is bound to be equally slow. Sumerian
  culture was unusually virile. Its influence is felt in Asia Minor today. The
  Sumerians had their civilization when our bloomin' ancestors were scrapping
  with cave bears and sabertooth tigers, so to speak. At least the Aryans
  hadn't passed the first milestones on the road to progress, whoever their
  animal neighbors were. Old Eridu was a seaport of consequence as early as
  6500 B.C. From then to 2750 B.C. is a bit of time for any empire. What other
  empire stood as long as the Sumerian? The Akkaddian dynasty established by
  Sargon stood two hundred years before it was overthrown by another Semitic
  people, the Babylonians, who borrowed their culture from Akkaddian Sumer just
  as Rome later stole hers from Greece; the Elamitish Kassite dynasty
  supplanted the original Babylonian, the Assyrian and the Chaldean followed&mdash;well,
  you know the rapid succession of dynasty on dynasty in Asia
  Minor, one Semitic people overthrowing another, until the real conquerors
  hove in view on the Eastern horizon&mdash;the Aryan Medes and
  Persians&mdash;who were destined to last scarcely longer than their victims.</p>

  <p>"'Compare each fleeting kingdom with the long dreamy reign of the ancient
  pre-Semitic Sumerians! We think the Minoan Age of Crete is a long time back,
  but the Sumerian empire of Erech was already beginning to decay before the
  rising power of Sumerian Nippur, before the ancestors of the Cretans had
  emerged from the Neolithic Age. The Sumerians had something the succeeding
  Hamites, Semites and Aryans lacked. They were stable. They grew slowly and if
  left alone would have decayed as slowly as these fellows are decaying. Still
  and all, I note these chaps have made one advancement&mdash;notice their
  weapons?</p>

  <p>"'Old Sumer was in the Bronze Age. The Assyrians were the first to use
  iron for anything besides ornaments. But these lads have learned to work
  iron&mdash;probably a matter of necessity. No copper hereabouts but plenty of
  iron ore, I daresay.'</p>

  <p>"'But the mystery of Sumer still remains,' Conrad broke in. 'Who are they?
  Whence did they come? Some authorities maintain they were of Dravidian
  origin, akin to the Basques&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'It won't stick, me lad,' said I. 'Even allowing for possible admixture
  of Aryan or Turanian blood in the Dravidian descendants, you can see at a
  glance these people are not of the same race.'</p>

  <p>"'But their language&mdash;' Conrad began arguing, which is a fair way to
  pass the time while you're waiting to be put in the cooking-pot, but doesn't
  prove much except to strengthen your own original ideas.</p>

  <p>"Naluna came again about sunset with food, and this time she sat down by
  Conrad and watched him eat. Seeing her sitting thus, elbows on knees and chin
  on hands, devouring him with her large, lustrous dark eyes, I said to the
  professor in English, so she wouldn't understand: 'The girl's badly smitten
  with you; play up to her. She's our only chance.'</p>

  <p>"He blushed like a blooming school girl. 'I've a fiancée back in the
  States.'</p>

  <p>"'Blow your fiancée,' I said. 'Is it she that's going to keep the bally
  heads on our blightin' shoulders? I tell you this girl's silly over you. Ask
  her what they're going to do with us.'</p>

  <p>"He did so and Naluna said: 'Your fate lies in the lap of El-lil.'</p>

  <p>"'And the brain of Sostoras,' I muttered. 'Naluna, what was done with the
  guns that were taken from us?'</p>

  <p>"She replied that they were hung in the temple of El-lil as trophies of
  victory. None of the Sumerians was aware of their purpose. I asked her if the
  natives they sometimes fought had never used guns and she said no. I could
  easily believe that, seeing that there are many wild tribes in those
  hinterlands who've scarcely seen a single white man. But it seemed incredible
  that some of the Arabs who've raided back and forth across Somaliland for a
  thousand years hadn't stumbled onto Eridu and shot it up. But it turned out
  to be true&mdash;just one of those peculiar quirks and back-eddies in events
  like the wolves and wildcats you still find in New York state, or those queer
  pre-Aryan peoples you come onto in small communities in the hills of
  Connaught and Galway. I'm certain that big slave raids had passed within a
  few miles of Eridu, yet the Arabs had never found it and impressed on them
  the meaning of firearms.</p>

  <p>"So I told Conrad: 'Play up to her, you chump! If you can persuade her to
  slip us a gun, we've a sporting chance.'</p>

  <p>"So Conrad took heart and began talking to Naluna in a nervous sort of
  manner. Just how he'd have come out, I can't say, for he was little of the
  Don Juan, but Naluna snuggled up to him, much to his embarrassment, listening
  to his stumbling Somali with her soul in her eyes. Love blossoms suddenly and
  unexpectedly in the East.</p>

  <p>"However, a peremptory voice outside our cell made Naluna jump half out of
  her skin and sent her scurrying, but as she went she pressed Conrad's hand
  and whispered something in his ear that we couldn't understand, but it
  sounded highly passionate.</p>

  <p>"Shortly after she had left, the cell opened again and there stood a file
  of silent dark-skinned warriors. A sort of chief, whom the rest addressed as
  Gorat, motioned us to come out. Then down a long, dim, colonnaded corridor we
  went, in perfect silence except for the soft scruff of their sandals and the
  tramp of our boots on the tiling. An occasional torch flaring on the walls or
  in a niche of the columns lighted the way vaguely. At last we came out into
  the empty streets of the silent city. No sentry paced the streets or the
  walls, no lights showed from inside the flat-topped houses. It was like
  walking a street in a ghost city. Whether every night in Eridu was like that
  or whether the people kept indoors because it was a special and awesome
  occasion, I haven't an idea.</p>

  <p>"We went on down the streets toward the lake side of the town. There we
  passed through a small gate in the wall&mdash;over which, I noted with a
  slight shudder, a grinning skull was carved&mdash;and found ourselves outside
  the city. A broad flight of steps led down to the water's edge and the spears
  at our backs guided us down them. There a boat waited, a strange high-prowed
  affair whose prototype must have plied the Persian Gulf in the days of Old
  Eridu.</p>

  <p>"Four black men rested on their oars, and when they opened their mouths I
  saw their tongues had been cut out. We were taken into the boat, our guards
  got in and we started a strange journey. Out on the silent lake we moved like
  a dream, whose silence was broken only by the low rippling of the long, slim,
  golden-worked oars through the water. The stars flecked the deep blue gulf of
  the lake with silver points. I looked back and saw the silent city of Eridu
  sleeping beneath the stars. I looked ahead and saw the great dark bulk of the
  temple loom against the stars. The naked black mutes pulled the shining oars
  and the silent warriors sat before and behind us with their spears, helms and
  shields. It was like the dream of some fabulous city of Haroun-al-Raschid's
  time, or of Sulieman-ben-Daoud's, and I thought how blooming incongruous
  Conrad and I looked in that setting, with our boots and dingy, tattered
  khakis.</p>

  <p>"We landed on the island and I saw it was girdled with masonry&mdash;
  built up from the water's edge in broad flights of steps which circled the
  entire island. The whole seemed older, even, than the city&mdash;the
  Sumerians must have built it when they first found the valley, before they
  began on the city itself.</p>

  <p>"We went up the steps, that were worn deep by countless feet, to a huge
  set of iron doors in the temple, and here Gorat laid down his spear and
  shield, dropped on his belly and knocked his helmed head on the great sill.
  Some one must have been watching from a loophole, for from the top of the
  tower sounded one deep golden note and the doors swung silently open to
  disclose a dim, torch-lighted entrance. Gorat rose and led the way, we
  following with those confounded spears pricking our backs.</p>

  <p>"We mounted a flight of stairs and came onto a series of galleries built
  on the inside of each tier and winding around and up. Looking up, it seemed
  much higher and bigger than it had seemed from without, and the vague,
  half-lighted gloom, the silence and the mystery gave me the shudders. Conrad's
  face gleamed white in the semi-darkness. The shadows of past ages crowded in
  upon us, chaotic and horrific, and I felt as though the ghosts of all the
  priests and victims who had walked those galleries for four thousand years
  were keeping pace with us. The vast wings of dark, forgotten gods hovered
  over that hideous pile of antiquity.</p>

  <p>"We came out on the highest tier. There were three circles of tall
  columns, one inside the other&mdash;and I want to say that for columns built
  of sun-dried brick, these were curiously symmetrical. But there was none of
  the grace and open beauty of, say, Greek architecture. This was grim, sullen,
  monstrous&mdash;something like the Egyptian, not quite so massive but even
  more formidable in starkness&mdash;an architecture symbolizing an age when
  men were still in the dawn-shadows of Creation and dreamed of monstrous
  gods.</p>

  <p>"Over the inner circle of columns was a curving roof&mdash;almost a dome.
  How they built it, or how they came to anticipate the Roman builders by so
  many ages, I can't say, for it was a startling departure from the rest of
  their architectural style, but there it was. And from this dome-like roof
  hung a great round shining thing that caught the starlight in a silver net. I
  knew then what we had been following for so many mad miles! It was a great
  gong&mdash;the Voice of El-lil. It looked like jade but I'm not sure to this
  day. But whatever it was, it was the symbol on which the faith and cult of
  the Sumerians hung&mdash;the symbol of the god-head itself. And I know Naluna
  was right when she told us that her ancestors brought it with them on that
  long, grueling trek, ages ago, when they fled before Sargon's wild riders.
  And how many eons before that dim time must it have hung in El-lil's temple
  in Nippur, Erech or Old Eridu, booming out its mellow threat or promise over
  the dreamy valley of the Euphrates, or across the green foam of the Persian
  Gulf!</p>

  <p>"They stood us just within the first ring of columns, and out of the
  shadows somewhere, looking like a shadow from the past himself, came old
  Sostoras, the priest-king of Eridu. He was clad in a long robe of green,
  covered with scales like a snake's hide, and it rippled and shimmered with
  every step he took. On his head he wore a head-piece of waving plumes and in
  his hand he held a long-shafted golden mallet.</p>

  <p>"He tapped the gong lightly and golden waves of sound flowed over us like
  a wave, suffocating us in its exotic sweetness. And then Naluna came. I never
  knew if she came from behind the columns or up through some trap floor. One
  instant the space before the gong was bare, the next she was dancing like a
  moonbeam on a pool. She was clad in some light, shimmery stuff that barely
  veiled her sinuous body and lithe limbs. And she danced before Sostoras and
  the Voice of El-lil as women of her breed had danced in old Sumer four
  thousand years ago.</p>

  <p>"I can't begin to describe that dance. It made me freeze and tremble and
  burn inside. I heard Conrad's breath come in gasps and he shivered like a
  reed in the wind. From somewhere sounded music, that was old when Babylon was
  young, music as elemental as the fire in a tigress' eyes, and as soulless as
  an African midnight. And Naluna danced. Her dancing was a whirl of fire and
  wind and passion and all elemental forces. From all basic, primal
  fundamentals she drew underlying principles and combined them in one
  spin-wheel of motion. She narrowed the universe to a dagger-point of meaning
  and her flying feet and shimmering body wove out the mazes of that one
  central Thought. Her dancing stunned, exalted, maddened and hypnotized.</p>

  <p>"As she whirled and spun, she was the elemental Essence, one and a part of
  all powerful impulses and moving or sleeping powers&mdash;the sun, the moon,
  the stars, the blind groping of hidden roots to light, the fire from the
  furnace, the sparks from the anvil, the breath of the fawn, the talons of the
  eagle. Naluna danced, and her dancing was Time and Eternity, the urge of
  Creation and the urge of Death; birth and dissolution in one, age and infancy
  combined.</p>

  <p>"My dazed mind refused to retain more impressions; the girl merged into a
  whirling flicker of white fire before my dizzy eyes; then Sostoras struck one
  light note on the Voice and she fell at his feet, a quivering white shadow.
  The moon was just beginning to glow over the cliffs to the East.</p>

  <p>"The warriors seized Conrad and me, and bound me to one of the outer
  columns. Him they dragged to the inner circle and bound to a column directly
  in front of the great gong. And I saw Naluna, white in the growing glow, gaze
  drawnly at him, then shoot a glance full of meaning at me, as she faded from
  sight among the dark sullen columns.</p>

  <p>"Old Sostoras made a motion and from the shadows came a wizened black
  slave who looked incredibly old. He had the withered features and vacant
  stare of a deaf-mute, and the priest-king handed the golden mallet to him.
  Then Sostoras fell back and stood beside me, while Gorat bowed and stepped
  back a pace and the warriors likewise bowed and backed still farther away. In
  fact they seemed most blooming anxious to get as far away from that sinister
  ring of columns as they could.</p>

  <p>"There was a tense moment of waiting. I looked out across the lake at the
  high, sullen cliffs that girt the valley, at the silent city lying beneath
  the rising moon. It was like a dead city.
  The whole scene was most unreal, as if Conrad and I had been transported
  to another planet or back into a dead and forgotten age. Then the black mute
  struck the gong.</p>

  <p>"At first it was a low, mellow whisper that flowed out from under the
  black man's steady mallet. But it swiftly grew in intensity. The sustained,
  increasing sound became nerve-racking&mdash;it grew unbearable. It was more
  than mere sound. The mute evoked a quality of vibration that entered into
  every nerve and racked it apart. It grew louder and louder until I felt that
  the most desirable thing in the world was complete deafness, to be like that
  blank-eyed mute who neither heard nor felt the perdition of sound he was
  creating. And yet I saw sweat beading his ape-like brow. Surely some thunder
  of that brain-shattering cataclysm re-echoed in his own soul. El-lil spoke to
  us and death was in his voice. Surely, if one of the terrible, black gods of
  past ages could speak, he would speak in just such tongue! There was neither
  mercy, pity nor weakness in its roar. It was the assurance of a cannibal god
  to whom mankind was but a plaything and a puppet to dance on his string.</p>

  <p>"Sound can grow too deep, too shrill or too loud for the human ear to
  record. Not so with the Voice of El-lil, which had its creation in some
  inhuman age when dark wizards knew how to rack brain, body and soul apart.
  Its depth was unbearable, its volume was unbearable, yet ear and soul were
  keenly alive to its resonance and did not grow mercifully numb and dulled.
  And its terrible sweetness was beyond human endurance; it suffocated us in a
  smothering wave of sound that yet was barbed with golden fangs. I gasped and
  struggled in physical agony. Behind me I was aware that even old Sostoras had
  his hands over his ears, and Gorat groveled on the floor, grinding his face
  into the bricks.</p>

  <p>"And if it so affected me, who was just within the magic circle of
  columns, and those Sumerians who were outside the circle, what was it doing
  to Conrad, who was inside the inner ring and beneath that domed roof that
  intensified every note?</p>

  <p>"Till the day he dies Conrad will never be closer to madness and death
  than he was then. He writhed in his bonds like a snake with a broken back;
  his face was horribly contorted, his eyes distended, and foam flecked his
  livid lips. But in that hell of golden, agonizing sound I could hear
  nothing&mdash;I could only see his gaping mouth and his frothy, flaccid lips, loose
  and writhing like an imbecile's. But I sensed he was howling like a dying
  dog.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the sacrificial dagger of the Semites was merciful. Even Moloch's
  lurid furnace was easier than the death promised by this rending and ripping
  vibration that armed sound waves with venomed talons. I felt my own brain was
  brittle as frozen glass. I knew that a few seconds more of that torture and
  Conrad's brain would shatter like a crystal goblet and he would die in the
  black raving of utter madness. And then something snapped me back from the
  mazes I'd gotten into. It was the fierce grasp of a small hand on mine,
  behind the column to which I was bound. I felt a tug at my cords as if a
  knife edge was being passed along them, and my hands were free. I felt
  something pressed into my hand and a fierce exultation surged through me. I'd
  recognize the familiar checkered grip of my Webley .44 in a thousand!</p>

  <p>"I acted in a flash that took the whole gang off guard. I lunged away from
  the column and dropped the black mute with a bullet through his brain,
  wheeled and shot old Sostoras through the belly. He went down, spewing blood,
  and I crashed a volley square into the stunned ranks of the soldiers. At that
  range I couldn't miss. Three of them dropped and the rest woke up and
  scattered like a flock of birds. In a second the place was empty except for
  Conrad, Naluna and me, and the men on the floor. It was like a dream, the
  echoes from the shots still crashing, and the acrid scent of powder and blood
  knifing the air.</p>

  <p>"The girl cut Conrad loose and he fell on the floor and yammered like a
  dying imbecile. I shook him but he had a wild glare in his eyes and was
  frothing like a mad dog, so I dragged him up, shoved an arm under him and
  started for the stair. We weren't out of the mess yet, by a long shot. Down
  those wide, winding, dark galleries we went, expecting any minute to be
  ambushed, but the chaps must have still been in a bad funk, because we got
  out of that hellish temple without any interference. Outside the iron portals
  Conrad collapsed and I tried to talk to him, but he could neither hear nor
  speak. I turned to Naluna.</p>

  <p>"'Can you do anything for him?'</p>

  <p>"Her eyes flashed in the moonlight. 'I have not defied my people and my
  god and betrayed my cult and my race for naught! I stole the weapon of smoke
  and flame, and freed you, did I not? I love him and I will not lose him
  now!'</p>

  <p>"She darted into the temple and was out almost instantly with a jug of
  wine. She claimed it had magical powers. I don't believe it. I think Conrad
  simply was suffering from a sort of shell-shock from close proximity to that
  fearful noise and that lake water would have done as well as the wine. But
  Naluna poured some wine between his lips and emptied some over his head, and
  soon he groaned and cursed.</p>

  <p>"'See!' she cried triumphantly, 'the magic wine has lifted the spell
  El-lil put on him!' And she flung her arms around his neck and kissed him
  vigorously.</p>

  <p>"'My God, Bill,' he groaned, sitting up and holding his head, 'what kind
  of a nightmare is this?'</p>

  <p>"'Can you walk, old chap?' I asked. 'I think we've stirred up a bloomin'
  hornet's nest and we'd best leg it out of here.'</p>

  <p>"'I'll try.' He staggered up, Naluna helping him. I heard a sinister
  rustle and whispering in the black mouth of the temple and I judged the
  warriors and priests inside were working up their nerve to rush us. We made
  it down the steps in a great hurry to where lay the boat that had brought us
  to the island. Not even the black rowers were there. An ax and shield lay in
  it and I seized the ax and knocked holes in the bottoms of the other boats
  which were tied near it.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile the big gong had begun to boom out again and Conrad groaned and
  writhed as every intonation rasped his raw nerves. It was a warning note this
  time and I saw lights flare up in the city and heard a sudden hum of shouts
  float out across the lake. Something hissed softly by my head and slashed
  into the water. A quick look showed me Gorat standing in the door of the
  temple bending his heavy bow. I leaped in, Naluna helped Conrad in, and we
  shoved off in a hurry to the accompaniment of several more shafts from the
  charming Gorat, one of which took a lock of hair from Naluna's pretty
  head.</p>

  <p>"I laid to the oars while Naluna steered and Conrad lay on the bottom of
  the boat and was violently sick. We saw a fleet of boats put out from the
  city, and as they saw us by the gleam of the moon, a yell of concentrated
  rage went up that froze the blood in my veins. We were heading for the
  opposite end of the lake and had a long start on them, but in this way we
  were forced to round the island and we'd scarcely left it astern when out of
  some nook leaped a long boat with six warriors&mdash;I saw Gorat in the bows
  with that confounded bow of his.</p>

  <p>"I had no spare cartridges so I laid to it with all my might, and Conrad,
  somewhat green in the face, took the shield and rigged it up in the stern,
  which was the saving of us, because Gorat hung within bowshot of us all the
  way across the lake and he filled that shield so full of arrows it resembled
  a blooming porcupine. You'd have thought they'd had plenty after the
  slaughter I made among them on the roof, but they were after us like hounds
  after a hare.</p>

  <p>"We'd a fair start on them but Gorat's five rowers shot his boat through
  the water like a racehorse, and when we grounded on the shore, they weren't
  half a dozen jumps behind us. As we scrambled out I saw it was either make a
  fight of it there and be cut down from the front, or else be shot like
  rabbits as we ran. I called to Naluna to run but she laughed and drew a
  dagger&mdash;she was a man's woman, that girl!</p>

  <p>"Gorat and his merry men came surging up to the landing with a clamor of
  yells and a swirl of oars&mdash;they swarmed over the side like a gang of
  bloody pirates and the battle was on! Luck was with Gorat at the first pass,
  for I missed him and killed the man behind him. The hammer snapped on an
  empty shell and I dropped the Webley and snatched up the ax just as they
  closed with us. By Jove! It stirs my blood now to think of the touch-and-go
  fury of that fight! Knee-deep in water we met them, hand to hand, chest to
  chest!</p>

  <p>"Conrad brained one with a stone he picked from the water, and out of the
  tail of my eye, as I swung for Gorat's head, I saw Naluna spring like a
  she-panther on another, and they went down together in a swirl of limbs and a
  flash of steel. Gorat's sword was thrusting for my life, but I knocked it
  aside with the ax and he lost his footing and went down&mdash;for the lake
  bottom was solid stone there, and treacherous as sin.</p>

  <p>"One of the warriors lunged in with a spear, but he tripped over the
  fellow Conrad had killed, his helmet fell off and I crushed his skull before
  he could recover his balance. Gorat was up and coming for me, and the other
  was swinging his sword in both hands for a death blow, but he never struck,
  for Conrad caught up the spear that had been dropped, and spitted him from
  behind, neat as a whistle.</p>

  <p>"Gorat's point raked my ribs as he thrust for my heart and I twisted to
  one side, and his up-flung arm broke like a rotten stick beneath my stroke
  but saved his life. He was game&mdash;they were all game or they'd never have
  rushed my gun. He sprang in like a blood-mad tiger, hacking for my head. I
  ducked and avoided the full force of the blow but couldn't get away from it
  altogether and it laid my scalp open in a three-inch gash, clear to
  the bone&mdash;here's the scar to prove it. Blood blinded me and I struck back like a
  wounded lion, blind and terrible, and by sheer chance I landed squarely. I
  felt the ax crunch through metal and bone, the haft splintered in my hand,
  and there was Gorat dead at my feet in a horrid welter of blood and
  brains.</p>

  <p>"I shook the blood out of my eyes and looked about for my companions.
  Conrad was helping Naluna up and it seemed to me she swayed a little. There
  was blood on her bosom but it might have come from the red dagger she gripped
  in a hand stained to the wrist. God! It was a bit sickening, to think of it
  now. The water we stood in was choked with corpses and ghastly red. Naluna
  pointed out across the lake and we saw Eridu's boats sweeping down on
  us&mdash;a good way off as yet, but coming swiftly. She led us at a run away
  from the lake's edge. My wound was bleeding as only a scalp wound can bleed,
  but I wasn't weakened as yet. I shook the blood out of my eyes, saw Naluna
  stagger as she ran and tried to put my arm about her to steady her, but she
  shook me off.</p>

  <p>"She was making for the cliffs and we reached them out of breath. Naluna
  leaned against Conrad and pointed upward with a shaky hand, breathing in
  great, sobbing gasps. I caught her meaning. A rope ladder led upward. I made
  her go first with Conrad following. I came after him, drawing the ladder up
  behind me. We'd gotten some halfway up when the boats landed and the warriors
  raced up the shore, loosing their arrows as they ran. But we were in the
  shadow of the cliffs, which made aim uncertain, and most of the shafts fell
  short or broke on the face of the cliff. One stuck in my left arm, but I
  shook it out and didn't stop to congratulate the marksman on his eye.</p>

  <p>"Once over the cliff's edge, I jerked the ladder up and tore it loose, and
  then turned to see Naluna sway and collapse in Conrad's arms. We laid her
  gently on the grass, but a man with half an eye could tell she was going
  fast. I wiped the blood from her bosom and stared aghast. Only a woman with a
  great love could have made that run and that climb with such a wound as that
  girl had under her heart.</p>

  <p>"Conrad cradled her head in his lap and tried to falter a few words, but
  she weakly put her arms around his neck and drew his face down to hers.</p>

  <p>"'Weep not for me, my lover,' she said, as her voice weakened to a
  whisper. 'Thou hast been mine aforetime, as thou shalt be again. In the mud
  huts of the Old River, before Sumer was, when we tended the flocks, we were
  as one. In the palaces of Old Eridu, before the barbarians came out of the
  East, we loved each other. Aye, on this very lake have we floated in past
  ages, living and loving, thou and I. So weep not, my lover, for what is one
  little life when we have known so many and shall know so many more? And in
  each of them, thou art mine and I am thine.</p>

  <p>"'But thou must not linger. Hark! They clamor for thy blood below. But
  since the ladder is destroyed there is but one other way by which they may
  come upon the cliffs&mdash;the place by which they brought thee into the
  valley. Haste! They will return across the lake, scale the cliffs there and
  pursue thee, but thou may'st escape them if thou be'st swift. And when thou
  hearest the Voice of El-lil, remember, living or dead, Naluna loves thee with
  a love greater than any god.</p>

  <p>"'But one boon I beg of thee,' she whispered, her heavy lids drooping like
  a sleepy child's. 'Press, I beg thee, thy lips on mine, my master, before the
  shadows utterly enfold me; then leave me here and go, and weep not, oh my
  lover, for what
  is&mdash;one&mdash;little&mdash;life&mdash;to&mdash;us&mdash;who&mdash;have&mdash;loved&mdash;in&mdash;so&mdash;many&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Conrad wept like a blithering baby, and so did I, by Judas, and I'll
  stamp the lousy brains out of the jackass who twits me for it! We left her
  with her arms folded on her bosom and a smile on her lovely face, and if
  there's a heaven for Christian folk, she's there with the best of them, on my
  oath.</p>

  <p>"Well, we reeled away in the moonlight and my wounds were still bleeding
  and I was about done in. All that kept me going was a sort of wild beast
  instinct to live, I fancy, for if I was ever near to lying down and dying, it
  was then. We'd gone perhaps a mile when the Sumerians played their last ace.
  I think they'd realized we'd slipped out of their grasp and had too much
  start to be caught.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, all at once that damnable gong began booming. I felt like
  howling like a dog with rabies. This time it was a different sound. I never
  saw or heard of a gong before or since whose notes could convey so many
  different meanings. This was an insidious call&mdash;a luring urge, yet a
  peremptory command for us to return. It threatened and promised; if its
  attraction had been great before we stood on the tower of El-lil and felt its
  full power, now it was almost irresistible. It was hypnotic. I know now how a
  bird feels when charmed by a snake and how the snake himself feels when the
  fakirs play on their pipes. I can't begin to make you understand the
  overpowering magnetism of that call. It made you want to writhe and tear at
  the air and run back, blind and screaming, as a hare runs into a python's
  jaws. I had to fight it as a man fights for his soul.</p>

  <p>"As for Conrad, it had him in its grip. He halted and rocked like a
  drunken man.</p>

  <p>"'It's no use,' he mumbled thickly. 'It drags at my heart-strings; it's
  fettered my brain and my soul; it embraces all the evil lure of all the
  universes. I must go back.'</p>

  <p>"And he started staggering back the way we had come&mdash;toward that
  golden lie floating to us over the jungle. But I thought of the girl Naluna
  that had given up her life to save us from that abomination, and a strange
  fury gripped me.</p>

  <p>"'See here!' I shouted. 'This won't do, you bloody fool! You're off your
  bally bean! I won't have it, d'you hear?'</p>

  <p>"But he paid no heed, shoving by me with eyes like a man in a trance, so I
  let him have it&mdash;an honest right hook to the jaw that stretched him out
  dead to the world. I slung him over my shoulder and reeled on my way, and it
  was nearly an hour before he came to, quite sane and grateful to me.</p>

  <p>"Well, we saw no more of the people of Eridu. Whether they trailed us at
  all or not, I haven't an idea. We could have fled no faster than we did, for
  we were fleeing the haunting, horrible mellow whisper that dogged us from the
  south. We finally made it back to the spot where we'd cached our dunnage, and
  then, armed and scantily equipped, we started the long trek for the coast.
  Maybe you read or heard something about two emaciated wanderers being picked
  up by an elephant-hunting expedition in the Somaliland back country, dazed
  and incoherent from suffering. Well, we were about done for, I'll admit, but
  we were perfectly sane. The incoherent part was when we tried to tell our
  tale and the blasted idiots wouldn't believe it. They patted our backs and
  talked in a soothing tone and poured whisky-and-sodas down us. We soon shut
  up, seeing we'd only be branded as liars or lunatics. They got us back to
  Jibuti, and both of us had had enough of Africa for a spell. I took ship for
  India and Conrad went the other way&mdash;couldn't get back to New England
  quick enough, where I hope he married that little American girl and is living
  happily. A wonderful chap, for all his damnable bugs.</p>

  <p>"As for me, I can't hear any sort of a gong today without starting. On
  that long, grueling trek I never breathed easily until we were beyond the
  sound of that ghastly Voice. You can't tell what a thing like that may do to
  your mind. It plays the very deuce with all rational ideas.</p>

  <p>"I still hear that hellish gong in my dreams, sometimes, and see that
  silent, hideously ancient city in that nightmare valley. Sometimes I wonder
  if it's still calling to me across the years. But that's nonsense. Anyway,
  there's the yarn as it stands and if you don't believe me, I won't blame you
  at all."</p>

  <p>But I prefer to believe Bill Kirby, for I know his breed from Hengist
  down, and know him to be like all the rest&mdash;truthful, aggressive,
  profane, restless, sentimental and straightforward, a true brother of the
  roving, fighting, adventuring Sons of Aryan.</p>
