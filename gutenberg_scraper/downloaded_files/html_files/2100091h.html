<h2><a id="DOP-1935-02-04"></a>THE MARTYR ON THE LAND</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Advertiser</i>, Adelaide,
4 February 1935.</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>In this arresting article, a former city-dweller,
who once<br>
cherished the comfortable belief that farming is a charming<br>
and profitable occupation, tells how  he has learned the truth,<br>
and what bitter reflections it has engendered in his mind.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">BEFORE me, upon my desk, lies a  purchase-docket
from one of the largest firms of cream-buyers in South
Australia. It is dated December 18 last, and reads:&mdash;
"Weight of cream, 25 lb.; cheque enclosed, 7/7." And this docket
is symptomatic of the whole life story of the farmer of
today.</p>

<p>Up to a year ago, living always in the cities, I
regarded the plight of the farmer as being wholly due to his
want of foresight and lack of business ability. Fair weather or
foul, said I, he was always complaining; and, if he were now
impoverished and in financial straits, it was because, among all
classes of the community, he, least of all, had accommodated
himself to the changed conditions of the times. He should count
his blessings, I thought. He lived a free and glorious life in
the open air; he was spared the strain and nervous tension of
the city; he had the best of things to eat at his very door; and
if, in the pursuit of his calling, he did occasionally meet with
adverse conditions, then the good seasons must make up for the
bad, and he must be thankful that he was in any employment at
all!</p>

<p>That was a year ago. Since then, having lived with farmers,
and with farmers only, I have changed my mind; and, indeed, have
come to marvel at the man upon the land as a very patient, and,
in the main, ungrumbling individual struggling manfully beneath
a burden that it seems quite hopeless he will ever be able to
bear.</p>

<p>At no time is there an occupation that offers more uncertain
reward than the farmer's; and now the margin between profit and
loss is so very small that his days are one continual round of
harassing anxiety, with but the remotest chance of things coming
out on the right side of the ledger at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The dweller in the city does not realise that from seed time
unto harvest the farmer never knows from day to day what
calamity may befall him, being never sure that in one short
hour, almost, he will not lose the fruit of a whole year's
labor.</p>

<p>Sun, wind, and rain out of due season mean only a passing
inconvenience to those in the city; but to the farmer they may,
and very often do, spell absolute disaster.</p>

<p>Take that Black Monday of last month, for
instance&mdash;December 17, the day of the most terrible dust
storm within living memory. Adelaide folk, absorbing their iced
drinks, could not know that in many districts it was being fatal
to thousands of acres of unreaped oats, shaking out all the
grain and leaving nothing but the empty stalks.</p>


<h3>SEED TIME AND HARVEST</h3>

<p class="first">"WHILE the earth remaineth, seed time
and harvest shall not cease," says Holy Writ; but that surely
does not apply to the farmer in Australia. Seed-time, if you
like. Seed-time with all the long days of heavy and patient toil
that precede it: the ploughing, the harrowing, the cultivating
and the cultivating again, but the harvest&mdash;ah, that is
quite a different matter. The farmer is never certain, until the
grain is actually in his barn, that there is going to be any
harvest at all.</p>

<p>On that morning of December 17, a farmer near me was reaping
a small crop of seven acres of oats that he sows every year as
feed for his horses. His normal harvest from this little patch
is 70 bags. The first time he went round with the harvester, he
got two bags; then up came the wind, and he had to go round ten
times to obtain the next two bags. In all, that day he harvested
10 bags of oats instead of the usual 70.</p>

<p>And that happening is just a very ordinary instance of the
uncertainty of the farmer's life, for he is always at the mercy
of the caprices of the elements. Drought, frost, hail, tempest,
and the blast of the hot north wind, are for ever threatening
him; and it is just a gamble that at least one of them does not
injure him in some way or other during the course of each
year.</p>

<p>After a good rain he may hopefully sow his seed. A light rain
may then follow, and after that a drying wind may sweep down and
bake the surface of the ground so hard that the sprouting grain
will not be able to push its way through, so that the whole
sowing will have to be done all over again. Or a dry spell may
follow upon the seeding, and the seed malt and become
useless.</p>

<p>Once more, the crop may come up and show all the promise of a
good harvest. Then, just as it is maturing, a hard frost may
ensue and kill the flower, and the whole crop be lost. Or, when
the grain is in the head, a hailstorm may come and break all the
heads off. Then, in sandy soils, a succession of hot winds may
destroy everything, or, in heavier soils, so pinch the grains
that they will become light and totally useless for making into
flour.</p>

<h3>LIFE OF HAZARDS</h3>

<p class="first">YET again, if the reaping of the ripened crop
be retarded by days of continuous rain&mdash;as, indeed, has
happened in many districts this year&mdash;the grain will become
bleached, and, with the gluten washed out, of much poorer
quality. Sometimes, even a total loss may follow by the grain
starting to grow in the heads. Also, the winds may so flatten
down the stalks that up to 50 per cent. of the crop may not be
able to be gathered in the harvester. Much of the grain, too,
may then have been shaken out, and, as we have seen in the case
of oats, the whole of the crop may thus be lost.</p>

<p>Despite all this, I have by no means exhausted the hazards of
a farmer's calling or the misfortunes that are continually
befalling him. This year, in particular, has been a most unhappy
one. Owing to the drought, there was no green feed for stock
right up to the end of the winter; and, although a farmer might
hand-feed his sheep with the wheat that he could so ill spare,
many of the ewes became so weak that when they dropped their
lambs they had no milk for them, and, in consequence, morning
after morning, the paddocks were strewn with the bodies of the
dead. Then, after the drought, came the plague of grasshoppers;
and, in those districts where they arrived too late to ruin all
the crops, they stripped bare the precious lucern and played
havoc with the other kinds of feed, so that today in many places
the farmers have already had to draw upon their winter stores of
hay.</p>

<h3>WHAT DOES HE GET?</h3>

<p class="first">AND even when all things are propitious from a
seasonal point of view, what does the ordinary so-called mixed
farmer get out of everything? Seven shillings and seven pence
for 25 lb. of cream; 6d. a pound for butter; anything up to 5d.
or 6d. a dozen for his eggs; and perhaps 2/ for a good fat fowl.
He may feed a pig twice and even three times a day for six or
seven months, and maybe think himself lucky if he collects 50/,
or even only a couple of pounds. He will sell a calf as big as a
Newfoundland dog, and perhaps get only 27/6 or 30/; and for a
prime fat young sheep he may get anything from 15/ up to
£1. As for his wheat, well, all the world knows what he
gets for that; but how many people realise what its low price
means to the man who produces it?</p>

<p>It is upon the wheat crop that the farmer depends mainly for
his livelihood, and he labors all the year round to obtain it.
Suppose he farms, as we do, in the lower north, and wheat is
quoted at 2/6 a bushel, delivered at Port Adelaide. That means
7/6 for a bag of three bushels, or, deducting 7&frac12;d. for
the one-twelfth he has used as seed, he will be receiving only
6/10&frac12;. it has cost him from 8d. to 9d. to buy each wheat
bag, and, roughly, he has spent another 6d. upon the super he
has had to use to obtain the three bushels. That brings the
6/10&frac12; down to 5/7&frac12;. Deduct, then, another 4d. for
the upkeep of his horses or his tractor, and it leaves him with
5/3&frac12;. After he has had the expense of carting the bag of
wheat to the Burra railway station, he has to pay one shilling
more for the freight charge to Port Adelaide, so, in the end,
making no allowance for the ageing of his horses or the
depreciation on his tractor or the repairs and replacements to
his implements, he nets 4/3&frac12; upon each bag, and, assuming
that he averages six bags to the acre, which is a good average
for good land up here, he receives the magnificent sum of 25/9
upon each acre.</p>

<h3>THE WITHERED ARM</h3>

<p class="first">IF he has harvested 200 acres under the best of
possible conditions, and has escaped all the disasters I have
enumerated, the money he will receive for his entire crop will
be only £257 10/, or, if the price of wheat keeps up to
2/9 a bushel, just over £300. Consider, too, that to reap
200 acres of wheat each year upon a mixed farm, the acreage of
the farm must be at least 500 acres. Then think, quite apart
from the £600 to £700 that he has expended upon his
plant and implements, what he must have paid for 500 acres of
good farming land. Almost certainly, at least £6,000; and,
if that be so, it is more than probable that there is a mortgage
running of £4,000, with £200 to pay each year in
interest.</p>

<p>Then how can it be expected, at current prices, that he will
ever be able to live and pay his way? Moreover, upon all sides
he sees shrinking markets and a glutted world; a world that does
not want his produce, and, indeed, could not pay for it if it
did. Can it be that, instead of being the backbone of the
Commonwealth, the farmer has become now its withered arm,
needing constant and expensive treatment from the Treasury to
support him upon the sick list? In any case, he is the victim of
circumstances over which no one, and he least of all, has had
any control; and it is not his fault if he stands today, a
pathetic figure, silhouetted against the dusk of the one-time
prosperity of the world&mdash;the martyr on the land.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1935-04-04"></a>THE GUARDIAN ANGEL</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide 4 April 1935.</h3>

<p class="first">ONE burning summer day in South Australia,
towards late afternoon, two men were drinking in the bar of a
small hotel, situated about 50 miles north of the railway line
that runs its long and dreary way between Yunta and Broken
Hill.</p>

<p>They looked hard-bitten and well-salted adventurers, who if
the world had dealt unkindly to them, had nevertheless at all
times been prepared to pass on that unkindness to others to the
best of their abilities.</p>

<p>One of them was tall, with hawk-like face and eyes, and of an
appearance generally not unlike that of a bird of prey, and the
other of much shorter stature, with coarse and sallow features,
would certainly not have inspired confidence upon a chance
encounter in a lonely place.</p>

<p>The hotel stood by itself, and was the last of the ramshackle
buildings, comprising the little township that lay isolated in
the surrounding wilderness of uninhabited bush.</p>

<p>The men were strangers to the hotel, having arrived barely an
hour previously, in a shabby car that now stood blistering
outside, and it annoyed the landlord considerably that he could
learn nothing about them.</p>

<p>With the confiding nature of one to whom it was at all times
a pleasure to impart information, he had, unasked, given them
the news of the little township, but to all his scarcely veiled
suggestions that they should be communicative in return, they
had made no response.</p>

<p>They had just, from time to time, ordered more refreshment,
and in the intervals replied curtly, and in monosyllables only,
to his advances.</p>

<p>Their reticence was the more annoying because the landlord
was sure, from everything about them, that a frank disclosure of
their business would have greatly interested him. That they had
been prospecting after gold he had no doubt, and that they had
been unsuccessful in their quest he was equally as certain.</p>

<p>He had not kept a hotel for ten years in a gold-bearing
district for nothing, and all the signs of "no luck" were most
unmistakably apparent. They showed no eagerness or hurry to get
away, and no indications even, that they themselves knew what
they were going to do next. They seemed, he thought, to be men
who, having failed in one direction, were now just waiting for
another to open up.</p>

<p>Resentful at having to do all the talking, their palpable
unfriendliness at last stung him into silence, and resigning
himself to the inevitable, he imitated their bored attitudes and
stared stonily, out of the window.</p>

<p>Suddenly then, the brisk 'toot-toot' of a motor horn was
heard in the distance, and at once his face brightened.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed with animation, "that's Bent Spinks. I'd
know his horn anywhere." He shot a malicious glance at the
strangers. "He strikes it rich every time."</p>

<p>The tall man at last deigned to ask a question. "Where?" he
asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Where!" echoed the landlord grinning, "why, everywhere! He
always makes his pile."</p>

<p>The tall man made no comment, but the landlord, his
amiability now in part restored, went on, "Yes. I'll bet he
carries a couple of hundred with him every time he comes through
here, and it's four journeys he makes a year." He became more
explanatory. "He's a travelling draper and covers six or seven
hundred miles each trip. Very smart man, and going to be married
soon."</p>

<p>A gaily-colored light delivery van pulled up before the hotel
and a dapper little man alighted and entered the bar. He shook
hands with the landlord and ordered a long beer. He noticed the
strangers. "Evening, gentlemen," he said politely, "a hot
day."</p>

<p>The stranger nodded without replying, the taller of them,
however, eyeing him intently.</p>

<p>The draper was of slight physique and of a rather foreign
appearance. He had a sallow, oval face and large dark eyes, and
he sported a heavy moustache, with the ends spikily waxed.</p>

<p>He chatted with the landlord, as he sipped his beer slowly.
"I shall be staying the night, Sam," he said presently. "I've a
little job to do on the car." He took out his watch and clicked
his tongue. "Gee! but tea must be coming on. It's nearly six
o'clock."</p>

<p>The shorter of the two strangers thereupon at once looked at
his own watch and, rising to has feet, picked up his hat. He
motioned to his companion and moved towards the door.</p>

<p>But the voice of the hawk-faced man broke in quietly. "We
want tea, too, landlord. We shall be sleeping here tonight."</p>

<p>The short man, after a moment's hesitation put down his hat
and, with no comment, resumed his seat.</p>

<p>In the meal that followed, strangely enough, the little
draper, in spite of the good fare provided, had anything but a
pleasant time. He had sat down prepared to enjoy everything, and
then all at once he began to worry and lose all interest in the
food.</p>

<p>It was not that he found himself in stiff or disagreeable
company. On the contrary, for the two strangers, the only others
there, were chatty, and affable in manner.</p>

<p>They discussed things in general; the weather, the likelihood
of rain coming and the varying merits of different motor cars.
They appeared interested in all he said, and laughed
appreciatively when he trotted out some of his old stock jokes.
Indeed, altogether their behavior was only what one would have
expected of ordinary, good-natured travellers at a casual
meeting.</p>

<p>Still the little draper was not happy, for his instinct was
telling him that, for some reason, he had become an object of
special interest to them, and very soon he was sensing an
atmosphere of danger as when, in his commercial ventures,
someone was trying to jockey him into a bad deal.</p>

<p>So he was not by any means in an easy frame of mind during
the meal, and when later he retired to his room and prepared for
bed, thinking everything over, he soon became positively
afraid.</p>

<p>He had a good sum of money with him, and he was sure the men
were crooks. They looked hard-up crooks, too, and the tall one,
particularly, he was certain, would stick at nothing, for his
eyes were hard and cruel and his mouth was set in a pitiless
straight line.</p>

<p>He thought then of his journey on the morrow, and the
forty-seven long miles he would have to cover before he struck the
next township, and fellow-men again. What then if they held him
up and robbed him?</p>

<p>He knew the dirt-track would be good, and if appearances
counted for anything, he would easily be able to outdistance
them in his car. But that would not help him if they got away
first and laid in wait for him, say, at Binders Creek, ten miles
out. He would have to slow down to walking pace when crossing
the bed of the creek there, and they would be able to get him
without any trouble if they were so minded to.</p>

<p>His heart beat violently as, sitting upon the bed, he stared
out into the shadows with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>That he was not the man to put up a fight he was quite aware.
Certainly there was a pistol in one of the side-pockets of the
car, but he would never dare to use it, for his, he knew, was
not the courage of lethal weapons. His bravery was of the
commercial kind, and there, he prided himself, he could hold his
own with anyone and chance his profits almost to the razor's
edge. But fighting&mdash;that was a different matter, and he
would never fit the bill.</p>

<p>For a long time he thought everything over and then his pulse
began to slow down and his confidence to come back. He saw what
he must do! He would be up and away by daylight, and then,
whether his suspicions were justified or not, he could escape
all chances of being held up.</p>

<p>He made sure that his door was securely fastened and then,
without undressing, threw himself upon the bed.</p>

<p>But sleep was long in coming, for the moment he had put out
his candle all his fears came back, and he tossed and fidgetted
until in the end he thought he would be awake all night. But
Nature had her way at last, and towards morning he sank into a
troubled slumber.</p>

<p>The night waned and the dawn grew dim, but he slept on
heavily, until suddenly he was awakened in the crisis of a
dreadful dream.</p>

<p>It was a dream that froze him to the marrow, for it struck at
him in a vital spot.</p>

<p>He dreamed that he had sold a woman a line of towelling,
three pillow-slips, and a colored counterpane, all of good
quality, and she had not paid for them and he did not remember
either her name or address. It was a dreadful dream and he awoke
shivering, and in a muck sweat.</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes and then sprang in consternation from the
bed, for it was broad daylight, and he heard a car being started
up in the yard. He looked at his watch and saw that it was past
8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Darting to the window, he was just in time to catch sight of
the two strangers driving off in their shabby car, and he bit
savagely at his moustache and his mouth grew very dry.</p>

<p>But daylight has always a reassuring effect upon the human
mind. The phantoms of darkness lose their grip, and so often
then, laughter and mocking take the place of fears.</p>

<p>And thus it was that morning with Bert Spinks, only a few
minutes after the strangers had gone.</p>

<p>His first shock over, he saw he had awakened to quite a
pleasant morning. A cool change had set in during the night, and
the overburdening heat of the previous day had gone. He heard
the landlord's wife bustling in the kitchen, and smelt the
agreeable smells of coffee and an appetising grill.</p>

<p>He was a fool, he told himself with a sickly smile. Yes, he
was a fool. It was a commonplace and everyday world in which he
lived, and highway robberies and hold-ups were only picture
stunts.</p>

<p>So he took heart again, and, symptomatic of his calmer state,
waxed his moustache tips to their usual points of
vanishment.</p>

<p>After breakfast he attended to his car, and by 10 o'clock was
waving a gay farewell to the landlord, as, with a gold-tipped
cigarette between his lips, he drove blithely away.</p>

<p>But, unhappily, his contented state of mind did not continue
for very long, and the moment he was fairly away from the
township, he began to become apprehensive again.</p>

<p>The track was so very lonely and the bush stretched for so
many miles on either side! If those men were really crooks, they
must have realised at once how easy it would be for them to put
a bullet in him and escape all consequences of their crime, for,
with his body buried under the sand, and his car driven deep
into the bush, they could be thousands of miles away before it
even began to be surmised what had happened to him.</p>

<p>Giving way to his fears, he had soon worked himself again
into a state of absolute terror, and a mile off the dreaded
Binders Creek, the last vestige of his courage left him, and he
turned his car round hastily and headed back to the
township.</p>

<p>It was instinct, he told himself. He was certain there was
danger. Of course, those men were waiting for him at the creek.
They would be just behind the rise on the far bank, and what
their intentions were, there could be no doubt. No, he would
wait at the hotel and not take to the track again until he had
someone to come with him. He could easily make some excuse to
explain his return. He would say he was not feeling well, or
that his car was giving trouble. Thank goodness, he was his own
master and could do exactly as he liked!</p>

<p>Quite confident then, that he was acting rightly, he drove
back to the township, but, when arriving before the hotel, he
saw the landlord there in conversation with another man, he felt
rather sheepish and the reasons he was intending to give for his
return no longer seemed quite as adequate as he had been
regarding them.</p>

<p>The landlord hailed him boisterously. "Good gracious! Bert.
Now what on earth had happened?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing much," replied the draper, now thinking all
suddenly again that he was a fool. "It's only that I found I'd
hardly any water in the radiator."</p>

<p>The landlord shook his head. "But it's Fate that's brought
you back, Bert," he said solemnly. "Fate and old Granny Henson's
prayers. Pete here was to have driven the old girl down to Yunta
this morning to catch the train to Adelaide, but he can't do it,
because now he's got a broken axle. Granny's in a dreadful
state, because there's no one else in the township today with a
car, and it's her great-granddaughter's wedding tomorrow." He
grinned. "I don't know whether it'll be quite proper, but you'll
take her now, of course!"</p>

<p>The little draper drew in a deep breath. "Sure, I'll be
delighted," he replied, in a voice, however, that did not sound
exactly like his own. "When will she be ready to start?"</p>

<p>"Straightaway," said the man whom the landlord had referred
to as Pete. "I'll have her here in less than ten minutes," and
off he went, at a run.</p>

<p>Bert Spinks made a pretence of filling up his radiator, and
then after a stiff rum in the bar, sat down to wait for his
passenger.</p>

<p>His feelings were mixed and, strange to say, it was amusement
that was now uppermost. He had been obsessed that it was
dangerous to take the track alone, and now, behold! a companion
had been thrust upon him. An old woman! It was a joke! His heart
palpitated unpleasantly and he had another rum.</p>

<p>Very quickly, in fact in less than the ten minutes specified,
Granny Henson appeared. She was very old and very deaf, but she
was tall, straight-backed and as stiff as a poker. She looked at
the draper with a pair of very troubled eyes, and thanked him
shakily for offering to take her down, but she made a great
demur when she found her seat was going to be an open one, next
to the driver.</p>

<p>"But I shall be cold," she croaked. "Can't I go inside?"</p>

<p>"No seats, marm," shouted back the draper, "only goods,
inside. But I tell you what I'll do. I'll lend you a nice thick
rug out of my stock. No,"&mdash;the rum was really very
strong&mdash;"I'll give you one. A real good Onkaparinga, and
you shall keep it, as a present to remember your great
granddaughter's wedding day."</p>

<p>The old lady was hoisted up, and well tucked in, and the
draper started his engine.</p>

<p>"Go easy, Bert," called out the landlord. "She's well over
ninety, remember." He winked his eye. "And no stopping on the
way, even if you are not yet a married man."</p>

<p>The little draper winked back delightedly and letting in his
clutch, for the second time that day the bonnet of the light
delivery van was turned for Yunta, Adelaide, and home.</p>

<p>In after years Bert Spinks often thought that there was much
in that ride of the nature of a dream, for, as in dreams, he
felt no astonishment at anything that happened. It seemed all
quite ordinary and commonplace.</p>

<p>As he drove along, the strong rum warmed within him, and he
felt as brave as a lion. Binders Creek held no terrors for him,
and he had no apprehension at all as to who might be waiting for
him there. Indeed, he seemed to be like a man who was playing
some huge practical joke, and he felt irresponsible and
light-hearted as a boy. He shouted small-talk to the old lady and
continually tootled up his horn, to amuse her by making the
parrots fly up among the trees.</p>

<p>The bank of the creek soon hove in sight and slowing down,
the draper tootled loudly half a dozen times, as if to make
certain that anybody waiting there should know that he was
coming. It pleased him not a little to imagine that he saw two
heads bob up quickly on the farther side and then, as quickly
bob down again.</p>

<p>He dropped into the bed of the creek very slowly, talking
loudly to the old lady all the time. Up the far side he crawled,
and then upon the top, he came upon, just as he had been
expecting, the two strangers of the previous night.</p>

<p>Their car was parked a little way to one side of the track,
and they were both leaning against it. The hawk-faced man was
frowning and his companion had got his mouth wide open, as if
very surprised. Hawk-face was holding his right hand in his
trouser pocket.</p>

<p>Still proceeding very slowly, for the track was rough, and of
course his passenger must not be shaken, the draper drew level
with the strangers, and then, with a grand flourish of his arm,
he gave them the time of day. But neither of them made any
response or took the slightest notice of his courtesy. All their
looks were concentrated upon Granny Henson, and they stared and
stared, as if for all the world they had never seen an old woman
before.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few seconds, and then, for Bert Spinks,
it was good-bye for ever to the strangers and their shabby
car.</p>

<p>A minute later, and in spite of all protests on the part of
Granny Henson, the light delivery van was touching fifty miles
an hour.</p>

<p>Everything then proceeded without mishap, and long before
noon the old lady was deposited with her friends in Yunta, there
to await the departure of the train for Adelaide, whilst the
draper, with no delay, and with an open throttle, took the track
along the railway line to Peterborough.</p>

<p>There had, however, been one little poignant incident at
their parting. The reaction from the two rums having long since
set in, the draper had been minded to put the Onkaparinga rug
back into stock, for the old lady being so very deaf, he was
hoping she had not heard him offer it to her as a gift.</p>

<p>But he at once found that he was quite mistaken there, for
whilst Granny Henson allowed him to carry in, without demur, all
the other items of her belongings, the old fingers clutched
tightly to the rug, and would not for one moment let it out of
their grasp. He sighed deeply, for the selling price of the
article was forty-six and six.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SOME six weeks later Bert Spinks was married to a big,
strapping girl of fine proportions, and in due time a noisy
little Spinks arrived to make great inroads upon the draper's
stock of baby clothes.</p>

<p>From the very first Bert was immensely proud of his
tomato-faced offspring and, the infant being a boy, he secretly
resolved to make of him a professional man. With this end in
view, then, as time went on, he grudged every penny that was
expended unnecessarily, and worried, when in his commercial
ventures, he did not consider his profits had been large
enough.</p>

<p>In his ruminating moments, too, it was always a grief to him
that he had once parted for nothing with a genuine Onkaparinga
rug, and that he had given it to an entire stranger whom he had
not seen before or since.</p>

<p>But it was one day, he excused himself, when the heat had
made him foolish, and he had mistaken two harmless and
inoffensive prospectors for assassins of the worst bushranging
type.</p>

<p>This memory rankled in him for a long time, but its
bitterness passed, all suddenly, about five years after his
meeting with Granny Henson.</p>

<p>At a loose end one afternoon in Adelaide, he was passing down
a side-street when his eyes fell upon an announcement in huge
lettering that a waxworks show was being held in a small hall
there.</p>

<p>"All the latest notabilities," he read, "and just added,
James Blendiron, the infamous murderer of Blakeside Farm."</p>

<p>He paid the admission sixpence and went in, but the waxworks
did not prove very entertaining and soon, becoming bored, he was
just about to leave again, when his attention was attracted to a
small group of people who were standing in awed silence before a
narrow alcove at the far end of the hall.</p>

<p>Idly curious as to what could be of such interest to them, he
strolled over, and reading a notice above the alcove that it
contained the exact representation of the Blakeside Farm
murderer, "true to life in every particular," he approached
close up, to see what the man had been like.</p>

<p>Then he received such a staggering shock that his breath come
in quick jerks, and his legs almost gave way under him, for, to
his amazement and horror, he recognised in James Blendiron, the
hawk-faced man of Binder's Creek!</p>

<p>There was no possibility of any mistake, and the eyes glared
at him now with the same relentless evil that had so filled him
with fear those years ago.</p>

<p>He had read all about Blendiron, as indeed who in the
Commonwealth had not? A man of dreadful crimes, who, at last,
after long immunity, had fallen into the clutches of the law,
and less than two months previously had paid the extreme
penalty.</p>

<p>The little draper wiped the perspiration from his forehead
and like an evildoer himself, crept from the hall.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">UPON his next journey through the bush, when he was passing,
as per schedule, through the little township where Granny Henson
lived, he enquired after her, and learnt, strangely enough, that
she had only a few days previously passed away. As she had been
the oldest inhabitant in the district, and in her hundred and
first year, a public subscription was being raised to provide
means for erecting a suitable headstone upon her grave.</p>

<p>To everyone's astonishment, Bert Spinks at once contributed
five pounds.</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder," mused the landlord of the hotel when he
heard about it. "I wonder"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders and
grinned. "But if she had only been about 80 years
younger"&mdash;he chuckled&mdash;"only about 80 years, after
that journey down to Yunta together&mdash;then I could have
understood everything."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1936-12-26"></a>THE PASSION YEARS</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Australian Women's Weekly</i>, 26
December 1936.</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>A charming story, in an Australian setting, of a<br>
man who had no money; a girl who had too much.</i></p>

<br>
<p class="first">THEY sat on the bed-edge, all pink and white in
their <i>robes-de-nuit</i>, and they looked pretty enough to
eat. Midnight had long since sounded but on, on, they chattered
like the race&mdash;old daughters of Mother Eve.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary, they just worship each other, and now they've got
the loveliest baby in all the world. And yet it all began to
happen only just a year ago to-day. Jim had never seen Della
until then, and I was the only one of our family who had spoken
to her.</p>

<p>"It seems just like a tale one reads and, of course, it's a
very sentimental one, too. Oh, no dear, you take it from me
sentiment is not all sickly, and only those say it is who are
getting old and sickly themselves. Sentiment's the most
beautiful thing in all the world, and when you're first in love,
well, the sentiment there is just too holy and too sacred to
understand.</p>

<p>"I tell you, when Harold first kissed me it was the most
wonderful moment of my whole life, and Mother says one of the
next most wonderful will be when they first put Harold's baby in
my arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, you goose! You needn't blush! Of course, you'll be
married yourself, some day, and a baby's only what every girl
who's really in love looks forward to. So, you needn't pretend
to be shocked at all.</p>

<p>"Well, about Della and Jim. We were on the racecourse at
Flemington, and Jim had plunged on his filly, Rose of Dawn, to
win a tremendous lot of money. Yes, it was awfully stupid of
him, I know, and I was as angry about it as anything. But then,
what can a sister do? I had told him how wrong it was of him,
and he had admitted to me that morning how foolish he had
been.</p>

<p>"If he lost, it meant quite the end of everything for him as
far as racing was concerned, for he would have to sell up all
his horses and never own any more again. And you can imagine
what that would have meant to him, dear, when all our lives we
have had horses about us and racing is in our very bones. You
remember it was Father who bred the great McAlpin, whose
children are now scattered all over the world.</p>

<p>"Well, it was just before the race and we were sitting in the
members' stand and I was telling Violet Carmichael something of
what Jim had done. I didn't tell her everything, by a long way;
but I let her know poor Jim would be very hard hit if his filly
lost, and that he would have to give up racing altogether and go
into a bank or be a curate or do something like that.</p>

<p>"I had just finished telling her when I turned round to find
that Della Charter was sitting exactly behind us and must have
heard everything. 'The little cat!' I thought, and I was
furious. I knew she was the only child of the rich old John
Charter, who had made millions of dollars in the wheat pit in
Chicago, and I disliked her because she was supposed to be
purse-proud, with all the money they had got. I just hated to
think she had heard all about Jim's money affairs. So I
pretended not to have noticed her, and then, before she could
get any opportunity to speak to me, Jim came up and the
starting-bell rang for the horses to be sent away.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, it was an awful race, and it will haunt me as long
as I live! Rose of Dawn should have won easily, but through no
fault of hers she was beaten in the very last stride. She got
off all right and, coming round the bend, was well up and only
just behind the leaders, running on the inside of them all.</p>

<p>"'She'll win,'" whispered Jim exultingly. "'She'll leave them
standing still, the moment she's called upon.'</p>

<p>"I felt my heart bursting with excitement. We could see them
all so plainly, as they came thundering into the straight, and
nothing was going as effortlessly as Rose of Dawn.</p>

<p>"But then, suddenly, the awful thing happened!</p>

<p>"Lord Rayleigh's great horse, Leviathan, swerved right in and
drove Rose of Dawn almost on to the rails. It was simply
ghastly! Her jockey had to snatch her up to prevent a most
dreadful accident. He had to pull her up, almost dead, and then,
when he brought her round again on the outside, she had lost her
good position and was lengths and lengths behind all the other
horses.</p>

<p>"I shut my eyes and felt as if I were going to faint, but
then, almost instantly, a perfectly thundering shout came up
from the crowd and I opened them again to see what had
happened.</p>

<p>"Rose of Dawn had been sent after the field again, and she
was galloping like the wind. She had her beautiful head low down
and was coming with a withering rush that was simply glorious to
see. Of course, it looked quite hopeless, for she was much too
far behind, but, realising what she was attempting, the very
courage of it appealed to everyone and the crowd just roared for
her to come on.</p>

<p>"Then almost in a few seconds, so it seemed, she was again
among the other horses. One after another she picked them up and
passed them as if they were common hacks, until ten yards from
home there were only two in front of her and she was close upon
the heels of even these. For a moment, then, everyone thought
she was actually going to win, for she headed Wild Aster when
three lengths from the judge's box, but with a fearful effort
the other horse, Poisoned Berry, just managed to keep his head
in front, and she was beaten in the last stride.</p>

<p>"Mary, I nearly wept, and poor Jim went white as death. But I
saw him draw in his face, as a proud man always does when he
meets defeat, and then he looked down and gave me a quiet, brave
smile.</p>

<p>"'It's all right, little woman.'" he whispered. "'It's all in
the game, and it was a great race, anyhow.' Then before I could
say a word to try and console him, the voice of Della Charter
broke in.</p>

<p>"'Say, Miss Bevan.' she said in that quiet, slow drawl of
hers, 'introduce me to your brother, will you? Sure, that was
the most wonderful race I've ever seen, and I guess I've lost
more on it than I'll ever lose again.'</p>

<p>"I turned round in a perfect spasm of fury. I would snap her
head off, I determined. The tactless and bad-mannered little
minx! To break in at a dreadful moment like that, when we were
both of us so strung up with emotion that even Jim's voice, as
she must have heard, was half-broken in his distress! Yes, I
would be downright insulting to her! I turned round, I say, and
then&mdash;I saw that with all her quiet drawl, her eyes, like
mine, were wet with tears.</p>

<p>"I introduced Jim, like a lamb.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, do you ever realise what angels we women can
be?</p>

<p>"There was Jim in a perfect agony of disappointment and
remorse. He was deep down in the depths, and left to himself,
with all his courage, would have fought out in dreadful
bitterness those next few hours, for there seemed no silver
lining anywhere to his cloud.</p>

<p>"But Delia stepped in and took all the sting out of
everything. She brought him back to common sense and hope.
Indeed, in a very few minutes he was looking at her as if he had
somehow, miraculously, something in the world even more
interesting than his beloved filly, Rose of Dawn.</p>

<p>"And I don't wonder she fascinated him. She looked so
beautiful that afternoon. Excitement had given her a most lovely
color, and, with those big grey eyes in that Madonna face of
hers, she looked the picture of a very beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"She asked Jim to take her down to tea, and then, to the
great envy of all the men, she kept him by her side all the rest
of the afternoon. She introduced him to her father, and Jim made
such a hit there that the old man insisted we should both dine
with them that night at their hotel.</p>

<p>"Then things began to move very quickly.</p>

<p>"They invited us up for ten days to a house-party at their
gorgeous place at Melton Bay, and there we mixed with some of
the most wealthy people in Australia. We had a glorious time,
and Della, to the great amusement of everybody, made a dead set
at Jim.</p>

<p>"There was no doubt about it. She singled him out, and the
two of them were always to be found together. Jim, of course,
was soon hopelessly in love with her, and, as the days went by,
he could not help seeing she was not indifferent to him,
too.</p>

<p>"But Jim is proud, and suddenly, to everyone's surprise, he
took to avoiding her and keeping as much out of her way as
possible. I knew what it was at once. He was thinking of Della's
money and wasn't going to have it said that he had run after her
because she was rich. Then poor Della began to look unhappy, but
she's quite as proud as Jim and wasn't going to try and lead on
any man who didn't want her. So she, in turn, became distant and
everybody wondered what had happened and if there had been a
quarrel.</p>

<p>"So things were up to the last day before the house party was
going to break up, and then I, if you please, stepped in. I
thought it high time I took a part in the game and went no
trumps on a heart hand.</p>

<p>"It was just after breakfast and I went to Jim in the
rose-garden, close by a spraying fountain. 'Jim,' I said curtly,
'you're a fool.' He looked at me very curiously. 'Well, what
about it?' he asked with a wistful smile. 'Della's in love with
you,' I blurted out&mdash;he got very red&mdash;'and everybody
seems aware of it but you'&mdash;he got even redder still.
'Yes,' I went on angrily, 'and you're making them all laugh at
her, because you don't propose.'</p>

<p>"Jim simply glared at me. 'You're quite mistaken, Dorothy,'
he said sharply. 'She's not in love with me. You women are
always imagining things.'</p>

<p>"'Imagining!' I cried hotly. 'Why, I'm positive about it! I
tell you again that you're a fool, for you're in love with her
yourself, too.'</p>

<p>"'I'm not a fortune-hunter, anyhow,' he said, coldly, and
without another word he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>"Then, not two minutes after, I met Della and, like Jim, she
looked pale and unhappy. 'Della,' I burst out impulsively 'Jim
loves you; but he won't tell you so because you're well-off and
he is not.'</p>

<p>"Just for one moment she seemed startled and then, but for a
suddenly heightened color, it might have been she had not taken
in what I had said. She looked at me gravely and her beautiful
face&mdash;she is very beautiful, Mary&mdash;had all the
calmness of perfect self-control. 'Yes.' I went on, 'and I've
just told him he's a fool. He's down there by the fountain and
if he's not weeping, too, it's only because he's a man.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you, Dorothy,' said Della, very quietly. 'I've always
thought you were a wise child.'</p>

<p>"She left me at once and turned to go into the garden, but
from what they told me afterwards I was able to piece together
most of what happened when, a minute later, she came upon Jim.
She found him by the fountain, where I had told her he would be,
and he smiled gravely as she approached.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
Della found Jim in the garden by the fountain.<br>
He smiled gravely as she approached him.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"She plucked a little rosebud and she held it out to him in
her beautiful white hand.</p>

<p>"'Isn't it lovely?' she asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"'Yes, lovely,' smiled Jim. 'I've always thought so.'</p>

<p>"Della then blushed crimson. She pretended to smell the
rosebud and brushed it over lightly with her lips. Della's got
such a pretty mouth, Mary, and if I were a man I should be
always wanting to&mdash;well, anyhow, Della kissed the rose and
held it out again towards Jim. 'You may have it,' she said, ever
so softly; 'that is, of course, if you really want it.'</p>

<p>"Della says Jim got white as a ghost, but he reached out and
took both the hand and the rose. 'Which may I have?' he asked in
a whisper, looking her straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Then Della says there was a long silence, until Jim suddenly
straightened himself up and let go her hand. 'I am too poor to
marry a girl like you,' he said, gently, and he made as if to
turn away. But Della laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>'Riches don't count always, Jim,' she whispered, 'and the
richest woman may be the poorest if she's not brave enough to
take love when it comes her way.'</p>

<p>"Then, I don't quite know what happened, for they won't,
either of them, tell me much; but I expect Jim took her in his
arms.</p>

<p>"No one saw either of them again until just before lunch, and
then they came into the lounge, where we were all waiting for
the sounding of the gong. They looked quite cool and ordinary,
too ordinary, I thought in a flash. Della came over to me and
kissed me. 'Oh, Della,' I exclaimed instantly, 'I'm so
glad.'</p>

<p>"'What about, dear?' she asked, blushing furiously and
darting, I saw, a quick glance at Jim.</p>

<p>"'You darling,' I replied, 'your cheeks smell of
tobacco!'</p>

<p>"Everybody burst out laughing, and then Jim kissed her
brazenly in front of us all.</p>

<p>"'Now, you little fibber,' I asked presently, 'tell me
exactly what you did lose that afternoon when Rose of Dawn was
beaten.'</p>

<p>"Della looked radiant. 'I lost my heart, Dorothy,' she
whispered. That was all.'</p>

<p>"Well, they were married six weeks afterwards and this
morning, at a quarter-past five, I was made Aunty Dorothy. Yes,
dear, I think we had better go to sleep now; but isn't my
nightie pretty? Those bows&mdash;oh, well, you see pink is
Harold's favorite color, and soon&mdash;but there, you're
blushing again. Good-night, Mary. Keep to your side of the bed
and pinch me if I snore. Yes, it's a good thing the baby is a
boy, for if it had been a girl I'm sure they'd have wanted to
call it Rose of Dawn."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1940-08-29"></a>THE HANGING JUDGE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide, 29 August 1940</h3>

<p class="first">THE night was dark and tempestuous but, with
the heavy curtains drawn and a bright fire burning, the
atmosphere of the well-furnished room was that of relaxation and
comfort.</p>

<p>Apparently, however, there was no appreciation of his
surroundings by the bowed old man, sitting huddled in the big
arm-chair and staring so intently into the fire. His face was
strained and troubled, and one hand was pressed tightly over his
heart, as if it pained him there.</p>

<p>"God, that ever I should have lived to see a son of mine
tried for murder!" he muttered bitterly. "Five days of anguish
for me, and can I wonder this poor old heart of mine is worrying
me? Ah, but it was a near thing and up to the very last it
looked as if the jury might convict him! The evidence of his
guilt was so overwhelming that everyone must be saying now it
was only the extraordinary summing-up of the judge which saved
him." He sighed heavily. "But for that summing-up he would be in
the condemned cell to-night."</p>

<p>"Of course, he was guilty? I knew quite well he was. I had
not seen him for five and twenty years, but I could tell when he
was lying. He lied just as his mother used to lie when she was
deceiving me. He has that same trick of hooding the eyes she had
when she was not going to speak the truth, and I saw that he was
lying the whole time he was under oath."</p>

<p>He went on with another deep sigh, "Thank God he did not know
his father was present, seeing and hearing everything. But then
he has never heard of me. He thinks that other man was his
father and that both his parents have been dead these many
years. Doris said on her death bed she had told him nothing and
I believe she was speaking the truth there."</p>

<p>"Of course, I know Harold had ample provocation for
committing the murder, remembering, as I always do, how the
serpent first came into my home. The dead man was of evil
character and undoubtedly bent upon leading Harold's wife
astray."</p>

<p>The old man sighed for the third time and for a little while
his mutterings were stilled. Downstairs, in the kitchen, the
servants were playing cards and, while the butler was dealing,
the cook remarked with a shiver, "I'm sure we're going to hear
of a death soon. Those three tea-leaves in a straight line in my
cup to-night meant someone dying, I'm quite certain."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" commented the butler jocularly. "And I'll bet
it'll be that rat which has been coming into my pantry. I set a
trap for him just now."</p>

<p>The old man in the room above had started to mutter again.
"But let me think clearly," he said into the fire. "Now was
Harold's acquittal actually all due to that summing-up? Had I
been one of those jurymen, what should I have been thinking when
old Macarten had finished for the Crown? Should I have been
believing my son guilty then?"</p>

<p>He shut his eyes wearily. "But I will go over the whole
dreadful story again, just as it was unfolded in the Court, day
by day. I will recall everything from the very beginning, until
that last moment when Harold stepped down out of the dock a free
man, and see how it strikes me now."</p>

<p>"Harold is twenty-six and the cashier in a suburban bank. He
has been married for two years to a girl who is not yet twenty-
one. There are no children, but their home is a happy one and
they do not quarrel. The murdered man was a bachelor, a
stockbroker in the city, and up to three months ago had been a
close friend of the family. Harold, however, had not liked his
visiting Dorothy when she was alone and had told him so,
bluntly. The friendships had in consequence been broken off at
once and, subsequently, when the two men had met at the houses
of mutual acquaintances, it had been noticed they were distant
towards each other."</p>

<p>"We come now to the fatal night of Mrs. Brendon's dance in
her big house, facing the river and with only the road running
in between. The party was a large one for the coming of age of
the only daughter. Forty-four people had accepted and four rooms
upon the ground floor had been specially set apart for them. In
one the men left their hats and coats, in another they danced,
in the third there were five tables set out for bridge and in
the fourth was a buffet where the guests helped themselves to
refreshments.</p>

<p>"The stockbroker, Denbigh, was the last to arrive, and it is
suggested Dorothy was on the lookout for him and saw him coming
up the drive in his car. At any rate, she went immediately, as
she explained afterwards, to get some cigarettes which Harold
had left in his overcoat."</p>

<p>"One of the maids happened to go into the cloakroom almost at
the same time and came upon Dorothy and Denbigh there. She said
they were standing very close together and it looked as if
Denbigh had been about to kiss Dorothy when she, the maid, had
so unexpectedly come in. She testified, also, that Harold passed
along the passage at that exact moment and must have seen
everything, because she saw him glance into the room as he went
by."</p>

<p>"Nothing more of any importance happened until about eleven
o'clock, when Denbigh left a girl with whom he had been dancing,
with the explanation that he had to go out to look at his car.
It was a frosty night and he wanted to run the engine for a few
minutes, so that the water in the radiator should not
freeze."</p>

<p>"The party went on until about half-past one and then, when
all the guests had gone, Mrs. Brendon remarked to her husband
that she had seen very little of Denbigh during the evening and
that he had not even come up to say good-bye. She thought it
strange."</p>

<p>"The next morning, to everyone's amazement, Denbigh's car was
found to be still round by the side of the house, where it was
known he had parked it when he had arrived the previous evening.
Mrs. Brendon thereupon immediately rang up Denbigh's flat, to
learn from his housekeeper that he had not returned home and
that no message had been received to account for his absence.
Later in the day his body was found in the river, among the
weeds, not two hundred yards from the Brendon house, and the
evidence adduced at the inquest proved conclusively that he had
been thrown into the river to drown, after having first been
rendered unconscious by being knocked down by a blow upon his
jaw. There were all signs that this blow had been delivered with
a clenched fist.</p>

<p>"The following day a taxi driver went to the police and told
them that just after eleven upon the night of the murder, when
passing along the road in front of the Brendon's house, he had
seen someone hurrying into their drive and had recognised him as
the cashier of the local bank.</p>

<p>"My son was arrested that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Now, there were five reasons for suggesting Harold must be
the murderer, and Macarten thundered them all in with the craft
and cunning of a great advocate who has practised in the
Criminal Courts for thirty years. One, Harold had every cause to
hate the murdered man. Two, his temper had been wrought up to
frenzy by seeing Denbigh had been about to kiss his wife. Three,
he had been at the bridge tables most of the evening and, once,
when he had been dummy, had absented himself from the room for
quite an appreciable time. Upon his return he had apologised for
keeping the game waiting, with the explanation he had been to
the refreshment buffet. Four, the time of his absence from the
room had been about eleven o'clock, coinciding exactly with the
time it was known the deceased had gone out to attend to his
car. Also, it had been about that time, too, when the taxi
driver had seen my son hurrying from the road into the drive.
Five, when the police had arrested him he had a small half-
healed abrasion upon one of the knuckles of his right hand."</p>

<p>"Yes, those were the five points against him and they made a
damning indictment. Old Macarten was at his best and I could see
he was impressing the jury."</p>

<p>"Harold put on a bold front in the witness-box, too bold I
thought. He denied scornfully that he hated Denbigh, and the
man's partiality for his wife only amused him. He had not seen
them together in the cloak room, as he had not been in the
passage at that time. He had not left the house at all during
the evening and had never gone farther from the card room than
the refreshment buffet. As for the piece of skin off his
knuckles, well, he didn't remember what had done it. It might
have happened when he had been mending a tennis racquet the
previous afternoon.</p>

<p>"His defence was certainly straight-forward enough, but it
was evident the jury did not believe him. They looked very
coldly at him. Then Macarten was upon his feet again, slashing
the defence to ribbons. A brazen defence, he scoffed, and just
what was to be expected from a brazen murderer! The accused,
with great boldness, had taken the terrible risk of being seen
carrying the unconscious body of the man he had struck down
across the public highway and now, with the same effrontery he
was endeavoring to bounce the jury into believing he was not
guilty of the murder."</p>

<p>"As Macarten's impassioned speech had proceeded, I had seen
the faces of the jury harden, until it was apparent to me they
had made up their minds and were intending to convict my son.
His guilt was clear, and I would have had no mercy had I been
one of them. When Macarten resumed his seat a hush of awed
expectancy filled the court. Now, nothing but the judge's
summing-up stood between my son and a verdict of wilful
murder."</p>

<p>"And what chance had he there, no doubt all were asking
themselves? Was not this judge, in all arraignments upon the
capital charge, notorious for leaning always to the side of the
prosecution? Was he not even called the hanging judge?"</p>

<p>"So, as this fateful summing-up began, my eyes roved round
the court and I took in the varying expressions of those
assembled there. Macarten was leaning back, flushed and
confident; the jurymen were looking anywhere but at the
prisoner, as jurymen always look when they are about to hand
over an accused to death; the spectators were stirring uneasily
at the thought of seeing the putting on of the black cap, and
Harold, with his face as white as chalk, was moistening over his
dry lips with his tongue."</p>

<p>"Ah, that summing-up; what a surprise it was to
everyone!"</p>

<p>"When it began to take shape, when the drift of it was
realised, a change began to manifest itself everywhere in the
court. Macarten's look of confidence was replaced by one of
bewildered surprise; the jurymen frowned as if they were very
puzzled, and the quietness of the court lost something of its
dreadful hush, as if it were no longer the vestibule to a
chamber of death. Harold, too, began to regain something of his
lost color."</p>

<p>"What had happened?"</p>

<p>"The incredible! The hanging judge was actually summing-up in
favor of the accused! The vulture upon the bench had become as a
cooing dove!"</p>

<p>"Then I saw the expression upon Macarten's face pass quickly
from that of astonishment to one of intense anger, for none
would have been realising better than he that, in defiance of
all the damning evidence which had been brought forward against
the accused, the judge was now apparently straining every nerve
to bring about the man's acquittal. The spectators were quick to
sense it, too, and began to breathe more freely. A verdict of
wilful murder was no longer so certain and they might, after
all, be spared the horror of hearing a fellow creature sentenced
to death."</p>

<p>The old man paused here, his emotion appearing to have
carried him almost to the verge of exhaustion. He was now
clasping both hands over his heart. In a few moments, however,
he drew in a deep breath, and, in his anger, his voice rising to
louder tones, he went on bitterly. "Yes, I could hear myself
speaking coldly and dispassionately as became one clothed in the
majesty of the law, but to my shame I knew I was abusing my high
office deliberately to defeat the ends of justice. I was
cheating the gallows. I was preserving a life which was forfeit
to the law."</p>

<p>He shook his head mournfully. "But never have I pleaded
better. Every art which I had learned in seventy years I used to
save my son. Every trick of oratory which was my gift, I called
into play to confuse and mislead the jury. I belittled every
point the Crown had made. I cast doubts upon the reliability of
every witness they had called. I warned vehemently against the
pitfalls of evidence which was purely circumstantial. I
urged&mdash;but God, my heart, my heart! I cannot breathe! It is
my punishment and I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Downstairs the butler had just played the ace of spades. "And
that means you're finished," he exclaimed triumphantly to the
cook. "You've taken your last trick, and&mdash;but, hark! What's
that? It sounded like someone falling! It must have been the
master! Quick, upstairs with me! Quick!"</p>

<p>"Those tea leaves, those tea leaves!" wailed the cook,
following him in a run towards the door. "I knew they meant
something!"</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1940-09-19"></a>THE WORM WITH THE STING IN HIS TAIL</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide, 19
September 1940.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">THE bull-necked man at the desk frowned at the
meek-looking, little, elderly one who was standing so
obsequiously before him.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you, Binns," he said sharply, "to tell you
that as from Saturday next we shall no longer be requiring your
services."</p>

<p>The little man's eyes opened very wide and his fingers
twitched nervously. "You are going to get rid of me,
Mr.Higgins!" he exclaimed, as if he could not believe what he
had heard. He swallowed hard. "Then you are displeased with the
way I have been carrying out my duties?"</p>

<p>The head of the Bacchus Wine and Spirit Company shook his
head. "No, not exactly," he replied. He pursed up his lips. "But
you are getting old, Binns, and I prefer to have younger people
about me."</p>

<p>Binns spoke tremulously. "I have been a good servant to the
firm, sir. I have worked very long hours. I have always been the
first to come in the morning and the last to go away at
night."</p>

<p>"And that was what you were paid for, wasn't it?" commented
Mr. Higgins brusquely. "You got your money every week." He
shrugged his shoulders. "No, you needn't grumble. You have had a
good innings here."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but Mr. Higgins," protested the little man, "you
arranged with Mr. Henry when you took over the cellars to keep
me on. You promised him you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was three years ago," retorted Mr. Higgins testily,
"and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not quite three years yet, sir," corrected Binns
quickly, "not three years until the third of next month." He
spoke modestly. "I have a good memory for dates, sir, and it was
upon the third of July, the year before last, when the business
was sold."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins waved a big and fat hand. "Well, three years or
two years, what does it matter?" He nodded, "At any rate, now
Mr. Henry has died I feel absolved from my promise."</p>

<p>"Of course, I know no mention of my being kept on was put
down in the deed of sale, sir," went on Binns sadly, "and
everything was left to your&mdash;&mdash;." He stopped suddenly
and then added chokingly, "I would just tell you, sir, that I
have no money saved and an invalid wife to support."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins was arranging the papers upon his desk. "Your
private affairs, Binns," he commented coldly, "your private
affairs, and I am not concerned with them."</p>

<p>"I have been here a long time, sir, a very long time,"
pleaded Binns.</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Mr. Higgins, "and for that reason, when you
leave us on Saturday you will receive an extra fortnight's
salary."</p>

<p>Binns's lips moved rapidly, as if he were making a lightning
calculation. "And the fortnight's salary being £5, sir," he
said, with his voice now a little more steady, "it will mean
that for each of the forty-two years I have been here I shall be
receiving about two shillings and eightpence halfpenny." His
smile was a sad one. "I am good at figures as well as dates,
sir."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Mr. Higgins, "and they are useful gifts to
possess." He nodded again. "Well on Saturday you will hand over
your keys, and we shall not be seeing you any more."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then Binns said meekly, "I
shall be missed, sir. I have been useful to you, and always most
solicitous for the good reputation of all members of the
firm."</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt!" commented Mr. Higgins, without taking
his eyes from his desk. "But you can go, now, Binns. I have told
you all I wanted to."</p>

<p>Binns, however, seemed disinclined to terminate the
interview. Instead, he remained twiddling his thumbs and eyeing
his employer intently. "And you will give me a good reference,
sir?" he asked at length. "Thank you, sir. I think I shall try
if Messrs. Taggart &amp; Taggart will take me on."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins looked up with a jerk. "Why Taggart &amp;
Taggart?" he asked with a hard frown. "Why them in
particular?"</p>

<p>"We-ell, sir, replied Binns hesitatingly, "With your being so
friendly with their Mr. John"&mdash;he coughed
slightly&mdash;"and the members of his family, perhaps they may
be more interested in me than if I had been working for a firm
they knew nothing about."</p>

<p>A moment's intent scrutiny of Binns's face, and Mr. Higgins
remarked carelessly, "Oh, that's it, is it? Well, do as you
please," and he resumed his interest in the papers upon his
desk.</p>

<p>Binns drew in a deep and resolute breath. "Last Wednesday
week, sir," he went on, "it was the 19th&mdash;I told you I was
good at remembering dates&mdash;when I came in here the first
thing that morning, I picked up a lady's compact on the
carpet."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins jerked up his head again, this time even more
sharply, and for a few seconds glared bewilderingly at Binns.
Then his face took on a dusky hue. "It belongs to my wife," he
said with a great affectation of carelessness. "She lost one,
but didn't remember where. Have you got it here now?"</p>

<p>Bin ignored the question, "But it couldn't have been dropped
by Mrs. Higgins, sir. She was away in Scotland at the time. I
heard you telling Mr. Bruce so that same morning. Besides, the
compact had the initials R.F.T. upon it." He coughed discreetly.
"I believe, sir, Mrs. John Taggart's Christian names are Rita
Fanny."</p>

<p>A dead silence followed, and then Mr. Higgins said angrily.
"You are making it all up. You found no such compact here. It is
a damned lie."</p>

<p>"But it is not, sir," said Binns earnestly. "I did find the
compact here, and I showed it all round to the young ladies in
the office; but, of course, I did not mention how I had come by
it. I made out I had picked it up in the park as I was coming to
work. I did not let them see the initials, either. I kept my
thumb over the corner."</p>

<p>"Give it to me!" ordered Mr. Higgins angrily. "You are a
thief."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," said Binns firmly. "If I did not find it here,
as you are so certain, then it can have nothing to do with you.
If I give it up to anyone it must be to the police. It is a
valuable compact, sir, solid silver, and I don't want to get
into trouble."</p>

<p>If looks could have killed, Binns would have been a dead man.
"What's your game?" snarled Mr. Higgins. "Are you attempting to
blackmail me?"</p>

<p>Binns looked horrified. "No, no, sir, I wouldn't think of
such a thing." He produced his discreet cough again, "You see,
sir, whatever information one may gather, it is not blackmail
until one tries to make use of it to extort money from someone.
I have a cousin, sir, an inspector at Scotland Yard, and he has
told me that."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" asked Mr. Higgins, with his face as
black as night. "What are you making out you found that compact
here for, if it's not for the purpose of blackmail? What do you
want, I say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing at all, sir," replied Binns, looking as if
most hurt. "I only mention the matter to you to let you see, as
I say, how zealous I have been for the reputation of the
firm."</p>

<p>"Then that compact you are talking about," asked Mr. Higgins,
"where is it?"</p>

<p>Binns looked very stupid. He pretended to think. "For the
moment, sir," he said hesitatingly, "for the moment I have
forgotten where I put it. Indeed, I may have lost it altogether.
Sometimes my memory, except for dates and figures, is very bad.
I forget things so quickly." His face brightened. "Why I might
even forget, sir, you had said you would have to be getting rid
of me shortly."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins made no comment. He stared hard at Binns, but the
fury in his face was now replaced by a sullen frown.</p>

<p>Binns went on firmly. "No, sir, I cannot find that compact."
He spoke most respectfully. "But for my own sake I shall forget
I ever saw it." He nodded solemnly. "I never talk."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins saw it was no good to press the matter. "You can
go," he said quietly, "and about your leaving us on
Saturday&mdash;&mdash;" he appeared to hesitate&mdash;&mdash;
"well, as you have been with us so long and have no money saved,
I suppose we shall have to keep you on."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Binns meekly. "I am sure it is very
kind of you," and he glided from the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins gritted his teeth in fury. Of a most masterful
disposition and successful in all his business affairs, it was
gall and wormwood to him to have now to knuckle under to a
creature like Binns, whom he had always despised as little
better than a worm in intelligence. He was shrewd enough,
however, to realise he could not afford to make an enemy of him,
at any rate for the time being.</p>

<p>He thought for a long while and then picked up the receiver
upon his desk and put through a call.</p>

<p>"Hullo, that you, Fan?" he asked softly, but very distinctly.
"You lost that silver compact John gave you, a couple of weeks
ago? Well, damn it, that night we came in here after the
pictures and split a bottle of Champagne, you dropped it in my
room and it was picked up by one of the clerks the next morning.
No, no, there's going to be no fuss, but from the initials on
it, this clerk guesses whose it is and won't give it up. He
pretends he's lost it, which I know is a lie. No, no, it's not
going to be awkward for us. He's not going to talk, and it only
means I can't give him the sack which I was intending to. That's
all. Now you listen. We must look ahead and make things quite
safe if he starts blackmailing me. You are coming up to the Lord
Mayor's Show tomorrow, aren't you? Well, call in here on your
way home and bring John with you. Then, later on, if the compact
business should crop up, you can make out you lost it here then.
See? No, it's quite all right and you needn't worry in the
slightest. Then I'll be seeing you and John tomorrow.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and smiled a grim, cunning smile.
"That'll settle him," he nodded. "That'll spike his guns. In a
couple of weeks or so I'll say Fan thinks she dropped her
compact when she came here with her husband, and it'll be deuced
awkward then for little Blackmail Binns. If, as he says, he did
show it to the others, they'll be remembering his tale about
picking it up in the park, but it'll be a thousand to one they,
none of them, will recollect the particular date."</p>

<p>The next afternoon Mr. and Mrs. John Taggart dropped in to
have a glass of wine with Mr. Higgins, and the lady was greatly
admired by the firm's employees as she passed through their
room. It was agreed she was a very pretty woman, and Binns, in
particular, eyed her with great interest. That night, too, after
he had returned home she was very much in his thoughts.</p>

<p>Binns was by no means the creature of poor intelligence his
employer imagined and, when he chose to exert himself, was quite
shrewd and farseeing. So, thinking over Mrs. Taggart's visit to
the office that afternoon, he envisioned possibilities of
trouble for himself at some future date. His employer might give
him the sack with perfect safety if it could be made out the
lady had lost her compact when upon her visit with her husband
upon Lord Mayor's Day.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with the purpose of forestalling any action Mr.
Higgins might make, the following morning Binns announced to the
clerks, generally, and to the five girl ones in particular, that
he was intending shortly to present the silver compact he had
picked up to one of the latter.</p>

<p>"I have not seen it mentioned in any advertisement for lost
articles," he said, "and so I think it will be quite all right
my giving it away."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a dear, Binney," exclaimed the sprightly Mary
Weston, "but who's going to be the lucky one?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, you'll have to draw for it," replied
Binns.</p>

<p>"Then when's the drawing going to take place, today?"</p>

<p>Binns shook his head. "No, not today. I think I ought to keep
it at least a month or six weeks, in case any advertisement
appears." He pretended to think. "Let me see, when did I find
it?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Mary Western promptly. "It was a fortnight
yesterday, on a Wednesday. Don't you remember I said you ought
to give it to me for my birthday, and that was two days
afterwards, on the Friday, the 21st."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was on the Wednesday," supplemented another girl.
"Silver Box was running in the Bibury Cup that afternoon and we
backed it because you had picked up the silver compact." She
looked reproachful. "You cost several of us a hard-earned
shilling that day."</p>

<p>"Stop talking, you girls," reproved Mr. Eden, the head clerk,
sharply. "You'll only be making mistakes if you mag on like a
lot of monkeys," and the room subsided into quietness again.</p>

<p>The days sped by and Binns was left in peace. He made no
mistake, however, in thinking that his encounter with Mr.
Higgins had passed out of the latter's mind. On the contrary,
for his employer never came in contact with him without giving
him a nasty look. He made his displeasure felt in another way,
too. It was Binns's special duty to keep an account of the stock
in the cellars, and now, if Mr. Higgins wanted to know anything,
instead of sending for Binns himself, he had taken to making his
enquiries through Mr. Eden who had in turn, had to come to Binns
for the information and pass it on. No, Binns was quite sure Mr.
Higgins was not going to take his defeat lying down, but was
only waiting his chance to get his revenge.</p>

<p>And things happened exactly as Binns expected.</p>

<p>One morning, about three weeks later Mr. Higgins strode into
the clerks' room. "Mrs. Taggart," he announced frowningly,
"thinks she lost a silver compact here when she came the other
day with Mr. Taggart. It has her initials, R.F.T., in one
corner. Have any of you seen anything of it?"</p>

<p>Faces dropped instantly, a dead silence fell over the room
and uneasy glances were made in the direction of Binns.</p>

<p>Binns, however, spoke up unhesitatingly. "She lost it that
afternoon, sir," he asked, "when she came in after the Lord
Mayor's Show? On the fifth, wasn't it?" and Mr. Higgins had to
nod a grudging assent.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," went on Bums smilingly, "I've not seen it
anywhere, but, strangely enough, I found a silver compact a
fortnight before. I picked mine up in the park as I was coming
to work on Wednesday, the 19th of last month," his smile was
most ingratiating, "but, of course, it couldn't have been the
one Mrs. Taggart lost a fortnight later."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins spoke in a voice of thunder. "And who else
besides yourself knows the exact date when you found this
compact you say you picked up outside?" he demanded
accusingly.</p>

<p>Binns appeared in no way disconcerted. "Oh, everyone here,
sir," he replied smilingly. "Directly I showed it to them, Miss
Weston wanted me to give it to her for her birthday, which was
not until two days later, the 21st."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Higgins," added Mary Weston timidly, "I did ask for
it for my birthday, which was coming on the following
Friday."</p>

<p>The face of Mr. Higgins was a study. He bit his lip hard and
glared so angrily at Mary Weston that it might almost have
seemed that she had herself admitted stealing the compact.</p>

<p>The head clerk now added his corroboration. "It is as Miss
Weston says, sir," he said. "It was while we were stocktaking
that Binns was showing the compact round and I ordered him to
put it away, as he was hindering everyone in their work and we
shouldn't be finished in time. If you remember, sir, the
stocktaking was over in the week ending the 22nd."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins turned without a word and left the room. He did
not dare trust himself to speak. He was too furious.</p>

<p>Binns's feelings were mixed. He was elated that he had been
far-seeing enough to guess what his employer would do, but at
the same time depressed because the latter was so evidently
vengefully disposed towards him. He knew his master's character
and that once the latter had decided upon any line of action he
would not easily be turned from it. Still, Binns was an
obstinate man himself, and now determined he would not leave the
firm until he felt inclined to. He liked his work in the
cellars, and their smell, even, had become a part of his life.
No, he would stick it out until his own good time and then,
accepting the inevitable, give notice himself.</p>

<p>While he remained, however, he would be very careful what he
did, and give his employer no chance of putting anything up
against him. And, as events proved, it was well he kept his eyes
open.</p>

<p>A few days later complaints began among the clerks that money
was being taken from their coats and handbags whenever they were
left in the cloakrooms. Joe Henderson swore that some coppers
had gone from the pocket of his overcoat and another clerk
missed two shillings in the same way. Then Miss Brown had a
pound note taken from her handbag, which she had forgotten to
bring in with her and place in her desk.</p>

<p>The head clerk thought it his duty to mention the matter to
Mr. Higgins, whereupon the latter looked very grave. "Then we
have a thief among us," he nodded ominously, "and we shall have
to find out who he is. Don't tell anyone you've told me and in a
few days we'll set a trap."</p>

<p>So, one morning the following week, Mr. Higgins called Miss
Brown into his room. "See here," he said, "we must find out
who's taking this money. So here are two ten-shilling notes and
two half-crowns; I have got the numbers of the notes and the
half-crowns are marked. Put them in your handbag tomorrow and
forget to bring the bag out of the cloakroom when you arrive in
the morning. Then if we find any of the money has been taken
we'll have detectives in to search everybody in the
building."</p>

<p>Miss Brown was staid and elderly and could be trusted to hold
her tongue. The next morning she did as she had been bidden and
the bait was left for the thief to take. About eleven o'clock
she found one of the notes had gone and immediately informed Mr.
Higgins.</p>

<p>"Good," nodded her employer, "then I'll slip out and get in
the detective at once."</p>

<p>Now it happened that a few minutes later Binns had occasion
to go to his overcoat for a pocket handkerchief, and he noted
with surprise that the flap of one of his pockets was tucked
inside. He was puzzled, for he was very methodical and was
certain he had not left the flap like that. Wondering if any
joke had been played upon him, he thrust his hand down into the
pocket and felt carefully round. Immediately he came upon a hole
in the lining and was more puzzled than ever because he knew it
had not been there before.</p>

<p>Quickly withdrawing his hand, he felt outside round the edge
of the overcoat, in case anything had been pushed through the
hole. Then his eyes bulged and he caught his breath as he felt
the unmistakable crinkling of a treasury note.</p>

<p>"Gosh," he exclaimed, "it's a plant! Someone's intending to
fix me up!" and in a flash he had taken out his pocket-knife and
was cutting the lining. With hands which shook he drew out a
ten-shilling note.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whispered breathlessly, "what an escape!"</p>

<p>Barely five minutes later, he was sitting at his desk in the
big room among the other fifteen employees of the Bacchus Wine
and Spirit Company, when the door opened sharply and Mr.
Higgins, followed by two men and a woman, walked in.</p>

<p>The head of the firm looked very stern and grim. "It is a
dreadful thing," he announced, "but there is a thief among you.
Someone has taken a ten-shilling note from Miss Brown's handbag
and it must be one of you in this room. These gentlemen and this
lady here are detectives, and I must request all of you to
submit to a search. Your overcoats and bags will be brought in,
too, and gone through." He glared round. "Now, does anyone
decline to be searched."</p>

<p>Binns spoke up excitedly. "But it may not be necessary, sir.
It may be all a mistake that anybody's stolen a ten-shilling
note, for I picked up one, only two or three minutes ago, in the
passage just outside your room. I thought it must be yours and
so put it upon your desk. I've just told Mr. Eden about it." He
smiled his pleasant smile. "I happened to glance at the number,
sir, and I think it included three sevens."</p>

<p>One of the detectives, who seemed to be in charge of the
others, looked down at a piece of paper he was holding in his
hand. Then he looked up and nodded to Mr. Higgins. "That's
probably the one," he said, and he frowned as if in annoyance
that they had been brought there upon a fool's errand. He made a
move towards the door. "Now where's your room, sir? We'll settle
the matter at once."</p>

<p>He left the room with the positively astounded Mr. Higgins
and everyone sighed a sigh of great relief. A buzz of subdued
conversation followed, but it did hot last long, for the
detective returned almost immediately. "It's all O.K., ladies
and gentlemen," he announced with a grim smile. "The note was
the one Mr. Higgins had thought had been stolen and so there's
nothing doing this time."</p>

<p>The staff saw no more of their employer that day, but again
Binns's elation was mingled with apprehension. He realised more
than ever that he would have to be most wary or his employer
would be getting him in the end.</p>

<p>To his great astonishment, however, Mr. Higgins seemed quite
all right again the next morning and twice called him into his
room to ask him about the stock on hand in the cellar, his
manner being so pleasant that Binns began wondering if, after
all, he had been the one to plant the note in the overcoat
lining.</p>

<p>Another week went by and then, one afternoon, Binns was
summoned again to his employer. "About that '67 port, how do we
stand?" the latter asked, and he spoke as if Binns were among
his greatest friends.</p>

<p>Binns told him and, after a few more questions, was dismissed
with the customary curt nod Mr. Higgins always gave to his
employees. Then, just as he was leaving the room, Mr. Higgins
called out, "Oh, now you're here, go down and fetch up a bottle
of the Bollinger. I'm expecting visitors in a few minutes," and
he made a motion with his hand in the direction of a small and
narrow door in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>The small door opened on to Mr. Higgins's private staircase
leading down to the big cellars of the building. The staircase
went down about twenty feet and was narrow and very steep. A
handrail was provided at one side, without holding on to which
the descent was hardly safe.</p>

<p>Binns had often been down to the cellars by that way before
and, opening the door, made to switch on the light at the head
of the stairs. But the light did not come on and he thought the
lamp must have fused. Familiar, however, with the stairs he
prepared to go down.</p>

<p>"Be quick," called out Mr. Higgins. "I think I hear my
visitors coming now."</p>

<p>Now it happened that that morning Binns had got a touch of
rheumatism in one of his knees and was using that leg as
tenderly as possible. In consequence, with the first downward
step he took, he leaned heavily upon the rail to support
himself. Then, to his consternation, the rail came out of its
protecting socket with a jerk and it was as much as he could do
to prevent himself falling head-long down on to the stone flags
of the cellar below.</p>

<p>Realisation of what had happened came to him in a
light&mdash;and he caught his breath in consternation. Another
trap had been set for him and he had escaped only by the merest
chance! Turning round, he shakily descended the stairs
backwards. Then, when at the bottom, he looked up and would have
sworn he saw the shadow of his master's head upon the open door
above. Mr. Higgins was waiting&mdash;listening to hear him
fall.</p>

<p>He returned with the bottle of champagne as if nothing had
happened, but, as he was expecting, there were no visitors
waiting for it.</p>

<p>"I must tell you, sir," he said, "that the rail has worked
loose, and is in an unsafe condition. I had better send James to
put it right," and, without lifting his eyes from the figures he
was pretending to add up, Mr. Higgins nodded a surly assent.</p>

<p>That night it was a long time before Binns got off to sleep.
His thoughts were most uneasy ones, for he was really frightened
of to what lengths, even to deliberate murder, his employer was
prepared to go to get rid of him. For the moment Binns was
inclined to throw up the sponge, and, himself, give notice the
next morning, but in the end his obstinacy prevailed over his
fears, and he resolved to continue to stay on.</p>

<p>A few days later, however, a dreadful tragedy occurred, and
all Binns's fears for his own safety were swept away. Mr.
Higgins met with a fatal accident, being killed instantly. It
happened in this way.</p>

<p>Binns was alone in the cellars when he inadvertently dropped
a match and set alight to a little heap of straw. It was really
only a small matter and not much damage could have followed in
any case, but Binns lost his head in his fright and shouted,
"Fire, fire!" as if the whole building were in imminent
danger.</p>

<p>The staff came rushing down pell-mell. Mr. Higgins, up in his
room, must have heard the cries, too, for the door opening on
the narrow staircase was heard to open violently. Then, it was
remembered later, some of them had thought they heard a muffled
cry at the far end of the cellar where the staircase was. For
the moment, however, everyone had been so occupied with
extinguishing the blazing straw that no notice had been
taken.</p>

<p>When, however, the fire had been put out, Mr. Eden, the head
clerk, exclaimed, "The Gov'nor! Where's he? He must have heard
the noise!"</p>

<p>Then someone called but, "Good God, what's that lying on the
stones?" and all, rushing up, saw the body of their employer
huddled up at the foot of the staircase, with its head turned at
a dreadful angle. Mr.Higgins was quite dead. He had broken his
neck by falling from high up on the staircase. Later, it was
discovered that one of the steps had unaccountably worked loose,
and it was realised that must have caused him to fall.</p>

<p>He was buried a few days later, and all the men employees of
the firm attended the funeral. By special request of the
executors, Binns, as the oldest servant of the firm, was one of
the pallbearers, and it was noted by many with what sorrowful
dignity he carried himself.</p>

<p>The business was taken over by one of Mr. Higgins's nephews,
and when, six months later, Binns handed in his resignation, in
recognition of his long services to the firm, he was granted a
pension of thirty shillings a week.</p>

<p>Binns did not, however, really need the pension, as he was
the owner of the house he lived in, as well as those on either
side. From the two latter he drew quite a comfortable little
income.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, he had not&mdash;as he told Mr.
Higgins&mdash;an invalid wife. On the contrary, she was in the
best of health, and, incidentally, twenty years younger than he
was. She was very fond of him. Also, another strange thing,
Binns had no cousin an inspector in Scotland Yard. His only
blood relation was an uncle, who was a street bookmaker, and the
latter often twitted his nephew that he had not courage enough
to have a bet with him. He said he was a born coward and would
never dare to take any risks. As we have seen, however, he was
greatly mistaken.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1940-11-07"></a>DOCTORS OFF DUTY</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
7 November 1940.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">AN important medical congress had been opened
that morning in a big northern city, and, after dinner that
night, a little party of medical men were smoking and talking in
the library of a palatial mansion which was giving them
hospitality for the duration of the congress. Their host, a
wealthy manufacturer, had arranged with the organising committee
of the congress to put up a round score of the visiting members,
and, his house and grounds being among the show places of the
district, he had been allotted some of the chairmen of the
various sections. He was now thrilled at entertaining such
distinguished members of the profession under his roof.</p>

<p>"And I suppose," he laughed, "I should be quite safe tonight
if I were to be suddenly attacked with any kind of disease. I
mean there must be a specialist here for almost everything."</p>

<p>"Certainly there is, Sir Herbert," laughed back a merry-looking
little man who, for all his diminutive size, was one of
the best known authorities upon nervous diseases in the Western
Hemisphere, "and among the lot of us I am sure we should be able
to manage your decease somehow. With all the new drugs which
have come out lately we should have a splendid chance."</p>

<p>"And people have the idea," went on Sir Herbert jokingly,
"that in no calling in the world are there so many really good
and really bad men as among you doctors."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" commented the nerve specialist, but now speaking
quite seriously. "The very nature of our work, with all its
opportunities, brings out both the best and worst in us." He
nodded. "But I like to think that, considering our number, there
are very few black sheep among us. Occasional money-grabbers, of
course, who trade with their eyes for ever upon the till and who
put in every extra visit they can and operate wherever they
guess there's a bit of cash." He nodded again. "Still, those are
the exceptions and the majority of us are quite decent men."</p>

<p>"In a district near where I am," growled an old and grizzled
general practitioner, the panel and lodge patients of whose
practice ran into many thousands, "there's a fellow who boasts
he takes out an appendix almost every morning before breakfast."
He shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know where he finds them. I
often see a hundred patients a day, and it's an event when I
send a patient into hospital for an appendicectomy. And it's the
same with tonsils. I don't agree with this wholesale taking of
them out."</p>

<p>"But perhaps you're a wee bit old fashioned, Dr. Gregson,"
smiled a bright-faced young surgeon, prominent among the ear,
nose and throat men in the West of England. "You general
practitioners are not ready enough to appreciate the beautiful
new instruments and appliances which are being turned out for us
by the manufacturers."</p>

<p>"I, certainly, am slow there," said the old G.P. frowningly.
He nodded significantly. "But my patients live just as long
without them and they probably suffer a great deal less."</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure they do, Dr. Gregson," smiled a great Harley
street consulting physician. He went on banteringly. "All these
young surgeons think of is cutting you about. They're crazed to
open you somewhere. It's your blood they want."</p>

<p>Another physician chimed in in the same vein. "Quite right,
sir, there is a false glamor about surgery, and so many in our
profession want to make it the hallmark of cleverness if they
can cut you open and you don't die on the operating table.
They'd like the public to think so, too."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded a second general practitioner darkly, "and I
know several men who can do a good operation and yet who are
rotten doctors, for all that. With many minor ailments they are
perfect duds and can't treat even an ordinary indigestion
properly." He smiled. "It's we common G.P.'s who are the salt of
the profession, and no man becomes a great surgeon&mdash;I don't
mean a good operator, for that doesn't necessarily mean a good
surgeon&mdash;unless he has first graduated from among us."</p>

<p>"But why," asked their host, looking rather puzzled, "does a
good operator not always mean a good surgeon?"</p>

<p>"Well, he may only have operated because he has made a faulty
diagnosis," replied the G.P. "Suppose you go to him with a hard
swelling in a gland and he tells you you've got a growth there
and cuts the whole gland out. Then he finds the swelling is only
a hardened abscess and all he need have done to put you right
was to have lanced it. Now, although he may have done a perfect
operation you wouldn't call him a good surgeon, would you?" He
shook his head. "No, a good surgeon must be a good physician,
first."</p>

<p>A famous surgeon who could command almost any fee for his
operations took up the tale. "You are quite right, Dr. Hensley,"
he said. He shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly. "I know that
what little success I have had I owe entirely to the foundation
the five gruelling years I spent as an assistant up North gave
me. My employer had a huge practice among the poorest classes
and my work made a good physician of me." He smiled a grim
smile. "A shilling for a consultation, including a bottle of
medicine, and, as with Dr. Gregson here, our visiting list ran
into hundreds a day."</p>

<p>"But what could you do to them," asked his interested host,
"when you were attending to so many?"</p>

<p>"All that was necessary," replied the surgeon. "As with my
employer, I became most expert in making a lightning diagnosis.
Some, I could see with one glance, had nothing much the matter
with them, and two minutes was all they got." He nodded. "Others
may have taken up half an hour." He turned to the old general
practitioner. "That's the way you handle them, too, is it not,
Dr. Gregson?"</p>

<p>Dr. Gregson nodded. "And I've been so long at the game that I
can tell with one look at them whether they're heart, lung or
kidney cases." His old shrewd eyes glinted. "Ay, and also
whether I'll be getting my money paid."</p>

<p>There were smiles all round, and then their host, addressing
them all, generally, remarked, "And, of course, being brought in
contact with so many people, you must have had many very
interesting experiences."</p>

<p>"We have," replied an old doctor, Dr. Smith, who was not far
off eighty and who had given up active practice for some years,
but who in his time had been noted for his successes in
difficult cases of midwifery. "And it is only natural," he went
on, "for the life of a medical man is one great adventure from
start to finish, from beginning to end. We are present at all
the crises of our patients' lives, their births, their deaths,
and all the sicknesses and accidents in between. No, we can't
help seeing and hearing a lot."</p>

<p>"Then tell us one of your adventures, Master," called out a
young doctor. "We all know everything you say is worth listening
to."</p>

<p>The others joined in with the request, and the old man was
flattered. "Well," he said slowly. "I'll give you a little bit
of romance, and the moral it points is the absolute trust which
most people have in their medical man. I mean a confidence which
they take to themselves as a matter of course. They are sure
that if he knows any secret about them he will not give them
away. There is no need for them to exact any promise."</p>

<p>He spoke fervently. "Gad, in this particular instance I held
a woman's secret for nearly fifty years, and yet, ignoring there
was any secret to hide and that I knew all about it, during all
that time she lived a happy, smiling, and confident life! She
was certain I should never give her away."</p>

<p>A rustle of interest stirred round the room, and the old man
went on. "What happened was this. When I was quite young,
indeed, only just qualified, I went to look after the practice
of a man who had been ordered away for a long voyage, and who
would not be returning to work for a year."</p>

<p>"I had not been there long when a young woman came in to book
me"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"for the forthcoming interesting event
so natural with members of her sex. She had left things rather
late, and there were only a few weeks to go. She was very
pretty, and I guessed at once there was tragedy about the
business, because she said she was a stranger to the town and
all upon her own. She asked me to engage the nurse and not get
an expensive one. She told me she was twenty-two, but I was sure
she was younger than that. She said she was Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>"In due time, after some little anxiety for me, as the case
was by no means an easy one, the baby was born in the house
where the girl had apartments. She was a little daughter, and
when delivered was not pretty to look at, as there was a big
naevus covering the whole of one side of the face and the entire
nose as well." He turned to his host. "I mean, Sir Herbert, she
had one of those port wine stain birthmarks which are so
disfiguring for anyone when they grow up, and particularly so
for a girl. This one was so big that it would have been
impossible to do anything for it." He frowned. "There was also a
deformity of one foot. The child was not breathing when she was
born.</p>

<p>"I made a lightning decision as to what I should do, and all
my life long I have never regretted what it was. The mother was
in a bad way and needed all the attention I could give her. The
child was, so obviously to me, born out of wedlock, and if she
lived, unsightly as she would grow up, would have to face both
the pity as well as the scorn of the world. So"&mdash;he paused
a few moments&mdash;"if she had come from heaven I let her
return there straightaway. I made no attempt to start the
breathing." He looked round the room. "Now does anyone here say
I did wrong?"</p>

<p>A silence followed, and, no one taking up the challenge, he
went on&mdash;"The mother soon got well, and in a fortnight
passed out of my life, as I thought, for ever. I never expected
to hear or see anything more of her. But I was greatly mistaken,
for a little over two years later I met her again.</p>

<p>"I had gone up North and set up in practice in a district
where it was destined I should remain for the rest of my
professional life. A couple of months or so after I arrived I
was invited to a dance and there, to my amazement, was
introduced to my one-time patient, the pretty Mrs. Brown. Her
name was now given me as Miss So-and-So, but, of course, I
recognised her at once, realising at the same moment that she
had recognised me, too. Still, only just a quick intake of
breath, a levelling of the beautifully arched eyebrows and a
lightning look of dismay in the soft grey eyes, and that was all
the evidence of recognition she showed. I thought her prettier
than ever, for now the sadness upon her face had passed. She
quite fascinated me. We had several dances together, and I took
her into supper, but our conversation was just the ordinary
conventional one, and there was not the slightest allusion to
our having met before.</p>

<p>"Later, I was told that she and her people had not long come
to live in the town, and that she had there met and become
engaged to a very nice young fellow. It was to be an excellent
match for her, as the boy was very well-off. I became friendly
with her family, and when the marriage took place was present as
an esteemed guest.</p>

<p>"None of her people were then patients of mine, neither were
any of her husband's. So I was very astonished when one day,
less than a year later, her husband called upon me and asked me
to attend his wife in a few months' time. I went to see her
professionally, and, in the course of our conversation, she
remarked with a smile, "I thought I would prefer you to anyone
else as you would understand me."</p>

<p>The old doctor slapped his hands together. "And that was the
only remark with any suggestion of reference to my earlier
association with her she ever made. Just think of it! For nearly
fifty years I was an intimate friend of the family, as well as
being their medical attendant, and yet&mdash;she never asked me
to keep silent about what I knew. It never entered into her mind
that I should betray her secret. She never so much as said. 'I
can trust you, can't I? You'll never mention about that Mrs.
Brown?' No"&mdash;his old eyes glowed with pride&mdash;"she took
it for granted she could rely upon my honor, without making any
appeal to me."</p>

<p>He went on. "Besides this first child of her happy married
life, I brought four more into the world for her, and lovely
children they all were. Then, as the years rolled on, I was the
first to set eyes upon the little ones of her two daughters, and
when a much loved and greatly respected old lady was carried to
her last resting place, shortly before I gave up
practice"&mdash;his voice was reverent and solemn&mdash;"her
secret was buried with her." He spoke huskily. "That is my
little story, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"A very interesting one, Dr. Smith," commented his host, "and
you told it very nicely, too."</p>

<p>"Well, as I say," said the old doctor, "the only moral I
wanted to point was the unquestioning reliance the ordinary men
and women place upon their medical men, and, I believe,
deservedly so."</p>

<p>Another doctor spoke up. "Now I'll tell you a little story
and it's a humorous one. It points no moral and, if it be true,
rather reflects upon us as a profession." He laughed. "We need a
little taking-down sometimes." He drew the eyes of his audience
upon him and began.</p>

<p>"Two well-to-do elderly ladies lived in a small country town,
and the younger of them fancied she was not in good health, and
always upon the verge of a complete breakdown. In consequence,
she was a reliable source of income to the local medico, who put
in an almost daily visit, with a becomingly solemn face. The
patient didn't get any better, which was not to be wondered at,
when you realise she had nothing the matter with her. Still, the
elder sister began to get worried, and one day told the doctor
she thought a specialist from London ought to be brought
down.</p>

<p>"The doctor considered, and then, remembering an old
fellow-student of his who had risen to eminence, and with whom he
thought he would like to have a yarn, suggested, well, we'll
call him, Sir Pompey Flapdoddle. The sister was quite agreeable,
and so Sir Pompey was communicated with, and he came down.</p>

<p>"Now, this elder lady was most anxious to know from what
disease her sister was really suffering, and, accordingly, made
arrangements to listen in to what the two doctors would say when
they came to discuss the case after the examination in the
bedroom had taken place. So she kept out of the way when the
great man arrived, and secreted herself behind a screen in the
room into which they would be shown afterwards, to talk things
over. Sherry and biscuits had been provided.</p>

<p>"The examination over, the two medicos duly came in. The door
was shut carefully, and the sister prepared to listen hard. The
old friends at once began to talk animatedly together. They
spoke of their hospital days and the happy times they had had;
of their old fellow-students and what had become of them; how
White had worked up a big practice in Liverpool, how Black had
died of fever on the West Coast of Africa; how Green had married
a rich wife, and now did nothing but play golf. Then they
exchanged a few stories which made the listener behind the
screen hold her breath in horror, while the narrators themselves
were muffling their laughter so that it should not be heard
outside. And all the time not a word had been said about the
patient. She had not been referred to in any way.</p>

<p>"Presently the listener heard the pushing back of chairs and
the great consultant say, 'Well, old chap, it's been very nice
to have a chat with you, and many thanks for having me
down.'</p>

<p>"'Not at all, my dear fellow,' said the local medico. 'I
shall always be only pleased to do anything I can.'</p>

<p>"'Then, good-bye, my boy,' went on the consultant, 'and good
luck to you,' and they both walked towards the door.</p>

<p>"'Here, one moment!' exclaimed the other, 'You've not given
me your opinion of the patient. What do you think of her?'</p>

<p>"'Think of her?' laughed the consultant, 'why, I think she's
the ugliest old woman I ever saw.'</p>

<p>"'Ha, ha!' laughed back the local man, 'but you wouldn't say
that if you had seen her sister. She's even uglier still.'"</p>

<p>When the general laughter which the story had evoked had died
down, the famous surgeon stirred in his chair, and began slowly.
"But, harking back to operations which the few unscrupulous men
among us perform when they know perfectly well they are not
necessary, although it's in the nature of a confession, I'll
tell you what I once did." He looked upon everyone with a grim
smile, and lowered his voice impressively. "For the first and
only time in my life I myself performed an operation which, when
I did it, I was absolutely convinced was wholly
unnecessary."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment to let his words sink in, noting with
some amusement the astounded looks upon the faces of his
audience.</p>

<p>He went on&mdash;"Yes, it's an extraordinary story, and
brings home the almost inconceivable things which may happen to
any of us. I was just over thirty then, and struggling to get a
footing as a surgeon in London, and with no private means behind
me. You will all understand what that meant, keeping up
appearances and half-starving to do it. I had taken my 'master
of surgery,' and by great good luck been appointed an assistant
surgeon at St. Bengers. Of course, that helped me a bit, but
private patients were coming in very slowly, and there were many
days when I sat in my expensive consulting room in Wimpole
street and didn't see a soul."</p>

<p>"At that time my main standby was Sir Benjamin
Luke&mdash;dear old Ben&mdash;the greatest surgeon of his day.
He was very kind to me, and I often picked up a few guineas from
patients he sent me. In fact, but for him I am sure I should
have had to go back to an assistantship with some general
practitioner, as all the money I had saved had been spent in
trying to establish myself where I was. I particularly mention
that to make you all realise under what obligations to him I was
at that time.</p>

<p>"Well, one morning he rang me up. He was going away that same
afternoon for a month's holiday, and he was sending me a man
called Martin, who would be coming straight away, and whose
appendix he wanted me to remove as speedily as possible. It was
not, however, an acute case, but one of long-standing
inflammation, and the patient was a slippery one to handle. For
months and months he, Sir Benjamin, had been urging him to have
it out, but the man had been shilly-shallying and unable to make
up his mind. Now things had come to such a pass that to delay
any longer would be really dangerous.</p>

<p>"Still, bad as his condition is," went on Sir Benjamin over
the phone, "you'll have to bounce him into it. When you've
examined him you must give him no time to think, but take him on
the hop and rush him into hospital immediately. Operate today as
a matter of extreme urgency. That's the only way you'll get him
before it comes to an actual perforation. Oh, and remember, he's
unreliable in everything he says. To put it plainly, he's a
dreadful liar. He may say he has no symptoms at all, or he may
describe ones quite different from those he really has. He's
inclined to be very secretive, too, and likes to make a mystery
of everything. So, if he's in the mood he may not mention me at
all, and say nothing about my having told him to come to you. If
he doesn't choose to tell you that, you act as if you knew
nothing, and just deal with him as a new patient who has been
recommended to you, you don't know by whom. You understand the
position. Take no notice of anything he says, insist that an
immediate operation is a matter of extreme urgency, and don't
give him the opportunity to change his mind. Rush him into
hospital I say."</p>

<p>The surgeon went on&mdash;"I kept close to my consulting room
all that day, but it was not until towards the end of the
afternoon, and just when I was disappointedly thinking the man
was not going to turn up that he arrived. As I have already told
you, patients were not very plentiful with me, and, in
consequence, my nurse came into me with some natural excitement.
'A new patient, doctor,' she said. 'A Mr. Martin, and he wants
to know if you can see him without an appointment. I told him I
thought I could put him in in a few minutes if he waited.'</p>

<p>"So I kept him waiting a quarter of an hour, prepared,
however, to rush out at any moment if I heard any movement in
the hall which suggested he had got tired of waiting. Ah, you
smile! But that's a custom well-known to the profession and I
dare venture we've many of us done it in our time. To go on.
When, at length I had him shown in, I thought him at once, as
Sir Benjamin had intimated to me, a secretive and
uncommunicative man, as he did not mention who had recommended
me to him and, moreover made no reference to any abdominal
symptoms. His only complaint was that for a long time he had
been suffering from severe frontal headaches which quite
incapacitated him while they lasted. He had lately begun to fear
he must have a tumor on the brain.</p>

<p>"I paid little attention to what he told me about his head
and, apparently to his great surprise, made him strip, and
started to examine his abdomen. Then, to my amazement, I could
not find the very slightest trace of anything wrong. I pushed
and pummelled, but there was absolutely no tenderness, and the
abdomen was that of a normal healthy man.</p>

<p>"I was in a dreadful quandary! What was I to do? How could I
possibly make out the instant operation was imperative? Yet, was
I to pit my judgment against that of a great surgeon like Sir
Benjamin, than whom no one had a more profound knowledge of the
diseases of the abdomen? Should I send this man away, telling
him he had nothing the matter with him which a holiday and some
mild sedative might put right, when all along for many months
the renowned Sir Benjamin Luke had been insisting he was
seriously ill and in grave danger? Then, another consideration,
was I to run the risk of offending my best friend, the one man
who had helped me whenever he could? It was a dreadful position
for me to be in."</p>

<p>The famous surgeon sighed heavily. "Gentlemen, I gave in. I
stifled my conscience with the feeble excuse that, after all, I
was only obeying the orders of one much older and wiser than I.
So I told the patient all Sir Benjamin had bidden me. Oh, yes, I
frightened him right enough, and, patting myself upon the back
for succeeding where Sir Benjamin had failed, made him enter a
hospital within the hour, arranging that I would operate at nine
o'clock that night.</p>

<p>"Everything seemed to be promising well until I got a 'phone
call from a medical man in a town about forty miles from London.
He said he was a cousin of this Mr. Martin and, having just
heard of the operation, would like to be present. He asked when
it was going to take place, and I had to tell him.</p>

<p>"I was aghast! The last thing I wanted was a shrewd
G.P.&mdash;and most of you G.P.'s are shrewd enough, in all
conscience&mdash;seeing the healthy appendix I was going to take
out. So, plunging even deeper into the mire, without letting
this cousin know anything about it and under an excuse of
urgency, I advanced the time of the operation an hour, and it
was all over and I was well away from the hospital and not to be
got at again that night by the time he had arrived in town. I
heard next day that, when he had asked to see the offending
appendix, he had been most disappointed to learn I had taken it
off with me.</p>

<p>"The next morning the patient said he was feeling fine. The
wife was by the bedside when I appeared, and she thanked me most
gratefully for having made her husband have the operation
performed so quickly, thus giving him such a little time to
think about it beforehand. I tell you I felt horrible, but tried
hard to console myself, as I had done before, that I had only
been obeying orders, and had acted exactly as Sir Benjamin would
have done had his services been available."</p>

<p>The surgeon paused here to light a cigarette, and then
continued. "Now, for the perfectly astounding sequel. That same
afternoon I was seated once more in my consulting room, as usual
disengaged, when in came my nurse, looking, as she had done the
previous day, quite excited. "There's another new patient here,
doctor," she said, "of the same name as the one who came
yesterday, another Mr. Martin, and he says he's been sent you by
Sir Benjamin Luke."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed incredulously, with a cold shiver running
up my spine. "Another patient of the name of Martin, and he says
he's been sent by Sir Benjamin!"</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor, and he wants to see you as quickly as possible.
He says he's in pain and thinks he ought to be operated upon
immediately."</p>

<p>"God, I felt sick with horror! What a ghastly mistake! I've
operated upon the wrong man!</p>

<p>"I ordered him to be shown in instantly, and at once the
urgency of the matter was beyond any possibility of doubt. The
man was in a very grave condition, and not a moment must be
lost. Indeed, things looked so bad that I wouldn't let him even
return home, but drove him straight to the hospital, where the
other Martin was. Fortunately, he had had nothing to eat that
day, and the moment I could get the anaesthetist round, in not
much over an hour, he was being put under the anaesthetic.
Heavens, I was only just in time! The abscess would have burst
in a matter of only minutes!"</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and looked round smilingly. "Well,
the two Martins were soon convalescent and reclining upon the
balcony together, no doubt discussing the coincidence of the
similarity of their names and complaints, and the wonderful
doctor who was attending to them. He nodded emphatically. "But
wasn't it a marvellous thing that, when I was expecting one
Martin, two of the same name should appear one after the other.
Of course, I know Martin is not a rare name, but it's by no
means a common one."</p>

<p>"And did you get a big fee from the first Martin?" asked one
of the other doctors banteringly.</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head smilingly. "No, only a very
moderate one, and I sent it as an anonymous donation to my
hospital." He laughed. "But the patient expressed his
willingness to pay double or treble the amount, as he had
benefited so greatly from the operation. You see, from the day I
took out his appendix he never had a single one of those
headaches which had been his curse for years and years. That was
an extraordinary happening, too."</p>

<p>"But not so extraordinary as you perhaps think, doctor,"
broke in his host immediately, "as I happen to know just such a
case in my own family. My poor father, who is dead now, was
cured of dreadful headaches in exactly the same way, when he was
quite a young man. A surgeon in London, I don't remember his
name, took out his appendix, it must be nearly thirty years ago,
for precisely the same reason." He laughed merrily. "Why, if you
hadn't told us your patient was called Martin, you might be the
very doctor who operated upon my father, for ours, too, is a
name which might easily have had a double. There are plenty of
people about called Hunter." He rose from his chair and made a
movement towards the door. "But come on, now. We'll go and join
the ladies. They are going to give us some music."</p>

<p>"Whew, but what a narrow escape that was!" murmured the great
surgeon under his breath. He swallowed hard. "What a mercy I
didn't give the right name! Fancy after all these years meeting
the man's son! Gad, as old Smith has just told me, we medical
men do see life!"</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1941-03-27"></a>"SECRET SERVICE"</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
27 March 1941.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">IT was in the old untroubled days before
Dictators walked the earth and the scene was the lounge of a
luxurious hotel upon the Cornish Riviera. The hour was after
dinner, and a number of the guests had been discussing the case
of a well-known public man who mysteriously disappeared from his
home a few weeks previously, after it had been found out he had
for many years been leading a double life.</p>

<p>"And, of course, there would be a woman in it!" drawled a
cynical-looking man about thirty. There's a woman in everything
when there's any trouble. They cause it all."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" snapped an aristocratic blonde who always had a
little cluster of admirers round her. "It's you horrid men who
make all the trouble. You never leave us poor women alone." She
turned to a distinguished looking old man who was regarding them
all with an amused smile upon his clever, intellectual face.
"Isn't that so, Dr. Smith? We are quite harmless if left to
ourselves, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Quite harmless!" nodded the old doctor emphatically. He
fibbed with great gallantry. "I've never yet known a woman do
anything wrong." He shook his head. "But about this particular
man we've been talking of; a great deal too much fuss is being
made about his disappearance, simply because he happens to be
well in the public eye. Why, if we only knew it, a hundred and
one such mysteries are taking place every day under our very
eyes!"</p>

<p>"And I expect you, as a doctor, could tell us some very
interesting stories of double lives, if you only would," nodded
the blonde.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I could," agreed Dr. Smith readily. His old eyes
twinkled. "Only they mightn't be all true. You've heard just now
what a dreadful fibber I can be."</p>

<p>The blonde looked pleadingly at him. "But do tell us a story,
doctor. There's nearly always something a little bit improper
about doctors' stories, and it will give some of us girls a
chance to lower our eyes and show off what nice long lashes
we've got. Yes, tell us a story, whether it's true or not."</p>

<p>The others joining with her request, the old doctor said at
last, "Well, I'll tell you one, and the great merit of it will
be that it's quite true. It points out in what mystery we can be
living for years and years and yet&mdash;be quite unaware of
it." He settled himself back comfortably in his chair. "Now it's
about a young fellow whom we'll call Jack Robinson. He was the
only son of well-to-do parents and had been living the usual
life of most young men of his class, good public school, then on
to a university, plenty of money for sport, cars, travelling
about, and all that. It had been intended he should become a
medical man, but he wouldn't settle down to anything and idled
about for so long that at last his father got sick of him and
all his ways. There was a quarrel and he left the house with
only a few pounds in his pocket and with no prospects at
all.</p>

<p>"I knew the family well, and about three months later ran up
against the boy in the Strand. He looked shabby and down at
heel, and there was no doubt things were not going too well with
him. He was annoyed with meeting me, and curtly refused the
offer of a couple of pounds, getting away as quickly as possible
to escape any questioning. I saw no more of him until some
months later we chanced to meet again, one evening in the West
End. To my astonishment, he was looking quite his old self
again, smartly dressed and with all signs of prosperity about
him. Standing well over six feet, I thought what a good-looking
young fellow he was. I asked what he was doing, but he shook his
head and declined to say.</p>

<p>"I suggested our dining together at the 'Rialto'&mdash;you
know, one of the best and most expensive restaurants in
London&mdash;and after a little hesitation he agreed, but only
on the condition that I came as his guest. I was a little bit
disturbed because I knew, as well as he would know, that the
dinner and the wine there would cost him at least fifty
shillings.</p>

<p>"Into the Rialto we went, and one thing struck me at once. He
was most anxious not to be noticed and tried to make himself as
inconspicuous as possible by humping his shoulders and keeping
his head down as we made our way to the table he had selected at
the far end of the restaurant. All the meal time, too, when he
was taking stock of the other diners, it was his eyes only and
not his head which he moved. Yes, for some reason, he was
undoubtedly most uneasy.</p>

<p>"Regardless of the price, he ordered a bottle of vintage
champagne, with the evident intention of impressing upon me that
he had plenty of money. I asked him again how he was making his
living, but he only smiled and, upon my saying that at all
events I hoped he was doing it honestly, he replied evasively.
"Oh, yes, as things go nowadays!" We had a pleasant meal
together and then, upon parting, with some hesitation, he asked
me as a favor that if I should happen to come across him again,
unexpectedly, wherever he was, unless he spoke to me first would
I please take no notice and appear not to recognise him. He
wouldn't explain any more, but, of course, I promised.</p>

<p>"I didn't see him again for a very long while, but some two
years later got news of him through a mutual friend who had
happened to come across him in one of those many new garden
cities which have sprung up recently just outside the
metropolitan area. He was married to a very pretty girl and they
were occupying one of the largest and best houses on the estate.
They had a good car, kept two maids and were about the most
well-to-do among the little community in which they lived.</p>

<p>The old doctor paused here and beamed round upon his audience
with twinkling eyes as he asked, "Now, what do you think his
occupation was supposed to be?"</p>

<p>"I know," answered the blonde. "He'd become a bookmaker, of
course!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," reproved Dr. Smith indignantly. "His work
was much more romantic than that."</p>

<p>"He was a dress-designer," suggested the cynical-looking man,
"and and had all the lovely women in London buzzing round him
like flies."</p>

<p>"He told fortunes," said a second man, "and the police were
after him."</p>

<p>Dr. Smith nodded solemnly. "He was in the Secret Service and
told off to watch all the most dangerous spies coming to London.
That's what my friend had found out."</p>

<p>"Oh, how thrilling," exclaimed the blonde, "but did everybody
know it?"</p>

<p>"Of course, they didn't! Only a very few, just his wife's
parents and her relations. He was the mystery man of that little
garden city. Later I met his wife and heard all the story of his
coming there and the sensation he had made. It was most
interesting for, although so well-off, he'd had a lot of
difficulty in getting the girl. Her father was a middle-aged
clerk, upon a small salary, in a tea broker's in the city and,
sensible and well-balanced, he had a great objection to giving
his daughter to anyone who was so evasive about his occupation
that he would not disclose where he went to work every day.</p>

<p>"I must tell you here that there were lots of boys after
Margaret, that was the girl's name, and she had no end of
chances of making a good marriage for one in her position. Her
parents may have been commonplace and not much to look at, but
she herself was a real little beauty and with her lovely
profile, perfect features and aristocratic bearing it might
easily have been imagined she came of a long line of noble
ancestors.</p>

<p>"Well, just when it seemed the young couple would have to
elope to get married, the whole difficulty was smoothed out in a
most unexpected manner and, all in a few moments, Margaret's
father was completely satisfied as to young Jack Robinson's
fitness to become his son-in-law.</p>

<p>"It happened, Jack had had tickets given him for a swell
flower show in Chelsea, organised by society people in aid of
some charity, and he took Margaret and her parents with him. The
latter would not have gone or indeed, have allowed him to take
Margaret if they had not heard a certain Royal Duke might be
coming. Sure enough the old Duke and his Duchess put in an
appearance and proceeded to mingle unobtrusively with the other
visitors. Then, to the parents' stupendous amazement, His Royal
Highness, happening to catch sight of Jack Robinson, gave him a
most friendly nod, actually exclaiming, 'Hope you're enjoying
yourself, Robinson?' Then apparently taking in that Jack was in
the company of a remarkably pretty-looking girl, he added
smilingly, 'And I see flowers are not the only beautiful things
here this afternoon.'</p>

<p>"Margaret's parents were almost overwhelmed with pride, but
Jack appeared to think little of it, just explaining modestly
that his work often brought him in contact with most important
people.</p>

<p>"Jack and the pretty Margaret were married shortly afterwards
and, later, Jack became reconciled to his father, driving down
unexpectedly to the latter's place in Hampshire one Sunday
afternoon. Margaret had by then grown into a very beautiful
woman and had presented her husband with a lovely little boy.
Apparently, Jack was in better circumstances than ever, but he
declined to give his father any further information as to his
occupation except to tell him, exactly as he had told Margaret's
parents, that he was in the Secret Service.</p>

<p>"More than ten years passed by and then, quite by accident I
found out what he was actually doing. One night I was visiting
one of London's most luxurious hotels, we'll call it the 'Great
Babel,' and suddenly I came upon Jack in what I thought must be
a disguise. He was dressed as the commissionaire of the hotel. I
can't say I was very surprised, for if he were in the Secret
Service the 'Great Babel' would be a most natural place for him
to be watching, frequented as it is by foreigners from all parts
of the world. I very seldom dined out, but that night had come
as the guest of an old friend. During the course of the meal I
made some discreet enquiries of our waiter as to the very
handsome commissionaire I had seen at the door when I came in,
and learnt to my astonishment that he was there under his own
name of Jack Robinson.</p>

<p>"'How long has he been here?' I asked, and I could have
dropped through the floor when I received the reply, 'Oh, I
should think it must be getting on for 15 years.'"</p>

<p>The old doctor paused impressively. "So, that was his Secret
Service, bowing visitors into the hotel, bowing them out again
and calling taxis for them! Gad, but wasn't I amazed!</p>

<p>"I didn't see him again when I went out and supposed, and
quite rightly, too, that he must have gone off duty. Still, I
wasn't going to let the matter end there and, as a friend of the
family, was intending to find out in what other way he was
making his money. I was minded to go down to where I knew he was
now living, upon the following Sunday, but he forestalled me by
calling at my professional rooms in town the very next
afternoon. He had seen me in the hotel, right enough, and came
to shut my mouth before I had had much opportunity to tell
anybody.</p>

<p>"He came into my consulting-room with a grin and frankly told
me everything. He had obtained employment at the Great Babel
within a few days of my having met him looking so shabby, that
first time in the street, to begin with as under porter, but
rising to be their head commissioner within a few months. He
said he owed his rapid promotion to being able to speak French
and German, and a smattering of Italian as well. Not even his
wife knew he was there, for he had still kept up the fiction of
the Secret Service with her, and the strange thing was that none
of the people about his home life seemed to have recognised
him.</p>

<p>"But then came his most astounding statement and it will make
some of your mouths water. His weekly wage was £3, but he
assured me, and produced his bank passbook to prove it, that his
tips during that same time often amounted to upwards of
£50."</p>

<p>"£50 from tips!" exclaimed the cynical-looking man angrily.
"Why it's the salary of a Cabinet Minister!"</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled Dr. Smith, "and most probably more than the
manager of the hotel himself earned." He was drawing near the
end of his story. "You see only wealthy people would be coming
to the Great Babel and Jack Robinson, being of such a good
appearance and looking so distinguished, none of them would care
to give him a really small tip. Besides, with his knowledge of
the continent and the best places where one could spend a lot of
money, he was most useful to many visitors, particularly so to
Americans.</p>

<p>"Well, for ten more years after he came to see me that
afternoon he remained on at the Great Babel, and during all that
time managed to keep from his wife and family what his
occupation really was. They never found him out. Just think of
it! For five and twenty years he lived that double life, giving
his children the best surroundings possible. He sent his boys to
the best public schools and then on to the university. One
qualified brilliantly as a medical man and the other got high
into the Indian Civil Service, and they never learnt what their
father was. I say 'was,' because he left the Great Babel nearly
a couple of years back.</p>

<p>"But why did he leave there if he was doing so well?" asked
the good-looking blonde. "Had he got enough money to
retire?"</p>

<p>"Partly that," replied Dr. Smith, "and partly for family
reasons. One of his daughters, who is as beautiful as her mother
was, was making an excellent marriage and, with her moving in
such good society circles, it would have been a dreadful thing
if the father's occupation had become known. Besides, his own
father is quite a wealthy man and, the only child, there was no
necessity for him to keep on where he was. So Jack Robinson
retired and, having grown a beard, no one would recognise him
now." The old man rose to his feet. "Well, goodnight all, and I
hope you liked my little story, although, as I say, it has the
merit of being strictly true," and, with a smiling bow all
round, he left the room.</p>

<p>"Interesting old chap!" remarked a man thoughtfully. He shook
his head. "But I'm sure I've seen him before. His face seems
familiar, somehow."</p>

<p>The following day some passing motorists, calling in at the
hotel for lunch, happened to meet there a man they knew. Looking
round at those gathered together for the meal, one of the
newcomers remarked: "Ah, I see you got old Sir Michael staying
here. He won't remember me, although I was introduced to him
some little time ago. I know his son pretty well."</p>

<p>His friend followed the direction he indicated. "But that's a
Dr. Smith!" he exclaimed. "He's no Sir Michael Somebody!"</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he?" laughed the other. "He's Sir Michael Barrow,
right enough. He got his baronetcy when he was made Physician to
the King. He's an eccentric old chap, and often goes about under
an assumed name. He thinks people always want to ask him a lot
of questions if they know who he really is."</p>

<p>The friend expressed his astonishment. "Is he married?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"He was, but he's been a widower now for many years. His
granddaughter was the beautiful Mary Barrow, who's portrait was
in the Academy last year. You remember she married young Lord
Thurlow."</p>

<p>A suspicion stirred in the other's mind. "Who's her father?"
he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"John Barrow, the heir to the baronetcy. He runs a model farm
near Haslemere. Used to be something in the Secret Service up to
a couple of years ago. Very decent chap!"</p>

<p>His friend gave a low whistle, but made no comment.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1941-05-01"></a>THE MIRACLE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
1 &amp; 8 May 1941</h3>

<p class="first">MARY BELL always remembered it was the day
after her twenty-sixth birthday when she first felt the pain.
She was in church and had just got up from her knees when she
felt a sharp stab in her side. It only lasted for a few seconds
and then went off. But it hurt her again, for quite a minute, as
she was walking home.</p>

<p>Then the next morning, when she was in her bath, she felt it
and, pressing hard, she could just feel a tender spot. All that
week it bothered her on and off, remaining for yet longer and
longer periods when it came on. It was worse at night and when
she was tired. She thought she must have ricked herself at some
time, but she could not remember when. She did not worry about
it, however, being sure it would pass off soon.</p>

<p>But by the end of a fortnight it was nearly always with her,
unless she was sitting still or lying down. It was not by any
means a bad pain, just an ache. She still took no notice of it,
for otherwise she felt quite well.</p>

<p>Mary Bell worked in a wheat-broker's office in Pitt street,
Sydney, and her salary was 55/- a week. She was an orphan and
had no relations, except some cousins in Adelaide with whom she
very seldom communicated. She was quite a pretty girl, but could
have made herself much more attractive than she did, had she
chosen. She had a good complexion, nice, soft brown eyes, and a
perfect set of teeth. Also, her hair was wavey. She was of
medium height and had a well-formed and beautifully proportioned
little figure.</p>

<p>But she dressed cheaply and dowdily, making no attempt to
enlist the interest of the other sex. She had had no "affairs,"
and seemed, without any, to be quite content. She was very quiet
and reserved in disposition and had, practically, no friends. In
her work at the office she was capable and trustworthy.</p>

<p>She lived in a cheap boarding house in one of the
unfashionable suburbs of Sydney and, without realising it, her
life was drab and uninteresting.</p>

<p>The ache went on, until gradually it became part of her life,
but she found that if she held her left side stiffly and in a
certain position as she walked, she hardly felt it, and so, for
nearly five months, she was quite content to let it remain like
that.</p>

<p>Then one day she happened to pick up a newspaper and read, in
an editorial commenting upon the deliberations of a recent
medical congress, that the very gravest warning had been given
about any pains or swellings in any part of the body which could
not be accounted for, and she went grey with horror.</p>

<p>She had had her ache and swelling for nearly five months,
and, oh, God, if it turned out to be&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>It was in the sitting-room of the boarding house, just after
the evening meal, when she had picked up the newspaper and,
turning her head down so that no one should see her ashen face,
she tottered up to her bedroom.</p>

<p>Then alone, and with temples throbbing and lying wide-eyed
upon the bed, she thought out what she must do.</p>

<p>She would go to a doctor at once and, even if her worst fears
were confirmed, it might not be too late for an operation. After
all, although latterly the pain had been almost a constant one,
the swelling was still very small, and she had to press hard to
feel it.</p>

<p>No, she would not go to a local doctor; she would choose a
most experienced one. She would go to one of the big consultants
in Macquarie street, no matter what she would have to pay. One
thing, she could afford it for, thank heaven, she had some money
saved.</p>

<p>Then she thought at once of Dr. Oscar Holthusen. She had
heard he was terribly expensive, but knew that for more than a
generation he had been one of the foremost consulting physicians
in Sydney. He was certainly getting old, but he was reputed to
be still wonderful and she herself knew he was a kind and gentle
man and one of whom no one need be afraid.</p>

<p>She had heard him lecture once at a big girl's club to which
at one time she had belonged, and she always remembered what he
had said to them then.</p>

<p>He had spoken on the subject that was generally supposed to
be nearest to his heart, the power of the mind over the body and
how, in sickness, its influence could be far greater than the
most marvellous potions of any fabled magician of ancient times.
Indeed, he said they were only at the beginning of their
knowledge there, and no doubt in years to come perfect miracles
of healing would be brought about by the will power of the
sufferers alone.</p>

<p>The next morning she rang up his consulting rooms and was
given an appointment for the next day at twelve o'clock. The
secretary said Mary was very fortunate for, had not a patient
just postponed her appointment, she would have had to wait at
least a week, the doctor being so full up with engagements.</p>

<p>So the following day, a few minutes after noon, Mary Bell was
being ushered into the consulting room and received with an
old-world courtesy by the doctor. His face was as kind and gentle as
she remembered it, and save for his beautiful silvered hair
brushed close upon his head, it was, she thought, not unlike
that of some medieval saint in the stained-glass window of a
church. He was small and frail-looking, but his deep-set eyes
were very bright and burned with a strong vitality.</p>

<p>He made her feel quite at her ease at once, and in a few
moments she was unburdening to him all her fears.</p>

<p>He smiled when she told him of the warning she had read in
the news papers.</p>

<p>"Not at your age, young lady," he said. "It is highly
improbable."</p>

<p>Then he was just stretching out his hand to the bell upon his
desk when, suddenly, a great change came over his countenance,
his lips parted, his calm expression altered to one of some
excitement, and he drew back his hand sharply. Then he stretched
it out again, he hesitated, and finally the hand came to rest
upon his knees.</p>

<p>A short silence followed, with the doctor staring very
thoughtfully at a big engraving of "The Martyr"' upon the
wall.</p>

<p>At last he turned again to Mary and, with his deep-set eyes
regarding her most intently, began asking her a lot of
questions.</p>

<p>He wanted to know all about her temperament and disposition;
was she self-reliant, had she good powers of self-control, was
her will strong, and could she concentrate. Then he asked a lot
about her home surroundings; what was her occupation, did she go
out much, did she make many friends and was she engaged to be
married.</p>

<p>"I like to get to know as much as possible about all my
patients," he explained smilingly, "so that in my treatment I
can deal with the mind as well as with the body."</p>

<p>He touched the bell upon his desk, with no hesitation this
time. "Now, I'll examine you. Just go behind that screen,
please, and Nurse will help you to undress."</p>

<p>His examination was very thorough and carried out in perfect
silence. His face was very grave all the time. Then with a curt
gesture he motioned to her to put on her clothes and, leaving
her to the attentions of the nurse, left the room.</p>

<p>When she was dressed again the nurse told her to resume her
seat by the desk until the doctor returned, but the latter
appeared almost before she had had time to sit down.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't give you any decided opinion, Miss Bell," he
said slowly, and Mary thought with a pang that he was avoiding
her eyes, "until you've been X-rayed. You've got something
there, but what it is I can't tell." He took one of his cards
out of a case and wrote quickly upon it. "Now, I've just spoken
on the telephone to this Dr. Neville, and you are to go over to
him at once, he's only just across the street. He'll X-ray you
straight away, and I'll get the skiagram tonight. Then you can
come and see me tomorrow at five minutes to twelve and I'll tell
you everything."</p>

<p>The following day, the moment she entered the consulting
room, Mary saw by the expression upon the doctor's face that he
had bad news to tell.</p>

<p>"I've got something?" she asked breathlessly. "There is
something there?"</p>

<p>He nodded very slowly. "Yes. I'm sorry to tell you there is,
Miss Bell."</p>

<p>"And I shall have to be operated upon?" she gasped.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No," he said, "it is inoperable. It has
reached the walls of the great arteries. You have left it too
long," and then, when Mary covered her face with her hands and
broke into convulsive sobs, he came and stood over her and laid
his hand in deepest sympathy upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Poor little woman!" he exclaimed. "I am so sorry for you,
and you'll want all your courage now. It seems awful that a
beautiful, white young body like yours should house so hideous a
thing, but there it is. Nature strikes blindly, and a queen upon
her throne and the poorest beggar-girl may both suffer in the
same way."</p>

<p>Then, with Mary controlling herself and beginning to calm
down, he told her exactly what would happen. She had about nine
months to live, but for the first five or six she would feel
very little different and the pain would not get worse. She was
to come and see him regularly once a month, and when the pain
began to get really bad he would put her in a hospital and see
she suffered as little as possible.</p>

<p>"So for five or six months," he said, "you can lead what life
you will and I'll tell you how to make the best of everything."
He spoke most earnestly. "You must get accustomed to this
horrible thing and not let its dreadful presence frighten you.
Get to grips with it at once and let it become familiar to you.
Concentrate your mind upon it. Put your hand upon your side and
say, 'I know you're there, but you're not going to terrify me.
I'll regard you just as an ordinary occurrence.'" He nodded.
"Yes, prove your courage and show how the mind can triumph over
the body."</p>

<p>Poor Mary Bell drank of a bitter cup in the ensuing days, and
it needed all her courage to let no one sense the terror in her
heart. She was a little quieter, perhaps, and even a little more
reserved, but she was always ready with her grave smile, and in
her work she was as competent and thorough as ever.</p>

<p>She did not mind the day so much, but the nights were hours
of haunting horror for her. Then her fears overcame her and it
was not until she was utterly exhausted and the grey dawn was
creeping into the room, that she would sink into a brief and
fitful slumber.</p>

<p>But one day something happened, and her mind turned a
complete somersault. She took a grip of life again and vistas of
happiness, more wonderful than she had ever known before,
suddenly opened up before her.</p>

<p>It happened in this way.</p>

<p>When she was passing along Pitt street in the dinner hour the
traffic was suddenly held up, and she stopped, with curiosity,
to regard a very unusual looking car that was close to the
kerb.</p>

<p>The car was an open single-seater one and, richly appointed
with its silver-plated bonnet, it looked to Mary the last word
in luxury. Inside were two very pretty girls and, beautifully
gowned, they were talking animatedly together.</p>

<p>With a fierce pang of anguish in her heart Mary thought how
different their lives were going to be to hers. They had
probably everything the world could offer&mdash;health, riches,
love, friendship, and happy homes&mdash;while she&mdash;she was
an untouchable, friendless, loveless, and so soon to pass away
in the white and narrow bed of a hospital ward.</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;and a clarion call rang through her! She had five
months yet when she could enjoy life! She had money saved, and
why shouldn't she then spend it all to pack in that short
remaining time such memories of happiness that they would be an
anodyne in the few but awful weeks that would follow after?</p>

<p>Oh, heaven, why hadn't she thought of it before?</p>

<p>That night in her bedroom, all feelings of depression left
her, and flushed and excited, she was considering what she would
do.</p>

<p>She would give up her daily drudgery at the office; she would
leave the dreary boarding house, she would be gowned by Madame
Lamontaine, she would go and stop at one of the best hotels, she
would have drives in motor cars, she would go to concerts and
theatres, and she would live the life of a rich and carefree
girl!</p>

<p>Ah! but she had only just £252, and that wouldn't last long!
She couldn't carry out her programme upon that! Her dresses
alone would cost at least £100!</p>

<p>Her great hopes began to droop and wither, and then another
thought came to her and she was all excitement again.</p>

<p>She must gamble with this £252! She must risk everything, and
either lose it or turn it into £1,000!</p>

<p>Risk was no stranger to her, for in her nine years in a
wheat-broker's office she had lived the whole time in an
atmosphere of gambling, or "speculation," as it was called.
Wheat was always going up and down, and the rise or fall of a
penny a bushel often meant huge sums of money to the men who
frequented the office day by day.</p>

<p>The next morning she drew out her £252 from the bank, and
that same afternoon presented herself to her employer in his
private room.</p>

<p>"I come on business today, Mr. Bentley," she said calmly to
the keen-eyed and rather poker-faced middle-aged man who was
seated at a large desk there. She laid down five £50 notes
before him. "I want you to buy wheat for me with this upon a
three-penny cover."</p>

<p>"Say it again," said her employer frowningly, and when she
had complied with his request, he asked with a scowl, "Whose
money is this?"</p>

<p>"Mine," replied Mary. "I've just drawn it from the bank."</p>

<p>"All your savings, I suppose," he grunted. He pushed the
notes away. "Well, I'll do no business for you. The market's
panicky, and I won't encourage you."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Bentley," pleaded Mary tremulously, "I have to risk
it. Something has happened in my life, something I can't tell
you, and I must have much more money or none at all. Just this
£250 will not help me, and if I lose it I shall be no worse
off." She spoke with great earnestness. "Please do as I want you
to or it will only mean I shall have to go to someone else and
may then get cheated."</p>

<p>Without a word her employer drew out a slip of paper from a
pigeonhole and commenced to write. There was silence for a few
moments and then he looked up and said. "Now let us be quite
clear. Wheat stands at 4/10 today, and I am to buy enough with
this £250 so that if limits are reduced 3d. a bushel your cover
will have run off and you will have lost all your £250. You
quite understand, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly," nodded Mary, "and if it goes up 3d. a
bushel and I ask you to sell, I shall have made £250 or
thereabouts."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" he said dryly. "If it goes up." He smiled a grim
smile. "But don't count your chickens before they're
hatched."</p>

<p>However, Mary's good fortune was in the ascendant, for after
remaining stationary for two days the market went up a penny and
the following day twopence. She sold at once, with Mr. Bentley
making no comment, but when two day's later wheat had dropped a
penny and Mary came in, this time with £400 to speculate, he
expressed himself forcibly.</p>

<p>"Don't be so foolish, Miss Bell," he snapped. "You've made
good once and be content with that."</p>

<p>But Mary was firm, and in the end he gave way. Then Mary had
a very worrying week, and all the pain in her side was forgotten
in her anxiety about the price of wheat. It dropped a penny,
recovered twopence half penny and then dropped a penny again.
Finally, three days in succession it rose a penny and Mary,
tempting fortune no longer, instructed her employer to sell.</p>

<p>"And you're a very lucky young woman," said the latter, when
later he handed her a cheque for well over £800. "To turn £250
into more than £800 in ten days is what few of us are able to do
who have been in wheat all our lives." He waved her aside. "Now
don't you come near me again."</p>

<p>Mary looked very embarrassed. "And I shan't be coming near
you at all soon," she said, "for I want to give you notice now.
I have to give up my work here."</p>

<p>Mr. Bentley looked astonished. "Give notice!" he exclaimed.
He pointed to the cheque in her hand. "You've got a nerve,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I am so sorry about it," said Mary apologetically, "but the
truth is I am to have a serious operation in about six months,
and I want to take a long holiday to get strong for it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed her employer. He nodded. "Yes, I believe you.
I've noticed you've not been looking well lately. Well, you can
go at the end of the week. Come and see me when you are strong
again."</p>

<p>A fortnight later a very elegant looking Miss Dorothy
Bell&mdash;Dorothy was Mary's other Christian name and she
thought it sounded more important than Mary&mdash;had taken up
her residence at the magnificent Semiris Hotel, and making
arrangements to stay at least three months she had been
accommodated with sitting-room, bedroom and bathroom en suite
for the trifle of £12 12/ a week.</p>

<p>She was beautifully gowned, and everything about her
suggested good taste, and ample means to indulge in it. Very
wisely she had placed herself entirely in the hands of those
best able to judge what styles would suit her, and the result
was a very sweet, charming, and even a distinguished-looking
young woman.</p>

<p>At the Semiris she was soon referred to by everyone as "The
Mysterious Lady," because no one seemed to know anything about
her. She was never seen to speak to anyone, she never had any
visitors, and no letters ever came for her.</p>

<p>She could have made friends in plenty had she wanted to, for
everyone was interested in her, and the men especially so. But
she kept herself to herself, firmly but politely discouraging
any advances.</p>

<p>She regarded herself as an untouchable.</p>

<p>She was not unhappy, however, and appreciated to the full all
her luxurious surroundings. She revelled in the peace of
everything. She loved her bright and comfortable rooms, with
their incomparable view over the glorious harbor. She enjoyed
the food and was never weary of the fine hotel orchestra. She
had her motor drives, as she had promised herself, and she went
to concerts, theatres, and pictures whenever the mood took
her.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, her side was better and not nearly so
painful, but Dr. Holthusen warned her that, unhappily, she must
build no hopes upon that, for, as the growth invaded the
surrounding tissues, it might paralyse the sensory nerves, and
they would then fail to pass on sensations.</p>

<p>She had been to the doctor upon three more occasions and he
had been kindness itself to her. He had been most interested to
learn if she had been concentrating upon her trouble as he had
advised her to, and when she had told him, rather fibbingly,
that she had, he seemed very pleased.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said encouragingly, "and then it will lose
all its terrors for you."</p>

<p>She had been X-rayed again after every visit, but each time
she had been sent to a new radiologist. The doctor had explained
he was not at all satisfied with the old ones.</p>

<p>When she had been at the Semiris just over three and a half
months, it came to her all of a sudden one morning, that the
promised period of immunity from pain was quickly passing, and
had now a bare two months to run.</p>

<p>So, acting upon an impulse, she resolved to go for a sea
voyage, and selected the one to South Africa, because she found
there was a boat of the same line returning only two days after
she would arrive at Capetown.</p>

<p>Then one glorious summer evening she found herself upon the
good ship Nestor, and watching with moist eyes the dim and
quickly receding lights of the great city.</p>

<p>"And when I see you again, you dear old Sydney," she murmured
chokingly, "I shall be among the ways of pain. I shall be near
the end then and my days will be almost done."</p>

<p>It had been her intention to be as reserved as ever upon the
boat, but she soon realised that it was quite impossible, as
everyone wanted to be so friendly. So almost at once she was
whirled into all the gaiety of shipboard life, and to her
astonishment she found she was enjoying it.</p>

<p>What did it matter, she asked herself. She would never see
any of these people again! They would pass out of her life just
as she was going to pass out of life itself. So she would take
the best the hours could give her, and it would be a bright
memory to her as she lay stretched upon the hospital bed.</p>

<p>So she played bridge, she danced, and she joined in all the
sports. She was a great favorite with everyone, and seemingly of
so natural and happy a disposition she disarmed all the jealousy
the women might have had because of the attention the men gave
her. The men were her great trouble, and with several of them
she had difficulty in preventing their flirtations developing
into serious love-making. But she managed it somehow, except in
the case of one elderly widower, and he, getting her alone on
deck one night, two days before they were due to arrive at
Capetown, made a proposal of marriage to her.</p>

<p>He was well-to-do and a very nice man, and when she
regretfully refused him was most dejected. They parted at
Capetown, but after the boat had left for England she received a
registered packet at her hotel, and, opening it, found it
contained a very beautiful diamond ring. "My poor wife's," wrote
the donor, "and no one but you shall wear it." And as he put no
address on the letter she knew she would have to keep it.</p>

<p>The return voyage to Australia followed much upon the same
lines as that from Sydney. Again she was most popular and, as
before, quickly came to have her bevy of admirers. Her side had
begun to hurt her quite a lot now, but she put it resolutely out
of her mind, and her happy, smiling face told nothing of the
dreadful fate which she knew was overshadowing her.</p>

<p>One man among the other passengers soon singled himself out
as her most attentive admirer, a young doctor who was coming out
to Australia to make it his permanent home. He told her he had
been suddenly summoned from London because an uncle of his had
been taken very ill. The doctor's name was Errol Strone, and he
was very good-looking, with a strong, firm face and calm grey
eyes.</p>

<p>He had taken a great fancy to her and was always hovering
about wherever she was. She felt instinctively that his interest
in her was becoming serious, and took good care that she should
never be with him alone.</p>

<p>One night, three days before the boat was due to arrive at
Port Adelaide, there was a fancy dress ball, and Mary went as
"The Spirit of Night." She thought in grim amusement that her
choice was most appropriate, as her own night was so soon to
fall.</p>

<p>Another girl passenger who had been a mannequin in London had
improvised the dress for her, and the general opinion was that
Dorothy Bell was absolutely beautiful that night. Her pain was
saddening her and there was a wistful, haunting look in her eyes
that made an irresistible appeal.</p>

<p>Towards midnight, tired out and unable to stand her pain any
longer, she slipped away from the ball-room and, getting hold of
her cabin stewardess, asked for a boiling hot bath. Then, lying
back, soothed and made drowsy by the heat of the water, she
suddenly realised she was about to faint.</p>

<p>She had just strength enough to call out, "Help! help!" and
then she remembered nothing more until she came to and found
herself in her own bed.</p>

<p>She was wrapped in a blanket and Dr. Strone and one of the
ship's nurses were bending over her, with a very anxious-looking
stewardess hovering in the background.</p>

<p>"That'll do now, Sister," said the doctor. "She's coming to
and must have a little brandy in some hot milk."</p>

<p>He shook his finger reprovingly at Mary. "Fie, fie, young
woman," he said smilingly, "you should never have a bath as hot
as that. It was enough to knock out a strong man, to say nothing
of a girl who had been indulging in violent exercise all the
evening."</p>

<p>He left her in a few minutes and she sank into a troubled
sleep. She dreamt that someone was offering her a cup of great
happiness, and then, just as she was about to drink from it, it
was dashed from her lips.</p>

<p>The next morning she felt quite all right again and, except
that her side was aching, no worse for her adventure in the
bath.</p>

<p>She thanked the doctor prettily, but he made light of it.
"The stewardess happened to find me first," he said, "and that's
how I came to attend you." He smiled. "In the ordinary way, you
know, it's the privilege of the ship's doctor to attend to all
the pretty girls."</p>

<p>The night before they were due to reach Port Adelaide, she
made her way alone up on to the boat deck and, leaning over the
rail in sad contemplation of the beautiful moonlit sea, was
suddenly startled by the sound of footsteps she had come to know
so well.</p>

<p>Then before she could make a movement to prevent it, she felt
an arm encircle her waist, she was drawn close to a tall figure,
her face was tilted up and Dr. Strone was kissing her
passionately upon the lips.</p>

<p>Just for one fleeting second she made an effort to wrench her
face away, but the ecstacy of his kisses sapped all her
strength, and she soon found herself in abject surrender, folded
unresistingly in his arms, and even returning his caresses.</p>

<p>For the moment she was lost to everything but his nearness to
her, and with her arms around his neck, her kisses were as long
and as fervent as his own.</p>

<p>Her madness lasted longer than a minute and then she realised
what was happening. She&mdash;the untouchable to all
men&mdash;was allowing a man to kiss her and actually kissing
him in return!</p>

<p>She suddenly thrust him away from her. "No, no," she choked,
"you ought not to have kissed me. It was wicked of me to let you
do it. You must not touch me at all."</p>

<p>"But why not?" asked Dr. Strone. "You're not married already
are you? You're not engaged?" He spoke passionately. "Then why
shouldn't I kiss you. I want you to promise to become my
wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I can't promise you," she wailed. "Please go away
now. I'll answer you some other time."</p>

<p>"Well," he smiled, quite unperturbed, "I'm leaving the boat,
as you know, tomorrow, and going overland to Sydney." He sighed.
"So, I suppose I'll have to wait until you get there. Give me
your address, anyhow."</p>

<p>So it was left at that, and the next morning she said good-bye
to him in front of all the others, giving him no chance to
speak to her alone. Then as he was going down the gangway she
whispered. "And please don't meet the boat when it arrives at
Sydney. If you do, I shall be terribly angry. You can come and
see me the next day."</p>

<p>She saw him land upon the wharf with dreadful feelings in her
heart, for she knew she would never see him again. She had given
him a false address.</p>

<p>Then for five weeks she hid herself away in a good class
guest home, to which was attached a large garden. She never went
beyond the garden, fearful that she might meet Dr. Strone. She
often wondered what he thought of her and hoped he had forgotten
her. Her side hurt her a good deal now, and she could no longer
walk far. Strangely enough, she found she was not losing
weight.</p>

<p>At last when nearly seven months had sped away since her
first visit to Dr. Holthusen, she rang up for an appointment
with him, believing that her going into a hospital could not
much longer be delayed.</p>

<p>It was a strange voice that answered her and she realised the
old doctor must have got a new secretary. Yes, she could come on
Thursday at four o'clock, she was told, and then she was asked
if she were a new patient. When she said no, there seemed to be
some hesitation at the other end of the wire and then the voice
repeated that Thursday at four would be all right.</p>

<p>So at the appointed time she arrived in Dr. Holthusen's
waiting room, and the nurse at once appeared. "It's a long time
since we've seen you, Miss Bell," said the latter smiling, and
Mary thought she seemed rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been for a sea voyage," explained Mary. "Will the
doctor be very angry, do you think?"</p>

<p>"No-o, I don't think so," replied the nurse. "You see,
he's&mdash;&mdash;" but at that moment a bell rang, and with an
apology the nurse slipped away.</p>

<p>A minute or two later, Mary was shown into the consulting
room, and she thought the door was closed very quickly behind
her. Then she saw someone, whom she knew instantly was not the
doctor, with his back towards her, and as he turned quickly at
hearing the door close, to her consternation she saw it was Dr.
Errol Strone.</p>

<p>For a moment they both stared at each other without speaking,
and then Dr. Strone exclaimed incredulously, "You! It's you!" He
picked up an index-card, off the table. "You're not this Miss
Mary Bell referred to here?"</p>

<p>Mary felt her knees sinking under her and from a deathly
pallor her face flamed to a furious red. "Yes, I'm Mary Bell,"
she faltered. "Mary's my other Christian name." Her voice
steadied. "I want to see Dr. Holthusen, please. I'm a patient of
his."</p>

<p>But Dr. Strone was still staring at her in abject amazement
and then he turned his eyes again upon the card. "Left iliac
region," he muttered, "probably sarcoma!" He drew in a deep
breath. "Sit down, will you please, Miss Bell."</p>

<p>"But I want to see Dr. Holthusen," repeated Mary
nervously.</p>

<p>"He is away, very ill," said Dr. Strone. "No, he'll never
come back, and I am taking on all his patients. I am his
nephew&mdash;by marriage." He smiled faintly. I told you I'd
been called to Australia because of my uncle being ill."</p>

<p>"But I can't let you attend me after the friends we've been,"
said Mary, warmly. "I wouldn't think of it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Dr. Strone sharply, "you're nothing but 'a
case' to me now. Sit down at once."</p>

<p>Feeling weak and tottery and unable to resist his stern
command, Mary did as she was requested, and with his face all
puckered up into a frown, Dr. Strone went on looking from her to
the card and then to her again. "You've been here five times,"
he said, looking very puzzled, "and you've had four X-rays for
trouble that began five months before my uncle first saw you!
What did he say you'd got?"</p>

<p>"A growth," whispered Mary faintly. "He gave me about nine
months to live,"&mdash;she could hardly speak&mdash;"and the
time expires in about two months. I've had trouble for more than
a year now."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Dr. Strone, and he looked the very
picture of bewilderment. Then he said very quietly, "Well, now
you just tell me everything, everything right from the very
beginning."</p>

<p>And so, choking back her tears and her voice gathering
strength as she went along, Mary told him the whole story of the
past twelve months; how she had been a typiste in an office when
the pain had come on, how she had read the medical warning about
unaccountable pain, how she had consulted his uncle and what she
had been then told, how she had gambled with all her savings to
get enough money to live the last months of her life in luxury,
and all that happened after.</p>

<p>And all the time Dr. Strone listened intently; frowning when
she told of her visits to his uncle, smiling, as he heard of her
successful gamble in wheat, and with a calm impassive face when
she mentioned her hotel life and the voyage to South Africa.
"Now just one question," he said when she had finished, and he
pointed to her right side. "Did you get that long scar there
only from having your appendix taken out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it had to be done suddenly, when I was in the country,"
she replied, "and the young doctor there said he had great
difficulty in finding it." A sudden thought struck her and she
grew scarlet. "But how do you know about that long scar?"</p>

<p>He spoke with studied carelessness. "I noticed it when I was
lifting you out of the bath that night," he said. "I happened to
be passing in the corridor when the stewardess heard your cry
for help. Then I climbed over the bathroom door and got you
out." He touched the bell upon the desk "Now we'll have a look
at those X-rays."</p>

<p>But his study of the X-rays only made him frown more heavily.
"Not a sign of anything there," he snapped. "But I'll have a
look at where the pain is."</p>

<p>So, as upon each visit before, Mary was taken behind the
screen and the nurse helped her to undress. Then Dr. Strone
proceeded to examine her, much as his uncle had done, only that
he was much quicker and did not press her side so much. He made
her lie upon her back, then turn over, and finally she had to
stand up and bend slowly down. All the time he looked as solemn
as if he were at a funeral.</p>

<p>Then he said sharply. "You've no growth at all. You've
nothing the matter with you except that one of your muscles is
badly torn and, as you've been going about with it like that for
longer than a year, it'll take some little time to heal. I'll
strap up your side with plaster now, and you'll go straight into
a private hospital, for at least a fortnight, and be kept
perfectly still."</p>

<p>"But you're sure?" gasped Mary. "You're perfectly sure?" and
when he repeated he was, she burst into a passionate flood of
tears.</p>

<p>"Put on your clothes," he said curtly, "and I'll talk to
you."</p>

<p>Mary came round the screen to find him seated at the desk and
looking very grim and stern. She sat down as he bade her and the
nurse left the room.</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then, as if with a great effort,
Dr. Strone began to speak. It seemed as if he were struggling
under the stress of some very strong emotion.</p>

<p>"You've been a very wronged woman, Miss Bell," he said
huskily, "and no words can express the grief I feel." He drew in
a deep breath. "My uncle has deliberately imposed upon you to
further his dreadful scientific ends. He wanted to find out if,
by telling you you had a growth in your side, the concentration
of your mind could ultimately produce one." He gritted his
teeth. "It was a fiendish thing to do."</p>

<p>Mary was crying softly. "Oh, it was awful of him," she
sobbed, "and he ought to be punished."</p>

<p>"He is punished," said Dr. Strone sternly. "He is in an
asylum for the insane."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then he went on. "You see, Miss
Bell, he was an old man and the study of the influence of the
mind upon the body had been the obsession of his later years.
His concentration had eaten into his sanity. He knew, as we all
know, that willpower can cure many diseases and he wanted to
prove most definitely and without a shadow of a doubt that it
can also create them, even organic ones. You came along with
your fears of a malignant growth. You tempted him and he
fell."</p>

<p>Mary was drying her eyes. "Well, I shall forget it all in
time, shan't I?" she asked. "I shall become an ordinary woman
again one day?"</p>

<p>"Of course, you will," replied the doctor stoutly. "With the
wonderful strength of character you have, in a few weeks, even,
it will be all only a memory to you." He spoke in business-like
tones. "Now this is what we are going to do. I'm ringing up a
private hospital, and when I've finished with the two patients
who are now waiting, Nurse and I will take you there in my car.
Nurse will go and get any clothes that are necessary." He
hesitated a moment and seemed rather embarrassed. "Now as to
funds." He smiled. "Have you spent all that £900?"</p>

<p>Mary blushed furiously. "Certainly not. I've still got more
than £80 and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will be ample," interrupted the doctor, "until I get you
another position." He nodded. "I've plenty of influence, and
there will be no difficulty there."</p>

<p>And then for a month it seemed to Mary that the days flew by
in a delicious but very troubled dream. At first, and when in
the hospital, she saw Dr. Strone almost every day, but never
dared to look him straight in the face, lest he should see her
feelings for him in her eyes.</p>

<p>She could not make him out. He was kindness itself to her,
but always most coldly professional, and even when she had left
the hospital and was visiting him again at his consulting room,
he never showed the slightest trace of any personal interest.
The nurse was always present and, the examinations over, he
bowed her out, she thought, as quickly as possible. The
passionate lover of the boat-deck had completely faded away.</p>

<p>Then came her last visit to him, she knew it was to be the
last because he had told her a few days previously that it would
be, and her appointment was for five o'clock, a much later hour
than was usual.</p>

<p>He examined her side carefully and pronounced her quite
cured. Then, when the nurse had left the room, and she herself
was thanking him for his great kindness and preparing to say
good-bye, he interrupted her with the nicest smile he had given
her all the time he had been attending her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've not quite done with you yet," he said. "I promised
I would get you another position, and I've found it, and am
going to take you to see if you would like it, straight-away."</p>

<p>"But Dr. Strone&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"No!" he interrupted, "I've arranged it all. Now, I shan't be
five minutes and you go and sit in my car outside until I'm
ready."</p>

<p>Hurt and dreadfully saddened that her romance was all over,
she was half inclined to refuse, but he bustled her out quickly
and she found herself seated in his car almost before she knew
what had happened. Her heart beat a little tremulously at the
thought of a drive alone with him.</p>

<p>He did not keep her waiting very long and then, with hardly a
word spoken, they drove through the city. It was not a long
drive and in about twenty minutes they were turning into a side
road that went down to one of the innumerable little bays of the
harbor.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" he exclaimed as they passed through a gate
leading into a curving avenue of overhanging trees. Through the
trees Mary could see a dainty little bungalow perched upon the
low cliffs, and just above the sea.</p>

<p>But Dr. Strone did not drive the whole length of the avenue,
and proceeding only just far enough, so that they were out of
sight of any people passing in the road, brought the car
abruptly to a standstill. The spot was a secluded one, and
Mary's knees began to tremble.</p>

<p>Then her companion suddenly slipped his arm around her, and
without a word, drew her close to him. He tilted up her chin and
looked into her eyes. A moment's waiting and he bent down and
started to kiss her passionately.</p>

<p>Mary made no pretence that his kisses were unwelcome, and for
a long minute clung to him in ecstacy. A supreme happiness was
surging through her, and Heaven was no farther than that garden
by the sea.</p>

<p>But they had to pause at last to take breath, and then he
asked mockingly: "And I suppose, sweetheart, you've been
expecting me to kiss you like this, every time you've come to
see me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I haven't," she replied instantly, and in smiling
indignation. "I never thought of such a thing." Then she gave
him a demure look and added softly: "Still, I might not have
been very angry if you had."</p>

<p>"Well, I simply didn't do it," he laughed merrily, "because
on principle I never kiss anyone during professional hours." He
regarded her tenderly. "Yes, you little darling, I made up my
mind you should become my wife that night as I was lifting you
out of that bath." He drew her to him again. "I had rescued you,
and thought you sort of belonged to me from that moment. So
we'll be married straight-away, this week or next, and"&mdash;he
pointed to the bungalow&mdash;"our honeymoon will be spent
there."</p>

<p>And then so deep and long a silence followed that a
willy-wagtail came and perched himself upon the bonnet of the
car. It would, however, have been more in accordance with the
fitness of things had the wagtail been a bird of Paradise.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1941-05-15"></a>THE JUDGE'S SECRET</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
15 May 1941.</h3>

<p class="first">IT was getting on for ten o'clock at night, and
in a closely-curtained room upon the top floor of a high
building a woman was gazing intently into a large crystal ball
reposing upon a bed of black velvet in the centre of a small
table. The only illuminant of the room was a small, red-globed
lamp, close beside which an incense pastille was burning in a
brass bowl. The woman's head was hooded in a dark shawl. A deep
silence filled the room.</p>

<p>Seated opposite to the woman, on the other side of the table,
a man was scowling sullenly. Well into middle age, he was
distinguished-looking, and, with his lofty brow, his shrewd,
stern eyes, and his resolute mouth and chin, he seemed very out
of place as a client in a fortune teller's parlor.</p>

<p>Indeed, none realised better than he himself that he was out
of place there and he was furious for having come. A judge of
the Supreme Court, a man of the highest intellectual attainments
and noted for his unsparing condemnation of all forms of
chicanery and sham, he knew it would be a public scandal if it
became known where he had been.</p>

<p>But he was excusing himself that it was in contemptuous
curiosity only he had come. He had been taking a long walk, as
he often did at night when he had something particularly
important to think about, and, overtaken by a heavy shower of
rain, had sought shelter in the entrance hall of a large block
of offices. Then, his eyes roving carelessly round to the notice
board upon which were inscribed the names of the many tenants of
the building, he had suddenly become interested with a name he
saw there.</p>

<p>"Madame Laselle!" he had exclaimed. "Now where have I heard
that name before? Ah, I remember! The fortune-teller, the woman
who bamboozled Susan last week at Mrs. Travers's!"</p>

<p>How scornful he had felt at the recollection! His wife had
returned from her friend's house with an amazing tale of the
marvellous powers of a crystal-gazer, an un-French-looking woman
with a French name and a decided Scotch accent, who had been
hired for the afternoon to tell fortunes. She had mentioned many
intimate details of his wife's family life, and, besides
detailing happenings in her past, had confidently predicted much
of what her future would be.</p>

<p>How contemptuously he had smiled as he had stood waiting for
the rain to stop! How convenient it would be if someone would
tell him about the future, and, particularly so, about that
investment a friend of his was trying to induce him to make and
about which he had to give his decision on the morrow! It would
certainly be most useful if he could learn what was going to
happen to that gold mine in Western Australia! Bah, what
credulous creatures nearly all woman were!</p>

<p>Then, the rain continuing to pour down in torrents and
chafing at his enforced inactivity, the idea had come to him
suddenly that he would go up and see what this fortune-telling
woman was like. It was almost certain she would keep evening
hours and he was curious to determine how a woman speaking
broken English with a Scotch accent could have managed to so
impose upon an audience of educated, if naturally inclined to be
credulous, women.</p>

<p>At first he had dismissed the idea with the utmost scorn, but
the rain still going on, more to occupy his time than anything,
he had thought it would be amusing to see exactly what the woman
was like, and so, finally, he had mounted the four flights of
stairs and rung upon her door. "Madame Laselle, Vocational
Adviser," he had read upon the brass plate, and, in answer to
his ring, it had been she herself, as he had guessed at once,
who had opened the door.</p>

<p>"I want to consult you," he had said, but she had only stared
hard and suspiciously at him, making no sign for him to enter
the room. So he had added drily&mdash;"I have nothing to do with
the police and I am quite alone. It is quite by chance I am
here. I was caught in this rain, and, waiting in the entrance
hall, happened to catch sight of your name upon the notice
board."</p>

<p>"Vat you know about me?" she asked with a frown.</p>

<p>"That you are a crystal-gazer," he snapped. He tried to keep
the contempt out of his tones. "That you can read the past and
the future."</p>

<p>After a few moments of further hesitation, she at last
invited him to enter and very quickly, to his idea, the
tomfoolery had begun. For a short while he was interested in the
paraphernalia of charlatancy, the darkness, the red lamp, and
the burning incense pastille, but his interest there soon waned
and, soothed by the silence and the semi-darkness, his thoughts
began harking back to the matter of the contemplated investment.
Should he put his money in it? It was a biggish sum his friend
was advising, and there was no doubt a great, great element of
risk in the venture. Now that the courts were up, too, his
friend wanted him to fly back with him for a long holiday, and
he was not over-partial to aeroplanes at any time. Yes,
everything wanted a lot of consideration and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But his thoughts were interrupted here, for the fortune-teller
at last began to speak and in a few moments, as if in a
dream and to his intense amazement, he realised she seemed to be
warning him against the very matters which had been in his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"I see," she droned slowly and in a husky monotone, "two
paths stretching away before you and mooch vill depend upon vich
vun you take. Zey are drawing close now and you must make a
choice from vich; vunce chosen, you vill not be able to draw
back. Vun leads down into ze bowels of ze earth. It go on and
on, but zen stop all at vonce." She considered for a few moments
and then shook her head slowly. "No, zat is not ze path you must
take, for zose who follow it vill have to turn back. It lead
novere."</p>

<p>Her listener's face was screwed up in a heavy frown. Of
course, she was giving him the usual patter she gave to all her
dupes, but how strangely what she was saying fitted in! The
pathway into the bowels of the earth might easily mean the
entrance into a mine, and she was telling him it would not be a
profitable one to follow. She was suggesting the gold-bearing
veins might peter out. It was certainly a remarkable
coincidence!</p>

<p>She went on, droning more slowly than ever. "I see a great
roll of sky. It ees blue and high and vide and ze sun ees
shining. Ah, but from far avay I see a storm ees coming. Black
clouds are gazering." Her voice quickened. "A ship ees plunging
and rolling as if in pain. No, it ees not a ship. It ees an
aeroplane in zose clouds and it disappear, oh, it disappear in
smoke." Her voice trailed away. "For ze moment all ees
dark."</p>

<p>The judge's frown was heavier than ever. It was incredible,
but the coincidence was there, too! Still, only just
coincidences that she had first hinted about what might perhaps
be a mine and then had specifically referred to an aeroplane.
Then, with a start he asked himself did she know who he was and
was she only fooling him? But he answered the latter of the two
questions on the instant. No, by no possibility could she be
fooling him for, even if she was aware who he was, she could not
have known anything about the mining property in Western
Australia or the suggested trip by aeroplane. Those matters were
known only to himself, his wife and his friend.</p>

<p>The fortune-teller was addressing him directly. "You,
Monsieur, you go in no aeroplane. It vill be dangerous eef you
do."</p>

<p>The judge spoke bitingly. "It is always easy to give advice,
and easier still to read the future. A child is safe in telling
you what is going to happen, as no one is in a position to
contradict him."</p>

<p>"Zat ees so," she agreed at once. She nodded darkly. "But
sometime I tell ze past as veil as ze future."</p>

<p>"Then tell me my past," he scoffed.</p>

<p>"It vill cost more money, for it take more of my nerve out of
me," and upon his shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, she
turned once again to her crystal.</p>

<p>Another long silence followed and the judge was about to tell
her he couldn't stop when her monologue started again.</p>

<p>"I see long ago," she said, "a young man who row in a boat
viz ozers. Eet is on a river and zere is many on ze banks. I do
not see vot happen, for et fade avay. Zen I see a church viz
many in eet and zis man who is older now ees standing viz a lady
at his side."</p>

<p>"When I was married, I suppose!" commented the judge drily.
"A happening in the lives of most men and not difficult to
guess!"</p>

<p>The woman took no notice of the interruption and, keeping her
eyes intently on the crystal, went on, "Zee lady ees tall and
fair. She have blue eyes and a noble face."</p>

<p>"A good shot!" murmured the judge, frowningly to himself.
"That describes Susan right enough, but then it is the
description of hundreds of thousands of other brides."</p>

<p>The woman continued&mdash;"Zen I see zis man, mooch older
still, in a room which look like vun of a 'ospital. He look very
ill and zere ees a nurse standing by ze bedside. She bend over
him and stroke his forehead. She ees young and have dark eyes,
zis nurse, and she ees of petite figure, but she ees beautiful
and have a lovely little face. The man vatch her always ven she
ees zere and his eyes follow her ven she move. She smile at him,
and he smile back at her."</p>

<p>Again a silence ensued, for there was now no interruption by
the judge. His eyes were wide and staring, his ruddy face had
paled and his forehead was pricked over in little beads of
sweat. It seemed that he could hardly get his breath. He was
hanging upon every word she uttered.</p>

<p>She went on&mdash;"I see zis man and zis girl togezer many
times. He hold her in his arms, he kiss her and&mdash;ah, ze
darkness come and zis crystal show no more." Her voice rose
sharply in excitement. "Vait, vait! Ze darkness clear and eet
show zis girl again. It ees in ze street and zere ees an upset
motor car and men are running tovards eet. Ze girl ees lying on
ze ground. She ees all crumpled up and she does not move. Her
face is very vite. Aah, but she ees dead! She vill smile and
kiss no more!"</p>

<p>A hoarse ejaculation from her client, and the woman rose
abruptly to her feet, throwing a cloth over the crystal with one
hand and switching on the electric light with the other. "I tell
you no more," she said. "Ze strain ees too great."</p>

<p>The judge spoke with an effort. "What's the charge?" he asked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Vot you like," she replied. "Vot you sink it vorth."</p>

<p>The judge threw down a pound note and rose sharply to his
feet. His only thought now was to get away as quickly as he
could. Of the strong character he was, his mind was in a panic
because of what she had told him, and he wanted now to think as
hard as he had ever had to think in his whole life.</p>

<p>With a curt nod to the woman, he let himself out of the room
and passed hurriedly down the stairs and into the street. The
rain was falling heavier than ever, but he plunged into it, so
oblivious to all discomfort that he did not even trouble to turn
up the collar of his coat. His mind was in a state of dreadful
turmoil.</p>

<p>God, by what means had the woman been able to uncover that so
closely hidden secret of his life? It was impossible she could
have learnt it in the ordinary way, for not a soul in the world
had ever been aware that he and Elsie were lovers. They had
guarded every step they took. They had made certain there should
be no discovery.</p>

<p>His thoughts raced back along the years. His marriage, five
and twenty years ago, had been one only of convenience, and
Susan had been but a stepping stone in his professional career.
Her people had money and influence. Then when not far off 50, it
was barely five years back, Elsie had come into his life. He had
been taken ill with pneumonia and she had been his special
nurse. He had fallen madly in love with her and she had returned
his affection. After he had got well and left the hospital they
had continued to meet in great secrecy until that terrible day
when she had been killed in a motor accident. The crystal-gazer
had described her exactly, dark-eyed, petite and with a lovely
little face.</p>

<p>He could hardly think coherently. What did it mean? How had
the woman been able to see everything in her glass? Was it then
possible that after all there was truth in what he, in common
with all educated men, had held to be a shameless fraud? Were
there powers that the world regarded with scorn and contempt,
simply because they did not understand them?</p>

<p>Arriving home, he found his wife had gone to bed and,
proceeding into his study, he unlocked his desk and from beneath
some papers in one of the bottom drawers abstracted a small
photograph. It was that of the dead girl in her nurse's uniform
and upon the back of it was written in an unformed school girl
handwriting. "To one to whom I give all my love.&mdash;From
Elsie Bowen."</p>

<p>A scalding tear furrowed down his cheek.</p>

<p>It was a long time that night before he closed his eyes, but
before sleep came at last he had made up his mind to make an
intense study of Occult Science and determine for himself if
there were any truth in it.</p>

<p>In the morning he informed his friend that he would not be
investing in the mine and that, therefore, his projected flight
to Western Australia would not take place. Then, his disbelief
that the future could be foretold having been so profoundly
shaken by the disclosures the crystal-gazer had been able to
make about his past, he was not at all surprised when the
aeroplane in which he was to have travelled crashed, with all
its occupants being killed. As he was now expecting, too, the
following week the report of the expert upon the mining
proposition was unfavorable and the shares slumped badly.</p>

<p>A few days later he paid another visit to Madame Laselle's
rooms, but found she had left the building, with no one knowing
to where she had gone. To his indignation, he learnt she had had
to go because of the threatening of the police.</p>

<p>Then commenced an entirely new life for the judge, with him
becoming an entirely changed man. Convinced now that there were
forces in the world of which hitherto he had not dreamed, he
became an ardent student of Occult Science and devoted all his
leisure to acquiring knowledge of what are known as "The Secret
Teachings of the East." Much to his family's disgust, he gave up
all social functions, apart from his duties in the courts,
becoming almost a recluse.</p>

<p>This state of things went on for several years, and then he
received a dreadful shock, one destined to be as far-reaching in
its consequences for him as that he had received when he had
paid his visit to the crystal-gazer upon that stormy night.</p>

<p>One evening after dinner, just as he was upon the point of
retiring as usual to his study, his wife remarked casually, "Oh,
Horace, you remember my coming home from Mrs. Traver's, one
afternoon some years ago, full of the astonishing things a
crystal-gazer, that Madame Laselle, had told me?"</p>

<p>The judge's heart stirred at the mention of the name. "Yes, I
remember," he replied. "She told you several things which had
happened to you."</p>

<p>His wife nodded significantly. "And I don't wonder she was
able to." She laughed merrily. "Why, she was Robert's sister and
so, of course, would have known all about me."</p>

<p>"I don't understand,'' frowned the judge. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, this morning cook pointed out to me a piece in the
newspaper which said that this Madame Laselle had been arrested
in Adelaide, and she told me she had learnt some time ago that
the woman's real name was Flora McCullum and, as I say, that she
was Robert's sister. Now didn't I tell you at the time that she
spoke her broken French with a Scotch accent?"</p>

<p>"But which Robert's sister?" asked the judge sharply, an icy
shiver beginning to run down his spine.</p>

<p>His wife was amused. "Robert, the butler we had at the time,
Robert McCullum, the man we used to think was always listening
at the doors. Don't you remember you sent him away in the end
because you caught him opening your desk when, one day, you had
left your keys about?"</p>

<p>She went on talking, but her husband was no longer listening.
He felt sick and stunned in mortification, for his mind had
suddenly been illuminated with a great light.</p>

<p>He swallowed hard. So he had been taken in as easily as the
most credulous of those he had been wont to so despise. Without
the slightest doubt the crystal-gazer had recognised him as her
brother's employer and, from what the latter had told her of him
and his household she had built up all she had been pretending
to see in the crystal.</p>

<p>She had made out she had seen him as a young man in a boat
race because her brother had, of course, mentioned the pair of
sculls hanging upon the study wall. She had told him of the
tall, fair girl of noble features who had been his bride,
because her brother had described to her the big photograph of
the wedding group in the drawing room and, lastly, when
searching through his, the judge's, desk, the man had come upon
the photo, with the affectionate inscription on the back, and
surmising a hidden attachment, had passed on the information
there, again. It was public knowledge that he, the judge, had
been an inmate of a private hospital for many weeks.</p>

<p>Then, about the goldmine and the projected flight to Western
Australia, her brother had, of course, overheard all about them,
and it had been just a guess that the plane would run into a
thunderstorm&mdash;planes often did&mdash;and that the goldmine
venture would turn out to be an unprofitable one&mdash;how often
did they not?</p>

<p>He went hot and cold in turns, feeling in the lowest depths
of humiliation. From the tittle-tattle of a domestic servant
passed on to a common, uneducated woman who lived by her
habitual cheating and deceit, he, who's lifework it was to weigh
evidence, had been led, like the veriest simpleton, to envision
a mighty world of occult mysteries to be explored.</p>

<p>He burst suddenly into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at Horace?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"At the thought of how easily people are taken in, my dear,"
he replied, and then he astonished her by adding, "But come,
now, I'm giving up all my studies for a while, so let's go to
the pictures tonight."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="DOP-1941-10-30"></a>THE ADVENTURESS</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
30 October 1941.</h3>

<p class="first">THE baby had been hushed to sleep, and, with
one last lingering look of adoration, the young mother moved
very softly over to her desk and sat down to write. She was very
pretty, so young, it seemed, to have maternal cares, but as she
looked round at the luxuriously appointed room she gave a sigh
of deep contentment. Fortune, she knew, had indeed been kind to
her! She had everything she could want!</p>

<p>She picked up her pen and continued her interrupted letter.
"No, Nancy dear," she wrote, "I never forget I have a cousin in
far-off England, although I have not seen her for fifteen years.
You left Australia just after mother died, and I was only seven
then.</p>

<p>"Yesterday was the first anniversary of our wedding, and I am
so happy. Of course everyone said I had made a great catch, but
it was a real love-match, and I would have married John if he
hadn't had a penny. You will have heard I was working in a café
before I was married to him, but that makes no difference to
what he thinks of me, and we are devoted to each other.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a real romance, and I'll tell you all about it
from the very beginning when it started, less than eighteen
months ago. When poor father died at the beginning of last year
we two girls were left almost penniless, and we came up to the
city at once to find some way of earning our own living. Hilda
got a situation with a kindly old lawyer, but I had no luck at
all. Trade happened to be very bad at the time, and the shops
wouldn't engage an inexperienced hand when plenty of experienced
ones were available. In the offices it was the same. Being
nearly twenty-one, I was too old to start as a learner, and the
registry offices could supply properly trained clerks to anyone
who wanted them.</p>

<p>"One morning, when almost in desperation because funds were
getting so low, I saw an advertisement in one of the newspapers
for a waitress in a café, and I went after the situation at
once. I hated the idea of being a waitress, but what could I
do?</p>

<p>"Arriving at the café I found there were a lot of girls
waiting to be interviewed, and thought dismally I should have
very little chance. However, directly my turn came and I was
taken into the proprietress, a Mrs. Lewis, I felt much more
hopeful. She had a very kind face, and was undoubtedly a lady.
She eyed me critically, and at once started to ask me all sorts
of questions about myself, very quickly and without wasting a
moment of time. Finally, she said smilingly, 'Well, although
you've had no experience, I'll give you a trial. You're pretty,
and that counts a lot. Besides, the work can easily be picked up
by anyone of ordinary intelligence.' 'But what are the wages?' I
asked timidly. 'One pound a week,' she replied, and then, seeing
my face fall, as well it might, considering I was paying 22/6 at
the boarding house, she added quickly, 'But then, you ought to
make as much again or that in tips. My customers are all of a
good class, professional men and heads of business houses, and
they are most of them quite generous. The charges here are high
to keep the place select.' She spoke warningly. 'But you take
care of yourself and keep everybody at a distance. There are
always plenty of pitfalls in a city for pretty girls.'</p>

<p>"There were four other waitresses, and they soon put me in
the way of things. I felt very nervous at first, but in a few
days flattered myself I was as quick and competent as anyone.
Most of our customers were elderly, but there was a fair
sprinkling of younger men. They all seemed well-to-do and, to my
great delight, the first week I made over 35/ in tips. It wasn't
a nice feeling, taking the sixpences and threepences at first,
but I soon got over it and regarded it as quite the natural
thing. A number of those I served, both young and elderly, were
often inclined to be friendly, but I treated them all the same
and never encouraged any conversation when it began to get
personal.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lewis had the eyes of a hawk, and always seemed to know
what was going on. 'That's right, my dear,' she said to me one
day, 'never make yourself too cheap and they'll think the more
of you.'</p>

<p>"I had been there about a month when one morning John came
in, and I thought at once that I had met my fate. He looked so
handsome and carried himself so boldly and confidently that I
was interested in him at once. His eyes roved round the room and
then, to my great delight, he came and sat down at one of my
tables. 'Hullo,' he exclaimed smilingly, 'and so you're the new
star they've got here. I've heard about you and that they call
you the duchess.'</p>

<p>"But I only just smiled back and, having brought what he had
ordered, moved away. Then I was thrilled to notice that several
times he was looking in my direction. When he left he gave me a
smiling nod, and I found he had put sixpence under the plate for
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy, that sixpence made me feel so miserable! It woke
me with a horrible thunderclap from my beautiful day dream of
meeting my Prince Charming while working in that café, for then,
for the first time, I realised the great gulf which must always
stretch between me and those to whom I was carrying what they
had ordered to eat and drink. What a little fool I had been all
along, for how could I have ever thought that any man would want
to pick for his wife a girl who had been taking threepences and
sixpences from everyone who offered them!</p>

<p>"I felt miserably unhappy for the rest of that day, but that
night, when I was undressing, all my pride and courage suddenly
came back and I felt quite hopeful once again. At any rate, I
told myself I would be no easy conquest for anyone and, if I
fell in love with this boy and he with me, it would be through
the marriage vows alone that I would go to him.</p>

<p>"The next morning John appeared in the café again and my
foolish heart started to go pit-a-pat immediately. As I had been
sure he would, he came straight to my tables, and smiled as
charmingly at me as he had done the day before. But I had got
myself well in hand and waited upon him demurely, giving him no
idea of how interested I was in him. By then I had learnt from
the other girls that he was John McCairne, the only son of old
Hugh McCairne, who was very wealthy and owned one of the largest
sheep stations in Australia.</p>

<p>"Then John took to coming regularly to the Rialto whenever,
as he explained, he was down in the city. 'Mind your steps,
young woman,' nodded Mrs. Lewis, who was taking in everything.
'That man likes pretty girls, but he's only a flirt. Lots of
society mothers have tried to get him for their daughters, but
they've all failed. Besides, he's not likely to mean anything
serious with you, even if he were a marrying man.' I only
smiled, but when one day he asked me to come out for the
evening, with the plan I had mapped out, I shook my head. 'But
why not?' he asked with a frown. 'You say you've got no boy
friend, so where'll be the harm?' "</p>

<p>"'I don't know you well enough,' I laughed. 'I'm not a prude,
but I don't go out with everyone.'</p>

<p>"He looked annoyed and then didn't come near the Rialto for a
whole week, although I had heard he was in the city. Then, when
he did resume his visits, he renewed his invitation every time.
At last I agreed, and it was arranged he should take me to the
pictures.</p>

<p>"It was a thrilling moment for me when I met him outside the
Theatre Royal, for it was the first time he had seen me when not
in my waitress's uniform. But, hoping for such an occasion, I
had been preparing for it for a long time, and, indeed, had
spent down to my last pound to have every thing ready.</p>

<p>"Never mind what I wore, but it was all good, and Hilda, who
saw me off, was positive I looked as well-dressed as any girl in
the city could want to be. John told me afterwards that he drew
in a deep breath when he caught sight of me, but all he said
then was, 'My word, but you do look nice! Why, you're a real
little beauty!'</p>

<p>"He was very nice and polite all the evening, and not a bit
forward, and I enjoyed everything immensely. He drove me home in
his car, which I did not altogether like, because our
boarding-house looked so shabby. When we said good-bye we just
shook hands, but he squeezed mine ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Then commenced a most happy time for me. Whenever he was
down in the city he used to take me out twice and even three
times during the week. He had kissed me now, and I had kissed
him back, but I took care the kisses should be always short ones
and allowed no lingering over them.</p>

<p>"One night, when we were together in his car upon one of the
beaches he kissed me, and then suddenly put his arm round my
waist and made to pull me tightly to him. But I disengaged
myself instantly, and said very sharply, 'No, John, I won't have
it, and if you try that again I won't come out with you any
more.'</p>

<p>"'Why not?' he asked in an equally as sharp a tone as I had
used, and I could see that he was inclined to be really
angry.</p>

<p>"'Because I don't think people should embrace unless things
are serious between them,' I replied warmly.</p>

<p>"'Ho, ho, then you are not serious with me!' he exclaimed,
and there was just a trace of sarcasm in his tones.</p>

<p>"I shook my head. 'Not yet,' I laughed teasingly. 'I'm trying
you out, and I'm not quite certain about you.' I nodded. 'There
are several things about you which don't please me. For one
thing, you have too many whiskies and sodas for a man of your
age. They are not good for you.'</p>

<p>"He reddened furiously, and stared in astonishment. Then a
long silence followed, and it was quite five minutes before
either of us spoke again. Then he said smilingly, 'Well, you're
either a very wise young woman or else a very cold one. I can't
quite make out which.'</p>

<p>"'I'm neither,' I smiled back. I became serious. 'I'm just a
girl who intends to go to her real lover as God made her, and
not with any secrets she'll be always having to hide.'</p>

<p>"'Hum,' he remarked thoughtfully, 'you're dangerous, and I
see I shall have to be very careful.' But for all that, his
goodnight kiss would have been warmer if I had let it be.</p>

<p>"Then things began to move quickly towards a climax. One
afternoon about 3 o'clock and during the slack time when there
were few people in the café, a tall, erect man midway between
sixty and seventy, I thought, came in and, after a good look
round, walked over and sat down at a table near where I was
standing. His distinguished, handsome face seemed somehow
familiar to me. He regarded me curiously as he asked curtly for
coffee and toast and, when I had served him and was attending to
other customers, I saw his eyes were following me round.
Presently, when at his request I made out his docket, he handed
me a one pound note, and then when I returned him his 19
shillings in change, he pushed a two-shilling piece towards me
over the table. 'Too much,' I smiled, laying down a shilling and
sixpence.</p>

<p>"'Oh, that's it, is it?' he said with his face puckered up
into a frown. He spoke scornfully, 'To kind of let me know, I
suppose, that the two shillings wouldn't get me any forwarder,
and that you preferred younger men.' Then, before I could take
in what he meant, he went on very sharply, 'Here, young woman,
my name's Hugh McCairne, and I want to know what you think is
going to be the end of your going about with my boy.'</p>

<p>"My breath caught in my throat. Now, I realised why his face
had seemed familiar. Of course, he was John's father! I could
feel myself getting hot all over.</p>

<p>"He went on quickly, raising his voice, 'Yes, you may well
blush, but it's about time you thought where things were leading
you. With any sense, you must see&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Hush, hush,' I exclaimed sharply, because some of the other
customers were beginning to look round in our direction, 'this
is not the place to discuss it!' I spoke with some indignation,
'Please, remember I have my living to get here, and you are
attracting attention. If you want to speak to me it can be done
somewhere else.'</p>

<p>"He calmed down at once. 'Well, will you meet me tonight at
my hotel, the Semiris, at 7 o'clock?' he asked curtly. I
hesitated, but I had got all my wits about me now, and was
perfectly cool and collected. 'And I suppose that means you are
asking me to dinner,' I said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He raised his eyebrows as if rather surprised and smiled
coldly. 'All right,' he nodded. 'I'll give you something to eat.
Then it's to be 7 o'clock and don't you be late, as I hate
unpunctuality.'</p>

<p>"Now Nancy, my dear old father-in-law will have it that
everything I did that night was done of deliberate purpose to
entrap him. But if he is right, I only wanted to make him
realise that, if ever John did ask me, I was quite nice enough
to be his wife. The Semiris, of course, you remember, is about
the most fashionable hotel in town, and I learnt afterwards that
Mr. McCairne had never intended for one moment to take me to
dinner there. Instead, he had meant to go to some quiet little
place where it was not likely he would be recognised in my
company. So when I arrived at the Semiris, he was waiting
outside, all ready to whisk me away quickly before anybody had
noticed our meeting.</p>

<p>"But when he saw me very nicely dressed and quite
presentable&mdash;he didn't recognise me at first&mdash;after a
moment's hesitation he changed his mind and with a grim and
purposeful face took me into the big dining hall of the
hotel.</p>

<p>"He did not seem too pleased, however, when we were given a
table in the very centre of the room, but the place was crowded
and that happened to be the only table available. When we were
seated, he looked round frowningly and nodded to some men he
knew, but in a few moments he turned back to me and his face
broke into a rather reluctant smile. 'Gad, you're good-looking
all right, Miss Trevor!' he exclaimed. 'I'll admit that. You're
by far the prettiest girl here, and are making quite a lot of
interest.' He chuckled, 'There are two friends of mine close
near, all eyes and ears for what's going on, and won't they just
have a tale to tell about me!' He made a grimace. 'I hope to
goodness I get home before they do, to explain everything to my
wife.'</p>

<p>"Then, all suddenly, his manner became most friendly. 'Now
will you have a cocktail?' he asked. 'Oh, you won't! You want to
keep your complexion, do you? Well, it's certainly worth
keeping! But what would you like to drink? What, claret! Why, I
quite thought you'd choose champagne!' He frowned. 'Has my son
ever given you champagne?'</p>

<p>"'He's offered it, but I've refused,' I smiled. I had
determined upon my line of action and spoke boldly. 'That's one
thing I've talked to John about,' I went on. 'He has far too
many nice things to drink. Never, of course, more than he can
take easily, but more than are good for a boy of his age.'</p>

<p>"Mr. McCairne fairly gasped. 'But you've got a nerve, haven't
you,' he exclaimed, 'talking as if you had some proprietary
interest in my son?' He glared at me. 'What are your intentions,
young woman?' He could hardly get his breath. 'Do you think he's
going to marry you?'</p>

<p>"I interested myself in my fish for quite a minute before
replying. Then I said rather hesitatingly, 'I don't quite know,
Mr. McCairne. We've neither of us made up our minds yet.' I
laughed. 'I'm not quite certain I should accept him, even if he
proposed.'</p>

<p>"Mr. McCairne gulped down his astonishment and pretended to
be very amused. 'And you a waitress in a café,' he exclaimed,
'in part depending upon your livelihood upon tips!'</p>

<p>"'That's nothing,' I said coolly. 'You were only a station
hand once, probably earning far less than I am. Why are you
proud of telling people how you have worked your way up!'</p>

<p>"He bowed ironically. 'A hit, Miss Trevor, a good hit!' he
exclaimed. He nodded frowningly. 'Yes, you're a clever young
woman, and I see my boy will have to look out!'</p>

<p>"'But why should he have to look out?' I asked warmly. 'Why
should it be wrong if he wanted me to be his wife? You say I'm
quite presentable! Well, I'm educated and I come of good stock.
My father was a doctor.' I spoke with some sharpness. 'What do
you find wrong about me?' He made no answer, and, the waiter
coming to change our plates, quite a long silence ensued.
'Well,' I asked at last, 'can't you think of anything
wrong?'</p>

<p>"I saw I had driven him into a corner, and he smiled and
shook his head. 'Not for the moment,' he replied. He sighed.
'But come, let's talk about something else.'</p>

<p>"So we started upon quite an interesting conversation,
chiefly about ourselves. He told me about his early struggles
and how he had gradually made his way, and I told him of my life
as a doctor's daughter in a small bush town and, humorously, of
my adventures when looking for a situation in the city. The
conversation was continued after dinner in the lounge, and ten
o'clock came before either of us had realised how quickly the
time had flown. Then I said I must be going home. Mr. McCairne
made a grimace.</p>

<p>"'Look here, my dear,' he said, 'you've hypnotised me, and I
really don't know what to say about you and John.' He smiled
with mock resignation. 'I think you'd better come and spend a
weekend with us at Riverdale. Then we'll see what John's mother
thinks about you. Now, would you like to come?'</p>

<p>"My legs went all wobbly, but I pulled myself together and
said I'd like to, very much. 'But I think you might very nicely
ask my sister as well,' I went on. 'Then it won't look so
obvious that I am being brought down for inspection.'</p>

<p>"'A good idea!' he exclaimed. The grim look returned to his
face. 'And then we'll be able to see what the other member of
the family is like. Riverdale is only just over a hundred miles
from the city, and John can bring you both down.'</p>

<p>"'But one thing, please, Mr. McCairne,' I said. 'I'd like you
to invite me openly in front of John. He'll be up in the city
tomorrow, won't he? Well, he'll most likely come to the Rialto
about eleven. So you appear a few minutes after.</p>

<p>"'You little schemer!' he exclaimed with mock severity.
'You'll be trying to run the whole family soon.' He nodded,
'Still, I'll do as you suggest.' Then he added as an
afterthought, 'but I don't think we'd better say anything to
John, at any rate, for the present, about our having met here
tonight. I'll tell him myself later on.'</p>

<p>"The next morning John came into the Rialto rather later than
I expected, and we had had only just time to say a few words
when Mr. McCairne appeared and came straight up to us.</p>

<p>"'Ha, ha, my boy,' he exclaimed, shaking a finger
reprovingly. 'I've found out at last what has been bringing you
down so often to the city! No, no, you needn't introduce us. I
came in yesterday and had a little chat with this young
lady.'</p>

<p>"John's face was a study, and for the moment he seemed
downright annoyed, but then his easy smile came back, and,
thinking I must be brightened,?? he nodded reassuringly to me.
'It's all right, Helen,' he said, 'my father's a dear old
fellow, and you needn't be in the least bit afraid of him.'</p>

<p>"'Afraid of me!' laughed the old man, as if it were a good
joke. 'Why, the boot's on the other foot. I'm the one to be
afraid of a girl with eyes like hers.'</p>

<p>"I left them together and did not return to their table until
they were getting up to leave. Then, in saying good-bye, Mr.
McCairne gave me the invitation for the following Friday.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy, that weekend was such a triumph for me! John's
mother took to me at once, and treated me as if I were a most
honored guest. She was a sweet old lady and not a bit stuck-up.
John was very quiet and didn't say much, but I could see he was
proud of me, and very pleased with the way things were going.
Strangely enough, although we were left a lot together that
weekend our love-making was very restrained, on my part because
I had no intention of letting John think I took anything for
granted, and upon his, because, as he told me afterwards, he
never liked things to be arranged for him, and he thought his
parents were doing it then.</p>

<p>"On the Sunday night, just before we got ready to go back to
the city, Mr. McCairne drew me to one side. 'Look here, little
woman,' he said, 'both the wife and I are very happy about
everything, and would like to see you and John come to an
understanding. But you must first get to thoroughly know your
own minds, and so what I suggest is this. Hand in your notice to
the Rialto at once, and then come here as my secretary and
companion to my wife. I'll give you £100 a year, and if you and
my boy don't finally hit it off'&mdash; he shook his finger at
me&mdash;'then, you little adventuress, I'll look out for a
husband for you somewhere else. Yes, you can kiss me if you
like, but I'm sure it won't be one like those you give John.'
You can imagine how thrilled I was.</p>

<p>"I went to them a fortnight afterwards, and things could not
have been happier for me. John was most attentive and made very
few trips to the city, and then only when he was absolutely
obliged to go. I was more in love with him than ever, and we
seemed to be drifting into a matter-of-course engagement.</p>

<p>"But suddenly a dreadful thing happened, and if I hadn't
acted as the bold little adventuress they all laughingly
pretended me to be. I might have lost John altogether.</p>

<p>"All at once John became cold towards me. He didn't want to
kiss me any more, and, as much as possible, avoided being alone
with me. He took to stopping up in the city, too, for two and
even three days at a time, and altogether it was quite plain to
everybody that he was intending to drop me.</p>

<p>"His father and mother were most upset, but they said nothing
to me, and, of course, I was much too proud to refer to it. I
felt terribly hurt, but tried not to let anyone see it, and,
outwardly, was just as smiling and bright as before.</p>

<p>"Then one night at dinner John suddenly announced he was
going for a trip to Colombo and sailing the following week. He
explained he wanted a change, and was sure the voyage would do
him good.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. McCairne looked dumbfounded and didn't say a
word, but I made myself appear to be most interested and asked
him all sorts of questions about the voyage and what the boat he
was going in was like. I was as happy about it as if I were
going myself. After dinner, however, when without a word he left
the room, I followed him. 'Here, John,' I said firmly, 'I want
to speak to you. Come out into the garden.'</p>

<p>He frowned and hesitated, but my manner was insistent and he
came after me. I led him into the summer house just across the
lawn. My heart was beating like a sledge hammer, but I held
myself well in hand.</p>

<p>"'Sit down,' I said, and seating myself down, too, but well
away from him, I went on sharply, 'Now, I want an explanation,
please, and it's not only myself I'm thinking of but of your
father and mother as well. You must see how you're upsetting
them.' I spoke disdainfully. 'What does it all mean?'</p>

<p>"'What does what all mean?' he echoed, making out he was
surprised at my question.</p>

<p>"'Oh, don't pretend you don't know,' I retorted angrily.
'Something's turned you against me and it's a week since you've
offered to kiss me. You avoid me, too, as if I were something
hateful. What's happened?'</p>

<p>"He regarded me very coldly. 'I don't like girls,' he said
slowly, and holding my eyes with his, 'who make out they're so
straight and proper and then, when it suits them, carry on in a
way which suggests the exact opposite.'</p>

<p>"'Meaning me?' I asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"'Who else?' he scoffed. Then he rapped out fiercely, 'Who
was that old man you were seen sitting with in the lounge of the
Semiris Hotel, one night, late, a little while before you came
up here?'</p>

<p>"I gasped and, so overwhelming was my relief, I could not
speak. Instead, I threw back my head and burst into nervous but
rippling laughter. 'Oh, you foolish boy,' I cried, 'and so it's
that which has been making you behave all this time like a sulky
child?' I was trembling all over and could not keep my voice
from shaking. 'Why, hasn't your dad ever told you? It was he who
took me to the Semiris that night and&mdash;&mdash;' but I broke
down and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"John had his arms round me in two seconds. 'No, no, you
shall never kiss me again,' I cried furiously. 'You've doubted
me and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"But with his face pressed so close to mine I could not get
out another word. I just closed my eyes and the next few minutes
were among the very happiest in all my life.</p>

<p>"And you just understand, you little witch, that I'll be
kissing you now for keeps,' he said masterfully, when at last he
let me free to smooth down my dishevelled hair. He pulled me to
him again and his voice dropped tenderly. 'Oh, I'm so ashamed of
myself. I'll never doubt you again.'</p>

<p>"Presently we went back into the house and his father's face
broke into a delighted smile as he saw us walking so close
together, with John holding tightly to my hand.</p>

<p>"'But what's happened?' gasped his mother, with her eyes
opened very wide.</p>

<p>"'Oh, nothing much,' laughed John. He bent down and kissed me
shamelessly in front of them. 'Only that this young woman here
has just asked me to be her husband and, to save argument, I've
consented.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, you story-teller!' I protested vehemently. 'I did
nothing of the kind,' but both his parents pretended not to
believe me.</p>

<p>"Six weeks later we were married, and I know I had the very
loveliest honeymoon any girl could have ever had. But I must
finish now, for I hear John's car in the drive and want to seal
this letter up, so that he cannot suggest he should read what
I've been writing about. He'd only laugh and say it was at last
the frank confession of his little adventuress. So, with heaps
of love until I write again,</p>

<p>Your affectionate cousin,</p>

<p>"Helen McCairne."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1942-01-29"></a>DEATH IN THE CONSULTING ROOM</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide, 29 January
1942.</h3>

<p class="first">ONE evening Dr. Wilkie was staying late at his
consulting rooms on North terrace, in Adelaide, the beautiful
city of the plains. It was getting on for half-past 6, and his
nurse had been gone some time. The big building of Kensington
House was by then almost emptied of its usual tenants.</p>

<p>The doctor was a good-looking young fellow of eight and
twenty, but just now his face was puckered into a worried and
uneasy frown. It was the end of the month, and he was making up
his accounts. Unhappily, there were not many to go out, and,
more unhappily still, he knew there would be a good many coming
in.</p>

<p>Things had not been been going too well with him lately, and
he was thankful he was a bachelor, with no one depending upon
him. He was quite aware he was under a cloud. Some six months
previously a great misfortune had overtaken him, and done his
practice a lot of harm. When single-handed, he had lost a
patient under an anaesthetic, and, although his professional
brethren were unanimous, it had not been his fault, and would
have happened with anyone, people generally blamed him, because
there had not been another medical man present when he had been
attending to the patient.</p>

<p>He had been called in suddenly to a little girl who had
dislocated her shoulder. It was quite a simple dislocation, and
he knew it would take only a few seconds to replace, but, to
save the child any pain he had given her a whiff of chloroform.
Then, to his horror, she had all at once stopped breathing, and,
though he had tried everything, he had not been able to bring
her to.</p>

<p>It had been a ghastly business, with the father and mother
standing by, and the most terrible moment of all his life. He
would never forget it, however long he lived.</p>

<p>The post-mortem had shown most conclusively that the child's
death had been due to status lymphaticus, a rather rare diseased
condition in which the lymphatic tissues have become greatly
overgrown. By no possibility could the death have been foreseen
and prevented, and in any case, it was not likely the child
would have lived long. Although apparently in the best of
health, she was yet living in a dangerous state, and even a
slight shock might have had fatal consequences.</p>

<p>The whole matter had been most unfortunate for him,
particularly so as the parents were wealthy and influential
society people. It would be a long time before things were
forgotten.</p>

<p>He was working on at his accounts when suddenly the bell up
on the waiting-room door pinged loudly. "Confound it!" he
exclaimed. "Now who on earth can it be at this time? I can't
make out I'm not here, as, of course, he's seen the light."</p>

<p>Opening the door, he was confronted with an elderly-looking
man in a long overcoat and a thick scarf round his neck.</p>

<p>"The doctor!" exclaimed the man. "Well, my name is Harris,
but you don't know me, and I'm sorry I've come so late. I've
only just made up my mind to see someone, and I've been ringing
all the doctors' doors in the building. I'd given it up as
hopeless until I saw your light. Now, I shall be so much obliged
if you'd give me a few minutes. I shan't keep you long."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie frowned. It was annoying to be disturbed when he
was so busy, but, then, his circumstances were certainly not
flourishing enough to warrant his turning away any patient at
whatever time they happened to arrive.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said. "It's a bit late," he smiled, "but then
we doctors are supposed to be ready any time. Sit down and tell
me what's the matter."</p>

<p>"It's my neck," said the man. "I've got a nasty boil there
and I think it ought to be lanced."</p>

<p>The doctor made a quick examination. "Yes, it should be done
at once," he nodded.</p>

<p>"But I shall want something to send me to sleep," said the
man. "I'm a great baby where pain is concerned."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll give you a whiff," said the doctor. "Now when
did you last have anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"This morning, about seven o'clock, and then it was only a
cup of coffee and a bit of bread and butter. I haven't felt
inclined to eat anything with this boil."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the doctor. "I'll lance it straight
away. It's a small matter, and you need not go into any hospital
to have it done. I'll do it at your home. Now who would you like
to give you the anaesthetic, and where do you live?"</p>

<p>The man laughed. "I don't live anywhere, and I don't know
anybody, let alone any doctor. I'm only just passing through
Adelaide on a boat, the <i>Nerbudda</i>. We arrived this morning
from Melbourne, and we're leaving tomorrow at five a.m. I'm
going to England."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie frowned. "But where do you come from? Where do
your relations live?"</p>

<p>"I've come from Townsville just now," replied the man, "but
I've no relations there. In fact, I don't know whether I've got
any relations at all. I rather think not, but if I have they're
in Norwich, in England, from where I came a good many years
ago." He spoke persuasively, "Look here, doctor, couldn't you do
the whole business on the spot, here now, and then I'd go
straight back to the boat in a taxi. The skipper would look
after me once I got on board."</p>

<p>"But hasn't the boat got a proper medical man?" asked Dr.
Wilkie.</p>

<p>The patient shook his head. "No, we're only a small cargo
boat, and when we're sick the skipper's our only standby," he
replied. He began taking off his collar. "Come on, doctor, let's
get it over."</p>

<p>The doctor still hesitated. "How are you in general health?"
he asked. "Ever had any trouble with your heart?"</p>

<p>"Never!" said the patient emphatically, and Dr. Wilkie
remembered afterwards how quickly he had spoken. "I've been as
fit as a fiddle all my life, and now I'm only fifty-one."</p>

<p>The doctor examined him and found nothing wrong. "Well, I'll
want that belt off," he said. "You won't be able to breathe
properly with it on," and he turned round and busied himself
with getting everything ready. The patient, with a movement
which to an observer might, perhaps, have seemed unnecessarily
quick, snapped off the belt referred to and thrust it furtively
under his coat and waistcoat, which he had already placed upon a
chair.</p>

<p>"Now make yourself quite comfortable upon this couch," said
the doctor, "and breathe naturally, in the ordinary way," and in
a minute, at latest, the anaesthesia should have begun. The
instant, however, the inhaler was over the patient's face, he
uttered a groan of dreadful agony, and, pulling up his hands,
gripped fiercely at his chest. He groaned dreadfully again, his
face, from which the doctor had snatched the inhaler, was
contorted in spasm, and then, with a long, deep sigh, all his
muscles seemed to relax to nothingness and&mdash;he was dead. It
had all happened in less than ten seconds.</p>

<p>"God," exclaimed Dr. Wilkie with his own face as white as
death; "it's angina!"</p>

<p>And angina pectoris it undoubtedly was; that dread disease of
the heart which may hover over its victims for years and years
and never strike, and yet may strike suddenly and bring death
almost in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie saw it was all over, and realised nothing could be
done. He sank back into a chair and wiped the beads of sweat
from his ghastly face. "God," he exclaimed again, "what a
tragedy! Another death when I have been giving the anaesthetic
alone by myself! It will mean ruin for me!"</p>

<p>And then suddenly he heard footsteps in the corridor just
outside his room, loud laughing voices and his bell was pinged
again.</p>

<p>"What luck," he heard someone say; "so he's in after all, and
we can get him to make the fourth! He won't mind playing for
five bob a hundred. He's a real gambler at cards."</p>

<p>The doctor swallowed hard. The speaker was well known to him.
It was young Bentley of the Stock Exchange. It couldn't be
worse, he groaned. The man was one of the biggest gossips in the
city, and, if he were one of the first to learn what had just
happened, would make a fine tale of it for weeks and weeks. He
sat silent and made no sound.</p>

<p>The bell was pinged again. Then the same voice came in
disappointment, "Gad, he's not in! The beggar's gone off,
forgetting to switch off his lights," and after a few more
moments of waiting the late callers returned up the corridor the
way they had come.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie was much calmer now. He had thought out what he
would do. He would take the dead man with him in his car almost
straight away to the hospital and, arriving there, make out he
must have died on the way. Anything better than that he should
have to give out there had been a death in his consulting rooms.
Then he would say nothing about having started to give him an
anaesthetic. It would be quite simple, the body was not heavy,
and he could carry it down to his car through the back entrance
of the building. His car was parked in the yard beyond, and no
one would be likely to be there if he waited a further few
minutes.</p>

<p>Realising, of course, that the body must be fully clothed
when it reached the hospital, he started to replace all the dead
man's garments. Lifting up the waistcoat, a small tin box
dropped out of one of the pockets, and picking it up his eyes
opened very wide as they fell on the label on the lid.</p>

<p>"Nitrite of amyl capsules!" he gasped. His face puckered up
in furious anger. "Then he was subject to angina attacks! The
wretch&mdash;he lied to me so that I should give him the
anaesthetic! What a dirty trick!"</p>

<p>Putting on the waistcoat, he snatched up the jacket, and the
belt which had been tucked underneath came into view. He lifted
up that, too, and instantly the expression upon his face
underwent a startling change. The belt was heavy, very heavy, as
heavy as gold!</p>

<p>His hands shook as he proceeded to examine what it contained.
Two of its four pockets were filled with well wrapped-up
Australian sovereigns and the others were stuffed hard with
Australian and English bank notes!</p>

<p>An hour later Dr. Wilkie was still in his consulting room,
which now, however, was in complete darkness. He was sitting
back in the chair he always occupied when he was interviewing
patients. He was no longer frowning, his expression being only a
very thoughtful one. The dead man, fully clothed again, was
lying extended upon the couch, but the belt he had been wearing
was now locked in one of the drawers of the doctor's desk. Every
now and then the doctor flashed a little torch to see how the
time was passing. He was waiting to be almost absolutely sure
the building was deserted.</p>

<p>At last 9 o'clock struck, and he rose stealthily to his feet.
The time for action had come.</p>

<p>Now, in after years, although he knew that what he did that
night by sudden decision was absolutely wrong and contrary to
all moral code, Dr. Wilkie always tried to make excuses for
himself. To begin with, he argued, the patient had treated him
most dishonorably in deceiving him and making out he had never
suffered from any form of heart trouble, whereas by the carrying
about of those capsules with him he must have been aware he had
a very grave disease and was living always on the precipice
side. And he had lied there, deliberately and selfishly, so that
he might receive an anaesthetic straight away, when there was
only one doctor to attend him. He had given no thought to the
injury it would be doing to the doctor's reputation if anything
went wrong. So Dr. Wilkie argued that in bare justice he was
entitled to substantial compensation for the predicament he was
now in. And in what way could he obtain that compensation, he
went on, except by appointing himself the dead man's heir and
appropriating what was in the belt. Another thing, the man had
said he didn't think he had any living relations, and so,
really, no one was actually being robbed.</p>

<p>Of course, it was all very crooked reasoning, but to some
extent it eased the doctor's conscience and prevented him
regarding himself as an undoubted member of the criminal
classes.</p>

<p>The following afternoon a paragraph appeared in the evening
newspaper announcing that that morning the body of an unknown
man had been found at the entrance to a small by-road leading
off the main one to Mount Lofty, and that an inquest would be
held on the morrow.</p>

<p>With the inquest duly taking place, it was found the man had
died from natural causes. Nothing had been discovered as to his
identity, but it was mentioned £10, plus a few shillings, had
been found in his pockets. In the same issue of the evening
newspaper which gave an account of the inquest was a stop-press
message announcing that a steamship, believed to be the
<i>Nerbudda</i>, had founded in a tremendous storm in the Great
Australian Bight, and it was feared all hands had been lost.
Neither then or later did it enter into anybody's mind that the
man whose body had been found near Mount Lofty was to have been
one of her passengers.</p>

<p>There was exactly £2,105 in the belt which had come off the
dead man, £325 in gold and £1,700 in notes, and the money put
Dr. Wilkie well upon his feet. He was, however, most cautious
how he handled it, paying none of the notes in large amounts
into his bank. Instead, he kept them in the safe in his house
and, for the most part, drew upon them as he wanted for
expenses. They were all in tens and fives, and of no sequence.
From appearance, too, they had been well in circulation, and so
he had no fear that any of the numbers had been kept.</p>

<p>He did not touch any of the sovereigns until nearly a whole
year had gone, and then, finding they were worth more than their
face value, sent two hundred of them to the Mint in Melbourne.
The remaining one hundred and twenty-five he was intending to
retain, with some idea at the back of his mind that they should
be kept handy for some unexpected emergency.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that the tide of prosperity for him had
definitely set in. Moving to a good house in North Adelaide, and
buying one of the best cars, was evidence to the majority of
people that his practice must be increasing, and that,
therefore, he must know his work well and be a good doctor. So
he began to be talked about as one of the rising young
physicians of the city, and more and more patients started to
come in.</p>

<p>Then prosperous, good-looking, and with very nice manners, he
was considered a most eligible candidate for matrimony, but,
although partial to the society of the other sex, he never
showed a preference for any particular girl. As the price of
success, he knew he would have to marry one day, for no one
cares too much for an elderly bachelor doctor. But he told
himself there was plenty of time, and when he did marry it would
be his head more than his heart which would guide him. His
marriage would be one of convenience, and he would probably
marry for money. He had not much belief in love, as distinct
from the state of passion into which most men could work
themselves when intrigued with a pretty girl.</p>

<p>His conscience continued to worry him a little about that
money he had taken, and the knowledge of how he had been tempted
and fallen made him feel very sorry for those who had done wrong
and been caught. One day he read in the newspaper how a middle-
aged clerk, with a wife and young family, after struggling for
years and years under an ever-increasing load of debt, had at
last succumbed to temptation and embezzled his employer's money.
The embezzlement had been going on for longer than a year, and
the amount involved had mounted up to more than £200. At last
the man had been caught, and, brought before the magistrate, had
been committed for trial, bail being refused.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie sought the family out, saw to it that they were in
no want while the breadwinner was away, and employed a first
class lawyer to defend him. Then, when the case came up for
trial and the man pleaded guilty, to everyone's amazement it was
learnt that every penny of the embezzled money had been refunded
by the wife. This made things look not nearly so black, and,
after an impassioned appeal by the lawyer for mercy, the
presiding judge allowed the prisoner to go free under the First
Offender's Act. Added to that, it never came out who, someone
provided the man with a motor car and some small amount of
capital to enable him to start as a travelling salesman
himself.</p>

<p>In many other instances when, through their own weakness and
folly, people were down and out, the young doctor helped them to
their feet again, and gave them back their self-respect. "Part
of my atonement," he told himself. He made a grimace. "But I'm
doing it very comfortably and easily for myself, and it's really
nothing of the punishment I ought to have. In fact, it's no
punishment at all. I can afford the money and don't miss it at
all." He sighed. "If the mills of God grind slowly, then I'm
certainly getting off very lightly."</p>

<p>About a year later, however, he got a nasty jar, and
realised, that though one's wrongdoing might have been most
carefully buried very deep down, it's ghost was liable to rise
at any moment.</p>

<p>One night he was dining out and his hostess suddenly
remarked. "Oh, Dr. Wilkie, have you noticed that pretty little
new nurse they've got at the Children's Hospital?" She laughed.
"But there, of course, you have! You men are all the same,
although some of you try to make out we women have no appeal to
you except at patients."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie smiled. "To which nurse do you refer,
particularly?" he asked. "There are quite a lot of pretty ones
there."</p>

<p>"To the little one with that auburn hair and those lovely
eyes. Nurse Harris, she's called. You must have seen her. She's
a quiet, gentle little thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know her," nodded the doctor. "She seems very
shy."</p>

<p>"Well, I met her at a small tea party this afternoon," went
on his hostess, "and she told us quite a little romance. She's
only come over from England a few weeks, and thinks she's got a
rich uncle somewhere here. They've heard nothing about him for
many years, but someone at home told them a little while ago
that they'd met him, and he was very wealthy. He'd made a
fortune in sheep or cattle on shares or something."</p>

<p>"Well, why doesn't she look him up?" asked Dr. Wilkie. He
smiled. "That seems the reasonable thing for her to do."</p>

<p>"But she doesn't know where he is and the man who brought the
news couldn't tell her. All he knew was that he met this
supposed uncle once when upon a holiday cruise to New Guinea. He
hadn't the remotest idea where he lived, except that it was
somewhere in Australia."</p>

<p>"But how does he know the man was this girl's uncle?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know at all, but it certainly looks like it, the
same name, about the right age, and them both coming out here
about 30 years ago from the same place in England. Norwich, in
Norfolk."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie felt a horrible shiver run down his spine. "God,
then this girl must be the dead man's niece! His name had been
Harris, and he said he came from Norwich. So he had had
relations to leave his money to, and, in taking it, he, Derek
Wilkie, was just a common thief!"</p>

<p>However, when he got home that night and was thinking
everything over, Dr. Wilkie was by no means so certain that the
patient who had come to him that fateful evening could have been
the girl's uncle. The man had hardly been the type to go on a
holiday cruise to New Guinea. Also, he had not seemed as if he
were accustomed to riches. Rather, he appeared to have lived
rough and not to have made a big success in life. Probably, he
had spent all his time in scraping together that money he had in
the belt, and had ruined his health in doing so. Besides, a
really rich man would not have been carrying so much money on
him, and, certainly, would not have been travelling home in a
small cargo vessel. Another thing, too, and here the doctor
smiled ever so slightly, the man who died was of much too coarse
and rough a fibre to have a niece of the daintiness of little
nurse Harris now at the Children's Hospital.</p>

<p>Of course, as his hostess that evening had rightly surmised,
he had noticed Nurse Harris! Indeed, what man who came to the
hospital had not? She was unusually pretty, with eyes of a rare
forget-me-not color, and with nice features, a good complexion
and rich auburn hair and had a most attractive personality.</p>

<p>The following morning, when visiting the hospital, the very
first nurse with whom he was brought in contact was this one,
who was occasioning him so much thought. She did some slight
services for him, very deftly with her beautifully moulded small
hands, and, upon preparing to leave the ward, he stopped for a
few moments to ask her how she was getting on. It amused him to
notice how deeply she blushed. She was not very intellectual, he
thought, but she was certainly very pretty and of the clinging
type which so appeals to the other sex. It made him most
uncomfortable to think that there was even the most remote
possibility he had taken money which, rightly, belonged to her.
He, in part, however, consoled himself with the thought that her
future was assured. With her prettiness she was sure to get
married, and, if she played her cards well&mdash;he was inclined
to be a little uncertain there&mdash;marry well.</p>

<p>He would have been thunderstruck if he had known what was
then passing through Annabel St. Clair Harris's mind. She had
certainly decided she would get married, and for her future
husband she had chosen a young medical man, one Derek Wilkie, of
North terrace. She knew she would have her work cut out to get
him, but for all that she was quite confident in her ultimate
success. Her mirror told her several times a day that her
chances were good.</p>

<p>And then, in the succeeding weeks, followed an interesting
little struggle between the two, with one of the participants in
the fight being quite unaware that he was taking part in any
contest at all.</p>

<p>At first matters proceeded very quietly, all that happened
being it had become quite the natural thing for Nurse Harris to
catch Dr. Wilkie's eye whenever he came into her ward, and quite
natural, too, for him to give her a nod and pleasant smile.
Also, whenever they were attending some little patient alone
together, he would nearly always make some small chatty remark
to her. He was interested to learn how she liked Australia, if
she found the climate too hot, and if her work were too tiring
for her.</p>

<p>At the annual Nurses' Ball he had two dances with her and
took her into supper. On the whole, however, she was
disappointed, as she had been half hoping he would have wanted
to sit out one of the dances with her in the garden. But nothing
happened like that. He was just very pleasant and friendly with
her, but there was not the very suggestion of any
flirtation.</p>

<p>Still, all the same, Annabel would have, undoubtedly, been
not a little heartened had she known he was thinking quite a lot
about her after he got home. "A fascinating little girl, that,"
he told himself with a frown, "and I shall certainly have to be
careful. Now, if only I were a marrying man&mdash;&mdash;," but
he shook his head and stopped himself from contemplating the
possibility. Still, he dreamed about her during the night.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, she went completely out of his
mind, for upon opening his paper at breakfast time he received a
most terrible shock, with the vision of penal servitude flashing
up instantly into his mind.</p>

<p>He read that a number of sovereigns had been found to be
missing from the gold reserves of a certain Queensland bank and
that, although the theft had only just been discovered, it must
have taken place about two years previously. The announcement
went on to state that from the number of the stolen sovereigns
involved the police were hopeful of being able to trace whoever
had disposed of them.</p>

<p>"And what if they were the ones I took from that belt,"
exclaimed Dr. Wilkie with a face as white as death. His heart
beat like a sledge-hammer. "Good God, they will trace me by my
having sold them direct to the Melbourne Mint! Oh, what a fool
I've been!"</p>

<p>That day he went through the greatest mental torture he
thought it possible for him to endure. He had sowed the wind and
now he would reap the whirlwind. His punishment loomed up before
him. Ruin and disgrace were staring him in the face. The police
might be coming for him any moment now and the only tale he
could think of to tell them would sound flimsy and improbable in
the extreme.</p>

<p>He was going to make out that his last remaining relation,
the old aunt who had died a little less than two years
previously, had given him the sovereigns. It was quite true he
had been her heir, but, for many years she had been living upon
a small annuity, and all that had come to him at her death had
been some odd bits of old furniture.</p>

<p>In the first moment of panic he had snatched the remaining
one hundred and twenty-five sovereigns out of his safe and,
making certain neither of his two maids was about, had thrust
them, wrapped round a thick sock, deep in the soft earth under
the wood-heap. He realised he would have no explanation at all
to give if exactly 325 sovereigns had been stolen and that
number traced to him.</p>

<p>With a dreadful anguish in his heart, he yet went about his
work that day with his usual smiling face, and no one could have
dreamt the trouble he was in. It was his morning at the
hospital, and to everyone he was as bright as ever. He was
cheerful with the little patients, chatted to the sisters and
gave Nurse Harris his nicest smile. His rounds of his wards
over, he was just upon the point of going out of the hospital
when Nurse Harris came running out after him with his
stethoscope which, in his abstraction, he had inadvertently left
behind. Then, as he was thanking her, she interrupted hastily,
in an intense whisper, "Oh, doctor, here are the parents of that
little girl with the bad pneumonia. Do speak to them. They'll
think so much of anything coming from you. They know how
desperately sick she is and they're terribly worried."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie turned sharply to find a man and a woman almost at
his elbow. The man was older than the woman, who was, obviously,
still in her early twenties. They both looked absolutely worn
out with anxiety.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Benson," said Nurse Harris sweetly, "this is the doctor
who's looking after your little Dorothy. He'll tell you how
she's getting on."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, " burst out the woman, almost in tears. "Do tell
me she's going to get well!"</p>

<p>"Get well!" smiled Dr. Wilkie. "Of course, she is!" His face
sobered down. "She's a very sick little girl now, but she's
responding beautifully to that wonderful new drug we've given
her, and tomorrow I expect to see a great change for the
better." His nice smile came again. "Now, don't you worry. If
your little daughter belonged to the Queen of England she
couldn't be better looked after than she is now. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"And Heaven forgive me, for being so sure," he sighed, as he
drove away in his car. "The poor kid's deuced bad, but at any
rate she's no worse this morning."</p>

<p>That afternoon he got through his patients somehow, but he
was devoutly thankful when the last appointment was through. He
was just preparing to leave for home, when his nurse came in
quickly with the announcement that an Inspector Benson wanted to
see him. Then she went on to add, "He says he only just wants to
speak to you for one minute about his little girl in the
Children's Hospital." She smiled. "He's brought you a lovely
bunch of carnations."</p>

<p>The doctor felt almost faint in his relief. With her first
words he had been quite sure the police had come for him, but
now he remembered that that morning Nurse Harris had addressed
the mother of the very sick child as "Mrs. Benson."</p>

<p>"Show him in," he said a little huskily, "but if anyone else
comes now, say I've gone."</p>

<p>The inspector was most apologetic for coming to the rooms so
late, but was venturing, he said, to bring him some carnations
for his kindness to them that morning. "I've just come from the
hospital, sir," he went on, "and the sister told me my little
girl is decidedly better this afternoon." His voice choked. "Oh,
how you relieved our minds this morning sir! My poor wife hadn't
eaten a thing for days, but after you had spoken to us she went
home and had a good meal. We were so grateful to you."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" smiled the doctor. "They are happy moments for
us when we can give our patients and and their friends some
hope." A sudden thought struck him and he went on to ask a
question, the asking of which was to alter the whole course of
his life. "Oh, by the by, he said, "have you, by chance, heard
anything officially about those sovereigns which I read in this
morning's newspaper had been stolen from a Queensland bank?"</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "Yes, sir, we heard about it last
night, and we're to look out for a possible confederate of the
thief. It is thought the sovereigns may have been sold over
here. At the time when they are supposed to have been stolen
they were worth about twenty-five shillings. Of course, they're
worth more than that now."</p>

<p>He went on, "The story's rather interesting. It appears an
officer in the All Consolidated Bank in Brisbane died suddenly
last week, and the idea came to somebody to go through the bags
of gold which, at one time, had been under his special charge.
Then it was found that one of the bags had been tampered with by
taking out some of the sovereigns and substituting two-shilling
pieces to make up the correct weight." He laughed. "An old trick
which ought to have been foreseen and guarded against."</p>

<p>"But how do they know, as the papers say, that the stealing
took place two years ago?" frowned the doctor.</p>

<p>The inspector smiled. "Because it happens that two years ago
all the bags had been taken away from this particular officer
who's just died and put under seal. No one had any access to
them since. So, they know they were tampered with when he held
them."</p>

<p>"Very bad management, I should say," nodded the doctor. "Do
you know if the bank lost much?"</p>

<p>"No, only two hundred sovereigns. Those were all which had
been taken."</p>

<p>The doctor's mind functioned slowly. Then he asked sharply,
and with rising excitement, "Are you sure it was only two
hundred? Not any more?"</p>

<p>"No, no more, sir. They're all we've got to enquire about
over here to find out, as I say, if that officer passed them
over to some South Australian confederate to get rid of." He
shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. "And a lot of chance
we've got after all these months."</p>

<p>The inspector took his leave, and Dr. Wilkie lost no time in
getting away. He saw a way out of everything and how, whatever
happened now, he could place himself in a position of no danger
at all.</p>

<p>Still for all that, he was to learn within an hour that he
had had one of the narrowest escapes possible, and that it had
been by only a matter of minutes that he had managed to save
himself.</p>

<p>He had been back home less than half an hour, occupying
himself feverishly in taking certain precautions in case the
police ever should come to question him, when he heard a car
pull up in the road, and from his study window saw two men, who
were strangers to him, getting out. They looked big and hefty,
exactly, he told himself with a dreadful pang, like
policemen.</p>

<p>His heart beat furiously and he could hardly get his breath.
Then, all in the flash of a second, his confidence came back and
he smiled. He was sure he had the situation well in hand if only
he met it boldly.</p>

<p>A maid knocked at the door and came in. "Two gentlemen to see
you, sir," she said. "They say they're not patients and won't
give their names. They say the matter is important. I've shown
them into the breakfast room."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie went into them at once. "Good evening," he said
pleasantly, "and what is it you want?"</p>

<p>One of the strangers handed him his card. "I'm Inspector
Brandon," he said, "and this gentleman is Inspector Williams."
His voice was grim and hard. "We've come to ask you some
questions."</p>

<p>To their amazement the doctor looked very amused. "But you're
quick, aren't you?" he asked smilingly. "Why it was only this
morning that I read about it in the newspapers!" He nodded. "Of
course, you've come to ask me about those 200 sovereigns I sold
to the Mint in Melbourne last year!"</p>

<p>The inspector scowled. He had certainly not expected quite so
cheerful a reception. "That's it!" he nodded back quickly.
"You've hit the nail on the head, right enough." He looked very
stern. "Then you admit you sold them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" laughed Dr. Wilkie. "Didn't I sell them in my
own name, and give my proper North terrace address?" It might
have been almost a joke from the way he was taking it. "You
didn't have any difficulty in finding me, did you?"</p>

<p>The inspector was looking rather annoyed. Evidently, he had
thought he was on a soft thing, and now he was note quite so
sure. He ignored the doctor's question, and, instead, asked one
himself. "Where did you get the 200 sovereigns from? That's what
we want to know."</p>

<p>The doctor was still smiling. "And I'll tell you," he
replied. "An aunt of mine, the late Mrs. Stone, of Port Augusta,
gave them to me. She had died about two months before I sold
them."</p>

<p>The inspector spoke with heavy sarcasm. "Ah, and that'll
clear up everything, as, of course, they were set down in the
probate. She left them to you in her will!"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't," corrected the doctor. "She made me a
present of them soon after I qualified, which was nearly six
years ago. I was not to sell them until after she was dead, and
I didn't do so."</p>

<p>It was the inspector who looked amused now. "And, of course,
you will be able to produce ample evidence to prove all this?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie shook his head. "No, not a soul was told about
it." He scoffed. "Who'd want it known he's got a lot of
sovereigns in the house, particularly so as I'd got no safe
then?"</p>

<p>The two inspectors looked at each other, and then the one
who'd been doing all the talking turned back to the doctor and
said reprovingly, "Come, come, Dr. Wilkie, all this a little bit
thin, isn't it? You don't really expect us to believe it, do
you?" He raised his voice harshly. "Two hundred sovereigns were
stolen from the Brisbane bank, and you are known to have been in
the possession of the same number. You, now, want us to believe
that your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to believe anything," retorted the doctor
angrily. "I'm not interested in your beliefs in the very
slightest degree."</p>

<p>"Those two hundred sovereigns," went on the inspector,
raising his hand impressively, "were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My own lawful property," broke in Dr. Wilkie hotly, "equally
as are the other ones I have in my safe now. They belong
definitely to me, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector's words came like the strike of a snake. "What
other ones?" he demanded, in an angry tone. "What do you mean?
Are you making out you've got any more? How many? Then show us
them."</p>

<p>A few minutes later it was a decidedly disgusted pair of
detectives who left the doctor's house. They had both seen and
handled the other hundred and twenty-five sovereigns, which had
been done up in a faded piece of old newspaper, dated seven
years before, and which were tucked in an old work-box, from its
appearance, made many years before either of them had been born.
They had had to admit that their whole case had fallen down,
and, rather grudgingly, had apologised to Dr. Wilkie for having
entertained suspicions of his honesty. They were most annoyed
that to get all the credit of the arrest for themselves they had
persuaded the authorities in Melbourne to send them all this
long distance upon what had turned out to be a wild-goose
chase.</p>

<p>Poor fellows, how were they to know how badly they had been
deceived? How they were to know the sovereigns had been put in
that work-box only a bare ten minutes before they had arrived,
and that the faded piece of old newspaper had been hurriedly
snatched from the lining of a drawer in his aunt's very ancient
wardrobe, reposing derelict in the lumber-room.</p>

<p>As they were driving away from the doctor's house, the elder
inspector remarked frowningly to his colleague, "But there's no
getting away from it, Thomas; that tale he told us must be
true."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," admitted the other grudgingly. He shook his
head. "Still I'd like very much to know why those blessed
sovereigns smelt so strong of fresh earth. No, you needn't grin.
I'm not a smoker like you and can depend upon my good old nose
anywhere." He looked puzzled. "I don't understand it at
all."</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie never heard anything more about the stolen
Brisbane sovereigns and, in a few days, the matter had ceased to
trouble him and he was picking up the threads of his old
carefree life again. He felt under a great debt of gratitude to
Nurse Harris for her making the two Bensons known to him that
morning outside the hospital. But for that encounter, the father
would not have visited him later and furnished him with the
information which had enabled him deal so effectively with the
detectives from Melbourne. With all his gratitude to the nurse,
however, he told himself he was not going to let it drift into
any feeling of romance.</p>

<p>In the meantime Annabel had been thinking quite a lot about
him, and boldly making up her mind to make him take more
interest in her. So one morning she rang up his professional
rooms and told his nurse she was wanting to see him about
herself. She said she had got neuritis and was also bothered
with insomnia.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next afternoon she showed him a very nicely-
moulded little arm and pointed out where she was getting the
pain. He examined the arm carefully, rather annoyed, however,
that the thought had entered into his mind how smooth and soft
it would feel if he put it against his cheek. Still it was only
in a most correct professional way that he advised her what to
do, and gave her a prescription for something to make her
sleep.</p>

<p>"And come back to me in a fortnight," he told her, "and I'll
see how you've been getting on."</p>

<p>Annabel had no intention of getting the sleeping tablets, but
that night she wished devoutly that she had. She was deeply in
love with the doctor and the thinking about him kept her awake
for many hours. She was very despondent, for it seemed now so
evident to her there was not the slightest tender feeling on his
side. With all his pleasantness towards her he was only
regarding her in just the same light as all the other girls he
met. He would never fall in love with her.</p>

<p>And then chance came to her help in a most unexpected
way.</p>

<p>Upon the afternoon of the day before she was due to pay him
the next professional visit she went down to Seacliff to take a
little child of some very poor parents some vests she had
knitted for him. Upon her way back to the railway station,
coming to a café she thought she would go in for a quick cup of
tea. As she entered she heard a car draw up outside, and her
heart began bumping violently when she saw Dr. Wilkie come in
after her. He caught sight of her at once, and, after the very
briefest hesitation, came and sat down beside her. He ordered
tea for them both, and said there was no hurry for her to catch
any train, as he would drive her back to the hospital.</p>

<p>"And it's lucky I met you," he smiled, "for there's a big
shower coming over and you'd have certainly got wet before you
reached the railway station."</p>

<p>Then for half an hour they sat talking and, of set purpose,
he drew her out about her life in England. She told him her
father had been a doctor and it was his death a year previously
which had determined her to come to Australia. She had now no
relations in England, but believed her late father's brother was
alive somewhere in Australia. She said nothing, however, about
this uncle being supposed to be a very rich man. The doctor
listened most interestedly and, regarding her critically,
thought many times how attractive she was.</p>

<p>The rain held off and at last they got up to leave. They had
not, however, gone very far before the sky blackened and big
drops of rain began to fall. "Hullo," exclaimed the doctor,
peering through the windscreen, "but it looks as if a real
cloudburst were coming right over us," and, turning into a small
bye-road almost arched above with thick branches of trees, he
pulled up in the lee of a high wall. "I think we'll stop here
for a minute or two," he went on. "It'll only be a shower and
will soon pass. Still, it's no good driving through a deluge of
rain if one can avoid it."</p>

<p>It was not long before lighting-up time, and with the heavy
cloud hanging over, everything became very dark. The rain began
to pour down in torrents, and even in part sheltered as they
were, it crashed thunderously upon the roof of the car. The air
became bitterly cold and Annabel shivered. Dr. Wilkie smiled
round at her. "Feeling cold?" he asked. "And so am I." He leant
over to the back of the car and pulled up a rug. "It's not a
very big one," he called out above the noise of the rain, "but
it'll be large enough for us both if you come a bit closer to
me. That's it," and he reached out and pulled her near to
him.</p>

<p>Annabel shivered, but, it was no longer from cold. "Not
feeling warm yet?" laughed the doctor. "Then come nearer still.
Don't be afraid," and this time he drew her very close to him.
Then what was more natural than that he should look down to see
if she were quite comfortable, what was more natural still, when
realising the closeness of her face to his, that he should kiss
her? Her lips were soft and moist and he thought it quite a nice
kiss. Then, to adopt the phraseology of the profession, he took
another dose of the same medicine, finding it this time even
more to his liking, as the kiss was now returned. A third kiss
was exchanged and then, to his horror he realised what he had
done.</p>

<p>His regret was instantaneous and profound, but&mdash;and he
was always most thankful for it afterwards&mdash; he did not let
Annabel see it. He disengaged himself gently from her, and,
bending his head down, peered intently through the windscreen.
All his interest now was, apparently, to see how the storm was
going. He was trying to act now so that the girl beside him
should think his kissing had been just a casual and careless
happening, with no real significance. Externally he was quite
calm, but inwardly he was furious with himself. Although he
admired Annabel, he was not a scrap in love with her, and it
simply horrified him to think he might have led her to admit she
had some deeper feelings for him. It was a really dreadful thing
for him to have done.</p>

<p>An awkward silence followed, and then, the storm beginning to
die down, he said briskly, "Well, I think we'd better be getting
on. I've got an appointment in North Enfield at six."</p>

<p>They talked very little during the rest of the journey, both
being busy with their own thoughts. Annabel could not rightly
analyse hers, being thrilled and dejected at the same time. A
hopeful tremor went through her when, in parting, the doctor
remarked with a smile that he would be seeing her again on the
morrow when she came to him about her arm. Later, when he was
putting his car back in the garage, he noticed she had left her
purse on the seat. Hesitating a moment, for he was wondering if
it were important enough for him to ring her up, and that he
most certainly did not want to do and let everybody learn she
had been with him in his car, he opened it. It contained the
return half of her railway ticket and just over three shillings
in money.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing," he frowned, "and perhaps that's all
she's got until next pay-day when, as a probationer, she'll only
be getting a few shillings a week!" He sighed. "And there's just
the chance that this car, as well as almost everything else I've
got, by rights belongs to her. Really, it's not nice knowing
oneself to be a sort of thief and meeting the very person one,
perhaps, has robbed!"</p>

<p>That night his thoughts kept him awake until well into the
small hours, and his conscience told him that the very least he
could do was to marry Nurse Harris. Then, as he remembered how
pretty she had looked when he was bending down over her in the
car, he knew that if only he were a marrying man it would be no
hardship. She was certainly the prettiest girl he had come
across, and, if he were any judge of character, one of the very
nicest ones, too. He feel asleep at last and dreamed he was
being put in prison. It was a truly dreadful dream, and he woke
up bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p>Many times during the next morning he considered how he would
meet Annabel when she came to him that afternoon but, in the
end, could come to no conclusion. One moment, he was relieved to
think his own nurse would be hovering about, and the next he was
annoyed that she would be.</p>

<p>Then chance took a hand in the game again and played a strong
card in Annabel's favor. At half-past four Dr. Wilkie's nurse
came in to him, looking rather flustered. "Oh, doctor," she
exclaimed, "I wonder if you would mind if I went off now. I've
just had a message that my sister's been taken ill, and I want
to go to her as soon as I can. There are only two more patients
to come. Nurse Harris at five, and Mrs. Mornington at a quarter
past."</p>

<p>Of course he let her go. Then, when Annabel duly arrived at
five, she was kept waiting and the patient who had come after
her taken in, first. She trembled when at length the doctor
himself came to usher her into the consulting room.</p>

<p>His manner was quiet and very professional. He examined the
arm gravely and pronounced it all right. Then he leant back to
his chair and regarded her critically. "And so, Nurse Harris,"
he said, "for the time, at all events, I've finished with you as
a patient." His face broke into a pleasant smile. "And now I'm
going to speak to you as a friend." He raised his hand
warningly. "But, first, can I depend upon you to give a message
to matron when you get back?"</p>

<p>Poor little Annabel's heart was all of a flutter. His words
were very ordinary, but somehow she sensed something behind
them, and she noticed his hand was shaking. She steadied her
voice with an effort. "Of course, you can," she laughed. "As a
nurse, am I not being trained not to forget anything? What's the
message?"</p>

<p>He moved his chair a little closer to her and she felt her
legs shaking under her. "You're to tell her," he said slowly,
"that you'll be leaving the hospital very shortly, as soon as
its convenient for her."</p>

<p>Annabel reddened furiously. There was no misunderstanding
what he meant, but, with all the thrill of happiness which
stirred in her, came also the woman instinct not to surrender
herself without some sort of struggle. She rose to her feet to
get farther from him and with a little bow, asked mockingly,
"And am I to take that, please sir, as an offer of marriage?"
She smiled archly. "Because, if so, I shall require time to
think it over, and get advice from my friends. I shall have to
enquire also, into your charac&mdash;&mdash;," but that was as
far as she got before he had taken her in his arms, and for
quite a long minute, made speech impossible.</p>

<p>There was surely no happier or more triumphant young woman in
all the world than was Nurse Harris when she went to give her
message to matron that night. "I've come to tell you," she said
very demurely, "that I shall be leaving you very shortly,
whenever it is convenient for you after a fortnight from
now."</p>

<p>The matron's face fell. "Oh, I'm sorry, nurse," she said.
"I'm quite pleased with you, and thought you were getting on so
nicely. Why do you want to leave?"</p>

<p>Annabel blushed. "I'm going to be married, matron, as soon as
I can get away."</p>

<p>"Oh, and pray to whom?" smiled the matron. ''Who's the
fortunate man?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Wilkie," replied Annabel. She looked shy and cast down
her eyes. "We became engaged this afternoon."</p>

<p>The matron gasped, "Oh, you sly little puss!" Her face
beamed. "And this has been going on under our own eyes, and yet
I'm sure none of us have noticed it. I congratulate you, dear.
Your doctor's a very nice man."</p>

<p>In about ten minutes everybody in the hospital had heard of
the engagement, in a quarter of an hour it was beginning to
filter round outside, and long before midnight it had been
discussed at scores of bridge tables in society circles.</p>

<p>They were married within the month and went to the Blue
Mountains for their honeymoon. If the doctor had not been in
love with his wife when he took her away, that was certainly not
the case when he returned home with her. All the honeymoon long
he had been wanting to kick himself for having dared to imagine
there was going to be any sacrifice on his part in marrying her.
Over and over again, he told himself he was one of the most
fortunate of men, and that, surely, never had there been a
sweeter or prettier girl for a wife.</p>

<p>After six months of marriage, too, his general view of
matrimony can be best realised by his telling Annabel one
morning that the happiest moment for him of all the day was when
he came home at night and saw her waiting for him in the
hall.</p>

<p>The months passed on and then came one of the most
astonishing happenings to the chain of events following upon the
coming of the man with the belt to Dr. Wilkie upon that fateful
night.</p>

<p>It was getting on towards Melbourne Cup time, and one day the
doctor said to his wife, "Look here, sweetheart, what about us
going to see the Cup run? That'll be your last outing for a long
time, and then you'll have to begin to take things easier."</p>

<p>Annabel was delighted and so the great day found them upon
the historic racecourse. They lost their money on the Cup, but
in the race following Annabel saw there was a horse of the
unusual name of "Pride of Yare" down to run.</p>

<p>"Oh, do let's back him, dear!" she exclaimed excitedly. "The
Yare is the name of the river which runs round my home to dear
old England. I've often swum in it as a girl."</p>

<p>So they each invested a pound and, with no one seeming to
think the horse stood much chance, the bookmaker gave them
twenty to one.</p>

<p>To their great delight the horse won easily, and it was a
thrilling moment for Annabel when she saw her husband collect
£42. Later, passing the stall where "Pride of Yare" was standing
to have his aluminium running shoes taken off, they saw a good-
looking, well-dressed man of about fifty talking smilingly to
the "boy" who was holding the horse's head. "That's the owner,
of course," said the doctor, and, looking down at their race-
card, he saw that his name was Montague.</p>

<p>That night after dinner, in the lounge of their hotel, they
saw the same man again, standing talking to some friends. "Oh,
doesn't he look pleased!" exclaimed Annabel. "I suppose he won a
lot of money."</p>

<p>A waiter at that moment came up to bring them their coffee,
and the doctor asked casually. "Does that Mr. Montague over
there own many horses, do you know?"</p>

<p>The waiter looked in the direction he indicated. "Oh, yes,
sir, quite a number! He won the Caulfield Cup the other day with
Yarmouth, and, they say, got a fortune out of it, too." He
smiled. "Of course, his real name is not Montague. In private
life he's Mr. John Harris. He owns Wongalla, one of the biggest
sheep stations in New South Wales."</p>

<p>The waiter moved off, and Annabel exclaimed faintly, "Oh,
Derek, Yare and Yarmouth, both Norfolk names, and a John Harris
was my father's brother! I do believe he's my uncle!"</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie frowned. He was inclined to be cautious. "Is he
like your father to look at?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Annabel looked troubled. "N-o, he's not," she replied
hesitatingly. "He's fair, and father was dark. He's much bigger,
too, than poor father was. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the object of their conversation at that moment left the
men he had been talking to and moved up the lounge to pass quite
close to where they were sitting. In passing, as most men did
the doctor had noticed with pride, he glanced interestedly at
Annabel and then, with a quick look from her to her husband.
Then he moved on across the lounge and went and sat down by
himself.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Dr. Wilkie excitedly. "Did you see his
eyes?" he could hardly get his breath. "They are the same
forget-me-not color as yours." He jumped to his feet. "You stay
there and I'll go and give him the surprise of his life."</p>

<p>He walked briskly across the lounge and addressed the good-
looking man sitting down. "Excuse me, sir," he said, "but does
it happen you come from Norwich, in England?"</p>

<p>"I do," nodded the man, looking rather puzzled.</p>

<p>"And did you have a brother, a doctor, whose names were
Edward Harris, and who practised in Norwich?"</p>

<p>"I did," was the reply.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilkie laughed happily. "Then come along, sir, and I'll
introduce you to your niece, my wife."</p>

<p>For just a moment Mr. Harris appeared to hesitate, and then
he rose up and followed the doctor. When he came up to Annabel
he took a long look at her and then his face broke into an
expression of great delight. "Yes, you're the little Annabel
I've heard about," he exclaimed joyfully. "You're the very spit
of your mother, the Isabel Bevan I knew thirty years ago,
although, like me, you've got my dear mother's forget-me-not
colored eyes. Now, how on earth did you find me out? Tell me all
about it. I'm a lonely old bachelor and just thrilled to meet
one of my own flesh and blood."</p>

<p>A few days later, they all returned to Adelaide together, and
the next morning it appeared in the social columns of <i>"The
Advertiser"</i> that Mr. John Harris, of Wongalla Station, New
South Wales, and the owner of the Caulfield Cup winner, was
staying with his niece, Mrs. Derek Wilkie.</p>

<p>A great flutter was caused in society circles, and those
important dames who had been inclined to cold-shoulder Mrs. Dr.
Wilkie because in her maiden days she had been only a nurse at
the Children's Hospital, now tumbled over one another to be
quickest on her doorstep. No one was told how Annabel had come
to find her uncle, and it was believed she had known about him
all along. It was generally conceded that the doctor had been a
very clever fellow to have annexed so quietly such a rich prize
as the heiress of John Harris for his wife.</p>

<p>When Mr. Harris was bidding them good-bye to return to New
South Wales, he gave Annabel a sealed envelope. "A little
present between you both," he said, "but you're not to open it
until I have gone.</p>

<p>The envelope contained a cheque for £10,000.</p>

<p>A few days later, the treasurer of the Children's Hospital
received an anonymous donation, all in bank notes, and the exact
sum they amounted to was two thousand, one hundred and five
pounds.</p>

<p>At last Dr. Wilkie thought he was purged of his offence, and
his opinion was that he had got off very lightly. His conscience
was now at rest.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1942-07-02"></a>THE WAYS OF CHANCE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
2 July 1942.</h3>

<p class="first">IT was breakfast time at Cosey-corner Guest
Home in Prospect, and the grim-faced Mrs. Fowlery was feeding
her brood of boarders. The seven of them was made up of two
elegant young lady typistes, whose perfume smelt very nice,
three gents engaged in commercial pursuits, a clerk in a
solicitor's office, and a middle-aged civil servant who left for
work of a morning nearly an hour later than anybody else.</p>

<p>The boarders had just sat down and Bertie Bostock, one of the
commercial gents, looked gloomily at the rashers of bacon on his
plate, being strongly of opinion that they were of smaller
dimensions than those the others had received. He sighed,
however, with resignation, being quite aware that that was one
of Mrs. Fowlery's little ways of making her boarders remember
when they were behind with their payments. It was always easy to
tell by the way she helped people whether they were financial or
not.</p>

<p>"Going to be a fine day," remarked Miss James, one of the
elegant young ladies with the nice smell. "I see the papers say
some nice weather is setting in."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it," grunted Mr. Oldflowers, the civil
servant. "Prospects for fine weather couldn't be worse if that
weather man says they're coming. The idiot ought to be paid by
results, and then there'd be another family receiving
rations."</p>

<p>"But perhaps he hasn't got any family, Mr. Oldflowers,"
suggested Miss James sweetly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but he's sure to have," was the quick retort. "Muddlers
like him are always most prolific in propagating their species.
I've always noticed it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fowlery thought the conversation was beginning to border
on the indelicate, and broke in quickly. "Oh, Miss James, now I
think of it, would you mind noticing for me what the price of
tomatoes on the stalls is today? I'm sure my greengrocer is
cheating me. He looked secretive and turned away his eyes when I
told him yesterday he was quite tuppence too high. I
believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fowlery's belief on that particular matter was never
to be disclosed, for at that moment the maid came in with the
letters, and all interest was immediately focused upon a
registered one which she handed to young Bostock.</p>

<p>The latter's pleasant face clouded. He knew he was behind
with the weekly payments on his motor bicycle. "Hullo, what's
this?" he frowned.</p>

<p>"It may be a summons!" remarked the lawyer's clerk, winking
round the table. "It looks deuced like one to me."</p>

<p>But Bertie's face had cleared. He had recognised the
handwriting. It was from his married sister in Port Augusta.
"Joy, it's a present!" he exclaimed."It's my birthday today and
I am twenty-four."</p>

<p>Miss Perkins, the other pleasant smeller, broke in sweetly,
"But Mr. Bostock, didn't you say that Saturday evening last
month when you brought in all those bottles of beer it was your
birthday then?"</p>

<p>For the moment Bertie looked doubtful, and then he seemed to
remember. "Ah, so I did!" he exclaimed. He shook his head. "But
it wasn't true, Miss Perkins." He smiled. "I'm afraid I'm not a
truthful man. I'm like my father." He looked round at the
lawyer's clerk who had suggested the probability of his
registered letter being a summons and added, "You see he was
brought up for the law and that accounted for it."</p>

<p>With a request to be forgiven, he opened the envelope. It
contained a very short letter wrapped round a little wad of
notes. "My dear Bert," he read, "many happy returns. Tom had a
big spot of luck at the races yesterday and sends you £10 for a
birthday present. We don't forget what a sport you were when we
were so hard up when I was ill. With heaps of love, Susan."</p>

<p>Bert assumed a grand air. "From my solicitor," he announced
carelessly, "just telling me my uncle has died and that I have
succeeded to the estates and the baronetcy." He thrust the notes
back, uncounted, and held up the envelope for inspection. "A
hundred pounds to go on with," he grinned, "to make sure I don't
go short of drinks and cigarettes."</p>

<p>Mock congratulations were showered on him and then, the
telephone ringing sharply in an adjoining room, Mrs. Fowlery
went to see who it was. "Mr. Bostock," she called out, "a Mr.
Percy Packer wants you," and with a somewhat puzzled frown from
Bert, went to the phone. He did not, however, attempt to close
the intervening door and the breakfasters stayed their
conversation to hear what was going on.</p>

<p>They heard a big "Oh," and then Bert exclaimed, "Really,
really." Quite a long silence followed and then Bert said, "Of
course, of course, that's the right thing." Then Bert's voice
came very loudly. "Well, old man, I'll never be 24 again, but
many thanks for your congratulations. See you later."</p>

<p>He returned into the breakfast room to finish his interrupted
meal, and it was remembered afterwards he looked a little
pale.</p>

<p>"Just an invitation to lunch today at Government House," he
announced airily. "It was His Excellency's secretary speaking,
and he said how anxious Sir Roger was that I should come."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know," commented Miss James doubtfully, "that
Mr. Percy Packer was the Governor's secretary. I thought he was
that friend of yours who works with you in the Manchester
Department at Dogberry's and Jones."</p>

<p>"Not at all," retorted Bert emphatically. "My friend, the Mr.
Packer who works with me is quite a different person. This
Pakker the Governor's secretary spells his name with two
K's."</p>

<p>The meal over, they all rose up to go their several ways.
Arriving at Dogberry and Jones's Departmental Store, Bert found
his crony, the Packer with one K, waiting outside, and at once
to an interested observer their conduct might have seemed most
peculiar. Their faces wore the broadest of grins, but they
didn't speak, being content to wring each other's hands as if
they would never let them go. At last, however, they betook
themselves down to the basement of the store, where, for quite
five minutes, an intense whispered colloquy ensued, until,
indeed, it was time for them to go upstairs and resume the
selling of sheets, pillow-cases, dish-cloths, &amp;c. to the
opulent and elite of the city.</p>

<p>During the course of the morning, however, whenever they
chanced to meet, their conduct, at any rate to their fellow
employees was, to say the least of it, strange. They made
fearful grimaces at each other, horrid gurgling sounds came from
their throats, and they dug each other fiercely in the ribs
whenever opportunity offered. Miss Tomkins in "the dresses" put
it down to beer, and would have taken an affidavit that she
smelt peppermints, but Miss Winchester in the "millinery" was
more romantic, and a profound student of detective and dope
stories, was seriously of opinion they had been taking drugs.
She said they "rolled the balls of the eyes," just as one of the
characters did in "Poisoned Pills," an absorbing novel she had
recently been reading.</p>

<p>But all unmindful of the comment they had evoked, Bert and
Percy were joyously happy of heart and in the lunch-hour,
disdaining the provender provided by the firm, went out and had
a "good feed" as they called it, at a fish café.</p>

<p>"Now, Perce, old man," said Bert, as he drained the last drop
of coffee from his cup and spooned out the sugar, "we ought to
celebrate tonight. What about feeding at the good old Semiris
and taking a couple of birds with us." He tapped the registered
envelope which had been following him about all the morning in
his hip pocket. "I'll advance the ready and it can go down to
the expenses of the firm."</p>

<p>"All right, my boy," agreed Perce at once. "I'll bring my
girl"&mdash;he frowned&mdash;"but what about you? You're not
engaged like me."</p>

<p>"Not yet," frowned back Bert darkly, "although it mayn't be
long now." He nodded. "Still I'll bring along my bit of stuff. I
won't be without a skirt. We'll all meet at Beehive corner at
6.45 and after the feed do a decent picture afterwards."</p>

<p>Early that afternoon, Bert made a quick dash from the
Manchester Department, and approached the very superior Miss
Millington on "the perfumery." For long he had worshipped her
from afar, but had never dared to try and become friendly. Now
he went up boldly.</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Millington," he said gaily, "what about you
coming with me tonight to a nice little dinner
somewhere"&mdash;he didn't mention the Semiris for he wanted
that to be a surprise to her&mdash;"and afterwards to see
'Purple Passion' at the Princess. I think you'd enjoy the
evening. Will you come?"</p>

<p>Miss Millington regarded him haughtily. The "perfumery" was
always a cut above the "manchester," and apart from that, she
didn't consider Bert to be too strongly financial. When she came
across him at the beaches, as she occasionally did, she noticed
he was always wearing the same old shabby blazer.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said coldly, "but I have another
engagement."</p>

<p>Bert flushed hotly. The snub was so obvious and she had
spoken so loudly that assistants at other counters had heard. He
grinned uncomfortably and was going away as quickly as he could,
when an eager voice hailed him from the counter adjoining the
perfumery one. "Now, why don't you ask me, Mr. Bostock?" it
called out laughingly. "I'll come with the greatest of
pleasure."</p>

<p>He turned to see who had spoken and saw it was little Kitty
Clover, in the gloves. She was small, but undeniably pretty,
with soft brown eyes. He knew her very slightly, and, hitherto,
had always thought her very shy.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it, Miss Clover?" he laughed back. He
pretended to feel in his pocket for an imaginary piece of paper.
"Well, you are down on my list anyhow, but I forget the exact
order." He nodded smilingly. "Still, as you've put in your claim
first, you shall come if you'd like to."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Bostock," replied Kitty, now casting down her
eyes. "I'm sure I shall enjoy it immensely. I've been longing to
see 'Purple Passion,' but hadn't found the right person yet to
take me."</p>

<p>Bert was quite thrilled at her saying "the right person." At
any rate she realised coming with him was not like going with
anyone who asked her. "Then it's 6.50 tonight at the Beehive
corner," he said, "and, please, don't be late. Mr. Packer's
bringing his young lady and it'll be a party of four." He nodded
smilingly. "And you look extra nice, Miss Clover, as I'm booking
a table for dinner at the Semiris. It's my birthday today, and
I've had a good wad of notes sent me."</p>

<p>Kitty Clover looked all excitement, but Miss Millington, very
disdainful. All the same, however, deep down, the latter young
lady was rather wishing she hadn't been so hasty in her refusal.
She ought to have enquired where Bert was intending to go for
the meal first.</p>

<p>When Bert had gone she called across to Kitty. "Don't you be
so sure about the Semiris, my dear. Very likely it'll only be
coffee and sandwiches at some café."</p>

<p>Kitty did not seem downcast, which attitude of mind turned
out to be a sensible one, as towards five o'clock it was
definitely known to the assistants all through the big store
that Bert Bostock had got Miss Pimpkins at the stamp counter to
ring up the Semiris and book four seats for dinner that evening.
It was rumored, too, a wealthy aunt who kept a fish and chips
shop in Port Pirie had sent him £50 for his birthday.</p>

<p>Looking back in after years, young Bert always regarded that
evening as one of the happiest of his life. To begin with, the
dinner at the Semiris had been an epicurean feast, and as the
good wine had coursed through his veins&mdash;they had had a
bottle of champagne at fifteen and six the bottle&mdash;he had
felt the equal and, indeed, almost the superior of any one in
the big dining-room.</p>

<p>It was the first time any of them had been to an expensive
hotel (the dinner had cost 7/6 each), and it was quite true
there had been one very awkward moment when the bowing waiter
had presented the menu all in French. However, at Kitty's
whispered injunction, after ordering clear soup for them all,
Bert had waved him away, saying they would consider what they
would have next.</p>

<p>Then Kitty had turned out to be a veritable tower of
strength, for, five and twenty years back, her mother had been a
maid in a nobleman's service in England, and from her she had
picked up the meanings of quite a lot of things in French. So
she knew that "merlans a la francais" was only fried whiting,
that "tournedos aux champignons" must mean beef fillet and
mushrooms, that "veau" was veal; "poulet" chicken and "canape"
duck.</p>

<p>So, like an experienced navigator she steered them through
the menu, until at last they came safe into harbor with a
mouthful of homely Welsh rarebit. Bert was delighted with her
for, apart from her triumph over the menu, she looked so
refreshingly pretty and sweet. Once, during the meal he felt
gently for her foot with his, and only desisted from pressing
much harder when she whispered, "Be careful, dear boy, these
stockings are the only ones I've got to match this dress."</p>

<p>He was thrilled with the confidence, and thrilled, even more,
when later, in the darkness of "Purple Passion," she snuggled
very close to him and let him hold her little shaking hand at an
exciting moment in the picture when the villain's revolver was
going bang, bang, bang, all over the place. It came to him then,
as in a flash of intuition, that perhaps Fate had destined him
to be her protector for ever and a day. To blazes with Miss
Millington and all her type, he thought!</p>

<p>Percy's girl had turned out to be very charming, too, and she
and Kitty had got on like a house on fire. It was discovered
they lived close to each other. So the two young fellows saw
them home together across the parklands, and as Percy, of
course, kissed his girl good-night, Bert wanted to follow suit
with Kitty. The latter was sweetly shy at first, but, after a
moment, put up her lips and allowed the kiss to be a very nice
one.</p>

<p>The next day nothing of much event took place to the two
friends. They appeared much quieter and exchanged no more broad
grins and sly digs in the ribs. Indeed, it was as if some great
responsibility had flung its heavy mantle over them and sobered
them down. Kitty and Bert, however, managed to give each other a
few tender glances and the latter received a hurriedly whispered
invitation to come home to tea the following evening and meet
Kitty's mother. He had already learnt she was a widow and Kitty
her only child.</p>

<p>But, if of that day there be nothing to record, it is quite
different of the next. It began with more whispered conversation
directly Bert and Percy met at the store, accompanied by many
smiles and nods; the grins and rib-diggings, however, were not
resumed. Things had proceeded long beyond that stage and
apparently some great crisis was near. The two friends had
schemed to go out to dinner at the same time and, accordingly,
five minutes past twelve found them in King William street upon
the steps of the stately portals of the South Australian
Bank.</p>

<p>"We're right every time in coming here," said Bert
confidently. "My knowing old Bellingham will make everything
easy. He'll trust me, for all his eight years as our
churchwarden he's been having an eyeful of me singing in the
choir. Come on, old man, we won't see anyone lower than
him."</p>

<p>So, after considerable frowning on the part of minor officers
of the bank, they were ushered into the manager's presence.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said Bert, gulping down a lump in his
throat; "you remember me? Well, this is Mr. Percy Packer, who
works with me at Dogberry &amp; Jones's. We want to open two
separate accounts."</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said the manager. His eyebrows went up a little.
"What with?"</p>

<p>"This!" said Bert, repressing a grin of triumph, and he
handed him a small, thin piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Ah, a lottery ticket!" exclaimed the manager. He frowned.
"You've been gambling!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," exclaimed Bert quickly, "at least, not
exactly!" He coughed. "Most of this money you see goes to
support the hospitals."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's better," nodded the manager. He looked
interested. "And you've drawn a prize! How much?"</p>

<p>Bert could just manage to get out his words. "£20,000, sir.
Here's the result slip. It only came this morning. See our
number, 776655, has got the first prize."</p>

<p>Mr. Bellingham frowned again, stared hard, compared the
numbers, and tut-tutted several times.</p>

<p>"All right, young gentlemen," he said at last, rising to his
feet. "We'll collect this money for you, and if we use the air
mail and the 'phone you'll be credited with the money in about
two days' time. Good-bye, and if you take my advice, you'll
clear out for a little holiday. It is sure to become known and
then"&mdash;he smiled a grim smile&mdash;"you'll be astounded at
the number of friends you've got."</p>

<p>The secret was kept from everyone for three days and neither
Kitty nor Percy's young lady were told. Losing no time, Bert had
asked Kitty to be his wife that evening when he had gone to her
home to be introduced to her mother. Of all places, the proposal
had been made in the tram, and Kitty had blushed so prettily
that an elderly gentleman opposite had been carried quite half a
mile beyond his destination, and been made by the conductor to
pay an other tuppence in consequence.</p>

<p>Kitty had mouthed a 'yes', above the rattle of the tram, but
the first affianced kiss had not passed between them until they
were in the front garden of Kitty's home. Bert and the mother
had been very pleased with each other.</p>

<p>When, at last, the money had arrived at the bank and the two
young fellows had been provided with cheque books, they resolved
to give notice to their employers. Bert went in first to see Mr.
Dogberry and the old man received him with a scowl.</p>

<p>"What is it you want, Bostock?" he asked irritably. "I'm very
busy." Bert said he had come to give notice and, upon being
asked testily to which other firm he was going, replied he was
intending in future to lead an outdoor life and was going on the
land.</p>

<p>"Then are you going to buy some extensive property?" asked
Mr. Dogberry with heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Not to start off with, sir," replied Bert smilingly. "I
shall go out as a farmhand, first, to learn everything before I
invest any of my money."</p>

<p>"Oh, and have you much money to invest, may I ask?" enquired
Mr. Dogberry with a grin and chilling smile.</p>

<p>Bert, certain that the story of their good fortune was bound
to become known sooner or later, saw no reason for keeping
anything back, and so told his employer how he and Percy Packer
had come to win £20,000.</p>

<p>The old man nearly jumped out of his chair. "£10,000 each!"
he gasped. "Why, it's a fortune!" He could hardly get his
breath. "Does everybody know?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not yet," smiled Bert, pretending a great respect,
"you're the first one to hear about it. We thought it best to
tell you before anyone else."</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right," nodded his employer, "the proper
thing to do!" A thought struck him and his eyes, opened very
wide. "But I say, what a splendid advertisement it should be for
the firm! A paragraph in the newspaper, 'Two young gentlemen in
the Manchester department of Dogberry and Jones win £20,000'!"
He raised his voice excitedly. "Why, everyone will be talking
about us!"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," smiled Bert. "A little bit out of the
ordinary, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly it is!" nodded Mr. Dogberry. He became quite
excited. "But Mr. Bostock"&mdash;he called him Mr. now:&mdash;"I
must ask you as a favor not to leave us straightaway. At any
rate stay on for a few weeks, and everyone will be coming to
have a look at you." He rubbed his hands together. "Yes, I'll
get that paragraph in at once." His eyes sparkled. "'Smart young
salesmen&mdash;so keen upon their work&mdash;most reluctant to
give it up notwithstanding the turn of Fortune's wheel&mdash;the
lure of selling superfine sheets and blankets still holds
them&mdash;their lives so happy that&mdash;&mdash;'" but an idea
came to him and he demanded sharply, "You're not married, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Bert smilingly, "but I soon shall be. I'm
engaged to your Miss Clover in the gloves."</p>

<p>Mr. Dogberry raised his hand excitedly. "Better and better
still! We'll make the paragraph more interesting than ever.
'Young salesman in the Manchester engaged to lovely girl in the
gloves! Fortune showering her favors upon him!'" His hands
shook. "Oh, Mr. Bostock, I implore that neither you nor Miss
Clover leave us for a while. And the same with that splendid
young Mr. Packer. The Manchester and the glove departments will
have record sales."</p>

<p>So Percy Packer and Kitty Clover being called in, it ended in
them all agreeing to remain on with the firm for three weeks.
The two friends rather enjoyed the interest they excited in
their customers, but were most annoyed by one newspaper
referring to them as "two dashing young haberdashers." Everyone
in drapery circles knows that the Manchester department is miles
above the lowly haberdashery one.</p>

<p>A week after they had left the business, Bert and Kitty were
married. The night before Kitty had a short but very serious
conversation with her mother. "You know, mum," she said, "I've
grown really very fond of Bert. He's a dear boy, and I'll do my
very best to make him a good wife." She looked troubled. "But I
don't like marrying him with this dreadful secret on my mind.
How awful if he found it out!"</p>

<p>"But he won't find it out," nodded her mother confidently.
"Your aunty knows when to hold her tongue, and she'll never say
a word. Don't you worry there."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't seem fair, mum," protested Kitty. "I feel I
ought to tell him."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," exclaimed her mother. "A girl's secrets are her
own until she's married, and if she blabs them out she always
regrets it. No. You say nothing and you'll never be sorry for
it."</p>

<p>Kitty was over-ruled and did as her mother bade her. So Bert
never learnt she had known from the very beginning that he had
won that £10,000, and, accordingly, had deliberately set her cap
to get him.</p>

<p>It had come about in this way. Her aunty was an agent for
Pusher's patent carpet sweepers, and upon the morning when Percy
was phoning Bert about their having drawn the winning lottery
ticket, it happened she had been making an early call upon the
former's landlady to collect an installment on the sweeper she
had sold her. Standing waiting in the hall, she had overheard
everything Percy had said, and, chancing to meet Kitty in the
street a few minutes later, had passed on the news to her.</p>

<p>So Kitty had been an artful little puss, but who will hold
that against her? Are not all girls by nature artful, and as she
went on to make Bert a splendid little wife, surely no one will
blame her, for acting as she did. No one, perhaps, except the
one-time perfumery young lady, Miss Millington. Still, as she
married a well-to-do butcher, and in almost record time
presented him with three little butchers to carry on the line,
certainly she had no cause to be envious.</p>

<p>She was happy, too, in her oft repeated boast that she had
once given the cold shoulder to an ardent admirer who had just
come in for £10,000. She did not mention, however, that at the
time she had known nothing about his possessing so much
money.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1942-09-03"></a>REJUVENATION</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
3 September 1942</h3>

<p class="first">MATHEW PONTING BROWN lived a very humdrum life,
and no one could have called it a happy one. At forty he was an
old man with an habitual worried expression upon his face. He
was short and slight of figure, his hair was greying, and he
actually sported whiskers. As long as anyone had known him it
was said he had always worn the same suit. That was not,
however, true, for he bought a new one every four or five years.
Still, as each new suit was the exact copy of the one before it
in style, cut and color, it can easily be understood how the
legend of the eternal durability of his clothes arose.</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, living in lodgings in an unpretentious
street in North Adelaide, and his way of life was the same from
one year's end to another. A ledger clerk at Boomer and Hunt's,
he had been with the firm since he was seventeen, and was
considered steady and trustworthy. Of very limited intelligence,
however, he had never risen from a very subordinate position. By
his fellow clerks and the employees of the firm, generally, he
was called "Doormat," and he never seemed to resent the implied
contempt in the nickname.</p>

<p>He had no vices and no hobby. He didn't drink, he didn't
smoke, he never went to races, and he had never been known to
address any member of the other sex by her Christian name. Every
Sunday, morning and evening, he attended a little church of some
queer sect in a little bye-lane near Ovingham, but he never was
seen to open his mouth there, and his interest in the affairs of
the church appeared to end when he had come out of its doors.
So, with no relations or friends, his surroundings were as
lonely as possibly could be, and he slunk through life a very
ghost of a man, interested in no one and with no one interested
in him.</p>

<p>With his habits very simple, he was not troubled with any
form of ill-health until well into his fortieth year. Then he
began to suffer from what for a long while he thought was only
indigestion. He did not take much notice of it at first but, the
discomfort in the pit of his stomach continuing and getting no
better, he suddenly started worrying that, perhaps, some
dreadful disease might be setting in. Reading his morning paper
from end to end, as he did every day, from its advertisement
columns he had acquired a most comprehensive knowledge of the
many ills which many quack doctors were anxious to treat, and so
was mentally ripe for the suggestion of almost any kind of
affliction.</p>

<p>Getting thoroughly frightened at last, he decided to see a
doctor, but, knowing none, he could not make up his mind which
particular one to choose. Then, remembering the advertisement of
a Chinaman which had often caught his eye, after a lot of
thinking, he came to the conclusion he could not do better than
go to him.</p>

<p>The Chinaman was a Wei Hung Ling, who lived in a little
bye-street off King William road. To Mathew's simple mind it seemed
he must be a man of great knowledge, ministering, as he was
able, according to his advertisements, to almost all the
ailments human nature was prone to.</p>

<p>He described himself as a natural healer, specialising in
eyes, nose, throat, heart, lungs, and other less romantic parts
of the human body. Apart from this extensive repertoire, the
Chinaman was also a psychologist, a hypnotist, and a vocational
adviser. His advertisement, moreover, suggested he might be
consulted about the stars. Altogether Mathew thought he would be
quite safe in consulting him, and, accordingly, one afternoon,
upon leaving Boomer and Hunt's, he made his way to the
Chinaman's place of practice.</p>

<p>Now, whatever may have been the attainments of this Wei Hung
Ling in the healing art, he was certainly a pretty shrewd judge
of human nature, for directly he clapped eyes on the nervous,
shrinking Mathew Brown, he saw possibilities of good profit. If
rightly handled, the little chap was just the very kind to be
kept hanging about for years.</p>

<p>Swallowing hard in his nervousness, Mathew described his
symptoms, and, asking many questions about his occupation and
mode of life, short of exactly finding out what his salary was a
week, the Chinaman was speedily in possession of nearly all
there was to learn about his new patient. Then he made him
partly undress, and having prodded his stomach very hard and
listened to its rumblings through a stethoscope, he tut-tutted
very gravely many times. Finally he gave his verdict.</p>

<p>It was a good thing he had come to him, he told Mathew
solemnly, for he had come only just in time. The pain and
discomfort he had suffered from were far more than an ordinary
indigestion. They were the first stage of a very serious
trouble. Still, with patience and extended treatment, he was
most hopeful everything would come all right in the end.</p>

<p>Mathew must have X-ray treatment, the galvanic battery and
massage, as well as medicines. He must come to be treated three
times a week. As to fees, Ling couldn't say how much it would
cost, but with such treatments it was, of course, customary to
pay something on account. Mathew was thoroughly frightened, and
with no demur parted with five one pound notes on account. The
treatment was started at once with a dose of the battery, which
made him feel rather faint and sick. Indeed, he looked so white
and shaky, that the Chinaman produced a good-sized tumbler full
of port and insisted upon his drinking it. Never having taken
alcohol before, Mathew responded at once to the heavy wine, and,
except for rather wobbly legs, expressed himself as feeling much
better. Finally, Ling bowed him out with a little box of
evil-looking pills and the strict injunction he was to return
in two days' time.</p>

<p>Mathew walked slowly down King William road towards the stop,
where he would pick up a North Adelaide tram. He had to walk
slowly, because not only could he not trust his legs over-much,
but also there was a blurred mist before his eyes. However, he
soon reached the stop, and was crossing over to the safety zone
when everything seemed to go black and he felt faint again. It
was only for a few seconds, and then he felt all right. His tram
arriving, he mounted the step and sank gratefully into a seat.
Really, he told himself, that Chinaman's medicine had been very
strong. He had no idea it was just ordinary port wine he had
been given.</p>

<p>That night, according to instructions, he took two pills and
two more the next morning. He felt astonished with the effect
they had on him. It was not only that they took away the pain in
his stomach, but they gave him also such a feeling of well-being.
He felt he was treading upon air and was so light-hearted, too.
Passing out through the garden of the house where
he lodged, he plucked one of his landlady's prize rosebuds,
strangely enough not caring whether she saw him or not. He knew
she would be very angry if she did, as she was showing a bouquet
of roses at a local flower show the following week.</p>

<p>Arriving early at the office, he almost ran into one of the
other clerks, pretty little Dolly Thompson, in the passage. They
were the first to arrive. "Now then, Doormat, dear," she called
out gaily, "where are you going? But how nice you smell! Who on
earth gave you that dinky little rose?"</p>

<p>"I acquired it by conquest, pretty one," replied Mathew
grandly, and it seemed to him it was some other person speaking.
"In other words, I stole it from my landlady's garden."</p>

<p>"You wicked man," exclaimed the girl disgustedly, "give it to
me at once," and then, when he had smilingly handed it over and
she was busy arranging it in her dress, he bent over and gave
her a resounding kiss as near to her mouth as he could get.</p>

<p>"You little beast, Doormat!" she exclaimed, pushing him away
indignantly. "How dare you do that? Why, I'm almost inclined to
scratch your eyes out, you wretch!"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, you're not," he retorted firmly. "And you'll
say nothing about it either, and then I'll buy you a box of
chocolates."</p>

<p>"A shilling one?" she queried scornfully.</p>

<p>"No, a five shilling one." And again it seemed to him someone
else was speaking, as he added importantly, "Don't tell anyone,
but I've come in for a lot of money. My old aunt died last week
and left me a few hundred."</p>

<p>"Really?" asked the girl with her eyes opened very wide.
"Then buy yourself some new clothes at once, and get your hair
cut, too. It's the way you dress and those awful whiskers you've
got that make you look such an old corpse." She pretended to
look coy. "Why, I've let men much older than you take me out,
when they dressed properly and looked decent."</p>

<p>Mathew had his hair cut that very day, and at the same time
was measured for a suit of clothes by one of the best tailors in
Adelaide. He had plenty of money, for he had saved more than
£400.</p>

<p>When on the evening of the following day he kept his
appointment with the Chinaman, and told him delightedly how much
better he felt. "My indigestion is all gone, and I feel quite
different all round." He laughed. "Why, I even see now when a
girl's good-looking or not, and I haven't noticed that for
years. Those pills of yours must be very strong."</p>

<p>Wei Hung Ling nodded. "Yes, they are restoring your vital
energy and that's what I meant them to do." He smiled a cunning
smile. "But it is not only the pills which are making you feel
so much better." He fixed Mathew intently with his eyes and
added very solemnly, "You didn't know, did you, that I had
hypnotised you! Well, I had, and I had willed you should become
young again." He spoke as one with great authority. "You do as I
tell you and in six months I will have taken twenty years off
your life."</p>

<p>Mathew was thrilled and, at the Chinaman's suggestion, so
that there should be no slipping back, paid down a further two
pounds for pills of an even stronger nature.</p>

<p>And in the months which followed, although he was being well
and consistently milked by Wei Hung Ling, he never for one
moment regretted having gone to him. His whole life was altered
in a most extraordinary degree. He had become sharp and quick,
where before he had been dull and slow, and, indeed, was now so
capable in everything he undertook, that he soon found he was
being given responsible duties, with his salary being raised
accordingly.</p>

<p>After working hours, too, everything was different. He took
Dolly Thompson out quite a lot, and both his kisses and his
presents were now accepted as a matter of course. Indeed, the
office was expecting that an engagement would be announced any
day. Mathew, however, was taking his time there. Appetite had
grown with eating and, although very taken with the charms of
the fascinating little Dolly, he had several other little
flirtations in hand at the same time. He had moved to a good-class
guest home and a lively young widow there was beginning to
regard him as her private property. Also, he was sweet on a girl
in a lawyer's office. Her name was Penelope and she had a good
eye for the main chance.</p>

<p>And not only was Mathew prospering in his work and his love
affairs, but he was also most fortunate in other ways. Attending
the local race meetings and knowing nothing whatsoever about
horses, time after time he made quite useful sums of money by
backing certain animals, either because he liked their names, or
else because the numbers on their saddle-cloths coincided with
those which he had cause to remember for some particular reason,
quite unconnected with racing.</p>

<p>One afternoon, for instance, he had a pound on a horse
because its number was 20 and he had suddenly remembered the
Chinaman had said he would take that number of years off his
life. The horse won and paid £185 10/ in the totalisator.</p>

<p>Splashing his money about as he now did, everyone seemed to
want to be friendly with him and, going out quite a lot, he was
always meeting people, anxious to share in his good fortune.
Strangely enough, however, he had developed a great shrewdness
of character and always managed to avoid the pitfalls which were
being set for him. He flattered himself he could pick out the
go-getters from the honest ones every time.</p>

<p>Instead of the little packet of measly sandwiches and the
glass of milk which in the days gone by consisted of his lunch,
he now made a substantial meal at a good-class café, and sitting
always at the same table, got to know a young fellow who
generally came to sit opposite to him.</p>

<p>Just nodding casually at each other, at first, it was some
weeks before they began to talk of themselves, and then Mathew
learnt his new acquaintance was a clerk in a lawyer's office,
was twenty-six years of age, and half engaged to a very pretty
girl, but had very poor prospects of being able to get married.
He was always hoping, however, that one day some great happening
would avalanche into his life, and everything would be quite
different. He was a great believer in Fate.</p>

<p>"We can't help ourselves," he said. "We're running in a
groove, and everything we say or do has been arranged years and
years before we were born, to fit in with the lives of other
people."</p>

<p>"Then why was it fated," smiled Mathew, "that I should come
and sit down at your table."</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied the young fellow. He smiled, "Perhaps
it was to teach me not to take so much salt. It was you who told
me about it first, and I've learnt since then it makes your
arteries grow hard as you get old." He nodded. "So, perhaps,
just from this chance meeting with you, I may live ten or
fifteen years longer than I should have done if it hadn't
happened."</p>

<p>Mathew nodded back, feeling quite a thrill at the important
part he might be playing in this boy's destiny.</p>

<p>One lunch-time the boy arrived looking very preoccupied, and
after a long silence said earnestly:&mdash; "Look here, Mr.
Brown, do you ever speculate? Do you ever take a risk?"</p>

<p>Mathew laughed. "I'm middle-aged with a bit of dough, and if
I take a girl to the pictures and squeeze her hand in the dark,
why, it's always on the cards that she'll be thinking I ought to
mean business and start to sue me for breach of promise the next
morning." He seemed very amused. "Yes, I'm accustomed to take
risks."</p>

<p>The young man laughed back. "I didn't mean in that way. I
meant do you ever speculate in stocks and shares?"</p>

<p>Mathew shook his head. "Don't know enough about them." He was
anxious. "But what makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because," said the young man solemnly, "I'm pretty certain
I've got some information about a certain gold-mine which may
send the shares up from the few pence they are now to as many
shillings, or, perhaps, even pounds. Oh, yes, I know a bit about
gold shares. My Dad lost all his money in them and that's why
we're so deuced poor today."</p>

<p>Mathew expressed his interest, and having promised the young
man profound secrecy, the latter went on. "Listen, last month
the Silver Moon people took over another gold mining property, a
badly worked mine which so far has done no good, and everyone
was very curious why they did it, for they are known as a very
shrewd lot. Their shares now stand at seven pence."</p>

<p>"Seven pence!" exclaimed Mathew. "Surely that's not much for
a share in a gold mine."</p>

<p>"Often too much," smiled the young man. He went on. "Now here
comes the funny business. Next door to us lives a chap called
Entwhistle, a retired mining engineer. He's really given up
active work now, but sometimes he's still consulted because he's
supposed to know more about gold mining than any man in
Australia. People don't go to him often, because he charges a
deuced big fee. Well, yesterday, he received a telegram, and,
because that storm we had has flattened all the telephone posts
in our road, the wire was delivered by hand, with the boy, as
usual, waiting to know if there was any answer."</p>

<p>The young man spoke very solemnly. "Well, here Fate steps in.
I was in our garden when Entwhistle came out of his front door
to give the boy the reply to the telegram and as the old man is
very deaf he shouted what the words were, 'Halliday, Silver
Moon, Kalgoorlie,' he bawled, 'Accept terms&mdash;coming by
plane tomorrow, Entwhistle.'"</p>

<p>"Then what does it all mean?" frowned Mathew.</p>

<p>"That they think they've struck it rich," was the instant
reply, "and they want Entwhistle to assure them it's worth while
going to the expense of putting down new machinery." He nodded,
"And I'll bet they paid him a huge sum. He's always vowed he'd
never set foot in a plane under five hundred guineas."</p>

<p>"And what do you think'll happen?" asked Mathew.</p>

<p>"The shares'll go up at once the moment it leaks out that
Entwhistle's been called in. I shouldn't wonder if they don't go
up tuppence or threepence this afternoon."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Mathew said with decision.
"Look here, my boy, I'll go in with you. We'll buy a thousand
shares each, at once, straight-away within the hour."</p>

<p>The young fellow got very red. "Can't do it, sir," he said.
"I've no spare cash."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll lend it to you," nodded Mathew. "No, that's all
right. It'll be a little excitement for us whatever happens. Now
how do you set about getting these shares."</p>

<p>So it ended in the two hurriedly making their way to a
stockbroker the young man knew. But the stockbroker was out and
to fill in the few minutes before he returned, they went into a
hotel and had some drinks. Under the influence of two sloe gins,
Mathew took a most rosy view of everything and it ended in him
buying two thousand shares for himself and one for his friend.
They cost him, with commission, a little over £100.</p>

<p>Nothing happened for three days, and then the boy came
rushing excitedly into the café at lunch time to give the
startling information that not an hour previously Silver Moons
had jumped from eightpence to two shillings.</p>

<p>"It's leaked out that Entwhistle was over there," he
whispered hoarsely, "and some say he's given them a marvellous
report."</p>

<p>And exactly what report the mining expert had given Mathew
never knew. All that interested him was that he found himself
being carried violently forward in the crest of a tremendous
boom in Silver Moons. The shares soared and soared, from two
shillings to five, from five shillings to a pound and then up,
up, up until seventy odd shillings was reached. Then, upon the
advice of his friend, Mathew sold out, finding himself in the
possession of more than £7,000.</p>

<p>Keeping the whole matter to himself for a couple of weeks, he
at last went to the heads of the firm and told them what had
happened. They were aghast, but, their first surprise over,
regarded him with great respect.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Mr. Brown," said old Boomer, "you do astonish
us. Certainly, of late, you've given us good reason for surprise
in many directions, but we didn't think you had as much go in
you as this." He frowned. "And now, of course, I suppose you
will be leaving us. You will want to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," broke in Mr. Hunt with a significant look at his
partner, "decide nothing precipitately, Mr. Brown." He coughed.
"Don't say anything for a few days, and we may have a suggestion
to make to you." He smiled. "You know we are both older than we
used to be, and don't want to go on working for ever."</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mathew's love affairs were becoming rather
involved, and it seemed he was in the way of getting himself
into trouble. He was inclined to think something of his good
fortune must somehow have leaked out, as all his lady loves were
most actively pushing their claims. He was practically engaged
to Dolly Thompson on the quiet; he had been taking the little
widow out and buying her expensive presents, and he spent as
much time as he could with Penelope of the lawyer's office, when
he could safely get away from the other two.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, his deceit did not worry him in the least.
Indeed, he never gave it a thought, taking all his love
adventures as the natural result of the rejuvenation Wei Hung
Ling had promised him. He was free of the Chinaman now, and that
did not trouble him either. A month back he had seen in the
newspapers that the premises off King William road had been
raided, and Ling committed for trial for trafficking in
forbidden drugs.</p>

<p>Late one night Mathew took counsel of himself in his bedroom.
Things had become very awkward, and a crisis was certainly
approaching. That afternoon the partners had announced to their
other employees that they were taking him into partnership, and
Dolly had at once triumphantly broadcast their engagement. Yet,
the previous evening after sitting with the widow on the
parklands, and overcome by her caresses and the fragrance of the
particular scent she had been using, he had asked her to marry
him. Also, that very morning he had lunched with Penelope at a
fashionable hotel, and snatched a passionate kiss from her in a
secluded corner of the lounge when no one else was by. He had
arranged, too, to spend the following Sunday with her at her
home.</p>

<p>He looked into the mirror and thoughtfully regarded the image
reflected there. He saw a distinguished, handsome man who did
not look a day older than 30; a man with a strong, clever face,
and calm, confident eyes.</p>

<p>"What a change from what I was six months ago!'' he nodded.
"Yes, it's exactly six months to day, on May 2nd, since I first
visited old Ling, and what a lot has happened in that time!" He
went on. "Sure, you ought to go a long way, Mathew, for nothing
now is beyond your grasp. A partner in an important business
firm, you must get on the city council. Then it will be only
another step to becoming the lord mayor. After that&mdash;who
knows? You may be Sir Mathew very soon.</p>

<p>He undressed himself and quickly got into bed. "I must get a
good sleep now. I have a busy day tomorrow. Dolly, Penelope and
Susan, how shall I manage them all?" but, his head touching the
pillow, his thoughts trailed away into nothingness and .... he
was asleep.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>One of the house surgeons of the Adelaide Hospital was
showing two interested elderly ladies over the new wing of the
building. As they entered a small ward, some nurses were putting
a screen round one of the beds.</p>

<p>"A patient just died?" whispered one of the ladies
sympathetically.</p>

<p>The house surgeon nodded. "We expected it. A bad accident
case! He hadn't a chance when they brought him in."</p>

<p>"How long ago, since it happened?"</p>

<p>The house surgeon considered. "Three days last Tuesday
evening, May 2nd, he was knocked down by a motor lorry in King
William road while waiting for a tram. His injuries were
shocking. Fractured base of the skull, five ribs broken and a
compound fracture of the thigh. But it was probably mostly his
own fault, as he reeked of port wine when he was picked up."</p>

<p>"Was he a young man?"</p>

<p>"No, about forty, so his firm told us. He was a clerk in a
soft-goods warehouse and, apparently, without any relations or
friends, as not a soul's been to see him since he was brought
in."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a dreadful death."</p>

<p>The house surgeon smiled. "The accident was dreadful, but the
dying wasn't. He's been chock full of morphia and, judging by
his talk, has had a lovely time. He won huge sums at the races
and made a fortune in a gold-mine. Also, he became the head
partner of his soft-goods firm. As for love affairs, why he had
sweethearts all over the place, Penelope, Dorothy, Susan, and it
seemed he was going to marry all of them."</p>

<p>"How shocking," murmured the other lady. "He must have been a
thoroughly bad man!"</p>

<p>The house surgeon shook his head. "No, I don't think so. He
was only just an ordinary man and in his dreams he let himself
go." He laughed. "His name was Mathew, but he was certainly no
saint."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1942-09-30"></a>A VOICE FROM THE DEAD</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
30 September 1942.</h3>

<p class="first">IT was quite late at night, and they had just
returned from a bridge party. The two of them were discussing
the people who had been present, as they were drinking a
nightcap cup of tea.</p>

<p>"And then Camilla Brendon," said Mrs. James, a lively little
woman, seemingly full of the joy of life, "isn't she smart and
hasn't she kept her good looks? Do you know, dear, she's turned
forty-two? Oh, yes, I know it for certain! We went to the same
school together and she's a year older than I, and I'm
forty-one."</p>

<p>"Well, she could have passed for thirty tonight," commented
the other. "Hasn't she got a clever face?"</p>

<p>"And she is clever, Lucy; the cleverest woman I know. She's
well read and highly intellectual. She's the president of our
Literary Society and none of the men can take her down."</p>

<p>"But her husband looks very ordinary. I mean he's not a bit
clever. I can't imagine her marrying a man like him."</p>

<p>"Neither can anyone else," commented Mrs. James, "but then
Ted Brendon's a dear old chap. As you say, he's not a bit
clever, but he's an ideal family man, and he just worships
Camilla and the children."</p>

<p>Lucy smiled. "Then, of course, she married him for money. I
remember old man Brendon left plenty when he died."</p>

<p>Her friend shook her head. "No, dear, you're wrong there.
Camilla never was that sort. Besides, she was doing journalistic
work then, and must have had quite a good salary." She looked
thoughtful. "No, Lucy, she didn't marry him for money and I'm
certain she didn't marry him for love. I rather think she
married him out of gratitude for his kindness to the man she'd
been engaged to before. That one died as the result of a
terrible accident when they were miles away from everywhere, and
Ted had nursed him and cared for him until he was dead."</p>

<p>"Then she had had a lover before her present husband!"
exclaimed Lucy. She nodded. "And I suppose she loved him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, passionately," replied Mrs. James with emphasis. She
smiled. "Under the mask of that proud and cold face of hers,
Camilla hides what is left of feelings of the deepest
passion.</p>

<p>"As a girl, as you can guess, she was very lovely, but no man
appealed to her until Ransom Hellingsby came into her life. Then
from an icicle she became the burning fiery furnace. I knew her
intimately then, and she confided in me more than she did in
anyone else. She just idolised this Ransom of hers."</p>

<p>"And what sort of man was he? An Adonis superman, with all
the virtues!"</p>

<p>Her friend sighed. "At any rate, she thought so. Oh, yes, he
was good-looking, right enough, and very clever, too. He was a
barrister, and everyone said he had a great future. He just
swept Camilla off her feet and she loved him with every nerve
and drop of blood in her."</p>

<p>"And he worshipped her in return?"</p>

<p>Mrs. James hesitated. "Yes and no. He couldn't help being
fond of her in a man's sort of way, for she was so lovely to
look at. Still, he'd been fond of many others before her, and,
even when he was engaged to Camilla, he's supposed to have had
other girl friends." She shook her head. "He wouldn't have made
her the husband Ted Brendon has." She nodded again. "There were
tales, too, that he drank."</p>

<p>"Well, what happened to him? You haven't told me."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was killed on a holiday! He and Ted Brendon and
Michael Barling, now His Honor Judge Barling, were away shooting
and fishing on Kangaroo Island, and in the wildest and most
desolate part, Ransom fell over a cliff and got terribly hurt.
His injuries were so bad, they daren't move him. Their car was
20 miles away, and, leaving Ted to look after him, Michael
started to tramp 20 miles to get help. He sprained his ankle on
the way, however, and it was two days before he was able to
direct the rescue party to where Ransom was lying. Ted had done
everything he could for him, but only a skilful surgeon could
have saved him, and he was dead when they arrived."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful tragedy!" exclaimed Lucy. "I wonder it
didn't kill Camilla."</p>

<p>"It almost did. She was heart-broken, and it was only to Ted
Brendon she could ever bring herself to talk about what had
happened. He often saw her, and, as Ransom's greatest friend, I
suppose she thought he was all of Ransom that was left to her.
At any rate, she must have been so grateful to him for his
devotion to her dead Ransom and become so accustomed to him,
that in the end she thought she could put up with him always.
She could see, as everyone else did, that he was desperately in
love with her. So two years later she married him."</p>

<p>"Is she happy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I think so&mdash;in a way. She's got two boys, the
elder is 17, and a lovely girl of 15, and everything in the way
of money she could want. Still, although it's more than 20 years
ago, I think she still lives a bit in the past. When no one's
watching her, her face in repose is sad."</p>

<p>The next morning the object of their conversation was seated
alone in the breakfast room of her beautiful and well-appointed
house. She had just seen her husband off in his car, but had
returned to the table to finish her cup of coffee and glance
through the morning newspaper.</p>

<p>As her old school friend had stated, she was still, at 42, a
very handsome woman. She was well and tastefully dressed, and
everything about her spoke of the woman of refinement. She had a
good profile and perfect complexion. Her eyes were large and of
a deep blue. She held herself gracefully and her general poise
was as of one who was very sure of herself.</p>

<p>It happened to be the 18th anniversary of her wedding, and
she smiled faintly as she thought of the warm good-bye her
husband had just given her.</p>

<p>Dear old Ted, she had known him since she was a little child,
but had never given it a thought that he had been in love with
her in those far-off years when she was only a long-legged girl
just out of pigtails!</p>

<p>But then Ted had always been shy, and one to keep himself in
the background. Even all that time after her great trouble he
would have never dared to speak of his feelings for her if she
hadn't taken pity on him and met him three parts of the way.</p>

<p>Well, he had proved the kindest of husbands for her, and she
could not wish for anyone more considerate. He was so unselfish,
too, and without a trace of jealousy. He had not minded in the
least when she had asked if their first little one could be
called Ransom, whereas most men would not have liked it that
their son should be named after an old lover of their wife's,
but he had just smiled and bowed his head in sorrowful memory,
she had known, for the dead. Of course, he had loved Ransom,
too. David and Jonathan they had been called at school, and in
their college life, later, they had been inseparable.</p>

<p>Then that awful tragedy when Ransom had been killed! What
torture it had been for Ted to give her all the ghastly details.
But she had insisted she should know all at once, so that there
should never be anything more terrible to tell her.</p>

<p>Her thoughts wandered then to her children and her mother's
heart warmed within her. What a splendid man her elder son
Ransom the second was going to be! Strong, masterful, and
capable as the other Ransom had been. Indeed, she always liked
to think he was not unlike him in appearance, too. And that must
be, so her secret thoughts ran, because her first lovers image
had remained so vivid in her mind.</p>

<p>Then her daughter, 15, only two years younger than Ransom,
how lovely she was, and what a sweet disposition was hers. She
had her father's ways, and what a treasure she would be for some
man one day! She was&mdash;but her thoughts were interrupted by
the entrance of the maid with the letters.</p>

<p>She ran through them carelessly, and then her face brightened
as she saw one in the handwriting of her one-time lover's
sister. She had always liked old Miss Hellingsby, who had been
ten years older than Ransom.</p>

<p>The letter was a thick one in a big envelope, and, opening
it, she found another envelope wrapped round with a piece of
white paper, upon which was written, "Do not open this until you
have read my letter." Miss Hellingsby's letter read:&mdash;</p>

<br> <p style="margin-left:5%">

"Dearest Camilla&mdash;I was clearing out an old cupboard
yesterday and came across a jacket of poor Ransom's. It was the
spare one he must have taken with him on that dreadful holiday.
As I was handling it, I felt something which had slipped down in
the lining. It was this letter from him to you, which I now
enclose. Of course, I have not opened it, and at first was
inclined to burn it. But, then, I realised it really belonged to
you, and so send it along.<br><br>

Your affectionate friend,<br><br>

Clare Hellingsby."</p>

<br>

<p>Camilla caught her breath, and, even after all those years,
her heart beat much quicker. She opened the enclosed letter with
trembling fingers, and her eyes wonderingly devoured what was
written. It was dated Thursday, December 29. "The day before the
accident," she murmured. "It was on the Friday he fell over that
awful cliff."</p>

<p>After a few lines of endearment, and his declaring he was
quite well, except for an occasional bout of neuralgia which
bothered him a little, she came to a part which made her face
blanch, and almost choked her as she breathed.</p> <br> <p
style="margin-left:5%">

"Now here's something very strange, sweetheart," she read, "and
I can't make it out. It sounds incredible, but something's
happened to Ted, and I believe that for some reason he has come
to hate me. Yesterday I had caught him several times looking
very queerly at me when he thought I wasn't watching, and last
night I half think he wanted me to do myself an injury.<br><br>

"It was like this. Our camp is in a hollow just behind a big
cliff, with a bit of a creek on the land side, where one can
often get a duck when they come over about dusk. Well, after tea
I went out by myself to try and pot some, and was in hiding
behind some bushes. Of course, I had got my gun loaded. Then
something, I don't know what, made me take the cartridges out
and have a squint down the barrels of the gun. Perhaps I thought
I hadn't cleaned them the previous day after we had been out
after quail. At any rate, to my horror, I found one of the
barrels was choked up hard with caked mud. Only one of them,
that was the funny part, but if I had fired the gun, then, good
God! I might have got my hand blown off or even worse than
that.<br><br>

"I knew the day before that the ground had been very muddy after
the rain, and I had certainly put down my gun once or twice, but
I couldn't credit the barrel having got in that state. Of
course, that Ted has really been looking at me queerly and that
he put the mud in the barrel of the gun may be all imagination,
and I only tell you so that when you write back you may tell me
what an ass I am. I have such great faith in your good sense.
Some days fishing boats come in close to the shore, and I may
get one to take this tomorrow."</p>

<br>

<p>The letter finished up with more endearing terms.</p>

<p>Camilla sat on with a white, set face. It was inconceivable,
but what if Ransom had been pushed over that cliff and had not
fallen over as had been made out?</p>

<p>When he had been killed there had been practically no enquiry
at all. The island sergeant of police had made his report, and
the coroner, to save himself trouble, everyone said, had not
thought it necessary to hold any inquest.</p>

<p>But Ted&mdash;&mdash;a murderer! It was incredible! Still,
who could fathom the secrets of a man's heart where the passion
for a woman was concerned? Had not history told over and over
again how the natures of the gentlest and most inoffensive of
men could harden and become brute-like when baulked in their
pursuit of one of the other sex. They, too, then had lost all
sense of conscience.</p>

<p>And Ted had been loving her all the time! He had told her so
and how miserable his life had been, believing as he did then,
that she could never be his!</p>

<p>Oh, how sorry she was she had been given that letter! Her
affection for her husband had never merged into real passion,
and she would loathe him now if she learnt he had had any part
in Ransom's death.</p>

<p>Again she told herself it was impossible, but she added she
could not let the matter rest there. No, she would go and see
Michael Barling, the judge, and get the truth out of him that
very day. He had been there with Ted when the accident had
occurred, and so she would spring the letter upon him, being
confident that, from the expression upon his face, she would be
able to make out whether her husband had been guilty or not. It
was vacation time, and the judge would probably be working in
his garden in the afternoon. He was a bachelor, and flowers were
the absorbing hobby of his life.</p>

<p>As she had expected, she found the judge at home, and he took
her at once into his study.</p>

<p>"Michael," she said solemnly, "I can trust you, can't I?
You'll always tell me the truth."</p>

<p>A distinguished looking man, with a keen, intellectual face
and calm grey eyes, he regarded her curiously. "Certainly,
Camilla," he replied, and he added, "there should surely have
been no need for you to ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Well, here's a letter of Ransom's," she went on quickly,
"and it was only given me this morning. His sister found it in
the lining of the spare jacket he took away with him when you
all went on that dreadful holiday." Her voice shook. "It is
dated the day before he died. Here it is. Yes, read it right
through and then you'll be sure it's his letter."</p>

<p>The judge took the letter from her with a calm impassive
face, but he was soon frowning heavily. A long silence followed,
for he read the letter twice before he looked up at her.</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly. "I don't know what to tell you,
Camilla," he said. He tapped the letter disdainfully. "But, of
course, what he suggests about Ted is all nonsense. All our guns
were liable to get muddied, and Ransom was notoriously careless
about his."</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean by saying you didn't know what to tell
me?" asked Camilla sharply. "Are you keeping anything back?" Her
voice shook. "Didn't Ransom die in the way it was given out?"
She almost broke down. "Did my husband push him over the
cliff?"</p>

<p>The judge's face was dark with indignation. "Don't be a fool,
Camilla, and don't give way to hysteria. How dare you think such
a thing about Ted?" He spoke scornfully. "I thought time had
made you into a sensible, level-headed woman, and
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you said just now you didn't know what you ought to tell
me," broke in Camilla tearfully, "and I thought you meant you
were keeping something back."</p>

<p>"And so I was," commented the judge sternly, "but now I see
I'll have to tell it you." He pointed to the letter he had given
back to her. "For that neuralgia he refers to there, Ransom had
been drinking heavily. He wasn't responsible for what he wrote,
and, to make no bones about it, the next day he was drunk when
he fell over that cliff."</p>

<p>Camilla covered her face with her hands. "Oh, but I can't
believe it," she choked. "Ransom was always such a particular
man. I'm sure he never drank too much."</p>

<p>"But he did," retorted the judge sharply. "He broke out
occasionally when he was away. It wasn't often, but then he was
as bad as anyone." He spoke regretfully. "I'm sorry, Cam, I had
to tell you this, but you forced me to. I couldn't let the very
faintest suspicion of anything rankle on in your mind."</p>

<p>"Then Ted wasn't near him when he fell over the cliff?" she
asked faintly.</p>

<p>"Half the length of this room away," replied the judge. "I
was much closer." He patted her kindly on the shoulder. "Look
here, little woman, go back home and be the very nicest wife in
the world to Ted. He's worth it, I tell you, every inch of
him."</p>

<p>She began to mop her eyes. "I know that, Michael. He's been
an ideal husband and father. I'll forget all about this letter,
and burn it directly I get home. I've been very foolish."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have," smiled the judge, "but don't wait until you
get home to burn this letter. Burn it straightaway in this
grate. Here, give it to me and I'll set a match to it. That's
right. There&mdash;it's all gone up in smoke," he raised his
finger warningly, "and now you never breathe a word to your
husband that you received it. Promise me, now. Good, you're a
sensible woman again!"</p>

<p>He saw her out of the house, and then, returning to his
study, sank back wearily into an armchair and wiped over his
forehead with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Whew, that was unpleasant," he murmured with a wry face,
"and may God forgive me for the lie!" He nodded. "Still, he was
drunk right enough two nights before, or else, with Ted present,
he'd have never let out about that other woman he was carrying
on with. The brute, going to be married within a month to an
innocent and lovely girl like Cam., and yet boasting about the
mistress he'd got! Gad, how Ted glared at him, the devoted Ted
who up to then had always regarded him as his hero! But with
Ted's secret adoration of Cam. Ransom's admission was sacrilege
of the vilest nature."</p>

<p>He sighed heavily. "Yes, I had to tell her that lie, or else
their two lives would have become one long drawn-out misery.
She'd have never forgiven Ted because, indirectly, of course,
everything was due to him. He certainly provoked the fight by
suddenly blurting out to Ransom what he thought of him. Still,
the fighting was perfectly fair, I saw to that, and there'd have
been no accident at all if Ransom hadn't staggered back too far
under that blow and lost his balance." He sighed again. "But it
was best for Cam that he was killed. He'd have made her a
shocking husband, and I don't wonder old Ted told me the other
day that he regretted nothing."</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the judge's eyes happening to rove round the
room, fell upon the ashes of the burnt letter in the grate and,
with a gesture as if of great annoyance, he strode over and
ground them to powder under his foot.</p>

<p>All at once, then, he started and stood stock still. His jaw
dropped and his forehead became all puckered up in a puzzled
frown. He stared into vacancy and held his breath as if he were
listening. But he was not listening&mdash;it was only that a
sudden thought had come to him, and for the moment he would not
give it expression.</p>

<p>"God, I had quite forgotten about that!" he exclaimed at
last. "What about the choked-up barrel of the gun? Men have been
killed by less than that."</p>

<p>With seeming reluctance he followed up the train of thought.
"Was Ransom purposely lying about it to prejudice Camilla
against Ted, in case Ted told her anything? He could tell by
Ted's manner what he thought of him. Or did Ted really block up
that barrel? Did he deliberately intend to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, I'll never ask him, anyhow.
Goaded by Ransom's treachery to Camilla, it would have been a
sort of wild justice, and with a man of Ted's kind and gentle
disposition"&mdash;he half smiled&mdash;"the wrath of the
sheep."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1943-04-29"></a>"BUGGY"</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
29 April 1943</h3>

<p class="first">HIS master and mistress called him Soda, but to
the children he was always known as Buggy, because when he had
come to them as a very small puppy there were crawlers in his
little coat which made him scratch a lot.</p>

<p>He was a little Scotty and picturesquely ugly with his huge
head, very short legs, and great, lumpy, heavy paws. Eyes, nose
and small body he was black as night all over. An aristocrat to
his claw tips, and a descendant of a long line of noble
ancestors, he carried his little tail stiffly upright in
defiance of all the world.</p>

<p>He was only a young dog and he lived in one of the suburbs of
a big city. Except for an occasional scamper outside with the
children, his little world was bounded by four high garden
walls, and there he carried on relentless war with everything
which flew, crept, crawled or ran. He was game as a pebble and,
as quick as lightning, his pounce was swift as the strike of a
snake. His scent, too, was keen as a razor's edge, and woe
betide any rodent who imagined he could hide away, even under
many feet of garden rubbish. Buggy's front paws would then work
like flails, untiring as a piston under full pressure, until he
had routed him out. A few yards of hectic rush would follow
before the unhappy rat or mouse was bitten, crunched and shaken
into that Valhalla where the spirits of all rodents go.</p>

<p>With birds he was less successful and rarely caught one, for
both his strategy and tactics were undeniably bad. He scorned
all ambushes or lying in wait and, instead, directly one had
alighted upon the lawn, would launch himself like an arrow upon
it, barking, however, so vociferously all the while that the
bird would have ample warning to fly and escape.</p>

<p>The one exception to his unceasing chase after birds was
Mickum, the magpie, and there experience had taught him to keep
well away from her spiteful beak and fiercely beating wings.
Once, when she had had her nest in one of the garden trees, she
had most strongly resented his interest in her two little
Mickums, and he never forgot the painful peck she had given him
on the side of his nose. After that he had left her sulkily
alone.</p>

<p>As with birds, with cats he had not much luck, for again he
was so noisy in his approach that they invariably had sufficient
time to climb back safely on to the wall or run up some friendly
tree. Still, he was known far and wide in catdom, and mother
cats were wont to warn their kittens it was most unlikely they
would ever grow to cathood if they played or hunted in the
garden of Number Seven.</p>

<p>So Buggy passed his days, feared by so many rats, mice, cats
and birds, and yet so much loved and petted by all the children
who came to know him. To all humans he was such a friendly
little animal.</p>

<p>When Buggy was just over a year old a great sorrow came into
his life, for his master moved with his family into a flat where
it was one of the ten commandments of the proprietor of the
building that no dogs were allowed.</p>

<p>So Buggy's master gave him to a friend who was a farmer far
away in the country, and one morning of most dreadful memory to
the little dog he was given a most unusual big breakfast of
underdone liver, his favorite dish, and, after much hugging and
petting by the moist-eyed children, was driven off in the lap of
the eldest girl to the railway station. There he was consigned
to the care of the guard of a country bound train, and tied up
in the brake-van.</p>

<p>He could not understand it and, a few minutes later, the
rumbling of the wheels and the jolting of the train filled his
little heart with terror. The guard, however, was a doggy man,
and between stations stroked him and talked to him quite a lot.
But the guard's voice was strange and his smell was different
from any Buggy was accustomed to and, in consequence, the
friendliness was not much appreciated. Buggy thought of the
garden of Number Seven, the mice who would be running unchecked
in the rubbish heap, and the big black cat from next door, who
would probably be insolently upon the wall, and his heart was
heavy that he was not there to put things right.</p>

<p>The day seemed endless, but at last when dusk was falling the
train drew up at a siding and Buggy was taken out on to the
platform. "Here's your new boss, old man," said the guard, "and
I'm sure he'll be kind to you."</p>

<p>He was given into the arms of a big man who smelt of earth
and a strange new smell which he was to learn later was that of
sheep. "Hullo, hullo," said the man, holding him up at arms'
length, "now what's going to be the good of you on a farm? Gosh,
what a little beggar! No, no, Soda, don't tremble like that. No
one's going to hurt you, little chap."</p>

<p>"Soda's not his name," said the guard. "The little girl who
kissed him good-bye called him Buggy."</p>

<p>"And a darned good name," laughed the man. "He's not much
bigger than a fair-sized bug himself."</p>

<p>After a very jolting ride in an old car, Buggy arrived at his
new home, and a young woman stroked him and cuddled him and put
him down in a little basket before a nice warm fire. He was
given a drink of milk and, according to instructions received, a
nice supper of cut up meat, gravy, potatoes and greens. As much
as possible he tried, as indeed he always did, to nose away the
greens, but there was too much delicious gravy on them and, in
the end, he licked the saucer clean.</p>

<p>Then he squatted before the fire, watching with sad and
melancholy eyes the man and his wife having their meal. From
their glances in his direction he could see they were talking
about him, but he was not interested, and his thoughts were only
of his lost home.</p>

<p>Still, there was one bright spot that evening when, suddenly,
he caught sight of an immense tabby cat stealing stealthily into
the room. For the moment he did not realise his good fortune,
but then he went after her like a bullet from a gun. However, he
slipped badly on the linoleum and before he could get to her she
had sprung on to the top of a high cupboard and was out of
reach. She spat fiercely and the hair on her back stood up like
wires.</p>

<p>"No, Buggy, darling," called out the woman reprovingly, "you
must never hurt old Pom-Pom. You must become great friends." But
the men roared with laughter and thought it a splendid joke.</p>

<p>Buggy was put to bed in his basket in a cupboard at the end
of the passage, with the door, however, left open so that he
should get plenty of air. All was quiet and peaceful until about
the middle of the night, and then the man and his wife were
awakened by yelps and frenzied scuttling in the passage.</p>

<p>"What the devil is it?" roared the man, and he jumped out of
bed and ran out of the bedroom, flashing his torch. "Tarnation,"
he shouted gleefully, "the little beggar's caught that big rat!"
and Buggy was patted and stroked and praised before he was
returned to his cupboard.</p>

<p>The next morning Buggy was taken out into the yard and
introduced to Blackbeetle, the big sheep dog. For a few moments
they smelt at each other suspiciously, but then they both began
wagging their tails. "It's not bad up here," said Blackbeetle,
talking things over. "They're quite decent to you and there's
plenty of good grub. I've got a spare bone or two now in my
kennel if you feel peckish, but you'll not find much meat on
them, as they were part of my supper last night." He spoke
warningly. "But you'll have to leave Pom-Pom alone or the
mistress won't like it. He's no blessed good now, but he's one
of the family."</p>

<p>Gradually Buggy began to settle down, and as time passed the
memory of his old home in part faded away. There was plenty of
sport in the barns, and it was a poor day if he didn't kill two
or three rats. As for mice, he caught hundreds among the
cornsacks, greatly to the envy of Blackbeetle, whose big body
could not wriggle into places where Buggy's little one went.</p>

<p>Rabbits, however, became Buggy's great delight, and when his
master took him with him into the paddocks he was in the seventh
heaven of dog joy, routing them out of the bushes and chasing
them back into the burrows. Sometimes he actually caught one,
and though his master generally took it away from him, it always
meant succulent innards for his tea.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was put down a fox hole, and it was grand sport,
for yelping and snarling like a beast of great size, he would so
terrify its inmates that out they would bolt to fall to his
master's gun or be caught by the sheepdog who would be whining
and whimpering all the time because he was too big to go down
the hole. Time and often Buggy got bitten, but he would bite
hard in return, and fear never came into his heart.</p>

<p>Ploughing time came round presently, and then he went with
his master for the whole day long among the hills some miles
distant from the homestead. Rabbits were plentiful there, and
while his master was ploughing round and round the paddock, he
would enjoy himself sniffing and scraping among the burrows.</p>

<p>Once he came upon a big brown snake basking in the sun. It
was the first snake he had seen, and, all unaware of the danger
he was running, he set upon it with no delay. It lifted its
dreadful head and hissed, but that did not deter Buggy in the
very least. It was something for him to kill, and he started
upon the job at once, jumping round it and barking excitedly.
The instinct, however, handed down to him by thousands and
thousands of his ancestors warned him to keep clear of the
deadly uplifted head, and it was not until the snake started to
glide off in the direction of its hole that he closed in to the
attack. Then, like lightning, he sprang on to it and made his
sharp little teeth meet in the neck.</p>

<p>The snake's body lashed round him furiously, but he held on
grimly, shaking the snake violently as he was accustomed to do
rats, and soon he could tell that it was dead. He was so pleased
with himself for having killed something new that, without
letting it drop out of his mouth, he carried it with great pride
to show his master. To his disgust the latter was quite angry
and gave him a couple of little cuffs.</p>

<p>"Silly little idiot!" he scowled. "You leave snakes alone or
you'll soon be having a little grave with a cross and a bit of
writing on it. 'Here lies Buggy, the fool!'"</p>

<p>And that night Blackbeetle, the sheepdog, gave him a
scolding, too. "Never go near a snake, my son," he said, "or
sooner or later he'll get you as sure as bones are bones." The
big dog spoke sadly. "I lost my poor wife, Titbits, that way, as
faithful a wife as any dog ever had. Seventy-three children she
gave me, and I've got sons and daughters all over the
place."</p>

<p>"Seventy-three!" exclaimed Buggy in great surprise. "Then
didn't they have to drown a lot of them?"</p>

<p>"Drown!" ejaculated Blackbeetle angrily. "Good gracious, no!
They were all sold at high prices." He drew himself up proudly.
"I'm a pedigree dog, I am, and the son of Blackspot, whose
grandfather was Blackangas, the famous Scotch dog. All his
descendants were called Black Something, and that's why I'm
Blackbeetle." He sighed. "I suppose they'd used up all the other
Black names and had to call me that."</p>

<p>Buggy spoke with some pride, too. "My mother was Cosey
Corner," he said, "and I believe she was sold for fifty
guineas."</p>

<p>"Never heard of her," said the sheepdog contemptuously, "but
then few people are interested in small dogs."</p>

<p>Buggy felt humbled. "But how did your wife come to be
killed?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Went for a snake the same as you did," was the reply. "He
bit her on the nose and she was dead in 10 minutes. Some day
I'll take you and show you some of her bones. There are still a
few left by the creek. She was a very finely formed dog."</p>

<p>At supper that night Buggy's master told his wife all about
the snake. "I was scared almost out of my life," he said, "when
up he came with a big 6ft. one trailing behind him. Gosh, the
little devil will never be afraid of anything!"</p>

<p>However, he was mistaken there, for only a few days later
Buggy knew fear for the first time, and it happened in this
way.</p>

<p>His master was ploughing and as usual, he wandered away to do
a bit of hunting. He chased a nice fat-looking bunny rabbit into
his burrow and then for a good half-hour tried to scrape him
out. Of course he was unsuccessful and, presently tiring with
his exertions, he lay down for a bit of a rest. He stretched
himself at full length and closed his eyes. The sun was nice and
warm and, in the distance, he could hear the hum of his master's
tractor going round. It was very soothing and soon he had
dropped to sleep. It was quite a nice sleep, and he dreamed of
rats and mice and other things which dogs love.</p>

<p>Picky, the son of Nasrah the crow, came passing by and saw
him, and in great haste flew off to tell his father. "Dad," he
said excitedly, "there's a black lamb lying by the rabbit
burrows and he must be sick for he's lying not as lambs
generally lie. He's got his legs stretched out."</p>

<p>"Good," nodded Nasrah, "then we'll go and pick his eyes out.
That's the ticket, my son."</p>

<p>So Nasrah told his wife and off they flew, but other crows
noticed them flying so straight and guessed there must be
something important on and flew after them.</p>

<p>Nasrah alighted warily a few yards away from the sleeping
Buggy and proceeded to give his opinion after the wisdom of crow
lore. "He's got funny feet," he said, "and for his size an
unusual amount of wool. Still, he's a lamb right enough, and as
Picky says, he must be very sick from the way he's stretched
out. But he's not dead yet, because his legs keep twitching. So
we must wait a little while."</p>

<p>More and more crows arrived, and soon there was a complete
circle of them gathered round the unconscious Buggy. Crows, with
all their cruelty, are cowardly birds and they hesitated to peck
at him until he was dead, or very nearly so. Besides, they could
not make out exactly where his eyes were, as everything about
his face was so black and the hair was so thick.</p>

<p>Buggy dreamed on and on and the crows, getting more and more
impatient, hopped closer and closer until they were only a few
feet away. Suddenly then, a big blowfly alighted on Buggy's nose
and he awoke.</p>

<p>He blinked his eyes a few times and then sat up. The crows
hopped back a few feet or so, but, thinking it must be his last
dying effort, did not move very far. Buggy blinked hard again.
Great Bones, where was he? What had happened? There was a ring
of big, evil-looking birds all around him! They had even bigger
beaks than had had Mickum, the magpie, in the garden of Number
Seven, and they were looking at him with cruel, dreadful eyes!
They were not afraid of him and he was all alone! He could not
hear the tractor now and so his master must have left him and
gone home! He did not remember that his master would be now
having a spell while he ate his dinner.</p>

<p>Terror filled poor Buggy's heart, stark naked
terror&mdash;and he lifted up his head and howled, a long drawn,
melancholy howl.</p>

<p>The effect was startling and, if ever crows could gasp, they
would certainly have gasped then. Never had they heard a lamb
make a noise like that! No, it could not be a lamb! Then it was
some new strange animal and he might be dangerous to them all!
So, quicker than it takes to tell, and long before the howl had
died away, they had flung themselves up into the air and, with
hoarse and raucous cries, were flying swiftly away.</p>

<p>Buggy found himself alone.</p>

<p>That night he told the whole story to the sheepdog, and when
he had finished the latter asked thoughtfully, "Do you say they
were all round you? Some of them were actually behind?"</p>

<p>"Yes, behind me," nodded Buggy. "In front of me and on both
sides."</p>

<p>The sheepdog looked very grave. "Then anything might have
happened to you," he said. "You'll never know in what real
danger you were. Crows are all right if you're watching them,
but if not&mdash;&mdash;then they'll do anything." He sighed
heavily. "If my poor wife, Titbits, were here now, she'll tell
you that."</p>

<p>"Why, did they do anything to her?" asked Buggy with saucer
eyes.</p>

<p>"They did," nodded Blackbeetle, "and it was when she was
carrying her sixth litter. I know it grave her a great shock,
because a few weeks later she had only seven pups in stead of
her usual nine or ten. What happened? Well, one day Titbits had
seen a big crow perching about the place all the afternoon, and
in the evening she saw him again when she was having a bit of
supper in this very yard. He was atop of that big gate there.
She was keeping her eye on him, right enough, when suddenly she
heard a great crash somewhere by the barn. She got up and turned
round so that her back was towards the crow to see what it was.
She found it was only old Gooseberry kicking over her milkpans
and, turning back again, saw the darned crow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coming straight at her," interrupted Buggy excitedly.</p>

<p>"No," snarled the sheepdog, "flying away with her blooming
bone."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1943-05-27"></a>"INVASION"</h2>

<h3> As published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide,
27 May 1943.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">ALL the long and sweltering afternoon, from
under the bank of a small creek some 20 miles inland off one of
the most desolate stretches of the north-west coast of Western
Australia, the three Japanese airmen had been watching the
lonely little homestead. The whole time they had been chattering
like monkeys, with their ape-like faces contorted in
excitement.</p>

<p>They were ravenously hungry and the house meant food for
them. Four days previously their plane had crashed some 20 miles
behind the Ninety Mile Beach, and all they had had to eat in
their wandering since then had been two small parrots which,
with a prodigious expenditure of ammunition, they had managed to
bring down with the one automatic pistol they possessed between
them.</p>

<p>The house, however, meant more to them than food, for they
would be able to learn from its inmates exactly where they were.
They were sure they could not be very far from the mouth of the
de Grey river and, if they could reach the coast there, they
thought they would be able to steal a boat and escape out to sea
where their submarines were always lurking.</p>

<p>Still, they dared not approach the house until darkness had
well fallen, because there were from three to four hundred yards
of open ground to be crossed, and they knew they would almost
certainly be seen by the tall lanky man who had come into view
several times. They were sure he would have a gun or rifle of
some kind, and they had only one cartridge left in their
pistol.</p>

<p>They had soon been confident they knew everyone who was
living in the house. Besides the man, there was a young woman
whom they took to be his wife, a small child, and an old woman
who might be the mother of either of the parents. Several times
they had seen all the four together, sitting in the shade on the
verandah.</p>

<p>They had a good pair of binoculars with them, and they smiled
and nodded quite a lot as they noted the younger woman was
comely and of a good figure.</p>

<p>They guessed what the occupation of the man must be, for the
house was situated only a short distance away from a high
vermin-proof fence stretching to beyond sight over the barren
wilderness of sand. They had heard of this fence and knew it to
be the one running for thirteen hundred and fifty miles across
Western Australia. So a certain length of it would be under the
man's care for him to see it was always in good enough repair to
keep out the rabbits. They guessed, also, that the next
habitation would be many miles distant, perhaps even half a
day's journey by car, and that the telephone they saw connected
to the house would probably lead there.</p>

<p>For a long while they had wondered angrily why the man had
not gone off upon his daily work in the car, which they could
see through the open door of a shed at the side of the house,
but, with a curse, they suddenly remembered that the day was
Sunday, the day upon which the fool Australians did nothing
except eat huge meals and loaf about.</p>

<p>Still for a short time at all events, the man had been doing
some kind of work, as they had heard sounds of hammering coming
from somewhere at the back of the house. The hammering, however,
had soon stopped and they had seen the man come slouching on to
the verandah and slump down on to a bench there close to the two
women and the child.</p>

<p>All unaware of the danger threatening them, the girl and her
mother had been talking animatedly together, finding quite a lot
to talk about, as indeed so often happens with people living in
very lonely places, notwithstanding that from one month to
another they see no new faces to relieve the monotony of their
lives.</p>

<p>Now the young wife turned to her husband. "You've been quick
in mending that gutter, Jim," she said. "Have you made a good
job of it?"</p>

<p>"No job at all," grunted Jim. "I haven't got any nails long
enough. I'll have to ring up old Sandy to give me some. He'll be
at the end of his beat tomorrow, and I'll meet him at the hill.
I'll go and ring up now before I forget," and he got up and went
into the house. He was back again in a few minutes and resumed
his seat upon the bench. He had now got a rather rusty-looking
gun with him and he proceeded to polish it up vigorously with a
piece of oiled rag.</p>

<p>"Now if you had not been so careless as to run out of
cartridges," said the older woman severely, "you could have got
us a pigeon or two. There were a lot down among the trees by the
creek this morning&mdash;&mdash;" she looked across into the
distance "&mdash;though they seem all to have flown away
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I mustn't run short again," said the man, "but as I've
told you I thought I'd got another box."</p>

<p>"The war news is pretty good, isn't it?" remarked his wife.
"The wireless says the Japs didn't do much harm with that raid
on Wyndham." She looked troubled. "But I'm always thinking we
shall have them here one day, and not a door in the house locks.
We should be quite helpless if they came."</p>

<p>Her husband guffawed. "What would they want to come here
for," he asked, "and what good would any flimsy doors do if they
did come."</p>

<p>"Oh, they might want to come to blow up the fence and let the
rabbits through," broke in his mother-in-law, "anything to
frighten us and do harm. At any rate I shan't feel happy until
we've killed them all and the war's over." She nodded
vigorously. "Somehow I don't feel easy today. That big rooster
was crowing at one o'clock this morning and that's a bad sign.
It means there's going to be a death somewhere."</p>

<p>"And it'll be him who's going to die," grinned Jim. "I'll be
killing him on Thursday, so that he'll be nice and tender for
Sunday." He scowled at the old woman. "But don't you talk such
nonsense, Mother. You'll be frightening Mary with your rotten
ideas."</p>

<p>An hour, nearly two, passed and, dusk approaching, the wife
went inside to prepare the evening meal. The Japanese saw a
light appear in one of the windows of the house, and, a few
minutes later, the family all sitting round the table. With
their binoculars the airmen could see quite plainly through the
wire screen of the open window.</p>

<p>The moment they had been waiting for had at last arrived and,
climbing up over the bank of the creek, they ran stealthily up
to the house. They opened the wire door very quietly and,
traversing a short passage, burst into the living-room.</p>

<p>The younger woman shrieked and sprang up to seize her child.
The elder woman jumped to her feet, too, but from her tightly
pressed lips came no sound. Only the man remained seated where
he was. He seemed stunned, and his mouth gaped and his face
paled, even under its heavy tan.</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands," shouted one of the Japanese in
perfectly good English, pointing his pistol at the man, and the
latter, recovering from his surprise, obeyed instantly.</p>

<p>"Stand up," ordered the Japanese sharply. "Turn round," and
again the man obeyed. Then very quickly his wrists were tied
tightly together behind him with part of a torn teacloth and he
was pushed back into his chair. Next, his ankles were tied to
the rails of the chair. The Japanese now took some notice of the
women.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, ladies," said their leader with an ugly
smile. "All we want is plenty to eat and drink." He leered at
the young wife. "We mean you no harm."</p>

<p>"But you shan't have anything," called out the old woman with
blazing eyes. "We won't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Mother," said the husband sternly, "or you'll only
make things worse." He nodded to his wife. "Give them everything
we've got, Mary. It'll be best for us if we do."</p>

<p>The Japanese spokesman now started to question the man. "How
far are you from the next house?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"About forty miles. My mate, Sandy, lives there. He works on
the fence, same as I do."</p>

<p>"And how far are you from the de Grey River?"</p>

<p>"Nearly fifty, not quite."</p>

<p>"Is your car in good running order?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I could take you to the de Grey in a couple of
hours."</p>

<p>"Which way should we go?"</p>

<p>"You can't make any mistake. You follow the track going
west."</p>

<p>"Could we get a boat there without being seen?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated. "Yes, if you turn off south into the bush
directly you come in sight of the township and work your way
round to the wharf. You'll find several boats tied up there, and
there's no one looking after them at night."</p>

<p>The old woman burst out angrily. "You're a traitor, Jim!
These men are our enemies, and you're going to help them to
escape."</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. "Can't help it, mother.
They've got the upper hand of us and if we treat them fair
they'll go away and leave us. You heard him say they're not
going to hurt us."</p>

<p>"You fool," shouted the old woman savagely, "can't you see
they're only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth, woman," ordered the Japanese sharply, "and
bring us all you've got to eat in the house. We'll be taking
some of it away with us."</p>

<p>The old woman subsided mutteringly into her chair, but the
wife did as her husband had told her to and put more food on the
table.</p>

<p>The Japanese, seating themselves down, proceeded to eat
hastily, talking, however, among themselves most of the time.
Every now and then they eyed the younger woman in a way which
made her feel sick with fear. She was clutching her child again
and choking back her tears with a great effort. Presently the
Japanese who was, apparently, the only one of three who could
speak English, remarked smilingly to her, "It's a pity there are
not three of you, young lady. Still . . .,' but he shrugged his
shoulders and said something to his companions in their own
language which, from their expressions, seemed to them to be a
good joke.</p>

<p>So the intense drama proceeded in that little room. The old
woman was like a baffled tigress who knew she had neither teeth
nor claws; the young wife was terrified at the thought of what
might be going to happen to them all, and the Japanese were
pleasurably excited, with more than even murder in their hearts.
Only the bound man in the chair was calm, though his forehead
was now pricked out in little beads of sweat.</p>

<p>His eyes kept wandering to the clock upon the mantelshelf as
if he were considering how much longer he had to live, for,
notwithstanding the promise of the Japanese who spoke English,
he was under no delusion that he could expect any mercy from
him. They would just take him out and kill him when they had
finished their meal, and his child and his wife's mother would
meet the same fate. He shuddered when he thought what would
happen to his wife.</p>

<p>He watched the three men intently. They were just like
animals in the way they took their food. Their small yellow
faces were hard and cruel, their arms were long like ape's, and
their strong bony hands looked the very hands for throttling
people. He wondered how he would have to die; the bullet, the
knife or those dreadful hands about his neck.</p>

<p>Their hunger and thirst at last satisfied, with meaning nods
to one another, the three Japanese rose simultaneously to their
feet. Their leader said a few quick words to his companions and
then turned to the others in the room, "You," he said to the
man, "are to go out with these gentlemen and show them how to
start the car. We shall drive it ourselves and shan't want you
to come. Take the old woman out with you to carry the lantern.
The child can go with her, too." He made a smiling bow to the
wife. "You will remain here."</p>

<p>The girl shuddered and went white as death, and for the first
time there was terror upon the husband's face, but the old woman
was undaunted and prepared to show fight. "You yellow beasts,"
she shouted, "I'll not leave my daughter alone. I'll . . ." She
made a dash towards a big carving knife on the table, but one of
the Japanese was too quick for her and seized her roughly by the
arm. His leader gave him a sharp order and the man pulled out an
ugly-looking knife from his belt. The old woman struggled
fiercely.</p>

<p>Then the avalanche descended.</p>

<p>In quick succession three rifle bullets came tearing through
the wire screen of the window, and two of the Japanese crashed
on to the floor. They had both been shot in the head, and after
a few convulsive movements lay quite still where they had
fallen, but the third man, their leader, had been missed, and,
taking in like lightning that the danger was coming from the
window, he darted to the door to escape from the room.</p>

<p>But the old woman was between him and the door, and, though
looking as ghastly as if she were dead, had yet got all her wits
about her. Exactly at the right moment she put out her foot and
tripped him heavily. Then, before he could get up, she had
snatched a chopper off the dresser and given him a vicious blow
upon the back of his head. He groaned and lay still.</p>

<p>A few moments of dreadful silence followed, and then an
elderly red-haired man with a still smoking rifle in his hand
burst into the room. "Gude for you, mother," he shouted
gleefully as he took in the old woman with her chopper standing
over the prostrate Japanese. He bent down. "Yes, you've done for
him, all recht," he went on in the broadest Scotch. "But if not,
I'll finish him off outside," and with no ceremony he grabbed
him by the heel and dragged him out along the passage to the
front entrance of the house.</p>

<p>He was back again very quickly and patted the old woman on
the back. "But you're a bonny lassie, you are," he exclaimed
admiringly. "It were a gude blow, and he's as dead as a
herring." He turned to the trembling wife. "Dinna ye fash
yerself, ye poor gal. Them yeller deils can do no harm no more."
He regarded the two bodies on the floor with obvious
satisfaction. "But I were taking no chances, as I were not sure
what pistols they had got. So I just put ma bullets furst."</p>

<p>"But Jim was talking to them quite friendly," choked the old
woman. "He was telling them how to escape to the de Grey River.
He's a traitor and a coward."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," reproved the Scotchman, "he war a brave mon and
full of sense. He war keeping them talking 'till I got here with
ma gun. He knew what he were aboot all the time."</p>

<p>"But it was touch and go for us all, Sandy," said Jim
reproachfully. "You cut it very fine."</p>

<p>"But I didn't," laughed the other, "not near so fine as ye
think. I was biding ootside some wee minutes till I could get
'em quite clear without hurting any of ye. I were watchin' over
ye, dinna fear."</p>

<p>He untied Jim quickly, and the latter gave him a warm clasp
of the hand before throwing his arms round his wife. "I was sure
you'd come, Sandy. I knew you wouldn't fail us."</p>

<p>"Not I," exclaimed Sandy stoutly, "but I had to leave ma car
a gude mile away so that they shouldna hear it, and run the rest
of the way for ma verra life." Then turned to the old woman.
"That mon you hit with the chopper war a verra bad fellow. Ye
ken I picked up a bit of their beastly language when the
pearling boats war in and I heard him tell they others to stick
a knife in Jim's back when they got him ootside and give ye a
stick, too."</p>

<p>"But Jim," gasped the wife, lifting her tear-stained face
from his shoulder, "how did you know Sandy was coming?"</p>

<p>"Because I had phoned him," laughed her husband happily.
"When I went up on that ladder to mend the gutter I saw the
three devils hiding in the creek, and I guessed they were only
waiting until it got dark to rush the house. So it was Sandy and
his gun that I phoned for, and not any big nails. That's why,
too, I brought my old gun on to the verandah, to let them see
it. They weren't to know I'd got no cartridges for it. Then when
we all came inside I knew it would be no good barricading the
place because they'd have broken in easily or shot at us through
the windows somewhere."</p>

<p>"And I coom at wunce," nodded Sandy, "after I'd had a wee
talk with de Grey station an told 'em what war oop. They'll no
be long in gettin' here, either. Hark, hark, there be a car
cooming the noo. Let's bide for 'em ootside, awa from these dead
pigs."</p>

<p>They went out at once as he suggested, the old woman,
however, lagging behind just long enough to acquire a pair of
laces from the shoes of one of the dead men.</p>

<p>"They're just what Jim wants so badly," she muttered darkly,
"and I owe him something for calling him a traitor."</p>

<p>She smiled grimly to herself. "Yes, I'll give them to him as
a present, and he'll never know where I got them."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1944-01-29"></a>RUSSIAN RETROSPECT</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide,
29 January 1944.</h3>
<br>

<p class="intro"><i>WHEN this fell tide of blood and agony has
ebbed, when this scourge of horrors unbelievable no longer
lashes on the quivering shoulders of mankind, and when the veil
of secrecy and mystery and lies is at last lifted, surely the
historian will record that, above all happenings of these
dreadful years, it was that one of the 22nd day in June, 1941,
which saved the world, for it was then that the great German
Colossus laid his body open to a mortal blow.</i></p>

<br>

<h3>DESPAIR</h3>

<p class="first">I SO well remember that Sunday afternoon when
it came over the air that Germany was attacking Russia. I was
living then in what city dwellers would call a very lonely
place, high up by the range of hills dominated by the Camel's
Hump.</p>

<p>It had been a most depressing day, and now dusk was drawing
in under a dark and lowering sky. Fierce rainsqualls were
beating down, the glistening mud, and the cold was as biting as
it can be in mid-winter in South Australia, nearly 3,000 ft.
above sea level.</p>

<p>I had been writing at my desk, but my thoughts now wandered
to the war, where things were looking every bit as bleak for us
as was the outlook from my window. Everything seemed to be going
badly.</p>

<p>The bitter humiliation of our so recent evacuation from Crete
was still rankling, but, far worse than any loss of prestige,
with the island in enemy hands our whole position in the Eastern
Mediterranean was threatened, with Libya, Suez, Syria, and all
that lay beyond in more than possible danger.</p>

<p><b>Rommel had just thrown us back at Sollum, and the high
hopes held out to us of our attack there had come to nothing.
Vichy had just made what "The Times" described as a "diabolical
pact" with Germany.</b></p>

<p>The Turco-German pact, to which the same newspaper referred
to as "bad business," had just been signed. The U-boat campaign
was going against us, and day by day we were being warned that
our shipping losses were very grave.</p>

<p>Indeed, only that week Hore-Belisha, the former Minister for
War, had summed up the whole situation in the House of Commons
in one biting sentence when he declared we were suffering defeat
after defeat in both war and diplomacy.</p>

<h3>DOUBT</h3>

<p class="first">REGARDING Russia, Hitler was exerting a deadly
pressure on her. He was demanding grain, minerals, and oil, and
she would have to give them to him or be annihilated. It was
agreed by all competent observers she was in no condition to
fight, and also that Stalin would never dare to arm his
peasantry, certain that with weapons in their hands they would
turn against him.</p>

<p>This, then, was the world position when that Sunday
afternoon, depressed and thinking any fresh news would be bad
news, I switched on the wireless, and upon my horrified ears
fell the words:&mdash;"German forces have crossed the frontier
and invaded Russia."</p>

<p><b>Then came Hitler's message to his people. "Weighed down
with heavy care for many months, I can at last speak... a
German concentration, the greatest the world has ever known, has
been completed... our soldiers are now advancing from East
Prussia to the Carpathians... I have decided to put the fate
and future of the German Reich into their hands, and may God
help us in the battle."</b></p>

<p>Followed a warning to the Russian people from the Berlin
Radio:&mdash;"It is useless to resist... you are facing the
best Army in the world, which, in a few weeks, annihilated the
strongest armies in Europe."</p>

<p>I was in the very depths of depression. So, it had really
come! Hitler would add Russia to the other conquered nations! He
would get his grain, his minerals, and his oil! Then, satiated
with Soviet blood and spoil, he would turn as a giant refreshed,
upon our sceptred isle, "This precious stone set in the silver
sea."</p>

<p>I switched off the wireless, not thrilled, as I realise now I
should have been, in one of the most joyful moments of my life,
for, had I only known it, the announcement which had just come
through was the most wonderful piece of good news for many a
long, long day. I had thought it was the death-knell of a nation
I had heard, whereas it had been the joybells for a nation born
again.</p>

<p>Who, however, on that dreary Sunday afternoon, in their
wildest flights of imagination would have ever dared to think
that more than two and a half years later, Leningrad would not
have been taken, Moscow would not have fallen, and the Red Army
would be fighting near to the Polish border?</p>

<h3>HOPE</h3>

<p class="first">NOW come two dreadful thoughts. Where would we
be today if none of these things had happened, or where either,
if instead of using it in Russia, Hitler had sent even one-
quarter of that mighty Army over to North Africa?</p>

<p>Do we dare to think? Remembering by what an uncomfortably
narrow margin the tide was finally turned against Rommel and his
hosts, can we conceive there would have been any El Alamein
victory, any triumph in Tunisia, or any of the successes which
followed after? Indeed, would not Libya, Egypt, Suez, Iran,
Iraq, and even more have been lost to us, and could we have ever
won them back?</p>

<p>Then we must realise, too, that if Hitler had left Russia
alone and, after over-running North Africa, had concentrated all
his energies nearer home upon the construction of fighting
planes, bombers, and U-boats, particularly upon the last when we
were then so ill-prepared to meet the menace, things would have
been very different today.</p>

<p><b>If we were still unconquered, the question we would be
asking ourselves now would not be can we beat Germany,
but&mdash;can we save ourselves from complete and utter
annihilation.</b></p>

<p>So in those last moments of Schicklgruber's black and evil
life, when he kneels waiting for the axe to fall, or he stands
waiting for the noose to jerk upon his neck, or, more likely
still, when he feels the cold barrel of his own revolver pressed
against his forehead, surely his last thought will be that it
was on that fatal day in June, 1941, he made the wrong move
and&mdash;lost the game.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1944-03-11"></a>THE AMAZING ADVENTURE OF MARMADUKE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, March, 1944</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">MARMADUKE DANGERFIELD, for all his high
sounding names, was a very ordinary and commonplace looking
little man. Of slight physique, he had light, watery blue eyes
and scanty, sandy-colored hair. He did not smoke, he drank
sparingly of alcoholic beverages, and he was not much interested
in pretty girls.</p> <p>A bachelor, and living all his adult
life in lodgings, he had consumed vast quantities of the
indigestible concoctions of bad cooks, with the result that at
37 years of age he was a confirmed dyspeptic and the gloomy
possessor of many subsidiary ailments which apparently resisted
all attempts to dislodge them.</p>

<p>Flitting from doctor to doctor as a bee flits from flower to
flower, besides what they prescribed for him, he was always
taking patent medicines, and it was really wonderful how his
constitution stood up to everything.</p>

<p>A piano-tuner by occupation, he had literary ambitions and
was quite confident that he would one day write a
book&mdash;exactly what it was to be about he was not
certain&mdash;which would make him famous. His day dreams were
brightest when he was by himself in lonely places, and, in
summer, at fine week-ends he would often ride off on his
bicycle, far from the city, and, provided with food and a few
simple cooking utensils, set up a little camp and sleep under
the stars. He always took care, however, to carry with him
adequate supplies of whatever medicines he was believing at that
particular moment to be necessary for the ensuring of good
health.</p>

<p>One evening, upon one of these excursions, he found himself
some hundred and twenty miles north of Adelaide, a long way
distant from any habitation. It was rocky, treeless country, and
he had left all roads behind him, and followed a narrow track
leading up to a high range of hills. He pitched his camp among a
small cluster of rocks just off the track, choosing this site
because there was a well-filled dam close near, and, with the
water in it looking clean and clear, he would be able to have a
refreshing swim in the morning.</p>

<p>He was boiling his billy in preparation for the evening meal
when greatly to his surprise, as the place was so very lonely, a
man came into view, bicycling along the track. He stood up to
watch him pass by, but the man, catching sight of him, alighted
from his machine and proceeded to wheel it over the rough ground
to the rocks. He asked Marmaduke if he would let him have a
match.</p>

<p>The piano-tuner was only too happy to oblige, and, anxious
for a chat, invited him to have a drink of tea. The man at once
sat down and it ended in his sharing the whole meal, tinned
salmon, cucumber, cheese, and dates, the indigestible things for
which, above all others, Marmaduke's soul always craved.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2100091h-images/TheAmazingAdventures-1.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Always confiding, Marmaduke talked freely about himself, and
the stranger, though more reticently inclined, told something of
his own adventurous life. Only thirty-four, he had been
prospector after gold, boundary rider, drover, rabbit-trapper,
and a hunter of wild dogs. Marmaduke was an eager listener. Here
was the very man, he was sure, who could provide material for a
dozen books, and he would have liked to listen to him for hours.
Darkness, however, was not far off, and the stranger said he
must be moving on, as he had a long ride yet before him.</p>

<p>Disappointed at losing so interesting a companion, Marmaduke
asked him to look him up when he was next in the city, and
started to search hurriedly in his pocketbook for one of his
cards. In his fluster he spilled its contents, and two £5 notes
fluttered to the ground. The stranger picked them up, staring
hard at them before he handed them over.</p>

<p>Finding his card at last, Marmaduke gave it to the stranger,
and the latter put it in his tobacco tin. "Shan't lose it
there," he smiled, and then it seemed, he was no longer in such
a hurry to go. He related more of his adventures, and finally
suggested that, as he was feeling so tired, he should pitch his
camp there, too, for the night.</p>

<p>Marmaduke expressed himself as delighted, and added
laughingly, "And I'll be able to give you a nice little night
cap to make certain of a good sleep. I've got some whisky in my
flask, and it'll do us both good."</p>

<p>So, while the stranger was preparing his bed, Marmaduke got
the whisky ready. He always had a tot at night, because in it he
nearly always put a sleeping tablet. His latest doctor had
prescribed some, which, he said, were extra strong, and warned
him never to take more than one at a time. Marmaduke, however,
often exceeded the instructions of his medical advisers and that
night, feeling stiff after his riding, was intending to take a
double dose.</p>

<p>Their final preparations for bed ready, they drank the whisky
to each other's healths and a good night's rest. The stranger
tossed his down in one big gulp, and then licked over his lips
with a rather frowning face.</p>

<p>"What whisky is that?" he asked curiously. "Got a bit of a
rum taste, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," replied Marmaduke, drinking his more
slowly. "It's good Scotch," and then, all in a flash, to his
consternation, he realised what had happened. It was in the
stranger's mug he had put the two sleeping tablets!</p>

<p>For the moment he was on the point of blurting out the
unfortunate mistake he had made. Instantly, however, he thought
better of it. It might, perhaps, frighten his new-found friend,
and, if he kept silent, no harm would be done. So he said
nothing, and, lying back comfortably, the two talked on for
another hour or so. Presently the conversation lapsed, and,
after a few moments, with some amusement Marmaduke heard loud
snores.</p>

<p>"He's settled now," he grinned, "and I hope I go off soon,
too."</p>

<p>But it was a long while before he dropped off, and then his
sleep was broken. The night had turned chilly and he cuddled
into his blankets, afraid that he would be catching cold. Many
times he woke up and every time he heard his companion's loud
snores. Towards morning, however, his sleep became deeper, and
it was broad daylight when he finally woke up for good. Indeed,
even then he might not have awakened if it had not been for the
barking of a dog and the loud baaing of sheep. He sprang to his
feet to see a man driving a mob to the dam.</p>

<p>He moved over to waken the stranger. In his sleep the latter
had thrown off the upper part of his blanket, and there was a
big, hefty-looking knife which must have fallen out of his
pocket by his side. At the sound of Marmaduke's voice he sat up
with a jerk, and from his startled appearance evidently could
not take in where he was. He scowled&mdash;and then his eyes
fell upon the man with the sheep, who was coming up to speak to
them.</p>

<p>"Here, you!" called out the man angrily. "You've no business
to have lit a fire there. One spark and you would have had all
this paddock alight. It's folk like you who bring all these
bushfires on us. You value your miserable cup of tea more than
the lives of hundreds of sheep and thousands of pounds' damage
to other people's property. Now you just clear off. You're not
to light another fire."</p>

<p>The stranger said nothing, but Marmaduke was full of
protestations and assurances of the care he always took. The
man, however, ignored everything he said, and then without
another word just stood watching them until they had collected
their things together and ridden off on their bicycles. The two
went different ways, and Marmaduke was annoyed at the curt,
unfriendly nod the stranger gave him in parting. The weather
looked as if it was going to break, and, fearful of catching
cold, Marmaduke rode the whole way home that day.</p>

<p>A week passed, and one Monday evening Marmaduke returned home
to his lodgings to find two stern-faced men waiting to speak to
him. "We're police," said one of them nastily. "We want to know
where you were on Saturday afternoon."</p>

<p>Marmaduke was frightened at his menacing tone and looked as
guilty as anyone could be of anything he was going to be accused
of. "Why, at home here," he stammered. "I was working in the
garden."</p>

<p>"Can you bring anyone to prove it?" asked the detective, and
Marmaduke's landlady was at once called in to verify the truth
of what he had said. She was dismissed with a nod, and the
detective produced an old tobacco tin. "This yours?" he asked, a
little bit less roughly. "No! You don't smoke? Well, ever seen
this before?"</p>

<p>The trembling Marmaduke shook his head. "No, I haven't," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Then how does this card of yours happen to be in it?"
snapped the detective. "Did you give it to anyone?"</p>

<p>Marmaduke's eyes opened very wide. "Yes, yes. I do remember
that tin now," he exclaimed excitedly. "It belonged to a man
whom I met when on a holiday the week before last. I gave him
that card of mine to call upon me when he was next in the city,
and I recollect him putting it inside to be sure he should not
lose it."</p>

<p>"Where did you meet him?" snapped the detective.</p>

<p>"When I was camping on the range between Burra and
Clare."</p>

<p>"Not near Gladstone?"</p>

<p>"No, a good fifty miles from there, but why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because we want that man very badly. Good heavens! Don't you
read the newspapers? Didn't you see about the farmer near
Gladstone being murdered?"</p>

<p>Marmaduke went as white as a sheet. Of course he had read
about the murder, and it was the main topic on everybody's lips.
It had been a dreadful crime in a lonely farmhouse. An elderly
farmer had happened to be alone that afternoon, and his wife had
returned home to find him lying dead in a pool of blood with his
head terribly battered in. The house had been ransacked and more
than £300 in notes and some jewellery stolen. So far as the
public had heard, there was no trace of the murderer.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" he answered shakily. "Of course I've heard about
it." His knees shook under him. "But do you think, it was the
man I met who did it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty certain," nodded the detective. "This tin was picked
up near the house and it must have dropped out of his pocket, as
the farmer's wife said she had never seen it before." He put his
hand on Marmaduke's arm. "Here, you must come up to the
Watchhouse with us and tell your story there."</p>

<p>So for two hours and longer Marmaduke was the centre of
interest at the police headquarters. A little shaky, he yet told
his story well, bringing in quite dramatically the man being
about to ride off until the incident of the dropped £5 notes. He
told, too, of his mistake with the sleeping tablets and his
seeing the knife by the stranger's side when he woke him up in
the morning.</p>

<p>"Gad! But you were lucky," exclaimed the Chief Inspector.
"You'd have been cold meat right enough if you hadn't doped him
off. Now you just give us a good description, of what he was
like."</p>

<p>Here, however, Marmaduke was a rotten reed to rely upon, and
the police were most disgusted when they found he could give
them no adequate description at all. He said the man was neither
dark nor fair and just ordinary looking. He didn't know what
color his hair was, as he had kept his cap on all the time, even
when he had gone off to sleep. Also, he wasn't certain if he
were either tall or short and he couldn't remember the exact
color of his eyes. Of only one thing was he sure, and that was
that he would be certain to recognise him again if he saw
him.</p>

<p>The following day he was taken up in a police car to where
his camp had been and the man with the sheep run to earth. With
the latter the police had another disappointment, as the man had
no recollection of what Marmaduke's companion had been like.
Certainly, he stated, he remembered Marmaduke, but only because
the piano tuner had excused himself so volubly and, he added
rudely, had looked such a fool.</p>

<p>Weeks went by and the murderer was no nearer being caught. A
reward of £500 was offered, and it became the obsession of
Marmaduke's life to earn the money. Every day, all day long, he
was on the look-out. Morning, noon, and night, whenever his work
permitted, he promenaded up and down the main streets of the
city. He stood outside cinemas, he loitered by tobacco shops,
and he frequented bars. Many times he thought he saw the
stranger at a distance, but a closer inspection always
disappointed him. Often his hard staring annoyed people and more
than once he was threatened with unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>Longer than two months had passed, and then one afternoon he
almost jumped out of his skin. He saw the stranger passing just
by the town hall.</p>

<p>He was sure of it! He was certain it was he! But he
hesitated, with his heart beating like a piston. No, he wasn't
quite so sure! This man was well dressed and looked spic and
span. In a way he was quite different, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The man was smoking a cigarette and walking towards Victoria
square. In a perfect agony of doubt Marmaduke followed him. The
man turned into Flinders street and made straight up to a car
parked by the kerb. He opened the door, and then&mdash;something
happened and Marmaduke leapt upon his back and clasped him
tightly in his arms.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" he shrieked to a passer-by. "This man has
picked my pocket! He's got my wallet on him! I felt him take
it!"</p>

<p>With an oath the man tried to fling Marmaduke off, but
Marmaduke clung tightly until a little crowd was gathered.
"Don't let him get away!" he panted. "Don't let him get into his
car!"</p>

<p>A policeman came running up, and Marmaduke again shrieked his
accusation. The man shook with rage and denied everything, but
the policeman ordered sternly they should both come with him to
the Watchhouse.</p>

<p>It was close, and Marmaduke thrilled to see in the
charge-room a detective to whom he was well known.</p>

<p>"This man," began the policeman, indicating Marmaduke,
"charges this gentleman with picking his pocket. He
says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the excited Marmaduke had now recovered his breath and
interrupted shrilly: "No, I don't say that now. I only said it
to get him brought here." His voice choked again, so that he
could only speak with difficulty. "He's the&mdash;&mdash;!" He
almost shrieked. "He's the Gladstone murderer. He's the man I
gave my card to."</p>

<p>A few brief seconds of stunned silence followed, and it was
seen the well-dressed man had gone as white as a sheet. Suddenly
he sprang over to Marmaduke and lunged him a fearful blow, but
the policeman knocked his arm up just in time and seized hold of
him as he made a dash for the door.</p>

<p>"I followed him up King William street," cried the exultant
Marmaduke, "but I wasn't sure till I saw him spit, and then I
knew. He was spitting a lot that night when he was talking to
me."</p>

<p>The man's guilt was obvious straight away, as the murdered
farmer's watch was actually found on him. Also, his fingermarks
were identical with those on the chopper with which the farmer
had been killed.</p>

<p>In due time he was hanged, and when all the facts became
known Marmaduke was the hero of the hour. His photograph was in
all the newspapers and everybody wanted to talk to him. He got
the £500 reward, and on the strength of it married a pretty
young lady reporter who had come to interview him. A bouncing,
sandy-haired boy quickly eventuated, and Marmaduke's supply of
patent medicines was at once cut off. The wife insisted that the
baby and the dopes were too expensive luxuries to be allowed
together.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1944-04-08"></a>GHOSTS</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 8 April 1944.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">IT was the ending of the fourth day of the
'Hylden versus Hylden and Carnarvon' divorce case, and
excitement was running high. Not, indeed, that there had been
any excitement in the court itself for His Honor, Judge Bevan-
Royal, was a stern martinet, and emotion was given no rein when
he was presiding on the Bench.</p>

<p>Fifty-five years of age, he had been admitted to the practice
of the law in the Old Country some 30 years previously.
Migrating, however, to South Australia, he had soon made his
mark, and at 45 had been elevated to the Bench. Of an austere
morality, and with a well-known distaste for dealing with cases
of matrimonial infidelity, it was nevertheless generally
conceded he was by far the best divorce judge in the State.
Devoid of sentiment and cold as ice where a pretty face was
concerned, it was agreed on all sides that in any case he was
handling he would hold the scales of justice to the balance of
the finest gossamer of a spider's web.</p>

<p>Never influenced in the slightest degree by the most
passionate appeal of counsel, and, indeed, regarding all their
eloquence as an attempt to fog the issues involved, his mind
would sink like a plummet to the bottom rock of facts, and guilt
or innocence was determined by him in an atmosphere as calm and
still as that of an age-old hermetically sealed tomb.</p>

<p>But if there had been no apparent excitement in the court it
was very different outside, as Sir Miles and Lady Hylden were
among the best-known figures in society circles in Adelaide, and
Dr. Carnarvon was one of its most promising young medical men.
The knight was a wealthy man in the middle fifties, and his
wife, the lovely Madelaine Adair before her marriage, was nearly
30 years younger than he. They had been married two years, and
there were no children. Madelaine was Sir Miles' third wife.</p>

<p>It was the old, old story, of an elderly lover passionately
enamored of a young girl, and she marrying him for position and
all that wealth could give.</p>

<p>By no means could it be said that Sir Miles was a pleasant
character, either in looks or ways. Short and stout, with his
head coming straight off his shoulders, he had a red, vein-lined
face and hard, searching eyes. Undoubtedly, however, he was most
capable, and, with the courage and tenacity of a bull-dog, he
had bullied his way to fortune, and in his colorful life
obtained nearly all he wanted. He had wanted Madelaine, and he
had got her, like everything else&mdash;by purchase.</p>

<p>On her part, Madelaine was of some character, and certainly
no weakling. With never any real affection for her husband, she
might yet have made him a good wife if she had ever learnt to
respect him, but, with his passion for her quickly cooling, he
had lost all interest in her, and was soon on the look-out again
for favors from any pretty woman who happened to take his fancy.
Also, of late, he had become a hard and heavy drinker.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2100091h-images/Ghosts-1.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>So, less than a year after their marriage, they had both
begun to go their own ways. Madelaine had been the bright
society butterfly, enjoying herself as best she could, and, with
no interference from her husband, making her own circle of
friends.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, and without the slightest warning, Sir Miles
had pulled her up with a jerk, accused her of unfaithfulness,
turned her out of the house, and had the papers served, naming
Dr. Carnarvon as the co-respondent. He claimed £5,000 damages.
Both Lady Hylden and the doctor strenuously denied the charge,
and the cream of the South Australian Bar had been briefed by
the contending parties.</p>

<p>In the course of the proceedings in the court two very
different pictures of Sir Miles had been given. In one he had
been held up as an affectionate, very wronged, and very shocked
husband, who had suddenly found himself betrayed by the one man
above all others he should have been able to trust&mdash;the
family medical adviser. In the other, he had been portrayed as
the neglecting and unscrupulous husband who, getting tired of
his wife and scheming to be rid of her, had deliberately thrown
her as much as possible in the doctor's way, just biding his
time until be thought he had accumulated enough evidence of
guilt against her.</p>

<p>He told the court he had had no suspicions at all until one
night, coming home from a public dinner a good hour before he
was expected, he had seen a man rush out from one of the french
windows, and get away by scaling the garden wall. He had
recognised the man as Dr. Carnarvon.</p>

<p>At once instituting inquiries, he had learnt the doctor had
been in the habit of paying secret visits to the house, not
coming up openly in his car, but parking the car in an
unfrequented lane some hundreds of yards away.</p>

<p>In the witness box both Lady Hylden and the doctor had denied
the secret visits, and, referring to the particular night when
Sir Miles averred he had recognised the doctor running from the
house, Madelaine had sworn she had had no visitors at all that
evening, adding scornfully that, if she had had one, her husband
had certainly been in no condition to recognise who he was, as
he, Sir Miles, had been three-parts intoxicated when he had
arrived home.</p>

<p>In the course of the trial, what was considered as one of the
strongest points made by counsel against Madelaine had been that
her personal maid, who had been turned out of the house at the
same time as her mistress, had most mysteriously disappeared
directly after she had had been served with a subpoena to attend
the court. If she had been put in the witness box, insisted
counsel, from her would have been dragged the damning admission
of the many secret visits of Dr. Carnarvon. Making matters look
even worse, it had been shown that the day before the girl had
disappeared Madelaine had cashed a cheque for £100.</p>

<p>It was true, Madelaine had explained this cheque by stating
she had drawn it to use at the races. As, however, it was well
known she had never taken much interest in racing, and, indeed,
could not mention one single horse on which she had ever placed
more than £1, the explanation had been regarded by everyone as
very weak and unconvincing.</p>

<p>With the adjournment of the court on the fourth afternoon,
Judge Bevan-Royal retired to his private room, and, taking off
his wig and disrobing, leant back tiredly in a big arm-chair,
and thoughtfully considered the three parties in the case. He
had met them all socially. Sir Miles he detested, he could not
help admiring the wife, and, from what he had seen of Dr.
Carnarvon, he liked him.</p>

<p>Of course, however, Lady Hylden and the doctor were guilty!
There could be so doubt about that and on the morrow he would
grant the petition for the dissolution of the marriage. But he
had no sympathy with the husband, and would give him no damages.
By his neglect and general manner of living he had contributed
to his wife's infidelity. At any rate, he looked a satyr, and,
possibly, nay probably, was every bit as bad as she was.</p>

<p>Had not he, Bevan-Royal, with his own eyes, seen him making
up to that young widow-woman at that garden party the previous
week? Yes, he had watched him ogling her in that horrid way.
Perhaps he would marry her next and she would be wife number
four.</p>

<p>He was sorry for Dr. Carnarvon. It would mean utter ruin for
him, even if his name was not removed from the medical register.
But then he had gone into things with his eyes open, and he must
take the consequences.</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted by an attendant knocking on
the door and entering the room. "A young gentleman would like to
speak to Your Honor," he said. "His name is Smith, and he says
he comes from England."</p>

<p>"Smith!" exclaimed the judge. "What does he want?"</p>

<p>"He says his business is private, Your Honor, but he'll only
keep you a minute or two."</p>

<p>"Show him in," frowned the judge, and a smart young man in
the uniform of the mercantile marine was ushered in. He was
unusually good-looking, with a smiling, open countenance.</p>

<p>"Judge Bevan-Royal?" he asked. "Then, pardon my troubling
you, sir," he went on, "but I come under peculiar circumstances.
My mother died rather suddenly some six months ago, and I found
among her things an old newspaper cutting of many years back,
saying you had been made a judge here in Adelaide. Never having
heard her speak of you, I was curious if she had ever known you,
and thought that if ever I were in Adelaide, I would come and
see you to find out."</p>

<p>The judge's eyes were hooded, and he was regarding his
visitor intently. "What was your mother's Christian name?" he
asked after a few moments' hesitation.</p>

<p>"Gertrude, sir," was his reply. "She was a hospital
nurse."</p>

<p>"Then I did know her," nodded the judge. "She nursed me
through a very serious illness, and, the doctors said, saved my
life. I have always had most grateful feelings for her." He
frowned. "I wrote to her after I had come out here, but the
letter was returned through the Dead Letter Office. She had gone
away, and left no address."</p>

<p>"She did it on purpose, sir," said the boy. "She didn't want
my father to know where she was. He had been very unkind to her,
and she had left him before I was born. I have never seen him,
and do not even know if he is alive."</p>

<p>"Then you are the only child?" said the judge. "How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five next birthday, sir," replied the boy. He spoke
proudly. "I am first officer on s.s. Nerbudda."</p>

<p>They chatted on for quite awhile, and, learning the boy would
be in Adelaide until the following afternoon, the judge invited
him to dinner at a hotel that evening, They had a very pleasant
meal together, and, in parting, the judge asked him to write to
him occasionally, adding that if ever he could be of any service
to him, he would be most happy to do all he could.</p>

<p>The judge slept badly that night, and the next morning, when
he took his seat on the Bench, it was noticed he was paler than
usual. The court was crowded. Lady Hylden was not present, but
both Sir Miles and Dr. Carnarvon were. Sir Miles looked
vindictively confident, but the doctor, though he tried not to
show it, was obviously ill at ease. The spectators, generally,
having little doubt what the judgment was going to be, thought
it very plucky on the doctor's part, to be intending to receive
the blow in public.</p>

<p>In a profound and impressive silence, the judge commenced in
calm, unhurried tones. He regretted, he said, that none of the
parties to the case had impressed him very favorably, as,
undoubtedly, much of the testimony given had been exaggerated,
even to the point of deliberate falsehood. The petitioner had
exaggerated to support his contention of the respondents' guilt,
and they had exaggerated in their insistence on their
innocence.</p>

<p>Referring specifically to the petitioner, the judge went on,
it was surely hard to credit that, if the guilty association of
his wife with Dr. Carnarvon had been continuing for so long, he
would have had no suspicions of what was happening until the
full realisation of it came to him on that particular
night&mdash;as he put it&mdash;with the suddenness of a clap of
thunder.</p>

<p>He had admitted, he had allowed&mdash;even more than
that&mdash;that he had encouraged Dr. Carnarvon to be his wife's
escort on many occasions. Himself engrossed in business matters,
he had asked the doctor to deputise for him, and, in
consequence, the two had gone about together to pictures,
theatres, concerts, and other public functions. His contention
was that his only motive had been to give his wife pleasure, and
that he was exposing her to danger had never entered into his
mind.</p>

<p>Yet, the petitioner was a shrewd, alert, and far-seeing man,
as was evidenced by his business successes, and, surely, it
would have been imagined, he would have been one of the last
persons not to have noticed what was going on under his very
eyes, and seen whither things were leading. Turning to the
matter of the co-respondent's innocence or guilt, the judge said
he was faced with another problem, as he had to ask himself if
it were possible, a single, unattached man of Dr. Carnarvon's
age could have been so much in the company of so attractive a
woman as Lady Hylden without any feelings beyond those of mere
friendship being aroused. If so, the question was&mdash;with the
many opportunities he had had&mdash;had he kept those feelings
under wise and proper control? Was it probable he had?</p>

<p>Coming to the disappearance of Lady Hylden's maid, His Honor
said, he was not putting that in the scales as determining
either innocence or guilt, as it was impossible to say which
side her evidence would have favored. Certainly, placed in the
witness-box, her evidence might have gone far to prove the
wife's guilt; on the other hand, however, might it not have
helped to establish her innocence? Without knowing which party
to the action&mdash;if, indeed, either party&mdash;were
responsible for this shameful attempt to impede the course of
justice, he, the judge, would have to ignore the incident
altogether.</p>

<p>After speaking for upwards of an hour, he gave his judgment
in one short sentence, which exploded like a bomb in the court.
"Viewing all the circumstances, I am not satisfied the case for
the petitioner has been made out, and therefore do not grant the
petition for the dissolution of the marriage."</p>

<p>For a few seconds a stunned and amazed silence followed, and,
then, an almost audible sigh of relief rippled round. Sir Miles
was seen to be absolutely purple in his fury, while Dr.
Carnarvon's face was white and unsmiling.</p>

<p>That same evening the judge was about to sit down to dinner,
when his wife came in from answering the telephone. "It was Dr.
Bentley," she said. "He rang up to say Sir Miles had a stroke of
apoplexy half an hour ago, and passed away almost at once."</p>

<p>His Honor did not appear to be much interested. "Only what
might have been expected," he remarked. "He looked that type of
man."</p>

<p>The daughter of the house, the judge's only child, came in.
She was a good-looking girl of 21, and the apple of her father's
eye. "Oh, dad," she exclaimed with animation, "I've something
which will interest you. Jean Matthews and I were having lunch
today at the Old Grotto cafe, and at a table near us was such a
handsome young officer in Merchant Navy uniform. I did so admire
him, and&mdash;" she laughed merrily,&mdash;"I think he was
interested in me, because he kept looking in our direction."</p>

<p>The judge was examining the pattern of the carpet, but he
glanced up affectionately at her. "And wasn't that quite
natural?" he smiled. "Aren't you worth looking at?"</p>

<p>"But that's not what I want to tell you," she went on. She
spoke impressively. "This boy, dad, was so much like you. He had
your shaped head, your eyes, and his hair was even wavy like
yours. The likeness was so striking."</p>

<p>"Then I must be a type," smiled the judge, and he turned the
conversation by asking her how she was getting on with her golf.

<h2><a id="DOP-1944-05-20"></a>SEEDTIME AND HARVEST</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 20 May 1944.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">THE earth is ever a hard master, and the farm
was one of that number in Australia, not very distant from a
township and yet far enough away to make life lonely for those
living in it. He had purposely come home late and night had well
fallen when his boots clattered outside the lobby door. He was a
big and rather coarse-looking man of 34.</p>

<p>Entering the kitchen he gave his wife a quick look and then
turned away his eyes. "I'm late," he remarked carelessly. "I
stopped to finish a bit of fencing." He pulled off his sodden
boots. "The creek's high tonight and there's more rain
coming."</p>

<p>His wife nodded understandingly, but made no comment. She was
an unusually good-looking girl and more than 10 years her
husband's junior. She had a good profile, a faultless
complexion, and big, clear dark-blue eyes.</p>

<p>There was a suggestion of hardness, however, about her
otherwise very pretty mouth. Her figure was supple and
beautifully proportioned.</p>

<p>"Tea's ready," she said quietly, and they sat down to what
was almost a silent meal. They were both of reserved
dispositions and it was never their habit to talk much. They had
been married six months, and he was quite aware she had never
really had any affection for him, becoming his wife only on her
parents' persuasion.</p>

<p>His farm was prosperous, and the bargain had been he would
make them an allowance on her marrying him. So, after some
considerable urging, she had done what would be best for
them.</p>

<p>"You've knocked your knuckles," she said presently. "How did
you come to hurt them?"</p>

<p>"Tightening a nut on the drill," he replied. "It's nothing
much, just taken the skin off."</p>

<p>"But I must put some plaster on," she said. "They don't look
nice, and you can't work with them like that."</p>

<p>She had been a nurse before their marriage, and the contents
of a small cupboard in their bedroom provided for most
emergencies.</p>

<p>The night was cold, and the meal finished and the washing-up
over, they sat before the fire. He smoked meditatively and she
read. Occasionally they exchanged a few words, but she never
kept her eyes lifted very long from her book.</p>

<p>Presently he stretched himself and yawned. "I think I'll go
to bed," he said. "The cold's made me feel sleepy," and he rose
to his feet and looked at her interrogatively. "Coming?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she replied. "I'll read a little longer."</p>

<p>He went alone into the bedroom and, to his surprise, because
it was not his usual habit to do so, found himself dropping off
to sleep almost at once. Then, to his amazement, the next thing
of which he was conscious was seeing daylight through the window
and hearing his wife laying the breakfast things in the
adjoining room.</p>

<p>He had slept the whole night through without stirring. He
looked at the impression of his wife's head on the pillow beside
him, and wondered how it was she had managed to come to bed and
also get up without waking him. But he was under no illusion
that her carefulness had not been of set purpose.</p>

<p>"The devil," he frowned, as he jumped hurriedly out of bed,
"but I couldn't have slept sounder if I'd been drugged."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SOME forty years later the morning train pulled
up at a little railway siding 300 and more miles from Sydney,
and a middle-aged man in semi-clerical attire alighted. He was
slight in build, with a thin, ascetic face, and his expression
was mild and very gentle.</p>

<p>His eyes were of a peculiar light-blue forget-me-not color.
His clothes were shiny and well worn, and he carried a small
leather bag, equally as shabby. By calling he was a lay
missionary, and for many years his work had lain among the
lesser known Pacific islands.</p>

<p>A big, heavy framed man, with a weather-beaten face, and clad
in rough working clothes was standing on the platform and he
came forward at once. "Hullo, Peter," he exclaimed, as he held
out a large and earth-grimed hand. "I should have recognised you
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tom," returned the missionary, and the hand he gave
was small and delicate in contrast with that of his brother's.
"How's dad?"</p>

<p>"Crook," said Tom. He grinned, "Or he wouldn't have asked for
you. Doctor says he may go any day now."</p>

<p>He led the way to a small, ramshackle dog cart with a very
old pony between the shafts, and they both mounted and settled
themselves down for the six-mile journey to the farm.</p>

<p>"How's mother?" asked the missionary, wincing at the fierce
blow his brother had given to the pony.</p>

<p>"Always grumbling. The rheumatics have got her and she works
too hard. We can't afford to pay for any help."</p>

<p>"Then, isn't the farm doing well?"</p>

<p>"No, the sand's drifted over all the best paddocks," and the
big man whipped up the pony again with an oath which made the
missionary wince for the second time.</p>

<p>The conversation languished and, as they drove along, the
missionary's eyes roved sadly over the countryside. Every hill,
creek, and paddock was familiar to him, and the memories were
unhappy ones.</p>

<p>It was 20 years since he had left home, and for all that time
he had not seen his parents. The eldest born, and always frail
and delicate as a boy, and totally unfit for farm work, his
father had never taken to him and, eventually, he had left home
for Sydney to train as a school teacher.</p>

<p>Of a serious disposition, however, missionary work had
appealed to him; and he had gone to the islands, living a life
of hardship and privation, but with his heart and soul in his
labors.</p>

<p>Some months previously his mother had written him his father
was in very poor health, and that he must come at once if he
wanted to see him before he died. With some difficulty, he had
obtained a substitute and made the long journey with what speed
he could.</p>

<p>Arriving at the farm, an old woman hobbled to the door. She
was bent and frail and with a shrivelled, yellow skin. Hardship
and unceasing toil had taken a dreadful toll of her, but it was
obvious she had been anything but ill-looking once, for her
profile was good and her eyes were a beautiful dark blue.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter," she exclaimed querulously as the missionary bent
down and kissed her, "how old you've grown!"</p>

<p>"But 20 years, mother!" he laughed. "What else could you
expect?" His face sobered. "But how's dad?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "A sick man. His heart's failing and he
may go any day now. I expected you would come too late to see
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, then I'll go straight in to him," said Peter.</p>

<p>"No, no," said his mother quickly, "he's asleep, and you
mustn't wake him. Besides, I'm just going to dish up the dinner,
and your brothers can't wait. They have their work to do."</p>

<p>Two other men tramped in noisily and shook hands heartily
with the missionary. They were almost the facsimile of the one
who had met him at the railway station, with the same red face,
the same big bodies, and the same horny, earth-grimed hands.
They were merry, jovial fellows, and looked full of life.</p>

<p>They all sat down to the meal. The missionary ate very
little, but the other brothers ate hungrily consuming everything
with great gusto. They seemed, too, in a tremendous hurry, as if
they were all going to catch trains, washing down everything
quickly with cup after cup of steaming, milkless tea.</p>

<p>When they talked it was only about crops and cows who were
expecting calves and of a sow who would have to be killed
because she was beginning to get short in her litters.</p>

<p>And the whole time they were regarding their brother with
amused and covert smiles, kicking one another furtively under
the table, as if he were something of a joke to them. The meal
finished, they rushed off, and Peter was taken in to see his
father, the mother leaving the two to have their talk
together.</p>

<p>The old man's lips were very blue and he spoke faintly. "I
wanted to see you, Peter," he said slowly, "because I've got
something on my mind and I felt I must tell somebody." He paused
a long moment. "Forty years ago I killed a man."</p>

<p>His son's mouth gaped. "But by accident, of course, dad!" he
exclaimed quickly.</p>

<p>"No, no, on purpose," was the grim reply. "I had meant to
kill him if ever I got the chance, for he was coming after your
mother, and I knew he'd get her if I didn't.</p>

<p>"One afternoon I had a fight with him by the creek and
stunned him with an axe. Then I threw him into the creek to
drown. His body was carried into the river and never found."</p>

<p>"Oh, dad, dad, how could you?" exclaimed the missionary in
great distress.</p>

<p>"He worked in a bank," went on the old man, "and had been
your mother's sweetheart before I married her, and he used to
come up here much more than I liked, for it made her cold
towards me.</p>

<p>"Then, one afternoon, when he thought I'd be away, I caught
him creeping up behind the trees in the big paddock. He tried to
make out he'd come to ask me to lend him money, as he'd been
robbing the bank and was going to be found out.</p>

<p>"That he'd robbed the bank was quite true, but it was your
mother he was after then, and we had some words and I struck him
down."</p>

<p>"My God, my God," exclaimed Peter, his voice choking, "and
you've been keeping this dreadful secret for all these
years!"</p>

<p>"But it hasn't worried me at all until lately," went on the
old man, "and it doesn't worry me much now. I know I did right,
for he would have ruined my home. Then, when he came no more,
your mother altered towards me, and a year after he was dead you
were born."</p>

<p>He spoke bitterly. "Still, he must have been always in her
memory, because when you came I saw you had got his eyes. Yours
are just the same light-blue color as his were. Your mother
never dreamed that I've noticed it, but I have, and that's why I
never took to you and was glad when you went away."</p>

<p>His voice grew fainter. "But go away now. I want to sleep.
I'll have another talk with you later," and Peter went out and
prayed that his father might be granted longer life to show true
repentance for his sin.</p>

<p>That night after supper, when the old man was still sleeping
and the other brothers were in bed, his mother said to Peter,
"And, of course, dad only wanted to see you to confess that he'd
killed Les Donelly."</p>

<p>Peter gasped. "Oh, mother, then did you know? Oh, what a
terrible secret for you to have had to keep to yourself!"</p>

<p>She nodded spitefully. "Fiddlesticks, there was no such
secret to keep! He didn't kill him, though for a punishment I've
let him think so all these years.</p>

<p>"I was among the trees that afternoon and saw him throw Les
in the creek, but I dragged Les out when he was swept beyond the
bend, and he didn't die until three years later, when he was
killed in the Boer War."</p>

<p>"And so he wasn't drowned after all," exclaimed the
missionary in great relief.</p>

<p>The old woman laughed scoffingly. "No, not he, and I kept him
hidden for three months in that old hut which used to be among
the willows. No one ever learnt he was there, and I nursed him
until he had got over the hurt your father had given him and I
had scraped enough money from the housekeeping to give him to
get safely away."</p>

<p>A wistful look came into her eyes. "He was a fine lad, but he
was wanted by the police." She nodded again. "Well, as your
father's broken his silence at last, I'll tell him everything
tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I will, for I've never had any love for him,
though he's made me bear him those three lumping sons," and the
missionary went out and prayed now that the old man might
die.</p>

<p>That night, in answer to Peter's prayer, the angel of death
passed by, and the old man died without his wife having had
speech with him again. In the morning, when the missionary was
shaving, he sighed heavily, for, as he looked in the mirror, he
thought his eyes were of a lighter blue than ever.</p>

</div>
<br>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 3 June 1944.</h3>

<p class="first">IN the year after the end of the Much Greater
War, Dr. Julius Revire was upon a visit to his compatriot, Count
Bornski. One of the few members of the Polish aristocracy to
have survived the war with any means at all, the count was
living in Devonshire. He was married to a beautiful young girl
still in her teens, and they had been blessed with as lovely a
little son as ever gladdened any parents' hearts.</p>

<p>Yet, after only a few hours with them, the doctor realised
there was a shadow over the house. Certainly it was obvious the
count worshipped his young wife and that she was devoted to him.
Also, the wife's mother, who lived with them, was held in
affectionate regard. Still, they were not a happy family, they
seldom smiled, and in repose their faces were grave and solemn.
The glorious little son, too, seemed to have brought them no
happiness, and they received the doctor's praises of the child's
beauty with no pride or enthusiasm.</p>

<p>One night at dinner the count opened a bottle of fine old
French Burgundy, and, as it were, forced himself into an
appearance of gaiety. He related to his wife and her mother how
the doctor had once saved his life.</p>

<p>"It was in a jungle in the heart of the Belgian Congo," he
said, "and I was literally sick unto death. Two days before I
had trodden on a scorpion and it had bitten me in the sole of
the foot. I had no one by me except an incapable native bearer.
I was in agony and could do nothing to the wound, because of its
position and my leg being enormously swollen right up to the
hip. I am sure I was about to shoot myself, for I had my loaded
revolver in my hand&mdash;when lo and behold! out into the
clearing marched the doctor, with a whole army of bearers,
carrying stores." He shuddered. "Oh, he was cruel, this doctor
here! He lanced me every five minutes with his wicked little
knife."</p>

<p>"But I had to," laughed the doctor, "or you wouldn't have
been here now." He made a grimace. "Never have I seen such a
dreadful foot, before or since. It was swollen as big as a
bison's head, and in the night it used to haunt me in my dreams.
For months I couldn't get it out of my mind, and I have always
thought since that it was one of the best remembered objects of
that long journey of mine."</p>

<p>The air of gloom over the house continuing to be so
depressing, the doctor taxed his friend about it. "What's the
matter with you all, Edmond?" he asked sharply. "You all seem as
if you were in some great trouble. What is it?"</p>

<p>The Count started. "You've noticed it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Noticed it!" exclaimed the doctor. "Why, you are all going
about as if you were under sentence of death. Tell me what it
means? Don't forget I'm a medical man as well as your
friend."</p>

<p>"Ah, so you are!" exclaimed the count. "I had forgotten
that." He hesitated a moment and then burst out, "Listen,
Julius. I'll tell you as terrible a story as any husband could
ever tell."</p>

<p>He went on slowly: "Now, you know something of the part I
played in that army raised among us prisoners by the Soviet
Union. Well, I had been given my regiment, and, about two months
before the war ended, was in the advance, as part of a battalion
driving back the Huns. One evening we arrived at a little town
which had been evacuated by the enemy a few days previously.
They had not gone far away, but, with a broad river running
between us and all the bridges blown up, were considering
themselves safe, at any rate for the moment. The wretches had
left the usual trail of blood and torture behind them, with
women and children butchered and a score or so of old men hanged
in the market-place.</p>

<p>"Darkness had fallen, and I had just finished my last meal in
the ruined house I was occupying, when an orderly came in to
tell me a peasant woman wanted to speak to me. She wouldn't
state her business, but said it was private and important. I had
her brought in, and she stood before me. Though she was roughly
dressed, I was impressed by her bearing.</p>

<p>"'Monsieur,' she said, 'will you do a very unhappy woman a
favor? In the chivalry of your great country will you help
me?'</p>

<p>"I asked her what she wanted, and she told me a harrowing
story. It appeared that when in possession of the town some
German officers had taken her daughter away and subjected her to
horrible ill-treatment. The girl, however, had managed to escape
from them and hidden herself in the forest until she had seen
them drive away. Then she had returned home.</p>

<p>"'But she will not believe they are gone for good, Monsieur.'
choked the woman, 'and is terrified they will come for her
again. She will not eat or sleep, and she will go mad unless we
can convince her she is safe. If you will come and speak to her
and let her see you, as the colonel in your uniform, she will
realise everything is all right.'"</p>

<p>The Count shrugged his shoulders. "I was good-natured and I
went. She led me to a little house and took me into a room where
her daughter was in bed." The Count heaved a big sigh. "My
friend, I was astounded. Never had I seen such a beautiful young
creature before! Certainly she looked ill, and her expression
was of one haunted by a great fear. Nothing however, could hide
the loveliness which was hers, the perfect features, the
glorious eyes, the exquisitely moulded lips, and the beautifully
poised little head. I knew she could be only about
seventeen.</p>

<p>"I sat down and talked to her. I stroked her hair and I
patted her hands. I told her she had nothing to be afraid of
now, for never would the vile Hun pollute that sacred soil
again, except as a slave. She was very brave and choked back her
tears, thanking me so prettily for having come to reassure her.
She said she would be able to sleep, now she knew I was near
her. I bade her good-bye, and her mother led me outside. Then I
got another surprise.</p>

<p>"'Monsieur, le Conte,' said the mother, and her voice was
hard as steel, 'will you do me another favor? Will you avenge my
daughter's shame?'</p>

<p>"She went on fiercely, 'I want those men killed. There are
five of them, and they lie tonight not seven miles from here.
They are in a house by themselves on the outskirts of a village.
I have a man ready who will guide you across the river by a
secret ford. Oh, go and kill them!' she pleaded. 'You are brave
and I know adventure will not frighten you.'</p>

<p>"I liked the idea, and, after a few moments' consideration,
asked, 'But this guide of yours, how do you know he can be
trusted?'</p>

<p>"'Trusted!' she scoffed. Her eyes blazed. 'Why, he would as
soon betray his God as be false to me! He has served my family
all his life.'</p>

<p>"Well, to make a long story short, I did as she asked me. We
took the five German officers prisoners without arousing the
village. One by one, bound and gagged, I had them led out behind
the house. I whispered a few words into the ear of each, so that
he should know for what he was being killed, and then butchered
him with my dagger like a sheep. The next morning I sent the
girl's mother five blood-fouled swastikas cut from the wretches'
uniforms, so that she should know that her daughter's shame had
been avenged."</p>

<p>The Count went on with a frown: "The next night the mother
came to me again. 'Monsieur,' she said, 'you have done me two
favors and I want you to do me a third, a greater one this
time,' and then, to my amazement, she asked me to marry her
daughter.</p>

<p>"'I know you are not married or even affianced,' she said
quickly, seeing I was too dumbfounded to speak, 'for I have ways
of learning many things in this unhappy country, and I have made
inquiries. So, if you are heart-whole, Monsieur, take pity, for
it is probably a matter of life or death for my child.'</p>

<p>"'But she is in no danger now!' I exclaimed in bewilderment.
Then what is she afraid of?'</p>

<p>"'She is afraid, Monsieur'&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;'she is
afraid that, as a girl unwed, she may become&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Good God!' I exclaimed, 'it is most improbable.'</p>

<p>"'Improbable, but not impossible,' said the mother, 'and it
has become the only thought in her mind. She does not eat, she
does not sleep, and I hear her sobbing in the night. Remember,
she is convent-reared, Monsieur, and is fearing Heaven will be
denied her if what she so dreads should happen, when her
motherhood has not been sanctified by the rites of the
Church.'</p>

<p>"'But Madame,' I remonstrated, 'however beautiful your
daughter may be, and I admit I cannot conceive anyone more
lovely, I could not bring into a proud family such as mine a
bride of whom I know so little.'</p>

<p>"Instantly she smiled, and bending over to me whispered who
she was. It is not necessary for me to give you her name, but I
assure you, Julius, she was not very far from the steps of a
throne. She went on quickly, 'With you, Monsieur, I know it will
make no difference, but another might be influenced by learning
that her dowry will be a hundred thousand crowns. We have
property in England and it cannot be taken from us.'</p>

<p>"I still hesitated, and she urged pleadingly, 'Oh, do have
pity on the child! If you do not wish it you can leave her at
the church door and never see her again.' She raised her hand
warningly. 'And don't forget, Monsieur, a soldier's life is
never sure. You may be killed in the next battle, even in the
next few hours, and then at the Day of Judgment you will stand
blessed by this crowning act of pity.'"</p>

<p>The Count nodded. "She had touched the right chord. Any hour
we might be hurled against the Hun again and my good fortune
might not always hold. Yes, I would bring comfort to this child,
and one man should, in part, at all events, atone for the wrong
done by others. I told the mother I would do as she wished, and,
thanking me tearfully, she said Anna would be at the church in
twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"Anna!" exclaimed the doctor. "The Countess! But I thought it
must be she!"</p>

<p>The Count nodded and went on: "It was a strange wedding in
that ruined church, and the only lights were the candles on the
altar." He smiled. "I would not swear the priest was not our
guide of the previous night, as both in figure and voice they
were very similar. Well, the service over, I reverently kissed
my bride. 'Good-bye, little one,' I whispered, 'and the best of
fortune to you.'</p>

<p>"'Good-bye!' she laughed, 'but it is not going to be good-bye
yet. There's our wedding supper to be eaten and a bottle of rare
wine to toast ourselves with. No, my husband, you are coming
home with me. The good things are all laid out and ready.'"</p>

<p>The Count shrugged his shoulders and smiled. "What could I
do? Of course, I went and&mdash;stayed. We had a week's
honeymoon before my regiment was sent forward again, and during
those few days I came to love my child-wife devotedly. Every
hour I seemed to find more endearing qualities in her. She
reciprocated my affection, too, and hated me to be out of her
sight. When we parted she was heartbroken, but we had the hope
the war would end soon and that then I should join them in
England, to which they were expecting to escape any day. They
had great influence.</p>

<p>"You know most of the rest. Shortly afterwards I was wounded,
and lay in hospital for nearly two months. Then one day I
received a letter from my wife, written from here, and imploring
me to come to her as soon as I possibly could. Her mother
enclosed a short note, explaining everything.</p>

<p>"A fortnight later I arrived, and then, notwithstanding all
the happiness of reunion, began an anxious time for us all. We
never dared to speak our thoughts, but you can realise what was
always in our minds. Oh, how we prayed the child would be like
me! It was agony to think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know, my poor friend," broke in the doctor. "You
need not put it into words."</p>

<p>The Count heaved a big sigh. "And you see what has
happened&mdash;a perfect child, a most beautiful baby, but
exactly like his mother, all his mother and with no features of
mine. We all want to love him, to snatch him up and cover him
with caresses. We long to give him the fondness which every
little child should have, and yet every time I take him in my
arms I have to repress a shudder. And I can see it is the same
with my poor wife and her mother. They dare not let their
feelings go." He gripped the doctor by the arm. "And the tragedy
is it will go on for ever. We shall never be certain. We shall
never know. We are a stricken family and our unhappiness is
without end."</p>

<p>The doctor was most grieved at his friends distress, but,
seeing he could give no consolation, privately determined to
make his visit as short as possible. The following afternoon the
child was lying on a rug, stretched out upon the lawn, gurgling
and cooing and kicking out his little legs as all babies do. The
Count was kneeling on the rug, by his side. The mother, the
grandmother, and the doctor were seated near, watching all that
was going on. The expressions upon the faces of the two women
were inscrutable.</p>

<p>Suddenly the doctor started, he frowned heavily, and then,
rising quickly to his feet, moved over and picked up the baby.
"Now that's funny!" he exclaimed, and his voice rose in
excitement as he held out one little pink foot for them all to
inspect. "You've all noticed that haven't you?" he went on,
pointing to a small, star-shaped mole on the outer edge of the
sole, just in front of the heel.</p>

<p>"I should say we have," commented the grandmother, rather
irritably. "One doesn't bath a baby every day for nearly six
months and not notice every mark he's got."</p>

<p>"Well," smiled the doctor, "it's exactly the same shape as
the mole his father has on the sole of HIS foot, and, funnily
enough it's exactly in the same place." He chuckled gleefully.
"There's a wonderful case of heredity, if you like, the child
being stamped with his father's seal! Really, I've never seen
anything so exactly similar before!"</p>

<p>A stunned silence followed. The two women were pale as death
and stared saucer-eyed, first at the doctor and then at the
baby's foot.</p>

<p>The Count stammered incredulously: "Have I a mole there, too?
I've never seen it."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you have," laughed the doctor, "for you
couldn't without a looking-glass. But I've seen it hundreds of
times. It was part of those dreadful dreams your awful foot gave
me after you had been bitten by that scorpion." He thrust the
baby into his mother's arms. "Here, Edmond, off with that left
shoe and sock. I'll show everybody I've not forgotten those
dreadful nightmares."</p>

<p>Pushing the Count down on to his back upon the lawn, in a
trice Dr. Revire was holding up his friend's naked foot. "There
it is, as plain as a pikestaff!" he exclaimed triumphantly, "and
exactly where the baby's got his. I knew my recollection was
good, even after all these years. See, too, where I was, as he
says, so cruel with my wicked little knife?"</p>

<p>The Countess and her mother had darted forward, for a few
seconds to stare down open-mouthed at the upturned sole of the
Count's foot. Then, with a loud cry, the young wife clutched the
baby tightly to her and began covering him with fierce and
passionate kisses. The grandmother tottered back, half-fainting,
and sank into her chair.</p>

<p>"Here, Edmond," called out the doctor, laughingly, "if you
want your shoe you'll have to come and catch me for it," and he
ran across the lawn and pretended to hide among the trees. He
thought it kindest to leave the family to recover their
composure by themselves.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1944-06-17"></a>BUGGY'S BABIES</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 17 June 1944.</h3>

<p class="first">BLACK as night was Buggy, the Scotch terrier,
of Mudside Farm, and surely never was there a more picturesque,
ugly little dog. His huge head seemed many times too big for his
slender little body, his legs were short and stumpy, and his
flat, squat paws of an enormous size. His rough and shaggy coat
was as thick as the thickest mat you could ever see.</p>

<p>For all his ugliness, however, everybody loved him, and,
directly they caught sight of him, all children and most grown-ups,
too, wanted to snatch him up and give him a good hug.
Notwithstanding his sad and melancholy eyes, like pools of
blackest ink, he was a jovial, merry little fellow, and inclined
to be friendly with everyone.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;Buggy was a killer. Of the five cats on the farm,
however, he took only a contemptuous notice, but woe betide any
strange courting Tom who came sneaking round at night to say
"How-do-you-do?" to them. Buggy had no sympathy with feline
romance. Always ready for a fight, he was game as a pebble, and
would give battle to dogs five times his size. Then, if his
onslaught upon them were only that of a midget submarine, his
deep and thunderous growls were well worthy of a battleship, and
it was incredible how such fierce and awe-inspiring sounds could
issue from so small a stomach.</p>

<p>One morning Blackbeetle, the old sheepdog, spoke very
seriously to him. "See here, my son," he said sternly, "what did
you mean by coming home so late last night? Oh, yes, I heard
you, though you tried to sneak home, like master did a night or
two ago, when he'd been driving that pretty Mrs. Jenkins home,
and, instead, told mistress he was late because he'd had a
puncture."</p>

<p>"Oh, he drove her home, did he?" exclaimed Buggy, anxious to
turn the conversation. "Well, I wonder she let him, for I know
he drives much too fast for her."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" frowned Blackbeetle.</p>

<p>"I was under the back seat of the car one day last week,"
explained Buggy, "when he drove her down to get her mail, and I
heard her keep on telling him to 'Stop it.' She said several
times, 'No, you mustn't.'"</p>

<p>The elder dog looked pityingly at his young companion, but,
suppressing a grin, repeated his question. "Why did you come
home so late?" He scowled. "But I needn't ask. I know you had
been going after that Susie McBottle."</p>

<p>"And what if I had?" asked Buggy defiantly. "It's no business
of yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it!" exclaimed Blackbeetle warmly. "You know quite
well that I'm responsible for the good conduct of this yard, and
I won't have a young dog like you trapesing about after strange
females."</p>

<p>"But I've done no harm," protested Buggy. "We only just
rubbed noses through the fence."</p>

<p>"Because it was too high for either of you to jump over,"
sneered the sheepdog. He shook his head angrily. "You had no
business to start speaking to her. You don't know anything about
her people, and everybody says she's only a common dog-shop dog,
and cost about five shillings. I'm sure McBottle, the pig man,
wouldn't have paid more."</p>

<p>"But she's worth her weight in gold to me," said Buggy
grandly, "and I shall pay her attention if I want to."</p>

<p>"Ha, I don't think you will," scoffed Blackbeetle. "I heard
Master say you're to be chained up at night. He's very cross
about it."</p>

<p>A few days later Jock McBottle, a lean, raw-boned Scotchman,
a breeder of pigs, and smelling strongly of his calling, came
round to Mudside Farm and called out over the fence: "I say,
Farmer Ben, wot aboot makin' a match atween yer leetle Boogy and
ma Susie? She'd hav some bonnie poopies."</p>

<p>"I daresay," grunted Ben, who didn't like McBottle, but who,
all the same, was quite agreeable to make some money out of him.
"All right, but it'll cost you three guineas. My dog's a
pedigree animal, from Tut-Tut out of Cosey Corner."</p>

<p>"Three guineas be blamed!" snorted McBottle. "Why, to buy yer
Boogy he's no worth more than a few bob. Coom, now, mon, be
raisonable! I'll gie yer won of the poops."</p>

<p>Ben was furious, and then followed quite a heated and
acrimonious exchange of ideas, in which it came out that for
many months Ben's face and general appearance had been most
distasteful to Jock McBottle; also, according to Ben, that the
other's ancestry, at any rate on the maternal side, was little
different from that of his dog, Susie. Eventually, the two
gentlemen parted angrily, with the cryptic remark from the lean
Scotchman that anything might happen, and 'yer never can
tell.'</p>

<p>"No, you don't," shouted back Ben angrily. "There'll be none
of that. From now on my dog'll be kept on the chain night and
day, to make certain no bug-bitten Scotchman steals a pedigree
litter."</p>

<p>About a week later, however, Buggy slipped his chain during
the night, and in the morning was nowhere to be found. Directly
Ben knew it, he got out his car and drove over to
McBottle's.</p>

<p>"Here you," he bawled out angrily, striding without ceremony
into the pig-yard, "have you decoyed my dog away? If you have, I
tell you straight, I'll have the law on you, quick and lively."
He shook his fist in McBottle's face. "You dirty thief."</p>

<p>"Dirty thief yerself!" shrieked the Scotchman, jumping about
like a scalded cat. "It'll be me wot'll be dragging yer into
court for heavy damages. Where's ma leetle Susie gone? She's no
been seen since yester morn, and it's ma opeenion it's yer and
yer immoral abdoocting dorg who're at the bottom of it. Where's
Susie gone I want to ken."</p>

<p>For a long time Ben was unbelieving, but a thorough search
over the pig premises and the weeping corroboration of their
loss by the Scotsman's nine dirty-faced little children at last
convinced him, and he went swearing and fuming away.</p>

<p>That night it started to rain heavily, and, when all the
McBottle children were asleep and their father was just
undressing by taking off his boots, hoarse and snappy barks were
heard outside the gate.</p>

<p>"That'll not be our Susie," frowned McBottle to his wife,
"but what for is any dawg to coom barking round here tonight I
canna think. I'll gang oot and see," and he quickly got dressed
again by resuming his boots. Lighting a lantern, he crossed the
yard to find to his great astonishment Buggy by the fence.
Buggy's little legs were mired to his stomach, and his
bedraggled coat was sodden with the pouring rain. He proceeded
to bark loudly.</p>

<p>"Git oot, yer noisy leetle baste," shouted McBottle. "Go awa
at wonce," and he threw stones and threatened him with a stick.
But Buggy would not budge, and continuing to bark hoarsely,
would not go away.</p>

<p>McBottle's massive spouse arrived to see what was happening.
"Nay, nay, mon," she called out, "dinna drive him awa. Maybe
he's followed Susie by her scent and found her with a broken
leg. He's coom to take yer where she is."</p>

<p>"By goom, yer may be right!" exclaimed the excited Scotsman.
"I'll awa wi' him and see whaur he goes."</p>

<p>"But wrap yersel' oop well, Jock," warned his wife. "The
rain's fair cruel, and yer'll want two sacks over yer to keep
dry."</p>

<p>Jock saddled his old pony and rode out of the yard, swinging
a hurricane lantern to light the way. Buggy seemed to know
exactly what was wanted of him, and set off up the road at a
good pace, looking back, however, many times to make sure that
he was being followed. Presently he left the road and turned up
along the side of a swiftly running creek.</p>

<p>"Ah, and it's oop in the hills we're going," muttered the
soaked Scotsman. "Then the poor, wet dawgie is sure caught in a
rabbit trap."</p>

<p>It was an awful ride, with the rain continuing to pour down
in sheets. Mile after mile they went, until McBottle reckoned
they had come a good four miles from home. Still, he had given
quite a lot of his dour love to his dog, and, hopeful now that
he would be finding her, gave no thought to anything else. And,
sure enough, at last he did find her, a drenched and shivering
little creature lying by a rabbit warren, with one of her feet
held fast in the cruel jaws of a trap. She whimpered feebly when
the light of the lantern fell upon her, and tried to wag her
tail. Buggy licked her face and then jumped round delightedly,
barking hoarse, snappy barks.</p>

<p>"Puir leetle lassie," almost sobbed the Scotsman as he
released Susie from the trap and gathered her up in his arms.
"Oh, but yer have had a bad cruel time!" He turned down to
Buggy, who now made no attempt to get away, and patted him, too.
"Yer a fine, wee dawgie, my boy, and it's a gude hot sooper yer
shall have for this."</p>

<p>With both dogs cuddled up under his arm and warmed by the
shelter of the sacks, he jogged back home much quicker than he
had come. His wife was overjoyed, and cuddled Buggy almost as
much as she did her own dog. They were both well dried before
the fire, given warm milk, and&mdash;oh, joy of joys&mdash;had a
saucer of pig's liver placed before them.</p>

<p>"And yer'll no be taking him back home tonicht, Jock?" asked
the wife, indicating Buggy.</p>

<p>"Nay, not tonicht," replied Jock. He gave her a crafty look.
"Nor tomorrow nicht, nor the nicht after." He dropped his voice
to a whisper. "Leetle Boogy will be our guest for a leetle while
in the barn by the far paddock. Nay, nay, the bairns is not to
ken. We'll keep it from everyone." He shook his head angrily.
"Yon swearing farmer-mon called me a scratching Scotch
scoundrel, and, by goom, I'll be one the noo."</p>

<p>So, it was a week and longer before Buggy saw Mudside Farm
again. Then, late one night, he was dropped about a quarter of a
mile from his home and given a friendly kick to hasten back
there. His coat was well matted with dust and burrs, and round
his neck was what McBottle considered a most artistic piece of
work, a collar of a piece of dirty rope with a frayed end
hanging down to give all appearance that Buggy had broken away
from somewhere.</p>

<p>After barking outside the farmhouse door to announce his
return. Buggy was received with great joy by his master and
mistress, as they had long since given up all hope of seeing him
again. Notwithstanding that he was ravenously hungry, another
piece of artistic work on McBottle's part, and speedily got rid
of a substantial meal, the farmer had his suspicions at once.
"Darn it all," he swore viciously, "he smells of pig!"</p>

<p>A man of quick action when his temper was roused, the first
thing the next morning Ben was round at the pig farm and,
striding angrily into the yard, was not at all surprised to see
McBottle's little Scotch terrier there. The children were busy,
petting and patting her.</p>

<p>"And when did you find her?" he asked sneeringly of the
eldest one, a girl of about 12, rawboned and freckled like her
father.</p>

<p>"Oh, she coom back last night," exclaimed the girl excitedly.
"Some bad mon had stolen her and she were half-starved. She had
a rope tied round her neck."</p>

<p>In the light of Ben's suspicions this information was highly
disconcerting, as he thought the girl was not old enough to lie
plausibly. Besides, the other children were crowding round so
eagerly to fondle the little dog that it was obvious her
presence was something of a novelty to them. The Scotchman's
wife came out and corroborated her daughter's story with much
detail.</p>

<p>"But where's your husband?" snapped Ben.</p>

<p>"Gone oot to the poleece station," replied the wife
instantly, "to offer a beeg reward to find oot who took Susie.
He's determined to have the villains poot in gaol."</p>

<p>Ben returned home puzzled, but still suspicious. He was sure
McBottle would have offered no 'beeg reward' if there had been
the slightest chance of anyone claiming it, and his suspicions
were by no means dissipated by a conversation he had with the
Scotchman when the latter called round at the farm that same
afternoon.</p>

<p>"I hear yer Boogy's coom back, too," he shouted over the gate
with a great affectation of friendliness, "and it's a happy
thing we've got our pets back." He gritted his teeth angrily.
"Still, I'm detarmined to have the law on the scoondrels, and
I've told them at the poleece station it'll be a coople of
five-pun notes for anywon who catches them."</p>

<p>At that moment Buggy came running up and began jumping round
the pig-breeder in the most friendly fashion. "He seems to know
you pretty well," scowled Ben. "That's funny, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Nay, not at all," laughed McBottle. "All animals take to me.
They ken I'm their friend."</p>

<p>Ben saw it was useless to lose his temper, but asked
sarcastically, "And about those puppies, have you brought the
three guineas with you?"</p>

<p>The Scotchman shook his head. "I ha thought better of it.
Boogy's pedigree don't quite satisfy me and I'll be looking for
something better. Gude morning to yer and gude luck," and he
rode away, hardly trying to suppress one of the broadest of
grins.</p>

<p>Some months went by, and then a neighbour brought round to
Ben a copy of the local newspaper. "See this," he said, pointing
to an advertisement on the front page. "That McBottle's taken to
breeding pedigree Scotch terriers, as well as those
scrofulous-looking pigs of his."</p>

<p>Ben took the paper from him and his eyes opened very wide as
he read the advertisement: "On Friday next at the Burra Market,
by the favor of Jock McBottle, Esq., of Pigsty Stud Farm,
Silverbody &amp; Lively will auction seven pedigree Scotch
terriers by Hush-Hush out of Bonnie Hieland Lassie. Reserve
price four guineas each."</p>

<p>Ben's face was black as thunder, but he made no particular
comment. He was not the kind of man who like people to think
anyone had got the better of him.</p>

<p>On Friday evening he came home from market in a very
chastened frame of mind. "There is no doubt about it," he said
gloomily to his wife. "They are Buggy's puppies right enough;
they are so exactly like him that I wished I hadn't taken him in
with me. Everyone could see they were his, and they were all
laughing. And, what's more&mdash;"he almost choked in his
rage&mdash;"that scoundrel McBottle was stalking about as bold
as brass, if you please, taking orders for the next litter. Why,
I'm almost of a mind to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, we'll have none of that," said his wife firmly. "You'll
be sensible and get a proper mate for Buggy. That's what you've
got to do."</p>

<p>That night Blackbeetle, the sheepdog, spoke very solemnly to
Buggy over their evening bones. "You told me a lot of skites, my
son," he said sadly, "about where you were that week when you
were away, but I don't blame you. When you're sweethearting I
know it's not considered wrong to tell whackers when you are
shielding the other party. It's not like telling a lie when
you've taken another dog's bone and say you haven't seen it.
Still, you know I'm your friend, and, with my experience in
those matters, I do think you might have told me a bit more and
not let everything come to me as such a surprise."</p>

<p>Buggy hung his head. "But it wasn't all my secret,
Blackbeetle, and even now I can't tell you everything.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say no more about it son," broke in Blackbeetle. "Really, I
ought not to have referred to it." He looked down his nose. "In
my days I was a bit of a dog of the world, too, and I quite
understand." A thought struck him. "But I say, did the pups look
like you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," sighed Buggy. "They are very handsome!"</p>

<p>"And how did master take it?" asked the sheepdog.</p>

<p>Buggy grinned. "He picked me up by the scruff of the neck and
said that if he thought I understood he'd give me a dose of the
strap, but, when he had gone out mistress kissed me on the
forehead and gave me a piece of biscuit."</p>

<p>"That's it, that's it," exclaimed Blackbeetle excitedly,
"just what I would have expected she would do. A woman always
loves the bad man, and, if she's not the one to suffer, is
always ready to make excuses for him."</p>

<p>He laughed derisively. "Of course, she thinks it was little
Susie who led you astray. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

</div>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 23 September 1944.</h3>

<p class="first">THE Rev. Samuel Popplecockle ought never to
have been a clergyman, and no one realised it better than did he
himself.</p>

<p>It was not that he was not a good little man&mdash;he was
only 5 ft. 4 in. in his boots&mdash;for he was good and moral in
all respects. In all his life he had only kissed one girl, and
she his wife. He drank only water, tea, and big glasses of milk,
and he had never had a penny on a horse. He was good tempered
too, kind-hearted, and in every way inoffensive. The mistake was
he had taken orders, not as a calling, but just as a pleasant
and not over-laborious way of earning his living.</p>

<p>It was all his Uncle Ebenezer's fault, and that gentleman had
a lot to answer for. When Sammy left school&mdash;he was always
Sammy then&mdash;he went first into a broker's office in the
city, but he was not considered sharp enough there and, after a
month's trial, was told his services were no longer required. He
next went into a bank, but there he got on no better and no
bouquets were showered upon him when he left.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Ebenezer came upon the scene. He was serious and
earnest and, from his appearance, it might perhaps have been
judged there was not much enjoyment in life. He told
Samuel&mdash;Samuel now&mdash;that his mission was the Church.
He led his nephew to believe that if he became a clergyman, in
due time in a parish of his own, he would become a leader of
men. He would rank almost as important as the doctor.</p>

<p>Certainly, Samuel was dazzled at the aspect, so temptingly
held out to him. He thought he would love to be a leader of men.
He was interested in sicknesses and accidents, too, and always
curious about other people's affairs. It might have been that at
present he did not feel equal to presiding at meetings and all
that, but his uncle assured him it would come, that he would
rise to the occasions and do important work in the world.</p>

<p>So, at Uncle Ebenezer's expense, he was sent to a theological
college to be trained, and in due time was ordained. As a curate
in a city parish he was not much of a success, though people
liked him for his simplicity and gentle ways. When he had got
over his nervousness he could take a service without making any
mistakes, though preaching was always a terrible ordeal for him.
There, however, his good-natured vicar called upon him as little
as possible.</p>

<p>Falling in love, he married a pretty girl almost as retiring
as himself, and they managed to live contentedly upon his £200 a
year stipend. His only hobby was raising chickens in their
little back garden. For this purpose he had acquired a small
incubator and, when a batch of chickens was hatched out, he
would sit for hours and hours watching them, in the hope that
one day he would be able to tell by their appearance, and
without handling them, which were going to turn out pullets and
which cockerels. He was confident he would discover the secret
eventually.</p>

<p>So, up to his thirtieth year, his life was quite a happy one
and, no doubt, it would have continued happy if Uncle Ebenezer
had not interfered again. The latter was a town councillor and
somewhat of an important personage in the city, and he thought
it only right that he should use his influence on his nephew's
behalf and, as he called it, pull strings.</p>

<p>Samuel found himself installed as rector of the little town
of Buggawolla, about 150 miles up in the country, and right from
the beginning realised that the responsibilities thrust upon him
were more than he could carry. He was not fitted to take any
lead in social affairs, being much too shy. He could not give
advice, as it was advice he wanted himself, and he could not
make speeches. The matter of his sermons, however, he did get
over, as he took to buying them at 5/- each from a man in
Tasmania, whose advertisement he had happened to come upon one
day in a Melbourne newspaper. That their quality was not high,
he did not think mattered very much and, at any rate, they
occupied the usually allotted 10 minutes.</p>

<p>As time went on it was obvious to even the most careless
observer that Samuel was not a success in the parish. His
congregations became smaller and smaller, the offertories
dropped alarmingly, and the enrolments in the Sunday school
showed a progressive falling off. It was not that anyone
disliked Samuel. He was too inoffensive to dislike and he,
really, had no enemies. It was just that he was a nonentity, a
misfit, and the proverbial round peg in the square hole. The
bishop was very annoyed and, time after time, expressed his
disappointment when he came to the town. His reproofs, however,
did no good, and poor Samuel came to dread his visits as a
schoolboy dreads the headmaster when he is carpeted before
him.</p>

<p>Added to all these worries, Samuel began to get badly into
debt. His nice little wife was as bad a manager as was he and
had no idea of running a household in any methodical or
economical way. Accordingly, they lived beyond their means and
were soon owing money everywhere.</p>

<br>

<p>One Sunday he was in the depths of depression. Besides the
pressure of his creditors, he was behind with his assurance
premiums, he had only a pound or two of ready money and, to
crown all, only a few days before his bank manager had written
him his account was overdrawn £37 and must be set straight as
soon as possible. One Sunday evening his incubator had gone
wrong and, stopping to try to get it right he was almost late
for the evening service. He had not even had time to read the
sermon he was going to preach that night but had snatched up the
top one of a new batch which had arrived only the previous day
from Tasmania, and run in haste to the church.</p>

<p>Then, when in due time he mounted into the pulpit and started
upon his sermon, greatly to his annoyance he found it was a
fierce denunciation of the evils of all forms of gambling. It
was certainly a most unfortunate sermon for him to have picked
up, as it happened the Melbourne Cup was close at hand and a
popular station owner in the district was running a well-favored
horse in the race. All the townspeople were backing it.</p>

<p>Most unfortunately for Samuel, the editor of the local
newspaper happened to be among the congregation at the church
that evening and, instantly sensing the sermon to be good copy,
he took copious notes, with the result that in the next issue of
his paper a good summary of the sermon appeared, causing not a
little interest in the town. Some people were annoyed, but
others only amused, and the idea came to a few young sporting
bloods to play what they considered a good joke upon the
preacher. Accordingly, Samuel received a letter announcing that
in appreciation of his sermon, some of his admirers had
subscribed to purchase him a ticket in the forthcoming 'Great
Australian Lottery,' and the letter was signed Bert Bar-one,
'bookie.' and William Winner, Percy Pickemall, and Thomas
Ten-to-one, 'happy punters.'</p>

<p>Samuel tore up the letter contemptuously, believing it to be
only a stupid joke. However, at the end of the week the promised
ticket duly arrived, with the number all sevens, 77777. Samuel
tossed it over to his wife. "Throw it into the fire," he said.
"A pretty scandal it would be if it got out I had a ticket in a
lottery." Then, to his consternation and amazement a telegram
came, addressed in full to the Rev. Samuel Popplecockle,
announcing that number 77777 had drawn the first prize in the
great lottery.</p>

<p>"But does it really mean, Samuel," asked his wife, all of a
twitter, "that you've won some money? How much will it be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied irritably, "and at any rate they
wouldn't pay it, as I've thrown away the ticket."</p>

<p>"But I picked it up," exclaimed his wife excitedly, "and
wrapped it round the candle in baby's candle stick to make it
keep in."</p>

<p>The soiled and crumpled ticket was found, and she asked
tremblingly, "Now what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," snapped Samuel. "I'll have nothing to do with
it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," she exclaimed fiercely. "Of course, you will."
She flared up. "Here are we as hard up as any family can be,
with me afraid to order another pound of sugar from the
grocer&mdash;and you tell me you're not going to take money
which will get us out of all our troubles." She spoke with
surprising decision for her. "Put on your hat at once and go
round and see Mr. Brown. As a bank manager he'll tell you what's
best to do."</p>

<p>So a nervous and very reluctant Samuel went round to the bank
and, thinking he had come to ask for a further overdraft, the
manager looked very grim and stern. His eyes, however, popped
like marbles when he took in the lottery ticket and the telegram
Samuel handed to him. "Good heavens," he exclaimed, "you've won
£20,000!" His eyebrows went up with a jerk, and he looked most
amused. "So you ventured on a ticket, even after that sermon you
preached!"</p>

<p>"No, no," almost wailed Samuel. "I didn't send for it. It was
sent to me for a joke," and he went on to relate about the
letter he had received first.</p>

<p>"But my conscience won't let me take it," choked Samuel. "I
shan't touch a penny."</p>

<p>"Not touch a penny!" exclaimed the bank manager. He spoke
drily. "But I should have thought your conscience would trouble
you less if you took the money and paid your debts. I happen to
know the milkman badly wants that £22 you owe him."</p>

<p>"Now you go home and think it over," he said kindly. "Don't
decide anything in a hurry. You take my advice and shut yourself
away from everybody. Don't go to the door and don't you answer
the phone. Directly it gets known, you'll have all the begging
people in the State after you. Let your wife attend to them and
say you're away or ill. In the meantime I'll arrange about this
ticket with our Sydney branch." He patted him on the shoulder.
"Remember, you can do a lot of good in the world with
£20,000."</p>

<p>Samuel and his wife spent a very worried four days, but the
latter rose splendidly to the occasion. She denied Samuel to
everyone and, when the result slips arrived in the State, which
they did on the Thursday, her job was no easy one. All sorts of
people wanted to have speech with the clergyman winner of the
£20,000, the worst being two newspaper men.</p>

<p>The climax came on the Friday, just after the bank manager
had sent round a note saying the £20,000 had now been credited
to Samuel's account. The telephone rang, and Mrs. Popplecockle
came to fetch Samuel. Her face was white and anxious. "The
bishop," she mouthed breathlessly, "and he won't go away. He
insists upon speaking to you."</p>

<p>"All right," choked Samuel. "I knew it had to come sooner or
later, and I may as well get it over now."</p>

<p>The bishop's voice was very cold and stern. "I learn,
Popplecockle," he said icily, "that you've won £20,000 in a
lottery."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed Samuel in shaking tones, "but I didn't buy
the ticket. Someone sent it to me as a joke," and he related
once again how it had happened.</p>

<p>"Then the whole story is to be made public," ordered the
bishop. His voice rose. "And you can't take the money."</p>

<p>"But it was paid into my bank this morning, sir," said
Samuel, feeling like a rabbit before a snake. "It was sent from
Sydney."</p>

<p>"But we'll soon settle that," cried the bishop. "You shall
give it to charity. You can endow our cathedral institute here
and we can do with two thousand for a new organ." He considered
for a few moments. "Now, can you put me up for the week-end if I
come down tomorrow. You can hand me over the cheque then."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed Samuel, with his heart in his boots, and,
telling him then to expect him on the evening train, the bishop
rang off.</p>

<p>"I'm to give it to him for charity," almost wept Samuel,
leaning hard against his wife. "He's coming for it tomorrow
evening and going to stay over the week-end with us."</p>

<p>"Oh, is he?" she snapped. "He's certainly not." She spoke
fiercely. "Charity, indeed! But it's me and the children you've
got to consider first." She stamped her foot. "Look here,
Samuel, I'm sick of waiting for you to make up your mind, and so
I'm going to make it up for you. We'll keep that
money&mdash;&mdash;" her eyes flashed excitedly, "&mdash;and
we'll leave here by the quarter to 6 train tomorrow morning.
We'll take only what we can pack in our suitcases, and we'll get
as far away from this little pokey town as we can. It has only
unhappy memories for us both. Now, you write me a cheque for
£100 and I'll go round to the bank and cash it at once. And I'll
arrange, too, with Mr. Brown for him to settle up everything for
us after we've gone."</p>

<p>"But the bishop, when he comes tomorrow," wailed Samuel,
"he'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Find Emma here to look after him, and you'll leave a letter
for him saying you've accepted a call in another State."</p>

<p>Samuel wavered. "But what can I do if we go somewhere else?"
he asked. "No one will take me, even as a curate, if I run away
like this."</p>

<p>"You'll not want them to," she retorted, "it's poultry
farming you'll take up." She almost whispered the next words.
"And you'll buy an incubator which hatches a thousand
chicks."</p>

<p>Samuel trembled, but wrote out the cheque.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Ten years later, when the bishop was returning by train from
a church congress in Brisbane, he got into conversation with a
fellow traveller and, the train pulling up at a small station,
the latter suddenly pointed to a man who had just alighted from
another carriage. "See that chap," he exclaimed excitedly, "that
little fellow with the big stomach and a paper in his hand?
Well, in a few days he will probably be regarded as a great man,
a great benefactor to humankind."</p>

<p>"Then is he particularly good at some kind of game," asked
the bishop with heavy sarcasm, "golf, cricket, or ping-pong, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"No, he's a poultry farmer," laughed the other, "about the
most successful in the State, and he says he's at last
discovered a most simple way of finding out the sex of chickens,
directly they are hatched. He says it is only a matter of taking
note of their preference for color. One half of a little run is
painted a violent red and the other a dull grey. The chicks are
put in and, when they've settled down, he swears all the pullets
gather in the red part and the cockerels in the grey. He says
the test never fails."</p>

<p>The bishop was mildly interested. "But how are they going to
prove whether he's right or wrong?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, next week hundreds of poultry fanciers are coming here
from all parts of the Commonwealth, and he's going to put 200
chicks to the test. Then, when these chicks have chosen their
color, they're all going to be killed and cut open to see what
sex they are. If it's found he's right, it will be of most
wonderful benefit to all the poultry world."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" frowned the bishop. "I seem to remember
his face."</p>

<p>"Smith, just Smith," replied the other. "Another humble
Smith."</p>

<p>For days the poultryman's face worried the bishop, and then
one night he sat up suddenly in bed and shouted, "I have it. I
can place him now. He was Popplecockle! That's who he was!"</p>

<p>His startled wife sat up, too. "What's the matter with you,
Augustus?" she asked anxiously. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much, Jane," he sighed. "Only that I've just
remembered a wandering sheep."</p>

<p>"Then go to sleep again at once," she exclaimed irritably.
"You drank too much claret at dinner. That's what's upsetting
you."</p>

<div align="center">

</div>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 11 November 1944.</h3>

<p class="first">AT 20 years of age, June Brandon was not only
of a very nice disposition, but also an undeniably pretty girl.
Of an aristocratic appearance, she had beautiful grey eyes, a
good profile, and a faultless complexion.</p>

<p>She had no knowledge as to her parents, having been born in
an apartment house in a poor suburb of North London. Her mother
died within a few hours of her birth and left behind no clue to
her identity.</p>

<p>No relatives coming forward to make inquiries and with only a
few pounds found among the dead mother's effects, the baby was
taken to a public orphanage, where she passed all her childhood
and girlhood days. She had been christened June because she had
been born in that month.</p>

<p>She was so obviously of a superior class to the other girls
at the institution that, instead of being put out into domestic
service when she was 16, she was placed in the infirmary as a
nurse-probationer. Then, some two years later, a wealthy and
titled patroness of the orphanage came to hear about her and
suggested taking her as a nurse-attendant.</p>

<p>Accordingly, June was installed at Roding Hall, a large house
near Brighton, to wait upon Lady Sandall, the childless and
elderly widow of Sir James Sandall, who had been a high official
in the Indian Civil Service.</p>

<p>A very bad-tempered woman, Lady Sandall was alternately kind
and harsh to June. It pleased her to help on the girl's
education by constant instruction and by encouraging her to
study the best works in English literature.</p>

<p>Also, finding her so quick and intelligent, she was soon
using her as a private secretary, giving her a private room to
herself and letting her take all her meals with the
housekeeper.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when in her bad moods, her ladyship was
very hard on June, furious about the most trivial things and
often finding fault most unjustly.</p>

<p>Masterful with everyone, her servants were greatly afraid of
her, the one exception being Fordyce, the elderly butler who had
served her and Sir James for nearly 30 years.</p>

<p>A refined and even distinguished-looking man, Fordyce seemed
to have a restraining influence upon his mistress, and it was
said she often consulted him about her private affairs.</p>


<p><br>
JUST over sixty when June came to her, Lady Sandall was in a bad
state of health, suffering a lot from her heart. She had been
repeatedly warned by her doctor not to give way to her emotions;
in other words, to try to control her tempers.</p>

<p>She had only two relatives, both nephews. One was in the
forties, a well-to-do stockbroker in the city, but the other,
Reggie Wynward, only 22, was the favored one, which was as it
should have been, as he had no means at all. He was within a few
months of qualifying as a medical man.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking, manly young fellow, but had to mind
his steps very carefully to keep in the good graces of his
irascible aunt.</p>

<p>June realised to the full how fortunate she had been to come
to Lady Sandall, for after two years at the Hall she found she
had so educated herself that she could well hold her own with
any of the society callers who visited her employer.</p>

<p>So, putting up smilingly with the latter's frequent bouts of
bad temper, she was really happy and contented, and she became
happier still when young Wynward took to coming frequently to
the Hall.</p>

<p>As was natural, the two fell in love, and very soon were
making opportunities to meet alone, sometimes in the garden when
Lady Sandall was in bed, and sometimes, upon much rarer
occasions, when June had the day off and could spend it in
London.</p>

<p>They had to be very careful, however, that Lady Sandall
learnt nothing of what was going on, as she made no secret that,
as her heir, she had ambitious matrimonial plans for Reggie.</p>

<p><br>
ONCE, as if suspecting something, she warned him sharply
against June. "You keep her at a distance, my boy," she ordered
sternly, "and take care she doesn't lead you on. She's pretty
enough, I admit, but I'm not going to have you mixed up with a
girl of her history, or you'll lose every penny I intend to
leave you. So you just take that in with no nonsense."</p>

<p>Reggie laughed it off, but about three months later the worst
happened for the lovers, as late one night she caught Reggie in
June's room.</p>

<p>Not feeling well, she had gone to bed early, but was unable
to sleep. About 11 o'clock she had gone round to June's room
intending to fetch her to give her some message. Opening the
door unceremoniously, as was her wont, to her amazement she saw
June sitting on Reggie's knee in an armchair drawn up before the
fire.</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">
Opening the door unceremoniously, she saw June sitting on Reggie's knee</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>For a long moment she stood thunderstruck, and then she
shouted to Reggie: "You young blackguard!" To June she addressed
a horrid word.</p>

<p>In consternation the two had sprung to their feet. "But it's
quite all right, Aunt," Reggie called out. "We are properly
married. We were married more than a month ago."</p>

<p>"Married!" screamed Lady Sandall. "Oh, you young fool!" She
was almost choking with rage. "Then both of you get out of this
house at once. You shan't remain here another minute, and I'll
never have anything more to do with either of you. Get your
things together instantly and go off."</p>

<p>And, standing in the doorway, she hurled every abusive word
she could think of at them, rousing the whole house with her
shouting. Getting rid of her at last, Reggie rang up for a taxi,
and, in less than half an hour, he and June were being driven to
a hotel.</p>

<p>The following morning, well before 8 o'clock, Lady Sandall
was ringing up Mr. John Litchfield, her solicitor, in London,
with the intention of ordering him to draw up a new will,
leaving everything to her other nephew, Samuel Gorringe, but to
her great annoyance she learnt he was out of town and would not
be back for a couple of days.</p>

<p>Leaving nothing to chance, she immediately wrote out another
will herself on the Hall notepaper. It read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"I revoke all former wills. To my nephew,
Reginald Wynward, I leave the sum of one shilling. To his wife,
formerly known as June Brandon and for 18 years an inmate of the
Balham Public Orphanage, an institution in the main for children
born out of wedlock, I leave also one shilling towards the
upkeep of the baby which is no doubt now well upon the way. All
the rest of my estate and effects I leave to my nephew, Samuel
Gorringe."</p>

<br>

<p>Fordyce and Mrs. Humphrey, the cook, were summoned to witness
her signature, and then she had herself driven to the post
office and despatched the will by registered letter to London.
Returning home, she collapsed altogether, and her doctor was
phoned for to come in urgent haste. Her heart was failing
quickly, and, with no response to treatment, she passed away
during the night.</p>

<p>The following week Mr. Litchfield sent for Reggie and told
him about the new will. "I'm very sorry," he said, "but there
will be only those shillings for you and your wife. The will she
drew up herself is perfectly valid and the whole estate, about
£65,000, goes to your cousin. It's an unjust and spiteful will,
particularly as I know she promised your uncle just before he
died to look after you. Still, there's no getting behind
it."</p>

<p><br>
REGGIE had a high opinion of Mr. Litchfield's abilities, and
at once gave up all hope of getting anything. So he was very
surprised when about a week later, a young Brighton solicitor,
Charlie Jackson, came up to London, expressly to see him and
suggest the will should be contested.</p>

<p>Jackson was barely 24 and, only a few months previously, had
been admitted to the practice of the law. Reggie knew him very
slightly, and only because it happened they belonged to the same
tennis club.</p>

<p>"But I'm told I haven't a hope in the world," said
Reggie.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I think you have," said the other. "That will shows
spite, and, besides, your cousin may be willing to
compromise."</p>

<p>"Not he!" scoffed Reggie. "We've always disliked each other."
He shook his head. "No, Jackson, I'll not dispute it. I haven't
the money for one thing."</p>

<p>"But never you mind about the money," said Jackson. "Of
course, it's not ethical for me to take the case up on spec,
but, if you're agreeable, I'll finance everything, and, if
nothing comes of it, promise not to send you in any account." He
laughed. "In any case, it'll be a ripping advertisement for
me."</p>

<p>Upon these terms Reggie was quite agreeable and, accordingly,
notice was served upon his cousin's solicitors that the will
would be contested. When the day for the hearing arrived
everyone in court was most amused at the idea of so boyish-looking
a country solicitor pitting himself against the mighty
Jarvis Romilly, one of the most eminent King's Counsel
practising in the Probate Court. They were most curious as to
exactly what line of action he was going to take. Lord Royston
was presiding over the proceedings.</p>

<p>As a matter of formality, the deceased woman's will was first
produced, and Mrs. Humphrey, the cook, went into the witness box
to testify to having seen the dead woman put her signature to
it.</p>

<p>"And you saw your mistress sign it," asked the K.C., "in the
presence of your fellow-servant, Mr. Fordyce, and you put your
signature in the presence of them both?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I did," replied the cook, and the K.C. at once sat
down.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Jackson rose to his feet. "And did Lady Sandall
seem quite all right that morning?" he asked. "Quite capable of
knowing what she was doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," replied the cook. "She was not in a good
temper, but she knew what she was doing all right." And Mr.
Jackson, too, resumed his seat, while Mrs. Humphrey proceeded to
leave the witness box and the court.</p>

<p>The butler was then called, and he stepped briskly into the
box. He was asked if he, too, had witnessed Lady Sandall's
signature in the presence of the cook. Upon his replying in the
affirmative, the K.C. again sat down.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Fordyce," asked young Jackson, "did her ladyship
appear to you to be in a state of unusual agitation when she
affixed her signature?"</p>

<p>The butler considered. "Well, at any rate, sir," he replied,
"she was not so the moment before she signed"&mdash;he
smiled&mdash;"but, as I did not actually see her write her name,
I cannot say what was exactly her condition at that very
moment."</p>

<p>It did not seem that Mr. Jackson could believe the evidence
of his ears. "What," he exclaimed, "you now tell us you did not
see her sign the will?"</p>

<p>"Not actually, sir," said the butler, "because, just as she
took up the pen to sign, I thought I heard the front door bell
ring and went out to see. I wasn't gone a minute and, when I
came back, both she and Cook had signed. That's how it was Mrs.
Humphrey witnessed the signature before me. Otherwise I was to
have signed first."</p>

<p><br>
A STUNNED silence filled the court. It was as if all present
had been turned into graven images. Mr. Jackson recovered first,
and with grim smile, turned to his lordship.</p>

<p>"Then that concludes my case, my lord, and it will not be
necessary for me to proceed further. The testament was not
properly executed and therefore is invalid," and he plumped down
into his seat.</p>

<p>Jarvis Romilly jumped to his feet. "I ask, my lord," he cried
fiercely, "that the previous witness be detained before she has
had time to leave the precincts of the court," and, upon a sign
from the judge, an usher hurried out.</p>

<p>The K.C. turned menacingly to the butler. "Now, sir," he
declaimed, "after having testified on oath that you saw deceased
put her signature to the will&mdash;you now say you were not
present when she signed."</p>

<p>The butler looked very frightened. "Yes, sir. I am sorry,
sir. It was a mistake. But I thought I had witnessed the signing
all right, as, when I came back, the ink on the other signatures
was still wet."</p>

<p>The K.C. now spoke quietly, almost in silky tones. "And
later," he asked, "you happened to mention to Mr. Wynward
exactly what had taken place?"</p>

<p>"No, no, sir," cried Fordyce. "I never mentioned it to him at
all. I haven't seen or spoken to him since that night he left
the Hall," and no amount of questioning could now make him
contradict himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Humphrey was recalled. "Now, madam," said Romilly, with
a pleasant smile, "you told us your mistress signed the will in
your presence and that of Mr. Fordyce, too. That is so, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the cook.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fordyce was actually standing at your side," went on the
K.C.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the cook again and then, a startled look
coining into her face, she added quickly, "No, sir, not quite
all the time. I remember now that he went out for a moment to
attend to the bell."</p>

<p>"Before your mistress signed?" asked Romilly, and the court
was as hushed and still as the grave.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded the cook, "and before I signed, too. I
recollect we had just written our names when he came back."</p>

<p>Most non-plussed at her corroboration of the butler's story,
the great King's Council tried in every way to shake her
testimony, until at last his lordship intervened. "I do not
think, Mr. Romilly," he said, "it will be any good your further
questioning the witness. She is undoubtedly speaking the truth.
The will is invalid, and I accordingly decline to grant
probate."</p>

<p>"But your lordship," protested the K.C., "the intention of
the testator is so clear and it is not justice
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how often have I not had to explain," interrupted his
lordship wearily, "that it is law I have to dispense in this
court, and not necessarily justice. No, I decline to grant
probate."</p>

<p><br>
SO, under the previous will, Reggie Wynward succeeded to the
estate, and one day some weeks later, Fordyce came to see him.
"Oh, I'm so glad to see you," said Reggie. "I couldn't find out
where you had gone, and I wanted to do something for you."</p>

<p>The butler shook his head. "No thank you, sir. I have all I
need. Under my late master's will I came into £2,000 when her
ladyship died or I left her service. I've only come now to clear
up a few things."</p>

<p>"Well," said Reggie, "I have a lot to thank you for. But for
your accidentally leaving the room when the will was being
signed I should have only got that shilling."</p>

<p>"But it was no accident, sir," said the butler gravely. "I
went out on purpose to invalidate the will. I only pretended to
think I heard the bell, for, knowing her ladyship's impatience,
I felt sure she would sign without waiting for me to come
back."</p>

<p>Reggie was aghast. "But&mdash;but have you told this to
anyone besides me?" he asked. A sudden light dawned upon him and
his hand shot out accusingly. "A-ah. I know you have. You told
Mr. Jackson."</p>

<p>Fordyce nodded. "Yes, sir, and we both thought it wisest not
to mention it to you then, so that the other side should not be
able to suggest there was any conspiracy between us."</p>

<p>"Conspiracy between us!" exclaimed the astounded Reggie.
"What on earth do you mean? You had no interest in the will or
me."</p>

<p>"Not so much perhaps in you, sir," said Fordyce, "but I
certainly had an interest in your wife,"&mdash;he smiled
drily&mdash;"as she happens to be my niece. No, no, she does not
know it, and I have no wish she should. I only mention it now so
that you shall know you have no reason to be ashamed of her. Her
mother was none of those dreadful things her ladyship called out
that night. We come of a good yeoman family, and my sister was a
schoolteacher when the gentleman who was your wife's father met
her."</p>

<p>"Were they married?" asked Reggie hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No, sir, but I am sure they would have been if young Lord
Rutland&mdash;he was your wife's father&mdash;had not been
killed in the hunting field before it was known what was going
to happen." Fordyce's voice shook. "I was in India for 20 years
and knew nothing of my poor sister's misfortune until I came
back four years ago. Then, with great difficulty, I found out
about June and traced her to the orphanage.</p>

<p>"No, it was not chance she came to Lady Sandall. I got her
ladyship interested in the orphanage by pretending I knew the
matron, and then I suggested she should engage June as her
nurse-attendant."</p>

<p>The butler rose to go. "One thing more, sir. I have just
posted to June, anonymously, of course, an old photograph of her
father and mother taken at a county ball 24 years ago. You will
recognise them both by their likeness to her. Good-bye, sir, and
the best of happiness to you. I am sailing for Australia
tomorrow, and neither of you will see me again," and, with a
warm handshake, the two men parted.</p>

<p>That evening, in great excitement, June showed Reggie the
photo which had just arrived. It was a flashlight one taken on a
ballroom floor, and, under two of the dancers was written, 'Your
father and mother, who are both dead.'</p>

<p>"I wonder who sent it," exclaimed June. "But oh, Reggie,
aren't they both good looking. Do you really think they are my
mother and father?"</p>

<p>And when her husband nodded emphatically, she went on, "But
isn't it strange? My mother somehow reminds me of&mdash;whom do
you think?&mdash;why, Fordyce!" And, after another long look at
the photograph, Reggie agreed with her again.</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1945-01-27"></a>THE WAY OF CHANCE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 27 January 1945.</h3>

<p class="first">THEY had been married 13 years when Matt
Huggins was the cause of his wife's untimely and sudden death.
There was no premeditation about the act and, in a way, her
passing was quite accidental. He was shocked with what he had
done.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt, however, she had been leading him a
most unhappy life. An inoffensive, good-natured little man, he
had had a lot to put up with her, and even in the very early
days of their honeymoon she had started to nag him. Nothing he
ever did was right and she bullied him unmercifully. She took
away his beer, she wouldn't let him smoke in the house, the
wireless was turned on for what she wanted, and, when she was
tired of listening, it was turned off as a waste of
electricity.</p>

<p>When he came home tired of an evening she would not let him
read the newspaper until he had done the many odd jobs she was
always finding for him, and when they were finished it was
nearly always time for bed, and any further use of the lights
considered as more waste of electricity.</p>

<p><br>
MATT was head clerk in a lawyer's office, and every penny of
his £6 a week salary had to be strictly accounted for. When his
Aunt Emily died and he came into the nice little legacy of
£4,000, it was all banked in his wife's name and she invested it
as she thought best.</p>

<p>Year after year he put up with everything almost
uncomplainingly, hardly ever daring even to answer her back, and
then the end came. It was not like the worm turning, but rather
as the wrath of a sheep. One quick blow with a rolling pin and
she was dead.</p>

<p>This dreadful climax to Matt's way of sorrow had eventuated
one evening in early summer when they were spending his annual
holiday at a small bungalow they had on a beach some 20 miles
from the city. He had been helping her dry up the tea things and
had dropped a saucer. It had broken all to pieces and, in her
anger, she had lashed at him with the wet cloth she had in her
hand. It had caught him in the eye and the pain stung him like a
red-hot needle.</p>

<p>AS she had made a lash at him again, he had snatched up a
heavy rolling pin from the table and struck at her uplifted arm.
Missing the arm, however, the blow had landed hard on her head,
and she had crashed down against the stone upright of the
fireplace and broken her neck. She had made no sound and, after
a few convulsive movements, had lain quite still.</p>

<p>There was no doubt she was dead. Her mouth had gaped open,
her head lay at a sickening angle, and she was not
breathing.</p>

<p>Matt burst into tears. He had not meant to do it, he told
himself. It was an accident which she had brought upon herself.
Still, it would look like murder and, of course, he would be
hanged for it. A sob caught his breath. But he wouldn't mind
hanging. She had made him sick of life, and for a long time he
had had nothing to live for. She had hated him and made him hate
her. He was not sorry she was dead.</p>

<p>He dried his eyes. Now he would go and give himself up. It
would be a long walk to the nearest police station, quite five
miles, but he would start at once and get it over. Ah, but he
must go and feed old Hobson's fowls first and water his
canaries.</p>

<p><br>
HOBSON was his friend, the only friend he had been allowed to
have. His wife had encouraged the friendship there because the
old sea captain was an ardent fisherman, and often gave them
fish. His bungalow was next door, and he and Mrs. Hobson lived
there all the year round.</p>

<p>Just now, however, they were both away in Melbourne, and Matt
had charge of the key. No, he musn't let the old man down! He
would attend to his birds, and at the same time give himself a
good nip from the bottle of brandy he had noticed in the
cupboard where the canary seed was kept!</p>

<p>Going outside, for a long moment he stood looking at the sea,
realising with a pang that after that night he might never see
it again.</p>

<p>He remembered the shark they had seen that morning, and which
had made them cut short their dip so quickly. How he wished they
had not noticed it and that it had taken him! Then at any rate
he wouldn't be going to be hanged, as he was now!</p>

<p>Here his conscience smote him unpleasantly as he speculated
upon what a difference it would have made to everything if the
shark had taken his wife, and it, and not he, had been the cause
of her death.</p>

<p><br>
HE fed Hobson's fowls, and gave the canaries their water,
also, he had a stiff tot of the brandy, and the unaccustomed
spirit seemed to liven him up a lot. His thought harked back to
the shark, and, all suddenly, an amazing idea leapt into his
mind.</p>

<p>If the shark hadn't got his wife that morning&mdash;what harm
would it be if it got her now? It might still be prowling about,
and he could wade out with the body and then go shrieking off to
the people in the cafe that he had seen her drawn under! Then
all would be put right, and&mdash;ah! but what if the shark were
not there to take the body, and, it drifting back to shore, it
was found out how his wife had really died? He would be hanged
just the same.</p>

<p>But let him think calmly. What if he got rid of the body in
another way, if he buried it somewhere and then, very early
tomorrow morning, went down as usual to bathe and, a few minutes
later, ran in a state of terror to the cafe with his carefully
prepared tale?</p>

<p>He was sure they would believe him, as it was well known to
everyone that a shark had been seen recently in the
neighbourhood. And he knew where he could bury the body,
too&mdash;in a deep pit which his wife had made him dig in their
little back yard that very morning. It had been dug for the
household rubbish, and was a good 4 ft below the surface of the
sand. It was the very place, and the body would never be
discovered there.</p>

<p><br>
HE took another good nip of the brandy, and thought out all
the details of his plan.</p>

<p>The next morning everything went off without a hitch. The
proprietor of the cafe did not for a moment doubt his story,
and, pushing down a boat with all possible speed, for an hour
and longer, with Matt a tearful and woebegone looking passenger,
rowed backwards and forwards over the place where the wife was
supposed to have been last seen. The local policeman was rung up
and, news of what had happened becoming known, reporters were
rushed to the scene, with city newspaper readers being later
intrigued with exciting headlines,</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">
WIFE TAKEN BY SHARK OFF HUNTER'S BEACH.<br>
HUSBAND EYE WITNESS OF DREADFUL TRAGEDY.</p>


<p><br>
MATT comported himself as became the bereaved husband, sad,
sorrowing, and with a haunted look in his eyes. He had thought
it wisest to stay on at the bungalow to keep morbid sight-seers
from coming too close. He was sure if he were not about they
would invade his front garden and back yard to peer through the
windows.</p>

<p>In a way he was most uneasy about that back yard, for, to his
guilty mind, in its uncared for and unkempt condition it looked
just the very place where a body would be buried. He comforted
himself, however, with the thought that his story had been
believed everywhere.</p>

<p><br>
THEN chance threw down an evil card against him, and
suspicion was aroused in the mind of, perhaps, the very worst
person possible. One morning Detective-Inspector Alec McNab was
in a tram and overheard two men talking about the tragedy.</p>

<p>"And it's about the best thing which could have happened,"
said one of them, "at any rate for the husband. She led him an
awful life, and I'd bet any money that, privately, he is
reckoning that shark as about the best friend he ever had."</p>

<p>"That's so," nodded the other. "I knew them both, and she was
a dreadful nagger." He grinned. "It was a good thing that chap
from the cafe saw the shark take her, or people might be
thinking he drowned her himself."</p>

<p>But the inspector, remembering the local policeman's report,
knew the second man was wrong, and that Matt alone had seen the
shark take his wife. So, certain faint suspicions coming into
his mind, he thought it quite worth while to go down to Hunter's
Beach that same afternoon, and have a talk with the husband.</p>

<p><br>
BY great good luck Matt knew the inspector by sight, he
having once been pointed out to him in court when his, Matt's,
employer was defending a man charged with illegal betting.</p>

<p>So, when sitting on the low cliff before the row of
bungalows, Matt saw two men coming along in a car and recognised
one of them as the inspector, he had a few moments to prepare
himself and get a good grip of his composure. An instinct, to
say nothing of his guilty conscience, told him they were coming
to speak to him.</p>

<p>The car pulled up and the inspector asked to be directed to
where Mr. Matthew Huggins lived. Matt's heart was beating
painfully, for, he knew he was in terrible danger.</p>

<p>If this awful inspector went into the back yard he would
surely suspect something at once. He had eyes like a hawk, and
nothing would escape him. Matt put on a stolid look. "I'm that
man," he said gruffly. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"We're police from Adelaide," replied the inspector, "and we
want a few words with you." The two detectives jumped out of the
car and their eyes roved seawards. "So this is where the shark
was," said the inspector, "but you don't often get them as close
in shore, do you?"</p>

<p>"Very seldom," grunted Matt. "I've only once seen one before
in the five years I've been coming down here."</p>

<p><br>
THE inspector eyed him intently and, with a certain
disappointment, did not think he was the kind of man who would
have had pluck enough to commit a dreadful crime, but for all
that, asked sharply, "And I understand no one but you saw the
shark?"</p>

<p>Matt shook his head slowly. "No one but me that morning," he
replied, "but plenty saw it the days before." He sighed heavily.
"I suppose it was waiting until it got its meal." He caught
sight of some people coming along the cliff and went on quickly,
"but come inside if you want to talk. I'm a public curiosity
now, and people stare at me until I feel sick."</p>

<p>With all his wits about him and as bold as brass, he led the
way&mdash;not to his own bungalow, but to Hobson's. As it
happened, both the doors, front and back, were wide open. He had
been inside a few minutes before to put back a book he had
borrowed and, the place smelling stuffy, he had opened up
everywhere to let in the air.</p>

<p>He took the detectives into the sitting room and waved them
to chairs. The bungalow, unlike his, was nicely furnished in a
homey and comfortable sort of way. A big fishing rod was hanging
on the wall and the inspector, an enthusiastic fisherman,
pounced upon it at once. "Gad, that's a beautiful rod," he
exclaimed, "a genuine Mackenzie!" And he plunged into an
animated discussion about fishing, or rather he talked and Matt
listened, as the latter had never caught a fish in all his life,
and was not interested.</p>

<p><br>
PRESENTLY the inspector asked, "And what's the biggest
butterfish you've ever caught?"</p>

<p>Matt dared not answer. He had no idea what butterfish, big or
little, weighed. "Oh, don't talk any more about fishing," he
exclaimed irritably. "My poor wife was as keen on it as I was,
and I don't suppose I'll ever go fishing again." He spoke
sharply. "Besides, I'm sure you didn't come down here to talk to
me about fish."</p>

<p>The inspector was annoyed. He had been snubbed in front of a
subordinate, and it stung him to a line of questioning upon
which, otherwise, he might not have been quite so willing to
start. "Certainly not," he frowned. He eyed Matt very hard, and
rapped out, "Now you and your wife did not get on too well
together, did you?"</p>

<p>Matt met his stare unflinchingly. He had bluffed the
inspector about the bungalow and his success there gave him
confidence. "Who said so?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Never mind. We heard it," replied the inspector. He nodded
unpleasantly. "We police hear a lot of things," and then as Matt
was silent, he went on, "It's only the truth, isn't it?"</p>

<p><br>
MATT weighed his words carefully. "We had little tiffs at
times, but they weren't big enough to have made me let that
shark get her if I could have prevented it." His eyes glared. "I
suppose that's what you mean."</p>

<p>The inspector certainly had not though the implication of his
question would have been met so boldly, and he was now angry
with himself for having asked it. If everything were above
board, this little man looked just the very chap to complain to
headquarters, or, worse still, go writing to the newspapers
about inconsiderate treatment by the police.</p>

<p>He hastened to put things right. "No, I don't mean that," he
said quickly, "and I only put the question just as a matter of
routine to be assured by you it was no case of your wife having
drowned herself, say after a quarrel."</p>

<p>Matt would have liked to have laughed. The idea of his wife
committing suicide on his account seemed so funny. "But she
wasn't drowned." he said sharply. "If it hadn't been for that
shark she'd be alive now." He smiled a grim smile. "Besides, if
there had been any suicide business after a quarrel it would
have been me doing it and not her. She wasn't made that
way."</p>

<p><br>
WHATEVER suspicions the inspector had been wanting to
entertain, Matt's open frankness dissipated them and he had to
smile back.</p>

<p>"Nice little place you've got here," he said. "Do you mind if
we go through it?"</p>

<p>Of course, Matt did not mind and, indeed, he felt quite a
pride in showing them over. The Hobsons were methodical people
and all the rooms were neat and tidy. From the back door the
inspector meditatively regarded the little yard which the old
sea captain had made into a thriving garden. Every foot of it
was growing something.</p>

<p>The detectives went back to the city, and at the end of the
week, with the return of the Hobsons, Matt followed.</p>

<p><br>
TEN years went by, and at forty-five Matt was a happy and
contented man. He had filled out a lot and no longer looked
skinny and underfed. He had long since married again, and his
wife, a good fifteen years younger than he, was amiable and good
tempered. She had presented him with three children, of whom he
was immensely proud.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon Inspector McNab and a friend were
fishing off the jetty at Largs Bay when Matt and his little
family walked by. The friend passed the time of day to Matt, and
when they were out of earshot remarked to the inspector. "Now,
that's a man who had a most dreadful experience some years ago.
He saw the woman who was his wife then taken by a shark, before
his very eyes, when they were both bathing off Hunters
Beach."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "I remember him. I went down there to
make inquiries about it at the time. He was a great fisherman,
wasn't he?"</p>

<p>His friend looked puzzled. "Fisherman!" he exclaimed. "No, he
never fished."</p>

<p>"But he did," insisted the inspector, who never liked to be
contradicted. "He took me into his bungalow and it was full of
tackle. Why, he'd got a fine Mackenzie rod!"</p>


<p>HIS friend shook his head. "But you're mixing him up with
someone else, old man. I'd stake my life Matt Huggins never
baited a hook in those days. He hated anything to do with fish,
and when he had any given him used to say it made him sick to
have to clean them. I tell you, I knew him pretty well, as we
lived next door to him in Prospect, and I've been to his rotten
old bungalow, too."</p>

<p>"His bungalow wasn't rotten or old," scowled the inspector.
"It was nicely furnished and he'd some lovely canaries
there."</p>

<p>"Oh. I see it!" exclaimed the other. "It's Captain Hobson's
bungalow you're thinking of, and the old chap was the fisherman
you mean. His place was next door to Matt's, and it was he who
had that Mackenzie rod and the canaries. I remember now that
when Hobson was away Matt used to go in to attend to his
birds."</p>

<p><br>
THE inspector's face was a study. "So that was his little
game, was it?" he thought. "Well, he tricked me right
enough."</p>

<p>And then he was so preoccupied that his friend had to shout
to him that he'd got a bite. Presently he asked casually: "And
has this Huggins still got the bungalow he had then? Do you
know?"</p>

<p>The friend nodded. "Yes, he's got it though he never goes
there now. It's been shut up ever since that shark business, and
no one understands why he doesn't sell it."</p>

<p>The inspector, however, thought he understood, and his
thoughts boded ill for the happy husband and father.</p>

<p>The two remained on the jetty for a little while longer, and
then the inspector began to pack up and said he must be going
home.</p>

<p>He was still very preoccupied, so preoccupied, indeed, that,
in crossing the road he did not see a big lorry coming, and,
stepping straight in front of it was knocked down and killed
instantly.</p>

<p>Matt's good luck was holding to the end.</p>

</div>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 3 March 1945.</h3>

<p class="first">TODHUNTER MCSTOTTLEBAUGH held quite on
important position in the Income Tax Department and, contrary to
what some people might have expected, his expression was a mild
and gentle one. Happily married, he had a sensible, good-looking
wife and three nice children. Certainly, he was a good father
and, as far as the neighbors had been able to find out, a
faithful husband as well.</p>

<p>His life was just that of the ordinary suburban dweller.
Every morning he left home at a regular time and, every evening,
returned at a regular time, too. At night he read or listened to
the wireless, and at week-ends worked in his little garden,
occasionally taking his family out for little jaunts to one of
the beaches or the hills on Sundays.</p>

<p>In fact he was, to all appearance, a very ordinary man and,
as far as I can ascertain, up to his fortieth year showed no
signs of any moral or mental aberration. Then, however, came the
war with its shortages, restrictions, and rationing, and almost
in the twinkling of an eye, as it were, his whole outlook on
life was altered.</p>

<p>He became a collector of things which were in short supply, a
hoarder, and a crawler from shop to shop to acquire articles
which he did not necessarily want but which were difficult to
obtain. It became a craze, a veritable obsession with him.</p>

<p>It was his wife who started it all. One morning she asked him
to try to get her some sago in the city on his way home, as the
local grocer had got none. Accordingly, missing his usual tram
that afternoon, he set out upon the quest.</p>

<p>The first two shops had none, but at the third, with some
hesitation upon the girl's part because she did not recognise
him as a regular customer, he was given a pound. Then, as she
was getting him his change, he heard another girl who was
serving a lady tell her she was lucky she was able to give her
some prunes, as they had very few left and did not know when any
more would be coming in.</p>

<p>Whereupon Todhunter was instantly seized with an urge for
prunes, too, and he glowed with pleasure when later, to his
wife's great delight, he presented her with prunes as well as
the sago.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you're a splendid shopper, Tod, dear," she said,
"and I really think I'd better get you to do all my shopping for
me. Girls will give things to men when they won't to a
woman."</p>

<p>So Todhunter was set on the downward path, and, entering into
the matter with great zest, very soon there was a huge
accumulation of groceries in the store-cupboard&mdash;anything
which it was supposed might one day become hard to obtain.</p>

<p>Dozens of bottles of soup appeared, packets of peas galore,
lentils, haricot beans, tinned meats of all descriptions,
sauces, and preserved fruits. But it was condensed milk which
for some time was his long suit, and scores and scores of tins
were piled high up to the very ceiling.</p>

<p>Then pickles came into their own, for Todhunter heard there
would shortly be no labor available to produce them, and he
struck hard and heavily to get in a good supply, rarely an
evening passing without his bringing home two or more
bottles.</p>

<p>To them he was soon adding boxes and boxes of macaroni and
vermicelli, because one of his colleagues at the taxation office
had told him their supply was quickly running out.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2100091h-images/BlackMarket-2.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>
<p>To begin with, his wife had been amused, but speedily she
became annoyed, telling him sharply that she was beginning to
tremble every time she saw him coming home with his bag.
Todhunter, however, had tasted blood and was not to be stayed,
the very next evening after her reproof arriving home with three
2-oz. packets of mustard and two tins of golden syrup. A mania
with him now to add to their store every day, from unrationed
goods he quickly passed to rationed ones, and the acquisition of
an unlawful pound of butter or a few extra ounces of tea filled
him with a dreadful joy.</p>

<p>"But you're sure to be found out one day," protested his
wife, almost tearfully, "and you know it's black marketing."</p>

<p>"In a very harmless way, Mary," he smiled, "and I'll take
good care I'm not caught. I'm a pretty wily bird at it now."</p>

<p>But once having fallen to black marketing, the lure became
stronger every day, and soon Todhunter took to transgressing in
other ways than food.</p>

<p>It became a regular habit with him to have a bet at his
newsagent's shop every Saturday when he was returning home from
the office. Certainly, it was only a matter of a few shillings,
and he was really not much interested in horses and knew little
about them, but it gave him a great thrill to hand his little
betting slip over the counter, with the chance always there that
a policeman might rush into the shop and catch him red-
handed.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that one evening, when waiting with a friend
for a tram in Victoria square, two men came out of the
watchhouse, and the friend remarked to him they were Billikin
and Brown, of the lottery and gaming squad, two of the smartest
detectives in the force.</p>

<p>With great interest Tod took good note of their faces, and,
as it turned out, it was well for him that he did so, for the
following Saturday, just as he was approaching the newsagent's
shop to hand in his betting slip, he caught sight of a man with
a smutted face and in dirty overalls lounging on the pavement a
dozen or so yards away. He recognised him instantly as one of
the two detectives who had been pointed out to him, and, with a
quickly beating heart, passed the newsagent's shop.</p>

<p>Safe out of sight, he tore up his betting slip and dropped
the pieces down a drain.</p>

<p>A good sportsman, he thought it only decent to warn the
newsagent. Walking quickly back into the main street, with
difficulty he suppressed a whistle when he saw on the opposite
pavement the second detective in a railway porter's uniform. His
knees shook under him as he went into the shop. Fortunately the
newsagent was there alone.</p>

<p>"Detectives outside," Todhunter whispered hoarsely, "from the
gaming squad!"</p>

<p>The newsagent's face went the color of putty and his eyes
popped like corks. "Are you sure?" he whispered back.</p>

<p>"Quite!" breathed Todhunter. "Billikin and Brown! One's in
overalls and the other's got a railway man's uniform."</p>

<p>Quick as the strike of a snake, the newsagent grabbed up a
small box from under the counter and darted into the room behind
the shop. Todhunter began turning over some Christmas cards in a
tray on the counter. Two, three, almost five minutes passed, and
the newsagent returned into the shop. "All serene," he grinned.
"Everything gone into the kitchen fire, and I've doctored the
phone so that it won't ring. Thank you very much, sir, I'm sure.
I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><br>
BUT the shop door opened violently and the two detectives,
accompanied by two other men burst in. "We're police," snapped
one, "and we've come to search your premises. We suspect you of
illegal betting. Come out from behind that counter and keep your
hands out of your pockets."</p>

<p>Todhunter at once made himself scarce, but he heard all about
it the next day. Of course, the police had found nothing.</p>

<p>"Not even a bit of burnt paper," grinned the newsagent, "and
one of the 'tecs sat for a good half hour before the blooming
phone, all ready for my customers to ring up bets, before he
tumbled to it that it was out of order. Didn't I just laugh and
weren't they just wild about it?"</p>

<p>Now it might have been thought that so narrow an escape would
have warned Todhunter of the risks he was running, for he knew
quite well that any public conviction for black-marketing would
lose him his situation in the taxation office and all the
benefits of more than 20 years' service. But no, he didn't take
the warning, and his next lapse was as serious as could be, for
he was hindering the war effort by buying black-market
petrol.</p>

<p>He happened to mention where he was accustomed to get his
monthly two-gallon allowance of petrol that the ration was so
small he would not be able to take the usual motor holiday at
Christmas.</p>

<p>Whereupon the garage man said that, though <i>HE</i> could
not give him any extra spirit, he knew of a party who could, and
it ended in six four-gallon tins being delivered to Todhunter,
late one night, at 30/the tin. They were hidden away under some
old sacks at the back of the garage.</p>

<p>The man who brought the tins had furtive-looking, beady eyes,
and Todhunter felt ashamed of himself for having any dealings
with him. Now, for the first time, when he told his wife about
the unlawful petrol, she was most angry about it.</p>

<p>"It isn't worth it," she said sharply, "for a man in your
position can't afford to take such risks. Your whole career will
be ruined if it's found out."</p>

<p>"I know that," admitted Todhunter uneasily, "but who's going
to split on me? No, I'm quite safe."</p>

<p><br>
THERE, however, he was entirely wrong, for he was reckoning
without Mrs. Coshey. Mrs. Coshey was the washer-lady and, of
alcoholic habits and erratic ways, there was never anything but
an armed neutrality between her and Mrs. McStottlebaugh. On the
Monday before Christmas she came to work an hour late, smelling
strongly of malt liquor and hiccuping explosively with every
word she spoke.</p>

<p>She was obviously in no condition to do her work properly,
and was told so in no uncertain way. Whereupon she 'downed
tools' instantly&mdash;in her case that meant dropping a cake of
soap&mdash;demanded 'her time' and took herself off, muttering
vengeance, with her hat all askew.</p>

<p>The next day the Liquid Fuel Board received a badly scrawled
anonymous letter informing them the people at 17 Boomerang
terrace had a large store of petrol in their garage, hidden
under sacks.</p>

<p>That same afternoon two grim-faced men from the board arrived
at Todhunter's house and, stating where they came from, demanded
to go over the garage. His wife, who answered the door, realised
at once there was no help for it and took them there, hoping
against hope they would not notice the sacks. However, they
pounced upon them immediately and exposed the row of neatly
soldered tins. With a last desperate attempt to put them off,
poor Mrs. Mac said the tins contained only water.</p>

<p>"WE are starting for a camping holiday on Saturday," she
explained, "and always take our own water with us. When we are
away my husband is most particular what water the children
drink."</p>

<p>The men half-smiled, and one of them said gravely, "I'm
sorry, Madam, but it will be our duty to open them, to see if
what you say is correct."</p>

<p>Some three-quarters of an hour later Todhunter arrived home
in a state of great jubilation, having acquired no less than
three more small packets of mustard. He found his wife lying
back in an armchair, looking very pale and exhausted.</p>

<p>"But what's the matter, Mary," he asked anxiously. "Are you
feeling ill?"</p>

<p>"Two men from the Liquid Fuel Board have just been," she said
brokenly, "and they insisted upon going into the garage."</p>

<p>Todhunter had gone as white as a ghost. "But did they notice
the tins?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"That's all they came for," she nodded. "They knew they were
there, and went straight to them at once. That horrible Mrs.
Coshey must have given us away out of spite. Of course, she had
been spying about and looked under the sacks, but I told the men
the tins contained only water which we're taking away with us on
our holiday at the week-end. But they didn't believe me, and
said they must open them to see."</p>

<p>"And did they open them?" asked Todhunter, hardly able to get
out his words and, when she had nodded miserably, he sank down
weakly on to the sofa. "Serves me right," he choked. "Now it
means disgrace and being turned out of the service. Oh. what a
fool I've been!"</p>

<p>His wife was half-crying and half-laughing. "Yes, you have,"
she cried hysterically, "and such, a big one, too."</p>

<p>Then, to his amazement, she darted over to him and threw her
arms round his neck. "But I won't punish you any more, dear,"
she went on, "though I wanted to scare you just a little, so
that you shouldn't be so silly again. No, you're not going to be
disgraced and everything is all right."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean?" he voiced. "You've just said they
opened the tins."</p>

<p>"And so they did," she cried, "but they found that all they
had got in them&mdash;&mdash;" she paused
dramatically&mdash;"was what I had said they had, just water,
plain water!" She laughed merrily. "Oh, you great gaby, that
black-market petrol man had cheated you and you paid him £9 for
six tins of water!"</p>

<p>Todhunter tried hard to feel furious, but his relief was so
great that he had difficulty in preventing himself from
crying.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you should have seen their faces." his wife went
on. "At first they looked thunderstruck, and were furious with
me for laughing. Then, though I am sure they suspected something
fishy, they had to laugh, too, and, in the end, off they went,
apologising to me most politely for the annoyance they had
given."</p>

<p>Todhunter is a reformed character now, and no longer has any
dealings with the black market. Also, the provision shops know
him no more. However, he is always on the look-out for the man
who sold him those tins of water, though should he meet him he
is not quite certain what he will do&mdash;give him a black eye
or offer to stand him a drink.</p>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 17 March 1945</h3>

<p class="first">FOR many years Reuben Leyden had been one of
the best-known diamond dealers in Hatton Garden and it was said
that, almost fabulous sums of money had at times, in the course
of a few minutes, changed hands in his modest suite of rooms. Of
a shrewd and intellectual countenance, he was a rather
frail-looking small man of slight physique. He had a peculiar
melodious voice, with just the trace of Dutch accent in his
speech. His office staff consisted of three girl clerks and a
burly pugilistic attendant. This latter was always well within
call.</p>

<p>One morning two new clients called at Leyden's place of
business. Both men were about middle age.</p>

<p>One was tall and aristocratic looking, smartly, and even
foppishly dressed, and sporting a large monocle. The other, of
much heavier build, was well-dressed, too, his right arm,
however, with the hand swathed in a thick bandage, was carried
in a sling.</p>

<p>"I want to see Mr. Leyden," drawled the tall man to the
pugilistic attendant who had come forward. "I'm Sir Francis
Bessington," and he handed over his visiting card. The attendant
looked questioningly at the second man. "Major von Swartz,"
snapped the latter in gutteral tones. "We are friends."</p>

<p>The card was taken into the inner office, and, a few seconds
later, the two visitors were ushered into Reuben Leyden, who was
seated behind a big table desk. The attendant followed them,
and, after pushing to the door, but not closing it, seated
himself down at a small desk in a corner of the room, and began
busying himself with some papers. He had an automatic pistol in
his pocket. Leyden never took any chances with strangers.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the dealer's good morning with a curt nod, Sir
Francis produced a fair-sized diamond from some cotton-wool in a
small box and handed it across the desk.</p>

<p>"I want to know what you'll match this stone for," he
said.</p>

<p>Leyden motioned them both to chairs, and proceeded to examine
the diamond under a powerful magnifying glass. "It is a goot
stone," he remarked presently, "quite a goot stone."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," snapped the men with the bandaged hand,
"and I know something about diamonds, as I lived in Johannesburg
for a couple of years." He added rudely, "I've come here with my
friend to make sure he pays no extortionate price."</p>

<p>Leyden smiled. "No one pays me an extortionate price," he
said gently. "I'm quite a fair dealer," and pulling a glass case
containing some fine scales before him, he proceeded to weigh
the diamond carefully. "Yes, I can match it," he said, and
rising from his chair, he passed out of sight into a small inner
room leading out of his office.</p>

<p>Returning very quickly with a small cardboard box in his
hand, from some tissue paper he spilled about a dozen glittering
stones on to a small square of black velvet, which he had taken
from a drawer in the desk. After some consideration, he picked
out one and placed it side by side with the one Sir Francis had
brought with him. "It will cost you £110," he said. "As I told
you, yours is a goot stone, but mine is even a little
better."</p>

<p>"Too much," snapped the German. "You must take off £20." He
turned to Sir Francis and spoke rapidly in his own tongue. "The
price is quite reasonable, but we must beat him down. I'll do
all the arguing because you are always such a fool in making a
bargain."</p>

<p>"Ja, ja," nodded Sir Francis.</p>

<p>He could not have continued the conversation further in
German as 'Ja' and 'Nein' were the only words he knew.</p>

<p>Von Swartz turned back to the dealer. "Yes, we offer you
£90."</p>

<p>The dealer shook his head. "But I cannot sell at that price.
You are getting goot value at £110, the best of values."</p>

<p>"Let's have your magnifying glass," said the German. "It's a
bit awkward for me with this poisoned hand." He examined the
stone carefully, and then asked, "Been all your life in
diamonds, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"All my life," nodded the dealer. "And my family, for four
generations, have been all cutters or dealers." He spoke
proudly. "It was my father who cut the great Cullinan diamond
for His Majesty King Edward VII. He was more than two years on
the work."</p>

<p>Von Swartz looked more amiable, and finally it was agreed to
pay the sum asked.</p>

<p>The two then took their leave, with the intimation that they
might be returning in a day or two for some more stones, as Sr
Francis was intending to make up a necklace. The attendant was
asked to call a taxi, and given half a crown as a tip.</p>

<p>Driving away, the German, speaking now in much less gutteral
tones, asked rather anxiously. "Well, do you think you can do
it, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Sure, after a little practice at home," grinned the other,
and he added in a good imitation of the dealer's voice, "It is a
goot stone, and I cannot sell for less." He laughed. "But do you
think he understood what you said in German?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did," replied von Swartz. "I tell you I know
for certain he lived for some time in Stuttgart and that his
wife's a German."</p>

<p>He nodded. "What I said then would convince him we were just
ordinary buyers."</p>

<p>The following day the two returned again, and with the
attendant a witness of the transaction, bought another diamond,
this time paying £130 for a slightly bigger one.</p>

<p>They seemed much more friendly now, and as if they no longer
thought they were going to be cheated. "And some time within the
next month or so," drawled the man who was passing himself off
as Sir Francis Bessington, "I may be bringing you the necklace
for which I am wanting these new stones." He sighed heavily.
"The ladies are deuced expensive, particularly the extra pretty
ones."</p>

<p>Out in the street again, the man who had called himself von
Swartz said confidently, "Now, next time I shall be very
surprised if the old devil keeps that ugly brute of an attendant
in the room. Jews are naturally secretive, and he won't like the
man seeing too much of what business he is doing and guessing at
the big profits he must be making."</p>

<p>He shook his head vexatiously. "Still, until he is cleared
out we can't do a thing."</p>

<p>Two days later they were back in the dealer's office, and
they cursed deeply when the attendant prepared to take up his
accustomed seat. However, Leyden made a slight adjustment to the
position of the ink well upon his desk, and, that being an
arranged signal, to the great relief of the two visitors, the
man at once proceeded to leave the room. Still, he only pulled
the door to and did not quite close it.</p>

<p>Very soon quite a good assortment of diamonds were spread out
upon the dealer's little square of black velvet, and he was
pointing out their beauty and value. The German had moved up
closer to the desk table to get a better view.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, von Swartz's injured hand slipped from its
bandage and, quick as the strike of a snake, had shot out over
the desk and gripped the dealer fiercely by the throat. The
latter had not had the very fraction of a second's warning, and
he uttered no cry and made no sound as the German threw himself
over the desk and lifted him bodily out of his chair. The
strange thing, however, was that it seemed the dealer was still
talking, and even in slightly louder tones than before.</p>

<p>"But they are goot stones," came his melodious voice, "and
the best that money can buy."</p>

<p>With the Jew black in the face, and now quite unconscious,
von Swartz laid him noiselessly upon the floor and, slipping on
a pair of gloves, darted into the little inner room where the
precious stones were always kept.</p>

<p>"But you must really knock off £100, Mr. Leyden," came the
slow, drawling voice of Sir Francis, "and then we'll call it a
deal." And the voice of the dealer answered back that he could
not possibly reduce his price.</p>

<p>Then for some minutes an imaginary conversation was carried
on, with the rumble of the voices clearly audible in the
adjoining room.</p>

<p>The dual speaker had nerves of steel, and his voice never
trembled, but for all that, his face had blanched a horrid
sickly colour, and his forehead was pricked out in little beads
of sweat. Success or failure was now balanced on the razor's
edge, and everything depended upon what happened in the next few
minutes.</p>

<p>There&mdash;uncovered for all to see&mdash;was the dreadful
face of the throttled dealer, while a bare 10 yards away, and
with an unclosed door between sat the all unconscious office
staff.</p>

<p>Another caller arriving to see the dealer, a message for him
on the phone, and dammit! It would mean death on the scaffold
for them both! That fool, Bert, had such a heavy hand, and it
was any odds the Jew was dead!</p>

<p>The German reappeared at last, patting his pockets
significantly, and his voice was now heard in the brief
conversation which ensued.</p>

<p>It seemed a bargain was quickly struck and the money passed
over. Leyden was heard bidding his customers good-bye, and von
Swartz came smilingly into the outer office. Sir Francis,
however, lingered for half a minute or so at the open door of
the dealer's room, laughingly chiding Leyden for having extorted
so much good money for a few paltry stones.</p>

<p>Then came the critical moment as Sir Francis pulled to
Leyden's door, and the two companions prepared to leave the
building. As once before, the attendant was asked to call a
taxi, and it happened a disengaged one was found close by.
Another half-crown tip was passed over, and the attendant stood
on the pavement watching them drive away.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed, and then one of the girls went
in to her employer to inquire if she could now go out for her
lunch. What she saw when she entered the room, however, quite
took away all desire for food.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">ONE morning some three weeks later the Chief
Commissioner of Police was talking to one of the head
detective-inspectors of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The latter seemed in a very despondent mood. "And as far as I
can see, sir," he said, "there seems little hope now of picking
up any clue. Beyond that the murderers must have been in close
touch with Sir Francis Bessington, as evidenced by their making
use of one of his stolen visiting cards the very morning after
he had left Southampton for the United States we have found out
practically nothing. We have uncovered no trace of any foreigner
he knew whose description would answer to that of the supposed
Major von Swartz, and the identity of the other killer is
equally as unknown. Yes, we are completely at a dead end."</p>

<p>"It's unfortunate," sighed the Commissioner, "as the
newspapers are so very vicious and clamouring for our
blood."</p>

<p>Now it happened that at that very moment when this
disconsolate conversion was taking place at Scotland Yard two
men had just arrived at Euston to catch the Scotch express. They
had booked for Glasgow and looked just ordinary men, tourists it
might have been, off upon a holiday. One was tall and slim, and
the other of much stouter build.</p>

<p>Just from force of habit, perhaps, they glanced round
quickly, as they entered a first-class carriage.</p>

<p>No one appeared to be interested in them, and no one,
apparently, gave them a second thought.</p>

<p>Taking two corner seats opposite each other by the window, it
seemed they were going to have the compartment to themselves,
but a minute or two before the train started an elderly and
rather distinguished-looking old gentleman with white hair
entered hurriedly and took possession of a corner seat on the
corridor side.</p>

<p>He was followed immediately by another man, obviously his
servant and probably his butler, in ordinary clothes. This
latter placed a small suitcase upon the rack, handed his master
a small handbag and a rug, and mouthed rather than asked if he
could do anything more.</p>

<p>The old gentleman shook his head and, taking a magazine out
of his bag, at once proceeded to read. Whereupon his servant
turned to the other two occupants of the carriage and said most
respectfully:</p>

<p>"My master is stone deaf, gentlemen, and could not hear if a
gun were fired off right under his ear. So, if anyone comes to
see his ticket will you very kindly explain to the collector
that he must nudge him to attract his attention."</p>

<p>The two men said smilingly that they would.</p>

<p>The train started upon its long journey without anyone else
coming into the carriage and the two companions, evidently in
high spirits and thinking it a good joke, began to chip the deaf
old gentleman.</p>

<p>They called him 'Old Snoozer,' and asked him where he'd left
his best girl. Then they addressed him by names which were by no
means polite, suggesting that his parentage, at any rate upon
his mother's side, was a matter he would no doubt like to
forget. They remarked, too, that he looked 'a hardened old
whats-er-name,' and shook with merriment at their own wit.</p>

<p>Getting tired of their play at last, they left him alone and
talked between themselves.</p>

<p>The old gentleman read on for some time, and then, probably
for a change of occupation, put down his magazine and, taking a
pad out of his bag, proceeded to write.</p>

<p>The whole time he never once lifted his eyes or took the very
slightest notice of the two men. At Crewe the inspector came to
examine the tickets, and it seemed that the old gentleman was
not only deaf, but also very stupid, as for a long time he could
not remember where he had put his ticket.</p>

<p>At last, however the inspector found it for him among the
muddled-up papers in his bag. The old gentleman then handed over
a tip with a pleasant word of thanks.</p>

<p>Later on more passengers entered the compartment, but nothing
out of the ordinary happened until Carlisle was reached, and
then, before even the train had been brought to a standstill, a
police inspector had swung himself on board and, followed by
three men in plainclothes, had hurried along the corridor
straight to the compartment containing the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Taking no notice of him, however, he pushed his way in
straight up to the two men who had also come on the train at
Euston. "I want a word with you two gentlemen," he said sharply,
"so will you please come to the stationmaster's office with me
at once."</p>

<p>The men gasped in consternation, and then the right hand of
the shorter of them darted back to his hip-pocket, but the
inspector threw himself upon him and jerked out the hand again
which was now seen to be clutching to an automatic. A fierce but
brief struggle ensued before the man was secured and carried
out.</p>

<p>His companion, as white as death, gave no trouble, and was
taken out, too. It was all over very quickly, and, in a few
minutes the journey northwards was resumed in the usual way.</p>

<p>The evening of the following day the Chief Commissioner of
Police left Scotland Yard in an obviously most cheerful frame of
mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," he said to his wife after dinner, "of course
it was a most wonderful piece of luck."</p>

<p>"Though all the credit of their arrests will come to us,
every bit of it belongs to old Lord Barnstable."</p>

<p>"But what on earth had it to do with him?" asked his
wife.</p>

<p>"Everything," laughed the Commissioner, "for it was he who
landed them high and dry into our net. It was like this:</p>

<p>"It appears that when upon a train journey the old boy has a
perfect horror of being drawn into boring conversations with
other travellers, and so, when his man had fixed him up in a
seat he has orders to tell anyone else in the carriage that his
master is stone deaf, and will they very kindly explain that to
any ticket collector who comes round."</p>

<p>"This happened yesterday, when his lordship took his seat in
the Scotch Express. His man told the tale to two men, the only
other passengers in the carriage. Then when the train had
started upon its journey, these men, as a vulgar sort of joke,
began abusing his lordship and calling him all sorts of
unpleasant names, quite sure, of course, that he wouldn't hear a
word.</p>

<p>"Presently, the joke beginning to wear a bit thin, they took
to discussing their own affairs, and his lordship pricked up his
ears when they began talking about the Hatton Garden murder. In
a few minutes he was quite certain the crime had been their
work, and that they were then actually carrying the diamonds on
them. They even mentioned the name of the fence in Glasgow they
were taking them to."</p>

<p>"But how could they have been so stupid!" exclaimed his
wife.</p>

<p>The Commissioner laughed. "We learnt later they had shared a
large bottle of champagne at the refreshment buffet at Euston
before getting on the train, and it was that, no doubt, which
was making them so lively. At any rate, to go on with the story,
his lordship stopped reading and started writing letters. He
wrote three as a blind.</p>

<p>"Then when the ticket inspectors came round at the Crewe, His
Lordship pretended to be very muddled and unable to find his
ticket, and it ended in the inspector helping him to go through
the bag.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;right on the top of some papers&mdash;the man
saw an envelope addressed to the stationmaster at Crewe and
marked in big letters, 'Urgent&mdash;very urgent. Deliver
instantly.'</p>

<p>"Fortunately, in bending over the bag, the inspector had had
his back turned to the two men at the other end of the carriage,
and in consequence they did not see him pick up the envelope.
Within five minutes the stationmaster was phoning us at the
Yard. Lord Barnstable's word was good enough for us, and we got
ready to arrest the men at Carlisle."</p>

<p>He chuckled. "And now, as His Lordship refuses to allow the
part he played to become known, as I say, we shall get all the
credit, and the public may never learn how we were helped."</p>

<p>"But who were the men?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"One was a fourth-rate provincial actor, and the other whom
we believe to have been the actual killer because of his
strength, was the cloakroom attendant at the Ormonde, Sir
Francis Bessington's favourite club."</p>

<p>The Commissioner frowned. "Ah, but for one little false step
at that club we should have been right on the bullseye, and
perhaps have uncovered the wretches ourselves.</p>

<p>"Our mistake there was that we looked for a German who would
have known Sir Francis was going to America, instead of trying
to find a man who SPOKE German. This cloakroom fellow had been a
prisoner in Germany for nearly four years during the last war,
and spoke the language almost like a native."</p>

<p>His face cleared. "Never mind, all's well that ends well, and
I may even get a knighthood out of this, with any luck."</p>

<h2><a id="DOP-1948-08-07"></a>THE BISHOP'S DILEMMA</h2>

<div align="center">
<img src="2100091h-images/TheBishopsDilemma-1.png"

</div>

<h3>As published in <i>The Mail</i>, Adelaide, 7 August 1948.</h3>

<p class="first">NOW there could he no doubt his Right
Reverence, Matthew Bossington-Brown, Bishop of Mungalatoo, was
of a decided and masterful personality. Of strong evangelistic
principles, he ruled his diocese, if not with the proverbial rod
of iron, at least with a rod of the new plastic material in
every way as hard and unbending. He exacted an implicit
obedience from all his clergy, and woe betide one who wanted to
wear a biretta, officiate in too ornate vestments, or indulge in
any practices he considered to be too ritualistic in their
tendencies.</p>

<p>His powers of organisation were excellent; he allowed no
slackness; at all times he was grimly determined to make his
denomination a vital force in the community. A strict moralist,
he was old-fashioned in many of his ideas. He hated to see women
smoking, he disapproved strongly of lip-stick, a painted face
was his abomination. He thought short skirts cheapening to the
sex and, indeed, all attenuated garments found ill-favor in his
sight. Out of step with the latter-day world, he nevertheless
practised all he preached, and, accordingly, if not particularly
well-liked, he was greatly respected. With no children, he was
married to a prim and rather austere-looking woman a few years
older than himself.</p>

<p>In the early sixties, in appearance, Mr. Bishop was tall and
gaunt. He had big fierce eyes under bushy brows and was
clean-shaven except for well-trimmed short whiskers. He was always
impeccably dressed as if he had just come straight from his
clerical tailor.</p>

<p>One hot and sultry Monday morning he set out in his car to
return home from a weekend spent in a small town some 200 miles
up-country. He had been holding confirmation and it could not be
said everything had gone off to his satisfaction. There should,
he thought, have been more candidates to be confirmed, the
offertories should have been larger, and altogether that the
vicar was not zealous enough in his work. Apart from church
matters, too, the arrangements made for his stay at the vicarage
had not pleased him.</p>

<p>The cooking had been bad and given him indigestion, the table
manners of the vicar's seven offspring had been disgusting, and,
worst of all, the vicar's pigs had greatly annoyed him. Their
sty was unduly close to the house, and not only did their
fearsome odor penetrate strongly up to his bedroom, but also
their grunting and snorting had kept him awake the greater part
of the night.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning he had complained about the horrid
animals and been assured they should trouble him no more the
next night, as they had been removed to a shed some distance
away. However, the brutes had somehow managed to escape, and,
unawed by the episcopal wrath, long before it was light had
begun rooting noisily in the flower bed actually under his very
window. There had been no more sleep for him then. The only
consolation he had had was in realising what havoc the pigs must
have made in the vicarage garden.</p>

<p>Irritable and cross, the bishop was very glad to say good-bye
after breakfast, though it was certainly a dreadful morning to
be starting upon his long journey back home. Not a breath of air
was stirring, and, though no sun was shining, the heat was
terrific. The sky was black and low, and he had been warned to
get on to the bitumen, nearly 100 miles away, as quickly as
possible, as there were all signs of a big rain developing.</p>

<p>A few miles upon his journey he was in a bath of perspiration
from head to foot, and his clerical attire was altogether too
much for him. So, the road being lonely and unfrequented, he
pulled up his car and stripped off his outer garments, collar,
episcopal gaiters, and all. These he folded tidily and thrust in
his suitcase, donning in their stead a pair of rather oily
overalls, which he always carried with him in case he had to
change a tyre, and a light dustcoat which he buttoned up to his
chin. Thus attired, he told himself he looked anything but the
high and important church dignitary he was. But he did not
expect to have to get out of the car again until he had driven
it right into his own garage.</p>

<p>Much more comfortable now, he was making quick progress until
a few miles farther on, when a man, standing by a stationary
car, hailed him, and he had to stop. The man said his car had
broken down and might take a long time to put right, so would
the bishop very kindly give a lift to a young woman passenger as
far as a railway station, about 10 miles up the road.</p>

<p>The bishop looked at the young woman who had now got out of
the stranded car. His immediate impression was by no means a
pleasant one. She was of the type he so disliked, very
short-skirted, all painted up, and with an impudent smile upon her
pert little face. Of course, he could not refuse, however, and
so her suitcase was bundled into the back of the car next to his
own, and with all the assurance in the world she took her seat
beside him.</p>

<p>As he had surmised from her appearance, there was nothing
backward about the young woman. She started at once to open up a
lively and intimate conversation, at least on her side, as the
bishop spoke as little as he could. Presently, she remarked she
loved dancing, and asked him if he did not, too.</p>

<p>"And how do you know I have ever danced at all?" he asked
with a frown.</p>

<p>"Of course you have," she giggled. "I'll bet you've been a
gay old dog in your time. You look like one now," and she went
on to expatiate upon the many dances she had been to, and the
good times she had had with her boys. The bishop was
scandalised, and devoutly thankful when the railway station was
reached and he could drop her and her suitcase.</p>

<p>Then, only a few miles farther on, his troubles began. The
skies opened and the rain came down, almost in a solid sheet of
water so it seemed. Very soon the car began to slither and
slide, and the bishop had the greatest difficulty in keeping to
the road. Every minute the going got worse and worse, and in the
two ensuing hours he barely made 30 miles. Twice he got stuck,
and with difficulty extricated himself in reverse and went on
again.</p>

<p>At length, just as he was realising he would not be able to
plough his way through the heavy going much longer, he saw a
small hotel just beyond a wide sheet of water covering the
entire breadth of the road. He thought it was impossible for him
to get through, but, accelerating fiercely, he just managed it,
and drew up in a state of exhaustion before the hotel door.</p>

<p>Quite a number of people on the hotel verandah had been
watching him and shouting encouragement to come on, with one of
them, he saw, taking snaps of him as he arrived. The landlord of
the hotel came forward and told him where his car should be
parked.</p>

<p>"You're lucky I can give you a room," said the man. "I've got
a crowd stuck up here already and you're about the last I can
take in."</p>

<p>"But I only want to stop until the rain is over," frowned the
bishop, "I hope to go on again this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You won't do that," laughed the man grimly, "and I shouldn't
like to say when the roads'll be fit for motors again. We've
been having tremendous rain. Some of the telephone poles are
already down and we're cut off from everywhere. What is your
name?" He caught the last syllable. "Then come in, Mr. Brown,
I'll show you to your room." Carrying his suit case, the bishop
followed him to the back of the building.</p>

<p>Left to himself, the bishop took off his dustcoat with the
intention, after a good wash, of resuming his clerical clothes.
Then, suddenly, he smelt a peculiar odor, one he had smelt so
often upon hot evenings in the cathedral, the smell of face
powder and scent.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from the direction of his suitcase which he
had thrown upon the bed. Very puzzled, he proceeded to undo the
straps. Throwing back the lid, right on the top was a woman's
nightdress, blue with dainty pink ribbons. Not crediting the
evidence of his eyes, he snatched up the garment, and to his
horror came upon two pairs of scanties underneath. He knew what
they were instantly from the obscene advertisements of certain
city departmental stores which had often caught his eyes in the
daily newspapers.</p>

<p>His breath almost choked as he realised what had happened. He
had given that horrid girl his suitcase instead of hers. They
were so much alike, and in his haste to get rid of her he could
understand the mistake. Great heavens! then he was landed among
strange people in this awful little public house with nothing
but the things he stood up in&mdash;no clerical clothes, no
shaving apparatus, no comb or hairbrush, nothing at all!</p>

<p>But his equanimity soon returned. It was most annoying, but
really what did it matter? He would have to go on wearing just
what he had got on, but in all probability, among the other
people held up in the hotel his attire would be nothing out of
the way. They would be just country folk who were accustomed to
go about in anything and, not crediting the hotel-keeper's
gloomy forecast of the weather, it might be only for a few hours
and he would be off again in the morning. He would tell no one
who he was, and so far from the city, particularly as he was not
in clerical clothes, it was hardly likely he would be
recognised. He would not say anything about the changed
suitcases either, because if it got in the newspapers it might
easily bring ridicule upon the cloth.</p>

<p>The midday meal was taken at a long table in the crowded
little dining room. There were 10 others there, and though some
of them were well dressed, as he had expected, they looked just
very ordinary people, and not of the cultured class. He was just
given a general good-day, and then no one took any more notice
of him. He made no attempt to join in the conversation as it
didn't interest him, being all about the splendid rain, crops,
the price of sheep, and horse racing.</p>

<p>He spent a very boring afternoon, looking out of the window
at the still pouring rain. There appeared to be no books in the
hotel, no reading matter at all except some out-of-date daily
newspapers. Some of the others played cards, but not being a
card player, he did not join in. To the few remarks made to him,
he gave only curt responses, and continued to be left alone.</p>

<p>One of the other people staying there was a stout, red-faced
man, who, the landlord whispered, was one of the most important
men in the State, "Sid Stevens, our biggest bookmaker! You could
win a couple of thousand from him and he wouldn't turn a hair,"
the landlord said. The bishop sighed deeply as he thought of the
public estimation of the values of the various services rendered
to them.</p>

<p>The next morning the rain was still falling, and the hotel
was now surrounded by a wide belt of water. It was an
uncomfortable day for the bishop. He was unkempt and unshaven
because, fearful of infection, he would not beg the loan of a
razor from anyone. He knew from their covert glances in his
direction that some of the other guests were becoming curious
about him. He was quite aware his was a face which looked
shocking when he had not shaved, even for one day.</p>

<p>That evening came a dreadful happening. For a few minutes the
bishop experienced perhaps the most worried moments of his
life.</p>

<p>They had just sat down to the evening meal when the last to
arrive was a flashy, overdressed woman, whose make-up had often
offended the bishop's eye. She came in with a white and
frightened face, closely followed by the landlord. The latter
pushed to the door behind him and announced hoarsely, "Ladies
and gentlemen, a dreadful thing has happened in my hotel.
Someone has stolen this lady's pearl necklace, which she values
at £700. We have a thief among us here."</p>

<p>A startled silence filled the room. All eyes were upon the
landlord. He went on sternly. "Yes, I regret to say the thief
must be one of you here. It is impossible my wife or I could
have taken the necklace, and our two helps are my cousins, and
have been with me for more than 10 years.
Also&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," broke in the bookmaker, sharply, "when was the
necklace stolen?"</p>

<p>"It must have been this afternoon," said the owner of the
necklace, almost in tears. "I saw it in the drawer in my
wardrobe just after lunch, and 10 minutes ago I found it had
gone."</p>

<p>The landlord went on. "Now, no one from outside the hotel can
have taken it, because the floodwaters would have prevented
anyone getting near the place." He looked most distressed. "So I
must ask you all to allow yourselves and your luggage to be
searched."</p>

<p>"Well, that's simple," said a commercial traveller, "and no
one can object."</p>

<p>The bishop went icy cold in horror. Search the suitcase in
his room and find him in possession of those awful female
garments! Suppose it came out later who he was and the
newspapers got hold of the story&mdash;what a disgrace it would
be to the church!</p>

<p>He spoke up quickly, to scotch the idea at once. "Nonsense,"
he exclaimed, "the necklace can't have been taken! The lady has
just mislaid it. Let her look again." His voice was firm. "I,
for one, refuse to be searched."</p>

<p>Everyone looked astounded and several called out at once,
"But why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," said the bishop coldly&mdash;he looked round
scornfully&mdash;"I am a clergyman and the search would be
degrading to my cloth."</p>

<p>A moment's gasp of astonishment, and the atmosphere of the
room became almost hilarious. What, this unshaven, unkempt
fellow a clergyman! This grubby-looking extraordinary dressed
individual a&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>"Unfrocked?" asked one man, trying to be funny.</p>

<p>"Test him out," cried another. "Let him say the Ten
Commandments."</p>

<p>The bishop's face was black with anger, but what his retort
would have been will never be known, for the door burst open and
the landlord's wife came running quickly into the room. "It's
found!" she exclaimed excitedly. "My little girl&mdash;she's
only three&mdash;had taken it to bed with her. Oh, I'm so
sorry."</p>

<p>It was some minutes before anyone had quietened down, except
the bishop, who had at once calmly resumed his soup. The
bookmaker spoke up smilingly. "Look here," he said, indicating
the bishop, "whoever this gentleman may be, some of us have not
been over-polite to him, and I should like to make some amends."
He raised his voice. "Landlord, bring half a dozen bottles of
your best champagne." The commercial traveller led the applause
which followed.</p>

<p>The bishop had full command of the occasion. "And let this be
a lesson to you good people," he said, in his best pontifical
manner, "not to judge anyone by appearances. You see me as I am
now, because, unhappily, I lost my luggage in that storm." And
that was all they could get out of him, even after two glasses
of champagne.</p>

<p>The rain stopped at last and a strong, drying wind sprang up.
With all prospects of resuming his journey the following
afternoon, the bishop thought his troubles were practically
over. Alas, however, another bad one was yet come. In the
morning after breakfast all the marooned travellers were
standing about on the verandah, rejoicing in a hot sun which was
quickly drying up the roads, when a horse and trap with four
people headed past the hotel.</p>

<p>Suddenly an excited voice called shrilly, "Stop, stop,
there's the old guy who went off with my beautiful nightie and
all my other things." The bishop, to his horror, realised the
voice came from the girl whose suitcase he had got in his
room.</p>

<p>Very red in the face, he brought the suitcase out, but the
excited girl would insist upon opening it then and there in
front of them all to make sure her belongings were intact. In a
loud voice and to a highly interested audience, she proceeded to
relate what had happened. However, she accompanied the
explanation with so many nods and grins that several of those
present were half inclined to believe she was not telling the
whole story.</p>

<p>Then, to crown all, the man who had been driving the trap,
after staring hard at the bishop for some minutes, suddenly
recognised him and addressed him by name. He assured him that
the episcopal suitcase was quite safe and at a certain railway
station all ready to be despatched to the city. The hotel guests
were staggered, but several of them were quick to try to make
out to one another that all along they had thought the
ill-dressed stranger was no ordinary man.</p>

<p>THE poor bishop arrived home that evening, devoutly hoping
nothing of his adventure would become public property. Alas, it
did, and the following week the issue of a scandal-loving
newspaper proceeded to entertain its readers with a spicy story
of a highly placed ecclesiastic&mdash;it mentioned no
name&mdash;who was found in possession of certain most intimate
female garments upon arriving solo at a country hotel.</p>

<p>The bishop was certain everyone guessed who the ecclesiastic
was, and, in consequence, was by no means gratified at the large
congregations which, for many weeks after, gathered in every
church where it had been announced he was going to preach.</p>
