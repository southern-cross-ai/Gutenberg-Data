  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

  <p class="first">Beside the rear window of the blacksmith shop Jasper Lanning
  held his withered arms folded against his chest. With the dispassionate eye
  and the aching heart of an artist he said to himself that his life work was a
  failure. That life work was the young fellow who swung the sledge at the
  forge, and truly it was a strange product for this seventy-year-old veteran
  with his slant Oriental eyes and his narrow beard of white. Andrew Lanning
  was not even his son, but it came about in this way that Andrew became the
  life work of Jasper.</p>

  <p>Fifteen years before, the father of Andy died, and Jasper rode out of the
  mountain desert like a hawk dropping out of the pale-blue sky. He buried his
  brother without a tear, and then sat down and looked at the slender child who
  bore his name. Andy was a beautiful boy. He had the black hair and eyes, the
  well-made jaw, and the bone of the Lannings, and if his mouth was rather soft
  and girlish he laid the failing to the weakness of childhood. Jasper had no
  sympathy for tenderness in men. His own life was as littered with hard deeds
  as the side of a mountain with boulders. But the black, bright eyes and the
  well- made jaw of little Andy laid hold on him, and he said to himself: "I'm
  fifty- five. I'm about through with my saddle days. I'll settle down and turn
  out one piece of work that'll last after I'm gone, and last with my signature
  on it!"</p>

  <p>That was fifteen years ago. And for fifteen years he had labored to make
  Andy a man according to a grim pattern which was known in the Lanning clan,
  and elsewhere in the mountain desert. His program was as simple as the
  curriculum of a Persian youth. On the whole, it was even simpler, for Jasper
  concentrated on teaching the boy how to ride and shoot, and was not at all
  particular that he should learn to speak the truth. But on the first two and
  greatest articles of his creed, how Jasper labored!</p>

  <p>For fifteen years he poured his heart without stint into his work! He
  taught Andy to know a horse from hock to teeth, and to ride anything that
  wore hair. He taught him to know a gun as if it were a sentient thing. He
  taught him all the draws of old and new pattern, and labored to give him both
  precision and speed. That was the work of fifteen years, and now at the end
  of this time the old man knew that his life work was a failure, for he had
  made the hand of Andrew Lanning cunning, had given his muscles strength, but
  the heart beneath was wrong.</p>

  <p>It was hard to see Andy at the first glance. A film of smoke shifted and
  eddied through the shop, and Andy, working the bellows, was a black form
  against the square of the door, a square filled by the blinding white of the
  alkali dust in the road outside and the blinding white of the sun above. Andy
  turned from the forge, bearing in his tongs a great bar of iron black at the
  ends but white in the middle. The white place was surrounded by a sparkling
  radiance. Andy caught up an eight-pound hammer, and it rose and fell lightly
  in his hand. The sparks rushed against the leather apron of the hammer
  wielder, and as the blows fell rapid waves of light were thrown against the
  face of Andrew.</p>

  <p>Looking at that face one wondered how the life work of Jasper was such a
  failure. For Andy was a handsome fellow with his blue-black hair and his
  black, rather slanting eyes, after the Lanning manner. Yet Jasper saw, and
  his heart was sick. The face was a little too full; the square bone of the
  chin was rounded with flesh; and, above all, the mouth had never changed. It
  was the mouth of the child, soft&mdash;too womanly soft. And Jasper
  blinked.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes again the white place on the iron had become a
  dull red, and the face of the blacksmith was again in shadow. All Jasper
  could see was the body of Andy, and that was much better. Red light glinted
  on the sinewy arms and the swaying shoulders, and the hammer swayed and fell
  tirelessly. For fifteen years Jasper had consoled himself with the strength
  of the boy, smooth as silk and as durable; the light form which would not
  tire a horse, but swelled above the waist into those formidable
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>Now the bar was lifted from the anvil and plunged, hissing, into the
  bucket beside the forge; above the bucket a cloud of steam rose and showed
  clearly against the brilliant square of the door, and the peculiar scent
  which came from the iron went sharply to the nostrils of Jasper. He got up as
  a horseman entered the shop. He came in a manner that pleased Jasper. There
  was a rush of hoofbeats, a form darting through the door, and in the midst of
  the shop the rider leaped out of the saddle and the horse came to a halt with
  braced legs.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you!" called the rider as he tossed the reins over the head of his
  horse. "Here's a hoss that needs iron on his feet. Fix him up. And look here"
  &mdash;he lifted a forefoot and showed the scales on the frog and sole of the
  hoof&mdash;"last time you shoed this hoss you done a sloppy job, son. You
  left all this stuff hangin' on here. I want it trimmed off nice an' neat. You
  hear?"</p>

  <p>The blacksmith shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Spoils the hoof to put the knife on the sole, Buck," said the smith.
  "That peels off natural."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Buck Heath. "How old are you, son?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, old enough," answered Andy cheerily. "Old enough to know that this
  exfoliation is entirely natural."</p>

  <p>The big word stuck in the craw of Buck Heath, who brought his thick
  eyebrows together. "I've rid horses off and on come twenty-five years," he
  declared, "and I've rid 'em long enough to know how I want 'em shod. This is
  my hoss, son, and you do it my way. That straight?"</p>

  <p>The eye of old Jasper in the rear of the shop grew dim with wistfulness as
  he heard this talk. He knew Buck Heath; he knew his kind; in his day he would
  have eaten a dozen men of such rough words and such mild deeds as Buck. But
  searching the face of Andy, he saw no resentment. Merely a quiet
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"Another thing," said Buck Heath, who seemed determined to press the thing
  to a disagreeable point. "I hear you don't fit your shoes on hot. Well?"</p>

  <p>"I never touch a hoof with hot iron," replied Andy. "It's a rotten
  practice."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said Buck Heath coldly. "Well, son, you fit my hoss with hot
  shoes or I'll know the reason why."</p>

  <p>"I've got to do the work my own way," protested Andy.</p>

  <p>A spark of hope burned in the slant eyes of Jasper.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise I can go find another gent to do my shoein'?" inquired
  Buck.</p>

  <p>"It looks that way," replied the blacksmith with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Buck, whose mildness of the last question had been merely the
  cover for a bursting wrath that now sent his voice booming, "maybe you know a
  whole pile, boy&mdash;I hear Jasper has give you consid'able education
  &mdash;but what you know is plumb wasted on me. Understand? As for lookin' up
  another blacksmith, you ought to know they ain't another shop in ten miles.
  You'll do this job, and you'll do it my way. Maybe you got another way of
  thinkin'?"</p>

  <p>There was a little pause.</p>

  <p>"It's your horse," repeated Andy. "I suppose I can do him your own
  way."</p>

  <p>Old Jasper closed his eyes in silent agony. Looking again, he saw Buck
  Heath grinning with contempt, and for a single moment Jasper touched his gun.
  Then he remembered that he was seventy years old. "Well, Buck?" he said,
  coming forward. For he felt that if this scene continued he would go mad with
  shame.</p>

  <p>There was a great change in Buck as he heard this voice, a marked respect
  was in his manner as he turned to Jasper. "Hello, Jas," he said. "I didn't
  know you was here."</p>

  <p>"Come over to the saloon, Buck, and have one on me," said Jasper. "I guess
  Andy'll have your hoss ready when we come back."</p>

  <p>"Speakin' personal," said Buck Heath with much heartiness, "I don't pass
  up no chances with no man, and particular if he's Jasper Lanning." He hooked
  his arm through Jasper's elbow. "Besides, that boy of yours has got me all
  heated up. Where'd he learn them man-sized words, Jas?"</p>

  <p>All of which Andy heard, and he knew that Buck Heath intended him to hear
  them. It made Andy frown, and for an instant he thought of calling Buck back.
  But he did not call. Instead he imagined what would happen. Buck would turn
  on his heel and stand, towering, in the door. He would ask what Andy wanted.
  Andy chose the careful insult which he would throw in Buck's face. He saw the
  blow given. He felt his own fist tingle as he returned the effort with
  interest. He saw Buck tumble back over the bucket of water.</p>

  <p>By this time Andy was smiling gently to himself. His wrath had dissolved,
  and he was humming pleasantly to himself as he began to pull off the worn
  shoes of Buck's horse.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

  <p class="first">Young Andrew Lanning lived in the small, hushed world of his
  own thoughts. He neither loved nor hated the people around him. He simply did
  not see them. His mother&mdash;it was from her that he inherited the softer
  qualities of his mind and his face&mdash;had left him a little stock of
  books. And though Andy was by no means a reader, he had at least picked up
  that dangerous equipment of fiction which enables a man to dodge reality and
  live in his dreams. Those dreams had as little as possible to do with the
  daily routine of his life, and certainly the handling of guns, which his
  uncle enforced upon him, was never a part of the future as Andy saw it.</p>

  <p>It was now the late afternoon; the alkali dust in the road was still in a
  white light, but the temperature in the shop had dropped several degrees. The
  horse of Buck Heath was shod, and Andy was laying his tools away for the day
  when he heard the noise of an automobile with open muffler coming down the
  street. He stepped to the door to watch, and at that moment a big blue car
  trundled into view around the bend of the road. The rear wheels struck a
  slide of sand and dust, and skidded; a girl cried out; then the big machine
  gathered out of the cloud of dust, and came toward Andy with a crackling like
  musketry, and it was plain that it would leap through Martindale and away
  into the country beyond at a bound. Andy could see now that it was a
  roadster, low-hung, ponderous, to keep the road.</p>

  <p>Pat Gregg was leaving the saloon; he was on his horse, but he sat the
  saddle slanting, and his head was turned to give the farewell word to several
  figures who bulged through the door of the saloon. For that reason, as well
  as because of the fumes in his brain, he did not hear the coming of the
  automobile. His friends from the saloon yelled a warning, but he evidently
  thought it some jest, as he waved his hand with a grin of appreciation. The
  big car was coming, rocking with its speed; it was too late now to stop that
  flying mass of metal.</p>

  <p>But the driver made the effort. His brakes shrieked, and still the car
  shot on with scarcely abated speed, for the wheels could secure no purchase
  in the thin sand of the roadway. Andy's heart stood still in sympathy as he
  saw the face of the driver whiten and grow tense. Charles Merchant, the son
  of rich John Merchant, was behind the wheel. Drunken Pat Gregg had taken the
  warning at last. He turned in the saddle and drove home his spurs, but even
  that had been too late had not Charles Merchant taken the big chance. At the
  risk of overturning the machine he veered it sharply to the left. It hung for
  a moment on two wheels. Andy could count a dozen heartbeats while the
  plunging car edged around the horse and shoved between Pat and the wall of
  the house&mdash; inches on either side. Yet it must have taken not more than
  the split part of a second.</p>

  <p>There was a shout of applause from the saloon; Pat Gregg sat his horse,
  mouth open, his face pale, and then the heavy car rolled past the blacksmith
  shop. Andy, breathing freely and cold to his finger tips, saw young Charlie
  Merchant relax to a flickering smile as the girl beside him caught his arm
  and spoke to him.</p>

  <p>And then Andy saw her for the first time.</p>

  <p>In the brief instant as the machine moved by, he printed the picture to be
  seen again when she was gone. What was the hair? Red bronze, and fiery where
  the sun caught at it, and the eyes were gray, or blue, or a gray-green. But
  colors did not matter. It was all in her smile and the turning of her eyes,
  which were very wide open. She spoke, and it was in the sound of her voice.
  "Wait!" shouted Andy Lanning as he made a step toward them. But the car went
  on, rocking over the bumps and the exhaust roaring. Andy became aware that
  his shout had been only a dry whisper. Besides, what would he say if they did
  stop?</p>

  <p>And then the girl turned sharply about and looked back, not at the horse
  they had so nearly struck, but at Andy standing in the door of his shop. He
  felt sure that she would remember his face; her smile had gone out while she
  stared, and now she turned her head suddenly to the front. Once more the sun
  flashed on her hair; then the machine disappeared. In a moment even the roar
  of the engine was lost, but it came back again, flung in echoes from some
  hillside.</p>

  <p>Not until all was silent, and the boys from the saloon were shaking hands
  with Pat and laughing at him, did Andy turn back into the blacksmith shop. He
  sat down on the anvil with his heart beating, and began to recall the
  picture. Yes, it was all in the smile and the glint of the eyes. And
  something else &mdash;how should he say it?&mdash;of the light shining
  through her.</p>

  <p>He stood up presently, closed the shop, and went home. Afterward his uncle
  came in a fierce humor, slamming the door. He found Andy sitting in front of
  the table staring down at his hands.</p>

  <p>"Buck Heath has been talkin' about you," said Jasper.</p>

  <p>Andy raised his head. "Look at 'em!" he said as he spread out his hands.
  "I been scrubbin' 'em with sand soap for half an hour, and the oil and the
  iron dust won't come out."</p>

  <p>Uncle Jasper, who had a quiet voice and gentle manners, now stood rigid.
  "I wisht to God that some iron dust would work its way into your soul," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Nothin' you could understand; you need a mother to explain things to
  you."</p>

  <p>The other got up, white about the mouth. "I think I do," said Andy. "I'm
  sick inside."</p>

  <p>"Where's supper?" demanded Jasper.</p>

  <p>Andy sat down again, and began to consider his hands once more. "There's
  something wrong&mdash;something dirty about this life."</p>

  <p>"Is there?" Uncle Jasper leaned across the table, and once again the old
  ghost of a hope was flickering behind his eyes. "Who's been talkin' to
  you?"</p>

  <p>He thought of the grinning men of the saloon; the hidden words. Somebody
  might have gone out and insulted Andy to his face for the first time. There
  had been plenty of insults in the past two years, since Andy could pretend to
  manhood, but none that might not be overlooked. "Who's been talkin' to you?"
  repeated Uncle Jasper. "Confound that Buck Heath! He's the cause of all the
  trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Buck Heath! Who's he? Oh, I remember. What's he got to do with the rotten
  life we lead here, Uncle Jas?"</p>

  <p>"So?" said the old man slowly. "He ain't nothin'?"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" remarked Andy. "You want me to go out and fight him? I won't. I got
  no love for fighting. Makes me sort of sickish."</p>

  <p>"Heaven above!" the older man invoked. "Ain't you got shame? My blood in
  you, too!"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like that," said Andy with a certain amount of reserve which
  was not natural to him. "You bother me. I want a little silence and a chance
  to think things out. There's something wrong in the way I've been
  living."</p>

  <p>"You're the last to find it out."</p>

  <p>"If you keep this up I'm going to take a walk so I can have quiet."</p>

  <p>"You'll sit there, son, till I'm through with you. Now, Andrew, these
  years I've been savin' up for this moment when I was sure that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>To his unutterable astonishment Andy rose and stepped between him and the
  door. "Uncle Jas," he said, "mostly I got a lot of respect for you and what
  you think. Tonight I don't care what you or anybody else has to say. Just one
  thing matters. I feel I've been living in the dirt. I'm going out and see
  what's wrong. Good night."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

  <p class="first">Uncle Jas was completely bowled over. Over against the wall
  as the door closed he was saying to himself: "What's happened? What's
  happened?" As far as he could make out his nephew retained very little fear
  of the authority of Jasper Lanning.</p>

  <p>One thing became clear to the old man. There had to be a decision between
  his nephew and some full-grown man, otherwise Andy was very apt to grow up
  into a sneaking coward. And in the matter of a contest Jasper could not
  imagine a better trial horse than Buck Heath. For Buck was known to be
  violent with his hands, but he was not likely to draw his gun, and, more than
  this, he might even be bluffed down without making a show of a fight. Uncle
  Jasper left his house supperless, and struck down the street until he came to
  the saloon.</p>

  <p>He found Buck Heath warming to his work, resting both elbows on the bar.
  Bill Dozier was with him, Bill who was the black sheep in the fine old Dozier
  family. His brother, Hal Dozier, was by many odds the most respected and the
  most feared man in the region, but of all the good Dozier qualities Bill
  inherited only their fighting capacity. He fought; he loved trouble; and for
  that reason, and not because he needed the money, he was now acting as a
  deputy sheriff. He was jesting with Buck Heath in a rather superior manner,
  half contemptuous, half amused by Buck's alcoholic swaggerings. And Buck was
  just sober enough to perceive that he was being held lightly. He hated Dozier
  for that treatment, but he feared him too much to take open offense. It was
  at this opportune moment that old man Lanning, apparently half out of breath,
  touched Buck on the elbow.</p>

  <p>As Buck turned with a surly "What the darnation?" the other whispered: "Be
  on your way, Buck. Get out of town, and get out of trouble. My boy hears you
  been talkin' about him, and he allows as how he'll get you. He's out for you
  now."</p>

  <p>The fumes cleared sufficiently from Buck Heath's mind to allow him to
  remember that Jasper Lanning's boy was no other than the milk-blooded Andy.
  He told Jasper to lead his boy on. There was a reception committee waiting
  for him there in the person of one Buck Heath.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Buck," said Jasper, glancing over his shoulder. "Don't
  you know that Andy's a crazy, man-killin' fool when he gets started? And he's
  out for blood now. You just slide out of town and come back when his blood's
  cooled down."</p>

  <p>Buck Heath took another drink from the bottle in his pocket, and then
  regarded Jasper moodily. "Partner," he declared gloomily, putting his hand on
  the shoulder of Jasper, "maybe Andy's a man-eater, but I'm a regular Andy-
  eater, and here's the place where I go and get my feed. Lemme loose!"</p>

  <p>He kicked open the door of the saloon. "Where is he?" demanded the roaring
  Andy-eater. Less savagely, he went on: "I'm lookin' for my meat!"</p>

  <p>Jasper Lanning and Bill Dozier exchanged glances of understanding. "Partly
  drunk, but mostly yaller," observed Bill Dozier. "Soon as the air cools him
  off outside he'll mount his hoss and get on his way. But, say, is your boy
  really out for his scalp?" "Looks that way," declared Jasper with tolerable
  gravity.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know he was that kind," said Bill Dozier. And Jasper flushed,
  for the imputation was clear. They went together to the window and looked
  out.</p>

  <p>It appeared that Bill Dozier was right. After standing in the middle of
  the street in the twilight for a moment, Buck Heath turned and went straight
  for his horse. A low murmur passed around the saloon, for other men were at
  the windows watching. They had heard Buck's talk earlier in the day, and they
  growled as they saw him turn tail.</p>

  <p>Two moments more and Buck would have been on his horse, but in those two
  moments luck took a hand. Around the corner came Andrew Lanning with his head
  bowed in thought. At once a roar went up from every throat in the saloon:
  "There's your man. Go to him!"</p>

  <p>Buck Heath turned from his horse; Andrew lifted his head. They were face
  to face, and it was hard to tell to which one of them the other was the least
  welcome. But Andrew spoke first. A thick silence had fallen in the saloon.
  Most of the onlookers wore careless smiles, for the caliber of these two was
  known, and no one expected violence; but Jasper Lanning, at the door, stood
  with a sick face. He was praying in the silence.</p>

  <p>Every one could hear Andrew say: "I hear you've been making a talk about
  me, Buck?"</p>

  <p>It was a fair enough opening. The blood ran more freely in the veins of
  Jasper. Perhaps the quiet of his boy had not been altogether the quiet of
  cowardice.</p>

  <p>"Aw," answered Buck Heath, "don't you be takin' everything you hear for
  gospel. What kind of talk do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"He's layin' down," said Bill Dozier, and his voice was soft but audible
  in the saloon. "The skunk!"</p>

  <p>"I was about to say," said Andrew, "that I think you had no cause for
  talk. I've done you no harm, Buck."</p>

  <p>The hush in the saloon became thicker; eyes of pity turned on that proved
  man, Jasper Lanning. He had bowed his head. And the words of the younger man
  had an instant effect on Buck Heath. They seemed to infuriate him.</p>

  <p>"You've done me no harm?" he echoed. He let his voice out; he even glanced
  back and took pleasurable note of the crowded faces behind the dim windows of
  the saloon. Just then Geary, the saloon keeper, lighted one of the big lamps,
  and at once all the faces at the windows became black silhouettes. "You done
  me no harm?" repeated Buck Heath. "Ain't you been goin' about makin' a talk
  that you was after me? Well, son, here I am. Now let's see you eat!"</p>

  <p>"I've said nothing about you," declared Andy. There was a groan from the
  saloon. Once more all eyes flashed across to Jasper Lanning.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" snorted Buck Heath, and raised his hand. To crown the horror, the
  other stepped back. A little puff of alkali dust attested the movement.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," roared Buck, "you ain't fittin' for a man's hand to
  touch, you ain't. A hosswhip is more your style."</p>

  <p>From the pommel of his saddle he snatched his quirt. It whirled, hummed in
  the air, and then cracked on the shoulders of Andrew. In the dimness of the
  saloon door a gun flashed in the hand of Jasper Lanning. It was a swift draw,
  but he was not in time to shoot, for Andy, with a cry, ducked in under the
  whip as it raised for the second blow and grappled with Buck Heath. They
  swayed, then separated as though they had been torn apart. But the instant of
  contact had told Andy a hundred things. He was much smaller than the other,
  but he knew that he was far and away stronger after that grapple. It cleared
  his brain, and his nerves ceased jumping.</p>

  <p>"Keep off," he said. "I've no wish to harm you."</p>

  <p>"You houn' dog!" yelled Buck, and leaped in with a driving fist.</p>

  <p>It bounced off the shoulder of Andrew. At the same time he saw those
  banked heads at the windows of the saloon, and knew it was a trap for him.
  All the scorn and the grief which had been piling up in him, all the cold
  hurt went into the effort as he stepped in and snapped his fist into the face
  of Buck Heath. He rose with the blow; all his energy, from wrist to instep,
  was in that lifting drive. Then there was a jarring impact that made his arm
  numb to the shoulder. Buck Heath looked blankly at him, wavered, and pitched
  loosely forward on his face. And his head bounced back as it struck the
  ground. It was a horrible thing to see, but it brought one wild yell of joy
  from the saloon &mdash;the voice of Jasper Lanning.</p>

  <p>Andrew had dropped to his knees and turned the body upon its back. The
  stone had been half buried in the dust, but it had cut a deep, ragged gash on
  the forehead of Buck. His eyes were open, glazed; his mouth sagged; and as
  the first panic seized Andy he fumbled at the heart of the senseless man and
  felt no beat.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" exclaimed Andy, starting to his feet. Men were running toward him
  from the saloon, and their eagerness made him see a picture he had once seen
  before. A man standing in the middle of a courtroom; the place crowded; the
  judge speaking from behind the desk: "&mdash;to be hanged by the neck until
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>A revolver came into the hand of Andrew. And when he found his voice,
  there was a snapping tension in it.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he called. The scattering line stopped like horses thrown back on
  their haunches by jerked bridle reins. "And don't make no move," continued
  Andy, gathering the reins of Buck's horse behind him. A blanket of silence
  had dropped on the street.</p>

  <p>"The first gent that shows metal," said Andy, "I'll drill him. Keep
  steady!"</p>

  <p>He turned and flashed into the saddle. Once more his gun covered them. He
  found his mind working swiftly, calmly. His knees pressed the long holster of
  an old-fashioned rifle. He knew that make of gun from toe to foresight; he
  could assemble it in the dark.</p>

  <p>"You, Perkins! Get your hands away from your hip. Higher, blast you!"</p>

  <p>He was obeyed. His voice was thin, but it kept that line of hands high
  above their heads. When he moved his gun the whole line winced; it was as if
  his will were communicated to them on electric currents. He sent his horse
  into a walk; into a trot; then dropped along the saddle, and was plunging at
  full speed down the street, leaving a trail of sharp alkali dust behind him
  and a long, tingling yell.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

  <p class="first">Only one man in the crowd was old enough to recognize that
  yell, and the one man was Jasper Lanning. A great, singing happiness filled
  his heart and his throat. But the shouting of the men as they tumbled into
  their saddles cleared his brain. He called to Deputy Bill Dozier, who was
  kneeling beside the prostrate form of Buck Heath: "Call 'em off, Bill. Call
  'em off, or, by the Lord, I'll take a hand in this! He done it in
  self-defense. He didn't even pull a gun on Buck. Bill, call 'em off!"</p>

  <p>And Bill did it most effectually. He straightened, and then got up. "Some
  of you fools get some sense, will you?" he called. "Buck ain't dead; he's
  just knocked out!"</p>

  <p>It brought them back, a shamefaced crew, laughing at each other. "Where's
  a doctor?" demanded Bill Dozier.</p>

  <p>Someone who had an inkling of how wounds should be cared for was instantly
  at work over Buck. "He's not dead," pronounced this authority, "but he's
  danged close to it. Fractured skull, that's what he's got. And a fractured
  jaw, too, looks to me. Yep, you can hear the bone grate!"</p>

  <p>Jasper Lanning was in the midst of a joyous monologue. "You seen it, boys?
  One punch done it. That's what the Lannings are&mdash;the one-punch kind. And
  you seen him get to his gun? Handy! Lord, but it done me good to see him
  mosey that piece of iron off'n his hip. And see him take that saddle? Where
  was you with your gal, Joe? Nowhere! Looked to me like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The voice of Bill Dozier broke in: "I want a posse. Who'll ride with Bill
  Dozier tonight?"</p>

  <p>It sobered Jasper Lanning. "What d'you mean by that?" he asked. "Didn't
  the boy fight clean?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," admitted Dozier. "But Buck may kick out. And if he dies they's
  got to be a judge talk to your boy. Come on. I want volunteers."</p>

  <p>"Dozier, what's all this fool talk?"</p>

  <p>"Don't bother me, Lanning. I got a duty to perform, ain't I? Think I'm
  going to let 'em say later on that anybody done this and then got away from
  Bill Dozier? Not me!"</p>

  <p>"Bill," said Jasper, "I read in your mind. You're lookin' for action, and
  you want to get it out of Andy."</p>

  <p>"I want nothin' but to get him back."</p>

  <p>"Think he'll let you come close enough to talk? He'll think you want him
  for murder, that's what. Keep off of this boy, Bill. Let him hear the news;
  then he'll come back well enough."</p>

  <p>"You waste my time," said Bill, "and all the while a man that the law
  wants is puttin' ground between him and Martindale. Now, boys, you hear me
  talk. Who's with Bill Dozier to bring back this milk-fed kid?"</p>

  <p>It brought a snarl from Jasper Lanning. "Why don't you go after him by
  yourself, Dozier? I had your job once and I didn't ask no helpers on it."</p>

  <p>But Bill Dozier apparently had no liking for a lonely ride. He made his
  demand once more, and the volunteers came out. In five minutes he had
  selected five sturdy men, and every one of the five was a man whose name was
  known.</p>

  <p>They went down the street of Martindale without shouting and at a steady
  lope which their horses could keep up indefinitely. Old Jasper followed them
  to the end of the village and kept on watching through the dusk until the six
  horsemen loomed on the hill beyond against the sky line. They were still
  cantering, and they rode close together like a tireless pack of wolves. After
  this old Jasper went back to his house, and when the door closed behind him a
  lonely echo went through the place.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Jasper. "I'm getting soft!"</p>

  <p>In the meantime the posse went on, regardless of direction. There were
  only two possible paths for a horseman out of Martindale; east and west the
  mountains blocked the way, and young Lanning had started north. Straight
  ahead of them the mountains shot up on either side of Grant's Pass, and
  toward this natural landmark Bill Dozier led the way. Not that he expected to
  have to travel as far as this. He felt fairly certain that the fugitive would
  ride out his horse at full speed, and then he would camp for the night and
  make a fire.</p>

  <p>Andrew Lanning was town bred and soft of skin from the work at the forge.
  When the biting night air got through his clothes he would need warmth from a
  fire.</p>

  <p>Bill Dozier led on his men for three hours at a steady pace until they
  came to Sullivan's ranch house in the valley. The place was dark, but the
  deputy threw a loose circle of his men around the house, and then knocked at
  the front door. Old man Sullivan answered in his bare feet. Did he know of
  the passing of young Lanning? Not only that, but he had sold Andrew a horse.
  It seemed that Andrew was making a hurried trip; that Buck Heath had loaned
  him his horse for the first leg of it, and that Buck would call later for the
  animal. It had sounded strange, but Sullivan was not there to ask questions.
  He had led Andrew to the corral and told him to make his choice.</p>

  <p>"There was an old pinto in there," said Sullivan, "all leather in that
  hoss. You know him, Joe. Well, the boy runs his eye over the bunch, and then
  picks the pinto right off. I said he wasn't for sale, but he wouldn't take
  anything else. I figured a stiff price, and then added a hundred to it.
  Lanning didn't wink. He took the horse, but he didn't pay cash. Told me I'd
  have to trust him."</p>

  <p>Bill Dozier bade Sullivan farewell, gathered his five before the house,
  and made them a speech. Bill had a long, lean face, a misty eye, and a pair
  of drooping, sad mustaches. As Jasper Lanning once said: "Bill Dozier always
  looked like he was just away from a funeral or just goin' to one." This night
  the dull eye of Bill was alight.</p>

  <p>"Gents," he said, "maybe you-all is disappointed. I heard some talk comin'
  up here that maybe the boy had laid over for the night in Sullivan's house.
  Which he may be a fool, but he sure ain't a plumb fool. But, speakin'
  personal, this trail looks more and more interestin' to me. Here he's left
  Buck's hoss, so he ain't exactly a hoss thief&mdash;yet. And he's promised to
  pay for the pinto, so that don't make him a crook. But when the pinto gives
  out, Andy'll be in country where he mostly ain't known. He can't take things
  on trust, and he'll mostly take 'em, anyway. Boys, looks to me like we was
  after the real article. Anybody weakenin'?"</p>

  <p>It was suggested that the boy would be overtaken before the pinto gave
  out; it was even suggested that this waiting for Andrew Lanning to commit a
  crime was perilously like forcing him to become a criminal. To all of this
  the deputy listened sadly, combing his mustaches. The hunger for the manhunt
  is like the hunger for food, and Bill Dozier had been starved for many a
  day.</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Bill to the last speaker, "ain't we makin' all the speed
  we can? Ain't it what I want to come up to the fool kid and grab him before
  he makes a hoss thief or somethin' out of himself? You gents feed your hosses
  the spur and leave the thinkin' to me. I got a pile of hunches."</p>

  <p>There was no questioning of such a known man as Bill Dozier. The six went
  rattling up the valley at a smart pace. Yet Andy's change of horses at
  Sullivan's place changed the entire problem. He had ridden his first mount to
  a stagger at full speed, and it was to be expected that, having built up a
  comfortable lead, he would settle his second horse to a steady pace and
  maintain it.</p>

  <p>All night the six went on, with Bill Dozier's long-striding chestnut
  setting the pace. He made no effort toward a spurt now. Andrew Lanning led
  them by a full hour's riding on a comparatively fresh horse, and, unless he
  were foolish enough to indulge in another wild spurt, they could not wear him
  down in this first stage of the journey. There was only the chance that he
  would build a fire recklessly near to the trail, but still they came to no
  sign of light, and then the dawn broke and Bill Dozier found unmistakable
  signs of a trotting horse which went straight up the valley. There were no
  other fresh tracks pointing in the same direction, and this must be Andy's
  horse. And the fact that he was trotting told many things. He was certainly
  saving his mount for a long grind. Bill Dozier looked about at his men in the
  gray morning. They were a hard-faced lot; he had not picked them for
  tenderness. They were weary now, but the fugitive must be still wearier, for
  he had fear to keep him company and burden his shoulders.</p>

  <p>And now they came to a surprising break in the trail. It twisted from the
  floor of the valley up a steep slope, crossed the low crest of the hills, and
  finally came out above a broad and open valley.</p>

  <p>"What does he mean," said Bill Dozier aloud, "by breakin' for Jack
  Merchant's house?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

  <p class="first">The yell with which Andrew Lanning had shot out of
  Martindale, and which only Jasper Lanning had recognized, was no more
  startling to the men of the village than it was to Andrew himself. Mingled in
  an ecstasy of emotion, there was fear, hate, anger, grief, and the joy of
  freedom in that cry; but it froze the marrow of Andy's bones to hear it.</p>

  <p>Fear, most of all, was driving him out of the village. Just as he rushed
  around the bend of the street he looked back to the crowd of men tumbling
  upon their horses; every hand there would be against him. He knew them. He
  ran over their names and faces. Thirty seconds before he would rather have
  walked on the edge of a cliff than rouse the anger of a single one among
  these men, and now, by one blow, he had started them all after him.</p>

  <p>Once, as he topped the rise, the folly of attempting to escape from their
  long-proved cunning made him draw in on the rein a little; but the horse only
  snorted and shook his head and burst into a greater effort of speed. After
  all, the horse was right, Andy decided. For the moment he thought of turning
  and facing that crowd, but he remembered stories about men who had killed the
  enemy in fair fight, but who had been tried by a mob jury and strung to the
  nearest tree.</p>

  <p>Any sane man might have told Andrew that those days were some distance in
  the past, but Andy made no distinction between periods. He knew the most
  exciting events which had happened around Martindale in the past fifty years,
  and he saw no difference between one generation and the next. Was not Uncle
  Jasper himself continually dinning into his ears the terrible possibilities
  of trouble? Was not Uncle Jasper, even in his old age, religiously exacting
  in his hour or more of gun exercise each day? Did not Uncle Jasper force Andy
  to go through the same maneuvers for twice as long between sunset and
  sunrise? And why all these endless preparations if these men of Martindale
  were not killers?</p>

  <p>It might seem strange that Andy could have lived so long among these
  people without knowing them better, but he had taken from his mother a little
  strain of shyness. He never opened his mind to other people, and they really
  never opened themselves to Andy Lanning. The men of Martindale wore guns, and
  the conclusion had always been apparent to Andy that they wore guns because,
  in a pinch, they were ready to kill men.</p>

  <p>To Andy Lanning, as fear whipped him north out of Martindale, there seemed
  no pleasure or safety in the world except in the speed of his horse and the
  whir of the air against his face. When that speed faltered he went to the
  quirt. He spurred mercilessly. Yet he had ridden his horse out to a stagger
  before he reached old Sullivan's place. Only when the forefeet of the mustang
  began to pound did he realize his folly in exhausting his horse when the race
  was hardly begun. He went into the ranch house to get a new mount.</p>

  <p>When he was calmer, he realized that he had played his part well&mdash;
  astonishingly well. His voice had not quivered. His eye had met that of the
  old rancher every moment. His hand had been as steady as iron.</p>

  <p>Something that Uncle Jasper had said recurred to him, something about iron
  dust. He felt now that there was indeed a strong, hard metal in him; fear had
  put it there&mdash;or was it fear itself? Was it not fear that had brought
  the gun into his hand so easily when the crowd rushed him from the door of
  the saloon? Was it not fear that had made his nerves so rocklike as he faced
  that crowd and made his get-away?</p>

  <p>He was on one side now, and the world was on the other. He turned in the
  saddle and probed the thick blackness with his eyes; then he sent the pinto
  on at an easy, ground-devouring lope. Sometimes, as the ravine narrowed, the
  close walls made the creaking of the saddle leather loud in his ears, and the
  puffing of the pinto, who hated work; sometimes the hoofs scuffed noisily
  through gravel; but usually the soft sand muffled the noise of hoofs, and
  there was a silence as dense as the night around Andy Lanning.</p>

  <p>Thinking back, he felt that it was all absurd and dreamlike. He had never
  hurt a man before in his life. Martindale knew it. Why could he not go back,
  face them, give up his gun, wait for the law to speak?</p>

  <p>But when he thought of this he thought a moment later of a crowd rushing
  their horses through the night, leaning over their saddles to break the wind
  more easily, and all ready to kill on this man trail.</p>

  <p>All at once a great hate welled up in him, and he went on with gritting
  teeth.</p>

  <p>It was out of this anger, oddly enough, that the memory of the girl came
  to him. She was like the falling of this starlight, pure, aloof, and strange
  and gentle. It seemed to Andrew Lanning that the instant of seeing her
  outweighed the rest of his life, but he would never see her again. How could
  he see her, and if he saw her, what would he say to her? It would not be
  necessary to speak. One glance would be enough.</p>

  <p>But, sooner or later, Bill Dozier would reach him. Why not sooner? Why not
  take the chance, ride to John Merchant's ranch, break a way to the room where
  the girl slept this night, smash open the door, look at her once, and then
  fight his way out?</p>

  <p>He swung out of the ravine and headed across the hills. From the crest the
  valley was broad and dark below him, and on the opposite side the hills were
  blacker still. He let the pinto go down the steep slope at a walk, for there
  is nothing like a fast pace downhill to tear the heart out of a horse.
  Besides, it came to him after he started, were not the men of Bill Dozier apt
  to miss this sudden swinging of the trail?</p>

  <p>In the floor of the valley he sent the pinto again into the stretching
  canter, found the road, and went on with a thin cloud of the alkali dust
  about him until the house rose suddenly out of the ground, a black mass whose
  gables seemed to look at him like so many heads above the tree- tops.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

  <p class="first">The house would have been more in place on the main street
  of a town than here in the mountain desert; but when the first John Merchant
  had made his stake and could build his home as it pleased him to build, his
  imagination harked back to a mid-Victorian model, built of wood, with high,
  pointed roofs, many carved balconies and windows, and several towers. Here
  the second John Merchant lived with his son Charles, whose taste had quite
  outgrown the house.</p>

  <p>But to the uneducated eye of Andrew Lanning it was a great and dignified
  building. He reined the pinto under the trees to look up at that tall, black
  mass. It was doubly dark against the sky, for now the first streaks of gray
  light were pale along the eastern horizon, and the house seemed to tower up
  into the center of the heavens. Andy sighed at the thought of stealing
  through the great halls within. Even if he could find an open window, or if
  the door were unlatched, how could he find the girl?</p>

  <p>Another thing troubled him. He kept canting his ear with eternal
  expectation of hearing the chorus of many hoofs swinging toward him out of
  the darkness. After all, it was not a simple thing to put Bill Dozier off the
  trail. When a horse neighed in one of the corrals, Andy started violently and
  laid his fingertips on his revolver butt.</p>

  <p>That false alarm determined him to make his attempt without further waste
  of time. He swung from the stirrups and went lightly up the front steps. His
  footfall was a feathery thing that carried him like a shadow to the door. It
  yielded at once under his hand, and, stepping through, he found himself lost
  in utter blackness.</p>

  <p>He closed the door, taking care that the spring did not make the lock
  click, and then stood perfectly motionless, listening, probing the dark.</p>

  <p>After a time the shadows gave way before his eyes, and he could make out
  that he was in a hall with lofty ceiling. Something wound down from above at
  a little distance, and he made out that this was the stairway. Obviously the
  bedrooms would be in the second story.</p>

  <p>Andy began the ascent.</p>

  <p>He had occasion to bless the thick carpet before he was at the head of the
  stairs; he could have run up if he had wished, and never have made a sound.
  At the edge of the second hall he paused again. The sense of people
  surrounded him. Then directly behind him a man cleared his throat. As though
  a great hand had seized his shoulder and wrenched him down, Andy whirled and
  dropped to his knees, the revolver in his hand pointing uneasily here and
  there like the head of a snake laboring to find its enemy.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing in the hall. The voice became a murmur, and then
  Andy knew that it had been some man speaking in his sleep.</p>

  <p>At least that room was not the room of the girl. Or was she, perhaps,
  married? Weak and sick, Andy rested his hand against the wall and waited for
  his brain to clear. "She won't be married," he whispered to himself in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>But of all those doors up and down the hall, which would be hers? There
  was no reasoning which could help him in the midst of that puzzle. He walked
  to what he judged to be the middle of the hall, turned to his right, and
  opened the first door. A hinge creaked, but it was no louder than the rustle
  of silk against silk.</p>

  <p>There were two windows in that room, and each was gray with the dawn, but
  in the room itself the blackness was unrelieved. There was the one dim
  stretch of white, which was the covering of the bed; the furniture, the
  chairs, and the table were half merged with the shadows around them. Andy
  slipped across the floor, evaded a chair by instinct rather than by sight,
  and leaned over the bed. It was a man, as he could tell by the heavy
  breathing; yet he leaned closer in a vain effort to make surer by the use of
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then something changed in the face of the man in the bed. It was an
  indescribable change, but Andrew knew that the man had opened his eyes.
  Before he could straighten or stir, hands were thrown up. One struck at his
  face, and the fingers were stiff; one arm was cast over his shoulders, and
  Andy heard the intake of breath which precedes a shriek. Not a long
  interval&mdash;no more, say, than the space required for the lash of a
  snapping blacksnake to flick back on itself&mdash;but in that interim the
  hands of Andy were buried in the throat of his victim.</p>

  <p>His fingers, accustomed to the sway and quiver of eight-pound hammers and
  fourteen-pound sledges, sank through the flesh and found the windpipe. And
  the hands of the other grappled at his wrists, smashed into his face. Andy
  could have laughed at the effort. He jammed the shin of his right leg just
  above the knees of the other, and at once the writhing body was quiet. With
  all of his blood turned to ice, Andy found, what he had discovered when he
  faced the crowd in Martindale, that his nerves did not jump and that his
  heart, instead of trembling, merely beat with greater pulses. Fear cleared
  his brain; it sent a tremendous nervous power thrilling in his wrists and
  elbows. All the while he was watching mercilessly for the cessation of the
  struggles. And when the wrenching at his forearms ceased he instantly relaxed
  his grip.</p>

  <p>For a time there was a harsh sound filling the room, the rough intake of
  the man's breath; he was for the time being paralyzed and incapable of any
  effort except the effort to fill his lungs. By the glint of the metal work
  about the bits Andy made out two bridles hanging on the wall near the bed.
  Taking them down, he worked swiftly. As soon as the fellow on the bed would
  have his breath he would scream. Yet the time sufficed Andy; he had his knife
  out, flicked the blade open, and cut off the long reins of the bridles. Then
  he went back to the bed and shoved the cold muzzle of his revolver into the
  throat of the other.</p>

  <p>There was a tremor through the whole body of the man, and Andy knew that
  at that moment the senses of his victim had cleared.</p>

  <p>He leaned close to the ear of the man and whispered: "Don't make no loud
  talk, partner. Keep cool and steady. I don't aim to hurt you unless you play
  the fool."</p>

  <p>Instantly the man answered in a similar whisper, though it was broken with
  panting: "Get that coat of mine out the closet. There&mdash;the door is open.
  You'll find my wallet in the inside pocket and about all you can want will be
  in it."</p>

  <p>"That's the way," reassured Andy. "Keep your head and use sense. But it
  isn't the coin I want. You've got a red-headed girl in this house. Where's
  her room?"</p>

  <p>His hand which held the revolver was resting on the breast of the man, and
  he felt the heart of the other leap. Then there was a current of curses, a
  swift hissing of invective. And suddenly it came over Andy that since he had
  killed one man, as he thought, the penalty would be no greater if he killed
  ten. All at once the life of this prostrate fellow on the bed was nothing to
  him.</p>

  <p>When he cut into that profanity he meant what he said. "Partner, I've got
  a pull on this trigger. There's a slug in this gun just trembling to get at
  you. And I tell you honest, friend, I'd as soon drill you as turn around. Now
  tell me where that girl's room is?"</p>

  <p>"Anne Withero?" Only his breathing was heard for a moment. Then: "Two
  doors down, on this side of the hall. If you lay a hand on her I'll live to
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Partner, so help me heaven, I wouldn't touch a lock of her hair. Now lie
  easy while I make sure of you."</p>

  <p>And he promptly trussed the other in the bridle reins. Out of a pillowcase
  folded hard he made a gag and tied it into the mouth of the man. Then he ran
  his hands over the straps; they were drawn taut.</p>

  <p>"If you make any noise," he warned the other, "I'll come back to find out
  why. S'long."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

  <p class="first">Every moment was bringing on the dawn more swiftly, and the
  eyes of Andy were growing more accustomed to the gloom in the house. He found
  the door of the girl's room at once. When he entered he had only to pause a
  moment before he had all the details clearly in mind. Other senses than that
  of sight informed him in her room. There was in the gray gloom a touch of
  fragrance such as blows out of gardens across a road; yet here the air was
  perfectly quiet and chill. The dawn advanced. But all that he could make out
  was a faint touch of color againt the pillow&mdash;and that would be her
  hair. Then with astonishing clearness he saw her hand resting against her
  breast. Andy stood for a moment with his eyes closed, a great tenderness
  falling around him. The hush kept deepening, and the sense of the girl drew
  out to him as if a light were brightening about her.</p>

  <p>He stepped back to the table against the wall, took the chimney from the
  lamp, and flicked a match along his trousers, for in that way a match would
  make the least noise. Yet to the hair-trigger nerves of Andy the spurt and
  flare of the match was like the explosion of a gun. He lighted the lamp,
  turned down the wick, and replaced the chimney. Then he turned as though
  someone had shouted behind him. He whirled as he had whirled in the hall,
  crouching, and he found himself looking straight into the eyes of the girl as
  she sat up in bed.</p>

  <p>Truly he did not see her face at first, but only the fear in it, parting
  her lips and widening her eyes. She did not speak; her only movement was to
  drag up the coverlet of the bed and hold it against the base of her
  throat.</p>

  <p>Andy drew off his hat and stepped a little closer. "Do you know me?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>He watched her as she strove to speak, but if her lips stirred they made
  no sound. It tortured him to see her terror, and yet he would not have had
  her change. This crystal pallor or a flushed joy&mdash;in one of the two she
  was most beautiful.</p>

  <p>"You saw me in Martindale," he continued. "I am the blacksmith. Do you
  remember?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, still watching him with those haunted eyes.</p>

  <p>"I saw you for the split part of a second," said Andy, "and you stopped my
  heart. I've come to see you for two minutes; I swear I mean you no harm. Will
  you let me have those two minutes for talk?" Again she nodded. But he could
  see that the terror was being tempered a little in her face. She was
  beginning to think, to wonder. It seemed a natural thing for Andy to go
  forward a pace closer to the bed, but, lest that should alarm her, it seemed
  also natural for him to drop upon one knee. It brought the muzzle of the
  revolver jarringly home against the floor.</p>

  <p>The girl heard that sound of metal and it shook her; but it requires a
  very vivid imagination to fear a man upon his knees. And now that she could
  look directly into his face, she saw that he was only a boy, not more than
  two or three years older than herself. For the first time she remembered the
  sooty figure which had stood in the door of the blacksmith shop. The white
  face against the tawny smoke of the shop; that had attracted her eyes before.
  It was the same white face now, but subtly changed. A force exuded from him;
  indeed, he seemed neither young nor old.</p>

  <p>She heard him speaking in a voice not louder than a whisper, rapid,
  distinct.</p>

  <p>"When you came through the town you waked me up like a whiplash," he was
  saying. "When you left I kept thinking about you. Then along came a trouble.
  I killed a man. A posse started after me. It's on my heels, but I had to see
  you again. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>A ghost of color was going up her throat, staining her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I had to see you," he repeated. "It's my last chance. Tomorrow they may
  get me. Two hours from now they may have me salted away with lead. But before
  I kick out I had to have one more look at you. So I swung out of my road and
  came straight to this house. I came up the stairs. I went into a room down
  the hall and made a man tell me where to find you."</p>

  <p>There was a flash in the eyes of the girl like the wink of sun on a bit of
  quartz on a far-away hillside, but it cut into the speech of Andrew Lanning.
  "He told you where to find me?" she asked in a voice no louder than the
  swift, low voice of Andy. But what a world of scorn!</p>

  <p>"He had a gun shoved into the hollow of his throat," said Andy. "He had to
  tell&mdash;two doors down the hall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was Charlie!" said the girl softly. She seemed to forget her fear. Her
  head raised as she looked at Andy. "The other man&mdash;the one you
  &mdash;why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The man I killed doesn't matter," said Andy. "Nothing matters except that
  I've got this minute here with you."</p>

  <p>"But where will you go? How will you escape?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go to death, I guess," said Andy quietly. "But I'll have a grin for
  Satan when he lets me in. I've beat 'em, even if they catch me."</p>

  <p>The coverlet dropped from her breast; her hand was suspended with stiff
  fingers. There had been a sound as of someone stumbling on the stairway, the
  unmistakable slip of a heel and the recovery; then no more sound. Andy was on
  his feet. She saw his face whiten, and then there was a glitter in his eyes,
  and she knew that the danger was nothing to him. But Anne Withero whipped out
  of her bed.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear?"</p>

  <p>"I tied and gagged him," said Andy, "but he's broken loose, and now he's
  raising the house on the quiet."</p>

  <p>For an instant they stood listening, staring at each other.</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;they're coming up the hall," whispered the girl. "Listen!"</p>

  <p>It was no louder than a whisper from without&mdash;the creak of a board.
  Andrew Lanning slipped to the door and turned the key in the lock. When he
  rejoined her in the middle of the room he gave her the key.</p>

  <p>"Let 'em in if you want to," he said.</p>

  <p>But the girl caught his arm, whispering: "You can get out that window onto
  the top of the roof below, then a drop to the ground. But hurry before they
  think to guard that way!" "Anne!" called a voice suddenly from the hall.</p>

  <p>Andy threw up the window, and, turning toward the door, he laughed his
  defiance and his joy.</p>

  <p>"Hurry!" she was demanding. A great blow fell on the door of her room, and
  at once there was shouting in the hall: "Pete, run outside and watch the
  window!"</p>

  <p>"Will you go?" cried the girl desperately.</p>

  <p>He turned toward the window. He turned back like a flash and swept her
  close to him.</p>

  <p>"Do you fear me?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"No," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Will you remember me?"</p>

  <p>"Forever!"</p>

  <p>"God bless you," said Andy as he leaped through the window. She saw him
  take the slope of the roof with one stride; she heard the thud of his feet on
  the ground below. Then a yell from without, shrill and high and sharp.</p>

  <p>When the door fell with a crash, and three men were flung into the room,
  Charles Merchant saw her standing in her nightgown by the open window. Her
  head was flung back against the wall, her eyes closed, and one hand was
  pressed across her lips.</p>

  <p>"He's out the window. Down around the other way," cried Charles
  Merchant.</p>

  <p>The stampede swept out of the room. Charles was beside her.</p>

  <p>She knew that vaguely, and that he was speaking, but not until he touched
  her shoulder did she hear the words: "Anne, are you unhurt&mdash;has&mdash;
  for heaven's sake speak, Anne. What's happened?"</p>

  <p>She reached up and put his hand away.</p>

  <p>"Charles," she said, "call them back. Don't let them follow him!"</p>

  <p>"Are you mad, dear?" he asked. "That murdering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He found a tigress in front of him. "If they hurt a hair of his head,
  Charlie, I'm through with you. I'll swear that!"</p>

  <p>It stunned Charles Merchant. And then he went stumbling from the room.</p>

  <p>His cow-punchers were out from the bunk house already; the guests and his
  father were saddling or in the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" shouted Charles Merchant. "Don't follow him. Come back! No
  guns. He's done no harm."</p>

  <p>Two men came around the corner of the house, dragging a limp figure
  between them.</p>

  <p>"Is this no harm?" they asked. "Look at Pete, and then talk."</p>

  <p>They lowered the tall, limp figure of the man in pajamas to the ground;
  his face was a crimson smear.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" asked Charles Merchant.</p>

  <p>"No move out of him," they answered.</p>

  <p>Other people, most of them on horseback, were pouring back to learn the
  meaning of the strange call from Charles Merchant.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you what I mean," he was saying in explanation. "But you,
  dad, I'll be able to tell you. All I can say is that he mustn't be followed
  &mdash;unless Pete here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The eyes of Pete opportunely opened. He looked hazily about him.</p>

  <p>"Is he gone?" asked Pete.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Did you see him? What's he like?"</p>

  <p>"About seven feet tall. I saw him jump off the roof of the house. I was
  right under him. Tried to get my gun on him, but he came up like a wild cat
  and went straight at me. Had his fist in my face before I could get my finger
  on the trigger. And then the earth came up and slapped me in the face."
  "There he goes!" cried some one.</p>

  <p>The sky was now of a brightness not far from day, and, turning east, in
  the direction pointed out, Charles Merchant saw a horseman ride over a
  hilltop, a black form against the coloring horizon. He was moving leisurely,
  keeping his horse at the cattle pony's lope. Presently he dipped away out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>John Merchant dropped his hand on the shoulder of his son. "What is it?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows! Not I!"</p>

  <p>"Here are more people! What's this? A night of surprise parties?"</p>

  <p>Six riders came through the trees, rushing their horses, and John Merchant
  saw Bill Dozier's well-known, lanky form in the lead. He brought his horse
  from a dead run to a halt in the space of a single jump and a slide. The next
  moment he was demanding fresh mounts.</p>

  <p>"Can you give 'em to me, Merchant? But what's all this?"</p>

  <p>"You make your little talk," said Merchant, "and then I'll make mine."</p>

  <p>"I'm after Andy Lanning. He's left a gent more dead than alive back in
  Martindale, and I want him. Can you give me fresh horses for me and my boys,
  Merchant?"</p>

  <p>"But the man wasn't dead? He wasn't dead?" cried the voice of a girl. The
  group opened; Bill Dozier found himself facing a bright-haired girl wrapped
  to the throat in a long coat, with slippers on her feet.</p>

  <p>"Not dead and not alive," he answered. "Just betwixt and between."</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" whispered the girl. "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>There was only one man in the group who should not have heard that
  whispered phrase, and that man was Charles Merchant. He was standing at her
  side.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

  <p class="first">It took less than five minutes for the deputy sheriff to
  mount his men; he himself had the pick of the corral, a dusty roan, and, as
  he drew the cinch taut, he turned to find Charles Merchant at his side.</p>

  <p>"Bill," said the young fellow, "what sort of a man is this Lanning?"</p>

  <p>"He's been a covered card, partner," said Bill Dozier. "He's been a
  covered card that seemed pretty good. Now he's in the game, and he looks like
  the rest of the Lannings&mdash;a good lump of daring and defiance. Why d'you
  ask?"</p>

  <p>"Are you keen to get him, Bill?" continued Charlie Merchant eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I could stand it. Again, why?"</p>

  <p>"You'd like a little gun play with that fellow?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't complain none."</p>

  <p>"Ah? One more thing. Could you use a bit of ready cash?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't pressed," said Bill Dozier. "On the other hand, I ain't of a
  savin' nature."</p>

  <p>Then he added: "Get it out, Charlie. I think I follow your drift. And you
  can go as far as you like." He put out his jaw in an ugly way as he said
  it.</p>

  <p>"It would be worth a lot to me to have this cur done for, Bill. You
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"My time's short. Talk terms, Charlie."</p>

  <p>"A thousand."</p>

  <p>"The price of a fair hoss."</p>

  <p>"Two thousand, old man."</p>

  <p>"Hoss and trimmin's."</p>

  <p>"Three thousand." "Charlie, you seem to forget that we're talkin' about a
  man and a gun."</p>

  <p>"Bill, it's worth five thousand to me."</p>

  <p>"That's turkey. Let me have your hand."</p>

  <p>They shook hands.</p>

  <p>"And if you kill the horses," said Charles Merchant, "you won't hurt my
  feelings. But get him!"</p>

  <p>"I've got nothing much on him," said Bill Dozier, "but some fools resist
  arrest."</p>

  <p>He smiled in a manner that made the other shudder. And a moment later the
  deputy led his men out on the trail.</p>

  <p>They were a weary lot by this time, but they had beneath the belt several
  shots of the Merchant whisky which Charles had distributed. And they had that
  still greater stimulus&mdash;fresh horses running smooth and strong beneath
  them. Another thing had changed. They saw their leader, Bill Dozier, working
  at his revolver and his rifle as he rode, looking to the charges, trying the
  pressure of the triggers, getting the balance of the weapons with a peculiar
  anxiety, and they knew, without a word being spoken, that there was small
  chance of that trail ending at anything short of a red mark in the dust.</p>

  <p>It made some of them shrug their shoulders, but here again it was proved
  that Bill Dozier knew the men of Martindale, and had picked his posse well.
  They were the common, hard-working variety of cow-puncher, and presently the
  word went among them from the man riding nearest to Bill that if young
  Lanning were taken it would be worth a hundred dollars to each of them. Two
  months' pay for two days' work. That was fair enough. They also began to look
  to their guns. It was not that a single one of them could have been bought
  for a mankilling at that or any other price, perhaps, but this was simply a
  bonus to carry them along toward what they considered an honest duty.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was a different crew that rode over the hills away from
  the Merchant place. They had begun for the sake of the excitement. Now they
  were working carefully, riding with less abandon, jockeying their horses, for
  each man was laboring to be in on the kill.</p>

  <p>They had against them a good horse and a stanch horseman. Never had the
  pinto dodged his share of honest running, and this day was no exception. He
  gave himself whole-heartedly to his task, and he stretched the legs of the
  ponies behind him. Yet he had a great handicap. He was tough, but the ranch
  horses of John Merchant came out from a night of rest. Their legs were full
  of running. And the pinto, for all his courage, could not meet that handicap
  and beat it.</p>

  <p>That truth slowly sank in upon the mind of the fugitive as he put the game
  little cattle pony into his best stride. He tried the pinto in the level
  going. He tried him in the rough. And in both conditions the posse gained
  slowly and steadily, until it became apparent to Andrew Lanning that the
  deputy held him in the hollow of his hand, and in half an hour of stiff
  galloping could run his quarry into the ground whenever he chose.</p>

  <p>Andy turned in the saddle and grinned back at the followers. He could
  distinguish Bill Dozier most distinctly. The broad brim of Bill's hat was
  blown up stiffly. And the sun glinted now and again on those melancholy
  mustaches of his. Andy was puzzled. Bill had horses which could outrun the
  fugitive, and why did he not use them?</p>

  <p>Almost at once Andy received his answer.</p>

  <p>The deputy sheriff sent his horse into a hard run, and then brought him
  suddenly to a standstill. Looking back, Andy saw a rifle pitch to the
  shoulder of the deputy. It was a flashing line of light which focused
  suddenly in a single, glinting dot. That instant something hummed evilly
  beside the ear of Andy. A moment later the report came barking and echoing in
  his ear with the little metallic ring in it which tells of the shiver of a
  gun barrel.</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of a running fusillade. Technically these were
  shots fired to warn the fugitive that he was wanted by the law, and to tell
  him that if he did not halt he would be shot at to be killed. But the deputy
  did not waste warnings. He began to shoot to kill. And so did the rest of the
  posse. They saw the deputy's plan at once, and then grinned at it. If they
  rode down in a mob the boy would no doubt surrender. But if they goaded him
  in this manner from a distance he would probably attempt to return the fire.
  And if he fired one shot in reply, unwritten law and strong public opinion
  would be on the side of Bill Dozier in killing this criminal without quarter.
  In a word, the whisky and the little promise of money were each taking effect
  on the posse.</p>

  <p>They spurted ahead in pairs, halted, and delivered their fire; then the
  next pair spurted ahead and fired. Every moment or so two bullets winged
  through the air nearer and nearer Andy. It was really a wonder that he was
  not cleanly drilled by a bullet long before that fusillade had continued for
  ten minutes. But it is no easy thing to hit a man on a galloping horse when
  one sits on the back of another horse, and that horse heaving from a hard
  run. Moreover, Andy watched, and when the pairs halted he made the pinto
  weave.</p>

  <p>At the first bullet he felt his heart come into his throat. At the second
  he merely raised his head. At the next he smiled, and thereafter he greeted
  each volley with a yell and with a wave of his hat. It was like dancing, but
  greater fun. The cold, still terror was in his heart every moment, but yet he
  felt like laughing, and when the posse heard him their own hearts went
  cold.</p>

  <p>It disturbed their aim. They began to snarl at each other, and they also
  pressed their horses closer and closer before they even attempted to fire.
  And the result was that Andy, waving his hat, felt it twitch sharply in his
  hand, and then he saw a neat little hole clipped out of the very edge of the
  brim. It was a pretty trick to see, until Andy remembered that the thing
  which had nicked that hole would also cut its way through him, body and bone.
  He leaned over the saddle and spurred the pinto into his racing gait.</p>

  <p>"I nicked him!" yelled the deputy. "Come on, boys! Close in!"</p>

  <p>But within five minutes of racing, Andy drew the pinto to a sudden halt
  and raised his rifle. The posse laughed. They had been shooting for some
  time, and always for a distance even less than Andy's; yet not one of their
  bullets had gone home. So they waved their hats recklessly and continued to
  ride to be in at the death. And every one knew that the end of the trail was
  not far off when the fugitive had once begun to turn at bay.</p>

  <p>Andy knew it as well as the rest, and his hand shook like a nervous
  girl's, while the rifle barrel tilted up and up, the blue barrel shimmering
  wickedly. In a frenzy of eagerness he tried to line up the sights. It was in
  vain. The circle through which he squinted wobbled crazily. He saw two of the
  pursuers spurt ahead, take their posts, raise their rifles for a fire which
  would at least disturb his. For the first time they had a stationary
  target.</p>

  <p>And then, by chance, the circle of Andy's sight embraced the body of a
  horseman. Instantly the left arm, stretching out to support his rifle, became
  a rock; the forefinger of his right hand was as steady as the trigger it
  pressed. It was like shooting at a target. He found himself breathing
  easily.</p>

  <p>It was very strange. Find a man with his sights? He could follow his
  target as though a magnetic power attracted his rifle. The weapon seemed to
  have a volition of its own. It drifted along with the canter of Bill Dozier.
  With incredible precision the little finger of iron inside the circle dwelt
  in turn on the hat of Bill Dozier, on his sandy mustaches, on his fluttering
  shirt. And Andy knew that he had the life of a man under the command of his
  forefinger.</p>

  <p>And why not? He had killed one. Why not a hundred?</p>

  <p>The punishment would be no greater. And to tempt him there was this new
  mystery, this knowledge that he could not miss. It had been vaguely present
  in his mind when he faced the crowd at Martindale, he remembered now. And the
  same merciless coldness had been in his hand when he pressed his gun into the
  throat of Charles Merchant.</p>

  <p>He turned his eyes and looked down the guns of the two men who had halted.
  Then, hardly looking at his target, he snapped his rifle back to his shoulder
  and fired. He saw Bill Dozier throw up his hands, saw his head rock stupidly
  back and forth, and then the long figure toppled to one side. One of the
  posse rushed alongside to catch his leader, but he missed, and Bill, slumping
  to the ground, was trampled underfoot.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

  <p class="first">At the same time the rifles of the two men of the posse
  rang, but they must have seen the fall of their leader, for the shots went
  wild, and Andy Lanning took off his hat and waved to them. But he did not
  flee again. He sat in his saddle with the long rifle balanced across the
  pommel while two thoughts went through his mind. One was to stay there and
  watch. The other was to slip the rifle back into the holster and with drawn
  revolver charge the five remaining members of the posse. These were now
  gathering hastily about Bill Dozier. But Andy knew their concern was in vain.
  He knew where that bullet had driven home, and Bill Dozier would never ride
  again.</p>

  <p>One by one he picked up those five figures with his eyes, fighting
  temptation. He knew that he could not miss if he fired again. In five shots
  he knew that he could drop as many men, and within him there was a perfect
  consciousness that they would not hit him when they returned the fire.</p>

  <p>He was not filled with exulting courage. He was cold with fear. But it was
  the sort of fear which makes a man want to fling himself from a great height.
  But, sitting there calmly in the saddle, he saw a strange thing&mdash; the
  five men raising their dead leader and turning back toward the direction from
  which they had come. Not once did they look toward the form of Andy Lanning.
  They knew what he could not know, that the gate of the law had been open to
  this man as a retreat, but the bullet which struck down Bill Dozier had
  closed the gate and thrust him out from mercy. He was an outlaw, a leper now.
  Any one who shared his society from this moment on would fall under the heavy
  hand of the law.</p>

  <p>But as for running him into the ground, they had lost their appetite for
  such fighting. They had kept up a long running fight and gained nothing; but
  a single shot from the fugitive had produced this result. They turned now in
  silence and went back, very much as dogs turn and tuck their tails between
  their legs when the wolf, which they have chased away from the precincts of
  the ranch house, feels himself once more safe from the hand of man and whirls
  with a flash of teeth. The sun gleamed on the barrel of Andy Lanning's rifle,
  and these men rode back in silence, feeling that they had witnessed one of
  those prodigies which were becoming fewer and fewer around
  Martindale&mdash;the birth of a desperado.</p>

  <p>Andrew watched them skulking off with the body of Bill Dozier held upright
  by a man on either side of the horse. He watched them draw off across the
  hills, still with that nervous, almost irresistible impulse to raise one
  wild, long cry and spur after them, shooting swift and straight over the head
  of the pinto. But he did not move, and now they dropped out of sight. And
  then, looking about him, Andrew Lanning felt how vast were those hills, how
  wide they stretched, and how small he stood among them. He was utterly alone.
  There was nothing but the hills and a sky growing pale with heat and the
  patches of olive- gray sagebrush in the distance.</p>

  <p>A great melancholy dropped upon Andy. He felt a childish weakness;
  dropping his elbows upon the pommel of the saddle, he buried his face in his
  hands. In that moment he needed desperately something to which he could
  appeal for comfort.</p>

  <p>The weakness passed slowly.</p>

  <p>He dismounted and looked his horse over carefully. The pinto had many good
  points. He had ample girth of chest at the cinches, where lung capacity is
  best measured. He had rather short forelegs, which promised weight-carrying
  power and some endurance, and he had a fine pair of sloping shoulders. But
  his croup sloped down too much, and he had a short neck. Andy knew perfectly
  well that no horse with a short neck can run fast for any distance. He had
  chosen the pinto for endurance, and endurance he undoubtedly had; but he
  would need a horse which could put him out of short-shooting distance, and do
  it quickly.</p>

  <p>There were no illusions in the mind of Andrew Lanning about what lay
  before him. Uncle Jasper had told him too many tales of his own experiences
  on the trail in enemy country.</p>

  <p>"There's three things," the old man had often said, "that a man needs when
  he's in trouble: a gun that's smooth as silk, a hoss full of running, and a
  friend."</p>

  <p>For the gun Andy had his Colt in the holster, and he knew it like his own
  mind. There were newer models and trickier weapons, but none which worked so
  smoothly under the touch of Andy. Thinking of this, he produced it from the
  holster with a flick of his fingers. The sight had been filed away. When he
  was a boy in short trousers he had learned from Uncle Jasper the two main
  articles of a gun fighter's creed&mdash;that a revolver must be fired by
  pointing, not sighting, and that there must be nothing about it liable to
  hang in the holster to delay the draw. The great idea was to get the gun on
  your man with lightning speed, and then fire from the hip with merely a sense
  of direction to guide the bullet.</p>

  <p>He had a gun, therefore, and one necessity was his. Sorely he needed a
  horse of quality as few men needed one. And he needed still more a friend, a
  haven in time of crisis, an adviser in difficulties. And though Andy knew
  that it was death to go among men, he knew also that it was death to do
  without these two things.</p>

  <p>He believed that there was one chance left to him, and that was to
  outdistance the news of the two killings by riding straight north. There he
  would stop at the first town, in some manner fill his pockets with money, and
  in some manner find both horse and friend.</p>

  <p>Andrew Lanning was both simple and credulous; but it must be remembered
  that he had led a sheltered life, comparatively speaking; he had been brought
  up between a blacksmith shop on the one hand and Uncle Jasper on the other,
  and the gaps in his knowledge of men were many and huge. The prime necessity
  now was speed to the northward. So Andy flung himself into the saddle and
  drove his horse north at the jogging, rocking lope of the cattle pony.</p>

  <p>He was in a shallow basin which luckily pointed in the right direction for
  him. The hills sloped down to it from either side in long fingers, with
  narrow gullies between, but as Andy passed the first of these pointing
  fingers a new thought came to him.</p>

  <p>It might be&mdash;why not?&mdash;that the posse had made only a pretense
  of withdrawing at once with the body of the dead man. Perhaps they had only
  waited until they were out of sight and had then circled swiftly around,
  leaving one man with the body. They might be waiting now at the mouth of any
  of these gullies.</p>

  <p>No sooner had the thought come to Andy than he whitened. The pinto had
  been worked hard that morning and all the night before, but now Andy sent the
  spurs home without mercy as he shot up the basin at full speed, with his
  revolver drawn, ready for a snap shot and a drop behind the far side of his
  horse.</p>

  <p>For half an hour he rode in this fashion with his heart beating at his
  teeth. And each canyon as he passed was empty, and each had some shrub, like
  a crouching man, to startle him and upraise the revolver. At length, with the
  pinto wheezing from this new effort, he drew back to an easier gait. But
  still he had a companion ceaselessly following like the shadow of the horse
  he rode. It was fear, and it would never leave him.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

  <p class="first">After that forced and early rising, the rest of the house
  had remained awake, but Anne Withero was gifted with an exceptionally strong
  set of nerves. She had gone back to bed and fallen promptly into a pleasant
  sleep. And when she wakened all that happened in the night was filmed over
  and had become dreamlike. No one disturbed her rest; but when she went down
  to a late breakfast she found Charles Merchant lingering in the room. He had
  questioned her closely, and after a moment of thought she told him exactly
  what had happened, because she was perfectly aware that he would not believe
  a word of it. And she was right. He had sat opposite her, drumming his
  fingers without noise on the table, with a smile now and then which was
  tinged, she thought, with insolence.</p>

  <p>Yet he seemed oddly undisturbed. She had expected some jealous outburst,
  some keen questioning of the motives which had made her beg them not to
  pursue this man. But Charles Merchant was only interested in what the fellow
  had said and done when he talked with her. "He was just like a man out of a
  book," said the girl in conclusion, "and I'll wager that he's been raised on
  romances. He had the face for it, you know&mdash;and the wild look!"</p>

  <p>"A blacksmith&mdash;in Martindale&mdash;raised on romances?" Charles had
  said as he fingered his throat, which was patched with black and blue.</p>

  <p>"A blacksmith&mdash;in Martindale," she had repeated slowly. And it
  brought a new view of the affair home to her. Now that they knew from Bill
  Dozier that the victim in Martindale had been only injured, and not actually
  killed, the whole matter became rather a farce. It would be an amusing tale.
  But now, as Charles Merchant repeated the words, "blacksmith"
  &mdash;"Martindale," the new idea shocked her, the new idea of Andrew
  Lanning, for Charles had told her the name.</p>

  <p>The new thought stayed with her when she went back to her room after
  breakfast, ostensibly to read, but really to think. Remembering Andrew
  Lanning, she got past the white face and the brilliant black eyes; she felt,
  looking back, that he had shown a restraint which was something more than
  boyish. When he took her in his arms just before he fled he had not kissed
  her, though, for that matter, she had been perfectly ready to let him do
  it.</p>

  <p>That moment kept recurring to her&mdash;the beating on the door, the
  voices in the hall, the shouts, and the arms of Andrew Lanning around her,
  and his tense, desperate face close to hers. It became less dreamlike that
  moment. She began to understand that if she lived to be a hundred, she would
  never find that memory dimmer.</p>

  <p>A half-sad, half-happy smile was touching the corners of her mouth, when
  Charles Merchant knocked at her door. She gave herself one moment in which to
  banish the queer pain of knowing that she would never see this wild Andrew
  again, and then she told Charles to come in.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was already opening the door. He was calm of face, but she
  guessed an excitement beneath the surface.</p>

  <p>"I've got something to show you," he said.</p>

  <p>A great thought made her sit up in the chair; but she was afraid just then
  to stand up. "I know. The posse has reached that silly boy and brought him
  back. But I don't want to see him again. Handcuffed, and all that."</p>

  <p>"The posse is here, at least," said Charles noncommittally. She was
  finding something new in him. The fact that he could think and hide his
  thoughts from her was indeed very new; for, when she first met him, he had
  seemed all surface, all clean young manhood without a stain.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to see the six brave men again?" she asked, smiling, but
  really she was prying at his mind to get a clew of the truth. "Well, I'll
  come down."</p>

  <p>And she went down the stairs with Charles Merchant beside her; he kept
  looking straight ahead, biting his lips, and this made her wonder. She began
  to hum a gay little tune, and the first bar made the man start. So she kept
  on. She was bubbling with apparent good nature when Charles, all gravity,
  opened the door of the living room.</p>

  <p>The shades were drawn. The quiet in that room was a deadly, living thing.
  And then she saw, on the sofa at one side of the place, a human form under a
  sheet.</p>

  <p>"Charles!" whispered the girl. She put out her hand and touched his
  shoulder, but she could not take her eyes off that ghastly dead thing. "They
  &mdash;they&mdash;he's dead&mdash;Andrew Lanning! Why did you bring me
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Take the cloth from his face," commanded Charles Merchant, and there was
  something so hard in his voice that she obeyed.</p>

  <p>The sheet came away under her touch, and she was looking into the sallow
  face of Bill Dozier. She had remembered him because of the sad mustaches,
  that morning, and his big voice.</p>

  <p>"That's what your romantic boy out of a book has done," said Charles
  Merchant. "Look at his work!"</p>

  <p>But she dropped the sheet and whirled on him.</p>

  <p>"And they left him&mdash;" she said.</p>

  <p>"Anne," said he, "are you thinking about the safety of that murderer
  &mdash;now? He's safe, but they'll get him later on; he's as good as dead, if
  that's what you want to know."</p>

  <p>"God help him!" said the girl.</p>

  <p>And going back a pace, she stood in the thick shadow, leaning against the
  wall, with one hand across her lips. It reminded Charles of the picture he
  had seen when he broke into her room after Andrew Lanning had escaped. And
  she looked now, as, then, more beautiful, more wholly to be desired than he
  had ever known her before. Yet he could neither move nor speak. He saw her go
  out of the room. Then, without stopping to replace the sheet, he
  followed.</p>

  <p>He had hoped to wipe the last thought of that vagabond blacksmith out of
  her mind with the shock of this horror. Instead, he knew now that he had done
  quite another thing. And in addition he had probably made her despise him for
  taking her to confront such a sight.</p>

  <p>All in all, Charles Merchant was exceedingly thoughtful as he closed the
  door and stepped into the hall. He ran up the stairs to her room. The door
  was closed. There was no answer to his knock, and by trying the knob he found
  that she had locked herself in. And the next moment he could hear her
  sobbing. He stood for a moment more, listening, and wishing Andrew Lanning
  dead with all his heart.</p>

  <p>Then he went down to the garage, climbed into his car, and burned up the
  road between his place and that of Hal Dozier. There was very little
  similarity between the two brothers. Bill had been tall and lean; Hal was
  compact and solid, and he had the fighting agility of a starved coyote. He
  had a smooth- shaven face as well, and a clear gray eye, which was known
  wherever men gathered in the mountain desert. There was no news to give him.
  A telephone message had already told him of the death of Bill Dozier.</p>

  <p>"But," said Charles Merchant, "there's one thing I can do. I can set you
  free to run down this Lanning."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"You're needed on your ranch, Hal; but I want you to let me stand the
  expenses of this trip. Take your time, make sure of him, and run him into the
  ground."</p>

  <p>"My friend," said Hal Dozier, "you turn a pleasure into a real party."</p>

  <p>And Charles Merchant left, knowing that he had signed the death warrant of
  young Lanning. In all the history of the mountain desert there was a tale of
  only one man who had escaped, once Hal Dozier took his trail, and that man
  had blown out his own brains.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

  <p class="first">Far away in the western sky Andy Lanning saw a black dot
  that moved in wide circles and came up across the heavens slowly, and he knew
  it was a buzzard that scented carrion and was coming up the wind toward that
  scent. He had seen them many a time before on their gruesome trails, and the
  picture which he carried was not a pleasant one.</p>

  <p>But now the picture that drifted through his mind was still more horrible.
  It was a human body lying face downward in the sand with the wind ruffling in
  the hair and the hat rolled a few paces off and the gun close to the
  outstretched hand. He knew from Uncle Jasper that no matter how far the trail
  led, or how many years it was ridden, the end of the outlaw was always the
  same&mdash;death and the body left to the buzzards. Or else, in some barroom,
  a footfall from behind and a bullet through the back.</p>

  <p>The flesh of Andy crawled. It was not possible for him to relax in
  vigilance for a moment, lest danger come upon him when he least expected it.
  Perhaps, in some open space like this. He went on until the sun was low in
  the west and all the sky was rimmed with color.</p>

  <p>Dusk had come over the hills in a rush, when he saw a house half lost in
  the shadows. It was a narrow-fronted, two-storied, unpainted, lonely place,
  without sign of a porch. Here, where there was no vestige of a town near, and
  where there was no telephone, the news of the deaths of Bill Dozier and Buck
  Heath could not have come. Andy accepted the house as a blessing and went
  straight toward it.</p>

  <p>But the days of carelessness were over for Andy, and he would never again
  approach a house without searching it like a human face. He studied this
  shack as he came closer. If there were people in the building they did not
  choose to show a light.</p>

  <p>Andy went around to the rear of the house, where there was a low shed
  beside the corral, half tumbled down; but in the corral were five or six fine
  horses&mdash;wild fellows with bright eyes and the long necks of speed. Andy
  looked upon them wistfully. Not one of them but was worth the price of three
  of the pinto; but as for money there was not twenty dollars in the pocket of
  Andy.</p>

  <p>Stripping the saddle from the pinto, he put it under the shed and left the
  mustang to feed and find water in the small pasture. Then he went with the
  bridle, that immemorial sign of one who seeks hospitality in the West, toward
  the house. He was met halfway by a tall, strong man of middle age or more.
  There was no hat on his head, which was covered with a shock of brown hair
  much younger than the face beneath it. He beheld Andy without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"You figure on layin' over here for the night, stranger?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's it," said Andy.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you how it is," said the big man in the tone of one who is
  willing to argue a point. "We ain't got a very big house&mdash;you see it
  &mdash;and it's pretty well filled right now. If you was to slope over the
  hills there, you'd find Gainorville inside of ten miles."</p>

  <p>Andy explained that he was at the end of a hard ride. "Ten more miles
  would kill the pinto," he said. "But if you don't mind, I'll have a bit of
  chow and then turn in out there in the shed. That won't crowd you in your
  sleeping quarters, and it'll be fine for me."</p>

  <p>The big man opened his mouth to say something more, then turned on his
  heel.</p>

  <p>"I guess we can fix you up," he said. "Come on along."</p>

  <p>At another time Andy would have lost a hand rather than accept such
  churlish hospitality, but he was in no position to choose. The pain of hunger
  was like a voice speaking in him.</p>

  <p>It was a four-room house; the rooms on the ground floor were the kitchen,
  where Andy cooked his own supper of bacon and coffee and flapjacks, and the
  combination living room, dining room, and, from the bunk covered with
  blankets on one side, bedroom. Upstairs there must have been two more rooms
  of the same size.</p>

  <p>Seated about a little kitchen table in the front room, Andy found three
  men playing an interrupted game of blackjack, which was resumed when the big
  fellow took his place before his hand. The three gave Andy a look and a
  grunt, but otherwise they paid no attention to him. And if they had consulted
  him he could have asked for no greater favor. Yet he had an odd hunger about
  seeing them. They were the last men in many a month, perhaps, whom he could
  permit to see him without a fear. He brought his supper into the living room
  and put his cup of coffee on the floor beside him. While he ate he watched
  them.</p>

  <p>They were, all in all, the least prepossessing group he had ever seen. The
  man who had brought him in was far from well favored, but he was handsome
  compared with the others. Opposite him sat a tall fellow very erect and stiff
  in his chair. A candle had recently been lighted, and it stood on the table
  near this man. It showed a wan face of excessive leanness. His eyes were deep
  under bony brows, and they alone of the features showed any expression as the
  game progressed, turning now and again to the other faces with glances that
  burned; he was winning steadily. A red-headed man was on his left, with his
  back to Andy; but now and again he turned, and Andy saw a heavy jowl and a
  skin blotched with great, rusty freckles. His shoulders over-flowed the back
  of his chair, which creaked whenever he moved. The man who faced the redhead
  was as light as his companion was ponderous. His voice was gentle, his eyes
  large and soft, and his profile was exceedingly handsome. But in the full
  view Andy saw nothing except a grisly, purple scar that twisted down beneath
  the right eye of the man. It drew down the lower lid of that eye, and it
  pulled the mouth of the man a bit awry, so that he seemed to be smiling in a
  smug, half-apologetic manner. In spite of his youth he was unquestionably the
  dominant spirit here. Once or twice the others lifted their voices in
  argument, and a single word from him cut them short. And when he raised his
  head, now and again, to look at Andy, it gave the latter a feeling that his
  secret was read and all his past known.</p>

  <p>These strange fellows had not asked his name, and neither had they
  introduced themselves, but from their table talk he gathered that the redhead
  was named Jeff, the funereal man with the bony face was Larry, the
  brown-haired one was Joe, and he of the scar and the smile was Henry. It
  occurred to Andy as odd that such rough boon companions had not shortened
  that name for convenience.</p>

  <p>They played with the most intense concentration. As the night deepened and
  the windows became black slabs Joe brought another candle and reenforced this
  light by hanging a lantern from a nail on the wall. This illuminated the
  entire room, but in a partial and dismal manner. The game went on. They were
  playing for high stakes; Andrew Lanning had never seen so much cash assembled
  at one time. They had stacks of unmistakable yellow gold before them&mdash;
  actually stacks. The winner was Larry. That skull-faced gentleman was fairly
  barricaded behind heaps of money. Andy estimated swiftly that there must be
  well over two thousand dollars in those stacks.</p>

  <p>He finished his supper, and, having taken the tin cup and plate out into
  the next room and cleaned them, he had no sooner come back to the door, on
  the verge of bidding them good night, then Henry invited him to sit down and
  take a hand.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

  <p class="first">He had never studied any men as he was watching these men at
  cards. Andrew Lanning had spent most of his life quite indifferent to the
  people around him, but now it was necessary to make quick and sure judgments.
  He had to read unreadable faces. He had to guess motives. He had to sense the
  coming of danger before it showed its face. And, watching them with close
  intentness, he understood that at least three of them were cheating at every
  opportunity. Henry, alone, was playing a square game; as for the heavy
  winner, Larry, Andrew had reason to believe that he was adroitly palming an
  ace now and then&mdash; luck ran too consistently his way. For his own part,
  he was no card expert, and he smiled as Henry made his offer.</p>

  <p>"I've got eleven dollars and fifty cents in my pocket," Andrew said
  frankly. "I won't sit in at that game."</p>

  <p>"Then the game is three-handed," said Henry as he got up from his chair.
  "I've fed you boys enough," he continued in his soft voice. "I know a three-
  handed game is no good, but I'm through. Unless you'll try a round or two
  with 'em, stranger? They've made enough money. Maybe they'll play for silver
  for the fun of it, eh, boys?"</p>

  <p>There was no enthusiastic assent. The three looked gravely at a victim
  with eleven dollars and fifty cents, the chair of Big Jeff creaking noisily
  as he turned. "Sit in," said Jeff. He made a brief gesture, like one wiping
  an obstacle out of the way. "Alright," nodded Andy, for the thing began to
  excite him. He turned to Henry. "Suppose you deal for us?"</p>

  <p>The scar on Henry's face changed color, and his habitual smile broadened.
  "Well!" exclaimed Larry. "Maybe the gent don't like the way we been runnin'
  this game in other ways. Maybe he's got a few more suggestions to make,
  sittin' in? I like to be obligin'."</p>

  <p>He grinned, and the effect was ghastly.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Andy. "That lets me out as far as suggestions go." He
  paused with his hand on the back of the chair, and something told him that
  Larry would as soon run a knife into him as take a drink of water. The eyes
  burned up at him out of the shadow of the brows, but Andy, though his heart
  leaped, made himself meet the stare. Suddenly it wavered, and only then would
  Andy sit down. Henry had drawn up another chair.</p>

  <p>"That idea looks good to me," he said. "I think I shall deal." And
  forthwith, as one who may not be resisted, he swept up the cards and began to
  shuffle.</p>

  <p>The others at once lost interest. Each of them nonchalantly produced
  silver, and they began to play negligently, careless of their stakes.</p>

  <p>But to Andy, who had only played for money half a dozen times before, this
  was desperately earnest. He kept to a conservative game, and slowly but
  surely he saw his silver being converted into gold. Only Larry noticed his
  gains&mdash;the others were indifferent to it, but the skull-faced man
  tightened his lips as he saw. Suddenly he began betting in gold, ten dollars
  for each card he drew. The others were out of that hand. Andy, breathless,
  for he had an ace down, saw a three and a two fall&mdash;took the long
  chance, and, with the luck behind him, watched a five-spot flutter down to
  join his draw. Yet Larry, taking the same draw, was not busted. He had a pair
  of deuces and a four. There he stuck, and it stood to reason that he could
  not win. Yet he bet recklessly, raising Andy twice, until the latter had no
  more money on the table to call a higher bet. The showdown revealed an ace
  under cover for Larry also. Now he leaned across the table, smiling at
  Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I like the hand you show," said Larry, "but I don't like your face behind
  it, my friend."</p>

  <p>His smile went out; his hand jerked back; and then the lean, small hand of
  Henry shot out and fastened on the tall man's wrist. "You skunk!" said Henry.
  "D'you want to get the kid for that beggarly mess? Bah!"</p>

  <p>Andy, colorless, his blood cold, brushed aside the arm of the
  intercessor.</p>

  <p>"Partner," he said, leaning a little forward in turn, and thereby making
  his holster swing clear of the seat of his chair, "partner, I don't mind your
  words, but I don't like the way you say 'em."</p>

  <p>When he began to speak his voice was shaken; before he had finished, his
  tones rang, and he felt once more that overwhelming desire which was like the
  impulse to fling himself from a height. He had felt it before, when he
  watched the posse retreat with the body of Bill Dozier. He felt it now, a
  vast hunger, an almost blinding eagerness to see Larry make an incriminating
  move with his bony, hovering right hand. The bright eyes burned at him for a
  moment longer out of the shadow. Then, again, they wavered, and turned
  away.</p>

  <p>Andy knew that the fellow had no more stomach for a fight. Shame might
  have made him go through with the thing he started, however, had not Henry
  cut in again and given Larry a chance to withdraw gracefully.</p>

  <p>"The kid's called your bluff, Larry," he said. "And the rest of us don't
  need to see you pull any target practice. Shake hands with the kid, will you,
  and tell him you were joking!"</p>

  <p>Larry settled back in his chair with a grunt, and Henry, without a word,
  tipped back in his chair and kicked the table. Andy, beside him, saw the move
  start, and he had just time to scoop his own winnings, including that last
  rich bet, off the table top and into his pocket. As for the rest of the coin,
  it slid with a noisy jangle to the floor, and it turned the other three men
  into scrambling madmen. They scratched and clawed at the money, cursing
  volubly, and Andy, stepping back out of the fracas, saw the scar-faced man
  watching with a smile of contempt. There was a snarl; Jeff had Joe by the
  throat, and Joe was reaching for his gun. Henry moved forward to interfere
  once more, but this time he was not needed. A clear whistling sounded outside
  the house, and a moment later the door was kicked open. A man came in with
  his saddle on his hip.</p>

  <p>His appearance converted the threatening fight into a scene of jovial good
  nature. The money was swept up at random, as though none of them had the
  slightest care what became of it.</p>

  <p>"Havin' one of your little parties, eh?" said the stranger. "What started
  it?"</p>

  <p>"He did, Scottie," answered Larry, and, stretching out an arm of enormous
  length, he pointed at Andrew.</p>

  <p>Again it required the intervention of Henry to explain matters, and
  Scottie, with his hands on his hips, turned and surveyed Andrew with
  considering eyes. He was much different from the rest. Whereas, they had one
  and all a peculiarly unhealthy effect upon Andy, this newcomer was a cheery
  fellow, with an eye as clear as crystal, and color in his tanned cheeks. He
  had one of those long faces which invariably imply shrewdness, and he canted
  his head to one side while he watched Andy. "You're him that put the pinto in
  the corral, I guess?" he said.</p>

  <p>Andy nodded.</p>

  <p>There was no further mention of the troubles of that card game. Jeff and
  Joe and Larry were instantly busied about the kitchen and in arranging the
  table, while Scottie, after the manner of a guest, bustled about and
  accomplished little.</p>

  <p>But the eye of Andy, then and thereafter, whenever he was near the five,
  kept steadily upon the scar-faced man. Henry had tilted his chair back
  against the wall. The night had come on chill, with a rising wind that hummed
  through the cracks of the ill-built wall and tossed the flame in the throat
  of the chimney; Henry draped a coat like a cloak around his shoulders and
  buried his chin in his hands, separated from the others by a vast gulf.
  Presently Scottie was sitting at the table. The others were gathered around
  him in expectant attitudes.</p>

  <p>"What's new?" they exclaimed in one voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, about a million things. Let me get some of this ham into my face, and
  then I'll talk. I've got a batch of newspapers yonder. There's a gold rush on
  up to Tolliver's Creek."</p>

  <p>Andy blinked, for that news was at least four weeks old. But now came a
  tide of other news, and almost all of it was stale stuff to him. But the men
  drank it in&mdash;all except Henry, silent in his corner. He was relaxed, as
  if he slept. "But the most news is about the killing of Bill Dozier."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

  <p class="first">"Ol' Bill!" grunted red-headed Jeff. "Well, I'll be hung!
  There's one good deed done. He was overdue, anyways."</p>

  <p>Andy, waiting breathlessly, watched lest the eye of the narrator should
  swing toward him for the least part of a second. But Scottie seemed utterly
  oblivious of the fact that he sat in the same room with the murderer. "Well,
  he got it," said Scottie. "And he didn't get it from behind. Seems there was
  a young gent in Martindale&mdash;all you boys know old Jasper Lanning?" There
  was an answering chorus. "Well, he's got a nephew, Andrew Lanning. This kid
  was sort of a bashful kind, they say. But yesterday he up and bashed a fellow
  in the jaw, and the man went down. Whacked his head on a rock, and young
  Lanning thought his man was dead. So he holds off the crowd with a gun, hops
  a horse, and beats it."</p>

  <p>"Pretty, pretty!" murmured Larry. "But what's that got to do with that
  hyena, Bill Dozier?"</p>

  <p>"I don't get it all hitched up straight. Most of the news come from
  Martindale to town by telephone. Seems this young Lanning was follered by
  Bill Dozier. He was always a hound for a job like that, eh?"</p>

  <p>There was a growl of assent.</p>

  <p>"He hand-picked five rough ones and went after Lanning. Chased him all
  night. Landed at John Merchant's place. The kid had dropped in there to call
  on a girl. Can you beat that for cold nerve, him figuring that he'd killed a
  man, and Bill Dozier and five more on his trail to bring him back to wait and
  see whether the buck he dropped lived or died&mdash;and then to slide over
  and call on a lady? No, you can't raise that!"</p>

  <p>But the tidings were gradually breaking in upon the mind of Andrew
  Lanning. Buck Heath had not been dead; the pursuit was simply to bring him
  back on some charge of assault; and now&mdash;Bill Dozier&mdash;the head of
  Andrew swam.</p>

  <p>"Seems he didn't know her, either. Just paid a call round about dawn and
  then rode on. Bill comes along a little later on the trail, gets new horses
  from Merchant, and runs down Lanning early this morning. Runs him down, and
  then Lanning turns in the saddle and drills Bill through the head at five
  hundred yards." Henry came to life. "How far?" he said.</p>

  <p>"That's what they got over the telephone," said Scottie
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Then the news got to Hal Dozier from Merchant's house. Hal hops on the
  wire and gets in touch with the governor, and in about ten seconds they make
  this Lanning kid an outlaw and stick a price on his head&mdash;five thousand,
  I think, and they say Merchant is behind it. The telephone was buzzing with
  it when I left town, and most of the boys were oiling up their gats and
  getting ready to make a play. Pretty easy money, eh, for putting the rollers
  under a kid?"</p>

  <p>Andrew Lanning muttered aloud: "An outlaw!"</p>

  <p>"Not the first time Bill Dozier has done it," said Henry calmly. "That's
  an old maneuver of his&mdash;to hound a man from a little crime to a big
  one."</p>

  <p>The throat of Andrew was dry. "Did you get a description of young
  Lanning?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure," nodded Scottie. "Twenty-three years old, about five feet ten,
  black hair and black eyes, good looking, big shoulders, quiet spoken."</p>

  <p>Andrew made a gesture and looked carelessly out the back window, but, from
  the corner of his eyes, he was noting the five men. Not a line of their
  expressions escaped him. He was seeing, literally, with eyes in the back of
  his head; and if, by the interchange of one knowing glance, or by a
  significant silence, even, these fellows had indicated that they remotely
  guessed his identity, he would have been on his feet like a tiger, gun in
  hand, and backing for the door. Five thousand dollars! What would not one of
  these men do for that sum?</p>

  <p>Andy had been keyed to the breaking point before; but his alertness was
  now trebled, and, like a sensitive barometer, he felt the danger of Larry,
  the brute strength of Jeff, the cunning of Henry, the grave poise of Joe, to
  say nothing of Scottie&mdash;an unknown force. But Scottie was running on in
  his talk; he was telling of how he met the storekeeper in town; he was naming
  everything he saw; these fellows seemed to hunger for the minutest news of
  men. They broke into admiring laughter when Scottie told of his victorious
  tilt of jesting with the storekeeper's daughter; even Henry came out of his
  patient gloom long enough to smile at this, and the rest were like children.
  Larry was laughing so heartily that his eyes began to twinkle. He even
  invited Andrew in on the mirth.</p>

  <p>At this point Andy stood up and stretched elaborately&mdash;but in
  stretching he put his arms behind him, and stretched them down rather than
  up, so that his hands were never far from his hips.</p>

  <p>"I'll be turning in," said Andy, and stepping back to the door so that his
  face would be toward them until the last instant of his exit, he waved good
  night.</p>

  <p>There was a brief shifting of eyes toward him, and a grunt from Jeff; that
  was all. Then the eye of every one reverted to Scottie. But the latter broke
  off his narrative.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you sleepin' in?" he asked. "We could fix you a bunk upstairs, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>Once more the glance of Andrew flashed from face to face, and then he saw
  the first suspicious thing. Scottie was looking straight at Henry, in the
  corner, as though waiting for a direction, and, from the corner of his eye,
  Andrew was aware that Henry had nodded ever so slightly.</p>

  <p>"Here's something you might be interested to know," said Scottie. "This
  young Lanning was riding a pinto hoss." He added, while Andrew stood rooted
  to the spot: "You seemed sort of interested in the description. I allowed
  maybe you'd try your hand at findin' him."</p>

  <p>Andy understood perfectly that he was known, and, with his left hand
  frozen against the knob of the door, he flattened his shoulders against the
  wall and stood ready for the draw. In the crisis, at the first hostile move,
  he decided that he would dive straight for the table, low. It would tumble
  the room into darkness as the candles fell&mdash;a semidarkness, for there
  would be a sputtering lantern still.</p>

  <p>Then he would fight for his life. And looking at the others, he saw that
  they were changed, indeed. They were all facing him, and their faces were
  alive with interest; yet they made no hostile move. No doubt they awaited the
  signal of Henry; there was the greatest danger; and now Henry stood up.</p>

  <p>His first word was a throwing down of disguises. "Mr. Lanning," he said,
  "I think this is a time for introductions."</p>

  <p>That cold exultation, that wild impulse to throw himself into the arms of
  danger, was sweeping over Andrew. He made no gesture toward his gun, though
  his fingers were curling, but he said: "Friends, I've got you all in my eye.
  I'm going to open this door and go out. No harm to any of you. But if you try
  to stop me, it means trouble, a lot of trouble&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>Just a split second of suspense. If a foot stirred, or a hand raised,
  Andrew's curling hand would jerk up and bring out a revolver, and every man
  in the room knew it. Then the voice of Henry, "You'd plan on fighting us
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Take my bridle off the wall," said Andrew, looking straight before him at
  no face, and thereby enabled to see everything, just as a boxer looks in the
  eye of his opponent and thereby sees every move of his gloves. "Take my
  bridle off the wall, you, Jeff, and throw it at my feet."</p>

  <p>The bridle rattled at his feet.</p>

  <p>"This has gone far enough," said Henry. "Lanning, you've got the wrong
  idea. I'm going ahead with the introductions. The red-headed fellow we call
  Jeff is better known to the public as Jeff Rankin. Does that mean anything to
  you?" Jeff Rankin acknowledged the introduction with a broad grin, the
  corners of his mouth being lost in the heavy fold of his jowls. "I see it
  doesn't," went on Henry. "Very well. Joe's name is Joe Clune. Yonder sits
  Scottie Macdougal. There is Larry la Roche. And I am Henry Allister."</p>

  <p>The edge of Andrew's alertness was suddenly dulled. The last name swept
  into his brain a wave of meaning, for of all words on the mountain desert
  there was none more familiar than Henry Allister. Scar-faced Allister, they
  called him. Of those deadly men who figured in the tales of Uncle Jasper,
  Henry Allister was the last and the most grim. A thousand stories clustered
  about him: of how he killed Watkins; of how Langley, the famous Federal
  marshal, trailed him for five years and was finally killed in the duel which
  left Allister with that scar; of how he broke jail at Garrisonville and again
  at St. Luke City. In the imagination of Andrew he had loomed like a giant,
  some seven- foot prodigy, whiskered, savage of eye, terrible of voice. And,
  turning toward him, Andrew saw him in profile with the scar
  obscured&mdash;and his face was of almost feminine refinement.</p>

  <p>Five thousand dollars?</p>

  <p>A dozen rich men in the mountain desert would each pay more than that for
  the apprehension of Allister, dead or alive. And bitterly it came over Andrew
  that this genius of crime, this heartless murderer as story depicted him, was
  no danger to him but almost a friend. And the other four ruffians of
  Allister's band were smiling cordially at him, enjoying his astonishment. The
  day before his hair would have turned white in such a place among such men;
  tonight they were his friends.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

  <p class="first">After that things happened to Andrew in a swirl. They were
  shaking hands with him. They were congratulating him on the killing of Bill
  Dozier. They were patting him on the back. Larry la Roche, who had been so
  hostile, now stood up to the full of his ungainly height and proposed his
  health. And the other men drank it standing. Andy received a tin cup half
  full of whisky, and he drank the burning stuff in acknowledgment. The
  unaccustomed drink went to his head, his muscles began to relax, his eyes
  swam. Voices boomed at him out of a haze. "Why, he's only a young kid. One
  shot put him under the weather."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Larry. He'll learn fast enough."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," said Larry to himself, "he'll learn fast enough!"</p>

  <p>Presently he was lifted and carried by strong arms up a creaking stairs.
  He looked up, and he saw the red hair of the mighty Jeff, who carried him as
  if he had been a child, and deposited him among some blankets.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," Larry la Roche was saying. "How could I tell a man-
  killer like him couldn't stand no more than a girl?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up and get out," said another voice. Heavy footsteps retreated, then
  Andrew heard them once more grumbling and booming below him.</p>

  <p>After that his head cleared rapidly. Two windows were open in this higher
  room, and a sharp current of the night wind blew across him, clearing his
  mind as rapidly as wind blows away a fog. Now he made out that one man had
  not left him; the dark outline of him was by the bed, waiting.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" asked Andrew. "Allister. Take it easy."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right. I'll go down again to the boys."</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm here to talk to you about, kid. Are you sure your head's
  clear?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. Sure thing."</p>

  <p>"Then listen to me, Lanning, while I talk. It's important. Stay here till
  the morning, then ride on."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, away from Martindale, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Out of the desert? Out of the mountains?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. They'll hunt for you here." Allister paused, then went on.
  "And when you get away what'll you do? Go straight?"</p>

  <p>"God willing," said Andrew fervently. "It&mdash;it was only luck, bad
  luck, that put me where I am."</p>

  <p>The outlaw scratched a match and lighted a candle; then he dropped a
  little of the melted tallow on a box, and by that light he peered earnestly
  into Andrew's face. He appeared to need this light to read the expression on
  it. It also enabled Andrew to see the face of Allister. Sometimes the play of
  shadows made that face unreal as a dream, sometimes the face was filled with
  poetic beauty, sometimes the light gleamed on the scar and the sardonic
  smile, and then it was a face out of hell.</p>

  <p>"You're going to get away from the mountain desert and go straight," said
  Allister.</p>

  <p>"That's it." He saw that the outlaw was staring with a smile, half grim
  and half sad, into the shadows and far away.</p>

  <p>"Lanning, let me tell you. You'll never get away."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," said Andrew. "I don't like fighting. It&mdash; it
  makes me sick inside. I'm not a brave man!"</p>

  <p>He waited to see the contempt come on the face of the famous leader, but
  there was nothing but grave attention.</p>

  <p>"Why," Andy went on in a rush of confidence, "everybody in Martindale
  knows that I'm not a fighter. Those fellows downstairs think that I'm a sort
  of bad hombre. I'm not. Why, Allister, when I turned over Buck Heath and saw
  his face, I nearly fainted, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," cut in the other. "That was your first man. You didn't kill him,
  but you thought you had. You nearly fainted, then. But as I gather it, after
  you shot Bill Dozier you simply sat on your horse and waited. Did you feel
  like fainting then?"</p>

  <p>"No," explained Andrew hastily. "I wanted to go after them and shoot'em
  all. They could have rushed me and taken me prisoner easily, but they wanted
  to shoot me from a distance&mdash;and it made me mad to see them work it. I
  &mdash;I hated them all, and I had a reason for it. Curse them!"</p>

  <p>He added hurriedly: "But I've no grudge against anybody. All I want is a
  chance to live quiet and clean."</p>

  <p>There was a faint sigh from Allister.</p>

  <p>"Lanning," he murmured, "the minute I laid eyes on you, I knew you were
  one of my kind. In all my life I've known only one other with that same
  chilly effect in his eyes&mdash;that was Marshal Langley&mdash;only he
  happened to be on the side of the law. No matter. He had the iron dust in
  him. He was cut out to be a man-killer. You say you want to get away:
  Lanning, you can't do it. Because you can't get away from yourself. I'm
  making a long talk to you, but you're worth it. I tell you I read your mind.
  You plan on riding north and getting out of the mountain desert before the
  countryside there is raised against you, the way it's raised to the south. In
  the first place, I don't think you'll get away. Hal Dozier is on your trail,
  and he'll get to the north and raise the whole district and stop you before
  you hit the towns. You'll have to go back to the mountain desert. You'll have
  to do it eventually, why not do it now? Lanning, if I had you at my back I
  could laugh at the law the rest of our lives! Stay with me. I can tell a man
  when I see him. I saw you call Larry la Roche. And I've never wanted a man
  the way I want you. Not to follow me, but as a partner. Shake and say you
  will!"</p>

  <p>The slender hand was stretched out through the shadows, the light from the
  candle flashed on it. And a power outside his own will made Andrew move his
  hand to meet it. He stopped the gesture with a violent effort.</p>

  <p>The swift voice of the outlaw, with a fiber of earnest persuasion in it,
  went on: "You see what I risk to get you. Hal Dozier is on your trail. He's
  the only man in the world I'd think twice about before I met him face to
  face. But if I join to you, I'll have to meet him sooner or later. Well,
  Lanning, I'll take that risk. I know he's more devil than man when it comes
  to gun play, but we'll meet him together. Give me your hand!"</p>

  <p>There was a riot in the brain of Andrew Lanning. The words of the outlaw
  had struck something in him that was like metal chiming on metal. Iron dust?
  That was it! The call of one blood to another, and he realized the truth of
  what Allister said. If he touched the hand of this man, there would be a bond
  between them which only death could break. In one blinding rush he sensed the
  strength and the faith of Allister.</p>

  <p>But another voice was at his ear, and he saw Anne Withero, as she had
  stood for that moment in his arms in her room. It came over him with a chill
  like cold moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Do you fear me?" he had whispered.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Will you remember me?"</p>

  <p>"Forever!"</p>

  <p>And with that ghost of a voice in his ear Andrew Lanning groaned to the
  man beside him: "Partner, I know you're nine-tenths man, and I thank you out
  of the bottom of my heart. But there's some one else has a claim to
  me&mdash;I don't belong to myself."</p>

  <p>There was a breathless pause. Anger contracted the face of Henry Allister;
  he nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"It's the girl you went back to see," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, go ahead and try to win through. I wish you luck. But if you
  fail, remember what I've said. Now, or ten years from now, what I've said
  goes for you. Now roll over and sleep. Good-by, Lanning, or, rather, au
  revoir!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

  <p class="first">The excitement kept Andrew awake for a little time, but then
  the hum of the wind, the roll of voices below him, and the weariness of the
  long ride rushed on him like a wave and washed him out into an ebb of
  sleep.</p>

  <p>When he wakened the aches were gone from his limbs, and his mind was a
  happy blank. Only when he started up from his blankets and rapped his head
  against the slanting rafters just above him, he was brought to a painful
  realization of where he was. He turned, scowling, and the first thing he saw
  was a piece of brown wrapping paper held down by a shoe and covered with a
  clumsy scrawl.</p>

  <p class="letter">"These blankets are yours and the slicker along with them
  and heres wishin you luck while youre beatin it back to civlizashun. your
  friend, JEFF RANKIN."</p>

  <p>Andy glanced swiftly about the room and saw that the other bunks had been
  removed. He swept up the blankets and went down the stairs to the first
  floor. The house reeked of emptiness; broken bottles, a twisted tin plate in
  which some one had set his heel, were the last signs of the outlaws of Henry
  Allister's gang. A bundle stood on the table with another piece of the
  wrapping paper near it. The name of Andrew Lanning was on the outside. He
  unfolded the sheet and read in a precise, rather feminine writing:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Lanning:<br>
  <br>
  "We are, in a manner, sneaking off. I've already said good-by, and I don't
  want to tempt you again. Now you're by yourself and you've got your own way
  to fight. The boys agree with me. We all want to see you make good. We'll all
  be sorry if you come back to us. But once you've found out that it's no go
  trying to beat back to good society, we'll be mighty happy to have you with
  us. In the meantime, we want to do our bit to help Andrew Lanning make up for
  his bad luck.<br>
  <br>
  "For my part, I've put a chamois sack on top of the leather coat with the fur
  lining. You'll find a little money in that purse. Don't be foolish. Take the
  money I leave you, and, when you're back on your feet, I know that you'll
  repay it at your own leisure.<br>
  <br>
  "And here's best luck to you and the girl.<br>
  <br>
  "HENRY ALLISTER."</p>

  <p>Andrew lifted the chamois sack carelessly, and out of its mouth tumbled a
  stream of gold. One by one he picked up the pieces and replaced them; he
  hesitated, and then put the sack in his pocket. How could he refuse a gift so
  delicately made?</p>

  <p>A broken kitchen knife had been thrust through a bit of the paper on the
  box. He read this next:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your hoss is known. So I'm leaving you one in place of the
  pinto. He goes good and he dont need no spurring but when you come behind him
  keep watching your step. Your pal, LARRY LA ROCHE."</p>

  <p>Blankets and slicker, money, horse. A flask of whisky stood on another
  slip of the paper. And the writing on this was much more legible.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Here's a friend in need. When you come to a pinch, use it.
  And when you come to a bigger pinch send word to your friend, SCOTTIE
  MACDOUGAL."</p>

  <p>Andrew picked it up, set it down again, and smiled. On the fur coat there
  was a fifth tag. Not one of the five, then, had forgotten him.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Its comin on cold, partner. Take this coat and welcome.
  When the snows get on the mountains if you aint out of the desert put on this
  coat and think of your partner, JOE CLUNE.<br>
  <br>
  "P.S.&mdash;I seen you first, and I have first call on you over the rest of
  these gents and you can figure that you have first call on me. J.C.</p>

  <p>When he had read all these little letters, when he had gathered his loot
  before him, Andrew lifted his head and could have burst into song. This much
  thieves and murderers had done for him; what would the good men of the world
  do? How would they meet him halfway?</p>

  <p>He went into the kitchen. They had forgotten nothing. There was a quantity
  of "chuck," flour, bacon, salt, coffee, a frying pan, a cup, a canteen.</p>

  <p>It brought a lump in his throat. He cast open the back door, and, standing
  in the little pasture, he saw only one horse remaining. It was a fine, young
  chestnut gelding with a Roman nose and long, mulish ears. His head was not
  beautiful to see from any angle, but every detail of the body spelled speed,
  and speed meant safety.</p>

  <p>What wonder, then, that Andrew began to see the world through a bright
  mist? What wonder that when he had finished his breakfast he sang while he
  roped the chestnut, built the pack behind the saddle, and filled the
  saddlebags. When he was in the saddle, the gelding took at once the cattle
  path with a long and easy canter.</p>

  <p>With his head cleared by sleep, his muscles and nerves relaxed, Andrew
  began to plan his escape with more calm deliberation than before.</p>

  <p>The first goal was the big blue cloud on the northern horizon&mdash;a good
  week's journey ahead of him&mdash;the Little Canover Mountains. Among the
  foothills lay the cordon of small towns which it would be his chief
  difficulty to pass. For, if the printed notices describing him were
  circulated among them, the countryside would be up in arms, prepared to
  intercept his flight. Otherwise, there would be nothing but telephoned and
  telegraphed descriptions of him, which, at best, could only come to the ears
  of a few, and these few would be necessarily put out by the slightest
  difference between him and the description. Such a vital difference, for
  instance, as the fact that he now rode a chestnut, while the instructions
  called for a man on a pinto.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was by no means certain that Hal Dozier, great trailer though
  he was, would know that the fugitive was making for the northern mountains.
  With all these things in mind, in spite of the pessimism of Henry Allister,
  Andrew felt that he had far more than a fighting chance to break out of the
  mountain desert and into the comparative safety of the crowded country
  beyond.</p>

  <p>He made one mistake in the beginning. He pushed the chestnut too hard the
  first and second days, so that on the third day he was forced to give the
  gelding his head and go at a jarring trot most of the day. On the fourth and
  fifth days, however, he had the reward for his caution. The chestnut's ribs
  were beginning to show painfully, but he kept doggedly at his work with no
  sign of faltering. The sixth day brought Andrew Lanning in close view of the
  lower hills. And on the seventh day he put his fortune boldly to the touch
  and jogged into the first little town before him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

  <p class="first">It was just after the hot hour of the afternoon. The shadows
  from the hills to the west were beginning to drop across the village; people
  who had kept to their houses during the early afternoon now appeared on their
  porches. Small boys and girls, returning from school, were beginning to play.
  Their mothers were at the open doors exchanging shouted pieces of news and
  greetings, and Andrew picked his way with care along the street. It was a
  town flung down in the throat of a ravine without care or pattern. There was
  not even one street, but rather a collection of straggling paths which met
  about a sort of open square, on the sides of which were the stores and the
  inevitable saloons and hotel.</p>

  <p>But the narrow path along which Andrew rode was a gantlet to him. For all
  he knew, the placards might be already out, one of the least of those he
  passed might have recognized him. He noticed that one or two women, in their
  front door, stopped in the midst of a word to watch him curiously. It seemed
  to Andrew that a buzz of comment and warning preceded him and closed behind
  him. He felt sure that the children stood and gaped at him from behind, but
  he dared not turn in his saddle to look back.</p>

  <p>And he kept on, reining in the gelding, and probing every face with one
  swift, resistless glance that went to the heart. He found himself literally
  taking the brains and hearts of men into the palm of his hand and weighing
  them. Yonder old man, so quiet, with the bony fingers clasped around the bowl
  of his corncob, sitting under the awning by the watering trough&mdash;that
  would be an ill man to cross in a pinch&mdash;that hand would be steady as a
  rock on the barrel of a gun. But the big, square man with the big, square
  face who talked so loudly on the porch of yonder store&mdash;there was a bag
  of wind that could be punctured by one threat and turned into a figure of
  tallow by the sight of a gun.</p>

  <p>Andrew went on with his lightning summary of the things he passed. But
  when he came to the main square, the heart of the town, it was quite empty.
  He went across to the hotel, tied the gelding at the rack, and sat down on
  the veranda. He wanted with all his might to go inside, to get a room, to be
  alone and away from this battery of searching eyes. But he dared not. He must
  mingle with these people and learn what they knew.</p>

  <p>He went in and sought the bar. It should be there, if anywhere, the poster
  with the announcement of Andrew Lanning's outlawry and the picture of him.
  What picture would they take? The old snapshot of the year before, which
  Jasper had taken? No doubt that would be the one. But much as he yearned to
  do so, he dared not search the wall. He stood up to the bar and faced the
  bartender. The latter favored him with one searching glance, and then pushed
  across the whisky bottle.</p>

  <p>"Do you know me?" asked Andrew with surprise. And then he could have
  cursed his careless tongue.</p>

  <p>"I know you need a drink," said the bartender, looking at Andrew again.
  Suddenly he grinned. "When a man's been dry that long he gets a hungry look
  around the eyes that I know. Hit her hard, boy."</p>

  <p>Andrew brimmed his glass and tossed off the drink. And to his astonishment
  there was none of the shocking effect of his first drink of whisky. It was
  like a drop of water tossed on a huge blotter. To his tired nerves the
  alcohol was a mere nothing. Besides, he dared not let it affect him. He
  filled a second glass, pushing across the bar one of the gold pieces of Henry
  Allister. Then, turning casually, he glanced along the wall. There were other
  notices up&mdash;many written ones&mdash;but not a single face looked back at
  him. All at once he grew weak with relief. But in the meantime he must talk
  to this fellow.</p>

  <p>"What's the news?"</p>

  <p>"What kind of news?"</p>

  <p>"Any kind. I've been talkin' more to coyotes than to men for a long
  spell."</p>

  <p>Should he have said that? Was not that a suspicious speech? Did it not
  expose him utterly?</p>

  <p>"Nothin' to talk about here much more excitin' than a coyote's yap. Not a
  damn thing. Which way you come from?"</p>

  <p>"South. The last I heard of excitin' news was this stuff about Lanning,
  the outlaw."</p>

  <p>It was out, and he was glad of it. He had taken the bull by the horns.</p>

  <p>"Lanning? Lanning? Never heard of him. Oh, yes, the gent that bumped off
  Bill Dozier. Between you and me, they won't be any sobbin' for that. Bill had
  it comin'. But they've outlawed Lanning, have they?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I hear."</p>

  <p>But sweet beyond words had been this speech from the bartender. They had
  barely heard of Andrew Lanning in this town; they did not even know that he
  was outlawed. Andrew felt hysterical laughter bubbling in his throat. Now for
  one long sleep; then he would make the ride across the mountains and into
  safety.</p>

  <p>He went out of the barroom, put the gelding away in the stables behind the
  hotel, and got a room. In ten minutes, pausing only to tear the boots from
  his feet, he was sound asleep under the very gates of freedom.</p>

  <p>And while he slept the gates were closing and barring the way. If he had
  wakened even an hour sooner, all would have been well and, though he might
  have dusted the skirts of danger, they could never have blocked his way. But,
  with seven days of exhausting travel behind him, he slept like one drugged,
  the clock around and more. It was morning, mid-morning, when he wakened.</p>

  <p>Even then he was too late, but he wasted priceless minutes eating his
  breakfast, for it was delightful beyond words to have food served to him
  which he had not cooked with his own hands. And so, sauntering out onto the
  veranda of the hotel, he saw a compact crowd on the other side of the square
  and the crowd focused on a man who was tacking up a sign. Andrew, still
  sauntering, joined the crowd, and looking over their heads, he found his own
  face staring back at him; and, under the picture of that lean, serious face,
  in huge black type, five thousand dollars reward for the capture, dead or
  alive&mdash;</p>

  <p>The rest of the notice blurred before his eyes.</p>

  <p>Some one was speaking. "You made a quick trip, Mr. Dozier, and I expect if
  you send word up to Hallowell in the mountains they can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So Hal Dozier had brought the notices himself.</p>

  <p>Andrew, in that moment, became perfectly calm. He went back to the hotel,
  and, resting one elbow on the desk, he looked calmly into the face of the
  clerk and the proprietor. Instantly he saw that the men did not
  suspect&mdash;as yet.</p>

  <p>"I hear Mr. Dozier's here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Room seventeen," said the clerk. "Hold on. He's out in the square
  now."</p>

  <p>"'S all right. I'll wait in his room." He went to room seventeen. The door
  was unlocked. And drawing a chair into the farthest corner, Andrew sat down,
  rolled a cigarette, drew his revolver, and waited.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

  <p class="first">He waited an eternity; in actual time it was exactly ten
  minutes. Then a cavalcade tramped down the hall. He heard their voices, and
  Hal Dozier was among them. About him flowed a babble of questions as the men
  struggled for the honor of a word from the great man. Perhaps he was coming
  to his room to form the posse and issue general instructions for the
  chase.</p>

  <p>The door opened. Dozier entered, jerked his head squarely to one side, and
  found himself gazing into the muzzle of a revolver. The astonishment and the
  swift hardening of his face had begun and ended in a fraction of a
  second.</p>

  <p>"It's you, eh?" he said, still holding the door.</p>

  <p>"Right," said Andrew. "I'm here for a little chat about this Lanning
  you're after."</p>

  <p>Hal Dozier paused another heartbreaking second, then he saw that caution
  was the better way. "I'll have to shut you out for a minute or two, boys. Go
  down to the bar and have a few on me." He turned, laughing and waving to
  them. Then the door closed, and Dozier turned slowly to face his hunted man.
  Into Andrew's mind came back the words of the great outlaw, Allister:
  "There's one man I'd think twice about meeting, and that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Andrew. "And you can take off your belt if you want to.
  Easy! That's it. Thank you."</p>

  <p>The belt and the guns were tossed onto the bed, and Hal Dozier sat down.
  He reminded Andrew of a terrier, not heavy, but all compact nerve and
  fighting force.</p>

  <p>"I'll not frisk you for another gun," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Thanks; I have one, but I'll let it lie."</p>

  <p>He made a movement. "If you don't mind," said Andrew, "I'd rather that you
  don't reach into your pockets. Use my tobacco and papers, if you wish." He
  tossed them onto the table, and Hal Dozier rolled his smoke in silence. Then
  he tilted back in his chair a little. His hand with the cigarette was as
  steady as a vise, and Andrew, shrugging forward his own ponderous shoulders,
  dropped his elbows on his knees and trained the gun full on his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"I've come to make a bargain, Dozier," he said.</p>

  <p>The other made no comment, and the two continued that silent struggle of
  the eyes that was making Andrew's throat dry and his heart leap.</p>

  <p>"Here's the bargain: Drop off this trail. Let the law take its own course
  through other hands, but you give me your word to keep off the trail. If
  you'll do that I'll leave this country and stay away. Except for one thing,
  I'll never come back here. You're a proud man; you've never quit a trail yet
  before the end of it. But this time I only ask you to let it go with running
  me out of the country."</p>

  <p>"What's the one thing for which you'd come back?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come back&mdash;once&mdash;because of a girl."</p>

  <p>He saw the eyes of Dozier widen and then contract again. "You're not
  exactly what I expected to find," he said. "But go on. If I don't take the
  bargain you pull that trigger?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"H'm! You may have heard the voices of the men who came up the hall with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"The moment a report of a gun is heard they'll swarm up to this room and
  get you."</p>

  <p>"They made too much noise. Barking dogs don't bite. Besides, the moment
  I've dropped you I go out that window."</p>

  <p>"It's a good bluff, Lanning," said the other. "I'll tell you what, if you
  were what I expected you to be, a hysterical kid, who had a bit of bad luck
  and good rolled together, I'd take that offer. But you're
  different&mdash;you're a man. All in all, Lanning, I think you're about as
  much of a man as I've ever crossed before. No, you won't pull that trigger,
  because there isn't one deliberate murder packed away in your system. It's a
  good bluff, as I said before, and I admire the way you worked it. But it
  won't do. I call it. I won't leave your trail, Lanning. Now pull your
  trigger."</p>

  <p>He smiled straight into the eye of the younger man. A flush jumped into
  the cheeks of Andrew, and, fading, left him by contrast paler than ever. "You
  were one-quarter of an inch from death, Dozier," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Lanning, with men like you&mdash;and like myself, I hope&mdash; there's
  no question of distance. It's either a miss or a hit. Here's a better
  proposition: Let me put my belt on again. Then put your own gun back in the
  holster. We'll turn and face the wall. And when the clock downstairs strikes
  ten&mdash;that'll be within a few minutes&mdash;we'll turn and blaze at the
  first sound."</p>

  <p>He watched his companion eagerly, and he saw the face of Andrew work. "I
  can't do it, Dozier," said Andrew. "I'd like to. But I can't!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" The voice of Hal Dozier was sharp with a new suspicion. "Get me
  out of the way, and you're free to get across the mountains, and, once there,
  your trail will never be found. I know that; every one knows that. That's why
  I hit up here after you."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why," said Andrew slowly. "I've got the blood of one man on
  my hands already, but, so help me God, I'm not going to have another stain. I
  had to shoot once, because I was hounded into it. And, if this thing keeps
  on, I'm going to shoot again&mdash;and again. But as long as I can I'm
  fighting to keep clean, you understand?"</p>

  <p>His voice became thin and rose as he spoke; his breath was a series of
  gasps, and Hal Dozier changed color.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Andrew, regaining his self-control, "that I'd kill you. I
  think I'm just a split second surer and faster than you are with a gun. But
  don't you see, Dozier?"</p>

  <p>He cast out his left hand, but his right hand held the revolver like a
  rock.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? I've got the taint in me. I've killed my man. If I kill
  another I'll go bad. I know it. Life will mean nothing to me. I can feel it
  in me."</p>

  <p>His voice fell and became deeper.</p>

  <p>"Dozier, give me my chance. It's up to you. Stand aside now, and I'll get
  across those mountains and become a decent man. Keep me here, and I'll be a
  killer. I know it; you know it. Why are you after me? Because your brother
  was killed by me. Dozier, think of your brother and then look at me. Was his
  life worth my life? You're a cool-headed man. You knew him, and you knew what
  he was worth. His killings were as long as the worst bad man that ever
  stepped, except that he had the law behind him. When he got on my trail he
  knew that I was just a scared kid who thought he'd killed a man. Why didn't
  he let me run until I found out that I hadn't killed Buck Heath? Then he
  knew, and you know, that I'd have come back. But he wouldn't give me the
  chance. He ran me into the ground, and I shot him down. And that minute he
  turned me from a scared kid into an outlaw&mdash;a killer. Tell me, man to
  man, Dozier, if Bill hasn't already done me more wrong than I've done
  him!"</p>

  <p>As he finished that strange appeal he noted that the famous fighter was
  white about the mouth and shaken. He added with a burst of appeal: "Hal, you
  know I'm straight. You know I'm worth a chance."</p>

  <p>The older man lifted his head at last. "Andy, I can't leave the
  trail."</p>

  <p>At that sentence every muscle of Andrew's body relaxed, and he sat like
  one in a state of collapse, except that the right hand and the gun in it were
  steady as rocks.</p>

  <p>"Here's something between you and me that I'd swear I never said if I was
  called in a court," went on Hal Dozier in a solemn murmur. "I'll tell you
  that I know Bill was no good. I've known it for years, and I've told him so.
  It's Bill that bled me, and bled me until I've had to soak a mortgage on the
  ranch. It's Bill that's spent the money on his cussed booze and gambling.
  Until now there's a man that can squeeze and ruin me any day, and that's
  Merchant. He sent me hot along this trail. He sent me, but my pride sent me
  also. No, son, I wasn't bought altogether. And if I'd known as much about you
  then as I know now, I'd never have started to hound you. But now I've
  started. Everybody in the mountains, every puncher on the range knows that
  Hal Dozier has started on a new trail, and every man of them knows that I've
  never failed before. Andy, I can't give it up. You see, I've got no shame
  before you. I tell you the straight of it. I tell you that I'm a bought man.
  But I can't leave this trail to go back and face the boys. If one of them was
  to shake his head and say on the side that I'm no longer the man I used to
  be, I'd shoot him dead as sure as there's a reckoning that I'm bound for. It
  isn't you, Andy; it's my reputation that makes me go on."</p>

  <p>He stopped, and the two men looked sadly at each other.</p>

  <p>"Andy, boy," said Hal Dozier, "I've no more bad feeling toward you than if
  you was my own boy." Then he added with a little ring to his voice: "But I'm
  going to stay on your trail till I kill you. You write that down in red."</p>

  <p>And the outlaw dropped his gun suddenly into the holster. "That ends it,
  then," he said slowly. "The next time we meet we won't sit down and chin
  friendly like. We'll let our guns do our talking for us. And, first of all,
  I'm going to get across these mountains, Hal, in spite of you and your
  friends."</p>

  <p>"You can't do it, Andy. Try it. I've sent the word up. The whole mountains
  will be alive watchin' for you. Every trail will be alive with guns."</p>

  <p>But Andrew stood up, and, using always his left hand while the right arm
  hung with apparent carelessness at his side, he arranged his hat so that it
  came forward at a jaunty angle, and then hitched his belt around so that the
  holster hung a little more to the rear. The position for a gun when one is
  sitting is quite different from the proper position when one is standing. All
  these things Uncle Jasper had taught Andrew long and long before. He was
  remembering them in chunks.</p>

  <p>"Give me three minutes to get my saddle on my horse and out of town," said
  Andrew. "Is that fair?"</p>

  <p>"Considering that you could have filled me full of lead here," said Hal
  Dozier, with a wry smile, "I think that's fair enough."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

  <p class="first">As Andrew went down the stairs and through the entrance hall
  he noticed it was filled with armed men. At the door he paused for the least
  fraction of a second, and during that breathing space he had seen every face
  in the room. Then he walked carelessly across to the desk and asked for his
  bill.</p>

  <p>Someone, as he crossed the room, whirled to follow him with a glance. Andy
  heard, for his ears were sharpened: "I thought for a minute&mdash;But it does
  look like him!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, Mike, I seen that gent in the barroom the other day. Besides, he's
  just a kid."</p>

  <p>"So's this Lanning. I'm going out to look at the poster again. You hold
  this gent here."</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll talk to him while you're gone. But be quick. I'll be
  holdin' a laugh for you, Mike."</p>

  <p>Andrew paid his bill, but as he reached the door a short man with legs
  bowed by a life in the saddle waddled out to him and said: "Just a minute,
  partner. Are you one of us?"</p>

  <p>"One of who?" asked Andrew.</p>

  <p>"One of the posse Hal is getting together? Well, come to think of it, I
  guess you're a stranger around here, ain't you?"</p>

  <p>"Me?" asked Andrew. "Why, I've just been talking to Hal."</p>

  <p>"About young Lanning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"By the way, if you're out of Hal's country, maybe you know Lanning,
  too?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I've stood as close to him as I am to you."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so! What sort of a looking fellow is he?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you," said Andrew, and he smiled in an embarrassed
  manner. "They say he's a ringer for me. Not much of a compliment, is it?"</p>

  <p>The other gasped, and then laughed heartily. "No, it ain't, at that," he
  replied. "Say, I got a pal that wants to talk to you. Sort of a job on him,
  at that."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," said Andy calmly. "Take him in to the bar, and I'll
  come in and have a drink with him and you in about two minutes. S'long."</p>

  <p>He was gone through the door while the other half reached a hand toward
  him. But that was all.</p>

  <p>In the stables he had the saddle on the chestnut in twenty seconds, and
  brought him to the watering trough before the barroom.</p>

  <p>He found his short, bow-legged friend in the barroom in the midst of
  excited talk with a big, blond man. He looked a German, with his parted beard
  and his imposing front and he had the stern blue eye of a fighter. "Is this
  your friend?" asked Andrew, and walked straight up to them. He watched the
  eyes of the big man expand and then narrow; his hand even fumbled at his hip,
  but then he shook his head. He was too bewildered to act.</p>

  <p>At that moment there was an uproar from the upper part of the hotel. With
  a casual wave of his hand, Andy wandered out of the barroom and then raced
  for the street. He heard men shouting in the lobby.</p>

  <p>A fighting mass jammed its way into the open, and there, in the middle of
  the square, sat Hal Dozier on his gray stallion. He was giving orders in a
  voice that rang above the crowd, and made voices hush in whispers as they
  heard him. Under his direction the crowd split into groups of four and five
  and six and rode at full speed in three directions out of the town. In the
  meantime there were two trusted friends of Hal Dozier busy at telephones in
  the hotel. They were calling little towns among the mountains. The red alarm
  was spreading like wildfire, and faster than the fastest horse could
  gallop.</p>

  <p>But Andrew, with the chestnut running like a red flash beneath him, had
  vanished.</p>

  <p>Buried away in the mountains, one stiff day's march, was a trapper whom
  Uncle Jasper had once befriended. That was many a day long since, but Uncle
  Jasper had saved the man's life, and he had often told Andrew that, sooner or
  later, he must come to that trapper's cabin to talk of the old times.</p>

  <p>He was bound there now. For, if he could get shelter for three days, the
  hue and cry would subside. When the mountaineers were certain that he must
  have gone past them to other places and slipped through their greedy fingers
  he could ride on in comparative safety. It was an excellent plan. It gave
  Andrew such a sense of safety, as he trotted the chestnut up a steep grade,
  that he did not hear another horse, coming in the opposite direction, until
  the latter was almost upon him. Then, coming about a sharp shoulder of the
  hill, he almost ran upon a bare-legged boy, who rode without saddle upon the
  back of a bay mare. The mare leaped catlike to one side, and her little rider
  clung like a piece of her hide. "You might holler, comin' around a turn,"
  shrilled the boy. And he brought the mare to a halt by jerking the rope
  around her neck. He had no other means of guiding her, no sign of a
  bridle.</p>

  <p>But Andrew looked with hungry eyes. He knew something of horses, and this
  bay fitted into his dreams of an ideal perfectly. She was beautiful, quite
  heavily built in the body, with a great spread of breast that surely told of
  an honest heart beneath a glorious head, legs that fairly shouted to Andrew
  of good blood, and, above all, she had that indescribable thing which is to a
  horse what personality is to a man. She did not win admiration, she commanded
  it. And she stood alert at the side of the road, looking at Andrew like a
  queen. Horse stealing is the cardinal sin in the mountain desert, but Andrew
  felt the moment he saw her that she must be his. At least he would first try
  to buy her honorably.</p>

  <p>"Son," he said to the urchin, "how much for that horse?"</p>

  <p>"Why," said the boy, "anything you'll give."</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh at me," said Andrew sternly. "I like her looks and I'll buy
  her. I'll trade this chestnut&mdash;and he's a fine traveler&mdash;with a
  good price to boot. If your father lives up the road and not down, turn back
  with me and I'll see if I can't make a trade."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to see him," said the boy. "I can tell you that he'll sell
  her. You throw in the chestnut and you won't have to give any boot." And he
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"But there's the house." He pointed across the ravine at a little green-
  roofed shack buried in the rocks. "You can come over if you want to."</p>

  <p>"Is there something wrong with her?"</p>

  <p>"Nothin' much. Pop says she's the best hoss that ever run in these parts.
  And he knows, I'll tell a man!"</p>

  <p>"Son, I've got to have that horse!"</p>

  <p>"Mister," said the boy suddenly, "I know how you feel. Lots feel the same
  way. You want her bad, but she ain't worth her feed. A skunk put a bur under
  the saddle when she was bein' broke, and since then anybody can ride her
  bareback, but nothin' in the mountains can sit a saddle on her."</p>

  <p>Andrew cast one more long, sad look at the horse. He had never seen a
  horse that went so straight to his heart, and then he straightened the
  chestnut up the road and went ahead.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

  <p class="first">He had to be guided by what Uncle Jasper had often
  described&mdash;a mountain whose crest was split like the crown of a hat
  divided sharply by a knife, and the twin peaks were like the ears of a mule,
  except that they came together at the base. By the position of those distant
  summits he knew that he was in the ravine leading to the cabin of Hank
  Rainer, the trapper.</p>

  <p>Presently the sun flashed on a white cliff, a definite landmark by which
  Uncle Jasper had directed him, so Andrew turned out of his path on the
  eastern side of the gully and rode across the ravine. The slope was steep on
  either side, covered with rocks, thick with slides of loose pebbles and sand.
  His horse, accustomed to a more open country, was continually at fault. He
  did not like his work, and kept tossing his ugly head and champing the bit as
  they went down to the river bottom.</p>

  <p>It was not a real river, but only an angry creek that went fuming and
  crashing through the canyon with a voice as loud as some great stream. Andrew
  had to watch with care for a ford, for though the bed was not deep the water
  ran like a rifle bullet over smooth places and was torn to a white froth when
  it struck projecting rocks. He found, at length, a place where it was backed
  up into a shallow pool, and here he rode across, hardly wetting the belly of
  the gelding. Then up the far slope he was lost at once in a host of trees.
  They cut him off from his landmark, the white cliff, but he kept on with a
  feel for the right direction, until he came to a sudden clearing, and in the
  clearing was a cabin. It was apparently just a one-room shanty with a shed
  leaning against it from the rear. No doubt the shed was for the trapper's
  horse.</p>

  <p>He had no time for further thought. In the open door of the cabin appeared
  a man so huge that he had to bend his head to look out, and Andrew's heart
  fell. It was not the slender, rawboned youth of whom Uncle Jasper had told
  him, but a hulking giant. And then he remembered that twenty years had passed
  since Uncle Jasper rode that way, and in twenty years the gaunt body might
  have filled out, the shock of bright-red hair of which Jasper spoke might
  well have been the original of the red flood which now covered the face and
  throat of the big man.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" called the trapper. "Are you one of the boys on the trail? Well,
  I ain't seen anything. Been about six others here already."</p>

  <p>The blood leaped in Andrew, and then ran coldly back to his heart. Could
  they have outridden the gelding to such an extent as that?</p>

  <p>"From Tomo?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Tomo? No. They come down from Gunter City, up yonder, and Twin
  Falls."</p>

  <p>And Andrew understood. Well indeed had Hal Dozier fulfilled his threat of
  rousing the mountains against this quarry. He glanced westward. It was yet an
  hour lacking of sundown, but since mid-morning Dozier had been able to send
  his messages so far and so wide. Andrew set his teeth. What did cunning of
  head and speed of horse count against the law when the law had electricity
  for its agent?</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andrew, slipping from his saddle, "if he hasn't been by this
  way I may as well stay over for the night. If they've hunted the woods around
  here all day, no use in me doing it by night. Can you put me up?"</p>

  <p>"Can I put you up? I'll tell a man. Glad to have you, stranger. Gimme your
  hoss. I'll take care of him. Looks like he was kind of ganted up, don't it?
  Well, I'll give him a feed of oats that'll thicken his ribs."</p>

  <p>Still talking, he led the gelding into his shed. Andrew followed, took off
  the saddle, and, having led the chestnut out and down to the creek for a
  drink, he returned and tied him to a manger which the trapper had filled with
  a liberal supply of hay, to say nothing of a feed box stuffed with oats.</p>

  <p>A man who was kind to a horse could not be treacherous to a man, Andrew
  decided.</p>

  <p>"You're Hank Rainer, aren't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's me. And you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm the unwelcome guest, I'm afraid," said Andrew. "I'm the nephew of
  Jasper Lanning. I guess you'll be remembering him?"</p>

  <p>"I'll forget my right hand sooner," said the big, red man calmly. But he
  kept on looking steadily at Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andrew, encouraged and at the same time repulsed by this calm
  silence, "my name is one you've heard. I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other broke in hastily. "You are Jasper Lanning's nephew. That's all I
  know. What's a name to me? I don't want to know names!"</p>

  <p>It puzzled Andrew, but the big man ran on smoothly enough: "Lanning ain't
  a popular name around here, you see? Suppose somebody was to come around and
  say, 'Seen Lanning?' What could I say, if you was here? 'I've got a Lanning
  here. I dunno but he's the one you want.' But suppose I don't know anything
  except you're Jasper's nephew? Maybe you're related on the mother's side.
  Eh?" He winked at Andrew. "You come along and don't talk too much about
  names."</p>

  <p>He led the way into the house and picked up one of the posters, which lay
  on the floor.</p>

  <p>"They've sent those through the mountains already?" asked Andrew
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Sure! These come down from Twin Falls. Now, a gent with special fine eyes
  might find that you looked like the gent on this poster. But my eyes are
  terrible bad mostly. Besides, I need to quicken up that fire."</p>

  <p>He crumpled the poster and inserted it beneath the lid of his iron stove.
  There was a rush and faint roar of the flame up the chimney as the cardboard
  burned. "And now," said Hank Rainer, turning with a broad smile, "I guess
  they ain't any reason why I should recognize you. You're just a plain
  stranger comin' along and you stop over here for the night. That all?"</p>

  <p>Andrew had followed this involved reasoning with a rather bewildered mind,
  but he smiled faintly in return. He was bothered, in a way, by the extreme
  mental caution of this fellow. It was as if the keen-eyed trapper were more
  interested in his own foolish little subterfuge than in preserving Andrew.
  "Now, tell me, how is Jasper?"</p>

  <p>"I've got to tell you one thing first. Dozier has raised the mountains,
  and I could never cross 'em now."</p>

  <p>"Going to turn back into the plains?"</p>

  <p>"No. The ranges are wide enough, but they're a prison just the same. I've
  got to get out of 'em now or stay a prisoner the rest of my life, only to be
  trailed down in the end. No, I want to stay right here in your cabin until
  the men are quieted down again and think I've slipped away from 'em. Then
  I'll sneak over the summit and get away unnoticed."</p>

  <p>"Man, man! Stay here? Why, they'll find you right off. I wonder you got
  the nerve to sit there now with maybe ten men trailin' you to this cabin. But
  that's up to you."</p>

  <p>There was a certain careless calm about this that shook Andrew to his
  center again. But he countered: "No, they won't look specially in houses.
  Because they won't figure that any man would toss up that reward. Five
  thousand is a pile of money."</p>

  <p>"It sure is," agreed the other. He parted his red beard and looked up to
  the ceiling. "Five thousand is a considerable pile, all in hard cash. But
  mostly they hunt for this Andrew Lanning a dozen at a time. Well, you divide
  five thousand by ten, and you've got only five hundred left. That ain't
  enough to tempt a man to give up Lanning&mdash;so bad as all that."</p>

  <p>"Ah," smiled Andrew, "but you don't understand what a stake you could make
  out of me. If you were to give information about me being here, and you
  brought a posse to get me, you'd come in for at least half of the reward.
  Besides, the five thousand isn't all. There's at least one rich gent that'll
  contribute maybe that much more. And you'd get a good half of that. You see,
  Hal Dozier knows all that, and he knows there's hardly a man in the mountains
  who would be able to keep away from selling me. So that's why he won't search
  the houses."</p>

  <p>"Not you," corrected the trapper sharply. "Andy Lanning is the man Dozier
  wants."</p>

  <p>"Well, Andrew Lanning, then," smiled the guest. "It was just a slip of the
  tongue."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes slips like that break a man's neck," observed the trapper, and
  he fell into a gloomy meditation.</p>

  <p>And after that they talked of other things, until supper was cooked and
  eaten and the tin dishes washed and put away. Then they lay in their bunks
  and watched the last color in the west through the open door.</p>

  <p>If a member of a posse had come to the door, the first thing his eyes fell
  upon would have been Andrew Lanning lying on the floor on one side of the
  room and the red-bearded man on the other. But, though his host suggested
  this, Andrew refused to move his blankets. And he was right. The hunters were
  roving the open, and even Hal Dozier was at fault.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Andrew, "he doesn't dream that I could have a friend so
  far from home. Not five thousand dollars' worth of friend, anyway."</p>

  <p>And the trapper grunted heavily.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a truth long after wondered at, when the story of
  Andrew Lanning was told and retold, that he had lain in perfect security
  within a six-hour ride from Tomo, while Hal Dozier himself combed the
  mountains and hundreds more were out hunting fame and fortune. To be sure,
  when a stranger approached, Andrew always withdrew into the horse shed; but,
  beyond keeping up a steady watch during the day, he had little to do and
  little to fear.</p>

  <p>Indeed, at night he made no pretense toward concealment, but slept quite
  openly on the floor on the bed of hay and blankets, just as Hank Rainer slept
  on the farther side of the room. And the great size of the reward was the
  very thing that kept him safe. For when men passed the cabin, as they often
  did, they were riding hard to get away from Tomo and into the higher
  mountains, where the outlaw might be, or else they were coming back to rest
  up, and their destination in such a case was always Tomo. The cabin of the
  trapper was just near enough to the town to escape being used as a shelter
  for the night by stray travelers. If they got that close, they went on to the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>But often they paused long enough to pass a word with Hank, and Andrew,
  from his place behind the door of the horse shed, could hear it all. He could
  even look through a crack and see the faces of the strangers. They told how
  Tomo was wrought to a pitch of frenzied interest by this manhunt. Well-to-do
  citizens, feeling that the outlaw had insulted the town by so boldly
  venturing into it, had raised a considerable contribution toward the reward.
  Other prominent miners and cattlemen of the district had come forward with
  similar offers, and every day the price on the head of Andrew mounted to a
  more tempting figure.</p>

  <p>It was a careless time for Andrew. After that escape from Tomo he was not
  apt to be perturbed by his present situation, but the suspense seemed to
  weigh more and more heavily upon the trapper. Hank Rainer was so troubled,
  indeed, that Andrew sometimes surprised a half-guilty, half-sly expression in
  the eyes of his host. He decided that Hank was anxious for the day to come
  when Andrew would ride off and take his perilous company elsewhere. He even
  broached the subject to Hank, but the mountaineer flushed and discarded the
  suggestion with a wave of his hand. "But if a gang of 'em should ever hunt me
  down, even in your cabin, Hank," said Andrew one day&mdash;it was the third
  day of his stay &mdash;"I'll never forget what you've done for me, and one of
  these days I'll see that Uncle Jasper finds out about it."</p>

  <p>The little, pale-blue eyes of the trapper went swiftly to and fro, as if
  he sought escape from this embarrassing gratitude.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "I've been thinkin' that the man that gets you, Andy,
  won't be so sure with his money, after all. He'll have your Uncle Jasper on
  his trail pronto, and Jasper used to be a killer with a gun in the old
  days."</p>

  <p>"No more," smiled Andrew. "He's still steady as a rock, but he hasn't the
  speed any more. He's over seventy, you see. His joints sort of creak when he
  tries to move with a snap."</p>

  <p>"Ah," muttered the trapper, and again, as he started through the open
  door, "Ah!"</p>

  <p>Then he added: "Well, son, you don't need Jasper. If half what they say is
  true, you're a handy lad with the guns. I suppose Jasper showed you his
  tricks?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and we worked out some new ones together. Uncle Jasper raised me
  with a gun in my hand, you might say."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Hank Rainer.</p>

  <p>When they were sitting at the door in the semidusk, he reverted to the
  idea. "You been seein' that squirrel that's been runnin' across the
  clearin'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see you work your gun, Andy. It was a sight to talk about to
  watch Jasper, and I'm thinkin' you could go him one better. S'pose you stand
  up there in the door with your back to the clearin'. The next time that
  squirrel comes scootin' across I'll say, 'Now!' and you try to turn and get
  your gun on him before he's out of sight. Will you try that?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose some one hears it?" "Oh, they're used to me pluggin' away for fun
  over here. Besides, they ain't anybody lives in hearin'."</p>

  <p>And Andrew, falling into the spirit of the contest, stood up in the door,
  and the old tingle of nerves, which never failed to come over him in the
  crisis, was thrilling through his body again. Then Hank barked the word,
  "Now!" and Andrew whirled on his heel. The word had served to alarm the
  squirrel as well. As he heard it, he twisted about like the snapping lash of
  a whip and darted back for cover, three yards away. He covered that distance
  like a little gray streak in the shadow, but before he reached it the gun
  spoke, and the forty-five-caliber slug struck him in the middle and tore him
  in two. Andrew, hearing a sharp crackling, looked down at his host and
  observed that the trapper had bitten clean through the stem of his
  corncob.</p>

  <p>"That," said the red man huskily, "is some shootin'."</p>

  <p>But he did not look up, and he did not smile. And it troubled Andrew to
  hear this rather grudging praise.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, three days had put the gelding in very fair condition. He
  was enough mustang to recuperate swiftly, and that morning he had tried with
  hungry eagerness to kick the head from Andrew's shoulders. This had decided
  the outlaw. Besides, in the last day there had been fewer and fewer riders up
  and down the ravine, and apparently the hunt for Andrew Lanning had journeyed
  to another part of the mountains. It seemed an excellent time to begin his
  journey again, and he told the trapper his decision to start on at dusk the
  next day.</p>

  <p>The announcement brought with it a long and thoughtful pause.</p>

  <p>"I wisht I could send you on your way with somethin' worthwhile," said
  Hank Rainer at length. "But I ain't rich. I've lived plain and worked hard,
  but I ain't rich. So what I can give you, Andy, won't be much."</p>

  <p>Andrew protested that the hospitality had been more than a generous gift,
  but Hank Rainer, looking straight out the door, continued: "Well, I'm goin'
  down the road to get you my little gift, Andy. Be back in an hour maybe."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have you here to keep me from being lonely," said Andrew.
  "I've money enough to buy what I want, but money will never buy me the talk
  of an honest man, Hank."</p>

  <p>The other started. "Honest enough, maybe," he said bitterly. "But honesty
  don't get you bread or bacon, not in this world!"</p>

  <p>And presently he stamped into the shed, saddled his pony, and after a
  moment was scattering the pebbles on the way down the ravine. The dark and
  silence gathered over Andrew Lanning. He had little warmth of feeling for
  Hank Rainer, to be sure, but the hush of the cabin he looked forward to many
  a long evening and many a long day in a silence like this, with no man near
  him. For the man who rides outside the law rides alone.</p>

  <p>He could have embraced the big man, therefore, when Hank finally came
  back, and Andrew could hear the pony panting in the shed, a sure sign that it
  had been ridden hard.</p>

  <p>"It ain't much," said Hank, "but it's yours, and I hope you get a chance
  to use it in a pinch." And he dumped down a case of .45 cartridges.</p>

  <p>After all, there could have been no gift more to the point, but it gave
  Andrew a little chill of distaste, this reminder of the life that lay ahead
  of him. And in spite of himself he could not break the silence that began to
  settle over the cabin again. Finally Hank announced that it was bedtime for
  him, and, preparing himself by the simple expedient of kicking off his boots
  and then drawing off his trousers, he slipped into his blankets, twisted them
  tightly around his broad shoulders with a single turn of his body, and was
  instantly snoring. Andrew followed that example more slowly. Not since he
  left Martindale, however, had he slept soundly. Take a tame dog into the
  wilderness and he learns to sleep like a wolf quickly enough; and Andrew,
  with mind and nerve constantly set for action like a cocked revolver, had
  learned to sleep like a wild thing in turn. And accordingly, when he wakened
  in the middle of the night, he was alert on the instant. He had a singular
  feeling that someone had been looking at him while he slept.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

  <p class="first">First of all, naturally, he looked at the door. It was now a
  bright rectangle filled with moonlight and quite empty. There must have been
  a sound, and he glanced over to the trapper for an explanation. But Hank
  Rainer lay twisted closely in his blankets.</p>

  <p>Andrew raised upon one elbow and thought. It troubled him&mdash;the
  insistent feeling of the eyes which had been upon him. They had burned their
  way into his dreams with a bright insistence.</p>

  <p>He looked again, and, having formed the habit of photographing things with
  one glance, he compared what he saw now with what he had last seen when he
  fell asleep. It tallied in every detail except one. The trousers which had
  lain on the floor beside Hank's bed were no longer there.</p>

  <p>It was a little thing, of course, but Andrew closed his eyes to make sure.
  Yes, he could even remember the gesture with which the trapper had tossed
  down the trousers to the floor. Andrew sat up in bed noiselessly. He slipped
  to the door and flashed one glance up and down. Below him the hillside was
  bright beneath the moon. The far side of the ravine was doubly black in
  shadow. But nothing lived, nothing moved. And then again he felt the eye upon
  him. He whirled. "Hank!" he called softly. And he saw the slightest start as
  he spoke. "Hank!" he repeated in the same tone, and the trapper stretched his
  arms, yawned heavily, and turned. "Well, lad?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>But Andrew knew that he had been heard the first time, and he felt that
  this pretended slow awakening was too elaborate to be true. He went back to
  his own bed and began to dress rapidly. In the meantime the trapper was
  staring stupidly at him and asking what was wrong.</p>

  <p>"Something mighty queer," said Andrew. "Must have been a coyote in here
  that sneaked off with your trousers, unless you have 'em on."</p>

  <p>Just a touch of pause, then the other replied through a yawn: "Sure, I got
  'em on. Had to get up in the night, and I was too plumb sleepy to take 'em
  off again when I come back."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Andrew, "I see."</p>

  <p>He stepped to the door into the horse shed and paused; there was no sound.
  He opened the door and stepped in quickly. Both horses were on the ground,
  asleep, but he took the gelding by the nose, to muffle a grunt as he rose,
  and brought him to his feet. Then, still softly and swiftly, he lifted the
  saddle from its peg and put it on its back. One long draw made the cinches
  taut. He fastened the straps, and then went to the little window behind the
  horse, through which had come the vague and glimmering light by which he did
  the saddling. Now he scanned the trees on the edge of the clearing with
  painful anxiety. Once he thought that he heard a voice, but it was only the
  moan of one branch against another as the wind bent some tree. He stepped
  back from the window and rubbed his knuckles across his forehead, obviously
  puzzled. It might be that, after all, he was wrong. So he turned back once
  more toward the main room of the cabin to make sure. Instead of opening the
  door softly, as a suspicious man will, he cast it open with a sudden push of
  his foot; the hulk of Hank Rainer turned at the opposite door, and the big
  man staggered as though he had been struck.</p>

  <p>It might have been caused by his swift right-about face, throwing him off
  his balance, but it was more probably the shock that came from facing a
  revolver in the hand of Andrew. The gun was at his hip. It had come into his
  hand with a nervous flip of the fingers as rapid as the gesture of the card
  expert.</p>

  <p>"Come back," said Andrew. "Talk soft, step soft. Now, Hank, what made you
  do it?"</p>

  <p>The red hair of the other was burning faintly in the moonlight, and it
  went out as he stepped from the door into the middle of the room, his finger
  tips brushing the ceiling above him. And Andrew, peering through that shadow,
  saw two little, bright eyes, like the eyes of a beast, twinkling out at him
  from the mass of hair.</p>

  <p>"When you went after the shells for me, Hank," he stated, "you gave the
  word that I was here. Then you told the gent that took the message to spread
  it around&mdash;to get it to Hal Dozier, if possible&mdash;to have the men
  come back here. You'd go out, when I was sound asleep, and tell them when
  they could rush me. Is that straight?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Speak out! I feel like shovin' this gun down your throat, Hank, but I
  won't if you speak out and tell me the truth."</p>

  <p>Whatever other failings might be his, there was no great cowardice in Hank
  Rainer. His arms remained above his head and his little eyes burned. That was
  all.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andrew, "I think you've got me, Hank. I suppose I ought to
  send you to death before me, but, to tell you the straight of it, I'm not
  going to, because I'm sort of sick. Sick, you understand? Tell me one
  thing&mdash; are the boys here yet? Are they scattered around the edge of the
  clearing, or are they on the way? Hank, was it worth five thousand to
  double-cross a gent that's your guest&mdash;a fellow that's busted bread with
  you, bunked in the same room with you? And even when they've drilled me
  clean, and you've got the reward, don't you know that you'll be a skunk among
  real men from this time on? Did you figure on that when you sold me?"</p>

  <p>The hands of Hank Rainer fell suddenly, but now lower than his beard. The
  fingers thrust at his throat&mdash;he seemed to be tearing his own flesh.</p>

  <p>"Pull the trigger, Andy," he said. "Go on. I ain't fit to live."</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it, Hank?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted a new set of traps, Andy; that was what I wanted. I'd been
  figurin' and schemin' all autumn how to get my traps before the winter comes
  on. My own wasn't any good. Then I seen that fur coat of yours. It set me
  thinking about what I could do if I had some honest-to-goodness traps with
  springs in 'em that would hold&mdash;and&mdash;I stood it as long as I
  could."</p>

  <p>While he spoke, Andrew looked past him, through the door. All the world
  was silver beyond. The snow had been falling, and on the first great peak
  there was a glint of the white, very pure and chill against the sky. The very
  air was keen and sweet. Ah, it was a world to live in, and he was not ready
  to die!</p>

  <p>He looked back to Hank Rainer. "Hank, my time was sure to come sooner or
  later, but I'm not ready to die. I'm&mdash;I'm too young, Hank. Well, good-
  by!"</p>

  <p>He found gigantic arms spreading before him.</p>

  <p>"Andy," insisted the big man, "it ain't too late for me to double-cross
  'em. Let me go out first and you come straight behind me. They won't fire;
  they'll think I've got a new plan for givin' you up. When we get to the
  circle of 'em, because they're all round the cabin, we'll drive at 'em
  together. Come on!"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. Is Hal Dozier out there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Oh, go on and curse me, Andy. I'm cursin' myself!"</p>

  <p>"If he's there, it's no use. But there's no use two dyin' when I try to
  get through. Only one thing, Hank; if you want to keep your self-respect
  don't take the reward money."</p>

  <p>"I'll see it burn first, and I'm goin' with you, Andy!"</p>

  <p>"You stay where you are; this is my party. Before the finish of the dance
  I'm going to see if some of those sneaks out yonder, lyin' so snug, won't
  like to step right out and do a caper with me!"</p>

  <p>And before the trapper could make a protest he had drawn back into the
  horse shed.</p>

  <p>There he led the chestnut to the door, and, looking through the crack, he
  scanned the surface of the ground. It was sadly broken and chopped with
  rocks, but the gelding might make headway fast enough. It was a short
  distance to the trees&mdash;twenty-five to forty yards, perhaps. And if he
  burst out of that shed on the back of the horse, spurred to full speed, he
  might take the watchers, who perhaps expected a signal from the trapper
  before they acted, quite unawares, and he would be among the sheltering
  shadows of the forest while the posse was getting up its guns.</p>

  <p>There was an equally good chance that he would ride straight into a nest
  of the waiting men, and, even if he reached the forest, he would be riddled
  with bullets.</p>

  <p>Now, all these thoughts and all this weighing of the chances occupied
  perhaps half a second, while Andrew stood looking through the crack. Then he
  swung into the saddle, leaning far over to the side so that he would have
  clearance under the doorway, kicked open the swinging door, and sent the
  chestnut leaping into the night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>

  <p class="first">If only the night had been dark, if the gelding had had a
  fair start; but the moon was bright, and in the thin mountain air it made a
  radiance almost as keen as day and just sufficiently treacherous to delude a
  horse, which had been sent unexpectedly out among rocks by a cruel pair of
  spurs. At the end of the first leap the gelding stumbled to his knees with a
  crash and snort among the stones. The shock hurled Andrew forward, but he
  clung with spurs and hand, and as he twisted back into the saddle the gelding
  rose valiantly and lurched ahead again.</p>

  <p>Yet that double sound might have roused an army, and for the keen-eared
  watchers around the clearing it was more than an ample warning. There was a
  crash of musketry so instant and so close together that it was like a volley
  delivered by a line of soldiers at command. Bullets sang shrill and small
  around Andrew, but that first discharge had been a burst of snap-shooting,
  and by moonlight it takes a rare man indeed to make an accurate snapshot. The
  first discharge left both Andrew and the horse untouched, and for the moment
  the wild hope of unexpected success was raised in his heart. And he had noted
  one all- important fact&mdash;the flashes, widely scattered as they were, did
  not extend across the exact course of his flight toward the trees. Therefore,
  none of the posse would have a point-blank shot at him. For those in the rear
  and on the sides the weaving course of the gelding, running like a deer and
  swerving agilely among the rocks, as if to make up for his first blunder,
  offered the most difficult of all targets.</p>

  <p>All this in only the space of a breath, yet the ground was already crossed
  and the trees were before him when Andrew saw a ray of moonlight flash on the
  long barrel of rifle to his right, and he knew that one man at least was
  taking a deliberate aim. He had his revolver on the fellow in the instant,
  and yet he held his fire. God willing, he would come back to Anne Withero
  with no more stains on his hands!</p>

  <p>And that noble, boyish impulse killed the chestnut, for a moment later a
  stream of fire spouted out, long and thin, from the muzzle of the rifle, and
  the gelding struck at the end of a stride, like a ship going down in the sea;
  his limbs seemed to turn to tallow under him, and he crumpled on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>The fall flung Andrew clean out of the saddle; he landed on his knees and
  leaped for the woods, but now there was a steady roar of guns behind him. He
  was struck heavily behind the left shoulder, staggered. Something gashed his
  neck like the edge of a red-hot knife, his whole left side was numb.</p>

  <p>And then the merciful dark of the trees closed around him.</p>

  <p>For fifty yards he raced through an opening in the trees, while a yelling
  like wild Indians rose behind him; then he leaped into cover and waited. One
  thing favored him still. They had not brought horses, or at least they had
  left their mounts at some distance, for fear of the chance noises they might
  make when the cabin was stalked. And now, looking down the lane among the
  trees, he saw men surge into it.</p>

  <p>All his left side was covered with a hot bath, but, balancing his revolver
  in his right hand, he felt a queer touch of joy and pride at finding his
  nerve still unshaken. He raised the weapon, covered their bodies, and then
  something like an invisible hand forced down the muzzle of his gun. He could
  not shoot to kill!</p>

  <p>He did what was perhaps better; he fired at that mass of legs, and even a
  child could not have failed to strike the target. Once, twice, and again;
  then the crowd melted to either side of the path, and there was a shrieking
  and forms twisting and writhing on the ground.</p>

  <p>Some one was shouting orders from the side; he was ordering them to the
  right and left to surround the fugitive; he was calling out that Lanning was
  hit. At least, they would go with caution down his trail after that first
  check. He left his sheltering tree and ran again down the ravine.</p>

  <p>By this time the first shock of the wounds and the numbness were leaving
  him, but the pain was terrible. Yet he knew that he was not fatally injured
  if he could stop that mortal drain of his wounds.</p>

  <p>He heard the pursuit in the distance more and more. Every now and then
  there was a spasmodic outburst of shooting, and Andrew grinned in spite of
  his pain. They were closing around the place where they thought he was making
  his last stand, shooting at shadows which might be the man they wanted.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped, tore off his shirt, and ripped it with his right hand and
  his teeth into strips. He tied one around his neck, knotting it until he
  could only draw his breath with difficulty. Several more strips he tied
  together, and then wound the long bandage around his shoulder and pulled. The
  pain brought him close to a swoon, but when his senses cleared he found that
  the flow from his wounds had eased.</p>

  <p>But not entirely. There was still some of that deadly trickling down his
  side, and, with the chill of the night biting into him, he knew that it was
  life or death to him if he could reach some friendly house within the next
  two miles. There was only one dwelling straight before him, and that was the
  house of the owner of the bay mare. They would doubtless turn him over to the
  posse instantly. But there was one chance in a hundred that they would not
  break the immemorial rule of mountain hospitality. For Andrew there was no
  hope except that tenuous one.</p>

  <p>The rest of that walk became a nightmare. He was not sure whether he heard
  the yell of rage and disappointment behind him as the posse discovered that
  the bird had flown or whether the sound existed only in his own ringing head.
  But one thing was certain&mdash;they would not trail Andrew Lanning
  recklessly in the night, not even with the moon to help them.</p>

  <p>So he plodded steadily on. If it had not been for that ceaseless drip he
  would have taken the long chance and broken for the mountains above him,
  trying through many a long day ahead to cure the wounds and in some manner
  sustain his life. But the drain continued. It was hardly more than drop by
  drop, but all the time a telltale weakness was growing in his legs. In spite
  of the agony he was sleepy, and he would have liked to drop on the first mat
  of leaves that he found.</p>

  <p>That crazy temptation he brushed away, and went on until surely, like a
  star of hope, he saw the light winking feebly through the trees, and then
  came out on the cabin.</p>

  <p>He remembered afterward that even in his dazed condition he was
  disappointed because of the neat, crisp, appearance of the house. There must
  be women there, and women meant screams, horror, betrayal.</p>

  <p>But there was no other hope for him now. Twice, as he crossed the clearing
  before he reached the door of the cabin, his foot struck a rock and he
  pitched weakly forward, with only the crumbling strength of his right arm to
  keep him from striking on his face. Then there was a furious clamor and a
  huge dog rushed at him.</p>

  <p>He heeded it only with a glance from the corner of his eye. And then, his
  dull brain clearing, he realized that the dog no longer howled at him or
  showed his teeth, but was walking beside him, licking his hand and whining
  with sympathy. He dropped again, and this time he could never have regained
  his feet had not his right arm flopped helplessly across the back of the big
  dog, and the beast cowered and growled, but it did not attempt to slide from
  under his weight.</p>

  <p>He managed to get erect again, but when he reached the low flight of steps
  to the front door he was reeling drunkenly from side to side. He fumbled for
  the knob, and it turned with a grating sound.</p>

  <p>"Hold on! Keep out!" shrilled a voice inside. "We got guns here. Keep out,
  you dirty bum!"</p>

  <p>The door fell open, and he found himself confronted by what seemed to him
  a dazzling torrent of light and a host of human faces. He drew himself up
  beside the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Andrew, "I am not a bum. I am worth five thousand
  dollars to the man who turns me over, dead or alive, to the sheriff. My name
  is Andrew Lanning."</p>

  <p>At that the faces became a terrible rushing and circling flare, and the
  lights went out with equal suddenness. He was left in total darkness, falling
  through space; but, at his last moment of consciousness, he felt arms going
  about him, arms through which his bulk kept slipping down, and below him was
  a black abyss.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23"></a>CHAPTER 23</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a very old man who held, or tried to hold, Andrew
  from falling to the floor. His shoulders shook under the burden of the
  outlaw, and the burden, indeed, would have slumped brutally to the floor, had
  not the small ten-year- old boy, whom Andrew had seen on the bay mare, come
  running in under the arms of the old man. With his meager strength he
  assisted, and the two managed to lower the body gently.</p>

  <p>The boy was frightened. He was white at the sight of the wounds, and the
  freckles stood out in copper patches from his pallor.</p>

  <p>Now he clung to the old man.</p>

  <p>"Granddad, it's the gent that tried to buy Sally!"</p>

  <p>The old man had produced a murderous jackknife with a blade that had been
  ground away to the disappearing point by years of steady grinding.</p>

  <p>"Get some wood in the stove," he commanded. "Fire her up, quick. Put on
  some water. Easy, lad!"</p>

  <p>The room became a place of turmoil with the clatter of the stove lids
  being raised, the clangor of the kettle being filled and put in place. By the
  time the fire was roaring and the boy had turned, he found the bandages had
  been taken from the body of the stranger and his grandfather was studying the
  smeared naked torso with a sort of detached, philosophic interest. With the
  thumb and forefinger of his left hand he was pressing deeply into the left
  shoulder of Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Now, there's an arm for you, Jud," said the old man. "See them long,
  stringy muscles in the forearm? If you grow up and have muscles like them,
  you can call yourself a man. And you see the way his stomach caves in? Aye,
  that's a sign! And the way his ribs sticks out&mdash;and just feel them
  muscles on the point of his shoulder&mdash;Oh, Jud, he would of made a prime
  wrestler, this fine bird of ours!"</p>

  <p>"It's like touchin' somethin' dead, granddad," said the boy. "I don't dast
  to do it!"</p>

  <p>"Jud, they's some times when I just about want to give you up! Dead? He
  ain't nowheres near dead. Just bled a bit, that's all. Two as pretty little
  wounds as was ever drilled clean by a powerful rifle at short range. Dead?
  Why, inside two weeks he'll be fit as a fiddle, and inside a month he'll be
  his own self! Dead! Jud, you make me tired! Gimme that water."</p>

  <p>He went to work busily. Out of a sort of first-aid chest he took homemade
  bandages and, after cleansing the wounds, he began to dress them
  carefully.</p>

  <p>He talked with every movement.</p>

  <p>"So this here is the lion, is it?" nodded granddad. "This here is the
  ravenin', tearin', screechin' man-eater? Why, he looks mostly plain kid to
  me."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he's been shot, ain't he, granddad?" asked the child in a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"Well, boy, I'd say that the lion had been chawed up considerable&mdash;
  by dogs."</p>

  <p>He pointed. "See them holes? The big one in front? That means they sneaked
  up behind him and shot him while his back was turned."</p>

  <p>"He's wakin' up, granddad," said Jud, more frightened than before.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Andrew were indeed opening.</p>

  <p>He smiled up at them. "Uncle Jas," he said, "I don't like to fight. It
  makes me sick inside, to fight." He closed his eyes again.</p>

  <p>"Now, now, now!" murmured Pop. "This boy has a way with him. And he killed
  Bill Dozier, did he? Son, gimme the whisky."</p>

  <p>He poured a little down the throat of the wounded man, and Andrew frowned
  and opened his eyes again: He was conscious at last.</p>

  <p>"I think I've seen you before," he said calmly. "Are you one of the
  posse?"</p>

  <p>The old man stiffened a little. A spot of red glowed on his withered cheek
  and went out like a snuffed light.</p>

  <p>"Young feller," said the old man, "when I go huntin' I go alone. You write
  that down in red, and don't forget it. I ain't ever been a member of no
  posse. Look around and see yourself to home."</p>

  <p>Andrew raised his head a little and made out the neat room. It showed, as
  even his fading senses had perceived when he saw the house first, a touch of
  almost feminine care. The floor was scrubbed to whiteness, the very stove was
  burnished.</p>

  <p>"I remember," said Andrew faintly.</p>

  <p>"You did see me before," said the other, "when you rode into Tomo. I seen
  you and you seen me. We changed looks, so to speak. And now you've dropped in
  to call on me. I'm goin' to put you up in the attic. Gimme a hand to
  straighten him up, Jud."</p>

  <p>With Jud's help and the last remnant of Andrew's strength they managed to
  get him to his feet, and then he partly climbed, partly was pushed by Jud,
  and partly was dragged by the old man up a ladder to the loft. It was quite
  cool there, very dark, and the air came in through two windows.</p>

  <p>"Ain't very sociable to put a guest in the attic," said Pop, between his
  panting breaths. "But a public character like you, Lanning, will have a
  consid'able pile of callers askin' after you. Terrible jarrin' to the nerves
  when folks come in and call on a sick man. You lie here and rest easy."</p>

  <p>He went down the ladder and came back dragging a mattress. There, by the
  light of a lantern, he and Jud made Andrew as comfortable as possible.</p>

  <p>"You mean to keep me here?" asked the outlaw.</p>

  <p>"Long as you feel like restin'," answered the old man.</p>

  <p>"You can make about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop that fool talk about what I can make out of you. How come it you
  stayed so close to Tomo? Where was you lyin' low? In the hills?"</p>

  <p>"Not far away." "And they smelled you out?"</p>

  <p>"A man I thought was my friend&mdash;" Andrew clicked his teeth shut.</p>

  <p>"You was sold, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"H'm," was the other's comment. "Well, you forget about that and go to
  sleep. I got a few little attentions to pay to that posse. It'll be here
  r'arin' before tomorrer. Sleep tight, partner."</p>

  <p>He climbed down the ladder and looked around the room. Jud, his freckles
  still looking like spots of mud or rust, his eyes popping, stood silent.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," said the old man, with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"What, granddad?"</p>

  <p>"You're like a girl, Jud. Takes a sight to make you reasonable quiet. But
  look yonder. Them spots look tolerable like red paint, don't they? Well, we
  got to get 'em off."</p>

  <p>"I'll heat some more water," suggested Jud.</p>

  <p>"You do nothing of the kind. You get them two butcher knives out of the
  table drawer and we'll scrape off the wood, because you can't wash that stain
  out'n a floor." He looked suddenly at Jud with a glint in his eyes. "I know,
  because I've tried it."</p>

  <p>For several minutes they scraped hard at the floor until the last vestige
  of the fresh stains was gone. Then the old man went outside and, coming back
  with a handful of sand, rubbed it in carefully over the scraped places. When
  this was swept away the floor presented no suspicious traces.</p>

  <p>"But," he exclaimed suddenly, "I forgot. I plumb forgot. He's been leakin'
  all the way here, and when the sun comes up they'll foller him that easy by
  the sign. Jud, we're beat!"</p>

  <p>They dropped, as at a signal, into two opposite chairs, and sat staring
  gloomily at each other. The old man looked simply sad and weary, but the
  color came and went in the face of Jud. And then, like a light, an idea
  dawned in the face of the child. He got up from his chair, lighted a lantern,
  and went outside. His grandfather observed this without comment or
  suggestion, but, when Jud was gone, he observed to himself: "Jud takes after
  me. He's got thoughts. And them was things his ma and pa was never bothered
  with."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>CHAPTER 24</h2>

  <p class="first">The thought of Jud now took him up the back trail of Andrew
  Lanning. He leaned far over with the lantern, studying with intense interest
  every place where the wounds of the injured man might have left telltale
  stains on the rocks or the grass. When he had apparently satisfied himself of
  this, he turned and ran at full speed back to the house and went up the
  ladder to Andrew. There he took the boots&mdash;they were terribly stained,
  he saw&mdash;and drew them on.</p>

  <p>The loose boots and the unaccustomed weights tangled his feet sadly, as he
  went on down the ladder, but he said not a word to his grandfather, who was
  far too dignified to make a comment on the borrowed footgear.</p>

  <p>Again outside with his lantern, the boy took out his pocket-knife and felt
  the small blade. It was of a razor keenness. Then he went through the yard
  behind the house to the big henhouse, where the chickens sat perched in dense
  rows. He raised his lantern; at once scores of tiny, bright eyes flashed back
  at him.</p>

  <p>But Jud, with a twisted face of determination, kept on with his survey
  until he saw the red comb and the arched tail plumes of a large Plymouth Rock
  rooster.</p>

  <p>It was a familiar sight to Jud. Of all the chickens on the place this was
  his peculiar property. And now he had determined to sacrifice this dearest of
  pets.</p>

  <p>The old rooster was so accustomed to his master, indeed, that he allowed
  himself to be taken from the perch without a single squawk, and the boy took
  his captive beyond the pen. Once, when the big rooster canted his head and
  looked into his face, the boy had to wink away the tears; but he thought of
  the man so near death in the attic, he felt the clumsy boots on his feet, and
  his heart grew strong again.</p>

  <p>He went around to the front of the house and by the steps he fastened on
  the long neck of his prisoner a grasp strong enough to keep him silent for a
  moment. Then he cut the rooster's breast deeply, shuddering as he felt the
  knife take hold.</p>

  <p>Something trickled warmly over his hands. Dropping his knife in his
  pocket, Jud started, walked with steps as long as he could make them. He
  went, with the spurs chinking to keep time for each stride, straight toward a
  cliff some hundreds of yards from the house. The blood ran freely. The old
  rooster, feeling himself sicken, sank weakly against the breast of the boy,
  and Jud thought that his heart would break. He reached the sharp edge of the
  cliff and heard the rush of the little river far below him. At the same time
  his captive gave one final flutter of the wings, one feeble crow, and was
  dead.</p>

  <p>Jud waited until the tears had cleared from his eyes. Then he took off the
  boots, and, in bare feet that would leave no trace on the rocks, he skirted
  swiftly back to the house, put the dead body back in the chicken yard, and
  returned to his grandfather.</p>

  <p>There was one great satisfaction for him that evening, one reward for the
  great sacrifice, and it came immediately. While the old man stood trembling
  before him, Jud told his story.</p>

  <p>It was a rich feast indeed to see the relief, the astonishment, the pride
  come in swift turns upon that grim old face.</p>

  <p>And yet in the end Pop was able to muster a fairly good imitation of a
  frown.</p>

  <p>"And here you come back with a shirt and a pair of trousers plumb spoiled
  by all your gallivantin'," he said, "not speakin' of a perfectly good chicken
  killed. Ain't you never goin' to get grown up, Jud?"</p>

  <p>"He was mine, the chicken I killed," said Jud, choking.</p>

  <p>It brought a pause upon the talk. The other was forced to wink both eyes
  at once and sigh.</p>

  <p>"The big speckled feller?" he asked more gently.</p>

  <p>"The Plymouth Rock," said Jud fiercely. "He wasn't no speckled feller! He
  was the finest rooster and the gamest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way," said the old man. "You got your grandma's tongue
  when it comes to arguin' fine points. Now go and skin out of them clothes and
  come back and see that you've got all that&mdash;that stuff of'n your face
  and hands."</p>

  <p>Jud obeyed, and presently reappeared in a ragged outfit, his face and
  hands red from scrubbing.</p>

  <p>"I guess maybe it's all right," declared the old man. "Only, they's risks
  in it. Know what's apt to happen if they was to find that you'd helped to get
  a outlaw off free?"</p>

  <p>"What would it be?" asked the boy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothin' much. Maybe they'd try you and maybe they wouldn't. Anyways,
  they'd sure wind up by hangin' you by the neck till you was as dead as the
  speckled rooster."</p>

  <p>"The Plymouth Rock," insisted Jud hotly.</p>

  <p>"All right, I don't argue none. But you just done a dangerous thing, Jud.
  And there'll be a consid'able pile of men here in the mornin', most like, to
  ask you how and why."</p>

  <p>He was astonished to hear Jud break into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Hush up," said Pop. "You'll be wakin' him up with all that noise.
  Besides, what d'you mean by laughin' at the law?" "Why, granddad," said Jud,
  "don't I know you wouldn't never let no posse take me from you? Don't I know
  maybe you'd clean 'em all up?"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" said Pop, and flushed with delight. "You was always a fool kid,
  Jud. Now you run along to bed."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25"></a>CHAPTER 25</h2>

  <p class="first">In Hal Dozier there was a belief that the end justified the
  means. When Hank Rainer sent word to Tomo that the outlaw was in his cabin,
  and, if the posse would gather, he, Hank, would come out of his cabin that
  night and let the posse rush the sleeping man who remained, Hal Dozier was
  willing and eager to take advantage of the opportunity. A man of action by
  nature and inclination, Dozier had built a great repute as a hunter of
  criminals, and he had been known to take single-handed chances against the
  most desperate; but when it was possible Hal Dozier played a safe game.
  Though the people of the mountain desert considered him invincible, because
  he had run down some dozen notorious fighters, Hal himself felt that this
  simply increased the chances that the thirteenth man, by luck or by cunning,
  would strike him down.</p>

  <p>Therefore he played safe always. On this occasion he made surety doubly
  sure. He could have taken two or three known men, and they would have been
  ample to do the work. Instead, he picked out half a dozen. For just as Henry
  Allister had recognized that indescribable element of danger in the new
  outlaw, so the manhunter himself had felt it. Hal Dozier determined that he
  would not tempt Providence. He had his commission as a deputy marshal, and as
  such he swore in his men and started for the cabin of Hank Rainer.</p>

  <p>When the news had spread, others came to join him, and he could not
  refuse. Before the cavalcade entered the mouth of the canyon he had some
  thirty men about him. They were all good men, but in a fight, particularly a
  fight at night, Hal Dozier knew that numbers to excess are apt to simply clog
  the working parts of the machine. All that he feared came to pass. There was
  one breathless moment of joy when the horse of Andrew was shot down and the
  fugitive himself staggered under the fire of the posse. At that moment Hal
  had poised his rifle for a shot that would end this long trail, but at that
  moment a yelling member of his own group had come between him and his target,
  and the chance was gone. When he leaped to one side to make the shot, Andrew
  was already among the trees.</p>

  <p>Afterward he had sent his men in a circle to close in on the spot from
  which the outlaw made his stand, but they had closed on empty shadows&mdash;
  the fugitive had escaped, leaving a trail of blood. However, it was hardly
  safe to take that trail in the night, and practically impossible until the
  sunlight came to follow the sign. So Hal Dozier had the three wounded men
  taken back to the cabin of Hank Rainer.</p>

  <p>The stove was piled with wood until the top was white hot, and then the
  posse sat about on the floor, crowding the room and waiting for the dawn. The
  three wounded men were made as comfortable as possible. One had been shot
  through the hip, a terrible wound that would probably stiffen his leg for
  life; another had gone down with a wound along the shin bone which kept him
  in a constant torture. The third man was hit cleanly through the thigh, and,
  though he had bled profusely for some time, he was now only weak, and in a
  few weeks he would be perfectly sound again. The hard breathing of the three
  was the only sound in that dim room during the rest of the night. The story
  of Hank Rainer had been told in half a dozen words. Lanning had suspected
  him, stuck him up at the point of a gun, and then-refused to kill him, in
  spite of the fact that he knew he was betrayed. After his explanation Hank
  withdrew to the darkest corner of the room and was silent. From time to time
  looks went toward that corner, and one thought was in every mind. This
  fellow, who had offered to take money for a guest, was damned for life and
  branded. Thereafter no one would trust him, no one would change words with
  him; he was an outcast, a social leper. And Hank Rainer knew it as well as
  any man.</p>

  <p>A cloud of tobacco smoke became dense in the room, and a halo surrounded
  the lantern on the wall. Then one by one men got up and muttered something
  about being done with the party, or having to be at work in the morning, and
  stamped out of the room and went down the ravine to the place where the
  horses had been tethered. The first thrill of excitement was gone. Moreover,
  it was no particular pleasure to close in on a wounded man who lay somewhere
  among the rocks, without a horse to carry him far, and too badly wounded to
  shift his position. Yet he could lie in his shelter, whatever clump of
  boulders he chose, and would make it hot for the men who tried to rout him
  out. The heavy breathing of the three wounded men gave point to these
  thoughts, and the men of family and the men of little heart got up and left
  the posse.</p>

  <p>The sheriff made no attempt to keep them. He retained his first hand-
  picked group. In the gray of the morning he rallied these men again. They
  went first to the dead, stiff body of the chestnut gelding and stripped it of
  the saddle and the pack of Lanning. This, by silent consent, was to be the
  reward of the trapper. This was his in lieu of the money which he would have
  earned if they had killed Lanning on the spot. Hal Dozier stiffly invited
  Hank to join them in the manhunt; he was met by a solemn silence, and the
  request was not repeated. Dozier had done a disagreeable duty, and the whole
  posse was glad to be free of the traitor. In the meantime the morning was
  brightening rapidly, and Dozier led out his men.</p>

  <p>They went to their horses, and, coming back to the place where Andrew had
  made his halt and fired his three shots, they took up the trail.</p>

  <p>It was as easy to read as a book. The sign was never wanting for more than
  three steps at a time, and Hal Dozier, reading skillfully, watched the
  decreasing distance between heel indentations, a sure sign that the fugitive
  was growing weak from the loss of the blood that spotted the trail. Straight
  on to the doorstep of Pop's cabin went the trail. Dozier rapped at the door,
  and the old man himself appeared. The bony fingers of one hand were wrapped
  around the corncob, which was his inseparable companion, and in the other he
  held the cloth with which he had been drying dishes. Jud turned from his pan
  of dishwater to cast a frightened glance over his shoulder. Pop did not wait
  for explanations.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Dozier," he invited. "Come in, boys. Glad to see you. Ain't
  particular comfortable for an oldster like me when they's a full-grown, man-
  eatin' outlaw layin' about the grounds. This Lanning come to my door last
  night. Me and Jud was sittin' by the stove. He wanted to get us to bandage
  him up, but I yanked my gun off'n the wall and ordered him away."</p>

  <p>"You got your gun on Lanning&mdash;off the wall&mdash;before he had you
  covered?" asked Hal Dozier with a singular smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I ain't so slow with my hands," declared Pop. "I ain't half so old as
  I look, son! Besides, he was bleedin' to death and crazy in the head. I don't
  figure he even thought about his gun just then." "Why didn't you shoot him
  down, Pop? Or take him? There's money in him."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it? Ain't I seen the posters? But I wasn't for pressin'
  things too hard. Not me at my age, with Jud along. I ordered him away and let
  him go. He went down yonder. Oh, you won't have far to go. He was about all
  in when he left. But I ain't been out lookin' around yet this morning. I know
  the feel of a forty-five slug in your inwards."</p>

  <p>He placed a hand upon his stomach, and a growl of amusement went through
  the posse. After all, Pop was a known man. In the meantime someone had picked
  up the trail to the cliff, and Dozier followed it. They went along the heel
  marks to a place where blood had spurted liberally over the ground. "Must
  have had a hemorrhage here," said Dozier. "No, we won't have far to go. Poor
  devil!"</p>

  <p>And then they came to the edge of the cliff, where the heel marks ended.
  "He walked straight over," said one of the men. "Think o' that!"</p>

  <p>"No," exclaimed Dozier, who was on his knees examining the marks, "he
  stood here a minute or so. First he shifted to one foot, and then he shifted
  his weight to the other. And his boots were turning in. Queer. I suppose his
  knees were buckling. He saw he was due to bleed to death and he took a
  shorter way! Plain suicide. Look down, boys! See anything?"</p>

  <p>There was a jumble of sharp rocks at the base of the cliff, and the water
  of the stream very close. Nothing showed on the rocks, nothing showed on the
  face of the cliff. They found a place a short distance to the right and
  lowered a man down with the aid of a rope. He looked about among the rocks.
  Then he ran down the stream for some distance. He came back with a glum
  face.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of the body of Andrew Lanning among the rocks. Looking
  up to the top of the cliff, from the place where he stood, he figured that a
  man could have jumped clear of the rocks by a powerful leap and might have
  struck in the swift current of the stream. There was no trace of the body in
  the waters, no drop of blood on the rocks. But then the water ran here at a
  terrific rate; the scout had watched a heavy boulder moved while he stood
  there. He went down the bank and came at once to a deep pool, over which the
  water was swirling. He sounded that pool with a long branch and found no
  bottom.</p>

  <p>"And that makes it clear," he said, "that the body went down the water,
  came to that pool, was sucked down, and got lodged in the rocks. Anybody
  differ? No, gents, Andrew Lanning is food for the trout. And I say it's the
  best way out of the job for all of us."</p>

  <p>But Hal Dozier was a man full of doubts. "There's only one other thing
  possible," he said. "He might have turned aside at the house of Pop. He may
  be there now."</p>

  <p>"But don't the trail come here? And is there any back trail to the house?"
  one of the men protested.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look possible," nodded Hal Dozier, "but queer things are apt
  to happen. Let's go back and have a look."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>CHAPTER 26</h2>

  <p class="first">He dismounted and gave his horse to one of the others,
  telling them that he would do the scouting himself this time, and he went
  back on foot to the house of Pop. He made his steps noiseless as he came
  closer, not that he expected to surprise Pop to any purpose, but the natural
  instinct of the trailer made him advance with caution, and, when he was close
  enough to the door he heard: "Oh, he's a clever gent, well enough, but they
  ain't any of 'em so clever that they can't learn somethin' new." Hal Dozier
  paused with his hand raised to rap at the door and he heard Pop say in
  continuation: "You write this down in red, sonny, and don't you never forget
  it: The wisest gent is the gent that don't take nothin' for granted."</p>

  <p>It came to Hal Dozier that, if he delayed his entrance for another moment,
  he might hear something distinctly to his advantage; but his role of
  eavesdropper did not fit with his broad shoulders, and, after knocking on the
  door, he stepped in. Pop was putting away the dishes, and Jud was scrubbing
  out the sink.</p>

  <p>"The boys are working up the trail," said Hal Dozier, "but they can do it
  by themselves. I know that the trail ends at the cliff. I'll tell you that
  poor kid walked to the edge of the cliff, stopped there a minute; made up his
  mind that he was bleeding to death, and then cut it short. He jumped, missed
  the rocks underneath, and was carried off by the river." Dozier followed up
  his statement with some curse words.</p>

  <p>He watched the face of the other keenly, but the old man was busy filling
  his pipe. His eyebrows, to be sure, flicked up as he heard this tragedy
  announced, and there was a breath from Jud. "I'll tell you, Dozier," said the
  other, lighting his pipe and then tamping the red-hot coals with his
  calloused forefinger, "I'm kind of particular about the way people cusses
  around Jud. He's kind of young, and they ain't any kind of use of him
  litterin' up his mind with useless words. Don't mean no offense to you,
  Dozier."</p>

  <p>The deputy officer took a chair and tipped it back against the wall. He
  felt that he had been thoroughly checkmated in his first move; and yet he
  sensed an atmosphere of suspicion in this little house. It lingered in the
  air. Also, he noted that Jud was watching him with rather wide eyes and a
  face of unhealthy pallor; but that might very well be because of the awe
  which the youngster felt in beholding Hal Dozier, the manhunter, at close
  range. All these things were decidedly small clews, but the marshal was
  accustomed to acting on hints.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Pop, having put away the last of the dishes in a
  cupboard, whose shelves were lined with fresh white paper, offered Dozier a
  cup of coffee. While he sipped it, the marshal complimented his host on the
  precision with which he maintained his house.</p>

  <p>"It looks like a woman's hand had been at work," concluded the
  marshal.</p>

  <p>"Something better'n that," declared the other. "A man's hand, Dozier.
  People has an idea that because women mostly do housework men are out of
  place in a kitchen. It ain't so. Men just got somethin' more important on
  their hands most of the time." His eyes glanced sadly toward his gun rack.
  "Women is a pile overpraised, Dozier. I ask you, man to man, did you ever see
  a cleaner floor than that in a woman's kitchen?"</p>

  <p>The marshal admitted that he never had. "But you're a rare man," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Pop shook his head. "When I was a boy like you," he said, "I wasn't
  nothin' to be passed up too quick. But a man's young only once, and that's a
  short time&mdash;and he's old for years and years and years, Dozier." He
  added, for fear that he might have depressed his guest, "But me and Jud team
  it, you see. I'm extra old and Jud's extra young&mdash;so we kind of hit an
  average."</p>

  <p>He touched the shoulder of the boy and there was a flash of eyes between
  them, the flicker of a smile. Hal Dozier drew a breath. "I got no kids of my
  own," he declared. "You're lucky, friend. And you're lucky to have this neat
  little house."</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't. They's no luck to it, because I made every sliver of it with
  my own hands." An idea came to the deputy marshal.</p>

  <p>"There's a place up in the hills behind my house, a day's ride," he said,
  "where I go hunting now and then, and I've an idea a little house like this
  would be just the thing for me. Mind if I look it over?"</p>

  <p>Pop tamped his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Sure thing," he said. "Look as much as you like."</p>

  <p>He stepped to a corner of the room and by a ring he raised a trapdoor. "I
  got a cellar 'n' everything. Take a look at it below."</p>

  <p>He lighted the lantern, and Hal Dozier went down the steep steps, humming.
  "Look at the way that foundation's put in," said the old man in a loud voice.
  "I done all that, too, with my own hands."</p>

  <p>His voice was so unnecessarily loud, indeed, just as if the deputy were
  already under ground, that it occurred to Dozier that if a man were lying in
  that cellar he would be amply warned. And going down he walked with the
  lantern held to one side, to keep the light off his own body as much as
  possible; his hand kept at his hip.</p>

  <p>But, when he reached the cellar, he found only some boxes and canned
  provisions in a rack at one side, and a various litter all kept in close
  order. Big stones had been chiseled roughly into shape to build the walls,
  and the flooring was as dry as the floor of the house. It was, on the whole,
  a very solid bit of work. A good place to imprison a man, for instance. At
  this thought Dozier glanced up sharply and saw the other holding the trapdoor
  ajar. Something about that implacable, bony face made Dozier turn and hurry
  back up the stairs to the main floor of the house.</p>

  <p>"Nice bit of work down there," he said. "I can use that idea very well.
  Well," he added carelessly, "I wonder when my fool posse will get through
  hunting for the remains of poor Lanning? Come to think of it"&mdash;for it
  occurred to him that if the old man were indeed concealing the outlaw he
  might not know the price which was on his head&mdash;"there's a pretty little
  bit of coin connected with Lanning. Too bad you didn't drop him when he came
  to your door."</p>

  <p>"Drop a helpless man&mdash;for money?" asked the old man. "Never,
  Dozier!"</p>

  <p>"He hadn't long to live, anyway," answered the marshal in some confusion.
  Those old, straight eyes of Pop troubled him.</p>

  <p>He fenced with a new stroke for a confession.</p>

  <p>"For my part, I've never had much heart in this work of mine."</p>

  <p>"He killed your brother, didn't he?" asked Pop with considerable
  dryness.</p>

  <p>"Bill made the wrong move," replied Hal instantly. "He never should have
  ridden Lanning down in the first place. Should have let the fool kid go until
  he found out that Buck Heath wasn't killed. Then he would have come back of
  his own accord."</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea," remarked the other, "but sort of late, it strikes
  me. Did you tell that to the sheriff?"</p>

  <p>"Late it is," remarked Dozier, not following the question. "Now the poor
  kid is outlawed. Well, between you and me, I wish he'd gotten away clean-
  handed. But too late now.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he went on, "I'd like to take a squint at your attic, too.
  That ladder goes up to it, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Pop. And once more he tamped his pipe.</p>

  <p>There was a sharp, shrill cry from the boy, and Dozier whirled on him. He
  saw a pale, scared face.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked sharply. "What's the matter with you, Jud?"
  And he fastened his keen glance on the boy.</p>

  <p>Vaguely, from the corner of his eye, he felt that Pop had taken the pipe
  from his mouth. There was a sort of breathless touch in the air of the room.
  "Nothin'," said Jud. "Only&mdash;you know the rungs of that ladder ain't fit
  to be walked on, grandad!"</p>

  <p>"Jud," said the old man with a strained tone, "It ain't my business to
  give warnin's to an officer of the law&mdash;not mine. He'll find out little
  things like that for himself."</p>

  <p>For one moment Dozier remained looking from one face to the other. Then he
  shrugged his shoulders and went slowly up the ladder. It squeaked under his
  weight, he felt the rungs bow and tremble. Halfway up he turned suddenly, but
  Pop was sitting as old men will, humming a tune and keeping time to it by
  patting the bowl of his pipe with a forefinger.</p>

  <p>And Dozier made up his mind.</p>

  <p>He turned and came down the ladder. "I guess there's no use looking in the
  attic," he said. "Same as any other attic, I suppose, Pop?"</p>

  <p>"The same?" asked Pop, taking the pipe from his mouth. "I should tell a
  man it ain't. It's my work, that attic is, and it's different. I handled the
  joinin' of them joists pretty slick, but you better go and see for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>And he smiled at the deputy from under his bushy brows. Hal Dozier grinned
  broadly back at him.</p>

  <p>"I've seen your work in the cellar, Pop," he said. "I don't want to risk
  my neck on that ladder. No, I'll have to let it go. Besides, I'll have to
  round up the boys."</p>

  <p>He waved farewell, stepped through the door, and closed it behind him.</p>

  <p>"Grandad," exclaimed Jud in a gasp.</p>

  <p>The old man silenced him with a raised finger and a sudden frown. He
  slipped to the door in turn with a step so noiseless that even Jud wondered.
  Years seemed to have fallen from the shoulders of his grandfather. He opened
  the door quickly, and there stood the deputy. His back, to be sure, was
  turned to the door, but he hadn't moved.</p>

  <p>"Think I see your gang over yonder," said Pop. "They seem to be sort of
  waitin' for you, Dozier."</p>

  <p>The other turned and twisted one glance up at the old man.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said shortly and strode away.</p>

  <p>Pop closed the door and sank into a chair. He seemed suddenly to have aged
  again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, grandad," said Jud, "how'd you guess he was there all the time?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said Pop. "Don't bother me."</p>

  <p>"But why'd you beg him to look into the attic? Didn't you know he'd see
  him right off?"</p>

  <p>"Because he goes by contraries, Jud. He wouldn't of started for the ladder
  at all, if you hadn't told him he'd probably break his neck on it. Only when
  he seen I didn't care, he made up his mind he didn't want to see that
  attic."</p>

  <p>"And if he'd gone up?" whispered Jud.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me what would of happened," said Pop.</p>

  <p>All his bony frame was shaken by a shiver.</p>

  <p>"Is he such a fine fighter?" asked Jud.</p>

  <p>"Fighter?" echoed Pop. "Oh, lad, he's the greatest hand with a gun that
  ever shoved foot into stirrup. He&mdash;he was like a bulldog on a trail
  &mdash;and all I had for a rope to hold him was just a little spider thread
  of thinking. Gimme some coffee, Jud. I've done a day's work."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>CHAPTER 27</h2>

  <p class="first">The bullets of the posse had neither torn a tendon nor
  broken a bone. Striking at close range and driven by highpower rifles, the
  slugs had whipped cleanly through the flesh of Andrew Lanning, and the flesh
  closed again, almost as swiftly as ice freezes firm behind the wire that cuts
  it. In a very few days he could sit up, and finally came down the ladder with
  Pop beneath him and Jud steadying his shoulders from above. That was a gala
  day in the house. Indeed, they had lived well ever since the coming of
  Andrew, for he had insisted that he bear the household expense while he
  remained there, since they would not allow him to depart.</p>

  <p>"And I'll let you pay for things, Andrew," Pop had said, "if you won't say
  nothing about it, ever, to Jud. He's a proud kid, is Jud, and he'd bust his
  heart if he thought I was lettin' you spend a cent here."</p>

  <p>But this day they had a fine steak, brought out from Tomo by Pop the
  evening before, and they had beans with plenty of pork and molasses in them,
  cream biscuits, which Pop could make delicious beyond belief, to say nothing
  of canned tomatoes with bits of dried bread in them, and coffee as black as
  night. Such was the celebration when Andrew came down to join his hosts, and
  so high did all spirits rise that even Jud, the resolute and the alert,
  forgot his watch. Every day from dawn to dark he was up to the door or to the
  rear window, keeping the landscape under a sweeping observance every few
  moments, lest some chance traveler&mdash;all search for Andrew Lanning had,
  of course, ceased with the moment of his disappearance&mdash;should happen by
  and see the stranger in the household of Pop. But during these festivities
  all else was forgotten, and in the midst of things a decided, rapid knock was
  heard at the door.</p>

  <p>Speech was cut off at the root by that sound. For whoever the stranger
  might be, he must certainly have heard three voices raised in that room. It
  was Andrew who spoke. And he spoke in only a whisper. "Whoever it may be, let
  him in," said Andrew, "and, if there's any danger about him, he won't leave
  till I'm able to leave. Open the door, Jud."</p>

  <p>And Jud, with a stricken look, crossed the floor with trailing feet. The
  knock was repeated; it had a metallic clang, as though the man outside were
  rapping with the butt of a gun in his impatience, and Andrew, setting his
  teeth, laid his hand on the handle of his revolver. Here Jud cast open the
  door, and, standing close to it with her forefeet on the top step, was the
  bay mare. She instantly thrust in her head and snorted in the direction of
  the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven!" said Andrew. "I thought it was the guns again!" And Jud,
  shouting with delight and relief, threw his arms around the neck of the
  horse. "It's Sally!" he said. "Sally, you rascal!"</p>

  <p>"That good-for-nothing hoss Sally," complained the old man. "Shoo her
  away, Jud."</p>

  <p>But Andrew protested at that, and Jud cast him a glance of gratitude.
  Andrew himself got up from the table and went across the room with half of an
  apple in his hand. He sliced it into bits, and she took them daintily from
  between his fingers. And when Jud reluctantly ordered her away she did not
  blunder down the steps, but threw her weight back on her haunches and swerved
  lightly away. It fascinated Andrew; he had never seen so much of feline
  control in the muscles of a horse. When he turned back to the table he
  announced: "Pop, I've got to ride that horse. I've got to have her. How does
  she sell?"</p>

  <p>"She ain't mine," said Pop. "You better ask Jud."</p>

  <p>Jud was at once white and red. He looked at his hero, and then he looked
  into his mind and saw the picture of Sally. A way out occurred to him. "You
  can have her when you can ride her," he said. "She ain't much use except to
  look at. But if you can saddle her and ride her before you leave&mdash;well,
  you can leave on her, Andy."</p>

  <p>It was the beginning of busy days for Andrew. The cold weather was coming
  on rapidly. Now the higher mountains above them were swiftly whitening, while
  the line of the snow was creeping nearer and nearer. The sight of it alarmed
  Andrew, and, with the thought of being snow-bound in these hills, his blood
  turned cold. What he yearned for were the open spaces of the mountain desert,
  where he could see the enemy approach. But every day in the cabin the terror
  grew that someone would pass, some one, unnoticed, would observe the
  stranger. The whisper would reach Tomo&mdash;the posse would come again, and
  the second time the trap was sure to work. He must get away, but no ordinary
  horse would do for him. If he had had a fine animal under him Bill Dozier
  would never have run him down, and he would still be within the border of the
  law. A fine horse &mdash;such a horse as Sally, say!</p>

  <p>If he had been strong he would have attempted to break her at once, but he
  was not strong. He could barely support his own weight during the first
  couple of days after he left the bunk, and he had to use his mind. He began,
  then, at the point where Jud had left off.</p>

  <p>Jud could ride Sally with a scrap of cloth beneath him; Andrew started to
  increase the size of that cloth. To keep it in place he made a long strip of
  sacking to serve as a cinch, and before the first day was gone she was
  thoroughly used to it. With this great step accomplished, Andrew increased
  the burden each time he changed the pad. He got a big tarpaulin and folded it
  many times; the third day she was accepting it calmly and had ceased to turn
  her head and nose it. Then he carried up a small sack of flour and put that
  in place upon the tarpaulin. She winced under the dead-weight burden; there
  followed a full half hour of frantic bucking which would have pitched the
  best rider in the world out of a saddle, but the sack of flour was tied on,
  and Sally could not dislodge it. When she was tired of bucking she stood
  still, and then discovered that the sack of flour was not only harmless but
  that it was good to eat. Andrew was barely in time to save the contents of
  the sack from her teeth.</p>

  <p>It was another long step forward in the education of Sally. Next he
  fashioned clumsy imitations of stirrups, and there was a long fight between
  Sally and stirrups, but the stirrups, being inanimate, won, and Sally
  submitted to the bouncing wooden things at her sides. And still, day after
  day, Andrew built his imitation saddle closer and closer to the real thing,
  until he had taken a real pair of cinches off one of Pop's saddles and had
  taught her to stand the pressure without flinching.</p>

  <p>There was another great return from Andrew's long and steady intimacy with
  the mare. She came to accept him absolutely. She knew his voice; she would
  come to his whistle; and finally, when every vestige of unsoundness had left
  his wounds, he climbed into that improvised saddle and put his feet in the
  stirrups. Sally winced down in her catlike way and shuddered, but he began to
  talk to her, and the familiar voice decided Sally. She merely turned her head
  and rubbed his knee with her nose. The battle was over and won. Ten minutes
  later Andrew had cinched a real saddle in place, and she bore the weight of
  the leather without a stir. The memory of that first saddle and the biting of
  the bur beneath it had been gradually wiped from her mind, and the new saddle
  was connected indisolubly with the voice and the hand of the man. At the end
  of that day's work Andrew carried the saddle back into the house with a happy
  heart.</p>

  <p>And the next day he took his first real ride on the back of the mare. He
  noted how easily she answered the play of his wrist, how little her head
  moved in and out, so that he seldom had to sift the reins through his fingers
  to keep in touch with the bit. He could start her from a stand into a full
  gallop with a touch of his knees, and he could bring her to a sliding halt
  with the least pressure on the reins. He could tell, indeed, that she was one
  of those rare possessions, a horse with a wise mouth.</p>

  <p>And yet he had small occasion to keep up on the bit as he rode her. She
  was no colt which hardly knew its own paces. She was a stanch five-year-old,
  and she had roamed the mountains about Pop's place at will. She went like a
  wild thing over the broken going. That catlike agility with which she wound
  among the rocks, hardly impaired her speed as she swerved. Andrew found her a
  book whose pages he could turn forever and always find something new.</p>

  <p>He forgot where he was going. He only knew that the wind was clipping his
  face and that Sally was eating up the ground, and he came to himself with a
  start, after a moment, realizing that his dream had carried him perilously
  out of the mouth of the ravine. He had even allowed the mare to reach a bit
  of winding road, rough indeed, but cut by many wheels and making a white
  streak across the country. Andrew drew in his breath anxiously and turned her
  back for the canyon.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28"></a>CHAPTER 28</h2>

  <p class="first">It was, indeed, a grave moment, yet the chances were large
  that even if he met someone on the road he would not be recognized, for it
  had been many days since the death of Andrew Lanning was announced through
  the countryside. He gritted his teeth when he thought that this single burst
  of childish carelessness might have imperiled all that he and Jud and Pop had
  worked for so long and so earnestly&mdash;the time when he could take the bay
  mare and start the ride across the mountains to the comparative safety on the
  other side.</p>

  <p>That time, he made up his mind, would be the next evening. He was well;
  Sally was thoroughly mastered; and, with a horse beneath him which, he felt,
  could give even the gray stallion of Hal Dozier hard work, and therefore show
  her heels to any other animal on the mountain desert, he looked forward to
  the crossing of the mountains as an accomplished fact. Always supposing that
  he could pass Twin Falls and the fringe of towns in the hills, without being
  recognized and the alarm sent out.</p>

  <p>Going back up the road toward the ravine at a brisk canter, he pursued the
  illuminating comparison between Sally and Dozier's famous Gray Peter. Of
  course, nothing but a downright test of speed and weight-carrying power,
  horse to horse, could decide which was the superior, but Andrew had ridden
  Gray Peter many times when he and Uncle Jasper went out to the Dozier place,
  and he felt that he could sum up the differences between the two beautiful
  animals. Sally was the smaller of the two, for instance. She could not stand
  more than fifteen hands, or fifteen-one at the most. Gray Peter was a full
  sixteen hands of strong bone and fine muscle, a big animal&mdash;almost too
  big for some purposes. Among these rocks, now, he would stand no chance with
  Sally. Gray Peter was a picture horse. When one looked at him one felt that
  he was a standard by which other animals should be measured. He carried his
  head loftily, and there was a lordly flaunt to his tail. On the other hand,
  Sally was rather long and low. Furthermore, her neck, which was by no means
  the heavy neck of the gray stallion, she was apt to carry stretched rather
  straight out and not curled proudly up as Gray Peter carried his. Neither did
  she bear her tail so proudly. Some of this, of course, was due to the
  difference between a mare and a stallion, but still more came from the
  differing natures of the two animals. In the head lay the greatest variation.
  The head of Gray Peter was close to perfection, light, compact, heavy of
  jowl; his eye at all times was filled with an intolerable brightness, a keen
  flame of courage and eagerness. But one could find a fault with Sally's head.
  In general, it was very well shaped, with the wide forehead and all the other
  good points which invariably go with that feature; but her face was just a
  trifle dished. Moreover, her eye was apt to be a bit dull. She had been a pet
  all her life, and, like most pets, her eye partook of the human quality. It
  had a conversational way of brightening and growing dull. On the whole, the
  head of Sally had a whimsical, inquisitive expression, and by her whole
  carriage she seemed to be perpetually putting her nose into other business
  than her own.</p>

  <p>But the gait was the main difference. Riding Gray Peter, one felt an
  enormous force urging at the bit and ready and willing to expend itself to
  the very last ounce, with tremendous courage and good heart; there was always
  a touch of fear that Gray Peter, plunging unabated over rough and smooth,
  might be running himself out. But Sally would not maintain one pace. She was
  apt to shorten her stride for choppy going, and she would lengthen it like a
  witch on the level. She kept changing the elevation of her head. She ran
  freely, looking about her and taking note of what she saw, so that she gave
  an indescribable effect of enjoying the gallop just as much as her rider, but
  in a different way. All in all, Gray Peter was a glorious machine; Sally was
  a tricky intelligence. Gray Peter's heart was never in doubt, but what would
  Sally's courage be in a pinch?</p>

  <p>Full of these comparisons, studying Sally as one would study a friend,
  Andrew forgot again all around him, and so he came suddenly, around a bend in
  the road, upon a buckboard with two men in it. He went by the buckboard with
  a wave of greeting and a side glance, and it was not until he was quite
  around the elbow turn that he remembered that one of the men in the wagon had
  looked at him with a strange intentness. It was a big man with a great blond
  beard, parted as though with a comb by the wind.</p>

  <p>He rode back around the bend, and there, down the road, he saw the
  buckboard bouncing, with the two horses pulling it at a dead gallop and the
  driver leaning back in the seat.</p>

  <p>But the other man, the big man with the beard, had picked a rifle out of
  the bed of the wagon, and now he sat turned in the seat, with his blond beard
  blown sidewise as he looked back. Beyond a doubt Andrew had been recognized,
  and now the two were speeding to Tomo to give their report and raise the
  alarm a second time. Andrew, with a groan, shot his hand to the long holster
  of the rifle which Pop had insisted that he take with him if he rode out.
  There was still plenty of time for a long shot. He saw the rifle jerk up to
  the shoulder of the big man; something hummed by him, and then the report
  came barking up the ravine.</p>

  <p>But Andrew turned Sally and went around the bend; that old desire to rush
  on the men and shoot them down, that same cold tingling of the nerves, which
  he had felt when he faced the posse after the fall of Bill Dozier, was on him
  again, and he had to fight it down. He mastered it, and galloped with a heavy
  heart up the ravine and to the house of Pop. The old man saw him; he called
  to Jud, and the two stood in front of the door to admire the horseman and his
  horse. But Andrew flung himself out of the saddle and came to them sadly. He
  told them what had happened, the meeting, the recognition. There was only one
  thing to do&mdash;make up the pack as soon as possible and leave the place.
  For they would know where he had been hiding. Sally was famous all through
  the mountains; she was known as Pop's outlaw horse, and the searchers would
  come straight to his house.</p>

  <p>Pop took the news philosophically, but Jud became a pitiful figure of
  stone in his grief. He came to life again to help in the packing. They worked
  swiftly, and Andrew began to ask the final questions about the best and
  least- known trails over the mountains. Pop discouraged the attempt.</p>

  <p>"You seen what happened before," he said. "They'll have learned their
  lesson from Hal Dozier. They'll take the telephone and rouse the towns all
  along the mountains. In two hours, Andy, two hundred men will be blocking
  every trail and closin' in on you."</p>

  <p>And Andrew reluctantly admitted the truth of what he said. He resigned
  himself gloomily to turning back onto the mountain desert, and now he
  remembered the warning of failure which Henry Allister had given him. He
  felt, indeed, that the great outlaw had simply allowed him to run on a long
  rope, knowing that he must travel in a circle and eventually come back to the
  band.</p>

  <p>Now the pack was made&mdash;he saw Jud covertly tuck some little mementoes
  into it&mdash;and he drew Pop aside and dropped a weight of gold coins into
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You tarnation scoundrel!" began Pop huskily.</p>

  <p>"Hush," said Andrew, "or Jud will hear you and know that I've tried to
  leave some money. You don't want to ruin me with Jud, do you?"</p>

  <p>Pop was uneasy and uncertain.</p>

  <p>"I've had your food these weeks and your care, Pop," said Andrew, "and now
  I walk off with a saddle and a horse and an outfit all yours. It's too much.
  I can't take charity. But suppose I accept it as a gift; I leave you an
  exchange&mdash;a present for Jud that you can give him later on. Is that
  fair?"</p>

  <p>"Andy," said the old man, "you've double-crossed me, and you've got me
  where I can't talk out before Jud. But I'll get even yet. Good-by, lad, and
  put this one thing under your hat: It's the loneliness that's goin' to be the
  hardest thing to fight, Andy. You'll get so tired of bein' by yourself that
  you'll risk murder for the sake of a talk. But then hold hard. Stay by
  yourself. Don't trust to nobody. And keep clear of towns. Will you do
  that?"</p>

  <p>"That's plain common sense, Pop."</p>

  <p>"Aye, lad, and the plain things are always the hardest things to do."</p>

  <p>Next came Jud. He was very white, but he approached Andrew with a careless
  swagger and shook hands firmly.</p>

  <p>"When you bump into that Dozier, Andy," he said, "get him, will you?
  S'long!"</p>

  <p>He turned sharply and sauntered toward the open door of the house. But
  before he was halfway to it they heard a choking sound; Jud broke into a run,
  and, once past the door, slammed it behind him.</p>

  <p>"Don't mind him," said Pop, clearing his throat violently. "He'll cry the
  sick feelin' out of his insides. God bless you, Andy! And remember what I
  say: The loneliness is the hard thing to fight, but keep clear of men, and
  after a time they'll forget about you. You can settle down and nobody'll rake
  up old scores. I know."</p>

  <p>"D'you think it can be done?"</p>

  <p>There was a faint, cold twinkle in the eyes of Pop. "I'll tell a man it
  can be done," he said slowly. "When you come back here I may be able to tell
  you a little story, Andy. Now climb on Sally and don't hit nothin' but the
  high spots."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29"></a>CHAPTER 29</h2>

  <p class="first">Even in his own lifetime a man in the mountain desert passes
  swiftly from the fact of history into the dream of legend. The telephone and
  the newspaper cannot bring that lonely region into the domain of cold truth.
  In the time that followed people seized on the story of Andrew Lanning and
  embroidered it with rare trimmings. It was told over and over again in
  saloons and around family firesides and in the bunk houses of many ranches.
  For Andrew had done what many men failed to do in spite of a score of
  killings&mdash;he struck the public fancy. People realized, however vaguely,
  that here was a unique story of the making of a desperado, and they gathered
  the story of Andrew Lanning to their hearts.</p>

  <p>On the whole, it was not an unkindly interest. In reality the sympathy was
  with the outlaw. For everyone knew that Hal Dozier was on the trail again,
  and everyone felt that in the end he would run down his man, and there was a
  general hope that the chase might be a long one. For one thing, the end of
  that chase would have removed one of the few vital current bits of news. Men
  could no longer open conversations by asking the last tidings of Andrew. Such
  questions were always a signal for an unlocking of tongues around the
  circle.</p>

  <p>Many untruths were told. For instance, the blowing of the safe in
  Allertown was falsely attributed to Andrew, while in reality he knew nothing
  about "soup" and its uses. And the running of the cows off the Circle O Bar
  range toward the border was another exploit which was wrongly checked to his
  credit or discredit. Also the brutal butchery in the night at Buffalo Head
  was sometimes said to be Andrew's work, but in general the men of the
  mountain desert came to know that the outlaw was not a red-handed murderer,
  but simply a man who fought for his own life.</p>

  <p>The truths in themselves were enough to bear telling and retelling.
  Andrew's Thanksgiving dinner at William Foster's house, with a revolver on
  the table and a smile on his lips, was a pleasant tale and a thrilling one as
  well, for Foster had been able to go to the telephone and warn the nearest
  officer of the law. There was the incident of the jammed rifle at The
  Crossing; the tale of how a youngster at Tomo decided that he would rival the
  career of the great man&mdash;how he got a fine bay mare and started a
  blossoming career of crime by sticking up three men on the road and
  committing several depredations which were all attributed to Andrew, until
  Andrew himself ran down the foolish fellow, shot the gun out of his hand,
  gave him a talking that recalled his lost senses.</p>

  <p>But all details fell into insignificance compared with the general theme,
  which was the mighty duel between Andrew and Hal Dozier&mdash;the unescapable
  manhunter and the trapwise outlaw. Hal did not lose any reputation because he
  failed to take Andrew Lanning at once. The very fact that he was able to keep
  close enough to make out the trail at all increased his fame. He did not even
  lose his high standing because he would not hunt Andrew alone. He always kept
  a group with him, and people said that he was wise to do it. Not because he
  was not a match for Andrew Lanning singlehanded, but because it was folly to
  risk life when there were odds which might be used against the desperado. But
  everyone felt that eventually Lanning would draw the deputy marshal away from
  his posse, and then the outlaw would turn, and there would follow a battle of
  the giants. The whole mountain desert waited for that time to come and bated
  its breath in hope and fear of it.</p>

  <p>But if the men of the mountain desert considered Hal Dozier the greatest
  enemy of Andrew, he himself had quite another point of view. It was the
  loneliness, as Pop had promised him. There were days when he hardly touched
  food such was his distaste for the ugly messes which he had to cook with his
  own hands; there were days when he would have risked his life to eat a meal
  served by the hands of another and cooked by another man. That was the secret
  of that Thanksgiving dinner at the Foster house, though others put it down to
  sheer, reckless mischief. And today, as he made his fire between two stones
  &mdash;a smoldering, evil-smelling fire of sagebrush&mdash;the smoke kept
  running up his clothes and choking his lungs with its pungency. And the fat
  bacon which he cut turned his stomach. At last he sat down, forgetting the
  bacon in the pan, forgetting the long fast and the hard ride which had
  preceded this meal, and stared at the fire.</p>

  <p>Rather, the fire was the thing which he kept chiefly in the center of his
  vision, but his glances went everywhere, to all sides, up, and down. Hal
  Dozier had hunted him hotly down the valley of the Little Silver River, but
  near the village of Los Toros the fagged posse and Hal himself had dropped
  back and once more given up the chase. No doubt they would rest for a few
  hours in the town, change horses, and then come after him again.</p>

  <p>It was a new Andrew Lanning that sat there by the fire. He had left
  Martindale a clear-faced boy; the months that followed had changed him to a
  man; the boyhood had been literally burned out of him. The skin of his face,
  indeed, refused to tan, but now, instead of a healthy and crisp white it was
  a colorless sallow. The rounded cheeks were now straight and sank in sharply
  beneath his cheek bones, with a sharply incised line beside the mouth. And
  his expression at all times was one of quivering alertness&mdash;the mouth a
  little compressed and straight, the nostrils seeming a trifle distended, and
  the eyes as restless as the eyes of a hungry wolf.</p>

  <p>Moreover, all of Andrew's actions had come to bear out this same
  expression of his face. If he sat down his legs were gathered, and he seemed
  about to stand up. If he walked he went with a nervous step, rising a little
  on his toes as though he were about to break into a run or as though he were
  poising himself to whirl at any alarm. He sat in this manner even now, under
  that dead gray sky of sheeted clouds, and in the middle of that great rolling
  plain, lifeless and colorless&mdash;lifeless except for the wind that hummed
  across it, pointed with cold. Andrew, looking from the dull glimmer of his
  fire to that dead waste, sighed. He whistled, and Sally came instantly to the
  call and dropped her head beside his own. She, at least, had not changed in
  the long pursuits and the hard life. It had made her gaunt. It had hardened
  and matured her muscles, but her head was the same, and her changeable, human
  eyes, the eyes of a pet, had not altered.</p>

  <p>She stood there with her head down, silently; and Andrew, his hands locked
  around his knees, neither spoke to her nor stirred. But by degrees the pain
  and the hunger went out of his face, and, as though she knew that she was no
  longer needed, Sally tipped his sombrero over his eyes with a toss of her
  head, and, having given this signal of disgust at being called without a
  purpose, she went back to her work of cropping the gramma grass, which of all
  grasses a horse loves best. Andrew straightened his hat and cast one glance
  after her.</p>

  <p>A shade of thought passed over his face as he looked at her. But this time
  the posse was probably once more starting on out of Los Toros and taking his
  trail. It would mean another test; he did not fear for her, but he pitied her
  for the hard work that was coming, and he looked almost with regret over the
  long racing lines of her body. And it was then, coming out of the sight of
  Sally, the thought of the posse, and the disgust for the greasy bacon in the
  pan, that Andrew received a quite new idea. It was to stop his flight, turn
  about, and double like a fox straight back toward Los Toros, making a detour
  to the left. The posse would plunge ahead, and he could cut in toward Los
  Toros. For he had determined to eat once again, at least, at a table covered
  with a white cloth, food prepared by the hand of another. Sally was known; he
  would leave her in the grove beside the Little Silver River. For himself,
  weeks had passed since any man had seen him, and certainly no one in Los
  Toros had met him face to face. He would be unknown except for a general
  description. And to disarm suspicion entirely he would leave his cartridge
  belt and his revolver with Sally in the woods. For what human being, no
  matter how imaginative, would possibly dream of Andrew Lanning going unarmed
  into a town and sitting calmly at a table to order a meal?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30"></a>CHAPTER 30</h2>

  <p class="first">Retrospection made Andrew Lanning's coming to Los Toros a
  mad freak, whereas it was in reality a very clever stroke. Hal Dozier would
  have been on the road five hours before if he had not been held up in the
  matter of horses, but this is to tell the story out of turn.</p>

  <p>Andrew saddled the mare and sent her back swiftly out of the plain, over
  the hills, and then dropped her down into the valley of the Little Silver
  River until he reached the grove of trees just outside Los Toros&mdash;some
  four hundred yards, say, from the little group of houses. He then took off
  his belt, hung it over the pommel, fastened the reins to the belt, and turned
  away. Sally would stay where he left her&mdash;unless someone else tried to
  get to her head, and then she would fight like a wildcat. He knew that, and
  he therefore started for Los Toros with his line of communications
  sufficiently guarded.</p>

  <p>He instinctively thought first of drawing his hat low over his eyes and
  walking swiftly; a moment of calm figuring told him that the better way was
  to push the hat to the back of his head, put his hands in his pockets, and go
  whistling through the streets of the town. It was the middle of the gray
  afternoon; there were few people about, and the two or three whom Andrew
  passed nodded a greeting. Each time they raised their hands the fingers of
  Andrew twitched, but he made himself smile back at them and waved in
  return.</p>

  <p>He went on until he came to the restaurant. It was a long, narrow room
  with a row of tables down each side, and a little counter and cash register
  beside the door, some gaudy posters on the wall, a screen at the rear to hide
  the entrance to the kitchen, and a ragged strip of linoleum on the narrow
  passage between the tables.</p>

  <p>These things Andrew saw with the first flick of his eyes as he came
  through the door; as for people, there was a fat old man sitting behind the
  cash register in a dirty white apron and two men in greasy overalls and black
  shirts, perhaps from the railroad. There was one other thing which
  immediately blotted out all the rest; it was a big poster, about halfway down
  the wall, on which appeared in staring letters:</p>

  <h4>"TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD<br>
  FOR THE APPREHENSION,<br>
  DEAD OR ALIVE,<br>
  OF ANDREW LANNING."</h4>

  <p>Above this caption was a picture of him, and below the big print appeared
  the body of smaller type which named his particular features. Straight to
  this sign Andrew walked and sat down at the table beneath it.</p>

  <p>It was no hypnotic attraction that took him there. He knew perfectly well
  that if a man noticed that sign he would never dream of connecting the man
  for whom, dead or alive, ten thousand dollars was to be paid, with the man
  who sat underneath the picture calmly eating his lunch in the middle of a
  town. Even if some supercurious person should make a comparison, he would not
  proceed far with it, Andrew was sure, for the picture represented the round,
  young face of a person who hardly existed now; the hardened features of
  Andrew were now only a skinny caricature of what they had been.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Andrew sat down beneath the picture, and, instead of resting
  one elbow on the table and partially veiling his face with his hand, as he
  might most naturally have done, he tilted back easily in his chair and looked
  up at the poster. The fat man from behind the register had come to take his
  order. He noted the direction of Andrew's eyes while he jotted down the
  items.</p>

  <p>"You ain't the first," he said, "that's looked at that. Think of the gent
  that'll get ten thousand dollars out of a single slug?"</p>

  <p>"I can name the man who'll get it," said Andrew, "and his name is Hal
  Dozier."</p>

  <p>"I guess you ain't far wrong," replied the other. "For that matter, the
  folks around here would mostly make the same guess. But maybe Hal's luck will
  take a turn."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andrew, "if he gets the money I'll say that he's earned it.
  And rush in some bread first, captain. I'm two-thirds starved."</p>

  <p>It was a historic meal in more than one way. The size of it was one
  notable feature, and even Andrew had to loosen his belt when he came to
  attack the main feature, which was a vast steak with fried eggs scattered
  over the top of it.</p>

  <p>The steak had been reduced to a meager rim before Andrew had any attention
  to pay to the paper which had been placed on his table. It was an eight-page
  sheet entitled _The Granville Bugle_, and a subhead announced that it was
  "the greatest paper on the ranges and the cattleman's guide." Andrew found a
  picture on the first page, a picture of Hal Dozier, and over the picture the
  following caption: "Watch this column for news of the Andrew Lanning
  hunt."</p>

  <p>The article in this week's issue contained few facts. It announced a
  number of generalities: "Marshal Hal Dozier, when interviewed, said&mdash;"
  and a great many innocuous things which he was sure that grim hunter could
  not have spoken. He passed over the rest of the column in careless contempt.
  On the second page, in a muddle of short notices, one headline caught his eye
  and held it: "Charles Merchant to Wed Society Belle."</p>

  <p>The editor had spread his talents for the public eye in doing justice to
  it:</p>

  <p>On the fifteenth of the month will be consummated a romance which began
  last year, when Charles Merchant, son of the well-known cattle king, John
  Merchant, went East and met Miss Anne Withero. It is Miss Withero's second
  visit in the West, and it is now announced that the marriage&mdash;</p>

  <p>Andrew crumpled the paper and let it fall. He glanced at a calender on the
  wall opposite him. There remained six days before the wedding.</p>

  <p>And he was still so stunned by that announcement that, raising his head
  slowly, his thoughts spinning, he looked up and encountered the eyes of Hal
  Dozier as the latter sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>He did not complete the act, but was arrested in midair, one hand grasping
  the back of the chair, the other hand at his hip. Andrew, in the space of an
  instant, thought of three things&mdash;to kick the table from him and try to
  get to the side door of the place, to catch up the heavy sugar bowl and
  attempt to bowl over his man with a well-directed blow, or to simply sit and
  look Hal Dozier in the eye.</p>

  <p>He had thought of the three things in the space that it would take a dog
  to snap at a fly and look away. He dismissed the first alternatives as
  absurd, and, picking up his cup of coffee, he raised his eyes slowly toward
  the ceiling, after the time-honored fashion of a man draining a glass, let
  his glance move gradually up and catch on the face of Dozier, and then,
  without haste, lowered the cup again to its saucer. The flush of his own
  heavy meal kept his pallor from showing. As for Dozier, there was a
  succession of changes in his features, and then he concluded by lowering
  himself heavily the rest of the way into his chair. He gave his order to the
  proprietor in a dazed fashion, looking straight at Andrew, and the latter
  knew perfectly that the deputy marshal felt that he was in a dream. He was
  seeing what was not possible to see; his eyes were telling his brain in
  definite terms: "There sits Andrew Lanning and ten thousand dollars." But the
  reason of Dozier was speaking no less decidedly: "There sits a man without a
  weapon at his hip and actually beneath the poster which offers a reward for
  the capture of the person he resembles. Also, he is in a restaurant in the
  middle of a town. I have only to raise my voice in order to surround
  him."</p>

  <p>And reason gained the upper hand, though Dozier continued to look at
  Andrew in a fascinated manner.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the outlaw knew that it would not do to disregard that glance so
  long continued. To disregard it would be to start the suspicions of Dozier as
  soon as his brain cleared.</p>

  <p>"Hello, stranger," said Andrew, and he merely made his voice a trifle
  husky and deep. "D'you know me?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of Dozier widened, there was a convulsive motion of his arm, and
  then his glance wandered slowly away.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said. "I thought I remembered your face."</p>

  <p>Should he let it rest at that? No, better risk a finishing touch. "No harm
  done," he said in the same loud voice. "Hey, captain, another cup of coffee,
  will you? And a cigar."</p>

  <p>He tilted back in his chair and began to hum. And all the time his nerves
  were jumping, and that old frenzy was taking him by the throat, that bulldog
  eagerness for the fight. But fight emptyhanded&mdash;and against Hal Dozier?
  The restaurant owner brought Dozier's order, and then the coffee and the
  cigar to Andrew, and while the deputy continued to look with dumb fascination
  at Andrew with swift side glances, Andrew finished his second cup. He bit off
  the end of his cigar, asked for his check, and paid it, and then felt his
  nerves crumble and go to pieces.</p>

  <p>It was not Hal Dozier who sat there, but death itself that looked him in
  the face. One false move, one wrong gesture, would betray him. How could he
  tell? That very moment his expression might have altered into something which
  the marshal could not fail to recognize, and the moment that final touch came
  there would be a gun play swifter than the eye could follow&mdash;simply a
  flash of steel and a simultaneous explosion.</p>

  <p>Even now, with the cigar between his teeth, he knew that if he lighted a
  match, the match would tremble between his fingers, and that trembling would
  betray him to Dozier. Yet he must not sit there, either, with the cigar
  between his teeth, unlighted. It was a little thing, but the weight of a
  feather would turn the balance and loose on him the thunderbolt of Hal Dozier
  in action.</p>

  <p>But what could he do?</p>

  <p>He found a thing in the very deeps of his despair. He got up from his
  chair, pushed his hat calmly upon his head and walked straight to the deputy.
  He dropped both hands upon the edge of Hal's table and leaned across it.</p>

  <p>"Got a light, partner?" he asked.</p>

  <p>And standing there over the table, he knew that Dozier had at length
  finally and definitely recognized him; but that the numbed brain of the
  marshal refused to permit him to act. He believed and yet he dared not
  believe his belief. Andrew saw the glance of Dozier go to his hip&mdash;his
  hip which the holster had rubbed until it gleamed. But no matter&mdash;the
  gun was not there&mdash;and stunned again by that impossible fact Dozier
  reached back and brought up his hand bearing a match box. He took out a
  match. He lighted it, his brows drawing together and slackening all the time,
  and then he looked up, his eyes rising with the lighted match, and stared
  full into the eyes of Andrew.</p>

  <p>It was discovery undoubtedly&mdash;and how long would that mental
  paralysis last?</p>

  <p>Andrew looked straight back into those eyes. His cigar took the fire and
  sucked in the flame. A cloud of smoke puffed out and rolled toward Hal
  Dozier, and Andrew turned leisurely and walked toward the door.</p>

  <p>He was a yard from it.</p>

  <p>"Lanning!" came a voice behind him, terrible, like a scream of pain.</p>

  <p>As he leaped forward a gun spoke heavily in the room. He heard the bullet
  crunch into the frame of the door; the door itself was split by the second
  shot as Andrew slammed it shut. Then he raced around the corner of the
  restaurant and made for the grove.</p>

  <p>There was not a sound behind him for a moment. Then a roar rose from the
  village and rushed after him. It gave him wings. And, looking back, he saw
  that Hal Dozier was not among the pursuers. No, half a dozen men were
  running, and firing as they ran, but there was not a rifle in the lot, and it
  takes a good man to land a bullet on the run where he is firing at a dodging
  target. The pursuers lost ground; they stopped and yelled for horses.</p>

  <p>But that was what Hal Dozier was doing now. He was jerking a saddle on the
  back of Gray Peter, and in sixty seconds he would be tearing out of Los
  Toros. In the same space Andrew was in his own saddle with a flying leap and
  spurring out of the trees.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31"></a>CHAPTER 31</h2>

  <p class="first">By one thing he knew the utter desperation of Hal Dozier.
  For the man had fired while Andrew's back was turned. The bullet had followed
  the warning cry as swiftly as the strike of a snake follows its rattle. Luck
  and his sudden leap forward had unbalanced the nice aim of Dozier, and
  perhaps his mental agitation had contributed to it. But, at any rate, Andrew
  was troubled as he cleared the edge of the trees and cantered Sally not too
  swiftly along the Little Silver River toward Las Casas mountains, a little
  east of south.</p>

  <p>He did not hurry her, partly because he wished to stay close and make sure
  of the number and force of his pursuers, and partly because he already had a
  lead sufficient to keep out of any but chance rifle shots.</p>

  <p>He had not long to wait. Men boiled out of the village like hornets out of
  a shaken nest. He could see them buckling on belts while they were riding
  with the reins in their teeth. And they came like the wind, yelling at the
  sight of their quarry. Who would not kill a horse for the sake of saying that
  he had been within pistol range of the great outlaw? But, fast as their
  horses ran, Dozier, on Gray Peter, was able to keep up with them and also to
  range easily from group to group. Truly, Gray Peter was a glorious animal! If
  he were allowed to stretch out after the mare, what would the result be?</p>

  <p>The pursuers, under the direction of Dozier, spread across the river
  bottom and, having formed so that no tricky doubling could leave them in the
  lurch on a blind trail, they began to use a new set of tactics.</p>

  <p>Dozier kept Gray Peter at a steady pace, never varying his gait. But, on
  either side of him groups of his followers urged their horses forward at
  breakneck speed. Three or four would send home the spurs and rush up the
  river bottom after Andrew. If he did not hurry on they opened fire with their
  rifles from a short distance and sent a hail of random bullets, but Andrew
  knew that a random bullet carries just as much force as a well-aimed one, and
  chance might be on the side of one of those shots. He dared not allow them to
  come too close. Yet his heart rejoiced as he watched the manner in which
  Sally accepted these challenges. She never once had to lurch into her racing
  gait; she took the rushes of the cow ponies behind her by merely lengthening
  her stride until the horses behind her were winded and had to fall back.</p>

  <p>If Andrew had let out Sally she would have walked away from them all, but
  he dared not do that. For, after he had run the heart out of the commoner
  ones, there remained Gray Peter in reserve, never changing his pace, never
  hurrying, falling often far back, as the groups one after another pushed
  close to Sally and made her spurt, gaining again when the spurts ended one by
  one.</p>

  <p>There were two hours of daylight; there was one hour of dusk; and all that
  time the crowd kept thrusting out its small groups, one after the other,
  reaching after Sally like different arms, and each time she answered the
  spurt, and always slipped away into a greater lead at the end of it. And
  then, while the twilight was turning into dark, Andrew looked back and saw
  the whole crowd rein in their horses and turn back. There remained a single
  figure following him, and that figure was easily seen, because it was a man
  on a gray horse. And then Andrew grasped the plan fully. The posse had played
  its part; the thing for which the mountain desert had waited was come at
  last, and Hal Dozier was going on to find his man single-handed and pull him
  down. Twice, before complete darkness set in, Andrew had been on the verge of
  turning and going back to accept the challenge of Hal Dozier. Always two
  things stopped him. There was first the fear of the man which he frankly
  admitted, and more than that was the feeling that one thing lay before him to
  be done before he could meet Dozier and end the long trail. He must see Anne
  Withero. She was about to be married and be drawn out of his world and into a
  new one. He felt it was more important than life or death to see her before
  that transformation took place. They would go East, no doubt. Two thousand
  miles, the law and the mountains would fence him away from her after
  that.</p>

  <p>During the last months he accepted her as he accepted the stars&mdash;
  something far away from him. Now, by some pretext, by some wile, he must live
  to see her once more. After that let Hal Dozier meet him when he would.</p>

  <p>But with this in mind, as soon as the utter dark shut down, he swerved
  Sally to the right and worked slowly up through the mountains, heading due
  southwest and out of the valley of the Little Silver. He kept at it, through
  a district where the mare could not even trot a great deal of the time, for
  two or more hours. Then he found a little plateau thick with good grazing for
  Sally and with a spring near it. There he camped for the night, without food,
  without fire.</p>

  <p>And not once during the hours before morning did he close his eyes. When
  the first gray touched the sky he was in the saddle again; before the sun was
  up he had crossed the Las Casas and was going down the great shallow basin of
  the Roydon River. A fine, drizzling rain was falling, and Sally, tired from
  her hard work of the day before and the long duels with the horses of the
  posse, went even more down-heartedly moody than usual, shuffling wearily, but
  recovering herself with her usual catlike adroitness whenever her footing
  failed on the steep downslope.</p>

  <p>For all her dullness, it was a signal from Sally that saved Andrew. She
  jerked up her head and turned; he looked in the same direction and saw a form
  like a gray ghost coming over the hills to his left, a dim shape through the
  rain. Gloomily Andrew watched Hal Dozier come. Gray Peter had been fresher
  than Sally at the end of the run of the day before. He was fresher now.
  Andrew could tell that easily by the stretch of his gallop and the evenness
  of his pace as he rushed across the slope. He gave the word to Sally. She
  tossed up her head in mute rebellion at this new call for a race, and then
  broke into a canter whose first few strides, by way of showing her anger,
  were as choppy and lifeless as the stride of a plow horse.</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of the famous ride from the Las Casas mountains to
  the Roydon range, and all the distance across the Roydon valley. It started
  with a five-mile sprint&mdash;literally five miles of hot racing in which
  each horse did its best. And in that five miles Gray Peter would most
  unquestionably have won had not one bit of luck fallen the mare. A hedge of
  young evergreen streaked before Sally, and Andrew put her at the mark; she
  cleared it like a bird, jumping easily and landing in her stride. It was not
  the first time she had jumped with Andrew.</p>

  <p>But Gray Peter was not a steeplechaser. He had not been trained to it, and
  he refused. His rider had to whirl and go up the line of shrubs until he
  found a place to break through. Then he was after Sally again. But the moment
  that Andrew saw the marshal had been stopped he did not use the interim to
  push the mare and increase her lead. Very wisely he drew her back to the
  long, rocking canter which was her natural gait, and Sally got the breath
  which Gray Peter had run out of her. She also regained priceless lost ground,
  and when the gray came in view of the quarry again his work was all to do
  over again. Hal Dozier tried again in straightaway running. It had been his
  boast that nothing under the saddle in the mountain desert could keep away
  from him in a stretch of any distance, and he rode Gray Peter desperately to
  make his boast good. He failed. If that first stretch had been
  unbroken&mdash;but there his chance was gone, and, starting the second spurt,
  Andrew came to realize one greatly important truth&mdash;Sally could not
  sprint for any distance, but up to a certain pace she ran easily and without
  labor. He made it his point to see that she was never urged beyond that pace.
  He found another thing, that she took a hill in far better style than Peter,
  and she did far better in the rough, but on the level going he ate up her
  handicap swiftly.</p>

  <p>With a strength of his own found and a weakness in his pursuer, Andrew
  played remorselessly to that weakness with his strength. He sought the choppy
  ground as a preference and led the stallion through it wherever he could; he
  swung to the right, where there was a stretch of rolling hills, and once more
  Gray Peter had a losing space before him.</p>

  <p>So they came to the river itself, with Gray Peter comfortably in the rear,
  but running well within his strength. Andrew paused in the shallows to allow
  Sally one swallow; then he went on. But Dozier did not pause for even this.
  It was a grave mistake.</p>

  <p>And so the miles wore on. Sally was still running like a swallow for
  lightness, but Andrew knew by her breathing that she was giving vital
  strength to the effort. He talked to her constantly. He told her how Gray
  Peter ran behind them. He encouraged her with pet words. And Sally seemed to
  understand, for she flicked one ear back to listen, and then she pricked them
  both and kept at her work.</p>

  <p>It was a heart-tearing thing to see her run to the point of lather and
  then keep on.</p>

  <p>They were in low hills, and Gray Peter was losing steadily. They reached a
  broad flat, and the stallion gained with terrible insistence. Looking back,
  Andrew could see that the marshal had stripped away every vestige of his
  pack. He followed that example with a groan. And still Gray Peter gained.</p>

  <p>It was the last great effort for the stallion. Before them rose the
  foothills of the Roydon mountains; behind them the Las Casas range was lost
  in mist. It seemed that they had been galloping like this for an infinity of
  time, and Andrew was numb from the shoulders down. If he reached those hills
  Gray Peter was beaten. He knew it; Hal Dozier knew it; and the two great
  horses gave all their strength to the last duel of the race.</p>

  <p>The ears of Sally no longer pricked. They lay flat on her neck. The
  amazing lift was gone from her gait, and she pounded heavily with the
  forelegs. And still she struggled on. He looked back, and Gray Peter still
  gained, an inch at a time, and his stride did not seem to have abated. The
  one bitter question now was whether Sally would not collapse under the
  effort. With every lurch of her feet, Andrew expected to feel her crumble
  beneath him. And yet she went on. She was all heart, all nerve, and running
  on it. Behind her came Gray Peter, and he also ran with his head stretched
  out.</p>

  <p>He was within rifle range now. Why did not Dozier fire? Perhaps he had set
  his heart on actually running Sally down, not dropping his prey with a
  distant shot.</p>

  <p>And still they flew across the flat. The hills were close now, and
  sometimes, when the drizzling rain lifted, it seemed that the Roydon
  mountains were exactly above them, leaning out over him like a shadow. He
  called on Sally again and again. He touched her for the first time in her
  life with spurs, and she found something in the depths of her heart and her
  courage to answer with. She ran again with a ghost of her former buoyancy,
  and Gray Peter was held even. Not an inch could he gain after that. Andrew
  saw his pursuer raise his quirt and flog. It was useless. Each horse was
  running itself out, and no power could get more speed out of the pounding
  limbs.</p>

  <p>And with his head still turned, Andrew felt a shock and flounder. Sally
  had almost fallen. He jerked sharply up on the reins, and she broke into a
  staggering trot. Then Andrew saw that they had struck the slope of the first
  hill, a long, smooth rise which she would have taken at full speed in the
  beginning of the race, but now though she labored bitterly, she could not
  raise a gallop. The trot was her best effort.</p>

  <p>There was a shrill yelling behind, and Andrew saw Dozier, a hand
  brandished above his head. He had seen Sally break down; Gray Peter would
  catch her; his horse would win that famous duel of speed and courage. Rifle?
  He had forgotten his rifle. He would go in, he would overhaul Sally, and then
  finish the chase with a play of revolvers. And in expectation of that end,
  Andrew drew his revolver. It hung the length of his arm; he found that his
  muscles were numb from the cold and the cramped position from the elbow down.
  Shoot? He was as helpless as though he had no gun at all. He beat his hands
  together to bring back the blood. He thrashed his arms against the pommel of
  the saddle. There was only a dull pain; it would take long minutes to bring
  those hands back to the point of service, and in the meantime Gray Peter
  galloped upon him from behind!</p>

  <p>Well, he would let Sally do her best. For the last time he called on her;
  for the last time she struggled to respond, and Andrew looked back and grimly
  watched the stallion sweeping across the last portion of the flat ground,
  closer, closer, and then, at the very base of the slope, Gray Peter tossed up
  his head, floundered, and went down, hurling his rider over his head. Andrew,
  fascinated, let Sally fall into a walk, while he watched the singular,
  convulsive struggles of Gray Peter to gain his feet. Hal Dozier was up again;
  he ran to his horse, caught his head, and at the same moment the stallion
  grew suddenly limp. The weight of his head dragged the marshal down, and then
  Andrew saw that Dozier made no effort to rise again.</p>

  <p>He sat with the head of the horse in his lap, his own head buried in his
  hands, and Andrew knew then that Gray Peter was dead.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32"></a>CHAPTER 32</h2>

  <p class="first">The mare herself was in a far from safe condition. And if
  the marshal had roused himself from his grief and hurried up the slope on
  foot he would have found the fugitive out of the saddle and walking by the
  side of the played-out Sally, forcing her with slaps on the hip to keep in
  motion. She went on, stumbling, her head down, and the sound of her breathing
  was a horrible thing to hear. But she must keep in motion, for, if she
  stopped in this condition, Sally would never run again.</p>

  <p>Andrew forced her relentlessly on. At length her head came up a little and
  her breathing was easier and easier. Before dark that night he came on a
  deserted shanty, and there he took Sally under the shelter, and, tearing up
  the floor, he built a fire which dried them both. The following day he walked
  again, with Sally following like a dog at his heels. One day later he was in
  the saddle again, and Sally was herself once more. Give her one feed of
  grain, and she would have run again that famous race from beginning to end.
  But Andrew, stealing out of the Roydon mountains into the lower ground, had
  no thought of another race. He was among a district of many houses, many men,
  and, for the final stage of his journey, he waited until after dusk had come
  and then saddled Sally and cantered into the valley.</p>

  <p>It was late on the fourth night after he left Los Toros that Andrew came
  again to the house of John Merchant and left Sally in the very place among
  the trees where the pinto had stood before. There was no danger of discovery
  on his approach, for it was a wild night of wind and rain. The drizzling
  mists of the last three days had turned into a steady downpour, and rivers of
  water had been running from his slicker on the way to the ranch house. Now he
  put the slicker behind the saddle, and from the shelter of the trees surveyed
  the house.</p>

  <p>It was bursting with music and light; sometimes the front door was opened
  and voices stole out to him; sometimes even through the closed door he heard
  the ghostly tinkling of some girl's laughter.</p>

  <p>And that was to Andrew the most melancholy sound in the world.</p>

  <p>The rain, trickling even through the foliage of the evergreen, decided him
  to act at once. It might be that all the noise and light were, after all, an
  advantage to him, and, running close to the ground, he skulked across the
  dangerous open stretch and came into the safe shadow of the wall of the
  house.</p>

  <p>Once there, it was easy to go up to the roof by one of the rain pipes, the
  same low roof from which he had escaped on the time of his last visit. On the
  roof the rush and drumming of the rain quite covered any sound he made, but
  he was drenched before he reached the window of Anne's room. Could he be sure
  that on her second visit she would have the same room? He settled that by a
  single glance. The curtain was not drawn, and a lamp, turned low, burned on
  the table beside the bed. The room was quite empty.</p>

  <p>The window was fastened, but he worked back the fastening iron with the
  blade of his knife and raised himself into the room. He closed the window
  behind him. At once the noise of rain and the shouting of the wind faded off
  into a distance, and the voices of the house came more clearly to him. But he
  dared not stay to listen, for the water was dripping around him; he must move
  before a large dark spot showed on the carpet, and he saw, moreover, exactly
  where he could best hide. There was a heavily curtained alcove at one end of
  the room, and behind this shelter he hid himself.</p>

  <p>And here he waited. How would she come? Would there be someone with her?
  Would she come laughing, with all the triumph of the dance bright in her
  face?</p>

  <p>Vaguely he heard the shrill droning of the violins die away beneath him,
  and the slipping of many dancing feet on a smooth floor fell to a whisper and
  then ceased. Voices sounded in the hall, but he gave no heed to the meaning
  of all this. Not even the squawking of horns, as automobiles drove away,
  conveyed any thought to him; he wished that this moment could be suspended to
  an eternity.</p>

  <p>Parties of people were going down the hall; he heard soft flights of
  laughter and many young voices. People were calling gaily to one another and
  then by an inner sense rather than by a sound he knew that the door was
  opened into the room. He leaned and looked, and he saw Anne Withero close the
  door behind her and lean against it. In the joy of her triumph that
  evening?</p>

  <p>No, her head was fallen, and he saw the gleam of her hand at her breast.
  He could not see her face clearly, but the bent head spoke eloquently of
  defeat. She came forward at length. Thinking of her as the reigning power in
  that dance and all the merriment below him, Andrew had been imagining her
  tall, strong, with compelling eyes commanding admiration. He found all at
  once that she was small, very small; and her hair was not that keen fire
  which he had pictured. It was simply a coppery glow, marvelously delicate,
  molding her face. She went to a great full-length mirror. She raised her head
  for one instant to look at her image, and then she bowed her head again and
  placed her hand against the edge of the mirror for support. Little by little,
  through the half light, he was making her out and now the curve of this arm,
  from wrist to shoulder, went through Andrew like a phrase of music. He
  stepped out from behind the curtain, and, at the sound of the cloth swishing
  back into place, she whirled on him.</p>

  <p>She was speechless; her raised hand did not fall; it was as if she were
  frozen where she stood.</p>

  <p>"I shall leave you at once," said Andrew quietly, "if you are frightened.
  You have only to tell me."</p>

  <p>He had come closer. Now he was astonished to see her turn swiftly toward
  the door and touch his arm with her hand. "Hush!" she said. "Hush! They may
  hear you!"</p>

  <p>She glided to the door into the hall and turned the lock softly and came
  to him again.</p>

  <p>It made Andrew weak to see her so close, and he searched her face with a
  hungry and jealous fear, lest she should be different from his dream of her.
  "You are the same," he said with a sigh of relief. "And you are not afraid of
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Hush! Hush!" she repeated. "Afraid of you? Don't you see that I'm happy,
  happy, happy to see you again?"</p>

  <p>She drew him forward a little, and her hand touched his as she did so. She
  turned up the lamp, and a flood of strong yellow light went over the room.
  "But you have changed," said Anne Withero with a little cry. "Oh, you have
  changed! They've been hounding you&mdash;the cowards!"</p>

  <p>"Does it make no difference to you&mdash;that I have killed a man."</p>

  <p>"Ah, it was that brother to the Dozier man. But I've learned about him. He
  was a bloodhound like his brother, but treacherous. Besides, it was in fair
  fight. Fair fight? It was one against six!"</p>

  <p>"Don't," said Andrew, breathing hard, "don't say that! You make me feel
  that it's almost right to have done what I've done. But besides him&mdash;all
  the rest&mdash;do they make no difference?"</p>

  <p>"All of what?"</p>

  <p>"People say things about me. They even print them." He winced as he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>But she was fierce again; her passion made her tremble.</p>

  <p>"When I think of it!" she murmured. "When I think of it, the rotten
  injustice makes me want to choke 'em all! Why, today I heard&mdash;I can't
  repeat it. It makes me sick&mdash;sick! Why, they've hounded you and bullied
  you until they've made you think you are bad, Andrew. They've even made you a
  little bit proud of the hard things people say about you. Isn't that
  true?"</p>

  <p>Was it any wonder that Andrew could not answer? He felt all at once so
  supple that he was hot tallow which those small fingers would mold and bend
  to suit themselves.</p>

  <p>"Sit down here!" she commanded.</p>

  <p>Meekly he obeyed. He sat on the edge of his chair, with his hat held with
  both hands, and his eyes widened as he stared at her&mdash;like a person
  coming out of a great darkness into a great light.</p>

  <p>And tears came into the eyes of the girl.</p>

  <p>"You're as thin as a starved&mdash;wolf," she said, and closed her eyes
  and shuddered. "And all the time I've been thinking of you as you were when I
  saw you here before&mdash;the same clear, steady eyes and the same direct
  smile. But they've made you older&mdash;they've burned the boy out of you
  with pain! And I've been thinking about you just cantering through wild, gay
  adventures. Are you ill now?"</p>

  <p>He had leaned back in the chair and gathered his hat close to his breast,
  crushing it.</p>

  <p>"I'm not ill," said Andrew. His voice was hoarse and thick. "I'm just
  listening to you. Go on and talk."</p>

  <p>"About you?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"I don't hear your words&mdash;hardly; I just hear the sound you make." He
  leaned forward again and cast out his arm so that the palm of his hand was
  turned up beneath her eyes. She could see the long, lean fingers. It suddenly
  came home to her that every strong man in the mountain desert was in deadly
  terror of that hand. Anne Withero was shaken for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," he was saying in that tense whisper which was oddly like
  the tremor of his hand, "I've been hungry for that voice all these weeks
  &mdash;and months."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," said the girl, very grave. "I'm
  going to break up this cowardly conspiracy against you. I've written to my
  father to get the finest lawyer in the land and send him out here to make you
  &mdash;legal&mdash;again."</p>

  <p>He began to smile, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's no use," he said. "Perhaps your lawyer could help me on account of
  Bill's death, but he couldn't help me from Hal."</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;do you mean you're going to fight the other man, too?"</p>

  <p>"He killed his horse chasing me," said Andrew. "I couldn't stop to fight
  him because I was comin' down here to see you. But when I go away I've got to
  find him and give him a chance back at me. It's only fair."</p>

  <p>"Because he killed a horse trying to get you, you're going to give him a
  chance to shoot you?"</p>

  <p>Her voice had become shrill. She lowered it instinctively toward the end
  and cast a glance of apprehension toward the door.</p>

  <p>"You are quite mad," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand," said Andrew. "His horse was Gray Peter&mdash; the
  stallion. And I would rather have killed a man than have seen Gray Peter die.
  Hal had Peter's head in his arms," he added softly. "And he'll never give up
  the trail until he's had it out with me. He wouldn't be half a man if he let
  things drop now."</p>

  <p>"So you have to fight Hal Dozier?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But when that's done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When that's done one of us will be dead. If it's me, of course, there's
  no use worryin'; if it's Hal, of course, I'm done in the eyes of the law. Two
  &mdash;murders!"</p>

  <p>His eyes glinted and his fingers quivered. It sent a cold thrill through
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"But they say he's a terrible man, Andrew. You wouldn't let him catch
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I won't stand and wait for him," said Andrew gravely. "But if we fight I
  think I'll kill him."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?" She was more curious than shocked.</p>

  <p>"It's just a sort of feeling that you get when you look at a man; either
  you're his master or you aren't. You see it in a flash."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen your master?" asked the girl slowly.</p>

  <p>"I'll want to die when I see that," he said simply.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she clenched her hands and sat straight up.</p>

  <p>"It's got to be stopped," she said hotly. "It's all nonsense, and I'm
  going to see that you're both stopped." "Four days ago," he said, "you could
  have taken me in the hollow of your hand. I would have come to you and gone
  from you at a nod. That time is about to end."</p>

  <p>He paused a little, and looked at her in such a manner that she was
  frightened, but it was a pleasant fear. It made her interlace her fingers
  with nervous anxiety, but it set a fire in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"That time is ending," said Andrew. "You are about to be married."</p>

  <p>"And after that you will never look at me again, never think of me
  again?"</p>

  <p>"I hope not," he answered. "I strongly hope not."</p>

  <p>"But why? Is a marriage a blot or a stain?"</p>

  <p>"It is a barrier," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Even to thoughts? Even to friendship?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>A very strange thing happened in the excited mind of Anne Withero. It
  seemed to her that Charles Merchant sat, a filmy ghost, beside this tattered
  fugitive. He was speaking the same words that Andrew spoke, but his voice and
  his manner were to Andrew Lanning what moonshine is to sunlight. She had been
  thinking of Charles Merchant as a social asset; she began to think of him now
  as a possessing force. Anne Withero possessed by Charlie Merchant!</p>

  <p>"What you have told me," she said, "means more than you may think to me.
  Have you come all this distance to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"All this distance to talk?" he said. He seemed to sit back and wonder.
  "Have I traveled four days?" he went on. "Has Gray Peter died, and have I
  been under Hal Dozier's rifle only to speak to you?" He suddenly recalled
  himself.</p>

  <p>"No, no! I have come to give you a wedding present."</p>

  <p>He watched her color change.</p>

  <p>"Are you angry? Is it wrong to give you a present?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered in a singular, stifled voice. "It is this watch." It
  was a large gold watch and a chain of very old make that he put into her
  hand. "It is for your son," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>She stood up; he rose instinctively.</p>

  <p>"When I look at it I'm to remember that you are forgetting me?"</p>

  <p>A little hush fell upon them.</p>

  <p>"Are you laughing at me, Anne?"</p>

  <p>He had never called her by her name before, and yet it came naturally upon
  his lips.</p>

  <p>She stood, indeed, with the same smile upon her lips, but her eyes were
  fixed and looked straight past him. And presently he saw a tear pass slowly
  down her face. Her hand remained without moving, with the watch in it exactly
  as he had placed it there.</p>

  <p>She had not stirred when he slipped without a noise through the window and
  was instantly swallowed in the rushing of the wind and rain.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33"></a>CHAPTER 33</h2>

  <p class="first">There was, as Andrew had understood for a long time, a sort
  of underground world of criminals even here on the mountain desert. Otherwise
  the criminals could not have existed for even a moment in the face of the
  organized strength of lawful society. Several times in the course of his
  wanderings Andrew had come in contact with links of the underground chain,
  and he learned what every fugitive learns&mdash;the safe stopping points in
  the great circuit of his flight.</p>

  <p>Three elements went into the making of that hidden society. There was
  first of all the circulating and active part, and this was composed of men
  actually known to be under the ban of the law and openly defying it. Beneath
  this active group lay a stratum much larger which served as a base for the
  operating criminals. This stratum was built entirely of men who had at one
  time been incriminated in shady dealings of one sort and another. It included
  lawbreakers from every part of the world, men who had fled first of all to
  the shelter of the mountain desert and who had lived there until their past
  was even forgotten in the lands from which they came. But they had never lost
  the inevitable sympathy for their more active fellows, and in this class
  there was included a meaner element&mdash;men who had in the past committed
  crimes in the mountain desert itself and who, from time to time, when they
  saw an absolutely safe opportunity, were perfectly ready and willing to sin
  again.</p>

  <p>The third and largest of all the elements in the criminal world of the
  desert was a shifting and changing class of men who might be called the paid
  adherents of the active order. The "long riders," acting in groups or singly,
  fled after the commission of a crime and were forced to find places of rest
  and concealment along their journey. Under this grave necessity they quickly
  learned what people on their way could be hired as hosts and whose silence
  and passive aid could be bought. Such men were secured in the first place by
  handsome bribes. And very often they joined the ranks unwillingly. But when
  some peaceful householder was confronted by a desperate man, armed, on a
  weary horse&mdash;perhaps stained from a wound&mdash;the householder was by
  no means ready to challenge the man's right to hospitality. He never knew
  when the stranger would take by force what was refused to him freely, and, if
  the lawbreaker took by force, he was apt to cover his trail by a fresh
  killing.</p>

  <p>Of course, such killings took place only when the "long rider" was a
  desperate brute rather than a man, but enough of them had occurred to call up
  vivid examples to every householder who was accosted. As a rule he submitted
  to receive the unwelcome guest. Also, as a rule, he was weak enough to accept
  a gift when the stranger parted. Once such a gift was taken, he was lost. His
  name was instantly passed on by the fugitive to his fellows as a "safe" man.
  Before long he became, against or with his will, a depository of secrets
  &mdash;banned faces became known to him. And if he suddenly decided to
  withdraw from that criminal world his case was most precarious.</p>

  <p>The "long riders" admitted no neutrals. If a man had once been with them
  he could only leave them to become an enemy. He became open prey. His name
  was published abroad. Then his cattle were apt to disappear. His stacks of
  hay might catch fire unexpectedly at night. His house itself might be
  plundered, and, in not infrequent cases, the man himself was brutally
  murdered. It was part of a code no less binding because it was unwritten.</p>

  <p>All of this Andrew was more or less aware of, and scores of names had been
  mentioned to him by chance acquaintances of the road. Such names he stored
  away, for he had always felt that time impending of which Henry Allister had
  warned him, the time when he must openly forget his scruples and take to a
  career of crime. That time, he now knew, was come upon him.</p>

  <p>It would be misrepresenting Andrew to say that he shrank from the future.
  Rather he accepted everything that lay before him wholeheartedly, and, with
  the laying aside of his scruples, there was an instant lightening of the
  heart, a fierce keenness of mind, a contempt for society, a disregard for
  life beginning with his own. One could have noted it in the recklessness with
  which he sent Sally up the slope away from the ranch house this night.</p>

  <p>He had made up his mind immediately to hunt out a "safe" man, recently
  mentioned to him by that unconscionable scapegrace Harry Woods, crooked
  gambler, thief of small and large, and whilom murderer. The man's name was
  Garry Baldwin, a small rancher, some half day's ride above Sullivan's place
  in the valley. He was recommended as a man of silence. In that direction
  Andrew took his way, but, coming in the hills to a dished-out place on a
  hillside, where there was a natural shelter from both wind and rain, he
  stopped there for the rest of the night, cooked a meal, rolled himself in his
  blankets, and slept into the gray of the morning.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the first light streaking the horizon to the east than
  Andrew wakened. He saddled Sally and, after a leisurely breakfast, started at
  a jog trot through the hills, taking the upslope with the utmost care. For
  nothing so ruins a horse as hard work uphill at the very beginning of the
  day. He gave Sally her head, and by letting her go as she pleased she topped
  the divide, breathing as easily as if she had been walking on the flat. She
  gave one toss of her head as she saw the long, smooth slope ahead of her, and
  then, without a word from Andrew or a touch of his heels, she gave herself up
  to the long, rocking canter which she could maintain so tirelessly for hour
  on hour.</p>

  <p>A clear, cold morning came on. Indeed, it was rarely chill for the
  mountain desert, with a feel of coming snow in the wind. Sally pricked one
  ear as she looked into the north, and Andrew knew that that was a sign of
  trouble coming.</p>

  <p>He came in the middle of the morning to the house of Garry Baldwin. It was
  a wretched shack, the roof sagged in the middle, and the building had been
  held from literally falling apart by bolting an iron rod through the length
  of it.</p>

  <p>A woman who fitted well into such a background kicked open the door and
  looked up to Andrew with the dishwater still dripping from her red hands. He
  asked for her husband. He was gone from the house. Where, she did not know.
  Somewhere yonder, and her gesture included half the width of the horizon to
  the west. There was his trail, if Andrew wished to follow it. For her part,
  she was busy and could not spare time to gossip. At that she stepped back and
  kicked the door shut with a slam that set the whole side of the shack
  shivering.</p>

  <p>At that moment Andrew wondered what he would have done when he lived in
  Martindale if he had been treated in such a manner. He would have crimsoned
  to the eyes, no doubt, and fled from the virago. But now he felt neither
  embarrassment nor fear nor anger. He drew his revolver, and with the heavy
  butt banged loudly on the door. It left three deep dents in the wood, and the
  door was kicked open again. But this time he saw only the foot of the woman
  clad in a man's boot. The door remained open, but the hostess kept out of
  view.</p>

  <p>"You be ridin' on, friend," she called in her harsh voice. "Bud, keep
  out'n the kitchen. Stranger, you be ridin' on. I don't know you and I don't
  want to know you. A man that beats on doors with his gun!"</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed, and the sound brought her into view, a furious face, but a
  curious face as well. She carried a long rifle slung easily under her stout
  arm.</p>

  <p>"What d'you want with Garry?" she asked.</p>

  <p>And he replied with a voice equally hard: "I want direction for finding
  Scar-faced Allister."</p>

  <p>He watched that shot shake her.</p>

  <p>"You do? You got a hell of a nerve askin' around here for Allister! Slope,
  kid, slope. You're on a cold trail."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," protested Andrew. "You need another look at me."</p>

  <p>"I can see all there is to you the first glance," said the woman calmly.
  "Why should I look again?"</p>

  <p>"To see the reward," said Andrew bitterly. He laughed again. "I'm Andrew
  Lanning. Ever hear of me?"</p>

  <p>It was obvious that she had. She blinked and winced as though the name
  stunned her. "Lanning!" she said. "Why, you ain't much more'n a kid. Lanning!
  And you're him?"</p>

  <p>All at once she melted.</p>

  <p>"Slide off your hoss and come in, Andy," she said. "Dogged if I knew you
  at all!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I want to find Allister and I'm in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"So you and him are goin' to team it? That'll be high times! Come here,
  Bud. Look at Andy Lanning. That's him on the horse right before you."</p>

  <p>A scared, round face peered out at Andrew from behind his mother. "All
  right, partner. I'll tell you where to find him pretty close. He'll be up the
  gulch along about now. You know the old shack up there? You can get to him
  inside three hours&mdash;with that hoss." She stopped and eyed Sally. "Is
  that the one that run Gray Peter to death? She don't look the part, but them
  long, low hosses is deceivin'. Can't you stay, Andy? Well, s'long. And give
  Allister a good word from Bess Baldwin. Luck!"</p>

  <p>He waved, and was gone at a brisk gallop.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34"></a>CHAPTER 34</h2>

  <p class="first">It was not yet noon when he entered the gulch, he was part
  way up the ravine when something moved at the top of the high wall to his
  right. He guessed at once that it was a lookout signaling the main party of
  the approach of a stranger, so Andrew stopped Sally with a word and held his
  hand high above his head, facing the point from which he had seen the
  movement. There was a considerable pause; then a man showed on the top of the
  cliff, and Andrew recognized Jeff Rankin by his red hair. Yet they were at
  too great a distance for conversation, and after waving a greeting, Rankin
  merely beckoned Andrew on his way up the valley. Around the very next bend of
  the ravine he found the camp. It was of the most impromptu character, and the
  warning of Rankin had caused them to break it up precipitately, as Andrew
  could see by one length of tarpaulin tossed, without folding, over a saddle.
  Each of the four was ready, beside his horse, for flight or for attack, as
  their outlook on the cliff should give signal. But at sight of Andrew and the
  bay mare a murmur, then a growl of interest went among them. Even Larry la
  Roche grinned a skull-like welcome, and Henry Allister actually ran forward
  to receive the newcomer. Andrew dropped out of the saddle and shook hands
  with him.</p>

  <p>"I've done as you said I would," said Andrew. "I've run in a circle,
  Allister, and now I'm back to make one of you, if you still want me."</p>

  <p>Allister, laughing joyously, turned to the other three and repeated the
  question to them. There was only one voice in answer.</p>

  <p>"Want you?" said Allister, and his smile made Andrew almost forget the
  scar which twisted the otherwise handsome face. "Want you? Why, man, if we've
  been beyond the law up to this time, we can laugh at the law now. Sit down.
  Hey, Scottie, shake up the fire and put on some coffee, will you? We'll take
  an hour off."</p>

  <p>Larry la Roche was observed to make a dour face.</p>

  <p>"Who'll tell me it's lucky," he said, "to have a gent that starts out by
  makin' us all stop on the trail? Is that a good sign?"</p>

  <p>But Scottie, with laughter, hushed him. Yet Larry la Roche remained of all
  the rest quite silent during the making of the coffee and the drinking of it.
  The others kept up a running fire of comments and questions, but Larry la
  Roche, as though he had never forgiven Andrew for their first quarrel,
  remained with his long, bony chin dropped upon his breast and followed the
  movements of Andrew Lanning with restless eyes.</p>

  <p>The others were glad to see him, as Andrew could tell at a glance, but
  also they were a bit troubled, and by degrees he made out the reason. Strange
  as it seemed, they regretted that he had not been able to make his break
  across the mountains. His presence made them more impregnable than they had
  ever been under the indomitable Allister, and yet, more than the aid of his
  fighting hand, they would have welcomed the tidings of a man who had broken
  away from the shadow of the law and made good. For each of the fallen wishes
  to feel that his exile is self-terminable.</p>

  <p>And therefore Andrew, telling his story to them in brief, found that they
  were not by any means filled with unmixed pleasure. Joe Clune, with his
  bright brown hair of youth and his lined, haggard face of worn middle age,
  summed up their sentiments at the end of Andrew's story: "You're what we need
  with us, Lanning. You and Allister will beat the world, and it means high
  times for the rest of us, but God pity you&mdash;that's all!"</p>

  <p>The pause that followed this solemn speech was to Andrew like an amen. He
  glanced from face to face, and each stern eye met his in gloomy sympathy.</p>

  <p>Then something shot through him which was to his mind what red is to the
  eye; it was a searing touch of reckless indifference, defiance.</p>

  <p>"Forget this prayer-meeting talk," said Andrew. "I came up here for
  action, not mourning. I want something to do with my hands, not something to
  think about with my head!"</p>

  <p>Something to think about! It was like a terror behind him. If he should
  have long quiet it would steal on him and look at him over his shoulder like
  a face. A little of this showed in his face; enough to make the circle flash
  significant glances at one another.</p>

  <p>"You got something behind you, Andy," said Scottie. "Come out with it. It
  ain't too bad for us to hear."</p>

  <p>"There's something behind me," said Andrew. "It's the one really decent
  part of my life. And I don't want to think about it. Allister, they say you
  never let the grass grow under you. What's on your hands now?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been flattering me," said the leader quietly, and all the
  time he kept studying the face of Andrew. "We have a little game ahead, if
  you want to come in on it. We're shorthanded, but I'd try it with you. That
  makes us six all told. Six enough, boys?"</p>

  <p>"Count me half of one," said Larry la Roche. "I don't feel lucky about
  this little party."</p>

  <p>"We'll count you two times two," replied the leader. He added: "You boys
  play a game; I'm going to break in Lanning to our job."</p>

  <p>Taking his horse, he and Andrew rode at a walk up the ravine. On the way
  the leader explained his system briefly and clearly. Told in short, he worked
  somewhat as follows: Instead of raiding blindly right and left, he only moved
  when he had planned every inch of ground for the advance and the blow and the
  retreat. To make sure of success and the size of his stakes he was willing to
  invest heavily.</p>

  <p>"Big business men sink half a year's income in their advertising. I do the
  same."</p>

  <p>It was not public advertising; it was money cunningly expended where it
  would do most good. Fifty per cent of the money the gang earned was laid away
  to make future returns surer. In twenty places Allister had his paid men who,
  working from behind the scenes, gained priceless information and sent word of
  it to the outlaw. Trusted officials in great companies were in communication
  with him. When large shipments of gold were to be made, for instance, he was
  often warned beforehand. Every dollar of the consignment was known to him,
  the date of its shipment, its route, and the hands to which it was supposed
  to fall. Or, again, in many a bank and prosperous mercantile firm in the
  mountain desert he had inserted his paid spies, who let him know when the
  safe was crammed with cash and by what means the treasure was guarded.</p>

  <p>Not until he had secured such information did the leader move. And he
  still delayed until every possible point of friction had been noted, every
  danger considered, and a check appointed for it, every method of advance and
  retreat gone over.</p>

  <p>"A good general," Allister was fond of saying, "plans in two ways: for an
  absolute victory and for an absolute defeat. The one enables him to squeeze
  the last ounce of success out of a triumph; the other keeps a failure from
  turning into a catastrophe."</p>

  <p>With everything arranged for the stroke, he usually posted himself with
  the band as far as possible from the place where the actual work was to be
  done. Then he made a feint in the opposite direction&mdash;he showed himself
  or a part of his gang recklessly. The moment the alarm was given&mdash;even
  at the risk of having an entire hostile countryside around him&mdash;he
  started a whirlwind course in the opposite direction from which he was
  generally supposed to be traveling. If possible, at the ranches of adherents,
  or at out-of-the-way places where confederates could act, he secured fresh
  horses and dashed on at full speed all the way.</p>

  <p>Then, at the very verge of the place for attack, he gathered his men,
  rehearsed in detail what each man was to do, delivered the blow, secured the
  spoils, and each man of the party split away from the others and fled in
  scattering directions, to assemble again at a distant point on a
  comparatively distant date. There they sat down around a council table, and
  there they divided the spoils. No matter how many were employed, no matter
  how vast a proportion of the danger and scheming had been borne by the
  leader, he took no more than two shares. Then fifty per cent of the prize was
  set aside. The rest was divided with an exact care among the remaining
  members of the gang. The people who had supplied the requisite information
  for the coup were always given their share.</p>

  <p>From this general talk Allister descended to particulars. He talked of the
  gang itself. They were quite a fixed quantity. In the last half dozen years
  there had not been three casualties. For one thing, he chose his men with
  infinite care; in the second place, he saw to it that they remained in
  harmony, and to that end he was careful never to be tempted into forming an
  unwieldy crew, no matter how large the prize. Of the present organization
  each was an expert. Larry la Roche had been a counterfeiter and was a
  consummate penman. His forgeries were works of art. "Have you noticed his
  hands?"</p>

  <p>Scottie Macdougal was an eminent advance agent, whose smooth tongue was
  the thing for the very dangerous and extremely important work of trying out
  new sources of information, noting the dependability of those sources, and
  understanding just how far and in what line the tools could be used. Joe
  Clune was a past expert in the blowing of safes; not only did he know
  everything that was to be known about means of guarding money and how to
  circumvent them, but he was an artist with the "soup," as Allister called
  nitroglycerin.</p>

  <p>Jeff Rankin, without a mental equipment to compare with his companions,
  was often invaluable on account of his prodigious strength. Under the strain
  of his muscles, iron bars bent like hot wax. In addition he had more than his
  share of an ability which all the members of the gang possessed&mdash;an
  infinite cunning in the use of weapons and a star-storming courage and self-
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"And where," said Andrew at the end of this long recital, "do I fit
  in?"</p>

  <p>"You begin," said Allister, "as the least valuable of my men; before six
  months you will be worth the whole set of 'em. You'll start as my lieutenant,
  Lanning. The boys expect it. You've built up a reputation that counts. They
  admit your superiority without question. Larry la Roche squirms under the
  weight of it, but he admits it like the rest of' em. In a pinch they would
  obey you nearly as well as they obey me. It means that, having you to take
  charge, I can do what I've always wanted to do&mdash;I can give the main body
  the slip and go off for advance-guard and rear-guard duty. I don't dare to do
  it now.</p>

  <p>"Do you know why? Those fellows yonder, who seem so chummy, would be at
  each other's throats in ten seconds if I weren't around to keep them in
  order. I know why you're here, Lanning. It isn't the money. It's the cursed
  fear of loneliness and the fear of having time to think. You want action,
  action to fill your mind and blind you. That's what I offer you. You're the
  keeper of the four wildcats you see over there. You start in with their
  respect. Let them lose their fear of you for a moment and they'll go for you.
  Treat them like men; think of them as wild beasts. That's what they are. The
  minute they know you're without your whip they go for you like tigers at a
  wounded trainer. One taste of meat is all they need to madden them. It's
  different with me. I'm wild, too."</p>

  <p>His eyes gleamed at Andrew.</p>

  <p>"And, if they raise you, I think they'll find you've more iron hidden away
  in you than I have. But the way they'll find it out will be in an explosion
  that will wipe them out. You've got to handle them without that explosion,
  Lanning. Can you do it?"</p>

  <p>The younger man moistened his lips. "I think this job is going to prove
  worth while," he returned.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. But there are penalties in your new position. In a pinch
  you've got to do what I do&mdash;see that they have food enough&mdash; go
  without sleep if one of them needs your blankets&mdash;if any of 'em gets in
  trouble, even into a jail, you've got to get him out."</p>

  <p>"Better still," smiled Andrew.</p>

  <p>"And now," said the leader, "I'll tell you about our next job as we go
  back to the boys."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35"></a>CHAPTER 35</h2>

  <p class="first">It was ten days later when the band dropped out of the
  mountains into the Murchison Pass&mdash;a singular place for a train robbery,
  Andrew could not help thinking. They were at the southwestern end of the
  pass, where the mountains gave back in a broad gap. Below them, not five
  miles away, was the city of Gidding Creek; they could see its buildings and
  parks tumbled over a big area, for there was a full twenty-five thousand of
  inhabitants in Gidding Creek. Indeed, the whole country was dotted with
  villages and towns, for it was no longer a cattle region, but a semifarming
  district cut up into small tracts. One was almost never out of sight of at
  least one house.</p>

  <p>It worried Andrew, this closely built country, and he knew that it worried
  the other men as well; yet there had not been a single murmur from among them
  as they jogged their horses on behind Allister. Each of them was swathed from
  head to heels in a vast slicker that spread behind, when the wind caught it,
  as far as the tail of the horse. And the rubber creaked and rustled softly.
  Whatever they might have been inclined to think of this daring raid into the
  heart of a comparatively thickly populated country, they were too accustomed
  to let the leader do their thinking for them to argue the point with him. And
  Andrew followed blindly enough. He saw, indeed, one strong point in their
  favor. The very fact that the train was coming out of the heart of the
  mountains, through ravines which afforded a thousand places for assault,
  would make the guards relax their attention as they approached Gidding Creek.
  And, though there were many people in the region, they were a fat and
  inactive populace, not comparable with the lean fellows of the north.</p>

  <p>There was bitter work behind them. Ten days before they had made a feint
  to the north of Martindale that was certain to bring out Hal Dozier; then
  they doubled about and had plodded steadily south, choosing always the most
  desolate ground for their travel. There had been two changes of horses for
  the others, but Andrew kept to Sally. To her that journey was play after the
  labor she had passed through before; the iron dust of danger and labor was in
  her even as it was in Andrew. Three in all that party were fresh at the end
  of the long trail. They were Allister, Sally, and Andrew. The others were
  poisoned with weariness, and their tempers were on edge; they kept an ugly
  silence, and if one of them happened to jostle the horse of the other, there
  was a flash of teeth and eyes &mdash;a silent warning. The sixth man was
  Scottie, who had long since been detached from the party. His task was one
  which, if he failed in it, would make all that long ride go for nothing. He
  was to take the train far up, ride down as blind baggage to the Murchison
  Pass, and then climb over the tender into the cab, stick up the fireman and
  the engineer, and make them bring the engine to a halt at the mouth of the
  pass, with Gidding Creek and safety for all that train only five minutes
  away. There was a touch of the Satanic in this that pleased Andrew and made
  Allister show his teeth in self-appreciation.</p>

  <p>So perfectly had their journey been timed that the train was due in a very
  few minutes. They disposed their horses in the thicket, and then went back to
  take up their position in the ambush. The plan of work was carefully divided.
  To Jeff Rankin, that nicely accurate shot and bulldog fighter, fell what
  seemed to be a full half of the total risk and labor. He was to go to the
  blind side of the job. In other words, he was to guard the opposite side of
  the train to that on which the main body advanced. It was always possible
  that when a train was held up the passengers&mdash;at least the unarmed
  portion, and perhaps even some of the armed men&mdash;would break away on the
  least threatened side. Jeff Rankin on that blind side was to turn them back
  with a hurricane of bullets from his magazine rifle. Firing from ambush and
  moving from place to place, he would seem more than one man. Probably three
  or four shots would turn back the mob. In the meantime, having made the
  engineer and fireman stop the train, Scottie would be making them continue to
  flood the fire box. This would delay the start of the engine on its way and
  gain precious moments for the fugitives. Two of the band would be thus
  employed while Larry la Roche went through the train and turned out the
  passengers. There was no one like Larry for facing a crowd and cowing it. His
  spectral form, his eyes burning through the holes in his mask, stripped them
  of any idea of resistance.</p>

  <p>While the crowd turned out, Andrew, standing opposite the middle of the
  train, rifle in hand, would line them up, while Allister and Joe Clune
  attended to overpowering the guards of the safe, and Larry la Roche came out
  and went through the line of passengers for personal valuables, and Clune and
  Allister fixed the soup to blow the safe. Last of all, there was the
  explosion, the carrying off of the coin in its canvas sacks to the horses.
  Each man was to turn his horse in a direction carefully specified, and,
  riding in a roundabout manner, which was also named, he was to keep on until
  he came, five days later, to a deserted, ruinous shack far up in the
  mountains on the side of the Twin Eagles peaks.</p>

  <p>These were the instructions which Allister went over carefully with each
  member of his crew before they went to their posts. There had been twenty
  rehearsals before, and each man was letter perfect. They took their posts,
  and Allister came to the side of Andrew among the trees.</p>

  <p>"How are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Scared to death," said Andrew truthfully. "I'd give a thousand dollars,
  if I had it, to be free of this job."</p>

  <p>Andrew saw that hard glint come in the eyes of the leader.</p>

  <p>"You'll do&mdash;later," nodded Allister. "But keep back from the crowd.
  Don't let them see you get nervous when they turn out of the coaches. If you
  show a sign of wavering they might start something. Once they make a surge,
  shooting won't stop 'em."</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded. There was more practical advice on the heels of this. Then
  they stood quietly and waited.</p>

  <p>For days and days a northeaster had been blowing; it had whipped little
  drifts of rain and mist that stung the face and sent a chill to the bone,
  and, though there had been no actual downpour, the cold and the wet had never
  broken since the journey started. Now the wind came like a wolf down the
  Murchison Pass, howling and moaning. Andrew, closing his eyes, felt that the
  whole thing was dreamlike. Presently he would open his eyes and find himself
  back beside the fire in the house of Uncle Jasper, with the old man prodding
  his shoulder and telling him that it was bedtime. When he opened his eyes, in
  fact, they fell upon a solitary pine high up on the opposite slope, above the
  thicket where Jeff Rankin was hiding. It was a sickly tree, half naked of
  branches, and it shivered like a wretched animal in the wind. Then a new
  sound came down the pass, wolflike, indeed; it was repeated more
  clearly&mdash;the whistle of a train.</p>

  <p>It was the signal arranged among them for putting on the masks, and Andrew
  hastily adjusted his.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" asked Allister as the train hooted in the distance
  again.</p>

  <p>Andrew turned and started at the ghostly thing which had been the face of
  the outlaw a moment before; he himself must look like that, he knew.</p>

  <p>"What?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That voicelike whistle," said Allister. "There's no luck in this day
  &mdash;for me."</p>

  <p>"You've listened to Larry la Roche too much," said Andrew. "He's been
  growling ever since we started on this trail."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" returned Allister. "It's another thing, an older thing than
  Larry la Roche. My mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped. Whatever it was that he was about to say, Andrew was never to
  hear it. The train had turned the long bend above, and now the roar of its
  wheels filled the canyon and covered the sound of the wind.</p>

  <p>It looked vast as a mountain as it came, rocking perceptibly on the uneven
  roadbed. It rounded the curve, the tail of the train flicked around, and it
  shot at full speed straight for the mouth of the pass. How could one man stop
  it? How could five men attack it after it was stopped? It was like trying to
  storm a medieval fortress with a popgun.</p>

  <p>The great black front of the engine came rocking toward them, gathering
  impetus on the sharp grade. Had Scottie missed his trick? But when the
  thunder of the iron on iron was deafening Andrew, and the engine seemed
  almost upon them, there was a cloud of white vapor that burst out on either
  side of it and the brakes were jumped on; the wheels skidded, screaming on
  the tracks. The engine lurched past; Andrew caught a glimpse of Scottie, a
  crouched, masked form in the cab of the engine, with a gun in either hand.
  For Scottie was one of the few natural two-gun men that Andrew was ever to
  know. The engineer and the fireman he saw only as two shades before they were
  whisked out of his view. The train rumbled on; then it went from half speed
  to a stop with one jerk that brought a cry from the coaches. During the next
  second there was the successive crashing of couplings as the coaches took up
  their slack.</p>

  <p>Andrew, stepping out with his rifle balanced in his hands, saw Larry la
  Roche whip into the rear car. Then he himself swept the windows of the train,
  blurred by the mist, with the muzzle of his gun, keeping the butt close to
  his shoulder, ready for a swift snapshot in any direction. In fact, his was
  that very important post, the reserve force, which was to come instantly to
  the aid of any overpowered section of the active workers. He had rebelled
  against this minor task, but Allister had assured him that, in former times,
  it was the place which he took himself to meet crises in the attack.</p>

  <p>The leader had gone with Joe Clune straight for the front car. How would
  they storm it? Two guards, armed to the teeth, would be in it, and the door
  was closed.</p>

  <p>But the guards had no intention to remain like rats in a trap, while the
  rest of the train was overpowered and they themselves were blasted into small
  bits with a small charge of soup. The door jerked open, the barrels of two
  guns protruded. Andrew, thrilling with horror, recognized one as a sawed-off
  shotgun. He saw now the meaning of the manner in which Allister and Clune
  made their attack. For Allister had run slowly straight for the door, while
  Clune skirted in close to the cars, going more swiftly. As the gun barrels
  went up Allister plunged headlong to the ground, and the volley of shot
  missed him cleanly; but Clune the next moment leaped out from the side of the
  car, and, thereby getting himself to an angle from which he could deliver a
  cross fire, pumped two bullets through the door. Andrew saw a figure throw up
  its arms, a shadow form in the interior of the car, and then a man pitched
  out headlong through the doorway and flopped with horrible limpness on the
  roadbed. While this went on Allister had snapped a shot, while he still lay
  prone, and his single bullet brought a scream. The guards were done for.</p>

  <p>Two deaths, Andrew supposed. But presently a man was sent out of the car
  at the point of Clune's revolver. He climbed down with difficulty, clutching
  one hand with the other. He had been shot in the most painful place in the
  body &mdash;the palm of the hand. Allister turned over the other form with a
  brutal carelessness that sickened Andrew. But the man had been only stunned
  by a bullet that plowed its way across the top of his skull. He sat up now
  with a trickle running down his face. A gesture from Andrew's rifle made him
  and his companion realize that they were covered, and, without attempting any
  further resistance, they sat side by side on the ground and tended to each
  other's wounds&mdash;a ludicrous group for all their suffering.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Clune and Allister were at work in the car; the water was
  hissing in the fire box as a vast cloud of steam came rushing out around the
  engine; the passengers were pouring out of the cars. They acted like a group
  of actors, carefully rehearsed for the piece. Not once did Andrew have to
  speak to them, while they ranged in a solid line, shoulder to shoulder, men,
  women, children. And then Larry la Roche went down the line with a saddlebag
  and took up the collection. "Passin' the hat so often has give me a religious
  touch, ladies and gents," Andrew heard the ruffian say. "Any little
  contributions I'm sure grateful for, and, if anything's held back, I'm apt to
  frisk the gent that don't fork over. Hey, you, what's that lump inside your
  coat? Lady, don't lie. I seen you drop it inside your dress. Why, it's a nice
  little set o' sparklers. That ain't nothin' to be ashamed of. Come on,
  please; a little more speed. Easy there, partner; don't take both them hands
  down at once. You can peel the stuff out of your pockets with one hand, I
  figure. Conductor, just lemme see your wallet. Thanks! Hate to bother you,
  ma'am, but you sure ain't traveling on this train with only eighty-five cents
  in your pocketbook. Just lemme have a look at the rest. See if you can't find
  it in your stocking. No, they ain't anything here to make you blush. You're
  among friends, lady; a plumb friendly crowd. Your poor old pa give you this
  to go to school on, did he? Son, you're gettin' a pile more education out of
  this than you would in college. No, honey, you just keep your locket. It
  ain't worth five dollars. Did you? That jeweler ought to have my job, 'cause
  he sure robbed you! You call that watch an heirloom? Heirloom is my middle
  name, miss. Just get them danglers out'n your ears, lady. Thanks! Don't
  hurry, mister; you'll bust the chain."</p>

  <p>His monologue was endless; he had a comment for every person in the line,
  and he seemed to have a seventh sense for concealed articles. The saddlebag
  was bulging before he was through. At the same time Allister and Clune jumped
  from the car and ran. Larry la Roche gave the warning. Every one crouched or
  lay down. The soup exploded. The top of the car lifted. It made Andrew think,
  foolishly enough, of someone tipping a hat. It fell slowly, with a crash that
  was like a faint echo of the explosion. Clune ran back, and they could hear
  his shrill yell of delight: "It ain't a safe!" he exclaimed. "It's a baby
  mint!"</p>

  <p>And a baby mint it was! It was a gold shipment. Gold coin runs about
  ninety pounds to ten thousand dollars, and there was close to a hundred
  pounds apiece for each of the bandits. It was the largest haul Allister's
  gang had ever made. Larry la Roche left the pilfering of the passengers and
  went to help carry the loot. They brought it out in little loose canvas bags
  and went on the run with it to the horses.</p>

  <p>Someone was speaking. It was the gray-headed man with the glasses and the
  kindly look about the eyes. "Boys, it's the worst little game you've ever
  worked. I promise you we'll keep on your trail until we've run you all into
  the ground. That's really something to remember. I speak for Gregg and
  Sons."</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Scottie Macdougal from the cab, where he still kept the
  engineer and fireman covered, "a little hunt is like an after-dinner drink to
  me."</p>

  <p>To the utter amazement of Andrew the whole crowd&mdash;the crowd which had
  just been carefully and systematically robbed&mdash;burst into laughter. But
  this was the end. There was Allister's whistle; Jeff Rankin ran around from
  the other side of the train; the gang faded instantly into the thicket.
  Andrew, as the rear guard&mdash;his most ticklish moment&mdash;backed slowly
  toward the trees. Once there was a waver in the line, such as precedes a
  rush. He stopped short, and a single twitch of his rifle froze the waverers
  in their tracks.</p>

  <p>Once inside the thicket a yell came from the crowd, but Andrew had whirled
  and was running at full speed. He could hear the others crashing away. Sally,
  as he had taught her, broke into a trot as he approached, and the moment he
  struck the saddle she was in full gallop. Guns were rattling behind him;
  random shots cut the air sometimes close to him, but not one of the whole
  crowd dared venture beyond that unknown screen of trees.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36"></a>CHAPTER 36</h2>

  <p class="first">To Andrew the last danger of the holdup had been assigned as
  the rear guard, and he was the last man to pass Allister. The leader had
  drawn his horse to one side a couple of miles down the valley, and, as each
  of his band passed him, he raised his hand in silent greeting. It was the
  last Andrew saw of him, a ghostly figure sitting his horse with his hand
  above his head. After that his mind was busied by his ride, for, having the
  finest mount in the crowd, to him had been assigned the longest and the most
  roundabout route to reach the Twin Eagles.</p>

  <p>Yet he covered so much ground with Sally that, instead of needing the full
  five days to make the rendezvous, he could afford to loaf the last stage of
  the journey. Even at that, he camped in sight of the cabin on the fourth
  night, and on the morning of the fifth he was the first man at the shack.</p>

  <p>Jeff Rankin came in next. To Jeff, on account of his unwieldy bulk, had
  been assigned the shortest route; yet even so he dismounted, staggering and
  limping from his horse, and collapsed on the pile of boughs which Andrew had
  spent the morning cutting for a bed. As he dropped he tossed his bag of coins
  to the floor. It fell with a melodious jingling that was immediately drowned
  by Jeff's groans; the saddle was torture to him, and now he was aching in
  every joint of his enormous body. "A nice haul&mdash;nothin' to kick about,"
  was Jeff's opinion. "But Caesar's ghost&mdash;what a ride! The chief makes
  this thing too hard on a gent that likes to go easy, Andy."</p>

  <p>Andrew said nothing; silence had been his cue ever since he began acting
  as lieutenant to the chief. It had seemed to baffle the others; it baffled
  the big man now. Later on Joe Clune and Scottie came in together. That was
  about noon&mdash;they had met each other an hour before. But Allister had not
  come in, although he was usually the first at a rendezvous. Neither did Larry
  la Roche come. The day wore on; the silence grew on the group. When Andrew,
  proportioning the work for supper, sent Joe to get wood, Jeff for water, and
  began himself to work with Scottie on the cooking, he was met with ugly looks
  and hesitation before they obeyed. Something, he felt most decidedly, was in
  the air. And when Joe and Rankin came back slowly, walking side by side and
  talking in soft voices, his suspicions were given an edge.</p>

  <p>They wanted to eat together; but he forced Scottie to take post on the
  high hill to their right to keep lookout, and for this he received another
  scowl. Then, when supper was half over, Larry la Roche came in to camp. News
  came with him, an atmosphere of tidings around his gloomy figure, but he cast
  himself down by the fire and ate and drank in silence, until his hunger was
  gone. Then he tossed his tin dishes away and they fell clattering on the
  rocks.</p>

  <p>"Pick 'em up," said Andrew quietly. "We'll have no litter around this
  camp." Larry la Roche stared at him in hushed malevolence. "Stand up and get
  'em," repeated Andrew. As he saw the big hands of Larry twitching he smiled
  across the fire at the tall, bony figure. "I'll give you two seconds to get
  'em," he said.</p>

  <p>One deadly second pulsed away, then Larry crumpled. He caught up his tin
  cup and the plate. "We'll talk later about you," he said ominously.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about something else first," said Andrew. "You've seen
  Allister?"</p>

  <p>At first it seemed that La Roche would not speak; then his wide, thin lips
  writhed back from his teeth. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" "Gone to the happy hunting grounds."</p>

  <p>The silence came and the pulse in it. One by one, by a natural instinct,
  the men looked about them sharply into the night and made sure of their
  weapons. It was the only tribute to the memory of Allister from his men, but
  tears and praise could not have been more eloquent. He had made these men
  fearless of the whole world. Now were they ready to jump at the passage of a
  shadow. They looked at each other with strange eyes.</p>

  <p>"Who? How many?" asked Jeff Rankin.</p>

  <p>"One man done it."</p>

  <p>"Hal Dozier?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Him," said Larry la Roche. He went on, looking gloomily down at the fire.
  "He got me first. The chief must of seen him get me by surprise, while I was
  down off my hoss, lying flat and drinking out of a creek!" He closed his
  great, bony fist in unspeakable agony at the thought. "Dozier come behind and
  took me. Frisked me. Took my guns, not the coin. We went down through the
  hills. Then the chief slid out of a shadow and come at us like a tiger. I
  sloped."</p>

  <p>"You left Allister to fight alone?" said Scottie Macdougal quietly, for he
  had come from his lookout to listen.</p>

  <p>"I had no gun," said Larry, without raising his eyes from the fire. "I
  sloped. I looked back and seen Allister sitting on his hoss, dead still. Hal
  Dozier was sittin' on his hoss, dead still. Five seconds, maybe. Then they
  went for their guns together. They was two bangs like one. But Allister slid
  out of his saddle and Dozier stayed in his. I come on here."</p>

  <p>The quiet covered them. Joe Clune, with a shudder and another glance over
  his shoulder, cast a branch on the fire, and the flames leaped.</p>

  <p>"Dozier knows you're with us," added Larry la Roche, and he cast a long
  glance of hatred at Andrew. "He knows you're with us, and he knows our luck
  left us when you come."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked about the circle; not an eye met his.</p>

  <p>The talk of Larry la Roche during the days of the ride was showing its
  effect now. The gage had been thrown down to Andrew, and he dared not pick it
  up.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, "I'll say this: Are we going to bust up and each man go
  his way?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"If we do, we can split the profits over again. I'll take no money out of
  a thing that cost Allister's death. There's my sack on the floor of the
  shack. Divvy it up among you. You fitted me out when I was broke. That'll pay
  you back. Do we split up?"</p>

  <p>"They's no reason why we should&mdash;and be run down like rabbits," said
  Joe Clune, with another of those terrible glances over his shoulder into the
  night.</p>

  <p>The others assented with so many growls.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Andrew, "we stick together. And, if we stick together, I
  run this camp."</p>

  <p>"You?" asked Larry la Roche. "Who picked you? Who 'lected you, son? Why,
  you unlucky&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ease up," said Andrew softly.</p>

  <p>The eyes of La Roche flicked across the circle and picked up the glances
  of the others, but they were not yet ready to tackle Andrew Lanning.</p>

  <p>"The last thing Allister did," said Andrew, "was to make me his
  lieutenant. It's the last thing he did, and I'm going to push it through. Not
  because I like the job." He raised his head, but not his voice. "They may run
  down the rest of you. They won't run down me. They can't. They've tried, and
  they can't. And I might be able to keep the rest of you clear. I'm going to
  try. But I won't follow the lead of any of you. If there'd been one that
  could keep the rest of you together, d'you think Allister wouldn't have seen
  it? Don't you think he would of made that one leader? Why, look at you! Jeff,
  you'd follow Clune. But would Larry or Scottie follow Clune? Look at 'em and
  see!"</p>

  <p>All eyes went to Clune, and then the glances of Scottie and La Roche
  dropped.</p>

  <p>"Nobody here would follow La Roche. He's the best man we've got for some
  of the hardest work, but you're too flighty with your temper, Larry, and you
  know it. We respect you just as much, but not to plan things for the rest of
  us. Is that straight?</p>

  <p>"And you, Scottie," said Andrew, "you're the only one I'd follow. I say
  that freely. But who else would follow you? You're the best of us all at
  headwork and planning, but you don't swing your gun as fast, and you don't
  shoot as straight as Jeff or Larry or Joe. Is that straight?"</p>

  <p>"What's leading the gang got to do with fighting?" asked Scottie harshly.
  "And who's got the right to the head of things but me?"</p>

  <p>"Ask Allister what fighting had to do with the running of things," said
  Andrew calmly.</p>

  <p>The moon was sliding up out of the east; it changed the faces of the men
  and made them oddly animallike; they stared, fascinated, at Andrew.</p>

  <p>"There's two reasons why I'm going to run this job, if we stick together.
  Allister named them once. I can take advice from any one of you; I know what
  each of you can do; I can plan a job for you; I can lead you clear of the law
  &mdash;and there's not one of you that can bully me or make me give an inch
  &mdash;no, nor all of you together&mdash;La Roche! Macdougal! Clune!
  Rankin!"</p>

  <p>It was like a roll call, and at each name a head was jerked up in answer,
  and two glittering eyes flashed at Andrew&mdash;flashed, sparkled, and then
  became dull. The moonlight had made his pale skin a deadly white, and it was
  a demoniac face they saw. The silence was his answer.</p>

  <p>"Jeff," he commanded, "take the hill. You'll stand the watch tonight. And
  look sharp. If Dozier got Allister he's apt to come at us. Step on it!"</p>

  <p>And Jeff Rankin rose without a word and lumbered to the top of the hill.
  Larry la Roche suddenly filled his cup with boiling hot coffee, regardless of
  the heat, regardless of the dirt in the cup. His hand shook when he raised it
  to his lips.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap37"
     name="chap37"></a>CHAPTER 37</h2>

  <p class="first">There was no further attempt at challenging his authority.
  When he ordered Clune and La Roche to bring in boughs for bedding&mdash;since
  they were to stop in the shack overnight&mdash;they went silently. But it was
  such a silence as comes when the wind falls at the end of a day and in a
  silent sky the clouds pile heavily, higher and higher. Andrew took the
  opportunity to speak to Scottie Macdougal. He told Scottie simply that he
  needed him, and with him at his back he could handle the others, and more,
  too. He was surprised to see a twinkle in the eye of the Scotchman.</p>

  <p>"Why, Andy," said the canny fellow, "didn't you see me pass you the wink?
  I was with you all the time!"</p>

  <p>Andrew thanked him and went into the cabin to arrange for lights. He had
  no intention of shirking a share in the actual work of the camp; even though
  Allister had set that example for his following. He took some lengths of
  pitchy pine sticks and arranged them for torches. One of them alone would
  send a flare of yellow light through the cabin; two made a comfortable
  illumination. But he worked cheerlessly. The excitement of the robbery and
  the chase was over, and then the conflict with the men was passing. He began
  to see things truly by the drab light of retrospection. The bullets of
  Allister and Clune might have gone home&mdash;they were intended to kill, not
  to wound. And if there had been two deaths he, Andrew Lanning, would have
  been equally guilty with the men who handled the guns, for he had been one of
  the forces which made that shooting possible.</p>

  <p>It was an ugly way to look at it&mdash;very ugly. It kept a frown on
  Andrew's face, while he arranged the torches in the main room of the shack
  and then put one for future reference in the little shed which leaned against
  the rear of the main structure. He arranged his own bed in this second room,
  where the saddles and other accouterments were piled. It was easily
  explained, since there was hardly room for five men in the first room. But he
  had another purpose. He wanted to separate himself from the others, just as
  Allister always did. Even in a crowded room Allister would seem aloof, and
  Andrew determined to make the famous leader his guide.</p>

  <p>Above all he was troubled by what Scottie had said. He would have felt
  easy at heart if the Scotchman had met him with an argument or with a frown
  or honest opposition or with a hearty handshake, to say that all was well
  between them. But this cunning lie&mdash;this cunning protestation that he
  had been with the new leader from the first, put Andrew on his guard. For he
  knew perfectly well that Scottie had not been on his side during the crisis
  with La Roche. Macdougal sat before the door, his metal flask of whisky
  beside him. It was a fault of Allister, this permitting of whisky at all
  times and in all places, after a job was finished. And while it made the
  other men savage beasts, it turned Scottie Macdougal into a wily, smiling
  snake. He had bit the heel of more than one man in his drinking bouts.</p>

  <p>Presently La Roche and Clune came in. They had been talking together
  again. Andrew could tell by the manner in which they separated, as soon as
  they entered the room, and by their voices, which they made loud and
  cheerful; and, also, by the fact that they avoided looking at each other.
  They were striving patently to prove that there was nothing between them; and
  if Andrew had been on guard, now he became tinglingly so.</p>

  <p>They arranged their bunks; Larry la Roche took from his vest a pipe with a
  small bowl and a long stem and sat down cross-legged to smoke. Andrew
  suggested that Larry produce the contents of his saddlebag and share the
  spoils of war.</p>

  <p>He brought it out willingly enough and spilled it out on the improvised
  table, a glittering mass of gold trinkets, watches, jewels. He picked out of
  the mass a chain of diamonds and spread it out on his snaky fingers so that
  the light could play on it. Andrew knew nothing about gems, but he knew that
  the chain must be worth a great deal of money.</p>

  <p>"This," said Larry, "is my share. You gents can have the rest and split it
  up."</p>

  <p>"A nice set of sparklers," nodded Clune, "but there's plenty left to
  satisfy me."</p>

  <p>"What you think," declared Scottie, "ain't of any importance, Joe. It's
  what the chief thinks that counts. Is it square, Lanning?"</p>

  <p>Andrew flushed at the appeal and the ugly looks which La Roche and Clune
  cast toward him. He could have stifled Scottie for that appeal, and yet
  Scottie was smiling in the greatest apparent good nature and belief in their
  leader. His face was flushed, but his lips were bloodless. Alcohol always
  affected him in that manner.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the value of the stones," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" murmured Scottie. "I forgot. Thought maybe you would. That
  was something that Allister did know." The new leader saw a flash of glances
  toward Scottie, but the latter continued to eye the captain with a steady and
  innocent look.</p>

  <p>"Scottie," decided Andrew instantly, "is my chief enemy."</p>

  <p>If he could detach one man to his side all would be well. Two against
  three would be a simple thing, as long as he was one of the two. But four
  against one&mdash;and such a four as these&mdash;was hopeless odds. There
  seemed little chance of getting Joe Clune. There remained only Jeff Rankin as
  his possibly ally, and already he had stepped on Jeff's toes sorely, by
  making the tired giant stand guard. He thought of all these things, of
  course, in a flash. And then in answer to his thoughts Jeff Rankin appeared.
  His heavy footfall crashed inside the door. He stopped, panting, and, in
  spite of his news, paused to blink at the flash of jewels.</p>

  <p>"It's comin'," said Jeff. "Boys, get your guns and scatter out of the
  cabin. Duck that light! Hal Dozier is comin' up the valley."</p>

  <p>There was not a single exclamation, but the lights went out as if by
  magic; there were a couple of light, hissing sounds, such as iron makes when
  it is whipped swiftly across leather.</p>

  <p>"How'd you know him by this light?" asked Larry la Roche, as they went out
  of the door. Outside they found everything brilliant with the white moonshine
  of the mountains.</p>

  <p>"Nobody but Hal Dozier rides twistin' that way in the saddle. I'd tell him
  in a thousand. It's old wounds that makes him ride like that. We got ten
  minutes. He's takin' the long way up the canyon. And they ain't anybody with
  him."</p>

  <p>"If he's come alone," said Andrew, "he's come for me and not for the rest
  of you."</p>

  <p>No one spoke. Then Larry la Roche: "He wants to make it man to man. That's
  clear. That's why he pulled up his hoss and waited for Allister to make the
  first move for his gun. It's a clean challenge to some one of us."</p>

  <p>Andrew saw his chance and used it mercilessly.</p>

  <p>"Which one of you is willing to take the challenge?" he asked. "Which one
  of you is willing to ride down the canyon and meet him alone? La Roche, I've
  heard you curse Dozier."</p>

  <p>But Larry la Roche answered: "What's this fool talk about takin' a
  challenge? I say, string out behind the hills and pot him with rifles."</p>

  <p>"One man, and we're five," said Jeff Rankin. "It ain't sportin', Larry. I
  hate to hear you say that. We'd be despised all over the mountains if we done
  it. He's makin' his play with a lone hand, and we've got to meet him the same
  way. Eh, chief?"</p>

  <p>It was sweet to Andrew to hear that appeal. And he saw them turn one by
  one toward him in the moonlight and wait. It was his first great tribute. He
  looked over those four wolfish figures and felt his heart swelling.</p>

  <p>"Wish me luck, boys," he said, and without another word he turned and went
  down the hillside.</p>

  <p>The others watched him with amazement. He felt it rather than saw it, and
  it kept a tingle in his blood. He felt, also, that they were spreading out to
  either side to get a clear view of the fight that was to follow, and it
  occurred to him that, even if Hal Dozier killed him, there would not be one
  chance in a thousand of Hal's getting away. Four deadly rifles would be
  covering him.</p>

  <p>It must be that a sort of madness had come on Dozier, advancing in this
  manner, unsupported by a posse. Or, perhaps, he had no idea that the outlaws
  could be so close. He expected a daylight encounter high up the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>But Andrew went swiftly down the ravine.</p>

  <p>Broken cliffs, granite boulders jumped up on either side of him, and the
  rocks were pale and glimmering under the moon. This one valley seemed to
  receive the light; the loftier mountains rolling away on each side were black
  as jet, with sharp, ragged outlines against the sky. It was a cold light, and
  the chill of it went through Andrew. He was afraid, afraid as he had been
  when Buck Heath faced him in Martindale, or when Bill Dozier ran him down, or
  when the famous Sandy cornered him. His fingers felt brittle, and his breath
  came and went in short gasps, drawn into the upper part of his lungs
  only.</p>

  <p>Behind him, like an electric force pushing him on, the outlaws watched his
  steps. They, also, were shuddering with fear, and he knew it.</p>

  <p>Dozier was coming, fresh from another kill.</p>

  <p>"Only one man I'd think twice about meeting," Allister had said in the old
  days, and he had been right. Yet there were thousands who had sworn that
  Allister was invincible&mdash;that he would never fall before a single
  man.</p>

  <p>He thought, too, of the lean face and the peculiar, set eye of Dozier. The
  man had no fear, he had no nerves; he was a machine, and death was his
  business.</p>

  <p>And was he, Andrew Lanning, unknown until the past few months, now going
  down to face destruction, as full of fear as a girl trembling at the dark?
  What was it that drew them together, so unfairly matched?</p>

  <p>He could still see only the white haze of the moonshine before him, but
  now there was the clicking of hoofs on the rock. Dozier was coming. Andrew
  walked squarely out into the middle of the ravine and waited. He had set his
  teeth. The nerves on the bottom of his feet were twitching. Something
  freezing cold was beginning at the tips of his fingers. How long would it
  take Dozier to come?</p>

  <p>An interminable time. The hoofbeats actually seemed to fade out and draw
  away at one time. Then they began again very near him, and now they stopped.
  Had Dozier seen him around the elbow curve? That heartbreaking instant
  passed, and the clicking began again. Then the rider came slowly in view.
  First there was the nodding head of the cow pony, then the foot in the
  stirrup, then Hal Dozier riding a little twisted in the saddle&mdash;a famous
  characteristic of his.</p>

  <p>He came on closer and closer. He began to seem huge on the horse. Was he
  blind not to see the figure that waited for him?</p>

  <p>A voice that was not his, that he did not recognize, leaped out from
  between his teeth and tore his throat: "Dozier!"</p>

  <p>The cow pony halted with a start; the rider jerked straight in his saddle;
  the echo of the call barked back from some angling cliff face down the
  ravine. All that before Dozier made his move. He had dropped the reins, and
  Andrew, with a mad intention of proving that he himself did not make the
  first move toward his weapon, had folded his arms.</p>

  <p>He did not move through the freezing instant that followed. Not until
  there was a convulsive jerk of Dozier's elbow did he stir his folded arms.
  Then his right arm loosened, and the hand flashed down to his holster.</p>

  <p>Was Dozier moving with clogged slowness, or was it that he had ceased to
  be a body, that he was all brain and hair-trigger nerves making every
  thousandth part of a second seem a unit of time? It seemed to Andrew that the
  marshal's hand dragged through its work; to those who watched from the sides
  of the ravine, there was a flash of fire from his gun before they saw even
  the flash of the steel out of the holster. The gun spat in the hand of
  Dozier, and something jerked at the shirt of Andrew beside his neck. He
  himself had fired only once, and he knew that the shot had been too high and
  to the right of his central target; yet he did not fire again. Something
  strange was happening to Hal Dozier. His head had nodded forward as though in
  mockery of the bullet; his extended right hand fell slowly, slowly; his whole
  body began to sway and lean toward the right. Not until that moment did
  Andrew know that he had shot the marshal through the body.</p>

  <p>He raced to the side of the cattle pony, and, as the horse veered away,
  Hal Dozier dropped limply into his arms. He lay with his limbs sprawling at
  odd angles beside him. His muscles seemed paralyzed, but his eyes were bright
  and wide, and his face perfectly composed.</p>

  <p>"There's luck for you," said Hal Dozier calmly. "I pulled it two inches to
  the right, or I would have broken your neck with the slug&mdash;anyway, I
  spoiled your shirt."</p>

  <p>The cold was gone from Andrew, and he felt his heart thundering and
  shaking his body. He was repeating like a frightened child, "For God's sake,
  Hal, don't die&mdash;don't die."</p>

  <p>The paralyzed body did not move, but the calm voice answered him: "You
  fool! Finish me before your gang comes and does it for you!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap38"
     name="chap38"></a>CHAPTER 38</h2>

  <p class="first">There was a rush of footsteps behind and around him, a
  jangle of voices, and there were the four huddled over Hal Dozier. Andrew had
  risen and stepped back, silently thanking God that it was not a death. He
  heard the voices of the four like voices in a dream.</p>

  <p>"A clean one." "A nice bit of work." "Dozier, are you thinkin' of
  Allister, curse you?" "D'you remember Hugh Wiley now?" "D'you maybe recollect
  my pal, Bud Swain? Think about 'em, Dozier, while you're dyin'!" The calm
  eyes traveled without hurry from face to face. And curiosity came to Andrew,
  a cool, deadly curiosity. He stepped among the gang.</p>

  <p>"He's not fatally hurt," he said. "What d'you intend to do with him?"</p>

  <p>"You're all wrong, chief," said Larry la Roche, and he grinned at Andrew.
  His submission now was perfect and complete. There was even a sort of worship
  in the bright eyes that looked at the new leader. "I hate to say it, but
  right as you mos' gener'ly are, you're wrong this time. He's done. He don't
  need no more lookin' to. Leave him be for an hour and he'll be finished.
  Also, that'll give him a chance to think. He needs a chance. Old Curley had a
  chance to think &mdash;took him four hours to kick out after Dozier plugged
  him. I heard what he had to say, and it wasn't pretty. I think maybe it'd be
  sort of interestin' to hear what Dozier has to say. Long about the time he
  gets thirsty. Eh, boys?"</p>

  <p>There was a snarl from the other three as they looked down at the wounded
  man, who did not speak a word. And Andrew knew that he was indeed alone with
  that crew, for the man whom he had just shot down was nearer to him than the
  members of Allister's gang.</p>

  <p>He spoke suddenly: "Jeff, take his head; Clune, take his feet. Carry him
  up to the cabin."</p>

  <p>They only stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Look here, captain," said Scottie in a soft voice, just a trifle
  thickened by whiskey, "are you thinking of taking him up there and tying him
  up so that he'll live through this?"</p>

  <p>And again the other three snarled softly.</p>

  <p>"You murdering hounds!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>That was all. They looked at each other; they looked at the new leader.
  And the sight of his white face and his nervous right hand was too much for
  them. They took up the marshal and carried him to the cabin, his pony
  following like a dog behind. They brought him, without asking for directions,
  straight into the little rear room&mdash;Andrew's room. It was a sufficiently
  intelligible way of saying that this was his work and none of theirs. And not
  a hand lifted to aid him while he went to work with the bandaging. He knew
  little about such work, but the marshal himself, in a rather faint, but
  perfectly steady voice, gave directions. And in the painful cleaning of the
  wound he did not murmur once. Neither did he express the slightest gratitude.
  He kept following Andrew about the room with coldly curious eyes.</p>

  <p>In the next room the voices of the four were a steady, rumbling murmur.
  Now and then the glance of the marshal wandered to the door. When the
  bandaging was completed, he asked, "Do you know you've started a job you
  can't finish?"</p>

  <p>"Ah?" murmured Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Those four," said the marshal, "won't let you."</p>

  <p>Andrew smiled.</p>

  <p>"Are you easier now?"</p>

  <p>"Don't bother about me. I'll tell you what&mdash;I wish you'd get me a
  drink of water."</p>

  <p>"I'll send one of the boys."</p>

  <p>"No, get it yourself. I want to say something to them while you're
  gone."</p>

  <p>Andrew had risen up from his knees. He now studied the face of the marshal
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"You want 'em to come in here and drill you, eh?" he said. "Why?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've given up hope once; I've gone through the hardest part of dying; let
  them finish the job now."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow you'll feel differently."</p>

  <p>"Will I?" asked the marshal. All at once his eyes went yellow with hate.
  "I go back to the desert&mdash;I go to Martindale&mdash;people I pass on the
  street whisper as I go by. They'll tell over and over how I went down. And a
  kid did it&mdash;a raw kid!"</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes in silent agony. Then he looked up more keenly than
  before. "How'll they know that it was luck&mdash;that my gun stuck in the
  holster&mdash;and that you jumped me on the draw?"</p>

  <p>"You lie," said Andrew calmly. "Your gun came out clean as a whistle, and
  I waited for you, Dozier. You know I did."</p>

  <p>The pain in the marshal's face became a ghastly thing to see. At last he
  could speak.</p>

  <p>"A sneak always lies well," he replied, as he sneered at Lanning.</p>

  <p>He went on, while Andrew sat shivering with passion. "And any fool can get
  in a lucky shot now and then. But, when I'm out of this, I'll hunt you down
  again and I'll plant you full of lead, my son! You can lay to that!"</p>

  <p>The hard breathing of Andrew gradually subsided.</p>

  <p>"It won't work, Dozier," he said quietly. "You can't make me mad enough to
  shoot a man who's down. You can't make me murder you."</p>

  <p>The marshal closed his eyes again, while his breathing was beginning to
  grow fainter, and there was an unpleasant rattle in the hollow of his throat.
  Andrew went into the next room.</p>

  <p>"Scottie," he said, "will you let me have your flask?"</p>

  <p>Scottie smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"Not for what you'd use it for, Lanning," he said.</p>

  <p>Andrew picked up a cup and shoved it across the table.</p>

  <p>"Pour a little whisky in that, please," he said.</p>

  <p>Scottie looked up and studied him. Then he tipped his flask and poured a
  thin stream into the cup until it was half full. Andrew went back toward the
  door, the cup in his left hand. He backed up, keeping his face steadily
  toward the four, and kicked open the door behind him.</p>

  <p>War, he knew, had been declared. Then he raised the marshal's head and
  gave him a sip of the fiery stuff. It cleared the face of the wounded
  man.</p>

  <p>Then Andrew rolled down his blankets before the door, braced a small stick
  against it, so that the sound would be sure to waken him if anyone tried to
  enter, and laid down for the night. He was almost asleep when the marshal
  said: "Are you really going to stick it out, Andy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"In spite of what I've said?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you meant it all? You'd hunt me down and kill me like a dog
  after you get back on your feet?"</p>

  <p>"Like a dog."</p>

  <p>"If you think it over and see things clearly," replied Andrew, "you'll see
  that what I've done I've done for my own sake, and not for yours."</p>

  <p>"How do you make that out&mdash;with four men in the next room ready to
  stick a knife in your back&mdash;if I know anything about 'em?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you: I owe nothing to you, but a man owes a lot to himself, and
  I'm going to pay myself in full."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap39"
     name="chap39"></a>CHAPTER 39</h2>

  <p class="first">He closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but, though he came
  to the verge of oblivion, the voices from the other room finally waked him.
  They had been changing subtly during the past hours and now they rose, and
  there was a ring to them that troubled Andrew.</p>

  <p>He could make out their talk part of the time; and then again they lowered
  their voices to rumbling growls. At such times he knew that they were
  speaking of him, and the hum of the undertone was more ominous than open
  threats. When they talked aloud there was a confused clamor; when they were
  more hushed there was always the oily murmur of Scottie's voice, taking the
  lead and directing the current of the talk.</p>

  <p>The liquor was going the rounds fast, now. Before they left for the
  Murchison Pass they had laid in a comfortable supply, but apparently Allister
  had cached a quantity of the stuff at the Twin Eagles shack. Of one thing
  Andrew was certain, that four such practiced whisky drinkers would never let
  their party degenerate into a drunken rout; and another thing was even more
  sure&mdash;that Scottie Macdougal would keep his head better than the best of
  the others. But what the alcohol would do would be to cut the leash of
  constraint and dig up every strong passion among them. For instance, Jeff
  Rankin was by far the most equable of the lot, but, given a little whisky,
  Jeff became a conscienceless devil.</p>

  <p>He knew his own weakness, and Andrew, crawling to the door and putting his
  ear to the crack under it, found that the sounds of the voices became
  instantly clearer; the others were plying Jeff with the liquor, and Jeff,
  knowing that he had had enough, was persistently refusing, but with less and
  less energy.</p>

  <p>There must be a very definite reason for this urging of Rankin toward the
  whisky, and Andrew was not hard pressed to find out that reason. The big,
  rather good-natured giant was leaning toward the side of the new leader, just
  as steadily as the others were leaning away from him. Whisky alone would stop
  his scruples. Larry la Roche, his voice a guarded, hissing whisper, was
  speaking to Jeff as Andrew began listening from his new position.</p>

  <p>"What I ask you," said La Roche, "is this: Have we had any luck since the
  kid joined us?" "We've got a pile of the coin," said Jeff obstinately.</p>

  <p>"D'you stack a little coin against the loss of Allister?" asked Larry la
  Roche.</p>

  <p>"Easy," cautioned Scottie. "Not so loud, Larry."</p>

  <p>"He's asleep," said Larry la Roche. "I heard him lie down after he'd put
  something agin' the door. No fear of him."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so sure. He might make a noise lying down and make not a sound
  getting up. And, even when he's asleep, he's got one eye open like a
  wolf."</p>

  <p>"Well," repeated Larry insistently, and now his voice was so faint that
  Andrew had to guess at half the syllables, "answer my question, Jeff: Have we
  had good luck or bad luck, takin' it all in all, since he joined us?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know it's his fault?" asked Jeff. "We all knew it would be a
  close pinch if Allister ever jumped Hal Dozier. We thought Allister was a
  little bit faster than Dozier. Everybody else said that Dozier was the best
  man that ever pulled a gun out of leather. It wasn't luck that beat Allister
  &mdash;it was a better man."</p>

  <p>There was a thud as his fist hit the rickety, squeaking table in the
  center of the room.</p>

  <p>"I say, let's play fair and square. How do I know that the kid won't make
  a good leader?"</p>

  <p>Scottie broke in smoothly: "Makes me grin when you say that, Jeff. Tell
  you what the trouble is with you, old man: you're too modest. A fellow that's
  done what you've done, following a kid that ain't twenty-five!"</p>

  <p>There was a bearlike grunt from Jeff. He was not altogether displeased by
  this gracious tribute. But he answered: "You're too slippery with your
  tongue, Scottie. I never know when you mean what you say!"</p>

  <p>It must have been a bitter pill for Scottie to swallow, but he was not
  particularly formidable with his weapons, compared with straight-eyed Jeff
  Rankin, and he answered: "Maybe there's some I jolly along a bit, but, when I
  talk to old Jeff Rankin, I talk straight. Look at me now, Jeff. Do I look as
  if I was joking with you?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't any hand at readin' minds," grumbled Jeff.</p>

  <p>He added suddenly: "I say it was the finest thing I ever see, the way
  young Lanning stood out there in the valley. Did you watch? Did you see him
  let Dozier get the jump on his gun? Pretty, pretty, pretty! And then his own
  gat was out like a flash&mdash;one wink, and there was Hal Dozier drilled
  clean! I tell you, boys, you got this young Lanning wrong. I sort of cotton
  to the kid. I always did. I liked him the first time I ever laid eyes on him.
  So did you all, except Larry, yonder. And it was Larry that turned you agin'
  him after he come and joined us. Who asked him to join us? We did!"</p>

  <p>"Who asked him to be captain?" said Scottie.</p>

  <p>It seemed to stagger Jeff Rankin.</p>

  <p>"Allister used him for a sort of second man; seemed like he meant him to
  lead us in case anything happened to him."</p>

  <p>"While Allister was living," said Scottie, "you know I would of followed
  him anywhere. Wasn't I his advance agent? Didn't I do his planning with him?
  But now Allister's dead&mdash;worse luck&mdash;but dead he is."</p>

  <p>He paused here cunningly, and, no doubt, during that pause each of the
  outlaws conjured up a picture of the scar-faced man with the bright, steady
  eyes, who had led them so long and quelled them so often and held them
  together through thick and thin.</p>

  <p>"Allister's dead," repeated Scottie, "and what he did while he was alive
  don't hold us now. We chose him for captain out of our own free will. Now
  that he's dead we have the right to elect another captain. What's Lanning
  done that he has a right to fill Allister's place with us? What job did he
  have at the holdup? When we stuck up the train didn't he have the easiest
  job? Did he give one good piece of advice while we were plannin' the job? Did
  he show any ability to lead us, then?"</p>

  <p>The answer came unhesitatingly from Rankin: "It wasn't his place to lead
  while Allister was with us. And I'll tell you what he done after Allister
  died. When I seen Dozier comin', who was it that stepped out to meet him? Was
  it you, Scottie? No, it wasn't. It wasn't you, La Roche, neither, nor you,
  Clune, and it wasn't me. Made me sick inside, the thought of facin' Dozier.
  Why? Because I knew he'd never been beat. Because I knew he was a better man
  than Allister, and that Allister had been a better man than me. And it ain't
  no braggin' to say I'm a handier gent with my guns than any of you. Well, I
  was sick, and you all were sick. I seen your faces. But who steps out and
  takes the lead? It was the kid you grin at, Scottie; it was Andy Lanning, and
  I say it was a fine thing to do!"</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly a facer; but Scottie came back in his usual calm
  manner.</p>

  <p>"I know it was Lanning, and it was a fine thing. I don't deny, either,
  that he's a fine gent in lots of ways&mdash;and in his place&mdash;but is his
  place at the head of the gang? Are we going to be bullied into having him
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Then let him follow, and somebody else lead."</p>

  <p>"You make me laugh, Jeff. He's not the sort that will follow anybody."</p>

  <p>Plainly Scottie was working on Jeff from a distance. He would bring him
  slowly around to the place where he would agree to the attack on Andrew for
  the sake of getting at the wounded marshal.</p>

  <p>"Have another drink, Jeff, and then let's get back to the main point, and
  that has nothin' to do with Andy. It is: Is Hal Dozier going to live or
  die?"</p>

  <p>The time had come, Andrew saw, to make his final play. A little more of
  this talk and the big, good-hearted, strong-handed Rankin would be completely
  on the side of the others. And that meant the impossible odds of four to one.
  Andrew knew it. He would attack any two of them without fear. But three
  became a desperate, a grim battle; and four to one made the thing
  suicide.</p>

  <p>He slipped silently to his feet from beside the door and picked up the
  canvas bag which represented his share of the robbery. Then he knocked at the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he called, "there's been some hard thoughts between the lot of you
  and me. It looks like we're on opposite sides of a fence. I want to come in
  and talk to you."</p>

  <p>Instantly Scottie answered: "Why, come on in, captain; not such hard words
  as you think&mdash;not on my side, anyways!"</p>

  <p>It was a cunning enough lure, no doubt, and Andrew had his hand on the
  latch of the door before a second thought reached him. If he exposed himself,
  would not the three of them pull their guns? They would be able to account
  for it to Jeff Rankin later on.</p>

  <p>"I'll come in," said Andrew, "when I hear you give me surety that I'll be
  safe. I don't trust you, Scottie."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for that. What surety do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I want the word of Jeff Rankin that he'll see me through till I've made
  my talk to you and my proposition."</p>

  <p>It was an excellent counterthrust, but Larry la Roche saw through the
  attempt to win Jeff immediately.</p>

  <p>"You skunk!" he said. "If you don't trust us we don't trust you. Stay
  where you be. We don't want to hear your talk!"</p>

  <p>"Jeff, what do you say?" continued Andrew calmly.</p>

  <p>There was a clamor of three voices and then the louder voice of Jeff, like
  a lion shaking itself clear of wolves: "Andy, come in, and I'll see you get a
  square deal&mdash;if you'll trust me!" Instantly Andrew threw open the door
  and stepped in, his revolver in one hand, the heavy sack over his other arm,
  a dragging weight and also a protection.</p>

  <p>"I'll trust you, Jeff," he said. "Trust you? Why, man, with you at my back
  I'd laugh at twenty fellows like these. They simply don't count."</p>

  <p>It was another well-placed shot, and he saw Rankin flush heavily with
  pleasure. Scottie tilted his box back against the wall and delivered his
  counterstroke: "He said the same thing to me earlier on in the evening," he
  remarked casually. "But I told him where to go. I told him that I was with
  the bunch first and last and all the time. That's why he hates me!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap40"
     name="chap40"></a>CHAPTER 40</h2>

  <p class="first">While he searched desperately for an answer, Andrew found
  none. Then he saw the stupid, big eyes of Jeff wander from his face to the
  face of Scottie, and he knew that his previous advantage had been completely
  neutralized.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, and he surveyed the restless, savage figures of Clune and
  La Roche, "I've come for a little plain talk. There's no more question about
  me leadin' the gang. None at all. I wouldn't lead you, La Roche, nor you,
  Clune, nor you, Scottie. There's only one man here that's clean&mdash;and
  he's Jeff Rankin."</p>

  <p>He waited for that point to sink home; as Scottie opened his lips to
  strike back, he went ahead deliberately. By retaining his own calm he saw
  that he kept a great advantage. Rankin began fumbling at his cup; Scottie
  instantly filled it half full with whisky. "Don't drink that," said Andrew
  sharply. "Don't drink it, Jeff. Scottie's doin' that on purpose to get you
  sap headed!"</p>

  <p>"Do what he says," said Scottie calmly. "Throw the dirty stuff away, Jeff.
  Do what your daddy tells you. You ain't old enough to know your own mind, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>Big Jeff flushed, cast a glance of defiance that included both Andrew and
  Scottie, and tossed off the whisky. It was a blow over the heart for Andrew;
  he had to finish his talking now, before Jeff Rankin was turned mad by the
  whisky. And if he worked it well, Jeff would be on his side. The madness
  would fight for Andrew.</p>

  <p>He said: "There's no more question about me being a leader for you.
  Personally, I'd like to have Jeff&mdash;not to follow me, but to be pals with
  me."</p>

  <p>Jeff cleared his throat and looked about with foolish importance. Not an
  eye wavered to meet his glance; every look was fixed with a hungry hate upon
  Andrew.</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing up between the lot of us: Do I keep Hal Dozier, or
  do you get him&mdash;to murder him? Do you fellows ride on your way free and
  easy, to do what you please, or do you tackle me in that room, eat my lead,
  and then, if you finish me, get a chance to kill a man that's nearly dead
  now? How does it look to you, boys? Think it over. Think sharp!"</p>

  <p>He knew while he spoke that there was one exquisitely simple way to end
  both his life and the life of Dozier&mdash;let them touch a match to the
  building and shoot him while he ran from the flames. But he could only pray
  that they would not see it.</p>

  <p>"And besides, I'll do more. You think you have a claim on Dozier. I'll buy
  him from you. Here's half his weight in gold. Will you take the money and
  clear out? Or are you going to make the play at me? If you do, you'll buy
  whatever you get at a high price!" "You forget&mdash;" put in Scottie, but
  Andrew interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear from you, Scottie. I know you're a snake. I want to
  hear from Jeff Rankin. Speak up, Jeff. Everything's in your hands, and I
  trust you!"</p>

  <p>The giant rose from his chair. His face was white with the effect of the
  whisky, and one spot of color burned in each cheek. He looked gloweringly
  upon his companions.</p>

  <p>"Andy," he said, "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Scottie swiftly, seeing that the scales were
  balancing toward a defeat.</p>

  <p>"Let him talk. You don't have to tell him what to say," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I've got a right to put our side up to him&mdash;for the sake of the
  things we've been through together. Jeff, have I?"</p>

  <p>Jeff Rankin cleared his throat importantly. Scottie faced him; the others
  kept their unchanging eyes rivetted upon Andrew, ready for the gun play at
  the first flicker of an eyelid. The first sign of unwariness would begin and
  end the battle.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget this," went on Scottie, having Jeff's attention. "Andy is
  workin' to keep Dozier alive. Why? Dozier's the law, isn't he? Then Andy
  wants to make up with the law. He wants to sneak out. He wants to turn
  state's evidence!"</p>

  <p>The deadly phrase shocked Jeff Rankin a pace back toward soberness.</p>

  <p>"I never thought," he began.</p>

  <p>"You're too straight to think of it. Take another look at Lanning. Is he
  one of us? Has he ever been one of us? No! Look again! Dozier has hunted
  Lanning all over the mountain desert. Now he wants to save Dozier. Wants to
  risk his life for him. Wants to buy him from us! Why? Because he's turned
  crooked. He's turned soft. He wants to get under the wing of the law."</p>

  <p>But Jeff Rankin swept all argument away with a movement of his big paws.
  "Too much talk," he said. "I want to think."</p>

  <p>His stupid, animal eyes went laboriously around the room. "I wish Allister
  was here," he said. "He always knew."</p>

  <p>"For my part," said Scottie, "I can't be bought. Not me!" He suddenly
  leaned to the big man, and, before Andrew could speak, he had said: "Jeff,
  you know why I want to get Dozier. Because he ran down my brother. And are
  you going to let him go clear, Jeff? Are you going to have Allister haunt
  you?"</p>

  <p>It was the decisive stroke. The big head of Jeff twitched back, he opened
  his lips to speak&mdash;and in that moment, knowing that the battle was over
  and lost to him, Andrew, who had moved back, made one leap and was through
  the door and into the little shed again. The gun had gleamed in the hand of
  Larry la Roche as he sprang, but Andrew had been too quick for the outlaw to
  plant his shot.</p>

  <p>He heard Jeff Rankin still speaking: "I dunno, quite. But I see you're
  right, Scottie. They ain't any reason for Lanning to be so chummy with
  Dozier. And so they must be somethin' crooked about it. Boys, I'm with you to
  the limit! Go as far as you like. I'm behind you!"</p>

  <p>No room for argument now; and the blind, animal hate which Scottie and La
  Roche and Clune felt for Dozier was sure to drive them to extremities. Andrew
  sat in the dark, hurriedly going over his rifle and his revolver. Once he was
  about to throw open the door and try the effect of a surprise attack. He
  might plant two shots before there was a return; he let the idea slip away
  from him. There would remain two more, and one of them was certain to kill
  him.</p>

  <p>Moving across the room he heard a whisper from the floor: "I've heard
  them, Lanning. Don't be a fool. Give me up to 'em!"</p>

  <p>He made no answer. In the other room the voices were no longer restrained;
  Jeff Rankin's in particular boomed and rang and filled the shed. Once bent on
  action he was all for the attack; whisky had removed the last human scruple.
  And Andrew heard them openly cast their ballots for a new leader; heard
  Scottie acclaimed; heard the Scotchman say: "Boys, I'm going to show you a
  way to clean up on Dozier and Lanning, without any man risking a single shot
  from him in return."</p>

  <p>They clamored for the suggestion, but he told them that he was first going
  out into the open to think it over. In the meantime they had nothing to fear.
  Sit fast and have another drink around. He had to be alone to figure it
  out.</p>

  <p>It was very plain. The wily rascal would let them go one step farther
  toward an insanity of drink, and then, his own brain cold and collected, he
  would come back to turn the shack into a shambles. He had said he could do it
  without risk to them. There was only one possible meaning; he intended to use
  fire.</p>

  <p>Andrew sat with the butt of his rifle ground into his forehead. It was
  still easy to escape; the insistent whisper from the floor was pointing out
  the way: "Beat it out that back window, lad. Slope, Andy; they's no use. You
  can't help me. They mean fire; they'll pot you like a pig, from the dark.
  Give me up!"</p>

  <p>It was the advice to use the window that decided Andrew. It was a wild
  chance indeed, this leaving of Dozier helpless on the floor; but he risked
  it. He whispered to the marshal that he would return, and slipped through the
  window. He was not halfway around the house before he heard a voice that
  chilled him with horror. It was the marshal calling to them that Andrew was
  gone and inviting them in to finish him. But they suspected, naturally
  enough, that the invitation was a trap, and they contented themselves with
  abusing him for thinking them such fools.</p>

  <p>Andrew went on; fifty feet from the house and just aside from the shaft of
  light that fell from the open door, stood Scottie. His head was bare, his
  face was turned up to catch the wind, and no doubt he was dreaming of the
  future which lay before him as the new captain of Allister's band. The
  whisper of Andrew behind him cut his dream short. He whirled to receive the
  muzzle of a revolver in his stomach. His hands went up, and he stood gasping
  faintly in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"I've got you, Scottie," he said, "and so help me heaven, you're the first
  man that I've wanted to kill."</p>

  <p>It would have taken a man of supernerve to outface that situation. And the
  nerve of Scottie cracked.</p>

  <p>He began to whisper with a horrible break and sob in his breath: "Andy
  &mdash;Andy, gimme a chance. I'm not fit to go&mdash;this way. Andy,
  remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to give you a chance. You're pretty low, Scottie; I check what
  you've done to the way you hate Dozier, and I won't hold a grudge. And I'll
  tell you the chance you've got. You see these rocks, here? I'm goin' to lie
  down behind them. I'm going to keep you covered with my rifle. Scottie, did
  you ever see me shoot with a rifle?"</p>

  <p>Scottie shuddered&mdash;a very sufficient reply.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to keep you covered. Then you'll turn around and walk straight
  back to the shack. You'll stand there&mdash;always in clean sight of the
  doorway&mdash;and you'll persuade that crowd of drunks to leave the house and
  ride away with you. Understand, when you get inside the house, there'll be a
  big temptation to jump to one side and get behind the wall&mdash;just one
  twitch of your muscles, and you'd be safe. But, fast as you could move,
  Scottie, powder drives lead a lot faster. And I'll have you centered every
  minute. You'll make a pretty little target against the light, besides. You
  understand?</p>

  <p>"The moment you even start to move fast, I pull the trigger. Remember it,
  Scottie. For as sure as there's a hell, I'll send you into it head first, if
  you don't." "So help me heaven," said Scottie, "I'll do what I can. I think I
  can talk 'em into it. But if I don't?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't, you're dead. That's short, and that's sweet. Keep it in
  your head. Go back and tell them it would take too great a risk to try to fix
  me.</p>

  <p>"And there's another thing to remember. If you should be able to get
  behind the wall without being shot, you're not safe. Not by a long way,
  Scottie. I'd still be alive. And, though you'd have Hal Dozier there to cut
  up as you pleased, I'd be here outside the cabin watching it&mdash;with my
  rifle. And I'd tag some of you when you tried to get out. And if I didn't get
  you all I'd start on your trail. Scottie, you fellows, even when you had
  Allister to lead you, couldn't get off scot-free from Dozier. Scottie, I give
  you my solemn word of honor, you'll find me a harder man to get free from
  than Hal Dozier.</p>

  <p>"Here's the last thing: If you do what I tell you&mdash;if you get that
  crowd of drunken brutes out of the cabin and away without harming Dozier,
  I'll wipe out the score between us. No matter what you told the rest of them,
  you know I've never broken a promise, and that I never shall."</p>

  <p>He stopped and, stepping back to the rocks, sank slowly down behind them.
  Only the muzzle of his rifle showed, no more than the glint of a tiny bit of
  quartz; his left hand was raised, and, at its gesture, Scottie turned and
  walked slowly toward the cabin doorway. Once, stumbling over something, he
  reeled almost out of the shaft of light, but stopped on the edge of safety
  with a terrible trembling. There he stood for a moment, and Andrew knew that
  he was gathering his nerve. He went on; he stood in the doorway, leaning with
  one arm against it.</p>

  <p>What followed Andrew could not hear, except an occasional roar from
  Rankin. Once Larry la Roche came and stood before the new leader, gesturing
  frantically, and the ring of his voice came clearly to Andrew. The Scotchman
  negligently stood to one side; the way between Andrew and Larry was cleared,
  and Andrew could not help smiling at the fiendish malevolence of Scottie. But
  he was apparently able to convince even Larry la Roche by means of words. At
  length there was a bustling in the cabin, a loud confusion, and finally the
  whole troop went out. Somebody brought Scottie his saddle; Jeff Rankin came
  out reeling.</p>

  <p>But Scottie stirred last from the doorway; there he stood in the shaft of
  light until some one, cursing, brought him his horse. He mounted it in full
  view. Then the cavalcade started down the ravine.</p>

  <p>Certainly it was not an auspicious beginning for Scottie Macdougal.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap41"
     name="chap41"></a>CHAPTER 41</h2>

  <p class="first">The first ten days of the following time were the hardest;
  it was during that period that Scottie and the rest were most apt to return
  and make a backstroke at Dozier and Andrew. For Andrew knew well enough that
  this was the argument&mdash;the promise of a surprise attack&mdash;with which
  Scottie had lured his men away from the shack.</p>

  <p>During that ten days, and later, he adopted a systematic plan of work.
  During the nights he paid two visits to the sick man. On one occasion he
  dressed the wound; on the next he did the cooking and put food and water
  beside the marshal, to last him through the day.</p>

  <p>After that he went out and took up his post. As a rule he waited on the
  top of the hill in the clump of pines. From this position he commanded with
  his rifle the sweep of hillside all around the cabin. The greatest time of
  danger for Dozier was when Andrew had to scout through the adjacent hills for
  food &mdash;their supply of meat ran out on the fourth day.</p>

  <p>But the ten days passed; and after that, in spite of the poor care he had
  received&mdash;or perhaps aided by the absolute quiet&mdash;the marshal's
  iron constitution asserted itself more and more strongly. He began to mend
  rapidly. Eventually he could sit up, and, when that time came, the great
  period of anxiety was over. For Dozier could sit with his rifle across his
  knees, or, leaning against the chair which Andrew had improvised, command a
  fairly good outlook.</p>

  <p>Only once&mdash;it was at the close of the fourth week&mdash;did Andrew
  find suspicious signs in the vicinity of the cabin&mdash;the telltale
  trampling on a place where four horses had milled in an impatient circle. But
  no doubt the gang had thought caution to be the better part of hate. They
  remembered the rifle of Andrew and had gone on without making a sign.
  Afterward Andrew learned why they had not returned sooner. Three hours after
  they left the shack a posse had picked them up in the moonlight, and there
  had followed a forty-mile chase.</p>

  <p>But all through the time until the marshal could actually stand and walk,
  and finally sit his saddle with little danger of injuring the wound, Andrew,
  knowing nothing of what took place outside, was ceaselessly on the watch.
  Literally, during all that period, he never closed his eyes for more than a
  few minutes of solid sleep. And, before the danger line had been crossed, he
  was worn to a shadow. When he turned his head the cords leaped out on his
  neck. His mouth had that look, at once savage and nervous, which goes always
  with the hunted man.</p>

  <p>And it was not until he was himself convinced that Dozier could take care
  of himself that he wrapped himself in his blankets and fell into a
  twenty-four- hour sleep. He awoke finally with a start, out of a dream in
  which he had found himself, in imagination, wakened by Scottie stooping over
  him. He had reached for his revolver at his side, in the dream, and had found
  nothing. Now, waking, his hand was working nervously across the floor of the
  shack. That part of the dream was come true, but, instead of Scottie leaning
  over him, it was the marshal, who sat in his chair with his rifle across his
  knees. Andrew sat up. His weapons had been indeed removed, and the marshal
  was looking at him with beady eyes.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen 'em?" asked Andrew. "Have the boys shown themselves?"</p>

  <p>He started to get up, but the marshal's crisp voice cut in on him. "Sit
  down there."</p>

  <p>There had been&mdash;was it possible to believe it?&mdash;a motion of the
  gun in the hands of the marshal to point this last remark.</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Andrew, stunned, "what are you drivin' at?"</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking," said Hal Dozier. "You sit tight till I tell you what
  about."</p>

  <p>"It's just driftin' into my head, sort of misty," murmured Andrew, "that
  you've been thinkin' about double-crossin' me."</p>

  <p>"Suppose," said the marshal, "I was to ride into Martindale with you in
  front of me. That'd make a pretty good picture, Andy. Allister dead, and you
  taken alive. Not to speak of ten thousand I dollars as a background. That
  would sort of round off my work. I could retire and live happy ever after,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>Andrew peered into the grim face of the older man; there was not a flicker
  of a smile in it.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said, "but think twice, Hal. If I was you, I'd think ten
  times!"</p>

  <p>The marshal met those terrible, blazing eyes without a quiver of his
  own.</p>

  <p>"I began with thinking about that picture," he said. "Later on I had some
  other thoughts&mdash;about you. Andy, d'you see that you don't fit around
  here? You're neither a man-killer nor a law-abidin' citizen. You wouldn't fit
  in Martindale any more, and you certainly won't fit with any gang of crooks
  that ever wore guns. Look at the way you split with Allister's outfit! Same
  thing would happen again. So, as far as I can see, it doesn't make much
  difference whether I trot you into town and collect the ten thousand, or
  whether some of the crooks who hate you run you down&mdash;or some posse
  corners you one of these days and does its job. How do you see it?"</p>

  <p>Andrew said nothing, but his face spoke for him.</p>

  <p>"How d'you see the future yourself?" said the marshal. His voice changed
  suddenly: "Talk to me, Andy."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked carefully at him; then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you short and quick, Hal. I want action. That's all. I want
  something to keep my mind and my hands busy. Doing nothing is the thing I'm
  afraid of."</p>

  <p>"I gather you're not very happy, Andy?"</p>

  <p>Lanning smiled, and it was not a pleasant smile to see.</p>

  <p>"I'm empty, Hal," he answered. "Does that answer you? The crooks are
  against me, the law is against me. Well, they'll work together to keep me
  busy. I don't want any man's help. I'm a bad man, Hal. I know it. I don't
  deny it. I don't ask any quarter."</p>

  <p>It was rather a desperate speech&mdash;rather a boyish one. At any rate
  the marshal smiled, and a curious flush came in Andrew's face.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me tell you a story, Andrew? It's a story about
  yourself."</p>

  <p>He went on: "You were a kid in Martindale. Husky, good-natured, a little
  sleepy, with touchy nerves, not very confident in yourself. I've known other
  kids like you, but none just the same type.</p>

  <p>"You weren't waked up. You see? The pinch was bound to come in a town
  where every man wore his gun. You were bound to face a show-down. There were
  equal chances. Either you'd back down or else you'd give the man a beating.
  If the first thing happened, you'd have been a coward the rest of your life.
  But the other thing was what happened, and it gave you a touch of the iron
  that a man needs in his blood. Iron dust, Andy, iron dust!</p>

  <p>"You had bad luck, you think. You thought you'd killed a man; it made you
  think you were a born murderer. You began to look back to the old stories
  about the Lannings&mdash;a wild crew of men. You thought that blood was what
  was a- showing in you.</p>

  <p>"Partly you were right, partly you were wrong. There was a new strength in
  you. You thought it was the strength of a desperado. Do you know what the
  change was? It was the change from boyhood to manhood. That was all&mdash;a
  sort of chemical change, Andy.</p>

  <p>"See what happened: You had your first fight and you saw your first girl,
  all about the same time. But here's what puzzles me: according to the way I
  figure it, you must have seen the girl first. But it seems that you didn't.
  Will you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"We won't talk about the girl," said Andrew in a heavy voice.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut! Won't we? Boy, we're going to do more talking about her than
  about anything else. Well, anyway, you saw the girl, fell in love with her,
  went away. Met up with a posse which my brother happened to lead. Killed your
  man. Went on. Rode like the wind. Went through about a hundred adventures in
  as many days. And little by little you were fixing in your ways. You were
  changing from boyhood into manhood, and you were changing without any
  authority over you. Most youngsters have their fathers over them when that
  change comes. All of 'em have the law. But you didn't have either. And the
  result was that you changed from a boy into a man, and a free man. You hear
  me? You found that you could do what you wanted to do; nothing could hold you
  back except one thing &mdash;the girl!"</p>

  <p>Andrew caught his breath, but the marshal would not let him speak.</p>

  <p>"I've seen other free men&mdash;most people called them desperadoes.
  What's a desperado in the real sense? A man who won't submit to the law.
  That's all he is. But, because he won't submit, he usually runs foul of other
  men. He kills one. Then he kills another. Finally he gets the blood lust.
  Well, Andy, that's what you never got. You killed one man&mdash;he brought it
  on himself. But look back over the rest of your career. Most people think
  you've killed twenty. That's because they've heard a pack of lies. You're a
  desperado&mdash; a free man&mdash;but you're not a man-killer. And there's
  the whole point.</p>

  <p>"And this was what turned you loose as a criminal&mdash;you thought the
  girl had cut loose from you. Otherwise to this day you'd have been trying to
  get away across the mountains and be a good, quiet member of society. But you
  thought the girl had cut loose from you, and it hurt you. Man-killer? Bah!
  You're simply lovesick, my boy!"</p>

  <p>"Talk slow," whispered Andrew. "My&mdash;my head's whirling."</p>

  <p>"It'll whirl more, pretty soon. Andy, do you know that the girl never
  married Charles Merchant?"</p>

  <p>There was a wild yell; Andrew was stopped in mid-air by a rifle thrust
  into his stomach.</p>

  <p>"She broke off her engagement. She came to me because she knew I was
  running the manhunt. She begged me to let you have a chance. She tried to buy
  me. She told me everything that had gone between you. Andy, she put her head
  on my desk and cried while she was begging for you!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" whispered Andrew.</p>

  <p>"But I wouldn't lay off your trail, Andy. Why? Because I'm as proud as a
  devil. I'd started to get you and I'd lost Gray Peter trying. And even after
  you saved me from Allister's men I was still figuring how I could get you.
  And then, little by little, I saw that the girl had seen the truth. You
  weren't really a crook. You weren't really a man-killer. You were simply a
  kid that turned into a man in a day&mdash;and turned into a free man! You
  were too strong for the law.</p>

  <p>"Now, Andrew, here's my point: As long as you stay here in the mountain
  desert you've no chance. You'll be among men who know you. Even if the
  governor pardons you&mdash;as he might do if a certain deputy marshal were to
  start pulling strings&mdash;you'd run some day into a man who had an old
  grudge against you, and there'd be another explosion. Because there's
  nitroglycerin inside you, son!</p>

  <p>"Well, the thing for you to do is to get where men don't wear guns. The
  thing for you to do is to find a girl you love a lot more than you do your
  freedom, even. If that's possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" broke in Andy. "Hal, for pity's sake, tell me where she
  is!"</p>

  <p>"I've got her address all written out. She forgot nothing. She left it
  with me, she said, so she could keep in touch with me."</p>

  <p>"It's no good," said Andy suddenly. "I could never get through the
  mountains. People know me too well. They know Sally too well."</p>

  <p>"Of course they do. So you're not going to go with Sally. You're not going
  to ride a horse. You're going in another way. Everybody's seen your picture.
  But who'd recognize the dashing young man-killer, the original wild Andrew
  Lanning, in the shape of a greasy, dirty tramp, with a ten-days-old beard on
  his face, with a dirty felt hat pulled over one eye, and riding the brake
  beams on the way East? And before you got off the beams, Andrew, the governor
  of this State will have signed a pardon for you. Well, lad, what do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>But Andrew, walking like one dazed, had crossed the room slowly. The
  marshal saw him go across to the place where Sally stood; she met him
  halfway, and, in her impudent way, tipped his hat half off his head with a
  toss of her nose. He put his arm around her neck and they walked slowly off
  together.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Hal Dozier faintly, "what can you do with a man who don't
  know how to choose between a horse and a girl?"</p>
