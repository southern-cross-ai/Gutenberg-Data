<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Some</span> of the wisest and most benevolent
of modern Legislators, after careful and elaborate investigation,
have recommended <span class="a">Emigration</span>, as a happy
mode of relieving the country from the burthen of an unemployed
population. The relative position of the British Islands,
"<i>inter se</i>",&mdash;the peculiar consequences that have
resulted from the application of different laws, to different
parts of these countries&mdash;countries united by legal
enactments, and, since the invention of steam navigation,
connected, as it were, by flying bridges, have occasioned an
undue, partial, and perilous pressure; one that must continue to
increase, unless a safety pipe be provided for the reservoir, to
carry off the surplus water introduced by the continual stream of
the feeder. The wealth and industry of England cannot sustain her
against an inundation of the hungry and the destitute, which,
like the wave of the great ocean, in obedience to the laws of
nature, will continue to roll until it obtains its level. This
miserable mass of unoccupied and destitute poor presents a
calamitous picture, and, feeling as if they had been called into
life for no useful end, will at length become reckless and
desperate.</p>
<p>Would not Emigration go far in preserving the level of
wholesome water in the reservoir? Would it not prove a double
blessing, in relieving those who go and those that remain behind?
The present moment is a crisis in the doctrine of Emigration;
there, is a manifest and a daily deterioration in the condition
of our labouring poor; and while all other avenues to relief are
darkened, a light has just burst upon the cause of Colonial
Legislation, which gives new strength, and revives the sleeping
energies of many who had early fostered the growing spirit of
migration, yet despaired of obtaining sufficient encouragement
for those who were willing to run the serious hazard of its
trial.</p>
<p>The allusion is obvious,&mdash;he who has made this important
question the subject of reflection, during its latest agitation,
will readily comprehend it. The auspicious moment, then, at which
the publisher is enabled, through the kindness and influence of
Governor Stirling, to lay the following valuable and authentic
journals before the public, seemed also favorable to the
introduction of a few remarks, suggested by the documents
themselves; which, at another period, might appear less
legitimately incorporated with matter of a mere prefatory
nature.</p>
<p>The history of Swan River Settlement, and of its rapid but
steady progress to importance, has been, year after year,
submitted to the enquiring world, by the same publisher,
committed to him through the same benevolent and public spirit,
and by the individual to whom he is alike indebted for the
possession of this valuable collection of documentary
information.</p>
<p>In 1829, a short account appeared of the birth, infancy, and
increasing growth of this settlement, in which the manly
deportment of its enterprizing Governor, with his handful of
hardy followers, was fully detailed, in a. manner simple and
interesting. In the following pages will be found a continuation
of that history,&mdash;the increasing ambition of the first
settlers of the Colony,&mdash;the latest information of the state
of commerce and of society,&mdash;the prospects that may
reasonably be indulged in, both by those who are now warmed by
the brightening rays of its prosperity, as well as by those whose
native homes being less happy now meditate a participation in
those blessings, at no very distant period.</p>
<p>The authentic narratives here collected into a volume, contain
a simple and unaffected, dear and intelligible account of many
extensive and fertile districts explored, under the sanction and
protection of the local government, during the four last years.
Without pretending to scientific accuracy, the reader will find
that the most material objects of enquiry have been anticipated
and satisfactorily answered; and, duly considering the
difficulties and privations under which such journeys of
discovery are necessarily performed, will acknowledge, that
information more extensive and exact, has been thus supplied,
than even under circumstances of less inconvenience could have
been expected. Every exploring party, each individual, seems to
have imbibed that right feeling and anxious spirit of
investigation, possessed by their very popular Governor, and to
have undertaken their meritorious tasks from a two-fold
object&mdash;the public service and the personal approbation of
the head of the settlement.</p>
<p>The Journals extend their information over a vast field of
discovery, reaching from King George's Sound in the S.E., to the
district of Northam, near the Avon, to the N.E. of Perth;
including minute circumstantial details of much of the central
country, and faithful delineations of a considerable extent of
coast between Swan River and Albany.</p>
<p>The matter is given to the reader in the simple and original
language of the hardy adventurers, who themselves enacted the
bold scenes they there describe, in a style that bears internal
evidence of their truth. This mode appeared preferable for two
reasons: alteration in style might possibly endanger the
travellers' own meaning, besides, it is a respect due to the
meritorious exertions of the intelligent Journalists themselves,
to collect their sibylline leaves as they were waited across the
ocean, and throwing them into our portfolio, leave it to mankind
to interpret their contents.</p>
<p>Amongst the number and variety of new facts relative to
Western Australia, developed in the present Journals, some are of
so remarkable a character, as to demand an especial, although
brief, notice in this place.</p>
<p>The general appearance and character of the country in the
vicinity and district usually understood by "Swan River
Settlement", are here fully, finally, and satisfactorily
unfolded. The nature of the coast, its approachable as well as
inaccessible harbours enumerated and described, and the natural
productions of the whole territory amply set forth. Neither are
the apparent disadvantages of position, climate, soil, and other
drawbacks, urged against the settlement by its avowed enemies,
or, by the artful cruelty of pretended friends, concealed from
view. The origin of our information is above suspicion.</p>
<p>It seems uniformly conceded by all exploring parties, that the
great tract between Swan River and King George's Sound, bounded
by the Darling Mountains on the west, and by unknown regions on
the east, presents an undulating surface, averaging about 800
feet above sea level. The soil varies much in quality; in some
places sandy, in others a rich loam, with rocky pasture, amidst
regions of granite and limestone. Occasionally extensive forests
of noble timber encumber the surface, and sometimes single trees,
in all the luxuriance and pride of natural beauty, so decorate
the scene, that the landscape resembles the spacious park of some
wealthy proprietor, rather than a sylvan solitude in a
newly-discovered world.</p>
<p>Rivers and rivulets are extremely numerous, and water is found
in abundant supplies, notwithstanding the general prevalence
hitherto of a contrary belief: 'tis true that few rivers of any
magnitude have yet been traced. The courses of those that are yet
known are short and rapid, and if they should ultimately prove
unsuited to the purposes of navigation, they will still afford
ample sites for mills, and place an immense water power at the
disposal of the settlers. It is said that some of the mountain
torrents dry up in summer, while others, on the contrary, in
rainy seasons, expand and swamp great districts of level land.
The first objection may be advanced with equal truth, against the
rapid mountain rivulets in our own island; and the second, in all
probability, we shall be able to show, is a curable complaint. In
very many instances, the channels, water courses, or beds of the
rivers, are obstructed by huge trunks of trees, that at their
first decadency form substantial and convenient bridges, but
after awhile, their own weight bringing them deeper, they become
a perfect dam, and throw back the obstructed waters upon the
level district. This injury would not continue to be sustained by
improving settlers; it is too serious to be borne while the
remedy is so easy.</p>
<p>Such advances towards civilization certainly presuppose a
tolerable supply of labour, more than can, with truth, be stated
as now existing in those retired districts. It is possible, also,
that these swamps may arise from another cause, such as the
gushing up of a subterraneous river&mdash;an event of frequent
occurrence in countries of limestone formation; in which case, a
proper direction must given to the water-course. The chief and
real source of regret, as to the rivers of Western Australia, is,
that no great volume of water&mdash;no St Lawrence&mdash;has yet
been discovered, along whose surface the Australian barks might
glide with swiftness and security, and where the light pendants
of all nations of the world might freely wave.</p>
<p>That the navigable qualities of the West Australian rivers may
be made much more available than hitherto, is not improbable. A
species of boat has recently been constructed, adapted to
stillwater navigation, which lies on, rather than sinks into, the
water, is capable of being moved at the rate of ten miles an hour
with little difficulty, and attended with a very trifling
agitation of the sustaining surface.</p>
<p>Lagoons and salt lakes are scattered every where amidst the
valleys and the forests; the former constitute the necessary
drains of some encircling region; and the latter may be looked
upon as depositaries from whence wealth and commercial eminence
may hereafter be derived to the settlement.</p>
<p>From the unaffected style in which each little adventure is
narrated in the accompanying Journals, it is possible that a
conclusion might be drawn contrary to the real intentions of the
narrators, and at variance with truth. Each explorer speaks
occasionally of having passed so many hours on his journey
without meeting with fresh water, and of himself and
fellow-travellers carrying a supply along with them. It is proper
to observe upon these passages, that whenever the party adopted a
well-chosen route, they never suffered from the want of a
refreshing draught of water; but as they sometimes crossed the
highest points in search of extensive prospects, or forced their
way through the thickest parts of a forest, it is not at all
extraordinary that a day's journey might have been made, and no
cool fountain met with. And, let it be remembered, that, in every
instance where they chanced to meet a native, he infallibly
conducted them to a spring at no great distance from their
position.</p>
<p>This point is insisted on in this place, not only from the
importance of the subject, and desire to correct a too prevalent
error, but for this further reason, that attention may be invited
to the procuring of wholesome water in those districts where a
scarcity may be really felt Now, our Journalists assure us, that
they have <i>always</i> found water by digging; sometimes <i>with
their bare hands</i>, only to the depth of about one foot: if
this be true, as there is every reason to suppose it is, the
common mode of well sinking would be tolerably certain of
obtaining a supply; and the method of borings so successfully
attempted in France and England, called the "The Artesian Well",
might finally be called in to the settlers' aid, with an entire
dependence upon its efficacy.</p>
<p>The harbours, and character of the coast generally, form a
subject of anxious inquiry. Information upon this head is still
less full than could be wished, but, as far as our discoveries do
extend, they are satisfactory. Colonel Hanson asserts, "that
Princess Royal Harbour is equal to any port in the world." Our
latest survey establishes Cockburn Sound to be a safe and
excellent asylum. Gage's Road is a safe anchorage, but the
seasons as well as the soundings, should be well understood by
the mariner who approaches these shores. The recently explored
littorale of Geographe Bay presents a front of seventy miles in
extent, along which there is safe lying, with good anchorage, but
only during the summer season; and where possibly future ages
shall witness many a cargo shipped and landed at quays and wharfs
along this hospitable shore.</p>
<p>It would be foreign to the object of this prefatory sketch, to
touch upon the species of information useful to emigrants; this
service has already been well and satisfactorily performed;* but
it may be observed, generally, that since the publication of the
work here alluded to, new districts have been
explored,&mdash;additional depots and settlements
formed,&mdash;the number of settlers augmented, and the hardships
and terrors of early emigration to a newly'-discovered land
removed or mitigated.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In a Pamphlet entitled "Hints on Emigration",
&amp;c. London. J. Cross, 1836.]</p>
<p>Apprehension of violence from the natives was one of the
grievances of the "Terrorists", but this phantom has been
dissipated, as will appear from the simple story of individual
settlers having passed whole nights under the shelter of the
native's wig-wam, unarmed, and unaccompanied by any of their own
countrymen. The conduct of the natives has, from the
commencement, evinced a desire to cultivate friendly relations
with the whites. At Albany, they have actually submitted to the
imposition of some few articles of dress, whereby their presence
has been rendered less uncomfortable to members of a civilized
community.</p>
<p>Recent investigation has also added largely to the number and
value of the natural productions of Western Australia, from which
there are reasonable grounds for hoping that the commerce of the
settlement will speedily be extended to a profitable length, and
the comforts and happiness of the settler considerably augmented.
In addition to the varieties of mahogany, gumtrees, &amp;c., a
valuable species of oak, and of large dimensions, has been found
in the country north of Augusta, a new and very promising
settlement, at the embouchure of the Blackwood river. One
district has been found peculiarly adapted to the culture of the
vine, which may here be conducted, as at the pyramidal rocks of
Goodesburg, up the almost naked front of the limestone cliffs.
The waters of the salt-pools, when an intercourse shall be opened
between the sea and the interior, may be compelled to evaporate
and yield their briny depositions to the children of industry and
enterprise; and the cotton plant may yet be seen putting forth
its beautiful flowers on the Australian saline marshes as
vigourously as in the transatlantic world. A good brick clay
supplies convenient and manageable material for building; but
there can be no doubt it will shortly be superseded by the more
permanent natural material of granite or limestone, when passable
roads and navigable rivers shall render the removal of heavy
masses practicable.</p>
<p>In estimating the probable chances of success, the ingenuity
of the settler ought to be directed to the discovery of the best
modes of abridging labour, and much will depend upon timely and
wise determination on this point. This is an important question,
and surrounded with difficulties. Labourers could, of course, be
imported from the parent country, but the expense of transport,
and of after maintenance startle the young adventurer. The
presence of convicts is irksome in a settlement of freemen, and
where crime is, happily, as yet, less known than in the countries
from which they have emigrated. Yet, without a large supply of
labour, or some obedient power, improvement and civilization must
stand still.</p>
<p>A few suggestions for the abridgment of labour and general
amelioration of the settler, by the assistance of modern
scientific inventions, have been already introduced; it remains
now to address some words of advice, or rather matter for
reflection. Let it be borne in mind that this country is
principally adapted to pastoral pursuits, and offers very great
advantages for the investment of capital in that way. The first
and greatest want in the settlement is "communication by lines of
road". This cannot be supplied without a command of labour. Would
it not be worth the consideration of all parties, whether convict
labour might not be applied, without compromising the dignity and
moral feeling of the settlement? If the intrusion of criminals
into the presence of the settlers be too irksome to be borne, let
their labour be expended on those portions of each line of road
most remote from the established settlement, while the
termination adjacent to each town shall be formed by
free-labourers, remunerated, as may be arranged, amongst the
inhabitants. It is probable, too, that, after some of the
principal and most necessary lines shall have been completed, the
natives will bring their labour into market, at rates more
reasonable than the free whites, and under circumstances more
comfortable than would attend the employment of convicts.</p>
<p>Whenever the interior shall be rendered accessible by lines of
road, the settlers may call to mind, with gratitude, the vast
natural resources that have lain for so many ages concealed
within. Then may their opening prospects be compared to the
natural formation of the great region of Australia, surrounded by
low-lying sand-banks and forbidding coasts, that alarm the
emigrant at his first approach, but when Once the breakers are
cleared, and a safe asylum reached within, all is beautiful, and
bright, and happy-looking.</p>
<p>The peculiar manner in which the surface is timbered presents
features both beautiful and advantageous on the southern coast.
Detached trees of mature growth are scattered over the greater
part of the low land, only sufficiently numerous to supply a
grateful shelter to the flocks and crops, and form an ornamental
screen to the dwelling ci the settler.</p>
<p>The vast water power of which the Australians are possessed
should be immediately and profitably directed. Besides the
establishment of mills for various objects, advantage should be
taken of the same sites for the expeditious division of timber,
by means of the "Portable Saw Mill", a modern invention, and
likely to prove of inconceivable benefit in remote wooded
districts.</p>
<p>The manufacture of glass, pottery, and iron, are resources
that will hereafter be found available, though now, from
necessity, kept in abeyance.</p>
<p>So much of introductory matter appeared to the publisher to be
demanded, by the valuable quality of the collected Journals,
which succeed it, at the advanced age of this rapidly increasing
settlement.</p>
<p>The first establishment of a few persons at Swan River
afforded an exercise for the ingenuity of the base and wicked, in
holding up false lights, and drawing the adventurer upon shoals,
where his fortunes were wrecked and his heart was broken; but the
period has now happily arrived when such infamous practices must
prove abortive.</p>
<p>It is not expected that converts to the cause of emigration
will be made by the publication of the accompanying authentic
documents; they constitute only a small, but certainly a very
valuable portion of the history of the settlement. The ends hoped
for are, by giving publicity to their contents, to disabuse the
public mind of erroneous statements, circulated by interested
foreigners, relative to Australia generally, and to assist those
who already meditate the adoption of a new country, in forming a
true estimate of the chances of happiness likely to attend their
migration thither.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>A JOURNAL</strong> <i>of the
proceedings of a party of Officers and men, (21 in number,)
landed from His Majesty's Ship Challenger, at Browne Mount,
Cockburn Sound, June 26, 1829, for the purpose of exploring the
Canning River and the intervening country, as respects the Soil,
&amp;c.</i>.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Landed at 10, a.m. and
proceeded in an E. by S. direction; the first mile was a perfect
sandy surface; we then came on to a dark red soil, which extended
about the same distance, and then had the sand again mixed with
dark earth, which continued without any perceptible change to the
end of this day's journey, about nine miles from the place of
debarkation; but to accomplish this distance, we travelled over
about twelve miles of country, with generally an undulating
grassy surface, thinly covered with trees of various dimensions,
and of the same kind as those on the coast. About six miles from
the place we landed, we passed to the southward of a lagoon of
fresh water; and where we bivouaced for the night there was
another extensive lake, and we pitched our tents on the rising
ground near its S.E. extremity.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 8, a.m. resumed our journey,
and after we had advanced about two miles, we passed to the
southward of a deep and rather extensive swamp; and about the
same distance further on, we passed through another, which was
neither so deep nor extensive as the first. Continued on again
three miles, and then we crossed a stream about six or seven feet
wide; and a mile further another, about the same width, both
running to the southward in a parallel direction. Nine miles from
the lake we left in the morning, an agreeable and sudden change
took place in the scenery; we had almost imperceptibly ascended
an eminence commanding an extensive view of a vast plain, bounded
to the eastward by a range of majestic mountains, an opening in
which being observed, we crossed the plain a little to the
eastward of our destined course, and in a distance of about ten
miles we entered between two ranges, and discovered the Canning
River, rushing over its rocky bed with considerable impetuosity
and running to the northward. We bivouaced on a small island
formed by a stream from the river curving to the eastward and
re-uniting a little lower down. Respecting the nature and quality
of the soil, &amp;c. passed through to day, the first particular
change was observed soon after we entered the plain, when we
found a yellow marl; of a nature I think well calculated for
making bricks; this extended about a mile; it then continued
sandy with gravelly patches, till approaching the base of the
mountains, where the surface is entirely covered with coarse
gravel and loose stones.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 7 a.m. ascended the summit
of a mountain 1000 feet in height, for the purpose of obtaining a
more extensive view of the surrounding country, but the density
of the atmosphere was so greats that objects were only visible a
few miles to the westward, where little is interest presented
itself; and to the eastward nothing was discernible but a
succession of lofty mountains, covered with trees. At nine,
descended to the river, and passed to the left bank, and in our
progress along its course to the northward, we were soon
gratified by finding good red soil, which continued (with an
occasional mixture of sand) for about five miles. The river then
divided into two branches, and the ground became swampy; crossed
the western and lesser stream, and endeavoured to follow the
course of the principal one, which tended more to the northward,
but we were shortly interrupted by a deep, reedy swamp, which
forced us to pursue our course more to the westward, and in doing
which we lost sight of the river altogether; but after a few
miles' walk over good soil and through several small swamps, we
found it again, but so much reduced by passing through and
inundating an extent of low marshy ground, that we were induced
to cross to the northward, and proceed direct to the mountains,
two miles distant, to be fully satisfied that it had not branched
off in that direction. But observing, from the top of a hill,
water N. by W. advanced in that bearing about 4 miles, over a
sandy surface, and bivouaced on rising ground in the vicinity of
a small sheet of water, after a journey of eighteen miles, but
not more than twelve distant from the ravines left in the
morning.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 8 a.m. proceeded in a W.N.W
direction, and in half an hour fell in with the river about
sixteen feet broad; we crossed over by a fallen tree, and pursued
our Journey down the left bank, the river gradually widening as
we descended, and presenting on each side, for a space of ten
miles, the richest verdure and most luxurious vegetation. The
ground then became marshy, and me river more irregular in its
course; we passed through a large swamp, and bivouaced on an
elevated sandy spot convenient to the river, where it was nearly
a mile broad, and the water brackish.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 8 a.m. continued our
journey, following the course of the river through a number of
small swamps, and several streams of good water, and after a walk
of about eight miles over a sandy soil, we reached its junction
with the Swan, at Melville Water: proceeded through the same
description of country to the military post at the mouth of the
latter river, where we met with the kindest reception, and most
hospitable entertainment from Captain Irwin and the Officers of
the detachment of the 63d regiment. Having traversed the country
from Cockburn Sound to the Darling Mountains, and followed, with
little interruption, the course of the Canning River from near
the source to the mouth, the general impression resulting from a
minute observation as a hurried journey would permit, is, that
with trifling exceptions, the soil above the salt water is of a
quality suited for all the purposes of agriculture. I cannot
conclude these remarks without observing, that during this
journey of 100 miles or upwards, not a native was seen, which is
pretty conclusive that they are not very numerous. But there can
be little doubt we passed close to some of them, as we saw
several of their wig-wams, and many traces of themselves; and it
is more than probable they did not like our appearance, and
avoided us; and from the nature of the country, and their
superior power of vision, they have easy means of
concealment.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>A JOURNAL</strong> <i>of the
proceedings of a party of Officers and men, belonging to His
Majesty's Ship Sulphur, landed on the 8th of September, 1829, for
the purpose of crossing the Darling Range of Mountains, under the
orders of Lieutenant Preston, R.N.</i></p>
<p>Left the ship at 10 a.m.; after beating for an hour and a
half, found too much sea to attempt to cross the bar; bore up for
Woodman's Point, and landed at noon; all the party excessively
drenched; got all the provisions on shore, buried the casks, and
proceeded with the rest of the baggage to Fremantle, where we
arrived safe at 6 o'clock, men very tired; found Mr. Dawson
there, sent him to Perth immediately, so as to be ready to meet
the boats according to his orders; next morning took possession
of the two tents allotted us.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 5 o'clock sent Mr.
Disney with the men to Woodman's Point to bring up the remainder
of provisions, but knowing them to be too heavy for one trip, and
it being particularly desirable to leave Fremantle that day, in
consequence of spirits being easily obtained, and several of the
men ill in consequence, hired Mr. Wells's cart and two horses to
meet our men half way, which they did, and arrived at Fremantle
at 10 o'clock; found Mr. Collie had struck the tents and got all
the light baggage into the boats, so that we were able to leave
by 2 o'clock, accompanied by Mr. Knight, a settler, who was
desirous of accompanying us, and Mr. Dawson on our passage up,
who was returning to Fremantle for the purpose of taking up
provisions so as to enable the soldiers to join us up the
Canning; at 5, rounded Point Heathcot, and landed on the second
low Point, on the left bank of the Canning, of course on our
right, where we rested for the night. Soil&mdash;siliceous sand,
with a small portion of black mould; prevailing
trees&mdash;banksias, casuarinas, and grass tree; the low
vegetation&mdash;small shrubs, chiefly in beautiful flower;
birds&mdash;cockatoos and paroquets; wind N.W. with occasional
showers.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 6, struck the tents and
breakfasted; appearance of the jolly boat; hearing Mr. Dale
wished to join the party, I sent Mr. Gilbert in the Dingy to
Perth for him, as I was fearful the party of soldiers would not
be able to join before starting for the mountains; commenced our
route up the Canning, which we found run in a much more westerly
direction than laid down in the chart; the appearance of the soil
on both sides of the river was sandy. At 10 a.m. arrived at the
island, when we waited for the Dingy; landed on the left bank,
and found it the same as where we rested for the night; at 10
o'clock, Dingy joined us, and proceeded up the river at a slow
rate, in consequence of the stream running down very strong;
landed some of our party on the left bank, and Mr. Dale on the
right to walk, as the boats were too deep; about half an hour
afterwards, Mr. Disney called out, Mr. Dale is amongst the
natives; landed immediately and joined him; found five natives
had come upon him suddenly, but were very friendly; gave a swan,
some rings, knives, beads, &amp;c., and received in exchange,
spears and a stone hatchet, and parted very good friends; it
being late and a strong rapid to pass, dropped down a few hundred
yards, and pitched our tents on an elevated part of the right
bank, of brownish loam, fit for any common agricultural purpose.
During our passage up the river after getting above the islands,
we landed twice on the right bank, and found good soil each time,
but not any distance from the river. The birds, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
the same as yesterday; heard several shots fired down the river,
supposing it to be the jolly boat with the soldiers; answered
them until 11 o'clock, when they ceased; wind N.W. with
showers.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Struck tents at 6; fired
Several shots, which were answered from the jolly boat; fearing
they would not be able to join us, from the rapid stream that was
running down; sent Mr. Gilbert down in the Dingy with orders to
Mr. Dawson to land the soldiers and return to Fremantle, and for
him to bring up the provisions and baggage; sent a party with Mr.
Dale to walk, and proceeded up the river with great difficulty in
the whale boat; at 1 o'clock, landed about a quarter of a mile
above the place where Captain Fremantle bivouaced, and made that
our rendezvous. Pitched tents, and were soon joined by nine
natives, five of whom we had seen the day before. At 2, Mr.
Gilbert returned, having executed the orders I had given him; at
3, the party of soldiers arrived, which did not appear to
surprise the natives, who were still with us; wind N.W. with very
heavy rain; afternoon, occasional showers.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Weather very unsettled;
having completed provisions for eight days for twelve men, at
half past 8 left the encampment, accompanied by Messrs. Dale,
Gilbert, Knight, and eight seamen, for the purpose of proceeding
in an east course over the mountains; in an hour, arrived at the
foot of them, the distance not being more than three miles; after
walking a quarter of a mile over very good soil, we came upon a
plain of sandy soil, mixed with a small portion of red and black
mouldy covered with the grass tree, which extended to the foot of
the mountains. Crossed a small stream running to the southward,
which we afterwards traced to the Canning; seeing a lateral
valley, made for it and began ascending, leaving two conspicuous
patches of whitish rock on the brow of the ridge to our right;
kept along the run of water in this valley, both sides of which
are covered with loose fragments of quartz and granite rock,
having a little light soil between them, supporting small shrubs
and the grass tree. At half past 11, rested in front of a
beautiful small water fall, where the cedar and stringy bark,
banksias, and blue gum-trees abound. Noon, resumed our journey;
three quarters of an hour, arrived at the summit of the first
range (which I estimate at 1000 feet high,) where the surface
presents the same appearance as just mentioned, with a mixture of
iron stone; the trees similar to those at the water fall. In
proceeding, found the mountains to be continued ridges, with
small intervening dales filled with marshes. At 3, halted for the
night on the side of a swamp, where we found good water from a
small stream running to the southward, which most likely is dry
in summer; heard the shout of a native, who was seen by one of
the party, and for the first time heard the yell of a native dog.
The few birds seen this day were the cockatoos and paroquets;
course E. ½ S. fifteen miles; wind N.W. with heavy showers.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 13<i>th</i>&mdash;Resumed our journey,
passing over precisely the description of country and productions
as yesterday, after arriving at the summit of the first range;
noon, halted for a quarter of an hour on the side of a small
stream running to the N.N.W. and then pursued our route over
continued ridges until half past 2, when we crossed a marsh with
a small stream running to the southward, and rested for the night
in a close wooded country, without any appearance of an opening.
Men very tired; the surface was a mixture of siliceous sand and
clay in the dales, having large fragments of granite rode and
iron stone thickly scattered upon the ridges, in many places
almost entirely bare of low vegetation; the same trees, generally
of immense size, the largest hollowed out at the root by fires.
Course E. ½ S. distance eighteen miles; wind N.N.W. with
squalls.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at 8; occupied
till a quarter past 9 in crossing a marsh; saw a kangaroo rat,
which Mr. Gilbert having fired at, we heard the cry of several
native women and children, occasioned most likely by the report;
saw them flying in every direction from us, but did not attempt
to follow them; saw the smoke from a fire they had just lighted;
left some feathers, handkerchiefs, &amp;c.; after proceeding
about a quarter of a mile, saw a native boy about seven years of
age running before us, whom we might have taken, but did not
interfere with him; he, however, from fright dropped a spear,
which I picked up and stuck in the ground; noon, ascended a very
high ridge, and for the first time got a view of higher ridges,
bearing from N. by E. to S.E. by E. distant about thirty miles;
rested a quarter of an hour and then proceeded down a very deep
dale, with a beautiful rivulet running over broken pieces of
granite rock to the N.N.W.; continued our course up a very great
ascent. Half past 1, passed a swamp with a small stream running
southward; at half past 12, halted and climbed a high tree for
the purpose of obtaining a view; saw an opening to the eastward,
walked on to it with the gentlemen, leaving the men at the place
for bivouacing, and came to a small opening destitute of large
trees, where we had an extensive view of successive ridges from
N. by E. to S.E. by S., the furthest distant about thirty or
thirty-five miles, and appeared to be considerably higher than
the part we had passed over; the place where I then was I
considered to be 800 feet higher than the first ridge.
Considering that such an extent of mountainous country as this
view afforded, in addition to what we had actually traversed,
without the least indication of soil that could be turned to any
agricultural purpose, destroyed the hopes of finding any thing in
this direction that could be turned to any useful purpose in the
present state of the colony, I deemed it wholly unnecessary to
advance any further; and I was confirmed in this resolution, by
knowing that our provisions would not have lasted to allow us to
go to the boundary of our present view and return. I was now the
more anxious to retrace my route, as I expected his Excellency
the Lieutenant Governor might wish us to proceed in a more
promising direction. The country passed over this day was much
the same as yesterday, with the exception of more herbage and
trees more numerous, the less iron stone and more quartz. Course,
E. 14 miles; wind N.W. with rain at intervals. Not having any
water near us, commenced our march back to the stream we had
crossed running to the northward; at forty-five minutes past 3,
advanced to and crossed it; having returned west four miles and a
half, found three native huts in which the offices slept, and
built a bark hut for the men. Sunset, wind N.W. with heavy rain,
which continued all night, completely drenching the men and
spoiling a great quantity of bread and all the sugar; the
officers' provisions were dry, but not themselves; heard several
native dogs during the night.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Raining hard and the
baggage wet, as I commenced our march homewards, keeping a little
to the southward of our outward track, walking very quick until
noon, when we rested for a quarter of an hour; crossed two small
streams running to the southward; passed on the left side of a
high ridge we had gone over the day before, and found a marsh
about a mile and a half long running E. &amp; W. with a small
stream to the E.S.E. which appeared to turn more to the
southward. Fifteen minutes past 3 bivouaced, the men in a bark
hut and the officers in one similar to the natives, but built by
themselves; course W. twenty-three miles; wind N.W. with heavy
rain. The men were very much fatigued, almost all their shoes
worn out and their clothes much torn.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;At half past 8 resumed our
journey, walked quick, saw several kangaroo rats, passed a small
stream running to the W.N.W., which we afterwards found took its
course through the Darling range; half past 11 saw an opening to
the westward; noon, found it to be the western range; rested for
half an hour for the purpose of obtaining bearings, but owing to
the density of the atmosphere and heavy rain, it was impossible,
although Mr. Gilbert thought he saw Garden Island, and in the
direction pointed out bore W.S.W.; descended the mountain in a
valley with a stream running down it, about a mile to the
southward of where we ascended at 2; three of the natives we had
met before joined us and took us a short route to the tents,
where we arrived about 3 o'clock very wet, and the remainder of
the provisions much damaged.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rainy weather and blowing
hard from the N.W.; men employed preparing to return mi boards
and washing their clothes; a party crossed the river and found
the good land to extend further from the water than on the side
we were, and the soil rather superior. Mr. Knight saw one emu,
and Mr. Gilbert saw two large kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 6, launched the boats;
Mr. Dale and a party of twelve set off to walk to the islands;
found the river from the late rains had risen upwards of two
feet; twenty minutes past 6 started, and arrived at the islands
by 10 o'clock, where we waited for Mr. Dale until one, fearing
they had lost their way by keeping too much to the northward;
left Mr. Gilbert there in the Dingy and proceeded lower down in
the whale boat; about an hour afterwards saw the Dingy coming,
the party having arrived a quarter of an hour after I left, and
continued to walk along the bank of the river; took them in at
the mouth of the Canning, and proceeded to Perth, where we
arrived at 6 o'clock and rested for the night.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left Perth at forty-five
minutes past 7, and arrived at Fremantle at 11 o'clock, where we
found the Yawl; gave the men a quarter of an hour's rest and
embarked; arrived on board at 3 o'clock.</p>
<p><span class="a">Remarks</span>.&mdash;On going up the river,
found the water perfectly fresh: about half way between the
distance we bivouaced and the islands, on coming down, passed
over the flats without touching, and Mr. Dale informed me that
many parts of the banks were much flooded in the course of his
walk from, the encampment to the mouth of the Canning. The iron
stone, so abundant up the mountains, was found to possess
distinct magnetic polarity.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>EXTRACT OF A LETTER</strong>
<i>received from Dr. J.B. Wilson, R.N., dated King George's
Sound</i>, 15<i>th December</i>, 1829.</p>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> understood that the N. Eastern
and Eastern parts of the country had been explored to some
distance by Major Lockyer, Captain Wakefield, Messrs. Tallemath
and Butler, I decided to pursue a North-westerly course in the
direction of Swan River for three or four days, then to proceed
W. then South, and to return by the sea coast. All being prepared
for our departure, Mr. Kent, myself, and our cortege, (two crown
prisoners, and an intelligent native of the name of Mokare,)
increased by a soldier of the 39th who had volunteered, left the
settlement early on Wednesday morning, proceeding N.N.W. About
seven miles, we crossed a considerable stream running easterly,
supposed the principal branch of King's River; and about three
miles further we passed another, of smaller size, running in the
same direction. In the evening we bivouaced near a lagoon of some
magnitude; the water, although of little depth, was
excellent.</p>
<p>On Thursday at daylight, we resumed our journey N.N.W. About
nine o'clock we arrived at a large lagoon, from three to six feet
deep, where we halted a little. Passing to the westward of this,
in a short time we observed another extensive sheet of water a
few hundred yards on our right. Mokare informed us that the
natives came to these lagoons in dry seasons, when the smaller
lagoons failed. Between the first and second the following
bearings were taken. The most westerly peak of Porrongor-up N.E.,
distant about twelve miles, the Churin to the eastward of the
peak N.E. by E. At eleven o'clock we crossed a mountain stream
running to the south-westward, through a valley where the land
began to improve, and the banksia and other plants common to a
sterile soil, to disappear. At six o'clock, we halted for the
night on the banks of a limpid mountain-stream, running south
westerly through a valley, the land of which would not suffer
much by comparison with the best on the banks of the celebrated
Swan. It must be confessed, however, that the rich alluvial soil
is of no great breadth, yet the fine sheep walks by the gently
swelling, lightly wooded adjacent hills, might compensate in some
degree for that deficiency.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, we directed our course N.W. by W.; passed
through a country beautifully diversified by moderately elevated
hills, and fertile verdant valleys, adorned and enriched by
streams of the purest water. About nine o'clock we proceeded
eastward to gain the summit of a hill seen in that direction, for
the purpose of obtaining a panoramic view of the surrounding
country. A connected cluster of small hills was noticed, turning
from E. by N. to N.W.; the westward peak of Porrongor-up bore E.
half S., and the westerly point of Morril-up range N.E. by E.
Having left this, we resumed our course, and passed over a tract
(about eight miles) of very indifferent, or rather vary barren
country; we then arrived at a swampy flat, where, being abundance
of good water, we halted for a short time. Departing from thence,
and altering our course a little more to the northward, a rich
and romantic country soon burst into view, which we found
abundantly supplied with good water. In the evening we bivouaced
near a stream running N.W. through a tract of land bearing
considerable resemblance, both in appearance and quality, to the
cow pastures.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as the kangaroo had been skipping about us from
the time we entered into this fine open forest land, I gave the
men half a day to prevent interruption in our journey. Mr. Kent
and myself walked to the westward, and the others to the
eastward. About noon we re-assembled, unsuccessful, the kangaroo
far too fleet for the dogs, and the sportsmen, from the nature of
the country, could not approach sufficiently near them
unperceived. The land walked over by both parties was observed to
continue good. Here we received a visit from a native, (whose
good condition and well-formed limbs indicated abundance of
nutriment); he came up to us with much confidence, and partook of
our repast. Mokare knew him: on understanding our intention of
proceeding west, and returning to King George's Sound by the
sea-coast, he advised us not to do so, as travelling was very bad
in that direction. He invited us to accompany him to the
eastward, where the best lands lie, and where we would shortly
meet "Will" with a number of his tribe, who would be glad to see
us. To this request Mokare added his earnest solicitation, and
was exceedingly chagrined to find his eloquence of no avail.</p>
<p>We now altered our course directly north, and passed through a
country of the same general character, good open forest land.
About sunset we reached a valley, almost entirely destitute of
trees. So much has been said of the scenery in New South Wales
resembling noble English domains, that the comparison is rather
trite. Imagine a rich valley of considerable widths extending E.
and W. as far as the eye can survey, bounded on the south and
north by a succession of undulating and moderately elevated,
hills, thinly but sufficiently ornamented with trees of gigantic
form, and you may have some conception of the beauty of the spot,
where, near a pool of water, we bivouaced on Saturday evening,
Mokare having shot a kangaroo of a large size, all the party were
in high glee preparing the feast. We were now nearly seventy
miles in a N.W. direction from the settlement, in a country well
adapted either for pastural or agricultural purposes, and I
regretted exceedingly that want of time compelled me to make it
the "ne plus ultra" of my excursion northerly, where I am
convinced the same kind of land exists to a great extent.</p>
<p>Sunday at daylight, we proceeded west. About nine o'clock we
arrived at a shallow lagoon, the water of which tasted rather
brackish to us who were become fastidious. Perceiving waiter a
short distance directly north from this, we proceeded thither,
and observed a circular basin of water about half a mile in
diameter, literally covered with black swans, ducks, teel, and
other aquatic birds. The lake is surrounded by a belt of about
fifty yards wide of tall reeds; at the inner margin of this belt
the water is upwards of six feet deep. The Hirundo Medicinalis
was found in great, plenty, an important object to some future
Australian Broussars. The birds being disturbed flew to the
lagoon to the south of the lake, and being again disturbed, flew
directly south, thereby rendering it probable that other
collections of water exist in that direction, which may receive,
as I imagine, the various streams running N.W.</p>
<p>Leaving this lake, (named Loch Kathrine,) we continued our
course to the westward, and soon perceived that we had left the
good land behind. After having travelled a few miles over a
barren scrubs observing what we thought a rising ground to the
northward, we bent our steps thither, and found it was good
forest land, the altitude of the trees giving it the appearance
of considerable elevation. We again proceeded westerly, and
passed over a tract of country as miserable and useless as any to
be found in New South Wales. In the evening we reached and
suddenly re-entered on a fine open country, several hundred acres
being without a tree; this was very pleasing to us, disheartened
and tired by our fatiguing journey. We went to the southward two
or three miles in search of water, the first time we had occasion
to do so; by digging a hole we obtained an ample supply of good
quality.</p>
<p>On Monday, at break of day, we continued our westerly course.
About noon we arrived at and crossed a fine stream running south,
which, in compliment to the gentleman who accompanied me, was
named the Kent. Having halted here half an hour, we pursued our
journey in a N.N.W. direction for the highest part of a range of
hills trending from S. by E. to N.W. Early in the evening we
bivouaced near a running stream, in the midst of a wide and
picturesque glen; the temperature, had other indications been
wanting, sufficiently proving us to be among the mountains.
During this day's journey we passed over some good land, and more
that might be made something of; but by far the greatest portion
was very indifferent.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we directed our course S.S.W., taking care to
leave on our left all the streams we met with, one excepted, of
no inconsiderable magnitude, running directly west, which was
named the "Macquoid", in compliment to the High Sheriff of New
South Wales. In this manner we proceeded over hills and dales
till our progress was arrested by a swamp about two miles wide,
trending westward round the mountains. Mr. Rare and others of the
party expressing some repugnance at passing directly across it,
we took a detour easterly and passed through where it was much
narrower, and not above two or three feet deep. As at this time
the thunder was rolling heavily along, the peals rendered more
terrific and sublime by the echoing hills; the rain pouring down
in torrents, and some of the explorers (some of whom wished
themselves elsewhere) up to the middle in water, we thought it
might not inaptly be called the "dismal swamp." This being
passed, we proceeded in a southerly direction through a barren
iron-stone and quartz country, interrupted by stripes of good
land, and in the evening arrived at another swamp about 150 yards
wide and two or three feet deep, trending round the hills; having
passed this, we bivouaced earlier than common, being somewhat
fatigued with this day's march.</p>
<p>Wednesday at day light we proceeded in a southerly direction,
through a country where the transitions from good to bad land,
and vice versa, were frequent and sudden. About 9 we perceived a
high insulated conical hill, bearing E. by S., whither we
directed our course, passing through a valley of great extent, of
which the soil was a rich red loam. About 1 p.m. halted in a deep
hollow glen, through the bottom of which rushed with velocity, an
impetuous mountain torrent. The trees (principally blue gum, box,
and apple tree) were of enormous size. At 4 p.m. Mr. Kent,
myself, and Mokare began to ascend the mountain, and reached its
highest summit by half past 6, when we enjoyed a view that amply
repaid all our fatigue. I have seen many far-famed views in the
four ancient divisions of the globe, and have no hesitation in
saying, that this of the fifth, if it did not surpass, fell but
little short of any of them. The highest peak is about 30 yards
square, perfectly level, paved with minute particles of quartz,
and at each angle is an immense block of granite. In compliment
to the officers of the 39th regiment, this was named Mount
Lindesay; from it the following bearings were taken, but as I had
only a small pocket compass, strict accuracy cannot be expected
or obtained. From the S.E. angle. Mount Melville, E.S.E.;
Peak-head S.E. by E. easterly; east point of Porrongor-up,
northerly; south head of a large inlet, (close to the sea from
N.E. by E. to S.W. by W.) south easterly; high hill to the west
of the inlet, under which is apparently the communication with
the sea, S. by W.</p>
<p>From the N.E. angle, the western point of Morril-up N.E. by
E.; from this bearing to N.W., except some very distant high land
bearing N. by E., the country is perfectly level as far as the
eye can behold; from the N.W. the land rises and becomes
gradually higher. From the point round to the southward it
resembles the ocean convulsed in a storm; or a better idea may be
formed of its appearance, by imagining segments of circles
increasing in height as they increase in diameter; in the
mountainous region these hills are conspicuous from their
superior altitude, and as they will be grand points in a
trigonometrical survey of the country, they were named after the
Surveyors' General.</p>
<p>From N.W. angle of Mount Lindesay&mdash;</p>
<p>A high peaked hill (Mount Roe) N.W. by W.</p>
<p>A double peaked hill (Mount Mitchell) N.W. by W. ¾ W.</p>
<p>A high peaked hill (Mount Franklin) W. by N. westerly.</p>
<p>From the S.W. angle, group of islands, middle of the west and
largest isle, S.W. by S. westerly; very high distant land W.
southerly. Right extreme visible point of the sea W. by S. ½ S.
supposed Cape Nuyts, S.W. ½ W; and greatly to my delight, just as
the sun went down, assisted by refraction, a large expanse of
interior water was observed close to the sea coast bearing S.W. ½
S. I supposed it near to Cape Chatham, perhaps to the westward.
These observations being made, and the sublimely magnificent
scene admired, until day-light departed, we descended the
mountain and reached our encampment between nine and ten in the
evening.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning we walked round the southern base of Mount
Lindesay, and soon met another stream; wound round its eastern
side, which, joining to that where we halted last night, found a
stream of some magnitude, being about thirty feet wide and five
deep, running directly south. This reach, however, extends only a
few hundred yards, when it expands and runs rapidly over a
granite rocky bed. The banks of this river (which was named the
Denmark, in compliment to the physician of the Fleet, of that
name) are rich, but, as readily may be imagined, from the abrupt
nature of the country, they are very narrow. The surrounding
hills, however, are of very fine soil, and may easily be turned
to good account; the timber (principally blue gum) is the finest
I ever saw. Having left this delightful scenery, we proceeded
S.E., crossing in our way several streams of pore water, running
southerly, not much inferior in size to the Jordan, Clyde, Bargo,
Emogallah,&mdash;<i>et hoc genus omne</i>. This day's march was,
from the nature of the country, rather fatiguing. The land on the
hills was sometimes good, sometimes indifferent, and sometimes
very barren. That of the valleys was for the most part of a good
quality; we bivouaced near a stream running through a valley,
trending, as all the others did, to the southward.</p>
<p>Friday, very early in the morning, we started, and Mokare
having now got on known ground, led the way; after having
travelled at a pretty brisk pace for nearly four hours,
principally over flat land, we came to a river about fifty yards
wide, and apparently deep, flowing to the south; we walked along
the right bank, and in a short time came to the inlet seen from
Mount Lindesay, into which it flowed; unfortunately a bar of sand
runs across its entrance, not having more than eighteen inches or
two feet water, where we passed over; but immediately inside the
bar there are from three to seven feet, the greatest depth being
on the right bank, which increases as the river decreases in
width; it is navigable for boats to a considerable distance; the
water is slightly brackish&mdash;not more so than the Swan, at
Perth. I consider this to be the termination of the mountain
stream where we found the land so good, and where we bivouaced
after the second day's march; it was named the Hay, in compliment
to the Under Secretary of State. Having walked along the shore
about a mile and a half, we arrived at another river flowing also
into the inlet W.S.W.; there is also a bar across its mouth,
inside of which the water is five feet deep and upwards of ten
yards wide. I consider this the termination of the stream we met
on the afternoon of the second day's march, where the land began
to improve; it was named the Heeman, in compliment to the late
commandant of this settlement. I may in this place mention, that
my method of ascertaining the depth of the various rivers was
very simple; I either waded or jumped into all of them. The inlet
into which these rivers flow may be called circular, six or seven
miles in diameter. The water to the N.E. is very shallow, but
deep along its southern boundary; we sand is not above six or
eight inches deep; beneath it is fine red, and then blue clay,
increasing in purity as it increased in depth. Having walked some
distance in the shallow water, the following bearings were
taken.</p>
<p>Mount Lindesay N.W. by N.; high conical hill seen from the
mount, bearing S. by W., the base apparently washed by the water
distant fifteen miles bore west. This hill, in compliment to the
gallant admiral of that name, was called Mount Hallowell. High
land to the seaward (between which and Mount Hallowell I think
the communication with the sea exists) bore W. by S. ¾ S. From
Mount Lindesay to Mount Hallowell there is a continuous chain of
hills, one of which in the centre, and higher up than the others,
(being also a conspicuous point,) was named Mount Shadforth, in
compliment to the Lieutenant-Colonel of the 57th Regiment. I have
already mentioned that the inlet is nearly circular; perhaps a
better idea of it may be formed by supposing an arc 40° cut from
the western part of the circle, through which opening Mount
Hallowell may be seen in the distance washed by this inlet, and I
have no doubt also by the sea, whose mighty voice was most
plainly heard by all of us. It is my opinion, that the inlet
expands again and receives other rivers, I was on my way to
decide the matter, but reflecting that the utmost limit of my
time was expired, that our provisions were expended, and that I
had no instruments to make any useful observations, I was
obliged, though reluctantly, to give up the attempt. The rise and
fall of the tide is considerable; during our stay here it receded
upwards of 6 inches. We resumed our journey about 2 p.m.,
proceeding east through a country slightly undulating for two or
three miles, when we reached a plain of great extent, bounded on
the N. and S. by well wooded hills, occasionally watered by small
streams, and intersected by narrow slips of finely timbered
forest land. In the evening we bivouaced near a swampy flat. The
land we passed over to-day was for the most part composed of
charcoal, and other vegetable matter, varying in depth from four
to twelve inches, under which was sand about six inches deep, and
then a fine blue clay, and this is the general character of all
the flat land we passed over to the eastward of Mount Lindesay.
Saturday, at day-light, we left our bivouac, and proceeded on our
way home. About 7 o'clock, arriving at an inlet of some extent,
we bent our course a little to the south, came to the sea beach
and walked across the sand, which was several feet above the
level of the sea and inlet. Here the following bearings werq
taken: West Cape Howe S.S.W. and island south; Eclipse Island
S.E. by S.; another island S. by E.; centre and direction of the
inlet N.E. by N. ½ N.</p>
<p>We now crossed over the range of sand hills (some parts of
which showed the same stalactitic appearances as the hills about
Swan River). The lagoon was perceived to be of crescentic form,
communicating by a very tortuous channel with another lagoon,
well known to the sportsmen of this settlement. In conclusion, I
do not hesitate in saying, without fear of future contradiction,
that the area passed over contained as much, perhaps more, land
fit for all rural purposes than any portion of equal extent (at
least as far as I know) in New South Wales. It may likewise be
observed, that the range of mountains (granite) is not so
continuous as was supposed, but that there is a plain of
considerable extent between the western and Porringor-up and
Morrel-up ranges, affording easy access between this settlement
and Swan Port, for at least one hundred miles. That, crediting
the report of the natives, which, from the correctness respecting
the nature of the land to the westward, and from their general
intelligence, I think may be done, there is excellent land to the
N.E. It is also probable that a good sea-port may exist to the
westward, and it is certain that the country thence, as far east
as Cape Howe, is open and level, affording easy communication
from port to port, and that the land is far from being bad. I may
likewise state, that in travelling onwards it was made a rule for
each individual to carry a day's water, lest we might not meet
with any when we halted for the night: there never was occasion,
however, to make use of it from necessity 5 indeed those who
wished enjoyed the luxury of a cold bath at least once a day
(once excepted) during our excursion. This may show sufficiently
that the country is copiously supplied with water, neither is
there any deficiency of several kinds of useful timber. In the
barren land the banksia and stunted swamp oak, and grass tree,
held undisputed sway. In the moist land, along the banks of
streams and rivers, the tea tree flourished; in forest land the
blue gum, the apple, the turpentine, and the box (I use the
colonial names) alternately predominate, obtaining in valleys,
and particularly in glens, enormous girth and altitude. The green
wattle was occasionally observed; it flourished luxuriantly on
the hills in the neighbourhood of Mount Lindesay. I have not
entered into any detail regarding the mineralogical or botanical
features of the country, as, even were I capable of doing so, the
knowledge gained during such a rapid journey must be very
imperfect; moreover, a person travelling with his blanket,
provisions, and water, on his bade, can only be expected to show
the way, where others may follow their different favourite
pursuits with comparative ease and safety to themselves and
advantage to the scientific world.</p>

RICHARD DALE'S</strong><br>
<br>
<i>First Excursion to trace the Helena River, in October</i>,
1829.</p>
<p><i>Oct.</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left Perth at 8 o'clock, a.m.
and forded the Swan at the islands at a quarter past 9 o'clock,
proceeding E. by S. till 10, when we altered our course to the
E.N.E. and N.E., and at 11 o'clock again changed it to E. by S.
and crossed a large reedy swamp running E.S.E. with a small
stream to the eastward, the soil on its banks being a loam much
mixed with sand, but thickly covered with grass trees; at
half-past 10 o'clock met with another stream running at N.W., and
at 2 arrived at a broad brook running to the W.N.W.; we proceeded
about a quarter of a mile along its banks, which had a most
verdant appearance, resembling the richest parts of the Swan, and
when we left it, took its course from the S.E.; at twenty minutes
to 3 o'clock ascended the mountains, first passing over a hill
about a hundred yards high, at the top of which, and up to within
a few yards of the summit of another conical one, we found a rich
soil and very good grass, which continued along the mountains for
about a mile and a half to the end of this day's journey. The
country we passed over, after passing the Swan River, till we
came within a short distance of the mountains, was generally
sandy, and thickly wooded with large trees. Bivouaced by the side
of a small stream, at twenty minutes to 4 o'clock, running
W.&mdash;Fifteen miles extent of the first day's journey.</p>
<p><i>Oct.</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Recommenced our journey at 7
o'clock, a.m., and in half an hour came to a valley with a broad
brook running through it to the W.N.W.; the soil on its banks
being very rich and fertile, proceeded about two miles up it,
when we crossed it over a fallen tree, and took a S.E. direction
over a high hill on account of the banks becoming steep; at a
quarter past 9 o'clock met two of the natives, with whom we were
on friendly terms, near a small creek, running into the main
stream from the W.S.W.; we shortly after crossed the brook, and
lost sight of it for about three hours, our general course during
that time being E.S.E. The soil for the first eight miles of this
journey appeared good, particularly whenever the country opened
and showed small valleys. The latter part of it, when we left the
brook and proceeded along the summit of the hills, was generally
rocky, and the surface covered with load-stones&mdash;Thirteen
miles extent of the second day's journey.</p>
<p><i>Oct.</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded at a quarter to 7
o'clock, a.m., and continued following the brook up in an E.S.E.
direction, when we left it running S.E. and ascended a high hill,
from which we had a view of the country for nine miles up the
stream, and could perceive no change in it to induce us to
continue our journey. Returned on our way home at half-past 11
o'clock over a hilly country, the surface of which was sandy and
very thickly wooded with large trees; bivouaced at a quarter to 4
o'clock in a small Valley, with a broad stream running through it
to the N.W., and a good soil on the banks of it.&mdash;Seventeen
miles extent of the third day's journey.</p>
<p><i>Oct.</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at 7 o'clock, a.m.
steering W.N.W., and in two hours and a half reached the top of
the mountains, being about two and a half miles to the southward
of me part we ascended on our first day's journey; in descending
them we found in some places good soil, but on leaving them to
the time of our arriving at the islands on the Swan River (a
distance of about eleven miles) the country was generally swampy
and sandy.&mdash;Seventeen miles extent of the fourth day's
journey.</p>

to trace the Helena<br>
River, in December</i>, 1829.</p>
<p><span class="a">At</span> a quarter before 8 o'clock, a.m.
left Perth, and forded the Swan River at the islands; at 9
proceeded in an E. direction over a sandy and thickly wooded
country, and in five miles crossed a swamp lying E. and W., and
soon afterwards a rather extensive one to the S.E., which we
again crossed to the S.W.; two miles and a half further passed a
small one lying S.E. and N.W.; we continued our walk about the
same distance of two miles and a half when we came to the dry bed
of a stream, and continued along its banks till we reached the
mountains, where we bivouaced at 4 p.m. in a small valley with
pretty good soil, and grass in it, but having a rocky surface.
The country we walked over to-day was, till within four miles of
the mountains, sandy, where we met with a light sandy
loam.&mdash;First day's journey thirteen miles.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 8<i>th</i>,&mdash;At 6¼ a.m. proceeded in an E.
direction, and commenced the ascent of the mountain up a narrow
valley, in which we found a red soil, which continued to our
arriving at the top, when the country became sandy and
exceedingly rocky; soon afterwards ascended a steep hill into a
deep valley, with a small brook running through it from E. by E.
to N. by. W., and in about five miles from our bivouac came to a
high hill, from the summit of which we had an extensive view of
the plain in the direction of Perth, and of the valley of the
Helena River, the course of which was generally N.W.; one mile
and a half further crossed the dry bed of a stream, its direction
being N. and S., the soil here being pretty good, and the
apparent course of the Helena from E.N.E.; one mile and
three-quarters further passed a stream running N. and S., and
directly afterwards crossed the Helena; it had little current,
and its course was E. by S.; continued our march up the banks E.
by S., and after passing a stream falling into it from the N.,
bivouaced in a small valley. Our walk to-day was over a hilly and
rocky country, generally sandy, but occasionally meeting with
good soil.&mdash;Fifteen miles extent of second day's
journey.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 6½ a.m. resumed our journey
and ascended a high hill, from whence we had a view of the valley
for seven miles to the S.E., terminated by a steep hill; we now
lost sight of the Helena, and after having walked about four
miles we crossed the dry bed of a small brook, lying N.N.E. and
S., when we altered our course to E., and commenced gradually
ascending a hill, on the side of which, for the distance of
nearly one mile and a quarter, we found a good soil, and grass
mixed with wild vetch in great luxuriance. On the hill becoming
more steep we again came to a sandy soil, and from the summit
obtained a view of the hill we saw on my last expedition up the
river, bearing S. by E., and distant about nine miles, it being
conspicuous from its peak, and rising apparently 14 or 1500 feet
above the level of the river. Having changed our course to S. by
E. we proceeded in the direction of it, as it seemed to promise,
from its height, an extensive view of the country round it. After
a walk of about nine miles, during which we frequently met with a
good soil; we twice crossed what we supposed to be the Helena,
but which here was only a chain of pools unconnected by any
stream, the bed lying S. and S.E. through a valley of three
quarters of a mile in length and half a mile in breadth, and
having also passed several dry beds of streams, we ascended a
hill shaped like the one for which we had been steering, and had
a view to the E. for ten miles, bound, by high hills; bivouaced
at a quarter past 4, p.m., near a small stream running E.S.E. Our
walk to-day was frequently over a grassy country, with good soil;
and although generally hilly and rocky, produced trees of great
height and large dimensions.&mdash;Third day's journey sixteen
miles.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 6¼ a.m. ascended a steep
hill and came to a generally level and sandy country, appearing
to decline to the S.E.; after proceeding about eleven miles came
to a dry swamp, which we followed for a mile in an easterly
direction, and changed our course to S.E. for half a mile further
to endeavour to find water, but without our being able to procure
any, when we again steered E. for the distance of four miles, to
the top of a hill; from its summit the country appeared pretty
level to the S.E., and a valley in wat direction lying not far
off, we directed our course to it to obtain water, which we found
there in a swamp, being the first we met with after leaving a
pool a mile from last night's bivouac; here we halted for the
night. The most perceptible change to-day was from a hilly to a
more level country, our course frequently lying over small
plains, the soil on which was commonly of a sandy
nature&mdash;Seventeen miles extent of fourth day's journey.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 11<i>th</i>.At half-past 6 left our bivouac and
steered south a short distance, as we supposed we were in the
vicinity of a lake, on account of hearing a noise resembling
swans 3 after proceeding about a quarter of a mile in the
direction, without arriving at the end of the swamp, we returned
homewards, our course for two miles being W.N.W.; from this point
we obtained a view of the high hill before mentioned, bearing W.
by S., towards which we accordingly steered, in the interim
crossing two swamps, the first one being dry, and the direction
of it S. by E. and N.; and that of the second, which had the bed
of a stream and several pools of water in it, lying W.S.W. and
E.S.E. a short distance from the latter one; the country, which
had generally been pretty flat, changed and became more hilly,
and the walking more difficult. In about twelve miles from our
bivouac we arrived at the bed of a stream without any apparent
current, its direction lying about S.S.E.; shortly after we
commenced the ascent of the hill for which we had been steering;
we found it very steep, and rising apparently to the height of
1,400 feet from its base. On arriving at its summit we had a most
extensive view of the country in every direction, especially to
the eastward, where a range of mountains could be distinctly
traced, the most distant of which appeared to be about
twenty-five miles, and was barely discernible; we could also see
the smoke of numerous fires made by the natives, generally
extending close to their base. Towards the N.W. we thought we
could discover the plain, but as evening was closing we were not
able to distinguish it clearly; hatted at a quarter to 8 near a
stream running from E. by S., our course from the hill being
W.N.W. The early part of our walk to day was mostly over a level
country, but it afterwards became hilly and the soil generally
sandy.&mdash;Eighteen miles and a quarter extent of fifth day's
journey.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded at 6, a.m. W.N.W. and
crossed a great number of small streams and swamps, generally
running, with the exception of one, to the S.S.E., in the
direction of the Helena River. The soil on the banks was good,
although the breadth of it was inconsiderable; the hills were
usually sandy and rocky, but the country was always well watered
and thickly wooded.&mdash;Eighteen miles extent of the sixth
day's journey.</p>
<p><i>Dec.</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 6, a.m. commenced the
descent of the mountains, which were extremely rocky, down a
valley, from which we steered N.W. across an open and level
country, and for the first nine miles over a loamy country, when
it changed to a sandy surface, and continued so till our arrival
at the islands on the Swan River. After proceeding a mile from
the last night's bivouac we entered a country generally low and
level, which, from its appearance, seemed subject to being
flooded; it extended for nine miles to within four miles of the
Swan River.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>OBSERVATIONS ON THE COAST,
COUNTRY,</strong> <i>&amp;c. from Cockburn Sound to Geographe
Bay, between the 17th and 30th of November, 1829, by Mr. Collie
and Lieut. Preston, R.N.</i></p>
<p><i>November</i> 17<i>th</i>&mdash;We left the ship with two
whale boats at thirty-five minutes past 5, a.m., and at
fifty-nine minutes past 6, after passing through the southern
entrance, between Garden Island and Cape Peron, brought the
northern tangent of this Cape to bear due E. At five minutes past
7 we were dose to what we have marked point A * in the
accompanying eye sketch of the coast, from this the following
rough bearings were taken:&mdash;Rock off Cape Peron N. 9° W.
southern extreme of land in view; Point B, which appeared a bluff
head of little elevation, S. 5° W.; south-westernmost rock (No.5)
S. 65° W.; southern extreme of island (X.) off Point A, S. 85°
W.; northern extreme of same island N. 50° W.; eastern tangent of
island (Z) N. 20° W. A sandy and flat point runs for a
considerable distance from the eastern part of the island X
towards point A, leaving only depth of water sufficient for our
boats to pass at low water between them. The distance from point
A to this sandy flat point of the island is nearly half a mile;
on proceeding, and having brought a rather high double-topped
sandy hummock on with a patch of the highest trees inland, and
bearing S. 73° E. from No. 4 Rock outside of us, there were no
soundings with a line of seven fathoms; when abreast of No. 5
Rock, there was only one fathom water. These rocks are all coral,
with their faces generally undermined, rising from ten to fifteen
feet above the water. A reef of coral, bare at low water, extends
between them; and to the southward, for several miles, the water
continued shallow, even for boats, from abreast No. 5 Rock to
point B.; from this point, the southern extreme of coast in view,
the head at the entrance of the Murray River bore S. 9° W., No. 5
Rock N. 28° W., western tangent of island (X) N. 5° W.; Point (A)
N. 4° E. The shallow water continued for a considerable way past
the Point, but beyond it there is water for large ships; and the
extensive reef, where we saw the breakers, must shelter this port
from the N.W. if not from the W. At half-past ten we were abreast
of Murray River, but stood on to endeavour to ascertain the
appearance of the coast between it and Cape Bouvard; and also to
see if we could safely attempt rounding the Cape, before the
breeze, which had been rapidly increasing and blowing on shore,
should acquire such force as to endanger the boats. Observing no
shelter on this side the Cape, and satisfied, from the appearance
of the weather, that provided we could round it, we should not
only be obliged to beach the boats through a considerable surf,
and to remain for one or more days before the weather would
settle to permit us to proceed, we bore up for Murray River, and
giving, which is necessary, the rocks off the head with Two bare
Patches to the S.W. of the entrance a good berth, we stood across
the bar, through small breakers in the deepest part, close to the
starboard shore. The bar is like the beach, on both sides formed
of sand, and most probably changeable. Afterwards, on the 20th,
in going out, I found not less than three feet water, when the
tide appeared to be very low; but on the 30th, the fourth day
after new moon, I found not more than 1¾ feet water at ten
minutes past 5, a.m. the water being several inches lower than on
the 20th. From two meridian altitudes we obtained 32° 33' 15" as
the latitude of the entrance. The distance from it to the place
where the estuary expands into an irregular square sheet of
water, from five to seven miles each way, is about three miles,
with a good channel, having on each side of it a low level plain,
composed of a surface layer of three or four inches of blackish
clay, resting on shells and other marine calcareous deposits.
Casuarina trees are growing in some places, and a succulent
plant, having some distant resemblance to samphire, occupies the
most marshes; whilst on higher and sandy ground, the eycalipti
are produced, along with a tolerably good herbaceous vegetation.
In the expanded sheet of water there are many extensive flats,
partly dry at low water, and not navigable for common boats even
at high; they lie a long way from the south side, so far indeed
as to preclude our examining the beach in that direction so
closely as we wished, and on that account were obliged to leave
it uncertain whether any river entered between the Murray at the
N.E. angle, and another river I found at the S.W., although I saw
no indication of any opening along the line of trees skirting
that part. Several good channels traverse this part of the
estuary, and one runs along the western bank to the South River.
We passed the night on the western bank, amid trees and shrubs,
and a thin production of grass, and other herbs, upon a sandy
soil, mixed with a tolerable proportion of black mould. The wind
blew strong in squalls, accompanied with rain.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The references are to a Map in the hands of
the Government, but it was not considered necessary to enhance

<p><i>November</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Embarked at forty minutes
past 6, and proceeded to the Southern River, which we had only
conjectured the preceding night to exist. An arm, from one mile
and a half wide to two miles and a half, extends from the S.W.
angle of the large sheet of water, nearly and with little turning
in a S. by E. direction, for about eight miles and a half. It is
of a good depth for boats except about seven miles up, where
there is a small sandy island near its middle, producing shrubs
and small trees of the casuarina and melaleuca, and from which
flats, that our boats touched on, extend from both sides to the
banks opposite. The rising ground on the bank is formed of sand
and calcareous petrefactions of trees; the lower chiefly of
siliceous sand, which, however, forms a smaller than usual
proportion. The surface in these last places is inclined to
swampy, and every where except on two elevated points. On the
right bank, covered with wood, natives were seen in great
numbers, and from twenty to thirty came down to the boats, and
seemed very anxious that we should not go away from them. At the
southern end of this arm, it became so very shallow that it was
with great labour that the men got the boats over into a deep
narrow channel that formed many abrupt turnings. As we ascended,
first taking a direction so for one-eighth of a mile, then S.W.
one-fifth of a mile, and after that about one-twelfth of a mile
more, formed a short reach W.N.W.; we continued to ascend S.S.W.,
S.E., S. by E., S.E., E.N.E., E., S.S.E., and E.N.E., where we
stopped for the night at half past 4, p.m. two miles and a half
from the last flats, the men having been pulling almost the whole
time, from our departure in the morning, against a good deal of
sea and a strong wind from the S.S.W. We had scarcely entered the
narrow part of the river when the water became fresh. After
disembarking for the night, we traced the river first N.E. about
three hundred yards, then forming a sudden turning to the W.S.W.,
S., S.E. by S. and E., which it continued about three-eighths of
a mile, two creeks leading to swamps are formed by it in the last
mile. Its banks, although high, are sandy, often void of wood,
nor covered with rich verdure;&mdash;some lower levels looked
well; and a considerable fertile plain lay beyond our stopping
place. The wind blew fresh and squally from the S.W.; we filled
our water casks, and on the 19th, at five minutes past 7,
commenced descending the river; we passed the upper and lower
flats better than yesterday, and had a long and amicable
interview with several natives, who waded out on the flats to
admire us, the novelty of the boats, and every thing we had. We
spent a good part of the day in ineffectually attempting to
approach the south side of this large sheet of water; and as the
weather appeared to be settling, we bivouaced at the entrance, to
be ready to proceed along the coast next morning. Several of the
men were affected with pain of the eyes from the reflection along
the shallows, and one suffered from diarrhoea. At five minutes
past 7, a.m. of the 20th we passed the bar without seeing
breakers, where the deepest water was about three feet; the wind
was E.S.E. and moderate. After rounding the reef off Two-bare
Patches Head, we stood along a sandy and nearly straight coast,
S.W. for four miles and a half, and then, still keeping the
direction of the beach S.W. by S. ½ S., for two miles farther,
having seven fathoms water, one-third of a mile from the shore.
There was little surf on the beach with the land, but more with
the sea breeze, that came in at 10, and blew fresh the sand S.W.
Beyond the beach, mounds, barren of trees, but covered with
verdure, concealed the plain behind them, and it was only through
breaks that we could occasionally see the trees inland. The
meridian altitudes gave the latitude of Cape Bouvard 32° 38'
considerably to the south of what is laid down in the chart. The
only marked distinction between the cape and the other parts of
the coast, is its projecting the farthest into the sea, for the
mounds which form it are not very perceptibly higher than on
either side, nor does it form a pointed but rounded headland. At
3. p.m. the boats making but little way against a heavy sea and
strong breeze, we ran them through the surf on the beach, in
doing which one of the grapnels that was let go to haul out by on
launching parted, and could not be recovered on account of the
violence of the surf. No fresh water was to be procured at a
considerable depth in the valleys some way from the beach, but we
soon discovered, from one of the highest sand mounds, an
extensive lake about one mile and a half wide, lying parallel to
the beach, and about a mile from it. These sand mounds rise very
irregularly and abruptly, having considerable herbaceous verdure
in their hollows, and being covered higher up with the usual
shrubs. A small plain, bearing grass trees, eycalipti, and tea
trees, intervenes between them and the lake, but it was in a
great measure submerged.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 21<i>st</i>&mdash;The wind continuing to blow
fresh along the shore from the south prevented our going to sea;
we therefore sent a party to the lake to procure water, which,
although we found it brackish, we were obliged to use; others
went to bake cakes from the flour we had taken with us instead of
bread, and some were still labouring under defective vision. We
went to the northern end of the lake to determine its boundary,
and found it shut in by swamp and ultimately dry land. Its extent
to the southward was concealed at about eight miles distance by
the sand mounds, round which it seemed to incline a little
westerly towards the sea beach. Mount William bore from us S. 56°
E.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 22<i>d</i>.&mdash;Immediately the land breeze
came in force to be of service, we launched our boats, without
waiting for break of day; it was forty minutes past 4; and with a
scanty land wind but smooth water we pulled along shore till
noon, when the sea breeze having again set in strong, we beached
the boats on a continuation of the same beach, about
three-quarters of a mile to the south of two remarkable
bald-looking sand mounds, and opposite to hammocks which stand
insulated on both sides by a lower and uniform shore. From the
heights above this landing place Mount Williams bore N. 79° E.,
and the head beyond Port Leschenault S. 16° W. There are three
gradually sloping heights of unequal size, and at irregular
distances, within the head; within the sand hills, which were
here more fertile than we had observed before, we observed what
we thought a continuation of the lake seen at our former landing
place. It approached to about three-quarters of a mile of the
sea-beach, and was found to be as salt as sea-water. The heights
which we had time to ascend afforded us no view either of a
southern or northern termination; but we could not see above a
few miles. No fresh water was found in digging.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Embarked at forty minutes
past 4, having previously breakfasted, as soon as the surf and
daylight would permit us. We kept close in shore, expecting to
see some entrance to the lagoon we had left, but could discover
no traces of one. Arrived at Port Leschenault at half-past 8.
After giving the boat's crews some refreshment, we proceeded in
one boat to examine the port, and left the other with Mr. Cudlip,
to pitch me tents, dig for water, prepare dinner, &amp;c. About
two miles and a half up we discovered a river flowing over a
shallow to the estuary, and immediately made for it. Every one
was obliged to get out and track the boat over a short distance,
when the water became deep and very little salt. Good land
appeared on both banks; and we were soon among the natives, who
testified the greatest and most friendly eagerness to be allowed
to approach us. There are two mouths to the river, with a low
sandy island between them and the one we entered; the westernmost
was afterwards found the least shallow. A second island is formed
in the river, not a mile up, and the water rather shallow,
affording a good crossing place for the natives. About half a
mile above this, the water being perfectly fresh, we filled our
barricoes, and soon had our native friends around us. On
returning, between thirty and forty had assembled on the banks,
and ran to the shallows at the mouth, where they closely
surrounded us, carrying green boughs, and without any weapons of
offence or defence. The soil which we saw, and productions on
both sides of the river as far as we saw&mdash;and there was a
long and wide reach beyond where we stopped&mdash;seemed good and
luxuriant, except on one or two heights, where the sand
predominated so much as only to support a few shrubs, banksias,
and a few eycalipti. The head, which runs out to the westward of
the entrance, is bare of trees but covered with shrubs and a
little grass, and composed of sand mounds, except on one aide,
where, on a level with the sea, a black and hard rock is washed
by the sea. This rock appeared to be continued more or less
exposed for a considerable distance towards Geographe Bay. At
night, one of our men who had lately joined the ship, and who had
been noticed to have been inebriated, and reproved for being so,
in the evening was missing, nor did a diligent search discover
where he had gone, neither did he appear on the morning of the
24th, when we were to set out for Port Vasse. Every one was
satisfied, from the character of the man, that he had voluntarily
gone away with the intention of deserting, yet blame might have
been attached, however undeservedly, had we not made every search
that daylight could afford. It was therefore determined to
remain, although a fair wind and fine day was a material loss, as
we had to go upon a wholly unknown coast. Mr. Collie and Mr.
Preston went up the river to get an additional supply of water,
and to examine still farther beyond the river, to ascertain
whether there existed others on that side, and how far the
lagoon, if it might be so called, extended. Lieutenant Preston
remained to make every search near the tents; as the boats
returned down the river the man was found on the banks, and taken
on board. He said he had intended to go back to the ship, but
meeting suddenly a native woman, who had no more covering than
the men, she set up a shriek and two men came out; he ran off and
swam a river, and they threw their spears at him without
striking. Before the boat returned it was too late to depart that
day. The natives had not observed the boat till she had descended
the river, but soon after this they came running with all speed;
in order to go out on the shallows she was obliged to go near.
Nor were they satisfied with this partial view of our party, but
almost immediately after the boat had returned seventeen of them
had made a circuity and came down to the tents, still carrying
their green boughs. After a very amicable interview, during which
we did not admit them close to the tents, they returned seemingly
very much gratified with what they had seen, and with a few
trifles which they had gotten. In the afternoon we took our boats
to examine the western shore of the harbour, between the entrance
and the river already discovered, as the mouth of another river
was supposed to have been seen yesterday in passing; nor had we
been mistaken, for we found a channel of not less than six feet
deep, leading to a river of as great a depth, about a mile nearer
the entrance than the former one. In ascending, the direction is
very serpentine; the breadth at its mouth from ninety yards to
one hundred feet at our farthest ascent, about one mile and a
half from its mouth. The banks are from three to six feet deep.
The surface was thickly covered with grass and other herbs, with
stringy bark, and other trees, liguminous shrubs, ferns, and sow
thistles, and exposed a soil of blackish brown earth, being a
good mixture of loam and mould, about two feet deep. We walked
thirty or forty yards from the bank, and as far as we could see
the same soil and productions continued. A short way farther up,
however, on a subsequent day, we found the channel much
obstructed with trees, and near its banks low knolls and
intervening vales, almost wholly sand, yet supporting a little
herbaceous, but mostly shrubby vegetation, and the tallest and
finest eycalipti (red and blue gum) trees, and banksia, we have
any where discovered. Mr. Cudlip had examined the entrance the
previous night near high water, and discovered six feet over the
bar. We examined it again, and found eight in one place. The
deepest water is close to the starboard shore coming in. Some of
the men discovered, a short way round the head, dose to the
beach, fresh water flowing from the sand hills.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left Port Leschenault at
forty-five minutes past 4 a.m., and having rounded the breakers
which extend off the head, about half a mile N.E. by N., and
stood along a sandy beach with frequent rocks at the water's
edge, we entered Port Vasse at fifty minutes past 9, through a
narrow entrance, with only one foot and three quarters of water
at low water, but tide flowing, and so indistinct, that had it
not been for the pelicans and gulls which were sitting on the
beach close by it, we should have had difficulty in perceiving it
at a few yards' distance. Both here, at Port Leschenault, and the
Estuary of the Murray River, we always found these birds
assembled at the entrance, whether of the harbour itself or of
the rivers into it, and they were of considerable utility in
directing us. A short way inside the beach we found the channel
again very shallow; also narrow, and the main branch taking a
northerly direction, parrellel to the beach, and only separated
from it by a few sandy knolls; another branch continued past the
opening for one or two hundred yards to the southward, and
terminated without any communication. The land adjoining, and to
the distance of some hundred yards, is an uneven plain, composed
of raised and low places, the former being a tolerable mixture of
sand and mould, producing some herbs, shrubs, chiefly liguminous,
and trees, for the most part septospermi; the latter is covered
with rushes, and swampy. A few hundred yards farther on, along
the beach, to the south, there is another similar opening, which,
after a narrow channel of good depth, that is bounded on the left
by a cliff of calcareous sandstone, and split by an island,
becomes so shallow, that our boat could with difficulty be
dragged over; it then expands into a considerable sheet of water,
the circuit of which we did not complete; but it appeared to be
generally very shallow, and on its banks, salt marshes, or a low
black clayey, and, at present, dry soil, extended some distance,
especially between it and the beach. Inland of this recent
formation, a similar, but little more elevated surface, still
showing that it had been lately flooded, producing grass and
other herbs, without any trees or shrubs, for many acres. Port
Leschenault having offered the best prospects of land in its
vicinity, and the greatest extent of harbour, which we had every
reason to suppose extended many miles in the form of a lagoon, ta
the northward, behind the sand hills; and Geographe Bay having
been formerly surveyed, we had every inducement to return as soon
as possible to Port Leschenault; we therefore left Port Vasse at
1 p.m. expecting to have a favourable sea breeze to carry us back
before dark; in this we were disappointed, and had to pull the
whole way. We got into Port Leschenault at forty minutes past 8
p.m., having passed between the point and the outermost breakers
seen in the morning, but which were much less in the evening. We
had seen smoke in many places a short way beyond, and even close
to the beach, between Port Vasse and Port Leschenault, as well as
beyond the former in Geographe Bay; and we saw and heard the
natives shouting on the beach.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 26<i>th</i>&mdash;We set out with both boats
at half past 7 a.m.; ascended the nearest and last discovered
river still farther, as has been already mentioned. The morning
threatening rain, we put up a tent, and whilst we walked inland,
the men were occupied washing. In the afternoon we proceeded up
the harbour and examined the second entrance of the second river,
and the eastern shore beyond it, where we found our former
friends, the natives, still apparently more eager, if possible,
of getting to us; we first, however, landed on the opposite
shore, and left Mr. Cudlip, with one of the boats, to prepare
supper; we returned in the other, and approached the shore as
near as the shallows would permit&mdash;within 200 yards: we had
a long and friendly communication with the natives, about
thirty-five of whom, men and boys, came out to us. We had killed
and caught several young swans, land they seemed highly delighted
to get one; they appeared unwilling to part with their spears and
knives, and to use considerable duplicity in bartering. Examined
the northern part of the harbour, and found what we imagined to
extend for many miles, to be shut in at a short distance by low
land, at first swampy, and then covered with trees, which were
continued as far as the eye could see from the highest sand
hills. Soon after the boats landed for us to ascend the sand
mounds, seventeen of the natives, whom we had seen yesterday,
after rounding the southern boundary of the harbour, surprised us
by their sudden approach; they remained, testifying satisfaction
at the men, till we put off again; the general appearance of all
whom we saw, is the same as that of those in the vicinity of
Perth, but use different words significant of approbation; the
language is perhaps considerably different; all their intentions
seemed friendly, and their character unsuspecting and fearless.
Having ascertained that no other rivers entered the harbour,
which, from its northern termination to the river of
twenty-third, is bounded on the east, that is, towards the plain,
by moderately elevated ground covered with trees; we returned, to
remain at the entrance for the night.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left Port Leschenault at
five minutes past 5, with a moderate breeze at S. by W. which
soon freshened so as to make us reef our sails, and changed to
S.S.W., and soon after to S.W. The harbour of Port Leschenault,
not communicating with the salt water lake (most likely lagoon)
seen on the 22d, made us think we must have passed, unobserved,
its communication with the sea; and we had determined to examine
still more narrowly, that part of the coast where we expected the
communication to exist; but the force and direction of the wind,
now rendered any further delay in getting to Murray River
dangerous. We therefore steered for Cape Bouvard, and thence for
the river, where we arrived after a boisterous passage, during
which it required the utmost attention to prevent the sea, which
ran very high, coming into the boats; the wind had freshened
considerably, but Two-Bare-Patches Head, and the reef off it,
sheltered the entrance, and we got in at five minutes past 3 p.m.
without passing through any breakers.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded in one boat up
the estuary, to examine five different but adjoining mouths of
the Murray, where it flows at the S.E. part into the large sheet
of water before mentioned, over a sandy beach and bar, with only
sufficient depth of winter for our boat The channel, about a mile
up, is capacious, and the water fresh; and the land on its banks,
to the distance of several yards, is partly sand, with a small
proportion of mould or black argillaceous loam, and bearing the
marks of being occasionally flooded. We again, but equally in
vain as before, attempted to reach the southern side of the large
sheet of water; we could find no channel between the flats in
that direction. We had the distant view of several fires among
the trees, a circumstance which assists in explaining the so
frequent burnt appearance of the trees and shrubs in Western
Australia; we have no doubt that they owed their production to
the natives. On the previous night our fire rapidly caught the
adjoining underwood and low vegetation, and we remarked a
considerable space that had similarly suffered between our
present and former touching here. The rocks off and at
Two-Bare-Patches Head, are calcareous, and extend along the sandy
beach a short way to the S.W. We had great difficulty in
ascertaining the periods of the tides at the different places;
near the time of new moon we had the lowest water, at about 5
a.m., and the highest at about 9 or 10 at night, whilst there was
an influx in the middle of the day, but scarce any fall till
about 9 or 10 at night. In the estuary of Murray River, and in
the harbour of Port Leschenault, were great numbers of swans and
water birds, and up the river, multitudes of ducks. Fish were
observed in abundance, particularly in Port Vasse.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returned to the ship,
having touched at the reefs and islands in the northern part of
the bay, formed between Cape Bouvard and Point (B),* and gone
outside of the rocks and reefs off Cape Peron, as, with the
smooth water of the 17th, we had only enough of water inside, and
there was now a considerable sea on; we kept nearer Cape Peron
than Garden Island in coming in, and passed between several reefs
which were all washed with the sea that was breaking over them;
our truck gave us generally two and a half, and never less than
two fathoms; this was a little be, fore noon. Many of the men
suffered at different times from slight attacks of Opthalmia,
attended with considerable pain, but none were long incapacitated
for work.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>
<p class="negindent3"><strong>JOURNAL OF AN EXPEDITION</strong>
<i>under the direction of Ensign Dale, to the Eastward of the
Darling Mountains; in August</i>, 1831.</p>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> provided a sufficient supply of
provisions for three weeks, and prepared whatever was necessary
for my expedition, I left Perth in the morning of the 31st of
July, and in the morning reached Messrs. Thompson and Trimmer's,
on the Swan River, a distance of about seven miles. On the
following morning, I proceeded to Mr. Brockman's, four miles
higher up, who proposed accompanying me on my intended
expedition. I was obliged to await there the arrival of the boat
I had despatched from Perth with my provisions, and then
succeeded in swimming our horses over the river, after
experiencing some danger in the attempt, owing to the Swan, from
late heavy rains, having overflowed its banks to a considerable
height.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of August, having arranged our different packages,
and reduced them as much as possible, I proceeded with my party,
consisting of Mr. Brockman, one soldier, and a store-keeper, the
two latter each leading a pack-horse to carry our baggage across
the plain, which extends from the left bank of the Swan to the
base of the Darling range, until we reached, in a course varying
from north to east, the foot of those hills, the ascent of which
we commenced up a narrow defile, through which a stream was
running to the westward. Following this for one mile, we left it
on its leading us too far to the southward, and proceeded due
east till we encamped in the evening on the banks of a mountain
torrent flowing to the norths after an estimated day's journey of
eleven miles.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;After quitting our bivouac, we
ascended, and continued along the summit of a ridge, from which
no higher land was visible for two and a half miles, when we
arrived at its eastern side, from which we had a view of the
country round for eight miles; we soon afterwards passed a broad
stream flowing W.N.W. Continuing our course due E., we obtained a
view of the valley of the Swan, and could discover beneath us
through the trees, that river falling over a bed of rocks. On
descending, I recognised it to be a waterfall which I passed when
accompanying Capt. Irwin in an expedition into the interior, in
April last. Quitting this, and proceeding to the southward of E.,
we in three miles again came to that river, and continued along
the banks till we arrived at the termination of Capt. Irwin's
journey, where we had left a depôt of provisions. We had the
satisfaction of finding them uninjured. As we had had a journey
of twelve miles this morning, I determined to rest here the
remainder of the day to refresh the horses. The greater
proportion of country seen to-day was sandy in the valleys, and
on some of the hills we passed over a rich loamy soil, producing
grass of a tolerable description, and also the wild vetch; the
trees consisting principally of mahogany of a very vigorous
growth, the blue and red gum, and a few banksias.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer this morning at
sun-rise 33°. An hour's walk from the depot brought us to a
second branch of the Swan, which we traced up for two miles, and
crossed it at a spot where it was flowing to the southward. The
country was an open forest scene, the trees consisting almost
entirely of blue gum. This peculiarity I have observed in another
part of the mountains about the same distance in the interior.
Continuing our course due east, we were afterwards obliged to
make a short detour to the southward, and as the country was
swampy, we had some difficulty in again crossing the
last-mentioned stream, the banks of which were composed of a rich
alluvial deposit. Leaving this second branch of the Swan behind
us, at about two miles farther eastward, we halted for a short
time during the middle of the day, on the banks of a small stream
which Mr. Brockman and myself traced to its source, and were led
to think it might have its origin in a lake. On our ascending it
for a mile in a S.E. direction, it appeared to terminate and be
formed by the draining of swampy land; we here observed numerous
traces of emus. On returning to our party, we again proceeded
eastward, and taking a more elevated course, passed over two and
a half miles of a barren description of country, the trees being
of a more stunted growth, and the soil sandy, having its surface
covered with fragments of iron stone. Descending this ridge into
a valley, we had the satisfaction of discovering the first stream
running to the eastward, the timber on its banks consisting of
blue gum, casuarina, and black wattle, and a tree similar in its
growth to the apple, which bore a fruit resembling in form, al.
though exceeding in size, an unripe hawthorn berry; its wood has
a remarkably sweet scent, and the bark a delicate pink colour; a
specimen, which we brought home with us, has been pronounced by
some professed judges to be sandal wood.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Last night's rain having
rendered the country insecure travelling for the horses, we had a
great difficulty in proceeding a mile E. from our bivouac, when
our course was interrupted by the last mentioned stream flowing
northerly; on penetrating a short distance down its course, with
the expectation of crossing it, we were obliged to return to
nearly where we had forded it last night, where, owing to the wet
and hollow nature of the ground, we had to unload the horses
before they could approach the margin: having carried the baggage
across, we attempted to remove it to a hill opposite the ford,
but our progress was again arrested by a broader stream flowing
to the north, the channel of which was too deep to ford.
Recrossing to our horses, we went a quarter of a mile below the
junction of the two streams, and employed the remainder of the
day in swimming our horses across, and getting the baggage over.
To accomplish this, we adopted rather a hazardous plan, for,
having selected a tree that was growing in the middle of the
stream, we attached a long rope to it, by one of its branches,
and Mr. Brockman and myself having previously crossed to the
opposite side, drew the different packages over as they were
secured at the opposite extremity of the rope. The valley through
which this stream flows is of some breadth; the soil being
occasionally of a loamy description, and affording pasture for
sheep.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leaving this latter stream
flowing northerly, we advanced in a due E. course for eight
miles, over a succession of barren, uninteresting ridges,
separated from each other at various distances by small grassy
valleys, and clothed principally with low stunted shrubs, and a
gum tree, the bark of which was white. We then descended into a
rich and picturesque valley, of inconsiderable breadth; the
luxuriant verdure of the grass, and its banks sloping down to a
small rivulet, gave it exactly the appearance of a lawn.
Three-quarters of a mile further brought us to a brook running
easterly; the soil and grass continuing good here; on the bank of
this we bivouaced.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer this morning at
sun-rise, 44°. Shortly after quitting our bivouac, still pursuing
an easterly course, we ascended a hill, and at its base again
fell in with the brook on the banks of which we rested last
night, and which here intersected our course owing to its turning
abruptly to the northward. It being too rapid, and also too deep
to attempt to ford it, we constructed a bridge by cutting several
long poles, and placing them across a tree that was growing in
the stream. Over this we carried the baggage to the opposite
shore: having with some danger crossed our horses, we picquetted
them, and pitched our tent on a small rich alluvial flat that
skirts the margin of the brook. Mr. Brockman and myself proceeded
in the mean time to examine an elevated hill bearing E.S.E. about
a mile distant. On arriving at the summit, we were gratified by
obtaining an extensive prospect over a comparatively level
country to the eastward, through which we observed, at the
apparent distance of two miles, a considerable stream. On the
summit of this hill were two remarkable peaks, the valleys
between them forming at their union an irregular basin; the
highest of these we estimated to be about 1,000. I named this
hill Mount Mackie, in compliment to the Chairman of the Court of
Quarter Session.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer this morning at
sun-rise, 31½°, with every indication of a severe hoar frost. In
order to avoid passing over the hill we ascended yesterday, which
we found too much saturated with rain for the horses to attempt
to travel, we continued our course down the right bank of the
brook, in a north and north easterly direction for two and a half
miles, when we had the gratification of arriving at the
considerable stream we noticed yesterday, running towards the
N.W. It had evidently overflowed its banks, the apparent channel
or bed of the river being about sixty yards: the water was
discoloured and muddy, with a rapid current, and enclosed between
banks moderately clothed with trees and shrubs.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer this morning at
sun-rise, 41°. We advanced this morning two miles up the river,
but with considerable difficulty, owing to the soft and yielding
nature of the soil in the neighbourhood of the river, caused
apparently by excessive rain, and not by inundation. Being
obliged to halt here the remainder of the day to refresh our
horses, in the afternoon Mr. Brockman and myself proceeded two
miles further up the stream, when we arrived at its junction with
a brook from the S.S.W., which latter we traced upwards for half
a mile, and then returned to our halting place.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Finding it impossible to make
any further progress with our horses, which were completely
exhausted from their unusual exertions, and having secured them,
we left our tent pitched, considering them as a sufficient
protection against the natives, none of whom we had as yet met
with, and proceeded with two days' provisions to explore the left
bank of the river towards its source, not deeming it prudent to
be longer from our encampment than that time. Recommencing our
journey, the middle course of which was S.S.E., we in six miles
arrived at a remarkable range of hills, (which I propose naming
the Dyott range, in compliment to General Dyott, the Colonel of
the 63rd regiment,) rising abruptly and almost perpendicularly
from their southern base, and presenting a wall-like barrier to
the river. They had a rich and verdant appearance, and were
clothed in grass to their summit, and moderately wooded with gum
trees. At this spot we heard the natives, whose traces we had
been following this morning, hailing each other at a great
distance: we were fortunate enough this night in finding shelter
from the rain, which was pouring down in torrents, under a
shelving rock; it was of considerable size, having the shape and
appearance of a thatched roof of a cottage. In the neighbourhood
of our bivouac, and for some distance around, were large masses
of granite; in one of these we discovered a cavern, the interior
being arched, and resembling somewhat in appearance an ancient
ruin. On one side was rudely carved what was evidently intended
to represent an image of the sun, it being a circular figure
about eighteen inches in diameter, emitting rays from its left
side, and having without the circle, lines meeting each other
nearly at right angles: close to this representation of the sun,
were the impression of an arm and several hands. This spot
appeared to us to be used by the natives as a place of worship.
Our walk to-day for upwards of eighteen miles up the left bank of
the river, led us over a country well clothed with grass,
apparently of the same description as that on the banks of the
Swan. It had little underwood, and was lightly timbered with a
species of gum tree, leaving a rough stringy bark of a light
brown colour, which appeared to us to be a different kind from
any we had observed on the Swan. The flats bordering the river
being mostly flooded, we were unable to judge of their general
character. The soil in the uplands and hills being chiefly
composed of a light sandy loam, with a stratum of clay about a
foot underneath the surface, rendered the travelling from the
late excessive rains rather fatiguing, as we were obliged to
tread on tufts of grass to avoid sinking in many places into this
wet and hollow ground. On the banks of the river were numerous
holes, the burrows of some animal which we were unable to see. We
also found a litter of native dogs; the mother having left them
at our approach, we succeeded in bringing two of them alive to
Perth.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Having only brought two days'
provisions with us, we regretted now being obliged to retrace our
steps to where we had left our horses, and proceeded N. by W. We
in seven miles arrived at the base of that part of the Dyott
hills which rises so abruptly from the river. In twenty minutes
we reached the summit, after a fatiguing ascent, and were amply
rewarded by it in commanding from it a greater expanse of country
than could be observed from Mount Mackie. To the eastward it
presented a view of lightly timbered forest land, rising in
alternate undulations, and expanding itself from nearly north to
S.S.E., till it finally disappeared in the distance from
twenty-five to thirty miles off, seemingly partaking, as far as
we could discover, of the same character as the adjacent
country.</p>
<p>This being the most conspicuous hill of the range, I propose
to name Mount Bakewell, in compliment to a friend. I had also an
imperfect view of an elevated peaked hill, which I had ascended
while on an expedition into the interior in December last, being
nearly S.W. Quitting these hills, we at the termination of seven
miles reached our old encampment, which we found had not been
visited by the natives during our absence.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. Brockman and myself
proceeded at an early hour again to explore the Dyott hills,
while the men were employed in conveying the horses and baggage
three miles lower down the river, to the spot at which we
discovered it. After walking about seven miles, we arrived at the
northern side of the range, but were much disappointed in not
being able to obtain a view of the plain, as, directly we reached
the summit, it was obscured completely by the dense state of the
atmosphere, and by me heavy rams which then set in. Having
collected a few specimens of rocks, and taken a few bearings of
the country around us, we returned to our bivouac. On rejoining
our men, we found they had encountered so much difficulty in
urging on me horses whilst loaded, owing to the Excessive wetness
of the ground, that they had been obliged to unload them, and
carry the baggage themselves.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer at sun-rise 39°.
at eight o'clock a.m. Commenced our route homeward over the same
country we had passed over a few days previously, but with far
greater celerity; as we accomplished to-day nearly the same
distance that it then took us four days to perform, owing to our
better knowledge of the country, and its being more passable to
the horses, which had now only a light lead to carry. After
proceeding ten miles from the river, we had an interview with
three natives on the banks of a stream which we had passed on the
5th instant, and to which we descended for three-quarters of a
mile down a grassy hill, when we saw numerous traces of emus,
which I think they had been just hunting. We found them very
friendly, probably from the little intercourse they had evidently
had with Europeans. After assisting us to load our horses, they
accompanied us some distance, being at great pains to direct us
on our journey. In the evening we bivouaced near the stream we
had so much difficulty in crossing on the 5th instant, having
effected to-day fifteen miles.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Before commencing our journey
this morning, we were visited by three natives, whom we
recognised as having seen at Perth. This intercourse with the
settlers seemed to have the effect of rendering them more
familiar and even daring in their manners, for, on leaving our
bivouac, and ascending a hill, they attempted to prevent our
pursuing our course, on account, as we conjectured, of their
women being near, but on our making a detour to the left, they
joined us with apparent satisfaction. We this day accomplished
fourteen miles in a westerly direction.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer at sun-rise 46°.
We left our bivouac at an early hour this morning, wishing if
possible to reach the western base of Darling's Range before
evening. We traversed a thickly wooded forest country, with a
sandy surface, to the foot of that range, and were enabled before
night-fall to reach the termination of our journey at Mr.
Brockman's house, from which place we had been absent exactly a
fortnight; but not before one of our horses became so exhausted,
that he sank to the ground, in which situation we were obliged to
leave him till the following morning.</p>
<p align="center"><small>GENERAL REMARKS</small>.</p>
<p>In the course of this expedition we collected several
specimens of the mineralogy of the country we traversed. Among
these there are some varieties of granite, rock-crystal, and
limestone. Some of them appear to be metalliferous, but as they
have been placed in the hands of a competent gentleman for the
purpose of being analyzed, whose report is shortly expected, it
is unnecessary at present to hazard an opinion as to their
specific qualities. We estimated the distance from Mr. Brockman's
house to the river which washes the base of the Dyott Hills, and
which formed the extreme point or termination of our journey, to
be forty miles in due easterly course, and to which there is no
obstacle of sufficient importance to prevent a good communication
from being opened. The general characteristic of the soil of the
country to the eastward of Mount Mackie, which we considered to
be the eastern extremity of Darling's Range, was a light, sandy
loam, the sub-soil of which was clay, which occasionally appeared
on the surface. In some places there was a rich red loam, and the
banks of the last-mentioned river were principally alluvial.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>JOURNAL OF ANOTHER
EXPEDITION</strong> <i>to the Eastward if the Darling Range,
under the direction of Ensign Dale; commenced on the 25th of
October, and concluded on the 7th of November, 1830.</i></p>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> accompanied the
Lieutenant-Governor on an expedition into the interior as far as
Mount Bakewell, (situated on the eastern side of Darling's Range,
and described in my report of a former excursion) I took a
temporary leave of his Excellency, who was thence bound
homewards, after receiving a supply of provisions for ten days,
to enable us to prosecute our journey further inland, with the
intention of penetrating as far to the eastward as circumstances
would admit of, and from thence, after proceeding to the
southward for one day, to prevent our crossing on our return in
the same tract, and also to intersect any river that might exist
Id that quarter, to return to Darling's Range in a westerly
course.</p>
<p>Passing in the afternoon of the 28th of October with my party,
consisting of six volunteers, with five horses to carry our
baggage, along the northern base of the Dyott Hills for a mile
and a half, where we found an excellent loamy soil, well clothed
with grass, we arrived at the Avon river, which washes their
base; which we crossed, and proceeded in our course S. ½ E. over
an undulating country, which had a most gratifying appearance,
the soil being a rich red loam of good quality, and lightly
timbered with gum, wattle, and a tree pronounced by some
competent judges to resemble sandal wood; and which was
apparently a richer district than that on the western side of the
Avon. This prevailed for nearly three miles back from the banks,
when on ascending a ridge, we arrived at a remarkable change in
the aspect of the country; viz. large open downs or wolds,
commencing about a mile and a half, and extending several miles
to the north and south. They were of a sandy nature, and covered
principally with short brushwood. Travelling over this it again
became wooded, and continued so till we bivouaced on the banks of
a stream running to the N.N.W., having effected eleven miles to
the eastward of Mount Bakewell. The scenery on the eastern side,
on the banks of the Avon, resembles the term so frequently used
of a demesne or park. The country also seemed to exceed it in the
fertility of the soil, which had, for three miles from the river,
a most promising appearance; and although it often afterwards
became sandy, it was frequently diversified by portions of good
soil.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Leaving the stream on which
we bivouaced, we pursued our course for two miles over grassy,
undulating plains, the soil on which was a light sandy loam. On
our right was an apparently fertile valley, beyond which were low
hills, the trees on which were dispersed like a plantation.
Travelling four miles further, over an unusually sandy district,
we penetrated a forest more thickly wooded than ordinary, with a
tree answering in some respects the stringy bark of New South
Wales; when we arrived at a stream flowing northerly. Quitting
this, we immediately afterwards came to open downs extending for
many miles to the N. and S., and of a breadth, where we crossed,
of two miles. Before reaching this, we had a beautiful chase on
an open plain with a kangaroo, which fairly beat one of our
greyhounds. At the termination of three miles from the latter
water-course, we halted for the night, having accomplished
fifteen miles to the eastward. The commencement of our journey
was over grassy, undulating plains, tolerably well adapted for
pasture. The extensive sandy downs were compared by the two
Yorkshire gentlemen (who accompanied us) to the wolds in that
county. The latter part of our walk lay through a thick forest,
of an apparently different species of eycaliptus from any we had
yet observed, the young trees growing perfectly straight, and
would form, if not too heavy, fine spars for ships. The stem of
the tree was fluted, and from its peculiar appearance, some of
our party named it the cable gum. We procured a supply of muddy
water to-night, by digging wells.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;We followed the water course
on which we encamped last night, in an E. ½ S. direction for one
mile, until we arrived at its source, when we again found the
same style of country as yesterday, viz. sandy undulating
commons, stretching for a considerable distance to the north and
south; upon crossing them the country evidently changed, the
surface being occasionally broken, and a greater expanse of
woodland scenery being visible; from the valleys it seemed to dip
or incline to the northward, in which direction, at the distance
of twenty miles, was a range of elevated land, at the base of
which was a broad valley. A little beyond this we followed the
bed of a stream lying S.E. for one mile, and as the herbage was
good, we rested our party here during the middle of the day, to
refresh the horses. On the bank of this stream were two native
huts, of a different, but more substantial construction, than
those on the Swan. At the conclusion of fifteen miles, we entered
a dense forest of gum trees and brushwood, which we penetrated
with difficulty; after walking nearly five miles through it, we
came to a tea tree and samphire swamp, the water of which was
brackish; at the eastern extremity of it, we reached the base of
two remarkable isolated hills, for which we had been steering; we
found each of them to be composed of one mass of granite; they
appeared to be detached from some high land stretching away to
the southward; we gave the northern one the name of Mount
Caroline, and the southern was called Mount Stirling, after my
fellow traveller, Mr. W. Stirling. We encamped to night on a flat
between a salt water marsh and the latter mount, and obtained a
scanty supply of muddy water by digging wells; we estimated this
day's journey at nearly twenty miles.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 31<i>st</i>.-We all started this morning at
sun-rise, to take a bird's-eye view of the country from the rock;
after climbing on our hands and knees, we reached an elevated
part, from which nothing of consequence was seen. After
breakfast, Mr. W. Stirling and myself proceeded to examine a
sheet of water we had observed in the morning; we found it to be
a salt marsh, on which were several ducks. Three miles N.E. of
our bivouac, we ascended Mount Caroline, from which we made the
following observations. In the distance, about thirty miles S.E.
we observed a low range of hills lying nearly N. and S., on the
western side of which was a broad valley, over which a bluish
vapour was hanging. In the same direction as the valley, were
several round hills, one of which had a tabular summit. We traced
the course of the salt water marsh a few miles to the eastward,
when it trended round to the N. and we lost sight of it. On our
return we examined our provisions, and were greatly, disappointed
on doing so, to find that our Mends Messrs. Clarkson, Hardy, and
Camfield had barely a supply left for two days, which entirely
put an end to the hopes we had formed of penetrating a day's
journey further into the interior; and as we estimated our
distance from the sea coast to be 100 miles, we calculated that
we should not be able to return in less than seven days to Perth,
as we wished to take a southerly course for one day, in which
direction his Excellency was desirous that the country should be
explored. Having divided our provisions, we started at noon and
steered a course varying from S. to S.E. for nearly three miles,
over grassy elevations, the soil of which was a light sandy loam;
at the termination of this distance, we found, on the summit of a
hill, a red loamy soil, which seemed to extend to the southward
and eastward; from this, we altered our course W.S.W. in the
direction of a sheet of water we had remarked from Mount
Stirling. Proceeding two miles through a thick wood, we ascended
a rock, in the hope of gaining a sight of it, but not being able
to discern it, we shortly afterwards encamped in a valley, in
which we found an abundant supply of excellent water. We walked
this afternoon six miles, and passed a native wigwam, which was
much larger than those we had seen on the 30th instant.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 1<i>st</i>&mdash;Wishing to examine the valley
for the purpose of ascertaining if any considerable body of water
existed in the neighbourhood, we proceeded S.S.E. up it, when we
ascended a hill, from which a high peaked hill, (of which several
bearings had previously been taken) being observed, bearing S.
34° W., about thirteen miles distant, we altered our course to
it, as we considered it a good point to make on our return, as I
thought it to be a distant hill I had seen from Mount Bakewell.
Three miles from this valley, where there is tolerable soil, we
arrived at extensive downs, of a breadth, at the part we crossed,
of six miles; we here saw numerous herds of kangaroos, one of
which we killed. In the middle of one of these downs, we found
two pools of fresh water, around which were several traces of
natives; we also observed in them some small fish, and a musk
duck, which latter circumstance seemed to indicate the existence
of water all the year round. On leaving these we penetrated the
angle of a deep wood of gum and tea trees, and pursued our course
up a long aclivity. At the distance of fourteen miles from our
bivouac, I came to a superior description of country; it had a
fertile appearance, the soil being a red loam, well clothed with
grass, the trees consisting of the gum, wattle and sandal wood.
Crossing a mile of this description of country, we ascended the
peaked hill towards which our course had been directed, and which
was not of any considerable altitude; from the summit we observed
a sheet of water bearing N. 74° W., around which were seven
native fires; eighteen miles N.N.E. we imagined that we perceived
Mount Caroline. We calculated there might be from one to two
thousand acres of very fair arable and pasture land in the
vicinity of this hill; the extent of our journey to-day was
fifteen miles, the general course of which was S.S.W.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Having prepared every thing
for our return, and some of our party their arms, in ease of
rencontres with the natives, whose fires we had seen yesterday,
we proceeded, soon after sun-rise, on our route homewards, and
passing down the valley to the foot of the peak, we entered an
open common, which led us to a thick and almost impenetrable
forest of cable, gum, and tea trees; after struggling for nearly
an hour, we succeeded in forcing our way through the most
impassable part, when we came to a lagoon of salt water; we goon
after fell in with another, which had a similar taste. Upon
reaching the extremity of the forest, which may be four miles in
breadth, we, in three miles, arrived at a hill, on which we found
a rich red loam, of a yielding and pliable nature, but it did not
appear to be of any great extent. We crossed before noon several
grassy hills, on which we found better soil than in the valleys.
We traversed, until we halted this evening, a well wooded
country, which contained a considerable portion of very fine
land. Not being able to find water, we were obliged, much to the
annoyance of some of our party, to put ourselves upon an
allowance for the night; we travelled to-day upwards of eighteen
miles, in a W. ½ N. course. In the morning, we suddenly met with
a party of four natives, who, from the terror and surprise they
manifested at first beholding us, evidently showed that they
could never have seen Europeans before; after two of them had
advanced in a hostile manner to allow the two women who
accompanied them time to escape, they ran away as fast as their
legs could carry them, and disappeared behind a hill.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 3<i>d</i>.&mdash;We started at dawn this
morning to procure water for breakfast, which we found, after
passing several broad and fertile valleys, in one of which we met
with excellent pasture, which appeared to be of some extent;
after travelling six miles, we rested at a spot where we obtained
good herbage for our horses. Traversing after breakfast the same
distance and a similar country, we reached a district where the
surface became more broken and abrupt: our course led us down a
ravine, and we entered a rich and extensive valley; continuing
along this for two miles, we ascended a hill, from which we
observed water in the lower part of it; on proceeding down to it,
we found that we had reached the Avon, about eighteen miles, as
we then conjectured, to the S.E. of Mount Bakewell; it bad here
expanded into a reach of an average breadth of thirty yards; but
on tracing its course downwards, it became contracted, and the
stream was partly concealed amongst the tea trees that lined the
banks; one mile below this we bivouaced for the night, at a
beautiful spot where the river had again become broad and deep,
and which here ran to the westward, after flowing a short
distance north; behind us were two low peaked hills; we here
killed a brace of ducks, &amp;c. &amp;c. Considerably more than
half the land we passed over to-day was of a good quality; we
observed on this part of the river marks of excessive
inundation.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;We determined to spend this
day in examining the valley of the river, in order that we might
give the gentlemen who accompanied us an opportunity of seeing as
much of the country as possible before selecting their grants. We
started at day light this morning with the intention of crossing
the Avon, and proceeding due W. until we intersected one of its
minor branches, which had previously been fallen in with by
Lieutenant Erskine, and from thence to take a N.E. course in the
direction of Mount Bakewell. We crossed the river about one mile
lower down than where we bivouaced, and walked the same
distance-over a lighter and more sandy soil than we had lately
met with, when we arrived at a rivulet running towards the main
branch; leaving this, we ascended the hills on the eastern side,
and again came to good soil and grass, which appeared to be
abundant here; after making a few observations on the surrounding
country, we descended to the Avon, and continued along its banks,
which presented generally a N. by W. direction for five miles,
when we pitched our tent, and as we had arrived at the part we
wished to examine, Messrs. Clarkson, Hardy, and Camfield,
proceeded to the opposite or eastern side, whilst Mr. W. Stirling
and myself proceeded to ascend a hill behind our encampment, one
side of which, towards the east, we found bare and sandy, whilst
on the summit, and apparently to some extent beyond it, we met
with fertile soil: in the afternoon the party returned completely
drenched with rain: they went about three miles down the right
bank, and at the distance of a mile and a half inland, the soil
was of good quality, and the grass plentiful. The stream
occasionally expanded itself in the course of this day's journey,
as it had done yesterday, to a breadth of fifty yards. We started
this morning due W. with the intention of making the western base
of Darling's Range, behind Lieutenant Bull's house on the Canning
River, and passed over an extent of nearly five miles of
beautifully fertile country, the grass on which was growing most
luxuriantly on a rich soil, and was well adapted for agricultural
and grazing purposes; in fact, in the opinion of Mr. Hardy, two
acres of the grass lands in this district were capable of
supporting three sheep per annum. As soon as we came to Darling's
range, an unfavourable change took place in the soil. The range,
at this point, was easy of access, and the travelling good;
during our walk we passed a party of natives sitting round a
fire; they did not appear to take any notice of us, and we did
not disturb them. We walked to-day eighteen miles, over a country
which, from the time we ascended the hills, after having
proceeded live miles from the river, contained occasional patches
of good soil.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;We were unfortunately
detained this morning by the two horses belonging to Mr. Clarkson
straying during the night; leaving him what provisions we could
spare, we proceeded on our journey at 7 o'clock, and travelled
over a more hilly and mountainous country than we had lately
done. Fourteen miles from our bivouac, we arrived at the valley
of the Helena, to which we descended down a deep and precipitous
hill; we crossed it at a place where it was running W.N.W.; we
walked to-day seventeen miles.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;We experienced more
difficulties, and encountered more obstructions this morning than
we had yet met with, owing to numbers of fallen trees. At the
distance of eight miles from last night's bivouac, we arrived at
the height immediately overlooking the plain; from this distance
we were clearly able to distinguish, through a telescope, the
jetty and houses at Perth, and had an extensive sea view,
embracing Garden Island and its neighbouring isles; we also
observed a large and open lagoon, bearing S.W. at the apparent
distance of seven miles. After an estimated journey of fourteen
miles from the foot of the hills, we reached Perth in the
evening, and found then that the Lieutenant Governor had arrived
there a week before us.</p>
<p align="center"><small>GENERAL REMARKS.</small><br></p>
<div>The surface of the country traversed in the expedition above
detailed, would admit of the following descriptive division,
viz:&mdash;open downs destitute of timber, and thickly covered
with low brush,&mdash;open forest land, characterised by its
growth of timber, with little brushwood below,&mdash;swampy
forest land, (which we only twice met with) producing timber
trees growing close together, and thickly matted with an
undergrowth of shrubs,&mdash;and open grassy pasture thinly
wooded. The greater part of the district between Mount Bakewell
and the terminating point of the excursion eastward, consisted of
the second description; the open downs or wolds, bore the next
proportion. The greatest quantity of grass was observed in the
open forest and grassy pasture country. Our limited time, and
expeditious mode of travelling, did not admit of our paying much
attention to the collection of minerals; traces of limestone were
however observed on several occasions. We met with no birds or
animals not previously known to us. Amongst a great profusion of
flowers and shrubs, we observed several apparently new varieties,
one of which bore a red round fruit, about the size of a cherry,
and containing a stone within; two or three other varieties of
shrubs were remarked, producing novel and singular seed
vessels.</div>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>JOURNAL OF AN EXPEDITION</strong>
<i>under the Command of Lieutenant Preston, to explore the Coast
to the Northward of Swan River</i>.</p>
<p align="right"><i>Hired Cutter,
Colonist,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Gage's Roads, Nov. 23d, 1830.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="a">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>In compliance with orders received from Captain Dance, dated
November 3d, 1830, directing me, as soon as the preparations are
complete, "to take charge of the expedition intended to explore
the coast to the northward of this port, to ascertain the
existence or non-existence of ports, anchorages, and inlets on
the coast,&mdash;their value as to security, size, and depth of
water,&mdash;and the nature of the country immediately around
them. In the careful examination of the coast with these views,
the expedition should proceed to the northward; and in the event
of discovering a port of undoubted value, possessing the
qualities most essential to excellence, as well as the probable
success of settlers in its vicinity; the expedition, after having
fully ascertained these matters, is to return to this port with
the intelligence; and in the event of no such discovery being
effected in time to secure the return of the vessel to Gage's
Roads by the 24th instant, your examination of the coast must be
relinquished, so as to make your arrival probable on or about
that day. On your return, if the weather shall admit of it, you
shall yourself leave the vessel while off the mouth of the river,
and immediately report your proceedings to the Lieutenant
Governor, sending the vessel on to the ship with the rest of the
party;"&mdash;I beg leave to deliver to your Excellency the
following report:&mdash;</p>
<p>Strong westerly winds did not permit me to leave Cockburn
Sound till the morning of the sixth instant, when I stood along
shore, at first about a mile and a half off, and latterly, for
the most part, within half or three quarters of a mile, having
reefs and breakers nearly the whole way to leeward; whilst the
vessel was in tolerably good and smooth water, and no soundings,
with eight fathoms. The sea breeze set in early, and blew fresh,
so that I reached an island in latitude 31° 5', and anchored
under it for the night in ten feet water. The passage in was
between two reefs to the southward of the island, which were
partly dry, the channel very narrow, and many rocks in it, with
only three and five feet water on them. On the 7th, I continued
along the coast, keeping sufficiently near to see any estuary or
other opening of any magnitude, with reefs and breakers generally
outside. Off a point, in latitude 30° 49'; there is a high rocky
island, with a passage having eight feet between it and the main.
And in a bay, in latitude 30° 42' there are four islands not laid
down in Capt. King's chart. In the bay I found from four to eight
fathoms water, the soundings being rather uniform. The islands
and reefs between them shelter the north and N.W. part of the
bay, whilst the west and S.W. parts are protected by a continuous
reef, extending from the islands to within about a mile and a
quarter of the south shore, where there is a very good entrance;
a small and more intricate entrance exists between two of the
islands. I stopped examining this bay for the night, and on the
8th proceeded as before. I soon got into Jurieu Bay, and to my no
small disappointment, found, instead of discovering anything more
serviceable to the colony, nothing but a mere bay; it was only
with great care I found water sufficient to navigate my little
vessel, which drew no more than five feet. In passing inside the
islands off Isla Point, I had the like shallowness of water to
contend against; but as I approached the pointy and saw water
extending a long way to the north eastward of it, and land again
north of that, I now firmly thought that something of importance
and utility was within my reach,&mdash;a capacious and secure
harbour, and large river, emptying its waters into it from the
mountains, which a little north of this came down to the coast,
were my too sanguine expectations. It is a large bay, and in the
northern part and middle having depth of water for anchorage; but
unless sheltered by reefs, which are at a long distance, or
immediately under a small island, it is exposed to the N.W.
winds, and not even a streamlet flows into it. I stood to the
northward amid broken water, and very irregular soundings, from
two and a half to six fathoms, till I reached two small islands
in latitude 30° 9', where, finding some shelter from a strong S.
by W. sea-breeze, that now blew in squalls, I remained for the
night. About nine miles along the coast to the northward of this,
I saw, next morning, a large sheet of water over the sand hills
of file beach, which I ascended, to trace its direction, and saw
it extending nearly parallel with the coast, but could see no
opening, either outwards or inwards, to it from the sea or the
interior of the country. A continuation of this lagoon, in every
probability, was visited, three or four miles further south, on
my return, and found to be salt at the latter place, about a
third of a mile from the beach. I then continued along the coast,
looking out most eagerly for harbour, inlet, or estuary; and
always keeping as close as uneven soundings, breakers, and
shallow water permitted, with any degree of prudence. I had built
no small hopes on that part of the coast not seen by Captain
King, but mentioned as laid down from Dutch charts; and it was
with feelings not a little excited, that I saw along the whole of
it this afternoon, and no little disappointment, that this search
was as fruitless as the preceding. It blew very hard from the
S.S.W., and I had prepared every thing to reduce the cutter's
sails as much as possible, previous to hauling off for the night,
when I remarked a little shelter for her under a small reef, in
latitude 29° 18' and off Sandy Patch of the chart; here the
vessel rode, at first very heavy, for the night. The 10th was
passed searching along the land, as before, but with expectations
despairingly diminished. The most commodious harbour, with long
river navigation inland, could, at this distance, be of
comparatively little advantage to the colony. The uniform low
sandy coast which I had passed, with a continuation of reefs and
breakers off it, made me lose the hope of the probability of
improving as I went northerly. I wished much to go as far as
Gantheaunee Bay, but my disappointment with Jurieu Bay, gave
faint hopes even from it; I did not, therefore, deem the
attaining of it a sufficient reason for prolonging the expedition
beyond the period of my orders; a prolongation which I calculated
must be the consequence of my going so far north. The very strong
southerly winds, which had blown with scarcely any intermission,
since my departure from Cockburn Sound,&mdash;too strong for the
cutter to hold her own again, much lead make progress in
beating,&mdash;showed me clearly, that unless they either
diminish in force, or change in direction&mdash;both which,
however, I presumed would be the case in the space of another
fortnight, I would be already behind the time specified for my
return. For these reasons, I determined not to go further north,
than the latitude of 28° 45', where I passed the night, amid
coral reefs, inside a chain of breakers, and where, in bringing
up the vessel, grounded on one of these rocks, by the anchor
coming home. She was soon got off, but not without losing part of
her false keel. At this part of the coast, the nearest hills rise
to a greater height than on the general line of coast to the
south, but are of the same sandy nature, with the same sort of
limestone, as in the vicinity of Swan River. The vegetation is
also still shrubby; the country inland rises into mountains, the
Wizard Hills and Mount Fairfax; but my time did not permit my
getting more than a distant view of them.</p>
<p>The 11th and 12th were passed beating to the southward, and
the night between them and the sea, where I found a heavy swell
and strong breezes; nor was I favoured with their being well to
the westward, as I expected, on standing in shore again on the
latter day; so that, during two days and nights, I only made
thirty miles of latitude. At sunset on the 12th, having observed
shelter inside some reefs, I took advantage of it, and remained
there for the night; nor did I stand out to sea any following
night, always having found shelter, more or less good, and
prefering being in smooth water, and working up inside the reefs,
with the moderate breezes of the mornings and forenoons, for they
could scarcely be called land breezes, so much did they hold to
the southward. In my return, therefore, I was generally very dose
to the shore, often not many fathoms from it, and mutt, in
consequence, have observed any openings or inlets that might have
escaped me before. This closer examination, however, only showed
me a greater number of rocks, reefs, and breakers, with which, I
may say, the coast is universally lined. There are numberless
entrances, and constant shelter inside, but the openings and
anchorages are dangerous, from the number of isolated and hidden
rocks, which rise abruptly from a depth of some fathoms, to
within a few feet of the surface. With the greatest precaution,
being seldom without two persons on the look out, the vessel
sometimes touched on some of them, but never to hurt. It
required, too, the utmost diligence to keep out of the breakers,
for it is a well known fact, and we had proof of it, that an
interval of many minutes occur between the breakers; and unless
the place be observed for a long time, one is not always safe in
standing on. I landed only on six different places of the main
land, all of which were sandy and rocky limestone; the beach I
always found and observed to be good for boat landing, generally
sandy, with only a few rocky heads at long distances from each
other; the surf was always very slight, not so high as to injure
any boat. I remarked some places where water had stood on the
surface, and, by digging, found it to be salt At one place only,
did I find fresh water by digging, and then not of the best
quality. The islands which I saw are of the same appearance as
Carnac, and produce similar vegetation. Several smokes were
observed inland, about latitude 29°, and no other trace of
natives. At our farthest north anchorage, we observed part of the
swinging boom of a large ship, which had been erected above high
water mark.<br>

<p align="center"><strong>GOVERNMENT NOTICE</strong> <i>relative
to Port Leschenault</i>.</p>
<p align="right"><i>Surveyor General's Office, Perth,<br>
March</i> 22<i>d</i>,
1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">On</span> the evening of the 3rd instant the
Lieut.-Governor proceeded to sea, on board the Eagle schooner;
and on the following day, having examined the coast of Geography
Bay throughout its whole extent, the vessel anchored about two
miles inside of Cape Naturaliste. The afternoon of that and the
succeeding day were spent in exploring the neighbouring country.
Its surface was found to be very uneven in altitude, frequently
rising into high granite hills, most of which were either rugged
or sandy on the summits, but the valleys contained a considerable
quantity of good land. Among the cliffs near the Cape, a great
variety of mineral products was observed. Specimens of magnetic
iron ore and copper pyrites were brought away, but it did not
appear that the seams, containing these ores, were of great
thickness. The Bay in which the schooner anchored affords very
good shelter during the summer season, being secured from all
winds to the westward of N.W. and N.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the Eagle took up an anchorage off Vasse River,
and the vicinity of its entrance was examined to the distance of
two or three miles from the shore. The result was not
satisfactory, as it appeared to be a sandy district. The straight
and vigorous growth of the trees gave a contradiction, however,
to the apparent meagreness of the soil.</p>
<p>Fresh water exists in great plenty both here and on the
opposite side of Geographe Bay. On the morning of the 6th instant
the expedition arrived off Port Leschenault. The appearance of
the country being favourable, and a proper position for a
military station being selected, the detachment of the 63rd
regiment, brought from head-quarters by the Eagle, was landed,
together with the stores and provisions necessary for their
maintenance. They founds in the great abundance of building
materials, great facilities in housing themselves, and the
Lieutenant Governor had the satisfaction, before his departure,
to see the party nearly complete in arrangements for their
comfort during the approaching winter.</p>
<p>During the Eagle's stay at Port Leschenault, excursions were
made in every direction which could lead to a knowledge of the
surrounding country. The most important of these was an
expedition of gentlemen volunteers, led by Mr. Roe. They
penetrated to the hilly country, of which Mr. Roe reports in the
following terms:</p>
<p>"Having proceeded up the Collie, about ten miles from the
entrance, the river became obstructed by many fallen trees, and
we quitted it, ten in number, with three days' provisions, to
explore the country to the south eastward. At this place the
water, was perfectly fresh and good, and ran at a very slow pace
to the north westward. Half a mile S.S.E. brought us to an
inconsiderable dry creek, which we crossed, and walked to the
E.S.E. through a beautiful open forest country, swelling
gradually in Hill and valley, and abounding in excellent timber,
growing in a good soil. At the distance of another mile we
crossed over a second creeks which was at this time dry, but
evidently, during the rainy season, is well supplied with water.
We soon afterwards stood to the eastward, for a part of the
principal range of mountains, which appeared through the trees at
the distance of two miles, and at their base came again upon the
Collie, which occupied a width of from eight to fifteen yards;
but from being obstructed below us, it was not a running
stream.</p>
<p>Crossing over, we ascended the range in a N.E. by N.
direction; and on the second ridge were gratified by an extensive
view of the country behind us, and of the well-wooded heights to
the northward and eastward. In the latter direction is some land,
considerably more elevated than that upon which we stood, but
apparently of equal value to the agriculturist and grazier, and
is supplied with good timber. A considerable valley was observed
about two miles to the north; and, judging from the excellent
soil we passed over, both on the hills and flats, it will,
doubtless, be found to possess good land, and probably a branch
of the Collie. Having no water on the mountain, we descended a
mile to the south, when the Collie was again crossed, extending
to the N.W. by N., and we bivouaced on its left bank. Early on
the 10th we resumed our journey to the S.E. by S., across a hilly
forest country, for three miles, when we had crossed the dry beds
of two small brooks, and had arrived upon a more elevated part of
the range, leaving its summit about half a mile to the
eastward.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, was pleased to honour
this with the name of Mount Lennard, after one of my
fellow-travellers. It is well clothed with grass and timber, and
maybe about eighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea.
Here we found a sensible change in the temperature, which was
much more cool than on the plains, and rendered climbing steep
hills comparatively pleasing. Hence we descended S.S.W., and in
less than half a mile came to the bed of a considerable winter
stream, five or six yards wide, containing some pools of
excellent water; small fish being found in these ponds at the
very termination of the dry season, would appear to bespeak their
being never totally dried up. Proceeding three miles farther to
the S.S.W., over a steep but unbroken country, of the same
description as before, we came to a broader valley than usual, in
which were the dry beds of two winter torrents, winding through a
soil much inferior to any we had as yet passed over; beyond it
was some very good land, and to the eastward the country appeared
rich and fertile among the mountains.</p>
<p>We now ascended the steep south-western hill of this range,
and from its summit saw Point Casuarina, bearing N. 63° W. at the
distance of sixteen or seventeen miles. The soil here is very
sandy in places, and much intermixed with rocks and stones; there
is, nevertheless, much good timber upon it, and a great quantity
of banksia.</p>
<p>On its south side is situated the broad and rich valley of the
Preston River, where we found several dry ponds and beds of water
courses stretching to the westward. The Preston, at a mile from
the deep southern shoulder of this hill, was found to have a
width of seven or eight yards between banks of clay and rich
loamy soil, where good water was met with in pools several yards
in circumference, which, in the winter months, must form a stream
of six or eight feet in depth. The country here is tolerably
level forest land, free from underwood, and undulates gently in
easy rising hills, somewhat thickly wooded. Three miles S.W. from
this part of the Preston, over rather a sandy country, brought us
to the verge of some level open plains, covered with grass, and
thinly scattered with trees; their extent was not ascertained,
but we could trace them as far as five or six miles across, and
in the middle came upon the dry bed of a considerable brook,
winding through them to the N.W. by N. The day being now far
advanced, and having met with no water since leaving the Preston,
we traced this channel for about two miles, through a narrow slip
of thickly wooded land, but without meeting the object of our
search. Some heavy dense clouds, which had by that time been
drifted over us by a N.W. gale, then burst out into pouring rain,
and drove us for shelter into the bed of the water course. After
two hours' rain the weather cleared a little, and the continued
perseverance of some of our party, was finally crowned with
success, by kindling us a good fire, which dried our clothes and
blankets, and enabled us to pass a comfortable night. With
day-light of the 11th we started on our return, and steered north
to fall in with the Preston, and procure water for breakfast In
this direction and N.W., we walked nearly six miles over a gently
swelling forest country, with a loamy sandy surface, which, for
the last three miles, was frequently interrupted by extensive
swamps, at this time dry. The Preston was then fallen in with at
the distance of about seven miles, in a direct line from its
entrance, and we remained a couple of hours, on the bank of some
delicious water, to breakfast and refresh. At this dry period of
the year the river had assumed the appearance of a chain of
ponds, from twelve to twenty yards in lengthy and four or five
deep, contained between banks of clay and rocks eight or ten
yards apart. Here we found numerous traces of natives, and plenty
of large muscles; but the latter not being quite good tasted, and
our provisions not totally expended, they were not much eaten. At
noon we set out again at westward, occasionally coming on the
left bank of the river, as it wound through an open forest
country. Findings at the distance of a mile, it crossed our
course, we passed over to the right bank, just above the spot
where the river becomes full between its banks. Two miles
further, over a fertile country, brought us to a navigable part
of the Preston, fifteen or eighteen yards wide, where the water
is brackish, and runs slowly to the northward. From this place we
followed a native path, about four miles towards the entrance of
the river, where we arrived about three o'clock, and finally
rejoined our friends at the encampment, loaded with wild ducks,
cockatoos, and other game, the produce of our sportsmen's
exertions.</p>
<p>It is somewhat remarkable, that throughout this excursion we
saw nothing of the natives, although the traces of them were
evident and numerous in many places; and we passed several of
their old habitations, which were of the usual temporary
construction of boughs and grass. The country passed over, during
our first day's journey from the Collie River, was decidedly
superior to any which afterwards came under our observation, and
appearances left no ground for supposing that it diminished at
all in fertility of soil, as far as the eye could penetrate to
the eastward of that journey's eastern limit. The country in the
neighbourhood, and to the eastward of Mount Lennard, is elevated
end mountainous, but bears a promising appearance, having some
considerable valleys at the base of the hills, which are probably
well supplied with water. Towards the south end of the mountains,
between the Collie and Preston, upon which his Excellency, the
Lieutenant-Governor, has been pleased to bestow the name of
"Roe's Range", the country becomes more sandy, and where the
surface is not interrupted by the protusion of the granite
formation of the range, it is partially covered with loose
fragments of quartz and quartz rock. This description of country
seems to prevail in those parts of the range which are exposed to
the southerly winds.</p>
<p>The district of the Preston is not so fertile as that of the
Collie, nor is it so considerable in point of size or inland
navigation; but no soil can be finer than that on its banks, and
the country through which it winds from the S.E. is more uniform
and easy of access. The explorations which took place were not so
extensive: regarding them it is only necessary to state the
general result. There appear to be three rivers in the district,
on the banks of which there is generally excellent alluvial soil.
The southernmost river, which is named the 'Preston', is
navigable for the largest boats about five miles from its mouth,
and is at that point a running stream of good water. Its banks
are rich in soil and timber, but the former of these becomes
sandy on receding from the river side.</p>
<p>The middle river, the 'Collie', is navigable for ten or twelve
miles, nearly up to the foot of the hills; the soil on its banks
is not very good for three miles from its entrance, but it is
there joined by a river flowing from the north, and the country,
in ascending from this junction, improves, and becomes of an
excellent description. The north river was not
explored.&mdash;Upon the whole, the district of Port Leschenault
appears to possess a considerable quantity of good land. There
are portions of it which are sandy; but it holds out,
particularly in the goodness of the hilly country, as described
above, great attractions to settlers. The anchorage off the bar
of Port Leschenault, is open to winds between north and
north-west. It seems to be a good summer resort for vessels of
any size, but at present it cannot be recommended as a winter
resort.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the Eagle proceeded to the Murray, and anchored
off its entrance on the following morning. Her stay here did not
admit of an extensive examination of the country. The inlet
appears to be similar to those at Port Leschenault, Vasse River,
and Melville Water. These inland waters will probably hereafter
afford great facilities in catching and curing fish for
exportation, as well as for the water carriage of
commodities.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Eagle returned to Gage's Roads.</p>
<p>Such are the details of an excursion which has added
considerably to the knowledge of the territory previously
possessed. Although there has been in the course of it, no very
striking discovery, the general result has afforded the
Lieutenant-Governor the greatest satisfaction, by shewing that
the industry, enterprise, and intelligence of the settlement need
not remain unemployed, for want of the materials on which to
act.</p>
<p>The country inland from Port Leschenault, as far as it has
been seen, offers fertile soil, and good stock stations. The
climate is decidedly cooler than in this district; and, judging
from the quantity of grass, and the verdure of the foliage, it
appears to sustain a dry season not so long in duration as that
experienced in this quarter.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the Lieutenant-Governor recommends it to
the notice of settlers; and with a view to give them facility in
locating themselves there, he has established a military station
on the northern point of the entrance, to serve as a place of
security to those who may proceed there in the first instance. He
has also directed all the district comprised within a line S.E.
100 miles from the entrance, and thence eastward, to be added to
the district already open for location. All persons who may have
claims under the present mode of distributing land, will do
wisely to make an early selection in the territory thus laid
open, as it is not intended to open other districts during the
current year, at the end of which the present mode of
distribution will expire.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>GOVERNMENT NOTICE</strong> <i>relative
to Port Augusta.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>Surveyor General's Office, Perth</i>,<br>
11<i>th May</i>,
1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">On</span> the 29th ultimo, the
Lieutenant-Governor, accompanied by Capt. Currie, and several
other gentlemen, embarked on board the Emily Taylor, and sailed
from Gage's Roads. On the following Sunday, the vessel reached
Cape Leewin, and anchored in the evening of that day, near the
mouth of an inlet communicating with the sea in the N.W. course
of the bay, eastward from the cape. The following day was given
to the examination of the country near the anchorage.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, an expedition was undertaken to ascertain the
nature of the shores of the inlet to the N.W.</p>
<p>On Wednesday and Thursday, after similar excursions were made,
and the site of a town, to be called Augusta, being determined
on, the settlers, who were passengers on board the brig,
commenced their disembarkation.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Lieutenant Governor, accompanied by several
gentlemen and boats, proceeded to explore the principal river.
They ascended the stream all that day, and great part of the
next, and eventually returned to the vessel at a late hour on
Sunday evening.</p>
<p>On Monday, the disembarkation was completed; the Downs to the
N.W. of the inlet were visited, and the necessary water got on
board.</p>
<p>On Wednesday mornings the brig quitted her anchorage, and
proceeded to examine the coasts of the bay to the eastward.
Having reached the "Black Point" of Flinders on the evening of
that day, her course was directed, on her return, to Gage's
Roads, wherein we arrived on the 10th instant.</p>
<p>The result issuing out of this expedition may be classed under
two heads. First, the knowledge which has been acquired of the
district visited; and, secondly, the establishment in it of a
small but efficient body of settlers, with the fairest prospect
of their success. The portion of the southern coast seen during
this excursion, taken in connection with knowledge already
possessed, leads to the belief, that there are three distinct
ranges of primitive mountains traversing the territory of Western
Australia, from north to south. The highest and easternmost of
these has its southern termination near to King George's Sound.
The second terminates at Cape Chatham, and is that of which
General Darling's Range, behind Cockburn Sound, is a portion.
Cape Leeuwin is the termination of the third range. This seems to
be inferior in extent, as well as in altitude, to the two other
ranges, as it disappears at Cape Naturaliste, and is not again
seen except in "Moresley's flat-topped Range", 300 miles to the
north on the same meridian. On these ranges, and in their
intervening valleys, the soil varies according to the position
and altitude. On the higher hills and mountains, the surface is
rugged and stony in the regions intermediate between their
summits and their bases; the soil is excellent: but in the
principal valleys and lower grounds, where the sand-stone
formation prevails, it is of a very inferior description, except
where the deposit of rivers may have altered its character. These
general rules are exemplified in the neighbourhood of the
newly-formed town of Augusta, and may be taken as applicable
generally to all other parts of the territory, except on the sea
coast, where the regular formations have been invaded and
modified by extraneous substances, generally of a calcareous
nature.</p>
<p>The position chosen for the new town possesses the advantages
of excellent soil, plenty of good water, a pleasant aspect, and
easy access in moderate weather to the anchorage and to the
interior country. The inlet is of considerable extent, and leads
to a river named the Blackwood, which runs to the north about
fifteen miles, and then ten miles to the east, before it comes to
be navigable for boats. Its banks are covered with good timber of
the stringy bark and red gum kinds, but the soil is a light sandy
loam, which is seldom strong enough for cultivation. The best
soil, the finest blue gum timber, and some good grass, are to be
found on the hilly lands; but even on the rest of the land there
is generally food for cattle, and on the downs skirting the
coast, fine sheep pasturage. The anchorage is sheltered from the
usual winter winds, but is open to those which blow between south
and E.S.E. Its merits cannot be estimated without further
experience: if it should not be found objectionable, the
qualities of the surrounding country, and the position of
Augusta, with reference to the navigation of these seas, will
make it a convenient place for vessels to stop at, on their way
to the eastern colonies from England, India, and the Gape; and on
these terms, there is reason to hope for its considerable
commercial prosperity.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>JOURNAL</strong> <i>of Lieut. Ad.
Erskine, 63rd Regiment, travelling from Perth to the eastward,
over Darling's Range, in the month of September</i>, 1830.</p>
<p><i>Monday, September</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started from Perth
at 10 o'clock a.m. Made the left bank of the Swan River at Capt.
Byrne's, by 4 o'clock p.m. Mach difficulty in crossing the river;
obliged to halt in consequence.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at day light from
Capt. Byrne's, starting a S.E. course. By 3 o'clock p.m. had
crossed an undulating country, intercepted with swamps and
lagoons. By 5 o'clock p.m., had crossed a line clear mountain
stream, running about S.S.W.; also had crossed the first tier of
hills. Ascent and descent sudden, but easy of access. Surface
rocky, with iron stone, and thinly wooded. From summit had a
distinct view to the westward of Garden and Rottenest Islands,
also of the Swan and Canning Rivers. Could not distinguish any
houses. After marching about twenty-five miles, bivouaced on a
fine clear mountain stream, having a north-easterly course.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at day light.
Course east. Crossed several tiers of hills, some of which bore
east and west. General appearance of the country, mountainous,
some being detached. Surface, a continuation of iron stone. Fine
open forest, chiefly of the blue gum and stringy bark. Crossed
three mountain streams, running as before, to the north east:
much difficulty in crossing one. Obliged to swim the horses
twice. After a march of about eighteen miles, bivouaced on one of
the streams alluded to, which evidently very recently had
overflowed its banks to a perpendicular height of thirty feet,
making it of considerable widths it at present being about
twenty-five yards. Bay horse very much jaded. N.B. The stream
fell two feet and a half during the night.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, September</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at day
light Course as before. Morning very windy, with occasional hard
squalls of rain. Kangaroo and birds in abundance. Crossed one
very steep and high hill. View from the summit of no very great
extent, except to the southward, where a very high blue mountain,
distance about twenty-five miles, was visible. Appearance of the
country, the same as yesterday. Tracks of emu. Bay horse
exceedingly weak. Both of them with sore backs. After a march of
about fourteen miles, bivouaced near a swamp.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at day light.
Course east. After travelling for two hours over an undulating
country, came on an extensive flat of about four miles. Fine open
forest. Native huts, eight in number, very substantially built.
Surface, iron stone and sand. Country again as before,
exceedingly mountainous. Bivouaced under high rock of granite
stone. Travelled about fifteen miles.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at day light.
After travelling for about four hours, over an exceedingly hilly
country. Surface nothing but rock, heavy sand, iron stone,
besides a thick brushwood. The bay horse was unable to proceed.
Halted for two hours and a half, during which time I ascended the
summit of a very high hill, in hopes of finding water. A fine
dear rivulet to the N.E., with rich green banks, was visible
about five miles distant, made it by sun-set. Excellent food for
the horses; the only good spot since my departure. Intend halting
here all to-morrow, to rest the cattle. Bivouaced, after marching
fifteen miles.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked on the banks of the
stream mentioned. Traversed it for about six miles to the
southward of the course of the stream. Found a continuation of
very good soil, "chiefly a red loam." The very high blue mountain
spoken of on Thursday, bearing to the southward, again visible in
the same direction. Weather delightful, but "nights very cold".
Bivouaced on the same ground as last night.</p>
<p><i>Monday, September</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at
daylight. Course east. Made the summit of a high hill by an
almost imperceptible ascent. Had a fine clear view to the
eastward for an extent of nearly thirty miles. Country appeared
undulating and thickly wooded; towards the horizon mountainous.
Traversed over a rich country for about six miles, when I made
the summit of a very singular, and very high abrupt rock, bearing
N.E. Had an extensive view to the eastward, as likewise to the
southward, and N.W. The blue mountain spoken of was very visible,
and appeared to run out into an extensive plain to the eastward.
The mountains to the N.W. by no means so high as those towards
the S.E. To the east had an extensive view of about fifty miles
over a thickly wooded undulating country, inclining, as observed
before, towards the horizon, to be mountainous. Could not see any
water. Proceeded for about five miles over a rich hilly country,
when we were met by natives, whom we found fishing, to our great
and agreeable surprise, on the banks of the river described by
Mr. Dale. Bivouaced, it being almost dark before we readied the
river. March about twenty miles.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, September</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at
day-light, following the course of the river, varying from N.N.W.
to N.W. To cross it was totally impossible, on account of the
depth of the mud. It appeared to have its source in the direction
of the blue mountain spoken of. However, to dear up any doubt
about its being the same river Mr. Dale discovered, I intend
proceeding to his depôt After marching five miles, we found his
tracks which we followed that day for ten miles, over a fine rich
pasture land. Crossed several small streams running east from the
mountains into the river, which was thickly covered with shrubs
and underwood, occasionally opening into a clear undisturbed
stream. Bivouaced on its banks, after marching about fifteen
miles.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, September</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at
day-light. Continued our course on the banks of the river,
following Mr. Dale's track. Still a continuation of rich soil,
which seemed to prevail to some extent over the hills on the
opposite banks. Horses again not able to proceed. After a severe
day's march of about ten miles, over a very heavy country, we
arrived at Mr. Dale's depôt; but to the mortification of the
party, with the exception of the natives who were in company with
us, about twenty-five in number, we found every thing damaged.
Bivouaced near the same spot.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, September</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Obliged to halt
on the banks of the river, the horses not being able to travel.
Natives become very numerous and rather troublesome, in fact, too
friendly. A much more athletic tribe than those seen at Perth.
"The whole party under the effects of purgatives, which we
attributed to drinking the river water, the same having a
peculiar taste; as also being very soft." Swans and wild fowl in
abundance, as likewise kangaroo. Fearful the bay horse will not
be able to return. Bivouaced on the same ground as yesterday.</p>
<p align="center"><small>RETURN HOME TO PERTH.</small></p>
<p><i>Friday, September</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at
day-light. Horses in much better heart. Traversed the course of
the river for about five miles, where it had assumed a fine,
clear, uninterrupted stream, running about three and a half
knots, and about sixty yards wide, also very deep. We had crossed
a wide mountain stream, running into the river. Changed my course
to west, having the course of the river about west-north-west.
After traversing an undulating country for about three miles, and
crossing occasional mountain streams, running towards the river,
we found a very sensible change in the soil varying at short
intervals from a red loam to a sandy substance, which continued
over a very gradual ascent. We were obliged to travel (for twelve
miles), on account of not meeting with water, an unusual
circumstance. Bivouaced near a swamp, after marching about twenty
miles. "Fine open forest." Same style of country around me.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, September</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at
day-light. Course west. After crossing the swamp, traversed over
a very hilly country of fine open forest, with occasional fine
timber, chiefly mahogany. Surface same as the preceding day.
Kangaroos and birds in great abundance. Bay horse again very much
jaded. Obliged to halt in consequence. Bivouaced on mountain
stream. Course about S.E., after a journey of eight miles.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, September</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bay horse not able
to proceed till mid-day, and then not carrying weight. After
travelling for about six miles over a hilly, stony country, of
thick brushwood, I made the summit of a high mountain, (bearing
N.W.), from whence was a distinct view of the sea in the horizon
to the westward, as likewise some very large sheet of water.
Appearance of the country, the same as described before.
Bivouaced on a mountain stream running N.W. Marched about eight
miles.</p>
<p><i>Monday, September</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at
day-light, following the mountain stream running N.W., which I
conceived to be the source of the Swan River. Traversed it over
precipitous rocks, occasioning waterfalls of no very great
height. Found it to discharge itself immediately, at the base of
the mountains into a large swamp. Bay horse again not able to
proceed. Obliged to halt, after marching about six miles. Bay
horse seized with the staggers; took from him about four quarts
of blood. Visited by the natives, whom we could easily perceive
had been in Perth. Bivouaced near the swamp.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, September</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Started at
day-light. Bay horse much better, though not able to carry
weight. Traversed round the south side of the swamp, where was
found a wide stream running south, which we crossed, and then
made a south-westerly course. After marching nine miles, made the
Swan River about two miles above Mr. Jack's residence. We then
proceeded for Messrs. Thompson and Trimmer's residence, where we
crossed, and bivouaced about one mile and a half further
down.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, September</i> 22<i>nd</i>,&mdash;Started at
day-light. Bay horse much better, able to carry weight. Arrived
at Perth 4 o'clock p.m.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>A REPORT</strong> <i>of Captain
[Thomas] Bannister's Journey to King<br>
George's Sound, over Land</i>.</p>
<p align="right"><i>February</i> 5<i>th</i>.
1831.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="a">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I beg leave to state to you, for the information of his
Excellency, the Lieutenant Governor, that agreeably to the
instructions contained in a letter of the 5th of December last,
which his Excellency did me the honour to address to me, I on the
14th of December, accompanied by Mr. Smythe, of the Surveyor
General's Department, John Gringer, and John Galway, commenced
our journey from Fremantle to King George's Sound. To Mr. Smythe
was entrusted the direction of our route. I understood he had
been furnished with all that was requisite from the office, to
enable him to do so. I shall take as rapid a sketch as possible
of our route, remarking merely what I consider main features on
it, begging leave to refer his Excellency to my journal for
details, and also to the plan which Mr. Smythe will furnish. I
have not attempted to give any details of the mineralogical or
botanical productions of the country, as, even if I were capable,
it would be impossible, except by accident, to come to any sound
opinion on the former, and the latter would have required more
time than we had to bestow. I have confined myself simply to the
nature of the land, the timber upon it, and the rivers, &amp;c.
flowing through it, together with the bearings of a few
remarkable hills. As to the trees, I have used such terms as are
generally known in the colony, with a view that the details in
the journal, if thought worth readings might be clearly
understood by all. In the first instance, we proceeded to St.
Anne's Mountain, on the left bank of the Canning, above Helmscott
about ten miles, when, for the convenience of water, making the
Canning, as I knew we should do so in several places, and also
that we might cross the Darling Range quickly, we took a S.E.
course, and passed the range from the summit of St. Anne's Hill
in two days, travelling only about twenty miles. These hills are
exceedingly rugged, but on them the finest timber, known in the
colony by the name of mahogany; in some of the valleys tolerably
good soil, of a light hazel colour, with an abundance of herbage,
fit for cattle on their way from a good interior country to the
coast; on the uplands iron-stone, with a little gravel and scrub.
Arriving on the eastern side of the range in the evening of the
18th, I was induced, seeing a hilly though lower country before
us, to continue our route to the S.E., in the hope of entering on
those extensive plains of which Mr. Dale and others had spoken so
favourably, as being a few miles more to the northward; we
therefore pursued the S.E. course until the 23d of December, when
coming to a more level country, and by Mr. Smythe's observations,
we were in lat. 33° 3' long. 117° 15' we changed our route to the
S. by E. From the higher range of Darling's Mountains to the
point where we changed our direction, we computed it to be about
forty miles; and the Assistant Surveyor's observations agreeing
with distance supposed to have been traversed at the time, I
concluded our position as correctly laid down.</p>
<p>The character of the country through which we had passed, was
generally not so good as I had hoped to have seen, but there were
not wanting tracts of excellent land&mdash;that for upwards of
six miles broad, for instance, as mentioned in the Journal of the
19th December;&mdash;and as it is a country in which there is a
great deal of food for stock, I would by no means condemn it; on
the contrary, my impression was, on a closer examination, there
will be found available land to a considerable extent to the west
and east, in both of which directions the water courses tended
generally, and in their courses the soil was generally a very
fair brown loam. The timber is the mahogany, the blue and red
gums, with (in the valleys of the last few miles) the white gum;
in the swamps, and very low lands, the banksia and tea tree. From
the 23d to the 5th of January we pursued a S. by E. course for
eighty or ninety miles of actual distance, through, in many
tracks, a country which surpassed our most sanguine expectations;
a very great proportion of this tract was land of the first
description, fit for the plough, sheep, or cattle. The beauty of
the scenery near to, and distant from, the rivers which we
crossed, is equal to any I have seen in the most cultivated
timbered country, in those parts of Europe which I have happened
to pass through. The character of the country generally is
undulating, with here and there moderately high hills, some of
them crowned with rocks of granite, pudding-stone rocks, and a
blue stone; but there are broad flat lands and valleys, the
former of which, as will be seen in the Journal, not unfrequently
extended several miles, even in some places far beyond our power
to ascertain. The hills were in general so gradual in their
ascent, that where those of a rougher character were seen, they
only gave a certain character to the country, that destroyed the
dull feeling of the mind which a mere flat country engenders in
many. When I consider that the rivers, five of which we crossed,
not to mention the numerous water courses, some of which still
had water in pools in them, traversed the country from E. to W.,
and that our course being nearly N. and S. we cut them; I cannot
but think that the colony must possess a body of fertile land, of
no inconsiderable magnitude, in this part of its territory. I am
the more sanguine in this view, from the fact of our having taken
excursions from our bivouac of the 24th of December (when we were
detained several days by the state of our horses) for several
miles in every direction, and each night we returned exceedingly
gratified. It may not, perhaps, be uninteresting to mention, that
on the first of June we entered a country in which grows a tree,
about as large as an English plum tree, not unlike it in its
size, in its leaf and branches, but its stem resembles more that
of the pear tree when old; it bears a nut almost round, having a
strong shell, and as large as a pigeon's egg, with small holes in
it similar to the almond, and an out covering, which it throws
off apparently when ripe. The kernel we found nutritious,
possessing a glutinous property, and very easy of digestion. I am
afraid to say more, lest disappointment should be felt by any
individual whose fortune may lead him to this remote part of the
world; but unquestionably, from the quantity of good land, the
excellence of the water, which I have no doubt, when the country
becomes known, might be obtained, renders it not undeserving of
the closest examination. The trees are the mahogany on the higher
and rugged lands, but among them the white and red gum. I should
remark, that in this district it most frequently happens that
under them we found herbage generally, which affords excellent
food for stock at this unfavourable season of the year; many
parts had recently been burnt, probably last year, and this year
the herbage was quite green and fresh. On the sides of the hills,
the lowlands, and crowning the more moderately high hills, grew
the white and red gum generally, and the nut tree, near to the
rivers and large water courses, a few of the blue gums, and the
wattle, and on the immediate banks of the rivers the tea tree,
and banksia, &amp;c. In many places the country had a most
fertile appearance, not possessing more timber than was necessary
for ornament.</p>
<p>As by Mr. Smythe's observations we were to the east of King
George's Sound, it was deemed necessary to proceed more westerly.
(By his observations we were got quite near to our destination,
but experience proved that his observations were erroneous, and
that our travelling had been greatly overrated). Seeing,
therefore, some elevated lands to the S.W., distant one mile and
three-quarters, we turned towards them, and ascending the
highest, but not observing any thing satisfactory, we pursued
four days and a half a course to the S., making forty miles. We
were then, owing to the difficulty, it being mountainous and the
underwood extremely thick, obliged to bear away to the S. by W.,
which course we pursued for a day and a half, making sixteen
miles and a half; thence coming to some granite rocks, and seeing
from them some high mountains, three of which were conical and of
considerable altitude, one of them had two bare heads,&mdash;and
Mr. Smythe being of opinion that this two-headed mountain was to
the north of King George's Sound&mdash;we directed our steps
towards it, halting for the night on the banks of a considerable
river flowing to the south.</p>
<p>The following morning, the 12th of January, on reaching it,
left the men and ascended to the summit, from which nothing
satisfactory could be seen; as far as the eye could reach, was
one vast forest; to the S. and S.W. by W. high lands, twenty to
thirty miles distant. The intermediate country presented
occasional open valleys, winding between apparently moderately
high hills to the eastward; in the distance, were high hills or
mountains; behind the southern hills, we hoped to come to the
sea, a matter now of great importance to us, as our provisions
were nearly expended; we therefore, seeing, as we imagined,
through the smoke and haze, sand hills bearing S.W. by W.,
directed our steps towards them, until the evening of the
following day, making seventeen miles, when, not finding the
hills we had hoped to have reached, we turned due south,
determined to pursue it, until I came to the sea, as, from
whatever cause, I was almost certain that we were a long distance
from King George's Sound, and that, consequently, our provisions
being all expended, with the exception of tea for twelve days,
and a little tobacco, our very existence depended upon procuring
shell-fish from the rocks. Shooting birds was very uncertain, and
kangaroos more so.</p>
<p>On the 16th we made the coast, having for the last day,
traversed as rough a country as can be imagined. We travelled two
days and could only make seven or eight miles by toiling the
whole day: by Mr. Smythe's observation, we were only forty-three
miles west of King George's Sound, but it proved to be to the
eastward of Cape Chatham,&mdash;west of Nornor-up, nine miles; we
had made, therefore, but about twenty miles west since turning
from our S. by E. line on the 5th of January. Mr. Smythe
attributes the mistakes in his observations to his not having a
watch, and partly to the instruments with which he was furnished
from his office, being out of order. He will, I trust, be able to
give, a satisfactory explanation to his Excellency. The country
through which we passed to the double peaked mountain, which
proved to be the Mount Mitchell of Dr. Wilson, and the
Matchercrop of the natives. Dr. Wilson saw it when twenty miles
off; to the eastward, is, in general, very hilly, and in tracts,
may be called mountainous; the soil is of an excellent quality in
many places. On the 6th and 9th for instance, before we came to
the considerable rivers which I mention having crossed on those
days, and after you have crossed them, you find a rich brown
earth. On the 6th, it will be observed, the land was not much
encumbered by timber, and neither was it on the 9th, immediately
near to the river; but the latter was a much more hilly country;
the grass and herbage, of an excellent description, was thick,
and higher than the knee, nearly up to the summit of the hills;
we thought that an immense number of stock might be kept there
(near the banks of the rivers) in the driest months; but away
from them I am not quite so clear, except the settler went to the
expence of deepening some of the channels of the water course;
but really, journeying as we did through the country, it is next
to impossible to say what capabilities it has or has not. These
were not the only days on which we passed over, for a
considerable distance, what appeared to us to be fair land, but
so thickly timbered, it would require great nerve in a settler,
and great support from Government, to venture among them, with
any hope (without great means) of success. The forest trees are
the mahogany, the red and white gum. On the higher hills, and on
the poor lands, the former predominated,&mdash;on the lower
lands, and sides of the hills, where good land was, the latter;
there were the usual trees, such as the banksia, tea tree,
&amp;c., in this tract; as for underwood, there was great
quantity in some places. From the double peaked mountain to the
coast, is only about thirty miles; we made first seventeen miles
to the S.W. ½ W., then sixteen or eighteen miles to the south. To
attempt to say anything of the soil for a considerable distance,
except that which we actually trode upon, and the open valleys
and swamps, would be absurd; the underwood was so thick, that it
was, in many places, with the greatest difficulty that we could
get on, and occasionally we were obliged to make a road with our
hatchet. The trees were principally the blue gum; and if others
had not seen them, I should be afraid to speak of their
magnitude; I measured one, it was, breast-high, forty-two feet in
circumference; in height, before a branch, 140 or 150 we thought
at least, and as straight as the barrel of a gun: from the
immense growth of these trees, I formed an opinion that the land
upon which they grew could not be bad; what little we did see was
a brown loam, capable of any cultivation, and where the underwood
was not remarkably thick, grass and herbage grew
luxuriantly,&mdash;such was the character of the country
generally as far as we could see; at a distance, you would
suppose that the country was very undulating, and broken in
places; but the height of the woods give it a much higher
appearance than it really has, and being intersected with swamps
and valleys, with very few trees on them, and those of stunted
banksia or tea tree, they have the full advantage of their
height. In these valleys there is a vast quantity of feed for
stock, but not sheep: coarse grass herbage and brush&mdash;they
are dry enough in summer to pass over&mdash;some of them are
several miles in lengthy and one or two broad. Within five miles
of the sea, you come to sand hills, which are as difficult to
pass over as the woods, for the horses, being extremely broken;
those over which we passed were well calculated for sheep, being
covered with an abundance of grass, a pea, thorn, and the
peppermint. We had now been absent from Fremantle thirty-three
days; we had halted, on account of our horses, six days, and had
made, on some days, very little head-way, on one occasion only
three miles. We reached the coasts therefore, in twenty-seven
days travelling; had we not turned off on the 5th of January, I
have not a doubt but that we should have reached our destination
in twenty-eight days, including our six days halt, since we
should soon have entered upon the country described by Dr.
Wilson, and we should have escaped a most difficult march to the
coast, and also the disasters and sufferings to which we were
exposed white on the coast for nineteen days without provisions,
and for several days before we reached it. But then, if I may be
permitted to remark it, if this colony prospers,&mdash;and from
the body of good land in the interior, of the existence of which
I have now no doubt,&mdash;a certain good will arise from our
disasters, since I am tolerably certain it would not have been
traversed for years to come; and, consequently, the fact of there
being good land, even among these hills, would not have been
known to exist. I shall not trouble his Excellency with a long
detail of our sufferings; I shall merely state, that we were on
the coast for nineteen days, depending entirely upon shell-fish
for subsistence; sometimes, where we found them, and the surf was
not too great, we fared pretty well. The delay this mode of
procuring subsistence occasioned, together with the exceeding bad
travelling for our horses, (two of which, on our arrival on the
coast, were very nearly exhausted, though they had but little to
carry,) was very great, and the fatigue excessive, so that by the
time we arrived at King George's Sound, we were all nearly
exhausted, though we were able the last day, through the friendly
aid of the natives, (who showed us the native path,) to walk
twelve miles, all, with the exception of John Gringer, carrying
knapsacks. This man would have suffered as much as any of us, had
he carried the same weight. It will be seen, that on the 21st and
27th of January, we lost two of the horses, they could go no
farther; I beg you will assure his Excellency they were done
every justice to by the men who led them,&mdash;privation, want
of rest, and exceeding bad travelling, were the causes of their
death. We passed round an estuary, "Nornorlip", nine miles from
where we made the coast; had time permitted, or, in other words,
had we had provisions, we should have examined the entrance to
this sheet of water, which I have since heard, possesses a port
for large vessels. We succeeded, at low water, in crossing at a
depth of at most four feet, the outlets of two estuaries; they
were apparently as large as the Murray Waters; besides these, the
outlets of two other estuaries, which were choked up by sand
thrown up by the S.E. wind. I beg to refer his Excellency to Mr.
Smythe's plan for an outline of the coast and of these
waters;&mdash;it will be sufficient for me to say here, that the
land, near the coast, is generally high, having headlands of
granite rocks, which appear here and there in the bays; some of
these bays have a tolerable beach, with high sand hills, at the
back of these we principally travelled, and it is as fatiguing a
country as ever man or horse walked over; for about three miles
inland, there 19 but little wood,&mdash;in the hollows, a few of
the banksia, a little cedar, swamp oak, tea tree, grass tree,
scrub, and bushes, and, I should add, the peppermint tree, and
always water.</p>
<p>On the 4th of February we arrived here. I have not words to
convey to his Excellency the great kindness and friendship (of
which we stood in the greatest need) with which we were received
by Captain Barker, (the commandant,) and officers of the
settlement. Dr. Davies, of the 39th, and Mr. Kent, of the
Commissariat; and, under the care of Dr. Davies, the party, I.
trust, will soon recover its strength. From what I have written,
it will be concluded, and justly so, that there is a body of
available laud, with certain extensive tracts or the richest
description, fit for the plough, sheep, or cattle, or indeed any
cultivation in the interior, commencing about twenty-five or
thirty miles from King George's Sound, which, under a judicious
system of colonization, the main roads being made in the first
instance by forced labour, would, in the course of a few years,
become inhabited by thousands of industrious men, sent out by the
parishes of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or brought out by
individuals bettering their condition, as well as relieving their
country. I have been induced to make this remark, from the
conviction that we can do nothing without the powerful aid of
Government, in our infancy. Like every young community, we must
be nursed at first, which, though perhaps a little costly, will
give rise to a good feeling towards our country, in those who
follow us, which will last for ages.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>ACCOUNT</strong> <i>of the Country
intervening between Augusta<br>
and Swan River</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">About</span> 6 a.m., in the morning of the
15th March instant, we set off from Augusta without any compass;
our party consisted of John Dewar and Andrew Smith.</p>
<p>Our provisions were, for the whole party, 10lbs. of bread,
4lbs. of beef, one canteen of water (half a gallon), 4lbs. of
sugar, and ½lb. of tea. We had guns and ammunition by us. Our
course, at first, was over the Conical Hills; from these to Swan
River we kept constantly in sight of the sea. On the evening we
encamped on a small fresh water lake, about four acres, having
very inferior land round it. This day's march we reckoned from
twenty-five to twenty-seven miles. On the second morning, as also
on every succeeding morning, we started before sun-rise,
continuing our march sometimes by moonlight. This day we passed
over better land, the country rather hilly, consisting of a good
brown loam. This district had been lately burnt. We crossed
several burns or brooks running towards the sea, containing
excellent water; we occasionally killed some sea birds; for
during the first and second days we walked mostly on the sea
beach. We found the head and part of the body of a sea-horse. We
did not see any seals, but saw one whale with the flesh still on,
but the blubber cut off. On the third day we struck inland to cut
off some projecting points, but never went further than five
miles from the shore. In the evening we struck towards the shore
again, and came upon a deep bay, with a heavy surge on the shore,
and many rocks and breakers, extending from the bay out to six or
eight miles, to sea. We here found the jolly boat of the
Cumberland, with the ship's name on her stem, and other parts of
the Cumberland. Between this bay and Cape Naturaliste we found
the best land in the whole of our route. We reckoned our march on
this and the succeeding days at an average of twenty-five miles.
The land passed over to-day was still superior to that of
yesterday. The country generally between this and our first day's
encampment was undulating with fine valleys, well covered with a
silky grass, not the kangaroo grass; and with plenty of capital
springs. The ground is not flooded ground&mdash;it contains many
excellent situations for farms, well cleared of timber. On the
evening of the third day, two or three miles from the boat, we
came to a river about thirty or forty feet wide at the mouth, but
much wider about one hundred yards upwards; there was a naked
sand-bank all across the mouth, over which we passed; this bank
or bar was forty yards from the sea. The black boys, growing in
the country we had hitherto passed over, were the underground
ones, the rushes of which are not brittle. On the fourth we
traversed the same description of country as on the third; we
kept at the distance of from three to five miles from the
sea-shore. On the fifth day we encountered some very brushy
country, and very rough and rocky; they were decidedly lime-stone
rocks,&mdash;I know them to be so from having wrought at a
lime-stone quarry&mdash;their quality was very good. We found
plenty of good water, in the shape of springs, in the hollows of
the rock sloping down to the sea; this day we did not exceed ten
miles. On the sixth day (Sunday) we went round Cape Naturaliste,
keeping the sea-shore the whole of the sixth day. We met a single
native, who led us to a spring in a swamp, close to the shore,
the water very bad and brackish. This native was very
troublesome, trying to push us off the rocks, and steal from us.
On the first part of this day we could find no water among the
rocks. From Cape Naturaliste to Port Leschenault we kept along
the shore. From the Conical Hills near Augusta to Cape
Naturaliste we kept at from three to four miles from the shore,
on a ridge of low hills. Inland the country to our right
consisted of a deep extensive valley, immediately on the right of
the ridge we were walking upon; beyond this valley, further
inland, the country rose gently, being moderately covered with
lofty fresh looking trees, gum and mahogany. Beyond this gentle
rise we could not see further inland. In the large valley we
found fresh water of excellent quality, standing in little pools;
it appeared to be the bed of a stream. The whole of the country,
between the Conical Hills and Cape Naturaliste, has been burnt.
On the ridge upon which we walked there was not a large tree in a
whole day's walking; there was scarcely any thing else but the
ground blackboys, with an occasional bush and creepers. On the
evening of the fourteenth day we fell in with a bush growing on
the rocks, overhanging the sea, having a fruit growing in
clusters, consisting of berries about the size of a grape, of
yellowish white colour, with a brownish tint on the top. We eat
great quantities of this berry, and found it very pleasant; it
was agreeably acid. On the evening of the sixth day (having been
on short allowance two days before) the provisions we brought
with us from Augusta were finished. From the 6th to the evening
of the 8th, we had nothing to eat but the Hottentot fig, and a
sturgeon which we killed with a ramrod. We got to Port
Leschenault on the eighth day, but lost a day and a half in
trying to head the river, and in making a raft, on which we
crossed, and then picked out some doll and Indian corn from the
remains of the provisions left there. Between this and the Murray
we shot some birds. We crossed the Vasse by fording, near the
mouth, under the guidance of two natives. Between Augusta and
Cape Naturaliste we only shot some sea birds. We found great
quantities of periwinkles, of a large size, which we boiled, and
found excellent eating; we did not find a single oyster; we did
not see any kangaroos, but heard numbers in the night, and found
numerous traces of them; we did not see any remarkable bird or
beast. Parts of the wreck of the Cumberland were scattered along
the whole coast. Shortly after we had rounded Cape Naturaliste,
we were led, as above-described, by the single native, to a
spring in a swamp, which had a very bad taste, and physiced all
our party; it had a milky brownish colour, and tasted just like
Thompson's mineral water at Cheltenham. From this spring to
within three miles of Port Leschenault we could not get a drop of
water. On reference to the chart, we have no doubt that this
spring is the mineral spring marked down in the chart just inside
of Cape Naturaliste.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>REPORT</strong> <i>of an Excursion
in a Whale Boat, from Six Miles to the Eastward of Ramé Point to
Six Miles to the N.W. of Point d'Entrecasteaux, and from thence
to the Murray River by Land.</i></p>
<p><i>Monday, April</i> 18<i>th</i>. 1831.&mdash;Moderate breezes
and hazy; daylight saw the land on the lee bow, which proved to
be Point Ramé. At 9, shortened sail and hoisted the whale boat
out&mdash;distance from land about six miles. At half-past 9,
having got every thing ready in the boat, left the ship and stood
in-shore; saw an appearance of an opening on the western bow;
kept close to the wind, but finding we could not fetch it, and
the object of my search being the westward, bore up with a very
heavy swell. At 11, rounded Ramé's Point and observed the black
rocks; kept close to the shore, and at 12 saw an appearance of an
opening about a mile to the westward of the inner point; stood
for it, the wind increasing much, with a considerable cross
swell, in two reefs. At half-past 12 rounded a point of land, and
found a large estuary, with an entrance that had ten feet water
on the bar in going in, with a sandy spit on the right hand and a
rocky shore on the left. The entrance is narrow, but certainly
good anchorage for small coasting vessels, not drawing more than
seven feet. In going in there is a rock close to the left shore
which always breaks, and which must be kept on the left hand.
Employed all the afternoon pulling round the estuary, which has a
small island in it; landed several times, and found the soil to
be generally good, particularly on a flat, which appeared to be
capable of producing any thing. Killed two swans, and met the
natives, who brought us some broiled fish, and conducted us to
their wells; parted very good friends; returned to the entrance,
and bivouaced opposite Sandy Spit.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Light breezes from the
eastward with every appearance of fine weather; being anxious to
take advantage of it breakfasted at 5 o'clock; our friends, the
natives, came down on Sandy Spit with lighted firebrands, making
signs for us to go over, which we did, as we had to complete our
water and wait for daylight to go through the passage. Sent Mr.
Skottowe with two men to the native well; in the mean time
Mitchel caught many small snappers, which highly delighted the
natives, particularly when they found they got the greater share.
At half-past 6 pulled out over the bar with a strong tide making
in, having eight feet water (low tide). At 7 rounded the south
point of the entrance, in passing between which and the black
rocks, observed many breakers; indeed, had the boat not been a
particularly lively one, I fear we should have felt the force of
them often. The ground between the South Point and Point Nuytz
appeared to be very uneven, from the constant small breakers we
saw and passed through, and it is impossible for any boat to land
there. At 8, fresh breezes and squally, in second reef, and
rounded Point Nuytz; observed an island close in shore, which is
not laid down in the charts. There is no safe landing between
Cape Nuytz and Cape Chatham, which we passed close at noon; after
which there are many little bays that a boat might find safe
landing in with ease; at 2, I observed a break in the land with
very heavy breakers; hauled in and saw water island over the
breakers, which had the appearance of an estuary. The weather not
looking very settled, and the shore holding cot but a poor
prospect for beaching the boat, bore up for the island off the
Point d'Entrecasteaux, in hopes of finding shelter under it for
the night; passed several patches of breakers seaward, and
observed the white topped rocks; light breezes, inclinable to
calm, with a heavy swell to the southward; lowered the sail and
got out the oars; at 4 saw an opening in the land about four
miles to the eastward of the island; stood for it; got close in
shore, having left some small breakers outside, and observed a
sheet of water over the sandy beach, which we afterwards found
was perfectly fresh, covered with swans, ducks, &amp;c., and
running with a rocky shore, and filled up with sand and sea weed;
there being too heavy a swell on the shore, rounded a small rocky
point to the westward, and landed with little surf, and bivouaced
on a low sand hill. Flat Island S.W. three miles and a half.
Point d'Entrecasteaux W. by S. ½ S. about seven or eight miles.
Heard the natives, and saw their fires about a mile up the
river.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 4 breakfasted, loaded the
boat, and waited for daylight to launch her; completed water, and
started at half-past 6, with a steady breeze from the eastward,
hoping to reach Augusta that evening. Passed many small reefs not
laid down, and an island off Point d'Entrecasteaux, which we
passed inside of, and a very good channel for small vessels, with
a fair wind.</p>
<p>It is my opinion there is good anchorage for coasting vessels
under Mat Island; indeed I should not have any hesitation in
running a vessel there for shelter not drawing more than seven or
eight feet water; but when it is well known, I have no doubt it
will be found safe for a vessel drawing twelve feet; at 8 rounded
Point d'Entrecasteaux, in first reef: half-past 8 breeze
increased, and hauled to the N.E. by N.; in second reef; 9, close
reefed, and at half-past 9, it blowing nearly a gale, took in
balance reef, the boat making as much water as we could bale. At
10, finding the boat complain very much forward, so as to make
much more water than we could bale, and at the same time going
off shore, lowered the sail down to pull in. Distance about two
miles, which took us three hours to do, the wind having increased
to a gale, with a very nasty short sea. At 1, finding we were
close, as I thought, to the beach, with a very heavy surf, and no
appearance of the weather moderating, pulled in, and to our utter
astonishment, found the breakers to extend nearly half a mile
from the shore, and certainly heavier than ever I saw a boat land
in; as it was now impossible to turn back with safety, kept the
boat directly before the breakers, which she went over very well,
until we came to an outer beach, where it broke with great fury,
and which the bow of the boat touched, and was all but turning
over with us; fortunately she floated before the second surf
came, and we got off with the boat being filled. I cannot help
remarking, that had not the men kept their places, and given way
when they were ordered, I fear there would not have been a chance
for one of us, the drawback being too strong for the most expert
swimmer. After the next breaker had passed and hove us
considerably nearer the shore, we jumped out, and succeeded in
holding the boat fast against the receding tide, and, in a short
time, as she became lighter, the surf hove her dry, so that we
got every thing safe on shore, but all perishable articles of
course ruined, amongst which was the present use bread, about
eighteen pounds; the remainder of the afternoon was taken up in
drying as many of our things as possible before night, and
removing for shelter under one of the small sandhills. 21st.
Calm; the surf if anything higher than when we landed; sent Mr.
Skottow with a man to Giene Point, to see if he could find any
place for a boat to land in, whilst I and Mitchel ascended the
range of Sand Hills, to try and obtain a view of the interior;
but the country immediately in the neighbourhood not having been
recently burnt, I could not get beyond the second range so as to
be back in time to launch the boat in the afternoon, should the
surf go down, although we were walking upwards of three hours
with a very hot sun and no water. At 1, returned to our bivouac;
Mr. Skottow arrived about half an hour afterwards, without having
found any place for a boat to land, but many fresh water springs.
A light sea breeze set in about half-past 12, when, in the
evening, the surf was certainly not so high; indeed we all lay
down with a full conviction that we should be able to launch the
boat in the morning, but our disappointment was very great when
day-light broke and presented a heavier surf than ever; indeed, I
am convinced it is impossible to launch a boat through the surf
witnessed during our stay here. Our provisions becoming short,
and it then blowing hard from the S.W., determined me on leaving
the boat, fad walking to Augusta, if the next morning brought no
hopes of getting the boat off; ordered the men to make the best
knapsacks they could, so as to be ready to march early if we
failed in getting the boat afloat; when we had nearly completed
packing, Mitchel saw a man on the beach about a mile distant;
with a glass made him out to be a native; took my gun and walked
towards him; after I had gone about half way, and he saw no other
person was following me, he advanced and seemed highly delighted
when I made him understand I wished him to go to the boat with
me, and he very readily gave me his three spears and throwing
stick, (which were certainly better made than any I had seen
before,) and carried my gun to the boat; he appeared astonished
when we made him understand that we came from sea through the
breakers. I have no doubt they had been watching us land, as
there were several fires dose to us. After dressing him, giving
him a stocking full of sugar, a little bread, and as much cloth
as he chose to carry away, of what we were about to leave behind,
and giving him to understand that he was to go and bring the
whole tribe, which he appeared perfectly to understand, he
departed, and we did not see him again. At noon succeeded in
launching the boat, and tracked her about a cable's length
opposite a small sandy hillock, where I intended bringing the
things; in so doing a heavy surf struck the boat, which knocked
Pike down, and went over him without doing him the least injury;
I never remember a man having a more narrow escape. We passed the
evening in great doubt about launching the boat, as it came on to
blow and to rain. 23rd. At 2, a.m. went on the shore, wind
blowing off strong, found the surf quite as bad as the evening
before; gave orders for breakfast, and to be ready to march in an
hour, breakfasted and at 3 20' started, all regretting the being
Obliged to leave the old whale boat behind, that had carried us
so many miles safe at different times; we took with us four
bottles of rum; one of wine; eight of water; four pounds of pork;
eighteen pounds of bread; two muskets; one gun, ammunition, an
axe; three blankets, and a spare flannel; shoes and stockings
each; the morning being very cold, and the beach good, we walked
quick until sun-rise, when we fell in with a river with the
entrance nearly closed with sand; drank some water, as we did not
know yhen we might have so good a chance again, and continued our
march, but with very indifferent marching; loose sand; we were
obliged to wait a few minutes every hour, not being accustomed to
a load on our backs; after leaving the river about two hours and
a half, we came to another with about two and a half feet at the
entrance and heavy surf, and a remarkable sand-hill on the left.
This river is certainly larger than the one we met with before,
if we are to judge from its discharge. Fearing we might not be so
fortunate as to meet with water again, rested for half an hour,
and boiled some tea, after which we walked until half-past 10,
when we rested for three hours; the sun being very oppressive on
a white sandy beach; gave the men a gill of mixed grog, they
being rather fatigued; at half-past 1 renewed our march, and
served out another gill of grog; at 4, observed the beach moist
above high water mark; dug with our hands about a foot deep, and
got beautiful water, which we stood much in need of; filled our
empty bottles and again started; walking until half-past 5, when
we came to a stop for the night, after walking twenty miles;
rather fatigued. Dug with our hands and got water, but very
brackish, which was used only for grog; gave each man a pint;
made a good fire; and all fell asleep, which remained unbroken
until 2 a.m., when we put on our knapsacks and recommenced our
march; after an hour's walking, we were checked in our progress
by a small rocky point jutting into the sea, which obliged us to
take to the bush, and this was no easy task, as it was not
daylight, and we had rather a difficult hill to climb;
notwithstanding, we kept the hills until break of day, when we
returned to the beach and came exactly opposite a river, which is
considerably larger than either of the two seen yesterday; we had
three feet and a half in crossing. Stopped for half an hour and
partook of tea, and again advanced, having many difficult rocky
points to pass, until 10 o'clock, when we rested for three hours.
Black Point, W.N.W. six or seven miles; gave the men half a pint
of mixed spirits, and at 1 p.m. the same, when we started and
ascended the high hills (there being no walking on the beach) to
Black Point. Steered from N.N.W. to N.W. by W. until 4, when we
were all very much in want of water, which induced me to steer
W., and at a quarter to 5, came to a native path, which took us
to the beach, and what we so much needed&mdash;a spring of water,
when I determined to stop, having walked two or three miles. We
saw Cape Leeuwin, which gave us great hopes of Augusta to-morrow.
Mr. Skottow and Seymour the carpenter, were very much fatigued,
besides, suffering from weak ancles and sore feet; we got some
good cocoa for supper, (25th.) which refreshed us all much; slept
sound, and at 2 o'clock breakfasted on cocoa; at half-past two,
the coast being still rocky to pass, ascended the high hill,
which we did with some difficulty, it being rather cloudy over
the moon, and the walking very bad; at daylight made the beach,
but was obliged to take to the hills again, the sand being soft,
and the surf washing up to the bank; continued to march until
noon, when we again took to the beach, and rested a quarter of an
hour to relieve Mr. Skottow's and Seymour's ancles; this man was
quite beaten. The last drop of rum, about a table-spoonful, was
served out, and the entrance of the river appearing-not more,
than seven or eight miles off, they both said they were
determined to reach Augusta that evening, which we succeeded in,
having divided their baggage, &amp;c. &amp;c. amongst three of
us. At 7, p.m., having walked since our rest full fifteen miles,
making this day's journey, at a moderate calculation,
thirty-three miles, we were some time on the banks of the
Blackwood; as I believe we were taken for convicts that had made
their escape, as soon as Capt. Molloy was informed of it, he came
over, and I cannot help mentioning the kind and hospitable manner
he received us; indeed, all the people were ready to supply our
wants. Sent Mr. Skottow with the men to the barracks. Seymour was
very unwell, but Mr. Green having seen, him, was better towards
the evening. Mr. Skottow and the other men were quite well, but
still fatigued; walked with Capt. Molloy to visit the different
settlers' habitations, and was astonished to find so much had
been done by the labouring classes in building their cottages and
clearing their grants, and they all appeared perfectly happy and
contented. Drew provisions from Capt. Molloy for the men.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Capt. Dance having mentioned
in my orders that he wished me to visit the harbour mentioned by
Capt. Molloy, near Turner's river, made arrangements for starting
the next morning HI Mr. Earl's boat.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;The wind being contrary for
the harbour, proceeded up to the head of the North Creek in the
boat, where we arrived at half-past 8; from this place,
accompanied by Capt. Molloy, Messrs. M'Leod and Bussel, I walked
along Mr. Turner's path until we arrived at the foot of the
hills, a distance of three miles and a quarter over a country
thickly wooded, and the soil particularly good; crossed the same
hillocks, and, at half-past 10, arrived at Turner's river, which
is a small deep stream running into the sea, and, I should
imagine, takes a northerly direction, after passing the hills;
saw part of the Cumberland's wreck. At 11, arrived at the bay,
which appeared to be well sheltered from all winds for a coasting
vessel; indeed, should the entrance be found good, I think the
Sulphur might lay there with perfect safety; at noon we returned,
having had an interview with two natives, who were friendly, but
suspicious; and at 6 p.m. arrived at Augusta. In crossing the
hills alluded to above, we passed over several patches of land of
excellent quality.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Having determined to leave
Augusta to-morrow, employed preparing. Mr. Skottow, who had been
unwell for the lost two days, and Seymour, having sufficiently
recovered to undertake the journey.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left our kind friends at
Augusta, and proceeded up the Blackwood in Mr. Earl's boat, who
had shewn at all times a readiness to lend it, accompanied by
Lieut. M'Leod, Mr. Bussel, soldiers, and my own party, now
increased to eight by the addition, of two labouring, men, who
had the permission of Capt. Molloy to proceed to Swan river oh
their private business. Lieut M'Leod and Mr. Bussel intending to
go with us as far as Fort Leschenault. Saw plenty of swans and
ducks, but too wild to approach; landed several times, and always
on good soil; indeed, the settlers at this place seemed perfectly
satisfied with the grants they had chosen. The river at sunset
getting narrow and rocky, landed for the night, had a merry
party, and embarked at dawn of day.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Arrived at the head of the
navigation at half-past 8 a.m.; breakfasted, and at half-past 9,
having packed up and completed our water from the river, which
was perfectly fresh, commenced our journey, steering N.N.E.;
nothing to the eastward until 12, when we rested for an hour,
having crossed two deep water courses and over very fair land of
red loam, passing fine forest trees, and frequently good patches
of grass; the country pretty level. Served out half a pint of
grog and a piece of bread to each person; at 1, started again and
walked till 6 p.m., having met with no water. Gave each person
half a pint of tea and half a pint of mixed grog, the whole party
suffering much from thirst during the night.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;The country being thickly wooded,
besides a quantity of fallen trees, made it unsafe travelling
until daylight, when we recommenced our march, having given all
hands a gill of mixed grog. The soil in many places of a more
sandy nature than passed over yesterday, with a few patches of
small iron-stone here and there; in passing through the thick
brushwood we were all glad to get the dew from the leaves to
quench our thirst, from which many of us were suffering severely;
passed several swamps, but could not get water before half-past
8, when I halted at a swamp that had recently had water in it, to
endeavour to procure some, but I fear our exertions would have
availed little, had not one of the dogs found an old native well,
which we cleared out and got nearly a gallon of water from: made
a fire and boiled some tea, serving out half a pint a man, which
refreshed us much; At half-past 9, recommenced our journey, and
an hour's walking brought us to another native well, where,
remaining a short time to refresh, after filling our canteens, we
again, started, walking through a country much more irregular;
Ted sand and iron-stony; thickly covered with fine forest trees.
Supposing from the distance we had walked and Capt. Molloy's
chart of the Blackwood, that we must be near Port Vasse, climbed
a tree and saw the land about Cape Naturaliste bearing N.W. and a
very extensive plain below, with a large sheet of water, bearing
N. about nine or ten miles; altered the course to N.; the land
became very good, and continued so until we halted at 5 p.m.
Distance walked eight miles. We saw many large kangaroos on the
plain, and passed through three dry watercourses, one of which we
bivouaced in; served out the same quantity of liquid as
yesterday, and we were less thirsty in consequence of having met
with water during the day. Young Mr. Bussel being so fatigued as
not to be able to proceed, I recommended Mr. M'Leod not to
accompany us any farther after we found fresh water, which he
quite coincided in.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Commenced our journey at daybreak
without any breakfast; after walking about half an hour came to a
small river running to the northward; stepped to breakfast. After
crossing the river and wishing Mr. M'Leod and his party adieu,
steered N.W. by N.; expecting shortly to see the estuary at
Vasse, which we did after walking two miles said a half. The
country passed over since starting this morning was beautiful,
much resembling a fine park in England, with excellent timber,
five or six to an acre. It is my opinion that the plain crossed
yesterday afternoon and this morning is a continuation of Henty's
Plains. Making the estuary gave us all fresh spirits, and we
commenced our journey along its banks at a good rate, walking
until half-past three, having crossed two rivers since leaving
the last, and passing over some superior land. Had an interview
with seven natives, who appeared to remember me well; they seemed
less friendly than when I saw them last; knowing them to be
numerous, and the men wishing to walk for a day on the beach,
their feet being lacerated, after rounding the estuary, steered
for it, and halted at half-past 3; men very tired; found fresh
water by scratching in the sand on the beach.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Breakfasted, and started at 4
a.m. in great hopes of reaching Port Leschenault in the evening;
walked two hours on the beach, and were then obliged to turn
inland, in consequence of the sand being so very soft. Steering
about a point from the sea, for the purpose of ascertaining the
nature of the country, which repaid us, as the country was good,
and certainly, in my opinion, passed the <i>finest land</i> I had
yet seen in the colony. Settlers near this country can never want
hay and food for their stock; I should say, that, on a moderate
calculation, this description of country extended for more than
twenty miles round. The grass was thick, from three to four feet
high. A farming-man from Augusta, named Jenkins, giving his
opinion, said, "he had never seen better in his life, and indeed
he passed very little bad land since he left the Blackwood."
Alter crossing the plain the land was of a more sandy nature,
with fine forest trees; we walked about four miles, passing many
fresh-water pools, and thinking we were not far from Casuarina
Point, made for the beach, and then found it was six miles off;
had we kept the native path after leaving the plain, from the
direction it took, I feel convinced we must have been at the
Preston long ere we reached Casuarina Point. It was a sad
disappointment to all; at half-past 8, we arrived at the old
place of bivouac much fatigued; being badly off for firewood,
suffered a good deal from cold.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Caught some cat fish, of which we
made a hearty meal; started for the crossing on the Preston,
where I intended to have bivouaced, leaving Mr. Skottow to
follow, after they had caught some fish, which they did, and
joined us at 4; we killed four ducks, of which, with the fish, we
made a hearty meal, before having lived principally on bread; the
water was not quite fresh where we rested, therefore we had to
send half a mile further up, for what we required for drinking.
Washed clothes. About 10, p.m., when we were all fast asleep, it
came on to rain very hard, so much so, that we were obliged to
sit up, and cover ourselves with our four blankets, by putting a
stick in the centre of each; it continued raining until nearly
daylight, when we got our breakfast. At 9, filled our canteens
and started for the Collie, keeping along the banks of the
Preston, in hopes of increasing our stock of birds. Noon, arrived
at the mouth of the Collie; commenced crossing the bar, but, to
my great surprise, on both sides of the island, we bad nearly
four feet water. After crossing, gave the men half allowance of
grog; walked along the banks of the estuary, in a native path,
until ¼ to 2, when we halted, as there was every appearance of
heavy rain, and our remaining stock of bread being anally it made
us anxious to Keep it dry,&mdash;besides, the men were very much
fatigued. We were fortunate enough to kindle a good fire before
the rain came on, which was ft great comfort, drenched as we all
were, and we slept sound, although the ground was very wet under
us.</p>
<p>Wishing to start early, breakfasted at half past 3 and at half
past 4 started; the morning cold, and the brushwood very wet;
kept the native path, and at day light saw the natives a-head,
six of whom soon joined our party, and were quite delighted when
they recognised two of the men and myself; they gave me to
understand I came there in a boat pulling, which was the case the
second time. I saw them; they continued increasing in number, and
constantly asked me for Mr. M'Leod and Dr. Simmons, by names they
had been accustomed to call them; the latter appeared the
favorite. After walking about half an hour, we passed a small
point, where their fires were lighted, and I saw two women, of
winch I told the natives, which pleased them very much,
particularly when they saw we did not go towards them. About ten
minutes afterwards, one of them came to me, making signs for me
to stop, which we did, after a great deal of pressing, and then
gave me to understand they would take me to see the women, but to
leave my men behind.</p>
<p>When they saw I understood them, and that our party had set
down, they were perfectly satisfied, and took me about fifty
yards, when I found I was amongst the women and children,
amounting in number to fifty or sixty, and some fair looking, and
others horrible to behold. The children were in general the
finest I had seen, and appeared to be well fed; I gave them
necklaces and rings, which pleased them for the moment; after
remaining about a quarter of an hour, we wished our <i>fair
friends</i> good bye, and proceeded on our march, and to our
surprise were soon joined by all the men and boys, with fishing
spears, the women and small children being in the rear. After
walking about two miles, and the men were satisfied the women
were safe, they commenced fishing, and were particularly
successful: we stopped for about ten minutes, when the natives
were greatly alarmed by a greyhound I had, chasing their dogs
into the midst of the women, knocking many of the children down;
but on my calling her, she returned, which again put them in good
humour. They continued with us, until we were obliged to leave
the estuary, which they seemed to regret; giving us to
understand, if we would remain, they would bring the women, and
get us some fish, which I did not comply with, as I was short of
provisions, with no protect of getting more before reaching the
Murray; eight of them, therefore, accompanied us upwards of an
hour, when they departed: crossed a large swamp, and gradually
ascended a well timbered country; soil, a sandy loam, with
patches of ironstone.</p>
<p>After steering N. about six miles, we came to a large lagoon,
when we found a fresh water spring, which induced me to halt for
the night; saw many traces of emu and kangaroo. The next morning
we started half an hour before day-light, and walked on the banks
of the lagoon, crossing the points projecting now and then, when
we came to some beautiful black mould. Noon, reached the head of
the lagoon, having walked about fourteen miles and a half; rested
an hour, and continued our march, steering N. by E. one mile,
over a rocky lime-stone country, with black sandy soil, when we
came to two other small lagoons in succession. The walking being
very bad, we steered towards the shore, and in an hour came to
another lagoon, which I knew to be only twelve miles from the
Murray, in a straight line: the men being greatly reduced from
want of water and food, we bivouaced, and divided a very scanty
allowance to each, the first we had this day; dug a well under a
tree, and got water, but very brackish.</p>
<p>Started at day light, and having served out half an ounce of
biscuit, and about a pint of tea, halting about a quarter of a
pound of bread remaining. The men complained much of their feet,
and thinking they would walk much better on the beach; I steered
for Cape Bouvard, and at 11, ascended the sand hill at the back,
and found we were all right as to portion; observed a bark
standing in shore, made a fire as a signal to her, but, to our
annoyance, she backed immediately. After testing for a few
minutes, and serving out our last mouthful of bread, made the
beach, where was tolerable walking, but which I am sure
lengthened our march four miles; however, the prospect of
reaching the Murray that night, gave the men fresh strength, and
we marched without a check, until we arrived in sight of the
entrance, where Mitchel Was taken very ill, from drinking (as he
said) the brackish water, but I think it was walking so very fast
and long without food; I sent Mr. Skottow on to hail for a boat;
after remaining half an hour, Mitchel was able to walk to the
boat, end when we got him over, I had him put to bed, and before
night he was much better. Mr. Erskine was all kindness, and gave
us all we wanted.</p>

<p>The hills passed over on the sea coast, afforded good pasture
for sheep, particularly between the Murray and Port

<h3>XVI.</h3>
<p class="negindent3"><strong>ACCOUNT</strong> <i>of an Excursion
to the North of King George's Sound, between the 26th of April,
and the 4th of May, 1831, by Al.[exander] Collie,
Surgeon.</i></p>
<p>I departed, early on the 27th of April, from the settlement,
by boat, with three attendants, Mokare, and two privates of the
63d regiment. On reaching the entrance of Oyster Harbour, the
tide being very low, I spent some time in sounding the bar, which
I found I could cross in not less than two fathoms; and I think I
am quite safe in stating this to be the most water there is at
the same height of tide. Inside the bar, in the narrowest part of
the entrance, I could not help remarking the facilities presented
by nature, for repairing vessels, and for loading and unloading,
by the great depth of water, (three to five fathoms) within from
five to seven fathoms of the sandy and rocky beach on the right
hand going in. It is at this spot that wells have been dug, and
vessels watered. These wells are close to the beach, and although
partly filled up at present, and much overshadowed by vegetation,
they contain good water; not, however, in such abundance as to
overflow.</p>
<p>In directing my course to French River, for which the natives
have two names, Ya-mung-up, and Hal-gan-up, and the mouth of
which lies on the northward part of Oyster Harbour, in a line
with Mount Clarence and Bayonet Head, I was obliged to keep well
to the norths on account of the extensive and very shallow flats,
which prevent a boat approaching, it in any thing like a direct
course, from the middle of the harbour. By making a considerable
detour, a channel can be followed of sufficient width for boats,
and about eight feet deep, into the river, where the depth is
also adequate to boat navigation.</p>
<p>In ascending the river, the channel lies in a northerly
direction, with moderate windings to the east and west, for about
two miles and a half, its breadth varying from two hundred to
fifty yards, and altogether narrowing, as the distance from the
mouth increases. In three or four places, it is contracted still
more by the rocky islets, either destitute of or covered with
trees. The banks are generally shelving, with a few flats
occasionally intervening, but they did not appear to have much to
recommend them, and two or three small creeks, which I observed
to run back, were, by Mokare's account, salt.</p>
<p>The mahogany and red gum, of Perth, (the tyarreil and marré of
the natives here) are predominant, and clothe, but in little
stateliness, the low and the rising banks. At the distance I have
mentioned, (two miles and a half) a streamlet of fresh water
joins from the S.W., flowing, as I afterwards ascertained,
between two heights of unequal elevation. The lowest one, which
is on the N.W. side, is of very excellent soil, (about fifty
acres) covered with thick, but at present, dried up grass, and
very slightly wooded with red gum. The most elevated on the S.E.
side, is of tolerable soil, (about 100 acres) a gravelly light
brown loam, rather thinly wooded with the same species.</p>
<p>The direction of the river, ascending from this place, is, on
the whole, N.E. easterly, making considerable and rapid windings
for about two miles and a quarter, although the direct distance
cannot be more than one mile and a quarter, to the farthest part
a boat can go. The breadth diminishes a little, and the channel
is almost blocked up in several places, by small islands, and
rocks under water.</p>
<p>The former aspect of the banks continues, except on the left,
(the right hand going up) nearly half a mile beyond the fresh
streamlet already mentioned, where there is a very pleasing and
gentle declivity, thickly covered with dried kangaroo grass, some
green wattle (the broomlike), and distant (by distant, I mean
eight yards apart) trees of good size, of red gum. It is needless
to tell those conversant with this colony, that the soil
producing such vegetation, is of the best description. It extends
350 yards from the river, and about 700 along it.</p>
<p>Fresh streamlets become more frequent, but the liver itself
continues, at present, brackish, to the stopping place.</p>
<p>The stoppage is occasioned by the bed of the river being
elevated by rocks, over which the water flows, in a small and
rapid stream. A few yards farther on, the channel is again
capacious,&mdash;the water deep,&mdash;and continues in this
state, occasionally obstructed by fallen trees, for nearly a
mile, when a like impediment to the former presents itself; and,
although it is of short space, and the river widens and deepens
above it, I consider all hope of rendering the navigation farther
up available, to be finally destroyed, by a third and longer
similar stoppage to the two first, about half a mile beyond the
second.</p>
<p>Leaving the boat, and also the river, at the first of these
obstacles, I took a direction N.E., which led me on the eastern
side of the river, and almost immediately within sight of its
bed. At the distance of three-quarters of a mile, I crossed a
tolerable sized stream running to my left, consequently to join
French River; it seemed well adapted for driving mills.</p>
<p>After proceeding N.E. six miles and three quarters, the course
was changed to N. ½ W. for a mile, then to N.W. by W. for half a
mile farther, down a hollow, to obtain water and stop for the
night. This hollow appeared to descend to the bed of French
River, the outline of which could be traced at a short distance
to the N.W. From an adjoining elevation, the eastern of two
conspicuous hummocks of Porrangur-up, bore N.W. ½ W., and the
eastern, apparently highest shoulder of the same mountain, N. W.
½ N. The surface walked over is slightly uneven; the elevated
portions, which constitute five-sixths, are either sandy or
stony, producing a tolerably close covering of low shrubs, and a
rather thick wooding of mahogany and casuarina (she oak?) trees,
the former of small size, and both much decayed and fallen; the
depressed portions are a mixture of black sod and sand, in
various proportions; swampy in the rainy season, producing no
trees, a shrubby melalencat, a rushy vegatation, which will
pasture cattle, but which is void of the soft succulency of good
grass. The rock which protrudes, and, by its fragments, forms a
general covering, in many places is of a clayey nature, of
considerable hardness, produced by exposure, and increased,
perhaps, by the fires, with which the natives seem to have
repeatedly consumed the vegetable productions. It seemed to
penetrate the ground to a very small depth, and it never forms
large blocks.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 28th, I followed a north course for a
mile, then a N.N.E. one for one-fifth of a mile, when, being on a
declivity, inclining downwards to the west, I could trace the bed
of French River at its foot, a very short way off, following
apparently a S.W. by W. direction, for three miles, and
afterwards a S. by W. one for a mile or farther. I continued
N.E., E. and N.E., skirting the river, for a mile and a half, in
the gently inclining slope, at first varied with sandy
elevations, and rushy hollows, which appear to have been partly
covered with water in the rainy season, and in some of which
there are the dry channels of winter streamlets; then uniformly
on a soil diversified with brownish gravel and good dark coloured
earth, that has produced a very fine crop of grass now withered
and beaten down. Granite, which is the prevailing rock, where the
soil is good, is sometimes exposed, either in solid or bare
blocks, or in fragments, so as to render the surface stoney, but
not to prevent a tolerable covering of grass. The extent of
grassy land is about three quarters by half a mile wide, and the
marré (red gum) trees being distant from each other, and also
tall, open an agreeable prospect to the view.</p>
<p>After this, I went N.E. by N. half a mile, leaving the river,
then N. by W. and N.W. by W. one mile over a sandy soil, with
many stones of a hardened clayey nature already mentioned,
producing some good sized mahogany trees, several stunted shrubs,
to a stream, either a branch or the main body of the French
River, small where a current existed, but wide where none was
perceptible. The place is called Kâl-um-up by Mokare. According
to him there is good ground to the N.E. three miles off, but
without water in its vicinity, and his vague idea of distance
decided my not going to look for it. My line of route now lay N.
for one mile, and N. by E. for two more, the ground being
slightly varied with ascents and descents, and shewing very
little good soil; afterwards a mile and three quarters N.N.E. and
half a mile N. to a river which Mokare called French River, but
which could only be a branch of it, unless he was mistaken in
what we afterwards followed, and what he called the main channel.
Half a mile before coming to this branch, I emerged for the first
time from a wooded country, and enjoyed a view for several miles,
W. N. and E. over slightly elevated plains, clear of trees;
leaving this, and for the last quarter of a mile, I traversed a
gentle acclivity, rising from the river on my right, unshaded by
a tree, and bearing the remains of a most luxuriant crop of
grass, and a few shrubs of green wattle. The soil is very good,
and only interrupted in a few spots by the protruding granite.
The native name of the ground is Noor-ru-bup. As the party
stopped here for the night, the examination in detail of this
spot occupied me till dark. (A rough sketch may assist in giving
an idea of it: <i>see</i> Fig. 1 <i>on the Plate</i> [below].)</p>

<br>Figure 1, (page 137) [from the main map.]</p>
<p>(A) is my tract of arrival at (B) our bivouac 5 (R) is the
river, the bed of which was dry at the places where the tracts of
examination (EE), and of departure (C) cross it. The magnetic
North is indicated by the arrow point, and the distance between
the lower and upper crossing places is about a mile and a
quarter. The grassy and good soil, already mentioned as partly
passed over, is contained between the faint line (<i>d</i>) and
the river. The slope on the east side of it is sufficiently
gentle for agricultural purposes, and it is a good brown gravelly
soil, producing, however, but little grass. To the eastward of my
tract the surface becomes stoney, being strewed in a great
measure with ragged fragments of an apparently recent siliceous
formation, and ornamented with a whitish silvery-looking shrub
(an endesmia?). The few trees which grow on this slope are
similar in general appearance to the flooded gum of the Avon,
although in reality different. The same species grows on the
river banks, where is also found the same tree, which is by some
called the flooded gum at Perth; the native name of the latter is
moit, and of the former yeit.</p>
<p>On the 29<i>th April</i>, a north course for a mile and a
quarter carried me over tolerably clear and very strong ground,
to a ravine close on my left, and to a slightly excavated hollow
in front, which I traversed for one-third of a mile, among dried
kangaroo grass, on a good soil, unencumbered with trees or
shrubs. It descends to the S.W., becoming slightly wooded, and
looking very good, apparently, for a mile in that direction,
maintaining a general appearance in breadth of about half a mile.
I altered my course to the N. by W. for two miles and a half,
during which the surface was nearly level, the soil a gravelly
light loam, and the productions shrubby; when I had an
unobstructed view almost on every point of the compass from a
moderately raised eminence, and I availed myself of the
opportunity to take the following bearings.</p>

<p>These mountains, from Maggerip to Rugged Mountain (by the
natives, Koi Kyeunu-ruff) inclusive, are very remarkable, by
their rising far elevated above a continuous grouping of moderate
hills which surround their bases. They all appeared destitute of
trees, but were covered, especially the lower, in a mantling of
green, and the country intervening between me and them presented
no forest timber to my view. In a direction N.W. by W. ½ W. a
valley, or rather a plain, on a lower level than either side,
stretched to the distant horizon, as if the smooth sphericity of
that part of the globe had not been interrupted. This is the very
slightly sloping valley of French River, partly bare and partly
covered with trees; whereas to the south of it, the wavy surface
that slowly rises to the northern foot of Porrong-u-rup is
generally clothed in arboreous foliage. The clear country I had
passed over this morning strongly suggested a succession of
similar soil, from its continuance in the same direction, and
Mokare strengthened this idea by his declaration that it was well
founded. His addition, too, that no water was to be found to the
N.E. or N., and the hopeful prospect to the N.W., finished by
determining me to direct my steps to the more inviting vale of
Kâlgan (French River). I walked along this vale, or low plain, on
a clayey loam, dry at that time, but bearing the marks of a
winter marsh, that had produced a short and thin grass with a few
shrubs. The white gums, for the first time, shewed themselves,
affording a slight skirting on the gentle elevation of the
northern side, and, as I advanced, demonstrated to a distance in
front, by their thicker array, the situation and course of the
river, on the banks of which I arrived, after a walk of two miles
and three quarters from the station of the preceding bearings. At
this spot, which. Mokare calls Kamballup, I was a little
astonished to see the water in the channel about sixty yards
wide, but, on proceeding a few minutes upwards to its source, I
was as much surprised to see neither water nor channel, for the
latter had been filled with tall shrubs, now burnt, without any
well defined banks. I went on for a mile and a half N.N.W., and
then for a mile and three quarters nearly west, over a very
indifferent soil, gravelly and sandy, with, however, a few
interruptions of good, and came to the channel of the river,
where the water stood in small and exceedingly brackish ponds. A
little further on there was abundance of drinkable, although
still brackish water in the channel.</p>
<p>I kept on the left (north) bank, and passed over, west, a fine
gently swelling rise of gravelly but good soil, enhanced to the
eye by tall and distant white gums, for one-third of a mile, to
another bend of the river, which still leaving to my left, I
walked about W.N.W. for two miles and a half, over either a sandy
or gravelly surface, bearing shrubs, in many parts burnt, and
came again to the bed of the river where we first found a small
and brackish pond, but immediately afterwards a large and
tolerably fresh one. The party stopt here for the night, and
whilst the evening meal was preparing I went to one of the
highest eminences in the plain, three-quarters of a mile north;
and as it was only covered with a few grass trees and low shrubs,
my view was unconfined. The following bearings, with all the
inaccuracies of a pocket compass, will assist in conveying a
notion of the surrounding country:</p>

<p>Kowr-u-larrup seemed nearer than Porrong-u-rup, so that the
width of the valley, or rather plain, between the smaller range
of Porrong-u-rup on the south and the grand range on the north,
may be something near sixteen miles. The N.W. part of this plain
resumes, in many parts, the arboreous covering, the general
feature of this portion of Australia.</p>
<p>On the higher elevations the rock formation continues of the
description already mentioned, the claystone partaking of a more
or less ferruginous nature, and agglomerating with fragments of
quartz, feldspar, and granite, which, although not particularly
detailed hitherto, have been generally common. The lower
eminences, however, often exposed a perpendicular, and still more
frequently an excavated front of a fine and friable clayey
sandstone, of a cream colour, fine, granular, and almost too
little tenacious to be unreservedly recommended for building.</p>
<p>On the 30<i>th April</i> I ascended (if ascent it be entitled
to) the right bank of the river W. ½ N. three quarters of a mile,
then W. ½ S. and W. over one mile and three quarters of a good
grassy inclined plain, ornamented with white gum; afterwards over
a sandy and gravelly soil and height for one quarter; and then
over, first, a plain of sandy soil, and white gum and yeit trees;
secondly, a moderate elevation of sandy soil and shrub; and
lastly, across a lower level of good soil, white gum, wattle and
grass near the river, which, in its windings, opportunely crossed
our path.</p>
<p>On the last-mentioned piece of good soil, Mokare detected and
pointed out to me the footsteps of homed cattle and of a horse;
they were not recent, but sufficiently evident to show that they
bore the form attributed to them; and as a further confirmation,
Mokare had previously told me that two bullocks and a horse had
been near this some months ago, and seen by the natives, who
informed him.</p>
<p>We crossed the channel and proceeded W. ½ N. one mile, and
W.S.W. one mile and a half, through a generally open forest
country, good towards we hollows, gravelly on the heights, but on
both grassy, although on the latter the grass was thin, and on
both much dried; to the river again, at a place called
Moor-illup, much frequented by the natives of King George's Sound
and Will tribe, and apparently quite as much by the natives of
the two elements of earth and air. Here Mokare expected to find
some of his neighbours, the Wills, whose place of resort this, he
gave me to understand, is in a more especial manner, and from
whom he expected further information respecting the cattle.</p>
<p>Not only at Moor-illup, but at every pond of the river where
we stopped, the traces of man, beast, and bird, are strongly
marked; and the great numbers of kangaroo, and several emu, not
to mention a fair proportion of ducks, cockatoos, pigeons,
&amp;c. seen daily at this place, shew that both the hunter and
sportsman would find abundant amusement, and the settler no
slight acquisition to his larder. I ascended a very gentle
elevation three-quarters of a mile W. from the ponds of
Moor-illup, covered so thickly with white gums that I could not
obtain any distant view (except a continued uniformity of country
to the westward.) Its surface northward is gravelly and stoney,
but on the south inclination, which is tolerably open, the soil
at the bottom is good, and a hollow, not very wide beyond it, is
filled with long grass and still green small rushes, affording
even now tolerable feed. The river seems to run over this in the
winter time, but I found no water above the ponds last mentioned,
and Mokare maintained there was none.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;I commenced S.E. by S. and soon
passed up a moderately inclined plane, that has nothing to
recommend it; and after two miles and a half I walked along a
broad belt of good soil for one mile. Fire had recently gone over
its surface, and left only enough of wattle shrub to show that
this had been the chief production; it has a gentle inclination,
and is free from trees. The next two miles and a half was through
mahogany trees, young and old; and over a very stony surface
descending to the south, and a similar plain at its foot. I then
altered our course to the W.S.W. for the hill of Yakkerlip,
leaving a rich, low, grassy, and clear level space on my left,
where the kangaroos shewed themselves in small herds. Walking
about three miles in this direction, I passed over a brown and
gravelly country, much encumbered with small mahogany trees and
shrubs, with but little tolerable soil in the hollows, and came
to a channel leading from Yakkerlip to the N. and N.E. to join
French River. Here was one large pond; it was otherwise dry for a
very considerable distance.</p>
<p>Several eminences are comprised in the name of Yakkerlip, the
highest of which I ascended S.E. by E. three-quarters of a mile,
over a light brown and gravelly soil, as we advanced clear of
trees, and producing some good grass, and took the following
bearings:</p>

<p>In descending the south side of the hill I found the slope
rapid but the soil good, and the verdure fresh and succulent,
sheltered, in addition to its aspect, by tall and straight red
gums. As we approached the bottom, and after crossing a romantic
ravine, on the sides of which the red gum excels any thing in the
neighbourhood of King George's Sound, stunted mahogany trees and
thick mahogany shrub succeeded, on a very stony surface, composed
of small fragments of agglomerated lumps of clay, iron-stone,
quartz, feldspar, &amp;c., held together by a clayey ferruginous,
friable sandstone, differing only by a greater proportion of
ferruginous matter from what I described on the afternoon of the
29th.</p>
<p>Continuing about S. by E. we passed a deep channel, at which
Mokare seemed astonished, being dry, and came upon a slightly
hollowed surface, where water seems to stand part of the year,
but we could find none, not even in a reedy swamp, except far
down, in narrow deep holes dug by the natives. Mokare therefore
conducted us S.W. for three-quarters of a mile, to a good sized
and commodious well (native), one-sixth of a mile east of which I
took the few following bearings, my view being very confined.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May my course was about S.S.E. ½ E. for four
miles and a half, to a reedy swamp covered with water, then S.E.
for five miles, when ive came to the channel of a considerable
stream, and followed its bank of tolerable soil for some
distance, now only containing water in ponds. Mokare said the
name of the ground was Yarren-yung-rip. In continuing about S.E.
by E., varying however occasionally, and having crossed from the
led to the right bank of this channel, I passed two dry channels
descending to the north, and alter three miles farther march,
came on the bed of the stream that I had left, and which I
skirted on the right bank, first in the same direction and then
inclining more to the eastward, for two miles more, daring which
the banks became high, rather steep, and the surface very stony
(claystone). The eastern of the two middle hummocks of
Porrong-u-rup bore N., and there was now an actual stream in the
channel. I descended to a small meadow, of good soil, to bivouac,
along with a party of natives that had accompanied us for the
last few miles, and which were the first natives we met with.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 3<i>d</i>.&mdash;My course was S.E. for four miles
and a half to a small stream running to our right, and at a very
short distance into French River; and then S.S.E. a mile to the
same river, immediately above where we had left the boat. The
ground walked over is in general gravelly and sandy, with much
mahogany shrub, mahogany and casuarina trees.</p>
<p>In returning down the French River from the boat stoppage, a
few hundred yards W. by S. brought me upon a slope of good grassy
land, about 100 acres, moderately wooded with red gum. From this
to the fresh water streamlet (one mile and a quarter), the banks
of which I described on the 27th, I found nothing eligible for
the farmer; and I was scarcely more fortunate in proceeding about
S. by W. to the bottom of Oyster Harbour, at some distance from
the river, the greater part of the way a line of eminences
intervening between us. Threes-quarters of a mile before arriving
at the harbour we came upon a stream of water flowing through a
swampy and shrubby hollow, that affords a rough but green
pasturage, even at present, and in which the stream is lost
before it reaches the salt water.</p>
<p>Whilst dinner was preparing, and until the shutting in of the
day, too short at this season of the year for exploring, I
examined the height and banks on the right of French River
nearest its mouth, and found them either alight gravelly loam, or
very sandy, producing mahogany and casuarina trees, and an
useless shrub.</p>
<p>The party stopped on the channel last mentioned, but so near
its mouth that the water found in it was a continuance of the
salt water of the harbour; but a native who happened to be with
us procured fresh from some holes at a short distance.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;I crossed the moderate elevation
that lies to the westward of our bivouac, at a short distance
from the beach to the mouth of King River, and observed it to be
rocky, and wooded in a great proportion with red gum. A swampy
and boggy hollow separates it from the highest ground in the
vicinity, on the west and north of the embouchure of the King.
This hollow extends to some distance N.N.W., and contains fresh
feed, even at this period of the year. After observing the
considerable salt meadows on both sides of the lower part of the
King, on which there is an abundant produce of rushy and now
dried vegetation, that might have made tolerable fodder, I
proceeded up its northern or left bank in a westerly direction,
without following its windings, for three miles, to a crossing
place, by means of accidental tree bridges over two nearly equal
streams, which, by joining a few yards below, form the main
river. The ground thus passed over is chiefly sandy, with several
portions of a gravelly light brown loam, intersected with several
streamlets of fresh water. The trees are mostly mahogany, of
slender girth, with shrubs, and the surface is free of grass.</p>
<p>We breakfasted on the south side of the south branch, and
Mokare informed us that the ground was named Tan-num-bang-i-war.
A hundred yards further up there were numerous channels leading
to this branch, but all at about that; distance dry. The chief of
them seems to come from Willyung-up through a slightly excavated
valley, containing little shrub, and no trees larger than the
Kingia Australis, similar to the grass tree, which very
appropriately shades and adorns the head of its fraternal
river.</p>
<p>In returning from the head of the King in a tolerably direct
line to the settlement, I soon came to the same conspicuous
granite rocks, in a watery hollow, leaving a grassy and open
plain of about ten acres, and I should infer, good soil on our
right I also passed a hollow of tolerable soil N. by E. two miles
from Mount Melville, besides considerably rushy and green low
grounds, adapted to pasturing cattle, more advantageously perhaps
in the summer than winter, where they may be too swampy.</p>
<p>On the 17<i>th May</i> I had an opportunity of ascending King
River in a boat; towards its mouth it is shallow, and most so
about three-quarters of a mile up, where the natives generally
wade across. The least water we had was three feet at nearly high
water, but the rise and fall seemed to be very little. Above this
the depth is sufficient for boating; and the only obstructions
are, scattered rocks in two or three places narrowing the
channel, and making it intricate (but leaving sufficient water),
and fallen trees, which can easily be avoided, or might be
removed with facility, until the boat reaches the point of
division into twin branches, which I have mentioned to be close
to where the accidental tree bridges afford a passage across.
From the boat I observed no decided indications of rich soil nor
much pasture, except the salt meadows towards the mouth of the
river. The first fresh water creek that I noticed is on the right
bank, about two miles up (in a direct line), but fresh water
abounds in the plain between this river and Mount Clarence, and a
very short way farther up I found the river itself fresh.</p>
<p>The banks, a little way above the native's wading place,
presents an inclination and height well suited to a horse-path
for dragging boats; and for the purpose of landing and shipping
goods, the head of King River, at the foot of Willyung-up, will
afford the greatest convenience to the population of the
interior. .</p>
<p>On <i>June</i> 4<i>th</i>. I took advantage of a boat going to
Coffin Island to look for seals, mutton birds (sooty petrel,
procellaria fuliginosa), to obtain a conveyance thither. It is an
elliptical and rather low rocky island east of Mount Gardener;
about a quarter of a mile in its longest diameter, and about five
hundred yards from the main land. Its shores are everywhere
rocky; in many places inaccessible from the steepness, and in
almost all, from the continued lashing of the surge of the waves
which roll in from the ocean. The landing is attended with the
least difficulty a short way round the N.W. end, and on the north
aspect, but even here the surf is, at the best, considerable, and
often highly dangerous. The surface, a few yards removed from the
cliffs, is composed of a thin covering of light loam and mould,
producing the anthociras obovata, and another shrub, with a few
herbaceous plants, and affording a warren for sooty petrel,
penguin, lizards, &amp;c., which have riddled the ground with
their holes. That seals have come up and been killed in
considerable numbers at one time, is confirmed, in addition to
oral information, by the skeletons which still remain; but none
of the party saw any alive at this time, and there was only one
path traced by them in the shrubbery. The sealers were therefore
so far disappointed, but the profusion of petrel amply
compensated, as upwards of five hundred of these birds were
caught by three persons in less than three days.</p>
<p>The rock, which a protracted stay afforded me abundance of
time to survey, is granite of almost every variety of texture and
appearance. Still it seems different from the genuine granite of
the more anciently known world. An oxydulated iron ore and iron
pyrites are distributed through its mass ingrains, and found in
the veins in even larger portions, not, however, in sufficient
quantity to repay the miner.</p>
<p>Rock and other fish are plentiful, and several whales (black)
were observed at a short distance off.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;I ascended Mount Gardener,
although the weather was highly unfavourable for a distant view,
unwilling to detain the boat another day. The lower hills on the
foot of Mount Gardener are, like itself, destitute of large
timber, exposing a not unfrequently bare rock of granite, but for
the most part, a clothing of short shrubbery, and occasionally, a
dense thicket of taller brushwood. The soil is generally sandy,
and only in a few patches interrupted by brown loam, into one of
which, at the top of the mountain, I put some almond nuts. I had
previously sown several, and castor oil, and other seeds; and one
of the men had sown a variety of flower seeds on Coffin
Island.</p>
<p>On the lower part of the mountain, looking to Coffin Island,
and nearly in a line from the island to the Peak, the usual
calcareous formation of the S.W. coast makes its appearance,
rising seemingly in a vertical stratum of little thickness, to
the surface on the south margin of a deep ravine. The same
formation is also apparent a little N.E. of this, forming a
superficial recumbent incrustation.</p>
<p>Mount Gardener, under which is to be included the lower hills,
resting on the base of the most conspicuous, is joined to the
mainland by a low and level neck containing several lakes, the
nearest and apparently largest communicating by a winding channel
with the bay to the N. and N.E. It is said to be brackish.</p>
<p>This bay I endeavoured to examine on the 6th, but the weather
would not permit, and on the 7th, the whole party, tired of
bivouacing, and a little alarmed, perhaps, at the great risk our
boat ran of being stove the previous night, decided on attempting
to return to the settlement, which we accomplished after a very
tedious pull. From what I could see, however, of the bay referred
to, it is spacious, of sufficient depth of water, and sheltered,
unless for about seven or eight points of the compass, to the
eastward. A convenient boat harbour was described to be in its
S.W. side; and very material shelter would be afforded between
Coffin Island and Mount Gardener, if the dangers be not too great
under water. Mount Many-Peak, from Coffin Island, presents the
same appearance as Mount Gardener. Water, I am informed, runs
down its side in streams to the sea, and there is more than one
boat harbour at its bottom, but neither bay nor harbour for
shipping near it on the N.E.</p>
<p>On June 15th, I went to the south side of Princess Royal
Harbour, and was much satisfied to find limestone in two, if not
more, places, projecting in low cliffs on its shores, either
close to, or near, groves of trees, which will afford fuel for
some years. Lime has hitherto been almost entirely procured from
shells. The two large groves of trees adjoining the beach, one a
little S.E. of the remarkable sandy patch, and the other about a
mile and a half S.E. of this again (both denoted in the common
chart), stand in good soil resting on granite, and are composed
of large trees of red and blue gum, of reit, and a few mahogany.
A copious spring, formed into a convenient well, at the first
affords a constant current of excellent fresh water; and a
moderate sized and rather rapid stream, at the second, not only
presents the same advantage, but would turn several mills. They
are both to be approached by light boats, and even a deep one can
go within some fathoms of the first.</p>
<p>The plain of considerable extent, but varying in breadth
between the south side of the harbour and the sea-coast range of
hills, is, with little exception, destitute of large timber, but
thickly covered with small shrubs, rushes, or rather scirpi,
which make no despicable food for cattle, and possess the
advantage of being verdant and good, throughout the protracted
droughts of summer. The soil is very sandy, black loam and mould,
similar to that in the hollows at the settlement; very retentive
of water, and therefore, in the advanced months of winter,
marshy, although at present still dry. The hills are shrubby with
hollows of pasture.</p>
<p>The whole of this irregular tongue of land appears fitted by
nature for pasturing flocks and herds of cattle, on their first
importation, and one or two persons, at its western part or root,
could readily prevent straying. A fresh-water lake, about four
hundred yards from the S.E. extremity of the long sandy beach,
that runs from the point where Mistaken Island nearly joins the
mainland, round the western part of the sound, may, at some
future period, become highly advantageous as a watering place for
large ships and numerous fleets. Wood for fuel is, however, here
very thinly scattered.</p>
<p>The upper and northern part of the range of hills, looking to
the plain before mentioned, often exposes, particularly on the
slope, the peculiar calcareous formation of the S.W. coast, and
seemed, from a superficial examination, to afford a limestone as
well as the lower cliffs on the beach, freer from siliceous sand
than those in the vicinity of Swan River.</p>
<p>In the winter season, a marshy declivity, W.S.W. of Seal
Island, sends streamlets of fresh water to the beach, where an
American vessel once took in her water.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>LETTERS FROM MR. DALE,</strong>
<i>giving a summary description of the Country passed over in
going to Mount Bakewell, and, also, in an Expedition to examine
the Country to the North and South of that Place.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>Mount Bakewell, September</i> 19<i>th</i>.
1831.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
<span class="a">I beg</span> leave to report to you, for the
information of his Excellency, the arrival at Mount Bakewell of
the expedition which he was pleased to honor me with the
conducting of across the Darling Mountains.</p>
<p>In crossing the range, our progress at first was more slow
than was anticipated, in consequence of the heavy rains which for
the first three or four days retarded our movements; but the
weather having since become favourable, we were able to travel
more expeditiously, and the party arrived here on the morning of
the 16th, (the 11th day after our departure from Guildford) in
good health and spirits.</p>
<p>From the nature of the country, I was induced to alter in a
slight degree the line of direction which it was first proposed
to follow, and it was satisfactory to find that the course
pursued brought us directly to Mount Bakewell, the distance of
which was found by the measurement to be forty-two miles from
Green Mounts which nearly agrees with what I had previously
estimated it at. It is considered that the line which I have now
marked out, is favourable for a road, it having passed through
several fertile valleys where there was an abundant supply of
water, and over considerable tracts of level ground; the only
serious obstacle being a broad branch of the Helena, across which
we were obliged to throw a bridge.</p>
<p>Since my arrival here I have, in conjunction with Mr. Bland,
fixed upon a spot, which was considered most eligible for the
purpose required by his Excellency. The place chosen is nearly at
the distance of two miles south from the summit of Mount
Bakewell, while the high land approaches within a few hundred
yards of a broad and deep reach of the river. This spot was
selected after a careful examination of the ground adjacent to
the mount, as it appeared doubtful whether a constant supply of
water could be procured except in the river.</p>
<p>Having now refreshed our horses, I purpose to-morrow, in
compliance with the wishes of his Excellency, to proceed,
accompanied by Mr. Moore, to the southward, towards the source of
the Avon, which, when I shall have accomplished, I hope, on my
return to Mount Bakewell, to be able to trace that river the
desired distance to the northward.</p>
<div align="center">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am.

<p><i>To J.S. Roe, Esq.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveyor General, Perth</i>.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="right"><i>Perth, October</i> 14,
1831.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR,<br>
<br>
I have the honor to transmit to you, for the information of his
Excellency, the result of an expedition, which was undertaken by
his direction, on the 20th ultimo, for the purpose of examining
the country, to the extent of fifty miles to the north and south
of Mount Bakewell. As nothing of importance has been discovered,
that would render a journal sufficiently interesting, I shall
confine myself to a brief outline of our excursion, referring you
(should a more detailed account be required) to the notes which I
have kept on the occasion.</p>
<p>Having already communicated to you my observations on our
route as far as Mount Bakewell, I proceeded from thence on the
20th ultimo, accompanied by Messrs. Moore and Thompson, and one
soldier, to explore the country, according to my instructions,
for fifty miles to the S.S.E. towards the source of the Avon
River; in five miles, after having visited a singular cavern,
(alluded to on a former occasion,) we crossed to the opposite or
eastern side of that river, at a ford where it was about three
feet deep, and running in two channels to the north. The country
here was of an open forest character, being lightly timbered with
different varieties of the eycaliptus or nut tree, (which I have
previously described, and which abounds to the eastward of the
range,) resembling, in its growth, the apple, and in its scent,
the sandal wood; the casuarina, and several species of the
wattle. The soil on the low lands was a red loam and clay; on the
uplands and more elevated grounds, there was a sandy loam of a
hazel colour, in some places of an extremely friable nature, and
covered, generally, with a luxuriant vegetation. The same
description of country prevailed to the distance of twenty miles,
to the south of Mount Bakewell, when we crossed a vein of eight
or nine miles of hard and barren looking clay; the water, in the
course of the river, being brackish, and in some places salt. The
appearance of the soil, however, gradually improved, as we
approached the intended site of Ashbourne, and continued to
present the same character, till we bad penetrated as far as
sixty miles to the S.S.E. of Mount Bakewell, when we turned to
the westward for twelve miles, over an undulating grassy country;
and after crossing a large tributary stream, from the S.E., we
again fell in with the river, flowing to the north; it was at
this place, about twenty feet broad, and seemed to have its
source at a considerable distance to the southward.</p>
<p>During our progress down the left bank of the river, on our
return to Mount Bakewell, the aspect of the country was similar
to that which we had observed to the southward of Beverly; where,
as we had before noticed a singular interruption to the stream of
the river, we stopped to ascertain the cause, and found, upon
examination, that it was absorbed in a sandy bed, and had ceased
to flow, just above where the apparent channel was occupied by a
long pool of salt water. On finding this termination, our
attention was directed to what had previously been considered a
tributary stream, which joined what was supposed to be the main
branch, about eighteen miles from Mount Bakewell.</p>
<p>Having from this returned to the settlement at York, and
procured a fresh supply of provisions, we again proceeded to the
junction or the two branches of the Avon, and found the soil, for
15 miles up the right bank of the western one, in general of a
better quality than that on the corresponding space of the
eastern branch. The river here appeared to issue from springs in
the low grounds, but on ascending a hill we observed a
continuation of its valley among the Darling Range.</p>
<p>Its course having led us very much to the westward, our direct
route in returning was far back from its bank, and passed over a
sandy district to within eight or nine miles of Mount Bakewell,
when the country assumed its grassy and undulating character. On
the 3rd, after having allowed our horses sufficient rest, we left
the settlement to examine the country, according to my
instructions, for 50 miles to the N.W. This line for 18 miles
from Mount Bakewell, conducted us, at some distance from the
Avon, over a good pasture country, and afterwards for twelve
miles along its banks, when its valley became more contracted and
the hills more precipitous, though the soil still retained the
same character. The river here turning abruptly to the N.N.W., we
crossed it, and continued our line over a rocky country,
gradually rising into Table Land, and descended into a rich
valley; on proceeding one mile further, we came to an extensive
swamp, containing a large body of water, and having several marks
of cattle on its margin. From this swamp we traversed a sandy and
level plain, in which we observed numerous pools of fresh water;
it was bounded on the E. by high hills, which appeared to us to
be a continuation of the Darling Range; and on the W. by hills of
more moderate elevation.</p>
<p>Estimating our distance now to be fifty miles from Mount
Bakewell, we altered our course to due W., and passing over a
sandy district of fourteen miles, we arrived within sight of the
plain, which extends from the Darling Mountains to the sea coast,
between fifty and sixty miles to the N. of Perth.</p>
<p>Proceeding from this, in a southerly direction, along the base
of the range, we crossed several small streams issuing from
fertile-looking valleys, and at the distance of nine miles
arrived at a river, which, from its direction, and the body of
water it contained, seemed likely to be where the Avon discharges
itself upon the plain. Having ascended for four miles before we
could ford it, we found the soil on its banks rich, and the
vegetation luxuriant.</p>
<p>The remaining part of our excursion to Mr. Bull's, at the head
of the Swan, afforded nothing worthy of observation, with the
exception of a district of two miles in extent, and ten distant
from that place, where limestone shewed itself in many places on
the surface.</p>
<p align="center"><small>GENERAL REMARKS.</small></p>
<p>Having, upon two former and distinct occasions, given a
description of the soil and nature of the country to the eastward
of the Darling Range, little now remains to be observed upon.</p>
<p>The only singular feature we met with, being an inland lake of
fresh water, or perhaps a reservoir of the river, about 30 miles
to the S.S.E. of Mount Bakewell, it varied in its breadth from
sixty to seventy yards, and was five or six miles in length. Upon
this we saw an immense number of ducks, swans, and other water
fowl. We also found a small and beautiful animal, which appears
not to have been before discovered: its size was about that of a
squirrel, and its colour of a yellowish cast, with light and dark
shaded stripes across the hinder part of the back; its tongue was
very long in proportion to its body, for which reason we supposed
it was an Anteater.</p>
<p>It may also be worthy of remark, that numerous parties of
natives were seen, and in no instance was any molestation
offered, and in general they evinced a very friendly feeling.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><strong>Mr. DALE'S JOURNAL</strong> <i>of
an Expedition from King George's Sound to the Koikyennuruff Range
of Mountains</i>.</p>
<p align="right"><i>Albany, King George's
Sound,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
January</i> 29<i>th</i>.
1832.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> been requested by his Excellency
to proceed to a high hill named Toodyeverup, near the middle of
the Koikyennuruff range of mountains, to ascertain its nature,
and that of the adjacent country, and also, if possible, to find
out whether the Kuik * and Quannet, two kinds of grain described
by the natives of King George's Sound, as used by those of that
part of the country for food, grew in the vicinity of the range,
I left the settlement on the morning of the 21st inst,
accompanied by Mr. Clint, three soldiers, and Nakina, a native of
King George's Sound, and followed for the first six miles a
native path, which conducted us to a crossing place over a branch
of King's river of considerable size, on the eastern side of
Willy-ung-up. At half-past 11 o'clock, we reached, after meeting
with numerous small streamlets, the principal branch of that
river, which we forded at a spot where it was flowing to the
north-east, between closely wooded and steep banks, covered with
a scrubby vegetation. We halted here till half-past one, and on
resuming our journey, arrived, after walking four miles, at an
extensive swamp, which Nakina informed us was called "Trow". One
mile and a half beyond this, we bivouaced at a fine stream of
water running through deep pools to the eastward.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Several of the natives of King George's Sound
tribe describe these grains; the first, or Kuik, as growing on
the north and eastern foot of Koikyennuruff, and the latter, or
Quannet, to the N. east of Koikyennuruff, and also on the
northern base of Toodyeverup. None of them have seen these
grains, but they describe the stalks on which they grow as being
from six to eight feet, the size of one's finger, with protruding
long ears, which are pendant from a succession of joints. The
Kuik they say resembles our rice, and the Quannet grain is
compared to a large pea for size. Their account is that the White
Cockatoo Tribe, who inhabit the district, eat the Kuik raw, but
beat the Quannet tied up in their skins, bake it, and cook it in
the ashes, like a damper.]</p>
<p>The district we traversed to-day was very indifferent,
although some patches of good land and grass were observed. We
estimated that we had advanced twelve miles in a direct line from
the settlement; the actual distance we had walked being about
seventeen.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, we proceeded five miles, preserving a N. by E.
course, to a large lake with an island in the centre called
Morandee. As Nakina informed us that we should not find any water
till we reached the Kalgan or French river, distant about eleven
miles, we stopped here for two hours. From Morandee we proceeded
over hills of moderate elevation, ascending gradually the eastern
side of the Porrongurup Mountains, from which the following
bearings were taken:</p>

extent, the after-mentioned objects being very conspicuous:</p>

<p>From Porrongurup we descended into a plain of considerable
extent, with a dry water channel passing through it, the soil of
which was composed of a loam of a light sandy nature, with
tolerable herbage. In our progress towards the river, we emerged
from the dense forest through which our road had hitherto lain,
into an open country, almost destitute of trees; a continuation
of the plain mentioned yesterday being observed to extend to the
north and south of Porrongurup to the Koikyennuruff Range, and to
the east and west as far as the eye could reach. On arriving, in
four miles, at some pools of brackish water, we stopped to
breakfast, and filled our kegs with sufficient for one day. One
mile N. by E. from this, led us to the Kalgan, which, at this
season of the year, was composed of a chain of brackish ponds.
The ground near it sometimes rises into flattened eminences of
little elevation, and of inconsiderable extent, and a narrow
border of flooded and white gums is the only indication of your
approaching the river. The view, however, that presents itself,
of the bold and varied outlines of the two ranges of mountains,
which I before mentioned, gives a character to the scene, which
is otherwise extremely monotonous.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;On the northern side of the river, the bed
of which declines where we crossed it to the S.E., at a distance
of four miles, and immediately after having killed a kangaroo, we
fell in with a party of the White Cockatoo and Will Tribes,
Nakina acting as our interpreter. One of the former, on being
told where we were goings and asked where there was water,
consented to accompany us, and conducted us to an opening in the
range on the western base of Toodyeverup, which these natives
pronounced Toolbrunup, where we found a deep channel with ponds
of brackish water, but even this was preferable to the
Kalgan.</p>
<p>As the mountain seemed the most accessible on the side towards
us, I decided upon remaining here for one day, for the purpose of
ascending it and examining the adjacent country.</p>
<p>Soon after day-light, accompanied by Mr. Clint, Nakina, and
the native, whose name he told us was Armie, I set out to ascend
Toolbrunup, (distant about three miles). On arriving at the base,
we found a small spring of excellent water. In two hours from
this, after climbing from rock to rock, I reached the summit,
which I should conceive to be elevated nearly 3000 feet above the
level of the sea, the steepness of the ascent proving too
difficult even for Nakina and Armie, who could not be persuaded
to proceed more than half way up. The clouds in which it had been
enveloped since our arrival&mdash;having cleared away just as we
had gained it&mdash;the panoramic view which was thus obtained of
the country, for many miles in every direction, did not present
any object of importance; the principal feature being what
appeared a dead level, no hills of any magnitude being visible
from N. to E.S.E. The surface of this immense plain was
diversified with open downs and extensive forests, and with a
great number of bare spots, which were supposed to be salt lakes,
from then: resemblance to some we had passed near Toolbrunup.
Towards the sea-coast, the country was mountainous, but the
native fires in that quarter materially obstructed our view. From
this elevation, a considerable number of angles and bearings were
taken; the most important being&mdash;</p>

<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;On our return homewards, our course was
more to the westward, and we reached a lagoon after a fatiguing
day's journey at the northern base of Porrongurup, which was
called, by a party of the Will tribe who paid us a visit,
Nicnarup.</p>
<p>On the 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Two miles brought us to the gorge in
the latter range, and we were exceedingly gratified, on
descending the southern side, in discovering a rich tract of land
covered with grass, which, even at this season, was quite green,
and with gum trees of a gigantic growth; this valley, which
resembles those at "Mount Bakewell", was supplied by a spring of
delicious water. The richest part of this tract was about
three-quarters of a mile in breadth, and extended to our right
and left long the side of ihe range. The ascent and descent of
the gorge is by no means abrupt, the slope on the southern side
not being too great for the purposes of agriculture.</p>
<p>On the 27th, we came upon the road which has been commenced
towards Swan River, about ten miles from the settlement, where we
arrived at one o'clock p.m.</p>
<p align="center"><small>GENERAL REMARKS.</small></p>
<p>In taking a retrospective view of our proceedings, and in
describing the general appearance of the country, the nature of
its soil, as well as of the different specimens collected, it
will be sufficient to mention, with respect to the
first&mdash;viz. the appearance of the country, that from King
George's Sound and from thence to the Koikyennuruff Mountains,
and the very distant land seen to the northward and eastward of
them, is one vast plain, covered for twenty miles from the
settlement by a dense forest of mahoganies, banksias, &amp;c.;
from this to as far as we penetrated, the country is open, and
almost destitute of trees of any magnitude. These districts are
watered by the Kalgan and King-rivers, the numerous tributaries
of the latter supplying an abundance of freak water, but the
former, where it was seen by us, was a series of brackish ponds.
Several salt marshes were also observed in the neighbourhood of
Toolbrunup. The relative positions in which the best land was
seen, I shall describe as follows:</p>
<p>The first that was met with was in descending the
north-eastern side, and along the base of Porrongurup; the next
was on the banks of the Kalgan; and the third, which was
exceedingly rich, commenced on the southern side of the chasm of
the last-mentioned range. We were unsuccessful in our endeavours
to discover the Kuik or the Quannet. The answers of the natives,
from whom I had hoped to gain some information to our numerous
interrogations on the subject, were generally so very vague, that
it was impossible to place any reliance upon them; but it does
not appear that they grow in the neighbourhood of Toolbrunup.</p>
<p>The Porrongurup and Koikyennuruff ranges rise out of these
plains; the base of the first extending about thirteen miles in a
longitudinal direction from nearly E. to W., and the whole, as
far as I could see, composed of granite, the blocks on the top
being very conspicuous. The latter, which was thirty miles long,
and of an average breadth of four, had its base strewn with small
fragments of granular and milk quarts, whilst from half-way up
the mountain to its summit, nearly horizontal strata of
clay-slate and granular quartz, succeeded each other, the former
being about eighteen inches, the latter four feet thick.</p>

<p>Station B is about one-sixth of a mile south from the native
path that leads from the crossings place, already mentioned, of
King's River, to the natives' crossing-place and huts, where
boats are stopped at low water on the Kalgan. I afterwards
followed this path, passed a native well containing clear water,
and then a small stream, and in little more than half a mile from
station A, crossed the channel now dry, which I noticed as
running into the bottom of Oyster Harbour on 3rd of May last,
during an excursion I then made up the Kalgan.</p>
<p>After walking about one mile and three-quarters from the path
mentioned, at some distance from and out sight of the Kalgan, I
came to Mr. Cheyne's grant, to the stream in it, and to the river
itself. The valley, I observed, to extend at first in an
irregular western direction for nearly three-quarters of a mile,
and then N. 322° E'; and having proceeded in the latter direction
for a mile, or thereabout, I saw Mount Gardener bearing N. 125°
50' E.; and five-eighths of a mile further, in the last-named
direction, 322°, I observed the bare rocky patch of Pakeillerup,
the bearing of which I took from point A, N. 154° 45' E. The
valley terminated here, having sent off a small branch to the
west a little before. From Cheyne's streamlet to lower boat
stoppage, along the native path, I calculated the distance to be
three-quarters of a mile.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our party set out,
ascending the right bank of the Kalgan from our bivouac, which
was on the elbow immediately above the upper boat stoppage,
crossed the entrance of a small stream coming from our left, the
same which was first passed when I had the pleasure of
accompanying Mr. Roe on a short exploring excursion a few weeks
since; then traversed a small flat, encircled by an elevated
terrace similar to the flat where we bivouaced, but distinguished
from it at present by the remains of a native Hut in a good state
of preservation; some time after, and at a mile's computed
distance from our bivouac, we passed the gorge of a deep gully
with a dry channel in its middle, and in a few yards more the
Kalgan, at a place where its waters flow over the projecting
rocks of its bed. These rocks are an ironstone or flinty slate,
but the banks, which rise above the river, are clay ironstone, or
a ferruginous and reddish freestone. The soil passed over from
the lower boat stoppage is very sandy, but producing a good
proportion of grasses and other herbage, and thickly wooded, for
the most part with the marree or red gum. We ascended the left
bank of the river, and after half a mile came to a valley and
plain of fine soil and feed, having a small channel, partly dry,
in which the water had flowed to the Kalgan. We ascended a
moderate elevation, and continued pursuing a N. by E. course for
two miles, to a swampy valley then one mile and three-quarters N.
by W., and one quarter of a mile N.E. to a valley of tolerable
soil, and a good deal of pasturage, where there was a moderate
stream, and on its banks, at a common crossing place, a
cheveaux-de-frise of wooden spikes, finely pointed, covered
thinly with the resin of the grass-tree, and directed to each
other and to the bank opposite to that in which they were fixed.
They formed an angle with the plane of the horizon of about 50°
or 55°, and no doubt were intended for staking kangaroo, which,
being pursued on on side of the stream, would select their
accustomed crossing-place to evade their pursuers by gaining the
other.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of a mile from the last stream, in a north
direction, I observed the eastern of the two middle hummocks of
Porrongurup N. 334° 45', and the summit of the eastern shoulder
of the gorge 339° 30'. A quarter of a mile further, in the same
direction, we came to the Kalgan, and having continued in its
general direction N.N.E. two miles and a half, crossing some
small streams, we arrived on a slope of dark gravelly soil. About
two miles further, observing an occasionally deviating course
N.N.E., I obtained a sufficiently clear view to ascertain that
the eastern gorge of Porrongurup bore 315°, the eastern hummock
313°, and the northern summit, now seen standing out from the
rest of the mountains, 310°. A sixth of a mile further I could
see the Kalgan valley serpentining with gentle bends for about
three miles N. 219° 30' E., and then apparently three points more
easterly. I looked in vain for some hill in the vicinity of the
Sound. The atmosphere not only being very hazy but thickened with
the smoke of native fires, we now descended half a mile obliquely
to lunch on the bank of the river at half-past 1, at a place
where we saw the droppings of homed cattle, and where I found a
granite rook having garnets embedded. Five minutes' walk from
this we entered upon the fertile slope of three quarters of a
mile, I described in my former excursion, on the 28th April,
1831, and found its extent still greater than I then observed.
The river, at its northern boundary, makes a sudden bend to the
eastward, which I ascertained more exactly to be N. 299° 15',
whilst from the same station C, the eastern Summit of the gorge
of Porrongurup bore 306°, and the western summit of that mountain
302 the hummocks being concealed by the eastern summit of the
gorge.</p>
<p>Continuing nearly north from this station (C) about half a
mile, the ground rising considerably, and being of tolerable
soil, I had these bearings from station (D); eastern summit of
Gorge of Porrongurup, the only point seen, 300°; a hill towards
the Sound, obscure, 220°. Two miles N. ½ E. from point (D) over
the feruginous claystone, commonly called iron-stone of the
country, I took the bearings of the mountains of the
Koikyennuruff range that had presented themselves, not yet
certain of their names, thus:&mdash;(<i>see Fig.</i> 3 <i>on

<p>Two miles further N.N.W. brought us to the river in front
coming from the east, which direction we took for a quarter of a
mile, and stopped for the night on its bank, opposite an isolated
conical hill, partly covered with trees and partly bare rock.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;We ascended the river in a
S.E. course for one-eighth of a mile, when I saw the following

direction we took, and then S.E. by E. for half a mile, rounding
to N., which we kept for one mile and a quarter, when, being
joined by three natives, and attaining a considerable elevation,
in a country with very few trees, I availed myself of the

<p>One mile and a half S. ¼ E. from point (P.) where I now had a
view of the real eastern summit of the Gorge of Porrongurup,
bearing 315° 10', as well as of the eastern of the two hummocks,
which was 311° 5'; and of the western summit, bearing 306°; and
of the eastern summit of the three preceding stations 322°; I
noted the following outline: (<i>see Fig</i>. 6 <i>on
accompanying Map.</i>)</p>
<p>One mile in advance S. by E.; and one mile S.S.E. brought us
into an extensive hollow, from which Mount Gardener bore N. 150°.
E., and the eastern summit or height of the Gorge of Porrungurup,
327° 30'. One third of a mile S.S.E. and two-thirds S.E. down and
across the hollow, and along a fertile grassy slope, brought us
to the banks of the river where we stopped.</p>
<p>The ground passed over on this side of the river is generally
sandy, covered with trees and shrubs on the heights and in the
hollows, having a thin surface of clayey sand, producing rushes,
cypress grass, and similar tough and hard vegetation. We crossed
no streams or channels, but the water evidently stands for a
great part of the year in the hollows. The ferruginous claystone
lay upon the heights nearest the river, but we saw little of it
further west.</p>
<p>Continuing our return on the 12th, we went one mile and a
quarter W., then S. by W. two miles and three-quarters, when we
came to a tolerably fertile slope leading down to the river, and
S.W. three-quarters of a mile, arrived in a valley having patches
of good soil and a dry channel, beyond which, one mile and
one-eighth S.S.W., we crossed a considerable stream (the Napier)
in one of the deepest valleys we had yet passed, supposed to be a
continuation of the stream on which I bivouaced on a former
excursion on the 2nd May, 1831.</p>
<p>One mile south from the above stream I observed Mount Gardener
bearing 136° 45', and in one-sixth of a mile more S. by W. came
to a moderately-sized running-stream, supposed to be that lately
passed by Mr. Roe when farthest north. One-eighth of a mile S. ½
E. from this the eastern summit of Porrongurup Gorge bore 349°
30'; the western peak of Mount Manypeak 303° 30'; and one-sixth
of a mile south Mount Gardener was seen bearing 134° 20'; one
mile more S.E. brought us upon the banks of the river, where we
found a native path, and in about one hundred yards crossed a
ravine and dry channel; and in one-quarter of a mile south came
to Hut flat, mentioned on the morning of the 10th.&mdash;(<i>see

<p align="center"><strong>REPORT</strong> <i>of an</i>
<strong>EXCURSION</strong> <i>to the Northward from<br>
Augusta, by Mr. J.C. [John Garrett] Bussell</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">We</span> followed for about three quarters of
a mile the creeks M'Leod, being obliged by its directions to
pursue a route rather to the north of our proper course; the land
was sandy, and abounded in a very coarse grit. After one attempt
to cross, and a complete wetting, we obtained the opposite side,
when the country presented much the same aspect; the timber was
of minor growth, and as thick as usual, excepting, however, some
few grass tree plains, in which water was standing, though not
over the shoes; old red sand-stone rock was common. After
advancing about four miles, the country improved; the trees were
of taller proportions but very thick. We passed a large basin
tolerably free from trees; it apparently had water in the lowest
parts. On the rising ground from which I looked upon it were
large masses of rock, (old red sand-stone.) From this place the
face of nature became more and more pleasing; the soil a rich red
loam; the bush of the same kind as that at Augusta; the trees
were very large and tall; here we caught a
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; this order of things
continued till we came to the banks of a small run of water,
quite overgrown with reeds, where we halted. The prevailing
timber, the white gum, previously blue, though on the bad land
mahogany had been most general. We crossed the brook which held a
southerly course; the soil again began to deteriorate; tracts of
sand were few, but rock (granite) abounded in extensive fields;
the country was hilly, though it afforded no elevation of
sufficient height to enable us to overlook the trees. After about
a mile and a half of such a country, we came to a large flat,
abounding in banksia, grass trees, and a swampy vegetation; this
flat was a black sand, with, however, a considerable admixture of
soil. Beyond this, bearing W., we now observed rising ground, but
before we began to ascend we came upon a brook surrounded with
most magnificent white gum-trees; the scenery here was very
beautiful, and on the banks that sloped down to the water we
dined, with the prospect of steep acclivities before us, and
rivers branching out in every direction. The men supposed we had
marched about eight miles, and taking into the consideration the
difficulties of travellings it perhaps was no more, though we had
walked from seven till half-past one.</p>
<p>After dinner, half-past three, we again moved on, and ascended
a steep hill for three quarters of an hour, without intermission.
The whole of this tract was exceeding fertile, but greatly
encumbered with timber of stupendous size, all white gums. I say
the soil was fertile, judging of it from the bush, taking into
consideration the species and luxuriance; the mimsta and red
creeper abounded; though the trees were very large, and on that
account, perhaps, appeared numerous, the ground was not shaded to
the extent that might have been supposed, owing to the nature of
the foliage of that sort of tree; rock was every where visible,
when a fallen tree had turned up the soil, a lime-stone, without
organic impression, as far as the short space I could devote to
such inquiry permitted me to observe.</p>
<p>Ascending this hill, we had proceeded about two or three
miles, when the blue gum became occasionally interspersed, and I
perceived through the trees on the left hand what appeared an
open space; concluding that I had nearly reached the summit of
the hill, I made for this in order to obtain a prospect of the
country I had passed. We now entered a large grass-tree plain,
from which we had a more extensive view than I had before
obtained from any height in this country; so bhie and even did
the horizon appear, that it was some time before I could persuade
the men that it was not the sea. The range of hills we were on
seemed to stretch north and south, and before I was on it, I
never saw so large an assemblage of the white gum. Both the
freshness of the wind and the leaning of the trees on the right
of the plain from the west, convinced me that the sea was at
hand, though we could hear nothing of it; nor did these
indications deceive me, for, on passing another small thicket,
having about the level of the top of the hills, we saw before us
the vast expanse of ocean about a mile and a half distant; from a
high hill on the shore we saw Cape Leeuwin, bearing S.S.W., the
cliff overhanging Turnerian stream S. We supposed we might have
come over the land we had passed in a straight line, and without
impediment of bush or swamps in a much shorter time, judging the
distance to be about ten miles.</p>
<p>I have now conducted you to the sea; we reached this at a
quarter to eight, on the morning after we left Augusta; having
left our night berth rather upwards of half an hour; I might have
done it easily overnight, but I did not think myself so safe.</p>
<p>The hills I had lately left stretched apparently to a great
distance in a line with the coast; they constituted a lime-stone
range, the rock of solid texture, and of the same description as
that on the White Patch, and that occasionally, but rarely, seen
on the conical hills, and again on the hills above Cape Leeuwin;
to avoid the troublesome walking that the beach always affords,
we kept a little inland; the soil was generally sandy and barren,
but where the least symptom of an admixture of mould shewed
itself, the grass-tree, of stinted stature, as though just
struggling for existence, was always seen, and sometimes in
extensive tracts. Before we came upon the White Patch, we
encountered a valley, the most difficult of passage of any thing
I ever yet met with in the shape of bush; its vegetation
consisted solely of shrubs, advanced to a larger standard than
usual in this country; the ground (I suppose in consequence of
perpetual shade and want of circulation) was covered with moss,
and on this we were obliged to crawl under the thicket, while
sliding down and climbing up the numerous and steep descents and
acclivities in which the place abounded: half a mile from this
brought us upon that remarkable feature, the White Patch, and as
I believe an opinion obtains, that it is a sand-stone, and formed
of hardened drift from the beach, I shall insert my own
observations.</p>
<p>The first peculiarity that strikes the eye is a large surface
of limestone, upon which, in the hollows and lower parts, is
deposited a considerable portion of sand, accumulated both from
the sea shore (which the presence of broken shells attests) and
from the gradual decomposition of the rock itself; and that this
process is going rapidly on, I conclude from the following
evidence:&mdash;above the surface on every side, may be seen
strong excrescences, resembling Hie stems of shrubs, sometimes
very slender, sometimes as large as the timber of a large tree;
one might imagine with the poet that nature had first given birth
to a thicket,</p>
<p class="poem">Then framed a shell when the work was done,<br>
And changed the hazel wainds to stone.</p>
<p>They do not, however, on close examination, appear to have in
them anything analagous to incrustation, but to be the harder
parts of the rock that have resisted the action of the
atmosphere, probably zoophytes, embedded in a more friable
matrix, which had disappeared from around them, and blown away in
the form of sand: there are nodules of a closer grained
limestone, to be seen protruding above the surface, sometimes
yellow, much resembling Grallo Anticho, and sometimes black or
slate coloured. From the White Patch, we walked on the beach in
the hope of finding water, for we had now been many hours without
any, and it was very hot, and walking laborious. We now descried
the wished for renovator, trickling out of the rock; and as the
sun was now "pillowing his head upon the western wave", we
halted&mdash;fortunately found wood enough for a fire, and gave
up the idea of reaching the Turnerian stream that night.
Limestone was still abundant on the beach, wearing a foliated
appearance; the laminæ so thin, that it may possibly become a
matter of <i>fiscal</i> consideration to Government, applied to
the purpose of roofing; I had saved many specimens, but one of
the men accidentally lost them, by removing my cap, in which I
had placed them.</p>
<p>We started at 8 o'clock the next morning, preparing for an
early march to Augusta. Instead of following the beach, I walked
over the sand hills; part of those I found forming into a stone
of a slate colour, cemented by what I could not tell; possibly an
example of the undulated sand downs, mentioned by Cuvier, as
observed by Peron on the coast of New South Wales; the new-formed
rock was soft, so as easily to be cut with an axe, and
occasionally presented a superficial crust. Passing those curious
caverns, which have procured the name of Turner's Chimney Pots,
from the sombre-like manner in which the sea sends up its foam
through them; first entering at an orifice on the beach, and then
breaking out again through the chasm that the falling in of the
earth and rock has made above in the bush; we searched the
Turnerian stream at half past 9, where we shot a duck, upon which
we dined; after we passed the conical hills, from the head of the
creeks, I made a direct course for Augusta, and came out upon the
river about a hundred yards above Mr. Turner's.</p>
<p>Rainy weather deluged me at Augusta, two or three days; but
when all was fair, arriving at the bead of the creek by water, I
set out with the intention of following, as near as possible, the
direction of the future road. I at first walked N.E., which
course, however, seeming too much inclining easterly, and as the
estuary was in sight, I changed first for N. by W., so as to
clear creeks, swamps, &amp;c.; afterwards for N., then again N.
by E.; the land was at first sandy, and abounding in iron stone,
where it all elevated itself above the general flat surface. We
encountered here some native huts, one peculiarly large and well
made, in the bottom of which was spread an oblong mat, of
tea-tree bark, I should think nearly six feet long. The nature of
the soil continued much the same, till we had passed the head of
the estuary a mile, or somewhere thereabouts; it then improved,
was rather hilly, and the trees large. We crowed a small brook
running E.S.E.; the white gum was frequent,&mdash;not thick, but
large; the soil&mdash;a red loam; the bush where unburnt,
luxuriant. I passed several small brooks, all flowing towards the
river; the land was not now generally rocky, and we occasionally
saw large blocks of granite. A stream, clear, rapid, and with
banks free from underwood, now crossed our path; here we dined,
about 2 o'clock. While the men were preparing to cook a cockatoo,
I, as usual, was preparing to make memoranda, when, alas! I
discovered I had lost my pencil case; this I regretted much, both
because it was a very handsome article, and because it prevented
me making any more notes on the spot. Steering, after dinner,
N.E. by N., we came on very swampy flat ground, and afterwards
passed some extensive sandy plains, nor did the country improve
when we entered the woodlands. A shrub, having a leaf resembling
the holly, prevailed, the true indication of meagre soil. At 5
o'clock, we came upon a deep broad stream, which surprised me, as
I supposed we had dined upon the only one for which I remembered
a corresponding creek, on the banks of the Blackwood: as I felt
convinced that river was at hand, I traced this stream for about
half a mile, to ascertain the point where they joined their
waters; returning, we crossed by a tree and continued our journey
N.E. by N., which, after about an hour, brought us out again on
the banks of the river then flowing at right angles to our
course. I now steered, first in a westerly direction, then
directly north, till near sun-set, when I again made for the
river, purposing to remain on its banks for the night, as I still
fancied myself far from home, judging from the creek I had just
passed; we halted, made a fire, and a screen from the wind, of
the branches of the beef-wood or the oak, for the country had,
for some miles, abounded with that valuably timber, which I
understand is a remarkable thing; neither the soldiers nor I had
ever seen so much of it before: the trees were, many of them,
large and fine, many much injured by fire; they afford the
lightest wood, and the only bark that can be applied to the
purposes of the tanner. These particulars concerning this tree, I
learned through the medium of the sawyers, who, in my absence,
had visited my grant, on their way to Swan River, and had
expressed their satisfaction at seeing it so abundant on the
banks, relating to my brothers, at the same time, its various
uses.</p>
<p>In the morning, after a walk of three quarters of an hour, due
north, having first made westing enough to clear the windings, we
came again on the river, and saw on the opposite bank my house,
most unexpectedly. The distance, I think, in a direct line, would
be about ten or eleven miles from Augusta, N. ½ E., or N. by E.,
the most direct course to that part of the river which extends
most west, near about my brother's house. Nothing could be freer
from obstructions, with regard to declivities, water courses, and
swamps, than the path by which we came; a bridge, rather more
artificial than those on the Augusta roads, would be required
over the largest stream we crossed, though a more northerly
direction would most probably render even that unnecessary.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>MR. BUSSELL'S JOURNAL</strong> <i>of an
Expedition to the<br>
River Vasse, from the Blackwood</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">We</span> left the Blackwood at the rapids,
and for some time traversed a country alternately rocky and
sandy, with occasional patches of good soil, always however
thickly wooded with mahogany. The first change that presented
itself was a thicket of young trees of the eycaliptus kind; what
these species might be, I could not tell, though I should
conclude, the same as constitutes the timber of the neighbouring
forests; they grew about four feet high, and had the appearance
of a nursery; the soil was a white earth. We had already put up
one kangaroo, and two rats, and to these our dogs had given
chase, but without success. We had been for some time in want of
water, when we came upon a small torrent, flowing east; this, on
account of the arid aspect of the country, we had passed, and the
appearance of the sky, which threatened rain, were inducements,
sufficient to determine me on an early bivouac; we therefore
halted for the night, at a quarter to six.</p>
<p>While the men were preparing shelter, I walked in an easterly
direction, to ascertain the cause of a break that showed itself
in the wood, and came on a stream, flowing at right angles to the
one on which we were settled, and apparently the receptacle of
its waters; south, inclining to east, was the course of this
rivulet; it was therefore a tributary of the Blackwood</p>
<p>The night proved as we had anticipated,&mdash;wet, but, by
folding provisions and blankets together into as small a compass
as possible, nothing suffered much, and with the help of a good
fire, we preserved tolerably well our animal warmth.</p>
<p>After no very early breakfast the next mornings we proceeded
through a wet bush, and were shortly in no better condition than
if we had been wading; our route brought us on the stream I had
observed the night before, but previous to crossing it, I
ascended a high hill on my left, which was covered with the same
sort of nursery of young trees I have before mentioned; no
prospect, however, except that of a hilly country, of varied and
undulating outline, rewarded my pains. The land I next passed
through, was much encumbered with trees, principally mahogany and
the oak; rock was abundant; and in what few plains I encountered,
a white clay, mixed with some little sand; streams of clear good
water were plentiful; nine, this day, we passed, one of which was
very considerable; we crossed it at the rapids, after walking by
its side about a mile north; most of the others were large enough
to lead to the opinion of their not being mere torrents; we were
generally more fortunate in finding fallen trees to assist us in
crossing. Near the largest, we met a native, (an old man) who
directed us to the best, spot for passing another, not more than
400 yards from the former, and most likely joining, at no great
distance, for they both held the same course. Here was the best
land I had yet seen&mdash;a rich red loam; it had been recently
burnt, and was then free from a woody bush, and covered with an
herb much resembling clover; I should, in fact, have taken it for
one of the trefoil tribe, had I not afterwards, at the Vasse,
seen the flower which is papilionaceous; the pod contains about
five seeds, each occupying a separate cell formed by partitions
of a spongy substance; in taste the leaf resembles grass, though
it is rather more glutinous. Thus much notice (undue perhaps) I
took of this small herb, from its resemblance to clover, and an
idea inspired by that resemblance, that it might afford good
pasturage. The native we bad just left, recognised none of the
words we had acquired from the natives of Augusta; he seemed,
indeed, so much alarmed (for he evinced fear by hiding the child
he had with him), that I should conclude him quite a stranger to
the sight of an European. Edwards was much tired at 12 o'clock,
and on that account we halted for about an hour, though we were
only waiting the presence of water to commence our dinner; half a
mile beyond this we came to a stream, on the banks of which we
dined; four miles more ended our day's march, and a comfortable
bivouac we had, free from wind and rain. The land we had now
passed was nearly all heavily timbered; a whitish soil was
common. We procured no game, though there was plenty of Kangaroo;
our dogs wanted scent and swiftness. The fruit I have mentioned
in a former Journal occurred often in the hills, generally near
water; the whole party ate it freely, and found the acid
refreshing.</p>
<p>The first part of the next day's march was over a country
clean burnt, the land generally good but rocky, often and heavily
timbered; white soil was frequent in the plains. We passed two
small water courses tending to the southward and eastward; after
this the country seemed to grow flat and swampy. We parsed some
large spaces on which the swamp oak prevailed without underwood;
the soil was a rich red loam, rather stiff. Kangaroos, from their
marks, must have been abundant, though we only saw one. I
consider the country we were now traversing to constitute part of
an area of high table-land, and the swamps upon it the sources of
the streams we had hitherto encountered; for after we had
advanced some distance further, the flow of the waters was in
another direction, to the north and west, supplying, I at first
thought, the Vasse; though I have since had reason to believe,
the Seaward and western branch of the Blackwood, or some other
river, if such a thing exists between Cape Naturaliste and the
White Patch.</p>
<p>On the third stream, holding a westerly course, we dined; the
land was open but sandy; the geology of the country continued the
same; in the channels slabs of old red sand-stone were generally
conspicuous. After dinner the face of nature exhibited little
change as we walked on; in one of the plains my dog was
accidentally shot. At the spot I had fixed for a bivouac, a
considerable stream, I left Edwards and one of the men, while I
proceeded with the other to look about me. I walked rather at
random in a northerly direction, found again a succession of
hills, rocky and precipitous, then returned and joined the other
party, after an absence of about an hour and a half. From the
time I at first found the water courses tending to the north and
west, I had altered my route from N.E. to N., concluding that I
was at least eastward of the Vasse.</p>
<p>Since, according to my reckoning, I was now nearly as far
north as the Vasse itself&mdash;and as I had seen that the
country for some distance before us was very hilly, whereas in
the vicinity of the point I was making very large
plains&mdash;since too I had all along kept to the eastward more
than I thought was right, wishing to cross over the same tracts
that the last travellers bad crossed; and because of the westerly
direction of the water courses, I determined to make a little
westing, and with that intention, I began my march the next
morning, N. by W. at first; for the numerous ravines I had seen
the night before seemed to promise a large stream, or some
assemblage of waters; nothing, however, appeared but small
torrents, running generally N. and E. After advancing about a
mile and a half from our bivouac, we descried some distant land
through the trees, bearing N.N.E.; from this point I steered
N.W.</p>
<p>As we advanced on our new course, we continued descending for
some time, while the land appeared less and less rocky. We now
entered an extensive plain, the soil of which was damp, and in
some placea was standing water. A ridge ci hills was seen in our
rear, extending east and west from the highest part of it, our
course was now conducting us. The surface of this plain, composed
of clay and sand, bore numerous impressions of the feet of the
natives and kangaroos. At 12 o'clock we halted for dinner, on a
remarkable water-course; the channel of which was generally dry,
and seemed to wind very much, for we had already crossed it
several times; though wide, was shallow, and its bottom consisted
of bare flat rock; following it for some distance, we found water
in pools, and in the pools, strange to say, small fish: here our
dogs caught a kangaroo.</p>
<p>At about a mile from this bivouac we came the next day upon, a
small stream flowing N. by E.; this I followed about half a mile,
in order to avoid a swamp that seemed to extend some distance on
the opposite side; the trees here were distant from each other
and large. A white cockatoo, the first I had seen this year,
attracted the attention of one of our party, but no success
attended his efforts.</p>
<p>The country, as we advanced on the other side of the rivulet,
improved rapidly; the ground on which we trod was a vivid green,
unsullied with burnt sticks or blackened grass trees; not that It
was covered with a decided turf, but the vegetation seemed more
succulent than woody, and the plants growing to about the same
height, presented to the eye a smooth surface.</p>
<p class="poem">With daisies pied, and violets blue,<br>
And ladies' smocks all silver white.</p>
<p>Though the flowers were not perhaps precisely the same that
characterised an English meadow, they were not the less beautiful
in appearance, varied in form, or brilliant in colour; grass was
plentiful, and the clover I have noted above, with its bright
scarlet and yellow flower, the daisy, buttercup, and a purple
marygold. The whole effect reminded me of that confusion of rich
tints that are produced in the Indian loam, and as I looked upon
it, I could not feel but inclined to believe that such a scene as
this must have presented to the imagination of the Hindoo, the
high colouring of his fabric, and the prototype of the gaudy
chintz.</p>
<p>Half a mile brought us on a small river, and so slow that I
could hardly ascertain the existence of a current. I concluded it
to be, as it afterwards proved to be, the Vasse. The sound of
rushing water proclaimed a rapid near; walking, therefore, a
short distance up the stream, we found what we sought, a passage
over.</p>
<p>Here was the spot that the creative fancy of a Greek would
have peopled with dryad and naiad, and all the beautiful phantoms
and wild imagery of his sylvan mythology: wide waving lawns were
sloping down to the water's edge, trees thick and entangled were
sloping over the banks. One in the centre of the rapids had taken
root in the very rocks over which the waters tumbled; its bended
trunks and tortuous roots seemed to indicate that it had
struggled more than once to gain the perpendicular form, from
which it had been thrust by the rude torrents, which at certain
periods evidently pour down this obstruction to the free flow of
the river.</p>
<p>About a hundred or two hundred yards on the other side, we
obtained a sight of the sea bearing N.W. The country here was so
clear that a farmer could hardly grudge the fine spreading trees
of the red and white gum and peppermint the small portion of
ground that they occupied only to ornament. The soil was always
good, sometimes very light; a red sandy loam; at other times
stiff, particularly where the white gum prevailed.</p>
<p>After walking about three miles in a N. by W. direction along
the banks, we began to observe evident tokens of the proximity of
the sea, such as hottentot figs, rock spinach; of the latter we
prepared a mess when we arrived on the edge of a large flat, into
which the river falls. It was then 12 o'clock; before, however,
we began our repast we were hailed by three natives, who were
wading over from the opposite side, fearful probably that we were
likely to interfere with some snares for fish which they had
constructed near the spot where we were; they carried spears, but
approached withal with such friendly guise and courtly seeming,
that I did not hesitate to advance to meet them alone and
unarmed. They were on the whole smaller of stature than the men I
had been accustomed to see, and wore no skins. The countenances
of two of them were certainly ugly and brutal enough, but the
third had a sprightly air and good-humoured expression,
accompanied with that revolting laugh which is so general with
these savages; his hair matted with peculiar taste into strings,
resembling spun-yarn, and bound up close, displayed a head of
true Caucasian proportion, with a facial angle less acute than is
often observable in the European.</p>
<p>They expressed considerable surprise at the facility with
which we procured a spark from the firelock; and, upon bur making
signs to that effect, soon blew it into a blaze. I afterwards
shot them two small birds, and gave them some of our kangaroo
meat, which they ate, refusing biscuit and vegetables. I obtained
some words of their language; it seemed much the same as that
used at Augusta. As is the custom there, they designated one
another, as well as ourselves, (in compliment I have always
thought), with the appellation youngaree and mamiungo; this
struck me as a considerable evidence of connection existing
between them and the savages of Cape Leeuwin. The words:</p>

<p>I enter thus into these particulars, because I infer that a
judicious treatment of the natives at Augusta has procured in
them, towards the settlers, a peaceful disposition. It will be
satisfactory to learn, that the population about to flow towards
the Vasse has grounds for expecting that friendly reception which
a previous knowledge of the habits of Europeans, or a favourable
report circulated amongst the tribes, and a consequent
predisposition to amity, may seem to promise.</p>
<p>After dinner we walked two miles on the banks of the Lake,
N.E.; fields of grass, in some places to the water-side, were
waving like corn. In high tides, this lake, as we advanced,
became brackish; seems to cover a large surface, which was then
exposed, and exhibited a continuous flat of limestone, having its
interstices filled with a coarse reddish sand; organic
impressions of shells were numerous; its texture was a large
oolitic; nor could I find one specimen of those dose-grained
nodules which are to be seen on the White Patch. From hence,
bearing N.N.W., we saw high land at a great distance. This I knew
to be Cape Naturaliste, as we had seen the day bearing in such a
manner as to be necessarily between us and these distant hills.
The bare rock and sheet of water seemed interminable; and, as
some of our party were much tired, I returned to the spot where
we had dined, and after a short rest there, resumed our march in
quest of a place affording wood for our nightly accommodation.
Native paths, which traversed these lawns in every direction,
gave us easy walking for about a mile S.S.W. We then made the
river and halted. Cockatoos were in greater multitudes than I
have ever witnessed before, white and black; they were, however,
shy, and defied the cunning of our sportsmen; though, I believe,
the heavy baggage of their pursuers, and a consequent
unwillingness to move further than was necessary, did more than
their own caution towards the safety of the winged tenants of the
groves. Dearth of fuel and innumerable ghats procured us by no
means a favourable bivouac.</p>
<p>Early the next morning I was awakened by a large flight of
cockatoos, and was looking at my gun to insure its going off,
when a cloud of ducks suddenly alighted on the water, close at
hand. I killed two, and, becoming my own retriever, undressed to
get them; the river in the middle is not deep, and the bottom
muddy, and abounds in a weed that unpleasantly twines round the
limbs of the swimmer; there is greater depth towards the
sides.</p>
<p>On leaving our own, and advancing two miles up the Vasse, came
on Mr. Preston's bivouac, which Kenny, one of the men, who had
also been of that party, recognised. A quarter of a mile further
up were the rapids, which we had first crossed.</p>
<p>From this point, I intended to make my march homewards as
direct as possible, in order to draw a tolerable estimate of the
actual distance, and to observe what facilities or difficulties
that line might hold out to the intended road. To find then this
course, I took the sketch I had lately traced of my former
circuitous route, and measuring by the scale the distance between
the two extreme points, found that what I had made between fifty
and sixty miles, was not in reality thirty miles off from the
point whence I started, and the course that would bring me about
on the middle, between the elbow and the rapids of the Blackwood,
was S.S.W.; that these conclusions of mine were not infallible,
will be seen in the sequel, together with the probable cause of
my error. Before, however, I leave the Vasse, I must take some
further notice of its productions.</p>
<p>The red gum, white gum, and peppermint, I have before
observed, constituted the larger sort of timber; there was also a
small tree, which Edwards informed me, was the black whattle. The
nomenclature of the trees in this country, with the
characteristics deduced from the colour of the bark or gum
confusedly, is so exactly calculated to lead to mistake, when a
person uninitiated in the mysteries of colonial language attempts
to describe, that it becomes necessary for me to lay down my own
observations on the growth, nature, and properties of, and, in
that manner, to define as nearly as possible, the trees I have
rashly endeavoured to designate. Of mahogany, peppermint, and
banksia, I think I am tolerably certain. Red gum, as far I can
learn, is the toughest and hardest of the whole race of
eycalipti, resisting the wedge, and of little use to the joiner,
from its abounding in veins of gum, which, like that of the
mahogany, is red; the wood is yellow, and is useful for the heads
of beetles, &amp;c. That which I have hitherto termed the white
gum, (a tree growing to a greater height and bulk than I have yet
seen), which throws off its bark in large flakes, wearing
immediately after its change of dress a light buff color, which
too is found generally in land abounding in springs, having its
wood tinged with a light pink; too hard, however, for the uses of
carpentering, when the eycaliptus robusta can be obtained. I now
term the white gum, that which is seen in moist stiff flats; of
small stature; sending out branches from below; changing its bark
frequently, so as soon to lose the marks of fire, but
imperceptibly, and not in large sheets; its wood is white, its
bark a light grey. The oak resembles the fir in its foliage; it
seems always to suffer much from fire. I wish to be accurate in
these points, as it is a custom here to judge greatly of the
quality of the soil from the timber it produces.</p>
<p>The grass tree is not uncommon, but of a different species
from either the many-crested, or hastile; its trunk does not
appear above ground, but the stalk that bears the flower and seed
is much slenderer than ordinary; very light and straight In the
hand of an African it would no doubt have become an arrow; to the
Australian savage it is of little use, except to stake round his
fish-snares; it did not appear to yield the yellow gum, or rather
resin. Wild celery grew very abundant on the side of the estuary.
The natives make, however, a great point of our not eating it;
signifying it Would affect us with vomiting; some of these people
had once before done the same thing, on my affecting to taste the
nuts of the palm tree, which I knew to be emetic; as they,
therefore, seemed to view unconcerned our dish of rock spinach, I
was inclined to pay some regard to their exhortation.</p>
<p>Here, too, I recognised another plant which is found also
growing on the rich stiff fiats on the banks of the Blackwood;
the flower much resembles groundsel, it has a strong taste of
celery, and is often used in my house for flavouring pea-soup;
pigs eat it readily. The clover I have mentioned before, is
spread very generally over the ground. The purple marigold
resembles the real marigold only in the radiated position of its
petals, &amp;c.; except for size, might as well be termed a
sun-flower or daisy.</p>
<p>In this place, too, we met a sort of grass, which to the
traveller is a most troublesome foe; it bears a seed about the
size of a millet, one end of which is pointed and barbed; to the
other is attached a fine taper tail, about three inches long,
having the appearance of two silken threads of different colours,
twisted together; in the action of walking, these seeds are
brushed off, and, fixing by these barbed points to the stockings,
they continue working through it, keeping up a most perplexing
irritation on the foot and ancle.</p>
<p>Thus much of notice I paid to the vegetation, as diffident
from what had been previously familiar to my daily
observation.</p>
<p>All the rock I saw in my whole march, except that on the
estuary at the Vasse, consisted of old red sandstone. It
sometimes had large crystals embedded in it; sometimes,
particularly in the channels of rivers, it was in slabs, and
apparently schistose; at other times it wore almost the form of a
conglomerate.</p>
<p>From the rapid where we first made the river at half-past
nine, I commenced my course homewards, S.S.W.; the land was
generally good, though sometimes sandy; but the spot we had just
quitted was a soil of mediocrity. Kangaroos end emus seemed
abundant, for we observed their traces in all the places we
passed, capable of receiving an impression. We had just arrived
on the brink of a small stream, when I was told one of the dogs
had been some time missing. We were obliged to wait his return;
he detained us three hours, though we dined in the interim, and
returned with the same proofs as before of a victory, as he
seemed inclined to shew, the men followed him about half a mile,
but returned from the fear of losing themselves.</p>
<p>We now walked over large extended plains, having been impeded
by the wanderings five or six times, on which we halted. We saw
plenty of game, but one of our dogs was tired with his last
chase, the other lame; at lengthy on our coming out of a large
thicket, on the verge of a very wide open space, two kangaroos
dashed away before us. "Sulphur", stimulated by the sight, and
forgetting his fatigue, was at the heels of one of them in a
moment. "Phillis" took the other, which made for some wooded land
on the left, in the mazes of which it soon left its pursuer.
"Sulphur", in the meanwhile, had driven his prey first far to the
right, and now in a long sweep was turning it to the bush out of
which "Phillis" was just emerging. All was decided; the poor
thing, finding itself surrounded, was compelled to turn to bay.
Kenny, always alive in the hunt, was soon on the spot, and
finished the existence of his victim as it was hugging one of the
dogs, who stood erect in his fronts too much out of breath to
hide, while the other, hung on its haunch.</p>
<p>I never saw a chase so completely from beginning to end
before; our booty proved a large buck, of about 130lbs. I need
not mention that we had not kangaroo dogs; the mode of their
hunt, and their want of scent, is sufficiently explanatory on
that head,&mdash;the one was a fine Cape greyhound the other a
small lurcher bitch; though the former had been used to the work,
it was the first time the other had ever seen a kangaroo, and her
want of experience proved her a deep rip in the belly.</p>
<p>We were now again overwhelmed with abundance, and as all the
party seemed inclined to profit by our good fortune, we a second
time halted for, the purposes of cooking; for water, we all
walked in different directions,&mdash;at the distance of about
half a mile, I came on the dry channel of some small stream, and
following it, found a few muddy pools. On my return, however, I
learnt that Edwards had discovered some close at hand, in a hole
that had lately been occupied by the root of a grass
tree&mdash;this amply supplied us; in fact, we afterwards found
water in several places at the small depth of half a foot.</p>
<p>This night we were disturbed by a furious barking among our
dogs, the cause, however, did not appear. The morning rose and
seemed to threaten a regular wet day; at 11 o'clock, however,
much to our satisfaction, it seemed likely to hold up, and we
proceeded: the first three quarters of a mile was over the same
level country we had experienced the day before; we had a range
of hills in our front, and were able to recognise the part of
them over which our former course lay, some miles to the left.
When we arrived at the foot of these hills, we came on a small
stream, which I considered the same we had left on the right the
day before. We passed two other streams not long after, flowing
W.S.W.; at five minutes to one we halted and dined.</p>
<p>We began walking again through a sandy loam, and land hilly,
rocky, and thickly wooded,. and passed several small streams, all
inclining to the west. We came upon one very large, and in it a
basin, into which rapids fell, about fifteen yards across, very
deep; we forded it at the rapids, but not dry footed; this
stream, which rolls along more water than the Vasse, can never
fail; the basin, at all events, would prove a greater acquisition
to a line of road, which, at the end of the summer, has been
found so destitute of water. Until ten minutes past 5, we
continued this march, and very miserable walking it
was&mdash;frequent rain in heavy showers, and clothes kept
constantly wet by the bash, inclined us to halt for the night,
that we might prepare a hut better than usual, against the
inclemency of the weather. "The sun set, and up rose the yellow
moon;" at her approach the sky wore a new and pleasant aspect,
the clouds vanished, the winds were hushed, and by the time we
had dressed for supper the ducks I had shot at the Vasse, we had
every prospect of a dry night and bed. This evening, my feet,
which had been blistered since the second day of our march, from
a defect in my shoes, were very painful, having been irritated by
perpetual friction on the affected part, for above a week.</p>
<p>Little variety gratified our curiosity the next day; the
country was still the same, rocky, woody, abrupt and precipitous
here, as in the places where rock and wood prevail together. I
observed that the vegetative principle in the roots of large
trees, seems, by a gradual but resistless process, to have had
the power of thrusting or wedging up large masses, the fissures
of which were sufficiently capacious for their first exigencies,
and early growth; hence, each trunk has the appearance of being
planted on a heap of huge stones, as if some gigantic gardener
had been employed in hoeing up the nurselings of the forest.</p>
<p>I fell in with a large lagoon this morning, about thirty yards
across, and perhaps four times that length; it seemed very deep,
and from all circumstances, I should say it was never dry. A
continual succession of hill and ravine after this crossed our
path; the water in the bottom all tending to the west. About 12,
we passed some high land, with a stunted growth of the oak, from
which, towards the N.W., we could see the tops of trees on some
high land, but nothing familiar presented itself. Towards the
decline of the day; the country was; if any things steeper than
we had yet found it, and from the top of a hill, I saw through
the trees a distant undulating horizon. I at first thought I
could see the White Patchy as I looked through a small opera
glass, but no one seconded my opinion, and, from recent
occurrences, I concluded it to have been the high land behind
Augusta; it bore S.S.W. about thirty miles.</p>
<p>We were now some time without water, the next we made, was a
small rivulet flowing east.</p>
<p>Early in the day, I had not expected to have reached the
Blackwood that night, as I had calculated it somewhat more
distant than the usual extent of our marches; since, however, we
had already gone further than usual, and were, according to my
reckoning, within a mile of that river, I was unwilling to halt
here; the course of this stream seemed to indicate its proximity;
I accordingly walked about a mile farther, and finally bivouaced
on another streamlet, flowing the same way; here we put up two
large kangaroos; the land, for the last few miles, had been less
hilly and rocky; we all suffered much from cold this night. The
next morning, after a walk of three quarters of an hour, I came
on the seaward branch of the Blackwood, about 200 yards from the
point of its junction with the main stream; and this, which on a
former occasion had proved such an obstacle, was now easily
passed, near its mouth, by means of a large fallen tree.</p>
<p>My error in making the Blackwood about two miles west of the
point I originally steered for, arose probably from this cause.
The first part of our journey to the Vasse, in which I made my
easting, was rated at the same average with the rest, whereas,
both on account of our heavy loads, bad travelling, and the being
not yet used to our packs, it was most probably performed more
slowly than that part of our road whidi led through open plains,
with easy walking, after two or three days had diminished our
stores; and of this nature was the country, when I began to turn
west; my extreme point then, or the Vasse, must have been
situated rather more to the west than I concluded, from the
result of my march there, and hence it was, that instead of
making the Blackwood halfway between the elbow of the river and
the rapids, I made the elbow itself, being out in my reckoning
about two miles; had it not been for this, I should have reached
the river rather before than after I expected.</p>

<p align="right"><i>Albany, King George's
Sound,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Western Australia, July</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1832.</p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
In the expectation that this may reach your Excellency in
England, and thinking that any additional information respecting
the colony may be of importance, I beg you will allow me the
honor to state, that in the end of May and beginning of June, I
made an excursion into the interior, sixty-five miles and a half
in a direction of N. 328° E. (true) in four days and a half I
passed on the south and west side of Mount Barker, and soon came
into a very level country, with few trees, growing in a gravelly
loam, thinly covered with grass. This is the general feature of
the country as far as I proceeded, presenting the greatest
facilities to overland communication with Swan River. I ascended
Warre-up or Road Hill, which is N. 328° E. (true) from Mount
Clarence, distant forty-eight miles and a half; a few miles north
of it is a channel, with, at my visit, large ponds of good water;
a Java bullock, in high condition, fed upon its banks. Beyond
this the ground gradually rises into moderate and very
traversable hills and valleys, the soil improves, the grass, even
at such a season, became abundant, and water stood in pools in
the channels of the valleys. I returned by the west end of the
Koikyennuruff Range, and ascended Madyerip, the western hill,
which I suppose to be 1400 feet above the level of the sea; it is
wholly composed, like part of Toolbrunup, of a quartzy sandstone:
a plain, with numerous salt lakes, lies to the north of it, and
neither from it nor from Warre-up did any mountains appear toward
the interior. I skirted the south side of Porrongurup, and Mr.
Henty had previously seen the north. The blue gums and other
trees are very fine, and there may be about 1000 acres of very
superior grassy land, well watered, upon it.</p>
<p>In the middle of July, I traced a valley where there is a
rapid mountain stream, (I think the Hay) from a mile west of
Mount Barker, to N. 307° E. (true) from Mount Clarence, distant
twenty-two miles and a half, and found on its sides, as well as
on the sides of the valleys entering it, which also contained
streams of water, a considerable extent of good soil,&mdash;of
excellent young grass shooting up where that of the former year
had been burnt, and in some places, a thick covering of old
grass. A herd of fourteen horned cattle were pasturing on the
verdant slopes, and appeared by their traces to have passed the
summer there. Their high condition testified in favour of their
feed.</p>
<p>This winter has been more rainy, and a little colder but less
boisterous (a hoar frost on three mornings) than the last, and
more favorable to vegetation; the potatoe and wheat crops doing
very well.</p>
<p>The few adventurers here are timid at the present aspect.
Numbers are wanted, to aid and assist each other, create a mutual
demand and supply, and extend themselves into the interior, or
capital, to bear the enormous expenses of first improvement.
Security against want, and extravagant prices of the necessaries
of life, would do much to attract the labourer, who is of
paramount importance.</p>

Your Excellency's most devoted Servant,<br>

<p align="center"><strong>JOURNAL</strong> <i>of an Expedition
over General Darling's<br>
Range, 100 miles east from Swan River</i>. [by T.W.H.]</p>
<p><span class="a">Everything</span> relative to an expedition
into the interior of a newly-discovered country, will be
interesting to you, therefore you will readily excuse the
insertion of small matters, and circumstantial details, which
will be of little interest to others.</p>
<p>Previous to commencing my Journal, I will give you an account
of our fit-out from the Peninsula:&mdash;Mr. C. and myself found
three horses and a servant, the English mare carried the greater
part of our baggage, and the other two we rode occasionally. We
took the lining of a tent to keep off the heavy dews in the
night, and to refresh ourselves under in the heat of the day. A
small axe and spade answered the purposes of cutting down a pole
for the tent, and of trying the land where we travelled; each
person was furnished with a blanket, which was to serve as bed
and covering; from ten to fourteen days' provisions were deemed
necessary for the expedition, which consisted of flour, biscuit,
pork, rice, sugar, tea, spirits, &amp;c. &amp;c. We had each a
compass; this is a very useful article, and indispensably
necessary in a foreign country, where there are neither roads nor
marks to steer by, nor human beings to communicate information on
the subject. Having given an account of our equipment, I shall
now proceed with my Journal.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 23<i>rd</i>.-About noon, Mr. Camfield, a
neighbour of ours arrived, and we immediately crossed the Swan in
a large flat-bottomed boat, which Captain Byrne was kind enough
to send over for us; at that gentleman's we enjoyed drinking a
glass of colonial-manufactured beer. A gentleman of the name of
Bull, who lives up the Canning, brews this beer, and sells it
three shillings per gallon. A little higher up the river lives
Mr. Drummond the botanist, an intelligent man, and clever in his
profession; after receiving their benediction, we passed on, and
in a little time met with Lieut. Gregory, who very politely
invited us in; we sat for a few minutes, held a short
confabulation on the occurrences of the day, and then bent our
course to the banks of the Helena. On our way, we saw several
other houses to the left, situated on the banks of the Swan; the
smoke ascending above the heights of the trees is a pleasing
variety where shrubs and trees are evergreens. The Helena is a
fine strong fresh-water stream: has its source in the mountains,
and falls into the Swan below Guildford. On this truly rural spot
we found a brick-yard, two or three houses, and a garden,
belonging to Colonel La Tours; the house, the best of the kind I
have seen in the colony. Every thing about the place bore evident
marks of desertion; not a soul could we find; this large
establishment is completely broken up. I have been told, which I
believe to be the case, that it originally consisted of about a
hundred souls, and the general impression here is, that if the
concern had been properly and efficiently supported and managed,
by this time it would have been in a flourishing condition. As it
regards situation and choice of land, there appears to have been
some proper judgment exerted, but, alas! for want of energy,
funds, and general judgment in the conducting such a phalanx,
every measure which might have been effective and successful, has
become abortive. Night fast approaching and spreading her sable
curtains around us, we thought it prudent to take possession of
this deserted dwelling, and for once enliven the place by
lighting up a large and brilliant fire in the garden. After some
little preparation, we sat down on the ground, and regaled
ourselves by drinking tea, and perfuming the air by the burning a
celebrated of "Indian weed": smoking is more needful here than in
England; it assists in keeping off that torment of Australia, the
musquito, which is always ready to thrust his proboscis into your
flesh where it is unprotected; it is a fortunate circumstance,
this insect only frequents low swampy places and lands in their
vicinity. Upon examining the house floor, we found it very damp,
and not tit to sleep upon, therefore, without more ceremony, we
went into the garden, erected our tent, and turned in for the
night. This afternoon we walked ever a fair quantity of good
land, and crossed several streams: this land, in my opinion, is
well adapted to the climate, being rather light or sandy, yet
well covered with vegetation, and suitable for grazing and
agricultural operations. I have no correct idea of the quantity,
but suppose it does not extend far from the river; however, this
district is granted away. Heard of the arrival of a ship since we
left home, and are anxious to know where she is from.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Arose about half-past five
o'clock, breakfasted, and crossed the Helena immediately; had
some little difficulty in so doing. On arriving at Mr. Boyde's,
we were disappointed in not finding his Excellency the
Lieut.-Governor there according to appointment, but supposed the
arrival of a ship to be the cause, which afterwards proved to be
the case. His Excellency arrived about noon, in company with Wm.
Stirling, esq., Mr. Dale, ensign. Dr. Colley, the Rev.
&mdash;&mdash; Wittenholme, Mr. Jones, three servants, and five
horses; the party now consisted of sixteen men, ten horses, and
six dogs. There are several very fine alluvial flats of excellent
land about Guildford, well suited for fattening strong cattle,
and equal in quality to most I have seen in England. This land, I
am informed, is almost, if not altogether, taken up, except town
allotments, which are granted away in small quantities, and then
actual residence is required, in order to secure them. We left
Mr. Boyde's about three o'clock, bent our course about E., and
travelled to the mountains; we ascended a little up a rugged
pass; found a fine stream, with forage for the horses; here we
encamped for the night. Our tent was the only one in the party.
His Excellency slept in a hammock slung between two trees, the
rest of the gentlemen folded themselves up in their blankets
about nine o'clock, and slept before the fire.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;The blast of the bugle
saluted our ears about five o'clock; breakfasted, and set off
about half-past six. Travelled E. by N. four hours over a
mountainous country, very rugged in some parts, and halted by
another stream; here we rested three hours. The hills abound with
the finest mahogany I have seen; the trees are very lofty, and
amazingly straight; it is very surprising how such fine timber
can grow on such stony and apparently inferior land. We commenced
our journey again about half-past one o'clock, and halted about
three, indeed, we encamped for the night, the Governor being very
much indisposed. We crossed several mountain streams to-day; saw
but one kangaroo.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Arose at five o'clock, set
off at seven; about ten o'clock we fell in with three large
kangaroos, and had the good fortune to kill one; it would weigh
from 100 to 120 lbs.; according to the practice here, we gutted
him, fed the dogs, and immediately set to work and skinned him. A
mountain-stream being hard by, we halted, and soon had some of
the animal on the fire; it was cooked in three different ways,
but for want of proper seasonings, suitable vessels, and good
cooks, it was a miserable mess. The kangaroo, when properly
prepared, is excellent food; the flesh of the large ones, when
roasted, resembles beef, but destitute of fat; the young ones,
when nicely managed, eat very much like ham; it also makes very
nutritious soup, Begun to travel again about one o clock, and
continued until evening, when we found another stream; here we
put up our tent, and bivouaced for the night. The general
character of the country the same as yesterday; a little sand
here and there in the valleys may be found capable of
cultivation, and, probably, at no distant period innkeepers may
find it worth their notice, and plant themselves by the way.
Found an emu's nest to-day, the shells of the eggs only remained,
the young ones had been hatched some time.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Set off early again this
morning. Killed two kangaroos of the large kind, which are
properly called forest kangaroos, and a small one of another
kind, called the mountain kangaroo; some had travelling about
here, but suppose it might be avoided by keeping in or near the
valleys. We saw many white cockatoos to-day; this bird is very
wholesome food. A traveller may, in genera], conclude he is not
far from water when many of these birds are to be seen; we also
observed they were most numerous on the best lands. The white
cockatoo appears to live on what it takes from the ground,
whether insects or roots, I am not able to say. The black kind
live on the buds of large trees and shrubs. About 12 o'clock, we
made the river, and were in some measure disappointed. At the
time it was discovered by Messrs. Dale and Brockman, it would be
from one hundred to two hundred yards across in some places,
marks of inundation being discoverable to that extent; in other
parts thirty, forty, or sixty yards wide, with rather high banks.
When this circumstance is taken into consideration, it was in the
midst of the rainy season, Messrs. Dale and Brockman are very
excusable for taking it for a river. The rainy season being over,
the floods have subsided, and the true course of the stream or
streams may be distinctly seen; where the waters prevailed most,
at the period mentioned before, may now be discovered alluvial
flats, well covered with grass, and admirably suited for grazing
cattle in the hot months. Where the course of the water was most
contracted in the rainy season, at present there is as fine a
river, to all appearance, for half a mile together, as any one
can wish to see; the fact is, these appearances of a river, are
large reservoirs or ponds, made by the tremendous rush of waters
from the hills at that period. I am of opinion this strong
mountain stream falls into a river northward. Though our hopes of
inland navigation are cut off from this place, yet this stream
will be of infinite advantage to the district, yielding an
abundant supply of excellent water for man and beast all the
year. I felt rather disappointed in the quality of the land, in
descending from the hills to the stream, which would be between
two and three miles; at the same time it is land that may be made
to produce most kinds of grain, except beans; it is thinly
covered with grass, but of a good kind. In the afternoon, we
travelled in a southerly direction up the stream, the land
continues to improve, and some very nice farms may be found; it
lies remarkably well for draining. The whole of this land is
lightly wooded; a species of gum and green wattle are the kinds
which prevail most; here and there is to be seen the sandal wood
tree. We halted by a small stream for the night. Our evenings
have been very agreeably spent.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Up early as usual. After
breakfast walked to the foot of Mount Bakewell&mdash;this mount
is remarkable on account of its peak and height The best soil I
have seen since I left England is about the base of this hill;
the grass, also, is truly good and thick set The land walked over
this morning is of excellent quality, generally speaking, very
nicely situated, and well suited for grazing and agricultural
purposes; it may be very easily drained, and will not require any
very great draught to turn up the soil. I think this district
cannot be properly called loamy, that term implying, unctuous, or
marly ground; the soil here is rather light than otherwise,
inclining to sand more than clay&mdash;some would call it a sandy
loam, but how far correct I am not able to determine. I think the
best way to describe it is to compare it with land you and my
friends are acquainted with in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. It is
similar to good wold land, with this exception, it has got the
granite pebble instead of the chalk or flint one; land
impregnated with granite is generally good, whilst that with
ironstone in it is the reverse, at least I think so, from the
observations I have made. On arriving at the foot of this hill we
began to ascend; it is very steep in some places, and required a
good deal of energy and resolution to reach the top; however,
when we got there we were not disappointed, but amply repaid for
our labour. To the W. and N.W. we had a most beautiful and
extensive view, hill above hill in almost endless succession till
they are lost in the clouds&mdash;the smoke of a native fire at
some distance&mdash;indeed there is a very romantic and
delightful prospect all around except to the N.E. S. and S.E. may
be seen very plainly the course of this strong mountain stream; a
very large flat of land lies between this mount and the stream,
having a very encouraging appearance. It having been previously
understood that some of the party were to proceed there on four
days' journey due E. and the others to return home about 12
o'clock, we who were of the party going forward took leave of his
Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, Captain Byrne, Dr. Colley,
and the minister, at the foot of Mount Bakewell. We crossed the
stream a little before one o'clock, and walked about three miles
over good land, superior in quality to that seen in the morning.
Taking the quantity together, this tract may be properly termed
undulating, being composed of gentle rising hills and fruitful
dales, and beautifully wooded. We then came to a limestone ridge,
which may hereafter be of considerable service to this district
both for building and manure. After crossing this we fell in with
a portion of country quite different from any I had seen before
in Australia; it is free from trees, and covered, where it is not
burnt up, with a low shrub. This brought to my mind an English
common, or unenclosed waste; there may be 2,000 or 3,000 acres of
this description, very inferior in quality, and fit for nothing
at present except kangaroos or rabbits to browse upon. After
crossing a stony ridge, we met with another flat of land
something lower, and dear of brush-wood, but similar in quality
to that last-mentioned. In the early part of the day we passed
two or three streams of good water; some of the party had a
conversation with the natives, who were very civil, and wished to
make them understand what they meant by a variety of singular
gestures; these are the first we had seen since we left home.
Walked eleven miles after dinner.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rose at 5 o'clock, as usual,
and got breakfast immediately. We walked about half an hour over
fair soil; a few useful farms might be got here, but I think they
would be small. On the S.W. may be seen large hills, with
considerable patches of land on them, completely clear of timber.
After walking six miles we found a stream running to the S. There
is likely to be water here all the year; in some places it is
rather deep. Two miles distant we found another stream. There are
hundreds and thousands of acres of land about this part entirely
clear of wood, mostly sand, but not of the worst kind; mere is a
slight portion of vegetable earth among it It is my opinion, if
this land were in England instead of New Holland, there would be
a crop of turnips upon the whole of it the next year. After
taking dinner we walked four miles, across an open undulating
country, very sandy, and bad in quality, but good to travel over;
a gig might drive here for miles together without any
considerable obstruction. We next found a tract of better land,
with a fair quantity of wood. We encamped in a valley for the
night, and had to dig holes in order to get water. In the course
of the day we had, perhaps, the finest and longest kangaroo chase
that has been seen in the colony: the kangaroos on these commons
are amazingly swift, and it requires a good grey-hound to come up
with them. Passed two native huts, superior in size and
architecture to those we are accustomed to see.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Set off at half-past 6 o'clock,
walked a mile, and saw Mount Bakewell W. 3° S. There is a nice
farm in the valley we have just crossed, perhaps 1000 or 2000
acres. This valley is surrounded on three sides by sandy commons.
We walked over the one that lay in our course about one mile and
a half in breadth, and got to the top of a hill; here we had a
view of the country before us, which was of a different character
from the one just passed over, being well clothed with wood. Upon
exploring it we found it to be very ragged in some places, with
some middling good land in the valleys. Towards evening we fell
in with a forest of gum-trees, different from any known on the
Swan and Canning Rivers; we named them cable or fluted gum, being
considerably twisted, yet they are very tell and straight, and
the bark of a green or olive colour. Our course lay through this
forest; and after walking five miles we arrived at the foot of a
mountain, very singular in appearance, and composed of solid
granite. This huge rock we afterwards called Mount Stirling,
after W. Stirling, Esq. Here we had to dig for water; it was
about 7 o'clock when we made this place.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Upon examination it was found
our quantity of provisions would not admit of our going further
E., we therefore ascended several very high hills for the purpose
of examining the country and making observations. Mr. Dale and
Mr. Stirling went to a high hill three or four miles off, which
they named Mount Caroline, after a lady in this part Mr.
Camfield, Mr. Clarkson, and myself, went to another, the highest
of three, which we named Mount Elizabeth, after a lady of your
acquaintance. We arrived at the top of this very high hill or
rock about half-past 10 o'clock. In ascending the E. side, near
the top, we found a small spring of excellent water, the day
being very hot we found it of very great Service. Due E. we
observed the smoke of a native fire ten miles off; the country in
that direction appears gradually to rise, water in two or three
places may be seen. The valley from E. towards N. abounds with
swamps or salt marshes, the water brackish, and a quantity of
samphire grows there; a large extent of country is evidently
under water in the rainy season. E.S.E. are to be seen four
mounts S.W. There is a peaked hill of considerable height about
fifteen miles distant. From W. and by S. may be distinctly seen a
body of water, with a blue mist, indicating water for two miles
in a southerly direction. W. about three miles is a small round
hill, thinly covered with wood, and of a sandy complexion. From
Mount Elizabeth, Stirling's Mount bears S.S.W., Mount Caroline
N.N.E. about two miles and a half off. On the top Of this massy
rock there is an astonishing number of lizards, remarkably
beautiful, and the velocity with which they move is truly
surprising. After making the above observations we began to
descend, and found a much stronger spring of water on the N.W.
side; we likewise found an arched piece of rock, with several
bird's nests adhering to the top. From their peculiar
construction and composition, I judge they belong to the swallow
tribe, but very different from those seen in England. There is
much good land about the base of these mountains, what there is
beyond is not for us to determine, that work must be left to
other explorers in after-days; however, it is some satisfaction,
that we left good land at the eastern extremity of our route.
After dinner we steered S., in order to change our course a
little; in this direction we found land of excellent quality,
capable of producing good corn, and very suitable for sheep.
Having travelled six miles we encamped by a stream for the
night.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Set on at 6 o'clock, S.S.W.,
first mile or two tolerably good land; we then met with high
sandy commons similar to what have been described before, rather
better in quality if anything. About 10 o'clock, having walked
nine miles, we cut upon two large lagoons; here we halted; there
is strong presumptive evidence that these lagoons contain water
all the summer; we shot at a brace of musk ducks here; these
birds cannot fly. There are plenty of kangaroos here, without
going out of our tract we saw at least twenty. The kangaroo
appears to be the antient and almost sole proprietor of these
extensive wolds. After dinner we travelled to a peaked hill,
which we named Mount Deborah, after a celebrated lady in
Yorkshire; from it we had a view of the native fires, with
appearances of water bearing W. 16° N. There are 2,000 acres of
good land, more or less, about this mount; a water-course on the
north side, but little water in it at present; it would make a
delightful farm; here we lodged for the night.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Set off early, as usual,
walked three miles through a forest, so thick in some parts, that
we were obliged to alter our course. On the edge of this wood we
found a large lagoon, and after walking another mile, through
brushwood and swamps, we found another lagoon of considerable
magnitude, the water in both brackish. These lagoons are
evidently much larger in the rainy season; they must at that time
cover many hundreds of acres of land; probably they are a
continuation of those seen about Mount Elizabeth and Mount
Caroline, and I am pursuaded they must fall into a river
southward. After leaving these lagoons, we ascended a huge sand
hill, and descended on the other side into a wood; here the land
is better again. A little before we halted, we passed over a
small tract of the richest land I ever saw, to the best of ray
recollection. Travelled eleven miles this morning, and rested in
a valley where there is plenty of crass. After taking a little
refreshment, we commenced our journey again, and in a little time
met with a small party of natives; these are the first I have
seen on this excursion. We got a green branch, (which is the
emblem of peace,) shouted, and made many signs, but all was
unavailing; poor Mungo, I venture to say, was never in such a
predicament in his life before; he shouted, and appeared to boil
with rage, showed his spear and throwing stick, but when he found
that all his bravado did not deter us, but that we still kept
advancing, his courage forsook him, and the whole party took to
their heels, and away they ran, hooting and muttering, yet
apparently terrified beyond measure; and no wonder, for I suppose
they had never seen an European before, much less a horse, with a
man thereon. As they worship the sun, and probably other
celestial bodies, they might think "the Gods had come down." Very
little good land this afternoon. Saw thirty kangaroos to-day.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 3<i>d</i>.&mdash;Not having any water last
night, except what we had in some small canteens, we arose at
half past four o'clock, and commenced a brisk march before
breakfast; we got very wet, some heavy showers of rain fell, and
after walking six miles, we felt something like Cowper's "Farmer
at the tything time in Essex." It was no time to joke. Passed
over two or three pieces of excellent land this morning, and
beautifully situated; many charming farms may be got about here,
from 100 to a 1000 acres, more or less. After breakfast we set
off again, and were highly delighted, whilst walking about nine
miles over the best land I have seen in the colony; we then fell
in with a strong scream, which afterwards proved to be the same,
or a branch of the same, discovered by Messrs. Dale and Brockman
before: the land here is very good and covered with grasses of
excellent quality, even to the tops of the hills; and, in a short
time, this part will be found peculiarly applicable to breeding
and grazing sheep and young cattle. In my opinion, I never saw a
finer country for sheep.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;After breakfast we crossed
the stream, walked over a valley, found another rivulet, and
ascended a high hill; from this eminence we had a view of Mount
Bakewell, hearing N. twelve miles off; it is all hill and dale in
the intermediate space, with every appearance of good land. The
native grasses in this part are very good, and grow very strong;
some of them are a yard in length; but where they are very long,
it must be observed, they are thinly planted in general. About 11
o'clock we halted, and after dinner Mr. Clarkson, Mr. Crawfield,
and myself, crossed the stream, with the intention of examining
the land some miles distant, but in this we were disappointed by
a heavy rain; however, what we did see amply repaid us for our
labour.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Gunpowder-plot. Arose before
5 oclock, breakfasted, and bent our course home due W. Our stock
of provisions being rather low, we could not spend more time in
examining the country; the first five miles after leaving the
stream was vary hilly, but the land good, with huge pieces of
granite rock here and there. The land in the vicinity of this
place is well watered; even in the tops of some of the highest
hills, water may be had all the year round. Plenty of stone may
be procured for the purposes of building houses, out-houses, and
fences. There are no large trees on the good land, but plenty of
black or green wattle, which gives it a very pleasing and
picturesque appearance; there is also a species of gum; these two
kinds of wood will do very well for the farmer at first, and
there is plenty of mahogany and some red gum, within a few miles.
The limestone ridge opposite Mount Bakewell, will also be of very
great service to this part if no other can be found nearer. The
good native grasses of Western Australia, to the amount of half a
dozen or more, I should not know from good English grasses, were
it not for the knowledge I have of the distance that separates
the two countries. I frankly confess that I am a novice in
botany, and botanical phrases, or I would have given you the
proper names of each of these grasses: however, I have vanity
enough to suppose I know what kinds of grass are suitable for
weep and cattle; and I give it as my opinion, that the
before-mentioned grasses are of the right kind. The climate on
this side the mountains I like much, not being so hot, by several
degrees, as on the Swan; the air is fresh and bracing, the dews
heavy in the night; indeed, if we may make vegetation speak a
language, it is this&mdash;here the soil is good, the climate
fine, and the rains sufficient At the same time, I would have you
take notice of the three following considerations:-First, every
country is subject to vicissitudes, one season may be dry and
another wet. Secondly, it is but two months since the rainy
season. Thirdly, I am a fallible being, and therefore my judgment
may be wrong. However, to make short of the matter, I say I am
well satisfied with what I have seen on the Avon, and you are
fully aware of what experience I have had in these things, and
therefore will be able to give an opinion on the subject to your
friends and neighbours. At the end of the five miles before
mentioned, there is a very sudden change in the soil, and the
appearance of the country; the ironstone rocks are to be seen,
and very little or no good grass, except in the valleys. We have
lost a fine greyhound, and the other dogs are very lame.
Travelled eight miles this afternoon: this part of the country
has lost all its interest, except as a medium to a better.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Arose betime and intended
starting with all speed, but to our mortification, Mr. Clarkson
found that his English mare and a Cape one had taken "French
leave", as we sometimes say; but what a wonder they have been
permitted to roam at large before, as was the case last night, so
it cannot be counted a misfortune but an act of imprudence. After
a long search they could not be found, so we left him and his man
all the provisions we could spare, and they tarried behind,
hoping to find them in the course of the day, but the sequel
proved their hope was vain. So far, we have met with better roads
on our way home than on our way out. We rested a little time, and
then ascended a huge mountain; on the other side it was very
rugged and steep, with the Helena running at its base; in the
space of half a mile we crossed two other streams, which run into
the one before mentioned. After passing these streams, we had to
climb another hill, of no ordinary ascent, which made
perspiration flow freely; time and patience brought us to the
top, and on the other side may be seen mahogany trees of
extraordinary dimensions: I measured one which had been burnt
down, which was thirty-eight yards, or 114 feet long; another
that was standing measured fourteen yards round the base. I stood
by another which lay flat on the ground, but could not see over
it; this tree would be six feet in diameter, at least: you may
think these dimensions almost incredible, but I assure you it is
fact Found a beautiful stream and rested for the night before the
fire, the tent being left in the wilderness.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Set off again about 6
o'clock, and after a march of about five hours and a half,
through forest, swamp, and stream, we arrived at the last hill,
and had a view of the sea, Garden Island, Rotteness, Melville
Waters, Mount Eliza, Perth, &amp;c. With considerable difficult
we descended into the plain, and took a little refreshment by a
delightful brook. After resting a little, we set off again,
having eight or ten miles to walk, and about half past 5 we
arrived at Captain Byrne's, and had the satisfaction of again
seeing home.</p>
<p>"Be it ever so humble, there is no place like home", after a
sixteen days' ramble into the interior of a country where no
Europeans had been before us. Had you seen the party arrive you
would certainly have either laughed or cried, I don't know which;
some were in a pitiable plight, having worn out their
shoes,&mdash;a good crop of toes to be seen before, and a famous
round heel behind; others with their trowsers worn off half-way
up the leg, and a knee peeping out; some had not been shaven all
the time, others but once; in fact, it was high time all of us
made the land of the living again, for all needed some repairs,
and our stock of provisions was all but exhausted: it put me in
mind of some words in Cowper's "Mutual forbearance",</p>
<p class="poem">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"worn
out graces,<br>
Long beards, long notes, and pale faces,<br>
Are each an antiquated scene."</p>
<p>Pale faces was not applicable in the present case, for some
were burnt red, and others not very light coloured. Now I have
given you an account of this expedition, and I am happy to say,
satisfaction is the result of reflecting upon it; not upon the
writing or composition, but upon the subject matter of it: on the
whole, it must be considered a successful one, and I have no
doubt but time, "no distant date", will prove the truth of what I
have ventured to prognosticate.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>REMARKS.</small></p>
<p>Our not finding water must be attributed to our not knowing
the country, for in general we found water near, the following
morning.</p>
<p>I saw no birds, beasts, or reptiles but what were known
before.</p>
<p>The kangaroo must be very numerous in the interior, if we may
judge from the quantity seen in walking a straight line.</p>
<p>I am of opinion a large portion of the good land seen south of
Mount Bakewell, will keep a sheep and a half per acre. They allow
three acres for a sheep on the other side of the island.</p>
<p>Lastly, I receive no salary from Government for scribbling,
therefore I hope to stand acquitted from a charge brought against
some journalists who have written from other countries.</p>

<p><span class="a">The</span> prevalent diseases this year were
similar to those of the last, viz. Dysentery, Opthalmia, Fever,
and Scurvy.</p>
<p>Dysentery.&mdash;There were fewer cases of this disease than
in 1830. They were of the same mild character as described in my
last report. As the causes, symptoms, and treatment, are there
detailed, it is unnecessary to repeat them. All the cases have
terminated favourably.</p>
<p>Opthalmia.&mdash;Neither was this disease so general as during
the preceding year. Those who escaped it in 1830 were now
generally attacked. It was of the sub-acute, purulent character,
already described; no unfavourable termination has taken place.
The Aborigines are liable to this disease, but I have not seen
any amongst them, whose vision was permanently injured by it.</p>
<p>Fever&mdash;has been also on the decline, and the symptoms of
a milder character. It appears to have been brought on by
malaria, wet and cold, fatigue, or intemperance; or perhaps, in
some instances, all these causes conjoined; there are no proofs
of its being of a contagious nature; on the contrary, it has
seldom occurred to two persons residing in the same house. In
that portion of the town of Perth, called the Bazaar, where some
bad cases occurred the last year, there has not been one this,
which may be accounted for by the improvements which have taken
place in that neighbourhood&mdash;the clearing, the draining, and
the erection of good houses. It was mentioned in my last report,
that some ships arrived here at the commencement of the
settlement, with typhus fever on board, and that it was possible
the fever might have been introduced in that way. I am now
inclined to doubt, whether any such disease can exist here under
the ordinary circumstances of the atmosphere; no case of measles,
small pox, scarlatina, or other contagious disease, has hitherto
been met with. Syphilis is unknown, and vaccination, after
repeated trials, has failed.</p>
<p>Scurvy has not been either so common or so formidable as last
year. The increasing comforts of the settlers arc gradually
undermining and will soon eradicate this disease.</p>
<p>The cases of disease have been, on the whole, fewer in number,
and milder in character this year than the preceding. The
favourable opinion I have already expressed of the influence of
this climate on European constitutions, as well as a residence
for invalids from India, is strengthened by a further experience
of two years.</p>
<p>I have met with several individuals here, who, on leaving
England, were great sufferers from dyspepsia, and disorders of
the digestive organs generally, from the nervous affections which
so often accompany these&mdash;from hypochondria, from asthma,
and from bronchial diseases&mdash;who have recovered their health
in a remarkable degree since their arrival. Some of slight
figures have become more robust and stronger. Parturition with
the female sex is expeditious and safe, being accomplished by the
efforts of nature alone within from three to six hours. No woman
has died in child-birth in this colony since its commencement,
nor am I aware of any who died within a month after.</p>
<p>Children thrive remarkably well; and I may add, every
description of live stock, although collected from different
climates,&mdash;England, India, South America, Africa, Sec, and
various plants and vegetables collected from as many different
sources, find here a congenial temperature.</p>
<p>Indeed I am disposed to conclude, that when the settlers are
well lodged and fed, and the country more cultivated and
improved, but few diseases will be met with; I might perhaps say,
only dysentery and opthalmia, and these of a mild character.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>LETTER</strong> [from Joseph
Hardy.]</p>
<p align="right"><i>Peninsula Farm, Swan
River,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
July</i> 14, 1832.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">Dear Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
In compliance with your wish, I here send you a short statement
of my proceedings and remarks since my arrival at Swan River. If
you think them worthy of notice, or useful in any shape, they are
at your service.</p>
<p>February 3d, 1830, arrived at Swan River, in the brig Tranby,
from Hull, and found many of the emigrants in their tents, at
Fremantle, generally dissatisfied, and full of complaints
respecting the colony, (and some of them ready for going away).
The flats up the Swan, the badness of the soil, the heat of the
weather, with many other things of the same kind, appeared to be
the subjects of general conversation, when worshipping at the
shrine of Bacchus; and after being assailed on every hand by such
miserable comforters, I found it necessary to leave them and go
to look for myself, and after reaching the Peninsula, (where I
now reside,) was convinced that the land was of an useful
character, and might be made to suit the general purposes of
agriculture, although inferior to much of the land higher up the
Swan. The first three or four months was taken up by house and
boat-building, getting up the goods from Fremantle to the
Peninsula, &amp;c. &amp;c. In June we begun to clear the land and
plough for wheat, barley, oats, rye, &amp;c., all of which came
up well, but the fences not being sufficiently good, the cattle
broke in and destroyed a great part of the crop; that which
escaped their ravages came to maturity, and was of a very good
description. Tho last year, 1831, has convinced me that when the
land can have tillage and proper management, it will grow wheat
barley, oats, rye, potatoes, and turnips, in great abundance:
very good specimens of the aforesaid articles were produced the
last year&mdash;the average weight of wheat Irom sixty-two to
sixty-five pounds per bushel. As it respects the seed time, it is
as long and favourable as we can wish; it commences the latter
part of May, and continues through June, July, and even August,
where the land is in good condition. We have heavy rain in
September, very fine showers in October and November, and in the
beginning of December the corn is ready for reaping, so that it
suffers nothing for the want of moisture. We have little or no
more rain until March, (although very heavy dews) when the
showers commence, and increase every month until July or August,
after which they gradually subside until November. In December,
January, and February, the weather in general is hot, and the
grass much burnt up, but the cattle do well and keep their
condition the year round; when the grass fails they feed on the
grass tree and the tops of the brush-wood. Young stock thrive
remarkably well, and are as large when nine months old, as the
same description of stock would be in England at twelve months. I
think this is owing to the vary fine climate, which permits them
to graze throughout the year, without being obliged to house them
for six months out of twelve, and keep them on dry fodder, (as is
the case in England,) which very materially hinders their growth.
Sheep do well and increase very fast; in some instances, twice in
the year. The great scarcity of working cattle, has very
materially retarded the progress of the settlers in their
agricultural pursuits, and has prevented the colony from arriving
at that state of improvement and prosperity which it otherwise
would have done. When a sufficient quantity of bullocks and sheep
can be obtained to satisfy the wants of the settlers, and a
portion of those settlers can be established on the Avon River,
as graziers, the colony will be in a fair way for supplying
itself with all the necessaries of life, produced on its own
soil. What I have seen of Yorkshire, on the river Avon, I was
much pleased with, and think it well adapted for either grazing
or farming; but the distance from market, in the present state of
the colony, will prevent much being done in the farming line
above what is wanted on the spot for consumption. As it respects
the colony at large, there is little doubt but it will succeed,
and well, if it receive that encouragement and support which all
colonies need in their infancy. We have already seen the
wilderness become a fruitful field, bending beneath the gentle
breeze, and are looking forward to the time when every diligent
man shall be surrounded with peace and plenty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="a">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
In compliance with your Excellency's request, as to my opinion of
the climate of Swan River, I beg leave to state, as a climate
with regard to health, I am not aware of any other that can he
compared with it.</p>
<p>As a proof of its salubrity, during the three years His
Majesty's Sloop, Sulphur, was employed upon that station, not a
single death, and very few important cases of disease occurred,
notwithstanding the very great exposure of her men, not only to
wet, but also night air, in consequence of her boats having been
a great deal employed at a distance from the anchorage. When
exploring the country, for several days, and sometimes weeks,
have these people been exposed to the sun, fatigued in the
evening after a day's exertion, slept in the open air, and that
repeatedly in wet weather, without suffering in the slightest</p>
<p>Another point ought also to be taken into consideration; the
debilitated state of these constitutions which were undergoing
this exposure, in consequence of having been so long a period
upon salt provisions, and without vegetable diet; out of three
years and ten months the Sulphur was employed upon the Swan River
service, her crew were only 256 days upon fresh diet A life of
this description in any other climate, I have no hesitation in
asserting, would nave been productive of the most serious
disease.</p>

<p><span class="a">My Dear Governor</span>,<br>
<br>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your Letter of October 7th,
by the Cornwallis, and sit down to take advantage of her
departure to write by her. My last was despatched to you by
H.M.S. Imogene, early last month, Capt. Blackwood having touched
here on his way from India to the eastern coast and isles in the
Pacific. We continue to get on quietly here, as I mentioned in my
last. The crops have turned out very abundant, but the Van
Diemen's Land seed has proved generally indifferent, and has
introduced a good deal of smut; the farmers, however, seem well
satisfied on the whole. I have directed Morgan to call on them
for promissory notes, for the advances of provisions, payable the
1st June; and I have thought it advisable to issue a notice, that
the Government consents to take, any time before then, wheat, the
growth of the colony, in payment, delivered at 15<i>s</i>. per
bushel, which is allowed by the farmers to be a fair remunerating
price. Wheat has been selling at 25<i>s</i>. and 30<i>s</i>., but
whenever Lennard and Brockman had thrashed, they offered it at
their farms at 15<i>s</i>. Stephen Henty arrived a few days since
with the Thistle, and a well-assorted cargo, including twenty
tons of flour, which he sold for 4½<i>d</i>.; and wheat, I am
told, at 8<i>s</i>. per bushel, to M'Dermott both; she goes back
immediately for another cargo. The wheat crop is generally rated
as under six months' consumption. I have some idea that it will
be necessary to order from the company at the Cape fifty tons of
flour, by Henderson, but our expenditure in stores has been so
heavy that I shall not do so, if I can avoid it. As the expense
of the Ellen is £1000 per annum, I think it will be advisable to
lay her up after a trip to Augusta, keeping Tolez on as
pilot.</p>
<p>I intend not to lose a moment in completing the buoying off of
the passage into Cockburn Sound, whenever we can get the chains
and anchors. Blackwood expressed great anxiety to effect this for
us. We have beacons at present, however, on the Challenger and
other rocks, so that it is perfectly safe.</p>
<p><i>February</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;I am now about sending off
my despatches by the Cornwallis, which is to sail to-day. I find
that Brown has written so voluminously as to render it
unnecessary to me to revert to the arrival of the Cygnet, en our
late proceedings in the Executive and Legislative Councils, which
I trust will meet with your approbation, on seeing them at the
Colonial Office, need not repeat the general anxiety that
prevails as to the result of the mission you have undertaken, and
the desire for your return after the accomplishment of the
object, and I am sure none more so than myself. I hope you will
be able to get the sale of lands here deferred for some years, as
it is generally supposed to operate strongly against our getting
an increase of settlers of late, when such a spirit of emigration
has manifested itself at home. With the hope of soon hearing from
you from England,</p>
<p align="right">I remain, my dear Governor, yours very
faithfully,<br>
H.C. IRVIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>P.S.&mdash;I have just had the produce of wheat of this crop
at Henly Park tried, and find that upwards of 60 bushels per acre
have been yielded by land that last year gave 52. This, I think,
you will consider very encouraging.</div>

<p align="center"><strong>EXTRACT OF A LETTER</strong> <i>from
Swan River, dated</i><br>
27<i>th January</i>, 1833. [by T.P. jun.]</p>
<p><span class="a">Land</span> increases in value daily on the
Swan; a grant that the owner would have readily sold for
25<i>l</i>. ready money, a twelvemonth ago, will now fetch
100<i>l</i>.; indeed, I do not know a better war of investing a
small sum of money, than in land on the Swan: a grant I gave
200<i>l</i>. for, I could let, for grazing sheep, at 20<i>l</i>.
per annum, and your land is improving all the time. People who
had grants on the Swan, in the earlier period of the colony,
thinking them worthless, literally gave them up, conceiving, that
as land was given away, and no one appeared to derive any benefit
from the culture, or rather never attempted such culture, that it
was useless to retain them; now, however, that they see the soil
producing wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, turnips, carrots, Indian
corn, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the greatest profusion, they are ready
to purchase the very grants they previously gave away. There are
only two sorts of people who can get on here, the one with a
capital, the other the labouring man, who gets a three acre
grant, cultivates it two days in the week, and works out the
other four days, supporting himself, and bringing his grant into
cultivation. You have, I suppose, heard dreadful accounts of the
nature of the soil, and with some show of reason, probably, as
Fremantle, the great emporium of our trade, is the vilest place
on earth&mdash;nothing, in fact, but a huge mass of white sand;
and the country, within two or three miles, partakes of the same
valuable qualities; and there are many who pretend to give a
description of the colony, who have never been more than an
hour's walk into the interior. The land on the banks of the Swan,
commencing at Perth, is decidedly good, up to the hills; the
Canning, I believe, is the same. This good land, I must tell you,
though, only extends half a mile to a mile back, from the banks
of me rivers, when you come to light sandy soil, covered with
brushwood and worthless trees; though in the neighbourhood of the
numberless lagoons which are scattered very thickly over the face
of the country, you may find excellent soil. Over the hills,
however, the scene changes; there is, as may be seen in the chart
of the colony, a chain of hills running north and south, parallel
with the coast; they are not worthy of the name of mountains, as
I should think none in this neighbourhood exceeds 4 or 500 feet
in height. From the foot of the hills, about twenty miles from
the coast, you commence an up and down journey, which extends to
the distance of forty-eight miles, when you reach York, our ultra
mountain settlement: there are, I believe, three ranges of hills
before you reach the level country, but these offer but few
obstacles to the traveller; indeed, though they have never
levelled a road, but merely cut down the trees and brushwood in
the line a cart can go over very well: the land when you reach it
is really good, and moreover uniformly so thinly wooded, and well
adapted for either grazing or tillage. Messrs. Trimmers have now
a flock of 500 sheep there, all thriving uncommonly well. At
present there are only two or three settlers over there, as the
transportation of provisions makes settling there very expensive
at present. On the whole, I think there is not a doubt of the
ultimate success of this colony, provided we have a government
who obey the dictates of reason,&mdash;the country will produce
anything; the only drawback, perhaps, in the eyes of an
inhabitant of our cold, foggy, yet dear little island, would be
the heat of the climate. The following calculation will show the
amount that will be sufficient to commence as an
agriculturist:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>LETTER</strong> [from Capt.
Stirling.]</p>
<p align="right"><i>Woodbridge, near
Guildford,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
May</i> 18<i>th</i>.
1833.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,</span><br>
<br>
With reference to your Note of the 9th instant, in which you
express a wish to be informed as to the measures which it is
proposed to adopt in regard to the settlement in Western
Australia, I beg leave to say, that any information which it is
in my power to afford you, or any other person, interested in the
subject, is very much at your service; but it is necessary to
observe, that as I am not in the exercise of any official
authority in this country, any statement I may make on such
matters must be considered as emanating from a private
source.</p>
<p>The view which the colonial department takes of the colony in
question, I believe to be this:&mdash;that, although it was
originally entered upon with the intention of meeting the wishes
of several individuals desirous of establishing themselves in
that country. His Majesty's Government is not indisposed to
afford the settlement every reasonable and proper degree of
protection and countenance. It is therefore proposed to provide
for it certain civil and military establishments, upon a scale
inexpensive, but, in my opinion, sufficient for the
administration of government and law, and for the protection of
the settlers. The civil establishment will be more efficient, but
not more costly than that which has existed hitherto; the
military force will be doubled, or, at least, extended to two
companies. The expense of supporting these institutions will be,
for the present, supported by the Crown, but the continuance of
this practice cannot be expected to extend beyond the period when
the growing means of the settlement shall enable it to bear the
charge of its own establishments.</p>
<p>Every description of expenditure unprovided for by vote of
Parliament, or unconnected with the two branches of service
aforesaid, will have to be borne by a colonial fund. To this, as
a commencement, the Secretary of State has recommended the
appropriation of a considerable sum, now in course of payment, as
due to the Crown for provisions, &amp;c. supplied to individuals;
and it will be for the colonial legislature to keep it up by the
imposition of such duties as it is customary to collect in other
British colonies. The first charge on this fund will be the
equipment of a mounted corps for protecting, and, at the same
time, controlling the aborigines. The subsequent charges will be
for the construction of roads and public works; the erection and
support of schools; relief to destitute persons; and such other
appropriations as may seem most conducive to the general welfare.
The Legislative Council, at present existing, will be extended,
so as to comprise a portion of settlers unconnected with the
government. The land regulations under which assignments were
made to the earlier settlers, will be modified for their benefit,
and the same assistance which has been given as to passage-money
by the emigration committee, to labourers proceeding to Van
Diemen's and Sydney, will be extended to Western Australia, so
soon as she can offer the same security which has been required
from the other colonies. The appropriation of a ship of war to
services exclusively connected with the new colony cannot be
afforded; but it will be visited at proper intervals by ships
belonging to the station, and for the purpose of enforcing the
port regulations, the colonial vessel will probably be armed.</p>
<p>The forgoing sketch includes an outline of the arrangements
which I have reason to think will be adopted in the future
management of the colony. In making these several concessions,
the Government considers it will have accomplished all that the
settlers ought to expect In the advancement of their particular
pursuits, in the cultivation of the soil, and in the conversion
of its natural resources into a productive state, the colonists
could not derive any solid or permanent benefit from the
assistance of government, and in all such matters they must
therefore rely upon their own means and industry. They will be
protected by a local government; they will enjoy the benefit of
English laws; their interests will be superintended by a
Legislature composed in part of persons taken from their own
body; and, with these advantages, if private capital and
enterprise cannot accomplish all that remains to be done to
render the settlement prosperous, it will not owe its failure to
any want of attention to its interests on the part of
government.</p>

<br>
The <i>West Australian</i> (Perth, WA: 1879-1954)<br>
Saturday 13 March 1937.]</p>
<h4>BUILDERS OF THE STATE. 4.&mdash;&mdash;Some Military
Officers.</h4>
<p><span class="a">When</span> Western Australia was founded in
1829 a detachment of 64 officers and men of the 63rd Regiment was
sent out to protect the settlement. The duty of protection never
amounted to more than a show of force and the occasional shooting
of a single native&mdash;a business in which some of the settlers
showed themselves quite as capable and, in most instances, rather
more enterprising than the soldiers&mdash;but the military men
played other parts in the building of the State. As settlement
was extended they were placed in small groups where required on
the Swan; Kelmscott, York, Pinjarra, Wonnerup, Williams, Kojonup,
Augusta and so on&mdash;and, besides giving a feeling of security
and the value of their company to the lonely settlers, in some
cases the soldiers shared the manual labour. Their big service,
however, was in exploration.</p>
<p>In exploration the names of two youngsters of the 63rd are
prominent: Lieutenant Erskine and Ensign Richard Dale. In 1829
and 1830, when the settlers were grouped on the Swan, and while
naval parties were engaging in explorations along the coast
northward and southward, these two officers led small parties
into the interior, over the ranges, seeking for new land. Dale, a
young man in the early twenties, did the major work. In 1829 he
made two successive expeditions up the Helena River, and in 1830
and 1831 two expeditions over the ranges into the Avon Valley.
His enthusiastic reports, confirmed by an examination by Erskine,
led to the opening up of one of the richest farming areas of the
Colony and he had the honour of leading the first body of
settlers over the hills to York. Subsequently he made a further
examination of the outlying country from the Avon and also
conducted explorations northward from King George's Sound.</p>
<p>Another engaging young man was Lieutenant H.W. Bunbury, of the
21st Fusiliers, which succeeded the 63rd in furnishing the
military detachment for the Swan River. He was stationed
successively at York, Pinjarra and Wonnerup in 1836 and 1837 and
travelled energetically throughout his districts.</p>
<p>Perhaps his most appreciated service to the State lies in the
happy chance that he wrote keen and humorous letters about his
experiences and that after nearly a hundred years these were
published in book form by a kinsman of his. The book, "Early Days
in Western Australia", by Bunbury, is one of the most useful
printed commentaries on conditions in Western Australia in the
early years.</p>
<p>Besides these and other officers who did some service to the
Colony while on military duty in it, there were others who, while
not attached to their regiments, carried out explorations. Such
was Captain Thomas Bannister, who led the first expedition by
land from the Swan River to King George's Sound. He also had an
ambitious project for leading an overlanding expedition from New
South Wales, but it came to nothing. A more distinguished
representative in this class was Captain George Grey, of the 83rd
Regiment, who from 1837 to 1839 led successive expeditions,
sponsored by the Colonial Office, at the time when Lord Glenelg
was Secretary of State for the Colonies, and by the Royal
Geographical Society. One was in the far north of the State,
around the Glenelg River, and the other was from Shark Bay
southward, partly by whaleboats and, after the wreck of the
boats, on foot. He also made other explorations around Perth.
Grey was a young and inexperienced man at the time, and the value
of his local exploration has been some what inflated partly on
account of the distinction he later achieved as a colonial
administrator in South Australia, New Zealand and the Cape, and
partly on account of the readable and semi-scientific account he
gave of his work. More over his book revealed a quality of
personal heroism and a keen interest in all things that are very
engaging. But when his West Australian work is examined
separately and critically he does not appear as a very good
explorer. The imperfection of his work in the Glenelg River in
the far north was partly responsible for the tragedy of the
Camden Harbour settlement of 30 years later, and the imperfection
of his work around Port Grey (near Geraldton) helped to confuse
the beginnings of the Australind settlement.</p>
<p>Although some of the military officers did obtain land grant,
in the colony, only one or two had an interest&mdash; in the
colony beyond the few brief years during which they were on duty
in it. It was only an interlude in the life of the regiment. They
left their names behind on river, town and mountain, and went to
serve elsewhere.</p>
