<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE rainy season was over; and forest and jungle
were a riot of lush green starred with myriad tropical blooms,
alive with the gorgeous coloring and raucous voices of countless
birds, scolding, loving, hunting, escaping; alive with chattering
monkeys and buzzing insects which all seemed to be busily engaged
in doing things in circles and getting nowhere, much after the
fashion of their unhappy cousins who dwell in unlovely jungles of
brick and marble and cement.</p>

<p>As much a part of the primitive scene as the trees themselves
was the Lord of the Jungle, lolling at his ease on the back of
Tantor, the elephant, lazing in the mottled sunlight of the noonday
jungle. Apparently oblivious to all his surroundings was the
ape-man, yet his every sense was alert to all that passed about
him; and his hearing and his sense of smell reached out far beyond
the visible scene. It was to the latter that Usha, the wind, bore a
warning, to his sensitive nostrils&mdash;the scent spoor of an
approaching Gomangani. Instantly Tarzan was galvanized into alert
watchfulness. He did not seek to conceal himself nor escape, for he
knew that only one native was approaching. Had there been more, he
would have taken to the trees and watched their approach from the
concealment of the foliage of some mighty patriarch of the forest,
for it is only by eternal vigilance that a denizen of the jungle
survives the constant threat of the greatest of all killers&mdash;man.</p>

<p>Tarzan seldom thought of himself as a man. From infancy he had
been raised by beasts among beasts, and he had been almost full
grown before he had seen a man.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, he classed them with Numa, the lion, and Sheeta,
the panther; with Bolgani, the gorilla, and Histah, the snake, and
such other blood enemies as his environment afforded.</p>

<p>Crouching upon the great back of Tantor, ready for any
eventuality, Tarzan watched the trail along which the man was
approaching. Already Tantor was becoming restless, for he, too, had
caught the scent spoor of the man; but Tarzan quieted him with a
word; and the huge bull, obedient, stood motionless. Presently the
man appeared at a turn in the trail, and Tarzan relaxed. The native
discovered the ape-man almost simultaneously, and stopped; then he
ran forward and dropped to his knees in front of the Lord of the
Jungle.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Big Bwana!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Ogabi!" replied the ape-man. "Why is Ogabi here? Why
is he not in his own country tending his cattle?"</p>

<p>"Ogabi looks for the Big Bwana." answered the black.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Ogabi has joined white bwana's safari. Ogabi, askari. White
bwana Gregory send Ogabi find Tarzan."</p>

<p>"I don't know any white bwana, Gregory," objected the ape-man.
"Why did he send you to find me?"</p>

<p>"White bwana send Ogabi bring Tarzan. Must see Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Big village, Loango," explained Ogabi.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "No," he said; "Tarzan no go."</p>

<p>"Bwana Gregory say Tarzan must," insisted Ogabi. "Some bwana
lost; Tarzan find."</p>

<p>"No," repeated the ape-man. "Tarzan does not like big village.
It is full of bad smells and sickness and men and other evils.
Tarzan no go."</p>

<p>"Bwana d'Arnot say Tarzan come," added Ogabi, as though by
second thought.</p>

<p>"D'Arnot in Loango?" demanded the ape-man. "Why didn't you say
so in the first place? For bwana d'Arnot, Tarzan come."</p>

<p>And so, with a parting word to Tantor, Tarzan swung off along
the trail in the direction of Loango, while Ogabi trotted
peacefully at his heels.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>It was hot in Loango; but that was nothing unusual, as it is
always hot in Loango. However, heat in the tropics has its
recompenses, one of which is a tall glass filled with shaved ice,
rum, sugar, and lime juice. A group on the terrace of a small
colonial hotel in Loango was enjoying several recompenses.</p>

<p>Captain Paul d'Arnot of the French navy stretched his long legs
comfortably beneath the table and permitted his eyes to enjoy the
profile of Helen Gregory as he slowly sipped his drink. Helen's
profile was well worth anyone's scrutiny, and not her profile
alone. Blonde, nineteen, vivacious, with a carriage and a figure
charming in chic sport clothes, she was as cool and inviting as the
frosted glass before her.</p>

<p>"Do you think this Tarzan you have sent for can find Brian,
Captain d'Arnot?" she asked, turning her face toward him after a
brief reverie.</p>

<p>"Your full face is even more beautiful than your profile,"
thought d'Arnot, "but I like your profile better because I can
stare at it without being noticed." Aloud, he said, "There is none
knows Africa better than Tarzan, Mam'selle; but you must remember
that your brother has been missing two years. Perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain," interrupted the third member of the party, "I
realize that my son may be dead; but we shan't give up hope until
we know."</p>

<p>"Brian is not dead, Papa," insisted Helen. "I know it. Everyone
else was accounted for. Four of the expedition were
killed&mdash;the rest got out. Brian simply
disappeared&mdash;vanished. The others brought back stories&mdash;weird,
almost unbelievable stories. Anything might have
happened to Brian, but he is not dead!"</p>

<p>"This delay is most disheartening," said Gregory. "Ogabi has
been gone a week, and no Tarzan yet. He may never find him. I
really think I should plan on getting started immediately. I have a
good man in Wolff. He knows his Africa like a book."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," agreed d'Arnot. "I do not wish to
influence you in any way against your better judgment. If it were
possible to find Tarzan, and he would accompany you, you would be
much better off; but of course there is no assurance that Tarzan
would agree to go with you even were Ogabi to find him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think there would be no doubt on that score," replied
Gregory; "I should pay him handsomely."</p>

<p>D'Arnot lifted a deprecating palm. "Non! Non! mon ami!" he
exclaimed. "Never, never think of offering money to Tarzan. He
would give you one look from those gray eyes of his&mdash;a look
that would make you feel like an insect&mdash;and then he would
fade away into the jungle, and you would never see him again. He is
not as other men, Monsieur Gregory."</p>

<p>"Well, what can I offer him? Why should he go otherwise than for
recompense?"</p>

<p>"For me, perhaps," said d'Arnot; "for a whim&mdash;who knows? If
he chanced to take a liking for you; if he sensed
adventure&mdash;oh, there are many reasons why Tarzan might take
you through his forests and his jungles; but none of them is
money."</p>

<p>At another table, at the far end of the terrace, a dark girl
leaned toward her companion, a tall, thin East Indian with a short,
black chin beard. "In some way one of us must get acquainted with
the Gregorys, Lal Taask," she said. "Atan Thome expects us to do
something besides sit on the terrace and consume Planter's
Punches."</p>

<p>"It should be easy, Magra, for you to strike up an acquaintance
with the girl," suggested Lal Taask. Suddenly his eyes went wide as
he looked out across the compound toward the entrance to the hotel
grounds. "Siva!" he exclaimed. "See who comes!"</p>

<p>The girl gasped in astonishment. "It cannot be!" she exclaimed.
"And yet it is. What luck! What wonderful luck!" Her eyes shone
with something more than the light of excitement.</p>

<p>The Gregory party, immersed in conversation, were oblivious to
the approach of Tarzan and Ogabi until the latter stood beside
their table. Then d'Arnot looked up and leaped to his feet.
"Greetings, mon ami!" he cried.</p>

<p>As Helen Gregory looked up into the ape-man's face, her eyes
went wide in astonishment and incredulity. Gregory looked
stunned.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, Paul?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes, but first let me introduce&mdash;why, Miss Gregory! What
is wrong?"</p>

<p>"It is Brian," said the girl in a tense whisper, "and yet it is
not Brian."</p>

<p>"No," d'Arnot assured her, "it is not your brother. This is
Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>"A most remarkable resemblance," said Gregory, as he rose and
offered his hand to the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Lal Taask," said Magra, "it is he. That is Brian Gregory."</p>

<p>"You are right," agreed Lal Taask. "After all these months that
we have been planning, he walks right into our arms. We must get
him to Atan Thome at once&mdash;but how?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," said the girl. "I have a plan. Fortunately, he
has not seen us yet. He would never come if he had, for he has no
reason to trust us. Come! We'll go inside; then call a boy, and
I'll send him a note."</p>

<p>As Tarzan, d'Arnot, and the Gregorys conversed, a boy approached
and handed a note to the ape-man. The latter glanced through it.
"There must be some mistake," he said; "this must be meant for
someone else."</p>

<p>"No, bwana," said the boy. "She say give it big bwana in loin
cloth. No other bwana in loin cloth."</p>

<p>"Says she wants to see me in little salon next to the entrance,"
said Tarzan to d'Arnot. "Says it's very urgent. It's signed, 'An
old friend'; but of course it must be a mistake. I'll go and
explain."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Tarzan," laughed d'Arnot; "you're used only to the
wilds of Africa, not to the wiles of women."</p>

<p>"Which are supposed to be far more dangerous," said Helen,
smiling.</p>

<p>A slow smile lighted the face of the Lord of the Jungle as he
looked down into the beautiful eyes of the girl. "That is easy to
believe," he said. "I think I should warn d'Arnot."</p>

<p>"Oh, what Frenchman needs schooling in the ways of women?"
demanded Helen. "It is the women who should be protected."</p>

<p>"He is very nice," she said to d'Arnot, after Tarzan had left;
"but I think that one might be always a little afraid of him. There
is something quite grim about him, even when he smiles."</p>

<p>"Which is not often," said d'Arnot, "and I have never heard him
laugh. But no one who is honorable need ever be afraid of
Tarzan."</p>

<p>As Tarzan entered the small salon he saw a tall, svelte brunette
standing by a table at one side of the room. What he did not see
was the eye of Lal Taask at the crack of a door in the opposite
wall.</p>

<p>"A boy brought me this note," said Tarzan. "There is some
mistake. I don't know you, and you don't know me."</p>

<p>"There is no mistake, Brian Gregory," said Magra. "You cannot
fool such an old friend as I."</p>

<p>Unsmiling, the ape-man's steady gaze took the girl in from head
to foot; then he turned to leave the room. Another might have
paused to discuss the matter, for Magra was beautiful; but not
Tarzan&mdash;he had said all that there was to say, as far as he
was concerned.</p>

<p>"Wait, Brian Gregory!" snapped Magra. "You are too impetuous.
You are not going now."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned back, sensing a threat in her tone. "And why not?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Because it would be dangerous. Lal Taask is directly behind
you. His pistol is almost touching your back. You are coming
upstairs with me like an old friend, arm in arm; and Lal Taask will
be at your back. A false move, and&mdash;poof! you are dead."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Why not?" he thought. In some way these two
were concerning themselves with the affairs of the Gregorys, and
the Gregorys were d'Arnot's friends. Immediately the ape-man's
sympathies were enlisted upon the side of the Gregorys. He took
Magra's arm. "Where are we going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To see another old friend, Brian Gregory," smiled Magra.</p>

<p>They had to cross the terrace to reach the stairway leading to
the second floor of another wing of the hotel, Magra smiling and
chatting gaily, Lal Taask walking close behind; but now his pistol
was in his pocket. D'Arnot looked up at them in surprise as they
passed.</p>

<p>"Ah, so it was an old friend," remarked Helen.</p>

<p>D'Arnot shook his head. "I do not like the looks of it," he
said.</p>

<p>"You have changed, Brian Gregory," said Magra, smiling up at
him, as they ascended the stairway. "And I think I like you
better."</p>

<p>"What is this all about?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Your memory shall soon be refreshed, my friend," replied the
girl. "Down this hall is a door, behind the door is a man."</p>

<p>At the door they halted, and Magra knocked.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" inquired a voice from the interior of the room.</p>

<p>"It is I, Magra, with Lal Taask and a friend," replied the
girl.</p>

<p>The voice bade them enter, and as the door swung open, Tarzan
saw a plump, greasy, suave appearing Eurasian sitting at a table at
one side of an ordinary hotel room. The man's eyes were mere slits,
his lips thin. Tarzan's eyes took in the entire room with a single
glance. There was a window at the opposite end; at the left, across
the room from the man, was a dresser; beside it a closed door,
which probably opened into an adjoining room to form a suite.</p>

<p>"I have found him at last, Atan Thome," said Magra.</p>

<p>"Ah, Brian Gregory!" exclaimed Thome. "I am glad to see you
again&mdash;shall I say 'my friend'?"</p>

<p>"I am not Brian Gregory," said Tarzan, "and of course you know
it. Tell me what you want."</p>

<p>"You are Brian Gregory, and I can understand that you would wish
to deny it to me," sneered Thome; "and, being Brian Gregory, you
know what I want. I want directions to the city of Ashair&mdash;the
Forbidden City. You wrote those directions down; you made a map; I
saw you. It is worth ten thousand pounds to me&mdash;that is my
offer."</p>

<p>"I have no map. I never heard of Ashair," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>Atan Thome's face registered an almost maniacal rage as he spoke
rapidly to Lal Taask in a tongue that neither Tarzan nor Magra
understood. The East Indian, standing behind Tarzan, whipped a long
knife from beneath his coat.</p>

<p>"Not that, Atan Thome!" cried Magra.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded the man. "The gun would make too much noise.
Lal Taask's knife will do the work quietly. If Gregory will not
help us, he must not live to hinder us. Strike, Lal Taask!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"I CANNOT understand," said d'Arnot, "why Tarzan
went with those two. It is not like him. If ever a man were wary of
strangers, it is he."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were not strangers," suggested Helen. "He seemed
on the best of terms with the woman. Didn't you notice how gay and
friendly she appeared?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied d'Arnot, "I did; but I also noticed Tarzan.
Something strange is going on. I do not like it."</p>

<p>Even as d'Arnot was speaking, Tarzan, swift as Ara, the
lightning, wheeled upon Lal Taask before the knife hand struck;
and, seizing the man, lifted him above his head, while Atan Thome
and Magra shrank back against the wall in stark amazement. They
gasped in horror, as Tarzan hurled Lal Taask heavily to the
floor.</p>

<p>Tarzan fixed his level gaze upon Atan Thome. "You are next," he
said.</p>

<p>"Wait, Brian Gregory," begged Thome, backing away from the
ape-man and dragging Magra with him. "Let us reason."</p>

<p>"I do not reason with murderers," replied Tarzan. "I kill."</p>

<p>"I only wish to frighten you, not to kill you," explained Atan
Thome, as he continued to edge his way along the wall around the
room, holding tightly to Magra's hand.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Because you have something I want&mdash;a route map to Ashair,"
replied Thome.</p>

<p>"I have no map," said Tarzan, "and once again I tell you that I
never heard of Ashair. What is at Ashair that you want?"</p>

<p>"Why quibble, Brian Gregory?" snapped Atan Thome. "You know as
well as I do that what we both want in Ashair is The Father of
Diamonds. Will you work with me, or shall you continue to lie?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "I don't know what you're talking about," he
said.</p>

<p>"All right, you fool," growled Thome. "If you won't work with
me, you'll not live to work against me." He whipped a pistol from a
shoulder holster and levelled it at the ape-man. "Take this!"</p>

<p>"You shan't!" cried Magra, striking the weapon up as Thome
pressed the trigger; "you shall not kill Brian Gregory!"</p>

<p>Tarzan could not conceive what impelled this strange woman to
intercede in his behalf, nor could Atan Thome, as he cursed her
bitterly and dragged her through the doorway into the adjoining
room before Tarzan could prevent him.</p>

<p>At the sound of the shot, d'Arnot, on the terrace below, leaped
to his feet. "I knew it," he cried. "I knew there was something
wrong."</p>

<p>Gregory and Helen rose to follow him. "Stay here, Helen,"
Gregory commanded; "we don't know what's going on up there."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Dad," replied the girl; "I'm coming with
you."</p>

<p>Long experience had taught Gregory that the easiest way to
control his daughter was to let her have her own way, inasmuch as
she would have it anyway.</p>

<p>D'Arnot was in the upper hall calling Tarzan's name aloud by the
time the Gregorys caught up with him, "I can't tell which room," he
said.</p>

<p>"We'll have to try them all," suggested Helen.</p>

<p>Again d'Arnot called out to Tarzan, and this time the ape-man
replied. A moment later the three stepped into the room from which
his voice had come to see him trying to open a door in the left
hand wall.</p>

<p>"What happened?" demanded d'Arnot, excitedly.</p>

<p>"A fellow tried to shoot me," explained Tarzan. "The woman who
sent me the note struck up his gun; then he dragged her into that
room and locked the door."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"I am going to break down the door and go in after him," replied
the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather dangerous?" asked Gregory. "You say the
fellow is armed."</p>

<p>For answer Tarzan hurled his weight against the door and sent it
crashing into the next room. The ape-man leaped across the
threshold. The room was vacant. "They've gone," he said.</p>

<p>"Stairs lead from that verandah to the service court in the rear
of the hotel," said d'Arnot. "If we hurry, we might overtake
them."</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan; "let them go. We have Lal Taask. We can learn
about the others from him." They turned back to re-enter the room
they had just quitted. "We'll question him, and he'll answer."
There was a grimness about his tone that, for some reason, made
Helen think of a lion.</p>

<p>"If you didn't kill him," qualified d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Evidently I didn't," replied the ape-man; "he's gone!"</p>

<p>"How terribly mysterious!" exclaimed Helen Gregory.</p>

<p>The four returned to their table on the terrace, all but Tarzan
a little nervous and excited. Helen Gregory was thrilled. Here were
mystery and adventure. She had hoped to find them in Africa, but
not quite so far from the interior. Romance was there, too, at her
elbow, sipping a cool drink; but she did not know it. Over the rim
of his glass d'Arnot inspected her profile for the thousandth
time.</p>

<p>"What did the woman look like?" Helen asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Taller than you, very black hair, slender, quite handsome,"
replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>Helen nodded. "She was sitting at that table at the end of the
terrace before you came," she said. "A very foreign looking man was
with her."</p>

<p>"That must have been Lal Taask," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"She was a very striking looking girl," continued Helen. "Why in
the world do you suppose she lured you to that room and then ended
up by saving your life?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "I know why she lured me to the room, but I
don't understand why she struck up Atan Thome's hand to save
me."</p>

<p>"What did they want of you?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"They think I am Brian Gregory, and they want a map of the route
to Ashair&mdash;The Forbidden City. According to them The Father
of Diamonds is there. They say your brother made such a map. Do you
know anything about it? Is this safari of yours just for the
purpose of finding The Father of Diamonds?" His last query was
addressed to Gregory.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about any Father of Diamonds," replied Gregory.
"My only interest is in finding my son."</p>

<p>"And you have no map?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Helen, "we have a very rough map that Brian drew and
enclosed in the last letter we received from him. He never
suspected that we'd have any use for it, and it was more by way of
giving us an idea of where he was than anything else. It may not
even be accurate, and it is certainly most sketchy. I kept it,
however; and I still have it in my room."</p>

<p>"When the boy brought you the note," said d'Arnot, "you had just
asked me why I had sent for you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I was here in Loango on a special mission and met Monsieur and
Mam'selle Gregory," explained d'Arnot. "I became very much
interested in their problem; and when they asked me if I knew of
any one who might help them find Ashair, I thought immediately of
you. I do not mean that I should venture to ask you to accompany
them, but I know of no one in Africa better fitted to recommend a
suitable man to take charge of their safari."</p>

<p>That half smile that d'Arnot knew so well, and which was more of
the eyes than of the lips, lighted Tarzan's face momentarily. "I
understand, Paul," he said. "I will take charge of their
safari."</p>

<p>"But that is such an imposition," exclaimed Helen. "We could
never ask you to do that."</p>

<p>"I think it will be interesting," said Tarzan&mdash;"since I
have met Magra and Lal Taask and Atan Thome. I should like to meet
them again. I think if I remain with you our paths shall
cross."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"Have you made any preparations?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Our safari is being gathered in Bonga," replied Gregory; "and I
had tentatively employed a white hunter named Wolff to take charge
of it, but of course now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he will come along as a hunter, we can use him," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He is coming to the hotel in the morning. We can talk with him
then. I know nothing about him, other than that he had some rather
good references."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Behind Wong Feng's shop is a heavily curtained room. A red
lacquer Buddha rests in a little shrine. There are some excellent
bronzes, a couple of priceless screens, a few good vases; the rest
is a hodge podge of papier-mâché, cheap cloisonné, and soapstone.
The furniture is of teak, falling apart after the manner of Chinese
furniture. Heavy hangings cover the only window, and the air is
thick with incense&mdash;sticky, cloying. Atan Thome is there and
Magra. The man is coldly, quietly furious.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?" he demanded. "Why did you strike up my
gun?"</p>

<p>"Because," commenced Magra; then she stopped.</p>

<p>"'Because!' 'Because!'" he mimicked. "The eternal feminine. But
you know what I do to traitors!" He wheeled on her suddenly. "Do
you love Gregory?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied, "but that is my own affair. What
concerns us now is getting to Ashair and getting The Father of
Diamonds. The Gregorys are going there. That means they haven't the
diamond, and that they do have a map. You know that Brian made a
map. You saw him. We must get it, and I have a plan. Listen!" She
came and leaned close to Thome and whispered rapidly.</p>

<p>The man listened intently, his face lighting with approval.
"Splendid, my dear," he exclaimed. "Lal Taask shall do it tomorrow,
if he has recovered sufficiently. Wong Feng's working on him now.
But if that fails, we still have Wolff."</p>

<p>"If he lands the job," said Magra. "Let's have a look at Lal
Taask."</p>

<p>They stepped into a small bedroom adjoining the room in which
they had been talking. A Chinese was brewing something in a kettle
over an oil lamp. Lal Taask lay on a narrow cot. He looked up as
the two entered.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling?" asked Atan Thome.</p>

<p>"Better, Master," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Him all light mollow," assured Wong Feng.</p>

<p>"How in the world did you escape?" asked Magra.</p>

<p>"I just pretended to be unconscious," replied Lal Taask, "and
when they went into the next room, I crawled into a closet and hid.
After dark I managed to get down into the back court and come here.
I thought I was going to die though. I can almost believe that man
when he says he's not Brian Gregory, unless he's developed an awful
lot of strength since we saw him last."</p>

<p>"He's Brian Gregory all right," said Thome.</p>

<p>Wong poured a cupful of the concoction he had brewed and handed
it to Lal Taask. "Dlink!" he said.</p>

<p>Lal Taask took a sip, made a wry face, and spat it out. "I can't
drink that nasty stuff," he said. "What's in it?&mdash;dead
cats?"</p>

<p>"Only li'l bit dead cat," said Wong. "You dlink!"</p>

<p>"No," said Lal Taask; "I'd just as soon die."</p>

<p>"Drink it," said Atan Thome.</p>

<p>Like a whipped cur, Lal Taask raised the cup to his lips and,
gagging and choking, drained it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE Gregorys, with Tarzan and d'Arnot, were
breakfasting on the terrace the next morning, when Wolff arrived.
Gregory introduced him to Tarzan. "One o' them wildmen," observed
Wolff, noting Tarzan's loin cloth and primitive weapons. "I seen
another one once, but he ran around on all fours and barked like a
dog. You taking it with us, Mr. Gregory?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan will be in full charge of the safari," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Wolff. "That's my job."</p>

<p>"It was," said Tarzan. "If you want to come along as a hunter,
there's a job open for you."</p>

<p>Wolff thought for a moment. "I'll come," he said. "Mr. Gregory's
goin' to need me plenty."</p>

<p>"We're leaving for Bonga on the boat tomorrow," said Tarzan. "Be
there. Until then we shan't need you."</p>

<p>Wolff walked off grumbling to himself.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you've made an enemy of him," said Gregory.</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "I did nothing to him," he said, "but give him
a job. He'll bear watching, though."</p>

<p>"I do not care for that fellow's looks," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"He has good recommendations," insisted Gregory.</p>

<p>"But he is, obviously, no gentleman," said Helen.</p>

<p>Her father laughed good-naturedly. "But we are hiring a hunter,"
he said. "Whom did you expect me to sign on, the Duke of
Windsor?"</p>

<p>"I could have stood it," laughed Helen.</p>

<p>"Wolff has only to obey orders and shoot straight," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He's coming back," announced d'Arnot, and the others looked up
to see Wolff approaching.</p>

<p>"I got to thinking," he said to Gregory, "that I ought to know
just where we're goin'; so I could help lay out the route. You see,
we gotta be careful we don't get out o' good game country. You got
a map?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Gregory. "Helen, you had it. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the top drawer of my dresser."</p>

<p>"Come on up, Wolff; and we'll have a look at it," said
Gregory.</p>

<p>Gregory went directly to his daughter's room; and Wolff
accompanied him, while the others remained on the terrace,
chatting. The older man searched through the upper drawer of
Helen's dresser for a moment, running through several papers, from
among which he finally selected one.</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said, and spread it on a table before
Wolff.</p>

<p>The hunter studied it for several minutes; then he shook his
head. "I know the country part way," he said, "but I ain't never
heard of none of these places up here&mdash;Tuen-Baka, Ashair." He
pointed them out with a stubby forefinger. "Lemme take the map," he
said, "and study it. I'll bring it back tomorrow."</p>

<p>Gregory shook his head. "You'll have plenty of time to study it
with Tarzan and the rest of us on the boat to Bonga," he said; "and
it's too precious&mdash;it means too much to me&mdash;to let out of
my hands. Something might happen to it." He walked back to the
dresser and replaced the map in the upper drawer.</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Wolff. "It don't make no difference, I guess. I
just wanted to help all I could."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Gregory; "I appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Well then," said Wolff, "I'll be running along. See you at the
boat tomorrow."</p>

<p>Captain Paul d'Arnot, being of an inventive turn of mind,
discovered various reasons why he should remain in the vicinity of
Helen Gregory the remainder of the morning. Luncheon was
easy&mdash;he simply invited the Gregorys and Tarzan to be his
guests; but when the meal was over, he lost her.</p>

<p>"If we're leaving for Bonga tomorrow," she said, "I'm going to
do some shopping right now."</p>

<p>"Not alone?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Alone," she replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"Do you think it quite safe? a white woman alone," he asked.
"I'll be more than glad to go with you."</p>

<p>Helen laughed. "No man around while I'm shopping&mdash;unless he
wants to pay the bills. Goodbye!"</p>

<p>Loango's bazaar lay along a narrow, winding street, crowded with
Negroes, Chinese, East Indians, and thick with dust. It was an
unsavory place of many odors&mdash;all strange to occidental
nostrils and generally unpleasant. There were many jutting corners
and dark doorways; and as Helen indulged the feminine predilection
for shopping for something to shop for, Lal Taask, slithering from
corner to doorway, followed relentlessly upon her trail.</p>

<p>As she neared the shop of Wong Feng, she stopped before another
stall to examine some trinkets that had attracted her eye; and
while she was thus engaged, Lal Taask slipped past behind her and
entered the shop of Wong Feng.</p>

<p>Helen dawdled a few moments before the stall; and then,
unconscious of impending danger, approached the shop of Wong Feng;
while, from the interior, Lal Taask watched her as a cat might
watch a mouse. The girl was entirely off her guard, her mind
occupied with thoughts of her shopping and anticipation of the
adventurous expedition in search of her missing brother; so that
she was stunned into momentary inaction and helplessness as Lal
Taask seized her as she was passing the shop of Wong Feng and
dragged her through the doorway into the dark interior&mdash;but
only for a moment. When she realized her danger, she struggled and
struck at her assailant. She tried to scream for help; but the man
clapped a palm roughly over her mouth, stifling her cries, even
though they would have brought no help in this vicious
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Lal Taask was a wiry, powerful man; and Helen soon realized the
futility of struggling against him, as he dragged her toward the
rear of the shop.</p>

<p>"Come quietly," he said, "and you will not be harmed."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" she asked, as he removed his palm from
across her mouth.</p>

<p>"There is one here who would question you," replied Lal Taask.
"It is not for me to explain&mdash;the master will do that.
Whatever he advises will be for your own good&mdash;obey him in all
things."</p>

<p>At the far end of the shop Lal Taask opened a door and ushered
Helen into the dimly lighted room that we have seen before. Magra
was standing at one side; and Helen recognized her as the woman who
had lured Tarzan to the hotel room where, but for her, he would
have been killed. The plump Eurasian sitting at the desk and facing
her, she had never before seen; and now, for the first time, she
saw the face of the man who had seized her, and recognized him as
the hotel companion of the woman.</p>

<p>"You are Helen Gregory?" asked the man at the desk.</p>

<p>"Yes. Who are you, and what do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," said Atan Thome suavely, "let me assure
you that I deeply regret the necessity for this seeming
discourtesy. Your brother has something that I want. He would not
listen to reason; so there was no other alternative than
force."</p>

<p>"My brother? You have not talked with him. He is lost somewhere
in the interior."</p>

<p>"Don't lie to me," snapped Thome. "I know your brother well. I
was with him on the first expedition. He reached Ashair and made a
map of the vicinity, but he would not let me have a copy. He wanted
The Father of Diamonds all for himself. It is the route map to
Ashair that I want, and I shall hold you until I get it."</p>

<p>Helen laughed in his face. "Your intrigue and melodrama have
been quite unnecessary," she said. "All that you would have had to
do would have been to ask my father for the map. He would have let
you make a copy of it. If this man will come back to the hotel with
me, he can copy the map now." She indicated Lal Taask with a
nod.</p>

<p>Atan Thome sneered. "You think you can trap me as easily as
that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Helen made a gesture of resignation. "Go on with your play
acting if you must," she said, "but it will only waste time and get
everyone in trouble. What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"I wish you to write and sign the note I shall dictate to your
father," replied Thome. "If that doesn't bring the map, he'll never
see you again. I'm leaving for the interior immediately, and I
shall take you with me. There are sultans there who will pay a good
price for you."</p>

<p>"You must be quite insane to think that you can frighten me with
any such wild threats. Those things are not done today, you know,
outside of story books. Hurry up and dictate your note; and I'll
promise you'll have the map back as quickly as your messenger can
bring it, but what assurance have I that you'll keep your end of
the bargain and release me?"</p>

<p>"You have only my word," replied Atan Thome, "but I can assure
you that I have no wish to harm you. The map is all I wish. Come
and sit here while I dictate."</p>

<p>As the sun sank into the west behind tall trees and the shadows
lengthened to impart to Loango the semblance of a softened beauty
which the squalid little village did not possess in its own right,
the three men discussing the details of the forthcoming safari
became suddenly aware of the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>"I wonder what can be keeping Helen," said Gregory; "it's almost
dark. I don't like to have her out so late in a place like this.
She should have been back long ago."</p>

<p>"She should never have gone alone," said d'Arnot. "It is not
safe here for a woman."</p>

<p>"It is not," agreed Tarzan. "It is never safe where there is
civilization."</p>

<p>"I think we should go and look for her," suggested d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan, "you and I. Mr. Gregory should remain here
in case she returns."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Monsieur Gregory," said d'Arnot, as he and Tarzan
left the room; "I'm sure we'll find her safe and sound in some
curio shop," but his words were only to reassure Gregory. In his
heart was only fear.</p>

<p>As he waited, Gregory tried to convince himself that there was
nothing to worry about. He tried to read, but could not fix his
mind upon the book. After he had reread one sentence half a dozen
times without grasping its sense, he gave up; then he commenced to
pace the floor, smoking one cigar after another. He was on the
point of starting out himself to search when d'Arnot returned.
Gregory looked at him eagerly.</p>

<p>D'Arnot shook his head. "No luck," he said. "I found a number of
shop keepers who recalled seeing her, but none who knew when she
left the bazaar."</p>

<p>"Where is Tarzan?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"He is investigating in the village. If the natives have any
knowledge of her, Tarzan will get it out of them. He speaks their
language in every sense of the term."</p>

<p>"Here he is now," said Gregory as the ape-man entered the
room.</p>

<p>Both men looked up at him questioningly. "You didn't find any
trace of her?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "None. In the jungle, I could have found
her; but here&mdash;here, in civilization, a man cannot even find
himself."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, a window pane crashed behind them; and a
missile fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" cried d'Arnot. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Gregory. "It may be a bomb."</p>

<p>"No," said Tarzan, "it is just a note tied to a stone. Here,
let's have a look at it."</p>

<p>"It must be about Helen," said Gregory, taking the note from
Tarzan's hand. "Yes, it is. It's from her. Listen! 'Dear Dad: The
people who are holding me want Brian's road map to Ashair. They
threaten to take me into the interior and sell me if they don't get
it. I believe they mean it. Tie the map to stone and throw it out
window. Do not follow their messenger, or they will kill me. They
promise to return me unharmed as soon as they get the map.' Yes,
it's from Helen all right, it's her handwriting. But the fools!
They could have had the map for the asking. I only want to find
Brian. I'll get the map."</p>

<p>He rose and went into Helen's room, which adjoined his. They
heard him strike a match to light a lamp, and then give vent to an
exclamation of astonishment that brought the other two men into the
room. Gregory was standing before the open upper drawer of the
dresser, his face white.</p>

<p>"It's gone," he said. "Some one has stolen the map!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN a squalid room, Wolff sat at a table
laboriously wielding a pencil by the light of a kerosene
lamp&mdash;evidently an unaccustomed task. Every time he made a
mark, he wet the tip of the pencil on his tongue, which, in the
interims, he chewed. At last his work was completed; and as he eyed
it, not without pride, he heaved a sigh and rose.</p>

<p>"I guess this ain't a pretty night's work or anything!" he
soliloquized complacently. "Now they'll both pay&mdash;and
how!"</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Atan Thome sat alone in the back room of Wong Feng's shop. If he
were nervous, the only outward indication of it was the innumerable
cigarettes that he smoked. Magra was guarding Helen in the little
bedroom adjoining. All three were waiting for the return of Lal
Taask with the route map to Ashair. Helen, alone, was positive that
it would be forthcoming. The others only hoped.</p>

<p>"Will he let me go when the map comes?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"He may have to keep you until he can get safely away," replied
Magra, "but I'm sure he will let you go then."</p>

<p>"Poor Dad," said the girl. "He'll be worrying terribly. If
there's going to be any delay about my release, I'd like to write
him another note."</p>

<p>"I'll try and arrange it," said Magra. "I'm very sorry about all
this, Miss Gregory," she added after a short silence. "I am really
quite as helpless in the matter as you, for reasons which I may not
explain; but I may tell you that Atan Thome is obsessed by this
desire to possess The Father of Diamonds. At heart he is not a bad
man, but I know that he will stop at nothing to realize this one
desire; so I hope your father sends the map."</p>

<p>"You really think that he would sell me in the interior if he
didn't get it?" demanded the American girl.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," replied Magra. "If he were pressed, he might kill
you."</p>

<p>Helen shuddered. "I am glad that he is going to get the map,"
she said.</p>

<p>Lal Taask opened the door to the back room of Wong Feng's shop,
and entered. Atan Thome looked up. "Well?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"They threw it out all right," said Taask; "here it is." He
handed the paper to Thome. It was still wrapped around the stone.
Thome opened it and read. His face turned dark.</p>

<p>"Is it the map?" asked Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"No," growled Thome. "They say the map has been stolen. They
lie! They can't fool Atan Thome, though. They'll never see the girl
again, and I'll find Ashair without their map. Listen! There is
someone at the door. See who it is."</p>

<p>Lal Taask opened the door a crack and looked out. "It is Wolff,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Bring him in."</p>

<p>"Nice evening," said Wolff, as he entered the room.</p>

<p>"You didn't come here to tell me that," said Thome. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"What would you give for the route map to Ashair?" asked
Wolff.</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds," replied Thome.</p>

<p>"Not enough. Make it a thousand and a half interest in the
diamond, and I'll get the map for you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I already have it. I stole it from the girl's room."</p>

<p>"Have you got it here?" inquired Thome.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Wolff, "but don't try any funny business. I left
a note with the old woman I'm stopping with. If I'm not back in an
hour, she'll take it to the police."</p>

<p>"Let's see the map," said Thome.</p>

<p>Wolff took it from his pocket and held it up in front of the
other man, but not near enough for him to snatch it. "Fork over the
money, and the map's yours," he said.</p>

<p>Atan Thome drew a thick wallet from an inner pocket and counted
out a thousand pounds in Bank of England notes.</p>

<p>"If I had that roll of yours I wouldn't be riskin' my neck
lookin' for no Father of Diamonds," said Wolff, as he took the
notes and stuffed them in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Are you still going along with the Gregory safari?" asked
Thome.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Wolff; "a poor man's got to work; but I'm goin'
to be right with you when you get that diamond. I'm goin' to have
my half."</p>

<p>"You can do something more to help me," said Thome, "that will
also make the diamond safer for us."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Wolff, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have Magra try to go along with the Gregorys. You
may be able to help in that. I want her to make friends with
them&mdash;and make love to Brian Gregory; then if anything goes
wrong she'll have some influence with them. I don't want to hang,
and neither do you."</p>

<p>"Where do I come in?" asked Wolff.</p>

<p>"You go along and lead them off onto a wrong trail. When they're
good and lost, bring Magra up toward Ashair. You've seen the map;
so you'll know about where to go. You'll find one of my old camps
and wait there for me. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you'll do it?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Why not?"</p>

<p>"All right. Now go along. I'll be seeing you up around Ashair in
a couple of months."</p>

<p>After Wolff had left, Thome turned to Lal Taask. "We've got to
get out of here tonight," he said. "Go down to the river and bribe
the captain of that boat to get up steam and leave for Bonga
tonight."</p>

<p>"You are very clever, Master," said Lal Taask. "You will let the
young lady go, now that you have the map?"</p>

<p>"No. They didn't give me the map. They may catch up with us; and
if they do, it will be just as well to have a hostage."</p>

<p>"Again, Master&mdash;you are clever."</p>

<p>It was past midnight when Atan Thome went aboard the river
steamer with Lal Taask and Helen. At the gangplank he bid Magra
goodbye. "Join the Gregory safari by any ruse," he directed. "They
may reach Ashair, and I want some one with them I can trust. I must
be prepared for any eventuality. If they should beat me to it and
get the diamond, you must find some way to communicate with me. You
may even get an opportunity to steal the diamond. Watch Wolff. I
don't trust him. He has agreed to lead them astray and then bring
you up toward Ashair to meet me when I come out. It's a good thing
you're in love with Brian Gregory. That will help. Work it for all
its worth. I didn't like the idea at first; but when I got to
thinking about it, I saw where we could make use of it. Now,
goodbye; and remember all I have told you."</p>

<p>Taask and Helen had boarded the steamer, the man walking very
close to the girl, his pistol pressed against her side, lest she
make an outcry.</p>

<p>"I think you are very foolish not to set her free," said
Magra.</p>

<p>"I can't now," replied Thome&mdash;"not until after you have
left the Gregory party. Can't you see?"</p>

<p>"Well, see that no harm comes to her&mdash;remember the arm of
English law is long." Then Magra turned and walked back into the
village.</p>

<p>After a sleepless night of searching for Helen, Gregory, Tarzan,
and d'Arnot were gathered in Gregory's room to formulate their
plans.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's nothing left to do but notify the
authorities," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right," agreed Gregory. "I was so afraid
they'd kill her if we notified the police, but now there seems to
be nothing else to do."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and the three men looked up.
"Come in!" said Gregory.</p>

<p>The door swung slowly open, and Magra stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed d'Arnot.</p>

<p>She paid no attention to him, but looked straight at Tarzan.
"Brian Gregory," she said, "I have come to help you find your
sister."</p>

<p>"What do you know about her? Where is she?" demanded
Gregory.</p>

<p>"Atan Thome is taking her into the interior. He left for Bonga
on the river boat last night."</p>

<p>"But the boat doesn't sail until today," interrupted
d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Atan Thome bribed the captain to sail last night," Magra
explained. "I was to have gone, but&mdash;well, why I didn't is
immaterial."</p>

<p>"This woman is not to be trusted," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You can trust me&mdash;always, Brian Gregory." She turned to
Gregory. "If you doubt me, keep me with you&mdash;as a hostage,
perhaps. It is possible that I may be able to help you."</p>

<p>Gregory appeared not to hear her. He seemed stunned. "Both my
children," he said. "First Brian, now Helen, sacrificed&mdash;and
for what?"</p>

<p>"Do not despair, Monsieur Gregory," said d'Arnot. "There must be
a way."</p>

<p>"But how?" demanded the older man. "In four days Thome will be
in Bonga. The boat will lie there at least one day. Coming back
with the current, she will make the return trip in two and a half
days, perhaps. Even if we can persuade the captain to return to
Bonga immediately Thome will have had six or seven days start of
us. He will be far into the interior. He probably has the map that
was stolen from Helen's room. We have none. We will not know where
to look for him."</p>

<p>"Do not worry on that score," urged d'Arnot. "If Thome is in
Africa, Tarzan of the Apes will find him."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Gregory, dully, "but what will have happened to my
poor girl in the mean time?"</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed d'Arnot. "I have it! There is yet a way. We
have a naval seaplane here. I'm sure the authorities will fly us to
Bonga. We shall be there when Monsieur Thome lands. What a surprise
for Monsieur Thome, eh?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" cried Gregory. "How can I ever thank you,
Captain?"</p>

<p>Whatever her reaction, Magra's face showed no emotion.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT d'Arnot's request, the authorities were glad to
co-operate and, with a delay of only a couple of hours, the party
was boarding a seaplane anchored in the river. Magra's expression
suggested utmost self-satisfaction, as d'Arnot helped her aboard
from the native canoe that had brought the party from shore. Wolff,
who had never flown, swaggered a bit to hide his inward
perturbation. Ogabi's eyes rolled fearfully.</p>

<p>"You see how easily everything was arranged?" exclaimed
d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Thanks to you," replied Gregory.</p>

<p>"How long will it take you to fly to Bonga, Lieutenant?" Tarzan
asked the pilot.</p>

<p>"Between two and three hours," replied Lavac.</p>

<p>"It will take the steamer four days, against the current," said
d'Arnot. "Atan Thome will find a reception committee waiting at the
dock."</p>

<p>As the plane raced up the river into the wind for the take-off,
Ogabi closed his eyes and clutched the seat with both hands. When
he opened his eyes again, he looked down upon the top of a forest.
His face was no longer dark&mdash;it was a sickly ashen color.</p>

<p>"This is no place for man, Bwana, in belly of bird," he said to
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But you are a man, Ogabi," replied the ape-man; "therefore you
are not afraid. Remember that when the storm strikes us."</p>

<p>"What storm?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"A storm is coming," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded Gregory. "There is not a cloud in
the sky."</p>

<p>"Tarzan always knows," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>How Tarzan had known that a storm was approaching, not even he
could have explained. Perhaps he shared with the wild things, by
which and among which he had been raised, a peculiar sensitivity
beyond the appreciation of men. However that may be, a half hour
after he had foretold it, the ship raced into the heart of a
tropical storm.</p>

<p>Lavac, who was accustomed to sudden tropical storms, assumed
that it covered but a small area and would soon be astern of them.
An experienced flier, with a ship equipped with all the instruments
necessary for blind flying, he merely increased his elevation and
flew into it. The ship rolled and tossed, and Ogabi became a few
shades lighter. Wolff clenched his fists until his knuckles were
white.</p>

<p>After an hour of it, Lavac turned and motioned d'Arnot to come
forward. "It's worse than I'd anticipated, Captain," he said. "Had
I better turn back?"</p>

<p>"Got plenty of petrol?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>Lavac nodded. "Yes, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"Everything else all right?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about the compass."</p>

<p>"Then we wouldn't be any better off flying back than going on,"
said d'Arnot. "Let's keep on. We're bound to be out of it sooner or
later."</p>

<p>For two long hours more Lavac bucked the storm; then the engine
spluttered. D'Arnot went forward hurriedly; but before he reached
Lavac's side, the engine caught itself again and was purring
sweetly. It had been a tense moment for these two. D'Arnot breathed
a deep sigh of relief&mdash;and then the engine spluttered again
and stopped. Lavac worked furiously with a hand pump. D'Arnot
turned back toward the cabin.</p>

<p>"Fasten your life belts," he said. "We may have to come
down."</p>

<p>"The line's clogged," said Lavac, "and I can't clear it."</p>

<p>D'Arnot glanced at the altimeter. "You've got about three
thousand meters," he said. "The average elevation in the vicinity
of Bonga is around two hundred. Glide as far as you can, looking
for a hole."</p>

<p>"And if I don't find one?" asked Lavac.</p>

<p>D'Arnot shrugged and grimaced. "You're the pilot," he said, "and
I understand you're a very good one."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Lavac. "It will take a very good pilot to fly
this ship through a forest. I am not that good. Are you going to
tell them?"</p>

<p>"What's the use?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"They might wish to take up some matters with God&mdash;matters
they have been neglecting to discuss with Him."</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" demanded Wolff. "The engine isn't running."</p>

<p>"You have answered your own question," said d'Arnot, walking
back to his seat.</p>

<p>"We're coming down," said Wolff. "He can't see to land. We'll
crash."</p>

<p>"Be calm," admonished d'Arnot; "we have not crashed yet."</p>

<p>The passengers sat in tense expectancy as the ship nosed down
through storm racked clouds.</p>

<p>"What altitude now, Lavac?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Three hundred meters."</p>

<p>"That means we can't be more than three hundred feet from ground
at the best," said Gregory. "I remember looking at a map the other
day. Nearly all this country back here runs about six hundred feet
elevation."</p>

<p>Suddenly Wolff leaped to his feet. "I can't stand it," he cried.
"I'm going to jump!"</p>

<p>Tarzan seized him and threw him back into his seat. "Sit still,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sit still!" snapped d'Arnot. "Is it not bad enough without
that?"</p>

<p>Lavac voiced an exclamation of relief. "We're out of it!" he
cried, "and there's water just below us."</p>

<p>A moment later the ship glided to an easy landing on the bosom
of a little lake. Only the forest and the jungle were there to
welcome it. If there were eyes to see, they remained hidden; and
the voices of the jungle were momentarily stilled. The rain beat
upon the water, and the wind moaned in the forest. Of these things
and of their miraculous escape from death Ogabi was
unconscious&mdash;he had fainted.</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are, Lieutenant?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea," replied Lavac, "&mdash;never saw
this lake before."</p>

<p>"Then we are lost?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>Lavac nodded. "I'm afraid so, sir. My compass wasn't behaving
very well; and then, naturally, we must have been blown way off our
course."</p>

<p>"How lonely and depressing it looks," said Magra.</p>

<p>"It is the jungle," breathed Tarzan, almost as one might say,
"It is home!"</p>

<p>"How discouraging," said Gregory. "Just when it seemed certain
that we had overcome every obstacle and found a way to circumvent
Thome and rescue Helen, this had to happen. Now we are absolutely
helpless. We shall never reach her now, poor child."</p>

<p>"Non! Non! my dear Monsieur Gregory, you must not give up," said
d'Arnot. "This is only a temporary delay. Lieutenant Lavac will
have that fuel line cleared in no time, and as soon as the weather
lifts we'll take off again. We have plenty of time. Thome will not
reach Bonga for three days yet. As soon as the weather clears, the
lieutenant can find Bonga even with no compass at all."</p>

<p>Lavac worked on the fuel line for half an hour; then he called
d'Arnot. "The line was not clogged, sir," he said. He looked
worried.</p>

<p>"Then what was the trouble?" demanded d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"We are out of fuel. The tank must have been leaking badly, as
we had a full load when we left."</p>

<p>"But the reserve tank&mdash;what of that?" demanded d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"It was the reserve tank that leaked, and we have emptied the
other."</p>

<p>D'Arnot shook his head. "That poor little girl!" he said.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">CHAPTER 6</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">OGABI was singing as he grilled antelope steaks
over a fire beside which lay the carcass of the animal. Ogabi's
spirits had been rising for four days, for now he was four marches
away from that horrible bird thing, in the belly of which he had
almost ridden to his death. He had been very fearful that the white
men would decide to return to it and fly again. If they had,
however, he should have run away into the jungle and hidden. Five
white men sat around the fire watching him. "Pretty well convinced
you know where we are now, Tarzan?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm quite certain that we are east of Bonga and a little
south. That buck I killed ranges in that district."</p>

<p>"Thome probably left Bonga today," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"By the time we reach Bonga he'll be many marches ahead of us.
We'll never overtake him."</p>

<p>"We don't have to go to Bonga," said Tarzan. "We can strike out
directly northeast and cut his trail; then we can follow! on faster
than he can travel&mdash;boys with packs will slow him down. We're
not handicapped by anything like that."</p>

<p>"You mean we can travel without porters or provisions?" demanded
Gregory.</p>

<p>"We have been for the last four days," Tarzan reminded him. He
looked quickly about the camp. "Where's Magra?" he asked. "I told
her not to leave camp. This is lion country; and, if I'm right
about the location, it's also cannibal country."</p>

<p>Magra had not meant to go far from the camp; but the forest was
intriguing, and it seemed so quiet and peaceful. She walked slowly,
enjoying the blooms, watching the birds. She stopped before a
lovely orchid, which, like some beautiful woman, sucked the life
blood from the giant that supported it. Presently she recalled
Tarzan's injunction, and turned to retrace her steps to camp. She
did not see the great lion behind her which had caught her scent
and was stalking her on silent, padded feet.</p>

<p>The men in the camp saw Tarzan rise to his feet, his head up,
his nostrils quivering; then, to their amazement, they saw him run
a few steps, swing into a tree, and disappear. They did not know
that Usha, the wind, had brought the acrid scent spoor of Numa, the
lion, to the sensitive nostrils of the ape-man, and that mingled
with it was the delicate scent of the perfume that Magra loved,
revealing to him an impending tragedy and sending him into the
trees in the hope that he would reach the scene in time.</p>

<p>As Magra walked toward camp, an angry snarl from the king of
beasts brought her suddenly about to awareness of the danger that
confronted her. Instantly she realized the hopelessness of her
situation and the futility of calling for help that could not reach
her in time to prevent the inevitable. With her accustomed courage,
she resigned herself to death; but even with death staring her in
the face, she could scarcely restrain an involuntary exclamation of
admiration for the magnificence of the great beast facing her. His
size, his majestic bearing, the sheer ferocity of his snarling mien
thrilled every fiber of her being. She did not want to die, but she
felt that there could be no more noble death than beneath the
mighty fangs and talons of the king of beasts.</p>

<p>Now the lion was creeping toward her, belly to ground, the end
of his tail twitching nervously. Just for a yard or so he came
thus; then he rose, but still crouching a little as he advanced.
Suddenly, with a mighty roar, he charged; and at the same instant a
man leaped from a tree above full upon his back.</p>

<p>"Brian!" she cried, with a gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>The man clung to the back of the carnivore, his growls mingling
with those of the great cat, as he drove his hunting knife again
and again into the tawny side of the leaping, striking beast.
Thrilled and horrified, Magra watched, fascinated, until the
pierced heart ceased forever, and the great beast died. Then Magra
had reason to shudder in real horror, as the Lord of the Jungle
placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill and voiced the victory
cry of the bull ape. Every fiber of the girl's body vibrated to a
new thrill as she watched the man she now knew was not Brian
Gregory.</p>

<p>As the uncanny cry broke the stillness of the jungle, Wolff,
Gregory, and Lavac sprang to their feet. Wolff seized his rifle.
"My God!" he cried. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan has a made a kill," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"The Big Bwana has killed Simba," said Ogabi. "Are the white men
deaf that they did not hear Simba roar?"</p>

<p>"Sure I heard it," said Wolff; "but that wild man never killed
no lion&mdash;he had nothin' but a knife. I'd better go out there
an' look after him." Carrying his rifle, he started in the
direction of the sound that had startled them, Gregory and Lavac
following. "That yell was when the lion got him," said Wolff. "He's
deader'n a smelt right now."</p>

<p>"He doesn't look very dead to me," said Lavac, as Tarzan and
Magra came into view.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I was so out of breath that I didn't&mdash;well,
thank is a most inadequate word under the circumstance; but I can't
think of another&mdash;thank you for saving my life. How silly and
banal that sounds, but you know what I'm trying to say. You were
wonderful, and a little terrifying, too; but I know now that you
are not Brian Gregory. He could not have killed the lion as you
did. No other man in the world could have done it."</p>

<p>She paused. "Until a few minutes ago, I thought that I loved
Brian."</p>

<p>The implication of Magra's words and tone was quite apparent,
yet Tarzan elected to ignore it. "We shall do our best to find
him," he said, "not only on Mr. Gregory's account but on
yours."</p>

<p>Magra shrugged. She was rebuffed, but she could bide her time.
"And the diamond?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in that," said Tarzan.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>A well equipped safari moved toward the northeast ten marches
out of Bonga. A girl and two men were the only whites, but the
porters seemed to be carrying enough equipment and provisions for
two or three times that number.</p>

<p>"Rather clever of me," said one of the men to the girl, "taking
your father's safari. It will take him a week or longer to get
another one together and equip it. By that time we'll be so far
ahead that he'll never overtake us. I should like to see his face
when he reaches Bonga and learns the truth."</p>

<p>"You are about as clever as the late Mr. Dillinger and Baby Face
Nelson," replied Helen, "and you'll end up the same way."</p>

<p>"Who were they?" demanded Thome.</p>

<p>"They were kidnapers and murderers who were also addicted to
grand larceny. If you were not a fool, you'd turn me loose and send
me back to Bonga. You have the map. I can be of no further use to
you. Until I am returned safely to him, my father will never give
up until he finds you. I can't see why you want to hold me any
longer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have taken a liking to you, my dear," replied
Thome.</p>

<p>The girl shuddered at the implication of the man's words. All
the rest of the day she plodded on in silence waiting always for a
chance to escape, but either Atan Thome or Lal Taask was always at
her side. She was spent and weary when they finally made camp, but
much of her weariness was from nervous exhaustion&mdash;all day
long the words of Atan Thome had preyed upon her mind.</p>

<p>After the evening meal, she went to her tent, which had been
pitched across the camp from that occupied by Thome, for the man
knew that while she might attempt to escape by day, she would not
dare to venture the dangers of the forest by night.</p>

<p>Thome and Taask stood talking before the former's tent, Thome's
eyes upon the girl entering hers. The two men had been talking, and
Lal Taask was watching the other intently.</p>

<p>"You are my master, Atan Thome," he said; "but out of loyalty,
your servant must warn you. The girl is white, and the arm of the
white man's power is long. Into the depth of the jungle or to the
frozen wastes of the poles it would reach and drag you back to an
accounting."</p>

<p>"Mind your own affairs," snapped Thome. "I mean the girl no
harm."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that. I do not want the white man's
anger upon me. If you are wise you will do as the girl suggested.
Send her back to Bonga tomorrow."</p>

<p>Atan Thome thought a moment; then he nodded. "Perhaps you are
right," he said. "She shall go back to Bonga tomorrow, if she
wishes."</p>

<p>The two men separated, each going to his own tent; and silence
fell upon the sleeping camp, a single askari, nodding beside the
beast fire, the only suggestion of life within the rude boma that
had been thrown up against the intrusion of predatory beasts.</p>

<p>Presently Atan Thome emerged from his tent. His eyes swept the
camp. Only the askari was in evidence. At sight of Thome, he
simulated an alertness which was, considering the hour and his
inclinations, anachronistic; but he was sufficiently aroused to
watch the white man creep silently across the camp; and when he
understood Atan Thome's evident goal, he grinned. In the distance,
a lion roared. This and the love note of the cicada alone broke the
silence of the night.</p>

<p>Sleepless from nervous apprehension, Helen's mind was filled
with dread and misgiving. The altered attitude of Atan Thome
worried her. Every slightest sound bore a menace to her expectant
ears. Finally she rose from her couch and looked out through the
flap of her tent. Her heart sank as she saw Atan Thome creeping
toward her.</p>

<p>Again a lion roared out of the mysterious void of blackness that
was the jungle night, but a far greater menace lay in the oily man
who parted the flaps at the front of the girl's tent. An aura of
repulsiveness surrounded Thome. The girl had always sensed it,
feeling in his presence as one might in the presence of a
cobra.</p>

<p>Atan Thome pushed the curtains aside and stepped into the tent.
The ingratiating, oily smile upon his lips vanished as he
discovered that it was vacant. He did not know that the girl had
crawled beneath the back wall but a moment before he had entered.
For all he knew she might have been gone an hour or more; but he
was sure that she must be somewhere about the camp, for he could
not imagine that she would have dared the dangers of the jungle
night to escape him. Yet this was what she had done.</p>

<p>Frightened, she groped through the darkness which was only
partly moderated by the newly risen moon. Again the roar of a
hunting lion reverberated through the forest, nearer now; and her
heart sank. Yet she steeled herself and stumbled on, more terrified
by thoughts of the man behind her than of the lion ahead. She hoped
the beast would continue to roar, for in this way she could always
locate its position. If it stopped roaring, that might mean that it
had caught her scent and was stalking her.</p>

<p>By accident she had stumbled upon a game trail, and this she
followed. She thought that it was the back trail toward Bonga, but
it was not. It ran in a more southerly direction, which was,
perhaps, just as well for her, as the lion was on the Bonga trail;
and the sound of its roars receded as she stumbled on through the
forest.</p>

<p>After a night of terror, the girl came to an open plain during
the early morning. When she saw it, she knew that she had missed
the trail to Bonga, for the safari had crossed no plain like this
on its trek from the river town. She realized that she was lost,
and now she had no plan other than to escape from Thome. Her
future, her life lay in the palm of a capricious Fate. How, in this
savage land, it could be other than a cruel Fate, she could not
imagine; yet she must carry on&mdash;and hope.</p>

<p>She was so glad to be out of the forest that she struck out
across the plain toward a range of low hills, ignoring the fact
that while the forest might be gloomy and depressing, it offered
her concealment and escape from many dangers among the branches of
its trees. Behind her lay Thome and the memory of the hunting lion.
It was well for her peace of mind that she did not know what lay
just ahead.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">CHAPTER 7</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CHEMUNGO, son of Mpingu, Chief of the Buiroos, was
hunting with three other warriors for a man-eater which had been
terrorizing the villages of his people. They had tracked him
through the hills to the edge of a plain beyond which lay a forest;
but when they reached a low elevation from which they could survey
the plain, they discovered other quarry than that for which they
were hunting.</p>

<p>"A white woman," said Chemungo; "we shall take her to my
father."</p>

<p>"Wait," counselled a companion; "there will be white men with
guns."</p>

<p>"We can wait and see," agreed Chemungo, "for she comes this way.
Perhaps there are no white men."</p>

<p>"White women do not come here without white men," insisted the
other warrior.</p>

<p>"She may have wandered away from camp and become lost," argued
Chemungo; "these white women are very helpless and very stupid.
See, she has no weapons; so she is not hunting; therefore she must
be lost."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Chemungo is right," admitted the other.</p>

<p>They waited until Helen was well out into the plain; then
Chemungo, leaping to his feet, signalled the others to follow him;
and the three ran toward the white girl, shouting and waving their
spears.</p>

<p>So sudden and so unexpected was the appearance of this new
menace that, for a moment, Helen stood paralyzed by terror, almost
regretting that she had left either Thome or the lion; then she
turned and fled back toward the forest.</p>

<p>Lithe, athletic, the girl seemed in a fair way to outdistance
her pursuers. She felt that if she could reach the forest before
they overtook her, she might elude them entirely. Behind her, the
cries of Chemungo and his fellows were angry cries now, threatening
cries, as they redoubled their efforts to overtake their quarry.
Terror lent wings to the girl's flying feet; and the warriors,
burdened by their spears and shields, were falling behind. Helen,
glancing over her shoulder, felt that escape was almost assured,
when her retreat was suddenly cut off by the appearance of a great
lion which was emerging from the forest directly in front of her.
It was the man-eater.</p>

<p>The pursuing warriors redoubled their shouting; and the lion,
confused, paused momentarily. Now, indeed was the girl faced by a
major dilemma, either horn of which would prove fatal. In an
attempt to escape both, she turned to the right&mdash;a brave but
futile gesture of self-preservation. The moving quarry attracted
the lion, which started in pursuit, while the warriors, apparently
unafraid, raced to intercept him. They might have succeeded had not
Helen tripped and fallen.</p>

<p>As the girl fell, the lion charged and sprang upon her prostrate
form; but the shouts of the warriors and their proximity attracted
his snarling attention before he had mauled her; and as the four
closed in upon him, Chemungo cast his spear. It seemed an act of
temerity rather than of courage; but these were warriors of a
famous lion-hunting clan, well versed in the technique of their
dangerous sport.</p>

<p>Chemungo's spear drove deep into the body of the lion; and,
simultaneously, those of two of his companions; the fourth warrior
held his weapon in reverse. Roaring horribly, the lion abandoned
the girl and charged Chemungo, who threw himself backward upon the
ground, his entire body covered by his great shield, while the
other warriors danced around them, yelling at the top of their
lungs, irritating and confusing the lion; and the fourth warrior
awaited his opportunity to drive home the lethal thrust. It came
presently, and the lion fell with the spear through his savage
heart.</p>

<p>Then Chemungo leaped up and dragged the hapless girl to her
feet. She was too stunned by the frightful ordeal through which she
had passed to feel either fear or relief. She was alive! Later she
was to wonder if it would not have been better had she died.</p>

<p>For hours they dragged her roughly across the plain and through
hills to another valley and a village of thatched huts surrounded
by a palisade; and as they dragged her through the village street,
angry women surrounded them, striking at the girl and spitting upon
her. She showed no fear, but half smiled as she likened them to a
roomful of envious old women in some civilized city, who might have
done likewise but for their inhibitions.</p>

<p>Chemungo took her before his father, Mpingu, the chief. "She was
alone," said Chemungo. "No white man can ever know what we do with
her. The women wish her killed at once."</p>

<p>"I am chief," snapped Mpingu. "We shall kill her tonight," he
added hastily, as he caught the eye of one of his wives. "Tonight
we shall dance&mdash;and feast."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The Gregory safari debouched from a forest at the edge of a
plain which stretched before them, tree dotted, to the foot of a
cone-shaped hill. "I know where we are now," said Tarzan, pointing
at the hill. "We'll have to travel north and west to reach
Bonga."</p>

<p>"If we had grub and porters we wouldn't have to go back,"
volunteered Wolff.</p>

<p>"We've got to go back to Bonga to get on Thome's trail and find
Helen," said Gregory. "If we only had the map, we'd be all right on
that score."</p>

<p>"We don't need no map," said Wolff. "I know the way to
Ashair."</p>

<p>"That's odd," commented Tarzan. "Back in Loango you said you
didn't know the way."</p>

<p>"Well, I know it now," growled Wolff, "and if Gregory wants to
pay me a thousand pounds and cut me in on the diamond, fifty-fifty,
I'll take him to Ashair."</p>

<p>"I think you are a crook," said the ape-man, "but if Gregory
wants to pay you, I'll take him through without porters."</p>

<p>Catching Tarzan entirely off his guard, and without warning,
Wolff knocked the ape-man down. "There can't no damn monkey-man
call me a crook," he cried, whipping his pistol from its holster;
but before he could fire, Magra seized his arm.</p>

<p>"If I were you, Monsieur Wolff," said d'Arnot, "I should run. I
should run very fast&mdash;before Tarzan gets up."</p>

<p>But Tarzan was already up; and before Wolff could escape, he
seized him by the throat and belt and lifted him high above his
head, as though to hurl him to the ground.</p>

<p>"Don't kill him, Tarzan!" cried Gregory, stepping forward. "He
is the only man who can lead us to Ashair. I will pay him what he
asks. He can have the diamond, if there is one. All I want is to
find my daughter and my son. Thome is on his way to Ashair. If
Helen is with him, Wolff offers our only hope of rescuing her."</p>

<p>"As you wish," said the ape-man, dropping Wolff upon the
ground.</p>

<p>The safari crossed the plain and, skirting the foot of the
cone-shaped hill, entered a forest, where camp was made beside a
small stream. It was a most primitive camp, as they had no
equipment&mdash;just rude shelters, a makeshift boma, and a fire.
Magra, being the only woman, fared best. Hers was the largest and
best constructed shelter, the shelters of the men encircling it for
protection. As she stood before it, Wolff passed; and she stopped
him. It was the first opportunity she had had to speak to him alone
since his altercation with Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Wolff, you are a scoundrel," she said. "You promised Atan Thome
you'd lead Gregory off the trail. Now you've sold out to him and
promised to lead him to Ashair. When I tell Atan Thome that&mdash;"
She shrugged. "But you do not know Atan Thome as well as I."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will not tell Atan Thome anything," replied Wolff,
meaningly.</p>

<p>"Don't threaten me," warned the girl. "I'm not afraid of you.
Either of two men would kill you if I said the word. Tarzan would
wring your neck openly. Thome would have some one stick a knife in
your back."</p>

<p>"He might do the same to you, if I told him you were in love
with the monkey-man," shot back Wolff; and Magra flushed.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," she said. "I have to keep on the good side of
these people; and if you had even a semblance of good sense, you'd
do the same."</p>

<p>"I don't want to have nothing to do with that monkey-man,"
growled Wolff. "Me and him ain't in the same class."</p>

<p>"That's obvious," said Magra.</p>

<p>"But with me and you it's different," continued Wolff, ignoring
the implication. "We ought to be more friendly. Don't you know we
could have a swell time if you'd loosen up a bit? I ain't such a
bad fellow when you gets to know me."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that. I was afraid you were."</p>

<p>Wolff knitted his brows. He was trying to digest this when his
attention was attracted to Tarzan. "There goes the monkey-man," he
said. "Look at him swingin' through the trees. You can't tell me he
ain't half monkey."</p>

<p>Magra, tiring of Wolff, walked toward d'Arnot just as Gregory
came up. "Where's Tarzan going?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"To reconnoiter for a native village," replied the Frenchman,
"on the chance we can get some supplies and a few
'boys'&mdash;askaris and porters, and, perhaps, a cook. That would
give Tarzan a chance to go on ahead and search for your
daughter."</p>

<p>As the Lord of the Jungle swung through the trees in search of
some indication of the presence of native habitation his active
mind reviewed the events of the past several weeks. He knew that
three scoundrels were pitted against him&mdash;Thome, Taask, and
Wolff. He could cope with them, but could he cope with Magra? He
could not understand the girl. Twice she had saved him from the
bullets of would-be assassins, yet he knew that she was an
associate, perhaps an accomplice, of Thome. The first time it might
have been because she had thought him to be Brian Gregory, but now
she knew better. It was all quite beyond him. With a shrug, he
dismissed the whole matter from his mind, content to know that he
was forewarned and, consequently, on guard.</p>

<p>The day was coming to a close as Tarzan gave up the search for a
native village and decided to return to camp. Suddenly he stood
erect upon a branch of a great tree, head up, statuesque, alert,
listening. A vagrant breeze had brought to his nostrils the scent
of Wappi, the antelope, suggesting that he take meat back to camp;
but as he prepared to stalk his prey, the booming of distant native
drums came faintly to his ears.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">CHAPTER 8</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS night fell, Helen, lying bound in a filthy hut,
heard the booming of drums in the village street outside. Eerie and
menacing they sounded, mysterious, threatening. She felt that they
were beating for her&mdash;a savage, insistent dirge, foretelling
death. She wondered what form it would take, when it would come to
her. She felt that she might almost welcome it as an escape from
the terror that engulfed her. Presently, warriors came and jerked
her roughly to her feet after removing the bonds that confined her
ankles; then they dragged her out into the village street before
the hut of Mpingu, the chief, and tied her to a stake, while around
her milled screaming women and shouting warriors. In the glare of
the cooking fires the whole scene seemed to the doomed girl the
horrible phantasmagoria of some hideous nightmare from which she
must awaken. It was all too fantastic to be real, but when a spear
point pierced her flesh and warm blood flowed she knew she did not
dream.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>A well equipped safari lay in an ordered camp. Porters and
askaris squatted around tiny cook fires; and before the central
beast fire, two men who were not natives talked with Mbuli, the
headman, while faintly from afar came the sullen sound of native
drums.</p>

<p>"They are at it," said Atan Thome. "Mbuli tells me this is
cannibal country and that we had better get out quickly. Tomorrow
we'll make a long trek toward Ashair. The girl is lost. The drums
may be for her."</p>

<p>"Her blood is on your head, master," said Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"Shut up," snapped Thome. "She is a fool. She might have lived
happily and enjoyed the fruits of The Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>Lal Taask shook his head. "The ways of women are beyond the
comprehension of even thou, master. She was very young and very
beautiful; she loved life; and you took it from her. I warned you,
but you would not heed. Her blood is on your head."</p>

<p>Atan Thome turned irritably away, but the drums followed him to
his tent and would give him no rest.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"The drums!" said d'Arnot. "I do not like them; so often they
spell death for some poor devil. The first time I heard them, I was
tied to a stake; and a lot of painted devils were dancing around me
pricking me with spears. They don't quite kill you at first, they
just torture you and let you live as long as possible so that you
may suffer more, for your suffering is their pleasure."</p>

<p>"But how did you escape?" asked Lavac.</p>

<p>"Tarzan came," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"He has not returned," said Magra. "I am afraid for him. Perhaps
the drums are for him."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they could have gotten him?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"No such luck," snarled Wolff. "The damn monkey has as many
lives as a cat."</p>

<p>D'Arnot turned angrily away; and Gregory, Lavac, and Magra
followed him, leaving Wolff alone, listening to the beating of the
distant drums.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The drums had carried their message to Tarzan. They told him of
impending torture and sacrifice and death. The lives of strangers
meant nothing to the ape-man, who, all his life, had lived with
death. It was something that came to all creatures. He had no fear
of it, he who feared nothing. To avoid it was a game that added
zest to life. To pit his courage, his strength, his agility, his
cunning against Death, and win&mdash;there was the satisfaction.
Some day Death would win, but to that day Tarzan gave no thought.
He could fight or he could run away; and in either event preserve
his self-respect, for only a fool throws his life away uselessly,
and Tarzan had no respect for fools; but if the stake warranted it,
he could lightly accept the gravest risks.</p>

<p>As he heard the drums against the new night, he thought less of
their sinister portent than of the fact that they would guide him
to a native village where, perhaps, he might obtain porters later.
First, however, he must reconnoiter and investigate to learn the
temper of the natives. If they were fierce and warlike, he must
avoid their country, leading his little party around it; and the
message of the drums suggested that this would be the case.</p>

<p>As the radio beam guides the flyer, the drums of the Buiroos
guided Tarzan as he swung through the trees toward their village.
He moved swiftly, anticipating a sport he had enjoyed many times in
the course of his savage existence&mdash;that of frustrating the
Gomangani in the exercise of weird rites of torture and death. The
drums told him that a victim was to die, but that death had not as
yet been meted out. Who the victim was, was of no importance to the
ape-man. All that mattered was the sport of cheating the torturers
of the final accomplishment of their aims. Perhaps he would arrive
in time, perhaps not. Also, if he did arrive in time, he might fail
to accomplish his design. It was these factors that lent interest
to the savage game that Tarzan loved to play.</p>

<p>As Tarzan neared the village of Mpingu, the chief, Atan Thome
and Lal Taask sat smoking beside the fire that burned brightly in
their camp as a discourager of predatory felines.</p>

<p>"Curse those drums!" snapped Lal Taask. "They give me the
creeps; they have my nerves on edge."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night we shall not hear them," said Atan Thome, "for
then we shall be a long way on the trail to Ashair&mdash;to Ashair
and The Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>"Wolff will have difficulty catching up with us," said Lal
Taask, "and if we come back from Ashair by another route, he will
never catch up with us."</p>

<p>"You forget Magra," said Thome.</p>

<p>"No," replied Taask; "I do not forget Magra. She will find her
way to Paris as the homing pigeon finds its cote. We shall see her
there."</p>

<p>"You underestimate Wolff's cupidity," said Thome. "He will come
through for his half of the diamond. Never fear."</p>

<p>"And get this!" Lal Taask touched his knife.</p>

<p>"You are psychic," laughed Thome.</p>

<p>"Those drums!" growled Lal Taask.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"Those drums!" exclaimed Magra. "Did you ever hear anything so
horribly insistent?"</p>

<p>"A radio fan's nightmare," said Gregory; "a boring broadcast
that one can't dial out."</p>

<p>"I am so worried about Tarzan," said Magra, "out there all alone
in that awful forest."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry too much about him," d'Arnot reassured her;
"he has spent his life in awful forests, and has a way of taking
care of himself."</p>

<p>Wolff grunted. "We don't need him nohow. I can take you to
Ashair. We'd be well rid of the monkey-man."</p>

<p>"I've heard about all of that that I care to, Wolff," said
d'Arnot. "Tarzan is our only hope either of reaching Ashair or
getting out of this country alive. You stick to your hunting job.
Even at that you haven't been doing so well. Tarzan has brought in
all the meat we've had so far."</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed Lavac. "The drums! They've stopped."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The howling pack circled the helpless girl. Now and then a spear
point touched her lightly, and involuntarily her flesh recoiled.
Later the torture might be more excruciating, or some maddened
savage, driven to frenzy by the excitement of the dance, might
plunge his spear through her heart and with unintentional mercy
deliver her from further suffering.</p>

<p>As Tarzan reached the edge of the clearing where lay the village
of Mpingu, the chief, he dropped to the ground and ran swiftly
toward the palisade. This side of the village was in darkness, and
he knew that all the tribesmen would be gathered around the great
fire that lighted the foliage of the trees that grew within the
village. He would not be seen, and what slight noise he might make
would be drowned by the throbbing of the drums.</p>

<p>With the agility of Sheeta, the panther, he scaled the palisade
and dropped down into the shadow of the huts beyond; then he crept
silently toward a great tree which overhung the hut of the chief
and commanded a view of the main street of the village, where the
fire burned and the dancers leaped and howled. Swinging up among
the branches, he crossed to the other side of the tree and looked
down upon the scene of savagery below. It was almost with a sense
of shock that he recognized the victim at the stake. He saw the
horde of armed warriors incited to frenzy by the drums, the
dancing, the lust for human flesh. He fitted an arrow to his
bow.</p>

<p>As one of the dancing savages, carried away by the excitement of
the moment, paused before the girl and raised his short spear above
his head to drive it through her heart, a sudden hush fell upon the
expectant assemblage; and Helen closed her eyes. The end had come!
She breathed a silent prayer. The ominous hush was broken only by
the increased madness of the drums; then came a scream of mortal
agony.</p>

<p>The assurance of the savages vanished, as an arrow, mysteriously
sped, pierced the heart of the executioner. It was then that the
drums stopped.</p>

<p>At the scream of the stricken warrior, Helen opened her eyes. A
man lay dead at her feet, and consternation was written on the
faces of the savage Buiroos. She saw one, braver than the rest,
creeping toward her with a long knife ready in his hand; then a
weird and uncanny cry rang out from somewhere above her, as Tarzan
of the Apes rose to his full height and, raising his face to Goro,
the Moon, voiced the hideous victory cry of the bull ape that has
made a kill. Louder than the drums had been, it carried far out
into the night.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"Yes," said d'Arnot, "the drums have stopped&mdash;they have
probably made the kill. Some poor thing has found relief from
torture."</p>

<p>"Oh, what if it were Tarzan!" cried Magra; and as she spoke an
eerie scream wafted faintly across the still African night.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed Lavac.</p>

<p>"It is Tarzan who has made a kill," said d'Arnot.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"By the beard of the prophet!" exclaimed Lal Taask. "What a
hideous sound!"</p>

<p>"It is Africa, Lal Taask," said Atan Thome, "and that was the
victory cry of a bull ape. I have heard it before, on the
Congo."</p>

<p>"It was far away," said Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"Still, it was too close for comfort," replied Atan Thome. "We
shall break camp very early in the morning."</p>

<p>"But why should we fear apes?" demanded Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"It is not the apes I fear," explained Atan Thome. "I said that
that noise was the victory cry of a bull ape, but I am not so sure.
I have been talking with Mbuli. Perhaps the man we thought was
Brian Gregory was not Brian Gregory at all. I asked Mbuli if he
ever heard of a white man called Tarzan. He said that he had; that
some thought that he was a demon, and that all who did wrong,
feared him. When he kills, Mbuli says, he gives the kill cry of the
bull ape. If what we heard was not a bull ape, it was Tarzan; and
that means that he is looking for us and is far too close for
comfort."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to see that man again," said Lal Taask.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As the bloodcurdling cry crashed through the silence of the
night, the warrior who had been creeping up on Helen straightened
up and stepped back, frightened. The others, terror-stricken,
shrank from the menace of the fearsome sound; then Tarzan
spoke.</p>

<p>"The demon of the forest comes for the white mem-sahib," he
said. "Beware!" And as he spoke he dropped to the ground near the
stake, trusting, by the very boldness of his move, to overawe the
savages for the few moments it would take to free Helen and escape;
but he had reckoned without knowing of the courage of Chemungo, son
of Mpingu, standing ready with his knife.</p>

<p>"Chemungo, son of Mpingu, is not afraid of the demon of the
forest," he shouted, as he sprang forward with upraised knife; and
as the last of Helen's bonds fell away, Tarzan slipped his own
knife back into its sheath and turned to meet the chief's son, the
challenging "Kree-gah!" on his lips. With bare hands he faced the
infuriated warrior.</p>

<p>As Chemungo closed with upraised knife hand ready to strike,
Tarzan seized him by the right wrist and at the belly and swung him
high above his head as lightly as though he had been a child. The
knife dropped from Chemungo's hand as the steel thews of the
ape-man closed with viselike grip upon his wrist.</p>

<p>Helen Gregory, almost unable to believe her own senses, looked
with astonishment upon this amazing man who dared face a whole
cannibal village alone, and could see no hope but that two lives
instead of one must now be sacrificed. It was a brave, a glorious
gesture that Tarzan had made, but how pathetically futile!</p>

<p>"Open the gates!" he commanded the astounded throng, "or
Chemungo, son of Mpingu, dies."</p>

<p>The villagers hesitated. Some of the warriors grumbled. Would
they obey, or would they charge?</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">CHAPTER 9</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"COME!" said Tarzan to Helen, and without waiting
for any reply from the savages, he started toward the gate, still
carrying Chemungo above his head; and Helen walked at his side.</p>

<p>Some of the warriors started to close upon them. It was a tense
moment, fraught with danger. Then Mpingu spoke. "Wait!" he
commanded his warriors, and then to Tarzan, "If I open the gates
will you set Chemungo free, unharmed?"</p>

<p>"When I have gone a spear throw beyond the gates, I will free
him," replied the ape man.</p>

<p>"How do I know that you will do that?" demanded Mpingu. "How do
I know that you will not take him into the forest and kill
him?"</p>

<p>"You know only what I tell you, Gomangani," replied Tarzan. "I
tell you that if you open the gates and let us go out in safety, I
shall free him. If you do not open the gates, I shall kill him
now."</p>

<p>"Open the gates!" commanded Mpingu.</p>

<p>And so Tarzan and Helen passed in safety out of the village of
the cannibals and into the black African night; and beyond the
gates Tarzan liberated Chemungo.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to fall into the hands of those people?"
Tarzan asked Helen, as they set their faces toward the Gregory
camp.</p>

<p>"I escaped from Atan Thome's camp last night and tried to make
my way back to Bonga; but I got lost, and then they got me. There
was a lion, too. He had me down, but they killed him. I have had a
horrible time. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw you. How in
the world did you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>He told her of the events that had led up to his discovery of
her in the cannibal village.</p>

<p>"It will be good to see Dad again," she said; "I can scarcely
believe it even now. And Captain d'Arnot came, too&mdash;how
wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "he is with us, and Lavac, the pilot who flew us
out of Loango, and Wolff, and Magra."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't know about Magra," she said. "I
can't understand her. She seemed very sorry for me in Loango after
I was kidnaped, but she couldn't do anything for me. I think she
was afraid of Atan Thome. Yet she is linked with him in some way.
She is a very mysterious woman."</p>

<p>"She will bear watching," said Tarzan; "both she and Wolff."</p>

<p>The sun was an hour high as Magra came from her shelter and
joined the others around the fire where Ogabi was grilling the
remainder of the antelope. Her eyes were heavy, and she appeared
unrested. They bade her good morning, but their faces suggested
that it seemed anything but a good morning. She looked quickly
about, as though searching for some one.</p>

<p>"Tarzan did not return?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"This suspense is unbearable," she said. "I scarcely closed my
eyes all night, worrying about him."</p>

<p>"And think of Monsieur Gregory and me, Mam'selle," d'Arnot
reminded her. "Not only have we to worry about Tarzan, but
Helen&mdash;Miss Gregory&mdash;as well." Gregory shot a quick
glance at the Frenchman.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the others walked away, leaving Magra and
d'Arnot alone.</p>

<p>"You are very fond of Miss Gregory, are you not?" asked
Magra.</p>

<p>"Oui," admitted d'Arnot. "Who would not be?"</p>

<p>"She is very nice," agreed Magra. "I wish that I might have
helped her."</p>

<p>"Helped her? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain; but believe me, no matter what appearances may
be or what you may all think of me, I have been helpless. I am
bound by the oath of another&mdash;an oath I must in honor respect.
I am not a free agent. I cannot always do as I wish."</p>

<p>"I shall try to believe," said d'Arnot, "even though I do not
understand."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Magra, suddenly. "Here they are now&mdash;both of
them! How can it be possible?"</p>

<p>D'Arnot looked up to see Tarzan and Helen approaching the camp;
and, with Gregory, he ran forward to meet them. Gregory's eyes
filled with tears as he took Helen in his arms, and d'Arnot could
not speak. Lavac joined them and was introduced to Helen, after
which his eyes never left her when he could look at her unobserved.
Only Wolff held back. Sullen and scowling, he remained seated where
he had been.</p>

<p>The greetings over, Tarzan and Helen finished what was left of
the antelope; and while they ate, Helen recounted her
adventures.</p>

<p>"Thome shall pay for this," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"He should die for it," exclaimed d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I should like to be the one to kill him," muttered Lavac.</p>

<p>Day after day the little party trudged on through forests,
across plains, over hills; but never did they strike a sign of Atan
Thome's trail. Either Lavac or d'Arnot was constantly at the side
of Helen Gregory in a growing rivalry of which only Helen seemed to
be unaware, but then one cannot always know of just how much a
woman is unaware. She laughed and joked or talked seriously with
either of them impartially. D'Arnot was always affable and in high
spirits, but Lavac was often moody. Tarzan hunted for the party, as
Wolff seemed never to be able to find game. The latter occasionally
went off by himself and studied the route map to Ashair. He was the
guide.</p>

<p>Early one morning Tarzan told Gregory that he might be away from
the safari all that day and possibly the next.</p>

<p>"But why?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I get back," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Shall we wait here for you?"</p>

<p>"As you wish. I'll find you in any event." Then he was gone at
the swinging, easy trot with which he covered so much distance on
foot.</p>

<p>"Where's Tarzan gone?" asked d'Arnot as he joined Gregory.</p>

<p>The older man shrugged. "I don't know. He wouldn't tell me. Said
he might be away a couple of days. I can't imagine why he
went."</p>

<p>Wolff joined them then.</p>

<p>"Where's the monkey-man gone now?" he asked. "We've got enough
meat for two days&mdash;all we can carry."</p>

<p>Gregory told him all he knew, and Wolff sneered. "He's ditching
you," he said. "Any one could see that. There's no reason for him
goin' except that. You won't never see him again."</p>

<p>D'Arnot, usually slow to anger, struck Wolff heavily across the
cheek. "I've heard all of that from you I intend to," he said.</p>

<p>Wolff reached for his gun, but d'Arnot had him covered before he
could draw. Gregory stepped between them.</p>

<p>"We can't have anything like this," he said. "We've enough
troubles without fighting among ourselves."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Monsieur Gregory," said d'Arnot, bolstering his
weapon.</p>

<p>Wolff turned and walked away, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>"What had we better do, Captain?" asked Gregory. "Wait here for
Tarzan? or go on?"</p>

<p>"We might as well go on," said d'Arnot. "We might just lose a
day or two by staying here."</p>

<p>"But if we go on, Tarzan might not be able to find us," objected
Gregory.</p>

<p>D'Arnot laughed. "Even yet, you do not know Tarzan," he said.
"You might as well fear to lose yourself on the main street of your
native city as think that Tarzan could lose us in two days,
anywhere in Africa."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Gregory, "let's go on."</p>

<p>As they moved on behind Wolff, Lavac was walking beside
Helen.</p>

<p>"What a deadly experience this would be," he said, "if it were
not for&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Not for what?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"You," he said.</p>

<p>"Me? I don't understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"That is because you've never been in love," he replied,
huskily.</p>

<p>Helen laughed. "Oh," she cried, "are you trying to tell me
you're in love with me? It must be the altitude."</p>

<p>"You laugh at my love?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "at you. Magra and I are the only women you have
seen for weeks. You were bound to have fallen in love with one of
us, being a Frenchman; and Magra is so obviously in love with
Tarzan that it would have been a waste of time to have fallen in
love with her. Please forget it."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget it," said Lavac, "and I shall never give
up. I am mad about you, Helen. Please give me something to hope
for. I tell you I'm desperate. I won't be responsible for what I
may do, if you don't tell me that there may be a little hope for
me."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, seriously, "but I just don't love you. If
you are going to act like this, you will make everything even more
disagreeable than it already is."</p>

<p>"You are cruel," grumbled Lavac; and for the rest of the day
walked moodily alone, nursing his jealousy of d'Arnot.</p>

<p>And there was another who was imbued with thoughts of love that
clamored for expression. It was Wolff, and just to be charitable
let us call the sentiment that moved him love. He had been leading
the safari, but the game trail he was following was too plain to be
missed; so he dropped back beside Magra.</p>

<p>"Listen, beautiful," he said. "I'm sorry for what I said the
other day. I wouldn't hurt you for nothin'. I know we ain't always
hit it off so good, but I'm for you. There ain't nothin' I wouldn't
do for you. Why can't we be friends? We could go a long way, if we
worked together."</p>

<p>"Meaning what?" asked Magra.</p>

<p>"Meaning I got what it takes to make a woman happy&mdash;two
strings on that big diamond and £2000 in real money. Think what me
and you could do in God's country with all that!"</p>

<p>"With you?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"Yes, with me. Ain't I good enough for you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Magra looked at him, and laughed.</p>

<p>Wolff flushed. "Look here," he said, angrily; "if you think you
can treat me like dirt and get away with it, you're all wrong. I
just been offerin' to marry you, but I ain't good enough. Well, let
me tell you this&mdash;I always get what I go after. I'll get you;
and I won't have to marry you, neither. You're stuck on that
monkey-man; but he can't even see you, and anyway he hasn't got
tuppence to rub together."</p>

<p>"A guide belongs at the head of the safari," said Magra;
"good-bye."</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Tarzan dropped from the branches of a tree
into the midst of the trekking safari, if the six whites and Ogabi
could be called a safari. The seven stopped and gathered around
him.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're back," said Gregory. "I'm always worried when
you are away."</p>

<p>"I went to look for Thome's trail," said Tarzan, "and I found
it."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Gregory.</p>

<p>"He's a long way ahead of us," continued the ape-man, "thanks to
you, Wolff."</p>

<p>"Anyone can make a mistake," growled Wolff.</p>

<p>"You made no mistake," snapped Tarzan. "You have tried,
deliberately, to lead us off the trail. We'd be better off without
this man, Gregory. You should dismiss him."</p>

<p>"You can't turn me out alone in this country," said Wolff.</p>

<p>"You'd be surprised what Tarzan can do," remarked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I think it would be a little too drastic," said Gregory.</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Very well," he said; "as you will, but we'll
dispense with his services as guide from now on."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">CHAPTER 10</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ATAN THOME and Lal Taask stood at the head of
their safari, which had just emerged from a dense forest. At their
right ran a quiet river; and before them stretched rough, open
country. In the distance, visible above low hills, rose the summit
of what appeared to be a huge extinct volcano.</p>

<p>"Look, Lal Taask!" exclaimed Thome. "It is Tuen-Baka. Inside its
crater lies Ashair, The Forbidden City."</p>

<p>"And The Father of Diamonds, Master," added Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"Yes, The Father of Diamonds. I wish that Magra were here to
see. I wonder where they are. Wolff must be on his way here with
her by now. Perhaps we shall meet them when we come out; they could
scarcely have overtaken us&mdash;we have moved too swiftly."</p>

<p>"If we do not meet them, there will be fewer with whom to
divide," suggested Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"I promised her mother," said Thome.</p>

<p>"That was a long time ago; and her mother is dead, and Magra
never knew of the promise."</p>

<p>"The memory of her mother never dies," said Thome. "You have
been a faithful servitor, Lal Taask. Perhaps I should tell you the
story; then you will understand."</p>

<p>"Your servant listens."</p>

<p>"Magra's mother was the only woman I ever loved. The inexorable
laws of caste rendered her unobtainable by me. I am a mongrel. She
was the daughter of a maharaja. I was trusted in the service of her
father; and when the princess married an Englishman, I was sent to
England with her in her entourage. While her husband was hunting
big game in Africa, he stumbled upon Ashair. For three years he was
a prisoner there, undergoing cruelties and torture. At last he
managed to escape, and returned home only to die as a result of his
experiences. But he brought the story of The Father of Diamonds,
and exacted from his wife a promise that she would organize an
expedition to return to Ashair and punish those who had treated him
so cruelly. The Father of Diamonds was to be the incentive to
obtain volunteers; but the map he made became lost, and nothing was
ever done. Then the princess died, leaving Magra, who was then ten
years old, in my care; for the old maharaja was dead, and his
successor would have nothing to do with the daughter of the
Englishman. I have always had it in my mind to look for Ashair, and
two years ago I made the first attempt. It was then that I learned
that Brian Gregory was on a similar quest. He reached Ashair and
made a map, though he never actually entered the city. On his
second venture, I followed him, but got lost. I met the remnants of
his safari coming out. He had disappeared. They refused to give me
the map, so I swore to obtain it, and here I am with the map."</p>

<p>"How did you know he made a map?" asked Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"Our safaris met for one night, after his first trip in. I just
happened to see him making the map. It is the one I have, or,
rather, a copy of it that he sent home in a letter.</p>

<p>"Because Magra's father died because of The Father of Diamonds,
a share of it belongs to her; and there is another reason. I am not
yet an old man. I see in Magra the reincarnation of the woman I
loved. Do you understand, Lal Taask?"</p>

<p>"Yes, master."</p>

<p>Atan Thome sighed. "Perhaps I dream foolish dreams. We shall
see, but now we must move on. Come, Mbuli, get the boys going!"</p>

<p>The natives had been whispering among themselves while Thome and
Taask talked, now Mbuli came to Atan Thome.</p>

<p>"My people will go no farther, bwana," he said.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Thome. "You must be crazy. I hired you to go
to Ashair."</p>

<p>"In Bonga, Ashair was a long way off; and the spirits of my
people were brave. Now Bonga is a long way off and Ashair is near.
Now they remember that Tuen-Baka is taboo, and they are
afraid."</p>

<p>"You are headman," snapped Thome. "You make them come."</p>

<p>"No can do," insisted Mbuli.</p>

<p>"We'll camp here by the river tonight," said Thome. "I'll talk
with them. They may feel braver tomorrow. They certainly can't quit
on me now."</p>

<p>"Very well, bwana; tomorrow they may feel braver. It would be
well to camp here tonight."</p>

<p>Atan Thome and Lal Taask slept well that night, lulled by the
soothing murmuring of the river; and Atan Thome dreamed of The
Father of Diamonds and Magra. Lal Taask thought that he dreamed
when the silence of the night was broken by a sepulchral voice
speaking in a strange tongue, but it was no dream.</p>

<p>The sun was high when Atan Thome awoke. He called his boy, but
there was no response; then he called again, loudly, peremptorily.
He listened. The camp was strangely silent. Rising, he went to the
front of the tent and parted the flaps. Except for his tent and Lal
Taask's, the camp was deserted. He crossed to Taask's tent and
awakened him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, master?" asked Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"The dogs have deserted us," exclaimed Thome.</p>

<p>Taask leaped to his feet and came out of his tent. "By Allah!
They have taken all our provisions and equipment with them. They
have left us to die. We must hurry after them. They can't be very
far away."</p>

<p>"We shall do nothing of the sort," said Thome. "We're going on!"
There was a strange light in his eyes that Lal Taask had never seen
there before. "Do you think I have gone through what I have gone
through to turn back now because a few cowardly natives are
afraid?"</p>

<p>"But, master, we cannot go on alone, just we two," begged Lal
Taask.</p>

<p>"Silence!" commanded Thome. "We go on to Ashair&mdash;to the
Forbidden City and The Father of Diamonds. The Father of Diamonds!"
He broke into wild laughter. "Magra shall wear the finest diamonds
in the world. We shall be rich, rich beyond the wildest dreams of
avarice&mdash;she and I&mdash;the richest people in the world! I,
Atan Thome, the mongrel, shall put the maharajas of India to shame.
I shall strew the streets of Paris with gold. I&mdash;" He stopped
suddenly and pressed a palm to his forehead. "Come!" he said
presently in his normal tone. "We'll follow the river up to
Ashair."</p>

<p>In silence, Lal Taask followed his master along a narrow trail
that paralleled the river. The ground was rough and broken by
gullies and ravines; the trail was faint across rocky, barren
ground. Near noon they reached the mouth of a narrow gorge with
precipitous cliffs on either side, cliffs that towered high above
them, dwarfing the two men to Lilliputian proportions. Through the
gorge flowed the river, placidly.</p>

<p>"Siva! What a place!" exclaimed Lal Taask. "We can go no
farther."</p>

<p>"It is the trail to Ashair," said Thome, pointing. "See it
winding along the face of the cliff?"</p>

<p>"That, a trail!" exclaimed Taask. "It is only a scratch that a
mountain goat couldn't find footing on."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is the trail that we follow," said Thome.</p>

<p>"Master, it is madness!" cried Lal Taask. "Let us turn back. All
the diamonds in the world are not worth the risk. Before we have
gone a hundred yards we shall have fallen into the river and
drowned."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Thome, "and follow me."</p>

<p>Clinging precariously to a narrow footpath scratched in the face
of the towering cliff, the two men inched their way along the rocky
wall. Below them flowed the silent river that rose somewhere in the
mystery that lay ahead. A single mis-step would cast them into it.
Lal Taask dared not look down. Facing the wall, with arms outspread
searching for handholds that were not there, trembling so that he
feared his knees would give beneath him and hurl him to death, he
followed his master, sweat gushing from every pore.</p>

<p>"We'll never make it," he panted.</p>

<p>"Shut up and come along!" snapped Thome. "If I fall, you may
turn back."</p>

<p>"Oh, master, I couldn't even do that. No one could turn around
on this hideous trail."</p>

<p>"Then keep coming and quit making such a fuss. You make me
nervous."</p>

<p>"And to think you take such risks for a diamond! If it were as
big as a house and I had it now, I'd give it to be back in
Lahore."</p>

<p>"You are a coward, Lal Taask," snapped Thome.</p>

<p>"I am, master; but it is better to be a live coward than a dead
fool."</p>

<p>For two hours the men moved slowly along the narrow footpath
until both were on the verge of exhaustion, and even Thome was
beginning to regret his temerity; then, as he turned a jutting
shoulder in the cliff, he saw a little wooded canyon that broke the
face of the mighty escarpment and ran gently down to the river.
Down into this canyon the trail led. When they reached it, they
threw themselves upon the ground in total exhaustion and lay there
until almost dark.</p>

<p>Finally they aroused themselves and built a fire, for with the
coming of night a chill settled upon the canyon. All day they had
been without food; and they were famished, but there was nothing
for them to eat, and they had to content themselves by filling
their bellies with water at the river. For warmth, they huddled
close to their little fire.</p>

<p>"Master, this is an evil place," said Lal Taask. "I have a
feeling that we are being watched."</p>

<p>"It is the evil within you speaking, fool," growled Thome.</p>

<p>"Allah! Master, look!" faltered Taask. "What is it?" He pointed
into the blackness among the trees; and then a sepulchral voice
spoke in a strange tongue, and Lal Taask fainted.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">CHAPTER 11</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">UNGO, the king ape, was hunting with his tribe.
They were nervous and irritable, for it was the period of the
Dum-Dum; and as yet they had found no victim for the sacrificial
dance. Suddenly the shaggy king raised his head and sniffed the
air. He growled his disapproval of the evidence that Usha, the
wind, brought to his nostrils. The other apes looked at him
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Gomangani, tarmangani," he said. "They come," then he led his
people into the underbrush and hid close to the trail.</p>

<p>The little band of men and women who formed the Gregory "safari"
followed the plain trail left by Atan Thome's safari, while Tarzan
hunted for meat far afield.</p>

<p>"Tarzan must have had difficulty in locating game," said
d'Arnot. "I haven't heard his kill-call yet."</p>

<p>"He's marvelous," said Magra. "We'd have starved to death if it
hadn't been for him&mdash;even with a hunter along."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't shoot game where there ain't none," growled
Wolff.</p>

<p>"Tarzan never comes back empty handed," said Magra; "and he
hasn't any gun, either."</p>

<p>"The other monkeys find food, too," sneered Wolff; "but who
wants to be a monkey?"</p>

<p>Ungo was watching them now, as they came in sight along the
trail. His close-set, bloodshot eyes blazed with anger; and then
suddenly and without warning he charged, and his whole tribe
followed him. The little band fell back in dismay. D'Arnot whipped
out his pistol and fired; and an ape fell, screaming; then the
others were among them, and he could not fire again without
endangering his companions. Wolff ran. Lavac and Gregory were both
knocked down and bitten. For a few moments all was confusion, so
that afterward no one could recall just what happened. The apes
were among them and gone again; and when they went, Ungo carried
Magra off under one great hairy arm.</p>
<a id="pic2" name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0600671h-images/TarzanAndTheForbiddenCity-02.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Ungo carried Magra off under one great hairy
arm.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Magra struggled to escape until she was exhausted, but the
powerful beast that carried her paid little attention to her
struggles. Once, annoyed, he cuffed her, almost knocking her
insensible; then she ceased, waiting and hoping for some
opportunity to escape. She wondered to what awful fate she was
being dragged. So man-like was the huge creature, she shuddered as
she contemplated what might befall her.</p>

<p>Half carrying her, half dragging her through the woods, with his
huge fellows lumbering behind, Ungo, the king ape, bore the girl to
a small, natural clearing, a primitive arena where, from time
immemorial, the great apes had held their sacrificial dance. There
he threw her roughly to the ground, and two females squatted beside
her to see that she did not escape.</p>

<p>Back on the trail, the little party, overwhelmed by the tragedy
of this misadventure, stood debating what they had best do.</p>

<p>"We could follow them," said d'Arnot; "but we haven't a chance
of overtaking them, and if we did, what could we do against them,
even though we are armed?"</p>

<p>"But we can't just stand here and do nothing," cried Helen.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said d'Arnot. "I'll take Wolff's rifle and
follow them. I may be able to pick off enough of them to frighten
the others away if I come up with them after they halt; then, when
Tarzan returns, send him after me."</p>

<p>"Here's Tarzan now," said Helen, as the ape-man came trotting
along the trail with the carcass of his kill across his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Tarzan found a very disorganized party as he joined them. They
were all excited and trying to talk at the same time.</p>

<p>"We never saw them 'til they jumped us," said Lavac.</p>

<p>"They were as big as gorillas," added Helen.</p>

<p>"They were gorillas," put in Wolff.</p>

<p>"They were not gorillas," contradicted d'Arnot; "and anyway, you
didn't wait to see what they were."</p>

<p>"The biggest one carried Magra off under his arm," said
Gregory.</p>

<p>"They took Magra?" Tarzan looked concerned. "Why didn't you say
so in the first place? Which way did they go?"</p>

<p>D'Arnot pointed in the direction in which the apes had made
off.</p>

<p>"Keep on this trail until you find a good place to camp," said
Tarzan; then he was gone.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As the moon rose slowly over the arena where Magra lay beside a
primitive earthen drum upon which three old apes beat with sticks,
several of the great shaggy bulls commenced to dance around her.
Menacing her with heavy sticks, the bulls leaped and whirled as
they circled the frightened girl. Magra had no knowledge of the
significance of these rites. She only guessed that she was to
die.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The Lord of the Jungle followed the trail of the great apes
through the darkness of the forest as unerringly as though he were
following a well marked spoor by daylight, followed it by the scent
of the anthropoids that clung to the grasses and the foliage of the
underbrush, tainting the air with the effluvia of the great bodies.
He knew that he should come upon them eventually, but would he be
in time?</p>

<p>As the moon rose, the throbbing of the earthen drum directed him
toward the arena of the Dum-Dum; so that he could take to the trees
and move more swiftly in a direct line. It told him, too, the
nature of the danger that threatened Magra. He knew that she still
lived, for the drum would be stilled only after her death, when the
apes would be fighting over her body and tearing it to pieces. He
knew, because he had leaped and danced in the moonlight at many a
Dum-Dum when Sheeta, the panther, or Wappi, the antelope, was the
sacrificial victim.</p>

<p>The moon was almost at zenith as he neared the arena. When it
hung at zenith would be the moment of the kill; and in the arena,
the shaggy bulls danced in simulation of the hunt. Magra lay as
they had thrown her, exhausted, hopeless, resigned to death,
knowing that nothing could save her now.</p>

<p>Goro, the moon, hung upon the verge of the fateful moment, when
a tarmangani, naked but for a G string, dropped from an overhanging
tree into the arena. With growls and mutterings of rage, the bulls
turned upon the intruder who dared thus sacrilegiously to invade
the sanctity of their holy of holies. The king ape, crouching, led
them.</p>

<p>"I am Ungo," he said. "I kill!"</p>

<p>Tarzan, too, crouched and growled as he advanced to meet the
king ape. "I am Tarzan of the Apes," he said in the language of the
first-men, the only language he had known for the first twenty
years of his life. "I am Tarzan of the Apes, mighty hunter, mighty
fighter. I kill!"</p>

<p>One word of the ape-man's challenge Magra had
understood&mdash;"Tarzan." Astounded, she opened her eyes to see
the king ape and Tarzan circling one another, each looking for an
opening. What a brave but what a futile gesture the man was making
in her defense! He was giving his life for her, and uselessly. What
chance had he against the huge, primordial beast?</p>

<p>Suddenly, Tarzan reached out and seized the ape's wrist; then,
turning quickly, he hurled the great creature over his shoulder
heavily to the ground; but instantly Ungo was on his feet again.
Growling and roaring horribly, he charged. This time he would
overwhelm the puny man-thing with his great weight, crush him in
those mighty arms.</p>

<p>Magra trembled for the man, and she blanched as she saw him meet
the charge with growls equally as bestial as those of the ape.
Could this growling, snarling beast be the quiet, resourceful man
she had come to love? Was he, after all, but a primitive Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde? Spellbound and horrified, she watched.</p>

<p>Swift as Ara, the lightning, is Tarzan; as agile as Sheeta, the
panther. Dodging, and ducking beneath Ungo's great flailing arms,
he leaped upon the hairy back and locked a full Nelson on the
raging ape. As he applied the pressure of his mighty thews, the ape
screamed in agony.</p>

<p>"Ka-goda!" shouted Tarzan, bearing down a little harder.
"Surrender!"</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The members of the Gregory party sat around their camp fire
listening to the throbbing of the distant drum and waiting in
nervous expectancy, for what, they did not know.</p>

<p>"It is the Dum-Dum of the great apes, I think," said d'Arnot.
"Tarzan has told me about them. When the full moon hangs at zenith,
the bulls kill a victim. It is, perhaps, a rite older than the
human race, the tiny germ from which all religious observances have
sprung."</p>

<p>"And Tarzan has seen this rite performed?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"He was raised by the great apes," explained d'Arnot, "and he
has danced the dance of death in many a Dum-Dum."</p>

<p>"He has helped to kill men and women and tear them to pieces?"
demanded Helen.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried d'Arnot. "The apes rarely secure a human victim.
They did so only once while Tarzan ranged with them, and he saved
that one. The victim they prefer is their greatest enemy, the
panther."</p>

<p>"And you think the drums are for Magra?" asked Lavac.</p>

<p>"Yes," said d'Arnot, "I fear so."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd gone after her myself," said Wolff. "That guy didn't
have no gun."</p>

<p>"He may not have had a gun," said d'Arnot, "but at least he went
in the right direction." Wolff lapsed into moody silence.

<p>"We all had a chance to do something when the ape first took her,"
continued d'Arnot; "but, frankly, I was too stunned to think."</p>

<p>"It all happened so quickly," said Gregory. "It was over before
I really knew what had happened."</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed d'Arnot. "The drums have stopped."</p>

<p>He looked up at the moon. "The moon is at zenith," he said.
"Tarzan must have been too late."</p>

<p>"Them gorillas would pull him apart," said Wolff. "If it wasn't
for Magra, I'd say good riddance."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Gregory. "Without Tarzan, we're lost."</p>

<p>As they talked, Tarzan and Ungo battled in the arena; and Magra
watched in fearful astonishment. She could scarcely believe her
eyes as she saw the great ape helpless in the hands of the man.
Ungo was screaming in pain. Slowly, relentlessly, his neck was
being broken. At last he could stand it no longer and bellowed,
"Ka-goda!" which means "I surrender," and Tarzan released him and
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Tarzan is king!" he cried, facing the other bulls.</p>

<p>He stood there, waiting; but no young bull came forward to
dispute the right of kingship with him. They had seen what he had
done to Ungo, and they were afraid. Thus, by grace of a custom ages
old, Tarzan became king of the tribe.</p>

<p>Magra did not understand. She was still terrified. Springing to
her feet, she ran to Tarzan and threw her arms about him, pressing
close. "I am afraid," she said. "Now they will kill us both."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "No," he said; "they will not kill us.
They will do whatever I tell them to do, for now I am their
king."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER 12</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the light of early morning, after a night of
terror, Atan Thome and Lal Taask started to retrace their steps
along the precarious pathway they had so laboriously risked the day
before.</p>

<p>"I am glad, master, that you decided to turn back," said Lal
Taask.</p>

<p>"Without porters and askaris, it would be madness to attempt to
force our way into The Forbidden City," growled Thome. "We'll
return to Bonga and enlist a strong force of men who fear no
taboos."</p>

<p>"If we live to get to Bonga," said Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"Cowards invite death," snapped Thome.</p>

<p>"After last night, who would not be a coward in this damnable
country?" demanded Taask. "You saw it, didn't you? You heard that
voice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Thome. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"It was evil," said Taask. "It breathed of the grave and of
Hell. Men cannot prevail against the forces of another world."</p>

<p>"Rot!" ejaculated Thome. "It has some rational and mundane
explanation, if we only knew."</p>

<p>"But we don't know. I do not care to know. I shall never return
here, if Allah permits me to escape alive."</p>

<p>"Then you will get no share of the diamond," threatened Atan
Thome.</p>

<p>"I shall be content with my life," replied Lal Taask.</p>

<p>The two men succeeded in negotiating the return trip in safety,
and stood again at last upon level ground near the mouth of the
gorge. Lal Taask breathed a sigh of relief, and his spirits rose;
but Atan Thome was moody and irritable. He had built his hopes so
high that to be turned back at what he believed to be the threshold
of success plunged him into despondency. With bowed head, he led
the way back over the rough terrain toward their last camp at the
edge of the forest.</p>

<p>As they were passing through one of the numerous ravines, they
were suddenly confronted by a dozen white warriors who leaped from
behind great lava boulders and barred their way. They were stalwart
men, wearing white plumes and short tunics, on the breasts and
backs of which were woven a conventionalized bird. They were armed
with spears and knives which hung in scabbards at their hips.</p>

<p>The leader spoke to Thome in a strange tongue; but when he
discovered that neither could understand the other, he gave an
order to his men who herded Thome and Taask down the ravine to the
river, where lay such a craft as may have floated on the Nile in
the days of the Pharaohs. It was an open galley, manned by twenty
slaves chained to the thwarts.</p>

<p>At the points of spears, Thome and Taask were herded aboard; and
when the last file of the warriors had stepped across the gunwale,
the boat put off and started up stream.</p>

<p>Atan Thome broke into laughter; and Lal Taask looked at him in
surprise, as did the warriors near him.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh, master?" asked Lal Taask, fearfully.</p>

<p>"I laugh," cried Thome, "because after all I shall reach The
Forbidden City."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As Helen came from her shelter early in the morning, she saw
d'Arnot sitting beside the embers of the dying beast fire, and she
joined him.</p>

<p>"Sentry duty?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes," he said; "I have been doing sentry duty and a
lot of thinking."</p>

<p>"About what, for instance?" she asked.</p>

<p>"About you&mdash;us; and what we are going to do," he
replied.</p>

<p>"I talked with Father last night, just before I went to bed,"
she said; "and he has decided to return to Bonga and organize a
safari. He doesn't dare go on without Tarzan."</p>

<p>"He is wise," said d'Arnot. "Your life is too precious to risk
further." He hesitated, embarrassed. "You don't know what it means
to me, Helen. I know that this is no time to speak of love; but you
must have seen&mdash;haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Et tu, Brute!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Lavac also thinks he is in love with me. Can't you
see, Paul, that it is just because I am practically the only girl
available&mdash;poor Magra was so much in love with Tarzan."</p>

<p>"That is not true with me," he said. "I do not believe it is the
explanation as far as Lavac is concerned. He is a fine fellow. I
can't blame him for falling in love with you. No, Helen, I'm quite
sure of myself. You see, I have taken to losing my appetite and
looking at the moon." He laughed. "Those are certain symptoms, you
know. Pretty soon I shall take to writing poetry."</p>

<p>"You're a dear," she said. "I'm glad you have a sense of humor.
I'm afraid the poor lieutenant hasn't, but then maybe he hasn't had
as much experience as you."</p>

<p>"There should be an S.P.C.L.," he said.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Lovers."</p>

<p>"Idiot. Wait until you get back where there are lots of girls;
then&mdash;" She stopped as she glanced across his shoulder. Her
face went white, and her eyes were wide with terror.</p>

<p>"Helen! What is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul&mdash;the apes have come back!"</p>

<p>D'Arnot turned to see the great beasts lumbering along the
trail; then he shouted for Gregory and Lavac. "Name of a name!" he
cried an instant later. "Tarzan and Magra are with them!"</p>

<p>"They are prisoners!" exclaimed Helen.</p>

<p>"Non," said d'Arnot; "Tarzan is leading the apes! Was there ever
such a man?"</p>

<p>"I'm faint with relief," said Helen. "I never expected to see
them again. I'd given them up for lost, especially Magra. It is
like seeing a ghost. Why, we even knew the minute that she died
last night&mdash;when the drumming stopped."</p>

<p>Tarzan and Magra were greeted enthusiastically, and Magra had to
tell her story of adventure and rescue. "I know it seems
incredible," she added; "but here we are, and here are the apes. If
you don't believe me, ask them."</p>

<p>"What are them beggars hangin' 'round for?" demanded Wolff. "We
ought to give 'em a few rounds for luck. They got it comin' to 'em
for stealin' Magra."</p>

<p>"They are my people," said Tarzan; "they are obeying orders. You
shall not harm them."</p>

<p>"They may be your people," grumbled Wolff; "but they ain't mine,
me not bein' no monkey."</p>

<p>"They are going along with us," said Tarzan to Gregory. "If
you'll all keep away from them and do not touch them, they won't
harm you; and they may be helpful to us in many ways. You see, this
species of anthropoid ape is highly intelligent. They have
developed at least the rudiments of co-operation, the lack of which
among the lower orders has permitted man to reign supreme over
other animals which might easily have exterminated him. They are
ferocious fighters, when aroused; and, most important of all, they
will obey me. They will be a protection against both beasts and
men. I'll send them away now to hunt in the vicinity; but when I
call, they'll come."</p>

<p>"Why, he talks to them!" exclaimed Helen, as Tarzan walked over
and spoke to Ungo.</p>

<p>"Of course he does," said d'Arnot. "Their language was the first
he ever learned."</p>

<p>"You should have seen him fight with that great bull," said
Magra. "I was almost afraid of him afterward."</p>

<p>That night, after they had made camp, Lavac came and sat on a
log beside Helen. "There is a full moon," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "I'd noticed it. I shall never see a full
moon again without hearing the throbbing of that awful drum and
thinking of what Magra went through."</p>

<p>"It should bring happier thoughts to you," he said, "as it does
to me&mdash;thoughts of love. The full moon is for love."</p>

<p>"It is also for lunacy," she suggested.</p>

<p>"I wish you could love me," he said. "Why don't you? Is it
because of d'Arnot? Be careful with him. He is notorious for his
conquests."</p>

<p>The girl was disgusted. How different this from d'Arnot's praise
of his rival. "Please don't speak of it again," she said. "I don't
love you, and that's that." Then she got up and walked away,
joining d'Arnot near the fire. Lavac remained where he was,
brooding and furious.</p>

<p>Lavac was not the only member of the party to whom the full moon
suggested love. It found Wolff recipient, also. His colossal
egotism did not permit him to doubt that eventually he would break
down Magra's resistance, and that she would fall into his arms.
Being an egotist, he always seized upon the wrong thing to say to
her, as he did when he caught her alone that evening.</p>

<p>"What do you see in that damn monkey-man?" was his opening sally
in the game of love. "He ain't got nothin' but a G string to his
name. Look at me! I got £2000 and a half interest in the biggest
diamond in the world."</p>

<p>"I am looking at you," replied Magra. "Perhaps that's one of the
reasons I don't like you. You know, Wolff, there must be a lot of
different words to describe a person like you; but I don't know any
of them that are bad enough to fit you. I wouldn't have you if you
owned the father and mother of diamonds, both, and were the last
man on Earth into the bargain. Now, don't ever mention this subject
to me again, or I'll tell the 'monkey-man' on you; and he'll
probably break you in two and forget to put you back together
again. You know, he isn't in love with you either."</p>

<p>"You think you're too good for me, do you?" growled Wolff.
"Well, I'll show you. I'll get you; and I'll get your dirty
monkey-man, too."</p>

<p>"Don't let him see you doing it," laughed Magra.</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid of him," boasted Wolff.</p>

<p>"Say, you wouldn't even dare stab Tarzan in the back. You know,
I saw you running away when that ape grabbed me. No, Wolff, you
don't scare me worth a cent. Everybody in this camp has your
number, and I know just what sort of a yellow double-crosser you
are."</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">CHAPTER 13</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the barge in which Thome and Taask were
prisoners was being rowed up the river, the former heard one of the
warriors speak to a black galley slave in Swahili.</p>

<p>"Why did you take us prisoners?" he asked the warrior in
command, speaking in Swahili; "and what are you going to do with
us?"</p>

<p>"I took you prisoners because you were too near The Forbidden
City," replied the warrior. "No one may approach Ashair and return
to the outer world. I am taking you there now. What will become of
you rests in the hands of Queen Atka, but you may rest assured that
you will never leave Ashair."</p>

<p>Just ahead of the galley, Thome saw the mighty wall of Tuen-Baka
rising high into the blue African sky; and from a great, black
opening in the wall the river flowed. Into this mighty natural
tunnel the galley was steered. A torch was lighted and held in the
bow, as the craft was rowed into the Stygian darkness ahead; but at
last it emerged into the sunlight and onto the bosom of a lake that
lay at the bottom of the great crater of Tuen-Baka.</p>

<p>Ahead and to the left, Thome saw the domes of a small, walled
city. To right and left, beyond the lake, were forest and plain;
and in the far distance, at the upper end of the lake, another city
was dimly visible.</p>

<p>"Which is Ashair?" he asked a warrior.</p>

<p>The man jerked a thumb in the direction of the nearer city at
the left. "There is Ashair," he said. "Take a good look at it, for,
unless Atka sentences you to the galleys, you'll never see the
outside of it again."</p>

<p>"And the other city?" asked Thome. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"That's Thobos," replied the man. "If you happen to be sentenced
to a war galley, you may see more of Thobos, when we go there to
fight."</p>

<p>As the galley approached Ashair, Atan Thome turned to Lal Taask,
who sat beside him in the stern. Thome had been looking at the
city, but Lal Taask had been gazing down into the clear depths of
the lake.</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Thome. "My dream come true! There is The
Forbidden City; there, somewhere, lies The Father of Diamonds. I am
coming closer and closer to it. It is Fate! I know now that it is
written that I shall possess it."</p>

<p>Lal Taask shook his head. "These warriors have sharp spears," he
said. "There are probably more warriors in Ashair. I do not think
they will let you take The Father of Diamonds away with you. I even
heard one say that we should never leave, ourselves. Do not get
your hopes too high. Look down into this lake instead. The water is
so clear, you can see the bottom. I have seen many fish and strange
creatures such as I have never seen before. It is far more
interesting than the city, and it may be the only time we shall
ever look at it. By the beard of the prophet, Atan Thome! Look!
There is a marvel, indeed, master."</p>

<p>Thome looked over the side of the galley; and the sight that met
his eyes wrung an exclamation of surprise and incredulity from him,
for, clearly discernible at the bottom of the lake, there was a
splendid temple. He could see lights shining from its windows, and
as he watched it, spellbound, he saw a grotesque, man-like figure
emerge from it and walk on the bottom of the lake. The creature
carried a trident, but what it was doing and where it was going
Atan Thome was doomed not to discover, for the rapidly propelled
barge passed over the creature and the temple; and they were lost
to view, as the craft approached the quay of The Forbidden
City.</p>

<p>"Come!" commanded the warrior in charge of the party, and Thome
and Taask were herded off the galley onto the quay. They entered
the city through a small gateway, and were led through narrow,
winding streets to a large building near the center of the city.
Before the gate stood armed warriors who, after a brief parley,
admitted the captives and their guard; then Atan Thome and Lal
Taask were escorted into the building and into the presence of an
official, who listened to the report of their captors and then
spoke to them in Swahili.</p>

<p>The man listened to Thome's explanation of their presence near
Ashair; then he shrugged. "You may be telling the truth, or you may
be lying," he said. "Probably you are lying, but it makes no
difference. Ashair is a forbidden city. No stranger who enters
Tuen-Baka may leave alive. What becomes of him here&mdash;whether
he be destroyed immediately or permitted to live for whatever
useful purpose he may serve&mdash;rests wholly with the discretion
of the Queen. Your capture will be reported to her; when it suits
her convenience, your fate will be decided."</p>

<p>"If I might have audience with her," said Thome, "I am sure that
I can convince her that my motives are honorable and that I can
give Ashair valuable service. I have information of the greatest
importance to her and to Ashair."</p>

<p>"You may tell me," said the official. "I will communicate the
information to her."</p>

<p>"I must give it to the Queen in person," replied Atan Thome.</p>

<p>"The Queen of Ashair is not in the habit of granting audiences
to prisoners," said the man, haughtily. "It will be well for you if
you give this information to me&mdash;if you have any."</p>

<p>Atan Thome shrugged. "I have it," he said, "but I shall give it
to no one but the Queen. If disaster befalls Ashair, the
responsibility will rest with you. Don't say that I didn't warn
you."</p>

<p>"Enough of this impudence!" exclaimed the official. "Take them
away and lock them up&mdash;and don't overfeed them."</p>

<p>"Master, you should not have antagonized him," said Lal Taask,
as the two men lay on cold stone, chained to the wall of a gloomy
dungeon. "If you had information to impart to the Queen&mdash;and
Allah alone knows what it might be&mdash;why did you not tell the
man what it was? Thus it would have reached the Queen."</p>

<p>"You are a good servant, Lal Taask," said Thome; "and you wield
a knife with rare finesse. These are accomplishments worthy of
highest encomiums, but you lack versatility. It is evident that
Allah felt he had given you sufficient gifts when he gave you these
powers; so he gave you nothing with which to think."</p>

<p>"My master is all-wise," replied Lal Taask. "I pray that he may
think me out of this dungeon."</p>

<p>"That's what I am trying to do. Don't you realize that it would
be useless to appeal to underlings? This Queen is all-powerful. If
we can reach her, personally, we place our case directly before the
highest tribunal; and I can plead our case much better than it
could be pled second-hand by one who had no interest in us."</p>

<p>"Again I bow to your superior wisdom," said Lal Taask, "but I am
still wondering what important information you have to give the
Queen of Ashair."</p>

<p>"Lal Taask, you are hopeless," sighed Thome. "The information I
have to give to the Queen should be as obvious to you as a fly on
the end of your nose."</p>

<p>For days, Atan Thome and Lal Taask lay on the cold stone of
their dungeon floor, receiving just enough food to keep them alive;
and having all Atan Thome's pleas for an audience with the Queen
ignored by the silent warrior who brought their food.</p>

<p>"They are starving us to death," wailed Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," observed Atan Thome, "they appear to have an
uncanny sense of the calorific properties of food. They know just
how much will keep us from starving to death. And look at my waist
line, Lal Taask! I have often had it in mind to embark upon a rigid
diet for the purpose of reducing. The kind Asharians have
anticipated that ambition. Presently, I shall be almost
sylph-like."</p>

<p>"For you, perhaps, that may be excellent, master; but for me,
who never had an ounce of surplus fat beneath his hide, it spells
disaster. Already, my backbone is chafing my navel."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Atan Thome, as footfalls announced the approach
of some one along the corridor leading to their cell, "here comes
Old Garrulity again."</p>

<p>"I did not know that you knew his name, master," remarked Taask;
"but some one accompanies him this time&mdash;I hear voices."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he brings an extra calorie, and needs help," suggested
Thome. "If he does, it is yours. I hope it is celery."</p>

<p>"You like celery, master?"</p>

<p>"No. It shall be for you. Celery is reputed to be a brain
food."</p>

<p>The door to the cell was unlocked, and three warriors entered.
One of them removed the chains from the prisoners' ankles.</p>

<p>"What now?" asked Atan Thome.</p>

<p>"The Queen has sent for you," replied the warrior.</p>

<p>The two men were led through the palace to a great room, at the
far end of which, upon a dais, a woman sat upon a throne hewn from
a single block of lava. Warriors flanked her on either side, and
slaves stood behind her throne ready to do her every bidding.</p>

<p>As the two men were led forward and halted before the dais, they
saw a handsome woman, apparently in her early thirties. Her hair
was so dressed that it stood out straight from her head in all
directions to a length of eight or ten inches and had woven into it
an ornate headdress of white plumes. Her mien was haughty and
arrogant as she eyed the prisoners coldly, and Atan Thome read
cruelty in the lines of her mouth and the latent fires of a quick
temper in the glint of her eyes. Here was a woman to be feared, a
ruthless killer, a human tigress. The equanimity of the smug
Eurasian faltered before a woman for the first time.</p>

<p>"Why came you to Ashair?" demanded the Queen.</p>

<p>"By accident, majesty; we were lost. When we found our way
blocked, we turned back. We were leaving the country when your
warriors took us prisoner."</p>

<p>"You have said that you have valuable information to give me.
What is it? If you have imposed upon me and wasted my time, it
shall not be well for you."</p>

<p>"I have powerful enemies," said Atan Thome. "It was while trying
to escape from them that I became lost. They are coming to Ashair
to attempt to steal a great diamond which they believe you to
possess. I only wished to befriend you and help you trap them."</p>

<p>"Are they coming in force?" asked Atka.</p>

<p>"That, I do not know," replied Thome; "but I presume they are.
They have ample means."</p>

<p>Queen Atka turned to one of her nobles. "If this man has spoken
the truth, he shall not fare ill at our hands. Akamen, I place the
prisoners in your charge. Permit them reasonable liberties. Take
them away." Then she spoke to another. "See that the approaches to
Ashair are watched."</p>

<p>Akamen, the noble, conducted Atan Thome and Lal Taask to
pleasant quarters in a far wing of the palace. "You are free to go
where you will inside the palace walls, except to the royal wing.
Nor may you go beneath the palace. There lie the secrets of Ashair
and death for strangers."</p>

<p>"The Queen has been most magnanimous," said Thome. "We shall do
nothing to forfeit her good will. Ashair is most interesting. I am
only sorry that we may not go out into the city or upon the
lake."</p>

<p>"It would not be safe," said Akamen. "You might be captured by a
galley from Thobos. They would not treat you as well as Atka
has."</p>

<p>"I should like to look down again at the beautiful building at
the bottom of the lake," said Thome. "That was my reason for
wishing to go upon the lake. What is the building? and what the
strange creature I saw coming from it?"</p>

<p>"Curiosity is often a fatal poison," said Akamen.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">CHAPTER 14</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE trail of Atan Thome's safari was not difficult
to follow, and the Gregory party made good time along it without
encountering any obstacles to delay them. The general mistrust of
Wolff, the doubts concerning Magra's position among them, and the
moody jealousy of Lavac added to the nervous strain of their
dangerous existence; and the hardships they had undergone had told
upon their nerves; so that it was not always a happy company that
trudged the day's trails. Only Tarzan remained serene and
unruffled.</p>

<p>It was midday, and they had halted for a brief rest, when Tarzan
suddenly became alert. "Natives are coming," he said. "There are a
number of them, and they are very close. The wind just changed and
brought their scent to me."</p>

<p>"There they are now," said Gregory. "Why, it's another safari.
There are porters with packs, but I see no white men."</p>

<p>"It is your safari, bwana," said Ogabi. "It is the safari that
was to have met you at Bonga."</p>

<p>"Then is must be the one that Thome stole," said d'Arnot, "but I
don't see Thome."</p>

<p>"Another mystery of darkest Africa, perhaps," suggested
Helen.</p>

<p>Mbuli, leading his people back toward Bonga, halted in surprise
as he saw the little party of whites, then, seeing that his men
greatly outnumbered them, he came forward, swaggering a little.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I am Mbuli," replied the chief.</p>

<p>"Where are your bwanas? You have deserted them."</p>

<p>"Who are you, white man, to question Mbuli?" demanded the
native, arrogantly, the advantage of numbers giving him
courage.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>Mbuli wilted. All the arrogance went out of him. "Forgive,
bwana," he begged. "I did not know you, for I have never seen you
before."</p>

<p>"You know the law of the safari," said Tarzan. "Those who desert
their white masters are punished."</p>

<p>"But my people would not go on," explained Mbuli. "When we came
to Tuen-Baka, they would go no farther. They were afraid, for
Tuen-Baka is taboo."</p>

<p>"You took all their equipment," continued the ape-man, glancing
over the loads that the porters had thrown to the ground. "Why, you
even took their food."</p>

<p>"Yes, bwana, but they needed no food&mdash;they were about to
die&mdash;Tuen-Baka is taboo. Also, Bwana Thome lied to us. We had
agreed to serve Bwana Gregory, but he told us Bwana Gregory wished
us to accompany him instead."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you did wrong to abandon him. To escape
punishment, you will accompany us to Tuen-Baka&mdash;we need
porters and askaris."</p>

<p>"But my people are afraid," remonstrated Mbuli.</p>

<p>"Where Tarzan goes, your people may go," replied the ape-man. "I
shall not lead them into danger needlessly."</p>

<p>"But, bwana&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But nothing," snapped Tarzan; then he turned to the porters.
"Up packs! You are going back to Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>The porters grumbled; but they picked up their packs and turned
back along the trail they had just traveled, for the will of the
white man was supreme; and, too, the word had spread among them
that this was the fabulous Tarzan who was half man and half
demon.</p>

<p>For three days they trekked back along the trail toward Ashair,
and at noon on the seventh day the safari broke from the forest
beside a quiet river. The terrain ahead was rocky and barren. Above
low hills rose the truncated cone of an extinct volcano, a black,
forbidding mass.</p>

<p>"So that is Tuen-Baka," said d'Arnot. "It is just an old
volcano, after all."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, the boys are afraid," said Tarzan. "We shall have
to watch them at night or they'll desert again. I'm going on now to
see what lies ahead."</p>

<p>"Be careful," cautioned d'Arnot. "The place has a bad
reputation, you know."</p>

<p>"I am always careful," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>D'Arnot grinned. "Sometimes you are about as careful of yourself
as a Paris taxi driver is of pedestrians."</p>

<p>Tarzan followed a dim trail that roughly paralleled the river,
the same trail that Lal Taask and Atan Thome had followed. As was
his custom, he moved silently with every sense alert. He saw signs
of strange animals and realized that he was in a country that might
hold dangers beyond his experience. In a small patch of earth among
the boulders and rough lava rocks, he saw the imprint of a great
foot and caught faintly the odor of a reptile that had passed that
way recently. He knew, from the size of the footprint, that the
creature was large; and when he heard ahead of him an ominous
hissing and roaring, he guessed that the maker of the footprint was
not far off. Increasing his speed, but not lessening his caution,
he moved forward in the direction of the sound; and coming to the
edge of a gully, looked down to see a strangely garbed white
warrior facing such a creature as Tarzan had never seen on earth.
Perhaps he did not know it, but he was looking at a small edition
of the terrible Tyrannosaurus Rex, that mighty king of carnivorous
reptiles which ruled the earth eons ago. Perhaps the one below him
was tiny compared with his gigantic progenitor; but he was still a
formidable creature, as large as a full-grown bull.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw in the warrior either a hostage or a means of
securing information concerning this strange country and its
inhabitants. If the dinosaur killed the man, he would be quite
valueless; so, acting as quickly as he thought, he leaped from the
cliff just as the brute charged. Only a man who did not know the
meaning of fear would have taken such a risk.</p>

<p>The warrior facing the great reptile with his puny spear was
stunned to momentary inaction when he saw an almost naked bronzed
giant drop, apparently from the blue, onto the back of the monster
he had been facing without hope. He saw the stranger's knife
striking futilely at the armored back, as the man clung with one
arm about the creature's neck. He could have escaped; but he did
not, and as Tarzan found a vulnerable spot in the dinosaur's throat
and drove his knife home again and again, he rushed in to the
ape-man's aid.</p>

<p>The huge reptile, seriously hurt, screamed and hissed as it
threw itself about in vain effort to dislodge the man-thing from
its back; but, hurt though it was, like all the reptilia it was
tenacious of life and far from overcome.</p>

<p>As Tarzan's knife found and severed the creature's jugular vein,
the warrior drove his spear through the savage heart, and with a
last convulsive shudder it crashed to the ground, dead; then the
two men faced one another across the great carcass.</p>

<p>Neither knew the temper or intentions of the other; and both
were on guard as they sought to find a medium of communication more
satisfactory than an improvised sign language. At last the warrior
hit upon a tongue that both could speak and understand, a language
he and his people had learned from the Negroes they had captured
and forced into slavery&mdash;Swahili.</p>

<p>"I am Thetan of Thobos," he said. "I owe you my life, but why
did you come to my aid? Are we to be friends or foes?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," said the ape-man. "Let us be friends."</p>

<p>"Let us be friends," agreed Thetan. "Now tell me how I may repay
you for what you have done for me."</p>

<p>"I wish to go to Ashair," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>The warrior shook his head. "You have asked me one thing that I
cannot do for you," he said. "The Asharians are our enemies. If I
took you there, we'd both be imprisoned and destroyed; but perhaps
I can persuade my king to let you come to Thobos; then, when the
day comes that we conquer Ashair, you may enter the city with us.
But why do you wish to go to Ashair?"</p>

<p>"I am not alone," said Tarzan, "and in my party are the father
and sister of a man we believe to be a prisoner in Ashair. It is to
obtain his release that we are here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps my King will let you all come to Thobos," said Thetan,
rather dubiously. "Such a thing would be without precedent; but
because you have saved the life of his nephew and because you are
enemies of Ashair, he may grant permission. At least it will do no
harm to ask him."</p>

<p>"How may I know his answer?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I can bring it to you, but it will be some time before I can do
so," replied Thetan. "I am down here on a mission for the King. I
came by way of the only land trail out of Tuen-Baka, a trail known
only to my people. I shall sleep tonight in a cave I know of, and
tomorrow start back for Thobos. In three days I shall return if
Herat will permit you to enter Thobos. If I do not come back, you
will know that he has refused. Wait then no more than one day; then
leave the country as quickly as you can. It is death for strangers
to remain in the vicinity of Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>"Come back to my camp," said Tarzan, "and spend the night there.
We can discuss the matter with my companions."</p>

<p>Thetan hesitated. "They are all strangers to me," he said, "and
all strangers are enemies."</p>

<p>"My friends will not be," the ape-man assured him. "I give you
my word that they will have no desire to harm you. In the world
from which they come no strangers are considered enemies until they
prove themselves to be such."</p>

<p>"What a strange world that must be," remarked Thetan. "But I'll
accept your word and go with you."</p>

<p>As the two men started back toward the Gregory camp, a party of
warriors embarked in a galley at the quay of Ashair, dispatched by
Queen Atka to intercept and harass the Gregory expedition, against
which Atan Thome had warned her in order that he might win the
favor of the Queen and prevent Tarzan and Gregory from reaching
Ashair. The wily Eurasian had hopes of so ingratiating himself with
the Queen that he might remain in Ashair until he could formulate a
plan for stealing The Father of Diamonds and making his escape. So
obsessed was he by his desire to possess the diamond, that he was
totally unable to appreciate the futility of his scheme.</p>

<p>The members of the Gregory party were astonished to see Tarzan
walk into camp with this strangely appareled warrior. Thetan wore
the black plumes of Thobos, and upon the breast and back of his
tunic there was embroidered the figure of a bull. Their friendly
greetings put him at his ease, and though the Swahili of Gregory,
Helen and Lavac was a little lame, they all managed fairly well in
the conversation that ensued. He told them much of Tuen-Baka, of
Thobos and Ashair; but when the subject of The Father of Diamonds
was broached, he was evasive; and, out of courtesy, they did not
press him. But his reticence only served to whet their curiosity,
as they sensed the mystery that surrounded the fabulous stone.</p>

<p>Late that night the silence of the sleeping camp was broken by
sepulchral voices keening out of the mystery of the surrounding
darkness. Instantly the camp was awake and in confusion, as the
terrified natives milled in panic. So terrified were they that they
might have bolted for the forest had it not been that glowing
death's-heads suddenly appeared floating in the air around the
camp, as the voices warned, "Turn back! Turn back! Death awaits you
in forbidden Ashair."</p>

<p>"The Asharians!" cried Thetan.</p>

<p>Tarzan, seeking to solve the mystery of the weird apparitions,
sprang into the night in the direction of the nearest death's-head.
D'Arnot sought to rally the askaris; but they were as terrified as
the porters, many of whom crouched with their foreheads pressed to
the ground, while others covered their ears or their eyes with
trembling hands.</p>

<p>Into the midst of this confusion burst half a dozen Asharian
warriors. The whites met them with drawn pistols. Wolff fired and
missed; then the intruders were gone as suddenly as they had come.
Above the turmoil of the camp rose a woman's terrified scream.</p>

<p>Pursuing the grinning skull into the darkness, the ape-man
seized a flesh-and-blood man, as he had expected. The fellow put up
a fight; but he was no match for the steel thewed man of the
jungles, who quickly disarmed him and dragged him back into
camp.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Tarzan to the natives, pointing to the
phosphorescent mask of his prisoner. "It is only a trick; you need
be afraid no more. He is a man, even as you and I." Then he turned
to his prisoner.

<p>"You may go," he said. "Tell your people that we
do not come as enemies, and that if they will send Brian Gregory
out to us, we will go away."</p>

<p>"I will tell them," said the warrior; but when he was safely out
of the camp, he called back, "You will never see Brian Gregory, for
no stranger who enters The Forbidden City ever comes out
alive."</p>

<p>"We are well out of that," said Gregory, with a sigh. "I don't
take much stock in what that fellow just said. He was just trying
to frighten us. That was what the voices and the death's-heads and
the raid were for, but for a while I thought that we were in for a
lot of trouble."</p>

<p>"Who screamed?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It sounded like one of the girls," said Lavac, "but it may have
been a porter. They were scared nearly to death."</p>

<p>It was then that Magra came running toward them. "Helen is
gone!" she cried. "I think they got her," and at that very moment
Asharian warriors were dragging Helen into a galley at the edge of
the river only a short distance from the camp. During the confusion
they had deliberately caused in the Gregory camp, a warrior had
seized Helen; and then they had all made off for the river where
the galley lay. A palm over her mouth had silenced the girl; and
she was helpless against their strength, as they hurried her aboard
the craft.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Thetan. "Their galley must be close by in the
river. We may be able to overtake them before they can put off,"
and, followed by the others, he ran from the camp; but when they
reached the river, they saw the galley already out of their reach
and moving steadily up stream beneath the steady strokes of its
long oars.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed d'Arnot. "We must do something. We cannot
let them take her away without doing something."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked Gregory in a broken voice.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will never see her again," said Thetan. "She is
beautiful; so they will probably take her to the temple of The
Father of Diamonds to be hand-maiden to the priests. No alien who
enters there ever comes out alive. Tomorrow, she will be as dead to
the outer world as though she had never existed."</p>

<p>"Is there no way to overtake them?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Thetan. "There is a bare possibility. If they
camp tonight this side of the tunnel that leads into Lake Horus we
might be able to do so; but it is a hard trail, and only strong men
could travel it."</p>

<p>"Will you guide me?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Thetan, "but what can we two alone expect to achieve
against a galley load of Asharian warriors?"</p>

<p>For answer, Tarzan raised his face toward the heavens and voiced
a weird cry; then he turned to d'Arnot. "Come," he said, "you will
go with us."</p>

<p>"I'll go, too," said Lavac. "You'll need all the men you can
get."</p>

<p>"You'll stay here," said Tarzan. "We must have protection for
the camp."</p>

<p>Lavac grumbled; but he knew that when Tarzan gave an order it
was to be obeyed; and, scowling at d'Arnot, he watched the three
men disappear into the darkness.</p>

<p>As Thetan led them by the way he knew, his mind was occupied by
thoughts of this strange, white giant who had come into his life.
His great strength and his fearlessness impressed the Thobotian,
but the man seemed eccentric. That strange cry he had given just as
they were leaving camp! Now, what could have been his reason for
that? He was still pondering this, when he heard grumblings and
growlings coming out of the night behind them and growing louder.
Something was following them. He glanced back and saw a blur of
great black forms on the trail behind the two men who followed
them.</p>

<p>"Something is behind you!" he warned them.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tarzan. "My apes are coming with us. I called
them before we left camp."</p>

<p>"Your apes!" exclaimed Thetan.</p>

<p>"Yes; they will make good allies, and they can go where even
strong men cannot. The Asharians will be surprised to see
them."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Thetan, who was very much surprised himself; and
his awe increased, not for the apes, but for the man who could
control them.</p>

<p>The way grew steeper, as Thetan led them up into the hills to
reach the head of the ravine where the Asharians would camp if they
camped at all.</p>

<p>"How much farther is it?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"We should get there just about dawn," replied Thetan.</p>

<p>"If they are camped there, we should take them by surprise, for
they could not imagine that any one could reach them; and
consequently they may not have any one on watch."</p>

<p>"Poor Helen!" said d'Arnot. "What will become of her if they
went on to Ashair without stopping?"</p>

<p>"You will never see her again," replied Thetan. "For generations
my people have been trying to conquer Ashair and reach the temple
and The Father of Diamonds, yet we have never succeeded. How can
you hope to accomplish what we have never been able to?"</p>

<p>"She must be there," said d'Arnot. "She must!"</p>

<p>"There is a possibility," explained Thetan, "but it is only a
possibility."</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">CHAPTER 15</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WOLFF was genuinely terrified. The weird
occurrences, the raid on the camp, the show of force by the
Asharians had all contributed to impress him with the grave dangers
and the futility of the venture. His desire to live outweighed his
avarice, and The Father of Diamonds was forgotten in his anxiety to
escape what he believed to be the certain fate of the party if it
sought to enter The Forbidden City of Ashair.</p>

<p>When, at last, the camp slept, he awoke Mbuli. "Are you and your
people going to stay here and be killed or forced into slavery?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"My people are afraid," replied the headman, "but what are we to
do? We are afraid to stay here, and we are afraid to run away from
the great Bwana Tarzan."</p>

<p>"You will never see that monkey-man again," Wolff assured the
black. "He and the frog eater will be killed by the Asharians, who
will then come back and either kill all of us or take us with them
as slaves. How would you like to be chained to a galley all the
rest of your life?"</p>

<p>"I would not like it, bwana," replied Mbuli.</p>

<p>"Then listen to me. The girl here is in danger. I got to save
her; so I orders you and your boys to take us back to Bonga. How
many do you think will come with you?"</p>

<p>"All, bwana."</p>

<p>"Good! Now get busy. Have 'em get their packs together, but see
that they don't make no noise. When everything's ready, you take a
couple of boys and get the girl. Don't let her make no noise."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>After a night of sleeplessness and terrified apprehension for
the future, Helen's attention was attracted by a slight noise in
the forest behind the camp where her captors had halted for the
night. Dawn was breaking, its ghastly light relieving the darkness
that had enveloped the little ravine and revealing to the girl's
astonished eyes the figures of great apes and men stealing
stealthily upon the camp.</p>

<p>At first she was terrified by this new menace; then she
recognized Tarzan and almost simultaneously saw d'Arnot behind him;
and hope, that she had thought dead, welled strong within her, so
that she could scarcely restrain a cry of relief as she realized
that rescue was at hand; then an Asharian awoke and saw the danger.
With a shout that aroused the others, he leaped to his feet; and,
guessing that an attempt was being made to rescue the captive, he
seized her and dragged her, struggling, toward the galley.</p>

<p>With a shout of encouragement to her, d'Arnot sprang forward in
pursuit while two warriors engaged Tarzan, and Thetan and the apes
fell upon the others. The warrior who was carrying Helen off was
almost at the galley. He shouted to the slaves to make ready to put
off the moment he was aboard, but d'Arnot was pressing him so
closely he was compelled to turn and defend himself. D'Arnot faced
him with drawn pistol as the man raised his spear. Behind d'Arnot,
another warrior, who had escaped the apes, was running to the aid
of his fellow.</p>

<p>The Frenchman could not fire at the warrior facing him without
endangering Helen, and he did not know that another was approaching
from behind.</p>

<p>What takes so long to tell occupied but a few seconds of time,
for as the warrior was about to cast his spear, Helen, realizing
d'Arnot's predicament, threw herself to one side, exposing her
captor; and d'Arnot fired.</p>

<p>Tarzan, Thetan, and the apes had disposed of the remainder of
the Asharians, with the exception of the one who was threatening
d'Arnot from behind. The ape-man saw his friend's danger, but he
was too far away to reach the warrior who was threatening him,
before the man should drive his spear into d'Arnot's back. Helen
realized the danger, and cried a warning to the Frenchman. D'Arnot
swung about, his pistol ready; and pressed the trigger, but the
hammer fell futilely upon an imperfect cap; then Tarzan launched
his spear. His target was far beyond the range of any spear but
that of the Lord of the Jungle. With all of his great strength,
backed by the weight of his body, he cast the weapon; and, as the
Asharian was lunging at d'Arnot, it passed through his body,
piercing his heart. As the man fell dead at d'Arnot's feet, Helen
went suddenly weak. She would have fallen had not d'Arnot taken her
in his arms.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Thetan. "That was a close call, but what a
cast! In all my life I have never seen one that could compare with
it."</p>

<p>"In all your life," said d'Arnot, "you have never seen such a
man as Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>Tarzan had passed them and reached the galley, where the slaves
sat bewildered, not knowing what to do; then he called the apes and
ordered them into the galley among the terrified slaves.</p>

<p>"They won't harm you," Tarzan assured them, and when Helen,
d'Arnot and Thetan were aboard, he directed the slaves to row them
down river to the Gregory camp.</p>

<p>D'Arnot sat in the stern with his arm around Helen, who evinced
no inclination to resent the familiarity. On the contrary, she
seemed quite content.</p>

<p>"I thought I had lost you, darling," he whispered.</p>

<p>She made no reply, other than to snuggle closer and sigh
happily, which, to d'Arnot, was at least an acceptance of his love,
if not an avowal of her own. He was content to leave the matter as
it stood.</p>

<p>Gregory, Lavac, and Ogabi were standing by the river when the
galley rounded a bend and came within sight.</p>

<p>"The Asharians are returning!" cried Gregory. "We'd better get
into the forest and hide. We three haven't a chance against
them."</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Lavac. "That boat's full of apes."</p>

<p>"By George! So it is," exclaimed Gregory.</p>

<p>"And there is Bwana Tarzan," exclaimed Ogabi.</p>

<p>A few moments later the boat touched shore; and as the apes
poured out, Gregory took his daughter in his arms. "Thank God,
you've found her," he said to Tarzan, "but now we have some bad
news for you."</p>

<p>"What now?" demanded d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Magra and Wolff deserted with all the men and equipment last
night," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't believe that Magra would have done a thing like
that," exclaimed Helen.</p>

<p>Gregory shook his head. "Don't forget," he reminded her, "that
she was in cahoots with Thome."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Lavac, "she's gone."</p>

<p>"What are we to do now?" demanded Gregory. "It looks like the
end of the trail to me."</p>

<p>"On the way down," said Tarzan, "I questioned some of the galley
slaves. They tell me that a white man is held prisoner in the
temple of The Father of Diamonds at Ashair. It may be your son. I
have talked with Thetan; and he believes it may be possible that
the King of Thobos will receive us kindly and even help in the
rescue of your son, if there is any possibility that it may be
accomplished. Under the circumstances, it may be well to go to
Thobos. We have a galley, and by entering the lake after dark we
should be able to pass Ashair safely."</p>

<p>"I should like to do that," said Gregory, "but I can't ask the
rest of you to risk your lives further for me. Had I had any idea
that we were to encounter such dangers, I should never have started
out without a strong force of white men."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"And I," said Lavac.</p>

<p>"Where Bwana Tarzan goes, I go," said Ogabi.</p>

<p>"Then we all go," said the ape-man.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>An exhausted warrior stumbled into the presence of Atka, Queen
of Ashair. "We were camped for the night in the ravine below the
tunnel," he reported. "We had with us a girl whom we had captured
in the camp of the strangers. At dawn we were attacked by three men
and a band of apes. One of the men was a Thobotian. The leader was
a naked white warrior. In the beginning of the fight, I was knocked
senseless. I knew nothing more until I regained consciousness and
found myself alone with the dead. The galley was gone. I think they
must have thought me dead."</p>

<p>"Which way did they go?" demanded Atka.</p>

<p>"That I do not know," replied the warrior, "but it is probable
that they went back down stream to their camp."</p>

<p>The Queen turned to a noble standing near the throne. "Man six
galleys," she ordered, "and bring me those people, dead or alive!
They shall taste the anger of Brulor!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">CHAPTER 16</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WOLFF had stumbled along the back trail all night,
and his disposition had not been improved by the fact that he had
had to drag a resisting Magra most of the way. He had stopped now
for a brief rest. The boys had dropped their packs and thrown
themselves to the ground. Wolff was wiping the sweat from his
forehead and glaring at the girl.</p>

<p>"You might as well come along peaceable," said the man. "It'll
be easier for both of us. I got you, and I'm goin' to keep you. You
might as well make up your mind to that."</p>

<p>"You're wasting your time," replied Magra. "You can lead a horse
to water, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I can make it drink, too," growled Wolff. "Come here, you!"
He seized her and drew her to him.</p>

<p>With her right hand, Magra attempted to push him away, while her
left hand sought the pistol at his hip. "Stop!" she cried, "or,
before God, I'll kill you!" but Wolff only laughed at her and drew
her closer.</p>

<p>He died with the ugly grin upon his face, as Magra wrested his
weapon from its holster and shot him through the chest. As Wolff
fell, Mbuli leaped to his feet, followed by his boys. The white
girl was alone now, in their power, and Mbuli knew where she would
bring a good price. Also, there were two thousand English pounds on
the dead man.</p>

<p>Magra swung around and faced Mbuli. "Pick up your loads and get
going back to camp!" she ordered. Mbuli hesitated and came toward
her. His attitude was insubordinate and threatening. "Do as I tell
you, Mbuli," snapped the girl, "or you'll get what Wolff got."</p>

<p>"We are tired," said Mbuli, seeking time. "Let us rest."</p>

<p>"You can rest in camp. Get going!"</p>

<p>Urging the men on, Magra drove them back along the trail toward
camp. They grumbled, but they obeyed, for they had seen her kill
Wolff. She walked behind them, with Mbuli just in front of her; and
she never let him forget that a pistol was aimed at the small of
his back. She would have driven them faster had she known that her
companions were about to abandon the camp along a route she could
not follow, but she did not know.</p>

<p>As the others in the Gregory camp discussed their plans, Lavac
stood aside moodily, eyeing d'Arnot and Helen who stood hand in
hand; and as the others went to their tents to gather a few of the
personal belongings the deserting porters had left behind, he
accosted d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"You are very familiar with Mam'selle Helen," he said; "and I
resent it, but I suppose she prefers you because you are a captain
and have more money than I."</p>

<p>D'Arnot, ordinarily slow to anger, flushed and then went white.
"And I resent that, you pig!" he snapped, slapping Lavac across the
face.</p>

<p>"You can't do that to me!" growled Lavac, whipping his gun from
its holster.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Tarzan chanced to be passing close to Lavac. He
leaped between the two men and seized the lieutenant's gun hand.
"None of that!" he snapped. "We've enough troubles without fighting
among ourselves. I'll keep your gun until you cool off and get a
little sense. Now, into the barge, all of you. We're leaving for
Thobos at once."</p>

<p>"We can't have any of this," said Gregory. "If Lieutenant Lavac
feels as he does, I think he had better wait here for us."</p>

<p>"How about it, Lavac?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It will not occur again," said the man. "I lost my head. If
Captain d'Arnot will accept my apology, I offer it."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said d'Arnot. "I regret the whole affair, and I am
sorry that I struck you." Then the two men shook hands quite
perfunctorily, and separated coldly. It was obvious that from now
on nothing but bad blood would exist between them.</p>

<p>"What about the apes?" asked Gregory, more to bridge the awkward
silence than because he was interested.</p>

<p>"I have told them to stay around here for a moon and hunt,"
replied Tarzan. "If they don't forget it, they'll stay, unless the
hunting is very poor."</p>

<p>As Tarzan was about to board the galley, his keen ears caught
the sound of approaching footsteps from the direction of the
forest. "Someone is coming," he said. "We'll wait and see who it
is. Be ready to push off&mdash;they may not be friends."</p>

<p>Presently the head of a safari came into view, debouching from
the forest. "Why, those are our men!" exclaimed Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tarzan, "and there's Magra bringing up the rear. You
were quite right about her."</p>

<p>"I was sure she'd never desert us like that," said Helen. "I
wonder where Wolff is."</p>

<p>"She's got a gun on Mbuli," said d'Arnot. "There is a
woman!"</p>

<p>Magra herded them down to the river, where she told briefly of
how Wolff had persuaded Mbuli and his men to abduct her and desert,
and of Wolff's death. "I found these on him," she said, "The £2000
of which he defrauded Mr. Gregory and Thome and the map he stole
from Helen's room."</p>

<p>"We are well rid of him," said Gregory.</p>

<p>Tarzan ordered the natives to load all of the supplies and
equipment on board the galley, and when they had done so he
dismissed them.</p>

<p>"You may wait here for us if you wish," he said, "or you may go
back to your own country. Eventually you will be punished for what
you have done."</p>

<p>Bending to their oars, the slaves drove the galley up stream, as
the members of the party momentarily relaxed from the nervous
strain of the past hours. Lavac sat in the bow, looking forward, so
that he would not see d'Arnot and Helen sitting close to one
another. Magra sat beside Tarzan. All were quiet, grateful for the
peace and restfulness of the river. For a time, at least, their way
seemed assured as far as Thobos, for they would pass Ashair by
night. What their reception in Thobos would be was uncertain. Even
Thetan could assure them of nothing more than that he would
intercede with his uncle, the King, in their behalf; but he thought
that the fact that Tarzan had saved his life and that they were all
enemies of the Asharians would go a long way toward insuring them a
friendly attitude on the part of King Herat.</p>

<p>Magra sighed and turned to Tarzan. "You have all been so
splendid to me," she said, "although you knew that I was an
accomplice of Thome. I want you to know that I am loyal to you
now."</p>

<p>Tarzan made no reply. His attention was centered on another
matter. The galley was too heavily laden. Its gunwales were almost
awash as it moved slowly up the narrow gorge.</p>

<p>"We'll have to put some of this stuff ashore in that ravine where
we found Helen," he said. "If we ran into swift water in the river
or any sort of a blow on the lake, we'd founder."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Lavac. "Here comes a galley."</p>

<p>"An Asharian!" exclaimed Thetan, "and there are others right
behind it."</p>

<p>"Six of 'em," said Lavac.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Gregory. "We'd better turn back."</p>

<p>"They'd overtake us in no time," said Thetan. "We're in for
it."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled. "There is nothing to do, then, but fight," he
said.</p>

<p>"We haven't a chance, have we?" asked Magra.</p>

<p>"It doesn't look like it," replied d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"If there is such a thing as a jinx," said Helen, "we certainly
have one camping on our trail."</p>

<p>The narrow gorge echoed to the war cries of the Asharians, as
their galleys bore down on their hapless victims. Gregory's party
met them with gunfire and arrows, while the short Asharian spears
hurtled about them. As the men had leaped to their feet to fire
over the heads of the slaves, the galley tipped dangerously,
shipping water and spoiling their aim. A spear struck one of the
oarsmen; and as he lurched forward, dead, his oar fouled that of
another slave; and a moment later the galley swung broadside across
the river as the leading Asharian galley, sped down stream by forty
oars, bore down upon it. There was a crash of splintering wood as
the prow of the enemy rammed the Gregory galley amidships. Already
listing crazily, she careened to the impact; and as the water
poured over her port gunwale, she began to sink, leaving her
passengers floundering in the river and her slaves screaming in
their chains; then the other galleys moved in to pick up the
survivors.</p>

<p>D'Arnot and Helen were dragged into the galley farthest up
stream, which immediately set out for Ashair. The other members of
the party had drifted down stream before they were finally picked
up by a second galley. Tarzan had swum beside Magra, encouraging
and supporting her, while Gregory, Lavac, and Ogabi remained
nearby. Night was falling, and it would soon be dark in the narrow
gorge. When they were in the craft, they saw that Thetan was
already there, having been picked up before they were; but Helen
and d'Arnot were not there; and the boat in which they were
prisoners was out of sight around a bend in the river.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of Helen?" asked Gregory, but no one
had.</p>

<p>"I could almost wish that she drowned," he added. "God! Why did
I ever undertake this stupid venture?"</p>

<p>"It would have been better had we all drowned," said Thetan.
"There is no hope for those who fall into the hands of the
Asharians."</p>

<p>"All that has happened to us so far," said Tarzan, "is that we
have gotten wet. Wait until something really bad happens before you
give up hope."</p>

<p>"But look at what lies ahead of us!" exclaimed Lavac.</p>

<p>"I do not know what lies ahead of us, and neither do you," the
ape-man reminded him; "therefore we might as well anticipate the
best as the worst."</p>

<p>"A most excellent philosophy," commented Gregory, "but a strain
on one's credulity."</p>

<p>"I think it is good," said Magra.</p>

<p>In the leading galley, Helen and d'Arnot sat huddled together,
shivering with cold.</p>

<p>"I wonder what became of the others," said the girl.</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear," replied d'Arnot; "but thank God that you
and I were not separated."</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, and then, "I suppose this is the end; but
we shall go together."</p>

<p>"Keep a stiff upper lip, darling. Don't give up hope; they
haven't harmed us yet."</p>

<p>"Poor Dad," said Helen. "Do you suppose he and all the others
drowned?"</p>

<p>"They may have been picked up, too," encouraged d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Little good it will do any of us," continued the girl. "No
wonder poor Brian never returned from Ashair. What was that?"</p>

<p>An eerie scream shattered the silence of the night,
reverberating weirdly in the narrow gorge.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">CHAPTER 17</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ATAN THOME and Lal Taask were taking their ease on
the terrace of Atka's palace, overlooking the lake. They were
treated like guests, but they knew that they were prisoners. Lal
Taask would have given his soul to be well out of the country; but
Atan Thome still harbored dreams of The Father of Diamonds, which
he pictured as a stone as large as a football. He often amused
himself by trying to compute its value; then he translated it into
pounds sterling and bought yachts and castles and great country
estates. He gave the most marvelous dinners that Paris had ever
known, and was fawned upon by the world's most beautiful women,
whom he covered with furs and jewels. But the walls of Ashair still
rose about him and, towering above those, the walls of
Tuen-Baka.</p>

<p>As they sat there, the noble Akamen joined them. "Your enemies
have probably been captured by this time," he said.</p>

<p>"What will happen to them?" asked Lal Taask. He was thinking of
what might be going to happen to him sooner or later.</p>

<p>"They shall know the wrath of Brulor," replied Akamen.</p>

<p>"Who is Brulor?" asked Thome.</p>

<p>"Brulor is our god, The Father of Diamonds," explained the
Asharian. "His temple lies at the bottom of Lake Horus, guarded by
the priests of Brulor and the waters of sacred Horus."</p>

<p>"But I thought that The Father of Diamonds was a diamond,"
exclaimed Atan Thome, terrified by the suggestion that it was a
man.</p>

<p>"What do you know of The Father of Diamonds?" demanded
Akamen.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Thome, hastily. "I have just heard the
term."</p>

<p>"Well," said Akamen, "it's something we are not supposed to
discuss with barbarians; but I don't mind telling you that The
Father of Diamonds is the name given both to Brulor and The Father
of Diamonds that reposes in the casket on the altar before his
throne in the temple."</p>

<p>Atan Thome breathed a sigh of relief. So there was a Father of
Diamonds after all. Suddenly there came faintly to their ears a
weird scream from far down the lake toward the tunnel that leads to
the outside world and carries the waters of Horus down to the sea
thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that was," said Akamen. "It sounded almost
human."</p>

<p>"Are there any apes around here?" asked Thome.</p>

<p>"No," replied Akamen; "why?"</p>

<p>"That sounded a little like an ape," said Atan Thome.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"It will be very dark inside there," said Tarzan, as the galley
in which he and his fellow prisoners were being taken to Ashair
approached the mouth of the tunnel leading to Lake Horus. He spoke
in English. "Each of you pick a couple of men; and when I say
'Kreegah,' throw them overboard. If we act very quickly, taking
them off their guard, we can do it; and as soon as you have two
overboard, go after more. I can't tell either Thetan or Ogabi now,
as the Asharians understand Swahili; but as soon as I give you the
signal, I shall tell them."</p>

<p>"And then what?" asked Lavac.</p>

<p>"Why, we'll take the boat, of course," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"We're likely to be killed," said Lavac, "but that's all right
with me."</p>

<p>As the galley neared the tunnel, a warrior in the bow lighted a
torch, for within the tunnel there would not be even the sky to
guide the helmsman. Tarzan regretted the torch, but he did not give
up his plan. Perhaps it might be more difficult now, but he felt
that it still had an excellent chance to succeed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ape-man sprang to his feet, and as he hurled a
warrior into the water his "Kre-e-gah!" rang through the
tunnel.</p>

<p>"Overboard with them!" he shouted, and Thetan and Ogabi grasped
the intent of his plan instantly.</p>

<p>Chaos and confusion reigned aboard the galley, as the five
desperate and determined men fell upon the Asharian warriors,
throwing or pushing them overboard. The astonished Asharians were
so taken by surprise that they at first fell easy victims to the
plan, but later those who had escaped the first sudden rush of the
prisoners, rallied and put up a defense that threatened the success
of the ape-man's bold plan.</p>

<p>Magra, seated amidships, was in the center of the melee.
Crouched between two galley slaves, she watched the savage scene
with fascinated, fearless eyes. The flaring torch in the bow of the
galley painted the scene in dancing highlights and deep shadows
against a background of Stygian gloom, a moving picture of
embattled souls upon the brink of Hell; and through it moved, with
the strength, the agility, and the majesty of a great lion, the
godlike figure of the Lord of the Jungle. She saw, too, the threat
of defeat that she was helpless to avert; and then she heard Thetan
shout, "Help us, slaves, and win your freedom!"</p>

<p>Almost as one man the slaves rose in their chains and lashed out
at their former masters with oars or fists. Screaming, cursing men
were hurled into the black waters. A warrior lunged at Tarzan's
back with his sword; but Magra caught his ankle and tripped him,
and he fell between two slaves, who pitched him overboard.</p>

<p>As the yells and screams echoed through the tunnel, Helen
pressed closer to d'Arnot. "They are fighting back there," she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Frenchman. "The first scream was Tarzan's
warning 'kreegah,' so you may rest assured that they are
fighting."</p>

<p>"At least we know that they were not all drowned," said the
girl. "Perhaps Dad is still alive, but what chance have they
against all those warriors?"</p>

<p>"There is always a chance for the side upon which Tarzan
fights," replied d'Arnot. "I'd feel much better on your account if
you were back there in the galley that he's in."</p>

<p>"If you were there, too," she said; "otherwise I'd rather be
here."</p>

<p>He pressed her closer to him. "What an ironical fate that we
could only have met and loved under circumstances such as these.
For me, it is worth the price, no matter what that price may be.
But for you&mdash;well, I wish you had never come to Africa."</p>

<p>"Is that the gallant Frenchman?" she teased.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you are still glad that I came to Africa, and so am
I&mdash;no matter what happens."</p>

<p>Back in the rearmost galley, the last of their adversaries
disposed of, the little company took stock of their losses. "Where
is Ogabi?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"An Asharian dragged him overboard," said Magra, "poor
fellow."</p>

<p>"He was well avenged," said Lavac.</p>

<p>"Only Helen and d'Arnot are missing now," said Gregory. "If they
weren't drowned, they must be in one of the galleys ahead of us. Is
there no way in which we might rescue them?"</p>

<p>"There are five galleys ahead of us," said Thetan. "We are only
four men. We would stand no chance against five galleys of Asharian
warriors. The only possible hope that we may entertain of saving
them is in enlisting my King's aid, but I have already told you
that the Thobotians have never been able to enter Ashair. About the
best we may hope to do is to save ourselves, and that may not be so
easy if any of the galleys ahead of us are lying in wait for us.
We'll have to put out our torch and take a chance in the
darkness."</p>

<p>When the galley finally reached the end of the tunnel and the
lake spread before them, a seemingly vast expanse of water beneath
the dim light of the stars, they saw the glimmering torches of five
galleys far to their left and just beyond them the lights of
Ashair. No galley had lain in wait for them, and the way to Thobos
lay open to them.</p>

<p>It was shortly after dawn that they approached the quay at
Thobos. A company of warriors stood ready to receive them, and even
though Thetan stood in full view of them in the bow of the galley,
their attitude was no less belligerent.</p>

<p>"They don't seem very friendly," remarked Magra. "Perhaps we are
jumping from the frying pan into the fire."</p>

<p>"Who comes?" demanded one of the warriors.</p>

<p>"Thetan, nephew of King Herat," replied Thetan.</p>

<p>"We recognize Thetan, but the others are strangers," said the
warrior.</p>

<p>"They are friends," explained Thetan.</p>

<p>"They are strangers, and strangers may only enter Thobos as
prisoners," insisted the warrior. "If they would land without
battle, let them throw down their arms."</p>

<p>Under these conditions, the party was allowed to land, but they
were immediately surrounded by scowling warriors. "You know,
Thetan," said the leader, "that it is against the law to bring
strangers to Thobos; and therefore, even though you be nephew to
him, I must arrest you with the others and take you all before King
Herat."</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18">CHAPTER 18</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HELEN and d'Arnot were imprisoned briefly in a
dungeon of the palace at Ashair; then they were summoned to appear
before the Queen. As they were led into the throne room, Helen
exclaimed in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, there are Thome and Taask!" she whispered to d'Arnot,
"there, at the side of the dais."</p>

<p>"So that is Thome," said d'Arnot. "I'd like to get my hands on
him. They don't seem to be prisoners. I wonder what it means."</p>

<p>"Silence!" ordered one of their guard. As they were led to the
foot of the dais, Atka eyed them sternly. "Why came you to The
Forbidden City?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"To find my brother, Brian Gregory," replied Helen.</p>

<p>"You lie!" snapped Atka. "You came to steal The Father of
Diamonds."</p>

<p>"The girl is innocent, O Queen," said Thome. "It was the man and
his companions who sought The Father of Diamonds. If you will give
the girl into my keeping, I will be responsible for her."</p>

<p>"The girl speaks the truth," cried d'Arnot. "She came solely to
find her brother, but that man lies. It was he who came to steal
The Father of Diamonds. Why else should he have come? He has no
brother here. There is no other reason why he should have
undertaken the expensive and dangerous journey to Ashair."</p>

<p>"You all lie," snapped Atka. "Send the girl to the temple as
handmaiden to the priests. Imprison the men."</p>

<p>Suddenly, before they could prevent him, d'Arnot tore away from
his guards and leaped upon Atan Thome, his strong fingers closing
upon the Eurasian's throat to kill him.</p>

<p>"If it's the last thing in life I do!" he cried, but warriors
leaped in and dragged him away before he could consummate his
design.</p>

<p>"To the cages with him!" ordered Atka. "He shall spend the rest
of his life looking at The Father of Diamonds he would have
profaned."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Helen!" he called back as warriors dragged him from
the throne room.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Paul!" That was all; but tears welled in her eyes as
they strained after the man she loved, whom she believed she was
looking upon for the last time.</p>

<p>As warriors seized Atan Thome and Lal Taask, Akamen stepped
close to the Queen and whispered a few words to her. She nodded,
and ordered the warriors to release the two men.</p>

<p>"I give these men into the keeping of Akamen," she said. "He
shall be responsible for them. Take the girl away. Let the women
purify her before she is taken to the priests."</p>

<p>Two warriors led d'Arnot down a long ramp to a crude elevator
operated by slaves at a windlass on the floor above. They entered
the cage with him, and the descent began down a dark shaft.</p>

<p>"I hope you took a good look at the world before you were
brought into the palace," remarked one of the warriors, "for it's
the last you'll ever see of it."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked d'Arnot. "Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>"To the temple of Brulor," replied the warrior. "It lies at the
bottom of Lake Horus, the sacred. You will spend the rest of your
life there. It may be a short life, or it may be a long one. After
you've spent a few weeks in the temple, you'll pray that it will be
short."</p>

<p>D'Arnot could not judge the depth of the long shaft down which
he was being lowered to what fate he could not guess. He might have
descended two hundred feet or it might have been more. Whatever it
was, he was convinced that there could be neither escape nor
rescue. At the foot of the shaft, the warriors turned him over to
two priests, who conducted him along a corridor that extended far
out beneath the lake. At the end of the corridor, he was led into a
large, oblong room, at the far end of which an old man sat upon an
ornate throne. Surrounding him were priests and handmaidens, and
before him an altar on which rested a large, jeweled casket.</p>

<p>Along both sides of the room were several cages, which reminded
d'Arnot of the cages in the lion house of a zoo; but here there
were no lions, only a few emaciated, almost naked men with unkempt
hair and beards.</p>

<p>The priests led d'Arnot to the foot of the throne. "Here is a
would-be profaner of The Father of Diamonds that Queen Atka has
sent as an offering to Brulor," said one of the priests.</p>

<p>"We already have too many to feed," grumbled the old man.
"Zytheb, put him in a cage."</p>

<p>A tall priest, carrying a great ring of keys at his belt, came
forward and led the way to one of the cages, which he unlocked and
motioned d'Arnot to enter. As the door clanged behind him, a sudden
chill ran through the Frenchman's body as though he were entering
his own tomb.</p>

<p>A half starved, bearded man in the next cage looked at d'Arnot
curiously. "Poor devil!" he said. "Did you, too, come in search of
The Father of Diamonds?"</p>

<p>"No," said d'Arnot. "I came looking for a man."</p>

<p>"What man?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"A man named Gregory, who is supposed to be a prisoner here,"
replied d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Most interesting," said the man. "But I cannot but wonder what
interest you would have had in looking for Brian Gregory, for, you
see, I am he; and I do not recall having known you."</p>

<p>"So you are Brian Gregory!" exclaimed d'Arnot. "I have found you
at last, but much good it will do either of us. But may I introduce
myself? I am Captain d'Arnot, of the French navy."</p>

<p>"That makes it all the more puzzling," said Gregory. "Why should
the French navy be looking for me?"</p>

<p>"It is not," replied d'Arnot. "I just chanced to be in Loango
when your father was arranging his expedition to come in search of
you, and I joined it."</p>

<p>"Oh, so Dad was coming after me? I hope he didn't."</p>

<p>"He did; and your sister, also."</p>

<p>"Helen? She didn't come here!"</p>

<p>D'Arnot nodded. "I regret to say that she did."</p>

<p>"Where is she? Where is Dad?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where your father is, but your sister was taken
prisoner with me. She is here in Ashair."</p>

<p>"God!" exclaimed Gregory. "And I brought them to this! I and
that damned thing out there in the casket."</p>

<p>"It is The Father of Diamonds?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that is what Brulor is called, too&mdash;The Father of
Diamonds. The big diamond is in the casket, and Brulor is the god
who guards it; so they call him The Father of Diamonds, too."</p>

<p>"The old man on the throne is Brulor?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>Brian nodded. "The old devil!"</p>

<p>D'Arnot's gaze wandered about the cages and the other prisoners.
"Are these all men from the outside world?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Brian. "Some are Asharians who have aroused the
wrath of Atka, some are from Thobos, and the one in the next cage
is Herkuf. He was a priest; but somehow he got in dutch with the
old man, and here he is."</p>

<p>"And there is no escape?" asked the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"None," said Brian.</p>

<p>As the two men talked, Asharian women had completed anointing
the body of Helen with aromatic oils in a chamber in the palace;
and were clothing her in the scant garments of a handmaiden.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate for you that you are beautiful," said one of
the women, "for because of that you will go to the priests instead
of to the warriors or the slaves. Of course you may be chosen for
sacrifice; but if not, you will not go to the warriors or slaves
until you are old and ugly."</p>

<p>The toilet completed, Helen was taken down the long shaft and
along the corridor to the throne room of Brulor; and as she
entered, two men saw her and their hearts went cold. One of them
called her by name as she was being led past his cage. She turned
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Brian!" she cried. "Oh, Brian, what have they done to you?"
Then she recognized the man in the next cage. "Paul! You are both
here!"</p>

<p>"Silence, woman!" commanded one of the priests escorting her;
then she was led before Brulor.</p>

<p>As the old man examined her, Zytheb, the priest who carried the
keys at his belt, whispered in Brulor's ear.</p>

<p>"What is your name, girl?" demanded Brulor.</p>

<p>"Helen," she replied.</p>

<p>"From what country do you come?"</p>

<p>"America."</p>

<p>Brulor scratched his head. "There is no such country," he said.
"There is a prisoner here who said he was from that country, but I
knew he was lying. You must not lie. You will get along better here
if you always tell the truth. Zytheb, you will take your place
beside the girl. Helen," he continued, "you shall serve Zytheb,
Keeper of the Keys; and see, girl, that you serve him well. Learn
the holy rites of the temple and obey Zytheb." He made some mystic
passes above the jeweled casket and mumbled in a strange jargon.
When he ceased, he looked up at the two standing before him.
"Zytheb and Helen are now man and wife!" he announced.</p>

<p>"What's happening?" demanded d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"The old devil's married Helen to that beast, Zytheb," replied
Brian with an oath; "and here we are caged up like wild beasts,
unable to help her. You can't know what it means to me, her
brother!"</p>

<p>"And you don't know what it means to me, Brian," said d'Arnot;
"I love her."</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19">CHAPTER 19</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THETAN, with Tarzan, Gregory, Magra, and Lavac,
was taken before Herat as a prisoner. Surrounding the throne of the
King were black plumed warriors; and at his side sat his queen,
Mentheb. Herat was a large man with a black spade beard and a
smooth upper lip. His face was hard, arrogant, and cruel. He
scowled, as he looked at Thetan.</p>

<p>"You know the laws of Thobos," he said, "and yet you dared bring
strangers here. Even my nephew may not thus break the laws of
Thobos with impunity. What have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I was being attacked by one of the great reptiles of the outer
slopes of Tuen-Baka," explained Thetan. "I should have been killed,
had not this man, Tarzan, at the risk of his own life, killed the
beast and saved mine. When I found that he and his companions were
enemies of the Asharians, I tried to help them, for I owed Tarzan a
great debt. I thought, my King, that you would feel even as I. They
may be strangers, but they are not enemies&mdash;they are my
friends, and they should be accepted as friends by my people and my
king."</p>

<p>Herat's scowl relaxed a little, and he sat in thought for
several minutes. "What you tell me," he said, "lessens your guilt;
and I forgive you, but the fact remains that they are strangers and
should be destroyed. However, because of the extraordinary
circumstances, I shall be lenient and give them a chance to live.
Their lives shall depend upon the fulfillment of three conditions;
that, in the arena, one of them kills an Asharian warrior. That is
the first. The second is that one of them kills a wild lion in the
arena, and the third that they bring me The Father of Diamonds from
the temple at Ashair."</p>

<p>Thetan turned to Tarzan. "I am sorry, my friend," he said, "that
I have brought you all here to die. You deserve a better fate."</p>

<p>"We are not dead yet," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Turn the girl over to the women. They will see that no harm
befalls her," said Herat. "Imprison the men until I send for one of
them to meet the Asharian. Take them away."</p>

<p>Warriors conducted Tarzan, Gregory, and Lavac to a cell in a
dungeon and chained them to a wall. The place was damp and cold,
and there was not even straw for them to lie upon.</p>

<p>"Hospitable country," remarked Lavac.</p>

<p>"At least, the King has a sense of humor," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"It is reflected in his benign countenance," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"One of us might kill the Asharian," reflected Lavac, "but
scarcely a wild lion. Well, there are three of us left. I wonder
which will be the next to go."</p>

<p>"And I wonder what will become of Magra," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"Old Herat couldn't keep his eyes off her," said Lavac. "I'll
bet he knows where she is."</p>

<p>"They turned her over to the women," said Tarzan. "I hope Thetan
will be able to help her."</p>

<p>"She's going to need help," remarked Lavac, "and there will be
none."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>In Ashair, Atan Thome and Lal Taask sat in a pleasant room with
the noble Akamen. If the wages of sin are death, it must have been
that the paymaster was napping, for Atan Thome and Lal Taask seemed
launched upon a life of ease and luxury.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate for you," said Akamen, "that I have influence
with the Queen; otherwise, you would both be languishing in the
cages of the temple of Brulor; and I can assure you that that is
not a pleasant place to be."</p>

<p>"We owe you a great debt of gratitude, my friend," replied Atan
Thome.</p>

<p>"One which you will be able to repay, perhaps," said Akamen.
"You will recall what I told you."</p>

<p>Atan Thome nodded. "Yes," he said; "that you are cousin of the
Queen and that when she dies, you will be King."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Akamen; "but the most important to you is
that if I were King, your lives would no longer be in danger; and,
if you so desired, it might be arranged that you leave Ashair and
return to your own country."</p>

<p>"With your guidance and advice, most noble Akamen," Atan Thome
assured him, "I am sure that it can be accomplished most
expeditiously."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Gregory and Lavac were stiff and lame when they awoke the
following morning after a night of fitful slumber. Tarzan, inured
to hardships, had fared better.</p>

<p>"Lord, what a night!" groaned Gregory. "If the builders of this
place had searched every geological formation of the earth's crust
they couldn't have found any stone harder than these lava
slabs."</p>

<p>"Nor colder," added Lavac. "Don't you suppose there is any way
in which we could escape? I'd rather take any risk than stay here.
Couldn't we overpower whomever brings our food?"</p>

<p>"Quiet!" cautioned Tarzan. "Some one is coming."</p>

<p>The others had heard nothing. It was the keen ears of the
ape-man which had caught the faint sound of sandals on the stone
floor of the corridor leading to the cell. A moment later a key was
turned in the lock, and three warriors entered.</p>

<p>"One of you is to fight an Asharian," said one. "He is a giant,
a famous killer of men. If he wins, and he will, he gets his
freedom. Which one of you wishes to be killed first?"</p>

<p>"Let me go," said Lavac. "I would as soon be dead as here."</p>

<p>"No," said Gregory. "Let me go. I am old."</p>

<p>"I shall go," said Tarzan, "and I shall not be killed."</p>

<p>The warriors laughed. "Boast while you may," said one.</p>

<p>They led Tarzan to a small arena, a courtyard enclosed by the
palace buildings that surrounded it. At one end was a gallery for
spectators, and here sat King Herat and Queen Mentheb with their
court. Tarzan glanced up at them, and saw that Thetan was there,
too. A guard of plumed warriors stood behind the King and Queen,
and at either end of the gallery a trumpeter was posted. As Tarzan
stood waiting in the center of the arena, the trumpeters raised
their instruments to their lips and sounded a fanfare; and through
a small doorway beneath the royal box a huge man entered the
arena.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Tarzan!" shouted Thetan.</p>

<p>"He'll need it," said Herat. "A thousand to one he dies."</p>

<p>"Taken!" said Thetan.</p>

<p>The Asharian approached Tarzan and commenced to circle about
him, looking for an opening. "I have killed such men as Memet," he
boasted. "I shall take great pleasure in killing you."</p>

<p>Tarzan only growled, as early training and environment had
taught him to do; but that growl brought a startled look to the
face of the Asharian, for it was the growl of a lion. It shook his
nerves a little, and he decided to get the thing over as quickly as
possible; so he charged at close quarters with the intention of
crushing his adversary in his mighty embrace. Thus he had crushed
Memet, caving in his chest until his splintered ribs punctured his
heart; and Tarzan let him get his hold. It was the hold he wished
the other to have. The Asharian applied all the pressure of his
great strength, but that mighty chest did not give an inch. He was
amazed. It was unbelievable. Then Tarzan, growling, sought his
foe's jugular with his teeth; and the Asharian was frankly
terrified. Quickly he broke away and stepped back.</p>

<p>"What are you?" he cried, "man or beast?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes. I kill!" growled the ape-man.</p>

<p>Like a cornered rat fearing death but forced to fight for
self-preservation, the Asharian charged with lowered head; and as
Tarzan sought to side-step, he slipped; and the other caught him
full in the chest with his head, knocking him to the ground; then
the Asharian turned and leaped high in the air to land upon his fallen
foe and crush him. A shout arose from the royal box. "I win!" cried
Herat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted Thetan; "but not yet&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>While the Asharian was in mid-air, Tarzan rolled quickly to one
side; and the other landed heavily on the flagging. Both men sprang
to their feet instantly; and the Asharian, whipping a dagger from
his sash, sprang at the ape-man. He had broken the rules of the
contest, but he was too terrified to care about that. His only
thought was to kill the beast-man.</p>

<p>As his foe charged with raised dagger, Tarzan leaped to one
side, wheeled quickly and seized him from behind; then he swung him
high above his head and hurled him to the flagging. He could have
killed him then, but he preferred to play with him as a cat plays
with a mouse. It was the Asharian's punishment for attempting to
use a dagger; and, too, it was the humor of the jungle, which is
grim and terrible.</p>

<p>The man scrambled to his feet; and as Tarzan slunk slowly toward
him he turned and fled, begging for mercy. The ape-man pursued him;
and, though he could have caught him easily, he remained just a few
paces behind him, voicing an occasional growl to add to the terror
of his quarry.</p>

<p>"Did you invite us here to watch a foot race?" asked Thetan,
laughing.</p>

<p>King Herat smiled. "Something seems to have gone wrong with the
famous killer of men," he said.</p>

<p>Driven to desperation by terror, the Asharian turned at bay.
Tarzan stopped and commenced to circle his adversary, low growls
rumbling in his throat. Suddenly the terrified man raised his
dagger and plunged it into his own heart.</p>

<p>"You lose, Herat," laughed Thetan.</p>

<p>"But your Tarzan didn't kill him," objected the king.</p>

<p>"He frightened him to death," said Thetan.</p>

<p>Herat laughed. "You win," he admitted. "Send for the man. I have
something to say to him."</p>

<p>"Never have I seen such a man," said Queen Mentheb. "Such a one
should not be destroyed."</p>

<p>Tarzan, brought to the royal box, stood before the King and
Queen.</p>

<p>"You have won your freedom fairly," said Herat, "and I am going
to change the conditions. You shall be free regardless of the
fulfillment of the other two conditions. The others each may win
his freedom in turn."</p>

<p>"And the girl?" asked Tarzan. "How about her?"</p>

<p>Herat looked a bit uncomfortable, shooting a quick glance at his
Queen, as he answered. "The girl shall not be harmed," he said,
"and if all the conditions be fulfilled, she shall have her
liberty. You shall remain as a guest of Thetan until your
companions have either succeeded or failed; then you may leave the
country. Decide among yourselves tonight which of the other two is
to fight the lion tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I shall kill the lion, myself," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But you have won your freedom!" exclaimed Queen Mentheb. "You
do not have to throw away your life."</p>

<p>"I shall kill the lion," reiterated Tarzan.</p>

<p>Herat looked questioningly at the Queen. "If he wishes to be
killed, he shall," he snapped.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20">CHAPTER 20</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE throne room of the temple of Brulor was vacant
except for the poor prisoners in their cages. "They have all gone,
and taken Helen," said d'Arnot. "What will they do with her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Brian, dejectedly. "One knows nothing
here. One just lives and suffers. If lucky, he may be chosen for
sacrifice, and die. Sometimes they choose one of us prisoners,
sometimes one of the handmaidens. It is a cruel and bloody
spectacle."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, a grotesque figure entered the throne
room through a doorway on the opposite side. It appeared to be a
man in a skin tight suit with a strange helmet covering his entire
head and an odd looking contraption strapped to his back between
his shoulders. He carried a trident on the end of which a large
fish wriggled. Water dripped from his helmet and his suit.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed d'Arnot. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"It is a ptome with our dinner," replied Brian. "The ptomes are
lesser priests and greater fishermen. They go out onto the bottom
of Lake Horus through watertight compartments and spear the fish
with which we are fed. That affair on his back furnishes oxygen
that it extracts from the water, which enters it in small
quantities. They say that with one of those helmets, a man could
live under water almost indefinitely, as far as his air supply was
concerned. You will notice the heavy metal soles of his shoes, that
prevent him from turning over and floating to the surface, feet
up."</p>

<p>"The whole thing is quite astonishing," commented d'Arnot, "and
so is that fish, for that matter. I never saw one like it
before."</p>

<p>"You will see plenty of them from now on," replied Brian, "and I
hope you like raw fish. If you don't, you'd better cultivate a
taste for it&mdash;it's about all you'll get to eat here; but
you'll be able to watch the priests and the handmaidens dine
sumptuously. They throw a banquet in here every once in a while
just to add to our misery."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Zytheb led Helen to one of the upper floors of the temple where
his apartments were situated. At the end of a corridor, he threw
open a door. "This is your new home," he said; "is it not
beautiful?"</p>

<p>The room was a jumble of strange appearing furniture, with odd
lamps and heavy vases. A frieze of skulls and bones encircled the
walls just below the ceiling. Through a window at the far end of
the room, the girl could see fishes swimming in the lake. She
entered, like one in a trance, and passed through the room to stand
beside a table at the window. A heavy vase of strange workmanship
stood on the table, and hazily she thought how interesting it might
be were her mind not in such a turmoil of hopelessness and terror.
Zytheb had followed her, and now he laid a hand upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You are very beautiful," he said.</p>

<p>She shrank away from him, backing against the table. "Don't
touch me!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "Remember what Brulor told you. You are my
wife, and you must obey me."</p>

<p>"I am not your wife. I shall never be. I should rather die. Keep
away from me, I tell you. Keep away!"</p>

<p>"You shall learn to obey and be a good wife&mdash;and like it,"
snapped Zytheb. "Come, now, and kiss me!"</p>

<p>He attempted to take her in his arms; and as he did so, she
seized the vase from the table and struck him heavily over the
head. Without a sound, he slumped to the floor; and she knew that
she had killed him. Her first reaction was solely of relief. She
had no regrets, but what was she to do now? What possibility of
escape was there from this frightful place beneath the waters of
Horus?</p>

<p>For a time she stood looking down at the dead body of the man
she had killed, fascinated by the very horror of it; then slowly
came the realization that she must do something. At least she could
gain time by hiding the body. She looked about the room for some
place where she might conceal it, shuddering at the thought of the
gruesome ordeal; but she steeled herself, and dragged the body to a
closet across the room. The body was heavy; but terror gave her
strength, and at last she succeeded in getting it into the closet.
Before she closed the door, she took the keys and his dagger. If
there was any avenue of escape, she might need the keys; and she
was sure that she would need the dagger.</p>

<p>Her first thought now was to find the throne room again and see
d'Arnot and her brother. If escape were possible, she could take
them with her. At least she might see them once more. Creeping
along deserted corridors, she found her way down the winding
stairways up which Zytheb had led her, as she searched for the
throne room where the cages were. In constant fear of discovery,
she came at last to a door she thought she recognized. But was this
the room? If it were, would she find priests or guards within? For
a moment she hesitated; then she opened the door. Yes, it was the
throne room; and, except for the prisoners in their cages, it was
vacant. So far fortune had favored her; and she had achieved the
impossible, but how much longer might she depend upon the fickle
goddess? As she crossed the room to d'Arnot's cage, she saw that
the prisoners were all asleep. This fact and the quietness of the
temple gave her new assurance, for if escape were possible it might
be best accomplished while the temple slept. That the Asharians
were confident that there could be no escape was suggested by the
fact that no guards watched the prisoners, an inference that was
not encouraging.</p>

<p>Helen leaned against the bars of d'Arnot's cage and whispered
his name. The few seconds it took to awaken him seemed an eternity
to the frightened girl, but at last he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Helen!" he exclaimed in astonishment. "What has happened? How
did you get here?"</p>

<p>"Quiet!" she cautioned. "Let me get you and Brian out of those
cages; then we can plan." She was trying different keys in the lock
of the cage door as she talked to him, and at last she found the
one that fitted.</p>

<p>As the door swung open he sprang out and took her in his arms.
"Darling!" he whispered. "You have risked your life for this; but
you shouldn't have, for what good will it do? There is no escape
from this place."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," she agreed, "but at least we can have these few
minutes together&mdash;they can never take those away from
us&mdash;and as far as risking my life is concerned will make no
difference. I have already forfeited it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have killed Zytheb," she replied, "and when they find his
body, I imagine they'll make short work of me;" then she told him
what had happened in the apartment above.</p>

<p>"How brave you are," he said. "You deserve life and freedom for
what you have undergone."</p>

<p>D'Arnot took the keys from her and unlocked Brian's cage, and as
the latter opened his eyes and saw Helen and d'Arnot standing
outside he thought that he was dreaming. He had to come out and
touch them before he could believe his eyes. Briefly they explained
what had happened.</p>

<p>"And now that we are out, what?" demanded d'Arnot. "There can be
no escape from this place."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," replied Brian. "The priests have a
secret passage that can be used if the windlass fails or if the
temple should be in danger of flooding."</p>

<p>"Little good that will do us," said d'Arnot, "unless you know
where the entrance to this secret passage is."</p>

<p>"I don't know, but there is one here who does. One of these
prisoners, the one in the cage next to mine, is a former priest. If
we liberate him, he might lead us out. I know he is anxious to
escape. I'll wake him."</p>

<p>"Let's liberate all the poor creatures," suggested Helen.</p>

<p>"We certainly shall," said Brian; then he awoke Herkuf, the
former priest, and explained what he had in mind, while d'Arnot
released the other prisoners, cautioning them to silence, as they
gathered around Brian and Herkuf.</p>

<p>"It will mean death by torture if we are caught," explained the
latter, "and a life of danger if we escape, for we shall have no
place to go in Tuen-Baka and must live in caves and hide for the
remainder of our lives."</p>

<p>"I shall have a place to go," said a Thobotian. "I can go back
to Thobos, and I can show the rest of you a secret foot trail out
of Tuen-Baka, that only we of Thobos know."</p>

<p>"Anything, even death," said Brian, "would be better than these
filthy cages and the treatment we receive here."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed the man from Thobos, "why do we stand here
talking? Will you lead us out, Herkuf?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the former priest; "come with me."</p>

<p>He led them along the corridor that ran beneath the lake to the
bottom of the elevator shaft. For a moment he fumbled at a great
slab of lava that formed a part of one of the walls of the corridor
beside the shaft. Presently it swung toward him, revealing the
mouth of an opening as dark as Erebus.</p>

<p>"You'll have to feel your way along this corridor," he said.
"There are many stairways, some of them winding; but there are no
pitfalls and no side corridors. I shall go slowly."</p>

<p>After all were inside the mouth of the corridor, Herkuf pulled
the slab back in place; then he took the lead; and the long, slow
climb commenced.</p>

<p>"It commences to look as though the impossible were about to be
achieved," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"And a few minutes ago it appeared so very impossible," replied
Helen.</p>

<p>"And we owe it all to you, darling."</p>

<p>"We owe it to Zytheb," she corrected, "or to Brulor for
selecting the Keeper of the Keys as my husband."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it was, we sure got a break at last," said
Brian, "and the Lord knows we had one coming to us."</p>

<p>It was still dark when the nine fugitives emerged into the open
air at the end of the secret passage.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Brian.</p>

<p>"We are on the hillside above Ashair," replied Herkuf, "and we
shall breathe pure air and know freedom for a few hours at
least."</p>

<p>"And which way do we go now?"</p>

<p>"We should head toward the upper end of the lake," said the
Thobotian. "It is there that the trail begins that leads out of
Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Herkuf, "come on! I know a canyon we can hide
in if we don't want to travel by day. We can just about reach it by
sunrise. As soon as they find we have escaped, they will search for
us; so the farther away we can get and the more secluded the hiding
place, the better off we shall be."</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21">CHAPTER 21</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN no dungeon had Magra been incarcerated, but in
well appointed apartments with slave women to attend her. She
wondered why she had been accorded these luxuries, until the door
opened and King Herat entered; then she guessed the reason for her
preferment. He wore an ingratiating smile and the self-satisfied
look of a cat that has cornered a canary.</p>

<p>"You are being well treated and well served?" asked Herat.</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Majesty," replied Magra.</p>

<p>"I am glad; I wish you to be happy. You are my guest, you know,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you. I hope you are treating my companions
as generously."</p>

<p>"Scarcely," he replied, "though I have been very fair and
lenient with them; but do you know why I am treating you so
well?"</p>

<p>"Because the Thobotians are a kindly people, I suppose," she
replied, "and their King a kindly king."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed Herat. "It is because you are beautiful, my
dear; and because you please me. Those who please a king may fare
very well indeed." He came toward her. "I shall see that you live
like a queen," he said, suddenly taking her into his arms.</p>

<p>"I shall not please you for long," she snapped, "nor will you
ever be pleased by anything again if you don't get out of here and
leave me alone," and as she spoke, she snatched his dagger from its
sheath and pressed the point of it against his side.</p>

<p>"You she-devil!" he cried, as he jumped away. "You'll pay for
this."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Magra, "but you shall, if you annoy me or
try to punish me."</p>

<p>"You dare threaten me, slave!"</p>

<p>"I certainly do," Magra assured him; "and it is no idle threat,
either."</p>

<p>"Huh!" sneered Herat. "What can you do, other than
threaten?"</p>

<p>"I can see that the Queen learns of this. My slaves have told me
that she has a high temper."</p>

<p>"You win," said Herat, "but let us be friends."</p>

<p>While King Herat visited Magra, Queen Mentheb lay on a couch in
one of her apartments while slave women enameled her toenails and
arranged her hair.</p>

<p>"That story is so old it smells," said the Queen, peevishly.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Majesty," said the woman who had just sought to
amuse Mentheb with a story; "but have you heard the one about the
farmer's wife?"</p>

<p>"About a hundred times," snapped the Queen. "Every time Herat
drinks too much wine he tells it. I am the only one who doesn't
have to laugh at it every time he tells it. That is one of the
advantages of being a queen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know one, Your Majesty," exclaimed another of the women.
"It seems there were two Romans&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" commanded Mentheb. "You all bore me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we could send for an entertainer to amuse Your
Majesty," suggested another.</p>

<p>Mentheb thought for a moment before she replied. "Now, there is
one whom it would amuse me to talk with," she said. "That man who
killed the Asharian in the arena. He is a man, indeed. Mesnek,
suppose you go fetch him!"</p>

<p>"But, Majesty, what of the King? Other men are not supposed to
come to these apartments. Suppose the King should come while he was
here?"</p>

<p>"Herat won't come here tonight," said the Queen. "He is gaming
with his nobles. He told me so, and that he would not be here
tonight. Go fetch this super-man, Mesnek, and hurry."</p>

<p>As Tarzan and Thetan talked in Thetan's apartments, a
dark-skinned slave entered. "Most noble Thetan," he said, "Her
Majesty, Queen Mentheb, commands the presence of him who slew the
Asharian in the arena."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Thetan.</p>

<p>"In Her Majesty's apartments."</p>

<p>"Wait outside the door to guide him to Her Majesty," Thetan
directed the slave; and when the fellow had gone, he turned to
Tarzan. "You'll have to go," he said, "but be very careful. Get
away as quickly as you can, and while you are there be as discreet
as you know how to be. Mentheb fancies that she is something of a
siren, and Herat is insanely jealous. I think he is more fearful of
being made a fool of than anything else."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Tarzan; "I shall be discreet."</p>

<p>As Tarzan was ushered into the presence of Mentheb, she greeted
him with a winning smile. "So you are the man who killed the famous
killer of men," she said. "That was very amusing. I do not know
when I have seen anything so amusing or so entertaining."</p>

<p>"It is amusing to see men die?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he was only an Asharian," said the Queen, with a
shrug. "What are you called?"</p>

<p>"Tarzan."</p>

<p>"'Tarzan'! It is a nice name; I like it. Come and sit down
beside me and tell me that you will not fight the lion. I wish you
to live and remain here."</p>

<p>"I shall fight the lion," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But the lion will kill you; and I do not wish you to die,
Tarzan." Her tone was almost a caress.</p>

<p>"The lion will not kill me," replied the ape-man. "If I kill
him, will you intercede with the King in behalf of my friends?"</p>

<p>"It would be useless," she said. "The law is the law, and Herat
is just. They will die anyway, but you must live and remain in
Thobos." Suddenly she started up. "Isis!" she cried. "Here comes
the King! Hide!"</p>

<p>Tarzan remained standing where he was with arms folded, making
no move to hide; and there the King found him when he entered the
apartment.</p>

<p>Herat's face clouded with an angry scowl as he saw the ape-man.
"What means this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I came in search of you, but found the Queen instead," replied
Tarzan; "and I was just asking her to intercede in behalf of my
friends."</p>

<p>"I think you lie," said Herat, "for, while I don't know you, I
know my queen. I think I shall let you fight two lions."</p>

<p>"Her Majesty is blameless," said the ape-man. "She was very
angry because I came."</p>

<p>"She looked more frightened at my sudden appearance than angry,"
observed Herat.</p>

<p>"You are most unfair to me, Herat," accused Mentheb. "And you
are also unfair to this man, who speaks the truth."</p>

<p>"How am I unfair to him?" demanded the King.</p>

<p>"Because you have already promised that it should be one lion,"
she explained.</p>

<p>"I can change my mind," grumbled the King; "and, anyway, I do
not see why you should be so concerned in the matter. You but
substantiate my suspicions, and cause me to recall the young
warrior whom I had to send to the arena last year. I had hoped that
you would permit me to forget him."</p>

<p>Mentheb subsided into a pout, and Herat ordered Tarzan back to
his quarters. "The lions have been starved," he said. "They will be
quite hungry tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You should not starve your fighting lions, Herat," said Tarzan.
"Starvation weakens them."</p>

<p>"They will still be able to give a good account of themselves,"
replied the King, "for starvation will make them more ravenous and
ferocious. Now, go!"</p>

<p>It was near noon the next day that two warriors came to conduct
Tarzan to the arena. Thetan had already gone to join the King and
Queen in the royal box, after having assured the condemned man of
his chagrin at the unfortunate outcome of the whole adventure into
Thobos.</p>

<p>As Tarzan walked to the center of the arena and stopped, Herat
turned to his Queen. "Your taste is excellent, Mentheb," he said;
"the man is indeed a magnificent specimen. It is too bad that he
must die."</p>

<p>"And I must compliment you on your good taste," replied the
Queen, "for the woman also is a splendid specimen. It is too bad
that she must die," and thus Herat learned that Mentheb had heard
about his visit to Magra. The King looked most uncomfortable, for
Mentheb had taken no pains to lower her voice; and the nobles about
them overheard; so he was very glad as he saw the two lions slink
into the arena.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw them, too. They were big lions, and he realized that
his visit to Mentheb might cost him his life. One lion he might
have conquered, but how could any man withstand the attack of two
such mighty beasts? He realized that this was not intended to be a
contest, but an execution; yet, as the lions approached, he showed
no fear. One lion came directly toward him, while the other stood
for a few moments looking about the arena; and when the latter
started to follow his companion he was quite some distance behind
him. It was this that suggested to Tarzan the only plan that he
thought might prove successful against them. Had they charged
simultaneously, he felt that there would have been no hope for
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the leading lion made a rush and reared above the
ape-man. Herat leaned forward, his lips parted, his eyes dilated.
Above all things he loved a good kill; he liked to see blood
spilled and bodies mauled. Mentheb stifled a scream.</p>

<p>Tarzan sprang to one side and leaped behind the lion; then he
seized it and swung it above his head, wheeling about again as the
second lion charged.</p>

<p>"What strength!" marvelled Thetan.</p>

<p>"I am almost sorry that I pitted him against two lions,"
exclaimed Herat. "He really deserved a better fate."</p>

<p>"What?" sneered Mentheb. "Three lions?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that," said Herat, irritably. "I mean that such a
man deserves better than death."</p>

<p>"Name of Isis!" exclaimed Thetan. "Look at him now!"</p>

<p>Tarzan had hurled the first lion into the face of the one that
was charging, and both were down on the stone flagging of the
arena.</p>

<p>"Incredible!" exclaimed Mentheb. "If he survives, the girl may
live."</p>

<p>"And if he survives, I swear that he shall have his freedom,"
cried Herat, "but I'm afraid there's no hope for him. They'll both
be at him in a moment."</p>

<p>In her excitement, Mentheb had risen and was leaning over the
parapet. "Look! They are fighting one another!"</p>

<p>It was as Tarzan had believed that it would be. One lion,
thinking that the other had attacked him, tore into his fellow; and
with hideous roars and growls, the two fell upon one another,
rending with powerful talons and giant fangs.</p>

<p>"The man has not only marvelous strength but great cunning,"
said Herat.</p>

<p>"He is superb," exclaimed the Queen.</p>

<p>As the two lions fought, they moved nearer and nearer to the
royal box, until its occupants had to lean far over the parapet to
watch them. Tarzan, too, had moved back; and was standing just
below the box. In her excitement, Mentheb lost her balance and
toppled over the parapet. At her frightened scream, the ape-man
looked up just in time to catch her in his arms as she dropped
toward him. Realizing the woman's danger in the event that one of
the lions dispatched the other or the two should cease fighting and
turn their savage attention upon their natural enemies, Tarzan
started toward the doorway through which he had entered the arena,
shouting to Herat to order it opened.</p>

<p>All was confusion and chaos in the royal box. Herat was shouting
commands and warriors were rushing down toward the entrance to the
arena, but they were to be too late. With a final shake of the dead
body of his weaker antagonist, the victorious lion turned with a
savage roar and charged after Tarzan and the Queen. There was no
time now in which to reach the doorway; and the ape-man, lowering
Mentheb to her feet, turned with drawn knife to meet the oncoming
carnivore. Growling, he crouched; and Mentheb felt her flesh turn
cold in horror.</p>

<p>"That lion will kill them both!" cried Herat&mdash;"he is a
devil."</p>

<p>"So is the man," said Thetan.</p>

<p>Mentheb stood paralyzed by the bestial ferocity of the scene;
and before the warriors had reached the doorway to rescue her, the
lion was upon Tarzan. Eluding the flailing talons, the ape-man
seized the black mane and swung to the beast's back, driving his
knife into the tawny side. Roaring horribly, the lion threw itself
about in an endeavor to dislodge the man-thing from its back; and
the growls of the ape-man mingled with those of the carnivore,
until Mentheb scarcely knew which one to fear the most.</p>

<p>At last the knife found the savage heart, the beast rolled over
upon its side, and with a final convulsive shudder, died; then
Tarzan placed a foot upon the body of his kill and, raising his
face to the sky, voiced the weird victory cry of the bull ape; and
Mentheb, the Queen, stood in helpless fascination as her warrior
nobles rushed to her rescue.</p>

<p>"He is a demon," exclaimed Herat, "&mdash;or a god!"</p>

<p>Mentheb commanded Tarzan to accompany her before Herat. She was
still too shaken to do more than thank him feebly; and when she
reached the box, she sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"You have saved my Queen," said the King, "and thus won your
freedom doubly. You may remain in Thobos or you may go, as you
wish."</p>

<p>"There is still another condition to be fulfilled," Tarzan
reminded the King.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Herat.</p>

<p>"I must go to Ashair and bring you Brulor and his casket,"
replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You have done enough," said Herat; "let your friends do
that."</p>

<p>"No," replied Tarzan. "I shall have to go. Neither of the others
could accomplish anything. Perhaps I cannot; but I shall have a
better chance, and Gregory's daughter and my best friend are
there."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented Herat, "but we'll give you any assistance
you wish. It's a task that one man cannot accomplish alone."</p>

<p>"Nor a hundred," said Mentheb. "We should know, who have tried
it so often."</p>

<p>"I shall go alone," said Tarzan. "If I need help, I'll come back
for it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22">CHAPTER 22</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">SELF-SATISFIED, contented, Atan Thome lounged at
his ease in an apartment in the palace of Queen Atka at Ashair,
while Lal Taask paced the floor nervously.</p>

<p>"I do not like it," grumbled the latter. "We shall all die for
it."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly safe," Atan Thome assured him. "Everything is
arranged, and when it is over we shall be safe, favorites of the
ruler of Ashair&mdash;and that much nearer The Father of
Diamonds."</p>

<p>"I have a presentiment," said Lal Taask, "that we shall not be
safe."</p>

<p>"Put your trust in Akamen," urged Thome. "He will lead you to
the Queen's bedroom; then you will know what to do."</p>

<p>"Why not you?" demanded Lal Taask. "It is you who wants The
Father of Diamonds so badly, not I."</p>

<p>"I do not do it, because you are more experienced with a
dagger," replied Thome, smiling. "Come! Have you lost your
nerve?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to do it," said Lal Taask, emphatically.</p>

<p>"You will do as I command!" snapped Thome.</p>

<p>Lal Taask's eyes fell before those of his master. "Just this
once," he said. "Promise that you will not ask such a thing of me
again."</p>

<p>"I promise that after tonight I shall ask nothing more of you,"
agreed Thome. "S-s-h! Some one is coming!"</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, the door opened and Akamen entered the
room. He was pale and nervous. He looked at Atan Thome
questioningly. The latter nodded.</p>

<p>"It is all understood," he said. "Lal Taask will do his
duty."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Akamen. "I have arranged everything. The Queen
has retired. There are no guards before her door. It will be over
in five minutes. Suspicion will be directed against the noble in
command of the guard. The Queen disciplined him severely a short
time ago, and it is known that he was very bitter. Come with me,
Lal Taask."</p>

<p>Akamen led the way through silent corridors to the Queen's
bedroom. Without noise, he opened the door; and as the assassin,
dagger in hand, slunk stealthily toward his victim, Akamen,
flattened against the wall of the corridor, awaited the blow that
would make him King of Ashair. Seconds seemed as hours to him as he
waited for Lal Taask to reach the side of the Queen's bed and
strike.</p>

<p>He was almost there! The dagger hand was rising! And then there
was sudden commotion in the room as warriors leaped from behind
hangings and fell upon the would-be assassin and his accomplice;
and Queen Atka sat up in bed, a bitter smile of triumph on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Summon my nobles to the throne room," she directed, "and take
these two and the man Thome there, also, that justice may be
done."</p>

<p>When a warrior came to Atan Thome's apartments and summoned him
to the throne room in the Queen's name, the Eurasian could scarcely
restrain an expression of exultation, though he simulated surprise
that Atka should wish to see him at so late an hour.</p>

<p>"Akamen," said the Queen, as the three men were lined up before
the throne, "you conspired with these two strangers to assassinate
me, that you might be king. One of your accomplices, hoping to
curry favor with me, informed upon you. To my mind, he is even more
vile than you, if that be possible; and his punishment shall be the
same as yours. I sentence all three of you to the cages of the
temple for life&mdash;a far greater punishment than a quick and
merciful death. As added punishment, you shall all be half starved
all of the time and tortured periodically, at each full moon. At
the first, you shall each have one eye burned out; at the next,
another; after that, you shall lose, first your right hands; then
your left hands; your feet shall follow, one by one; and after that
I am sure that I can devise other means whereby you may be reminded
that treachery is a dangerous avocation." She turned to one of her
nobles. "Take them away!"</p>

<p>Atan Thome, Lal Taask, and Akamen in adjoining cages were the
only prisoners now in the Temple of Brulor, Father of Diamonds. Lal
Taask and Akamen glared at Atan Thome, cursing him; but he seemed
oblivious to everything except the casket on the altar before the
throne.</p>

<p>"Lowest of the low!" growled Akamen. "You betrayed us. But for
you, I should be King of Ashair."</p>

<p>"There is The Father of Diamonds!" whispered Atan Thome.</p>

<p>"Dog!" cried Taask. "For years I have served you faithfully, and
now you have sacrificed me!"</p>

<p>"There lies The Father of Diamonds," droned Thome. "For that, I
would betray my mother or my god."</p>

<p>A ptome approached, bearing a wriggling fish upon a trident.
"Here is your dinner, damned ones!" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is not cooked!" exclaimed Atan Thome. "Take it away!"</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll take it away," said the ptome; "but then you'll go
hungry. We do not cook the fish for such as you."</p>

<p>"Give me the fish!" screamed Lal Taask; "and let him starve, but
not too much&mdash;he must be saved for my dagger."</p>

<p>"It is I who should have the right to kill him," growled
Akamen&mdash;"he who kept me from being a king."</p>

<p>"You are both fools," cried Atan Thome. "Nothing matters but The
Father of Diamonds. Help me get that, and I shall make us all rich.
Think, Taask, what it would buy in the capitals of Europe! I would
give my soul for it."</p>

<p>"You have no soul, you beast!" screamed Taask. "Only let me get
my dagger into you!"</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Tarzan and Thetan came with a warrior to the cell where Gregory
and Lavac were chained. "Herat has reprieved you," explained
Tarzan, while the warrior removed their chains. "You are to have
freedom within the city until I return from Ashair."</p>

<p>"Why are you going to Ashair?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"I want to find out if your daughter and d'Arnot are there, and
ascertain if there is any way in which they may be rescued, if they
are there; then there is the matter of Brulor and The Father of
Diamonds. To win freedom for all of us, they must be brought to
Herat."</p>

<p>"The other conditions have been fulfilled?" asked Lavac. "You
have killed the lions?"</p>

<p>"They are both dead," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Ashair with you." said Lavac.</p>

<p>"And I," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"It is better that I go alone," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But I must go," insisted Lavac. "I must do something to atone
for my beastliness to d'Arnot. Please let me go with you."</p>

<p>"I must go, too," insisted Gregory.</p>

<p>"I can take one of you," replied Tarzan. "Herat insists that one
of us remain here as a hostage. You may come, Lavac."</p>

<p>The morning was still young as Thetan bid Tarzan and Lavac
farewell as they were setting out for Ashair. "I have told you all
that I know of Ashair and the Temple of Brulor at the bottom of
Lake Horus," said the Thobotian. "May the gods be with you!"</p>

<p>"I need no gods," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Tarzan is enough," added Lavac.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>All night the nine fugitives had tramped from their last hiding
place, and they were footsore and weary. There had been no
indication of pursuit, but Herkuf knew his own people well enough
to know that they would not be allowed to escape so easily.</p>

<p>"Now that it is light," he said, "it is time that we found
another hiding place."</p>

<p>"We are only a few hours from Thobos," said the Thobotian, "and
before that I can show you the trail out of Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I think it better that we hide through the day,"
insisted Herkuf. "I have no wish to be caught and taken back to the
cages."</p>

<p>"What is another day, if by hiding we can escape?" asked
Brian.</p>

<p>"I think Herkuf is right," said d'Arnot. "We should not take a
single risk, however small it may seem."</p>

<p>"Listen!" whispered Helen. "I hear voices. Some one is coming
behind us."</p>

<p>"It can be no one but the Asharians who are looking for us,"
said Herkuf. "Quick! We'll turn off the trail here, and hide. Make
no noise&mdash;just follow me. I know this place."</p>

<p>They moved silently along a narrow trail for a quarter of a
mile, coming at last to a little clearing. "This is the place,"
said Herkuf. "I do not think they will look here for us. They will
think that we kept on straight up the valley."</p>

<p>"I don't hear them any more," said Helen.</p>

<p>"The trouble with this," said d'Arnot, "is that now they'll be
between us and where we want to go."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Herkuf. "They won't dare go too near
Thobos; so, if they don't find us, they'll have to turn around and
come back. They'll pass us again later in the day, and tonight we
can go on in safety."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right," said Brian.</p>

<p>Six Asharian warriors, following the trail of the fugitives,
came to the place at which they had turned off. "Their tracks are
plain here," said the leader. "Here's where they turned off the
main trail, and not so long ago. We should soon have
them&mdash;remember to take the woman and the strange men
alive."</p>

<p>Half crouching, the six crept along the trail of their
quarry&mdash;a trail as plain as a board walk. They did not speak
now, for they felt that the fugitives were not far ahead; but moved
with the utmost quiet and stealth. Each was thinking of what Atka
would do to them if they failed.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As Tarzan and Lavac followed a forest trail toward Ashair, the
ape-man suddenly stopped and tested the air with his keen nostrils.
"There are men ahead," he said. "You stay here; I'll take to the
trees and investigate."</p>

<p>"They must be men from Ashair," said Lavac, and Tarzan nodded
and was off into the trees.</p>

<p>Lavac watched him until he disappeared among the foliage,
marvelling at his strength and agility. Though he had seen him take
to the trees many times, it never ceased to thrill him; but when
Tarzan was gone, he felt strangely alone and helpless.</p>

<p>As the ape-man swung through the trees, the scent spoor became
plainer; and among that of many men he detected the delicate aroma
of a white woman. It was faintly familiar but still too tenuous to
identify&mdash;just a suggestion of familiarity, but it spurred him
to greater speed; and while he swung silently through the lower
terrace of the forest, the six Asharian warriors broke into the
clearing upon the fugitives with shouts of triumph. Some of the
nine started to run, bringing a shower of spears upon them; but
d'Arnot, Helen, Brian, and Herkuf stood still, knowing that there
could be no escape now. A spear drove through one of the fleeing
men; and, as he fell, screaming, the others gave up hope and
stopped.</p>

<p>Tarzan heard the shouts of the Asharians as they broke into the
clearing and the scream of him who had received the spear. The
sounds were close, now. In another moment he would be on the
scene.</p>

<p>The Asharians, having recovered their spears, rounded up the
fugitives and commenced to belabor them with the hafts of their
weapons. They struck indiscriminately, venting their hatred on all;
but when one of them threatened Helen, d'Arnot knocked him down;
and instantly another raised his spear to drive it through the
Frenchman's back. It was this scene upon which Tarzan looked as he
reached the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p class="caption">D'Arnot knocked him down.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>As Helen screamed in horror and warning, an arrow pierced the
warrior's heart; and, shrieking, he fell dead. Instantly the other
Asharians looked about, but they saw no one who could have sped the
missile. They knew that it could not have come from any of the
unarmed prisoners, and they were frightened and mystified. Only
d'Arnot could even hazard a guess as to the identity of the
bowman.</p>

<p>"It seems incredible," he whispered to Helen, "but who in the
world but Tarzan could have shot that arrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if it only were!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>None knew better than Tarzan of the Apes how to harass and
mystify an enemy. He had seen the surprise that the mysterious
messenger of death had caused in the clearing below. A grim
half-smile touched his lips as he drew his bow again and selected
another victim; then he sped the arrow.</p>

<p>Once again the mysterious killer had struck, and as another
Asharian screamed and fell the others looked about in
consternation.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" cried one. "I see nobody."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded another. "Why doesn't he show
himself?"</p>

<p>"It is the god of us outside people," said d'Arnot. "He will
kill you all."</p>

<p>"If he doesn't kill us, Atka will," said a warrior, "if we don't
bring you back to Ashair;" then the four remaining warriors sought
to herd their prisoners onto the back trail toward the city.</p>

<p>"Let's make a break for it," suggested Brian. "They're confused
and frightened."</p>

<p>"No," counselled d'Arnot; "they'd get some of us with their
spears. We can't take the chance now."</p>

<p>Suddenly there burst upon the surprised ears of the Asharians a
deep voice that spoke the Swahili they all understood. "I am Tarzan
of the Apes," it boomed. "Go, and leave my friends!"</p>

<p>"We might as well die here as in Ashair," a warrior shouted
back, "for the Queen will have us killed if we come back empty
handed; so we are going to take our prisoners with us, or kill them
here."</p>

<p>"Kill them now!" cried another, and turned upon Brian, who was
closest to him; but as he raised his spear an arrow passed through
his heart; and then, with the rapidity of machine gun fire, three
more arrows brought down the remaining Asharians, while the
surviving fugitives looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>"There is only one man in the world who could have done that,"
said d'Arnot, "and we are very fortunate that he is our
friend."</p>

<p>As Tarzan dropped to the ground among them, they surrounded him,
voicing their thanks; but he silenced them with a gesture. "What
are your plans?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is a Thobotian with us who is going to show us a secret
trail out of Tuen-Baka," explained d'Arnot. "We didn't know that
anyone but us was left alive."</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Dad?" interrupted Helen. "Was he
drowned?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Tarzan; "he and Magra are in Thobos and safe for
the moment. Lavac is back there on the trail waiting for me. He and
I were on our way to Ashair to look for you."</p>

<p>"Then we can all turn back to Thobos," said Brian.</p>

<p>"It is not as simple as that," replied Tarzan. "I shall have to
go to Ashair and bring back a god and a diamond to Herat before he
will release your father and Magra."</p>

<p>"It looks like a man-size job," commented d'Arnot, with a rueful
smile. "I shall go with you."</p>

<p>"And I," said Helen.</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "You'd be little better off in Thobos," he
said, "and I doubt very much that you could ever make it back to
Bonga if you succeeded in getting out of Tuen-Baka alive."</p>

<p>"I think we should all stick together," said Brian. "I'm going
along with you."</p>

<p>"My duty lies near Ashair," said Herkuf. "I shall go with you.
Perhaps, of all of us, I can be of the most help in getting what
you want."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed the ape-man. "I'll go back and bring
Lavac."</p>

<p>A half hour later the little party was on its way back to
Ashair, the Forbidden City of Tuen-Baka.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23">CHAPTER 23</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Magra sat in her apartment in the palace of
Herat musing over the strange series of adventures that had brought
her to this half-civilized, half-barbaric city, and dreaming of the
godlike man she had come to love, the door opened; and the King
entered.</p>

<p>Magra rose and faced him. "You should not come here," she said.
"It will do you no good and only endanger my life. The Queen knew
of the other time. She will know of this, and she will have me
killed."</p>

<p>"Have no fear," said Herat, "for I am king."</p>

<p>"You only think you are," snapped Magra contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I am Herat, the King!" cried the monarch. "No one speaks to me
like that, woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, they don't, don't they?" demanded an angry voice behind
him; and, turning, he saw the Queen standing in the doorway. "So I
have caught you at last!" she cried. "So no one speaks to you like
that, eh? You haven't heard anything yet; wait 'til I get you
alone!" She turned her blazing eyes on Magra. "And as for you,
trollop; you die tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear," expostulated Herat.</p>

<p>"'But' me nothing!" snapped Mentheb. "Get out of here!"</p>

<p>"I thought that you said you were king," taunted Magra; then
they were both gone, and the girl was left alone. Never in her life
had she felt so much alone, so helpless and so hopeless. She threw
herself upon a couch; and, had she been another woman, she would
have burst into tears; but Magra had never cried for herself.
Self-pity was not for her. She had said once that it was like
cheating at solitaire, for nobody else knew about it and nobody
cared and no one was hurt but herself. How she wished that Tarzan
were here! He would have helped her&mdash;not with useless
commiseration, but with action. He would have found a way to save
her. She wondered if he would grieve for her; and then she smiled,
for she knew that the philosophy of the wild beast had little place
for grief. It was too accustomed to death, held life in such low
esteem. But she must do something. She struck a gong that summoned
a slave girl.</p>

<p>"Do you know where the prisoners, Gregory and Lavac, are
quartered?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, my mistress."</p>

<p>"Take me to them!"</p>

<p>When she entered Gregory's apartment, she found Thetan with him.
At first she hesitated to talk before the Thobotian, but she
recalled that he had befriended them; so she told them all that had
just happened.</p>

<p>"I must escape tonight," she said. "Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"Mentheb is rather a decent sort," said Thetan. "She may come to
realize that the fault is not yours, and of course she knows that
it is not, and alter her decision to have you killed; but it would
be dangerous to depend on that. I know you are guiltless, and I
know that you are a friend of Tarzan; so I am going to help you to
escape."</p>

<p>"Will you help me to go with her?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Thetan. "I got you into this, and I should get you
out of it. I shall help you because you are Tarzan's friends, and
Tarzan saved my life. But never return to Thobos, for if you escape
her now, Mentheb will never forget. Follow the trail on the west
side of the lake south; it will bring you to Ashair and probably to
death there&mdash;it is the law of Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>A half hour later Thetan led Magra and Gregory to a small gate
in the city wall and wished them luck as they went out into the
night and set their faces toward The Forbidden City.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"Well," said d'Arnot, "here we are right back where we started
from," as the party of six reached the entrance to the secret
passage to the Temple of Brulor on the rocky hillside above
Ashair.</p>

<p>"I spent two years trying to get out of that hole," said Brian,
"and now here I am trying to get back in again. That Herat
certainly gave you a tough job, Tarzan."</p>

<p>"It was merely the old boy's way of condemning us all to death,"
said Lavac, "&mdash;an example of Thobotian humor. At least it was
at first; but after Tarzan disposed of the bad man from Ashair and
the two lions, I really believe that Herat came to the conclusion
that he might actually bring back Brulor and The Father of
Diamonds."</p>

<p>"Why does he want them so badly?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"The Father of Diamonds belongs in Thobos," explained Herkuf,
"where the temple of the true god, Chon, is located. It was stolen
by Atka's warriors years ago when they attacked and sank Chon's
galley in which it was being carried during a solemn religious
rite. Brulor is a false god. Herat wishes to destroy him."</p>

<p>"Do you think that there is any possibility that we may be able
to recover The Father of Diamonds and kidnap Brulor?" asked
d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Herkuf, "I do. We have the temple keys that Helen
took from Zytheb; and I know where Brulor sleeps and the hours of
the day that are supposedly set apart for meditation; but which, in
reality, Brulor devotes to sleeping off the effects of the strong
drink to which he is addicted. During these periods the throne room
is deserted, and all the inmates of the temple are compelled to
remain in their own quarters. We can go directly to the throne room
and get the casket, and then to Brulor's room. If we threaten him
with death, he will come with us without making any outcry."</p>

<p>"It all sounds very easy," said Brian, "&mdash;almost too
easy."</p>

<p>"I shall keep my fingers crossed all the time," said Helen.</p>

<p>"When can we make the attempt?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>Herkuf looked up at the sun. "Now," he said, "would be a good
time."</p>

<p>"Well, how about getting started, Tarzan?" asked Brian.</p>

<p>"Herkuf and I shall go in," said the ape-man. "The rest of you
hide near here and wait for us. If we are not out within an hour,
you will know that we have failed; then you must try to save
yourselves. Find the trail over the rim. It lies somewhere near
Thobos. Get out of Tuen-Baka. It will be useless for you to try to
do anything for Herkuf or me or to rescue Magra and Gregory."</p>

<p>"Am I not to go in with you, Tarzan?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"No. Too many of us might result in confusion and discovery;
and, anyway, your place is with Helen. Come, Herkuf, let's get
started."</p>

<p>As the two entered the secret passage, a sentinel priest who had
been crouching behind a boulder watching the party, turned and ran
as fast as he could toward the nearest city gate; while, miles
away, the objects of all this now useless risk and sacrifice
trudged doggedly along the trail to Ashair in an effort to avert
it.</p>

<p>Ignorant of anything that had transpired in Ashair, not knowing
that his son and daughter lived and were free, Gregory accompanied
Magra rather hopelessly, his only inspiration loyalty to Tarzan and
Lavac, whom he knew to be risking their lives in an effort to save
his and Magra's. Magra was inspired by this same loyalty and by
love&mdash;a love that had done much to change and ennoble her.</p>

<p>"It all seems so utterly hopeless," said Gregory. "Only four of
us left, pitting our puny efforts against two cities filled with
enemies. If one of them doesn't get us, the other will."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," agreed Magra. "Even the forces of
nature are against us. Look up at that towering escarpment of lava,
always frowning down upon us, threatening, challenging; and yet how
different it would all seem if Tarzan were with us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Gregory. "He inspires confidence. Even the
walls of Tuen-Baka would seem less insurmountable if he were here.
I think he has spoiled us all. We have come to depend upon him to
such an extent that we are really quite helpless without him."</p>

<p>"And he is going to almost certain death for us," said Magra.
"Thetan told me that it would be impossible for him to escape alive
from Ashair, if he succeeded in getting in; and, knowing Tarzan, we
know that he will get in. Oh, if we could only reach him before he
does!"</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Gregory. "Here come some men!"</p>

<p>"They have seen us," said Magra. "We can't escape them."</p>

<p>"They look very old and weak," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"But they carry spears."</p>

<p>The three surviving fugitives from the cages of the Temple of
Brulor who had chosen to go on in search of freedom rather than
return to Ashair with Tarzan's party halted in the trail.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" they demanded.</p>

<p>"Strangers looking for a way out of Tuen-Baka," replied
Gregory.</p>

<p>The three whispered among themselves for a moment; then one of
them said, "We, too, are looking for a way out of Tuen-Baka.
Perhaps we should go together, for in numbers there is
strength."</p>

<p>"We can't go until we find our friends," replied Magra. "They
were on their way to Ashair."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we saw them. Was one of them called Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Have you seen him?" demanded Gregory.</p>

<p>"We saw him yesterday. He and his friends went back to
Ashair."</p>

<p>"His friends? There was but one with him," said Magra.</p>

<p>"There were five with him. Four men and a girl went back to
Ashair with him."</p>

<p>"Whom could they have been, do you suppose?" Gregory asked
Magra.</p>

<p>"Do you know who they were?" she inquired of the fugitive who
had been acting as spokesman.</p>

<p>"Yes. One was called Herkuf, and one Lavac, and there was
d'Arnot, and Brian Gregory was with him and a girl called
Helen."</p>

<p>Gregory turned very pale. Magra caught his arm, for she thought
he was going to fall. "I'm stunned," he said "I can't believe that
they're all alive. It's just like having people come back from the
grave&mdash;I was so sure that they were dead. Think of it, Magra!
My son and my daughter both alive&mdash;and on their way back to
that terrible city. We must hurry on. Maybe we can overtake them.

<p>"Tell us," he said to the fugitive, "where we may find them if they
have not already been captured by the Asharians."</p>

<p>The man gave them explicit directions for locating the hidden
entrance to the secret passage to the temple. "That is where you
will find them," he said, "if they have not already entered the
city; but do not enter. As you value your lives, do not enter the
passage. If they have done so, they are lost. You might as well
give them up, for you will never see them again."</p>

<p>"They weren't very encouraging," said Magra, as she and Gregory
continued on their way; "but perhaps they overestimate the
dangers&mdash;let's hope so."</p>

<p>Gregory shook his head. "I'm afraid they didn't," he said. "I
doubt if the dangers that lurk in The Forbidden City of Ashair can
be overestimated."</p>

<p>"It is a strange place, this Tuen-Baka," said Magra. "No wonder
that it is taboo."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24">CHAPTER 24</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN and Herkuf followed the dark passageway and
the winding stairs down to the lava slab that closed the secret
doorway leading to the corridor they must follow beneath the lake
to reach the temple.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said Herkuf. "If the gods are with us, we shall
soon be in Brulor's room behind the throne. I'll attend to him, you
get the casket. I have waited years for such an opportunity to
avenge Chon, the true god, and make Brulor pay for the indignities
and torture he imposed upon me. I see now how I have lived through
all that I have lived through. It was for this hour. If we fail, it
will mean death; but if we fail I shall welcome death."</p>

<p>Beyond the lava slab a group of Asharian warriors, their short
spears ready, awaited them, for the sentinel priest had done his
duty well.</p>

<p>"They must be close," said the leader of the warriors. "Be
ready! but do not forget that it is the Queen's command that we
take them alive for torture before death."</p>

<p>"I should hate to be Herkuf when Brulor gets him back in his
cage," said a warrior.</p>

<p>"And that wild man," said another. "It was he who killed so many
of our warriors that night in the tunnel. I should hate to be the
wild man when Atka gets him."</p>

<p>The lava slab was thick, and it was skillfully fitted in the
aperture; so the voices of the whispering warriors did not reach
the ears of the two upon the other side of it. Ignorant of the trap
into which they were walking, they paused for a moment while Herkuf
groped for the knob which would open the door.</p>

<p>And while they paused upon the brink of disaster, another detail
of warriors crept up upon the unsuspecting four who were waiting at
the entrance to the secret passageway, ignorant of the imminent
peril that hovered just above them among the boulders of the
hillside.</p>

<p>"At last, darling," said d'Arnot, "I can see a ray of hope.
Herkuf knows the customs of the temple, and before the inmates
leave their apartments again he and Tarzan will be back with Brulor
and the accursed Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>"I have grown to hate the very name of the thing," said the
girl. "There surely must be a curse upon it and everything
connected with it. I feel that so strongly that I can't believe it
possible that it is going to be the means of releasing Dad and
Magra. Something will happen to turn success into failure."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you're pessimistic and skeptical, but this time
I'm sure you're wrong."</p>

<p>"I certainly hope so. I don't know when I've ever so wanted to
be wrong."</p>

<p>Lavac and Brian were sitting on the ground a few paces from
Helen and d'Arnot, the former with his back toward them that he
might not see the little intimacies that still hurt him so sorely
notwithstanding his honest intention to give up all hope of winning
the girl. He was facing up the slope of the rocky hillside above
which towered the stupendous rampart of Tuen-Baka, and so it was he
who first saw the Asharian warriors as they broke cover and started
down toward their quarry. As he leaped to his feet with a cry of
warning, the others turned; and in the instant their hopes came
rumbling about their heads like a house of match wood. The
Asharians were yelling triumphantly now, as they charged down the
hill, brandishing their short spears. The three men might have put
up a battle even against these terrific odds, futile as it would
have been, had they not feared for the safety of the girl should
they invite the Asharians to hurl their spears; so they stood in
silence while the warriors surrounded them, and a moment later they
were being herded down toward the nearest city gate.</p>

<p>"You were right, after all," said d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, dejectedly; "the curse of the diamond is
still on us. Oh, Paul, I'd rather die than go back to that awful
place! This time there will be no hope for us, and what I dread
most is that they will not kill me."</p>

<p>As the four prisoners were being marched down to the city,
Herkuf pulled the lava slab toward him; and the two men stepped
into the trap that had been laid for them. They hadn't a chance,
not even the mighty ape-man, for the Asharians had planned well. As
they stepped from the mouth of the passageway, two warriors,
crouching low, seized them around their ankles and tripped them;
and, as they fell, a dozen others swarmed upon them, slipping
nooses about their ankles and wrists.</p>

<p>"You knew we were coming?" Herkuf asked one of the warriors, as
they were being led along the corridor toward the temple.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the man. "A sentry has been watching above
the city, for Atka thought that you might come back to Ashair to
steal a galley. It was the only way that the strangers could escape
from Tuen-Baka. It would have been better had you stayed in your
cage, Herkuf, for now Brulor will have you tortured; and you know
what that means."</p>

<p>The throne room of the temple was silent and vacant, except for
the three prisoners in the cages, as Tarzan and Herkuf were led in,
for it was still the period of meditation, during which the inmates
of the temple were compelled to remain in their quarters; and so
there was a delay while a warrior sought permission from Brulor to
summon the Keeper of the Keys that the cages might be unlocked to
receive the new prisoners.</p>

<p>Presently, Herkuf touched Tarzan on the arm. "Look!" he said.
"The others have been taken, also."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to see Helen, d'Arnot, Brian, and Lavac being
herded into the chamber; and greeted them with one of his rare
smiles. Even in the face of death he could see the humor of the
situation, that they who had come so confidently to conquer should
have been so ignominiously conquered themselves without the
striking of a blow. D'Arnot saw the smile and returned it.</p>

<p>"We meet again, mon ami," he said; "but not where we expected to
meet."</p>

<p>"And for the last time," added Lavac. "There will be no more
meetings after this one for any of us, at least not in this life.
As for me, I shall be glad. I have nothing to live for." He did not
look at Helen, but they all knew what he meant.</p>

<p>"And you all die because of me," said Brian, "because of my
stupid avarice; and I shall die without being able to atone."</p>

<p>"Let's not talk about it," urged Helen. "It's bad enough as it is
without constantly reminding ourselves of it."</p>

<p>"When one is about to die by slow torture, one does not have to
be reminded of it," said Herkuf. "It occupies one's mind to the
exclusion of all else. Sometimes it is a relief to talk of it."</p>

<p>Atan Thome looked out between the bars of his cage at the six
prisoners. "So we are reunited at last!" he cackled, "we who sought
The Father of Diamonds. There it is, in that casket there; but do
not touch it&mdash;it is mine. It is for me alone;" then he broke
into loud, maniacal laughter.</p>

<p>"Silence! you crazy pig," growled Lal Taask.</p>

<p>It was then that the Keeper of the Keys came and opened the
cages. "Into their dens with them," snapped an officer, "all but
this fellow here." He nodded at Tarzan. "The Queen wants to see
him."</p>

<p>Atka sat upon her lava throne surrounded by her white plumed
nobles, as the Lord of the Jungle, his hands still bound behind
him, was brought before her. For a long time she sat studying him
with half-closed, appraising eyes; and with neither deference nor
boldness Tarzan returned her scrutiny, much as a captive lion might
regard a spectator outside his cage.</p>

<p>"So you are the man who killed so many of my warriors," she said
at last, "and captured one of my galleys."</p>

<p>Tarzan stood silent before her. Finally she tapped her toe upon
the floor of the dais, "Why do you not reply?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"You asked me nothing," he said. "You simply told me something I
already knew."</p>

<p>"When Atka speaks, the person who is thus honored makes some
reply."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "I do not like useless talk," he said; "but if
you like to hear it, I admit that I killed some of your warriors. I
should have killed more that night on the river had there been more
in the galley. Yesterday, I killed six in the forest."</p>

<p>"So that is why they did not return!" exclaimed Atka.</p>

<p>"I think that must be the reason," Tarzan admitted.</p>

<p>"Why did you come to Ashair?" the Queen demanded.</p>

<p>"To free my friends who were prisoners here."</p>

<p>"Why are you my enemy?" asked Atka.</p>

<p>"I am not your enemy. I wish only the freedom of my friends,"
the ape-man assured her.</p>

<p>"And The Father of Diamonds," added Atka.</p>

<p>"I care nothing for that," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But you are an accomplice of Atan Thome," she accused, "and he
came to steal The Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>"He is my enemy," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>She looked at him again for some time in silence, apparently
playing with a new idea. At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "that you are not the type that lies. I
believe what you have told me, and so I would befriend you. They
have told me how you fought with your ape allies at the camp below
the tunnel and also of the fight in the galley, for all of the
warriors did not drown: two of them swam out of the tunnel to
safety. Such a man as you would be valuable to me, if loyal. Swear
loyalty to me, and you shall be free."</p>

<p>"And my friends?" asked Tarzan. "They will be freed too?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. They are no good to me. Why should I free them?
The man, Brian Gregory, came here solely for the purpose of
stealing The Father of Diamonds. I think the others came to help
him. No, they shall die in good time."</p>

<p>"I told you that I came here to free them," said Tarzan. "The
granting of their freedom is the only condition under which I will
remain."</p>

<p>"Slaves do not impose conditions upon Atka," snapped the Queen,
imperiously. She turned to a noble. "Take him away!"</p>

<p>They returned Tarzan to the throne room of the temple then, but
they did not free his hands until they had him locked safely in a
cage. It was evident that the fighting men of Ashair held him in
deep respect.</p>

<p>"What luck?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I am here in a cage," replied Tarzan. "That is answer enough.
The Queen wishes us all dead."</p>

<p>"I imagine her wish will come true," said d'Arnot ruefully.</p>

<p>"Queens have but to wish."</p>

<p>It was a dejected and disheartened company that awaited the next
eventuality of their disastrous adventure. There were only two of
them who appeared to be not entirely without hope&mdash;the
ape-man, whose countenance seldom revealed his inward feelings, and
Atan Thome, who continually cackled and prated of The Father of
Diamonds.</p>

<p>When life began to stir in the throne room with the ending of
the period of meditation, priests and handmaidens appeared; and
finally Brulor entered and took his place upon the throne, while
all knelt and beat their heads upon the floor. After a brief
religious ceremony, some of the handmaidens commenced to dance
before Brulor, a suggestive, lascivious dance in which some of the
priests soon joined, in the midst of which a plumed warrior entered
from the long corridor and announced the coming of the Queen.
Instantly the music and the dancing stopped, and the dancers took
their places in sanctimonious attitudes about the throne of Brulor.
A loud fanfare of trumpets billowed from the mouth of the corridor,
and a moment later the head of a procession appeared and marched
down the center of the room toward the dais where Brulor sat.
Surrounded by warriors, the Queen moved majestically to the dais,
where she took her place in a second throne chair that stood beside
Brulor's.</p>

<p>A long and tedious ceremony ensued, after which the Queen
pronounced sentence upon the new prisoners, a privilege she
occasionally usurped to the chagrin of Brulor, who was a god only
on sufferance of the Queen.</p>

<p>"Let all but the woman," ordered Atka, "be offered in sacrifice,
each in his turn, and with slow torture, that their spirits may go
out into the world of barbarians to warn others never to seek entry
to The Forbidden City of Ashair."</p>

<p>She spoke in a loud voice that could be heard throughout the
chamber; and her words brought a ray of hope to d'Arnot, for Helen
had not been sentenced to torture and death, but his hopes were
dashed by the Queen's next words.</p>

<p>"The woman shall be taken to the little chamber to die slowly as
a sacrifice to Holy Horus. This shall be her punishment for the
killing of Zytheb, the priest. Let her be taken away at once. The
sentences of the others shall be carried out at the discretion of
Brulor."</p>

<p>A priest scurried from the throne room to return presently with
three ptomes, one of which carried an extra water suit and helmet.
The Keeper of the Keys led them to Helen's cage, which he unlocked,
after which the ptomes entered, removed the girl's outer clothing
and dressed her in the water suit. Before they placed the helmet
over her head she turned toward d'Arnot, who stood with ashen face
pressed against the partition bars that separated their cages.</p>

<p>"Once more, good-bye," she said. "It will not be for long
now."</p>

<p>Emotion stifled the man's reply; and tears blinded him, as the
ptomes fitted the helmet over Helen's head; then they led her away.
He watched until she passed from sight through a doorway on the
opposite side of the temple; then he sank to the floor of his cage
and buried his head in his arms. Brian Gregory cursed aloud. He
cursed Atka and Brulor and The Father of Diamonds, but most of all
he cursed himself.</p>

<p>The Queen and her entourage left the temple, and presently
Brulor and the priests and the handmaidens were gone, leaving the
doomed men to their own unhappy company. Atan Thome jabbered
incessantly about The Father of Diamonds, while Lal Taask and
Akamen threatened and reviled him. Lavac sat on his haunches
staring at the doorway through which Helen had disappeared to pass
out of his life forever, but he knew that she was no more lost to
him than she had been before. Brian paced the length of his cage,
mumbling to himself. Tarzan and Herkuf spoke together in low tones.
D'Arnot was almost ill from desperation and hopelessness. He heard
Tarzan asking many questions of Herkuf, but they made no impression
on him. Helen was gone now forever. What difference did anything
else make? Why did Tarzan ask so many questions? It was not like
him; and anyway he, too, would soon be dead.</p>

<p>Silhouetted against the blue African sky, Ungo and his fellow
apes stood at the rim of the crater of Tuen-Baka and looked down
into the valley. They saw the green of the plains and the forests;
and they looked good to them after the barren outer slopes of the
mountain.</p>

<p>"We go down," grunted Ungo.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Tarzan there," suggested another.</p>

<p>"Food there," said Ungo. "Tarzan not there, we go back old
hunting grounds. This bad country for mangani."</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25">CHAPTER 25</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HELEN GREGORY was, despite her flair for adventure
and her not inconsiderable fortitude, essentially feminine. She was
the type that stirred the deepest protective instincts of men; and,
perhaps because of that very characteristic, she subconsciously
craved protection, though she would have been the last to realize
it. Fortified by the knowledge that masculine aid was within call,
she might have dared anything; while the realization that she was
alone among enemies, hopelessly cut off from all natural
protectors, left her a frightened little girl upon the verge of
panic. That she did not break under the strain speaks well for her
strength of character.</p>

<p>Her steps did not falter as the three ptomes led her from the
throne room and down a short corridor, through a room where many
ptomes were gathered lying upon narrow cots or playing at games,
their water suits and helmets hung upon pegs against the wall,
their tridents standing in racks, and along another corridor to a
massive door secured by huge bolts and flanked by valve hand-wheels
and levers. Here one of the ptomes turned wheels and pulled on
levers, and they all waited while he watched a gauge beside the
door.</p>

<p>This, she thought, must be the door to the torture chamber; and
she wondered what lay behind and how long death would be in coming
to her rescue. Death! Man's last refuge when hope is gone, his last
friend, his life's ultimate goal. She thought of her father and of
Brian and of Paul d'Arnot. They would be following her soon. She
wished that she and d'Arnot might have gone together. It would have
been easier for both had it been that way.</p>

<p>At last the door swung open and the ptomes pushed her into a
cylindrical chamber, following her in and closing and bolting the
door. Here were other hand-wheels and levers and gauges; and there
was an identical door on the opposite side of the chamber flanked
by similar gadgets. She saw no signs of instruments of torture, and
she wondered how they were going to kill her and why they had
brought her here to do it and why they all wore the strange
helmets. She watched while a ptome turned a hand-wheel, and caught
her breath as she saw water rushing into the chamber. They couldn't
be going to drown her, for if she drowned, they would drown too.
The chamber filled rapidly; and when it was full, one of them
manipulated the wheels and levers beside the second door; and when
it swung open, they led her out into the diffused light of the lake
bottom.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances she would have been entranced by the
beauty of the scene upon which the sun filtered down through the
clear waters of Horus. She found herself being led along a gravel
path between neat gardens of marine plants which other ptomes were
tending to serve as delicacies for the courts of Atka and Brulor.
Strange and beautiful fishes swam about them; and great turtles
paddled clumsily away as they approached, while crabs of many
colors scurried from their path. Here and there were marine trees
towering high, their foliage undulating gracefully to the movement
of the water, while bright colored fishes played among it like gay
birds among the branches of terrestrial trees. All was beauty and
movement and&mdash;silence. To the girl, the silence spoke more
loudly than the beauty or the movement&mdash;it bespoke the
silence of the tomb.</p>

<p>Inside the temple she had found walking arduous and slow,
impeded by the heavy metal soles of the shoes they had put on her;
but here she moved as though walking on air, lightly as a feather,
effortless as the passing of a shadow. She felt that she might leap
high above the trees if one of the ptomes were not holding her by
the arm; but these were only flashes of thought breaking
occasionally the dense gloom of the horror that engulfed her.</p>

<p>Presently she saw ahead of them a small circular building topped
by a single dome, and realized that it was toward this the ptomes
were leading her. When they reached the building, which seemed to
have neither doors nor windows, two ptomes seized Helen's arms, one
on either side, and leaped lightly upward, carrying her with them,
the third ptome following. A few swimming strokes carried them to
the top of the dome, where the girl saw a circular door, which she
recognized now, from the gadgets flanking it, as the entrance to an
air chamber such as that through which she had passed from the
temple to the lake bottom.</p>

<p>The chamber below was filled with water when they entered it,
and it was several minutes before it emptied; then the ptomes
removed her helmet and suit, lifted a trap door in the floor,
pointed to a ladder, and motioned her to descend. As in the upper
chamber, there was a window in the wall on the side opposite to
that from which they had approached the dome, which she had
previously thought windowless; and through this window the diffused
light of the lake bottom dimly illuminated the interior of the
circular room in which she was imprisoned. It was entirely
bare&mdash;the walls, the window, and the ladder constituted her
world. The ptomes had closed the trap door above her, and presently
she heard water gushing into the chamber above; then it commenced
to trickle down one wall of her prison, and presently the trickle
became a little stream. As water covered the floor of her cell, she
understood the nature of the torture and death that confronted her.
The chamber would fill slowly. She might prolong life and agony by
climbing the ladder, but the end was inevitably the same.</p>

<p>She realized what exquisite mental torture the minds of these
people had conceived, that one should be condemned to die alone,
drowned like a rat in a trap. She wondered if she would have the
courage to end it quickly when the water was deep enough, or if she
would drag out the torture to the topmost rung of the ladder.</p>

<p>And as the water rose slowly in Helen's death cell, Herkuf
whispered to Tarzan through the bars of his cage, "It will soon be
time. Do you think you can do it?"</p>

<p>"I can do my part," the ape-man assured him. "When the time
comes, let me know."</p>

<p>When night came and darkness settled above Horus a faint light
still filtered down through the waters to the death cell where
Helen waited for the end. It was the light of heavenly stars, but
it brought no hope of the doomed girl. The water was at her knees
now; and she stood with one hand on the ladder, still wondering
what she should do. She turned wearily; and, with both arms resting
on a rung of the ladder, buried her face in them. She thought of
d'Arnot and the happiness that might have been theirs had they met
under different circumstances; and, even with hope gone, that
thought made her want to cling to life as long as she could, for at
least there was a certain sad happiness in envisioning the
happiness she had been denied. She thought of Brian; and, without
bitterness toward him, she execrated the avarice that had lured him
to this awful place and cost the lives of so many people, people
who loved him. And she prayed.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Again Herkuf whispered to Tarzan. "It is time," he said. "They
will all be asleep. But the bars are very strong."</p>

<p>"Not so strong as Tarzan," replied the ape-man. "I have tried
them&mdash;watch!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he seized two bars. The muscles stood out upon his
shoulders as he exerted his strength upon the insensate metal.
Herkuf watched, breathless, and filled with doubt; then he saw the
bars spreading apart, and a moment later saw Tarzan squeeze between
them and push them back into place. Similarly the ape-man liberated
Herkuf.</p>

<p>"You are as strong as a bull elephant," gasped the priest.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Tarzan. "We have no time to waste. Lead the
way."</p>

<p>"No," replied Herkuf, "we have no time to waste. Even if we get
through without delay, we may still be too late."</p>

<p>Silently, stealthily, Herkuf and Tarzan crossed the temple
toward a closed door. The other prisoners slept. No one had seen
Tarzan escape and release Herkuf. Even the bars, bent back almost
to normal position, gave little evidence of the manner of their
liberation; and few would have believed the truth, for many have
been the prisoners who had sought to bend them; but never before
had it been done.</p>

<p>Herkuf led Tarzan down a short corridor to the room of the
ptomes; and as the priest opened the door, Tarzan saw the lesser
priests sleeping on their hard benches. He saw their water suits
hanging on their pegs and their tridents in the racks. The ptomes
slept thus without sentries and the temple went unguarded because
it was considered impregnable.</p>

<p>Cautiously the two men took three water suits and helmets from
their pegs, gathered up three tridents, and crossed the room to the
doorway on the opposite side without awakening a ptome. Once past
the door, each donned a suit.</p>

<p>"The gods have been with us so far," whispered Herkuf, "and if
we can pass through the air chamber without being discovered, we
stand a good chance to succeed&mdash;if we are in time."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As the water rose to Helen's shoulders she finally gave up all
thought of suicide. She would cling to life to the last moment.
They might rob her of that; but they could not rob her of her
courage, and as the water rose still higher she stepped to the
lowest rung of the ladder.</p>

<p>Reminiscences rioted through her mind as she waited for death,
and pleasant thoughts and bitter. She pondered the futility of
man's quest for sudden wealth and of the evil and suffering it
entailed. Of what avail would success be now to either Brian or
Thome if, by some chance, it should come to one of them? One had
lost his sister and, perhaps, his father, and the other had lost
his mind. Now the water forced her up to a higher rung of the
ladder. Step by step, she was climbing to her rendezvous with
Death.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Herkuf and Tarzan passed safely through the air chamber out into
the water of the lake. Through the garden of the ptomes they made
their way toward the watery cell where Death was creeping
relentlessly upon Helen Gregory, and dark shapes glided sinuously
about them in this mysterious world of silence.</p>

<p>At last they reached the air chamber above Helen's cell; and
Herkuf started the pump that would eject the water, but it seemed
to both men that it would never empty the chamber. They knew that
the water had been rising for hours in the death cell beneath them
and that death might come to the girl before they reached her, if
she were not already dead.</p>

<p>Just below them, clinging to the last few precious moments of
life, Helen had ascended the ladder as far as she could go; but the
water pursued her relentlessly. Already her head was touching the
ceiling. She could climb no farther. The cold hand of Death
caressed her cheek. Suddenly she became alert, listening. She heard
noises in the chamber above. What might they signify? Not rescue,
certainly; perhaps some new torture.</p>

<p>At last the air chamber was emptied. Tarzan and Herkuf attempted
to raise the trap door leading into Helen's cell; but it defied
their every effort, even the Herculean strength of the Lord of the
Jungle. And what was happening, or had happened, in the cell
below?&mdash;cell or tomb?</p>

<p>And while Tarzan and Herkuf labored with the trap door a ptome
awoke and sat up upon his hard bench, rubbing his eyes. He had had
a strange, disquieting dream in which enemies had passed through
the room of the ptomes. He looked about to see if anyone was there
who should not be. Mechanically, he looked for his water suit and
helmet. They were gone, and two other pegs were empty. Instantly he
awoke his fellows and disclosed his discovery, telling them of his
dream. They were all much perturbed, for such things had never
happened before in the memory of man. They started to investigate
immediately, going first to the throne room, where they soon
discovered that two of the prisoners were missing.</p>

<p>"Herkuf is gone and the man called Tarzan," said one.</p>

<p>"But three suits and tridents were taken," pointed out
another.</p>

<p>By this time the prisoners were awake; and they questioned them,
with many threats; but they learned nothing for the prisoners knew
nothing, and were quite as surprised as the ptomes.</p>

<p>"I have it!" cried a ptome at last. "It is quite plain that they
have gone to the little chamber in the lake to release the girl,
that is why they took the extra suit. Quick! Into your helmets! In
the name of Atka, hurry!"</p>

<p>"We must not all go, or the rest of the prisoners may escape as
the others did," suggested one; so only six of them donned their
suits and hurried into the waters of Horus in pursuit of the two
missing prisoners. Armed as they were, with tridents and knives,
they had no thought but that they could easily overcome and
recapture their quarry.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>For many precious minutes the trap door refused to yield to the
efforts of Tarzan and Herkuf; but at last it gave way, and they
threw it open. Looking down into the darkness, they at first saw
nothing; then Tarzan espied, dimly, a wan face apparently floating
on the surface of the water. Were they, after all, too late? Was
this the face of a dead girl?</p>

<p>Holding to the ladder and floating with her nose just above the
water, Helen heard increasing sounds of activity just above her;
then the trap door was lifted, and she saw two ptomes looking down
at her. As they dragged her into the air chamber, she guessed that
they had come to inflict some new torture.</p>

<p>They helped her to don the extra water suit, and led her out of
the air chamber into the lake. In their suits and helmets, she did
not recognize them; and as there was no means of communication, she
went on with them, ignorant of their identity, wondering what next
Fate had in store for her.</p>

<p>As Herkuf led them away from the vicinity of the temple, the
pursuing ptomes discovered them and hurried to overtake them. In
the silence of the watery depths, no sound reached the ears of the
fugitives; and they were ignorant of the danger approaching from
behind; until, finally, Tarzan, always the wary jungle beast,
looked back and saw the ptomes approaching. He touched Herkuf and
Helen, and pointed; then he gathered them together, so that they
all stood back to back to await the assault of the enemy he well
knew they could not outdistance in flight. What the outcome of such
a battle would be, he could not even guess. He knew that they were
all unused to fighting in such a medium and with such weapons. A
single rent in a suit might mean death by drowning, and doubtless
their antagonists were adepts in the use of tridents. What he did
not know was that the ptomes were as unused to underwater fighting
as was he. Sometimes they had to defend themselves from the more
dangerous denizens of the deep, but never had they been called upon
to face human antagonists and weapons identical to their own.</p>

<p>So it was that Tarzan and Herkuf drew first blood; and now, for
the first time, Helen realized that she might be in the hands of
friends; yet that seemed entirely implausible, for how could she
have friends among the ptomes?</p>

<p>With two of their number dead in the first encounter with the
enemy, the four remaining ptomes became more wary. They circled
cautiously, waiting for an opening; but there seemed no opening in
the impregnable defense of the three, who could not be lured from
the compact formation that presented a trident on every front.
Suddenly one of the ptomes leaped above the heads of the quarry to
attack them from a new angle; and as he did so, his fellows rushed
in. But they rushed too close, and two of them went to their deaths
on the tridents of Herkuf and Tarzan; then the one above them
floated down and struck at the ape-man. As he did so, Helen jabbed
suddenly upward with her trident, catching the fellow squarely in
the chest. He wriggled horribly, like a speared fish, and then sank
limply at her feet. The girl had to steel herself to keep from
fainting.</p>

<p>With his fellows dead, the remaining ptome turned and fled
toward the temple; but Tarzan dared not let him escape to bring
reinforcements; so he pursued him, feeling like one in a bad dream,
who makes strenuous efforts but accomplishes little or nothing.
However, the ptome had the same watery medium to contend with; but
not the giant muscles to overcome it that his pursuer possessed; so
gradually Tarzan gained on him, while Herkuf and Helen followed in
his wake.</p>

<p>When the ptome realized that he could not make good his escape,
he turned at bay and prepared to fight; and Tarzan found him the
most dangerous antagonist of all, for he was fighting with the
desperation of a cornered rat. It was the strangest duel the
ape-man had ever fought. The weird, mysterious silence of the
depths; the grotesque medium that retarded his every movement; all
baffled him. He was accustomed to fighting on one plane and not
having antagonists leap above his head and thrust down at him, as
the ptome suddenly did; but he fended the thrust, and seized his
foe by the ankle. The ptome struggled to free himself, thrusting
savagely with his trident; but at last Tarzan was sure of himself,
as he dragged the lesser priest toward him.</p>

<p>At close quarters, the tridents were useless; and both men
discarded them, each drawing his knife, the ptome slashing
viciously but awkwardly at Tarzan, while the ape-man sought to
seize the other's knife wrist; and while they fought, a large fish,
swimming low, approached them; and Helen and Herkuf hurried up,
like two hideous robots held back by an invisible hand.</p>

<p>Tarzan's fingers were touching the wrist of the ptome He had
almost succeeded in seizing the hand that held the dagger, when the
great fish, frightened by the approach of Helen and Herkuf, darted
past in an effort to escape, struck Tarzan's legs a heavy blow, and
upset him. As the ape-man fell backward, the ptome saw and seized
his opportunity. He lunged forward upon the falling Tarzan, his
knife ready to plunge into his foe's heart.</p>

<p>But once again Tarzan fended the weapon aside; and as he parried
the blow, Helen and Herkuf reached him and plunged their tridents
into the body of the ptome. As Tarzan floated to his feet, Helen
wondered whose life it was she had helped to save and what his
intentions toward her might be.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26">CHAPTER 26</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the temple of Brulor all was confusion and
excitement. Priests and warriors filled the throne room,
investigating the mysterious disappearance of two prisoners. The
locks of their cages were intact, and only d'Arnot guessed the
truth as he noted a slight bend in two of the bars of Tarzan's
cage.</p>

<p>"Once again there is hope," he whispered to Brian.</p>

<p>An excited ptome ran into the throne room; and, tearing off his
helmet, hurried to the foot of Brulor's throne. "O Father of
Diamonds," he cried, "I went to the little chamber in the lake. The
woman is gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone? Where?" demanded Brulor.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" replied the ptome. "All that I know is that she is
not there and that scattered over the bottom of Horus are the
bodies of six ptomes, their water suits stripped from three. A
demon is in our midst, O Father!"</p>

<p>Brulor leaped to his feet, trembling with rage. "They are not
demons," he cried, "but mortal men who may die. One is that
renegade, Herkuf; the other is the man called Tarzan. Whoever
brings them to me, dead or alive, may name his own reward; but
bring them alive if you can. Whoever profanes the temple of Brulor
must die. So it is written."</p>

<p>And while Brulor raged, the objects of his wrath, led by Herkuf,
were far out on the bottom of Horus. Having stripped the water
suits from three of the dead ptomes, they had followed Herkuf, who
was bent on leading them across the lake in accordance with the
plan that he and Tarzan had decided upon before their escape from
the temple. Good fortune had given them possession of three extra
water suits, which would fit in nicely with the plan they had in
mind&mdash;a mad plan, but the only one that seemed at all likely
to succeed.</p>

<p>As they approached deeper water, they descended into a valley of
huge marine plants; and here they encountered the larger denizens
of the deep; so that they were constantly compelled to fight off
attacks, as monstrous, shadowy shapes glided about them. Mighty,
grotesque plants waved their fronds above them in the dim light of
the fading stars.</p>

<p>Helen was frankly terrified. She had no idea who these men were,
nor where they were taking her, nor what their intentions toward
her; and in addition to these, she did not see how they could
escape the terrifying dangers that surrounded them, made doubly
terrifying by the darkness and the strangeness of the scene. She
felt that she could endure no more, and then a huge sea serpent
swam from among the giant trees and rushed to attack them.</p>

<p>The men faced its horrible jaws with their puny tridents, while
its long, sinuous tail wreathed in spirals above them, like a
sentient Damoclean sword that might destroy them at any moment. Its
protruding eyes glaring, its forked tongue darting from its fanged
jaws, the serpent suddenly wrapped its tail about Helen and swam
off. Instantly Tarzan dropped the extra water suit and helmet he
had been carrying and sprang up in an effort to reach them, as
Herkuf stood helpless on the lake bottom below.</p>

<p>Just by chance, the ape-man succeeded in seizing one of Helen's
ankles, but he could not wrest her from the grip of that powerful
tail. Slowly he drew himself up over the body of the girl in an
effort to reach the body of the serpent. At the same time he tried
to wrest her free; but the coils only tightened about her; and as
the angry saurian turned and twisted, he had difficulty in holding
on at all. It was only his great strength and agility that, despite
his encumbering water suit, permitted him, finally, to climb to the
monster's back. Again and again he drove his knife into the cold
body, while Helen marvelled at the courage and strength of her
unknown paladin.</p>

<p>Painfully, but not seriously wounded, the saurian dropped the
girl and turned upon the man-thing that dared thus to question its
supremacy. Bleeding, hurt, infuriated, a creature of demoniacal
fury, its one thought now was to destroy this rash thing that
threatened its right to self-preservation. Fending off the jaws
with his sharp knife that inflicted hurts which caused the serpent
to recoil, Tarzan climbed steadily toward the great throat. Numa,
the lion; Sheeta, the leopard; Wappi, the antelope; and man he had
killed by severing the jugular. Why not this creature, too, in
which blood flowed?</p>

<p>At last he reached his goal; and here, beneath the great throat,
he found the tenderest skin his blade had yet pierced; and with a
single stroke he severed the vein he had been seeking. There was a
gush of blood, the creature writhed convulsively for a few moments;
and then, as Tarzan slipped from its back, it turned belly up and
floated away; while the ape-man sank gently toward the floor of the
lake, where Helen stood, wide-eyed and wondering, looking up at
him.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking; and the increasing light made it possible for
them to see to greater distances than before, and as Tarzan looked
about for Herkuf, he saw him approaching, bringing along the water
suit and helmet that Tarzan had discarded.</p>

<p>From this point on, the lake bottom rose steeply, taxing Helen's
energies to such an extent that Tarzan had to help her for the
remainder of the way to shore. Herkuf was not much better off than
Helen, but he managed to stagger out of the water to fall exhausted
on the bank. Only Tarzan seemed fresh and untired.</p>

<p>They lost no time in removing the uncomfortable helmets, and
when Helen saw Tarzan's face she cried out in astonishment.
"Tarzan!" she exclaimed. "But I might have known that it was you,
for who else could have done for me what you have?"</p>

<p>"Paul," he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>"You're sweet," she said. "Oh, what a relief to feel safe once
more. How wonderful to be alive after all that we have gone
through, after that terrible chamber where they would have drowned
me. I can't believe yet that I have escaped."</p>

<p>Close to shore, Herkuf had speared a fish; and now he led them
to a cave he knew of; and while Helen and Tarzan lay on the ground,
he built a fire and broiled his catch.</p>

<p>"What are your plans?" Helen asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Herkuf knows where a boat is hidden on this side of the lake.
We thought it safer to come here rather than to attempt to steal
one from the quay at Ashair, knowing that after our escape was
discovered there would be sentries everywhere. Tonight, we shall
row across the lake; and Herkuf and I will go down in water suits
and try to get past the ptomes again and bring out d'Arnot, Brian,
and Lavac. That is why we took the three suits from the ptomes we
killed. We were going to try to steal them from the ptomes' room.
Now we won't have to go through that room, as we did before to
steal suits, as Herkuf says there is a way around it."</p>

<p>"After we have eaten and rested," said Herkuf, "I'll go and see
if the boat is still where I hid it. That was many years ago; but
it was well hidden, and it is seldom that anyone comes to this part
of the valley. I sank it in a tiny inlet beneath bushes that
overhung the water."</p>

<p>"It has probably rotted away by this time," suggested Helen.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," replied Herkuf. "It would only rot if exposed
to the air."</p>

<p>As they ate the broiled fish, they discussed their plans and
recalled the adventures through which they had passed; and Helen
asked Herkuf how it had been possible to construct the temple at
the bottom of the lake. "That seems to me," she said, "an
engineering feat far beyond the capabilities of the Asharians, for
nothing else that they have accomplished, as far as I have seen,
suggests more than a primitive knowledge of engineering. With the
exception of these diving helmets, I have seen nothing that
indicates great inventive genius, either."</p>

<p>"It was the invention of the diving helmet, coupled with a
natural phenomenon, that made it possible to build the temple,"
explained Herkuf. "We are a very ancient race. We have occupied the
valley of Tuen-Baka for perhaps three thousand years. Our origin is
legendary, but it is believed that our early ancestors came down
from the north, bringing with them a well developed civilization
and considerable engineering knowledge. There were two factions or
tribes. One settled at what is now Thobos, the other at Ashair. It
was an Asharian who invented the diving helmet. He was always
puttering around with metals and chemicals, trying to make gold
from common substances; and during his experiments, he accidentally
discovered a combination of chemicals that, when water was poured
on them, generated air that could be breathed; but he had a sad end
just as he was about to transmute a black powder he had compounded
into gold. All that was necessary, he believed, was to apply great
pressure suddenly; so he placed a little of it on a piece of lava
and struck it with a hammer. There was a terrific noise and much
smoke; and the roof blew off the inventor's house, and he went with
it. One of his assistants, who miraculously escaped death, saw it
all. But, though he did not succeed in making gold, he left behind
him a great invention in the form of the diving helmet, which was
thoroughly perfected and in common use, though more for sport than
for any practical purpose."</p>

<p>"But what had that to do with the building of the temple?" asked
Helen.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. Off shore from Ashair, at the point above
where the temple now stands, the water was always in constant
turmoil, a jet of it often flying into the air fifty or a hundred
feet with a great hissing sound. The origin of this phenomenon was
a mystery which the Asharians would have liked to solve; so, one
day, a venturesome youth donned a water suit and helmet and set
forth on the bottom of the lake to investigate. He was gone about
half an hour, when watchers on the shore saw him shoot up, above
the surface of the water at the spot where the phenomenon occurred.
By a miracle, he was not killed; and when he finally came back to
shore, he reported that a great geyser of air was shooting up from
a hole in the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>"It was many years later that some one conceived the idea of
building a temple around the air geyser to house the priesthood and
holy of holies. Thousands of slaves were captured and set to
cutting the lava blocks that were to form the temple walls.
Innumerable water suits and helmets were made. The most difficult
part of the work was the capping of the air geyser, but this was
finally accomplished; then the building of the temple commenced. It
took a thousand years and cost twice that many lives. When it was
completed and tightly sealed, it was, of course, entirely filled
with water; but when the valve that had been installed in the
geyser cap was opened, the water was forced out of the temple
through a one-way valve. Today, the geyser furnishes pure air for
the temple and actuates the doors of the air chambers."</p>

<p>"How wonderful!" commented Helen. "But where does this air
supply come from?"</p>

<p>"It is, of course, mere conjecture," replied Herkuf; "but the
theory is that during a great eruption, when Tuen-Baka was an
active volcano, the entire top of the mountain was blown off and
that when a great portion of it fell back into the crater it
imprisoned a vast quantity of air, under great pressure, in a
subterranean reservoir."</p>

<p>"And when that supply is exhausted?" inquired the girl.</p>

<p>Herkuf shrugged. "Horus will reclaim the temple. But there is
yet a second theory. It is possible that there exists beneath the
temple an immense deposit of the very chemicals that we use in our
helmets, and that the trickling of water from the lake into this
deposit is constantly generating fresh air."</p>

<p>"What a world of thought and labor and lives must have gone into
the building of that structure!" exclaimed Helen, "and to what
purpose? Why do men so waste their energies?"</p>

<p>"Does your race build no temples to its gods?" asked Herkuf.</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27">CHAPTER 27</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MAGRA and Gregory halted on a rocky hillside above
Ashair. The hot sun beat down upon them from a cloudless sky, the
frowning walls of Tuen-Baka towered above them, below them
stretched the calm waters of sacred Horas; and in the distance the
entrance to the tunnel leading to the outer world beckoned to them
and mocked them.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are," said Gregory. "This must be the secret
entrance to the tunnel."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Magra, "we are here; but what now?"</p>

<p>"After what those poor devils told us," replied Gregory, "I
think it would be foolish to throw our lives away uselessly by
entering such a trap."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Magra. "We could accomplish
nothing if we succeeded in getting into the temple. We'd only be
captured and upset all of Tarzan's plans if he is successful in
what he is attempting."</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," said Gregory, "is what has become of
Helen, Brian, d'Arnot, and Lavac. Do you suppose they all went into
the temple to help Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"They may have, or they may all have been recaptured. About all
we can do is wait."</p>

<p>"Suppose we go on below Ashair and look for a hiding place. If
we are between Ashair and the entrance to the tunnel, they will
have to pass us to get out of the valley, for there is no other way
out, so far as I know."</p>

<p>"I think you are right," agreed Gregory, "but I wonder if it
will be safe to try to pass Ashair in the day time."</p>

<p>"Just as safe as it is to remain here at the mouth of this
secret passage to their temple. Some of the Asharians may stumble
upon us here at any time."</p>

<p>"All right," said Gregory, "let's try it. There are quantities
of enormous lava blocks farther up at the foot of the escarpment.
We may be able to make our way past the city and be entirely
screened from it by them."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Magra.</p>

<p>They made the laborious ascent to the jumbled pile of lava that
had fallen from above; and though the going was rough, they found
that they were entirely hidden from the city, and eventually came
down again close to the lake well beyond Ashair.</p>

<p>Between them and the lake a low, limestone ridge shut off their
view of the water. It paralleled the shore line, and extended for
about a quarter of a mile, falling gradually to the level of the
surrounding land. Upon its summit shrubs grew sparsely and a few
gnarled trees. A rise of land hid it from Ashair.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Magra, pointing. "Isn't that a cave?"</p>

<p>"It looks like one," replied Gregory. "We'll have a look at it.
If it's habitable, we're in luck, for we can hide there and keep a
lookout for the others from the summit of the ridge."</p>

<p>"How about food?" asked Magra.</p>

<p>"I imagine we can find fruit and nuts in some of those larger
trees just below the ridge," replied Gregory, "and if I have any
luck at all I should be able to get a fish now and then."</p>

<p>As they talked, they approached the entrance to the cave, which,
from the outside, appeared to be perfectly adapted to their needs;
but they entered it cautiously. For a short distance only was the
interior visible in the dim light that came through the entrance;
beyond that they could see nothing.</p>

<p>"I think I'll explore a little before we settle down to light
housekeeping," said Gregory.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you."</p>

<p>The cave narrowed into a dark corridor, which they followed,
gropingly, in almost total darkness; but at a sharp turn it became
lighter, and presently they came into a large cavern into which the
sun poured through an opening in the roof. The cavern was large and
grotesquely beautiful. Stalactites of various hues depended from
ceiling and walls, while strangely shaped stalagmites covered much
of the floor. Erosion had wrought strange limestone figures which
rose like the creations of some mad sculptor among the tinted
stalagmites.</p>

<p>"What a gorgeous spectacle!" exclaimed Magra.</p>

<p>"It is marvelous, and the coloring is beautiful," agreed
Gregory, "but I think we should explore a little farther to make
certain that it is a safe place for us to hide."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Magra, "you're quite right. There's an opening there
at the far end of the cavern that may lead to something else. Let's
have a look at it."</p>

<p>They found that the opening led into another corridor, dark and
tortuous; and as they felt their way along it, Magra shuddered.</p>

<p>"There is something uncanny about this place," she
whispered.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Gregory. "That's just because it's dark in
here. Women don't like the dark."</p>

<p>"Do you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, no; but just because a place is dark doesn't mean that
it's dangerous."</p>

<p>"But," she insisted, "I have a feeling that we are being watched
by unseen eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just your imagination, my dear child," laughed
Gregory. "Your nerves are unstrung; and I don't wonder, after all
that you have gone through. It's surprising that we're not all
nervous wrecks."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that it's imagination," replied Magra. "I tell
you I can feel that we are not alone. Something is near us.
Something is watching us. Let's go back and get out of this
terrible place. It's evil. I know it."</p>

<p>"Try and calm yourself, my dear," soothed Gregory; "there's no
one near us; and anyway, if the place is evil, we want to know
it."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right," said Magra; "but I'm still terrified;
and, as you know, I'm not easily frightened. Here's an opening in
the wall. It may be another corridor. Which one had we better
take?"</p>

<p>"I think we'll keep right on in this one," replied Gregory. "It
seems to be the main corridor. If we start turning off, we may
become lost. I've heard of people being lost down in caves in
Kentucky or Virginia or somewhere, and never being found
again."</p>

<p>Just then a hand seized Magra from behind and whisked her
through the opening they had just passed. Gregory heard a single
piercing scream behind him, and wheeled about. To his horror, he
found that he was alone. Magra had disappeared. He called her name
aloud, but there was no reply; then he turned to go back and search
for her. As he did so, another hand reached out from an opening on
the opposite side of the corridor and seized him. He struggled and
fought; but all his efforts were futile, and he was dragged into
the darkness of a side corridor.</p>

<p>Magra, too, had fought for her liberty, but uselessly. The
powerful creature that had seized her, dragged her along the dark
corridor in silence. She did not know whether she were in the
clutches of a man or a beast. After her experience with Ungo, it
was only natural that she might have been in doubt.</p>

<p>The corridor was not long, and presently it ended in a second
large cavern. It was then that she saw that her captor was a white
robed figure with hooded face. She saw the bare hands and knew that
it was no ape that had seized her, but a man. There were a number
of others like him in the cavern, in the center of which was a pool
of water.</p>

<p>At the far end of the cavern a throne stood upon a dais; and
before the throne was an altar, while directly behind it was an
opening, roughly arched, looking out upon the lake, which was
almost on a level with the floor of the cavern. The cavern was
beautiful; but the whole scene was given a weird aspect by the
presence of the sinister, silent, white robed figures that stood
staring at her through dimly seen eyes that showed through slits in
their hoods.</p>

<p>Magra had scarcely more than taken in the scene before her when
she saw Gregory being dragged in as she had been. They looked at
one another resignedly, and Gregory shook his head. "Guess we're in
for it," he said. "Looks like the Klu Klux Klan. You were right.
Some of them must have been watching us."</p>

<p>"I wonder what they are," she said, "and what they want of us.
God! Haven't we been through enough, without this?"</p>

<p>"I don't wonder Tuen-Baka is taboo and Ashair forbidden. If I
ever get out of it, it will be taboo as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"If we ever get out," she said rather wistfully.</p>

<p>"We got out of Thobos," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but we have no Tarzan nor any Thetan here. Now we
are on our own, and we are helpless."</p>

<p>"Maybe they don't intend us any harm," he suggested. "If I only
knew their language, I'd ask 'em. They have a language. They've
been whispering together ever since they brought us in."</p>

<p>"Try Swahili," she suggested. "Every one else we've seen in this
accursed country speaks it."</p>

<p>"My Swahili is a little lame," he said, "but if they understand
Swahili maybe they can make it out." He turned toward the nearest
white robed figure, and cleared his throat. "Why did you bring us
here?" he asked. "What are you going to do with us? We haven't done
anything to you."</p>

<p>"You dared enter the temple of the true god," replied the man.
"Who are you to dare enter the sacred temple of Chon?"</p>

<p>"They are minions of Atka," said another.</p>

<p>"Or spies of the false Brulor," suggested a third.</p>

<p>"We are nothing of the kind," said Magra. "We are just strangers
who became lost. All we want to do is find our way out of
Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>"Then why did you come here?"</p>

<p>"We were looking for a place to hide until we could get out,"
replied the girl.</p>

<p>"You are probably lying. We shall keep you here until the true
god returns; then you shall learn your fate and the manner of your
death."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28">CHAPTER 28</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER they had rested, Herkuf, Helen, and Tarzan
went to look for the boat that Herkuf had hidden, in which they
were to return to the temple of Brulor in an attempt to rescue
d'Arnot, Brian, and Lavac. The inlet in which he had sunk it was
not a great distance from the cave they had chosen; and as almost
the entire distance was through wooded country, they had no fear of
being detected by the occupants of any of the Asharian galleys
which occasionally passed within eyesight of the shore, as they
patrolled the lower end of Horus in eternal quest of their
hereditary enemies from Thobos.</p>

<p>When they reached the inlet, Herkuf parted the overhanging
bushes and looked down into the shallow water. "This is the place,"
he muttered to himself. "I know it is the place. I cannot be
mistaken."</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked Tarzan. "Can't you find it?"</p>

<p>"This is the place," repeated Herkuf, "but the boat is not here.
Though I hid it carefully, some one found it. Now all our plans are
wrecked. What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Can't we walk around the end of the lake and enter the water
near the temple from the Asharian shore?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"The escarpment at the lower end of the lake is unscalable,"
replied Herkuf. "If we went by way of Thobos, we should most
certainly be captured; and although I was once a priest of Chon at
Thobos, no one would know me now; and we should all be
imprisoned."</p>

<p>"Maybe we could build a raft," suggested the girl.</p>

<p>Herkuf shook his head. "We have no tools," he said; "and even if
we had, we'd never dare attempt it, as the Asharians would be sure
to discover us."</p>

<p>"Must we give up, then?" demanded Helen. "Oh, we can't do that
and leave Paul and Brian and Lavac to die."</p>

<p>"There is a way," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Herkuf.</p>

<p>"When it is dark, I'll swim to Ashair and steal a boat from the
quay there."</p>

<p>"That is impossible," said Herkuf. "You saw with what we had to
contend when we crossed last night. You wouldn't get halfway
across, swimming at the surface. We'd better walk back."</p>

<p>"It was only by the best of luck that we got across last night,"
Tarzan reminded him. "We might not be so lucky another time; and,
if we did succeed, we should still be without a boat to return to
Thobos or escape through the tunnel. You know that the success of
our whole plan rested upon our having a boat. I shall swim the lake
tonight."</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Tarzan; please don't," begged Helen. "You would
just be throwing your life away uselessly."</p>

<p>"I do not intend to throw my life away at all," he replied. "I
have my knife."</p>

<p>They returned to the cave to await darkness; and, finding it
impossible to dissuade Tarzan from his plan, Herkuf and Helen
finally gave up in despair; and, when darkness fell, they stood at
the shore line and watched him wade into the dark waters of Horus.
With straining eyes they watched his progress until he disappeared
from their view in the darkness, and even then they remained where
they were, staring out into the black void across the blacker
waters.</p>

<p>Tarzan had completed about half the distance to the Asharian
shore without encountering any dangers, when he saw a torch flare
suddenly in the bow of a galley only a short distance from him. He
watched it; and when it altered its course and came toward him, he
realized that he had been discovered. To be taken now by an
Asharian galley would doubtless mean death not only for him but for
the men he was risking his life to save, and so he grasped at the
only chance he had to elude them. Diving, he swam away, trying to
escape the circle of their torch's light; and, glancing back, he
felt that he might succeed, for the light appeared to be receding;
but as he rose toward the surface for air before diving again, he
saw a shadowy form approaching him; and knew that at last the thing
that Helen and Herkuf had so feared had happened. He recalled his
words of assurance to them, "I have my knife," and half-smiled as
he drew it.</p>

<p>On Ashair's distant wall, a sentry saw the flare of the torch
out upon the lake and summoned an officer. "A galley from Thobos,"
he said, "for there are no Asharian galleys out tonight."</p>

<p>The officer nodded. "I wonder why they risked a light," he said.
"They always sneak by in the night without torches. Well, it is our
good luck, and because of it we shall have a prize tonight and some
more victims for Atka and Brulor."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As the great shark turned on its back to seize Tarzan, he
plunged his knife into its belly and ripped it open for a distance
of several feet. Mortally hurt, the great fish thrashed about in
its agony, dyeing the water crimson with its blood and creating a
great commotion upon the surface of the lake, a commotion that
attracted the attention of those in the galley.</p>

<p>The ape-man, avoiding the lashing tail and angry jaws of the
shark, now saw other great forms converging upon them, silent,
sinister tigers of the deep attracted at first, like their fellow,
by the light of the torch in the bow of the galley; but now by the
blood of the wounded shark. Terrible creatures, they were coming
for the kill.</p>

<p>His lungs bursting, Tarzan swam toward the surface for air,
confident that the wounded shark would occupy the attention of the
others. He knew, from the radiance of the water, that he would come
up close to the galley; but he had to choose between that and death
from drowning; there was no other alternative.</p>

<p>As he broke the surface of the water, he was close beside the
galley; and warriors seized him and drew him over the gunwale. Here
now was an end to all the fine plans he and Herkuf had concocted,
for to fall into the hands of the Asharians must be equivalent to
the signing of his death warrant; but as he looked at his captors
he saw the black plumes of Thobos and heard a familiar voice call
him by name. It was Thetan's.</p>

<p>"We were sneaking past Ashair without lights," he said, "on our
way down river to capture a few slaves; but what in the world were
you doing out here in the middle of Horus?"</p>

<p>"I was swimming to Ashair to steal a boat," replied the
ape-man.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" demanded Thetan. "No man could hope to live in
these waters. Why, they are alive with flesh eaters."</p>

<p>"So I discovered, but I think I should have gotten through. I
must have been halfway across. It was not my life that was at
stake, Thetan, but those of my friends who are prisoners in Ashair.
I must reach Ashair and get a boat."</p>

<p>Thetan thought for a moment; then he said, "I'll take you. I can
land you on the shore below the city, but I advise you to give up
all thought of it. You cannot enter Ashair without being
discovered, and that will be the end of you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go ashore," replied Tarzan. "I have two
companions across the lake from the city. If you will take the
three of us to a point above the temple of Brulor, I won't have to
go ashore and steal a boat."</p>

<p>"What good will that do you?" demanded Thetan.</p>

<p>"We have water suits and helmets. We are going into the temple
to get our friends, and I've got to take Brulor and The Father of
Diamonds to Herat to get him to release Magra and Gregory."</p>

<p>"They've already escaped," said Thetan, "and Herat is furious."
He did not say that he had helped them, as other Thobotian warriors
were listening.</p>

<p>"That really doesn't make much difference," said Tarzan. "We
can't escape from Tuen-Baka without Herat's aid. We'll need a
galley and provisions. If I bring Brulor and The Father of Diamonds
to him, he'll give us what we need, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Thetan, "but you won't ever bring Brulor and The
Father of Diamonds to Herat. What chance have you, practically
unaided, to do what we have been trying to do for years?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "I still must try," he said. "Will you help
me?"</p>

<p>"If I can't dissuade you, I'll help you. Where are your
friends?"</p>

<p>Tarzan pointed in the general direction of the cave where he had
left Helen and Herkuf, the torch was extinguished, and the galley's
nose turned toward the shore.</p>

<p>From the quay at Ashair, six galleys put out without lights into
the darkness of the night to search for the quarry, which they
could no longer see since the torch had been extinguished; and as
they rowed from shore, they fanned out, some up river, some down,
to cover the most territory in their search.</p>

<p>The shore line ahead of the galley bearing Tarzan was a long,
black silhouette against the night sky. No landmarks were visible;
and the shore was a straight, black line without breaks or
indentations. Only the merest chance might bring them to the spot
where Helen and Herkuf waited. When they were quite close to shore,
Tarzan called Herkuf's name in a low voice; and immediately there
came an answering hail from their right. A few minutes later the
keel of the galley touched gravel a few yards from shore, and
Tarzan leaped out and waded to where Helen and Herkuf stood. They
were amazed that he had returned so soon, amazed that he had
returned at all, for they had seen the torchlit galley and believed
that he had been captured by Asharians.</p>

<p>Briefly he explained what had occurred; and, telling Herkuf to
follow with the water suits and helmets and weapons, he tossed
Helen to a shoulder and waded back to the galley, which turned its
nose toward Ashair as soon as Herkuf was aboard. Tarzan, Helen, and
Herkuf immediately donned their water suits, leaving their helmets
off, temporarily, so that they could talk.</p>

<p>Silently, the galley glided out into the lake, the oars dipping
without noise as they were plied by thirty well trained slaves, who
had learned by long experience the necessity for stealth in passing
through the lower waters of Horus where Asharian galleys might be
lying in wait for them&mdash;Asharian galleys and Asharian
warriors who might send them to the bottom chained to their
thwarts. About mid-lake a torch suddenly burst into flame to the
right of them; then another to the left, and in quick succession
four more between them, forming a semi-circle toward the center of
which they were moving. With the lighting of the torches, a loud
Asharian war cry broke the deathly stillness of the night; and the
Asharian galleys moved to encircle that of Thetan.</p>

<p>Nothing but immediate flight might save the Thobotians; and as
the prow of the galley turned quickly toward the lower end of the
lake in an effort to elude the jaws of the closing circle of enemy
galleys, Tarzan called to Helen and Herkuf to don their helmets as
he adjusted his own; then, seizing Helen's hand and signalling
Herkuf to follow, he leaped overboard with the girl, while Thetan
urged his slaves to greater speed.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29">CHAPTER 29</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HAND in hand, Tarzan and Helen sank gently down to
the darkness of the lake's bottom. If Herkuf were near them, they
could see nothing of him; and so Tarzan waited for the coming of
the new day that would lift the black veil from the mysteries of
Horus's depths, as to proceed without Herkuf might easily foredoom
the entire venture to failure. That they might never find him,
Tarzan was aware; but he could only wait and hope.</p>

<p>It was an eerie experience for Helen Gregory that was rendered
doubly trying by the recollection of her previous experiences in
this silent world of horrors. Dimly seen, great forms glided
through the forest of grotesque tree-like plants that waved their
dark foliage on every hand. Momentarily, the girl expected some
hideous monster to attack; but the night passed and dawn broke
without their having once been threatened. It seemed a miracle to
her, but the explanation probably lay in the fact that they had
remained quietly sitting on the gravelly bottom. Had they been
moving, it might have been different.</p>

<p>As the light of the new day filtered down to them, Tarzan looked
about for Herkuf; but he was nowhere to be seen. Reluctantly, the
ape-man started off across the lake toward the temple of Brulor.
What he could accomplish alone, he did not know, as part of the
plan was to enter the temple during a period of meditation and
release the prisoners; but of the three, only Herkuf was familiar
with the mechanism that operated the doors to the air chamber and
emptied and refilled it; only Herkuf knew the exact time of the
periods of meditation.</p>

<p>Unable to communicate with Tarzan, Helen followed where he led,
ignorant of his new plans but more secure in her faith in him than
he was of himself in this particular venture, where every condition
varied so from all that he had been accustomed to meet in the
familiar jungles that he knew so well.</p>

<p>They had gone but a short distance in the direction in which
Tarzan thought the temple lay, when they came upon Herkuf. He, too,
had been waiting for daylight, feeling certain that Tarzan would
have done the same and that, having leaped overboard almost
simultaneously, they could not be far separated. It was with
feelings of the greatest relief that they found themselves
reunited.</p>

<p>Herkuf took the lead now, and with Tarzan and Helen following,
commenced the tiresome and dangerous journey toward Ashair, all of
them now greatly encouraged after the long hours of doubt and
uncertainty.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they came upon the wreck of a large
galley partly embedded in the sand. That it had been there for
years was attested by the size of the marine growth which had
sprouted through its ribs, entwining the skeletons of its slaves
still lying in their rusted chains.</p>

<p>Herkuf evinced considerable excitement; and, motioning them to
wait, clambered into the interior of the craft, from which he
presently emerged carrying a splendid jeweled casket. That he was
overcome by excitement was obvious, but hampered by his helmet he
could only express it by waving the casket before their faces and
dancing jubilantly. What it was he had recovered, they could not
guess, unless it were that the casket contained treasure of
fabulous worth.</p>

<p>At last, and without further adventure, they approached the
temple of Brulor; and here they went cautiously, seeking the
shelter of the trees and plants that grew in the gardens of the
ptomes, moving stealthily from one to another, each time assuring
themselves that no ptome was in sight, knowing that at any moment
one might emerge from the air chamber that they could now see.
Approaching the temple, they found a place where they could hide
concealed from the gardens and the air chamber door. Here they must
wait until Herkuf signalled that the time had arrived when it might
be safe to enter the temple. How long that would be only he could
guess with any degree of accuracy. Near them was a window through
which they could have looked into the temple had they dared; but as
long as it was light outside they could not take the risk; and so
they waited, tired, hungry, and thirsty&mdash;waited for night to
fall.</p>

<p>Inside the temple the caged prisoners were gnawing on their
evening meal of raw fish. Atan Thome enlarged in glowing terms upon
his plans when he should come into possession of The Father of
Diamonds and dazzle the world with his wealth. Lal Taask, scowling,
cursed him. Akamen brooded in silence upon his lost liberty and his
vanished dream of power. Brian and d'Arnot spoke together in low
tones. Lavac paced his cage like a captive polar bear.</p>

<p>"I think your friend, Tarzan, has run off and left us," remarked
Brian.</p>

<p>"You think that because you don't know him as well as I do,"
replied d'Arnot. "As long as he and we live he will try to rescue
us."</p>

<p>"He will have to be a super-man to do it," said Brian.</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;that and all of that. He may fail, of course, but
he will come nearer succeeding than any man who lives."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, he got Helen out of that torture chamber they'd
put her in," said Brian. "Wasn't old Brulor sore, though! Of course
he really hasn't had time to get her to a place of safety and come
back for us; but every minute is an hour in here, and so it seems
like a very long time since he went away. Did you know he was
going?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he told me; but I didn't know when he and Herkuf left. I
was asleep. I am sure he must have gotten her out; otherwise he'd
have been back after us."</p>

<p>"Unless he was killed," suggested Brian. "Anyway we know he took
her out. That was what old Brulor was raving about."</p>

<p>"I mean out of the lake&mdash;to some place of safety. Sometimes
I think I'll go crazy if I don't know."</p>

<p>"We've got one nut here now," said Brian, nodding toward Atan
Thome. "We couldn't stand another. Anyway, wait until you've been
here as long as I have; then you'll really have an excuse to go
cuckoo."</p>

<p>"They're all clearing out of the throne room now," said d'Arnot.
"The period of meditation has come. I wonder what they meditate
about."</p>

<p>"Meditate, hell!" exclaimed Brian. "Ask the handmaidens."</p>

<p>Outside the temple the weary trio waited. Since the evening
before they had had neither food nor water, nor spoken a single
word; but now Herkuf cautiously moved to a spot opposite the window
but not too close to it. It was dark now, and there was little
danger that he would be seen from the inside. The throne room was
deserted except for the prisoners. He came back to Tarzan and Helen
and nodded that all was right; then he left the casket at Helen's
feet and motioned that she was to remain where she was. She was
very lonely after Tarzan and Herkuf left her.</p>

<p>This was the moment for which the two men had been waiting. What
did it hold for them? Carrying out the plan they had carefully laid
out in every detail, the two men each speared a fish; then, with
their quarry wriggling on their tridents, they went to the air
chamber. It was only a matter of a few moments before they had
passed through it and stood in the corridor leading to the ptomes'
room.</p>

<p>Beside them was another door opening into a passageway that led
to the throne room, avoiding the ptomes' room. Herkuf tried to open
it, but could not. He shrugged. There was nothing to do now but
make the attempt to pass through the room where the ptomes should
be sleeping. They prayed that they were sleeping. Cautiously,
Herkuf opened the door to that room and looked in; then he beckoned
Tarzan to follow him.</p>

<p>The entire success of their venture depended upon their reaching
the throne room unchallenged. They had almost succeeded, when a
ptome, awakening, sat up and looked at them. With their fish upon
their tridents, the two men continued on unconcernedly across the
room. The sleepy ptome, scarce awake, thought them two of his own
kind, and lay down to sleep again. Thus they came in safety to the
throne room, while outside, Helen waited in the loneliness of the
black water. She was almost happy, so certain was she that Tarzan
and Herkuf would succeed in liberating d'Arnot, Brian, and Lavac;
but then she was not aware of the figure in a white water suit that
was swimming down toward her from above and behind. Whatever it
was, it was evident that it had discovered her and was swimming
directly toward her.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Tarzan and Herkuf hurried directly to the cages, tossing their
fish to the floor. The excited prisoners watched them, for they had
never seen ptomes behave like this. Only d'Arnot really guessed who
they were. Seizing the bars in his powerful grasp, Tarzan released
them one after the other, cautioning them to silence with a
gesture; then he removed his helmet and told d'Arnot, Brian, and
Lavac to put on the three water suits that Herkuf carried.</p>

<p>"The rest of you," he said, "may be able to escape by the secret
passage at the end of the long corridor. Does any of you know where
to find it and open it?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied Akamen.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Atan Thome. "I learned from Akamen." As he spoke
he darted toward the altar and seized the casket containing The
Father of Diamonds, the accursed casket that had wrought such
havoc.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As Helen felt a hand seize her from behind, she turned to see
the strange figure in white confronting her; and her vision of a
successful termination of their venture faded. Once again she was
plunged into the depths of despair. She tried to wrench herself
free from the restraining hand, but she was helpless to escape. She
realized that she must not be taken now, for it might jeopardize
the lives and liberty of all her companions; she knew that they
would search for her and that the delay might prove fatal to them.
A sudden rage seized her; and, wheeling, she tried to drive her
trident into the heart of her captor. But the creature that held
her was alert and powerful. It wrenched the trident from her hands
and cast it aside; then it seized her by a wrist and swam up with
her toward the surface of the lake. The girl still struggled, but
she was helpless. To what new and unpredictable fate was she being
dragged? Who, now, might find or save her?</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>In the throne room of the temple, Tarzan and Herkuf saw all
their efforts, their risks, and their plans being brought to
nothing by the stupid avarice of three men, for as Atan Thome had
seized the casket, Lal Taask and Brian Gregory had leaped upon him;
and the three were fighting for the vast treasure for which they
had risked their lives. At sight of the casket in the hands of
another, Brian had forgotten all his fine resolutions; and cupidity
dominated him to the exclusion of all else.</p>

<p>Tarzan ran forward to quiet them, but they thought that he too
wanted the casket; so they fought down the throne room in an effort
to evade him; and then that happened which Tarzan had
feared&mdash;a door burst open and a horde of ptomes poured into
the throne room. They wore no encumbering water suits or helmets,
but they carried tridents and knives. Tarzan, Herkuf, and the
liberated prisoners waited to receive them. Brian and Lal Taask,
realizing that here was a matter of life and death, abandoned the
casket temporarily to assist in the attempt to repulse the ptomes;
but Atan Thome clung desperately to his treasure, and sneaking
stealthily behind the others he made for the corridor at the far
end of which was the entrance to the secret passageway that led to
the rocky hillside above Ashair.</p>

<p>It devolved upon Tarzan to bear the brunt of the battle with the
ptomes. Beside him, only Herkuf was armed; and the others fought
with their bare hands but with such desperation that the ptomes
fell back, while Tarzan speared them on his trident and tossed them
among their fellows.</p>

<p>It was upon this scene that Brulor burst, red of face and
trembling with rage; then above the yells and curses of the
battling men there rose his screaming voice as he stood behind the
empty altar.</p>

<p>"Curses!" he cried. "Curses upon the profaners of the temple!
Death to them! Death to him who hath raped the casket of The Father
of Diamonds! Summon the warriors of Ashair to avenge the
sacrilege!"</p>

<p>Herkuf saw his Nemesis standing defenseless before him, and he
saw red with the pent-up hatred of many years. He leaped to the
dais, and Brulor backed away, screaming for help; but the ptomes
who remained alive were too busily engaged now, for all the
prisoners who remained had armed themselves with the tridents and
knives of the ptomes who had fallen.</p>

<p>"Die, imposter!" screamed Herkuf. "For years I have lived in the
hope of this moment. Let the warriors of Ashair come, for now I may
die happy. The true god shall be avenged and the wrong you did me
wiped out in your blood."</p>

<p>Brulor dropped to his knees and begged for mercy; but there was
no mercy in the heart of Herkuf, as he raised his trident and drove
it with both hands deep into the heart of the terrified man
groveling before him. Thus died Brulor, the false god.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>A breathless ptome had staggered into the presence of Atka, who
sat among her nobles at a great banquet. "What is the meaning of
this?" demanded the Queen.</p>

<p>"Oh, Atka," cried the lesser priest. "The prisoners have been
liberated and they are killing the ptomes. Send many warriors at
once or they will all be slain."</p>

<p>Atka could not conceive of such a thing transpiring in the
throne room of the temple of Brulor, yet she realized that the man
was in earnest; so she gave orders that warriors were to be sent at
once to quell the disturbance.</p>

<p>"They will soon bring order," she said, and returned to her
feasting.</p>

<p>When the last ptome had fallen, Tarzan saw that Akamen was dead
and that Taask and Thome had disappeared with the casket. "Let them
go," he said. "The Father of Diamonds is bad luck."</p>

<p>"Not I," said Brian. "I shan't let them go. Why do you suppose I
have suffered in this hell-hole? Now I have a chance to reap my
reward; and when others steal it, you say, 'let them go.'"</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged. "Do as you please," he said; then he turned to
the others. "Come, we must get out of here before they get a chance
to send a lot of warriors down on top of us."</p>

<p>All four were now in their water suits, and were adjusting their
helmets as they made their way toward the corridor that led to the
water chamber. Brian had reached the end of the throne room. He was
the first to realize that the warriors of Ashair were already upon
them. Throwing himself to the floor, he feigned death as the
warriors rushed past him into the throne room.</p>

<p>When the others saw them, they thought that they were lost; but
Herkuf motioned them to follow him, as he hurried on toward the air
chamber. Tarzan had no idea what Herkuf planned to do. He only knew
that there would not be time to pass through the air chamber before
the warriors reached it and reversed the valves; then they would be
caught like rats in a trap. He had no intention of inviting any
such situation. He would turn his back to the wall and fight. Maybe
he could delay the warriors long enough for the others to escape.
That was what he thought; so he turned at the doorway leading from
the throne room, and took his stand. The others, glancing back, saw
what he was doing. D'Arnot took his place beside him, ignoring the
ape-man's attempt to motion him on. Herkuf ran rapidly toward the
air chamber. Lavac could have followed him to safety, but instead
he took his stand beside d'Arnot in the face of certain death.</p>

<p>While Herkuf hastened on toward the air chamber, the warriors
hesitated in the throne room, appalled by the bloody shambles that
met their astonished view and confused by the fact that the three
who faced them appeared to be ptomes of the temple; but at last,
seeing no other enemy, the officer in charge of Atka's warriors
ordered them forward; while out of sight, Herkuf worked feverishly
with the controls of the air chamber, spinning valve handles and
pulling levers.</p>

<p>Shouting now, the warriors came steadily down the length of the
throne room toward the forlorn hope making a last stand before
overwhelming odds; and the warriors looked for an easy victory. Nor
were they alone in this belief, which was shared by the three who
opposed them.</p>

<p>As the warriors closed upon the three, Tarzan met the leader in
a duel between spear and trident, while d'Arnot and Lavac stood
upon either side of him, determined, as was the ape-man, to sell
their lives dearly; and as they fought thus, there was a sudden
rush of water through the doorway behind them.</p>

<p>Herkuf had thought and acted quickly in the emergency that had
confronted them, taking advantage of the only means whereby he and
his companions could be saved from the vengeance of the warriors.
Throwing open both doors of the air chamber, he had let the waters
of Horus pour in to fill the temple.</p>

<p>Safe in their water suits, Tarzan, d'Arnot, and Lavac watched
the gushing torrent drive back their foes, as, cursing and yelling,
the warriors of Ashair sought to climb over one another in their
mad panic to escape the watery death Herkuf had loosed upon them
out of sacred Horus; but not one escaped as the water filled the
throne room and rose through the upper chambers of the temple. It
was a gruesome sight from which the three turned gladly at a signal
from Tarzan and followed him toward the air chamber, beyond which
he had left Helen waiting in the garden of the ptomes.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30">CHAPTER 30</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">UP and up through the waters of Horus, Helen was
dragged by the ghostly figure until, at last, they reached the
precipitous cliff, the summit of which forms the coast line near
Ashair. Here the creature dragged his captive into the mouth of a
dark cavern, a den of horror to the frightened girl.</p>

<p>Magra and Gregory had been held captives in the cavern for a
night and a day waiting for the return of the true god, Chon, who
was to decide their fate. They had not been ill treated; and they
had been given food, but always there was the feeling of menace. It
was in the air, in the strange garmenture of their captors, in
their whisperings and in their silences. It affected both Magra and
Gregory similarly, leaving them blue and despondent.</p>

<p>They were sitting beside the pool in the center of the cavern
almost exactly twenty-four hours after their capture, the
white-robed figures crouching around them, when there was a sudden
breaking of the still surface of the water and two grotesque diving
helmets appeared, one white, the other dark.</p>

<p>"The true god has returned," cried one of the priests.</p>

<p>"Now the strangers shall be judged, and punishment meted out to
them."</p>

<p>As the two figures emerged from the pool and removed their
helmets, Magra and Gregory gasped in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Helen!" cried the latter. "Thank God that you still live. I had
given you up for dead."</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed the girl. "What are you doing here? Tarzan
told us that you and Magra were prisoners in Thobos."</p>

<p>"We escaped," said Magra, "but perhaps we would have been better
off there. God only knows what we face here."</p>

<p>The figure in white that had emerged with Helen proved, when he
removed his helmet, to be an old man with a bushy white beard. He
looked at Helen in astonishment.</p>

<p>"A girl!" he cried. "Since when has false Brulor made ptomes of
girls?"</p>

<p>"I am not a ptome," replied Helen. "I was a prisoner of Brulor,
and adopted this method to escape."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she lies," said a priest.</p>

<p>"If these be enemies," said the old man, "I shall know when I
consult the oracle in the entrails of the man. If they be not
enemies, the girls shall become my handmaidens; but if they be,
they shall die as the man dies, on the altar of the true god Chon
and lost Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>"And if you find that we are not enemies," demanded Magra, "what
good will that do this man, whom you will have already killed? We
tell you that we are friends, meaning you no harm. Who are you to
say that we are not? Who are you to kill this good man?" Her voice
was vibrant with just anger.</p>

<p>"Silence, woman!" commanded a priest. "You are speaking to Chon,
the true god."</p>

<p>"If he were any sort of a god at all," snapped Magra, "he would
know that we are not enemies. He would not have to cut up an
innocent man and ask questions of his entrails."</p>

<p>"You do not understand," said Chon, indulgently. "If the man is
innocent and has told the truth, he will not die when I remove his
entrails. If he dies, that will prove his guilt."</p>

<p>Magra stamped her foot. "You are no god at all," she cried. "You
are just a wicked old sadist."</p>

<p>Several priests sprang forward threateningly, but Chon stopped
them with a gesture. "Do not harm her," he said; "she knows not
what she says. When we have taught her to know the truth, she will
be contrite. I am sure that she will become a worthy handmaiden,
for she has loyalty and great courage. Treat them all well while
they are among us waiting for the hour of inquisition."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Atan Thome fled upward along the secret passageway from the
temple of Brulor, hugging the precious casket to his breast; and
behind him came Lal Taask, his mind aflame with what was now the
one obsession of his life&mdash;the killing of his erstwhile
master. Secondary to that was his desire to possess the great
diamond which reposed in the jeweled casket. Ahead of him he could
hear the screams and jibberings of the madman, which served to
inflame his rage still further. And behind them both came Brian
Gregory, all his fine resolutions forgotten now that The Father of
Diamonds seemed almost within his grasp. He knew that he might have
to commit murder to obtain it; but that did not deter him in the
least, for his avarice, like that of many men, bordered almost upon
madness.</p>

<p>Out into the open and along the rocky hillside fled Atan Thome.
When Lal Taask reached the open, he saw his quarry scarce a hundred
yards ahead of him. Other eyes saw them both, the eyes of Ungo the
great bull ape, which, with his fellows, hunted for lizards among
the great rocks farther up the hillside. The sight of the two men,
the screaming of Atan Thome, excited him. He recalled that Tarzan
had told him that they must not attack men unless he were attacked;
but there had been no interdiction against joining in their play,
and this looked like play to Ungo. It was thus that playful apes
chased one another. Of course, Ungo was a little old for play,
being a sullen, surly old bull; but he was still imitative, and
what the tarmangani did, he desired to do. His fellows were imbued
with the same urge toward emulation.</p>

<p>As Brian Gregory came out into the open from the mouth of the
secret passageway, he saw the great apes, jabbering with
excitement, bounding down the hillside toward Atan Thome and the
pursuing Lal Taask. He saw the men stop and then turn and flee in
terror from the mighty beast-men charging down upon them.</p>

<p>For the moment Lal Taask discarded all thoughts of vengeance, as
the first law of Nature dominated and directed him; but Atan Thome
clung tenaciously to his precious casket. Ungo was delighted with
this new game, as he came bounding after the fleeing, screaming
Thome, whom he easily overtook. The man, thinking that death was
upon him, tried to beat off the ape with one hand while he clung
tightly to the casket with the other; that, he would not give up,
even in death. Killing, however, was not in the mind of the
anthropoid. It was the game in which he was interested; so he
snatched the casket from the screaming man as easily as one man
takes another's wife in Hollywood, and went bounding off, hoping
that some one would pursue him that the game might continue.</p>

<p>Lal Taask, running away, glanced back over his shoulder to see
his dream of riches irremediably shattered, leaving nothing now in
life for him but his hatred of Atan Thome and his desire for
vengeance. Furious with hate and thwarted avarice, he ran back to
Thome to wreak his final revenge, barehanded, upon the screaming
maniac. Lal Taask was choking and beating Atan Thome when Brian
Gregory reached them and dragged the infuriated Indian from his
victim.

<p>"What are you fools thinking of?" he demanded. "You're
making enough noise to attract every warrior in Ashair. I ought to
kill both of you; but right now we've got to forget all of that and
work together to escape, for we'll never see that casket
again."</p>

<p>Lal Taask knew that Gregory was right, but Atan Thome knew
nothing. He could only think of The Father of Diamonds which he had
lost, and impelled by a new maniacal impulse he suddenly broke away
from Brian and ran screaming in the direction in which Ungo had
disappeared with the casket. Lal Taask started after him, a curse
upon his lips; but Brian laid a detaining hand on the man's
arm.</p>

<p>"Let him go," he said; "he'll never get the casket from
Ungo&mdash;he'll probably get himself killed instead. That accursed
casket! So many have suffered and died because of it, and that poor
fool has gone mad."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is the most fortunate of all," said Lal Taask.</p>

<p>"I wish that I had never heard of it," continued Brian. "I have
lost my father and sister, and probably all of their friends are
dead because of my greed. A moment ago I would still have risked my
life for it, but the sight of that jibbering idiot has brought me
to my senses. I wouldn't have the thing now; I am not
superstitious, but I believe there is a curse on it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Lal Taask. "I do not care so much
about the casket as I did about killing that mad devil, but the
gods have willed it otherwise. I shall have to be content."</p>

<p>Ape-like, Ungo soon tired of his new bauble; and tossed the
casket carelessly to the ground, his thoughts reverting to the
matter of lizards and other dainty articles of food. He was about
to lead his tribe in search of sustenance when they were attracted
by loud screams. Instantly on guard, they stood watching the
approach of the mad Thome. Nervous, irritable beasts, it was a
question whether they would run away or attack, as the man dashed
among them and threw himself on the ground, clutching the casket to
his breast. For a moment they stood there, apparently undecided,
their little, red-rimmed eyes blazing; then they moved slowly away,
their menacing growls lost upon the poor maniac.</p>

<p>"It is mine! It is mine!" he shrieked. "I am rich! In all the
world there is none so rich as I!"</p>

<p>The great apes lumbered down the hillside, their short tempers
upset by the screaming and jabbering of Thome, until Ungo was about
to return and silence him forever. Just then he espied Brian and
Lal Taask and transferred his anger from Thome to them. They were
tarmangani, and suddenly Ungo wanted to kill all tarmangani.</p>

<p>Attracted by the growls of the anthropoids, the two men looked
up and saw the herd charging down the hill toward them.

<p>"Those beasts mean business," cried Brian. "It's time we got out
of here."</p>

<p>"There's a cave," said Lal Taask, pointing toward the cliff. "If
we can reach it ahead of them, we may be able to hide from them.
There's just a chance that they may be afraid to go into a dark
hole like that."</p>

<p>Running at top speed, the men reached the cave long before the
apes could overtake them. The interior was not entirely dark, and
they could see that the cave extended beyond the range of their
vision.</p>

<p>"We'd better go as far as we can," said Brian. "We'll be in a
devil of a fix if they do come in and follow us; but perhaps if
they can't see us at first, they may give up the chase."</p>

<p>"It may be a cul-de-sac," admitted Lal Taask, "but it was the
only chance we had; they'd have had us sure if we'd stayed in the
open."</p>

<p>They followed a dark corridor that ended suddenly in a
magnificent grotto, the splendor of which fairly took their breath
away.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Brian. "Did you ever see anything so
gorgeous?"</p>

<p>"It's magnificent," agreed Taask; "but, right now, quite
incidental&mdash;the apes are coming! I hear them growling."</p>

<p>"There's another cave in the other side of this cavern," said
Brian. "Let's try that."</p>

<p>"There is nothing else to try," returned Lal Taask.</p>

<p>As the two men disappeared into the dark opening in the rear of
the cavern, Ungo and his fellows streamed into the chamber they had
just quitted, unimpressed by its magnificence; and still holding to
the idea that dominated them for the moment&mdash;the chase. A bug,
a beetle, or a bat might distract their attention and launch them
upon a new adventure, for they could not hold long to a single
objective; but there were none of these, and so they searched the
grotto for their quarry. They circled the place, looking behind
stalagmites, sniffing here and there, wasting much time while the
two men followed a new corridor deeper into the heart of the
cliff.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31">CHAPTER 31</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TARZAN, d'Arnot, Herkuf, and Lavac hastened
through the air chamber out onto the bottom of the lake to the spot
where Helen had been left to await their return; but she was not
there, though the casket lay undisturbed where Herkuf had hidden
it. There was no clue to her whereabouts; and the men were at a
loss as to the direction in which they should search. They dared
not separate, and so they followed Tarzan as he wandered here and
there about the garden of the ptomes looking for some trace of the
missing girl. While they were thus engaged, the ape-man's attention
was attracted by the approach of several large marine animals the
upper portions of which closely resembled the head and neck of a
horse. There were six of them, and it was soon evident that they
meant to attack. That they were extremely dangerous, Herkuf knew
and the others soon realized, for they were as large as a man; and
each was armed with a long, sharp horn which grew upward from the
lower ends of their snouts.</p>

<p>Two of them attacked Tarzan, and one each the other three men,
while the sixth circled about as though awaiting an opening through
which it might take an antagonist unaware. Tarzan succeeded in
dispatching one of those attacking him; and d'Arnot seemed to be
experiencing no great difficulty with his. Lavac was hard pressed;
but when he saw the sixth sea horse gliding up behind d'Arnot to
impale him on its horn he turned to the rescue of his companion; as
he did so, exposing himself to the attack of the sea horse with
which he had been engaged.</p>

<p>It was an act of heroism on the part of the man who had wronged
d'Arnot, an act that made full amends but cost a brave life, for
the sea horse he had abandoned to come to d'Arnot's rescue plunged
its powerful horn between his shoulders. Thus died Lieutenant
Jacques Lavac.</p>

<p>As Tarzan thrust his trident into the heart of a second
antagonist, the remaining beasts swam away in defeat. D'Arnot
dropped to one knee beside Lavac and examined him as best he could;
then he stood up and shook his head. The others understood; and
sadly the three turned away and resumed their fruitless search,
wondering, possibly, which would be the next to die in this land of
danger and sudden death.</p>
<a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<p class="caption">Tarzan thrust his trident into the heart of a
second antagonist.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>At last, by signs, they agreed to abandon the search, for even
d'Arnot now felt certain that Helen must be dead; and, following
Herkuf, who had brought the casket with him, they scaled the steep
ascent to the lake shore, emerging at last a short distance below
Ashair.</p>

<p>D'Arnot was heart broken; Herkuf was filled with renewed hope,
for he knew what the casket contained and what it meant to him;
only Tarzan of the Apes was unmoved. "Brulor is dead," he said,
"and The Father of Diamonds stolen. I must return to Thobos as I
promised Herat."</p>

<p>"It will not be necessary, if you wish to remain here and search
for your other friends," said Herkuf. "I shall explain everything
to Herat, and for what you have done to restore this to him, he
will grant you any favor." He tapped the lid of the casket.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"In this is the true Father of Diamonds," replied Herkuf. "Many
years ago, Chon, the true god, was making his annual tour of Holy
Horus in a great galley. As was the custom, he carried The Father
of Diamonds with him. Queen Atka, jealous of Herat, attacked and
sank the galley; and Chon was drowned, while I was taken prisoner.
As you, Tarzan, will recall, when we found the wrecked galley at
the bottom of Horus, I recognized it and retrieved the casket that
had lain there so many years. Now I am sure that if we restore The
Father of Diamonds to Thobos, Herat will grant any request we may
make, for without The Father of Diamonds, Thobos has been without a
god all these years."</p>

<p>"You and Herkuf take the casket to Herat," said d'Arnot to
Tarzan. "I cannot leave here. Helen may live and may come ashore.
Somehow, I can't believe that she is dead."</p>

<p>"Take the casket to Herat, Herkuf," directed Tarzan. "I shall
remain here with d'Arnot. Tell Herat I'll come back to Thobos if he
wishes me to. I may come any way. We'll have to have a galley to
get out of Tuen-Baka."</p>

<p>Herkuf made good time to Thobos, nor was there any delay on the
part of Herat in granting him an audience when the king learned
that he claimed to be the long lost priest, Herkuf, and that he had
The Father of Diamonds in his possession; and it was not long after
his arrival at the city gate before Herkuf stood before the
king.</p>

<p>"Here, O Herat, is the sacred casket with The Father of
Diamonds. Had it not been for the man, Tarzan, it would never have
been recovered. I know that he and his friends are in grave peril,
for they are close to Ashair. Will you not send galleys and
warriors to rescue them?"</p>

<p>"With this," cried Herat, touching the casket, "our forces
cannot lose, for we shall again have the god upon our side." He
turned to one of his aides. "Let all the war galleys be prepared
and manned. We shall attack Ashair at once; and at last the
followers of the true god, Chon, shall prevail; and the traitors
and the wicked shall be destroyed. All that is lacking to our
complete triumph is the presence in the flesh of the holy
Chon."</p>

<p>"He will be with us in spirit," Herkuf reminded him.</p>

<p>So King Herat put out from Thobos with many war galleys, to
avenge the wrong that Atka had done his god and to succor the
strangers who had been instrumental in recovering the true Father
of Diamonds from the bottom of Holy Horus; and Queen Mentheb and
her ladies waved to them from the quay and wished them
Godspeed.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The true god, Chon, and his priests were gathered in the cavern
temple on the shore of Horus. The three prisoners stood below the
altar before the throne. At a word from Chon, several priests
seized Gregory, stripped his clothing from him, and threw him to
his back across the altar. Chon rose from his throne and stood
above him.</p>

<p>"From the entrails of this man let the oracle speak!" he cried.
He paused, and the priests intoned a weird chant, while Helen and
Magra looked on, horrified and helpless.</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried Helen. "You must not! My father has done nothing
to wrong you."</p>

<p>"Then why is he here in forbidden Tuen-Baka?" demanded Chon.</p>

<p>"I have told you time and again that we came here only in search
of my brother, who is lost."</p>

<p>"Why was your brother here?"</p>

<p>"He came with a scientific expedition of exploration," explained
the girl.</p>

<p>Chon shook his head. "It is death to all who enter forbidden
Tuen-Baka from the outer world," he replied. "But we know why they
really came. They came only for The Father of Diamonds. To us it is
the emblem of godhood; to them it is a priceless object of
incalculable value. There is nothing that they would not do to
possess it. They would defile our temples; they would murder us.
The fact that they could never succeed in obtaining it, does not
lessen their guilt."</p>

<p>"My father would not have done these things. He only wanted his
son back. He cares nothing for your diamond."</p>

<p>"There is no diamond where anyone can steal it," said Chon, "for
The Father of Diamonds lies at the bottom of Horus, lost forever.
If I am wrong in thinking that you came solely to steal it, you
shall go free. I am a just god."</p>

<p>"But you are wrong," urged Helen. "Won't you please take my word
for it? If you kill my father&mdash;oh, what good will it do you to
find out later that you are wrong?"</p>

<p>"You may speak the truth," replied Chon, "but you may lie. The
oracle will not lie. From the entrails of this man the oracle shall
speak. Priests of the true god, prepare the sacrifice!"</p>

<p>As the priests stretched Gregory across the altar and sprinkled
a liquid over him, the others commenced a solemn chant; and Helen
stretched her arms toward Chon.</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" she begged. "If you must have a sacrifice, take
me, not my father."</p>

<p>"Silence!" commanded Chon. "If you have lied, your time will
come. Soon we shall know."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>After Herkuf left them, Tarzan and d'Arnot started back toward
Ashair. They had no plan, nor much hope. If Helen lived, she might
be in Ashair. If she were dead, d'Arnot did not care what fate
befell him. As for Tarzan, he was seldom concerned beyond the
present moment. Suddenly he was alert. He pointed toward a cliff
ahead of them.</p>

<p>"One of Ungo's apes just went into that cave," he said. "Let's
take a look. The mangani are not ordinarily interested in caves.
Something unusual may have impelled that one to enter; we'll see
what."</p>

<p>"Oh, why bother?" queried d'Arnot. "We are not interested in
apes."</p>

<p>"I am interested in everything," replied the ape-man.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Brian and Taask stumbled through the dark corridor to burst
suddenly into the cavern temple upon the scene of Gregory's
impending sacrifice. At sight of them, Chon, the true god,
recoiled, dropping his knife hand at his side.</p>

<p>"In the name of Isis!" he shouted. "Who dares interrupt?"</p>

<p>"Brian!" cried Helen.</p>

<p>"Helen!" The man started across the room toward his sister; but
half a dozen priests sprang forward and seized him, and others
intercepted Helen as she tried to run to meet him.</p>

<p>"Who are these men?" demanded Chon.</p>

<p>"One is my brother," replied Helen. "Oh, Brian, tell him we
don't want their diamond."</p>

<p>"Save your breath, man," snapped Chon. "Only the oracle speaks
the truth! On with the sacrifice to truth!"</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>"Marvelous! Stupendous!" exclaimed d'Arnot, as he and Tarzan
entered the outer cavern of Chon's temple.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the ape-man, "but where is the mangani we saw
coming in here. I smell many of them. They have just been in this
cave. I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Have you no soul?" demanded d'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," smiled Tarzan, "but I have a brain.
Come on, let's get after those apes. I detect the scent spoor of
men, too. The stink of the apes is so strong that it almost hides
the other."</p>

<p>"I smell nothing," said d'Arnot, as he followed Tarzan toward
the opening at the far end of the cavern.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Chon was furious. "Let there be no more interruptions!" he
cried. "There are many questions to be asked of the oracle. Let
there be silence, too; if the oracle is to be heard, the man must
be opened in silence." Three times he raised and lowered the
sacrificial knife above the prostrate Gregory. "Speak, oracle, that
the truth may be known!"</p>

<p>As he placed the point of the knife at the lower extremity of
the victim's abdomen, the great apes, led by Ungo, streamed into
the cavern; and once again the rite of human sacrifice was
interrupted, as Chon and his priests looked, probably for the first
time, at these hairy beast-men.</p>

<p>The sight of so many tarmangani and the strange garments of the
priests confused and irritated the apes, with the result that they
attacked without provocation, forgetting the injunction of
Tarzan.</p>

<p>The surprised priests, who had been holding Gregory, released
him; and he slipped from the altar to stand leaning against it in a
state bordering on collapse. Chon raised his voice in impotent
curses and commands, while all the others tried to fight off the
attacking apes.</p>

<p>Zu-tho and Ga-un saw the two girls, and Zu-tho recalled that
Ungo had run off with a she tarmangani; so, impelled by imitative
desire, he seized Magra; and Ga-un, following the lead of his
fellow, gathered up Helen; then the two apes sought to escape from
the cavern with their prizes. Being confused, they chanced upon a
different corridor from that by which they had entered the cavern,
a corridor that rose steeply to a higher level.</p>

<p>Before anyone had been seriously injured by the apes, a
commanding voice rang out from the rear of the cavern. "Dan-do,
mangani!" it ordered in a tongue no other human knew, and the great
apes wheeled about to see Tarzan standing in the entrance to the
cavern. Even Chon ceased his cursing.</p>

<p>Tarzan surveyed the gathering in the temple. "We are all here
but Helen, Magra, and Lavac," he said, "and Lavac is dead."</p>

<p>"The girls were here a minute ago," said Gregory, as he hastily
donned his clothes without interruption by Chon or the priests.</p>

<p>"They must have hidden somewhere when the apes came," suggested
Brian.</p>

<p>"Helen was here!" gasped d'Arnot. "She is not dead?"</p>

<p>"She was here," Gregory assured him.</p>

<p>Brian was calling the girls loudly by name, but there was no
reply. Chon was trying to gather his wits together.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Zu-tho and Ga-un dragged their captives through a steep, short
corridor that ended in a third cavern with an arched opening that
looked out over Horus far below. Zu-tho held Magra by the hair,
while Ga-un dragged Helen along by one ankle. The apes stopped in
the middle of the cavern and looked about. They didn't know what to
do with their prizes now that they had them. They released their
holds upon the girls and jabbered at one another, and as they
jabbered, Helen and Magra backed slowly away from them toward the
opening overlooking the lake.</p>

<p>"These are Tarzan's shes," said Zu-tho. "Ungo and Tarzan will
kill us."</p>

<p>"Look at their hairless skins and little mouths," said Ga-un.
"They are hideous and no good. If we kill them and throw them into
the water, Tarzan and Ungo will never know that we took them."</p>

<p>Zu-tho thought that this was a good idea; so he advanced toward
the girls, and Ga-un followed him.</p>

<p>"I kill!" growled Zu-tho, in the language of the great apes.</p>

<p>"I kill!" snarled Ga-un.</p>

<p>"I believe the beasts are going to kill us," said Magra.</p>

<p>"I can almost hope so," replied Helen.</p>

<p>"We'll choose our own death," cried Magra. "Follow me!"</p>

<p>As Magra spoke, she turned and ran toward the opening
overlooking the lake; and Helen followed her. Zu-tho and Ga-un
charged to seize them; but they were too late; and the girls leaped
out into space over the waters of sacred Horus, far below; while
Asharian warriors in a passing galley watched.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32">CHAPTER 32</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the cavern temple, Chon had finally regained
control of his shattered nerves. He could curse again, and he did.
"Curses on all who defile the temple of Chon, the true god," he
cried.</p>

<p>"Chon!" exclaimed Tarzan. "But Chon is dead."</p>

<p>"Chon is not dead," replied the god. "I am Chon!"</p>

<p>"Chon was drowned when his galley was sunk, many years ago,"
insisted the ape-man.</p>

<p>"What do you know of all this?" demanded Chon.</p>

<p>"I know what Herkuf told me," replied Tarzan, "and he was a
priest of Chon."</p>

<p>"Herkuf!" exclaimed Chon. "Does he live?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Chon; he is on his way now to Thobos with the casket of
The Father of Diamonds which we found in the wreck of your galley
at the bottom of Horus."</p>

<p>"Thanks be to Isis!" exclaimed Chon. "When Atka's galleys
attacked us," he went on to explain, "I donned my water suit and
helmet and leaped overboard. Thus I escaped, and eventually I found
this cavern. Here I have lived for many years, watching my chance
to capture ptomes from the temple of the false Brulor&mdash;ptomes
who were still at heart faithful to the true god. If you have
spoken the truth you shall all go free with my blessing."</p>

<p>"First of all," said Tarzan, "we must find the girls. D'Arnot,
you come with me. Ungo, bring the mangani. The rest of you search
the main corridor," and so the survivors set out in search of the
missing girls, while Chon and his priests chanted a prayer for the
safe return of The Father of Diamonds.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As the Asharians saw the girls leap into the water, the officer
in charge of the galley directed that its course be changed; and it
was rowed rapidly in their direction. Helen and Magra saw it coming
and tried to find a place where they could gain the shore and
escape, for they knew that there would be only enemies in the
galley; but the precipitous cliff that fronted the lake at this
point made escape impossible. The galley overtook them, and they
were soon dragged into the craft.</p>

<p>"By Brulor!" exclaimed one of the Asharians. "This is the woman
who murdered Zytheb, keeper of the keys of the temple. Atka will
reward us well for this, for it was, doubtless, this woman who also
contrived the flooding of the temple and the drowning of all within
it."</p>

<p>Magra looked at Helen. "What more can happen to us?" she asked
wearily.</p>

<p>"This must be the absolute end," replied Helen, "and I hope it
is. I am very tired."</p>

<p>When they finally reached the city and were taken into Atka's
presence, the Queen scowled horribly at them and pointed at Helen.
"It was because of you," she cried, "that the temple was flooded
and all the priests and handmaidens drowned. I cannot think of any
punishment adequate to your crime, but I shall. Take them
away!"</p>

<p>In the dungeon in which they were chained, they sat looking at
one another, rather hopelessly. "I wonder how long it will take her
to think up a punishment to fit the crime," said Helen. "Too bad
she can't call in Gilbert and Sullivan."</p>

<p>Magra smiled. "I am glad you can joke," she said. "It makes it
much easier to endure."</p>

<p>"Why not joke while we can?" asked Helen. "We shall soon be
dead, and death is no joke."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>The mad Thome wandered aimlessly near the banks of Horus,
jabbering constantly of the things his great wealth would purchase
from the fleshpots of Europe. He had no idea where Europe was nor
how to reach it. He only recalled that it was a place where one
might satisfy the cravings of every appetite. He was so engrossed
in his mad dreaming that he did not see Taask approaching.</p>

<p>The Indian had been searching for Helen and had become separated
from Gregory and Brian, when suddenly he came upon Atan Thome and
saw the casket in his hands. Instantly he sloughed every thought
but one&mdash;to get possession of the accursed thing that held the
priceless diamond. Sneaking up on Thome, he leaped upon him. They
rolled upon the ground, biting, kicking, and clawing. Taask was a
younger, stronger man; and he soon wrenched the casket from Atan
Thome; and, leaping to his feet, started to run away with it.</p>

<p>Screaming at the top of his voice, the madman picked up a rock
and pursued him. There was murder in the eyes and heart of Atan
Thome as he chased his erstwhile servant across the rocky ground
above Ashair. Seeing that he could not overtake Lal Taask, Atan
Thome hurled the rock at him; and by chance it struck the fleeing
man full on the head, knocking him to the ground; and his mad
pursuer was soon upon him. Recovering the rock, Thome pounded with
all his strength upon the skull of Lal Taask until it was but a
mass of splintered bone and brains; then, clutching the casket to
his breast and screaming a challenge to the world, he fled.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Following the scent spoor of the two girls, Tarzan and d'Arnot
found themselves in a third cavern of the temple, facing two bull
apes.</p>

<p>"Where are the shes?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>Zu-tho pointed toward the lake. "They jump," he said, "in
water."</p>

<p>Tarzan looked out to see the Asharian galley rowing in the
direction of the city; then he and d'Arnot returned to the throne
room and related what they had seen. "I am going to take the apes
to Ashair," he said. "With their help, I may be able to bring the
girls out."</p>

<p>"My priests shall go with you," said Chon, and the party soon
set out from the temple, the men armed with tridents and knives,
the apes with their terrible fangs and their mighty muscles.</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>An excited warrior rushed into the throne room of Atka and knelt
before her. "O Queen!" he cried, "a great fleet of war galleys is
approaching from Thobos."</p>

<p>Atka turned to one of her aides. "Order out the entire fleet,"
she directed. "This day we shall destroy the power of Thobos
forever."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>As the Asharian horde embarked at the quay, Tarzan of the Apes
looked down from the hillside above the city and watched them; and
in the distance, approaching Ashair, he saw the war fleet of Herat
approaching.</p>

<p>"Now is the time," he said to his motley followers, "we shall
have fewer warriors to oppose us."</p>

<p>"We cannot fail," said a priest, "for Chon has blessed us."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the Lord of the Jungle led his little band
over the wall into The Forbidden City. It was a bold, rash
venture&mdash;at best a forlorn hope that thus they might succeed
in saving Helen and Magra from death or an even more horrible fate.
Success or failure&mdash;which would it be?</p>

<p>As the two fleets met amid the war cries of the opposing
warriors, quarter was neither asked nor given, for each side felt
that this was to be a battle to the death that would determine for
all time which city was to rule the valley of Tuen-Baka. And while
this bloody battle was being waged on sacred Horus, another battle
was taking place before the gates of Atka's palace, as Tarzan
sought to lead his little band into the presence of the Queen. It
was Atka he sought, for he knew that with Atka in his power he
could force the Asharians to give up their prisoners&mdash;if they
still lived.</p>

<p>Finally they overcame the resistance at the gates, and Tarzan
forced his way at the head of his company into the throne room of
the Queen.</p>

<p>"I have come for the two women," he said. "Release them to me,
and we will go away; refuse, and we shall go away; but we shall
take you with us."</p>

<p>Atka sat in silence for a few minutes, her eyes fixed upon
Tarzan. She was trembling slightly and appeared to be making an
effort to gain control over her emotions. At last she spoke. "You
have won," she said. "The women shall be fetched at once."</p>

<p>As Tarzan and his triumphant band led the girls from Ashair,
Magra clung to his arm. "Oh, Tarzan," she whispered, "I knew that
you would come. My love told me that you would."</p>

<p>The ape-man shook his head impatiently. "I do not like such
talk," he said; "it is not for us. Leave that to Helen and
Paul."</p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Herat, victorious, entered Ashair, the first king of Thobos to
set foot within The Forbidden City. From the opening in the cavern
of Chon, that looked out over the lake, Chon had seen the Asharian
fleet demolished and the victorious Thobotian fleet steer toward
Ashair; and when Tarzan and his party returned and the ape-man
learned of the successful outcome of Herat's expedition, he had
Chon send a messenger to Ashair to summon Herat, in the true god's
name, to the temple.</p>

<p>When the greetings between Herat and Chon were concluded, the
true god blessed the entire party, giving credit to the strangers
for their part in the restoration of The Father of Diamonds to the
temple of Chon and the successful reuniting of the King and the
true god; then Herat, to demonstrate his own appreciation, offered
to outfit the Gregory party and furnish them with galleys to take
them out of Tuen-Baka. At last, their troubles seemed over.</p>

<p>"We are reunited and safe," said Gregory, "and, above all
others, we owe it to you, Tarzan. How can we ever repay you?"</p>

<p>Gregory was interrupted by maniacal screams, as two of Herat's
warriors who had been among the guard left at the outer entrance to
the caverns, entered the temple, dragging Atan Thome between
them.</p>

<p>"This man has a casket," reported one of the warriors, "which he
says contains The Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>"The true Father of Diamonds, which Herkuf just brought with him
from Thobos," said Chon, "rests here in its casket on the altar
before me. There cannot be two. Let us have a look at what the man
has in his casket."</p>

<p>"No!" shrieked Atan Thome. "Don't open it! It is mine, and I
have been waiting to open it in Paris. I shall buy all of Paris
with it and be king of France!"</p>

<p>"Silence, mortal!" commanded Chon; then, very deliberately, he
opened the casket, while the trembling Thome stared with mad eyes
at the contents&mdash;a small lump of coal.</p>

<p>At sight of it, realizing what it was, Atan Thome screamed,
clutched his heart, and fell dead at the foot of the altar of the
true god.</p>

<p>"For this false and accursed thing," exclaimed Brian Gregory,
"we have all suffered, and many have died; yet the irony of it is
that it is, in truth, The Father of Diamonds."</p>

<p>"Men are strange beasts," said Tarzan.</p>
