  <h2><a name="c1"
     id="c1"></a>I. &mdash; THE PUZZLE LOCK</h2>

  <p class="first">I DO not remember what was the occasion of my dining with
  Thorndyke at Giamborini's on the particular evening that is now in my mind.
  Doubtless, some piece of work completed had seemed to justify the modest
  festival. At any rate, there we were, seated at a somewhat retired table,
  selected by Thorndyke, with our backs to the large window through which the
  late June sunlight streamed. We had made our preliminary arrangements,
  including a bottle of Barsac, and were inspecting dubiously a collection of
  semi-edible hors d'oeuvres, when a man entered and took possession of a table
  just in front of ours, which had apparently been reserved for him, since he
  walked directly to it and drew away the single chair that had been set aslant
  against it.</p>

  <p>I watched with amused interest his methodical procedure, for he was
  clearly a man who took his dinner seriously. A regular customer, too, I
  judged by the waiter's manner and the reserved table with its single chair.
  But the man himself interested me. He was out of the common and there was a
  suggestion of character, with perhaps a spice of oddity, in his appearance.
  He appeared to be about sixty years of age, small and spare, with a
  much-wrinkled, mobile and rather whimsical face, surmounted by a crop of
  white, upstanding hair. From his waistcoat pocket protruded the ends of a
  fountain-pen, a pencil and a miniature electric torch such as surgeons use; a
  silver-mounted Coddington lens hung from his watch-guard and the middle
  finger of his left hand bore the largest seal ring that I have ever seen.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, who had been following my glance, "what do you
  make of him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know," I replied. "The Coddington suggests a naturalist or
  a scientist of some kind, but that blatant ring doesn't. Perhaps he is an
  antiquary or a numismatist or even a philatelist. He deals with small objects
  of some kind."</p>

  <p>At this moment a man who had just entered strode up to our friend's table
  and held out his hand, which the other shook, with no great enthusiasm, as I
  thought. Then the newcomer fetched a chair, and setting it by the table,
  seated himself and picked up the menu card, while the other observed him with
  a shade of disapproval. I judged that he would rather have dined alone, and
  that the personality of the new arrival&mdash;a flashy, bustling, obtrusive
  type of man&mdash;did not commend him.</p>

  <p>From this couple my eye was attracted to a tall man who had halted near
  the door and stood looking about the room as if seeking someone. Suddenly he
  spied an empty, single table, and, bearing down on it, seated himself and
  began anxiously to study the menu under the supervision of a waiter. I
  glanced at him with slight disfavour. One makes allowances for the exuberance
  of youth, but when a middle-aged man presents the combination of
  heavily-greased hair parted in the middle, a waxed moustache of a
  suspiciously intense black, a pointed imperial and a single eye-glass,
  evidently ornamental in function, one views him with less tolerance. However,
  his get-up was not my concern, whereas my dinner was, and I had given this my
  undivided attention for some minutes when I heard Thorndyke emit a soft
  chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Not bad," he remarked, setting down his glass.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I agreed, "for a restaurant wine."</p>

  <p>"I was not alluding to the wine," said he "but to our friend Badger."</p>

  <p>"The inspector!" I exclaimed. "He isn't here, is he? I don't see him."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you say that, Jervis," said he. "It is a better effort
  than I thought. Still, he might manage his properties a little better. That
  is the second time his eye-glass has been in the soup."</p>

  <p>Following, the direction of his glance, I observed the man with the waxed
  moustache furtively wiping his eye-glass; and the temporary absence of the
  monocular grimace enabled me to note a resemblance to the familiar features
  of the detective officer.</p>

  <p>"If you say that is Badger, I suppose it is," said I. "He is certainly a
  little like our friend. But I shouldn't have recognised him."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I should," said Thorndyke, "but for the little
  unconscious tricks of movement. You know the habit he has of stroking the
  back of his head, and of opening his mouth and scratching the side of his
  chin. I saw him do it just now. He had forgotten his imperial until he
  touched it, and then the sudden arrest of movement was very striking. It
  doesn't do to forget a false beard."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what his game is," said I. "The disguise suggests that he is on
  the look-out for somebody who might know him; but apparently that somebody
  has not turned up yet. At any rate, he doesn't seem to be watching anybody in
  particular."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke. "But there is somebody whom he seems rather to avoid
  watching. Those two men at the table in front of ours are in his direct line
  of vision, but he hasn't looked at them once since he sat down, though I
  noticed that he gave them one quick glance before he selected his table. I
  wonder if he has observed us. Probably not, as we have the strong light of
  the window behind us and his attention is otherwise occupied."</p>

  <p>I looked at the two men and from them to the detective, and I judged that
  my friend was right. On the inspector's table was a good-sized fern in an
  ornamental pot, and this he had moved so that it was directly between him and
  the two strangers, to whom he must have been practically invisible; and now I
  could see that he did, in fact, steal an occasional glance at them over the
  edge of the menu card. Moreover, as their meal drew to an end, he hastily
  finished his own and beckoned to the waiter to bring the bill.</p>

  <p>"We may as well wait and see them off," said Thorndyke, who had already
  settled our account. "Badger always interests me. He is so ingenious and he
  has such shockingly bad luck."</p>

  <p>We had not long to wait. The two men rose from the table and walked slowly
  to the door, where they paused to light their cigars before going out. Then
  Badger rose, with his back towards them and his eyes on the mirror opposite;
  and as they went out, he snatched up his hat and stick and followed.
  Thorndyke looked at me inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Do we indulge in the pleasures of the chase?" he asked, and as I replied
  in the affirmative, we, too, made our way out and started in the wake of the
  inspector.</p>

  <p>As we followed Badger at a discreet distance, we caught an occasional
  glimpse of the quarry ahead, whose proceedings evidently caused the inspector
  some embarrassment, for they had a way of stopping suddenly to elaborate some
  point that they were discussing, whereby it became necessary for the
  detective to drop farther in the rear than was quite safe, in view of the
  rather crowded state of the pavement. On one of these occasions, when the
  older man was apparently delivering himself of some excruciating joke, they
  both turned suddenly and looked back, the joker pointing to some object on
  the opposite side of the road. Several people turned to see what was being
  pointed at, and, of course, the inspector had to turn, too, to avoid being
  recognised. At this moment the two men popped into an entry, and when the
  inspector once more turned they were gone.</p>

  <p>As soon as he missed them, Badger started forward almost at a run, and
  presently halted at the large entry of the Celestial Bank Chambers, into
  which he peered eagerly. Then, apparently sighting his quarry, he darted in,
  and we quickened our pace and followed. Half-way down the long hall we saw
  him standing at the door of a lift, frantically pressing the call-button.</p>

  <p>"Poor Badger!" chuckled Thorndyke, as we walked past him unobserved. "His
  usual luck! He will hardly run them to earth now in this enormous building.
  We may as well go through to the Blenheim Street entrance."</p>

  <p>We pursued our way along the winding corridor and were close to the
  entrance when I noticed two men coming down the staircase that led to the
  ball.</p>

  <p>"By Jingo! Here they are!" I exclaimed. "Shall we run back and give Badger
  the tip?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke hesitated. But it was too late. A taxi had just driven up and
  was discharging its fare. The younger man, catching the driver's eye, ran out
  and seized the door-handle; and when his companion had entered the cab, he
  gave an address to the driver, and, stepping in quickly, slammed the door. As
  the cab moved off, Thorndyke pulled out his notebook and pencil and jotted
  down the number of the vehicle. Then we turned and retraced our steps; but
  when we reached the lift-door, the inspector had disappeared. Presumably,
  like the incomparable Tom Bowling, he had gone aloft.</p>

  <p>"We must give it up, Jervis," said Thorndyke. "I will send him anonymously
  the number of the cab, and that is all we can do. But I am sorry for
  Badger."</p>

  <p>With this we dismissed the incident from our minds&mdash;at least, I did;
  assuming that I had seen the last of the two strangers. Little did I suspect
  how soon and under what strange and tragic circumstances I should meet with
  them again!</p>

  <p>It was about a week later that we received a visit from our old friend,
  Superintendent Miller of the Criminal Investigation Department. The passing
  years had put us on a footing of mutual trust and esteem, and the capable,
  straightforward detective officer was always a welcome visitor.</p>

  <p>"I've just dropped in," said Miller, cutting off the end of the inevitable
  cigar, "to tell you about a rather queer case that we've got in hand. I know
  you are always interested in queer cases."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled blandly. He had heard that kind of preamble before, and
  he knew, as did I, that when Miller became communicative we could safely
  infer that the Millerian bark was in shoal water.</p>

  <p>"It is a case," the superintendent continued, "of a very special brand of
  crook. Actually there is a gang, but it is the managing director that we have
  particularly got our eye on."</p>

  <p>"Is he a regular 'habitual,' then?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Miller, "as to that, I can't positively say. The fact is
  that we haven't actually seen the man to be sure of him."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Thorndyke, with a grim smile. "You mean to say that you have
  got your eye on the place where he isn't."</p>

  <p>"At the present moment," Miller admitted, "that is the literal fact. We
  have lost sight of the man we suspected, but we hope to pick him up again
  presently. We want him badly, and his pals too. It is probably quite a small
  gang, but they are mighty fly; a lot too smart to be at large. And they'll
  take some catching, for there is someone running the concern with a good deal
  more brains than crooks usually have."</p>

  <p>"What is their lay?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Burglary," he replied. "Jewels and plate, but principally jewels; and the
  special feature of their work is that the swag disappears completely every
  time. None of the stuff has ever been traced. That is what drew our attention
  to them. After each robbery we made a round of all the fences, but there was
  not a sign. The stuff seemed to have vanished into smoke. Now that is very
  awkward. If you never see the men and you can't trace the stuff, where are
  you? You've got nothing to go on."</p>

  <p>"But you seem to have got a clue of some kind." I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. There isn't a lot in it; but it seemed worth following up. One of
  our men happened to travel down to Colchester with a certain man, and when he
  came back two days later, he noticed this same man on the platform at
  Colchester and saw him get out at Liverpool Street. In the interval there had
  been a jewel robbery at Colchester. Then there was a robbery at Southampton,
  and our man went at once to Waterloo and saw all the trains in. On the second
  day, behold! the Colchester sportsman turns up at the barrier, so our man,
  who had a special taxi waiting, managed to track him home and afterwards got
  some particulars about him. He is a chap named Shemmonds; belongs to a firm
  of outside brokers. But nobody seems to know much about him and he doesn't
  put in much time at the office.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Badger took him over and shadowed him for a day or two, but
  just as things were looking interesting, he slipped off the hook. Badger
  followed him to a restaurant, and, through the glass door, saw him go up to
  an elderly man at a table and shake hands with him. Then he took a chair at
  the table himself, so Badger popped in and took a seat near them where he
  could keep them in view. They went out together and Badger followed them, but
  he lost them in the Celestial Bank Chambers. They went up in the lift just
  before he could get to the door and that was the last he saw of them. But we
  have ascertained that they left the building in a taxi and that the taxi set
  them down at Great Turnstile."</p>

  <p>"It was rather smart of you to trace the cab," Thorndyke remarked.</p>

  <p>"You've got to keep your eyes skinned in our line of business," said
  Miller. "But now we come to the real twister. From the time those two men
  went down Great Turnstile, nobody has set eyes on either of them. They seem
  to have vanished into thin air."</p>

  <p>"You found out who the other man was, then?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The restaurant manager knew him; an old chap named Luttrell. And we
  knew him, too, because he has a thumping burglary insurance, and when he goes
  out of town he notifies his company, and they make arrangements with us to
  have the premises watched."</p>

  <p>"What is Luttrell?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, he is a bit of a mug, I should say, at least that's his character
  in the trade. Goes in for being a dealer in jewels and antiques, but he'll
  buy anything&mdash;furniture, pictures, plate, any blooming thing. Does it
  for a hobby, the regular dealers say. Likes the sport of bidding at the
  sales. But the knock-out men hate him; never know what he's going to do. Must
  have private means, for though he doesn't often drop money, he can't make
  much. He's no salesman. It is the buying that he seems to like. But he is a
  regular character, full of cranks and oddities. His rooms in Thavies Inn look
  like the British Museum gone mad. He has got electric alarms from all the
  doors up to his bedroom and the strong-room in his office is fitted with a
  puzzle lock instead of keys."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem very safe," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is," said Miller. "This one has fifteen alphabets. One of our men has
  calculated that it has about forty billion changes. No one is going to work
  that out, and there are no keys to get lost. But it is that strong-room that
  is worrying us, as well as the old joker himself. The Lord knows how much
  valuable stuff there is in it. What we are afraid of is that Shemmonds may
  have made away with the old chap and be lying low, waiting to swoop down on
  that strong-room."</p>

  <p>"But you said that Luttrell goes away sometimes," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but then he always notifies his insurance company and he seals up
  his strong-room with a tape round the door-handle and a great seal on the
  door-post. This time he hasn't notified the company and the door isn't
  sealed. There's a seal on the door-post&mdash;left from last time, I
  expect&mdash;but only the cut ends of tape. I got the caretaker to let me see
  the place this morning; and, by the way, doctor, I have taken a leaf out of
  your book. I always carry a bit of squeezing wax in my pocket now and a
  little box of French chalk. Very handy they are, too. As I had 'em with me
  this morning, I took a squeeze of the seal. May want it presently for
  identification."</p>

  <p>He brought out of his pocket a small tin box from which he carefully
  extracted an object wrapped in tissue paper. When the paper had been tenderly
  removed there was revealed a lump of moulding wax, one side of which was
  flattened and bore a sunk design.</p>

  <p>"It's quite a good squeeze," said Miller, handing it to Thorndyke. "I
  dusted the seal with French chalk so that the wax shouldn't stick to it."</p>

  <p>My colleague examined the "squeeze" through his lens, and passing it and
  the lens to me, asked: "Has this been photographed, Miller?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply, "but it ought to be before it gets damaged."</p>

  <p>"It ought, certainly," said Thorndyke, "if you value it. Shall I get
  Polton to do it now?"</p>

  <p>The superintendent accepted the offer gratefully and Thorndyke accordingly
  took the squeeze up to the laboratory, where he left it for our assistant to
  deal with. When he returned, Miller remarked: "It is a baffling case, this.
  Now that Shemmonds has dropped out of sight, there is nothing to go on and
  nothing to do but wait for something else to happen; another burglary or an
  attempt on the strong-room."</p>

  <p>"Is it clear that the strong-room has not been opened?" asked
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," replied Miller. "That's part of the trouble. Luttrell has
  disappeared and he may be dead. If he is, Shemmonds will probably have been
  through his pockets. Of course there is no strong-room key. That is one of
  the advantages of a puzzle lock. But it is quite possible that Luttrell may
  have kept a note of the combination and carried it about him. It would have
  been risky to trust entirely to memory. And he would have had the keys of the
  office about him. Any one who had those could have slipped in during business
  hours without much difficulty. Luttrell's premises are empty, but there are
  people in and out all day going to the other offices. Our man can't follow
  them all in. I suppose you can't make any suggestion, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't," answered Thorndyke. "The case is so very much in
  the air. There is nothing against Shemmonds but bare suspicion. He has
  disappeared only in the sense that you have lost sight of him, and the same
  is true of Luttrell&mdash;though there is an abnormal element in his case.
  Still, you could hardly get a search-warrant on the facts that are known at
  present."</p>

  <p>"No," Miller agreed, "they certainly would not authorise us to break open
  the strong-room, and nothing short of that would be much use."</p>

  <p>Here Polton made his appearance with the wax squeeze in a neat little box
  such as jewellers use.</p>

  <p>"I've got two enlarged negatives," said he; "nice clear ones. How many
  prints shall I make for Mr. Miller?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, one will do, Mr. Polton," said the superintendent. "If I want any
  more I'll ask you." He took up the little box, and, slipping it in his
  pocket, rose to depart. "I'll let you know, doctor, how the case goes on, and
  perhaps you wouldn't mind turning it over a bit in the interval. Something
  might occur to you."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke promised to think over the case, and when we had seen the
  superintendent launched down the stairs, we followed Polton up to the
  laboratory, where we each picked up one of the negatives and examined it
  against the light. I had already identified the seal by its shape&mdash;a
  vesica piscis or boat-shape&mdash;with the one that I had seen on Mr.
  Luttrell's finger. Now, in the photograph, enlarged three diameters, I could
  clearly make out the details. The design was distinctive and curious rather
  than elegant. The two triangular spaces at the ends were occupied
  respectively by a memento mori and a winged hour-glass and the central
  portion was filled by a long inscription in Roman capitals, of which I could
  at first make nothing.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose this is some kind of cryptogram?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke replied. "I imagine the words were run together merely to
  economise space. This is what I make of it."</p>

  <p>He held the negative in his left hand, and with his right wrote down in
  pencil on a slip of paper the following four lines of doggerel verse:</p>
  <br>

  <p class="verse">"Eheu alas how fast the dam fugaces<br>
  Labuntur anni especially in the cases<br>
  Of poor old blokes like you and me Posthumus<br>
  Who only wait for vermes to consume us."</p>
<br>

  <p>"Well," I exclaimed, "it is a choice specimen; one of old Luttrell's merry
  conceited jests, I take it. But the joke was hardly worth the labour of
  engraving on a seal."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly a rather mild jest," Thorndyke admitted. "But there may
  be something more in it than meets the eye."</p>

  <p>He looked at the inscription reflectively and appeared to read it through
  once or twice. Then he replaced the negative in the drying rack, and, picking
  up the paper, slipped it into his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see," said I, "why Miller brought this case to us or what
  he wants you to think over. In fact, I don't see that there is a case at
  all."</p>

  <p>"It is a very shadowy case," Thorndyke admitted. "Miller has done a good
  deal of guessing, and so has Badger; and it may easily turn out that they
  have found a mare's nest. Nevertheless there is something to think
  about."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Jervis, you saw the men; you saw how they behaved; you have heard
  Miller's story and you have seen Mr. Luttrell's seal. Put all those data
  together and you have the material for some very interesting speculation, to
  say the least. You might even carry it beyond speculation."</p>

  <p>I did not pursue the subject, for I knew that when Thorndyke used the word
  "speculation," nothing would induce him to commit himself to an opinion. But
  later, bearing in mind the attention that he had seemed to bestow on Mr.
  Luttrell's schoolboy verses, I got a print from the negative and studied the
  foolish lines exhaustively. But if it had any hidden meaning&mdash;and I
  could imagine no reason for supposing that it had&mdash;that meaning remained
  hidden; and the only conclusion at which I could arrive was that a man of
  Luttrell's age might have known better than to write such nonsense.</p>

  <p>The superintendent did not leave the matter long in suspense. Three days
  later he paid us another visit. and half-apologetically reopened the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"I am ashamed to come badgering you like this," he said, "but I can't get
  this case out of my head. I've a feeling that we ought to get a move of some
  kind on. And, by the way&mdash;though that is nothing to do with
  it&mdash;I've copied out the stuff on that seal and I can't make any sense of
  it. What the deuce are fugaces? I suppose 'vermes' are worms, though I don't
  see why he spelt it that way."</p>

  <p>"The verses," said Thorndyke, "are apparently a travesty of a Latin poem;
  one of the odes of Horace which begins:</p>

  <p class="verse">"'Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume, Labuntur anni,'</p>

  <p class="first">"which means, in effect, 'Alas! Postume, the flying years slip by.'"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "any fool knows that&mdash;any middle-aged fool, at
  any rate. No need to put it into Latin. However, it's of no consequence. To
  return to this case; I've got an authority to look over Luttrell's
  premises&mdash;not to pull anything about, you know, just to look round. I
  called in on my way here to let the caretaker know that I should be coming in
  later. I thought that perhaps you might like to come with me. I wish you
  would, doctor. You've got such a knack of spotting things that other people
  overlook."</p>

  <p>He looked wistfully at Thorndyke, and as the latter was considering the
  proposal, he added: "The caretaker mentioned a rather odd circumstance. It
  seems that he keeps an eye on the electric meters in the building and that he
  has noticed a leakage of current in Mr. Luttrell's. It is only a small leak;
  about thirty watts an hour. But he can't account for it in any way. He has
  been right through the premises to see if any lamp has been left on in any of
  the rooms. But all the switches are off everywhere, and it can't be a short
  circuit. Funny, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>It was certainly odd, but there seemed to me nothing in it to account for
  the expression of suddenly awakened interest that I detected in Thorndyke's
  face. However, it evidently had some special significance for him, for he
  asked almost eagerly "When are you making your inspection?"</p>

  <p>"I am going there now," replied Miller, and he added coaxingly, "Couldn't
  you manage to run round with me?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke stood up. "Very well," said he. "Let us go together. You may as
  well come, too, Jervis, if you can spare an hour."</p>

  <p>I agreed readily, for my colleague's hardly disguised interest in the
  inspection suggested a definite problem in his mind; and we at once issued
  forth and made our way by Mitre Court and Fetter Lane to the abode of the
  missing dealer, an old-fashioned house near the end of Thavies Inn.</p>

  <p>"I've been over the premises once," said Miller, as the caretaker appeared
  with the keys, "and I think we had better begin the regular inspection with
  the offices. We can examine the stores and living-rooms afterwards."</p>

  <p>We accordingly entered the outer office, and as this was little more than
  a waiting-room, we passed through into the private office, which had the
  appearance of having been used also as a sitting-room or study. It was
  furnished with an easy-chair, a range of book-shelves and a handsome bureau
  book-case, while in the end wall was the massive iron door of the
  strong-room. On this, as the chief object of interest, we all bore down, and
  the superintendent expounded its peculiarities.</p>

  <p>"It is quite a good idea," said he, "this letter-lock. There's no
  keyhole&mdash;though a safe-lock is pretty hopeless to pick even if there was
  a keyhole&mdash;and no keys to get lost. As to guessing what the 'open
  sesame' may be&mdash;well, just look at it. You could spend a lifetime on it
  and be no forrader."</p>

  <p>The puzzle lock was contained in the solid iron door post, through a slot
  in which a row of fifteen A's seemed to grin defiance on the would-be
  safe-robber. I put my finger on the milled edges of one or two of the letters
  and rotated the discs, noticing how easily and smoothly they turned.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "it's no use fumbling with that. I'm just going to
  have a look through his ledger and see who his customers were. The book-case
  is unlocked. I tried it last time. And we'd better leave this as we found
  it."</p>

  <p>He put back the letters that I had moved, and turned away to explore the
  book-case; and as the letter-lock appeared to present nothing but an
  insoluble riddle, I followed him, leaving Thorndyke earnestly gazing at the
  meaningless row of letters.</p>

  <p>The superintendent glanced back at him with an indulgent smile.</p>

  <p>"The doctor is going to work out the combination," he chuckled. "Well,
  well. There are only forty billion changes and he's a young man for his
  age."</p>

  <p>With this encouraging comment, he opened the glass door of the book-case,
  and reaching down the ledger, laid it on the desk-like slope of the
  bureau.</p>

  <p>"It is a poor chance," said he, opening the ledger at the index, "but some
  of these people may be able to give us a hint where to look for Mr. Luttrell,
  and it is worth while to know what sort of business he did."</p>

  <p>He ran his finger down the list of names and had just turned to the
  account of one of the customers when we were startled by a loud click from
  the direction of the strong-room. We both turned sharply and beheld Thorndyke
  grasping the handle of the strong-room door, and I saw with amazement that
  the door was now slightly ajar.</p>

  <p>"God!" exclaimed Miller, shutting the ledger and starting forward, "he's
  got it open!" He strode over to the door, and directing an eager look at the
  indicator of the lock, burst into a laugh. "Well, I'm hanged!" he exclaimed.
  "Why, it was unlocked all the time! To think that none of us had the sense to
  tug the handle! But isn't it just like old Luttrell to have a fool's answer
  like that to the blessed puzzle!"</p>

  <p>I looked at the indicator, not a little astonished to observe the row of
  fifteen A's, which apparently formed the key combination. It may have been a
  very amusing joke on Mr. Luttrell's part, but it did not look very secure.
  Thorndyke regarded us with an inscrutable glance and still grasped the
  handle, holding the door a bare half-inch open.</p>

  <p>"There is something pushing against the door," said he. "Shall I open
  it?</p>

  <p>"May as well have a look at the inside," replied Miller. Thereupon
  Thorndyke released the handle and quickly stepped aside. The door swung
  slowly open and the dead body of a man fell out into the room and rolled over
  on to its back.</p>

  <p>"Mercy on us!" gasped Miller, springing back hastily and staring with
  horror and amazement at the grim apparition. "That is not Luttrell." Then,
  suddenly starting forward and stooping over the dead man, he exclaimed "Why,
  it is Shemmonds. So that is where he disappeared to. I wonder what became of
  Luttrell?"</p>

  <p>"There is somebody else in the strong-room," said Thorndyke; and now,
  peering in through the doorway, I perceived a dim light, which seemed to come
  from a hidden recess, and by which I could see a pair of feet projecting
  round the corner. In a moment Miller had sprung in, and I followed. The
  strong-room was L shaped in plan, the arm of the L formed by a narrow passage
  at right angles to the main room. At the end of this a single small electric
  bulb was burning, the light of which showed the body of an elderly man
  stretched on the floor of the passage. I recognised him instantly in spite of
  the dimness of the light and the disfigurement caused by a ragged wound on
  the forehead.</p>

  <p>"We had better get him out of this," said Miller, speaking in a flurried
  tone, partly due to the shock of the horrible discovery and partly to the
  accompanying physical unpleasantness, "and then we will have a look round,
  This wasn't just a mere robbery. We are going to find things out."</p>

  <p>With my help he lifted Luttrell's corpse and together we carried it out,
  laying it on the floor of the room at the farther end, to which we also
  dragged the body of Shemmonds.</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery as to how it happened," I said, after a brief
  inspection of the two corpses. "Shemmonds evidently shot the old man from
  behind with the pistol close to the back of the head. The hair is all
  scorched round the wound of entry and the bullet came out at the
  forehead."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miller, "that is all clear enough. But the mystery is why on
  earth Shemmonds didn't let himself out. He must have known that the door was
  unlocked. Yet instead of turning the handle, he must have stood there like a
  fool, battering at the door with his fists. Just look at his hands."</p>

  <p>"The further mystery," said Thorndyke who, all this time, had been making
  a minute examination of the lock both front without and within, "is how the
  door came to be shut. That is quite a curious problem."</p>

  <p>"Quite," agreed Miller. "But it will keep. And there is a still more
  curious problem inside there. There is nearly all the swag from that
  Colchester robbery. Looks as if Luttrell was in it."</p>

  <p>Half reluctantly he re-entered the strong-room and Thorndyke and I
  followed. Near the angle of the passage he stooped to pick up an automatic
  pistol and a small, leather book, which he opened and looked into by the
  light of the lamp. At the first glance he uttered an exclamation and shut the
  book with a snap.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what this is?" he asked, holding it out to us. "It is the
  nominal roll, address book and journal of the gang. We've got them in the
  hollow of our hand; and it is dawning upon me that old Luttrell was the
  managing director whom I have been looking for so long. Just run your eyes
  along those shelves. That's loot; every bit of it. I can identify the
  articles from the lists that I made out."</p>

  <p>He stood looking gloatingly along the shelves with their burden of
  jewellery, plate and other valuables. Then his eye lighted on a drawer in the
  end wall just under the lamp; an iron drawer with a disproportionately large
  handle and bearing a very legible label inscribed "unmounted stones."</p>

  <p>"We'll have a look at his stock of unmounted gems," said Miller; and with
  that he bore down on the drawer, and seizing the handle, gave a vigorous
  pull. "Funny," said he. "It isn't locked, but something seems to be holding
  it back."</p>

  <p>He planted his foot on the wall and took a fresh purchase on the handle.
  "Wait a moment, Miller," said Thorndyke; but even as he spoke, the
  superintendent gave a mighty heave; the drawer came out a full two feet;
  there was a loud click, and a moment later the strong-room door slammed.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Miller, letting go the drawer, which immediately
  slid in with another click. "What was that?"</p>

  <p>"That was the door shutting," replied Thorndyke. "Quite a clever
  arrangement; like the mechanism of a repeater watch. Pulling out the drawer
  wound up and released a spring that shut the door. Very ingenious."</p>

  <p>"But," gasped Miller, turning an ashen face to my colleague, "we're shut
  in."</p>

  <p>"You are forgetting," said I&mdash;a little nervously, I must
  admit&mdash;"that the lock is as we left it."</p>

  <p>The superintendent laughed, somewhat hysterically. "What a fool I am!"
  said he. "As bad as Shemmonds. Still we may as well&mdash;" Here he started
  along the passage and I heard him groping his way to the door, and later
  heard the handle turn. Suddenly the deep silence of the tomb-like chamber was
  rent by a yell of terror.</p>

  <p>"The door won't move! It's locked fast!"</p>

  <p>On this I rushed along the passage with a sickening fear at my heart. And
  even as I ran, there rose before my eyes the horrible vision of the corpse
  with the battered hands that had fallen out when we opened the door of this
  awful trap. He had been caught as we were caught. How soon might it not be
  that some stranger would be looking in on our corpses.</p>

  <p>In the dim twilight by the door I found Miller clutching the handle and
  shaking it like a madman. His self-possession was completely shattered. Nor
  was my own condition much better. I flung my whole weight on the door in the
  faint hope that the lock was not really closed, but the massive iron
  structure was as immovable as a stone wall. I was nevertheless, gathering
  myself up for a second charge when I heard Thorndyke's voice close behind
  me.</p>

  <p>"That is no use, Jervis. The door is locked. But there is nothing to worry
  about."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, there suddenly appeared a bright circle of light from the
  little electric lamp that he always carried in his pocket. Within the circle,
  and now clearly visible, was a second indicator of the puzzle lock on the
  inside of the door-post. Its appearance was vaguely reassuring, especially in
  conjunction with Thorndyke's calm voice; and it evidently appeared so to
  Miller, for he remarked, almost in his natural tones:</p>

  <p>"But it seems to be unlocked still. There is the same AAAAAA that it
  showed when we came in."</p>

  <p>It was perfectly true. The slot of the letter-lock still showed the range
  of fifteen A's, just as it had when the door was open. Could it be that the
  lock was a dummy and that there was some other means of opening the door? I
  was about to put this question to Thorndyke when he put the lamp into my
  hand, and, gently pushing me aside, stepped up to the indicator.</p>

  <p>"Keep the light steady, Jervis," said he, and forthwith he began to
  manipulate the milled edges of the letter discs, beginnings as I noticed, at
  the right or reverse end of the slot and working backwards. I watched him
  with feverish interest and curiosity, as also did Miller, looking to see some
  word of fifteen letters develop in the slot. Instead of which, I saw, to my
  amazement and bewilderment my colleague's finger transforming the row of A's
  into a succession of M's, which, however, were presently followed by an L and
  some X's. When the row was completed it looked like some remote, antediluvian
  date set down in Roman numerals.</p>

  <p>"Try the handle now, Miller," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The superintendent needed no second bidding. Snatching at the handle, he
  turned it and bore heavily on the door. Almost instantly a thin line of light
  appeared at the edge; there was a sharp click, and the door swung right open.
  We fell out immediately&mdash;at least the superintendent and I
  did&mdash;thankful to find ourselves outside and alive. But, as we emerged,
  we both became aware of a man, white-faced and horror-stricken of aspect,
  stooping over the two corpses at the other end of the room. Our appearance
  was so sudden and unexpected&mdash;for the massive solidity of the safe-door
  had rendered our movements inaudible outside&mdash;that, for a moment or two,
  he stood immovable, staring at us, wild-eyed and open-mouthed. Then,
  suddenly, he sprang up erect, and, darting to the door, opened it and rushed
  out with Miller close on his heels.</p>

  <p>He did not get very far. Following the superintendent, I saw the fugitive
  wriggling in the embrace of a tall man on the pavement, who, with Miller's
  assistance, soon had a pair of handcuffs snapped on the man's wrists and then
  departed with his captive in search of a cab.</p>

  <p>"That's one of 'em, I expect," said Miller, as we returned to the office;
  then, as his glance fell on the open strong-room door, he mopped his face
  with his handkerchief. "That door gives me the creeps to look at it," said
  he. "Lord I what a shake-up that was! I've never had such a scare in my life.
  When I heard that door shut and I remembered how that poor devil, Shemmonds,
  came tumbling out&mdash;phoo!" He wiped his brow again, and, walking towards
  the strong-room door, asked: "By the way, what was the magic word after all?"
  He stepped up to the indicator, and, after a quick glance, looked round at me
  in surprise. "Why!" he exclaimed, "blow me if it isn't AAAA still! But the
  doctor altered it, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>At this moment Thorndyke appeared from the strong-room, where he had
  apparently been conducting some explorations, and to him the superintendent
  turned for an explanation.</p>

  <p>"It is an ingenious device," said he; "in fact, the whole strong-room is a
  monument of ingenuity, somewhat misapplied, but perfectly effective, as Mr.
  Shemmonds's corpse testifies. The key-combination is a number expressed in
  Roman numerals, but the lock has a fly-back mechanism which acts as soon as
  the door begins to open. That was how Shemmonds was caught. He, no doubt
  purposely, avoided watching Luttrell set the lock&mdash;or else Luttrell
  didn't let him&mdash;but as he went in with his intended victim, he looked at
  the indicator and saw the row of A's, which he naturally assumed to be the
  key. Then, when he tried to let himself out, of course, the lock wouldn't
  open."</p>

  <p>"It is rather odd that he didn't try some other combinations," said I.</p>

  <p>"He probably did," replied Thorndyke, "but when they failed he would
  naturally come back to the A's, which he had seen when the door was open.
  This is how it works."</p>

  <p>He shut the door, and then, closely watched by the superintendent and me,
  turned the milled rims of the letter-discs until the indicator showed a row
  of numerals thus: MMMMMMMCCCLXXXV. Grasping the handle, he turned it and gave
  a gentle pull, when the door began to open. But the instant it started from
  its bed, there was a loud click and all the letters of the indicator flew
  back to A.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm jiggered!" exclaimed Miller. "It must have been an awful
  suck-in for that poor blighter, Shemmonds. Took me in, too. I saw those A's
  and the door open, and I thought I knew all about it. But what beats me,
  doctor, is how you managed to work it out. I can't see what you had to go on.
  Would it be allowable to ask how it was done?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Thorndyke "but we had better defer the explanation.
  You have got those two bodies to dispose of and some other matters, and we
  must get back to our chambers. I will write down the key-combination, in case
  you want it, and then you must come and see us and let us know what luck you
  have had."</p>

  <p>He wrote the numerals on a slip of paper, and when he had handed it to the
  superintendent, we took our leave.</p>

  <p>"I find myself," said I, as we walked home, "in much the same position as
  Miller. I don't see what you had to go on. It is clear to me that you not
  only worked out the lock-combination&mdash;from the seal inscription, as I
  assume&mdash;but that you identified Luttrell as the director of the gang. I
  don't, in the least, understand how you did it."</p>

  <p>"And yet, Jervis," said he, "it was an essentially simple case. If you
  review it and cast up the items of evidence, you will see that we really had
  all the facts. The problem was merely to co-ordinate them and extract their
  significance. Take first the character of Luttrell. We saw the man in company
  with another, evidently a fairly intimate acquaintance. They were being
  shadowed by a detective, and it is pretty clear that they detected the
  sleuth, for they shook him off quite neatly. Later, we learn from Miller that
  one of these men is suspected to be a member of a firm of swell burglars and
  that the other is a well-to-do, rather eccentric and very miscellaneous
  dealer, who has a strong-room fitted with a puzzle lock. I am astonished that
  the usually acute Miller did not notice how well Luttrell fitted the part of
  the managing director whom he was looking for. Here was a dealer who bought
  and sold all sorts of queer but valuable things, who must have had unlimited
  facilities for getting rid of stones, bullion and silver, and who used a
  puzzle lock. Now, who uses a puzzle lock? No one, certainly, who can
  conveniently use a key. But to the manager of a gang of thieves it would be a
  valuable safeguard, for he might at any moment be robbed of his keys, and
  perhaps made away with. But he could not be robbed of the secret passwords
  and his possession of it would be a security against murder. So you see that
  the simple probabilities pointed to Luttrell as the head of the gang.</p>

  <p>"And now consider the problem of the lock. First, we saw that Luttrell
  wore on his left hand a huge, cumbrous seal ring, that he carried a
  Coddington lens on his watch-guard, and a small electric lamp in his pocket.
  That told us very, little. But when Miller told us about the lock and showed
  us the squeeze of the seal, and when we saw that the seal bore a long
  inscription in minute lettering, a connection began to appear. As Miller
  justly observed, no man&mdash;especially no elderly man&mdash;could trust the
  key combination exclusively to his memory. He would carry about him some
  record to which he could refer in case his memory failed him. But that record
  would hardly be one that anybody could read, or the secrecy and safety of the
  lock would be gone. It would probably be some kind of cryptogram; and when we
  saw this inscription and considered it in conjunction with the lens and the
  lamp, it seemed highly probable that the key-combination was contained in the
  inscription; and that probability was further increased when we saw the
  nonsensical doggerel of which the inscription was made up. The suggestion was
  that the verses had been made for some purpose independent of their sense.
  Accordingly I gave the inscription very careful consideration.</p>

  <p>"Now we learned from Miller that the puzzle lock had fifteen letters. The
  key might be one long word, such as 'superlativeness', a number of short
  words, or some chemical or other formula. Or it was possible that it might be
  of the nature of a chronogram. I have never heard of chronograms being used
  for secret records or messages, but it has often occurred to me that they
  would be extremely suitable. And this was an exceptionally suitable
  case."</p>

  <p>"Chronogram," said I. "Isn't that something connected with medals?"</p>

  <p>"They have often been used on medals," he replied. "In effect, a
  chronogram is an inscription some of the letters of which form a date
  connected with the subject of the inscription. Usually the date letters are
  cut larger than the others for convenience in reading, but, of course,
  this is not essential. The principle of a chronogram is this. The letters of
  the Roman alphabet are of two kinds: those that are simply letters and
  nothing else, and those that are numerals as well as letters. The numeral
  letters are M = a thousand, D = five hundred, C = one hundred, L = fifty, X =
  ten, V = five, and I = one. Now, in deciphering a chronogram, you pick out
  all the numeral letters and add them up without regard to their order. The
  total gives you the date.</p>

  <p>"Well, as I said, it occurred to me that this might be of the nature of a
  chronogram; but as the lock had letters and not figures, the number, if there
  was one, would have to be expressed in Roman numerals, and it would have to
  form a number of fifteen numeral letters. As it was thus quite easy to put my
  hypothesis to the test, I proceeded to treat the inscription as a chronogram
  and decipher it; and behold! it yielded a number of fifteen letters, which,
  of course, was as near certainty as was possible, short of actual
  experiment."</p>

  <p>"Let us see how you did the decipherment," I said, as we entered our
  chambers and shut the door. I procured a large note-block and pencil, and,
  laying them on the table, drew up two chairs.</p>

  <p>"Now," said I, "fire away."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "We will begin by writing the inscription in proper
  chronogram form with the numeral letters double size and treating the U's as
  V's and the W's as double V's according to the rules."</p>

  <p>Here he wrote out the inscription in Roman capitals thus:</p>

  <p>"eheV aLas hoVV fast the DaM fVgaCes LabVntVr annI espeCIaLLy In the Cases
  of poor oLD bLokes LIke yoV anD Me posthVMVs VVho onLy VVaIt for VerMes to
  ConsVMe Vs."</p>

  <p>[Compiler's note: I have replaced the small caps in the original with
  lower-case letters.]</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "let us make a column of each line and add them up,
  thus:</p>

  <p>1. V=5, L=50, VV=10, D=500, M=1000, V=5, C=100&mdash;Total 1670</p>

  <p>2. L=50, V=5, V=5, I=1, C=100, I=1, L=50, L=50, I=1, C=100&mdash;Total
  363</p>

  <p>3. L=50, D=500, L=50, L=50, I=1, V=5, D=500, M=1000, V=5, M=1000,
  V=5&mdash;Total 3166</p>

  <p>4. VV=10, L=50, VV=10, I=1, V=5, M=1000, C=100, V=5, M=1000,
  V=5&mdash;Total 2186</p>

  <p>"Now," he continued "we take the four totals and add them together,
  thus:</p>

  <p>1670+363+3166+2186 = 7385</p>

  <p>and we get the grand total of seven thousand three hundred and eighty-five
  and this, expressed in Roman numerals, is MMMMMMMCCCLXXXV. Here, then, is a
  number consisting of fifteen letters, the exact number of spaces in the
  indicator of the puzzle lock; and I repeat that this striking coincidence,
  added to, or rather multiplied into, the other probabilities, made it
  practically certain that this was the key-combination. It remained only to
  test it by actual experiment."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "I noticed that you perked up rather suddenly when
  Miller mentioned the electric meter."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he replied. "It seemed that there must be a small lamp
  switched on somewhere in the building, and the only place that had not been
  examined was the strong-room. But if there was a lamp alight there, someone
  had been in the strong-room. And, as, the only person who was known to be
  able to get in was missing, it seemed probable that he was in there still.
  But if he was, he was pretty certainly dead; and there was quite a
  considerable probability that some one else was in there with him, since his
  companion was missing, too, and both had disappeared at the same time. But I
  must confess that that spring drawer was beyond my expectations, though I
  suspected it as soon as I saw Miller pulling at it. Luttrell was an ingenious
  old rascal; he almost deserved a better fate. However, I expect his death
  will have delivered the gang into the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>Events fell out as Thorndyke surmised. Mr. Luttrell's little journal, in
  conjunction with the confession of the spy who had been captured on the
  premises, enabled the police to swoop down on the disconcerted gang before
  any breath of suspicion had reached them; with the result that they are now
  secured in strong-rooms of another kind whereof the doors are fitted with
  appliances as effective as, though less ingenious than, Mr. Luttrell's puzzle
  lock.</p>

  <h2><a name="c2"
     id="c22"></a>II. &mdash; THE GREEN CHECK JACKET</h2>

  <p class="first">THE visits of our old friend, Mr. Brodribb, even when
  strictly professional, usually took the outward form of a friendly call. On
  the present occasion there was no such pretence. The old solicitor entered
  our chambers carrying a small suit-case (the stamped initials on which,
  "R.M.," I noticed, instantly attracted an inquisitive glance from Thorndyke,
  being obviously not Mr. Brodribb's own) which he placed on the table and then
  shook hands with an evident air of business.</p>

  <p>"I have come, Thorndyke," he said, with unusual directness, "to ask your
  advice on a matter which is causing me some uneasiness. Do you know Reginald
  Merrill?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly," was the reply. "I meet him occasionally in court; and, of
  course, I know him as the author of that interesting book on Prehistoric
  Flint-mines."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, "he has disappeared. He is missing. I don't like to
  use the expression; but when a responsible man is absent from his usual
  places of resort, when he apparently had no expectation of being so absent,
  and when he has made no provision for such absence, I think we may regard him
  as having disappeared in a legal sense. His absence calls for active
  inquiry."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," agreed Thorndyke; "and I take it that you are the person on
  whom the duty devolves?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. I am his solicitor and the executor of his will&mdash;at
  least I believe so; and the only near relative of his whom I know is his
  nephew and heir, Ethelbert Crick, his sister's son. But Crick seems to have
  disappeared, too; and about the same time as Merrill. It is an extraordinary
  affair."</p>

  <p>"You say that you believe you are Merrill's executor. Haven't you seen the
  will?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen a will. I have it in my safe. But Merrill said he was going
  to draw up another, and he may have done so. But if he has, he will almost
  certainly have appointed me his executor, and I shall assume that he has and
  act accordingly."</p>

  <p>"Was there any special reason for making a new will?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Brodribb. "He has just come into quite a considerable
  fortune, and he was pretty well off before. Under the old will, practically
  the whole of his property went to Crick. There was a small bequest to a man
  named Samuel Horder, his cousin's son; and Horder was the alternative legatee
  if Crick should die before Merrill. Now, I understood Merrill to say that, in
  view of this extra fortune, he wished to do rather more for Horder, and I
  gathered that he proposed to divide the estate more or less equally between
  the two men. The whole estate was more than he thought necessary for Crick.
  And now, as we have cleared up the preliminaries, I will give you the
  circumstances of the disappearance.</p>

  <p>"Last Wednesday, the 5th, I had a note from him saying that he would have
  some reports ready for me on the following day, but that he would be away
  from his office from 10.30 a.m. to about 6.30, and suggesting that I should
  send round in the evening if I wanted the papers particularly. Now it
  happened that my clerk, Page, had to go to a place near London Bridge on
  Thursday morning, and, oddly enough, he saw Mr. Merrill come out of
  Edginton's, the ship-fitters, with a man who was carrying a largish hand-bag.
  There was nothing in it, of course, but Page is an observant man and he
  noticed Merrill's companion so far as to observe that he was wearing a
  Norfolk jacket of a greenish shepherd's plaid and a grey tweed hat. He also
  noted the time by the big clock in the street near to
  Edginton's&mdash;11.46&mdash;and that Merrill looked up at it, and that the
  two men then walked off rather quickly in the direction of the station. Well,
  in the evening, I sent Page round to Merrill's chambers in Fig-tree Court to
  get the papers. He arrived there just after 6.30, but he found the door shut,
  and though he rapped at the door on the chance that Merrill might have come
  in&mdash;he lives in the chambers adjoining the office&mdash;there was no
  answer. So he went for a walk round the Temple, deciding to return a little
  later.</p>

  <p>"Well, he had gone as far as the cloisters and was loitering there to look
  in the window of the wig shop when he saw a man in a greenish shepherd's
  plaid jacket and a tweed hat coming up Pump Court. As the man approached Page
  thought he recognised him; in fact, he felt so sure that he stopped him and
  asked him if he knew what time Mr. Merrill would be home. But the man looked
  at him in astonishment. 'Merrill?' said he. 'I don't know anyone of that
  name.' Thereupon Page apologised and explained how he had been misled by the
  pattern and colour of the jacket.</p>

  <p>"After walking about for nearly half an hour, Page went back to Merrill's
  chambers; but the door was shut and he could get no answer by rapping with his
  stick, so he scribbled a note and dropped it into the letter-box and came
  away. The next morning I sent him round again, but the chambers were still
  shut up, and they have been shut up ever since; and nothing what ever has
  been seen or heard of Merrill.</p>

  <p>"On Saturday, thinking it possible that Crick might be able to give me
  some news of his uncle, I called at his lodgings; and then, to my
  astonishment, I learned that he also was missing. He had gone away early on
  Thursday morning, saying that he had to go on business to Rochester, and that
  he might not be home to dinner. But he never came home at all. I called again
  on Sunday evening, and, as he had still not returned, I decided to take more
  active measures.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon, immediately after lunch, I called at the Porter's Lodge,
  and, having briefly explained the circumstances and who I was, asked the
  porter to bring the duplicate key&mdash;which he had for the
  laundress&mdash;and accompany me to Mr. Merrill's chambers to see if, by
  chance, the tenant might be lying in them dead or insensible. He assured me
  that this could not be the case, since he had given the key every morning to
  the laundress, who had, in fact, returned it to him only a couple of hours
  previously. Nevertheless, he took the key and looked up the laundress, who
  had rooms near the lodge, who was fortunately at home and who turned out to
  be a most respectable and intelligent elderly woman; and we went together to
  Merrill's chambers. The porter admitted us, and when we had been right
  through the set and ascertained definitely that Merrill was not there, he
  handed the key to the laundress, Mrs. Butler, and went away.</p>

  <p>"When he was gone, I had a talk with Mrs. Butler, from which some rather
  startling facts transpired. It seemed that on Thursday, as Merrill was going
  to be out all day, she took the opportunity to have a grand clean-up of the
  chambers, to tidy up the lobby, and to look over the chests of drawers and
  the wardrobe and shake out and brush the clothes and see that no moths had
  got in. 'When I had finished,' she said, 'the place was like the inside of a
  band-box; just as he liked to see it.'</p>

  <p>"'And, after all, Mrs. Butler,' said I, 'he never did see it.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, yes, he did,' says she. 'I don't know when he came in, but when I
  let myself in the next morning, I could see that he had been in since I
  left.'</p>

  <p>"'How did you know that?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' says she, 'I left the carpet-sweeper standing against the
  wardrobe door. I remembered it after I left and would have gone back and
  moved it, but I had already handed the key in at the Porter's Lodge. But when
  I went in next morning it wasn't there. It had been moved into the corner by
  the fireplace. Then the looking-glass had been moved. I could see that,
  because, before I went away, I had tidied my hair by it, and being short, I
  had to tilt it to see my face in it. Now it was tilted to suit a tall person
  and I could not see myself in it. Then I saw that the shaving soap had been moved,
  and when I put it back in its place, I found it was damp. It wouldn't have
  kept damp for twenty-four hours at this time of year.' That was perfectly
  true, you know, Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," agreed Thorndyke, "that woman is an excellent observer."</p>

  <p>"Well," continued Brodribb, "on this she examined the shaving soap and the
  sponge and found them both perceptibly damp. It appeared practically certain
  that Merrill had been in on the preceding evening and had shaved; but by way
  of confirmation, I suggested that she should look over his clothes and see
  whether he had changed any of his garments. She did so, beginning with those
  that were hanging in the wardrobe, which she took down one at a time.
  Suddenly she gave a cry of surprise, and I got a bit of a start myself when
  she handed out a greenish shepherd's plaid Norfolk jacket.</p>

  <p>"'That,' she said, 'was not here when I brushed these clothes,' and it was
  obvious from its dusty condition that it could not have been; 'and,' she
  added, 'I have never seen it before to my knowledge, and I think I should
  have remembered it.' I asked her if there was any coat missing and she
  answered that she had brushed a grey tweed jacket that seemed to have
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a queer affair. The first thing to be done was to ascertain,
  if possible whether that jacket was or was not Merrill's. That, I thought,
  you would be able to judge better than I; so I borrowed his suit-case and
  popped the jacket into it, together with another jacket that was undoubtedly
  his, for comparison. Here is the suit-case and the two jackets are
  inside."</p>

  <p>"It is really a question that could be better decided by a tailor," said
  Thorndyke. "The differences of measurement can't be great if they could both
  be worn by the same person. But we shall see." He rose, and having spread
  some sheets of newspaper over the table, opened the suit-case and took out
  the two jackets, which he laid out side by side. Then, with his spring-tape,
  he proceeded systematically to measure the two garments, entering each pair
  of measurements on a slip of paper divided into two columns. Mr. Brodribb and
  I watched him expectantly and compared the two sets of figures as they were
  written down; and very soon it became evident that they were, at least, not
  identical. At length Thorndyke laid down the tape, and picking up the paper,
  studied it closely.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "we may conclude that these two jackets were not made
  for the same person. The differences are not great, but they are consistent.
  The elbow creases, for instance, agree with the total length of the sleeves.
  The owner of the green jacket has longer arms and a bigger span than Merrill,
  but his chest measurement is nearly two inches greater and he has much more
  sloping shoulders. He could hardly have buttoned Merrill's jacket."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Brodribb, "the next question is, did Merrill come home in
  some other man's coat or did some other man enter his chambers? From what
  Page has told us it seems pretty evident that a stranger must have got into
  those chambers. But if that is so, the questions arise: What the deuce was
  the fellow's object in changing into Merrill's clothes and shaving? How did
  he get into Merrill's chambers? What was he doing there? What has become of
  Merrill? And what is the meaning of the whole affair?"</p>

  <p>"To some of those questions," said Thorndyke, "the answers are fairly
  obvious. If we assume, as I do, that the owner of the green jacket is the man
  whom Page saw at London Bridge and afterwards in the cloisters, the reason
  for the change of garments becomes plain enough. Page told the man that he
  had identified him by this very distinctive jacket as the person with whom
  Merrill was last seen alive. Evidently that man's safety demanded that he
  should get rid of the incriminating jacket without delay. Then, as to his
  having shaved: did Page give you any description of the man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he was a tallish man, about thirty-five, with a large dark moustache
  and a torpedo beard."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "then we may say that the man who went into
  Merrill's chambers was a moustached bearded man in a green jacket and that the
  man who came out was a clean-shaved man in a grey jacket, whom Page himself
  would probably have passed without a second glance. That is clear enough. And
  as to how he got into the chambers, evidently he let himself in with
  Merrill's key; and if he did, I am afraid we can make a pretty shrewd guess
  as to what has become of Merrill, and only hope that we are guessing wrong.
  As to what this man was doing in those chambers and what is the meaning of
  the whole affair, that is a more difficult question. If the man had Merrill's
  latchkey, we may assume that he had the rest of Merrill's keys; that he had,
  in fact, free access to any locked receptacles in those chambers. The
  circumstances suggest that he entered the chambers for the purpose of getting
  possession of some valuable objects contained in them. Do you happen to know
  whether Merrill had any property of considerable value on the premises?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," replied Brodribb. "He had a safe, but I don't know what he kept
  in it. Principally documents, I should think. Certainly not money, in any
  considerable amounts. The only thing of value that I actually know of is the
  new will; and that would only be valuable in certain circumstances."</p>

  <p>The abrupt and rather ambiguous conclusion of Mr. Brodribb's statement was
  not lost either on Thorndyke or on me. Apparently the cautious old lawyer had
  suddenly realised, as I had, that if anything had happened to Merrill, those
  "certain circumstances" had already come into being. From what he had told us
  it appeared that, under the new will, Crick stood to inherit a half of Mr.
  Merrill's fortune, whereas under the old will he stood to inherit nearly the
  whole. And it was a great fortune. The loss or destruction of the new will
  would be worth a good many thousand pounds to Mr. Crick.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, after a pause, "what is to be done? I suppose I
  ought to communicate with the police."</p>

  <p>"You will have to, sooner or later," said Thorndyke; "but meanwhile, leave
  these two jackets&mdash;or, at least, the green one&mdash;with me for the
  present and let me see if I can extract any further information from it."</p>

  <p>"You won't find anything in the pockets but dirt. I've tried them."</p>

  <p>"I hope you left the dirt," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I did," replied Brodribb, "excepting what came out on my fingers. Very
  well; I'll leave the coats with you for to-day, and I will see if I can get
  any further news of Crick from his landlady."</p>

  <p>With this the old solicitor shook hands and went off with such an evident
  air of purpose that I remarked: "Brodribb is off to find out whether Mr.
  Crick was the proprietor of a green plaid Norfolk jacket."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled. "It was rather quaint," said he, "to see the sudden way
  in which he drew in his horns when the inwardness of the affair dawned on
  him. But we mustn't start with a preconceived theory. Our business is to get
  hold of some more facts. There is little enough to go on at present. Let us
  begin by having a good look at this green jacket."</p>

  <p>He picked it up and carried it to the window, where we both looked it over
  critically.</p>

  <p>"It is rather dusty," I remarked, "especially on the front, and there is a
  white mark on the middle button."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Chalk, apparently; and if you look closely, there are white traces
  on the other buttons and on the front of the coat. The back is much less
  dusty."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Thorndyke turned the garment round, and then, from the side
  of the skirt, picked a small, hair-like object which he felt between his
  finger and thumb, looked at closely and handed to me.</p>

  <p>"A bit of barley beard," said I, "and there are two more on the other
  side. He must have walked along a narrow path through a barley
  field&mdash;the state of the front of his coat almost suggests that he had
  crawled."</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is earthy dust; but Polton's extractor will give us more
  information about that. We had better hand it over to him; but first we will
  go through the pockets in spite of Brodribb's discouragement."</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" I exclaimed, as I thrust my hand into one of the side pockets,
  "he was right about the dirt. Look at this." I drew out my hand with a quite
  considerable pinch of dry earth and one or two little fragments of chalk. "It
  looks as if he had been crawling in loose earth."</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed, inspecting his own "catch"&mdash;a pinch of
  reddish earth and a fragment of chalk of the size of a large pea. "The earth
  is very characteristic, this red-brown loam that you find overlying the
  chalk. All his outside pockets seem to have caught more or less of it.
  However, we can leave Polton to collect it and prepare it for examination.
  I'll take the coat up to him now, and while he is working at it I think I
  will walk round to Edginton's and see if I can pick up any further
  particulars."</p>

  <p>He went up to the laboratory floor, where our assistant, Polton, carried
  on his curious and varied activities, and when he returned we sallied forth
  together. In Fleet Street we picked up a disengaged taxicab, by which we were
  whisked across Blackfriars Bridge and a few minutes later set down at the
  corner of Tooley Street. We made our way to the ship-chandler's shop, where
  Thorndyke proceeded to put a few discreet questions to the manager, who
  listened politely and with sympathetic interest.</p>

  <p>"The difficulty is," said he, "that there were a good many gentlemen in
  here last Thursday. You say they came about 11.45. If you could tell me what
  they bought, we could look at the bill-duplicate book and that might help
  us."</p>

  <p>"I don't actually know what they bought," said Thorndyke. "It might have
  been a length of rope; a rope, perhaps, say twelve or fourteen fathoms or
  perhaps more. But I may be wrong."</p>

  <p>I stared at Thorndyke in amazement. Long as I known him, this
  extraordinary faculty of instantaneous induction always came on me as a fresh
  surprise. I had supposed that in this case we had absolutely nothing to go
  on; and yet here he was with at least a tentative suggestion before the
  inquiry appeared to have begun. And that suggestion was clear evidence that
  he had already arrived at a hypothetical solution of the mystery. I was still
  pondering on this astonishing fact when the manager approached with an open
  book and accompanied by an assistant.</p>

  <p>"I see," said he, "that there is an entry, apparently about mid-day on
  Thursday, of the sale of a fifteen-fathom length of deep-sea lead-line, and
  my friend, here, remembers selling it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the assistant confirmed, "I remember it because he wanted to get it
  into his hand-bag, and it took the three of us to stuff it in. Thick
  lead-line is pretty stiff when it's new."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what these gentlemen were like and how they were
  dressed?"</p>

  <p>"One was a rather elderly gentleman, clean-shaved, I think. The other I
  remember better because he had rather queer-looking eyes&mdash;very pale
  grey. He had a pointed beard and he wore a greenish check coat and a cloth
  hat. That's all I remember about him."</p>

  <p>"It is more than most people would have remembered," said Thorndyke. "I am
  very much obliged to you; and I think I will ask you to let me have a
  fifteen-fathom length of that same lead-line."</p>

  <p>By this time my capacity for astonishment was exhausted. What on earth
  could my colleague want with a deep-sea lead-line? But, after all, why not?
  If he had then and there purchased a Trotman's anchor, a shark-hook and a set
  of International code signals, I should have been prepared to accept the
  proceeding without comment. Thorndyke was a law unto himself.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as I walked homeward by his side, carrying the coil of rope,
  I continued to speculate on this singular case. Thorndyke had arrived at a
  hypothetical solution of Mr. Brodribb's problem; and it was evidently
  correct, so far, as the entry in the bill-book proved. But what was the
  connection between a dusty jacket and a length of thin rope? And why this
  particular length? I could make nothing of it. But I determined, as soon as
  we got home, to see what new facts Polton's activities had brought to
  light.</p>

  <p>The results were disappointing. Polton's dust extractor had been busy, and
  the products in the form of tiny heaps of dust, were methodically set out on
  a sheet of white paper, each little heap covered with a watch-glass and
  accompanied by its written particulars as to the part of the garment from
  which it had come. I examined a few samples under the microscope, but though
  curious and interesting, as all dust is, they showed nothing very
  distinctive. The dust might have come from anyone's coat. There was, of
  course, a good deal of yellowish sandy loam, a few particles of chalk, a
  quantity of fine ash, clinker and particles of coal&mdash;railway dust from a
  locomotive&mdash;ordinary town and house dust and some oddments such as
  pollen grains, including those of the sow-thistle, mallow, poppy and
  valerian, and in one sample I found two scales from the wing of the common
  blue butterfly. That was all; and it told me nothing but that the owner of
  the coat had recently been in a chalk district and that he had taken a
  railway journey.</p>

  <p>While I was working with the microscope, Polton was busy with an
  occupation that I did not understand. He had cemented the little pieces of
  chalk that we had found in the pockets to a plate of glass by means of pitch,
  and he was now brushing them under water with a soft brush and from time to
  time decanting the milky water into a tall sediment glass. Now, as most
  people know, chalk is largely composed of microscopic
  shells&mdash;foraminifera&mdash;which can be detached by gently brushing the
  chalk under water. But what was the object? There was no doubt that the
  material was chalk, and we knew that foraminifera were there. Why trouble to
  prove what is common knowledge? I questioned Polton, but he knew nothing of
  the purpose of the investigation. He merely beamed on me like a crinkly old
  graven image and went on brushing. I dipped up a sample of the white sediment
  and examined it under the microscope. Of course there were foraminifera, and
  very beautiful they were. But what about it? The whole proceeding looked
  purposeless. And yet I knew that it was not. Thorndyke was the last man in
  the world to expend his energies in flogging a dead horse.</p>

  <p>Presently he came up to the laboratory, and, when he had looked at the
  dust specimens and confirmed my opinion of them, he fell to work on the chalk
  sediment. Having prepared a number of slides, he sat down at the microscope
  with a sharp pencil and a block of smooth paper with the apparent purpose of
  cataloguing and making drawings of the foraminifera. And at this task I left
  him while I went forth to collect some books that I had ordered from a
  bookseller in the Charing Cross Road.</p>

  <p>When I returned with my purchases about an hour later I found him putting
  back in a press a portfolio of large-scale Ordnance maps of Kent which he had
  apparently been consulting, and I noticed on the table his sheet of drawings
  and a monograph of the fossil foraminifera.</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," I said cheerfully, "I suppose this time, you know
  exactly what has become of Merrill."</p>

  <p>"I can guess," he replied, "and so can you. But the actual data are
  distressingly vague. We have certain indications, as you will have noticed.
  The trouble will be to bring them to a focus. It is a case for constructive
  imagination on the one hand and the method of exclusion on the other. I shall
  make a preliminary circle-round to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Meaning by that?"</p>

  <p>"I have a hypothesis. It is probably wrong. If it is, we must try another,
  and yet another. Every time we fail we shall narrow the field of inquiry
  until by eliminating one possibility after another, we may hope to arrive at
  the solution. My first essay will take me down into Kent."</p>

  <p>"You are not going into those wild regions alone, Thorndyke," said I. "You
  will need my protection and support to say nothing of my invaluable advice. I
  presume you realise that?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly." he replied gravely. "I was reckoning on a two-man
  expedition. Besides, you are as much interested in the case as I am. And now,
  let us go forth and dine and fortify ourselves for the perils of
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>In the course of dinner I led the conversation to the products of Polton's
  labours and remarked upon their very indefinite significance; but Thorndyke
  was more indefinite still, as he usually was in cases of a highly speculative
  character.</p>

  <p>"You are expecting too much from Polton," he said with a smile. "This is
  not a matter of foraminifera or pollen or butterfly-scales; they are only
  items of circumstantial evidence. What we have to do is to consider the whole
  body of facts in our possession; what Brodribb has told us, what we know for
  ourselves and what we have ascertained by investigation. The case is still
  very much in the air, but it is not so vague as you seem to imply."</p>

  <p>This was all I could get out of him; and as the "whole body of facts"
  yielded no suggestion at all to me, I could only possess my soul in patience
  and hope for some enlightenment on the morrow.</p>

  <p>About a quarter to eleven on the following morning, while Thorndyke was
  giving final instructions to Polton and I was speculating on the contents of
  the suit-case that was going to accompany us, footsteps became audible on our
  stairs. Their crescendo terminated in a flourish on our little brass knocker
  which I recognised as Brodribb's knock. I accordingly opened the door, and in
  walked our old friend. His keen blue eye took in at once our informal raiment
  and the suit-case and lighted up with something like curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Off on an expedition?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "A little trip down into Kent. Gravesend, in
  fact."</p>

  <p>"Gravesend," repeated Brodribb with further awakened interest. "That was
  rather a favourite resort of poor Merrill's. By the way, your expedition is
  not connected with his disappearance, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact it is," replied Thorndyke. "Just a tentative
  exploration, you know."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Brodribb, all agog now, "and I'm coming with you. I've got
  a clear day and I'm not going to take a refusal."</p>

  <p>"No refusal was contemplated," rejoined Thorndyke. "You'll probably waste
  a day, but we shall benefit by your society. Polton will let your clerk know
  that you haven't absconded, or you can look in at the office yourself. We
  have plenty of time."</p>

  <p>Brodribb chose the latter plan, which enabled him to exchange his tall hat
  and morning coat for a soft hat and jacket, and we accordingly made our way
  to Charing Cross via Lincoln's Inn, where Brodribb's office was situated. I
  noticed that Brodribb, with his customary discretion, asked no questions,
  though he must have observed, as I had, the striking fact that Thorndyke had
  in some way connected Merrill with Gravesend; and in fact with the exception
  of Brodribb's account of his failure to get any news of Mr. Crick, no
  reference was made to the nature of our expedition until we alighted at our
  destination.</p>

  <p>On emerging from the station, Thorndyke turned to the left and led the way
  out of the approach into a street, on the opposite side of which a rather
  grimy statue of Queen Victoria greeted us with a supercilious stare. Here we
  turned to the south along a prosperous thoroughfare, and presently crossing a
  main road, followed its rather sordid continuation until the urban squalor
  began to be tempered by traces of rusticity, and the suburb became a village.
  Passing a pleasant looking inn and a smithy, which seemed to have an
  out-patient department for invalid carts, we came into a quiet lane offering
  a leafy vista with glimpses of thatched and tiled cottages whose gardens were
  gay with summer flowers. Opposite these, some rough stone steps led up to a
  stile by the side of an open gate which gave access to a wide cart-track.
  Here Thorndyke halted, and producing his pocket map-case, compared the
  surroundings with the map. At length he pocketed the case, and turning
  towards the cart-track, said: "This is our way, for better or worse. In a few
  minutes we shall probably know whether we have found a clue or a mare's
  nest."</p>

  <p>We followed the track up a rise until, reaching the crest of the hill, we
  saw stretching away below us a wide, fertile valley with wooded heights
  beyond, over the brow of which peeped the square tower of some village
  church.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, taking off his hat to enjoy the light breeze, "clue
  or no clue, this is perfectly delightful and well worth the journey. Just
  look at those charming little blue butterflies fluttering round that mallow.
  What a magnificent prospect And where, but in Kent, will you see such a
  barley field as that?"</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, a beautiful landscape. But as my eye travelled over the
  enormous barley field, its tawny surface rippling, in golden waves before the
  summer breeze, it was not the beauty of the scene that occupied my mind. I
  was thinking of those three ends of barley beard that we had picked from the
  skirts of the green jacket. The cart-track had now contracted to a foot path;
  but it was a broader path than I should have looked for, running straight
  across the great field to a far-away stile; and half way along it on the left
  hand side I could see, rising above the barley, the top of a rough fence
  around a small, square enclosure that looked like a pound&mdash;though it was
  in an unlikely situation.</p>

  <p>We pursued the broad path across the field until we were nearly abreast of
  the pound, and I was about to draw Thorndyke's attention to it, when I
  perceived a narrow lane through the barley&mdash;hardly a path, but rather a
  track, trodden through the crop by some persons who had gone to the
  enclosure. Into this track Thorndyke turned as if he had been looking for it,
  and walked towards the enclosure, closely scrutinising the ground as he went.
  Brodribb and I, of course, followed in single file, brushing through the
  barley as we went; and as we drew nearer we could see that there was an
  opening in the enclosing fence and that inside was a deep hollow the edges of
  which were fringed with clumps of pink valerian. At the opening of the fence
  Thorndyke halted and looked back.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, "is it going to be a mare's nest?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "It is a clue, and something more!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed to the foot of one of the principal posts of the
  fence, to which was secured a short length of rope, the frayed ends of which
  suggested that it had broken under a heavy strain. And now I could see what
  the enclosure was. Inside it was a deep pit, and at the bottom of the pit, to
  one side, was a circular hole, black as night, and apparently leading down
  into the bowels of the earth.</p>

  <p>"That must be a dene hole," said I, looking at the yawning cavity.</p>

  <p>"It is," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"Ha," said Brodribb, "so that is a dene hole, is it? Damned unpleasant
  looking place. Dene holes were one of poor Merrill's hobbies. He used to go
  down to explore them. I hope you are not suggesting that he went down this
  one."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is what has happened, Brodribb," was the reply. "That
  end of rope looks like his. It is deep-sea lead-line. I have a length of it
  here, bought at the same place as he bought his, and probably cut from the
  same sample." He opened the suit-case, and taking out the coil of line that
  we had bought, flung it down by the foot of the post. Obviously it was
  identical with the broken end. "However," he added, "we shall see."</p>

  <p>"We are going down, are we?" asked Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"We?" repeated Thorndyke. "I am going down if it is practicable. Not
  otherwise. If it is an ordinary seventy-foot shaft with perpendicular sides,
  we shall have to get proper appliances. But you had better stay above, in any
  case."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Brodribb. "I am not such a back number as you think.
  I have been a mountain-climber in my time and I'm not a bit nervous. I can
  get down all right if there is any foothold, and I've got a rope to hang on
  to. And you can see for yourself that somebody has been down with a rope
  only."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "but I don't see that that somebody has come up
  again."</p>

  <p>"No," Brodribb admitted; "that's true. The rope seems to have broken; and
  you say your rope is the same stuff?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me inquiringly as I stooped and examined the frayed
  end of the strange rope.</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Jervis?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That rope didn't break," I replied. "It has been, chafed or sawn through.
  It is quite different in appearance from a broken end."</p>

  <p>"That was what I decided as soon as I saw it," said Thorndyke. "Besides, a
  new rope of this size and quality couldn't possibly break under the weight of
  a man."</p>

  <p>Brodribb gazed at the frayed end with an expression of horror.</p>

  <p>"What a diabolical thing!" he exclaimed. "You mean that some wretch
  deliberately cut the rope and let another man drop down the shaft! But it
  can't be. I really think you must be mistaken. It must have been a defective
  rope."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is what it looks like," replied Thorndyke. He made a 'running
  bowline' at the end of our rope and slipped the loop over his shoulders,
  drawing it tight under his arms. Then he turned towards the pit. "You had
  better take a couple of turns round the foot of the post, Jervis," said he,
  "and pay out just enough to keep the rope taut."</p>

  <p>He took an electric inspection-lamp from the suit case, slipped the
  battery in his pocket and hooked the bull's-eye to a button-hole, and when
  all was ready, he climbed down into the pit, crossed the sloping floor, and
  crouching down, peered into the forbidding hole, throwing down it a beam of
  light from his bull's-eye. Then he stood up and grasped the rope.</p>

  <p>"It is quite practicable," said he; "only about twenty feet deep, and good
  foothold all the way." With this he crouched once more, backed into the hole
  and disappeared from view. He evidently descended pretty quickly, to judge by
  the rate at which I had to pay out the rope, and in quite a short time I felt
  the tension slacken and began to haul up the line. As the loop came out of
  the hole, Mr. Brodribb took possession of it, and regardless of my protests,
  proceeded to secure it under his arms.</p>

  <p>"But how the deuce am I going to get down?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Jervis," he replied persuasively. "I'll just have a
  look round and then come up and let you down."</p>

  <p>It being obviously useless to argue, I adjusted the rope and made ready to
  pay out. He climbed down into the pit with astonishing agility, backed into
  the hole and disappeared; and the tension of the rope informed me that he was
  making quite a rapid descent. He had nearly reached the bottom when there
  were borne to my ears the hollow reverberations of what sounded like a cry of
  alarm. But all was apparently well, for the rope continued to draw out
  steadily, and when at last its tension relaxed, I felt an unmistakable signal
  shake, and at once drew it up.</p>

  <p>As my curiosity made me unwilling to remain passively waiting for
  Brodribb's return, I secured the end of the rope to the post with a
  "fisherman's bend" and let myself down into the pit. Advancing to the hole, I
  lay down and put my head over the edge. A dim light from Thorndyke's lamp
  came up the shaft and showed me that we were by no means the first explorers,
  for there were foot-holes cut in the chalk all the way down, apparently of
  some considerable age. With the aid of these and the rope, it appeared quite
  easy to descend and I decided to go down forthwith. Accordingly I backed
  towards the shaft, found the first of the foot-holes, and grasping the rope
  with one hand and using the other to hang on to the upper cavities, easily
  let myself down the well-like shaft. As I neared the bottom the light of the
  lamp was thrown full on the shaft-wall; a pair of hands grasped me and I
  heard Thorndyke's voice saying: "Look where you are treading, Jervis;" on
  which I looked down and saw immediately below me a man lying on his face by
  an irregular coil of rope.</p>

  <p>I stepped down carefully on to the chalk floor and looked round. We were
  in a small chamber in one side of which was the black opening of a low
  tunnel. Thorndyke and Brodribb were standing at the feet of the prostrate
  figure examining a revolver which the solicitor held.</p>

  <p>"It has certainly been fired," said the latter. "One chamber is empty and
  the barrel is foul."</p>

  <p>"That may be," replied Thorndyke; "but there is no bullet wound. This man
  died from a knife wound in the chest." He threw the light of his lamp on the
  corpse and as I turned it partly over to verify his statement, he added:
  "This is poor Mr. Merrill. We found the revolver lying by his side."</p>

  <p>"The cause of death is clear enough," said I, "and it certainly wasn't
  suicide. The question is&mdash;" At this moment Thorndyke stooped and threw a
  beam of light down the tunnel, and Brodribb and I simultaneously uttered an
  exclamation. At the extreme end, about forty feet away, the body of another
  man lay. Instantly Brodribb started forward, and stooping to clear the low
  roof&mdash;it was about four feet six inches high&mdash;hurried along the
  tunnel. Thorndyke and I followed close behind. As we reached the body, which
  was lying supine with a small electric torch by its side, and the light of
  Thorndyke's lamp fell on the upturned face, Brodribb gasped: "God save us!
  it's Crick! And here is the knife." He was about to pick up the weapon when
  Thorndyke put out his hand.</p>

  <p>"That knife," said he, "must be touched by no hand but the one that dealt
  the blow. It may be crucial evidence."</p>

  <p>"Evidence of what?" demanded Brodribb. "There is Merrill with a knife
  wound in his chest and a pistol by his side. Here is Crick with a bullet
  wound in his breast, a knife by his side and the empty sheath secured round
  his waist. What more evidence do you want?"</p>

  <p>"That depends on what you seek to prove," said Thorndyke. "What is your
  interpretation of the facts that you have stated?</p>

  <p>"Why, it is as plain as daylight," answered Brodribb, "incredible as the
  affair seems, having regard to the characters of the two men. Crick stabbed
  Merrill and Merrill shot him dead. Then Merrill tried to escape, but the rope
  broke, he was trapped and he bled to death at the foot of the shaft."</p>

  <p>"And who do you say died first?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>It was a curious question and it caused me to look inquisitively at my
  colleague. But Brodribb answered promptly: "Why, Crick, of course. Here he
  lies where he fell. There is a track of blood along the floor of the tunnel,
  as you can see, and there is Merrill at the entrance, dead in the act of
  trying to escape."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded in a rather mysterious way and there was a brief silence.
  Then I ventured to remark: "You seem to be losing sight of the man with the
  green jacket."</p>

  <p>Brodribb started and looked at me with a frown of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul!" he exclaimed, "so I am. I had clean forgotten him in
  these horrors. But what is your point? Is there any evidence that he has been
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said I. "He bought the rope and he was seen with Merrill
  apparently going towards London Bridge Station. And I gather that it was the
  green jacket that piloted Thorndyke to this place."</p>

  <p>"In a sense," Thorndyke admitted, "that is so. But we will talk about that
  later. Meanwhile there are one or two facts that I will draw your attention
  to. First as to the wounds; they are almost identical in position. Each is on
  the left side, just below the nipple; a vital spot, which would be fully
  exposed by a man who was climbing down holding on to a rope. Then, if you
  look along the floor where I am throwing the light, you can see a distinct
  trace of something having been dragged along, although there seems to have
  been an effort to obliterate it; and the blood marks are more in the nature
  of smears than drops." He gently turned the body over and pointed to the
  back, which was thickly covered with chalk. "This corpse has obviously been
  dragged along the floor," he continued. "It wouldn't have been marked in that
  way by merely falling. Further, the rope, when last seen, was being stuffed
  into a hand-bag. The rope is here, but where is the hand-bag? Finally, the
  rope was cut by some one outside, and evidently after the murders had been
  committed."</p>

  <p>As he concluded, he spread his handkerchief over the knife, and wrapping
  it up carefully without touching it with his fingers, placed it in his
  outside breast-pocket. Then we went back towards the shaft, where Thorndyke
  knelt down by the body of Merrill and systematically emptied the pockets.</p>

  <p>"What are you searching for?" asked Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Keys," was the reply; "and there aren't any. It is a vital point, seeing
  that the man with the green jacket evidently let himself into Merrill's
  chambers that same day."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb agreed with a reflective frown; "it is. But tell us,
  Thorndyke, how you reconstruct this horrible crime."</p>

  <p>"My theory," said Thorndyke, "is that the three men came here together.
  They made the rope fast to the post. The stranger in the green jacket came
  down first and waited at the foot of the shaft. Merrill came down next, and
  the stranger stabbed him just as he reached the bottom, while his arms were
  still up hanging on to the rope. Crick followed and was shot in the same
  place and the same manner. Then the stranger dragged Crick's body along the
  tunnel, swept away the marks as well as he could, put the knife and the lamp
  by the body, dropped the revolver by Merrill's corpse, took the keys and went
  up, sawed through the rope&mdash;probably with a pocket saw&mdash;and threw
  the end down the shaft. Then he took the next train to London and went
  straight to Merrill's chambers, where he opened the safe or other receptacles
  and took possession of what he wanted."</p>

  <p>Brodribb nodded. "It was a diabolically clever scheme," said he.</p>

  <p>"The scheme was ingenious enough," Thorndyke agreed, "but the execution
  was contemptible. He has left traces at every turn. Otherwise we shouldn't be
  here. He has acted on the assumption that the world contains no one but
  fools. But that is a fool's assumption."</p>

  <p>When we had ascended, in the reverse order of our descent, Thorndyke
  detached our rope and also the frayed end, which we took with us, and we then
  took our way back towards the town; and I noted that as we stood by the dene
  hole, there was not a human creature in sight; nor did we meet a single
  person until we were close to the village. It was an ideal spot for a
  murder.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will notify the police?" said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "I shall call on the Chief Constable and give
  him the facts and advise him to keep some of them to himself for the present,
  and also to arrange for an adjournment of the inquest. Our friend with the
  green jacket must be made to think that he has played a trump card."</p>

  <p>Apparently the Chief Constable was a man who knew all the moves of
  criminal investigation, for at the inquest the discovery was attributed to
  the local police acting on information received from somebody who had
  "noticed the broken rope."</p>

  <p>None of us was summoned to give evidence nor were our names mentioned, but
  the inquest was adjourned for three weeks, for further inquiries.</p>

  <p>But in those three weeks there were some singular developments, of which
  the scene was the clerks' office at Mr. Brodribb's premises in Lincoln's Inn.
  There late on a certain forenoon, Thorndyke and I arrived, each provided with
  a bag and a sheaf of documents, and were duly admitted by Mr. Page.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Thorndyke, "are you quite confident, Mr. Page, that you would
  recognise this man, even if he had shaved off his beard and moustache?"</p>

  <p>"Quite confident," replied Page. "I should know him by his eyes. Very
  queer eyes they were; light, greenish grey. And I should know his voice,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Thorndyke; and as Page disappeared into the private office,
  we sat down and examined our documents, eyed furtively by the junior clerk.
  Some ten minutes later the door opened and a man entered; and the first
  glance at him brought my nerves to concert pitch. He was a thick-set,
  muscular man, clean-shaved and rather dark. But my attention was instantly
  arrested by his eyes&mdash;singularly pale eyes which gave an almost unhuman
  character to his face. He reminded me of a certain species of lemur that I
  once saw.</p>

  <p>"I have got an appointment with Mr. Brodribb," he said, addressing the
  clerk. "My name is Horder."</p>

  <p>The clerk slipped off his stool and moved towards the door of the private
  office, but at that moment Page came out. As his eyes met Horder's, he
  stopped dead; and instantly the two men seemed to stiffen like a couple of
  dogs that have suddenly met at a street corner. I watched Horder narrowly. He
  had been rather pale when he came in. Now he was ghastly, and his whole
  aspect indicated extreme nervous tension.</p>

  <p>"Did you wish to see Mr. Brodribb?" asked Page, still gazing intently at
  the other.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the irritable reply; "I have given my name
  once&mdash;Horder."</p>

  <p>Mr. Page turned and re-entered the private office, leaving the door
  ajar.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Horder to see you, sir," I heard him say. He came out and shut the
  door. "If you will sit down, Mr. Brodribb will see you in a minute or two,"
  he said, offering a chair; he then took his hat from a peg, glanced at his
  watch and went out.</p>

  <p>A couple of minutes passed. Once, I thought I heard stealthy footsteps out
  in the entry; but no one came in or knocked. Presently the door of the
  private office opened and a tall gentleman came out. And then, once more, my
  nerves sprang to attention. The tall gentleman was Detective-Superintendent
  Miller.</p>

  <p>The superintendent walked across the office, opened the door, looked out,
  and then, leaving it ajar, came back to where Horder was sitting.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Samuel Horder, I think," said he.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," was the reply. "What about it?"</p>

  <p>"I am a police officer, and I arrest you on a charge of having unlawfully
  entered the premises of the late Reginald Merrill; and it is my duty to
  caution you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Horder, who had risen to his feet, and slipped his right hand under
  the skirt of his coat, made a sudden spring at the officer. But in that
  instant Thorndyke had gripped his right arm at the elbow and wrist and swung
  him round; the superintendent seized his left arm while I pounced upon the
  revolver in his right hand and kept its muzzle pointed to the floor. But it
  was an uncomfortable affair. Our prisoner was a strong man and he fought like
  a wild beast; and he had his finger hooked round the trigger of the revolver.
  The four of us, locked together, gyrated round the office, knocking over
  chairs and bumping against the walls, the junior clerk skipped round the room
  with his eyes glued on the pistol and old Brodribb charged out of his
  sanctum, flourishing a long ruler. However, it did not last long. In the
  midst of the uproar, two massive constables stole in and joined the fray.
  There was a yell from the prisoner, the revolver rattled to the floor and
  then I heard two successive metallic clicks.</p>

  <p>"He'll be all right now," murmured the constable who had fixed on the
  handcuffs, with the manner of one who has administered a soothing remedy.</p>

  <p>"I notice," said Thorndyke, when the prisoner had been removed, "that you
  charged him only with unlawful entry."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miller, "until we have taken his finger-prints. Mr.
  Singleton has developed up three fingers and a thumb, beautifully clear, on
  that knife that you gave us. If they prove to be Horder's finger prints, of
  course, it is a true bill for the murder."</p>

  <p>The finger-prints on the knife proved undoubtedly to be Horder's. But the
  case did not rest on them alone. When his rooms were searched, there were
  found not only Mr. Merrill's keys but also Mr. Merrill's second will, which
  had been missed from the safe when it was opened by the maker's locksmith;
  thus illustrating afresh the perverse stupidity of the criminal mind.</p>

  <p>"A satisfactory case," remarked Thorndyke, "in respect of the result; but
  there was too much luck for us to take much credit from it. On Brodribb's
  opening statement, it was pretty clear that a crime had been committed.
  Merrill was missing and someone had possession of his keys and had entered
  his premises. It also appeared nearly certain that the thing stolen must be
  the second will, since there was nothing else of value to steal; and the will
  was of very great value to two persons, Crick and Horder, to each of whom its
  destruction was worth many thousands of pounds. To both of them its value was
  conditional on the immediate death of Merrill, before another will could be
  made; and to Horder it was further conditional on the death of Crick and that
  he should die before Merrill&mdash;for otherwise the estate would go to
  Crick's heirs or next of kin. The prima facie suspicion therefore fell on
  these two men. But Crick was missing; and the question was, had he absconded
  or was he dead?</p>

  <p>"And now as to the investigation. The green jacket showed earthy dust and
  chalk on the front and chalk-marks on the buttons. The indication was that
  the wearer had either crawled on chalky ground or climbed up a chalky face.
  But the marks on the buttons suggested climbing; for a horizontal surface is
  usually covered by soil, whereas on a vertical surface the chalk is exposed.
  But the time factor showed us that this man could not have travelled far from
  London. He was seen going towards London Bridge Station about the time when a
  train was due to go down to Kent. That train went to Maidstone and
  Gillingham, calling at Gravesend, Strood, Snodland, Rochester, Chatham and
  other places abounding in chalk and connected with the cement industry. In
  that district there were no true cliffs, but there were numerous chalk-pits,
  railway embankments and other excavations. The evidence pointed to one of
  these excavations. Then Crick was known to have gone to
  Rochester&mdash;earlier in the day&mdash;which further suggested the
  district, though Rochester is the least chalky part of it.</p>

  <p>"The question was, what kind of excavation had been climbed into? And for
  what purpose had the climbing been performed? But here the personality of the
  missing man gave us a hint. Merrill had written a book to prove that dene
  holes were simply prehistoric flint-mines. He had explored a number of dene
  holes and described them in his book. Now the district through which this
  train had passed was peculiarly rich in dene holes; and then there was the
  suggestive fact that Merrill had been last seen coming out of a rope-seller's
  shop. This latter fact was so important that I followed it up at once by
  calling at Edginton's. There I ascertained that Merrill or his companion had
  bought a fifteen-fathom length of deep-sea lead-line. Now this was profoundly
  significant. The maximum depth of a dene hole is about seventy feet. Fifteen
  fathoms&mdash;ninety feet&mdash;is therefore the exact length required,
  allowing for loops and fastenings. This new fact converted the dene-hole
  hypothesis into what was virtually a certainty, especially when one
  considered how readily these dangerous pits lent themselves either to fatal
  accidents or to murder. I accordingly adopted the dene-hole suggestion as a
  working hypothesis.</p>

  <p>"The next question was, 'Where was this dene-hole?' And an uncommonly
  difficult question it was. I began to fear that the inquiry would fail from
  the impossibility of solving it. But at this point I got some help from a new
  quarter. I had given the coat to Polton to extract the dust and I had told
  him to wash the little lumps of chalk for foraminifera."</p>

  <p>"What are foraminifera?" asked Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"They are minute sea shells. Chalk is largely composed of them; and
  although chalk is in no sense a local rock, there is nevertheless a good deal
  of variation in the species of foraminifera found in different localities. So
  I had the chalk washed out as a matter of routine. Well, the dust was
  confirmatory but not illuminating. There was railway dust, of the South
  Eastern type&mdash;I expect you know it&mdash;chalk, loam dust, pollen-grains
  of the mallow and valerian (which grows in chalk-pits and railway cuttings)
  and some wing scales of the common blue butterfly, which haunts the
  chalk&mdash;I expect he had touched a dead butterfly. But all this would have
  answered for a good part of Kent. Then I examined the foraminifera and
  identified the species by the plates in Warnford's Monograph. The result was
  most encouraging. There were nine species in all, and of these five were
  marked as 'found in the Gravesend chalk,' two more 'from the Kentish chalk'
  and the other two 'from the English chalk.' This was a very striking result.
  More than half the contained foraminifera were from the Gravesend chalk.</p>

  <p>"The problem now was to determine the geologic meaning of the term
  Gravesend. I ruled out Rochester, as I had heard of no dene holes in that
  neighbourhood, and I consulted Merrill's book and the large-scale Ordnance
  map. Merrill had worked in the Gravesend district and the adjacent part of
  Essex and he gave a list of the dene holes that he had explored, including
  the Clapper Napper Hole in Swanscombe Wood. But, checking his list by the
  Ordnance map, I found that there was one dene hole marked on the map which
  was not in his list. As it was evidently necessary to search all the dene
  holes in the district, I determined to begin with the one that he seemed to
  have missed. And there luck favoured us. It turned out to be the right
  one."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that there was much luck in it," said Brodribb. "You
  calculated the probabilities and adopted the greatest."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Thorndyke, "there was Merrill and there was Crick; and
  as soon as I saw them I knew that Horder was the murderer. For the whole
  tableau had obviously been arranged to demonstrate that Crick died before
  Merrill and establish Horder as Merrill's heir."</p>

  <p>"A diabolical plot," commented Brodribb. "Horribly ingenious, too. By the
  way&mdash;which of them did die first in your opinion?"</p>

  <p>"Merrill, I should say, undoubtedly," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"That will be good hearing for Crick's next of kin," said Brodribb. "And
  you haven't done with this case yet, Thorndyke. I shall retain you on the
  question of survivorship."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="c3"
     id="c3"></a>III. &mdash; THE SEAL OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR</h2>

  <p class="first">"I SUPPOSE, Thorndyke," said I, "footprints yield quite a
  lot of information if you think about them enough?"</p>

  <p>The question was called forth by the circumstance of my friend halting and
  stooping to examine the little pit made in the loamy soil of the path by the
  walking stick of some unknown wayfarer. Ever since we had entered this
  path&mdash;to which we had been directed by the station-master of Pinwell
  Junction as a short cut to our destination&mdash;I had noticed my friend
  scanning its surface, marked with numerous footprints, as if he were mentally
  reconstructing the personalities of the various travellers who had trodden it
  before us. This I knew to be a habit of his, almost unconsciously pursued;
  and the present conditions certainly favoured it, for here, as the path
  traversed a small wood, the slightly moist, plastic surface took impressions
  with the sharpness of moulding wax.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, "but you must do more than think. You need to train
  your eyes to observe in conspicuous characteristics."</p>

  <p>"Such as these, for instance," said. I, with a grin, pointing to a blatant
  print of a Cox's "Invicta" rubber sole with its prancing-horse
  trade-mark.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled. "A man," said he, "who wears a sole like that is a mere
  advertising agent. He who runs may read those characteristics, but as there
  are thousands of persons wearing 'Invicta' soles, the observation merely
  identifies the wearer as a member of a large genus. It has to be carried a
  good deal further to identify him as an individual; otherwise, a standardised
  sole is apt to be rather misleading than helpful. Its gross distinctiveness
  tends to divert the novice's attention from the more specific characteristics
  which he would seek in a plain footprint like that of this man's
  companion."</p>

  <p>"Why companion?" I asked. "The two men were walking the same way, but what
  evidence is there that they were companions?"</p>

  <p>"A good deal, if you follow the series of tracks, as I have been doing. In
  the first place, there is the stride. Both men were rather tall, as shown by
  the size of their feet, but both have a distinctly short stride. Now the
  leather-soled man's short stride is accounted for by the way in which he put
  down his stick. He held it stiffly, leaning upon it to some extent and
  helping himself with it. There is one impression of the stick to every two
  paces; every impression of his left foot has a stick impression opposite to
  it. The suggestion is that he was old, weak or infirm. But the rubber-soled
  man walked with his stick in the ordinary way&mdash;one stick impression to
  every four paces. His abnormally short stride is not to be accounted for
  excepting by the assumption that he stepped short to keep pace with the other
  man.</p>

  <p>"Then the two sets of footprints are usually separate. Neither man has
  trodden nor set his stick on the other man's tracks, excepting in those
  places where the path is too narrow for them to walk abreast, and there, in
  the one case I noticed the rubber soles treading on the prints of the leather
  soles, whereas at this spot the prints of the leather soles are imposed on
  those of the rubber soles. That, of course, is conclusive evidence that the
  two men were here at the same time."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that settles the question without troubling about the
  stride. But after all, Thorndyke, this is a matter of reasoning, as I said;
  of thinking about the footprints and their meaning. No special acuteness of
  observation or training of vision comes into it. The mere facts are obvious
  enough; it is their interpretation that yields the knowledge."</p>

  <p>"That is true so far," said he, "but we haven't exhausted our material.
  Look carefully at the impressions of the two sticks and tell me if you see
  anything remarkable in either of them?"</p>

  <p>I stooped and examined the little pits that the two sticks had made in the
  path, and, to tell the truth, found them extremely unilluminating.</p>

  <p>"They seem very much alike," I said. "The rubber-soled man's stick is
  rather larger than the other and the leather-soled man's stick has made
  deeper holes&mdash;probably because it was smaller and he was leaning on it
  more heavily."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "You've missed the point, Anstey, and you've
  missed it because you have failed to observe the visible facts. It is quite a
  neat point, too, and might in certain circumstances be a very important
  one."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said I. "What is the point?"</p>

  <p>"That," said he, "I shall leave you to infer from the visible facts, which
  are these: first, the impressions of the smaller stick are on the right-hand
  side of the man who made them, and second, that each impression is shallowest
  towards the front and the right-hand side."</p>

  <p>I examined the impressions carefully and verified Thorndyke's
  statement.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "what about it? What does it prove?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled in his exasperating fashion. "The proof," said he, "is
  arrived at by reasoning from the facts. My learned friend has the facts. If
  he will consider them, the conclusion will emerge."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "I don't see your drift. The impression is shallower on one
  side, I suppose, because the ferrule of the stick was worn away on that side.
  But I repeat, what about it? Do you expect me to infer why the fool that it
  belonged to wore his stick away all at one side?"</p>

  <p>"Now, don't get irritable, Anstey," said he. "Preserve a philosophic calm.
  I assure you that this is quite an interesting problem."</p>

  <p>"So it may be," I replied. "But I'm hanged if I can imagine why he wore
  his stick down in that way. However, it doesn't really matter. It isn't my
  stick&mdash;and by Jingo, here is old Brodribb&mdash;caught us in the act of
  wasting our time on academic chin-wags and delaying his business. The debate
  is adjourned."</p>

  <p>Our discussion had brought us to the opening of the wood, which now framed
  the figure of the solicitor. As he caught sight of us, he hurried forward,
  holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good men and true!" he exclaimed. "I thought you would probably come this
  way, and it is very good of you to have come at all, especially as it is a
  mere formality."</p>

  <p>"What is?" asked Thorndyke. "Your telegram spoke of an 'alleged suicide.'
  I take it that there is some ground for inquiry?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that there is," replied Brodribb. "But the deceased was
  insured for three thousand pounds, which will be lost to the estate if the
  suicide is confirmed. So I put it to my fellow that it was worth an expert's
  fee to make sure whether or not things are what they seem. A verdict of death
  by misadventure will save us three thousand pounds. Verbum sap." As he
  concluded, the old lawyer winked with exaggerated cunning and stuck his elbow
  into my ribs.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke ignored the facetious suggestion of bribery and corruption and
  inquired dryly: "What are the circumstances of the case?"</p>

  <p>"I'd better give you a sketch of them before we get to the house," replied
  Brodribb. "The dead man is Martin Rowlands, the brother of my neighbour in
  New Square, Tom Rowlands. Poor old Tom found the telegram waiting when he got
  to his office this morning and immediately rushed into my office with it and
  begged me to come down here with him. So I came. Couldn't refuse a brother
  solicitor. He's waiting at the house now.</p>

  <p>"The circumstances are these. Last evening, when he had finished dinner,
  Rowlands went out for a walk. That is his usual habit in the summer
  months&mdash;it is light until nearly half-past nine nowadays. Well, that is
  the last time he was seen alive by the servants. No one saw him come in. But
  there was nothing unusual in that, for he had a private entrance to the
  annexe in which his library, museum and workrooms were situated, and when he
  returned from his walk, he usually entered the house that way and went
  straight to his study or workroom and spent the evening there. So the
  servants very seldom saw him after dinner.</p>

  <p>"Last night he evidently followed his usual custom. But, this morning,
  when the housemaid went to his bedroom with his morning tea, she was
  astonished to find the room empty and the bed undisturbed. She at once
  reported to the housekeeper, and the pair made their way to the annexe. There
  they found the study door locked, and as there was no answer after repeated
  knockings, they went out into the grounds to reconnoitre. The study window
  was closed and fastened, but the workroom window was unbolted, so that they
  were able to open it from outside. Then the housemaid climbed in and went to
  the side door, which she opened and admitted the housekeeper. The two went to
  the workroom, and as the door which communicated with the study was open,
  they were able to enter the latter, and there they found Martin Rowlands,
  sitting in an arm-chair by the table, stone-dead, cold and stiff. On the
  table were a whisky decanter, a siphon of soda water, a box of cigars, an
  ash-bowl with the stump of a cigar in it, and a bottle of photographic
  tabloids of cyanide of potassium.</p>

  <p>"The housekeeper immediately sent off for a doctor and dispatched a
  telegram to Tom Rowlands at his office. The doctor arrived about nine and
  decided that the deceased had been dead about twelve hours. The cause of
  death was apparently cyanide poisoning, but, of course, that will be
  ascertained or disproved by the post-mortem. Those are all the known facts at
  present. The doctor helped the servants to place the body on a sofa, but as
  it is as stiff as a frozen sheep, they might as well have left it where it
  was."</p>

  <p>"Have the police been communicated with?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Brodribb. "There were no suspicious circumstances, so far as
  any of us could see, and I don't know that I should have felt justified in
  sending for you&mdash;though I always like to have Thorndyke's opinion in a
  case of sudden death&mdash;if it had not been for the insurance."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded. "It looks like a straightforward case of suicide," said
  he. "As to the state of deceased's affairs, his brother will be able to give
  us any necessary information, I suppose?</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Brodribb. "As a matter of fact, I think Martin has been a
  bit worried just lately; but Tom will tell you about that. This is the
  place."</p>

  <p>We turned in at a gateway that opened into the grounds of a substantial
  though unpretentious house, and as we approached the front door, it was
  opened by a fresh-coloured, white-haired man whom we both knew pretty well in
  our professional capacities. He greeted us cordially, and though he was
  evidently deeply shocked by the tragedy, struggled to maintain a calm,
  business-like manner.</p>

  <p>"It is good of you to come down," said he; "but I am afraid we have
  troubled you rather unnecessarily. Still, Brodribb thought it best&mdash;ex
  abundanti cautela, you know&mdash;to have the circumstances reviewed by a
  competent authority. There is nothing abnormal in the affair excepting its
  having happened. My poor brother was the sanest of men, I should say, and we
  are not a suicidal family. I suppose you had better see the body first?"</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke assented, he conducted us to the end of the hall and into the
  annexe, where we entered the study, the door of which was now open, though
  the key was still in the lock. The table still bore the things that Brodribb
  had described, but the chair was empty, and its late occupant lay on a sofa,
  covered with a large table-cloth. Thorndyke advanced to the sofa and gently
  drew away the cloth, revealing the body of a man, fully dressed, lying
  stiffly and awkwardly on its back with the feet raised and the stiffened
  limbs extended. There was something strangely and horribly artificial in the
  aspect of the corpse, for, though it was lying down, it had the posture of a
  seated figure, and thus bore the semblance of a hideously realistic effigy
  which had been picked up from a chair and laid down. I stood looking at it
  from a little distance with a layman's distaste for the presence of a dead
  body, but still regarding it with attention and some curiosity. Presently my
  glance fell on the soles of the shoes&mdash;which were, indeed, exhibited
  plainly enough&mdash;and I noted, as an odd coincidence that they were
  "Invicta" rubber soles, like those which we had just been discussing in the
  wood; that it was even possible that those very footprints had been made by
  the feet of this grisly figure.</p>

  <p>"I expect, Thorndyke," Brodribb said tactfully, "you would rather make
  your inspection alone. If you should want us, you will find us in the dining
  room," and with this he retired, taking Mr. Rowlands with him.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were gone I drew Thorndyke's attention to the rubber
  soles.</p>

  <p>"It is a queer thing," said I, "but we may have actually been discussing
  this poor fellow's own prints."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, we were," he replied, pointing to a drawing-pin that
  had been trodden on and had stuck into one of the rubber heels. "I noticed
  this at the time, and apparently you did not, which illustrates what I was
  saying about the tendency of these very distinctive types of sole to distract
  attention from those individual peculiarities which are the ones that really
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "if they were his footprints, the man with the remarkable
  stick was with him. I wonder who he was. Some neighbour who was walking home
  from the station with him, I expect."</p>

  <p>"Probably," said Thorndyke, "and as the prints were quite
  recent&mdash;they might even have been made last night&mdash;that person may
  be wanted as a witness at the inquest as the last person who saw deceased
  alive. That depends on the time the prints were made."</p>

  <p>He walked back to the sofa and inspected the corpse very methodically,
  giving close attention to the mouth and hands. Then he made a general
  inspection of the room, examined the objects on the table and the floor under
  it, strayed into the adjoining workshop, where he peered into the deep
  laboratory sink, took an empty tumbler from a shelf, held it up to the light
  and inspected the shelf&mdash;where a damp ring showed that the tumbler had
  been put there to drain&mdash;and from the workshop wandered into a little
  lobby and from thence out at the side door, down the flagged path to the side
  gate and back again.</p>

  <p>"It is all very negative," he remarked discontentedly, as we returned to
  the study, "except that bottle of tabloids, which is pretty positive evidence
  of premeditation. That looks like a fresh box of cigars. Two missing. One
  stump in the ash-tray and more ash than one cigar would account for. However,
  let us go into the dining and hear what Rowlands has to tell us," and with
  this he walked out and crossed the hall and I followed him.</p>

  <p>As we entered the dining the two men looked at us and Brodribb asked:
  "Well, what is the verdict?"</p>

  <p>"At present," Thorndyke replied, "it is an open verdict. Nothing has come
  to light that disagrees with the obvious appearances. But I should like to
  hear more of the antecedents of the tragedy. You were saying that deceased
  had been somewhat worried lately. What does that amount to?"</p>

  <p>"It amounts to nothing," said Rowlands "at least, I should have thought
  so, in the case of a level-headed man like my brother. Still as it is all
  there is, so far as I know, to account for what has happened, I had better
  give you the story. It seems trivial enough.</p>

  <p>"Some short time ago, a Major Cohen, who had just come home from
  Mesopotamia, sold to a dealer named Lyon a small gold cylinder seal that he
  had picked up in the neighbourhood of Baghdad. The Lord knows how he came by
  it, but he had it and he showed it to Lyon, who bought it of him for a matter
  of twenty pounds. Cohen, of course, knew nothing about the thing, and Lyon
  didn't know much more, for although he is a dealer, he is no expert. But he
  is a very clever faker&mdash;or rather, I should say, restorer, for he does
  quite a legitimate trade. He was a jeweller and watch-jobber originally, a
  most ingenious workman, and his line is to buy up damaged antiques and
  restore them. Then he sells them to minor collectors, though quite honestly
  as restorations, so I oughtn't to call him a faker. But, as I said, he has no
  real knowledge of antiques, and all he saw in Cohen's seal was a gold
  cylinder seal, apparently ancient and genuine, and on that he bought it for
  about twice the value of the gold and thought no more about it.</p>

  <p>"About a fortnight later, my brother Martin went to his shop in Petty
  France, Westminster, to get some repairs done, and Lyon, knowing that my
  brother was a collector of Babylonian antiquities, showed him the seal; and
  Martin, seeing at once that it was genuine and a thing of some interest and
  value, bought it straight-way for forty pounds without examining it at all
  minutely, as it was obviously worth that much in any case. But when he got
  home and took a rolled impression of it on moulding wax, he made a most
  astonishing discovery. The impression showed a mass of minute cuneiformic
  characters, and on deciphering these he learned with amazement and delight
  that this was none other than the seal of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

  <p>"Hardly able to believe in his good fortune, he hurried off to the British
  Museum and showed his treasure to the Keeper of the Babylonian Antiquities,
  who fully confirmed the identity of the seal and was naturally eager to
  acquire it for the Museum. Of course, Martin wouldn't sell it, but he allowed
  the keeper to take a record of its weight and measurements and to make an
  impression on clay to exhibit in the case of seal-rollings.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, it seems that Cohen, before disposing of the seal, had amused
  himself by making a number of rolled impressions on clay. Some of these he
  took to Lyon, who bought them for a few shillings and put one of them in his
  shop window as a curio. There it was seen and recognised by an American
  Assyriologist, who went in and bought it and then began to question Lyon
  closely as to whence he had obtained it. The dealer made no secret of the
  matter, but gave Cohen's name and address, saying nothing, however, about the
  seal. In fact, he was unaware of the connection between the seal and the
  rollings as Cohen had sold him the latter as genuine clay tablets which he
  said he had found in Mesopotamia. But, of course, the expert saw that it was
  a recent rolling and that someone must have the seal.</p>

  <p>"Accordingly, off he went to Cohen and questioned him closely, whereupon
  Cohen began to smell a rat. He admitted that he had had the seal, but refused
  to say what had become of it until the expert told him what it was and how
  much it was worth. This the expert did, very reluctantly and in strict
  confidence, and when Cohen learned that it was the seal of Nebuchadnezzar and
  that it was worth anything up to ten thousand pounds, he nearly fainted; and
  then he and the expert together bustled off to Lyon's shop.</p>

  <p>"But now Lyon smelt a rat, too. He refused absolutely to disclose the
  whereabouts of the seal; and having, by now, guessed that the seal-rollings
  were those of the seal, he took one of them to the British Museum, and then,
  of course, the murder was out. And further to complicate the matter, the
  Assyriologist, Professor Bateman, seems to have talked freely to his American
  friends at his hotel, with the result that Lyon's shop was besieged by
  wealthy American collectors, all roaring for the seal and all perfectly
  regardless of cost. Finally, as they could get no change out of Lyon, they
  went to the British Museum, where they learned that my brother had the seal
  and got his address&mdash;or rather mine, for he had, fortunately for
  himself, given my office as his address. Then they proceeded to bombard him
  with letters, as also did Cohen and Lyon.</p>

  <p>"It was an uncomfortable situation. Cohen was like a madman. He swore that
  Lyon had swindled him and he demanded to have the seal returned or the proper
  price paid. Lyon, for his part, went about like a roaring lion of Judah,
  making a similar demand; and the millionaire collectors offered wild sums for
  the seal. Poor Martin was very much worried about it. He was particularly
  unhappy about Cohen, who had actually found the seal and who was a disabled
  soldier&mdash;he had been wounded in both legs and was permanently lame. As
  to Lyon, he had no grievance, for he was a dealer and it was his business to
  know the value of his own stock; but still it was hard luck even on him. And
  then there were the collectors, pestering him daily with entreaties and
  extravagant offers. It was very worrying for him. They would probably have
  come down here to see him, but he kept his private address a close
  secret.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he meant to do about it. What he did was to arrange
  with me for the loan of my private office and have a field day, interviewing
  the whole lot of them&mdash;Lyon, the Professor and the assorted
  millionaires. That was three days ago, and the whole boiling of them turned
  up; and by the same token one of them was the kind of pestilent fool that
  walks off with the wrong hat or umbrella."</p>

  <p>"Did he walk off with your hat?" asked Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"No, but he took my stick; a nice old stick that belonged to my
  father."</p>

  <p>"What sort of stick did he leave in its place?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Rowlands, "I must admit that there was some excuse, for
  the stick that he left was almost a facsimile of my own. I don't think I
  should have noticed it but for the feel. When I began to walk with it, I was
  aware of something unusual in the feel of it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was not quite the same length as yours," Thorndyke
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, it wasn't that," said Rowlands. "The length was all right, but there
  was some more subtle difference. Possibly, as I am left-handed and carry my
  stick on the left side, it may in the course of years have acquired a
  left-handed bias, if such a thing is possible. I'll go and get the stick for
  you to see."</p>

  <p>He went out of the room and returned in a few moments with an
  old-fashioned Malacca cane, the ivory handle of which was secured by a broad
  silver band. Thorndyke took it from him and looked it over with a degree of
  interest and attention that rather surprised me. For the loss of Rowlands'
  stick was a trivial incident and no concern of ours. Nevertheless, my
  colleague inspected it most methodically, handle, silver band and ferrule;
  especially the ferrule, which he examined as if it were quite a rare and
  curious object.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about your stick, Tom," said Brodribb with a
  mischievous smile. "Thorndyke will get it back if you ask him nicely."</p>

  <p>"It oughtn't to be very difficult," said Thorndyke, handing back the
  stick, "if you have a list of the visitors who called that day."</p>

  <p>"Their names will be in the appointments book," said Rowlands. "I must
  look them up. Some of them I remember&mdash;Cohen, Lyon, Bateman and two or
  three of the collectors. But to return to our history. I don't know what
  passed at the interviews or what Martin intended to do, but I have no doubt
  he made some notes on the subject. I must search for them, for, of course, we
  shall have to dispose of the seal."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "where is the seal?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it is here in the safe," replied Rowlands; "and it oughtn't to be.
  It should have been taken to the bank."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is no doubt that it is in the safe?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Rowlands; "at least&mdash;" He stood up suddenly. "I haven't
  seen it," he said. "Perhaps we had better make sure."</p>

  <p>He led the way quickly to the study, where he halted and stood looking at
  the shrouded corpse. "The key will be in his pocket," he said, almost in a
  whisper. Then, slowly and reluctantly, he approached the sofa, and gently
  drawing away the cover from the body, began to search the dead man's
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he said at length, producing a bunch of keys and separating
  one, which he apparently knew. He crossed to the safe, and inserting the key,
  threw open the door.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed with evident relief, "it is all right.. Your question
  gave me quite a start. Is it necessary to open the packet?"</p>

  <p>He held out a little sealed parcel on which was written "The Seal of
  Nebuchadnezzar," and looked inquiringly at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"You spoke of making sure," the latter replied with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it would be best," said Rowlands; and with that, he cut
  the thread with which it was fastened, broke the seal and opened the package,
  disclosing a small cardboard box in which lay a cylindrical object rolled up
  in a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>Rowlands picked it out, and removing the paper, displayed a little
  cylinder of gold pitted all over with minute cuneiform characters. It was
  about an inch and a quarter long by half an inch thick and had a hole bored
  through its axis from end to end.</p>

  <p>"This paper, I see," said Rowlands, "contains a copy of the keeper's
  description of the seal&mdash;its weight, dimensions and so on. We may as
  well take care of that."</p>

  <p>He handed the little cylinder to Thorndyke, who held it delicately in his
  fingers and looked at it with a gravely reflective air. Indeed, small as it
  was, there was something very impressive in its appearance and in the thought
  that it had been handled by and probably worn on the person of the great king
  in those remote, almost mythical times, so familiar and yet so immeasurably
  far away. So I reflected as I watched Thorndyke inspecting the venerable
  little object in his queer, exact, scientific way, examining the minute
  characters through his lens, scrutinising the ends and even peering through
  the central hole.</p>

  <p>"I notice," he said, glancing at the paper which Rowlands held, "that the
  keeper has given only one transverse diameter, apparently assuming that it is
  a true cylinder. But it isn't. The diameter varies. It is not quite circular
  in section and the sides are not perfectly parallel."</p>

  <p>He produced his pocket calliper-gauge, and, closing the jaws on the
  cylinder, took the reading of the vernier. Then he turned the cylinder, on
  which the gauge became visibly out of contact.</p>

  <p>"There is a difference of nearly two millimetres," he said when he had
  again closed the gauge and taken the reading.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Thorndyke," said Brodribb, "that keeper hadn't got your
  mathematically exact eye; and, in fact, the precise measurements don't seem
  to matter much."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," retorted Thorndyke, "inexact measurements are of no
  use at all."</p>

  <p>When we had all handled and inspected the seal, Rowlands repacked it and
  returned it to the safe, and we went back to the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," said Brodribb, "how does the insurance question stand?
  What is our position?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Thorndyke replied, "that we will leave the question open until
  the inquest has been held. You must insist on an expert analysis, and perhaps
  that may throw fresh light on the matter. And now we must be off to the
  station. I expect you have plenty to do."</p>

  <p>"We have," said Brodribb, "so I won't offer to walk with you. You know the
  way."</p>

  <p>Politely but firmly declining Rowlands' offer of material hospitality,
  Thorndyke took up his research-case, and having shaken hands with our hosts,
  we followed them to the door and took our departure.</p>

  <p>"Not a very satisfactory case," I remarked as we set forth along the road,
  "but you can't make a bull's-eye every time."</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed; "you can only observe and note the facts. Which reminds
  me that we have some data to collect in the wood. I shall take casts of those
  footprints in case they should turn out to be of importance. It is always a
  useful precaution, seeing that footprints are fugitive."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me an excessive precaution, but I made no comment; and when
  we arrived at the footpath through the wood and he had selected the sharpest
  footprints, I watched him take out from his case the plaster-tin,
  water-bottle, spoon and little rubber bowl, and wondered what was in his
  mind. The "Invicta" footprints were obviously those of the dead man. But what
  if they were? And of what use were the casts of the other man's feet? The man
  was unknown, and as far as I could see, there was nothing suspicious in his
  presence here. But when Thorndyke had poured the liquid plaster into the two
  pairs of footprints, he went on to a still more incomprehensible proceeding.
  Mixing some fresh plaster, he filled up with it two adjoining impressions of
  the strange man's stick. Then, taking a reel of thread from the case, he cut
  off about two yards, and stretching it taut, held it exactly across the
  middle of the two holes, until the plaster set and fixed it in position.
  After waiting for the plaster to set hard, and having, meanwhile, taken up
  and packed the casts of the footprints, he gently raised, first the one and
  then the other cast; each of which was a snowy-white facsimile of the tip of
  the stick which had made the impression the two casts, being joined by a
  length of thread which gave the exact distance apart of the two
  impressions.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, as he made a pencil mark on one of the casts, "the
  thread is to show the length of the stride?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "It is to show the exact direction in which the man was
  walking and to mark the front and back of the stick."</p>

  <p>I could make nothing of this. It was highly ingenious, but what on earth
  was the use of it? What could it possibly prove?</p>

  <p>I put a few tentative questions, but could get no explanation beyond the
  obvious truth that it was of no use to postpone the collection of evidence
  until after the event. What event he was referring to, I did not gather; nor
  was I any further enlightened when, on arriving at Victoria, he hailed a
  taxicab and directed the driver to set him down at Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"You had better not wait," he said, as he got out. "I have some business
  to talk over with Miller or the Assistant Commissioner and may be detained
  some time. But I shall be at home all the evening."</p>

  <p>Taking this as an invitation to drop in at his chambers, I did so after
  dinner and made another ineffectual attempt to pump him.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to be so evasive," said he, "but this case is so extremely
  speculative that I cannot come to any definite conclusion until I have more
  data. I may have been theorising in the air. But I am going forth to-morrow
  morning at half-past eight in the hope of putting some of my inferences to
  the test. If my learned friend would care to lend his distinguished support
  to the expedition, his society would be appreciated. But it will be a case of
  passive observation and quite possibly nothing will happen."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will come and look on," said I. "Passive observation is my
  speciality;" and with this I took my departure, rather more mystified than
  ever.</p>

  <p>Punctually, next morning at half-past eight, I arrived at the entry of
  Thorndyke's chambers. A taxicab was already waiting at the kerb, and, as I
  stepped on the threshold, my colleague appeared on the stairs. Together we
  entered the cab which at once moved off, and proceeding down Middle Temple
  Lane to the Embankment, headed westward. Our first stopping-place was New
  Scotland Yard, but there Thorndyke remained only a minute or two. Our further
  progress was in the direction of Westminster, and in a few minutes we drew up
  at the corner of Petty France, where we alighted and paid off the taxi.
  Sauntering slowly westward and passing a large, covered car that was drawn up
  by the pavement, we presently encountered no less a person than Mr.
  Superintendent Miller, dressed in the height of fashion and smoking a cigar.
  The meeting was not, apparently, unexpected, for Miller began, without
  preamble: "It's all right, so far, doctor, unless we are too late. It will be
  an awful suck-in if we are. Two plain-clothes men have been here ever since
  you called yesterday evening, and nothing has happened yet."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't treat it as a certainty, Miller," said Thorndyke. "We are
  only acting on reasonable probabilities. But it may be a false shot, after
  all."</p>

  <p>Miller smiled indulgently. "I know, sir. I've heard you say that sort of
  thing before. At any rate, he's there at present; I saw him just now through
  the shop window&mdash;and, by gum! here he is!"</p>

  <p>I followed the superintendent's glance and saw a tallish, elderly man
  advancing on the opposite side of the street. He walked stiffly with the aid
  of a stick and with a pronounced stoop as if suffering from some weakness of
  the back, and he carried in his free hand a small wooden case suspended by a
  rug-strap. But what instantly attracted my attention was his walking-stick,
  which appeared, so far as I could remember, to be an exact replica of the one
  that Tom Rowlands had shown us.</p>

  <p>We continued to walk westward, allowing Mr. Lyon&mdash;as I assumed him to
  be&mdash;to pass us. Then we turned back and followed at a little distance;
  and I noticed that two tall, military-looking men whom we had met kept close
  behind us. At the corner of Petty France Mr. Lyon hailed a taxicab; and
  Miller quickened his pace and bore down on the big covered car.</p>

  <p>"Jump in," he said, opening the door as Lyon entered the cab. "We mustn't
  lose sight of him," and with this he fairly shoved Thorndyke and me into the
  car, and having spoken a word to the driver, stepped in himself and was
  followed by the two plain-clothes men. The car started forward, and having
  made a spurt which brought it within a few yards of the taxi, slowed down to
  the pace of the latter and followed it through the increasing traffic until
  we turned into Whitehall, where our driver allowed the taxi to draw ahead
  somewhat. At Charing Cross, however, we closed up and kept immediately behind
  our quarry in the dense traffic of the Strand; and when it turned to cross
  opposite the Acropolis Hotel, we still followed and swept past it in the
  hotel courtyard so that we reached the main entrance first. By the time that
  Mr. Lyon had paid his fare we had already entered and were waiting in the
  hall of the hotel.</p>

  <p>As he followed us in, he paused and looked about him until his glance fell
  on a stoutish, clean-shaved man who was sitting in a wicker chair, who, on
  catching his eye, rose and advanced towards him. At this moment
  Superintendent Miller touched him on the shoulder, causing him to spin round
  with an expression of very distinct alarm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maurice Lyon, I think," said Miller. "I am a detective officer." He
  paused and looked hard at the dealer, who had turned deathly pale. Then he
  continued: "You are carrying a walking-stick which I believe is not your
  property."</p>

  <p>Lyon gave a gasp of relief. "You are quite right," said he. "But I don't
  know whose property it is. If you do, I shall be pleased to return it in
  exchange for my own, which I left by mistake."</p>

  <p>He held it out in an irresolute fashion, and Miller took it from him and
  handed it to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Is that the stick?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked the stick over quickly, and then, inverting it, made a
  minute examination of the ferrule, finishing up by taking its dimensions in
  two diameters and comparing the results with some written notes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lyon fidgeted impatiently. "There's no need for all this fuss," said
  he. "I have told you that the stick is not mine."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Miller, "but we must have a few words privately about
  that stick."</p>

  <p>Here he turned to an hotel official, who had just arrived under the
  guidance of one of the plain-clothes men, and who suggested rather anxiously
  that our business would be better transacted in a private room at the back of
  the building than in the public hall. He was just moving off to show us the
  way when the clean-shaved stranger edged up to Lyon and extended his hand
  towards the wooden case.</p>

  <p>"Shall I take this?" he asked suavely.</p>

  <p>"Not just now, sir," said Miller, firmly fending him off. "Mr. Lyon will
  talk to you presently."</p>

  <p>"But that case is my property," the other objected truculently; "and who
  are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I am a police officer," replied Miller. "But if that is your property,
  you had better come with us and keep an eye on it."</p>

  <p>I have never seen a man look more uncomfortable than did the owner of that
  case&mdash;with the exception of Mr. Lyon; whose complexion had once more
  taken on a tallowy whiteness. But as the manager led the way to the back of
  the hall the two men followed silently, shepherded by the superintendent and
  the rest of our party, until we reached a small, marble-floored lobby or
  ante-room, when our conductor shut us in and retired.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Miller, "I want to know what is in that case."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you," said the stranger. "It is a piece of sculpture, and it
  belongs to me."</p>

  <p>Miller nodded. "Let us have a look at it," said he.</p>

  <p>There being no table, Lyon sat down on a chair, and resting the case on
  his knees, unfastened the straps with trembling fingers on which a drop of
  sweat fell now and again from his forehead. When the case was free, he opened
  the lid and displayed the head of a small plaster bust, a miniature copy of
  Donatello's "St. Cecilia," the shoulders of which were wedged in with balls
  of paper. These Lyon picked out clumsily, and when he had removed the last of
  them, he lifted out the bust with infinite care and held it out for Miller's
  inspection. The officer took it from him tenderly&mdash;after an eager glance
  into the empty case&mdash;and holding it with both hands, looked at it rather
  blankly.</p>

  <p>"Feels rather damp," he remarked with a some what nonplussed air; and then
  he cast an obviously inquiring glance at Thorndyke, who took the bust from
  him, and holding it poised in the palm of his hand, appeared to be estimating
  its weight. Glancing past him at Lyon, I noticed with astonishment that the
  dealer was watching him with a ghastly stare of manifest terror, while the
  stranger was hardly less disturbed.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, man, be careful!" the latter exclaimed, starting forward.
  "You'll drop it!"</p>

  <p>The prediction was hardly uttered before it was verified. Drop it he did;
  and in a perfectly deliberate, purposeful manner, so that the bust fell on
  its back on the marble floor and was instantly shattered into a hundred
  fragments. It was an amazing affair. But what followed was still more
  amazing. For, as the snowy fragments scattered to right and left, from one of
  them a little yellow metal cylinder detached itself and rolled slowly along
  the floor. The stranger darted forward and stooped to seize it; but Miller
  stooped, too, and I judged that the superintendent's cranium was the harder,
  for he rose, rubbing his head with one hand and with the other holding out
  the cylinder to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us what this is, doctor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "It is the seal of Nebuchadnezzar, and it is the
  property of the executors of the late Martin Rowlands, who was murdered the
  night before last."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, Lyon slithered from his chair and lay upon the
  floor insensible, while the stranger made a sudden burst for the door, where
  he was instantly folded in the embrace of a massive plain-clothes man, who
  held him immovable while his colleague clicked on the handcuffs.</p>

  <p>"So," I remarked, as we walked home, "your casts of the stick and the
  footprints were not wanted after all."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," he replied, "they are wanted very much. If the seal
  should fail to hang Mr. Lyon, the casts will assuredly fit the rope round his
  neck." (This, by the way, actually happened. The defence that Lyon received
  the seal from some unknown person was countered by the unexpected production
  in court of the casts of Lyon's feet and the stick, which proved that the
  prisoner had been at Pinwell, and in the company of the deceased at or about
  the date of the murder, and secured his conviction.)</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "how did you fix this crime on Lyon? It began, I
  think, with those stick impressions in the wood. What was there peculiar
  about those impressions?"</p>

  <p>"Their peculiarity was that they were the impressions of a stick which
  apparently did not belong to the person who was carrying it."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Thorndyke!" I exclaimed, "is that possible? How could an
  impression on the ground suggest ownership?</p>

  <p>"It is a curious point," he replied, "though essentially simple, which
  turns on the way in which the ferrule of a stick becomes worn. In a plain,
  symmetrical stick with out a handle, the ferrule wears evenly all round; but
  in a stick with a crook or other definite handle, which is grasped in a
  particular way and always put down in the same position, the ferrule becomes
  worn on one side&mdash;the side opposite the handle, or the front of the
  stick. But the important point is that the bevel of wear is not exactly
  opposite the handle. It is slightly to one side, for this reason. A man puts
  his stick down with the handle fore and aft; but as he steps forward, his
  hand swings away from his body, rotating the stick slightly outward.
  Consequently, the wear on the ferrule is slightly inward. That is to say,
  that in a right-handed man's stick the wear is slightly to the left and in a
  left-handed man's stick the wear is slightly to the right. But if a
  right-handed man walks with a left-handed stick, the impression on the ground
  will show the bevel of wear on the right side&mdash;which is the wrong side;
  and the right-handed rotation will throw it still farther to the right. Now
  in this case, the impressions showed a shallow part, corresponding to the
  bevel of wear, on the right side. Therefore it was a left-handed stick. But
  it was being carried in the right hand. Therefore
  it&mdash;apparently&mdash;did not belong to the person who was carrying
  it.</p>

  <p>"Of course, as the person was unknown, the point was merely curious and
  did not concern us. But see how quickly circumstantial evidence mounts up.
  When we saw the feet of deceased, we knew that the footprints in the wood
  were his. Consequently the man with the stick was in his company; and that
  man at once came into the picture. Then Tom Rowlands told us that he had lost
  his stick and that he was left-handed; and he showed us the stick that he had
  got in exchange, and behold! that is a right-handed stick, as I ascertained
  by examining the ferrule. Here, then, is a left-handed man who has lost a
  stick and got a right-handed one in exchange; and there, in the wood, was a
  right-handed man who was carrying a left-handed stick and who was in company
  with the deceased. It was a striking coincidence. But further, the suggestion
  was that this unknown man was one of those who had called at Tom's office,
  and therefore one who wanted to get possession of the seal. This instantly
  suggested the question, Did he succeed in getting possession of the seal? We
  went to the safe and at once it became obvious that he did."</p>

  <p>"The seal in the safe was a forgery, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and a bad forgery, though skilfully done. It was an electrotype; it
  was unsymmetrical; it did not agree with the keeper's measurements; and the
  perforation, though soiled at the ends, was bright in the middle from the
  boring tool."</p>

  <p>"But how did you know that Lyon had made it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't. But he was by far the most probable person. He had a
  seal-rolling, from which an electro could be made, and he had the great skill
  that was necessary to turn a flat electro into a cylinder. He was an
  experienced faker of antiques, and he was a dealer who would have facilities
  for getting rid of the stolen seal. But it was only a probability, though, as
  time pressed, we had to act on it. Of course, when we saw him with the stick
  in his hand, it became virtually a certainty."</p>

  <p>"And how did you guess that the seal was in the bust?"</p>

  <p>"I had expected to find it enclosed in some plaster object, that being the
  safest way to hide it and smuggle it out of this country and into the United
  States. When I saw the bust, it was obvious. It was a hastily-made copy of
  one of Brucciani's busts. The plaster was damp&mdash;Brucciani's bake theirs
  dry&mdash;and had evidently been made only a few hours. So I broke it. If I
  had been mistaken I could have replaced it for five shillings, but the whole
  circumstances made it practically a certainty."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea as to how Lyon administered the poison?"</p>

  <p>"We can only surmise," he replied. "Probably he took with him some
  solution of cyanide&mdash;if that was what was used&mdash;and poured it into
  Rowlands' whisky when his attention was otherwise occupied. It would be quite
  easy; and a single gulp of a quick-acting poison like that would finish the
  business in a minute or two. But we are not likely ever to know the
  details."</p>

  <p>The evidence at the inquest showed that Thorndyke was probably right, and
  his evidence at the trial clinched the case against Lyon. As to the other
  man&mdash;who proved to be an American dealer well known to the New York
  Customs officials&mdash;the case against him broke down from lack of evidence
  that he was privy either to the murder or the theft. And so ended the case of
  Nebuchadnezzar's seal: a case that left Mr. Brodribb more than ever convinced
  that Thorndyke was either gifted with a sixth sense which enabled him to
  smell out evidence or was in league with some familiar demon who did it for
  him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="c4"
     id="c4"></a>IV. &mdash; PHYLLIS ANNESLEY'S PERIL</h2>

  <p class="first">"ONE is sometimes disposed to regret," said Thorndyke, as we
  sat waiting for the arrival of Mr. Mayfield, the solicitor, "that our
  practice is so largely concerned with the sordid and the unpleasant."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "Medical Jurisprudence is not always a particularly
  delicate subject. But it is our line of practice and we have got to take it
  as we find it."</p>

  <p>"A philosophic conclusion, Jervis," he rejoined, "and worthy of my learned
  friend. It happens that the most intimate contact of Law and Medicine is in
  crimes against the person and consequently the proper study of the Medical
  Jurist is crime of that type. It is a regrettable fact, but we must accept
  it."</p>

  <p>"At the same time," said I, "there don't seem to be any Medico-legal
  issues in this Bland case. The woman was obviously murdered. The only
  question is, who murdered her? And the answer to that question seems pretty
  obvious."</p>

  <p>"It does," said Thorndyke. "But we shall be better able to judge when we
  have heard what Mayfield has to tell us. And I think I hear him coming up the
  stairs now."</p>

  <p>I rose to open the door for our visitor, and, as he entered, I looked at
  him curiously. Mr. Mayfield was quite a young man, and the mixture of
  deference and nervousness in his manner as he entered the room suggested no
  great professional experience.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, sir," said he, taking the easy-chair that Thorndyke offered
  him, "that I ought to have come to you sooner, for the inquest, or, at least,
  the police court proceedings."</p>

  <p>"You reserved your defence, I think?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the solicitor, with a wry smile. "I had to. There seemed to
  be nothing to say. So I put in a plea of Not Guilty and reserved the defence
  in the hope that something might turn up. But I am gravelled completely. It
  looks a perfectly hopeless case. I don't know how it strikes you, sir."</p>

  <p>"I have seen only the newspaper reports," said Thorndyke. "They are
  certainly not encouraging. But let us disregard them. I suggest that you
  recite the facts of the case and I can ask any questions that are necessary
  to elucidate it further."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," said Mayfield. "Then I will begin with the disappearance
  of Mrs. Lucy Bland. That occurred about the eighteenth of last May. At that
  time she was living, apart from her husband, at Wimbledon, in furnished
  lodgings. After lunch on the eighteenth she went out, saying that she should
  not be home until night. She was seen by someone who knew her at Wimbledon
  Station on the down side about three o'clock. At shortly after six probably
  on the same day, she went to the Post Office at Lower Ditton to buy some
  stamps. The postmistress, who knew her by sight, is certain that she called
  there, but cannot swear to the exact date. At any rate, she did not go home
  that night and was never seen alive again. Her landlady communicated with her
  husband and he at once applied to the police. But all the inquiries that were
  made led to nothing. She had disappeared without leaving a trace.</p>

  <p>"The discovery was made four months later, on the sixteenth of September.
  On that day some workmen went to 'The Larches,' a smallish, old-fashioned,
  riverside house just outside Lower Ditton, to examine the electric wiring.
  The house was let to a new tenant, and as the meter had shown an
  unaccountable leakage of current during the previous quarter, they went to
  see what was wrong.</p>

  <p>"To get at the main, they had to take up part of the floor of the
  dining-room; and when they got the boards up, they were horrified to discover
  a pair of feet&mdash;evidently a woman's feet&mdash;projecting from under the
  next board. They immediately went to the police station and reported what
  they had seen, whereupon the inspector and a sergeant accompanied them back
  to the house and directed them to take up several more boards&mdash;which
  they did; and there, jammed in between the joists, was the body of a woman
  who was subsequently identified as Mrs. Lucy Bland. The corpse appeared to be
  perfectly fresh and only quite recently dead; but at the post mortem it was
  discovered that it had been embalmed or preserved by injecting a solution of
  formaldehyde and might have been dead three or four months. The cause of
  death was given at the inquest as suffocation, probably preceded by the
  forcible administration of chloroform."</p>

  <p>"The house, I understand," said Thorndyke, "belongs to one of the
  accused?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Miss Phyllis Annesley. It is her freehold, and she lived in it until
  recently. Last autumn, however, she took to travelling about and then partly
  dismantle the house and stored most of the furniture; but she kept two
  bedrooms furnished and the kitchen and dining, room in just usable condition,
  and she used to put up there for a day or two in the intervals of her
  journeys, either alone or with her maid."</p>

  <p>"And as to Miss Annesley's relations with the Blands?"</p>

  <p>"She had known them both for some years. With Leonard Bland she was
  admittedly on affectionate terms, though there is no suggestion of improper
  relations between them. But Bland used to visit her when she lived there and
  they used to go for picnics on the river in the boat belonging to the house.
  Mrs. Bland also occasionally visited Miss Annesley, and they seem to have
  been on quite civil terms. Of course, she knew about her husband's affection
  for the lady, but she doesn't seem to have had any strong feeling about
  it."</p>

  <p>"And what were the relations of the husband and wife?" asked
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Rather queer. They didn't suit one another, so they simply agreed to go
  their own ways. But they don't seem to have been unfriendly, and Mr. Bland
  was most scrupulous in regard to his financial obligations to his wife. He
  not only allowed her liberal maintenance but went out of his way to make
  provision for her. I will give you an instance, which impressed me very
  much.</p>

  <p>"An old acquaintance of his, a Mr. Julius Wicks, who had been working for
  some years in the film studio at Los Angeles, came to England about a year
  ago and proposed to Bland that they should start one or two picture theatres
  in the provinces, Bland to find the money&mdash;which he was able to
  do&mdash;and Wicks to provide the technical knowledge and do the actual
  management. Bland agreed, and a partnership was arranged on the basis of
  two-thirds of the profits to Bland and one-third to Wicks; with the proviso
  that if Bland should die, all his rights as partner should be vested in his
  wife."</p>

  <p>"And supposing Wicks should die?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Wicks was not married, though he was engaged to a film actress. On
  his death, his share would go to Bland, and similarly, on Bland's death, if
  he should die after his wife, his share would go to his partner."</p>

  <p>"Bland seems to have been a fairly good business man," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mayfield agreed. "The arrangement was all in his favour. But he was
  the capitalist, you see. However, the point is that Bland was quite mindful
  of his wife's interests. There was nothing like enmity."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "one motive is excluded. Was the question of
  divorce ever raised?"</p>

  <p>"It couldn't be," said Mayfield. "There were no grounds on either side.
  But it seems to have been recognised and admitted that if Bland had been free
  he would have married Miss Annesley. They were greatly attached to one
  another."</p>

  <p>"That seems a fairly solid motive," said I.</p>

  <p>"It appears to be," Mayfield admitted. "But to me, who have known these
  people for years and have always had the highest opinion of them, it
  seems&mdash;Well, I can't associate this atrocious crime with them at all.
  However, that is not to the point. I must get on with the facts.</p>

  <p>"Very soon after the discovery at 'The Larches,' the police learned that
  there had been rumours in Lower Ditton for some time past of strange
  happenings at the house and that two labourers named Brodie and Stanton knew
  something definite. They accordingly looked up these two men and examined
  them separately, when both men made substantially identical statements, which
  were to this effect:</p>

  <p>"About the middle of May&mdash;neither of them was able to give an exact
  date&mdash;between nine and ten in the evening, they were walking together
  along the lane in which 'The Larches' is situated when they saw a man lurking
  in the front garden of the house. As they were passing, he came to the gate
  and beckoned to them, and when they approached he whispered: 'I say, mates,
  there's something rummy going on in this house.'</p>

  <p>"'How do you know?' asked Brodie.</p>

  <p>"'I've been looking in through a hole in the shutter,' the man replied.
  'They seem to be hiding something under the floor. Come and have a look.'</p>

  <p>"The two men followed him up the garden to the back of the house, where he
  took them to one of the windows of a ground-floor room and pointed to two
  holes in the outside shutters.</p>

  <p>"'Just take a peep in through them,' said he.</p>

  <p>"Each of the men put an eye to one of the holes and looked in; and this is
  what they both saw: There were two rooms, communicating, with a wide arch
  between them. Through the arch and at the far end of the second room were two
  persons, a man and a woman. They were on their hands and knees, apparently
  doing something to the floor. Presently the man, who had on a painter's white
  blouse, rose and picked up a board which he stood on end against the wall.
  Then he stooped again and seemed to lay hold of something that lay on the
  floor&mdash;something that looked like a large bundle or a roll of carpet. At
  this moment something passed across in front of the holes and shut out the
  view&mdash;so that there must have been a third person in the room. When the
  obstructing body moved away again, the man was kneeling on the floor looking
  down at the bundle and the woman had come forward and was standing just in
  the arch with a pair of pincers in her hand. She was dressed in a spotted
  pinafore with a white sailor collar, and both the men recognised her at once
  as Miss Annesley."</p>

  <p>"They knew her by sight, then?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes. They were Ditton men. It is a small place and everybody in it must
  have known Miss Annesley and Bland, too, for that matter. Well, they saw her
  standing in the archway quite distinctly. Neither of the men has the least
  doubt as to her identity. They watched her for perhaps half a minute. Then
  the invisible person inside moved in front of the peepholes and shut out the
  scene.</p>

  <p>"When the obstruction moved away, the woman was back in the farther room,
  kneeling on the floor. The bundle had disappeared and the man was in the act
  of taking the board, which he had rested against the wall, and laying it in
  its place in the floor. After this, the obstruction kept coming and going, so
  that the watchers only got occasional glimpses of what was going on. They saw
  the man apparently hammering nails into the floor and they heard faint sounds
  of knocking. On one occasion, towards the end of the proceedings, they saw
  the man standing in the archway with his face towards them, apparently
  looking at something in his hand. They couldn't see what the thing was, but
  they clearly recognised the man as Mr. Bland, whom they both knew well by
  sight. Then the view was shut out again, and when they next saw Mr. Bland, he
  was standing by Miss Annesley in the farther room, looking down at the floor
  and taking off his blouse. As it seemed that the business was over and that
  Bland and Miss Annesley would probably be coming out, the men thought it best
  to clear off, lest they should be seen.</p>

  <p>"As they walked up the lane, they discussed the mysterious proceedings
  that they had witnessed, but could make nothing of them. The stranger
  suggested that perhaps Miss Annesley was hiding her plate or valuables to
  keep them safe while she was travelling, and hinted that it might be worth
  someone's while to take the floor up later on and see what was there. But
  this suggestion Brodie and Stanton, who are most respectable men, condemned
  strongly, and they agreed that, as the affair was no concern of theirs, they
  had better say nothing about it. But they evidently must have talked to some
  extent, for the affair got to be spoken about in the village, and, of course,
  when the body was discovered under the floor, the gossip soon reached the
  ears of the police."</p>

  <p>"Has the third man come forward to give evidence?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No, he has not been found yet. He was a stranger to both the men;
  apparently a labourer or farm-hand or tramp. But nothing is known about him.
  So that is the case; and it is about as hopeless as it is possible to be. Of
  course, there is the known character of the accused; but against that is a
  perfectly intelligible motive and the evidence of two eye-witnesses. Do you
  think you would be disposed to undertake the defence, sir? I realise that it
  is asking a great deal of you."</p>

  <p>"I should like to think the matter over," said Thorndyke, "and make a few
  preliminary inquiries. And I should want to read over the depositions in full
  detail. Can you let me have them?"</p>

  <p>"I have a verbatim report of the police court proceedings and of the
  inquest. I will leave them with you now. And when may I hope to have your
  decision?"</p>

  <p>"By the day after to-morrow at the latest," was the reply, on which the
  young solicitor produced a bundle of papers from his bag, and having laid
  them on the table, thanked us both and took his leave.</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," I said when Mayfield had gone, "I am fairly mystified.
  I know you would not undertake a merely formal defence, but what else you
  could do is, I must confess, beyond my imagination. It seems to me that the
  prosecution have only to call the witnesses and the verdict of 'Guilty'
  follows automatically."</p>

  <p>"That is how it appears to me," said Thorndyke. "And if it still appears
  so when I have read the reports and made my preliminary investigations, I
  shall decline the brief. But appearances are sometimes misleading."</p>

  <p>With this he took the reports and the notebook, in which he had made a few
  brief memoranda of Mayfield's summary of the case, and drawing a chair to the
  table, proceeded, with quiet concentration, to read through and make notes on
  the evidence. When he had finished, he passed the reports to me and rose,
  pocketing his note book and glancing at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Read the evidence through carefully, Jervis," said he, "and tell me if
  you see any possible way out. I have one or two calls to make, but I shall
  not be more than an hour. When I come back, I should like to hear your views
  on the case."</p>

  <p>During his absence I read the reports through with the closest attention.
  Something in Thorndyke's tone had seemed to hint at a possible flaw in the
  case for the prosecution. But I could find no escape from the conviction that
  these two persons were guilty. The reports merely amplified what Mayfield had
  told us; and the added detail, especially in the case of the eye witnesses,
  only made the evidence more conclusive. I could not see the material for even
  a formal defence.</p>

  <p>In less than an hour my colleague re-entered the room, and I was about to
  give him my impressions of the evidence when he said, "It is rather early,
  Jervis, but I think we had better go and get some lunch. I have arranged to
  go down to Ditton this afternoon and have a look at the house. Mayfield has
  given me a note to the police sergeant, who has the key and is virtually in
  possession."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what you will gain by looking at the house," said I.</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," he replied. "But it is a good rule always to inspect the
  scene of a crime and all the evidence as far as possible."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "it is a forlorn hope. I have read through the evidence
  and it seems to me that the accused are as good as convicted. I can see no
  line of defence at all. Can you?"</p>

  <p>"At present I cannot," he replied. "But there are one or two points that I
  should like to clear up before I decide whether or not to undertake the
  defence. And I have a great belief in first-hand observation."</p>

  <p>We consumed a simplified lunch at one of our regular haunts in Fleet
  Street and from thence were conveyed by a taxi to Waterloo, where we caught
  the selected train to Lower Ditton. I had put the reports in my pocket, and
  during our journey I read them over again, to see if I could discover any
  point that would be cleared up by an inspection of the premises.</p>

  <p>For, in spite of the rather vague purpose implied by Thorndyke's
  explanation, something in my colleague's manner, coupled with long experience
  of his method made me suspect that he had some definite object in view. But
  nothing was said by either of us during the journey, nor did we discuss the
  case; indeed, so far as I could see, there was nothing to discuss.</p>

  <p>Our reception at the Lower Ditton Police Station was something more than
  cordial. The sergeant recognised Thorndyke instantly&mdash;it appeared that
  he was an enthusiastic admirer of my colleague&mdash;and after a brief glance
  at Mayfield's note, took a key from his desk and put on his helmet.</p>

  <p>"Lord bless you, sir," said he, "I don't need to be told who you are. I've
  seen you in court, and heard you. I'll come along with you to the house
  myself."</p>

  <p>I suspected that Thorndyke would have gladly dispensed with this
  attention, but he accepted it with genial courtesy, and we went forth through
  the village and along the quiet lane in which the ill-omened house was
  situated. And as we went, the sergeant commented on the case with curiously
  unofficial freedom.</p>

  <p>"You've got your work cut out, sir, if you are going to conduct the
  defence. But I wish you luck. I've known Miss Annesley for some
  years&mdash;she was well known in the village here&mdash;and a nicer,
  gentler, more pleasant lady you wouldn't wish to meet. To think of her in
  connection with a murder&mdash;and such a murder, too&mdash;such a brutal,
  callous affair! Well, it's beyond me. And yet there it is, unless those two
  men are lying."</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason to suppose that they are?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no; there isn't. They are good, sober, decent men. And it would be
  such an atrociously wicked lie. And they both knew the prisoners, and liked
  them. Everybody liked Mr. Bland and Miss Annesley, though their friendship
  for one another may not have been quite in order. But I can tell you, sir,
  these two men are frightfully cut up at having to give evidence. This is the
  house!"</p>

  <p>He opened a gate and we entered the garden, beyond which was a smallish,
  old-fashioned house, of which the ground-floor windows were protected by
  outside shutters. We walked round to the back of the house, where was another
  garden with a lawn and a path leading down to the river.</p>

  <p>"Is that a boat-house?" Thorndyke asked, pointing to a small gable that
  appeared above a clump of lilac bushes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the sergeant. "And there is a boat in it; a good, beamy,
  comfortable tub that Miss Annesley and her friend used to go out picnicking
  in. This is the window that the men peeped in at, but you can't see much now
  because the room is all dark."</p>

  <p>I looked at the two French windows, which opened on to the lawn, and
  reflected on this new instance of the folly of wrong-doers. Each window was
  fitted with a pair of strong shutters, which bolted on the inside, and each
  shutter was pierced, about five feet from the sill, by a circular hole a
  little over an inch in diameter. It seemed incredible that two sane persons,
  engaged in the concealment of a murdered body, should have left those four
  holes uncovered for any chance eavesdropper to spy on their doings.</p>

  <p>But my astonishment at this lack of precaution was still greater when the
  sergeant admitted us and we stood inside the room, for both the windows, as
  well as the pair in the farther room, were furnished with heavy curtains.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the sergeant, in answer to my comment, "it's a queer thing how
  people overlook matters of vital importance. You see, they drew the
  drawing-room curtains all right, but they forgot these. Is there anything in
  particular that you want to see, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to see where the body was hidden," said Thorndyke, "but I
  will just look round the rooms first."</p>

  <p>He walked slowly to and fro, looking about him and evidently fixing the
  appearance of the rooms on his memory. Not that there was much to see or
  remember. The two nearly square rooms communicated through a wide arch, once
  closed by curtains, as shown by the brass curtain-rod. The back room had been
  completely dismantled with the exception of the window curtains, but the
  front room, although the floor and the walls, were bare, was not entirely
  unfurnished. The sideboard was still in position and bore at each end a tall
  electric light standard, as did also the mantelpiece. There were three dining
  chairs and a good-sized gate-leg table stood closed against the wall.</p>

  <p>"I see you have not had the floor-boards nailed down," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; not yet. So we can see where the body was hidden and where the
  electric main is. The electricians took up the wrong board at
  first&mdash;that is how they came to discover the body. And one of them said
  that the boards over the main had been raised recently, and he thought that
  the&mdash;er&mdash;the accused had meant to hide the body there, but when
  they got the floor up they struck the main and had to choose a fresh
  place."</p>

  <p>He stooped, and lifting the loose boards, which he stood on end against
  the mantelpiece, exposed the joists and the earth floor about a foot below
  them. In one of the spaces the electric main ran and in the adjoining one the
  apparently disused gas main.</p>

  <p>"This is where we found poor Mrs. Bland," said the sergeant, pointing to
  an empty space. "It was an awful sight. Gave me quite a turn. The poor lady
  was lying on her side jammed down between the joists and her nose flattened
  up against one of the timbers. They must have been brutes that did it, and I
  can't&mdash;I really can't believe that Miss Annesley was one of them."</p>

  <p>"It looks a narrow place for a body to lie in," said I.</p>

  <p>"The joists are sixteen inches apart," said Thorndyke, laying his pocket
  rule across the space, "and two and a half inches thick. Heavy timber and
  wide spaces."</p>

  <p>He stood up, and turning round, looked towards the windows of the back
  room. I followed his glance and noted, almost with a start, the two holes in
  the shutter of the left-hand window (the right-hand window, of course, from
  outside) glaring into the darkened room like a pair of inquisitive, accusing
  eyes. The holes in the other window were hardly visible, and the reason for
  the difference was obvious. The one window had small panes and thick muntins,
  or sash-bars, whereas the other was glazed, with large sheets of plate glass
  and had no muntins.</p>

  <p>"Of course it would be dark at the time," I said in response to his
  unspoken comment, "and this room would be lighted up, more or less."</p>

  <p>"Not so very dark in May," he replied. "There is a furnished bedroom,
  isn't there, sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"Two, sir," was the reply; and the sergeant forthwith opened the door and
  led the way across the hall and up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Annesley's room," he said, opening a door gingerly and
  peering in.</p>

  <p>We entered the room and looked about us with vague curiosity. It was a
  simply-furnished room, but dainty and tasteful, with its small four-post
  bedstead, light easy-chair and little, ladylike writing-table.</p>

  <p>"That's Mr. Bland," said the sergeant, pointing to a double
  photograph-frame on the table, "and the lady is Miss Annesley herself."</p>

  <p>I took up the frame and looked curiosity at the two portraits. For a pair
  of murderers they were certainly uncommonly prepossessing. The man, who
  looked about thirty-five, was a typical good-looking, middle-class
  Englishman, while the woman was distinctly handsome, with a thoughtful,
  refined and gentle cast of face.</p>

  <p>"She has something of a Japanese air," said I, "with that coil on the top
  of the head and the big ivory hairpin stuck through it."</p>

  <p>I passed the frame to Thorndyke, who regarded each portrait attentively,
  and then, taking both photographs out of the frame, closely examined each in
  turn, back and front, before replacing them.</p>

  <p>"The other bedroom," said the sergeant as Thorndyke laid down the frame,
  "is the spare room. There's nothing to see in it."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he conducted us into it, and when we had verified his
  statement we returned downstairs.</p>

  <p>"Before we go," said Thorndyke, "I will just see what is opposite those
  holes."</p>

  <p>He walked to the window and was just looking out through one of the holes
  when the sergeant, who had followed him closely, suddenly slid along the
  floor and nearly fell.</p>

  <p>"Well, I never!" he exclaimed, recovering himself and stooping to pick up
  some small object. "There's a dangerous thing to leave lying about the floor.
  Bit of slate pencil&mdash;at least, that is what it looks like."</p>

  <p>He handed it to Thorndyke, who glanced at it and remarked, "Yes, things
  that roll under the foot are apt to produce broken bones; but I think you had
  better take care of it. I may have to ask you something about it at the
  trial."</p>

  <p>We bade the sergeant farewell at the bottom of the lane, and as we turned
  into the footpath to the station I said: "We don't seem to have picked up
  very much more than Mayfield told us&mdash;excepting that bit of slate
  pencil. By the way, why did you tell the sergeant to keep it?"</p>

  <p>"On the broad principle of keeping everything, relevant or irrelevant. But
  it wasn't slate pencil; it was a fragment of a small carbon rod."</p>

  <p>"Presumably dropped by the electricians who had been working in the room,"
  said I, and then asked, "Have you come to any decision about this case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I shall undertake the defence."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I can't imagine what line you will take. Strong suspicion
  would have fallen on these two persons even if there had been no witnesses;
  but the evidence of those two eye-witnesses seems to clench the matter."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Thorndyke. "That is my position. I rest my case on the
  evidence of those two men&mdash;as I hope it will appear under
  cross-examination."</p>

  <p>This statement of Thorndyke's gave me much food for reflection during the
  days that followed. But it was not very nourishing food, for the case still
  remained perfectly incomprehensible. To be sure, if the evidence of the two
  eye-witnesses could be shown to be false, the ease against the prisoners
  would break down, since it would bring another suspected person into view.
  But their evidence was clearly not false. They were men of known
  respectability and no one doubted the truth of their statements.</p>

  <p>Nor was the obscurity of the case lightened in any way by Thorndyke's
  proceedings. We called together on the two prisoners, but from neither did we
  elicit any fresh facts. Neither could establish a clear alibi or suggest any
  explanation of the eye-witnesses' statements. They gave a simple denial of
  having been in the house at that time or of having ever taken up the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Both prisoners, however, impressed me favourably. Bland, whom we
  interviewed at Brixton, seemed a pleasant, manly fellow, frank and
  straightforward though quite shrewd and business-like; while Miss Annesley,
  whom we saw at Holloway, was a really charming young lady&mdash;sweet-faced,
  dignified and very gracious and gentle in manner. In one respect, indeed, I
  found her disappointing. The picturesque coil had disappeared from the top of
  her head and her hair had been shortened ("bobbed" is, I believe, the correct
  term) into a mere fringe. Thorndyke also noticed the change, and in fact
  commented on it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "it is a disimprovement in my case. It doesn't suit
  me. But I really had no choice. When I was in Paris in the spring I had an
  accident. I was having my hair cleaned with petrol when it caught fire. It
  was most alarming. The hairdresser had the presence of mind to throw a damp
  towel over my head, and that saved my life. But my hair was nearly all burnt.
  There was nothing for it but to have it trimmed as evenly as possible. But it
  looked horrid at first. I had my photograph taken by Barton soon after I came
  home, just as a record, you know, and it looks awfully odd. I look like a
  Bluecoat boy."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "when did you return?"</p>

  <p>"I landed in England about the middle of April and went straight to my
  little flat at Paddington, where I have been living ever since."</p>

  <p>"You don't remember where you were on the eighteenth of May?</p>

  <p>"I was living at my flat, but I can't remember what I did on that day. You
  don't, as a rule, unless you keep a diary, which I do not."</p>

  <p>This was not very promising. As we came away from the prison, I felt, on
  the one hand, a conviction that this sweet, gracious lady could have had no
  hand in this horrible crime, and on the other an utter despair of extricating
  her from the web of circumstances in which she had become enmeshed.</p>

  <p>From Thorndyke I could gather nothing, except that he was going on with
  his investigations&mdash;a significant fact, in his case. To my artfully
  disguised questions he had one invariable reply: "My dear Jervis, you have
  read the evidence, you have seen the house, you have all the facts. Think the
  case over and consider the possibilities of cross-examination." And that was
  all I could get out of him.</p>

  <p>He was certainly very busy, but his activities only increased my
  bewilderment. He sent a well-known architect down to make a scale-plan of the
  house and grounds; and he dispatched Polton to take photographs of the place
  from every possible point of view. The latter, indeed, was up to his eyes in
  work, and enjoying himself amazingly, but as secret as an oyster. As he went
  about, beaming with happiness and crinkling with self-complacency, he
  exasperated me to that extent that I could have banged his little head
  against the wall. In short, though I had watched the development of the case
  from the beginning, I was still without a glimmer of understanding of it even
  when I took my seat in court on the morning of the trial.</p>

  <p>It was a memorable occasion, and every incident in it is still vivid in my
  memory. Particularly do I remember looking with a sort of horrified
  fascination at the female prisoner, standing by her friend in the dock, pale
  but composed and looking the very type and picture of womanly beauty and
  dignity; and reflecting with a shudder that the graceful neck&mdash;looking
  longer and more slender from the shortness of the hair&mdash;might very
  probably be, within a matter of days, encircled by the hangman's rope. These
  lugubrious reflections were interrupted by the entrance of two persons, a man
  and a woman, who were apparently connected with the case, since as they took
  their seats they both looked towards the dock and exchanged silent greetings
  with the prisoners.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who those people are, Mayfield?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"That is Mr. Julius Wicks, Mr. Bland's partner, and his fiance, Miss
  Eugenia Kropp, the film actress," he replied.</p>

  <p>I was about to ask him if they were here to give evidence when, the
  preliminaries having come to an end, the counsel for the Crown, Sir John
  Turville, rose and began his opening speech.</p>

  <p>It was a good speech and eminently correct; but its very moderation made
  it the more damaging. It began with an outline of the facts, almost identical
  with Mayfield's summary, and a statement of the evidence which would
  presently be given by the principal witnesses.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Sir John, when he had finished his recital, "let us bring
  these facts to a focus. Considered as a related group, this is what they show
  us. On the sixteenth of September there is found, concealed under the floor
  of a certain room in a certain house, the body of a woman who has evidently
  been murdered. That woman is the separated wife of a man who is on
  affectionate terms with another woman whom he would admittedly wish to marry
  and who would be willing to marry him. This murdered woman is, in short, the
  obstacle to the marriage desired by these two persons. Now the house in which
  the corpse is concealed is the property of one of those two persons, and both
  of them have access to it; and no other person has access to it. Here, then,
  to begin with, is a set of profoundly suspicious circumstances.</p>

  <p>"But there are others far more significant. That unfortunate lady, the
  unwanted wife of the prisoner, Bland, disappeared mysteriously on the
  eighteenth of last May; and witnesses will prove that the body was deposited
  under the floor on or about that date. Now, on or about that same date, in
  that same house, in that same room, in the same part of that room, those two
  persons, the prisoners at the bar, were seen by two eminently respectable
  witnesses in the act of concealing some large object under the floor. What
  could that object have been? The floor of the room has been taken up and
  nothing whatever but the corpse of this poor murdered lady has been found
  under it. The irresistible conclusion is that those two persons were then and
  there engaged in concealing that corpse.</p>

  <p>"To sum up, then, the reasons or believing that the prisoners are guilty
  of the crime with which they are charged are threefold. They had an
  intelligible and strong motive to commit that crime; they had the opportunity
  to commit it; and we have evidence from two eye-witnesses which makes it
  practically an observed fact that the prisoners did actually commit that
  crime."</p>

  <p>As the Crown counsel sat down, pending the swearing of the first witness,
  I turned to Thorndyke and said anxiously: "I can't imagine what you are going
  to reply to that."</p>

  <p>"My reply," he answered quietly, "will be largely governed by what I am
  able to elicit in cross-examination." Here the first witness was
  called&mdash;the electrician who discovered the body&mdash;and gave his
  evidence, but Thorndyke made no cross-examination. He was followed by the
  sergeant, who described the discovery in more detail. As the Crown counsel
  sat down, Thorndyke rose, and I pricked up my ears.</p>

  <p>"Have you mentioned everything that you saw or found in this room?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, at that time. Later&mdash;on the second of October&mdash;I found a
  small piece of a carbon pencil on the floor of the front room near the
  window."</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket an envelope from which he extracted the
  fragment of the alleged "slate pencil" and passed it to Thorndyke, who,
  having passed to the judge with the intimation that he wished it to be put in
  evidence, sat down. The judge inspected the fragment curiously and then cast
  an inquisitive glance at Thorndyke&mdash;as he had done once or twice before.
  For my colleague's appearance in the role of counsel was a rare event, and
  one usually productive of surprises.</p>

  <p>To the long succession of witnesses who followed Thorndyke listened
  attentively but did not cross-examine, I saw the judge look at him curiously
  from time to time and my own curiosity grew more and more intense. Evidently
  he was saving himself up for the crucial witnesses. At length the name of
  James Brodie was called, and a serious-looking elderly workman entered the
  box. He gave his evidence clearly and confidently, though with manifest
  reluctance, and I could see that his vivid description of that sinister scene
  made a great impression on the jury. When the examination in chief was
  finished, Thorndyke rose, and the judge settled himself to listen with an air
  of close attention.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been inside 'The Larches'?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I've passed the house twice every day for years, but I've never
  been inside it."</p>

  <p>"When you looked in through the shutter, was the room well lighted?"</p>

  <p>"No, 'twas very dim. I could only just see what the people were
  doing."</p>

  <p>"Yet you recognised Miss Annesley quite clearly?"</p>

  <p>"Not at first, I didn't. Not until she came and stood in the archway. The
  light seemed quite good there."</p>

  <p>"Did you see her come out of the front room and walk to the arch?"</p>

  <p>"No. I saw her in the front room and then something must have stopped up
  the hole, for 'twas all dark. Then the hole got clear again and I saw her
  standing in the arch. But I only saw her for a moment or two. Then the hole
  got stopped again and when it opened she was back in the front room."</p>

  <p>"How did you know that the woman in the front room was Miss Annesley?
  Could you see her face in that dim light?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I could tell her by her dress. She wore a striped pinafore with a
  big, white sailor-collar. Besides, there wasn't nobody else there."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to Mr. Bland. Did you see him walk out of the front room
  and up to the arch?"</p>

  <p>"No. 'Twas the same as with Miss Annesley. Something kept passing across
  the hole. I see him in the front room; then I see him in the arch and then I
  see him in the front room again."</p>

  <p>"When they were in the archway, were they moving or standing still?"</p>

  <p>"They both seemed to be standing quite still."</p>

  <p>"Was Miss Annesley looking straight towards you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Her face was turned away a little."</p>

  <p>"I want you to look at these photographs and tell us if any of them shows
  the head in the position in which you saw it."</p>

  <p>He handed a bundle of photographs to the witness, who looked at them, one
  after another, and at length picked out one.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly how she looked," said he. "She might have been standing
  for this very picture."</p>

  <p>He passed the photograph to Thorndyke, who noted the number written on it
  and passed it to the judge, who also noted the number and laid it on his
  desk. Thorndyke then resumed: "You say the light was very dim in the front
  room. Were the electric lamps alight?"</p>

  <p>"None that I could see were alight."</p>

  <p>"How many electric lamps could you see?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there was three hanging from the ceiling and there was two
  standards on the mantelpiece and one on the sideboard. None of them was
  alight."</p>

  <p>"Was there only one standard on the sideboard?"</p>

  <p>"There may have been more, but I couldn't see 'em because I could only see
  just one corner of the sideboard."</p>

  <p>"Could you see the whole of the mantelpiece?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There was a standard lamp at each end."</p>

  <p>"Could you see anything on the near side of the mantelpiece?"</p>

  <p>"There was a table there: a folding table with twisted legs. But I could
  only see part of that. The side of the arch cut it off."</p>

  <p>"You have said that you could see Miss Annesley quite clearly and could
  see how she was dressed. Could you see how her hair was arranged?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. 'Twas done up on the top of her head in what they calls a bun and
  there was a sort of a skewer stuck through it."</p>

  <p>As the witness gave this answer, a light broke on me. Not a very clear
  light, for the mystery was still unsolved. But I could see that Thorndyke had
  a very definite strategic plan. And, glancing at the dock, I was immediately
  aware that the prisoners had seen the light, too.</p>

  <p>"You have described what looked like a hole in the floor," Thorndyke
  resumed, "where some boards had been raised, near the middle of the room. Was
  that hole nearer the sideboard or nearer the mantelpiece?"</p>

  <p>"It was nearer the mantelpiece," the witness replied; on which Thorndyke
  sat down, the witness left the box, and both the judge and the counsel for
  the prosecution rapidly turned over their notes with evident surprise.</p>

  <p>The next witness was Albert Stanton and his evidence was virtually a
  repetition of Brodie's; and when, in cross Thorndyke put over again the same
  series of questions, he elicited precisely the same answers even to the
  recognition of the same photograph. And again I began to see a glimmer of
  light. But only a glimmer.</p>

  <p>Stanton being the last of the witnesses for the Crown, his brief
  re-examination by Sir John Turville completed the case for the prosecution.
  Thereupon Thorndyke rose and announced that he called witnesses, and
  forthwith the first of them appeared in the box. This was Frederick Stokes,
  A.R.I.B.A., architect, and he deposed that he had made a careful survey of
  the house called "The Larches" at Lower Ditton and prepared a plan on the
  scale of half an inch to a foot. He swore that the plan&mdash;of which he
  produced the original and a number of lithographed duplicates&mdash;was true
  and exact in every respect. Thorndyke took the plans from him and passing
  them to the judge asked that the original should be put in evidence and the
  duplicates handed to the jury.</p>

  <p>The next witness was Joseph Barton of Kensington, photographer. He deposed
  to having taken photographs of Miss Annesley on various occasions, the last
  being on the twenty-third of last April. He produced copies of them all with
  the date written on each. He swore that the dates written were the correct
  dates. The photographs were handed up to the judge, who looked them over, one
  by one. Suddenly he seemed, as it were, to stiffen and turned quickly from
  the photographs to his notes; and I knew that he had struck the last
  portrait&mdash;the one with the short hair.</p>

  <p>As the photographer left the box, his place was taken by no less a person
  than our ingenious laboratory assistant; who, having taken his place, beamed
  on the judge, the jury and the court in general, with a face wreathed in
  crinkly smiles. Nathaniel Polton, being sworn, deposed that, on the fifteenth
  of October, he proceeded to "The Larches" at Lower Ditton and took three
  photographs of the ground-floor rooms. The first was taken through the
  right-hand hole of the shutter marked A in the plan; the second through the
  left-hand hole, and the third from a point inside the back room between the
  windows and nearer to the window marked B. He produced those photographs with
  the particulars written on each. He had also made some composite photographs
  showing the two prisoners dressed as the witnesses, Brodie and Stanton, had
  described them. The bodies in those photographs were the bodies of Miss
  Winifred Blake and Mr. Robert Anstey, K.C., respectively. On these bodies the
  heads of the prisoners had been printed; and here Polton described the method
  of substitution in detail. The purpose of the photographs was to show that a
  photograph could be produced with the head of one person and the body of
  another. He also deposed to having seen and taken possession of two
  photographs, one of each of the two prisoners, which he found in the bedroom
  and which he now produced and passed to the judge. And this completed his
  evidence.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke now called the prisoner, Bland, and having elicited from him a
  sworn denial of the charge, proceeded to examine him respecting the profits
  from his three picture theatres; which, it appeared, amount to over six
  thousand pounds per annum.</p>

  <p>"In the event of your death, what becomes of this valuable property?"</p>

  <p>"If my wife had been alive it would have gone to her, but as she is dead,
  it goes to my partner and manager, Mr. Julius Wicks."</p>

  <p>"In whose custody was the house at Ditton while Miss Annesley was in
  France?"</p>

  <p>"In mine. The keys were in my possession."</p>

  <p>"Were the keys ever out of your possession?"</p>

  <p>"Only for one day. My partner, Mr. Wicks, asked to be allowed to use the
  boat for a trip on the river and to take a meal in the house. So I lent him
  the keys, which he returned the next day."</p>

  <p>After a short cross-examination, Bland returned to the dock and was
  succeeded by Miss Annesley, who, having given a sworn denial of the charge,
  described her movements in France and in London about the period of the
  crime. She also described, in answer to a question, the circumstances under
  which she had lost her hair.</p>

  <p>"Can you remember the date on which this accident happened?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was on the thirtieth of March. I made a note of the date, so that
  I could see how long my hair took to grow."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke sat down, the counsel for the prosecution rose and made a
  somewhat searching cross-examination, but without in any way shaking the
  prisoner's evidence. When this was concluded and Miss Annesley had returned
  to the dock, Thorndyke rose to address the court for the defence.</p>

  <p>"I shall not occupy your time, gentlemen," he began, "by examining the
  whole mass of evidence nor by arguing the question of motive. The guilt or
  innocence of the prisoners turns on the accuracy or inaccuracy of the
  evidence of the two witnesses, Brodie and Stanton; and to the examination of
  that evidence I shall confine myself.</p>

  <p>"Now that evidence, as you may have noticed, presents some remarkable
  discrepancies. In the first place, both witnesses describe what they saw in
  identical terms. They saw exactly the same things in exactly the same
  relative positions. But this is a physical impossibility, if they were really
  looking into a room; for they were looking in from different points of view;
  through different holes, which were two feet six inches apart. But there is
  another much more striking discrepancy. Both these men have described, most
  intelligently, fully and clearly, a number of objects in that room which were
  totally invisible to both of them; and they have described as only partly
  visible other objects which were in full view. Both witnesses, for instance,
  have described the mantelpiece with its two standard lamps and a table with
  twisted legs on the near side of it; and both saw one corner only of the
  sideboard. But if you look at the architect's plan and test it with a
  straight-edge, you will see that neither the mantelpiece nor the table could
  possibly be seen by either. The whole of that side of the room was hidden
  from them by the jamb of the arch. While as to the sideboard, the whole of
  it, with its two standards, was visible to Brodie, and to Stanton the whole
  of it excepting a small portion of the near side. But further, if you lay the
  straight-edge on the point marked C and test it against the sides of the
  arch, you will see that a person standing at that spot would get the exact
  view described by both the witnesses. I pass round duplicate plans with
  pencil lines ruled on them; but in case you find any difficulty in following
  the plans, I have put in the photographs of the room taken by Polton. The
  first photograph was taken through the hole used by Brodie, and shows exactly
  what he would have seen on looking through that hole; and you see that it
  agrees completely with the plan but disagrees totally with his description.
  The second photograph shows what was visible to Stanton; and the third
  photograph, taken from the point marked C, shows exactly the view described
  by both the witnesses, but which neither of them could possibly have seen
  under the circumstances stated.</p>

  <p>"Now what is the explanation of these extraordinary discrepancies? No one,
  I suppose, doubts the honesty of, these witnesses. I certainly do not. I have
  no doubt whatever that they were telling the truth to the best of their
  belief. Yet they have stated that they saw things which it is physically
  impossible that they could have seen. How can these amazing contradictions be
  reconciled?"</p>

  <p>He paused, and in the breathless silence, I noticed that the judge was
  gazing at him with an expression of intense expectancy; an expression that
  was reflected on the jury and indeed on every person present.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," he resumed, "there is one explanation which completely
  reconciles these contradictions; and that explanation also reconciles all the
  other strange contradictions and discrepancies which you may have noticed. If
  we assume that these two men, instead of looking through an arch into a room,
  as they believed, were really looking at a moving picture thrown on a screen
  stretched across the arch, all the contradictions vanish. Everything becomes
  perfectly plain, consistent and understandable."</p>

  <p><img alt=""
       src="1402971h-images/PuzzleLock-1.gif"></p>

  <p><img alt=""
       src="1402971h-images/PuzzleLock-2.gif"></p>

  <p>"Thus both men, from two different points of view, saw exactly the same
  scene; naturally, if they were both looking at the same picture, but
  otherwise quite impossible. Again, both men, from the point A, saw a view
  which was visible only from the point C. Perfectly natural if they were both
  looking at a picture taken from the point C; for a picture is the same
  picture from whatever point of view it is seen. But otherwise a physical
  impossibility.</p>

  <p>"You may object that these men would have seen the difference between a
  picture and a real room. Perhaps they would, even in that dim light&mdash;if
  they had looked at the scene with both eyes. But each man was looking with
  only one eye&mdash;through a small hole. Now it requires the use of both eyes
  to distinguish between a solid object and a flat picture. To a one-eyed man
  there is no difference&mdash;which is probably the reason that one-eyed
  artists are such accurate draughtsmen&mdash;they see the world around them as
  a flat picture, just as they draw it, whereas a two-eyed artist has to turn
  the solid into the flat. For the same reason, if you look at a picture with
  one eye shut it tends to look solid, really because the frame and the solid
  objects around it have gone flat. So that, if this picture was coloured, as
  it must have been, it would have been indistinguishable, to these one-eyed
  observers, from the solid reality.</p>

  <p>"Then, let us see how the other contradictions disappear. There is the
  appearance of the prisoner Annesley. She was seen&mdash;on or after the
  eighteenth of May&mdash;with her long hair coiled on the top of her head. But
  at that date her hair was quite short. You have heard the evidence and you
  have the photograph taken on the twenty-third of April showing her with short
  hair, like a man's. Here is a contradiction which vanishes at once if you
  realise that these men were not looking at Miss Annesley at all, but at a
  photograph of her taken more than a year previously.</p>

  <p>"And everything agrees with this assumption. The appearance of Miss
  Annesley has been declared by the witnesses to be identical with that
  photograph&mdash;a copy of which was in the house and could have been copied
  by anyone who had access to the house. Her figure was perfectly stationary.
  She appeared suddenly in the arch and then disappeared; she was not seen to
  come or to go. And the light kept coming and going, with intervals of
  darkness which are inexplicable, but that exactly fitted these appearances
  and disappearances. Then the figure was well lighted, though the room was
  nearly dark. Of course it was well lighted. It had to be recognised. And of
  course the rest of the room was dimly lighted, because the film-actors in the
  background had to be unrecognised.</p>

  <p>"Then there is the extraordinary dress; the striped pinafore with the
  great white collar and the painter's blouse worn by Bland. Why this
  ridiculous masquerade? Its purpose is obvious. It was to make these observers
  believe that the portraits in the arch&mdash;which they mistook for real
  people&mdash;were the same persons as the film-actors in the background,
  whose features they could not distinguish. And Mr. Polton has shown us how
  the clothing of the portraits was managed.</p>

  <p>"Then there is the lighting of the room. How was it lighted? None of the
  electric lamps was alight. But&mdash;a piece of a carbon pencil from an arc
  lamp, such as kinematographers use, has been found near the point C, from
  which spot the picture would have been taken and exhibited; and the electric
  light meter showed, about this date, an unaccountable leakage of current such
  as would be explained by the use of an arc lamp.</p>

  <p>"Then the evidence of the witnesses shows the hole in the floor in the
  wrong place. Of course it could not have been a real hole, for the gas and
  electric mains were just underneath. It was probably an oblong of black
  paper. But why was it in the wrong place? The explanation, I suggest, is that
  the picture was taken before the murder (and probably shown before the
  murder, too); that the spot shown was the one in which it was intended to
  bury the body, but that when the floor was taken up after the murder, the
  mains were found underneath and a new spot had to be chosen.</p>

  <p>"Finally&mdash;as to the discrepancies&mdash;what has become of the third
  spectator? The mysterious man who came to the gate and called in these two
  men from the lane&mdash;along which they were known to pass every day at
  about the same time? Who is this mysterious individual? And where is he? Can
  we give him a name? Can we say that he is at this moment in this court,
  sitting amongst the spectators, listening to the pleadings in defence of his
  innocent victims, the prisoners who stand at the bar on their deliverance? I
  affirm, gentlemen, that we can. And more than that it is not permitted to me
  to say."</p>

  <p>He paused, and a strange, impressive hush fell on the court. Men and women
  furtively looked about them; the jury stared openly into the body of the
  court, and the judge, looking up from his notes, cast a searching glance
  among the spectators. Suddenly my eye lighted on Mr. Wicks and his fiance.
  The man was wiping away the sweat that streamed down his ashen, ghastly face;
  the woman had rested her head in her hands, and was trembling as if in an
  ague-fit.</p>

  <p>I was not the only observer. One after another&mdash;spectators, ushers,
  jurymen, counsel, judge&mdash;noticed the terror-stricken pair, until every
  eye in the court was turned on them. And the silence that fell on the place
  was like the silence of the grave.</p>

  <p>It was a dramatic moment. The air was electric; the crowded court tense
  with emotion. And Thorndyke, looking, with his commanding figure and severe
  impassive face, like a personification of Fate and Justices stood awhile
  motionless and silent, letting emotion set the coping-stone on reason.</p>

  <p>At length he resumed his address. "Before concluding," he began, "I have
  to say a few words on another aspect of the case. The learned counsel for the
  prosecution, referring to the motive for this crime, has suggested a desire
  on the part of the prisoners to remove the obstacle to their marriage. But it
  has been given in evidence that there are other persons who had a yet
  stronger and more definite motive for getting rid of the deceased Lucy Bland.
  You have heard that in the event of Bland's death, his partner, Julius Wicks,
  stood to inherit property of the value of six thousand pounds per annum,
  provided that Bland's wife was already dead. Now, the murder of Lucy Bland
  has fulfilled one of the conditions for the devolution of this property; and
  if you should convict and his lordship should sentence the prisoner, Bland,
  then his death on the gallows would fulfil the other condition and this great
  property would pass to his partner, Julius Wicks&mdash;This is a material
  point; as is also the fact that Wicks is, as you have heard, an expert
  film-producer and kinema operator; that he has been proved to have had access
  to the house at Ditton, and that he is engaged to a film-actress.</p>

  <p>"In conclusion, I submit that the evidence of Brodie and Stanton makes it
  certain that they were looking at a moving picture, and that all the other
  evidence confirms that certainty. But the evidence of this moving picture is
  the evidence of a conspiracy to throw suspicion on the prisoners. But a
  conspiracy implies conspirators. And there can be no doubt that those
  conspirators were the actual murderers of Lucy Bland. But if this be so, and
  I affirm that there can be no possible doubt that it is so, then it follows
  that the prisoners are innocent of the crime with which they are charged, and
  I accordingly ask you for a verdict of 'Not Guilty.'"</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke sat down a faint hum arose in the court; but still all eyes
  were turned towards Wicks and Eugenia Kropp. A moment later the pair rose and
  walked unsteadily towards the door. But here, I noticed, Superintendent
  Miller had suddenly appeared and stood at the portal with a uniformed
  constable. As Wicks and Miss Kropp reached the door, I saw the constable
  shake his head. With, or without authority, he was refusing to let them leave
  the court. There was a brief pause. Suddenly there broke out a confused
  uproar; a scuffle, a loud shriek, the report of a pistol and the shattering
  of glass; and then I saw Miller grasping the man's wrists and pinning him to
  the wall, while the shrieking woman struggled with the constable to get to
  the door.</p>

  <p>After the removal of the disturbers&mdash;in custody&mdash;events moved
  swiftly. The Crown counsel's reply was brief and colourless, practically
  abandoning the charge, while the judge's summing-up was a mere prcis of
  Thorndyke's argument with a plain direction for an acquittal. But nothing
  more was needed; for the jury had so clearly made up their minds that the
  clerk had hardly uttered his challenge when the foreman replied with the
  verdict of "Not Guilty." A minute later, when the applause had subsided and
  after brief congratulations by the judge, the prisoners came down from the
  dock, into the court, moist-eyed but smiling, to wring Thorndyke's hands and
  thank him for this wonderful deliverance.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Mayfield&mdash;himself disposed furtively to wipe his
  eyes&mdash;"that is the word. It was wonderful And yet it was all so
  obvious&mdash;when you knew."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="c5"
     id="c5"></a>V. &mdash; A SOWER OF PESTILENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE affectionate relations that existed between Thorndyke
  and his devoted follower, Polton, were probably due, at least in part, to
  certain similarities in their characters. Polton was an accomplished and
  versatile craftsman, a man who could do anything, and do it well; and
  Thorndyke has often said that if he had not been a man of science, he would,
  by choice, have been a skilled craftsman. Even as things were, he was a
  masterly manipulator of all instruments of research, and a good enough
  workman to devise new appliances and processes and to collaborate with his
  assistant in carrying them out.</p>

  <p>Such a collaboration was taking place when the present case opened. It had
  occurred to Thorndyke that lithography might be usefully applied to
  medico-legal research, and on this particular morning he and Polton were
  experimenting in the art of printing from the stone. In the midst of their
  labours the bell from our chambers below was heard to ring, and Polton,
  reluctantly laying down the inking roller and wiping his hands on the
  southern aspect of his trousers, departed to open the door.</p>

  <p>"It's a Mr. Rabbage," he reported on his return. "Says he has an
  appointment with you, sir."</p>

  <p>"So he has," said Thorndyke. "And, as I understand that he is going to
  offer us a profound mystery for solution, you had better come down with me,
  Jervis, and hear what he has to say."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rabbage turned out to be a elderly gentleman who, as we entered,
  peered at us through a pair of deep, concave spectacles and greeted us "with
  a smile that was childlike and bland." Thorndyke looked him over and adroitly
  brought him to the point.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Rabbage, "it is really a most mysterious affair that has
  brought me here. I have already laid it before a very talented detective
  officer whom I know slightly&mdash;a Mr. Badger; but he frankly admitted that
  it was beyond him and strongly advised me to consult you."</p>

  <p>"Inspector Badger was kind enough to pay me a very handsome compliment,"
  said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said that you would certainly be able to solve this mystery
  without any difficulty. So here I am. And perhaps I had better explain who I
  am, in case you don't happen to know my name. I am the director of the St.
  Francis Home of Rest for aged, invalid and destitute cats: an institution
  where these deserving animals are enabled to convert the autumn of their
  troubled lives into a sort of Indian summer of comfort and repose. The home
  is, I may say, my own venture. I support it out of my own means. But I am
  open to receive contributions; and to that end there is secured to the garden
  railings a large box with a wide slit and an inscription inviting donations
  of money, of articles of value, or of food or delicacies for the
  inmates."</p>

  <p>"And do you get much?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Of money," he replied, "very little. Of articles of value, none at all.
  As to gifts of food, they are numerous, but they often display a strange
  ignorance of the habits of the domestic cat. Such things, for instance, as
  pickles and banana-skins, though doubtless kindly meant, are quite unsuitable
  as diet. But the most singular donation that I have ever received was that
  which I found in the box the day before yesterday. There were a number of
  articles, but all apparently from the same donor; and their character was so
  mysterious that I showed them to Mr. Badger, as I have told you, who was as
  puzzled as I was and referred me to you. The collection comprised three
  ladies' purses, a morocco-leather wallet and a small aluminium case. I have
  brought them with me to show you."</p>

  <p>"What did the purses contain?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied Mr. Rabbage, gazing at us with wide-open eyes. "They
  were perfectly empty. That is the astonishing circumstance."</p>

  <p>"And the leather wallet?"</p>

  <p>"Empty, too, excepting for a few odd papers."</p>

  <p>"And the aluminium case?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Mr. Rabbage, "that was the most amazing of all. It
  contained a number of glass tubes! and those tubes contained&mdash;now, what
  do you suppose?" He paused impressively, and then, as neither of us offered a
  suggestion, be answered his own question. "Fleas and lice! Yes, actually!
  Fleas and lice! Isn't that an extraordinary donation?"</p>

  <p>"It is certainly," Thorndyke agreed. "Anyone might have known that, with a
  houseful of cats, you could produce your own fleas."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Mr. Rabbage. "That is what instantly occurred to me, and
  also, I may say, to Mr. Badger. But let me show you the things."</p>

  <p>He produced from a hand-bag and spread out on the table a collection of
  articles which were, evidently, the "husks" of the gleanings of some
  facetious pickpocket, to whom Mr. Rabbage's donation-box must have appeared
  as a perfect God-send. Thorndyke picked up the purses, one after the other,
  and having glanced at their empty interiors, put them aside. The
  letter-wallet he looked through more attentively, but without disturbing its
  contents, and then he took up and opened the aluminium case. This certainly
  was a rather mysterious affair. It opened like a cigarette case. One side was
  fitted with six glass specimen-tubes, each provided with a well-fitting
  parchment cap, perforated with a number of needle-holes; and of the six
  tubes, four contained fleas&mdash;about a dozen in each tube&mdash;some of
  which were dead, but others still alive, and the remaining two lice, all of
  which were dead. In the opposite side of the case, secured with a catch, was
  a thin celluloid note-tablet on which some numbers had been written in
  pencil.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Rabbage, when the examination was finished, "can you
  offer any solution of the mystery?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head gravely. "Not offhand," he replied. "This is a
  matter which will require careful consideration. Leave these things with me
  for further examination and I will let you know, in the course of a few days,
  what conclusion we arrive at."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Rabbage, rising and holding out his hand. "You have
  my address, I think."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch, snatched up his hand-bag and darted to the door;
  and a moment later we heard him bustling down the stairs in the hurried,
  strenuous manner that is characteristic of persons who spend most of their
  lives doing nothing.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised at you, Thorndyke," I said when he had gone, "encouraging
  that ass, Badger, in his silly practical jokes. Why didn't you tell this old
  nincompoop that he had just got a pick-pocket's leavings and have done with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"For the reason, my learned brother, that I haven't done with it. I am a
  little curious as to whose pocket has been picked, and what that person was
  doing with a collection of fleas and lice."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it is any business of yours," said I. "And as to the
  vermin, I should suggest that the owner of the case is an entomologist who
  specialises in epizoa. Probably he is collecting varieties and races."</p>

  <p>"And how," asked Thorndyke, opening the case and handing it to me, "does
  my learned friend account for the faint scent of aniseed that exhales from
  this collection?"</p>

  <p>"I don't account for it at all," said I. "It is a nasty smell. I noticed
  it when you first opened the case. I can only suppose that the flea-merchant
  likes it, or thinks that the fleas do."</p>

  <p>"The latter seems the more probable," said Thorndyke, "for you notice that
  the odour seems to principally from the parchment caps of the four tubes that
  contain fleas. The caps of the louse tubes don't seem to be scented. And now
  let us have a little closer look at the letter-wallet."</p>

  <p>He opened the wallet and took out its contents, which were unilluminating
  enough. Apparently it had been gutted by the pickpocket and only the
  manifestly valueless articles left. One or two bills, recording purchases at
  shops, a time-table, a brief letter in French, without its envelope and
  bearing neither address, date, nor signature, and a set of small maps mounted
  on thin card: this was the whole collection, and not one of the articles
  appeared to furnish the slightest clue to the identity of the owner.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at the letter curiously and read it aloud.</p>

  <p>"It is just a little singular," he remarked, "that this note should be
  addressed to nobody by name, should bear neither address, date, nor
  signature, and should have had its envelope removed. There is almost an
  appearance of avoiding the means of identification. Yet the matter is simple
  and innocent enough: just an appointment to meet at the Mile End Picture
  Palace. But these maps are more interesting; in fact, they are quite
  curious."</p>

  <p>He took them out of the wallet&mdash;lifting them carefully by the edges,
  I noticed&mdash;and laid them out on the table. There were seven cards, and
  each had a map, or rather a section, pasted on both sides. The sections had
  been cut out of a street map of London, and as each card was three inches by
  four and a half, each section represented an area of one mile by a mile and a
  half. They had been very carefully prepared neatly stuck on the cards and
  varnished, and every section bore a distinguishing letter. But the most
  curious feature was a number of small circles drawn in pencil on various
  parts of the maps, each circle enclosing a number.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of those circles, Thorndyke?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"One can only make a speculative hypothesis," he replied. "I am disposed
  to associate them with the fleas and lice. You notice that the maps all
  represent the most squalid parts of East London&mdash;Spitalfields, Bethnal
  Green, Whitechapel, and so forth, where the material would be plentiful; and
  you also notice that the celluloid tablet in the insect case bears a number
  of pencilled jottings that might refer to these maps. Here, for instance, is
  a note, 'B 21 a + b&mdash;,' and you observe that each entry has an a and a b
  with either a plus or a minus sign. Now, if we assume that a means fleas and
  b lice, or vice versa, the maps and the notes together might form a record of
  collections or experiments with a geographical basis."</p>

  <p>"They might," I agreed, "but there isn't a particle of evidence that they
  do. It is a most fantastic hypothesis. We don't know, and we have no reason
  to suppose, that the insect-case and the wallet were the property of the same
  person. And we have no means of finding out whether they were or were
  not."</p>

  <p>"There I think you do us an injustice, Jervis," said he. "Are we not
  lithographers?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see where the lithography comes in," said I.</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to. This is a test case. These maps are varnished, and are
  thus virtually lithographic transfer paper; and the celluloid tablet also has
  a non-absorbent surface. Now, if you handle transfer paper carelessly when
  drawing on it, you are apt to find, when you have transferred to the stone,
  that your finger prints ink up, as well as the drawing. So it is possible
  that if we put these maps and the note-tablet on the stone, we may be able to
  ink up the prints of the fingers that have handled them and so prove whether
  they were or were not the same fingers."</p>

  <p>"That would be interesting as an experiment," said I, "though I don't see
  that it matters two straws whether they were the same or not."</p>

  <p>"Probably it doesn't," he replied, "though it may. But we have a new
  method and we may as well try it."</p>

  <p>We took the things up to the laboratory and explained the problem to
  Polton, who entered into the inquiry with enthusiasm. Producing from a
  cupboard a fresh stone, he picked the maps out of the wallet one by one (with
  a pair of watchmaker's tweezers) and fell to work forthwith on the task of
  transferring the invisible&mdash;and possibly non-existent&mdash;fingerprints
  from the maps and the note-tablet to the stone. I watched him go through the
  various processes in his neat, careful, dexterous fashion and hoped that all
  his trouble would not be in vain. Nor was it; for when he began cautiously
  ink up the stone, it was evident that something was there, though it was not
  so evident what that something was. Presently, however, the vague markings
  took more definite shape, and now could be recognised eight rather confused
  masses of finger-prints, badly smeared, some incomplete, and all mixed up and
  superimposed so as to make the identification of any one print almost an
  impossibility.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked them over dubiously. "It is a dreadful muddle," said he,
  "but I think we can pick out the prints well enough for identification if
  that should be necessary. Which of these is the notes tablet, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"The one in the right-hand top corner, sir," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Thorndyke, "then that answers our question. Confused as the
  impressions are, you can see quite plainly that the left thumb is the same
  thumb as that on the maps."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed after making the comparison, "there is not much doubt that
  they are the same. And now the question is, what about it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; "that is the question." And with this we retired
  from the laboratory, leaving Polton joyfully pulling off proofs.</p>

  <p>During the next few days I had a vague impression that my colleague was
  working at this case, though with what object I could not imagine. Mr.
  Rabbage's problem was too absurd to take seriously, and Thorndyke was beyond
  working out cases, as he used to at one time, for the sake of mere
  experience. However, a day or two later, a genuine case turned up and
  occupied our attention to some purpose.</p>

  <p>It was about six in the evening when Mr. Nicholas Balcombe called on us by
  appointment, and proceeded, in a business-like fashion, to state his
  case.</p>

  <p>"I was advised by my friend Stalker, of the Griffin Life Assurance Office,
  to consult you," said he. "Stalker tells me that you have got him out of
  endless difficulties, and I am hoping that you will be able to help me out of
  mine, though they are not so clearly within your province as Stalker's. But
  you will know about that better than I do.</p>

  <p>"I am the manager of Rutherford's Bank&mdash;the Cornhill Branch&mdash;and
  I have just had a very alarming experience. The day before yesterday, about
  three in the afternoon, a deed-box was handed in with a note from one of our
  customers&mdash;Mr. Pilcher, the solicitor, of Pilcher, Markham and
  Sudburys&mdash;asking us to deposit it in our strong-room and give the bearer
  a receipt for it. Of course this was done, in the ordinary way of business;
  but there was one exceptional circumstance that turns out to have been, as it
  would appear, providential. Owing to the increase of business our strong-room
  had become insufficient for our needs, and we have lately had a second one
  built on the most modern lines and perfectly fire-proof. This had not been
  taken into use when Pilcher's deed-box arrived, but as the old room was very
  full, I opened the new room and saw the deed-box deposited in it.</p>

  <p>"Well, nothing happened up to the time that I left the bank, but about two
  o'clock in the morning the night watchman noticed a smell of burning, and on
  investigating, located the smell as apparently proceeding from the door of
  the new strong-room. He at once reported to the senior clerk, whose turn it
  was to sleep on the premises, and the latter at once telephoned to the police
  station. In a few minutes a police officer arrived with a couple of firemen
  and a hand-extinguisher. The clerk took them down to the strong-room and
  unlocked the door. As soon as it was opened, a volume of smoke and fumes
  burst out, and then they saw the deed-box&mdash;or rather the distorted
  remains of it&mdash;lying on the floor. The police took possession of what
  was left, but a very cursory examination on the spot showed that the box was,
  in effect, an incendiary bomb, with a slow time fuse or some similar
  arrangement."</p>

  <p>"Was any damage done?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Mercifully, no," replied Mr. Balcombe. "But just think of what might have
  happened! If I had put the box in the old strong-room it is certain that
  thousands of pounds' worth of valuable property would have been destroyed. Or
  again, if instead of an incendiary bomb the box had contained a high
  explosive, the whole building would probably have been blown to pieces."</p>

  <p>"What explanation does Pilcher give?"</p>

  <p>"A very simple one. He knows nothing about it. The note was a forgery; and
  on the firm's headed paper, or a perfect imitation of it. And mind you," Mr.
  Balcombe continued, "my experience is not a solitary one. I have made private
  inquiries of other bank managers, and I find that several of them have been
  subjected to similar outrages, some with serious results. And probably there
  are more. They don't talk about these things, you know. Then there are those
  fires: the great timber fire at Stepney, and those big warehouse fires near
  the London Docks; there is something queer about them. It looks as if some
  gang was at work for purposes of pure mischief and destruction."</p>

  <p>"You have consulted the police, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And they know something, I feel sure. But they are extremely
  reticent; so I suppose they don't know enough. At any rate, I should like you
  to investigate the case independently and so would my directors. The position
  is most alarming."</p>

  <p>"Could you let me see Pilcher's letter?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I have brought it with me," said Balcombe. "Thought you would probably
  want to examine it. I will leave it with you; and if we can give you any
  other information or assistance, we shall be only too glad."</p>

  <p>"Was the box brought by hand?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Balcombe, "but I didn't see the bearer. I can get you a
  description from the man who received the package, if that would be any
  use."</p>

  <p>"We may as well have it," said Thorndyke, "and the name and address of the
  person giving it, in case he is wanted as a witness."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it," said Balcombe, rising and picking up his hat. "I will
  see to it myself. And you will let me know, in due course, if any information
  comes to hand?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke gave the required promise and our client took his leave.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said with a laugh, as the brisk footsteps died away on the
  stairs, "you have had a very handsome compliment paid you. Our friend seems
  to think that you are one of those master craftsmen who can make bricks, not
  only without straw, but without clay. There's absolutely nothing to go
  on."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly rather in the air," Thorndyke agreed. "There is this
  letter and the description of the man who left the packet, when we get it,
  and neither of them is likely to help us much."</p>

  <p>He looked over the letter and its envelope, held the former up to the
  light and then handed them to me.</p>

  <p>"We ought to find out whether this is Pilcher's own paper or an
  imitation," said I, when I had examined the letter and envelope without
  finding anything in the least degree distinctive or characteristic; "because,
  if it is their paper, the unknown man must have had some sort of connection
  with their establishment or staff."</p>

  <p>"There must have been some sort of connection in any case," said
  Thorndyke. "Even an imitation implies possession of an original. But you are
  quite right. It is a line of inquiry, and practically the only one that
  offers."</p>

  <p>The inquiry was made on the following day, and the fact clearly
  established that the paper was Pitcher's paper, but the ink was not their
  ink. The handwriting appeared to be disguised, and no one connected with the
  firm was able to recognise it. The staff, even to the caretaker, were all
  eminently respectable and beyond suspicion of being implicated in an affair
  of the kind.</p>

  <p>"But after all," said Mr. Pitcher, "there are a hundred ways in which a
  sheet of paper may go astray if anyone wants it: at the printer's, the
  stationer's, or even in this office&mdash;for the paper is always in the
  letter-rack on the table."</p>

  <p>Thus our only clue&mdash;if so it could be called&mdash;came to an end,
  and I waited with some curiosity to see what Thorndyke would do next. But so
  far as I could see, he did nothing, nor did he make any reference to this
  obscure case during the next few days. We had a good deal of other work on
  hand, and I assumed that this fully occupied his attention.</p>

  <p>One evening, about a week later, he made the first reference to the case
  and a very mysterious communication it seemed to me.</p>

  <p>"I have projected a little expedition for to-morrow," said he. "I am
  proposing to spend the day, or part of it, in the pastoral region of Bethnal
  Green."</p>

  <p>"In connection with any of our cases?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Balcombe's. I have been making some cautious inquiries
  with Polton's assistance, principally among hawkers and coffee-shop keepers,
  and I think I have struck a promising track."</p>

  <p>"What kind of inquiries have you been making?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for a man, or men, engaged in giving street
  entertainments. That is what our data seemed to suggest, among other
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"Our data!" I exclaimed. "I didn't know we had any."</p>

  <p>"We had Balcombe's account of the attempt to burn the bank. That gave us
  some hint as to the kind of man to look for. And there were certain other
  data, which my learned friend may recall."</p>

  <p>"I don't recall anything suggesting a street entertainer," said I.</p>

  <p>"Not directly," he replied. "It was one of several hypotheses, but it is
  probably the correct one, as I have heard of such a person as I had assumed,
  and have ascertained where he is likely to be found on certain days.
  To-morrow I propose to go over his beat in the hope of getting a glimpse of
  him. If you think of coming with me, I may remind you that it is not a dressy
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>On the following morning we set forth about ten o'clock, and as raiment
  which is inconspicuous at Bethnal Green may be rather noticeable in the
  Temple, we slipped out by the Tudor Street gate and made our way to
  Blackfriars Station. In place of the usual "research-case," I noticed that
  Thorndyke was carrying a somewhat shabby wood-fibre attach case, and that he
  had no walking-stick. We got out at Aldgate and presently struck up Vallance
  Street in the direction of Bethnal Green; and by the brisk pace and the
  direct route adopted, I judged that Thorndyke had a definite objective.
  However, when we entered the maze of small streets adjoining the Bethnal
  Green Road, our pace was reduced to a saunter, and at corners and crossroads
  Thorndyke halted from time to time to look along the streets; and
  occasionally he referred to a card which he produced from his pocket, on
  which were written the names of streets and days of the week.</p>

  <p>A couple of hours passed in this apparently aimless perambulation of the
  back streets.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look as if you were going to have much luck," I remarked,
  suppressing a yawn. "And I am not sure that we are not, in our turn, being
  'spotted'. I have noted a man&mdash;a small, shabby-looking fellow,
  apparently keeping us in view from a distance, though I don't see him at the
  moment."</p>

  <p>"It is quite likely," said Thorndyke. "This is a shady neighbourhood, and
  any native could see that we don't belong to it. Good morning! Taking a
  little fresh air?"</p>

  <p>The latter question was addressed to a man who was standing at the door of
  a small coffee-shop, having apparently come to the surface for a
  "breather."</p>

  <p>"Dunno about fresh," was the reply, "but it's the best there is. By the
  by, I saw one of them blokes what I was a-tellin' you about go by just now.
  Foreigner with the rats. If you want to see him give a show, I expect you'll
  find him in that bit of waste ground off Bolter's Rents."</p>

  <p>"Bolter's Rents?" Thorndyke repeated. "Is that a turning out of Salcombe
  Street?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," was the reply. "Half-way up on the right-hand side."</p>

  <p>Thanking our informant, Thorndyke strode off up the street, and as we
  turned the next corner I glanced back. At the moment, the small man whom I
  had noticed before stepped out of a doorway and came after us at a pace
  suggesting anxiety not to lose sight of us.</p>

  <p>Bolter's Rents turned out to be a wide paved alley, one side of which
  opened into a patch of waste ground where a number of old houses had been
  demolished. This space had an unspeakably squalid appearance; for not only
  had the debris of the demolished houses been left in unsavoury heaps, but the
  place had evidently been adopted by the neighbourhood as a general
  dumping-ground for household refuse. The earth was strewn with vegetable, and
  even animal, leavings; flies and bluebottles hummed around and settled in
  hundreds on the garbage, and the air was pervaded by an odour like that of an
  old-fashioned brick dust-bin.</p>

  <p>But in spite of these trifling disadvantages, a considerable crowd had
  collected, mainly composed of women and children; and at the centre of the
  crowd a man was giving an entertainment with a troupe of performing rats. We
  had sauntered slowly up the Rents and now halted to look on. At the moment, a
  white rat was climbing a pole at the top of which a little flag was stuck in
  a socket. We watched him rapidly climb the pole, seize the flagstaff in his
  teeth, lift it out of the socket, climb down the pole and deliver the flag to
  his master. Then a little carriage was produced and the rat harnessed into
  it, another white rat being dressed in a cloak and placed in the seat, and
  the latter&mdash;introduced to the audience as Lady Murphy&mdash;was taken
  for a drive round the stage.</p>

  <p>While the entertainment was proceeding I inspected the establishment and
  its owner. The stage was composed of light hinged boards opened out on a
  small four-wheeled hand-cart, apparently home-made. At one end was a largish
  cage, divided by a wire partition into two parts, one of which contained a
  number of white and piebald rats, while the inmates of the other compartment
  were all wild rats; but not, I noted, the common brown or Norway rat, but the
  old-fashioned British black rat. I remarked upon the circumstance to
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "they were probably caught locally. The sewers here will
  be inhabited by brown rats, but the houses, in an old neighbourhood like
  this, will be infested principally by the black rat. What do you make of the
  exhibitor?"</p>

  <p>I had already noticed him, and now unobtrusively examined him again. He
  was a medium-sized man with a sallow complexion, dark, restless
  eyes&mdash;which frequently wandered in our direction&mdash;a crop of stiff,
  bushy, upstanding hair&mdash;he wore no hat&mdash;and a ragged beard.</p>

  <p>"A Slav of some kind, I should think," was my reply; "a Russian, or
  perhaps a Lett. But that beard is not perfectly convincing."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed, "but it is a good make up. Perhaps we had better
  move on now; we have a deputy, you observe."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the small man whom I had observed following us strolled up
  the Rents; and as he drew nearer, revealed to my astonished gaze no less a
  person than our ingenious laboratory assistant, Polton. Strangely altered,
  indeed, was our usually neat and spruce artificer with his seedy clothing and
  grubby hands; but as he sauntered up, profoundly unaware of our existence, a
  faint reminiscence of the familiar crinkly smile stole across his face.</p>

  <p>We were just moving off when a chorus of shrieks mingled with laughter
  arose from the spectators, who hastily scattered right and left, and I had a
  momentary glimpse of a big black rat bounding across the space, to disappear
  into one of the many heaps of debris. It seemed that the exhibitor had just
  opened the cage to take out a black rat when one of the waiting
  performers&mdash;presumably a new recruit&mdash;had seized the opportunity to
  spring out and escape.</p>

  <p>"Well," a grinning woman remarked to me, genially, "there's plenty more
  where that one came from. You should see this place on a moonlight night!
  Fair alive with 'em it is."</p>

  <p>We sauntered up the Rents and along the cross street at the top; and as we
  went, I reflected on the very singular inquiry in which Thorndyke seemed to
  be engaged. The rat-tamer's appearance was suspicious. He didn't quite look
  the part, and his beard was almost certainly a make-up&mdash;and a skilful
  one, too, for it was no mere "property" beard; and the restless, furtive
  eyes, and a certain suppressed excitement in his bearing, hinted at something
  more than met the eye. But if this was Mr. Balcombe's incendiary, how had
  Thorndyke arrived at his identity, and, above all, by what process of
  reasoning had he contrived to associate the bank outrage with performing
  rats? That he had done so, his systematic procedure made quite clear. But
  how? It had seemed to me that we had not a single fact on which to start an
  investigation.</p>

  <p>We had walked the length of the cross street, and had halted before
  turning, when a troop of children emerged from the Rents. Then came the
  exhibitor, towing his cart, with the cage shrouded in a cloth, then more
  children, and finally, at a little distance, Polton, slouching along idly but
  keeping the cart in view.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "it would be instructive, as a study in urban
  sanitation, to have a look round the scene of the late exhibition."</p>

  <p>We retraced our steps down Bolter's Rents, now practically deserted, and
  wandered around the patch of waste land and in among the piles of bricks and
  rotting timber where the houses had been pulled down.</p>

  <p>"Your lady friend was right," said Thorndyke. "This is a perfect Paradise
  for rats. Convenient residences among the ruins and unlimited provisions to
  be had for the mere picking up."</p>

  <p>"Apparently you were right, too," said I, "as to the species inhabiting
  these eligible premises. That seems to be a black rat," and I pointed to a
  deceased specimen that lay near the entrance to a burrow.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke stooped over the little corpse, and after a brief inspection,
  drew a glove on his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "this is a typical specimen of Mus rattus, though it is
  unusually light in colour. I think it will be worth taking away to examine at
  our leisure."</p>

  <p>Glancing round to see that we were unobserved, he opened his attach case
  and took from it a largish tin canister and removed the lid&mdash;which, I
  noted, was anointed at the joint with vaseline. Stooping, he picked up the
  dead rat by the tail with his gloved fingers dropped it into the canister,
  clapped on the lid, and replaced it in the attache case. Then he pulled off
  the glove and threw it on a rubbish heap.</p>

  <p>"You are mighty particular," said I.</p>

  <p>"A dead rat is a dirty thing," said he, "and it was only an old
  glove."</p>

  <p>On our way home I made various cautious attempt to extract from Thorndyke
  some hint as to the purpose of his investigation and his mode of procedure.
  But I could extract nothing from him beyond certain generalities.</p>

  <p>"When a man," said he, "introduces an incendiary bomb into the strong-room
  of a bank, we may reasonably inquire as to his motives. And when we have
  reached the fairly obvious conclusion as to what those motives must be, we
  may ask ourselves what kind of conduct such motives will probably generate;
  that is, what sort of activities will be likely to be associated with such
  motives and with the appropriate state of mind. And when we have decided on
  that, too, we may look for a person engaged in those activities; and if we
  find such a person we may consider that we have a prima facie case. The rest
  is a matter of verification."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well, Thorndyke," I objected, "but if I find a man
  trying to set fire to a bank, I don't immediately infer that his customary
  occupation is exhibiting performing rats in a back street of Bethnal
  Green."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed quietly. "My learned friend's observation is perfectly
  just. It is not a universal rule. But we are dealing with a specific case in
  which certain other facts are known to us. Still, the connection, if there is
  one, has yet to be established. This exhibitor may turn out not to be
  Balcombe's man after all."</p>

  <p>"And if he is not?"</p>

  <p>"I think we shall want him all the same; but I shall know better in a
  couple of hours' time."</p>

  <p>What transpired during those two hours I did not discover at the time, for
  I had an engagement to dine with some legal friends and must needs hurry away
  as soon as I had purified myself from the effects of our travel in the
  unclean East. When I returned to our chambers, about half-past ten, I found
  Thorndyke seated in his easy chair immersed in a treatise on old musical
  instruments. Apparently he had finished with the case.</p>

  <p>"How did Polton get on?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Admirably," replied Thorndyke. "He shadowed our entertaining friend from
  Bethnal Green to a by street in Ratcliff, where he apparently resides. But he
  did more than that. We had made up a little book of a dozen leaves of
  transfer paper in which I wrote in French some infallible rules for taming
  rats. Just as the man was going into his house, Polton accosted him and asked
  him for an expert opinion on these directions. The foreign gentleman was at
  first impatient and huffy, but when he had glanced at the book, he became
  interested, and a good deal amused, and finally read the whole set of rules
  through attentively. Then he handed the book back to Polton and recommended
  him to follow the rules carefully, offering to supply him with a few rats to
  experiment on, an offer which Polton asked him to hold over for a day or
  two.</p>

  <p>"As soon as he got home, Polton dismembered the book and put the leaves
  down on the stone, with this result."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket-book a number of small pieces of paper, each of
  which was marked more or less distinctly with lithographed reproductions of
  fingerprints, and laid them on the table. I looked through them attentively,
  and with a faint sense of familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that left thumb," said I, "rather similar to the print on the maps
  from Mr. Rabbage's letter wallet?"</p>

  <p>"It is identical," he replied. "Here are the proofs of the map-prints and
  the note-tablet. If you compare them you can see that not only the left thumb
  but the other prints are the same in all."</p>

  <p>Careful comparison showed that this was so.</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "I don't understand this at all. These are the
  finger-prints of Mr. Rabbage's mysterious entomologist. I thought you were
  looking for Balcombe's man."</p>

  <p>"My impression," he replied "is that they are the same person, though the
  evidence is far from conclusive. But we shall soon know. I have sworn an
  information against the foreign gent, and Miller has arranged to raid the
  house at Ratcliff early to-morrow and as it promises to be a highly
  interesting event, I propose to be present. Shall I have the pleasure of my
  learned friend's company?"</p>

  <p>"Most undoubtedly," I replied, "though I am absolutely in the dark as to
  the meaning of the whole affair."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I recommend you to go over the history of both
  cases systematically in the interval."</p>

  <p>Six o'clock on the following morning found us in an empty house in Old
  Gravel Lane, Ratcliff, in company with Superintendent Miller and three
  stalwart plain clothes men, awaiting the report of a patrol. We were all
  dressed in engineers' overalls, reeking with naphthalin. Our trousers were
  tucked into our socks, and socks and boots were thickly smeared with
  vaseline, as were our wrists, around which our sleeves were bound closely
  with tape. These preparations, together with an automatic pistol served out
  to each of us, gave me some faint inkling of the nature of the case, though
  it was still very confused in my mind.</p>

  <p>About a quarter-past six a messenger arrived and reported that the house
  which was to be raided was open. Thereupon Miller and one of his men set
  forth, and the rest of us followed at short intervals. On arriving at the
  house, which was but a short distance from our rendezvous, we found a stolid
  plain-clothes man guarding the open door and a frowsy-looking woman, who
  carried a jug of milk, angrily demanding in very imperfect English to be
  allowed to pass into her house. Pushing past the protesting housekeeper, we
  entered the grimy passage, where Miller was just emerging from a ground-floor
  room.</p>

  <p>"That is the woman's quarters," said he, "and the kitchen seems to be a
  sort of rat-menagerie. We'd better try the first-floor."</p>

  <p>He led the way up the stairs, and when he reached the landing he tried the
  handle of the front room. Finding the door locked or bolted, he passed on to
  the back room and tried the door of that, with the same result. Then, holding
  up a warning finger, he proceeded to whistle a popular air in a fine,
  penetrating tone, and to perform a double shuffle on the bare floor. Almost
  immediately an angry voice was heard in the front room, and slippered feet
  padded quickly across the floor. Then a bolt was drawn noisily, the door flew
  open, and for an instant I had a view of the rat-show man, clothed in a suit
  of very soiled pyjamas. But it was only for an instant. Even as our eyes met,
  he tried to slam the door to, and failing&mdash;in consequence of an
  intruding constabulary foot&mdash;he sprang back, leaped over a bed and
  darted through a communicating doorway into the back room and shut and bolted
  the door.</p>

  <p>"That's unfortunate," said Miller. "Now we're going to have trouble."</p>

  <p>The superintendent was right. On the first attempt to force the door, a
  pistol-shot from within blew a hole in the top panel and made a notch in the
  ear of the would-be invader. The latter replied through the hole, and there
  followed a sort of snarl and the sound of a shattered bottle. Then, as the
  constable stood aside and shot after shot came from within, the door became
  studded with ragged holes. Meanwhile Miller, Thorndyke and I tiptoed out on
  the landing, and taking as long a run as was possible, flung ourselves,
  simultaneously on the back-room door. The weight of three large men was too
  much for the crazy woodwork. As we fell on it together, there was a bursting
  crash, the hinges tore away, the door flew inwards, and we staggered into the
  room.</p>

  <p>It was a narrow shave for some of us. Before we could recover our footing,
  the showman had turned with his pistol pointing straight at Miller's head. A
  bare instant before it exploded, Thorndyke, whose momentum had carried him
  half-way across the room, caught it with an upward snatch, and its report was
  followed by a harmless shower of plaster from the ceiling. Immediately our
  quarry changed his tactics. Leaving the pistol in Thorndyke's grasp, he
  darted across the room towards a work-bench on which stood a row of upright,
  cylindrical tins. He was in the act of reaching out for one of these when
  Thorndyke grasped his pyjamas between the shoulders and dragged him back,
  while Miller rushed forward and seized him. For a few moments there was a
  frantic and furious struggle, for the fellow fought with hands and feet and
  teeth with the ferocity of a wild cat, and, overpowered as he was, still
  strove to drag his captors towards the bench. Suddenly, once more, a
  pistol-shot rang out, and then all was still. By accident or design the
  struggling man had got hold of the pistol that Thorndyke still grasped and
  pressed the trigger, and the bullet had entered his own head just above the
  ear.</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Miller, rising and wiping his forehead, "that was a near
  one. If you hadn't stopped him, doctor, we'd all have gone up like
  rockets."</p>

  <p>"You think those things are bombs, then?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Think!" he repeated. "I removed two exactly like them from the General
  Post Office, and they turned out to be charged with T.N.T. And those square
  ones on the shelf are twin brothers of the one that went off in Rutherford's
  Bank."</p>

  <p>As we were speaking, I happened to glance round at the doorway, and there,
  to my surprise, was the woman whom we had seen below, still holding the jug
  of milk and staring in with an expression of horror at the dead
  revolutionary. Thorndyke also observed her, and stepping across to where she
  stood, asked: "Can you tell me if there has been, or is now, anyone sick in
  this house?</p>

  <p>"Yes," the woman replied, without removing her eyes from the dead man.
  "Dere is a chentleman sick upstairs. I haf not seen him. He used to look
  after him," and she nodded to the dead body of the showman.</p>

  <p>"I think we will go up and have a look at this sick gentleman," said
  Thorndyke. "You had better not come, Miller."</p>

  <p>We started together up the stairs, and as we went I asked: "Do you suppose
  this is a case of plague?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "I fancy the plague department is in the kitchen; but we
  shall see."</p>

  <p>He looked round the landing which we had now reached and then opened the
  door of the front room, Immediately I was aware of a strange, intensely fetid
  odour, and glancing into the room, I perceived a man lying, apparently in a
  state of stupor, in a bed covered with indescribably filthy bed-clothes.
  Thorndyke entered and approached the bed, and I followed. The light was
  rather dim, and it was not until we were quite close that I suddenly
  recognised the disease.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I exclaimed, "it is typhus!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; "and look at the bed clothes, and look at the poor
  devil's neck. We can see now how that villain collected his specimens."</p>

  <p>I stooped over the poor, muttering, unconscious wretch and was filled with
  horror. Bed-clothes, pillow and patient were all alike crawling with
  vermin.</p>
  <hr align="center"
      width="25%">

  <p>"Of course," I said as we walked homewards, "I see the general drift of
  this case, but what I can't under stand is how you connected up the
  facts."</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Thorndyke, "let us set out the argument and trace the
  connections. The starting-point was the aluminium case that Mr. Rabbage
  brought us. Those tubes of fleas and lice were clearly an abnormal
  phenomenon. They might, as you suggested, have belonged to a scientific
  collector; but that was not probable. The fleas were alive, and were meant to
  remain alive, as the perforated caps of the tubes proved, And the lice had
  merely died, as lice quickly do if they are not fed. They did not appear to
  have been killed. But against your view there were two very striking facts,
  one of which I fancy you did not observe. The fleas were not the common human
  flea; they were Asiatic rat-fleas."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," I admitted. "I did not notice that."</p>

  <p>"Then," he continued, "there was the aniseed with which the parchment caps
  of the tubes were scented. Now aniseed is irresistible to rats. It is an
  infallible bait. But it is not specially attractive to fleas. What then was
  the purpose of the scent? The answer, fantastic as it was, had to be
  provisionally accepted because it was the only one that suggested itself. If
  one of these tubes had been exposed to rats&mdash;dropped down a rat-hole,
  for instance&mdash;it is certain that the rats would have gnawed off the
  parchment cap. Then the fleas would have been liberated, and as they were
  rat-fleas, they would have immediately fastened upon the rats. The tubes,
  therefore, appeared to be an apparatus for disseminating rat-fleas.</p>

  <p>"But why should anyone want to disseminate rat-fleas? That question at
  once brought into view another striking fact, Here, in these tubes, were
  rat-fleas and body-lice: both carriers of deadly disease. The rat-flea is a
  carrier of plague; the body-louse is a carrier of typhus. It was an
  impressive coincidence. It suggested that the dissemination of rat-fleas
  might be really the dissemination of plague; and if the lice were
  distributed, too, that might mean the distribution of typhus.</p>

  <p>"And now consider the maps. The circles on them all marked old slum-areas
  tenanted by low-class aliens. But old slums abound in rats; and low-class
  aliens abound in body-lice. Here was another coincidence. Then there was the
  note-tablet bearing numbers associated with the letters a and b and plus and
  minus signs. The letters a and b might mean rat and louse or plague and
  typhus, and the plus and minus might mean a success or a failure to produce
  an outbreak of disease. That was merely speculative, but it was quite
  consistent.</p>

  <p>"So far we were dealing with a hypothesis based on simple observation. But
  that hypothesis could be proved or disproved. The question was: Were these
  insects infected insects, or were they not? To settle this I took one flea
  from each of the four tubes and 'sowed' it on agar, with the result that from
  each flea I got a typical culture of plague bacillus, which I verified with
  Haffkine's 'Stalactite test.' I also examined one louse from each of the two
  tubes, and in each case got a definite typhus reaction. So the insects were
  infected and the hypothesis was confirmed.</p>

  <p>"The next thing was to find the owner of the tubes. Now the circles on the
  maps indicated some sort of activity, presumably connected with rats and
  carried on in these areas.</p>

  <p>"I visited those areas and got into conversation with the inhabitants on
  the subject of rats, rat-catchers, rat pits, sewermen, and everything bearing
  on rats; and at length I heard of an exhibitor of performing rats. You know
  the rest. We found the man, we observe that all his rats, excepting the tame
  white ones, were black rats&mdash;the special plague-carrying
  species&mdash;and we found on this spot a dead rat, which I ascertained on
  examining the body, had died of plague. Finally there was Polton's little
  book giving us the finger prints of the owner of the aluminium case. That
  completed the identification; and inquiries at the Local Government Board
  showed that cases of plague and typhus had occurred in the marked areas."</p>

  <p>"Had not the authorities taken any steps in the matter?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he replied. "They had carried out an energetic rat campaign in
  the London Docks, the likeliest source of infection. Naturally, they would
  not think of a criminal lunatic industriously sowing plague broadcast."</p>

  <p>"Then how did you connect this man with the bank outrage?"</p>

  <p>"I never did, very conclusively," he replied. "It was mostly a matter of
  inference. You see, the two crimes were essentially similar. They were
  varieties of the same type. Both were cases of idiotic destructiveness, and
  the agent in each was evidently a moral imbecile who was a professed enemy of
  society. Such persons are rare in this country, and when they occur are
  usually foreigners, most commonly Russians, or East Europeans of some kind.
  The only actual clue was the date on Pilcher's letter, the rather peculiar
  figures of which were extraordinarily like those on the maps and the
  note-tablet. Still, it was little more than a guess, though it happens to
  have turned out correct."</p>

  <p>"And how do you suppose this fellow avoided getting plague and typhus
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"It was quite likely that he had had both. But he could easily avoid the
  typhus by keeping himself clean and his clothing disinfected; and as to the
  plague, he could have used Haffkine's plague-prophylactic and given it to the
  woman. Clearly it would not have suited him to have a case of plague in the
  house and have the health officer inspecting the premises."</p>

  <p>That was the end of the case, unless I should include in the history a
  very handsome fee sent to my colleague by the President of the Local
  Government Board.</p>

  <p>"I think we have earned it," said Thorndyke; "and yet I am not sure that
  Mr. Rabbage is not entitled to a share."</p>

  <p>And in fact, when that benevolent person called a few days later to
  receive a slightly ambiguous report and tender his fee, he departed beaming,
  bearing a donation wherewith to endow an additional bed, cot, or basket, in
  the St. Francis Home of Rest.</p>

  <h2><a name="c6"
     id="c6"></a>VI. &mdash; REX V. BURNABY</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is a normal incident in general medical practice that the
  family doctor soon drifts into the position of a family friend. The Burnabys
  had been among my earliest patients, and mutual sympathies had quickly
  brought about the more intimate relationship. It was a pleasant household,
  pervaded by a quiet geniality and a particularly attractive homely,
  unaffected culture. It was an interesting household, too, for the disparity
  in age between the husband and wife made the domestic conditions a little
  unusual and invited speculative observation. And there were other matters, to
  be referred to presently.</p>

  <p>Frank Burnaby was a somewhat delicate man of about fifty: quiet, rather
  shy, gentle, kindly, and singularly innocent and trustful. He held a post at
  the Records Office, and was full of quaint and curious lore derived from the
  ancient documents on which he worked: selections from which he would retail
  in the family circle with a picturesque imagination and a fund of quiet, dry
  humour that made them delightful to listen to. I have never met a more
  attractive man, or one whom I liked better or respected more.</p>

  <p>Equally attractive, in an entirely different way, was his wife: an
  extremely charming and really beautiful woman of under thirty&mdash;little
  more than a girl, in fact: amiable, high-spirited and full of fun and frolic,
  but nevertheless an accomplished, cultivated woman with a strong interest in
  her husband's pursuits. They appeared to me an exceedingly happy and united
  couple deeply attached to one another and in perfect sympathy. There were
  four children&mdash;three boys and a girl&mdash;of Burnaby's by his first
  wife; and their devotion to their young stepmother spoke volumes for her care
  of them.</p>

  <p>But there was a fly in the domestic ointment: at least, that was what I
  felt. There was another family friend, a youngish man named Cyril Parker. Not
  that I had anything against him, personally, but I was not quite happy about
  the relationship. He was a markedly good-looking man, pleasant, witty, and
  extremely well informed; for he was a partner in a publishing house and acted
  as reader for the firm; whence it happened that he, like Mr. Burnaby,
  gathered stores of interesting matter from his professional reading. But I
  could not disguise from myself that his admiration and affection for Mrs.
  Burnaby were definitely inside the danger zone, and that the
  intimacy&mdash;on his side, at any rate&mdash;was growing rather ominously.
  On her side there seemed nothing more than frank, though very pronounced,
  friendship. But I looked at the relationship askance. She was a woman whom
  any man might have fallen in love with, and I did not like the expression
  that I sometimes detected in Parker's eyes when he was looking at her. Still,
  there was nothing in the conduct of either to which the slightest exception
  could have been taken or which in any way foreshadowed the terrible disaster
  which was so shortly to befall.</p>

  <p>The starting-point of the tragedy was a comparatively trivial event. By
  much poring over crabbed manuscripts, Mr. Burnaby developed symptoms of
  eye-strain which caused me to send him to an oculist for an opinion and a
  prescription for suitable spectacles. On the evening of the day on which he
  had consulted the oculist, I received an urgent summons from Mrs. Burnaby,
  and, on arriving at the house, found her husband somewhat seriously ill. His
  symptoms were rather puzzling, for they corresponded to no known disease. His
  face was flushed, his temperature slightly raised, his pulse rapid, though
  the breathing was slow, his throat was excessively dry, and his pupils widely
  dilated. It was an extraordinary condition, resembling nothing within my
  knowledge excepting atropine poisoning.</p>

  <p>"Has he been taking medicine of any kind?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Burnaby shook her head. "He never takes any drugs or medicine but
  what you prescribe; and it couldn't be anything that he has taken, because
  the attack came on quite soon after he came home, before he had either food
  or drink."</p>

  <p>It was very mysterious and the patient himself could throw no light on the
  origin of the attack. While I was reflecting on the matter, I happened to
  glance at the mantelpiece, on which I noticed a drop labelled "The Eye Drops"
  and a prescription envelope. Opening the latter I found the oculist's
  prescription for the drops&mdash;a very weak solution of atropine
  sulphate.</p>

  <p>"Has he had any of these drops?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Burnaby. "I dropped some into his eyes as soon as he
  came in; two drops in each eye, according to the directions."</p>

  <p>It was very odd. The amount of atropine in those four drops was less than
  a hundredth of a grain; an impossibly small dose to produce the symptoms. Yet
  he had all the appearance of having taken a poisonous dose, which he
  obviously had not, since the drop-bottle was nearly full. I could make
  nothing of it. However, I treated it as a case of atropine poisoning; and as
  the treatment produced marked improvement, I went home, more mystified than
  ever.</p>

  <p>When I called on the following morning, I learned that he was practically
  well, and had gone to his office. But that evening I had another urgent
  message, and on hurrying round to Burnaby's house, found him suffering from
  an attack similar to, but even more severe than, the one on the previous day.
  I immediately administered an injection of pilocarpine and other appropriate
  remedies, and had the satisfaction of seeing a rapid improvement in his
  condition. But whereas the efficacy of the treatment proved that the symptoms
  were really due to atropine, no atropine appeared to have been taken
  excepting the minute quantity contained in the eye-drops.</p>

  <p>It was very mysterious. The most exhaustive inquiries failed to suggest
  any possible source of the poison excepting the drops; and as each attack had
  occurred a short time after the use of them, it was impossible to ignore the
  apparent connection, in spite of the absurdly minute dose.</p>

  <p>"I can only suppose," said I, addressing Mrs. Burnaby and Mr. Parker, who
  had called to make inquiries, "that Burnaby is the subject of an
  idiosyncrasy&mdash;that he is abnormally sensitive to this drug."</p>

  <p>"Is that a known condition?" asked Parker.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," I replied. "People vary enormously in the way in which they
  react to drugs. Some are so intolerant of particular drugs&mdash;iodine, for
  instance&mdash;that ordinary medicinal doses produce poisonous effects, while
  others have the most extraordinary tolerance. Christisori, in his Treatise on
  Poisons, gives a case of a man, unaccustomed to opium, who took nearly an
  ounce of laudanum without any effect&mdash;a dose that would have killed an
  ordinary man. These drugs are terrible pitfalls for the doctor who doesn't
  know his patient. Just think what might have happened to Burnaby if someone
  had given him a full medicinal dose of belladonna."</p>

  <p>"Does belladonna have the same effect as atropine?" asked Mrs.
  Burnaby.</p>

  <p>"It is the same," I replied. "Atropine is the active principle of
  belladonna."</p>

  <p>"What a mercy," she exclaimed, "that we discovered this idiosyncrasy in
  time. I suppose he had better discontinue the drops?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "most emphatically; and I will write to Mr. Haines and
  let him know that the atropine is impracticable."</p>

  <p>I accordingly wrote to the oculist, who was politely sceptical as to the
  connection between the drops and the attacks. However, Burnaby settled the
  matter by refusing point-blank to have any further dealings with atropine;
  and his decision was so far justified that, for the time being, the attacks
  did not recur.</p>

  <p>A couple of months passed. The incident had, to a great extent, faded from
  my mind. But then it was revived in a way that not only filled me with
  astonishment but caused me very grave anxiety. I was just about to set out on
  my morning round when Burnaby's housemaid met me at my door, breathing
  quickly and carrying a note. It was from Mrs. Burnaby, begging me to call at
  once and telling me that her husband had been seized by an attack similar to
  the previous ones. I ran back for my emergency bag and then hurried round to
  the house, where I found Burnaby lying on a sofa, very flushed, rather
  alarmed, and exhibiting well-marked symptoms of atropine poisoning. The
  attack, however, was not a very severe one, and the application of the
  appropriate remedies soon produced a change for the better.</p>

  <p>"Now, Burnaby," I said, as he sat up with a sigh of relief, "what have you
  been up to? Haven't been tinkering with those drops again?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "Why should I? Haines has finished with my eyes."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've been taking something with atropine in it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I have, but I can't imagine what. I have had no medicine of any
  kind."</p>

  <p>"No pills, lozenges, liniment, plaster, or ointment?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing medicinal of any sort," he replied. "In fact, I have swallowed
  nothing to-day but my breakfast; and the attack came on directly after,
  though it was a simple enough meal, goodness knows&mdash;just a couple of
  pigeon's eggs and some toast and tea."</p>

  <p>"Pigeon's eggs," said I, with a grin, "why not sparrow's?"</p>

  <p>"Cyril sent them&mdash;as a joke, I think," Mrs. Burnaby explained (Cyril,
  of course, was Mr. Parker), "but I must say Frank enjoyed them. You see,
  Cyril has taken lately to keeping pigeons and rabbits and other edible
  beasts, and I think he has done it principally for Frank's sake, as you have
  ordered him a special diet. We are constantly getting things from Cyril
  now&mdash;pigeons and rabbits especially; and much younger than we can buy
  them at the shops."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Burnaby, "he is most generous. I should think he supplies more
  than half my diet. I hardly like to accept so much from him."</p>

  <p>"It gives him pleasure to send these gifts," said Mrs. Burnaby; "but I
  wish it gave him pleasure to slaughter the creatures first. He always brings
  or sends them alive, and the cook hates killing them. As to me, I couldn't do
  it, though I deal with the corpses afterwards. I prepare nearly all Frank's
  food myself."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Burnaby, with a glance of deep affection at his wife,
  "Margaret is an artist in kickshaws and I consume the works of art. I can
  tell you, doctor, I live like a fighting cock."</p>

  <p>This was all very well, but it was beside the question; which was, where
  did the atropine come from? If Burnaby had swallowed nothing but his
  breakfast, it would seem that the atropine must have been in that. I pointed
  this out.</p>

  <p>"But you know, doctor," said Burnaby, "that isn't possible. We can write
  the eggs off. You can't get poison into an egg without making a hole in the
  shell, and these eggs were intact. And as to the bread and butter, and the
  tea, we all had the same, and none of the others seem any the worse."</p>

  <p>"That isn't very conclusive," said I. "A dose of atropine that would be
  poisonous to you would probably have no appreciable effect on the others.
  But, of course, the real mystery is how on earth atropine could have got into
  any of the food."</p>

  <p>"It couldn't," said Burnaby and that really was my own conviction. But it
  was an unsatisfactory conclusion, for it left the mystery unexplained; and
  when a length I took my leave, to continue my rounds of visits, it was with
  the uncomfortable feeling that I had failed to trace the origin of the danger
  or to secure my patient against its recurrence.</p>

  <p>Nor was my uneasiness unjustified. Little more than a week had passed when
  a fresh summons brought me to Burnaby's house, full of bewilderment and
  apprehension. And indeed there was good cause for apprehension; for when I
  arrived, to find Burnaby lying speechless and sightless his blue eyes turned
  to blank discs of black, glittering with the unnatural "belladonna
  sparkle,"&mdash;when I felt his racing pulse and watched his vain efforts to
  swallow a sip of water,&mdash;I began to ask myself whether he was not beyond
  recall. The same question was asked mutely by the terrified eyes of his wife,
  who rose like a ghost from his bedside as I entered the room. But once more
  he responded to the remedies, though more slowly this time, and at the end of
  an hour I was relieved to see that the urgent danger was past, although he
  still remained very ill.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, inquiries failed utterly to elicit any explanation of the
  attack. The symptoms had set in shortly after dinner; a simple meal,
  consisting of a pigeon cooked en casserole by Mrs. Burnaby herself,
  vegetables and a light pudding which had been shared by the rest of the
  family, and a little Chablis from a bottle that had been unsealed and opened in
  the dining-room. Nothing else had been taken and no medicaments of any kind
  used. On the other hand, any doubts as to the nature of the attack were set
  at rest by a chemical test made by me and confirmed by the Clinical Research
  Association, Atropine was demonstrably present, though the amount was
  comparatively small. But its source remained an impenetrable mystery.</p>

  <p>It was a profoundly disturbing state of affairs. The last attack had
  narrowly missed a fatal termination and the poison was still untraced. From
  the same unknown source a fresh charge might be delivered at any moment, and
  who could say what the result would be? Poor Burnaby was in a state of
  chronic terror and his wife began to look haggard and worn with constant
  anxiety and apprehension. Nor was I in much better case myself, for, whatever
  should befall, the responsibility was mine. I racked my brains for some
  possible explanation, but could think of none, though there were times when a
  horrible thought would creep into my mind, only to be indignantly cast
  out.</p>

  <p>One evening a few days after the last attack, I received a visit from
  Burnaby's brother, a pathologist attached to one of the London hospitals, but
  not in practice. Very different was Dr. Burnaby from his gentle, amiable
  brother; a strong, resolute, energetic man and none too suave in manner. We
  were already acquainted, so no introductions were necessary, and he came to
  the point with characteristic directness.</p>

  <p>"You can guess what I have come about, Jardine&mdash;this atropine
  business. What is being done in the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that anything is being done," I answered lamely. "I can make
  nothing of it."</p>

  <p>"Waiting for the next attack and the inquest, h'm? Well, that won't do,
  you know. This affair has got to be stopped before it is too late. If you
  don't know where the poison comes from, somebody does. H'm! And it is time to
  find out who that somebody is. There aren't many to choose from. I am going
  there now to have a look round and make a few inquiries. You'd better come
  with me."</p>

  <p>"Are they expecting you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered gruffly; "but I'm not a stranger and neither are
  you."</p>

  <p>I decided to go round with him, though I didn't much like his manner. This
  was evidently meant to be a surprise visit, and I had no great difficulty in
  guessing at what was in his mind. On the other hand, I was not sorry to share
  the responsibility with a man of his position and a relative of the patient.
  Accordingly, I set forth with him willingly enough; and it is significant of
  my state of mind at this time, that I took my emergency bag with me.</p>

  <p>When we arrived Burnaby and his wife were just sitting down to
  dinner&mdash;the children took their evening meal by themselves&mdash;and
  they welcomed us with the ready hospitality that made this such a pleasant
  household. Dr. Burnaby's place was laid opposite mine, and I was faintly
  amused to note his eye furtively travelling over the table, evidently
  assessing each article of food as a possible vehicle of atropine. "If you had
  only let us know you were coming, Jim," said Mrs. Burnaby when the joint made
  its appearance, "we would have had something better than saddle of mutton. As
  it is, you must take pot-luck."</p>

  <p>"Saddle of mutton is good enough for me," replied Dr. Burnaby. "But what
  on earth is that stuff that Frank has got?" he added, as Burnaby lifted the
  lid from a little casserole.</p>

  <p>"That," she answered, "is a fricassee of rabbit. Such a tiny creature it
  was; a mere infant. Cook nearly wept at having to kill it."</p>

  <p>"Kill it!" exclaimed the doctor; "do you buy your rabbits alive?"</p>

  <p>"We didn't buy this one," she replied. "It was brought by Cyril&mdash;Mr.
  Parker, you know," she added hastily and with a slight flush, as she caught a
  grim glance of interrogation. "He sends quite a lot of poultry and rabbits
  and things for Frank from his little farm."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said the doctor with a reflective eye on the casserole. "H'm! Breeds
  them himself, hey? Whereabouts is his farm?"</p>

  <p>"At Eltham. But it isn't really a farm. He just keeps rabbits and fowls
  and pigeons in a place at the back of his garden."</p>

  <p>"Is your cook English?" Dr. Burnaby asked, glancing again at the
  casserole. "That affair of Frank's has rather a French look."</p>

  <p>"Bless you, Jim," said Burnaby, "I am not dependent on mere cooks. I am a
  pampered gourmet. Margaret prepares most of my food with her own sacred
  hands. Cooks can't do this sort of thing;" and he helped himself afresh from
  the casserole.</p>

  <p>Dr. Burnaby seemed to reflect profoundly upon this explanation. Then he
  abruptly changed the subject from cookery to the Lindisfarne Gospels and
  thereby set his brother's chin wagging to a new tune. For Burnaby's
  affections as a scholar were set on seventh- and eighth-century manuscripts
  and his knowledge of them was as great as his enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, get on with your dinner, Frank, you old windbag," exclaimed Mrs.
  Burnaby. "You are letting everything get cold."</p>

  <p>"So I am, dear," he admitted, "but&mdash;I won't be a minute. I just want
  Jim to see those collotypes of the Durham Book. Excuse me."</p>

  <p>He sprang up from the table and darted into the adjoining library, whence
  he returned almost immediately carrying a small portfolio.</p>

  <p>"These are the plates," he said, handing the portfolio to his brother.
  "Have a look at them while I dispose of the arrears."</p>

  <p>He took up his knife and fork and made as if to resume his meal. Then he
  laid them down and leaned back in his chair. "I don't think I want any more,
  after all," he said.</p>

  <p>The tone in which he spoke caused me to look at him critically; for my
  talk with his brother had made me a little nervous and apprehensive of
  further trouble. What I now saw was by no means reassuring. A slight flush
  and a trace of anxiety in his expression made me ask, with outward composure
  but inward alarm: "You are feeling quite fit, I hope, Burnaby?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not so very," he replied. "My eyes are going a bit misty and my
  throat&mdash;" Here he worked his lips and swallowed as if with some
  effort.</p>

  <p>I rose hastily, and, catching a terrified glance from his wife, went to
  him and looked into his eyes. And thereupon my heart sank. For already his
  pupils were twice their natural size and the darkened eyes exhibited the
  too-familiar sparkle. I was sensible of a thrill of terror, and, as I looked
  into Burnaby's now distinctly alarmed face, his brother's ominous words
  echoed in my ears. Had I waited "for the next attack and the inquest"?</p>

  <p>The symptoms, once started, developed apace. From moment to moment he grew
  worse, and the rapid enlargement of the pupils gave an alarming hint as to
  the intensity of the poisoning. I darted out into the hall for my bag, and as
  I re-entered, I saw him rise, groping blindly with his hands, until his wife,
  ashen-faced and trembling, took his arm and led him to the door.</p>

  <p>"I had better give him a dose of pilocarpine at once," I said, getting out
  my hypodermic syringe and glancing at Dr. Burnaby, who watched me with stony
  composure.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "and a little morphine, too! and he will probably need
  some stimulant. I won't come up; only be in the way."</p>

  <p>I followed the patient up to the bedroom and administered the antidotes
  forthwith. Then, while he was getting partially undressed with his wife's
  help, I went downstairs in search of brandy and hot water, I was about to
  enter the dining-room when, through the partly-open door, I saw Dr. Burnaby
  standing by the fireplace with his open hand-bag&mdash;which he had fetched
  in from the hall&mdash;on the table before him, and in his hand a little
  Bohemian glass jar from the mantelpiece. Involuntarily, I halted for a
  moment; and as I did so, he carefully deposited the little ornament in the
  bag and closed the latter, locking it with a small key which he then put in
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>It was an excessively odd proceeding, but, of course, it was no concern of
  mine. Nevertheless, instead of entering the dining-room, I stole softly
  towards the kitchen and fetched the hot water myself. When I returned, the
  bag was back on the hall table and I found Dr. Burnaby grimly pacing up and
  down the dining room. He asked me a few questions while I was looking for the
  brandy, and then, somewhat to my surprise, proposed to come up and lend a
  hand with the patient.</p>

  <p>On entering the bedroom, we found poor Burnaby lying half-undressed on the
  bed and in a very pitiable state; terrified, physically distressed and
  inclined to ramble mentally. His wife knelt by the bed, white-faced, red-eyed
  and evidently panic-stricken, though she was quite quiet and self-restrained.
  As we entered, she rose to make way for us, and while we were examining the
  patient's pulse and listening to his racing heart, she silently busied
  herself with the preparations for administering the stimulants.</p>

  <p>"You don't think he is going to die, do you?" she whispered, as Dr.
  Burnaby handed me back my stethoscope.</p>

  <p>"It is no use thinking," he replied dryly&mdash;and I thought rather
  callously&mdash;"we shall see;" and with this he turned his back to her and
  looked at his brother with a gloomy frown.</p>

  <p>For more than an hour that question was an open one. From moment to moment
  I expected to feel the wildly-racing pulse flicker out; to hear the troubled
  breathing die away in an expiring rattle. From time to time we cautiously
  increased the antidotes and administered restoratives, but I must confess
  that I had little hope. Dr. Burnaby was undisguisedly pessimistic. And as the
  weary minutes dragged on, and I looked momentarily for the arrival of the
  dread messenger, there would keep stealing into my mind a question that I
  hardly dared to entertain. What was the meaning of it all? Whence had the
  poison come? And why, in this household, had it found its way to Burnaby
  alone&mdash;the one inmate to whom it was specially deadly?</p>

  <p>At last&mdash;at long last&mdash;there came a change; hardly perceptible
  at first, and viewed with little confidence. But after a time it became more
  pronounced; and then, quite rapidly, the symptoms began to clear up. The
  patient swallowed with ease, and great relish, a cup of coffee; the heart
  slowed down, the breathing became natural, and presently, as the morphine
  began to take effect, he sank into a doze which passed by degrees into a
  quiet sleep.</p>

  <p>"I think he will do now," said Dr. Burnaby, "so I won't stay any longer.
  But it was a near thing, Jardine; most uncomfortably near."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door, where, as he went out, he turned and bowed stiffly
  to his sister-in-law. I followed him down the stairs, rather expecting him to
  revert to the subject of his visit to me. But he made no reference to it,
  nor, indeed, did he say anything until he stood on the doorstep with his bag
  in his hand. Then he made a somewhat cryptic remark: "Well, Jardine," he
  said, "the Durham Book saved him. But for those collotypes, he would be a
  dead man;" and with that he walked away, leaving me to interpret as best I
  could this decidedly obscure remark.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later, as Burnaby was peacefully asleep and
  apparently out of all danger, I took my own departure, and as soon as I was
  outside the house, I proceeded to put into execution a plan that had been
  forming in my mind during the last hour. There was some mystery in this case
  that was evidently beyond my powers to solve. But solved it had to be, if
  Burnaby's life was to be saved, to say nothing of my own reputation; so I had
  decided to put the facts before my friend and former teacher, Dr. Thorndyke,
  and seek his advice, and if necessary, his assistance.</p>

  <p>It was now past ten o'clock, but I determined to take my chance of finding
  him at his chambers, and accordingly, having found a taxi, I directed the
  driver to set me down at the gate of Inner Temple Lane. My former experience
  of Thorndyke's habits led me to be hopeful, and my hopes were not unjustified
  on this occasion, for when I had mounted to the first pair landing of No. 5A
  King's Bench Walk, and assaulted the knocker of the inner door, I was
  relieved to find him not only at home, but alone and disengaged. "It's a
  deuce of a time to come knocking you up," I said, as he shook my hand, "but I
  am in rather a hole, and the matter is urgent, so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you paid me the compliment of treating me as a friend," said he. "Very
  proper of you. What is the nature of your difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I've got a case of recurrent atropine poisoning and I can make
  absolutely nothing of it."</p>

  <p>Here I began to give a brief outline sketch of the facts, but after a
  minute or two he stopped me.</p>

  <p>"It is of no use being sketchy, Jardine," said he. "The night is young.
  Let us have a complete history of the case, with particulars of all the
  persons concerned and their mutual relations. And don't spare detail."</p>

  <p>He seated himself with a notebook on his knee, and when he had lighted his
  pipe, I plunged into the narrative of the case, beginning with the eye-drop
  incident and finishing with the alarming events of the present evening.</p>

  <p>He listened with close attention, refraining from interrupting me
  excepting occasionally to ask for a date, which he jotted down with a few
  other notes. When I had finished, he laid aside his notebook, and, as he
  knocked out his pipe, observed: "A very remarkable case, Jardine, and
  interesting by reason of the unusual nature of the poison."</p>

  <p>"Oh, hang the interest!" I exclaimed. "I am not a toxicologist. I am a
  general practitioner; and I want to know what the deuce I ought to do."</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "that your duty is perfectly obvious. You ought to
  communicate with the police, either alone or in conjunction with some member
  of the family."</p>

  <p>I looked at him in dismay. "But," I faltered, "what have I got to tell the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"What you have told me," he replied; "which, put in a nutshell, amounts to
  this: Frank Burnaby has had three attacks of atropine poisoning, disregarding
  the eye-drops. Each attack has appeared to be associated with some article of
  food prepared by Mrs. Burnaby and supplied by Mr. Cyril Parker."</p>

  <p>"But, good God!" I exclaimed, "you don't suspect Mrs. Burnaby?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect nobody," he replied. "It may not be criminal poisoning at all.
  But Mr. Burnaby has to be protected, and the case certainly needs
  investigation."</p>

  <p>"You don't think I could make a few inquiries myself first?" I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "The risk is too great," he replied. "The man might die
  before you reached a conclusion; whereas a few inquiries made by the police
  would probably put a stop to the affair, unless the poisoning is in some
  inconceivable way inadvertent."</p>

  <p>That was what his advice amounted to, and I felt that he was right. But it
  put on me a horribly unpleasant duty; and as I wended homewards I tried to
  devise some means of mitigating its unpleasantness. Finally I decided to try
  to persuade Mrs. Burnaby to make a joint communication with me.</p>

  <p>But the necessity never arose. When I made my morning visit, I found a
  taxicab drawn up opposite the door and the housemaid who admitted me looked
  as if she had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Why, what is the matter, Mabel?" I asked, as she ushered me funereally
  into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I don't know, sir. Something awful, I'm afraid. I'll
  tell them you are here." With this she shut the door and departed.</p>

  <p>The housemaid's manner and the unusually formal reception filled me with
  vague forebodings. But even as I was wondering what could have happened, the
  question was answered by the entry of a tall man who looked like a guardsman
  in mufti.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Jardine?" he asked; and as I nodded, he explained, presenting his
  card, "I am Detective Lane. I have been instructed to make some inquiries in
  respect of certain information which we have received. It is stated that Mr.
  Frank Burnaby is suffering from the effects of poison. So far as you know, is
  that true?"</p>

  <p>"I hope he is recovered now," I replied, "but he was suffering last night
  from what appeared to be atropine poisoning."</p>

  <p>"Have there been any previous attacks of the same kind?" the sergeant
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "This was the fifth attack; but the first two were
  evidently due to some eye-drops that he had used."</p>

  <p>"And in the case of the other three; have you any idea as to how the
  poison came to be taken? Whether it was in the food, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea, sergeant. I know nothing more than what I have told you;
  and, of course, I am not going to make any guesses. Is it admissible to ask
  who gave the information?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not, sir," he replied. "But you will soon know. There is a
  definite charge against Mrs. Burnaby&mdash;I have just made the
  arrest&mdash;and we shall want your evidence for the prosecution."</p>

  <p>I stared at him in utter consternation. "Do you mean," I gasped, "that you
  have arrested Mrs. Burnaby?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied; "on a charge of having administered poison to her
  husband."</p>

  <p>I was absolutely thunderstruck. And yet, when I remembered Thorndyke's
  words and recalled my own dim and hastily-dismissed surmises, there was
  nothing so very surprising in this shocking turn of events.</p>

  <p>"Could I have a few words with Mrs. Burnaby?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not alone," he replied, "and better not at all. Still, if you have any
  business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have," said I; whereupon he led the way to the dining-room, where I
  found Mrs. Burnaby seated rigidly in a chair, pale as death, but quite calm
  though rather dazed. Opposite her a military-looking man sat stiffly by the
  table with an air of being unconscious of her presence, and he took no notice
  as I walked over to his prisoner and silently pressed her hand.</p>

  <p>"I've come, Mrs. Burnaby," said I, "to ask if there is anything that you
  want me to do. Does Burnaby know about this horrible affair?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "You will have to tell him if he is fit to hear it;
  and if not, I want you to let my father know as soon as you can. That is all;
  and you had better go now, as we mustn't detain these gentlemen.
  Good-bye."</p>

  <p>She shook my hand unemotionally, and when I had faltered a few words of
  vague encouragement and sympathy, I went out of the room, but waited in the
  hall to see the last of her.</p>

  <p>The police officers were most polite and considerate. When she came out,
  they attended her in quite a deferential manner. As the sergeant was in the
  act of opening the street door, the bell rang; and when the door opened it
  disclosed Mr. Parker standing on threshold. He was about to address Mrs.
  Burnaby but she passed him with a slight bow, and descended the steps,
  preceded by the sergeant and followed by the detective. The former held the
  door of the cab open while she entered, when he entered also and shut the
  door. The detective took his seat beside the driver and the cab moved
  off.</p>

  <p>"What is in the wind, Jardine?" Parker asked looking at me with a
  distinctly alarmed expression. "Those fellows look like plain-clothes
  policemen."</p>

  <p>"They are," said I. "They have just arrest Mrs. Burnaby on a charge of
  having attempted to poison her husband."</p>

  <p>I thought Parker would have fallen. As it was, he staggered to a hall
  chair and dropped on it in a state of collapse. "Good God!" he gasped. "What
  a frightful thing! But there can't possibly be any evidence&mdash;any real
  grounds for suspecting her. It must be just a wild guess. I wonder who
  started it."</p>

  <p>On this subject I had pretty strong suspicions, but I did not mention
  them; and when I had seen Parker into the dining-room and explained matters a
  little further I went upstairs, bracing myself for my very disagreeable
  task.</p>

  <p>Burnaby was quite recovered, though rather torpid from the effects of the
  morphine. But my news roused him most effectually. In a moment he was out of
  bed, hurriedly preparing to dress; and though his pale, set face told how
  deeply the catastrophe had shocked him, he was quite collected and had all
  his wits about him.</p>

  <p>"It's of no use letting our emotions loose, doctor," said he, in reply to
  my expressions of sympathy. "Margaret is in a very dangerous position. You
  have only to consider what she is&mdash;a young, beautiful woman&mdash;and
  what I am, to realise that. We must act promptly. I shall go and see her
  father; he is a very capable lawyer; and we must get a first-class
  counsel."</p>

  <p>This seemed to be an opportunity for mentioning Thorndyke's peculiar
  qualifications in a case of this kind, and I did so. Burnaby listened
  attentively, apparently not unimpressed; but he replied cautiously: "We shall
  have to leave the choice of the counsel to Harratt; but if you care,
  meanwhile, to consult with Dr. Thorndyke, you have my authority. I will tell
  Harratt."</p>

  <p>On this I took my departure, not a little relieved at the way he had taken
  the evil tidings; and as soon as I had disposed of the more urgent part of my
  work, I betook myself to Thorndyke's chambers, just in time to catch him on
  his return from the Courts.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jardine," he said, when I had brought the history up to date, "what
  is it that you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to do what you can to establish Mrs. Burnaby's innocence," I
  replied.</p>

  <p>He looked at me reflectively for a few moments; then he said, quietly but
  rather significantly: "It is not my practice to give ex parte evidence. An
  expert witness cannot act as an advocate. If I investigate the evidence in
  this case, it will have to be at your risk, as representing the accused,
  since any fact, no matter how damaging, which is in the possession of the
  witness must be disclosed in accordance with the terms of the oath, to say
  nothing of the obvious duty of every person to further the ends of justice.
  Speaking as a lawyer, and taking the known facts at their face value, I do
  not advise you to employ me to investigate the case at large. You might find
  that you had merely strengthened the hand of the prosecution.</p>

  <p>"But I will make a suggestion. There seems to me to be in this case a very
  curious and interesting possibility. Let me investigate that independently.
  If my inquiries yield a positive result, I will let you know and you can call
  me as a witness. If they yield a negative result, you had better leave me out
  of the case."</p>

  <p>To this suggestion I necessarily agreed; but when I took my leave of
  Thorndyke I went away with a sense of discouragement and failure. His
  reference to "the face value of the known facts" clearly implied that those
  facts were adverse to the accused; while the "curious possibility" suggested
  nothing but a forlorn hope from which he had no great expectations.</p>

  <p>I need not follow the weary business in detail. At the first hearing
  before the magistrate the police merely stated the charge and gave evidence
  of arrest, both they and the defence asking for a remand and neither
  apparently desiring to show their hand. Accordingly the case was adjourned
  for seven days, and as bail was refused, the prisoner was detained in
  custody.</p>

  <p>During those seven dreary days I spent as much time as I could with
  Burnaby, and though I was filled with admiration of his fortitude and self
  his drawn and pallid face wrung my heart. In those few days he seemed to have
  changed into an old man. At his house I also met Mr. Harratt, Mrs. Burnaby's
  father, a fine, dignified man and a typical old lawyer; and it was
  unspeakably pathetic to see the father and the husband of the accused woman
  each trying to support the courage of the other while both were torn with
  anxiety and apprehension. On one occasion Mr. Parker was present and looked
  more haggard and depressed than either. But Mr. Harratt's manner towards him
  was so frigid and forbidding that he did not repeat his visit. At these
  meetings we discussed the case freely, which was a further affliction to me.
  For even I could not fail to see that any evidence that I could give directly
  supported the case for the prosecution.</p>

  <p>So six of the seven days ran out, and all the time there was no word from
  Thorndyke. But on the evening of the sixth day I received a letter from him,
  curt and dry, but still giving out a ray of hope. This was the brief
  message:</p>

  <p>"I have gone into the question of which I spoke to you and consider that
  the point is worth raising. I have accordingly written to Mr. Harratt
  advising him to that effect."</p>

  <p>It was a somewhat colourless communication. But I knew Thorndyke well
  enough to realise that his promises usually understated his intentions. And
  when, on the following morning, I met Mr. Harratt and Burnaby at the court,
  something in their manner&mdash;a new vivacity and expectancy&mdash;suggested
  that Thorndyke had been more explicit in his communication to the lawyer.
  But, all the same, their anxiety, for all their outward courage, was enough
  to have touched a heart of stone.</p>

  <p>The spectacle that that court presented when the case was called forms a
  tableau that is painted on my memory in indelible colours. The mingling of
  squalor and tragedy, of frivolity and dread solemnity&mdash;the grave
  magistrate on the bench, the stolid policemen, the busy, preoccupied lawyers,
  and the gibbering crowd of spectators, greedy for sensation, with eager eyes
  riveted on the figure in the dock&mdash;offered such a medley of contrasts as
  I hope never to look upon again.</p>

  <p>As to the prisoner herself, her appearance brought my heart into my mouth.
  Rigid as a marble statue and nearly as void of colour, she stood in the dock,
  guarded by two constables, looking with stony bewilderment on the motley
  scene, outwardly calm, but with the calm of one who looks death in the face;
  and when the prosecuting counsel rose to open the case for the police, she
  looked at him as a victim on the scaffold might look upon the
  executioner.</p>

  <p>As I listened to the brief opening address, my heart sank, though the
  counsel, Sir Harold Layton, K.C., presented his case with that scrupulous
  fairness to the accused that makes an English court of justice a thing
  without parallel in the world. But the mere facts, baldly stated without
  comment, were appalling. No persuasive rhetoric was needed to show that they
  led direct to the damning conclusion.</p>

  <p>Frank Burnaby, an elderly man, married to a young and beautiful woman, had
  on three separate occasions had administered to him a certain deadly poison,
  to wit, atropine. It would be proved that he had suffered from the effects of
  that poison; that the symptoms followed the taking of certain articles of
  food of which he alone had partaken; that the said food did actually contain
  the said poison; and that the food which contained the poison was specially
  prepared for his sole consumption by his wife, the accused, with her own
  hands. No evidence was at present available as to how the accused obtained
  the poison or that she had any such poison in her possession, nor would any
  suggestion be offered as to the motive of the crime. But, on the evidence of
  the actual administration of the poison, he would ask that the prisoner be
  committed for trial. He then proceeded to call the witnesses, of whom I was
  naturally the first. When I had been sworn and given my description, the
  counsel asked a few questions which elicited the history of the case and
  which I need not repeat. He then continued:</p>

  <p>"Have you any doubt as to the cause of Mr. Burnaby's symptoms?"</p>

  <p>"No. They were certainly due to atropine poisoning."</p>

  <p>"Has Mr. Burnaby any constitutional peculiarity in respect of
  atropine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is abnormally susceptible to the effects of atropine."</p>

  <p>"Was this peculiar susceptibility known to the accused?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was communicated to her by me."</p>

  <p>"Was it known, so far as you are aware, to any other persons?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Parker was present when I told her, and Mr. Burnaby and his brother,
  Dr. Burnaby, were also informed."</p>

  <p>"Is there any way, so far as you know, in which the accused could have
  obtained possession of atropine?"</p>

  <p>"Only by having the oculist's prescription for the eye-drops made up."</p>

  <p>"Do you know of any medium, other than the food, by which atropine might
  have been taken by Mr. Burnaby?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," I replied; and this concluded my evidence. But as I stepped
  out of the witness-box, I reflected gloomily that every word that I had
  spoken was a rivet in the fetters of the silent figure in the dock.</p>

  <p>The next witness was the cook. She testified that she had killed and
  skinned the rabbit and had then handed it to the accused, who made it into a
  fricassee and prepared it for the table. Witness took no part in the
  preparation and she was absent from the kitchen on one occasion for several
  minutes, leaving the accused there alone.</p>

  <p>When the cook had concluded her evidence, the name of James Burnaby was
  called, and the doctor entered the witness-box, looking distinctly
  uncomfortable, but grim and resolute. The first few questions elicited the
  circumstances of his visit to his brother's house and of the sudden attack of
  illness. That illness he had at once recognised as acute atropine poisoning,
  and had assumed that the poison was in the specially prepared food.</p>

  <p>"Did you take any measures to verify this opinion?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. As soon as I was alone, I took part of the remainder of the rabbit
  and put it in a glass jar which I found on the mantelpiece and which I first
  rinsed out with water. Later, I carried the sample of food to Professor
  Berry, who analysed it in my presence and found it to contain atropine. He
  obtained from it a thirtieth of a grain of atropine sulphate."</p>

  <p>"Is that a poisonous dose?"</p>

  <p>"Not to an ordinary person, though it is considerably beyond the medicinal
  dose. But it would have been a poisonous dose to Frank Burnaby. If he had
  swallowed this, in addition to what he had already taken, I feel no doubt
  that it would have killed him."</p>

  <p>This concluded the case for the prosecution, and a black case it
  undoubtedly looked. There was no cross-examination; and as Thorndyke had
  arrived some time previously and conferred with Mr. Harratt and his counsel,
  I concluded that the defence would take the form of a counter-attack by the
  raising of a fresh issue. And so it turned out. When Thorndyke entered the
  witness-box and had disposed of the preliminaries, the counsel for the
  defence "gave him his head."</p>

  <p>"You have made certain investigations in regard to this case, I believe?"
  Thorndyke assented, and the counsel continued: "I will not ask you specific
  questions, but will request you to describe your investigations and their
  result, and tell us what caused you to make them."</p>

  <p>"This case," Thorndyke began, "was brought to my notice by Dr. Jardine,
  who gave me all the facts known to him. These facts were very remarkable,
  and, taken together, they suggested a possible explanation of the poisoning.
  There were four striking points in the case. First, there was the very
  unusual nature of the poison. Second, the abnormal susceptibility of Mr.
  Burnaby to this particular poison. Third, the fact that all the food in which
  the poison appeared to have been conveyed came from the same source: it was
  sent by Mr. Cyril Parker. Fourth, that food consisted of pigeon's eggs,
  pigeon's flesh, and rabbit's flesh."</p>

  <p>"What is there remarkable about that?" the counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"The remarkable point is that the pigeon and the rabbit have an
  extraordinary immunity to atropine. Most vegetable-feeding birds and animals
  are more or less immune to vegetable poisons. Many birds and animals are
  largely immune to atropine; but among birds the pigeon is exceptionally
  immune, while the rabbit is the most extreme instance among animals. A single
  rabbit can take without the slightest harm more than a hundred times the
  quantity of atropine that would kill a man; and rabbits habitually feed
  freely on the leaves and berries of the belladonna or deadly nightshade."</p>

  <p>"Does the deadly nightshade contain atropine?" the counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Atropine is the active principle of the belladonna plant and gives
  to it its poisonous properties."</p>

  <p>"And if an animal, such as a rabbit, were to feed on the nightshade plant,
  would its flesh be poisonous?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Cases of belladonna poisoning from eating rabbit have been
  recorded&mdash;by Firth and Bentley, for instance."</p>

  <p>"And you suspected that the poison in this case had been contained in the
  pigeon and the rabbit themselves?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was a striking coincidence that the poisoning should follow the
  consumption of these two specially immune animals. But there was a further
  reason for connecting them. The symptoms were strictly proportionate to the
  probable amount of poison in each case. Thus the symptoms were only slight
  after eating the pigeon's eggs. But the eggs of a poisoned pigeon could
  contain only a minute quantity of the poison. After eating the pigeon the
  symptoms were much more severe, and the body of a pigeon which had fed on
  belladonna would contain much more atropine than could be contained in an
  egg. Finally, after eating the rabbit, the symptoms were extremely violent;
  but a rabbit has the greatest immunity and is the most likely to have eaten
  large quantities of belladonna leaves."</p>

  <p>"Did you take any measures to put your theory to the test?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Last Monday I went to Eltham, where I had ascertained that Mr. Cyril
  Parker lives, and inspected his premises from the outside. At the end of his
  garden is a small paddock enclosed by a wall. Approaching this across a
  meadow and looking over the wall, I saw that the enclosure was provided with
  small fowl-houses, pigeon-cotes, and rabbit hutches. All these were open and
  their inmates were roaming about the paddock. On one side of the enclosure,
  by the wall was a dense mass of deadly nightshade plants, extending the whole
  length of the wall and about a couple of yards in width. At one part of this
  was a ring fence of wire netting, and inside it were five half-grown rabbits.
  There was a basket containing a small quantity of cabbage leaves and other
  green stuff, but as I watched, I saw the young rabbits browsing freely on the
  nightshade plants in preference to the food provided for them.</p>

  <p>"On the following day I went to Eltham again taking with me an assistant
  who carried a young rabbit in a small hamper. We watched the paddock until
  the coast was clear. Then my assistant got over the wall and abstracted a
  young rabbit from inside the ring fence and handed it to me. He then took the
  rabbit from the hamper and dropped it inside the fence. As soon as we were
  clear of the meadow, we killed the captured rabbit&mdash;to prevent any
  possible elimination of any poison that it might have swallowed. On arriving
  in London, I at once took the dead rabbit to St. Margaret's Hospital, where,
  in the chemical laboratory, and in the presence of Dr. Woodford, the
  Professor of Chemistry, I skinned it and prepared it as if for cooking by
  removing the viscera. I then separated the flesh from the bones and handed
  the former to Dr. Woodford, who, in my presence, carried out an exhaustive
  chemical test for atropine. The result was that atropine was found to be
  present in all the muscles; and, on making a quantitative test, the muscles
  alone yielded no less than .93 grain."</p>

  <p>"Is that a poisonous dose?" the counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is a poisonous dose for a normal man. In the case of an
  abnormally susceptible person like Mr. Burnaby it would certainly be a fatal
  dose."</p>

  <p>This completed Thorndyke's evidence. There was no cross and the magistrate
  put no questions. When Dr. Woodford had been called and had given
  confirmatory evidence, Mrs. Burnaby's counsel proceeded to address the bench.
  But the magistrate cut him short.</p>

  <p>"There is really no case to argue," said he. "The evidence of the expert
  witnesses makes it perfectly clear that the poison was already in the food
  when it came into the hands of the accused. Consequently the charge against
  her of introducing the poison falls to the ground and the case must be
  dismissed. I am sure everyone will sympathise with the unfortunate lady who
  has been the victim of these extraordinary circumstances, and will rejoice,
  as I do, at the clearing up of the mystery. The prisoner is discharged."</p>

  <p>It was a dramatic moment when, amidst the applause of the spectators, Mrs.
  Burnaby stepped down from the dock and clasped her husband's outstretched
  hand But, overwhelmed as they both were by the sudden relief, I thought it
  best not to linger, but, after congratulations, to take myself off with
  Thorndyke. But one pleasant incident I witnessed before I went Dr. Burnaby
  had been standing apart, evidently some what embarrassed, when suddenly Mrs.
  Burnaby ran to him and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Margaret," he said gruffly, "you think I'm an old beast?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I don't," she replied. "You acted quite properly, and I respect
  you for having the moral courage to do it. And don't forget, Jim, that you
  action has saved Frank's life. But for you, there would have been no Dr.
  Thorndyke; and but for Dr. Thorndyke, there would have been another poisoned
  rabbit."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of this case?" I asked, as Thorndyke and I walked away
  from the court. "Do you suppose the poisoning was accidental?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No, Jardine," he replied. "There are too many
  coincidences. You notice that the poisoned animals did not appear until after
  Mr Parker had learned from you that Burnaby was abnormally sensitive to
  atropine and could consequently be poisoned by an ordinary medicinal dose.
  Then the sending of the animals alive looks like a precaution divert
  suspicion from himself and confuse the issue. Again, that ring fence among
  the belladonna plans has a fishy look, and the plants themselves were not
  only abnormally numerous but many of them very young and looked as if they
  had been planted. Further, I happen to know that Parker's firm published,
  only last year, a book on toxicology in which the immunity of pigeons and
  rabbits was mentioned and which Parker probably read."</p>

  <p>"Then do you believe that he intended to let Mrs. Burnaby&mdash;the woman
  with whom he was in love&mdash;bear the brunt of his crime? It seems
  incredibly villainous and cowardly."</p>

  <p>"I do not," he replied. "I imagine that the rabbit that I captured, or one
  of the others, would have been sent to Burnaby in a few days' time. The cook
  would probably have prepared it for him and it would almost certainly have
  killed him; and his death would have been proof of Mrs. Burnaby's innocence.
  Suspicion would have been transferred to the cook. But I don't suppose any
  action will be taken against him, for it is practically certain that no jury
  would convict him on my evidence."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke was right in his opinion. No proceedings were taken against
  Parker. But the house of the Burnabys knew him no more.</p>

  <h2><a name="c7"
     id="c7"></a>VII. &mdash; A MYSTERY OF THE SAND-HILLS</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE occasionally wondered how often Mystery and Romance
  present themselves to us ordinary men of affairs only to be passed by without
  recognition. More often, I suspect than most of us imagine. The uncanny
  tendency of my talented friend John Thorndyke to become involved in strange,
  mysterious and abnormal circumstances has almost become a joke against him.
  But yet, on reflection, I am disposed to think that his experiences have not
  differed essentially from those of other men, but that his extraordinary
  powers of observation and rapid inference have enabled him to detect abnormal
  elements in what, to ordinary men, appeared to be quite commonplace
  occurrences. Certainly this was so in the singular Roscoff case, in which, if
  I had been alone, I should assuredly have seen nothing to merit more than a
  passing attention.</p>

  <p>It happened that on a certain summer morning&mdash;it was the fourteenth
  of August, to be exact&mdash;we were discussing this very subject as we
  walked across the golf-links from Sandwich towards the sea. I was spending a
  holiday in the old town with my wife, in order that she might paint the
  ancient streets, and we had induced Thorndyke to come down and stay with us
  for a few days. This was his last morning, and we had come forth betimes to
  stroll across the sand-hills to Shellness.</p>

  <p>It was a solitary place in those days. When we came off the sand-hills on
  to the smooth, sandy beach, there was not a soul in sight, and our own
  footprints were the first to mark the firm strip of sand between high-water
  mark and the edge of the quiet surf.</p>

  <p>We had walked a hundred yards or so when Thorndyke stopped and looked down
  at the dry sand above tide-marks and then along the wet beach.</p>

  <p>"Would that be a shrimper?" he cogitated, referring to some impressions of
  bare feet in the sand. "If so, he couldn't have come from Pegwell, for the
  River Stour bars the way. But he came out of the sea and seems to have made
  straight for the sand-hills."</p>

  <p>"Then he probably was a shrimper," said I, not deeply interested.</p>

  <p>"Yet," said Thorndyke, "it was an odd time for a shrimper to be at
  work."</p>

  <p>"What was an odd time?" I demanded. "When was he at work?"</p>

  <p>"He came out of the sea at this place," Thorndyke replied, glancing at his
  watch, "at about half-past eleven last night, or from that to twelve."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Thorndyke!" I exclaimed, "how on earth do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"But it is obvious, Anstey," he replied. "It is now half-past nine, and it
  will be high-water at eleven, as we ascertained before we came out. Now, if
  you look at those footprints on the sand, you see that they stop
  short&mdash;or rather begin&mdash;about two-thirds of the distance from
  high-water mark to the edge of the surf. Since they are visible and distinct,
  they must have been made after last high-water. But since they do not extend
  to the water's edge, they must have been made when the tide was going out;
  and the place where they begin is the place where the edge of the surf was
  when the footprints were made. But the place is, as we see, about an hour
  below the high-water mark, Therefore, when the man came out of the sea, the
  tide had been going down for an hour, roughly. As it is high-water at eleven
  this morning, it was high-water at about ten-forty last night; and as the man
  came out of the sea about an hour after high-water, he must have come out at,
  or about, eleven-forty. Isn't that obvious?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," I replied, laughing. "It is as simple as sucking eggs when
  you think it out. But how the deuce do you manage always to spot these
  obvious things at a glance? Most men would have just glanced at those
  footprints and passed them without a second thought."</p>

  <p>"That", he replied, "is a mere matter of habit; the habit of trying to
  extract the significance of simple appearances. It has become almost
  automatic with me."</p>

  <p>During our discussion we had been walking forward slowly, straying on to
  the edge of the sand-hills. Suddenly, in a hollow between the hills, my eye
  lighted upon a heap of clothes, apparently, to judge by their orderly
  disposal, those of a bather. Thorndyke also had observed them and we
  approached together and looked down on them curiously.</p>

  <p>"Here is another problem for you," said I. "Find the bather. I don't see
  him anywhere."</p>

  <p>"You won't find him here," said Thorndyke. "These clothes have been out
  all night. Do you see the little spider's web on the boots with a few
  dewdrops still clinging to it? There has been no dew forming for a good many
  hours. Let us have a look at the beach."</p>

  <p>We strode out through the loose sand and stiff, reedy grass to the smooth
  beach, and here we could plainly see a line of prints of naked feet leading
  straight down to the sea, but ending abruptly about two-thirds of the way to
  the water's edge.</p>

  <p>"This looks like our nocturnal shrimper," said I. "He seems to have gone
  into the sea here and come out at the other place. But if they are the same
  footprints, he must have forgotten to dress before he went home. It is a
  quaint affair."</p>

  <p>"It is a most remarkable affair," Thorndyke agreed; "and if the footprints
  are not the same it will be still more inexplicable."</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket a small spring tape-measure with which he
  carefully took the lengths of two of the most distinct footprints and the
  length of the stride. Then we walked back along the beach to the other set of
  tracks, two of which he measured in the same manner.</p>

  <p>"Apparently they are the same," he said, putting away his tape; "indeed,
  they could hardly be otherwise. But the mystery is, what has become of the
  man? He couldn't have gone away without his clothes, unless he is a lunatic,
  which his proceedings rather suggest. There is just the possibility that he
  went into the sea again and was drowned. Shall we walk along towards
  Shellness and see if we can find any further traces?"</p>

  <p>We walked nearly half a mile along the beach, but the smooth surface of
  the sand was everywhere unbroken. At length we turned to retrace our steps;
  and at this moment I observed two men advancing across the sand-hills. By the
  time we had reached the mysterious heap of garments they were quite near,
  and, attracted no doubt by the intentness with which we were regarding the
  clothes, they altered their course to see what we were looking at. As they
  approached, I recognized one of them as a barrister named Hallet, a neighbour
  of mine in the Temple, whom I had already met in the town, and we exchanged
  greetings.</p>

  <p>"What is the excitement?" he asked, looking at the heap of clothes and
  then glancing along the deserted beach; "and where is the owner of the togs?
  I don't see him anywhere."</p>

  <p>"That is the problem," said I. "He seems to have disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Gad!" exclaimed Hallett, "if he has gone home without his clothes, He'll
  create a sensation in the town! What?"</p>

  <p>Here the other man, who carried a set of golf clubs, stooped over the
  clothes with a look of keen interest.</p>

  <p>"I believe I recognize these things, Hallett; in fact, I am sure I do.
  That waistcoat, for instance. You must have noticed that waistcoat. I saw you
  playing with the chap a couple of days ago. Tall, clean-shaven, dark fellow.
  Temporary member, you know. What was his name? Popoff, or something like
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Roscoff," said Hallett. "Yes, by Jove, I believe you are right. And now I
  come to think of it, he mentioned to me that he sometimes came up here for a
  swim. He said he particularly liked a paddle by moonlight, and I told him he
  was a fool to run the risk of bathing in a lonely place like this, especially
  at night."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is what he seems to have done," said Thorndyke, "for these
  clothes have certainly been here all night, as you can see by that spider's
  web."</p>

  <p>"Then he has come to grief, poor beggar!" said Hallett; "probably got
  carried away by the current. There is a devil of a tide here on the
  flood."</p>

  <p>He started to walk towards the beach, and the other man, dropping his
  clubs, followed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Hallett, "that is what has happened. You can see his
  footprints plainly enough going down to the sea; but there are no tracks
  coming back."</p>

  <p>"There are some tracks of bare feet coming out of the sea farther up the
  beach," said I, "which seem to be his."</p>

  <p>Hallett shook his head. "They can't be his," he said, "for it is obvious
  that he never did come back. Probably they are the tracks of some shrimper.
  The question is, what are we to do! Better take his things to the dormy-house
  and then let the police know what has happened."</p>

  <p>We went back and began to gather up the clothes, each of us taking one or
  two articles.</p>

  <p>"You were right, Morris," said Hallett, as he picked up the shirt. "Here's
  his name, "P. Roscoff", and I see it is on the vest and the shorts, too. And
  I recognize the stick now not that that matters, as the clothes are
  marked."</p>

  <p>On our way across the links to the dormy-house mutual introductions took
  place. Morris was a London solicitor, and both he and Hallett knew Thorndyke
  by name.</p>

  <p>"The coroner will have an expert witness," Hallett remarked as we entered
  the house. "Rather a waste in a simple case like this. We had better put the
  things in here."</p>

  <p>He opened the door of a small room furnished with a good-sized table and a
  set of lockers, into one of which he inserted a key.</p>

  <p>"Before we lock them up," said Thorndyke, "I suggest that we make and sign
  a list of them and of the contents of the pockets to put with them."</p>

  <p>"Very well," agreed Hallett. "You know the ropes in these cases. I'll
  write down the descriptions, if you will call them out."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked over the collection and first enumerated the articles: a
  tweed jacket and trousers, light, knitted wool waistcoat, black and yellow
  stripes, blue cotton shirt, net vest and shorts, marked in ink "P. Roscoff",
  brown merino socks, brown shoes, tweed cap, and a walking-stick&mdash;a
  mottled Malacca cane with a horn crooked handle. When Hallett had written
  down this list, Thorndyke laid the clothes on the table and began to empty
  the pockets, one at a time, dictating the descriptions of the articles to
  Hallett while Morris took them from him and laid them on a sheet of
  newspaper. In the jacket pockets were a handkerchief, marked "P.R.;" a
  letter-case containing a few stamps, one or two hotel bills and local
  tradesmen's receipts, and some visiting cards inscribed "Mr. Peter Roscoff,
  Bell Hotel, Sandwich;" a leather cigarette-case, a 3B pencil fitted with a
  point-protector, and a fragment of what Thorndyke decided to be vine
  charcoal.</p>

  <p>"That lot is not very illuminating," remarked Morris, peering into the
  pockets of the letter-case. "No letter or anything indicating his permanent
  address. However, that isn't our concern." He laid aside the letter-case, and
  picking up a pocket-knife that Thorndyke had just taken from the trousers
  pocket, examined it curiously. "Queer knife, that," he remarked, "steel
  blade&mdash;mighty sharp, too&mdash;nail file and an ivory blade. Silly
  arrangement, it seems. A paperknife is more convenient carried loose, and you
  don't want a handle to it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was meant for a fruit-knife," suggested Hallett, adding it to
  the list and glancing at a little heap of silver coins that Thorndyke had
  just laid down. "I wonder," he added, "what has made that money turn so
  black. Looks! as if he had been taking some medicine containing sulphur. What
  do you think, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite a probable explanation," replied Thorndyke, "though we
  haven't the means of testing it. But you notice that this vesta-box from the
  other pocket is quite bright, which is rather against your theory."</p>

  <p>He held out a little silver box bearing the engraved monogram "P.R.", the
  burnished surface of which contrasted strongly with the dull brownish-black
  of the coins. Hallett looked at it with an affirmative grunt, and having
  entered it in his list and added a bunch of keys and a watch from the
  waistcoat pocket, laid down his pen.</p>

  <p>"That's the lot, is it?" said he, rising and beginning to gather up the
  clothes. "My word! Look at the sand on the table! Isn't it astonishing how
  saturated with sand one's clothes become after a day on the links here? When
  I undress at night, the bathroom floor is like the bottom of a bird-cage.
  Shall I put the things in the locker now?"</p>

  <p>"I think", said Thorndyke, "that, as I may have to give evidence, I should
  like to look them over before you put them away."</p>

  <p>Hallett grinned. "There's going to be some expert evidence after all," he
  said. "Well, fire away, and let me know when you have finished. I am going to
  smoke a cigarette outside."</p>

  <p>With this, he and Morris sauntered out, and I thought it best to go with
  them, though I was a little curious as to my colleague's object in examining
  these derelicts. However, my curiosity was not entirely baulked, for my
  friends went no farther than the little garden that surrounded the house, and
  from the place where we stood I was able to look in through the window and
  observe Thorndyke's proceedings.</p>

  <p>Very methodical they were. First he laid on the table a sheet of newspaper
  and on this deposited the jacket, which he examined carefully all over,
  picking some small object off the inside near the front, and giving special
  attention to a thick smear of paint which I had noticed on the left cuff.
  Then, with his spring tape he measured the sleeves and other principal
  dimensions. Finally, holding the jacket upside down, he beat it gently with
  his stick, causing a shower of sand to fall on the paper. He then laid the
  jacket aside, and, taking from his pocket one or two seed envelopes (which I
  believe he always carried), very carefully shot the sand from the paper into
  one of them and wrote a few words on it&mdash;presumably the source of the
  sand&mdash;and similarly disposing of the small object that he had picked off
  the surface.</p>

  <p>This rather odd procedure was repeated with the other garments&mdash;a
  fresh sheet of newspaper being used for each and with the socks, shoes, and
  cap. The latter he examined minutely, especially as to the inside, from which
  he picked out two or three small objects, which I could not see, but assumed
  to be hairs. Even the walking-stick was inspected and measured, and the
  articles from the pockets scrutinized afresh, particularly the curious
  pocket-knife, the ivory blade of which he examined on both sides through his
  lens.</p>

  <p>Hallett and Morris glanced in at him from time to time with indulgent
  smiles, and the former remarked:</p>

  <p>"I like the hopeful enthusiasm of the real pukka expert, and the way he
  refuses to admit the existence of the ordinary and commonplace. I wonder what
  he has found out from those things. But here he is. Well, doctor, what's the
  verdict? Was it temporary insanity or misadventure?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "The inquiry is adjourned pending the production
  of fresh evidence," he replied, adding: "I have folded the clothes up and put
  all the effects together in a paper parcel, excepting the stick."</p>

  <p>When Hallett had deposited the derelicts in the locker, he came out and
  looked across the links with an air of indecision.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said he, "we ought to notify the police. I'll do that. When
  do you think the body is likely to wash up, and where?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to say," replied Thorndyke. "The set of the current is
  towards the Thames, but the body might wash up anywhere along the coast. A
  case is recorded of a bather drowned off Brighton whose body came up six
  weeks later at Walton-on-the-Naze. But that was quite exceptional. I shall
  send the coroner and the Chief Constable a note with my address, and I should
  think you had better do the same. And that is all that we can do, until we
  get the summons for the inquest, if there ever is one."</p>

  <p>To this we all agreed; and as the morning was now spent we walked back
  together across the links to the town, where we encountered my wife returning
  homeward with her sketching kit. This Thorndyke and I took possession of and
  having parted from Hallett and Morris opposite the Barbican, we made our way
  to our lodgings in quest of lunch. Naturally, the events of the morning were
  related to my wife and discussed by us all, but I noted that Thorndyke made
  no reference to his inspection of the clothes, and accordingly I said nothing
  about the matter before my wife; and no opportunity of opening the subject
  occurred until the evening, when I accompanied him to the station. Then, as
  we paced the platform while waiting for his train, I put my question:</p>

  <p>"By the way, did you extract any information from those garments? I saw
  you going through them very thoroughly."</p>

  <p>"I got a suggestion from them," he replied, "but it is such an odd one
  that I hardly like to mention it. Taking the appearances at their face value,
  the suggestion was that the clothes were not all those of the same man. There
  seemed to be traces of two men, one of whom appeared to belong to this
  district, while the other would seem to have been associated with the eastern
  coast of Thanet between Ramsgate and Margate, and by preference, on the scale
  of probabilities, to Dumpton or Broadstairs."</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you arrive at the localities?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Principally," he replied, "by the peculiarities of the sand which fell
  from the garments and which was not the same in all of them. You see,
  Anstey," he continued, "sand is analogous to dust. Both consist of minute
  fragments detached from larger masses; and just as, by examining
  microscopically the dust of a room, you can ascertain the colour and material
  of the carpets, curtains, furniture coverings, and other textiles, detached
  particles of which form the dust of that room, so, by examining sand, you can
  judge of the character of the cliffs, rocks, and other large masses that
  occur in the locality, fragments of which become ground off by the surf and
  incorporated in the sand of the beach. Some of the sand from these clothes is
  very characteristic and will probably be still more so when I examine it
  under the microscope."</p>

  <p>"But", I objected, "isn't there a fallacy in that line of reasoning? Might
  not one man have worn the different garments at different times and in
  different places?"</p>

  <p>"That is certainly a possibility that has to be borne in mind," he
  replied. "But here comes my train. We shall have to adjourn this discussion
  until you come back to the mill."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the discussion was never resumed, for, by the time
  that I came back to "the mill", the affair had faded from my mind, and the
  accumulations of grist monopolized my attention; and it is probable that it
  would have passed into complete oblivion but for the circumstance of its
  being revived in a very singular manner, which was as follows.</p>

  <p>One afternoon about the middle of October my old friend, Mr. Brodribb, a
  well-known solicitor, called to give me some verbal instructions. When he had
  finished our business, he said:</p>

  <p>"I've got a client waiting outside, whom I am taking up to introduce to
  Thorndyke. You'd better come along with us."</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of your client's case?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know," chuckled Brodribb. "He won't say. That's why I am
  taking him to our friend. I've never seen Thorndyke stumped yet, but I think
  this case will put the lid on him. Are you coming?"</p>

  <p>"I am, most emphatically," said I, "if your client doesn't object."</p>

  <p>"He's not going to be asked," said Brodribb. "He'll think you are part of
  the show. Here he is."</p>

  <p>In my outer office we found a gentlemanly, middle-aged man to whom
  Brodribb introduced me, and whom he hustled down the stairs and up King's
  Bench Walk to Thorndyke's chambers. There we found my colleague earnestly
  studying a will with the aid of a watchmaker's eye-glass, and Brodribb opened
  the proceedings without ceremony.</p>

  <p>"I've brought a client of mine, Mr. Capes, to see you, Thorndyke. He has a
  little problem that he wants you to solve."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke bowed to the client and then asked:</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the problem?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Brodribb, with a mischievous twinkle, "that's what you've got
  to find out. Mr. Capes is a somewhat reticent gentleman."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke cast a quick look at the client and from him to the solicitor.
  It was not the first time that old Brodribb's high spirits had overflowed in
  the form of a "leg-pull", though Thorndyke had no more whole-hearted admirer
  than the shrewd, facetious old lawyer.</p>

  <p>Mr. Capes smiled a deprecating smile. "It isn't quite so bad as that," he
  said. "But I really can't give you much information. It isn't mine to give. I
  am afraid of telling someone else's secrets, if I say very much."</p>

  <p>"Of course you mustn't do that," said Thorndyke. "But, I suppose you can
  indicate in general terms the nature of your difficulty and the kind of help
  you want from us."</p>

  <p>"I think I can," Mr. Capes replied. "At any rate, I will try. My
  difficulty is that a certain person with whom I wish to communicate has
  disappeared in what appears to me to be a rather remarkable manner. When I
  last heard from him, he was staying at a certain seaside resort and he stated
  in his letter that he was returning on the following day to his rooms in
  London. A few days later, I called at his rooms and found that he had not yet
  returned. But his luggage, which he had sent on independently, had arrived on
  the day which he had mentioned. So it is evident that he must have left his
  seaside lodgings. But from that day to this I have had no communication from
  him, and he has never returned to his rooms nor written to his landlady."</p>

  <p>"About how long ago was this?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"It is just about two months since I heard from him."</p>

  <p>"You don't wish to give the name of the seaside resort where he was
  staying."</p>

  <p>"I think I had better not," answered Mr. Capes. "There are
  circumstances&mdash;they don't concern me, but they do concern him very
  much&mdash;which seem to make it necessary for me to say as little as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"And there is nothing further that you can tell us?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not, excepting that, if I could get into communication with
  him, I could tell him of something very much to his advantage and which might
  prevent him from doing something which it would be much better that he should
  not do."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke cogitated profoundly while Brodribb watched him with undisguised
  enjoyment. Presently my colleague looked up and addressed our secretive
  client.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever play the game of "Clump", Mr. Capes? It is a somewhat legal
  form of game in which one player asks questions of the others, who are
  required to answer "yes" or "no" in the proper witness-box style."</p>

  <p>"I know the game," said Capes, looking a little puzzled, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shall we try a round or two?" asked Thorndyke, with an unmoved
  countenance. "You don't wish to make any statements, but if I ask you certain
  specific questions, will you answer 'yes or no?'"</p>

  <p>Mr. Capes reflected awhile. At length he said: "I am afraid I can't commit
  myself to a promise. Still, if you like to ask a question or two, I will
  answer them if I can."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, "then, as a start, supposing I suggest that
  the date of the letter that you received was the thirteenth of August? What
  do you say? Yes or no?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Capes sat bolt upright and stared at Thorndyke open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you guess that?" he exclaimed in an astonished tone.
  "It's most extraordinary! But you are right. It was dated the
  thirteenth."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "as we have fixed the time we will have a try at
  the place. What do you say if I suggest that the seaside resort was in the
  neighbourhood of Broadstairs?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Capes was positively thunderstruck. As he sat gazing at Thorndyke he
  looked like amazement personified.</p>

  <p>"But," he exclaimed, "you can't be guessing! You know! You know that he
  was at Broadstairs. And yet, how could you? I haven't even hinted at who he
  is."</p>

  <p>"I have a certain man in my mind," said Thorndyke, "who may have
  disappeared from Broadstairs. Shall I suggest a few personal
  characteristics?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Capes nodded eagerly and Thorndyke continued:</p>

  <p>"If I suggest, for instance, that he was an artist&mdash;a painter in
  oil"&mdash;Capes nodded again&mdash;"that he was somewhat fastidious as to
  his pigments?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Capes. "Unnecessarily so in my opinion, and I am an artist
  myself. What else?"</p>

  <p>"That he worked with his palette in his right hand and held his brush with
  his left?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," exclaimed Capes, half-rising from his chair; "and what was he
  like?"</p>

  <p>"By gum," murmured Brodribb, "we haven't stumped him after all."</p>

  <p>Evidently we had not, for he proceeded:</p>

  <p>"As to his physical characteristics, I suggest that he was a shortish
  man&mdash;about five feet seven&mdash;rather stout, fair hair, slightly bald
  and wearing a rather large and ragged moustache."</p>

  <p>Mr. Capes was astounded&mdash;and so was I, for that matter&mdash;and for
  some moments there was a silence, broken only by old Brodribb, who sat
  chuckling softly and rubbing his hands. At length Mr. Capes said:</p>

  <p>"You have described him exactly, but I needn't tell you that. What I do
  not understand at all is how you knew that I was referring to this particular
  man, seeing that I mentioned no name. By the way, sir, may I ask when you saw
  him last?"</p>

  <p>"I have no reason to suppose," replied Thorndyke, "that I have ever seen
  him at all;" an answer that reduced Mr. Capes to a state of stupefaction and
  brought our old friend Brodribb to the verge of apoplexy. "This man,"
  Thorndyke continued, "is a purely hypothetical individual whom I have
  described from certain traces left by him. I have reason to believe that he
  left Broadstairs on the fourteenth of August and I have certain opinions as
  to what became of him thereafter. But a few more details would be useful, and
  I shall continue my interrogation. Now this man sent his luggage on
  separately. That suggests a possible intention of breaking his journey to
  London. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Capes, "but I think it probable."</p>

  <p>"I suggest that he broke his journey for the purpose of holding an
  interview with some other person."</p>

  <p>"I cannot say," answered Capes, "but if he did break his journey it would
  probably be for that purpose."</p>

  <p>"And supposing that interview to have taken place, would it be likely to
  be an amicable interview?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not. I suspect that my&mdash;er&mdash;acquaintance might have
  made certain proposals which would have been unacceptable, but which he might
  have been able to enforce. However, that is only surmise," Capes added
  hastily. "I really know nothing more than I have told you, except the missing
  man's name, and that I would rather not mention."</p>

  <p>"It is not material," said Thorndyke, "at least, not at present. If it
  should become essential, I will let you know."</p>

  <p>"M&mdash;yes," said Mr. Capes. "But you were saying that you had certain
  opinions as to what has become of this person."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied; "speculative opinions. But they will have to be
  verified. If they turn out to be correct&mdash;or incorrect either&mdash;I
  will let you know in the course of a few days. Has Mr. Brodribb your
  address?"</p>

  <p>"He has; but you had better have it, too."</p>

  <p>He produced his card, and, after an ineffectual effort to extract a
  statement from Thorndyke, took his departure.</p>

  <p>The third act of this singular drama opened in the same setting as the
  first, for the following Sunday morning found my colleague and me following
  the path from Sandwich to the sea. But we were not alone this time. At our
  side marched Major Robertson, the eminent dog trainer, and behind him trotted
  one of his superlatively educated fox-hounds.</p>

  <p>We came out on the shore at the same point as on the former occasion, and
  turning towards Shellness, walked along the smooth sand with a careful eye on
  the not very distinctive landmarks. At length Thorndyke halted.</p>

  <p>"This is the place," said he. "I fixed it in my mind by that distant tree,
  which coincides with the chimney of that cottage on the marshes. The clothes
  lay in that hollow between the two big sand-hills."</p>

  <p>We advanced to the spot, but, as a hollow is useless as a landmark,
  Thorndyke ascended the nearest sand-hill and stuck his stick in the summit
  and tied his handkerchief to the handle.</p>

  <p>"That," he said, "will serve as a centre which we can keep in sight, and
  if we describe a series of gradually widening concentric circles round it, we
  shall cover the whole ground completely."</p>

  <p>"How far do you propose to go?" asked the major.</p>

  <p>"We must be guided by the appearance of the ground," replied Thorndyke.
  "But the circumstances suggest that if there is anything buried, it can't be
  very far from where the clothes were laid. And it is pretty certain to be in
  a hollow."</p>

  <p>The major nodded; and when he had attached a long leash to the dog's
  collar, we started, at first skirting the base of the sand-hill, and then,
  guided by our own footmarks in the loose sand, gradually increasing the
  distance from the high mound, above which Thorndyke's handkerchief fluttered
  in the light breeze. Thus we continued, walking slowly, keeping close to the
  previously made circle of footprints and watching the dog; who certainly did
  a vast amount of sniffing, but appeared to let his mind run unduly on the
  subject of rabbits.</p>

  <p>In this way half an hour was consumed, and I was beginning to wonder
  whether we were going after all to draw a blank, when the dog's demeanour
  underwent a sudden change. At the moment we were crossing a range of high
  sand-hills, covered with stiff, reedy grass and stunted gorse, and before us
  lay a deep hollow, naked of vegetation and presenting a bare, smooth surface
  of the characteristic greyish-yellow sand. On the side of the hill the dog
  checked, and, with upraised muzzle, began to sniff the air with a curiously
  suspicious expression, clearly unconnected with the rabbit question. On this,
  the major unfastened the leash, and the dog, left to his own devices, put his
  nose to the ground and began rapidly to cast to and fro, zig-zagging down the
  side of the hill and growing every moment more excited. In the same sinuous
  manner he proceeded across the hollow until he reached a spot near the
  middle; and here he came to a sudden stop and began to scratch up the sand
  with furious eagerness.</p>

  <p>"It's a find, sure enough!" exclaimed the major, nearly as excited as his
  pupil; and, as he spoke, he ran down the hillside, followed by me and
  Thorndyke, who, as he reached the bottom, drew from his "poacher's pocket" a
  large fern-trowel in a leather sheath. It was not a very efficient digging
  implement, but it threw up the loose sand faster than the scratchings of the
  dog.</p>

  <p>It was easy ground to excavate. Working at the spot that the dog had
  located, Thorndyke had soon hollowed out a small cavity some eighteen inches
  deep. Into the bottom of this he thrust the pointed blade of the big trowel.
  Then he paused and looked round at the major and me, who were craning eagerly
  over the little pit.</p>

  <p>"There is something there," said he. "Feel the handle of the trowel."</p>

  <p>I grasped the wooden handle, and, working it gently up and down, was aware
  of a definite but somewhat soft resistance. The major verified my
  observation, and then Thorndyke resumed his digging, widening the pit and
  working with increased caution. Ten minutes more careful excavation brought
  into view a recognizable shape&mdash;a shoulder and upper arm; and following
  the lines of this, further diggings disclosed the form of a head and
  shoulders plainly discernable though still shrouded in sand. Finally, with
  the point of the trowel and a borrowed handkerchief&mdash;mine&mdash;the
  adhering sand was cleared away; and then, from the bottom of the deep,
  funnel-shaped hole, there looked up at us, with a most weird and horrible
  effect, the discoloured face of a man.</p>

  <p>In that face, the passing weeks had wrought inevitable changes, on which I
  need not dwell. But the features were easily recognizable, and I could see at
  once that the man corresponded completely with Thorndyke's description. The
  cheeks were full; the hair on the temples was of a pale, yellowish brown; a
  straggling, fair moustache covered the mouth; and, when the sand had been
  sufficiently cleared away, I could see a small, tonsure-like bald patch near
  the back of the crown. But I could see something more than this. On the left
  temple, just behind the eyebrow, was a ragged, shapeless wound such as might
  have been made by a hammer.</p>

  <p>"That turns into certainty what we have already surmised," said Thorndyke,
  gently pressing the scalp around the wound. "It must have killed him
  instantly. The skull is smashed in like an egg-shell. And this is undoubtedly
  the weapon," he added, drawing out of the sand beside the body a big,
  hexagon-headed screw-bolt, "very prudently buried with the body. And that is
  all that really concerns us. We can leave the police to finish the
  disinterment; but you notice, Anstey, that the corpse is nude with the
  exception of the vest and probably the pants. The shirt has disappeared.
  Which is exactly what we should have expected."</p>

  <p>Slowly, but with the feeling of something accomplished, we took our way
  back to the town, having collected Thorndyke's stick on the way. Presently,
  the major left us, to look up a friend at the clubhouse on the links. As soon
  as we were alone, I put in a demand for an elucidation.</p>

  <p>"I see the general trend of your investigations," said I "but I can't
  imagine how they yielded so much detail; as to the personal appearance of
  this man, for instance."</p>

  <p>"The evidence in this case," he replied, "was analogous to circumstantial
  evidence. It depended on the cumulative effect of a number of facts, each
  separately inconclusive, but all pointing to the same conclusion. Shall I run
  over the data in their order and in accordance with their connections?"</p>

  <p>I gave an emphatic affirmative, and he continued:</p>

  <p>"We begin, naturally, with the first fact, which is, of course, the most
  interesting and important; the fact which arrests attention, which shows that
  something has to be explained and possibly suggests a line of inquiry. You
  remember that I measured the footprints in the sand for comparison with the
  other footprints. Then I had the dimensions of the feet of the presumed
  bather. But as soon as I looked at the shoes which purported to be those of
  that bather, I felt a conviction that his feet would never go into them.</p>

  <p>"Now, that was a very striking fact&mdash;if it really was a
  fact&mdash;and it came on top of another fact hardly less striking, The
  bather had gone into the sea; and at a considerable distance he had
  unquestionably come out again. There could be no possible doubt. In
  foot-measurement and length of stride the two sets of tracks were identical;
  and there were no other tracks. That man had come ashore and he had remained
  ashore. But yet he had not put on his clothes. He couldn't have gone away
  naked; but obviously he was not there. As a criminal lawyer, you must admit
  that there was prima facie evidence of something very abnormal and probably
  criminal.</p>

  <p>"On our way to the dormy-house, I carried the stick in the same hand as my
  own and noted that it was very little shorter. Therefore it was a tall man's
  stick. Apparently, then, the stick did not belong to the shoes, but to the
  man who had made the footprints. Then, when we came to the dormy-house,
  another striking fact presented itself. You remember that Hallett commented
  on the quantity of sand that fell from the clothes on to the table. I am
  astonished that he did not notice the very peculiar character of that sand.
  It was perfectly unlike the sand which would fall from his own clothes. The
  sand on the sand-hills is dune sand&mdash;wind-borne sand, or, as the legal
  term has it, olian sand; and it is perfectly characteristic. As it has been
  carried by the wind, it is necessarily fine. The grains are small; and as the
  action of the wind sorts them out, they are extremely uniform in size.
  Moreover, by being continually blown about and rubbed together, they become
  rounded by mutual attrition. And then dune sand is nearly pure sand, composed
  of grains of silica unmixed with other substances.</p>

  <p>"Beach sand is quite different. Much of it is half-formed, freshly broken
  down silica and is often very coarse; and, as I pointed out at the time, it
  is mixed with all sorts of foreign substances derived from masses in the
  neighbourhood. This particular sand was loaded with black and white
  particles, of which the white were mostly chalk, and the black particles of
  coal. Now there is very little chalk in the Shellness sand, as there are no
  cliffs quite near, and chalk rapidly disappears from sand by reason of its
  softness; and there is no coal."</p>

  <p>"Where does the coal come from?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Principally from the Goodwins," he replied. "It is derived from the
  cargoes of colliers whose wrecks are embedded in those sands, and from the
  bunkers of wrecked steamers. This coal sinks down through the seventy odd
  feet of sand and at last works out at the bottom, where it drifts slowly
  across the floor of the sea in a north-westerly direction until some easterly
  gale throws it up on the Thanet shore between Ramsgate and Foreness Point.
  Most of it comes up at Dumpton and Broadstairs, there you may see the poor
  people, in the winter, gathering coal pebbles to feed their fires.</p>

  <p>"This sand, then, almost certainly came from the Thanet coast; but the
  missing man, Roscoff, had been staying in Sandwich, playing golf on the
  sand-hills. This was another striking discrepancy, and it made me decide to
  examine the clothes exhaustively, garment by garment. I did so; and this is
  what I found.</p>

  <p>"The jacket, trousers, socks and shoes were those of a shortish, rather
  stout man, as shown by measurements, and the cap was his, since it was made
  of the same cloth as the jacket and trousers.</p>

  <p>"The waistcoat, shirt, underclothes and stick were those of a tall
  man.</p>

  <p>"The garments, socks and shoes of the short man were charged with Thanet
  beach sand, and contained no dune sand, excepting the cap, which might have
  fallen off on the sand-hills.</p>

  <p>"The waistcoat was saturated with dune sand and contained no beach sand,
  and a little dune sand was obtained from the shirt and under-garments. That
  is to say, that the short man's clothes contained beach sand only, while the
  tall man's clothes contained only dune sand.</p>

  <p>"The short man's clothes were all unmarked; the tall man's clothes were
  either marked or conspicuously recognizable, as the waistcoat and also the
  stick.</p>

  <p>"The garments of the short man which had been left were those that could
  not have been worn by a tall man without attracting instant attention and the
  shoes could not have been put on at all; whereas the garments of the short
  man which had disappeared&mdash;the waistcoat, shirt and
  underclothes&mdash;were those that could have been worn by a tall man without
  attracting attention. The obvious suggestion was that the tall man had gone
  off in the short man's shirt and waistcoat but otherwise in his own
  clothes.</p>

  <p>"And now as to the personal characteristics of the short man. From the cap
  I obtained five hairs. They were all blond, and two of them were of the
  peculiar, atrophic, "point of exclamation" type that grow at the margin of a
  bald area. Therefore he was a fair man and partially bald. On the inside of
  the jacket, clinging to the rough tweed, I found a single long, thin, fair
  moustache hair, which suggested a long, soft moustache. The edge of the left
  cuff was thickly marked with oil-paint-not a single smear, but an
  accumulation such as a painter picks up when he reaches with his brush hand
  across a loaded palette. The suggestion&mdash;not very conclusive&mdash;was
  that he was an oil-painter and left-handed. But there was strong
  confirmation. There was an artist's pencil&mdash;3B&mdash;and a stump of vine
  charcoal such as an oil-painter might carry. The silver coins in his pocket
  were blackened with sulphide as they would be if a piece of artist's soft,
  vulcanized rubber has been in the pocket with them. And there was the
  pocket-knife. It contained a sharp steel pencil-blade, a charcoal file and an
  ivory palette-blade; and that palette-blade had been used by a left-handed
  man."</p>

  <p>"How did you arrive at that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"By the bevels worn at the edges," he replied. "An old palette-knife used
  by a right-handed man shows a bevel of wear on the under side of the
  left-hand edge and the upper side of the right-hand edge; in the case of a
  left handed man the wear shows on the under side of the right hand edge and
  the upper side of the left-hand edge. This being an ivory blade, showed the
  wear very distinctly and proved conclusively that the user was left-handed;
  and as an ivory palette-knife is used only by fastidiously careful painters
  for such pigments as the cadmiums, which might be discoloured by a steel
  blade, one was justified in assuing that he was somewhat fastidious as to his
  pigments."</p>

  <p>As I listened to Thorndyke's exposition I was profoundly impressed. His
  conclusions, which had sounded like mere speculative guesses, were, I now
  realized, based upon an analysis of the evidence as careful and as impartial
  as the summing up of a judge. And these conclusions he had drawn
  instantaneously from the appearances of things that had been before my eyes
  all the time and from which I had learned nothing.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose is the meaning of the affair?" I asked presently.
  "What was the motive of the murder?"</p>

  <p>"We can only guess," he replied. "But, interpreting Capes' hints, I should
  suspect that our artist friend was a blackmailer; that he had come over here
  to squeeze Roscoff&mdash;perhaps not for the first time&mdash;and that his
  victim lured him out on the sand-hills for a private talk and then took the
  only effective means of ridding himself of his persecutor. That is my view of
  the case; but, of course, it is only surmise."</p>

  <p>Surmise as it was, however, it turned out to be literally correct. At the
  inquest Capes had to tell all that he knew, which was uncommonly little,
  though no one was able to add to it. The murdered man, Joseph Bertrand, had
  fastened on Roscoff and made a regular income by blackmailing him. That much
  Capes knew; and he knew that the victim had been in prison and that that was
  the secret. But who Roscoff was and what was his real name&mdash;for Roscoff
  was apparently a nom de guerre&mdash;he had no idea. So he could not help the
  police. The murderer had got clear away and there was no hint as to where to
  look for him; and so far as I know, nothing has ever been heard of him
  since.</p>

  <h2><a name="c8"
     id="c8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE APPARITION OF BURLING COURT</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNDYKE seldom took a formal holiday. He did not seem to
  need one. As he himself put it, "A holiday implies the exchange of a less
  pleasurable occupation for one more pleasurable. But there is no occupation
  more pleasurable than the practice of Medical Jurisprudence." Moreover, his
  work was less affected by terms and vacations than that of an ordinary
  barrister, and the Long Vacation often found him with his hands full. Even
  when he did appear to take a holiday the appearance tended to be misleading,
  and it was apt to turn out that his disappearance from his usual haunts was
  associated with a case of unusual interest at a distance.</p>

  <p>Thus it was on the occasion when our old friend, Mr. Brodribb, of
  Lincoln's Inn, beguiled him into a fortnight's change at St.
  David's-at-Cliffe, a seaside hamlet on the Kentish coast. There was a case in
  the background, and a very curious case it turned out to be, though at first
  it appeared to me quite a commonplace affair; and the manner of its
  introduction was as follows.</p>

  <p>One hot afternoon in the early part of the Long Vacation the old solicitor
  dropped in for a cup of tea and a chat. That, at least, was how he explained
  his visit; but my experience of Mr. Brodribb led me to suspect some ulterior
  purpose in the call, and as he sat by the open window, teacup in hand,
  looking, with his fine pink complexion, his silky white hair and his
  faultless "turn out," the very type of the courtly, old-fashioned lawyer, I
  waited expectantly for the matter of his visit to transpire. And, presently,
  out it came.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take a little holiday down at St. David's," said he. "Just
  a quiet spell by the sea, you know. Delightful place. So quiet and restful
  and so breezy and fresh. Ever been there?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "I only just know the name."</p>

  <p>"Well, why shouldn't you come down for a week or so? Both of you. I shall
  stay at Burling Court, the Lumleys' place. I can't invite you there as I'm
  only a guest, but I know of some comfortable rooms in the village that I
  could get for you. I wish you would come down, Thorndyke," he added after a
  pause. "I'm rather unhappy about young Lumley&mdash;I'm the family lawyer,
  you know, and so was my father and my grandfather, so I feel almost as if the
  Lumleys were my own kin&mdash;and I should like to have your advice and
  help."</p>

  <p>"Why not have it now?" suggested Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I will," he replied; "but I should like your help on the spot too. I'd
  like you to see Lumley have a talk with him and tell me what you think of
  him."</p>

  <p>"What is amiss with him?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," answered Brodribb, "it looks uncomfortably like insanity. He has
  delusions&mdash;sees apparitions and that sort of thing. And there is some
  insanity in the family. But I had better give you the facts in their natural
  order.</p>

  <p>"About four months ago Giles Lumley of Burling Court died; and as he was a
  widower without issue, the estate passed to his nearest male relative, my
  present client, Frank Lumley, who was also the principal beneficiary under
  the will. At the time of Giles' death Frank was abroad, but a cousin of his,
  Lewis Price, was staying at the house with his wife as a more or less
  permanent guest; and as Price's circumstances were not very flourishing, and
  as he is the next heir to the estate, Frank&mdash;who is a
  bachelor&mdash;wrote to him at once telling him to look upon Burling Court as
  his home for as long as he pleased."</p>

  <p>"That was extremely generous of him," I remarked</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb agreed; "Frank is a good fellow; a very high-minded
  gentleman and a very sweet man but a little queer&mdash;very queer just now.
  Well, Frank came back from abroad and took up his abode at the house; and for
  a time all went well. Then, one day, Price called on me and gave me some very
  unpleasant news. It seemed that Frank, who had always been rather neurotic
  and imaginative, had been interesting himself a good deal in psychical
  research and&mdash;and balderdash of that kind, you know. Well, there was no
  great harm in that, perhaps. But just lately he had taken to seeing visions
  and&mdash;what was worse&mdash;talking about them; so much so that Price got
  uneasy and privately invited a mental specialist down to lunch; and the
  specialist, having had a longish talk with Frank Price confidentially that he
  (Frank) was obviously suffering from insane delusions. Thereupon Price called
  me and begged me to see Frank myself and what ought to be done; so I made an
  occasion for him to come and see me at the office."</p>

  <p>"And what did you think of him?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I was horrified&mdash;horrified," said Mr. Brodribb. "I assure you,
  Thorndyke, that that poor young man sat in my office and talked like a stark
  lunatic. Quite quietly, you know. No excitement, though he was evidently
  anxious and unhappy. But there he sat gravely talking the damnedest nonsense
  you ever heard."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Well, his infernal visions. Luminous birds flying about in the dark, and
  a human head suspended in mid air&mdash;upside down, too. But I had better
  give you his story as he told it. I made full shorthand notes as he was
  talking, and I've brought them with me, though I hardly need them.</p>

  <p>"His trouble seems to have begun soon after he took up his quarters at
  Burling Court. Being a bookish sort of fellow, he started to go through his
  library systematically; and presently he came across a small manuscript book,
  which turned out to be a sort of family history, or rather a collection of
  episodes. It was rather a lurid little book, for it apparently dwelt chiefly
  on the family crime, the family spectre and the family madness."</p>

  <p>"Did you know about these heirlooms?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No; it was the first I'd heard of 'em. Price knew there was some soft of
  family superstition, but he didn't know what it was; and Giles knew about
  it&mdash;so Price tells me&mdash;but didn't care to talk about it. He never
  mentioned it to me."</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the tradition?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said Brodribb, taking out his notes. "I've got it all
  down, and poor Frank reeled the stuff off as if he had learned it by heart.
  The book, which is dated 1819, was apparently written by a Walter Lumley and
  the story of the crime and the spook runs thus:</p>

  <p>"About 1720 the property passed to a Gilbert Lumley, a naval officer, who
  then gave up the sea, married and settled down at Burling Court. A year or
  two later some trouble arose about his wife and a man named Glynn, a
  neighbouring squire. With or without cause, Lumley became violently jealous,
  and the end of it was that he lured Glynn to a large cavern in the cliffs and
  there murdered him. It was a most ferocious and vindictive crime. The cavern,
  which was then used by smugglers, had a beam across the roof bearing a tackle
  for hoisting out boat cargoes, and this tackle Lumley fastened to Glynn's
  ankles&mdash;having first pinioned him&mdash;and hoisted him up so that he
  hung head downwards a foot or so clear of the floor of the cave. And there he
  left him hanging until the rising tide flowed into the cave and drowned
  him.</p>

  <p>"The very next day the murder was discovered, and as Lumley was the
  nearest justice of the peace, the discoverers reported to him and took him to
  the cave to the body. When he entered the cave the corpse was stilt hanging
  as he had left the living man, and a bat was flittering round and round the
  dead man's head. He had the body taken down and carried to Glynn's house and
  took the necessary measures for the inquest. Of course, everyone suspected
  him of the murder, but there was no evidence against him. The verdict was
  murder by some person unknown, and as Gilbert Lumley was not sensitive,
  everything seemed to have gone quite satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>"But it hadn't. One night, exactly a month after murder, Gilbert retired
  to his bedroom in the dark. He was in the act of feeling along the
  mantelpiece for the tinder-box, when he became aware of a dim light moving
  about the room. He turned round quickly and then saw that it was a
  bat&mdash;a most uncanny and abnormal bat that seemed to give out a greenish
  ghostly light&mdash;flitting round and round his bed. On this, remembering
  the bat in the cavern, he rushed out of the room in the very devil of a
  fright. Presently he returned with one of the servants and a couple of
  candles; but the bat had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"From that time onward, the luminous bat haunted Gilbert, appearing in
  dark rooms, on staircases and passages and corridors, until his nerves were
  all on end and he did not dare to move about the house at night without a
  candle or a lantern. But that was not the worst. Exactly two months after the
  murder the next stage of the haunting began. He had retired to his bedroom
  and was just about to get into bed when he remembered that he had left his
  watch in the little dressing-room that adjoined his chamber. With a candle in
  his hand he went to the dressing-room and flung open the door. And then he
  stopped dead and stood as if turned into stone; for, within a couple of yards
  of him, suspended in mid-air, was a man's head hanging upside down.</p>

  <p>"For some seconds he stood rooted to the spot, unable to move. Then he
  uttered a cry of horror and rushed back to his room and down to the hall.
  There was no doubt whose head it was, strange and horrible as it looked in
  that unnatural, inverted position; for he had seen it twice before in that
  very position hanging in the cavern. Evidently he had not got rid of
  Glynn.</p>

  <p>"That night, and every night henceforward, he slept in his wife's room.
  And all through the night he was conscious of a strange and dreadful impulse
  to rise and go down to the shore; to steal into the cavern and wait for the
  flowing tide. He lay awake, fighting against the invisible power that seemed
  to be drawing him to destruction, and by the morning the horrid impulse began
  to weaken. But he went about in terror, not daring to go near the shore and
  afraid to trust himself alone.</p>

  <p>"A month passed. The effect of the apparition grew daily weaker and an
  abundance of lights in the house protected him from the visitation of the
  bat. Then, exactly three months after the murder, he saw the head again. This
  time it was in the library, where he had gone to fetch a book. He was
  standing by the book shelves and had just taken out a volume, when, as he
  turned away, there the hideous thing was hanging in that awful, grotesque
  posture, chin upwards and the scanty hair dropping down like wet fringe.
  Gilbert dropped the book that he was holding and fled from the room with a
  shriek; and all that night invisible hands seemed to be plucking at him to
  draw him away to where the voices of the waves were reverberating in the
  cavern.</p>

  <p>"This second visitation affected him profoundly. He could not shake off
  that sinister impulse to steal away to the shore. He was a broken man, the
  victim of an abiding terror, clinging for protection to the very servants,
  creeping abroad with shaking limbs and an apprehensive eye towards the sea.
  And ever in his ears was the murmur of the surf and the hollow echoes of the
  cavern.</p>

  <p>"Already he had sought forgetfulness in drink; and sought it in vain. Now
  he took refuge in opiates. Every night, before retiring to the dreaded bed,
  he mingled laudanum with the brandy that brought him stupor if not repose.
  And brandy and opium began to leave their traces in the tremulous hand, the
  sallow cheek and the bloodshot eye. And so another month passed.</p>

  <p>"As the day approached that would mark the fourth month, his terror of the
  visitation that he now anticipated reduced him to a state of utter
  prostration. Sleep&mdash;even drugged sleep&mdash;appeared that night to be
  out of the question, and he decided to sit up with his family, hoping by that
  means to escape the dreaded visitor. But it was a vain hope. Hour after hour
  he sat in his elbow chair by the fire, while his wife dozed in her chair
  opposite, until the clock in the hall struck twelve. He listened and counted
  the strokes of the bell, leaning back with his eyes closed. Half the weary
  night was gone. As the last stroke sounded and a deep silence fell on the
  house, he opened his eyes&mdash;and looked into the face of Glynn within a
  few inches of his own.</p>

  <p>"For some moments he sat with dropped jaw and dilated eyes staring in
  silent horror at this awful thing; then with an agonised screech he slid from
  his chair into a heap on the floor.</p>

  <p>"At noon on the following day he was missed from the house. A search was
  made in the grounds and in the neighbourhood, but he was nowhere to be found.
  At last someone thought of the cavern, of which he had spoken in his wild
  mutterings and a party of searchers made their way thither. And there they
  found him when the tide went out, lying on the wet sand with the brown
  sea-tangle wreathed about his limbs and the laudanum bottle&mdash;now full of
  sea water&mdash;by his side.</p>

  <p>"With the death of Gilbert Lumley it seemed that the murdered man's spirit
  was appeased. During the lifetime of Gilbert's son, Thomas, the departed
  Glynn made no sign. But on his death and the succession of his son
  Arthur&mdash;then a middle-aged man&mdash;the visitations began again, and in
  the same order. At the end of the first month the luminous bat appeared; at
  the end of the second, the inverted head made its entry, and again at the
  third and the fourth months; and within twenty-four hours of the last
  visitation, the body of Arthur Lumley was found in the cavern. And so it has
  been from that time onward. One generation escapes untouched by the curse;
  but in the next, Glynn and the sea claim their own."</p>

  <p>"Is that true, so far as you know?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I can't say," answered Brodribb. "I am now only quoting Walter Lumley's
  infernal little book. But I remember that, in fact, Giles' father was
  drowned. I understood that his boat capsized, but that may have been only a
  story to cover the suicide.</p>

  <p>"Well now, I have given you the gruesome history from this book that poor
  Frank had the misfortune to find. You see that he had it all off by heart
  and had evidently read it again and again. Now I come to his own story, which
  he told me very quietly but with intense conviction and very evident
  forebodings.</p>

  <p>"He found this damned book a few days after his arrival at Burling Court,
  and it was clear to him that, if the story was true, he was the next victim,
  since his predecessor, Giles, had been left in peace. And so it turned out.
  Exactly a month after his arrival, going up to his bedroom in the
  dark&mdash;no doubt expecting this apparition&mdash;as soon as he opened the
  door he saw a thing like a big glow-worm or firefly flitting round the room.
  It is evident that he was a good deal upset, for he rushed downstairs in a
  state of great agitation and fetched Price up to see it. But the strange
  thing was&mdash;though perhaps not so very strange, after all&mdash;that,
  although the thing was still there, flitting about the room, Price could see
  nothing. However, he pulled up the blind&mdash;the window was wide
  open&mdash;and the bat flopped out and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"During the next month the bat reappeared several times, in the bedroom,
  in corridors and once in a garret, when it flew out as Frank opened the
  door."</p>

  <p>"What was he doing in the garret?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"He went up to fetch an ancient coffin-stool that Mrs. Price had seen
  there and was telling him about. Well, this went on until the end of the
  second month. And then came the second act. It seems that by some infernal
  stupidity, he was occupying the bedroom that had been used by Gilbert. Now on
  this night, as soon as he had gone up, he must needs pay a visit to the
  little dressing-room, which is now known as 'Gilbert's cabin'&mdash;so he tells
  me, for I was not aware of it&mdash;and where Gilbert's cutlass, telescope,
  quadrant and the old navigator's watch are kept."</p>

  <p>"Did he take a light with him?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I think not. There is a gas jet in the corridor and presumably he lit
  that. Then he opened the door of the cabin; and immediately he saw, a few
  feet in front of him, a man's head, upside down, apparently hanging in
  mid-air. It gave him a fearful shock&mdash;the more so, perhaps, because he
  half expected it&mdash;and, as before, he ran downstairs, all of a tremble.
  Price had gone to bed but Mrs. Price came up with him, and he showed her the
  horrible thing which was still hanging in the middle of the dark room.</p>

  <p>"But Mrs. Price could see nothing. She assured him that it was all his
  imagination; and in proof of it, she walked into the room, right through the
  head, as it seemed, and when she had found the matches, she lit the gas. Of
  course, there was nothing whatever in the room.</p>

  <p>"Another month passed. The bat appeared at intervals and kept poor Frank's
  nerves in a state of constant tension. On the night of the appointed day, as
  you will anticipate, Frank went again to Gilbert's cabin, drawn there by an
  attraction that one can quite understand. And there, of course, was the
  confounded head as before. That was a fortnight ago. So, you see, the affair
  is getting urgent. Either there is some truth in this weird story&mdash;which
  I don't believe for a moment&mdash;or poor old Frank is ripe for the asylum.
  But in any case something will have to be done."</p>

  <p>"You spoke just now," said Thorndyke, "of some insanity in the family.
  What does it amount to, leaving these apparitions out of the question?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a cousin of Frank's committed suicide in an asylum."</p>

  <p>"And Frank's parents?"</p>

  <p>"They were quite sane. The cousin was the son of Frank's mother's sister;
  and she was all right, too. But the boy's father had to be put away."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "the insanity doesn't seem to be in Frank's family
  at all, in a medical sense. Legal inheritance and physiological inheritance
  do not follow the same lines. If his mother's sister married a lunatic, he
  might inherit that lunatic's property, but he could not inherit his insanity.
  There was no blood relationship."</p>

  <p>"No, that's true," Brodribb admitted, "though Frank certainly seems as mad
  as a hatter. But now, to come back to the holiday question, what do you say
  to a week or so at St. David's?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me interrogatively. "What says my learned friend?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I say: Let us put up the shutters and leave Polton in charge," I replied;
  and Thorndyke assented without a murmur.</p>

  <p>Less than a week later, we were installed in the very comfortable rooms
  that Mr. Brodribb had found for us in the hamlet of St. David's, within five
  minutes' walk of the steep gap-way that led down to the beach. Thorndyke
  entered into the holiday with an enthusiasm that would have astonished the
  denizens of King Bench Walk. He explored the village, he examined the church,
  inside and out, he sampled all the footpaths with the aid of the Ordnance
  map, he foregathered with the fishermen on the beach and renewed his
  acquaintance with boat-craft, and he made a pilgrimage to the historic
  cavern&mdash;it was less than a mile along the shore&mdash;and inspected its
  dark and chilly interior with the most lively curiosity.</p>

  <p>We had not been at St. David's twenty-four hours before we made the
  acquaintance of Frank Lumley. Mr. Brodribb saw to that. For the old solicitor
  was profoundly anxious about his client&mdash;he took his responsibilities
  very seriously, did Mr. Brodribb. His "family" clients were to him as his own
  kin, and their interests his own interests&mdash;and his confidence in
  Thorndyke's wisdom was unbounded. We were very favourably impressed by the
  quiet, gentle, rather frail young man, and for my part, I found him, for a
  certifiable lunatic, a singularly reasonable and intelligent person. Indeed,
  apart from his delusions&mdash;or rather hallucinations&mdash;he seemed
  perfectly sane; for a somewhat eager interest in psychical and supernormal
  phenomena (of which he made no secret) is hardly enough to create a suspicion
  of a man's sanity.</p>

  <p>But he was clearly uneasy about his own mental condition. He realised that
  the apparitions might be the products of a disordered brain, though that was
  not his own view of them; and he discussed them with us in the most open and
  ingenuous manner.</p>

  <p>"You don't think," Thorndyke suggested, "that these apparitions may
  possibly be natural appearances which you have misinterpreted or exaggerated
  in consequence of having read that very circumstantial story?"</p>

  <p>Lumley shook his head emphatically. "It is impossible," said he. "How
  could I? Take the case of the bat. I have seen it on several occasions quite
  distinctly. It was obviously a bat; but yet it seemed full of a ghostly,
  greenish light like that of a glow-worm. If it was not what it appeared, what
  was it? And then the head. There it was, perfectly clear and solid and real,
  hanging in mid-air within three or four feet of me. I could have touched it
  if I had dared."</p>

  <p>"What size did it appear?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Lumley reflected. "It was not quite life-size. I should say about
  two-thirds the size of an ordinary head."</p>

  <p>"Should you recognise the face if you saw it again?</p>

  <p>"I can't say," replied Lumley. "You see, it was upside down. I haven't a
  very clear picture of it&mdash;I mean as to what the face would have been
  like the right way up."</p>

  <p>"Was the room quite dark on both occasions?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite. The gas jet in the corridor is just above the door and does
  not any light into the room."</p>

  <p>"And what is there opposite the door?"</p>

  <p>"There is a small window, but that is usually kept shuttered nowadays.
  Under the window is a small folding dressing-table that belonged to Gilbert
  Lumley. He had it made when he came home from sea."</p>

  <p>Thus Lumley was quite lucid and coherent in his answers. His manner was
  perfectly sane; it was only the matter that was abnormal. Of the reality of
  the apparitions he had not the slightest doubt, and he never varied in the
  smallest degree in his description of their appearance. The fact that they
  had been invisible both to Mr. Price and his wife he explained by pointing
  out that the curse applied only to the direct descendants of Gilbert Lumley,
  and to those only in alternate generations.</p>

  <p>After one of our conversations, Thorndyke expressed a wish to see the
  little manuscript book that had been the cause of all the trouble&mdash;or at
  least had been the forerunner; and Lumley promised to bring it to our rooms
  on the following afternoon. But then came an interruption to our holiday, not
  entirely unexpected; an urgent telegram from one of our solicitor friends
  asking consultation on an important and intricate case that had just been put
  into his hands, and making it necessary for us to go up to town by an early
  train on the following morning.</p>

  <p>We sent a note to Brodribb, telling him that we should be away from St.
  David's for perhaps a day or two, and on our way to the station he overtook
  us.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you have had to break your holiday," he said; "but I hope you
  will be back before Thursday."</p>

  <p>"Why Thursday, in particular?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Because Thursday is the day on which that damned head is due to make its
  third appearance. It will be an anxious time. Frank hasn't said anything, but
  I know his nerves are strung up to concert pitch."</p>

  <p>"You must watch him," said Thorndyke. "Don't let him out of your sight if
  you can help it."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," said Brodribb, "but he isn't a child, and I am not
  his keeper. He is the master of the house and I am just his guest. I can't
  follow him about if he wants to be alone."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't stand on politeness, Brodribb," rejoined Thorndyke. "It will
  be a critical time and you must keep him in sight."</p>

  <p>"I shall do my best," Brodribb said anxiously, "but I do hope you will be
  back by then."</p>

  <p>He accompanied us dejectedly to the platform and stayed with us until our
  train came in. Suddenly, just as we were entering our carriage, he thrust his
  hand into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"God bless me!" he exclaimed, "I had nearly forgotten this book. Frank
  asked me to give it to you." As he spoke, he drew out a little rusty
  calf-bound volume and handed it to Thorndyke. "You can look through it at
  your leisure," said he, "and if you think it best to chuck the infernal thing
  out of the window, do so. I suspect poor Frank is none the better for conning
  it over perpetually as he does."</p>

  <p>I thought there was a good deal of reason in Brodribb's opinion. If
  Lumley's illusions were, as I suspected, the result of suggestion produced by
  reading the narrative, that suggestion would certainly tend to be reinforced
  by conning it over and over again. But the old lawyer's proposal was hardly
  practicable.</p>

  <p>As soon as the train had fairly started, Thorndyke proceeded to inspect
  the little volume; and his manner of doing so was highly characteristic. An
  ordinary person would have opened the book and looked through the contents,
  probably seeking out at once the sinister history of Gilbert Lumley.</p>

  <p>Not so Thorndyke. His inspection began at the very beginning and proceeded
  systematically to deal with every fact that the book had to disclose. First
  he made an exhaustive examination of the cover; scrutinised the corners;
  inspected the bottom edges and compared them with the top edges; and compared
  the top and bottom head-caps. Then he brought out his lens and examined the
  tooling, which was simple in character and worked in "blind"&mdash;i.e. not
  gilt. He also inspected the head-bands through the glass, and then he turned
  his attention to the interior. He looked carefully at both end-papers, he
  opened the sections and examined the sewing-thread, he held the leaves up to
  the light and tested the paper by eye and by touch and he viewed the writing
  in several places through his lens. Finally he handed the book and the lens
  to me without remark.</p>

  <p>It was a quaint little volume, with a curiously antique air, though it was
  but a century old. The cover was of rusty calf, a good deal rubbed, but not
  in bad condition; for the joints were perfectly sound; but then it had
  probably had comparatively little use. The paper&mdash;a laid paper with very
  distinct wire-lines but no watermark&mdash;had turned with age to a pale,
  creamy buff; the writing had faded to a warm brown, but was easily legible
  and very clearly and carefully written. Having noted these points, I turned
  over the leaves until I came to the story of Gilbert Lumley and the ill-fated
  Glynn, which I read through attentively, observing that Mr. Brodribb's notes
  had given the whole substance of the narrative with singular
  completeness.</p>

  <p>"This story," I said, as I handed the book back to Thorndyke, "strikes me
  as rather unreal and unconvincing. One doesn't see how Walter Lumley got his
  information."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Thorndyke. "It is on the plane of fiction. The narrator
  speaks in the manner of a novelist with complete knowledge of events and
  actions which were apparently known only to the actors."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it possible that Walter Lumley was simply romancing?"</p>

  <p>"I think it quite possible, and in fact very probable that the whole
  narrative is fictitious," he replied. "We shall have to go into that question
  later on. For the present, I suppose, we had better give our attention to the
  case that we have in hand at the moment."</p>

  <p>The little volume was accordingly put away, and for the rest of the
  journey our conversation was occupied with the matter of the consultation
  that formed our immediate business. As this, however, had no connection with
  the present history, I need make no further reference to it beyond stating
  that it kept us both busy for three days and that we finished with it on the
  evening of the third.</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to go down to St. David's to-night or to-morrow?" I asked,
  as we let ourselves into our chambers.</p>

  <p>"To-night," replied Thorndyke. "This is Thursday, you know, and Brodribb
  was anxious that we should be back some time to-day. I have sent him a
  telegram saying that we shall go down by the train that arrives about ten
  o'clock. So if he wants us, he can meet us it the station or send a
  message."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said I, "if the apparition of Glynn's head will make its
  expected visitation to-night."</p>

  <p>"It probably will if there is an opportunity," Thorndyke replied. "But I
  hope that Brodribb will manage to prevent the opportunity from occurring.
  And, talking of Lumley, as we have an hour to spare, we may as well finish
  our inspection of his book. I snipped off a corner of one of the leaves and
  gave it to Polton to boil up in weak caustic soda. It will be ready for
  examination by now."</p>

  <p>"You don't suspect that the book has been faked, do you?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I view that book with the deepest suspicion," he replied, opening a
  drawer and producing the little volume. "Just look at it, Jervis. Look at the
  cover, for instance."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, turning the book over in my hand, "the cover looks ancient
  enough to me; typical old, rusty calf with a century's wear on it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's no doubt that it is old calf," said he; "just the sort of
  leather that you could skin off the cover of an old quarto or folio. But
  don't you see that the signs of wear are all in the wrong places? How does a
  book wear in use? Well, first there are the bottom edges, which rub on the
  shelf. Then the corners, which are the thinnest leather and the most exposed.
  Then the top head-cap, which the finger hooks into in pulling the book from
  the shelf. Then the joint or hinge, which wears through from frequent opening
  and shutting. The sides get the least wear of all. But in this book, the
  bottom edges, the corners, the top head-cap and the joints are perfectly
  sound. They are not more worn than the sides; and the tooling is modern in
  character. It looks quite fresh and the tool-marks are impressed on the marks
  of wear instead of being themselves worn. The appearances suggest to me a new
  binding with old leather.</p>

  <p>"Then look at the paper. It professes to be discoloured by age. But the
  discoloration of the leaves of an old book occurs principally at the edges,
  where the paper has become oxidised by exposure to the air. The leaves of
  this book are equally discoloured all over. To me they suggest a bath of weak
  tea rather than old age.</p>

  <p>"Again, there is the writing. Its appearance is that of faded writing done
  with the old-fashioned writing ink&mdash;made with iron sulphate and
  oak-galls. But it doesn't look quite the right colour. However, we can easily
  test that. If it is old iron-gall ink, a drop of ammonium sulphide will turn
  it black. Let us take the book up to the laboratory and try it&mdash;and we
  had better have a "control" to compare it with."</p>

  <p>He ran his eye along the book-shelves and took down a rusty-looking volume
  of Humphry Clinker, the end-paper of which bore several brown and faded
  signatures.</p>

  <p>"Here is a signature dated 1803," said he. "That will be near enough;" and
  with the two books in his hand he led the way upstairs to the laboratory.
  Here he took down the ammonium sulphide bottle, and dipping up a little of
  the liquid in a fine glass tube, opened the cover of Humphry Clinker and
  carefully deposited a tiny drop on the figure 3 in the date. Almost
  immediately the ghostly brown began to darken until it at length became jet
  black. Then, in the same way, he opened Walter Lumley's manuscript book and
  on the 9th of the date, 1819, he deposited a drop of the solution. But this
  time there was no darkening of the pale brown writing; on the contrary, it
  faded rapidly to a faint and muddy violet.</p>

  <p>"It is not an iron ink," said Thorndyke, "and it looks suspiciously like
  an aniline brown. But let us see what the paper is made of. Have you boiled
  up that fragment, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered our laboratory assistant, "and I've washed the soda
  out of it, so it's all ready."</p>

  <p>He produced a labelled test-tube containing a tiny corner of paper
  floating in water, which he carefully emptied into a large watch-glass. From
  this Thorndyke transferred the little pulpy fragment to a microscope slide
  and, with a pair of mounted needles, broke it up into its constituent fibres.
  Then he dropped on it a drop of aniline stain, removed the surplus with
  blotting-paper, added a drop of glycerine and put on it a large
  cover-slip.</p>

  <p>"There, Jervis," said he, handing me the slide, "let us have your opinion
  on Walter Lumley's paper."</p>

  <p>I placed the slide on the stage of the microscope and proceeded to inspect
  the specimen. But no exhaustive examination was necessary. The first glance
  settled the matter.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly all wood," I said. "Mechanical wood fibre, with some
  esparto, a little cotton and a few linen fibres."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "it is a modern paper. Mechanical
  wood-pulp&mdash;prepared by Keller's process&mdash;was first used in
  paper-making in 1840. 'Chemical wood-pulp' came in later; and esparto was not
  used until 1860. So we can say with confidence that this paper was not made
  until more than twenty years after the date that is written on it. Probably
  it is of quite recent manufacture."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said I, "this book is a counterfeit&mdash;presumably
  fraudulent."</p>

  <p>"Yes. In effect it is a forgery."</p>

  <p>"But that seems to suggest a conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed; "especially if it is considered in
  conjunction with the apparitions. The suggestion is that this book was
  prepared for the purpose of inducing a state of mind favourable to the
  acceptance of supernatural appearances. The obvious inference is that the
  apparitions themselves were an imposture produced for fraudulent purposes.
  But it is time for us to go."</p>

  <p>We shook hands with Polton, and, having collected our suit-cases from the
  sitting-room, set forth for the station.</p>

  <p>During the journey down I reflected on the new turn that Frank Lumley's
  affairs had taken. Apparently, Brodribb had done his client an injustice.
  Lumley was not so mad as the old lawyer had supposed. He was merely credulous
  and highly suggestible. The "hallucinations" were real phenomena which he had
  simply misinterpreted. But who was behind these sham illusions? And what was
  it all about? I tried to open the question with Thorndyke; but though he was
  willing to discuss the sham manuscript book and the technique of its
  production, he would commit himself to nothing further.</p>

  <p>On our arrival at St. David's, Thorndyke looked up and down the platform
  and again up the station approach. "No sign of Brodribb or any messenger," he
  remarked, "so we may assume that all is well at Burling Court up to the
  present. Let us hope that Brodribb's presence has had an inhibitory effect on
  the apparitions."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was evident that he was not quite easy in his mind.
  During supper he appeared watchful and preoccupied, and when, after the meal,
  he proposed a stroll down to the beach, he left word with our landlady as to
  where he was to be found if he should be wanted.</p>

  <p>It was about a quarter to eleven when we arrived at the shore, and the
  tide was beginning to run out. The beach was deserted with the exception of a
  couple of fishermen who had apparently come in with the tide and who were
  making their boat secure for the night before going home. Thorndyke
  approached them, and addressing the older fisherman, remarked: "That is a
  big, powerful boat. Pretty fast, too, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, sir," was the reply; "fast and weatherly, she is. What we calls a
  galley-punt. Built at Deal for the hovelling trade&mdash;salvage, you know,
  sir&mdash;but there ain't no hovelling nowadays, not to speak of."</p>

  <p>"Are you going out to-morrow?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Not as I knows of, sir. Was you thinking of a bit of fishing?"</p>

  <p>"If you are free," said Thorndyke, "I should like to charter the boat for
  to-morrow. I don't know what time I shall be able to start, but if you will
  stand by ready to put off at once when I come down we can count the waiting
  as sailing."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," said the fisherman; "the boat's yours for the day
  to-morrow. Any time after six, or earlier, if you like, if you come down here
  you'll find me and my mate standing by with a stock of bait and the boat
  ready to push off."</p>

  <p>"That will do admirably," said Thorndyke; and the morrow's programme being
  thus settled, we wished the fishermen good-night and walked slowly back to
  our lodgings, where, after a final pipe, we turned in.</p>

  <p>On the following morning, just as we were finishing a rather leisurely
  breakfast, we saw from our window our friend Mr. Brodribb hurrying down the
  street towards our house. I ran out and opened the door, and as he entered I
  conducted him into our sitting-room. From his anxious and flustered manner it
  was obvious that something had gone wrong, and his first words confirmed the
  sinister impression.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we're in for trouble, Thorndyke," said he. "Frank is
  missing."</p>

  <p>"Since when?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Since about eight o'clock this morning. He is nowhere about the house and
  he hasn't had any breakfast."</p>

  <p>"When was he last seen?" Thorndyke asked. "And where?"</p>

  <p>"About eight o'clock, in the breakfast-room. Apparently he went in there
  to say "good-bye" to the Prices&mdash;they have gone on a visit for the day
  to Folkestone and were having an early breakfast so as to catch the
  eight-thirty train. But he didn't have breakfast with them. He just went in
  and wished them a pleasant journey and then it appears that he went out for a
  stroll in the grounds. When I came down to breakfast at half-past eight, the
  Prices had gone and Frank hadn't come in. The maid sounded the gong, and as
  Frank still did not appear, she went out into the grounds to look for him;
  and presently I went out myself. But he wasn't there and he wasn't anywhere
  in the house. I don't like the look of it at all. He is usually very regular
  and punctual at meals. What do you think we had better do, Thorndyke?"</p>

  <p>My colleague looked at his watch and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"I think, Brodribb," said he, "that we must act on the obvious
  probabilities and provide against the one great danger that is known to us.
  Mrs. Robinson," he added, addressing the landlady, who, had answered the bell
  in person, "can you let us have a jug of strong coffee at once?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Robinson could, and bustled away to prepare it, while Thorndyke
  produced from a cupboard a large vacuum flask.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you, Thorndyke," said Mr. Brodribb. "What
  probabilities and what danger do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that, up to the present, Frank Lumley has exactly reproduced in
  his experiences and his actions the experiences and actions of Gilbert Lumley
  as set forth in Walter Lumley's narrative. The overwhelming probability is
  that he will continue to reproduce the story of Gilbert to the end. He
  probably saw the apparition for the third time last night, and is even now
  preparing for the final act."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" gasped Brodribb. "What a fool I am! You mean the cave? But we
  can never get there now. It will be high water in an hour and the beach at
  St. David's Head will be covered already. Unless we can get a boat," he added
  despairingly.</p>

  <p>"We have got a boat," said Thorndyke. "I chartered one last night."</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord!" exclaimed Brodribb. "But you always think of
  everything&mdash;though I don't know what you want that coffee for."</p>

  <p>"We may not want it at all," said Thorndyke, as he poured the coffee,
  which the landlady had just brought, into the vacuum flask, "but on the other
  hand we may."</p>

  <p>He deposited the flask in a hand-bag, in which I observed a small
  emergency-case, and then turned to Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"We had better get down to the beach now," said he.</p>

  <p>As we emerged from the bottom of the gap-way we saw our friends of the
  previous night laying a double line of planks across the beach from the boat
  to the margin of the surf; for the long galley-punt, with her load of
  ballast, was too heavy, over the shingle. They had just got the last plank
  laid as we reached the boat, and as they observed us they came running back
  with half a dozen of their mates.</p>

  <p>"Jump aboard, gentlemen," said our skipper, with a slightly dubious eye on
  Mr. Brodribb&mdash;for the boat's gunwale was a good four feet above the
  beach. "We'll have her afloat in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>We climbed in and hauled Mr. Brodribb in after us. The tall mast was
  already stepped&mdash;against the middle thwart in the odd fashion of
  galley-punts&mdash;and the great sail was hooked to the traveller and the
  tack-hook ready for hoisting. The party of boatmen gathered round and each
  took a tenacious hold of gunwale or thole. The skipper gave time with a
  jovial "Yo-ho!" His mates joined in with a responsive howl and heaved as one
  man. The great boat moved forward, and gathering way, slid swiftly along the
  greased planks towards the edge of the surf. Then her nose splashed into the
  sea; the skipper and his mate sprang in over the transom; the tall lug-sail
  soared up the mast and filled and the skipper let the rudder slide down its
  pintles and grasped the tiller.</p>

  <p>"Did you want to go anywheres in particklar?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"We want to make for the big cave round St. David's Head," said Thorndyke,
  " and we want to get there well before high water."</p>

  <p>"We'll do that easy enough, sir," said the skipper "with this breeze. 'Tis
  but about a mile and we've got three-quarters of an hour to do it in."</p>

  <p>He took a pull at the main sheet and, putting the helm down, brought the
  boat on a course parallel to the coast. Quietly but swiftly the water slipped
  past, one after another fresh headlands opened out till, in about a quarter
  of an hour, we were abreast of St. David's Head with the sinister black shape
  of the cavern in full view over the port bow. Shortly afterwards the sail was
  lowered and our crew, reinforced by Thorndyke and me, took to the oars,
  pulling straight towards the shore with the cavern directly ahead.</p>

  <p>As the boat grounded on the beach Thorndyke, Brodribb and I sprang out and
  hurried across the sand and shingle to the gloomy and forbidding hole in
  white cliff. At first, coming out of the bright sunlight we seemed to be
  plunged in absolute darkness, and groped our way insecurely over the heaps of
  slippery sea-tangle that littered the floor. Presently our eyes grew
  accustomed to the dim light, and we could trace faintly the narrow,
  tunnel-like passage with its slimy green and the jagged roof nearly black
  with age. At the farther end it grew higher; and here I could see the small,
  dark bodies of bats hanging from the roof and clinging to the walls, and one
  or two fluttering blindly and noiselessly like large moths in the hollows of
  the vault above. But it was not the bats that engrossed my attention. Far
  away, at the extreme end, I could dimly discern the prostrate figure of a man
  lying motionless on a patch of smooth sand; a dreadful shape that seemed to
  sound the final note of tragedy to which the darkness, the clammy chill of
  the cavern and the ghostly forms of he bats had been a fitting prelude.</p>

  <p>"My God!" gasped Brodribb, "we're too late!" He broke into a shambling run
  and Thorndyke and I darted on ahead. The man was Frank Lumley, of course, and
  a glance at him gave us at least a ray of hope. He was lying in an easy
  posture with closed eyes and was still breathing, though his respiration was
  shallow and slow. Beside him on the sand lay a little bottle and near it a
  cork. I picked up the former and read on the label "Laudanum: Poison" and a
  local druggist's name and address. But it was empty save for a few drops, the
  appearance and smell of which confirmed the label.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke, who had been examining the unconscious man's eyes with a little
  electric lamp, glanced at the bottle.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "we know the worst. That is a two-drachm phial, so if he
  took the lot his condition is not hopeless."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he opened the hand-bag, and taking out the emergency-case,
  produced from it a hypodermic syringe and a tiny bottle of atropine solution.
  I drew up Lumley's sleeve while the syringe was filled and Thorndyke then
  administered the injection.</p>

  <p>"It is opium poisoning, I suppose?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the answer. "His pupils are like pin points; but his pulse is
  not so bad. I think we can safely move him down to the boat."</p>

  <p>Thereupon we lifted him, and with Brodribb supporting his feet, we moved
  in melancholy procession down the cave. Already the waves were lapping the
  beach at the entrance and even trickling in amongst the seaweed; and the
  boat, following the rising tide, had her bows within the cavern. The two
  fishermen, who were steadying the boat with their oars, greeted our
  appearance, carrying the body, with exclamations of astonishment. But they
  asked no questions, simply taking the unconscious man from us and laying him
  gently on the grating in the stern-sheets.</p>

  <p>"Why, 'tis Mr. Lumley!" exclaimed the skipper.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; and having given them a few words of explanation,
  he added: "I look to you to keep this affair to yourselves."</p>

  <p>To this the two men agreed heartily, and the boat having been pushed off
  and the sail hoisted, the skipper asked: "Do we sail straight back, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "but we won't land yet. Stand on and off
  opposite the gap-way."</p>

  <p>Already, as a result of the movement, the patient's stupor appeared less
  profound. And now Thorndyke took definite measures to rouse him, shaking him
  gently and constantly changing his position. Presently Lumley drew a deep
  sighing breath, and opened his eyes for a moment. Then Thorndyke sat him up,
  and producing the vacuum-flask, made him swallow a few teaspoonful of coffee.
  This procedure was continued for over an hour while the boat cruised up and
  down opposite the landing-place half a mile or so from the shore. Constantly
  our patient relapsed into stuporous sleep, only to be roused again and given
  a sip of coffee.</p>

  <p>At length he recovered so far as to be able to sit up&mdash;lurching from
  side to side as the boat rolled&mdash;and drowsily answer questions spoken
  loudly in his ears. A quarter of an hour later, as he still continued to
  improve, Thorndyke ordered the skipper to bring the boat to the
  landing-place.</p>

  <p>"I think he could walk now," said he, "and the exercise will rouse him
  more completely."</p>

  <p>The boat was accordingly beached and Lumley assisted to climb out; and
  though at first he staggered as if he would fall, after a few paces he was
  able to walk fairly steadily, supported on either side by me and Thorndyke.
  The effort of ascending the steep gap-way revived him further; and by the
  time we reached the gate of Burling Court&mdash;half a mile across the
  fields&mdash;he was almost able to stand alone.</p>

  <p>But even when he had arrived home he was not allowed to rest, earnestly as
  he begged to be left in peace. First Thorndyke insisted on his taking a light
  meal, and then proceeded to question him as to the events of the previous
  night.</p>

  <p>"I presume, Lumley," said he, "that you saw the apparition of Glynn's
  head?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. After Mr. Brodribb had seen me to bed, I got up and went to
  Gilbert's cabin. Something seemed to draw me to it. And as soon as I opened
  the door, there was the head hanging in the air within three feet of me. Then
  I knew that Glynn was calling me, and&mdash;well, you know the rest."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Thorndyke. "But now I want you to come to Gilbert's
  cabin with me and show me exactly where you were and where the head was."</p>

  <p>Lumley was profoundly reluctant and tried to postpone the demonstration.
  But Thorndyke would listen to no refusal, and at last Lumley rose wearily and
  conducted his tormentor up the stairs, followed by Brodribb and me.</p>

  <p>We went first to Lumley's bedroom and from that into a corridor, into
  which some other bedrooms opened. The corridor was dimly lighted by a single
  window, and when Thorndyke had drawn the thick curtain over this, the place
  was almost completely dark. At one end of the corridor was the small, narrow
  door of the "cabin," over which was a gas bracket. Thorndyke lighted the gas
  and opened the door and we then saw that the room was in total darkness, its
  only window being closely shuttered and the curtains drawn. Thorndyke struck
  a match and lit the gas and we then looked curiously about the little
  room.</p>

  <p>It was a quaint little apartment, to which its antique furniture and
  contents gave an old-world air. An ancient hanger, quadrant and spy-glass
  hung on the wall, a large, dropsical-looking watch, inscribed "Thomas
  Tompion, Londini fecit," reposed on a little velvet cushion in the middle of
  a small, black mahogany table by the window, and a couple of Cromwellian
  chairs stood against the wall. Thorndyke looked curiously at the table, which
  was raised on wooden blocks, and Lumley explained: "That was Gilbert's
  dressing-table. He had it made for his cabin on board ship."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Thorndyke. "Then Gilbert was a rather up-to-date gentleman.
  There wasn't much mahogany furniture before 1720. Let us have a look I at the
  interior arrangements."</p>

  <p>He lifted the watch, and having placed it on a chair, raised the lid of
  the table, disclosing a small wash basin, a little squat ewer and other
  toilet appliances. The table lid, which was held upright by a brass strut,
  held a rather large dressing-mirror enclosed in a projecting case.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said I, "why the table was stood on those blocks."</p>

  <p>"Apparently," said Thorndyke, "for the purpose of bringing the mirror to
  the eye-level of a person standing up."</p>

  <p>The answer gave Brodribb an idea. "I suppose, Frank," said he, "it was not
  your own reflection in the mirror that you saw?"</p>

  <p>"How could it be?" demanded Lumley. "The head was upside down, and
  besides, it was quite near to me."</p>

  <p>"No, that's true," said Brodribb; and turning away from the table he
  picked up the old navigator's watch. "A queer old timepiece, this," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lumley; "but it's beautifully made. Let me show you the
  inside."</p>

  <p>He took off the outer case and opened the inner one, exhibiting the
  delicate workmanship of the interior to Brodribb and me, while Thorndyke
  continued to pore over the inner fittings of the table. Suddenly my colleague
  said: "Just go outside, you three, and shut the door. I want to try an
  experiment."</p>

  <p>Obediently we all filed out and closed the door, waiting expectantly in
  the corridor. In a couple of minutes Thorndyke came out and before he shut
  the door I noticed that the little room was now in darkness. He walked us a
  short distance down the corridor and then, halting, said:</p>

  <p>"Now, Lumley, I want you to go into the cabin and tell us what you
  see."</p>

  <p>Lumley appeared a little reluctant to go in alone, but eventually he
  walked towards the cabin and opened the door. Instantly he uttered a cry of
  horror, and closing the door, ran back to us, trembling, agitated,
  wild-eyed.</p>

  <p>"It is there now!" he exclaimed. "I saw it distinctly."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "Now you go and look, Brodribb."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brodribb showed no eagerness. With very obvious trepidation he
  advanced to the door and threw it open with a jerk. Then, with a sharp
  exclamation, he slammed it to, and came hurrying back, his usually pink
  complexion paled down to a delicate mauve.</p>

  <p>"Horrible! Horrible!" he exclaimed. "What the devil is it, Thorndyke?"</p>

  <p>A sudden suspicion flashed into my mind. I strode forward, and turning the
  handle of the door, pulled it open. And then I was not surprised that
  Brodribb had been startled. Within a yard of my face, clear, distinct and
  solid, was an inverted head, floating in mid-air in the pitch-dark room. Of
  course, being prepared for it, I saw at a glance what it was; recognised my
  own features, strangely and horribly altered as they were by their inverted
  position. But even now that I knew what it was, the thing had a most
  appalling, uncanny aspect.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Thorndyke, "let us go in and explode the mystery. Just stand
  outside the door, Jervis, while I demonstrate."</p>

  <p>He produced a sheet of white paper from his pocket, and smoothing it out,
  let our two friends into the room.</p>

  <p>First," said he, holding the paper out flat at the eye-level, "you see on
  this paper a picture of Dr. Jervis's head upside down."</p>

  <p>"So there is," said Brodribb; "like a magic-lantern picture."</p>

  <p>"Exactly like," agreed Thorndyke; "and of exactly the same nature. Now let
  us see how it is produced."</p>

  <p>He struck a match and lit the gas; and instantly all our eyes turned
  towards the open dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"But that is not the same mirror that we saw just now," said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "The frame is reversible on a sliding hinge and I
  have turned it round. On one side is the ordinary flat looking-glass which
  you saw before; on the other is this concave shaving-mirror. You observe
  that, if you stand close to it, you see your face the right way up and
  magnified; if you go back to the door, you see your head upside down and
  smaller."</p>

  <p>"But," objected Lumley, "the head looked quite solid and seemed to be
  right out in the room."</p>

  <p>"So it was, and is still. But the effect of reality is destroyed by the
  fact that you can now see the frame of the mirror enclosing the image, so
  that the head appears to be in the mirror. But in the dark, you could only
  see the image. The mirror was invisible."</p>

  <p>Brodribb reflected on this explanation. Presently he said: "I don't think
  I quite understand it now."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took a pencil from his pocket and began to draw a diagram on the
  sheet of paper that he still held.</p>

  <p><img alt=""
       src="1402971h-images/PuzzleLock-3.gif"></p>

  <p>"The figure that you see in an ordinary flat looking glass," he explained,
  "is what is called a 'virtual image.' It appears to be behind the mirror, but
  of course it is not there. It is an optical illusion. But the image from a
  concave mirror is in front of the mirror and is a real image like that of a
  magic-lantern or a camera, and, like them, inverted. This diagram will
  explain matters. Here is Lumley standing at the open door of the room. His
  figure is well lighted by the gas over the door (which, however, throws no
  light into the room) and is clearly reflected by the mirror, which throws
  forward a bright inverted image. But, as the room is dark and the mirror
  invisible, he sees only the image, which looks like&mdash;and in fact
  is&mdash;a real object standing in mid-air."</p>

  <p>"But why did I see only the head?" asked Lumley.</p>

  <p>"Because the head occupied the whole of the mirror. If the mirror had been
  large enough you would have seen the full-length figure."</p>

  <p>Lumley reflected for a moment. "It almost looks if this had been
  arranged," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"Of course it has been arranged," said Thorndyke "and very cleverly
  arranged, too. And now let us go and see if anything else has been arranged.
  Which is Mr. Price's room?"</p>

  <p>"He has three rooms, which open out of this corridor," said Lumley; and he
  conducted us to a door at the farther end, which Thorndyke tried and found
  locked.</p>

  <p>"It is a case for the smoker's companion," said he, producing from his
  pocket an instrument that went by that name, but which looked suspiciously
  like a lock-pick. At any rate, after one or two trials&mdash;which Mr
  Brodribb watched with an appreciative smile&mdash;the bolt shot back and the
  door opened.</p>

  <p>We entered what was evidently the bedroom, around which Thorndyke cast a
  rapid glance and then asked: "What are the other rooms?"</p>

  <p>"I think he uses them to tinker in," said Lumley, "but I don't quite know
  what he does in them. All three rooms communicate."</p>

  <p>We advanced to the door of communication and, finding it unlocked, passed
  through into the next room. Here, on a large table by the window, was a
  litter of various tools and appliances.</p>

  <p>"What is that thing with the wooden screws?" Brodribb asked.</p>

  <p>"A bookbinder's sewing-press," replied Thorndyke. "And here are some boxes
  of finishing tools. Let us look over them."</p>

  <p>He took up the boxes one after the other and inspected the ends of the
  tools&mdash;brass stamps for impressing the ornaments on book covers.
  Presently he lifted out two, a leaf and a flower. Then he produced from his
  coat pocket the little manuscript book, and laying it on the table, picked up
  from the floor a little fragment of leather. Placing this also on the table,
  he pressed two of the tools on it, leaving a clear impression of a leaf and a
  flower. Finally he laid the scrap of leather on the book, when it was obvious
  that the leaf and flower were identical replicas of the leaves and flowers
  which formed the decoration of the book cover.</p>

  <p>"This is very curious," said Lumley. "They seem to be exactly alike."</p>

  <p>"They are exactly alike," said Thorndyke. "I affirm that the tooling on
  that book was done with these tools, and the leaves sewn on that press."</p>

  <p>"But the book is a hundred years old," objected Lumley.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "The leather is old," said he, "but the book is
  new. We have tested the paper and found it to be of recent manufacture. But
  now let us see what is in that little cupboard. There seem to be some bottles
  there."</p>

  <p>He ran his eye along the shelves, crowded with bottles and jars of
  varnish, glair, oil, cement and other material.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said, taking down a small bottle of dark-coloured powder, "is
  some aniline brown. That probably produced the ancient and faded writing. But
  this is more illuminating&mdash;in more senses than one." He picked out a
  little, wide-mouthed bottle labelled "Radium Paint for the hands and figures
  of luminous watches."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Brodribb; "a very illuminating discovery, as you say."</p>

  <p>"And that," said Thorndyke, looking keenly round the room, "seems to be
  all there is here. Shall we take a glance at the third room?"</p>

  <p>We passed through the communicating doorway and found ourselves in a small
  apartment practically unfurnished and littered with trunks, bags and various
  lumber. As we stood looking about us, Thorndyke sniffed suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I seem to detect a sort of mousy odour," said he, glancing round
  inquisitively. "Do you notice it, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>I did; and with the obvious idea in my mind began I to prowl round the
  room in search of the source, Suddenly my eye lighted on a smallish box, in
  the top of which a number of gimlet-holes had been bored. I raised the lid
  and peered in. The interior was covered with filth and on the bottom lay a
  dead bat.</p>

  <p>We all stood for a few seconds looking in silence at the little corpse.
  Then Thorndyke closed the box and tucked it under his arm.</p>

  <p>"This completes the case, I think," said he. "What time does Price
  return?"</p>

  <p>"He is expected home about seven o'clock," said Lumley. Then he added with
  a troubled expression: "I don't understand all this. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"It is very simple," replied Thorndyke. "You have a sham ancient book
  containing an evidently fabulous story of supernatural events; and you have a
  series of appliances and arrangements for producing illusions which seem to
  repeat those events. The book was planted where it was certain to be found
  and read, and the illusions began after it was known that it actually had
  been read. It is a conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"But why?" demanded Lumley. "What was the object?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Frank," said Brodribb, "you seem forget that Price is the next of
  kin and the heir to your estate on your death."</p>

  <p>Lumley's eyes filled. He seemed overcome with grief and disgust. "It is
  incredible," he murmured huskily. "The baseness of it is beyond belief."</p>

  <p>Price and his wife arrived home at about seven o'clock, A meal had been
  prepared for them, and when they had finished, a servant was sent in to ask
  Mr. Price to speak with Mr. Brodribb in the study. There we all awaited him,
  Lumley being present by his own wish; and on the table were deposited the
  little book, the scrap of leather, the two finishing tools, the pot of radium
  paint and the box containing the dead bat. Presently Price entered,
  accompanied by his wife; and at the sight of the objects on the table they
  both turned deathly pale. Mr. Brodribb placed chairs for them, and when they
  were seated he began in a dry, stern voice:</p>

  <p>"I have sent for you, Mr. Price, to give you certain information. These
  two gentlemen, Dr. Thorndyke and Dr. Jervis, are eminent criminal lawyers
  whom I have commissioned to make investigations and to advise me in this
  matter. Their investigations have disclosed the existence of a forged
  manuscript, a dead bat, a pot of luminous paint and a concave mirror. I need
  not enlarge on those discoveries. My intention is to prosecute you and your
  wife for conspiracy to procure the suicide of Mr. Frank Lumley. But, at Mr.
  Lumley's request, I have consented to delay the proceedings for forty-eight
  hours. During that period you will be at liberty to act as you think
  best."</p>

  <p>For some seconds there was a tense silence. The two crestfallen
  conspirators sat with their eyes fixed on the floor, and Mrs. Price choked
  down a half-hysterical sob. Then they rose; and Price, without looking at any
  of us, said in a low voice: "Very well. Then I suppose we had better clear
  out."</p>

  <p>"And the best thing, too," remarked Brodribb, when they had gone; "for I
  doubt if we could have carried our bluff into court."</p>

  <p>On the wall of our sitting-room in the Temple there hang, to this day, two
  keys. One is that of the postern gate of Burling Court, and the other belongs
  to the suite of rooms that were once occupied by Mr. Lewis Price; and they
  hang there, by Frank Lumley's wish, as a token that Burling Court is a
  country home to which we have access at all hours and seasons as tenants in
  virtue of an inalienable right.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="c9"
     id="c9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR</h2>

  <p class="first">"SO," said Thorndyke, looking at me reflectively, "you are a
  full-blown medical practitioner with a practice of your own. How the years
  slip by! It seems but the other day that you were a student, gaping at me
  from the front bench of the lecture theatre."</p>

  <p>"Did I gape?" I asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I use the word metaphorically," said he, "to denote ostentatious
  attention. You always took my lecture very seriously. May I ask if you have
  ever found them of use in your practice?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I have ever had any very thrilling medico-legal
  experiences since that extraordinary cremation case that you
  investigated&mdash;the case of Septimus Maddock, you know. But that reminds
  me that there is a little matter that I meant to speak to you about. It is of
  no interest, but I just wanted your advice, though it isn't even my business,
  strictly speaking. It concerns a patient of mine, a man named Crofton, who
  has disappeared rather unaccountably."</p>

  <p>"And do you call that a case of no medico-legal interest?" demanded
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's nothing in it. He just went away for a holiday and he hasn't
  communicated with his friends very recently. That is all. What makes me a
  little uneasy is that there is a departure from his usual habits&mdash;he is
  generally a fairly regular correspondent&mdash;that seems a little
  significant in view of his personality. He is markedly neurotic and his
  family history is by no means what one would wish."</p>

  <p>"That is an admirable thumb-nail sketch, Jardine," said Thorndyke "but it
  lacks detail. Let us have a full-size picture."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I, "but you mustn't let me bore you. To begin with
  Crofton: he is a nervous, anxious, worrying sort of fellow, everlastingly
  fussing about money affairs, and latterly this tendency has been getting
  worse. He fairly got the jumps about his financial position; felt that he was
  steadily drifting into bankruptcy and couldn't get that out of his mind. It
  was all bunkum. I am more or less a friend of the family, and I know that
  there was nothing to worry about. Mrs. Crofton assured me that, although they
  were a trifle hard up, they could rub along quite safely.</p>

  <p>"As he seemed to be getting the hump worse and worse, I advised him to go
  away for a change and stay in a boarding-house where he would see some fresh
  faces. Instead of that, he elected to go down to a bungalow that he has at
  Seasalter, near Whitstable, and lets out in the season. He proposed to stay
  by himself and spend his time in sea-bathing and country walks. I wasn't very
  keen on this, for solitude was the last thing that he wanted. There was a
  strong family history of melancholia and some unpleasant rumours of suicide.
  I didn't like his being alone at all. However, another friend of the family,
  Mrs. Crofton's brother in fact, a chap named Ambrose, offered to go down and
  spend a week-end with him to give him a start, and afterwards to run down for
  an afternoon whenever he was able. So off he went with Ambrose on Friday, the
  sixteenth of June, and for a time all went well. He seemed to be improving in
  health and spirits and wrote to his wife regularly two or three times a week.
  Ambrose went down as often as he could to cheer him up, and the last time
  brought back the news that Crofton thought of moving on to Margate for a
  further change. So, of course, he didn't go down to the bungalow again.</p>

  <p>"Well, in due course, a letter came from Margate; it had been written at
  the bungalow, but the postmark was Margate and bore the same date&mdash;the
  sixteenth of July&mdash;as the letter itself. I have it with me. Mrs. Crofton
  sent it for me to see and I haven't returned it yet. But there is nothing of
  interest in it beyond the statement that he was going on to Margate by the
  next train and would write again when he had found rooms there. That was the
  last that was heard of him. He never wrote and nothing is known of his
  movements excepting that he left Seasalter and arrived at Margate. This is
  the letter."</p>

  <p>I handed it to Thorndyke, who glanced at the mark and then laid it on the
  table for examination later. "Have any inquiries been made?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. His photograph has been sent to the Margate police, but, of
  course&mdash;well, you know what Margate like in July. Thousands of strangers
  coming and going every day. It is hopeless to look for him in that crowd and
  it is quite possible that he isn't there now. But his disappearance is most
  inopportune, for a big legacy hats just fallen in, and, naturally, Mrs.
  Crofton is frantically anxious to let him know. It is a matter of about
  thirty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Was this legacy expected?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No. The Croftons knew nothing about it. They didn't know that the old
  lady&mdash;Miss Shuler&mdash;had made a will or that she had very much to
  leave; and they didn't know that she was likely to die, or even that she was
  ill. Which is rather odd; for she was ill for a month or two and, as she
  suffered from a malignant abdominal tumour, it was known that she couldn't
  recover."</p>

  <p>"When did she die?"</p>

  <p>"On the thirteenth of July."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke raised his eyebrows. "Just three days before the date of this
  letter," he remarked; "so that if he should never reappear, this letter will
  be the sole evidence that he survived her. It is an important document. It
  may come to represent a value of a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"It isn't so important as it looks," said I. "Miss Shuler's will provides
  that if Crofton should die before the estatrix, the legacy should go to his
  wife. So whether he is alive or not, the legacy is quite safe. But we must
  hope that he is alive, though I must confess to some little anxiety on his
  account."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected a while on this statement. Presently he asked: "Do you
  know if Crofton has made a will?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has," I replied; "quite recently. I was one of the witnesses and
  I read it through at Crofton's request. It was full of the usual legal
  verbiage, but it might have been stated in a dozen words. He leaves
  practically everything to his wife, but instead of saying so it enumerates
  the property item by item."</p>

  <p>"It was drafted, I suppose, by the solicitor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; another friend of the family named Jobson, and he is the executor
  and residuary legatee."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded and again became deeply reflective. Still meditating, he
  took up the letter, and as he inspected it, I watched him curiously and not
  without a certain secret amusement. First he looked over the envelope, back
  and front. Then he took from his pocket a powerful Coddington lens and with
  this examined the flap and the postmark. Next, he drew out the letter, held
  it up to the light, then read it through and finally examined various parts
  of the writing through his lens. "Well," I asked, with an irreverent grin, "I
  should think you have extracted the last grain of meaning from it."</p>

  <p>He smiled as he put away his lens and handed the letter back to me.</p>

  <p>"As this may have to be produced in proof of survival," said he, "it had
  better be put in a place of safety. I notice that he speaks of returning
  later to the bungalow. I take it that it has been ascertained that he did not
  return there?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. You see, they have been waiting for him to write. You
  think that someone ought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I paused; for it began to be borne in on me that Thorndyke was taking a
  somewhat gloomy view of the case.</p>

  <p>"My dear Jardine," said he, "I am merely following your own suggestion.
  Here is a man with an inherited tendency to melancholia and suicide who has
  suddenly disappeared. He went away from an empty house and announced his
  intention of returning to it later. As that house is the only known locality
  in which he could be sought, it is obvious that it ought to have been
  examined. And even if he never came back there, the house might contain some
  clues to his present whereabouts."</p>

  <p>This last sentence put an idea into my mind which I was a little shy of
  broaching. What was a clue to Thorndyke might be perfectly meaningless to an
  ordinary person. I recalled his amazing interpretations of most commonplace
  facts in the mysterious Maddock case and the idea took fuller possession. At
  length I said tentatively: "I would go down myself if I felt competent.
  To-morrow is Saturday, and I could get a colleague to look after my practice;
  there isn't much doing just now. But when you speak of clues, and when I
  remember what duffer I was last time&mdash;I wish it were possible for you to
  have a look at the place."</p>

  <p>To my surprise, he assented almost with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said he. "It is a week-end. We can put up at the bungalow, I
  suppose, and have a little gipsy holiday. And there are undoubtedly points of
  interest in the case. Let us go down to-morrow. We can lunch in the train and
  have the afternoon before us. You had better get a key from Mrs. Crofton, or,
  if she hasn't got one, an authority to visit the house. We may want that if
  we have to enter without a key. And we go alone, of course."</p>

  <p>I assented joyfully. Not that I had any expectations as to what we might
  learn from our inspection. But something in Thorndyke's manner gave me the
  impression that he had extracted from my account of the case some
  significance that was not apparent to me.</p>

  <p>The bungalow stood on a space of rough ground a little way behind the
  sea-wall, along which we walked towards it from Whitstable, passing on our
  way a ship-builder's yard and a slipway, on which a collier brigantine was
  hauled up for repairs. There were one or two other bungalows adjacent, but a
  considerable distance apart, and we looked at them as we approached to make
  out the names painted on the gates.</p>

  <p>"That will probably be the one," said Thorndyke, indicating a small
  building enclosed within a wooden fence and provided, like the others, with a
  bathing hut just above high-water mark. Its solitary, deserted aspect and
  lowered blinds supported his opinion, and when we reached the gate, the name
  "Middlewick" painted on it settled the matter.</p>

  <p>"The next question is," said I, "how the deuce we are going to get in? The
  gate is locked, and there is no bell. Is it worth while to hammer at the
  fence?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't do that," replied Thorndyke. "The place is pretty certainly
  empty or the gate wouldn't be locked. We shall have to climb over unless
  there is a back gate unlocked, so the less noise we make the better."</p>

  <p>We walked round the enclosure, but there was no other gate, nor was there
  any tree or other cover to disguise our rather suspicious proceedings.</p>

  <p>"There's no help for it, Jardine," said Thorndyke, "so here goes."</p>

  <p>He put his green canvas suit-case on the ground, grasped the top of the
  fence with both hands and went over like a harlequin. I picked up the case
  and handed it over to him, and, having taken a quick glance round, followed
  my leader.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "here we are. And now, how are we to get into the
  house?"</p>

  <p>"We shall have to pick a lock if there is no door open, or else go in by a
  window. Let us take a look round."&mdash;We walked round the house to the
  back door, but found it not only locked, but bolted top and bottom, as
  Thorndyke ascertained with his knifeblade. The windows were all casements and
  all fastened with their catches.</p>

  <p>"The front door will be the best," said Thorndyke. "It can't be bolted
  unless he got out by the chimney and I think my 'smoker's companion' will be
  able to cope with an ordinary door-lock. It looked like a common builder's
  fitting."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, we returned to the front of the house and he produced the
  'smoker's companion' from his pocket (I don't know what kind of smoker it was
  designed to accompany). The lock was apparently a simple affair, for the
  second trial with the 'companion' shot back the bolt, and when I turned the
  handle, the door opened. As a precaution, I called out to inquire if there
  was anybody within, and then, as there was no answer, we entered, walking
  straight into the living-room, as there was no hall or lobby.</p>

  <p>A couple of paces from the threshold we halted to look round the room, and
  on me the aspect of the place produced a vague sense of discomfort. Though it
  was early in a bright afternoon, the room was almost completely dark, for not
  only were the blinds lowered, but the curtains were drawn as well.</p>

  <p>"It looks," said I, peering about the dim and gloomy apartment with
  sun-dazzled eyes, "as if he had gone away at night. He wouldn't have drawn
  the curtains in the daytime."</p>

  <p>"One would think not," Thorndyke agreed; "but it doesn't follow."</p>

  <p>He stepped to the front window and drawing back the curtains pulled up the
  blind, revealing a half-curtain of green serge over the lower part of the
  window. As the bright daylight flooded the room, he stood with his back to
  the window looking about with deep attention, letting his eyes travel slowly
  over the walls, the furniture, and especially the floor. Presently he stooped
  to pick up a short match-end which lay just under the table opposite the
  door, and as he looked at it thoughtfully, he pointed to a couple of spots of
  candle grease on the linoleum near the table. Then he glanced at the
  mantelpiece and from that to an ash-bowl on the table.</p>

  <p>"These are only trifling discrepancies," said he, "but they are worth
  noting. You see," he continued in response to my look of inquiry, "that this
  room is severely trim and orderly. Everything seems to be in place. The
  match-box, for instance, has its fixed receptacle above the mantelpiece, and
  there is a bowl for the burnt matches, regularly used, as its contents show.
  Yet there is a burnt match thrown on the floor, although the bowl is on the
  table quite handy. And the match, you notice, is not of the same kind as
  those in the box over the mantelpiece, which is a large Bryant and May, or as
  the burnt matches in the bowl which have evidently come from it. But if you
  look in the bowl," he continued, picking it up, "you will see two burnt
  matches of this same kind&mdash;apparently the small size Bryant and
  May&mdash;one burnt quite short and one only half burnt. The suggestion is
  fairly obvious, but, as I say, there is a slight discrepancy."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said I, "that either the suggestion or the discrepancy is
  very obvious to me."</p>

  <p>He walked over to the mantelpiece and took the match box from its
  case.</p>

  <p>"You see," said he, opening it, "that this box is nearly full. It has an
  appointed place and it was in that place. We find a small match, burnt right
  out, under the table opposite the door, and two more in the bowl under the
  hanging lamp. A reasonable inference is that someone came in in the dark and
  struck a match as he entered. That match must have come from a box that he
  brought with him in his pocket. It burned out and he struck another, which
  also burned out while he was raising the chimney of the lamp, and he struck a
  third to light the lamp. But if that person was Crofton, why did he need to
  strike a match to light the room when the match-box was in its usual place;
  and why did he throw the match-end on the floor?"</p>

  <p>"You mean that the suggestion is that the person was not Crofton; and I
  think you are right. Crofton doesn't carry matches in his pocket. He uses wax
  vestas and carries them in a silver case."</p>

  <p>"It might possibly have been Ambrose," Thorndyke suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said I. "Ambrose uses a petrol lighter."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded. "There may be nothing in it," said he, "but it offers a
  suggestion. Shall we look over the rest of the premises?"</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment to glance at a small key board on the wall on which
  one or two keys were hanging, each distinguished by a little ivory label and
  by the name written underneath the peg; then he opened a door in the corner
  of the room. As this led into the kitchen, I closed it and opened an
  adjoining one which gave access to a bedroom.</p>

  <p>"This is probably the extra bedroom," he remarked as we entered. "The
  blinds have not been drawn down, and there is a general air of trimness that
  suggests the tidy up of an unoccupied room. And the bed looks if it had been
  out of use."</p>

  <p>After an attentive look round, he returned to the living room and crossed
  to the remaining door. As he opened it, we looked into a nearly dark room,
  both the windows being covered by thick serge curtains.</p>

  <p>"Well," he observed, when he had drawn back the curtains and raised the
  blinds, "there is nothing painfully tidy here. That is a very roughly-made
  bed, and the blanket is outside the counterpane."</p>

  <p>He looked critically about the room and especially the bedside table.</p>

  <p>"Here are some more discrepancies," said he. "There are two candlesticks,
  in one of which the candle has burned itself right out, leaving a fragment of
  wick. There are five burnt matches in it, two large ones from the box by its
  side and three small ones, of which two are mere stumps. The second candle is
  very much guttered, and I think"&mdash;he lifted it out of the
  socket&mdash;"yes, it has been used out of the candlestick. You see that the
  grease has run down right to the bottom and there is a distinct impression of
  a thumb&mdash;apparently a left thumb&mdash;made while the grease was warm.
  Then you notice the mark on the table of a tumbler which had contained some
  liquid that was not water, but there is no tumbler. However, it may be an old
  mark, though it looks fresh."</p>

  <p>"It is hardly like Crofton to leave an old mark on the table," said I. "He
  is a regular old maid. We had better see if the tumbler is in the
  kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke. "But I wonder what he was doing with that candle.
  Apparently he took it out-of-doors, as there is a spot on the floor of the
  living-room; and you see that there are one or two spots on the floor here."
  He walked over to a chest of drawers near the door and was looking into a
  drawer which he had pulled out, and which I could see was full of clothes,
  when I observed a faint smile spreading over his face. "Come round here,
  Jardine," he said in a low voice, "and take a peep through the crack of the
  door."</p>

  <p>I walked round, and, applying my eye to the crack, looked across the
  living-room at the end window. Above the half-curtain I could distinguish the
  unmistakable top of a constabulary helmet.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Thorndyke. "They are in force."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, there came from the neighbourhood of the kitchen a furtive
  scraping sound, suggestive of a pocket knife persuading a window-catch. It
  was followed by the sound of an opening window and then of a stealthy entry.
  Finally, the kitchen door opened softly, someone tip-toed across the
  living-room and a burly police-sergeant appeared, framed in the bedroom
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, sergeant," said Thorndyke, with a genial smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all very well," was the response, "but the question is, who
  might you be, and what might you be doing in this house?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke briefly explained our business, and, when, we had presented our
  cards and Mrs. Crofton's written authority, the sergeant's professional
  stiffness vanished like magic.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Tomkins," he sang out to an invisible myrmidon. "You had
  better shut the window and go out by the front door. You must excuse me,
  gentlemen," he added; "but the tenant of the next bungalow cycled down and
  gave us the tip. He watched you through his glasses and saw you pick the
  front-door lock. It did look a bit queer, you must admit."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke admitted it freely with a faint chuckle, and we walked across
  the living-room to the kitchen. Here, the sergeant's presence seemed to
  inhibit comments, but I noticed that my colleague cast a significant glance
  at a frying-pan that rested on a Primus stove. The congealed fat in it
  presented another "discrepancy;" for I could hardly imagine the fastidious
  Crofton going away and leaving it in that condition.</p>

  <p>Noting that there was no unwashed tumbler in evidence, I followed my
  friend back to the living-room, where he paused with his eye on the
  key-board.</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked the sergeant, "if he ever did come back here, it's pretty
  clear that he isn't here now. You've been all over the premises, I
  think?"</p>

  <p>"All excepting the bathing-hut," replied Thorndyke; and, as he spoke, he
  lifted the key so labelled from its hook.</p>

  <p>The sergeant laughed softly. "He's not very likely to have taken up
  quarters there," said he. "Still, there nothing like being thorough. But you
  notice that the key of the front door and that of the gate have both been
  taken away, so we can assume that he has taken himself away too."</p>

  <p>"That is a reasonable inference," Thorndyke admitted; "but we may as well
  make our survey complete."</p>

  <p>With this he led the way out into the garden and to the gate, where he
  unblushingly produced the 'smoker's companion' and insinuated its prongs into
  the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure!" exclaimed the sergeant as the lock clicked and the gate
  opened. "That's a funny sort of tool; and you seem quite handy with it, too.
  Might I have a look at it?"</p>

  <p>He looked at it so very long and attentively, when Thorndyke handed it to
  him, that I suspected him of an intention to infringe the patent. By the time
  he had finished his inspection we were at the bottom of the bank below the
  sea-wall and Thorndyke had inserted the key into the lock of the bathing-hut.
  As the sergeant returned the 'companion' Thorndyke took it and pocketed it
  then he turned the key and pushed the door open; and the officer started back
  with a shout of amazement.</p>

  <p>It was certainly a grim spectacle that we looked in on. The hut was a
  small building about six feet square, devoid of any furniture or fittings,
  excepting one or two pegs high up the wall. The single, unglazed window was
  closely shuttered, and on the bare floor in the farther corner a man was
  sitting, leaning back into the corner, with his head dropped forward on his
  breast. The man was undoubtedly Arthur Crofton. That much I could say with
  certainty, notwithstanding the horrible changes wrought by death and the
  lapse of time. "But," I added when I had identified the body, "I should have
  said that he had been dead more than a fortnight. He must have come straight
  back from Margate and done this. And that will probably be the missing
  tumbler," I concluded, pointing to one that stood on the floor close to the
  right hand of the corpse.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," replied Thorndyke, somewhat abstractedly. He had been looking
  critically about the interior of the hut, and now remarked: "I wonder why he
  did not shoot the bolt instead of locking himself in; and what has become of
  the key? He must have taken it out of the lock and put it in his pocket."</p>

  <p>He looked interrogatively at the sergeant, who having no option but to
  take the hint, advanced with an expression of horrified disgust and proceeded
  very gingerly to explore the dead man's clothing.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed at length, "here we are." He drew from the waistcoat
  pocket a key with a small ivory label attached to it. "Yes, this is the one.
  You see, it is marked 'Bathing-hut.'"</p>

  <p>He handed it to Thorndyke, who looked at it attentively, and even with an
  appearance of surprise, and then, producing an indelible pencil from his
  pocket, wrote on the label, "Found on body."</p>

  <p>"The first thing," said he, "is to ascertain it fits the lock."</p>

  <p>"Why, it must," said the sergeant, "if he locked himself in with it."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," Thorndyke agreed, "but that is the point. It doesn't look
  quite similar to the other one."</p>

  <p>He drew out the key which we had brought from the house and gave it to me
  to hold. Then he tried the key from the dead man's pocket; but it not only
  did not fit, it would not even enter the keyhole.</p>

  <p>The sceptical indifference faded suddenly from the sergeant's face. He
  took the key from Thorndyke, having tried it with the same result, stood up
  and stared, round-eyed, at my colleague.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he exclaimed. "This is a facer! It's the wrong key!"</p>

  <p>"There may be another key on the body," said Thorndyke. "It isn't likely,
  but, you had better make sure."</p>

  <p>The sergeant showed no reluctance this time. He searched the dead man's
  pockets thoroughly and produced a bunch of keys. But they were all quite
  small keys, none of them in the least resembling that of the hut door. Nor, I
  noticed, did they include those of the bungalow door or the garden gate. Once
  more the officer drew himself up and stared at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"There's something rather fishy about this affair," said he.</p>

  <p>"There is," Thorndyke agreed. "The door was certainly locked; and as it
  was not locked from within, it must have been locked from without. Then that
  key&mdash;the wrong key&mdash;was presumably placed in the dead man's pocket
  by some other person. And there are some other suspicious facts. A tumbler
  has disappeared from the bedside table, and there is a tumbler here. You
  notice one or two spots of candle-grease on the floor here, and it looks as
  if a candle had been stood in that corner near the door. There is no candle
  here now; but in the bedroom there is a candle which has been carried without
  a candle stick and which, by the way, bears an excellent impression of a
  thumb. The first thing to do will be to take the deceased's finger-prints.
  Would you mind fetching my case from the bedroom, Jardine?"</p>

  <p>I ran back to the house (not unobserved by the gentleman in the next
  bungalow) and, catching up the case, carried it down to the hut. When I
  arrived there I found Thorndyke holding the tumbler delicately in his gloved
  left hand while he examined it against the light with the aid of his lens. He
  handed the latter to me and observed.</p>

  <p>"If you look at this carefully, Jardine, you will see a very interesting
  thing. There are the prints of two different thumbs&mdash;both left hands,
  and therefore of different persons. You will remember that the tumbler stood
  by the right hand of the body and that the table, which bore the mark of a
  tumbler, was at the left-hand side of the bed."</p>

  <p>When I had examined the thumb-prints he placed the tumbler carefully on
  the floor and opened his "research-case," which was fitted as a sort of
  portable laboratory. From this he took a little brass box containing an
  ink-tube, a tiny roller and some small cards, and, using the box-lid as an
  inking plate, he proceeded methodically to take the dead man's finger-prints,
  writing the particulars on each card.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see what you want with Crofton's finger-prints," said I.
  "The other man's would be more to the point."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," Thorndyke replied. "But we have to prove that they are
  another man's&mdash;that they are not Crofton's. And there is that print on
  the candle. That is a very important point to settle; and as we have finished
  here, we had better go and settle it at once."</p>

  <p>He closed his case, and, taking up the tumbler with his gloved hand, led
  the way back to the house, the sergeant following when he had locked the
  door. We proceeded directly to the bedroom, where Thorndyke took the candle
  from its socket and, with the aid of his lens, compared it carefully with the
  two thumb-prints on the card, and then with the tumbler.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly clear," said he. "This is a mark of a left thumb. It is
  totally unlike Crofton's and it appears to be identical with the strange
  thumb-print on the tumbler. From which it seems to follow that the stranger
  took the candle from this room to the hut and brought it back. But he
  probably blew it out before leaving the house and lit it again in the
  hut."</p>

  <p>The sergeant and I examined the cards, the candle and the tumbler, and
  then the former asked: "I suppose you have no idea whose thumb-print that
  might be? You don't know, for instance, of anyone who might have had any
  motive for making away with Mr. Crofton?</p>

  <p>"That," replied Thorndyke, "is rather a question for the coroner's
  jury."</p>

  <p>"So it is," the sergeant agreed. "But there won't be much question about
  their verdict. It is a pretty clear case of wilful murder."</p>

  <p>To this Thorndyke made no reply excepting to give some directions as to
  the safe-keeping of the candle and tumbler; and our proposed "gipsy holiday"
  being now evidently impossible, we took our leave of the sergeant&mdash;who
  already had our cards&mdash;and wended back to the station.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "we shall have to break the news to Mrs.
  Crofton."</p>

  <p>"That is hardly our business," he replied. "We can leave that to the
  solicitor or to Ambrose. If you know the lawyer's address, you might send him
  a telegram, arranging a meeting at eight o'clock to-night. Give no
  particulars. Just say "Crofton found," but mark the telegram "urgent" so that
  he will keep the appointment."</p>

  <p>On reaching the station, I sent off the telegram, and very soon afterwards
  the London train was signalled. It turned out to be a slow train, which gave
  us ample time to discuss the case and me ample time for reflection. And, in
  fact, I reflected a good deal; for there was a rather uncomfortable question
  in my mind&mdash;the very question that the sergeant had raised and that
  Thorndyke had obviously evaded. Was there anyone who might have had a motive
  for making away with Crofton? It was an awkward question when one remembered
  the great legacy that had just fallen in and the terms of Miss Shuler's will;
  which expressly provided that, if Crofton died before his wife, the legacy
  should go to her. Now, Ambrose was the wife's brother; and Ambrose had been
  in the bungalow alone with Crofton, and nobody else was known to have been
  there at all. I meditated on these facts uncomfortably and would have liked
  to put the case to Thorndyke; but his reticence, his evasion of the
  sergeant's question and his decision to communicate with the solicitor rather
  than with the family showed pretty clearly what was in his mind and that he
  did not wish to discuss the matter.</p>

  <p>Promptly at eight o'clock, having dined at a restaurant, we presented
  ourselves at the solicitor's house and were shown into the study, where we
  found Mr. Jobson seated at a writing-table. He looked at Thorndyke with some
  surprise, and when the introductions had been made, said somewhat dryly: "We
  may take it that Dr. Thorndyke is in some way connected with our rather
  confidential business?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I replied. "That is why he is here."</p>

  <p>Jobson nodded. "And how is Crofton?" he asked, "and where did you dig him
  up?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say," I replied, "that he is dead. It is a dreadful affair.
  We found his body locked in the bathing-hut. He was sitting in a corner with
  a tumbler on the floor by his side."</p>

  <p>"Horrible! horrible!" exclaimed the solicitor. "He ought never to have
  gone there alone. I said so at the time. And it is most unfortunate on
  account of the insurance, though that is not a large amount. Still the
  suicide clause, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I doubt whether the insurance will be affected," said Thorndyke. "The
  coroner's finding will almost certainly be wilful murder."</p>

  <p>Jobson was thunderstruck. In a moment his face grew livid and he gazed at
  Thorndyke with an expression of horrified amazement.</p>

  <p>"Murder!" he repeated incredulously. "But you said he was locked in the
  hut. Surely that is clear proof of suicide."</p>

  <p>"He hadn't locked himself in, you know. There was no key inside."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" The solicitor spoke almost in a tone relief. "But, perhaps&mdash;did
  you examine his pockets?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and we found a key labelled 'Bathing hut.' But it was the wrong key.
  It wouldn't go into the lock. There is no doubt whatever that the door was
  locked from the outside."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Jobson, in a faint voice. "It does look suspicious.
  But still, I can't believe&mdash;It seems quite incredible."</p>

  <p>"That may be," said Thorndyke, "but it is all perfectly clear. There is
  evidence that a stranger entered the bungalow at night and that the affair
  took place in the bedroom. From thence the stranger carried the body down to
  the hut and he also took a tumbler and a candle from the bedside table. By
  the light of the candle&mdash;which was stood on the floor of the hut in a
  corner&mdash;he arranged the body, having put into its pocket a key from the
  board in the living-room. Then he locked the hut, went back to the house, put
  the key on its peg and the candle in its candlestick. Then he locked up the
  house and the garden gate and took the keys away with him."</p>

  <p>The solicitor listened to this recital in speechless amazement. At length
  he asked: "How long ago do you suppose this happened?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently on the night of the fifteenth of this month," was the
  reply.</p>

  <p>"But," objected Jobson, "he wrote home on the sixteenth."</p>

  <p>"He wrote," said Thorndyke, "on the sixth. Somebody put a one in front of
  the six and posted the letter at Margate on the sixteenth. I shall give
  evidence to that effect at the inquest."</p>

  <p>I was becoming somewhat mystified. Thorndyke's dry, stern manner&mdash;so
  different from his usual suavity&mdash;and the solicitor's uncalled-for
  agitation, seemed to hint at something more than met the eye. I watched
  Jobson as he lit a cigarette&mdash;with a small Bryant and May match, which
  he threw on the floor&mdash;and listened expectantly for his next question.
  At length he asked: "Was there any sort of&mdash;er&mdash;clue as to who this
  stranger might be?"</p>

  <p>"The man who will be charged with the murder? Oh, yes. The police have the
  means of identifying him with absolute certainty."</p>

  <p>"That is, if they can find him," said Jobson.</p>

  <p>"Naturally. But when all the very remarkable facts have transpired at the
  inquest, that individual will probably come pretty clearly into view."</p>

  <p>Jobson continued to smoke furiously with his eyes fixed on the floor, as
  if he were thinking hard. Presently he asked, without looking up: "Supposing
  they do find this man. What then? What evidence is there that he murdered
  Crofton?"</p>

  <p>"You mean direct evidence?" said Thorndyke. "I can't say, as I did not
  examine the body; but the circumstantial evidence that I have given you would
  be enough to convict unless there were some convincing explanation other than
  murder. And I may say," he added, "that if the suspected person has a
  plausible explanation to offer, he would be well advised to produce it before
  he is charged. A voluntary statement has a good deal more weight than the
  same statement made by a prisoner in answer to a charge."</p>

  <p>There was an interval of silence, in which I looked bewilderment from
  Thorndyke's stern visage to the pale face of the solicitor. At length the
  latter rose abruptly and, after one or two quick strides up and down the
  room, halted by the fireplace, and, still avoiding Thorndyke's eye, said,
  somewhat brusquely, though in a low, husky voice: "I will tell you how it
  happened. I went down to Seasalter, as you said, on the night of the
  fifteenth, on the chance of finding Crofton at the bungalow. I wanted to tell
  him of Miss Shuler's death and of the provisions her will."</p>

  <p>"You had some private information on that subject, I presume?" said
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes. My cousin was her solicitor and he kept me informed about the
  will."</p>

  <p>"And about the state of her health?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Well, when I arrived at the bungalow, it was in darkness. The gate
  and the front door were unlocked, so I entered, calling out Crofton's name.
  As no one answered, I struck a match and lit the lamp. Then I went into the
  bedroom and struck a match there; and by its light I could see Crofton lying
  on the bed, quite still. I spoke to him, but he did not answer or move. Then
  I lighted a candle on his table; and now I could see what I had already
  guessed, that he was dead, and that he had been dead some time&mdash;probably
  more than a week.</p>

  <p>"It was an awful shock to find a dead man in this solitary house, and my
  first impulse was to rush out and give the alarm. But when I went into the
  living-room, I happened to see a letter lying on writing-table and noticed
  that it was in his own hand and addressed to his wife. Unfortunately, I had
  the curiosity to take it out of the unsealed envelope and read it. It was
  dated the sixth and stated his intention of going to Margate for a time and
  then coming back to the bungalow.</p>

  <p>"Now, the reading of that letter exposed me to an enormous temptation. By
  simply putting a one in front of the six and thus altering the date from the
  sixth to the sixteenth and posting the letter at Margate, I stood to gain
  thirty thousand pounds. I saw that at a glance. But I did not decide
  immediately to do it. I pulled down the blinds, drew the curtains and locked
  up the house while I thought it over. There seemed to be practically no risk,
  unless someone should come to the bungalow and notice that the state of the
  body did not agree with the altered date on the letter. I went back and
  looked at the dead man. There was a burnt-out candle by his side and a
  tumbler containing the dried-up remains of some brown liquid. He had
  evidently poisoned himself. Then it occurred to me that, if I put the body
  and the tumbler in some place where they were not likely to be found for some
  time, the discrepancy between the condition of the body and the date of the
  letter would not be noticed.</p>

  <p>"For some time I could think of no suitable place, but at last I
  remembered the bathing-hut. No one would look there for him. If they came to
  the bungalow and didn't find him there, they would merely conclude that he
  had not come back from Margate. I took the candle and the key from the
  key-board and went down to the hut; but there was a key in the door already,
  so I brought the other key back and put it in Crofton's pocket, never
  dreaming that it might not be the duplicate. Of course, I ought to have tried
  it in the door.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know the rest. I took the body down about two in the morning,
  locked up the hut, brought away the key and hung it on the board, took the
  counterpane off the bed, as it had some marks on it, and re-made the bed with
  the blanket outside. In the morning I took the train to Margate, posted the
  letter, after altering the date, and threw the gate-key and that of the front
  door into the sea.</p>

  <p>"That is what really happened. You may not believe me; but I think you
  will as you have seen the body and will realise that I had no motive for
  killing Crofton before the fifteenth, whereas Crofton evidently died before
  that date."</p>

  <p>"I would not say 'evidently,'" said Thorndyke; "but, as the date of his
  death is the vital point in your defence, you would be wise to notify the
  coroner of the importance of the issue."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand this case," I said, as we walked homewards (I was
  spending the evening with Thorndyke). "You seemed to smell a rat from the
  very first. And I don't see how you spotted Jobson. It is a mystery to
  me."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be if you were a lawyer," he replied. "The case against
  Jobson was contained in what you told me at our first interview. You yourself
  commented on the peculiarity of the will that he drafted for Crofton. The
  intention of the latter was to leave all his property to his wife. But
  instead of saying so, the will specified each item of property, and appointed
  a residuary legatee, which was Jobson himself. This might have appeared like
  mere legal verbiage; but when Miss Shuler's legacy was announced, the
  transaction took on a rather different aspect. For this legacy was not among
  the items specified in the will. Therefore it did not go to Mrs. Crofton. It
  would be included in the residue of the estate and would go to the residuary
  legatee."</p>

  <p>"The deuce it would!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly; until Crofton revoked his will or made a fresh one. This was
  rather suspicious. It suggested that Jobson had private information as to
  Miss Shuler's will and had drafted Crofton's will in accordance with it; and
  as she died of malignant disease, her doctor must have known for some time
  that she was dying and it looked as if Jobson had information on that point,
  too. Now the position of affairs that you described to me was this:</p>

  <p>"Crofton, a possible suicide, had disappeared, and had made no fresh
  will.</p>

  <p>"Miss Shuler died on the thirteenth, leaving thirty thousand pounds to
  Crofton, if he survived her, or if he did not, then to Mrs. Crofton. The
  important question then was whether Crofton was alive or dead; and if he was
  dead, whether he had died before or after the thirteenth. For if he died
  before the thirteenth the legacy went to Mrs. Crofton, but if he died after
  that date the legacy went to Jobson.</p>

  <p>"Then you showed me that extraordinarily opportune letter dated the
  sixteenth. Now, seeing that that date was worth thirty thousand pounds to
  Jobson, I naturally scrutinised it narrowly. The letter was written with
  ordinary blue-black ink. But this ink, even in the open, takes about a
  fortnight to blacken completely. In a closed envelope it takes considerably
  longer. On examining this date through a lens, the one was very perceptibly
  bluer than the six. It had therefore been added later. But for what reason?
  And by whom?</p>

  <p>"The only possible reason was that Crofton was dead and had died before
  the thirteenth. The only person who had any motive for making the alteration
  was Jobson. Therefore, when we started for Seasalter I already felt sure that
  Crofton was dead and that the letter had been posted at Margate by Jobson. I
  had further no doubt that Crofton's body was concealed somewhere on the
  premises of the bungalow. All that I had to do was to verify those
  conclusions."</p>

  <p>"Then you believe that Jobson has told us the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I suspect that he went down there with the deliberate intention
  of making away with Crofton before he could make a fresh will. The finding of
  Crofton's body must have been a fearful disappointment, but I must admit that
  he showed considerable resource in dealing with the situation; and he failed
  only by the merest chance. I think his defence against the murder charge will
  be admitted; but, of course, it will involve plea of guilty to the charge of
  fraud in connection with the legacy."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's forecast turned out to be correct. Jobson was acquitted of the
  murder of Arthur Crofton, but is at present "doing time" in respect of the
  forged letter and the rest of his too-ingenious scheme.</p>
