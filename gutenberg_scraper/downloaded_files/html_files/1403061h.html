<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>These vigorous pictures were among the very last work done by
the lamented pen which gave us "The Red Badge of Courage."</p>

<p>We were aroused by that startling drumbeat to the advent of a
new literary talent. The commonplace was shattered by a fresh and
original force, and every one heard and applauded. Then came the
varied fiction, always characteristic and convincing, and then, at
the end, this return to the martial strain.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the battles should be the choice of the
author, and he chose them for their picturesque and theatric
qualities, not alone for their decisiveness. What he could best
assimilate from history was its grandeur and passion and the fire
of action. These he loved, and hence the group of glorious battles
which forms this volume.</p>

<p>The talent of Stephen Crane was mellowing under the tutelage of
experience. He lost none of his dash and audacity even in the
sedater avenues of history. He was a strong and native growth of
our wonderful soil, and the fruits of him will last while courage
and genius are revered.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>VITTORIA</h2>

<p>The campaign of 1812, which included the storming of Ciudad
Rodrigo and Badajoz and the overwhelming victory of Salamanca, had
apparently done so much towards destroying the Napoleonic sway in
the Peninsula that the defeat of the Allies at Burgos, in October
1812, came as an embittering disappointment to England; and when
Wellington, after his disastrous retreat to Ciudad Rodrigo,
reported his losses as amounting to nine thousand, the usual
tempest of condemnation against him was raised, and the members of
the Cabinet, who were always so free with their oracular advice and
so close with the nation's money, wagged their heads
despairingly.</p>

<p>But as the whole aspect of affairs was revealed, and as
Wellington coolly stated his plans for a new campaign, public
opinion changed.</p>

<p>It was a critical juncture: Napoleon had arranged an armistice
with Russia, Prussia, and Austria, which was to last until August
16, 1813, and it became known that this armistice might end in
peace. Peace on the Continent would mean that Napoleon's unemployed
troops might be poured into Spain in such enormous numbers as to
overwhelm the Allies. So, to ensure Wellington's striking a
decisive blow before this could happen, both the English Ministry
and the Opposition united in supporting him, and for the first time
during the war he felt sure of receiving the supplies for which he
had asked.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>After the French Defeat&mdash;Vittoria</b>
</p>

<p>The winter and spring were spent by Wellington in preparing for
his campaign: his troops needed severe discipline after the
disorder into which they had fallen during the retreat from Burgos,
and the great chief entered into the matter of their equipment with
most painstaking attention to detail, removing unnecessary weight
from them, and supplying each infantry soldier with three extra
pairs of shoes, besides heels and soles for repairs. He drew large
reinforcements from England, and all were drilled to a high state
of efficiency.</p>

<p>It is well to quote here from the letter published by Wellington
on the 28th of December 1812. It was addressed to the commanders of
divisions and brigades. It created a very pretty storm, as one may
readily see. I quote at length, since surely no document could be
more illuminative of Wellington's character, and it seems certain
that this fearless letter saved the army from the happy-go-lucky
feeling, very common in British field forces, that a man is a
thorough soldier so long as he is willing at all times to go into
action and charge, if ordered, at even the brass gates of Inferno.
But Wellington knew that this was not enough. He wrote as
follows:</p>

<p class="letter">"Gentlemen&mdash;I have ordered the army into
cantonments, in which I hope that circumstances will enable me to
keep them for some time, during which the troops will receive their
clothing, necessaries, etc., which are already in progress by
different lines of communication to the several divisions and
brigades.<br>
<br>
"But besides these objects, I must draw your attention in a very
particular manner to the state of discipline of the troops. The
discipline of every army, after a long and active campaign, becomes
in some degree relaxed, and requires the utmost attention on the
part of general and other officers to bring it back to the state in
which it ought to be for service; but I am concerned to have to
observe that the army under my command has fallen off in this
respect in the late campaign to a greater degree than any army with
which I have ever served, or of which I have ever read.<br>
<br>
. . . . .<br>
<br>
"It must be obvious, however, to every officer, that from the
moment the troops commenced their retreat from the neighbourhood of
Burgos on the one hand, and from Madrid on the other, the officers
lost all command over their men.<br>
<br>
. . . . .<br>
<br>
"I have no hesitation in attributing these evils to the habitual
inattention of the officers of the regiments to their duty as
prescribed by the standing regulations of the service and by the
orders of this army.<br>
<br>
"I am far from questioning the zeal, still less the gallantry and
spirit, of the officers of the army; I am quite certain that if
their minds can be convinced of the necessity of minute and
constant attention to understand, recollect, and carry into
execution the orders which have been issued for the performance of
their duty, and that the strict performance of this duty is
necessary to enable the army to serve the country as it ought to be
served, they will in future give their attention to these
points.<br>
<br>
"Unfortunately, the experience of the officers of the army has
induced many to consider that the period during which an army is on
service is one of relaxation from all rule, instead of being, as it
is, the period during which of all others every rule for the
regulation and control of the conduct of the soldier, for the
inspection and care of his arms, ammunition, accoutrements,
necessaries, and field equipments, and his horse and horse
appointments, for the receipt and issue and care of his provisions
and the regulation of all that belongs to his food and the forage
for his horse, must be most strictly attended to by the officer of
his company or troop, if it is intended that an army&mdash;a
British army in particular&mdash;shall be brought into the field of
battle in a state of efficiency to meet the enemy on the day of
trial.<br>
<br>
"These are points, then, to which I most earnestly entreat you to
turn your attention, and the attention of the officers of the
regiments under your command, Portuguese as well as English, during
the period in which it may be in my power to leave the troops in
their cantonments.<br>
<br>
. . . . .<br>
<br>
"In regard to the food of the soldier, I have frequently observed
and lamented in the late campaign the facility and celerity with
which the French soldiers cooked in comparison with those of our
army.<br>
<br>
"The cause of this disadvantage is the same with that of every
other description&mdash;the want of attention of the officers to
the orders of the army and the conduct of their men, and the
consequent want of authority over their conduct.<br>
<br>
. . . . .<br>
<br>
"But I repeat that the great object of the attention of the general
and field officers must be to get the captains and subalterns of
the regiments to understand and perform the duties required from
them, as the only mode by which the discipline and efficiency of
the army can be restored and maintained during the next
campaign."</p>

<p>The British general never refrained from speaking his mind, even
if his ideas were certain to be contrary to the spirit of the army.
I will quote from <i>Victories of the British Armies</i> as
follows:</p>

<p class="quote">"Colborne marched with the infantry on the right;
Head, with the Thirteenth Light Dragoons and two squadrons of
Portuguese, on the left, and the heavy cavalry formed a reserve.
Perceiving that their battering train was endangered, the French
cavalry, as the ground over which they were retiring was favourable
for the movement, charged the Thirteenth. But they were vigorously
repulsed; and, failing in breaking the British, the whole,
consisting of four regiments, drew up in front, forming an imposing
line. The Thirteenth instantly formed and galloped
forward&mdash;and nothing could have been more splendid than their
charge. They rode fairly through the French, overtook and cut down
many of the gunners, and at last entirely headed the line of march,
keeping up a fierce and straggling encounter with the broken
horsemen of the enemy, until some of the English dragoons actually
reached the gates of Badajoz."</p>

<p>And now I quote from Wellington's comment to Colborne:</p>

<p class="quote">"I wish you would call together the officers of
the dragoons and point out to them the mischiefs which must result
from the disorder of the troops in action. The undisciplined ardour
of the Thirteenth Dragoons and First Regiment of Portuguese cavalry
is not of the description of the determined bravery and steadiness
of soldiers confident in their discipline and in their officers.
Their conduct was that of a rabble, galloping as fast as their
horses could carry them over a plain, after an enemy to whom they
could do no mischief when they were broken and the pursuit had
continued for a limited distance, and sacrificing substantial
advantages and all the objects of your operation by their want of
discipline. To this description of their conduct I add my entire
conviction, that if the enemy could have thrown out of Badajoz only
one hundred men regularly formed, they would have driven back these
two regiments in equal haste and disorder, and would probably have
taken many whose horses would have been knocked up. If the
Thirteenth Dragoons are again guilty of this conduct I shall take
their horses from them, and send the officers and men to do duty at
Lisbon."</p>

<p>The incident of the dragoons' charge happened early in 1811, but
it shows how Wellington dealt with the firebrands in the army.
However, imagine the feelings of the Thirteenth Dragoons!</p>

<p>As for the Allies, they were for a long time considered quite
hopeless by British officers; the Portuguese were commonly known in
the ranks as the "Vamosses," from <i>vamos,</i> "let us be off,"
which they shouted before they ran away. (The American slang
"vamoose" may have had its origin in the Mexican War.)</p>

<p>The Spanish and Portuguese hated each other so cordially that it
was with the greatest difficulty that they could be induced to
co-operate: they were continually plotting to betray each other,
and, incidentally, the English. Wellington had a sufficiently hard
task in keeping his English army in order and directing the civil
administration of Portugal, which would otherwise have tumbled to
pieces from the corruption of its government; but hardest of all
was the military training of the Spanish and Portuguese. He was now
in supreme command of the Spanish army, concerning which he had
written:</p>

<p class="quote">
</p>

<p>"There is not in the whole Kingdom of Spain a depot of
provisions for the support of a single battalion in operation for
one day. Not a shilling of money in any military chest. To move
them forward at any point now would be to ensure their certain
destruction."</p>

<p>After that was written, however, he had been able to equip them
with some degree of effectiveness, and had worked them up to a
certain standard of discipline: they were brave and patient, and
susceptible to improvement under systematic training. Beresford had
also accomplished wonders with the Portuguese, and Wellington's
army now numbered seventy thousand men, of whom forty thousand were
British.</p>

<p>Wellington, with his lean, sharp-featured face, and dry, cold
manner, was not the typical Englishman at all. He was more like the
genuine Yankee of New England. He made his successes by his
resourcefulness, his inability to be overpowered by circumstances.
As he said: "The French plan their campaigns just as you might make
a splendid set of harness. It answers very well until it gets
broken, and then you are done for! Now I made my campaign of ropes;
if anything went wrong I tied a knot and went on."</p>

<p>He was always ready, when anything broke or failed him, to "tie
a knot and go on." That is the suppleness and adroitness of a great
chieftain, whereas the typical English general was too magnificent
for the little things; he liked to hurl his men boldly into the
abyss&mdash;and then, if they perished, it had been magnificently
done, at any rate. But Wellington was always practical and ready to
take advantage of any opportunity that offered. He had no illusions
about the grandeur of getting men killed for nothing.</p>

<p>There were still two hundred and thirty thousand French troops
in Spain, but they were scattered across the Peninsula from
Asturias to Valencia. To the extreme east was Marshal Suchet with
sixty-five thou: sand men, and an expedition under General Murray
was sent against him which kept him there. Clausel was prevented
from leaving Biscay with his forty thousand men by the great
guerilla warfare with which Wellington enveloped his forces. There
remained, then, for Wellington to deal with the centre of the army
under Joseph Bonaparte, whose jealous suspicions had been the means
of driving from Spain Marshal Soult, a really fine and capable
commander. The weak Joseph was now the head of an immense and
magnificently equipped army of men and officers in the finest
condition for fighting, but who were to prove of how little effect
fine soldiers can be when they lack the right chief.</p>

<p>The army of Joseph lay in a curve from Toledo to Zamora,
guarding the central valley of the Douro, and covering the great
road from Madrid through Burgos and Vittoria to France.
Wellington's plan was to move the left wing of his army across the
Douro within the Portuguese frontier, to march it up the right bank
of the Douro as far as Zamora, and then, crossing the Elsa, to
unite it to the Galician forces; while the centre and right,
advancing from Agueda by Salamanca, were to force the passage of
the Tormes and drive the French entirely from the line of the Douro
towards the Carrion.</p>

<p>By constantly threatening them on the flank with the left wing,
which was to be always kept in advance, he thus hoped to drive the
French back by Burgos into Biscay. He himself expected to establish
there a new basis for the war among the numerous and well-fortified
seaports on the coast. In this way, forcing the enemy back to his
frontier, he would at once better his own position and intercept
the whole communication of the enemy. The plan had the obvious
objection that in separating his army into two forces, with great
mountain ranges and impassable rivers between them, each was
exposed to the risk of an attack by the whole force of the
enemy.</p>

<p>But Wellington had resolved to take this risk. Sir Thomas
Graham, in spite of his sixty-eight years, had the vigour and
clear-headedness of youth, and the very genius for the difficult
command given him&mdash;that of leading the left wing through
virgin forests, over rugged mountains, and across deep rivers.</p>

<p>The march of Wellington began May 22, and an exalted spirit of
enthusiasm pervaded the entire army. Even Wellington became
expressive, and as he passed the stream that marks the frontier of
Spain he arose in his stirrups, and, waving his hand, exclaimed,
"Farewell, Portugal!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Graham, on May 16, with forty thousand men, had
crossed the Douro and pushed ahead, turning the French right and
striking at their communications. Within ten days forty thousand
men were transported through two hundred miles of the most broken
and rugged country in the Peninsula, with all their artillery and
baggage. Soon they were in possession of the whole crest of
mountains between the Ebro and the sea. On the 31st Graham reached
the Elsa. The French were astounded when Graham appeared upon their
flank; they abandoned their strong position on the Douro; then they
abandoned Madrid; after that, they hurried out of Burgos and
Valladolid.</p>

<p>Wellington had crossed the Douro at Miranda on May 25, in
advance of his troops, by means of a basket slung on a rope from
precipice to precipice, at an immense height above the foaming
torrent. The rivers were all swollen by floods.</p>

<p>Graham, with the left wing of the Allies, kept up his eager
march. Many men were lost while fording the Elsa on May 31. The
water was almost chin-deep and the bottom was covered with shifting
stones. Graham hastened with fierce speed to the Ebro, eager to
cross it before Joseph and break his communications with France.
Joseph had wished to stop his retreat at Burgos and give battle
there, but he had been told that incredible numbers of guerillas
had joined the English forces, and so he pushed on, leaving the
castle at Burgos heavily mined. It was calculated that the
explosion would take place just as the English entered the town,
but the fuses were too quick&mdash;three thousand French soldiers,
the last to leave, were crushed by the falling ruins. The allied
troops marched triumphantly through the scene of their earlier
struggle and defeat.</p>

<p>On abandoning Burgos Joseph took the road to Vittoria and sent
pressing orders to Clausel to join him there, but this junction of
forces was not effected&mdash;Clausel was too late.</p>

<p>Wellington's strategy of turning the French right has been
called "the most masterly movement made during the Peninsular War."
Its chief merit was that it gave Wellington the advantage of
victory with hardly any loss of life. It swept the French back to
the Spanish frontier. And Joseph, whose train comprised an
incredible number of chariots, carriages, and waggons, bearing a
helpless multitude of people of both sexes from Madrid (including
the civil functionaries and officers of his court), as well as
enormous stores of spoil, began to perceive that this precipitate
retreat was his ruin, and that he must risk the chance of a great
battle to escape being driven in hopeless confusion through the
passes of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The sweep of the Allies under Graham around the French right had
taken them through the wildest and most enchantingly beautiful
regions. At times a hundred men had been needed to drag up one
piece of artillery. Again, the guns would be lowered down a
precipice by ropes, or forced up the rugged goat-paths. At length,
to quote Napier, "the scarlet uniforms were to be seen in every
valley, and the stream of war, descending with impetuous force down
all the clefts of the mountains, burst in a hundred foaming
torrents into the basin of Vittoria."</p>

<p>So accurately had Graham done his work in accordance with
Wellington's plans, that he reached the valley just as Joseph's
dejected troops were forming themselves in front of Vittoria.</p>

<p>The basin or valley of Vittoria, with the town in its eastern
extremity, is a small plain about eight miles by six miles in
extent, situated in an elevated plateau among the mountains and
guarded on all sides by rugged hills.</p>

<p>The great road from Madrid enters the valley at the Puebla Pass,
where too the river Zadora flows through a narrow mountain gorge.
This road then runs up the left bank of the Zadora to Vittoria, and
from there it goes on towards Bayonne and the Pyrenees. This road
was Joseph's line of retreat.</p>

<p>King Joseph, burdened by his treasure, which included the
plunder of five years of French occupation in the Peninsula, and
consisted largely of priceless works of art, selected with most
excellent taste by himself and other French connoisseurs, had
despatched to France two great convoys, a small part of the whole
treasure, along the Bayonne road. As these had to be heavily
guarded against the Biscay guerillas, some thousands of troops had
gone with them. Joseph's remaining forces were estimated at from
sixty thousand to sixty-five thousand men.</p>

<p>The French were anxious above all things to keep the road
open&mdash;the road to Bayonne: there are several rough mountain
roads intersecting each other at Vittoria, particularly those to
Pampeluna, Bilboa, and Galicia; but the great Bayonne road was the
only one capable of receiving the huge train of lumbering carriages
without which the army was not to move.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 20th Wellington, whose effective force
was now sixty-five thousand men, surveyed the place and the enemy
from the hill ranges and saw that they were making a stand. He
decided then on his tactics. Instead of pushing on his combined
forces to a frontal attack, he made up his mind to divide his
troops; he would send Graham with the left wing, consisting of
eighteen thousand men and twenty guns, around by the northern hills
to the rear of the French army, there to seize the road to Bayonne.
Sir Rowland Hill with twenty thousand men, including General
Murillo with his Spaniards, was to move with the right wing, break
through the Puebla Pass, and attack the French left.</p>

<p>The right centre under Wellington himself was to cross the
ridges forming the southern boundary of the basin and then move
straight forward to the Zadora River and attack the bridges, while
the left centre was to move across the bridge of Mendoza in the
direction of the town.</p>

<p>The French right, which Graham was to attack, occupied the
heights in front of the Zadora River above the village of
Abechucho, and covered Vittoria from approach by the Bilboa road;
the centre extended along the left bank of the Zadora, cornmanding
the bridges in front of it, and blocking up the great road from
Madrid. The left occupied the space from Ariniz to the ridges of
Puebla de Arlauzon, and guarded the Pass of Puebla, by which Hill
was to enter the valley.</p>

<p>The early morning of June 21 was, according to one historian,
"rainy and heavy with vapour," while an observer (Leith Hay) said:
"The morning was extremely brilliant; a clearer or more beautiful
atmosphere never favoured the progress of a gigantic conflict."</p>

<p>The valley, occupied by the French army, with the rich uniforms
of its officers, was a superb spectacle. Marshal Jourdan, the
commander, could be seen riding slowly along the line of his
troops. The positions they occupied rose in steps from the centre
of the valley, so that all could be seen by the English from the
crest of the Morillas as they stood ready for battle. In his
<i>Events of Military Life</i> Henry says:</p>

<p class="quote">"The dark and formidable masses of the French were
prepared at all points to repel the meditated attack&mdash;the
infantry in column with loaded arms, or ambushed thickly in the low
woods at the base of their position, the cavalry in lines with
drawn swords, and the artillery frowning from the eminences with
lighted matches; while on our side all was yet quietness and
repose. The chiefs were making their observations, and the men
walking about in groups amidst the piled arms, chatting and
laughing and gazing, and apparently not caring a pin for the fierce
hostile array in their front."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Hill reached the Pass of Puebla and forced his
way through with extraordinary swiftness. Murillo's Spaniards went
swarming up the steep ridges to dislodge the French, but the enemy
made a furious resistance, and reinforcements kept coming to their
aid. General Murillo was wounded, but would not be carried from the
field. Hill then sent the Seventy-first to help the Spaniards, who
were showing high courage, but being terribly mown down by the
French musketry. Colonel Cadogan, who led the Seventy-first, had no
sooner reached the summit of the height than he fell, mortally
wounded. The French were driven from their position, but the loss
of Cadogan was keenly felt. The story of his strange state of
exaltation the night before the battle is well known&mdash;his
rapture at the prospect of taking part in it. As he lay dying on
the summit he would not be moved, although the dead lay thick about
him, but watched the progress of his Highlanders until he could no
longer see.</p>

<p>While this conflict was going on, Wellington, with the right
centre, had commenced his attack on the bridges over the Zadora. A
Spanish peasant brought word that the bridge of Tres Puentes was
negligently guarded, and offered to guide the troops to it. Kempt's
Brigade soon reached it; the Fifteenth Hussars galloped over, but a
shot from a French battery killed the brave peasant who had guided
them.</p>

<p>The forces that crossed at Tres Puentes now formed under the
shelter of a hill. One of the officers wrote of this position:</p>

<p class="quote">"Our post was most extraordinary, as we were
isolated from the rest of the army and within one hundred yards of
the enemy's advance. As I looked over the bank, I could see El Rey
Joseph, surrounded by at least five thousand men, within five
hundred yards of us."</p>

<p>It has always seemed an inconceivable thing that the French
should not have destroyed the seven narrow bridges across the
Zadora before the 21st had dawned. Whether it was from
over-confidence or sheer mental confusion, it is impossible to
know.</p>

<p>The Third and Seventh Divisions were now moving rapidly down to
the bridge of Mendoza, but the enemy's light troops and guns had
opened a vigorous fire upon them, until the riflemen of the Light
Division, who had crossed at Tres Puentes, charged the enemy's
fire, and the bridge was carried.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Picton was a picturesque figure in this part of the
operations. Through some oversight he and his men, the "Fighting
Third," were neglected. Orders came to other troops, bridges were
being carried, but no word was sent to Picton. "D&mdash;&mdash;
it!" he cried out to one of his officers, "Lord Wellington must
have forgotten us!" He beat the mane of his horse with his stick in
his impatience and anger. Finally, an aide-de-camp galloped up and
inquired for Lord Dalhousie, who commanded the Seventh Division. In
answer to Picton's inquiries he stated that he brought orders for
Dalhousie to carry the bridge to the left, while the Fourth and
Sixth Divisions were to support the attack. Picton rose in his
stirrups, and shouted angrily to the amazed aide-de-camp:</p>

<p>"You may tell Lord Wellington from me, sir, that the
<i>Third</i> Division, under my command, shall in less than ten
minutes attack the bridge and carry it, and the Fourth and Sixth
may support if they choose." Then, addressing his men with his
customary blend of affection and profanity, he cried: "Come on, ye
rascals! Come on, ye fighting villains!"</p>

<p>They carried the bridge with such fire and speed that the whole
British line was animated by the sight.</p>

<p>Maxwell says: "The passage of the river, the movement of
glittering masses from right to left as far as the eye could range,
the deafening roar of cannon, the sustained fusillade of the
artillery, made up a magnificent scene. The British cavalry, drawn
up to support the columns, seemed a glittering line of golden
helmets and sparkling swords in the keen sunshine which now shone
upon the field of battle."</p>

<p>L'Estrange, who was with the Thirty-first, says that the men
were marching through standing corn (I suppose some kind of grain
that ripens early, certainly not maize) yellow for the sickle and
between four and five feet high, and the hissing cannon-balls, as
they rent their way through the sea of golden grain, made long
furrows in it.</p>

<p>The hill in front of Ariniz was the key of the French line, and
Wellington brought up several batteries and hurled Picton's
division in a solid mass against it, while the heavy cavalry of the
British came up at a gallop from the river to sustain the
attack.</p>

<p>This hill had been the scene of a great fight in the wars of the
Black Prince, where Sir William Felton, with two hundred archers
and swordsmen, had been surrounded by six thousand Spaniards, and
all perished, resisting doggedly. It is still called "the
Englishmen's hill."</p>

<p>An obstinate fight now raged, for a brief space, on this spot. A
long wall was held by several battalions of French infantry, whose
fire was so deadly as to check the British for a time. They reached
the wall, however, and for a few moments on either side of it was a
seething mass of furious soldiers. "Any person," said Kincaid, who
was present, "who chose to put his head over from either side, was
sure of getting a sword or bayonet up his nostrils."</p>

<p>As the British broke over the wall, the French fell back,
abandoning Ariniz for the ridge in front of Gomecha, only to be
forced back again.</p>

<p>It was the noise of Graham's guns, booming since mid-day at
their rear, that took the heart out of the French soldiery.</p>

<p>Graham had struck the great blow on the left; at eleven he had
reached the heights above the village and bridge of Gamara Major,
which were strongly occupied by the French under Reille. General
Oswald commenced the attack and drove the enemy from the heights;
then Major-General Robinson, at the head of a brigade of the Fifth
Division, formed his men and led them forward on the run to carry
the bridge and village of Gamara. But the French fire was so strong
that he was compelled to fall back. Again he rallied them and
crossed the bridge, but the French drove them back once more. Fresh
British troops came up and the bridge was carried again; and then,
for the third time, it was lost under Reille's murderous fire.</p>

<p>But now the panic from the centre had reached Reille. It was
known that the French centre was retreating: the Frenchmen had no
longer the moral strength to resist Robinson's attacks, and so the
bridge was won by the English and the Bayonne road was lost to the
French.</p>

<p>In the centre the battle had become a sort of running fight for
six miles; the French were at last all thrown back into the little
plain in front of Vittoria, where from the crowded throng cries of
despair could be heard.</p>

<p>"At six o'clock," Maxwell says, "the sun was setting, and his
last rays fell upon a dreadful spectacle: red masses of infantry
were advancing steadily across the plain; the horse artillery came
at a gallop to the front to open its fire upon the fugitives; the
Hussar Brigade was charging by the Camino Real."</p>

<p>Of the helpless encumbrances of the French army an eye-witness
said: "Behind them was the plain in which the city stood, and
beyond the city thousands of carriages and animals and
non-combatants, men, women, and children, were crowding together in
all the madness of terror; and as the English shot went booming
overhead the vast crowd started and swerved with a convulsive
movement, while a dull and horrid sound of distress arose."</p>

<p>Joseph now ordered the retreat to be conducted by the only road
left open&mdash;that to Pampeluna, but it was impossible to take
away his train of carriages. He, the king, only escaped capture by
jumping out of one door of his carriage as his pursuers reached the
other: he left his sword of state in it, and the beautiful
Correggio "Christ in the Garden," now at Apsley House, in
England.</p>

<p>Eighty pieces of cannon, jammed close together near Vittoria on
the only remaining defensible ridge near the town, had kept up a
desperate fire to the last, and Reille had held his ground near the
Zadora heroically, but it was useless. The great road to Bayonne
was lost, and finally that to Pampeluna was choked with broken-down
carriages. The British dragoons were pursuing hotly, and the
frantic French soldiers plunged into morasses, over fields and
hills, in the wildest rout, leaving their artillery,
ammunition-waggons, and the spoil of a kingdom.</p>

<p>The outskirts of Vittoria were strewn with the wreckage. Never
before in modern times had such a quantity of spoil fallen into the
hands of a victorious army. There were objects of interest from
museums, convents, and royal palaces; there were jewels of royal
worth and masterpieces of Titian, Raphael, and Correggio.</p>

<p>The marshal's baton belonging to Jourdan had been left, with one
hundred and fifty-one brass guns, four hundred and fifteen caissons
of ammunition, one million three hundred thousand ball cartridges,
fourteen thousand rounds of artillery ammunition, and forty
thousand pounds of gunpowder. Joseph's power was gone: he was only
a wretched fugitive. Six thousand of his men had been killed and
wounded, and one thousand were prisoners.</p>

<p>It has not been possible to estimate the value of the private
plunder, but five and a half millions of dollars in the military
chest of the army were taken, and untold quantities of private
wealth were also lost to their owners; it was all
scattered&mdash;shining heaps of gold and silver&mdash;over the
road, and the British soldiers reaped it. Wellington refused to
make any effort to induce his men to give up the enormous sums they
had absorbed: "They have earned it," he said. But he had reason to
regret it. They fell into frightful orgies of intemperance that
lasted for days. Wellington wrote Lord Bathurst, June 29:</p>

<p class="quote">"We started with the army in the highest order,
and up to the day of the battle nothing could get on better. But
that event has, as usual, totally annihilated all order and
discipline. The soldiers of the army have got among them about a
million sterling in money, with the exception of about one hundred
thousand dollars which were got in the military chest. I am
convinced that we have now out of our ranks double the amount of
our loss in the battle, and have lost more men in the pursuit than
the enemy have."</p>

<p>It was calculated that seven thousand five hundred men had
straggled from the effects of the plunder.</p>

<p>The convoys sent ahead by Joseph had contained some of the
choicest works of art; they reached France safely, and are
displayed in the museums of Paris. In justice to the Duke of
Wellington it must be said that he communicated with Ferdinand,
offering to restore the paintings which had fallen into his hands,
but Ferdinand desired him to keep them. The wives of the French
officers were sent on to Pampeluna the next day by Wellington, who
had treated them with great kindness.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the feminine army, the nuns, the actresses,
and the superbly arrayed others, they made their escape with
greater difficulties and hardships. Alison says: "Rich vestures of
all sorts, velvet and silk brocades, gold and silver plate, noble
pictures, jewels, laces, cases of claret and champagne, poodles,
parrots, monkeys, and trinkets lay scattered about the fields in
endless confusion, amidst weeping mothers, wailing infants, and all
the unutterable miseries of warlike overthrow."</p>

<p>Napoleon was filled with fury at his brother for the result of
Vittoria, but he instructed his ministers to say that "a somewhat
brisk engagement with the English took place at Vittoria in which
both sides lost equally. The French armies, however, carried out
the movements in which they were engaged, but the enemy seized
about one hundred guns which were left without teams at Vittoria,
and it is these that the English are trying to pass off as
artillery captured on the battlefield!"</p>

<p>One of the most important captures of the battle was a mass of
documents from the archives of Madrid, including a great part of
Napoleon's secret correspondence&mdash;an invaluable addition to
history.</p>

<p>Napier's summing up of the results of the battle reads:</p>

<p class="quote">"Joseph's reign was over; the crown had fallen
from his head. And, after years of toils and combats, which had
been rather admired than understood, the English general, emerging
from the chaos of the Peninsula struggle, stood on the summit of
the Pyrenees a recognised conqueror. From these lofty pinnacles the
clangour of his trumpets pealed clear and loud, and the splendour
of his genius appeared as a flaming beacon to warring nations."</p>

<p>However, Napier always was inclined to be eloquent. Perhaps it
was lucky for Wellington that the worthless make-trouble, Joseph
Bonaparte, had been in the place of his tremendous brother.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>THE SIEGE OF PLEVNA</h2>

<p>When the Russian army swarmed through the Shipka Pass of the
Balkans there was really nothing before it but a man and an
opportunity. Osman Pasha suddenly and with great dexterity took his
force into Plevna, a small Bulgarian town near the Russian line of
march.</p>

<p>The military importance of Plevna lay in the fact that this mere
village of seventeen hundred people was the junction of the roads
from Widin, Sophia, Biela, Zimnitza, Nikopolis, and the Shipka
Pass. Osman's move was almost entirely on his own initiative. He
had no great reputation, and, like Wellington in the early part of
the Peninsula campaign, he was obliged to do everything with the
strength of his own shoulders. The stupidity of his superiors
amounted almost to an oppression.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic2" id="pic2"></a><img alt="" src=
"1403061h-images/battles-2.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Osman Pasha in the Sortie from Plevna</b>
</p>

<p>The Russians recognised the strategic importance of Plevna a
moment too late. On July 18, 1877, General Krudener at Nikopolis
received orders to occupy Plevna at once. He seems to have moved
promptly, but long before he could arrive Osman's tired but dogged
battalions were already in the position.</p>

<p>The Turkish regular of that day must have resembled very closely
his fellow of the present. Von Moltke, who knew the Turks well, and
whose remarkable mind clearly outlined and prophesied the result of
several more recent Balkan campaigns, said, "An impetuous attack
may be expected from the Turks, but not an obstinate and lasting
defence." Historically, the opinion of the great German
field-marshal seems very curious. Even in the late war between
Greece and Turkey the attacks of the Turkish troops were usually
anything but impetuous. They were fearless, but very leisurely. As
to the lasting and obstinate defence, one has only to regard the
siege of Plevna to understand that Von Moltke was for the moment
writing carelessly.</p>

<p>After Plevna, the word went forth that the most valuable weapon
of the Turk was his shovel. When Osman arrived, the defences of
Plevna consisted of an ordinary block-house, but he at once set his
troops at work digging entrenchments and throwing up redoubts,
which were located with great skill. Soon the vicinity of the town
was one great fortress. Osman coolly was attempting to stem the
Russian invasion with a force of these strange Turkish troops,
patient, enduring, sweet-tempered, and ignorant, dressed in
slovenly overcoats and sheep-skin sandals, living on a diet of
black bread and cucumbers.</p>

<p>Receiving the order from the Grand Duke Nicolas, General
Krudener at Nikopolis despatched at dawn of the next day six
thousand five hundred men, with about seven batteries, to Plevna.
No effective scouting had been done. The Russian general,
Schilder&mdash;Schuldner, riding comfortably in his carriage in the
customary way of Russian commanders of the time, had absolutely no
information that a strong Turkish force had occupied the position.
His column had been allowed to distribute itself over a distance of
seventeen miles. On the morning of the 20th an attack was made with
great confidence by the troops which had come up. Two Russian
regiments even marched victoriously through the streets of Plevna,
throwing down their heavy packs and singing for joy of the easy
capture. But suddenly a frightful fusillade began from all sides.
The elated regiments melted in the streets. Infuriated by religious
ardour, despising the value of a Christian's life, the Turks poured
out from their concealed places, and there occurred a great
butchery. The Russian Nineteenth Regiment of the line was cut down
to a few fragments. Much artillery ammunition was captured. The
Russians lost two thousand seven hundred men. The knives of the
Circassians and Bashi&mdash;Bazouks had been busy in the
streets.</p>

<p>After this victory Osman might have whipped Krudener, but the
Russian leaders had been suddenly aroused to the importance of
taking Plevna, and Krudener was almost immediately reinforced with
three divisions. Within the circle of defence the Turk was using
his shovel. Osman gave the garrison no rest. If a man was not
shooting, he was digging. The well-known Grivitza Redoubt was
greatly strengthened, and some defences on the east side of the
town were completed. Osman's situation was desperate, but his duty
to his country was vividly defined. If he could hold this strong
Turkish force on the flank of the Russians, their advance on
Constantinople would hardly be possible. The Russian leaders now
thoroughly understood this fact, and they tried to make the army
investing Plevna more than a containing force.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicolas had decided to order an assault on the
30th of July. Krudener telegraphed&mdash;the grand duke was thirty
miles from Plevna&mdash;that he hesitated in his views of
prospective success. The grand duke replied sharply, ordering that
the assault be made. It seems that Krudener went into the field in
the full expectation of being beaten.</p>

<p>Now appears in the history of the siege a figure at once
sinister and foolish. Subordinate in command to Krudener was
Lieutenant-General Prince Schahofskoy, who had an acute sense of
his own intelligence, and in most cases dared to act independently
of the orders of his chief. But to offset him there suddenly
galloped into his camp a brilliant young Russian commander, a man
who has set his name upon Plevna, even as the word underlies the
towering reputation of Osman Pasha. General Skobeleff had come from
the Grand Duke Nicolas with an order directing Prince Schahofskoy
to place the young man in command of a certain brigade of Caucasian
Cossacks. The prince grew stormy with outraged pride, and
practically told Skobeleff to take the Cossacks and go to the devil
with them.</p>

<p>The Russians began a heavy bombardment, to which Osman's guns
replied with spirit. The key of the position was the Grivitza
Redoubt. Krudener himself attacked it with eighteen battalions of
infantry and ten batteries. And at the same time Prince Schahofskoy
thundered away on his side. The latter at last became furious at
Krudener's lack of success, and resolved to take matters into his
own hands. In the afternoon he advanced with three brigades in the
face of a devastating Turkish fire, took a hill, and forced the
Turks to vacate their first line of entrenchments. His men were
completely spent with weariness, and it is supposed that he should
have waited on the hill for support from Krudener. But he urged on
his tired troops and carried a second position. The Turkish
batteries now concentrated their fire upon his line, and, really,
the Turkish infantry whipped him soundly.</p>

<p>The Russians did not give up the dearly bought gain of ground
without desperate fighting. Again and again they furiously charged,
but only to meet failure. When night fell, the stealthy-footed
irregular of the Turkish forces crept through the darkness to prey
upon the route of the Russian retreat. The utter annihilation of
Prince Schahofskoy's force was prevented by Skobeleff and the
brigade of Cossacks with which the prince had sent him to the
devil. Skobeleff's part in this assault was really a matter of
clever manoeuvring.</p>

<p>Krudener had failed with gallantry and intelligence. Schahofskoy
had failed through pigheadedness and self-confidence.</p>

<p>After this attempt to carry Plevna, the important Russian
generals occupied themselves in mutual recriminations. Krudener
bitterly blamed Schahofskoy for not obeying his orders, and
Schahofskoy acidulously begged to know why Krudener had not
supported him. At the same time they both claimed that the Grand
Duke Nicolas, thirty miles away, should never have given an order
for an assault on a position of which he had never had a view.</p>

<p>But even if Russian clothing and arms and trinkets were being
sold for a pittance in the bazaars of Plevna, the mosques were
jammed with wounded Turks, and such was the suffering that the dead
in the streets and in the fields were being gnawed by the pervasive
Turkish dog.</p>

<p>A few days later Osman Pasha received the first proper
recognition from Constantinople. A small troop of cavalry had
wormed its way into Plevna. It was headed by an aide-de-camp of the
Sultan. In gorgeous uniform the aide appeared to Osman and
presented him with the First Order of the Osmanli, the highest
Turkish military decoration. And with this order came a sword, the
hilt of which flamed with diamonds. Osman Pasha may have preferred
a bushel of cucumbers, but at any rate he knew that the Sultan and
Turkey at last understood the value of a good soldier. To the
speech of the aide Osman replied with another little speech, and
the soldiers in their entrenchments cheered the Sultan.</p>

<p>On August 31 the Turkish general made his one offensive move. He
threw part of his force against a Russian redoubt and was obliged
to retire with a loss of nearly three thousand men. Afterwards he
devoted his troops mainly to the business of improving the
defences. He wasted no more in attempts to break out of Plevna.</p>

<p>At this late day of the siege, Prince Charles of Roumania was
appointed to the chief command of the whole Russo-Roumanian army.
But naturally this office was nominal. General Totoff had the real
disposition of affairs, but he did not hold it very long. General
Levitsky, the assistant chief of the Russian general staff, arrived
to advise General Totoff under direct orders from the Grand Duke
Nicolas. But this siege was to be very well generalled.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicolas himself came to Plevna. One would think
that the grand duke would have ended this kaleidoscopic row of
superseding generals. But the Great White Czar himself appeared.
Osman Pasha, shut up in Plevna, certainly was honoured with a great
deal of distinguished interest.</p>

<p>However, Alexander I I. did his best to give no orders. He had
no illusions concerning his military knowledge. With a spirit
profoundly kind and gentle, he simply prayed that no more lives
would be lost. It is difficult to think what he had to say to his
multitudinous generals, each of whom was the genius of the only
true plan for capturing Plevna.</p>

<p>At daylight on the 7th of September the Turks saw that the
entire army of the enemy had closed in upon them. Amid fields of
ripening grain shone the smart red jackets of the hussars. The
Turks saw the Bulgarians in sheepskin caps, and with their broad
scarlet sashes stuck full of knives and pistols. They saw the queer
round oilskin shakoes of the Cossacks and the greatcoats of thick
gray blanketing. They saw the uniforms of the Russian infantry, the
green tunics striped with red. For five days the smoke lay heavy
over Plevna.</p>

<p>The 11th was the fte-day of the emperor, and the general
assault on that day was arranged as if it had been part of a fte.
The cannonade was to begin at daybreak along the whole line and
stop at eight o'clock in the morning. The artillery was to play
again from eleven o'clock until one o'clock. Then it was to play
again from half-past two o'clock to three o'clock.</p>

<p>Directly afterwards the Roumanian allies of the Russians moved
in three columns against the Grivitza Redoubt. At first all three
were repulsed, but with the stimulus of Russian reinforcements they
rallied, and after a long time of almost hand-to-hand fighting the
evening closed with them in possession of what was called the key
of the Plevna position. They had lost four thousand men. The
victory was fruitless, as, anticipating the attack on Grivitza,
Osman had caused the building of an inner redoubt. After all their
ferocious charging, the Russians were really no nearer to
success.</p>

<p>At three o'clock of that afternoon Redoubt Number Ten had been
assailed by General Schmidnikoff. The firing had been terrible, but
the Russians had charged to the very walls of the redoubt. The
Turks not only beat them off, but pursued with great spirit. Two of
the scampering Russian battalions were then faced about to beat off
the chase. They lay down at a distance of only two hundred yards of
the redoubt, and sent the Turks pell-mell back into their
fortifications.</p>

<p>At about the same time Skobeleff, wearing a white coat and
mounted on a white charger, was leading his men over the "green
hills" towards the Krishin Redoubt. There was a dense fog.
Skobeleff's troops crossed two ridges and waded a stream. They
began the ascent of a steep slope. Suddenly the fog cleared; the
sun shone out brilliantly. The closely massed Russian force was
exposed at short range to line after line of Turkish entrenchments.
They retired once, but rallied splendidly, and before five o'clock
Skobeleff found himself in possession of Redoubt Number Eleven and
Redoubt Number Twelve.</p>

<p>His battalions were thrust like a wedge into the Turkish lines,
but the Turkish commander appreciated the situation more clearly
than any Russian save Skobeleff. The latter's men suffered a
frightful fire. Reinforcements were refused. All during the night
the faithful troops of the czar fought in darkness and without
hope. They even built little ramparts of dead men. But on the
morning of September 12 Skobeleff was compelled to give up all he
had gained. The retreat over the "green hills" was little more than
a running massacre.</p>

<p>After his return Skobeleff was in a state of excitement and
fury. His uniform was covered with blood and mud. His Cross of St.
George was twisted around over his shoulder. His face was black
with powder. His eyes were bloodshot. He said, "My regiments no
longer exist."</p>

<p>The Russian assaults had failed at all points. They had begun
this last battle with thirty thousand infantry, twelve thousand
cavalry, and four hundred and forty guns, and they lost over
eighteen thousand men. The multitude of generals again took
counsel. There were fervid animosities, and there might have been
open rupture if it were not for the presence of the czar himself,
whose gentleness and good-nature prevented many scenes.</p>

<p>It was decided that the Turks must be starved out. The Russians
sent for more troops as well as for heavy supplies of clothing,
ammunition, and food. The czar sent for General Todleben, who had
shown great skill at Sebastopol, and the direction of the siege was
put in his hands.</p>

<p>The Turks had been accustomed to reprovision Plevna by the
skilful use of devious trails. Todleben took swift steps to put a
stop to it, but he did not succeed before a huge convoy had been
sent into the town through the adroit management of Chefket Pasha.
But the Russian horse soon chased Chefket away, and the trails were
all closed.</p>

<p>For the most part the Septemberweather was fine, but this
plenitude of sun made the Turkish positions about Plevna almost
unbearable. Actual thousands of unburied dead lay scattered over
the ridges. At one time the Russian headquarters made a polite
request to be allowed to send some men to enter Grivitza and bury
their own dead. But this polite request met with polite
refusal.</p>

<p>On October 19 the Roumanians, who for weeks had been sapping
their way up to the Grivitza Redoubt, made a final and desperate
attack on it. They were repulsed.</p>

<p>In order to complete the investment, Todleben found it necessary
to dislodge the Turks from four villages near Plevna.</p>

<p>The weeks moved by slowly with a stolid and stubborn Turk
besieged by a stubborn and stolid Russian. There was occasional
firing from the Russian batteries, to which the Turks did not
always take occasion to reply. In Plevna there was nothing to eat
but meat, and the Turkish soldiers moved about with the hoods of
their dirty brown cloaks pulled over their heads. Outside Plevna
there were plenty of furs and good coats, but the diet had become
so plain that the sugar-loving Russian soldiers would give gold for
a pot of jam.</p>

<p>On the cold, cloudy morning of December 11, when snow lay
thickly on all the country, a sudden great booming of guns was
heard, and the news flew swiftly that Osman had come out of Plevna
at last, and was trying to break through the cordon his foes had
spread about him. During the night he had abandoned all his
defences, and by daybreak he had taken the greater part of his army
across the river Vid. Advancing along the Sophia road, he charged
the Russian entrenchments with such energy that the Siberian
Regiment stationed at that point was almost annihilated. A
desperate fight went on for four hours, with the Russians coming up
battalion after battalion. Some time after noon all firing ceased,
and later the Turks sent up a white flag. Cheer after cheer swelled
over the dreary plain. Osman had surrendered.</p>

<p>The siege had lasted one hundred and forty-two days. The
Russians had lost forty thousand men. The Turks had lost thirty
thousand men.</p>

<p>The advance on Constantinople had been checked. Skobeleff said,
"Osman the Victorious he will remain, in spite of his
surrender."</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>THE STORMING OF BUR KERSDOR

<p>When, in 1740, Wilhelm Friedrich of Prussia died, the friends

such as had not been known since Poins and Falstaff congratulated

<p>When the young prince came to the throne as Frederick II.,

<p class="caption"><b>Frederick The Great at Burkersdorf</b>
</p>

<p>They had the best of reasons for this belief: the antagonism
between the prince and his father had begun almost as soon as the
rapture of having an heir had become an old story to Friedrich
Wilhelm. The tiny "Fritz," with a cocked hat and tight little
soldier-clothes, drilling and being drilled with a lot of other
tiny boys,&mdash;and frightfully bored with it all the
time,&mdash;was a standing grievance to his rough, boorish father.
"Awake him at six in the morning, and stand by to see that he does
not turn over, but immediately gets up...While his hair is being
combed and made into a queue, he is to have his breakfast of tea."
This was the beginning of his father's instructions to his tutors
when, at seven, he passed out of his governess's hands.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fine Spartan rigour of this programme, the
boy came up a dainty, delicate little fellow, who turned up his
nose at boar-hunting and despised his father's collection of
giants, and loved to play the flute and make French verses.
Friedrich Wilhelm was anything but a bad monarch; he was moral in a
century when nothing of the sort was expected of monarchs; he made
the Prussian army the best army in the world; he even had
affections; but for a man of these virtues he was the most
intolerable parent of whom there is a record.</p>

<p>The brilliant Wilhelmina, Frederick's dearly loved sister, whose
young portraits show her as very like her brother, has this
characteristic scene in her <i>Memoirs.</i> Their sister, Princess
Louisa, aged fifteen, had just been betrothed to a margrave, and
the king asked her&mdash;they were at table&mdash;how she would
regulate her housekeeping when she was married. Louisa, a
favourite, had got into the way of telling her father home-truths,
which he took very well, as a rule, from her. On this occasion she
told him that she would have a good table well served; "better than
yours," said Louisa; "and if I have children, I will not maltreat
them like you, nor force them to eat what they have an aversion
to." "What do you mean by that?" said the king. "What is there
wanting at my table?" "There is this wanting," she replied: "that
one cannot have enough, and the little there is consists of coarse
potherbs that nobody can eat." The king, who was not used to such
candour, boiled with rage. "All his anger," says the Princess
Wilhelmina, "fell on my brother and me. He first threw a plate at
my brother's head, who ducked out of the way, then let fly another
at me." After he had made the air blue with wrath, directed at
Frederick, "we had to pass him in going out," and "he aimed a great
blow at me with his crutch,&mdash;which, if I had not jerked away
from it, would have ended me. He chased me for a while in his
wheelchair, but the people drawing it gave me time to escape into
the queen's chamber."</p>

<p>One always imagines this charming young princess in the act of
dodging some sort of blow from Friedrich Wilhelm, who was nicknamed
"Stumpy," privately, by his dutiful son and daughter. The habit of
hating his son became an insanity; to kick him and pull his hair,
break his flute, and take away his books and his brocaded
dressing-gown&mdash;that was ordinary usage; it came to the point
where he nearly strangled him, and later he condemned him to death
for trying to run away to his uncle, George II., in England. When
this sentence had been changed to a term of imprisonment, the poor
young prince had a much better time of it: his gaolers were kinder
than his father.</p>

<p>By the time he emerged from this captivity he had gained much
wisdom&mdash;the cold wisdom of selfishness and dissimulation. In
after years the father and son became profoundly attached to each
other, but Frederick was always obliged to humour and cajole his
pig-headed sire, to lie more or less, and generally adopt an
insincere tone, in order to avert wrath and suspicion&mdash;a very
hateful necessity to a natural truth-teller, for Frederick was by
nature a great lover of facts. Although his training as a
politician and a soldier included a thorough education in guile,
the tutors of his childhood were simple, honest people, who gave
him a good, truthful start in life.</p>

<p>Friedrich Wilhelm, now that his heir was twenty-one years old,
thought it high time to put an end to various vague matrimonial
projects, and get a wife for him straightway. Frederick having
found that obedience was, on the whole, better than captivity, was
submissive and silent&mdash;to his father; but his letters to his
friends and his sister shrieked with protestations against a
marriage in which his tastes and feelings were not so much as
thought of. Above all things he wished to be allowed to travel and
choose for himself, and he had a morbid horror of a dull and
awkward woman. It did not much matter, he thought, what else his
wife was if she were clever conversationally, with grace and charm
and fine manners. Beauty was desirable, but he could get along
without it, if only he could feel proud of his consort's wit and
breeding. The bride of his father's choosing was the Princess
Elizabeth of Brunswick-Bevern&mdash;a bashful and gawky young
person, with as little distinction as a dairy-maid. But he subdued
his rage and married her, and, indeed, seems always to have treated
her with kindly deference, although he made no pretence of
affection.</p>

<p>Still carrying out his father's wishes, he served in a brief
campaign, and afterwards regularly devoted a portion of his time to
military and political business. Friedrich Wilhelm was now pleased
with his son to the extent of buying for him a delightful
residence&mdash;Reinsberg&mdash;and giving him a tolerable income;
and Frederick revelled in his new freedom by building
conservatories, laying out pleasure-gardens, playing his flute to
his heart's content, writing poor French verses, and solacing
himself for the "coarse potherbs" of his childhood by exquisite
dinners. They had the best musicians for their concerts at
Reinsbergthe crown prince and his friends, with the crown princess
and her ladies. It was here, in 1736, that Frederick began&mdash;by
letter&mdash;his famous friendship with Voltaire, that survived so
many phases of illusion and disillusion.</p>

<p>It must be said of Frederick's friends&mdash;who were mostly
French&mdash;that they were men of highly trained intelligence, but
they were not acute enough to know what sort of king their prince
would make.</p>

<p>When his father passed away, Frederick felt as sincere a grief
as if there had never been anything but love between them; always
afterwards he spoke of him with reverence, and he learned to place
a high value on the stern discipline of his early life&mdash;which
is still to some extent a model for the bringing up of young
Hohenzollerns.</p>

<p>It was a handsome young king who came to the throne in 1740. His
face was round, his nose a keen aquiline, his mouth small and
delicately curved, and all was dominated by those wonderful
blue-gray eyes, that, as Mirabeau said, "at the bidding of his
heroic soul fascinated you with seduction or with terror." Even in
youth the lines of the face showed a sardonic humour. One can well
imagine his replying to the optimistic Sulzer, who thought severe
punishments a mistake: "Ach! meine lieber Sulzer, you don't know
this&mdash;race!" In the old-age portraits the face is sharp and
hatchet-like, the mouth is shrunken to a mean line, but the great
eyes still flash out, commanding and clear.</p>

<p>The reign began with peace and philanthropy: Frederick II.
started out by disbanding the giant grenadiers, the absurd
monstrosities that his father had begged and bought and kidnapped
from everywhere; he started a "knitting-house" for a thousand old
women; abolished torture in criminal trials; set up an Academy of
Sciences; summoned Voltaire and Maupertius; made Germany open its
eyes at the speech, "In this country every man must get to Heaven
in his own way;" and proclaimed a practical freedom of the
press&mdash;all in his first week.</p>

<p>The fury of activity now took possession of Frederick, which
lasted all his life. He had the Hohenzollern passion for doing
everything himself: the three "secretaries of state" were mere
clerks, who spared him only the mechanical part of secretarial
duties. His system of economy was rigid. While looking over
financial matters one day he found that a certain convent absorbed
a considerable fund from the forest-dues, which had been bequeathed
by dead dukes "for masses to be said on their behalf." He went to
the place and asked the monks, "What good does anybody get out of
those masses?" "Your majesty, the dukes are to be delivered out of
purgatory by them." "Purgatory? And they are not out yet, poor
souls, after so many hundred years of praying?" The answer was,
"Not yet." "When will they be out, and the thing settled?" There
was no answer to this. "Send me a courier whenever they are out!"
With this sneer the king left the convent.</p>

<p>Stern business went on all day, and in the evening, music,
dancing, theatres, suppers, till all hours; but the king was up
again at four in the summer&mdash;five in winter. In early youth
Frederick had known a period of gross living, from which he
suffered so severely that his reaction from it was fiercely
austere. After his accession, a young man who had been associated
with this "mud-bath," as Carlyle has named it, begged an audience.
The king received him, but rebuked him with such withering speech
that he straightway went home and killed himself.</p>

<p>Only five months of his reign had passed when the event occurred
that put an end to the ideal monarch of Frederick's subjects.
Charles VI., Emperor of Germany, was dead. For years he had worked
to bind together his scattered and wabbling empire, and by his
"Pragmatic Sanction" secure it to his daughter, Maria Theresa,
contrary to the rule that only male heirs should succeed, and she
was on the day of his death (October 20) proclaimed empress.</p>

<p>If the young Maria Theresa had been married to the young Prince
Frederick of Prussia, as their reigning parents had at one time
decided, European history would undoubtedly have been different,
though historians may be mistaken in thinking that much trouble
would have been saved the world. In view of the fact that both
these young people were extravagantly well endowed with the royal
gifts of energy and decision, one must be permitted to wonder
whether Frederick, as the spouse of the admirable Maria Theresa,
would have ever become known as "the Great." But at all events it
would have prevented him from rushing in on her domains and seizing
Silesia as soon as she was left with no one but her husband&mdash;a
man of the kindly inert sort&mdash;to protect her; and we should
have lost the good historical scene of Maria Theresa appearing
before her Hungarian Diet, with the crown on her beautiful head,
thrilling every heart as she lifted her plump baby, Francis Joseph,
and with tears streaming down her face implored its help against
the Prussian robber.</p>

<p>We can still hear the thunderous roar of the loyal reply, "We
will die for our sovereign, Maria Theresa!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, by December the Prussian robber was in Silesia
with thirty thousand men, engaged in finding out that he was really
made to be a warrior. By May he held every fortified place in the
province; by June Maria Theresa was forced to cede it to
him&mdash;since which time it has always been a loyal part of
Prussia.</p>

<p>"How glorious is my king, the youngest of the kings and the
grandest!" chanted Voltaire in a letter to Frederick, who, one is
pleased to know, found the praise rather suffocating.</p>

<p>The genius of Frederick was next put to a considerable test in
the way of matchmaking&mdash;a delicate art, particularly when
practised for the sake of providing the half-barbarous empire of
Russia with mated rulers.</p>

<p>The Czarina Elizabeth&mdash;Great Peter's daughter&mdash;wished
the king to find a German bride for her nephew-heir, who was
afterwards Peter III. A true Hohenzollern, Frederick felt himself
quite equal to this task&mdash;as to any other. From a bevy of
young princesses he selected the daughter of the poverty-stricken
Prince of Anhalt-Herbst, because of the unmistakable cleverness the
girl had shown, though not fifteen. She was handsome as well, and
Elizabeth renamed her "Catherine," changed her religion, and the
marriage came off in 1745. Frederick had displayed great acumen,
but it would puzzle a fiend to contrive a more diabolical union
than that of Peter and Catherine!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Maria Theresa had been preparing to fight for Silesia
again. Without waiting for her, Frederick pounced upon Prague and
captured it. After her armies in Silesia and Saxony had been put to
flight by her adversary, at Hohenfriedberg and Sorr, and
Hennersdorf and Kesselsdorf, the empress yielded. On Christmas Day,
1745, when the treaty was signed that gave Silesia again to
Prussia,&mdash;it was known as the Peace of Dresden,&mdash;Berlin
went wild, and for the first time shouts were heard among the
revellers, "Vivat Friedrich <i>der Grosse</i>!" The Austrians might
call him "that ferocious, false, ambitious king of Prussia," but as
a matter of fact he was not more false and ferocious than the other
rulers, only infinitely more able. Frederick had made for himself a
great name and raised his little kingdom&mdash;of only two and a
half millions of people&mdash;to a noble standing among nations.
The eyes of the world were fixed upon the hero to see what he would
do next. What he did was to swear that he "would not fight with a
cat again," and to build himself a charming country home&mdash;his
palaces, and even Reinsberg, were too large. In May, 1747, he had
his housewarming at little Sans Souci, where for the next forty
years most of his time was spent. There were twenty boxes of German
flutes in the king's cabinet at Sans Souci, and infinite boxes of
Spanish snuff; and there were three arm-chairs for three favourite
dogs, with low stools to make an easy step for them. There was
another favourite at Sans Souci who was said to look like an ape,
although he was mostly called the "skinny Apollo." How one would
like to have seen the king walking the terraces, with "white shoes
and stockings and red breeches, with gown and waistcoat of blue
linen flowered and lined with yellow!" while men with powdered wigs
and highly coloured clothes, and women whose heads bore high towers
of hair unpleasantly stuffed and decorated with inconsequent dabs
of finery, followed him, all talking epigrams and doing
attitudes&mdash;polite people had to hold themselves in curves in
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>These were good years for Prussia: her law courts were reformed;
her commerce flourished, and so did agriculture; potatoes were
introduced&mdash;they were at first considered poisonous; a huge
amount of building was done, and the army was drilled constantly
under Frederick's eyes. Each year saw it a better army; its chief
must have known that he was preparing for the great struggle of his
life, although he took as keen an interest in keeping up the high
standard of his new opera-house in Berlin, both as to music and
ballet, as he did in the skilfullest manoeuvres of his troops.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa had never for a moment given up Silesia in her
heart. She was a woman of austere virtues, but these did not stand
in the way of schemes which she would have thought too despicable
to be used against any one but the King of Prussia. The Czarina of
Russia had been made to hate him by a series of carefully-devised
plots,&mdash;she looked on him as her arch-enemy,&mdash;and within
six months after the Peace of Dresden she had signed, with Maria
Theresa, a treaty which actually proposed the partitioning of
Frederick's kingdom, which was to be divided between Russia,
Austria, and Poland, while he was to become a simple Margrave of
Brandenburg!</p>

<p>To get the signature of Louis XV. involved harder work still for
the virtuous empress&mdash;but she did it. It was to ask it of the
Pompadour&mdash;in various affectionate letters, beginning "My dear
cousin," or "Madame, my dearest sister." The Pompadour was also
shown some stinging verses of Frederick's with herself as subject,
and she (representing France) became the firm ally of Maria
Theresa.</p>

<p>Through an Austrian clerk's treachery Frederick became aware of
this stupendous conspiracy against him&mdash;but not till 1755,
when it was well matured. It seemed incredible that he could think
of keeping these great countries from gobbling up his little state.
He could not have done it, indeed, if it had not been for a certain
Englishman. It was an Englishman who saved Frederick and
Prussia&mdash;the "Great Commoner," Pitt, who, having on hand a
French war of his own, raised a Hanoverian army to help himself and
Frederick, and granted him a welcome subsidy of six hundred and
seventy thousand pounds a year.</p>

<p>His ten years' drilling had given Frederick a fine army of one
hundred and thirty thousand men. The infantry were said to excel
all others in quickness of manoeuvres and skilled shooting, while
the cavalry was unsurpassed.</p>

<p>Frederick, without waiting for his foes to declare war and mass
their mighty forces, began it by a stealthy, sudden move into
Saxony in September 1756. October 1, at Lowositz, in Bohemia, he
defeated von Browne, and, returning, captured the Saxon force of
seventeen thousand, and took them bodily&mdash;all but the
officers&mdash;into his own army.</p>

<p>England was delighted with this masterly act of her ally. He was
known there as "the Protestant hero," which was not quite true to
facts. Certainly Frederick protested against the old religion, but
he was far from being on with the new one. His saying, "Every one
shall go to heaven in the way he chooses," had been applauded in
England, but they were not familiar with his reply when a squabble
as to whether one or another set of hymn-books should be used was
referred to him: "Bah! let them sing what tomfoolery they like,"
said the "Protestant hero." Had France and Austria, however,
succeeded in obliterating Prussia, it is likely that Protestantism
too would have been done for in Germany.</p>

<p>Frederick having himself begun the Seven Years' War, the
confederated German states, with Russia, France, and Sweden,
formally bound themselves to "reduce the House of Brandenburg to
its former state of mediocrity," France&mdash;very rich
then&mdash;paying enormous subsidies all around. England&mdash;with
Hanover&mdash;alone espoused Prussia's cause. During 1757, four
hundred and thirty-seven thousand men were put in the field against
Frederick. Only his cat-like swiftness saved him from being
overwhelmed again and again. In April he made another
rush&mdash;like an avalanche&mdash;on Bohemia, and won another
great victory at Prague, but he was terribly beaten by General Daun
in June at Kolin. Still he kept up courage, and played the flute
and wrote innumerable French verses of the usual poor quality in
odd moments. In November, at Rossbach, he met an army of French and
Imperialists over twice as large as his own, and by a swift,
unexpected movement broke them, so that they were scattered all
over the country. Every German felt proud of this French defeat,
whether he were Prussian or not. It was the first time the
invincible French had ever been beaten by a wholly German army,
with a leader of German blood. The brilliant victory of Leuthen
followed Rossbach.</p>

<p>But although the world was ringing with Frederick's name, and he
was acknowledged to be one of the greatest generals of history, the
resources of his powerful enemies were too many for him. At last it
seemed that a ruinous cloud of disaster was closing around him and
darkening the memory of his glorious successes.</p>

<p>The defeat of Kunersdorf in 1759 would have completely wiped out
his army if the over-cautious Austrian General Daun had followed up
his victory. "Is there no cursed bullet that can reach me!" the
Prussian monarch was heard to murmur in a stupor of despair after
the battle. He carried poison about him, after this, to use when
affairs became too bad. A severe blow followed
Kunersdorf,&mdash;George II. died in October 1760; George III. put
an end to Pitt's ministry&mdash;and this was the end of England's
support.</p>

<p>The winter of 1761-1762 saw Frederick at his lowest ebb.
England's money had stopped; his own country, plundered, devastated
in every direction, afforded no sufficient revenue. Fully half of
the Prussian dominions were occupied by the enemy; men, horses,
supplies, and transport could hardly be procured. The Prussian army
was reduced to sixty thousand men, and its ranks were made up
largely of vagabonds and deserters&mdash;the old, splendidly
disciplined troops having been practically obliterated.</p>

<p>He played no more on his flute&mdash;poor Frederick! At Leipzig
an old friend sighed to him, "Ach! how lean your majesty has
grown!" "Lean, ja wohl," he replied; "and what wonder, with three
women [Pompadour, Maria Theresa, and Czarina Elizabeth] hanging to
my throat all this while!"</p>

<p>The Allies felt that it was only a matter of a short time before
they should see their great enemy humbled to the position of
Elector of Brandenburg. From this abasement Frederick was suddenly
saved in January 1762. Life held another chance for him. The
implacable old czarina was dead; her heir, Peter III., was not
merely the friend, but the enthusiastic adorer of Frederick of
Prussia. Although thirty-four years old and the husband of
Catherine (the young lady Frederick had taken such pains to select
for him so many years ago), Peter had been kept out of public
affairs as if he were a child. Neither he nor Catherine was allowed
to leave the palace without permission of the czarina; they were
surrounded with spies, and kept in a gaudy and dirty
semi-imprisonmentthe traditional style for heirs to the Russian
throne. Under this system they became masters of deceit. Catherine,
in her cleverly unpleasant <i>Memoirs,</i> tells how they managed
to escape and visit people without being found out; how she, when
ill and in bed, had a joyous company with her, who huddled behind a
screen when prying ladies-in-waiting entered. But the most painful
part is the account of Peter, who seems to have had more
versatility in hateful ways than any one outside of Bedlam. Crazily
vivacious over foolish games, brutal when drunk, and silly when
sober, one wonders how for so many years Catherine endured him.</p>

<p>There was a saving grace, though, in him: he worshipped the King
of Prussia.</p>

<p>Frederick adroitly rose to the occasion: releasing all his
Russian prisoners, he sent them, well clad and provisioned, back to
their country. On February 23 the czar responded by a public
declaration of peace with Prussia and a renunciation of all
conquests made during the war. His general, Czernichef, was ordered
to put himself and his twenty thousand men at the disposal of the
Prussian hero, and on May 5 a treaty of alliance between Prussia
and Russia was announced&mdash;to the horror and disgust of France
and Austria. They had relied on Czernichef, but Czernichef himself
was a sincere admirer of his new commander-in-chief and delighted
in the change. The Russian soldiers all shared this feeling: they
called Frederick "Son of the lightning."</p>

<p>The French were being held by the Hanoverian army; Sweden had
retired from the war; with Russia on his side, Frederick felt that
he might hold out against Austria till peace was declared by the
powers&mdash;peace with no provision made for the partition of his
kingdom.</p>

<p>In planning his next campaign&mdash;the last of the war&mdash;it
was evident to Frederick that nothing could be done without
recapturing the fortress of Schweidnitz, recently captured by
Loudon, the Austrian general. The Austrians held all Silesia, and
they must be put out of it, but with Schweidnitz in their hands
this was impossible.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Frederick, Daun was appointed commander-in-chief
of the Austrians, the general who had been execrated throughout the
empire for his failure to follow up Frederick after Kunersdorf. In
mid-May Daun took command of the forces in Silesia, and with an
army of seventy thousand men made haste to place himself in a
strong position among rugged hills to guard Schweidnitz.
Schweidnitz, with a garrison of twelve thousand picked men and firm
defences, it was impossible to attack while Daun was there.
Frederick made repeated efforts to force Daun to give up his hold
on the fortress, threatening his left wing, as his right wing
seemed impregnably situated; but Daun, although forced to change
his position from time to time, kept firmly massed about
Schweidnitz. Frederick at last, then, resolved to attempt the
impossible, and, his forces now augmented by Czernichef's to
eighty-one thousand, determined on storming the Heights of
Burkersdorf, where Daun's right wing was firmly entrenched. The
last of Frederick's notable battles of the war,&mdash;a conflict
upon which the destinies of Prussia turned,&mdash;it was planned
and executed by him with a consummate brightness and cleverness
that more than justifies the Hohenzollern worship of their great
ancestor.</p>

<p>Burkersdorf Height, near the village of the same name, which was
also occupied by Daun, lies parallel to Kunersdorf Heights, where
Frederick's army lay. It is a high hill, very steep, and half
covered with rugged underbrush on the side next to Frederick's
position, and Prince de Ligne and General O'Kelly&mdash;serving
under Daun&mdash;had made it bristle with guns. Artillery was
Daun's specialty; his guns were thick wherever the ground was not
impractically steep, and palisades&mdash;"the pales strong as masts
and room only for a musket-barrel between"&mdash;protected the
soldiery; they were even "furnished with a lath or cross-strap all
along for resting the gun-barrel on and taking aim." In fact,
Burkersdorf Height was as good as a fortress. East of it was a
small valley where strong entrenchments had been made and batteries
placed. Farther east, two other heights had to be
captured,&mdash;they were also well defended,&mdash;Ludwigsdorf and
Leuthmannsdorf.</p>

<p>By the 17th of July Frederick had all his plans matured, and had
made his very first move&mdash;that is, he had sent Generals
Mllendorf and Wied on a march with their men to put the enemy on a
false scent&mdash;when he received a call from Czernichef at his
headquarters. It was paralysing news that Czernichef brought:
Peter, the providential friend, had been dethroned by the partisans
of his clever wife, Catherine.</p>

<p>After a reign of six months the young czar had completely
disgusted his subjects: he had planned ambitious schemes of reform,
and at the same time had made despotic encroachments. After
delighting the Church with important concessions, he proposed
virtually to take away all its lands and houses. He overdid
everything, like the madman he was. He offended his army by
dressing up his guards in Prussian uniforms and teaching them the
Prussian drill, while he wore constantly the dress of a Prussian
colonel, and sang the praises of our hero until his people were
sick of the name of "my friend, the King of Prussia."</p>

<p>Russian morals in the eighteenth century were like snakes in
Ireland&mdash;there were none. In this respect Catherine was not
superior to her husband, but in mental gifts she was an
extraordinary young woman. Her tact, her poise, her intelligence,
would have made a noble character in a decent atmosphere. Peter had
recognised her powers and relied on them, and she had endured him
all these years, thinking she would one day rule Russia as his
empress. But since his accession he had been completely under the
dominion of the Countess Woronzow, a vicious creature, who meant to
be Catherine's successor. And Catherine, when Peter threatened her
and her son Paul with lifelong imprisonment, had on her side
finally begun a plot, which resulted in her appealing to the
guards, much as Maria Theresa had appealed to her Diet of Hungary.
Every one was tired of Peter, and no voice was raised against his
deposition, whereupon Catherine assumed the sovereignty of Russia,
to the great relief and satisfaction of all Russians. The brutal
assassination of poor Peter by Catherine's friends&mdash;not by her
orders&mdash;followed in a few days.</p>

<p>It was the intention of Catherine, on beginning her reign, to
restore Elizabeth's policy in Russian matters and recommence
hostilities against Frederick; but on looking' over Peter's papers
she found that Frederick had discouraged his wild schemes, and that
he had begged him to rely on his wife and respect her counsels, and
this produced a revulsion of feeling. She resolved that she would
not fight him; nor, on the other hand, would she be his ally; the
secret message that had come to Czernichef, and which he
communicated to Frederick, was that Catherine reigned, and that he,
her general, was ordered to return immediately to St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>One can only guess at Frederick's emotions at this news. Life
must have seemed a lurid melodrama, presenting one hideous act
after another. "This is not living," he said; "this is being killed
a thousand times a day!" On the eve of the attack on Burkersdorf
his ally had been taken away from him; his own forces were now
weaker than those of Daun, and he did not see his way to a
victory.</p>

<p>But the genius of Frederick could not allow him to give in to
the destinies. His resourcefulness came to his rescue. He simply
begged Czernichef to stay with him for three days. Three days must
elapse before his official commands came. Frederick, with all the
potency of his personal fascination, implored the Russian during
that time to keep the matter secret, and, without one hostile act
against the enemy, to <i>seem</i> to act with him as though their
relations were unchanged. Czernichef consented; it was one of the
most devoted acts that was ever done by a man for pure friendship;
he well knew, and so did Frederick, that he might lose his head or
rot in a dungeon for it, but his own heroism was great enough to
make the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The drama accordingly went on. On the evening of the 20th, with
the forces of Mllendorf and Wied, who had puzzled the enemy and
returned, with Ziethen and Czernichef,&mdash;this last, of course,
only for show,&mdash;Frederick silently marched into Burkersdorf
village and took by storm the old Burkersdorf Castle,&mdash;an
affair of a few hours,&mdash;while Daun's forces fled in all
directions from the village. Then, through the night, trenches were
dug and batteries built&mdash;forty guns well placed. At sunrise
the whole Prussian army could be seen to be in motion by their
opponents.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Frederick's famous cannonade began, concentrated
upon the principal height of Burkersdorf. General O'Kelly's men
were too high to be reached by the cannon, but it was Frederick's
object to keep a furious, confusing noise going on, to help to draw
attention from Wied and Mllendorf, who were doing the real
fighting of the day. Mllendorf was to storm O'Kelly's height, and
Wied the Ludwigsdorf height beyond; but Frederick had arranged a
spectacular drama by which the foe was to be deceived as to these
intentions. It was not for nothing that Frederick had personally
overlooked his theatres and operas all these years. His knowledge
of scenic displays and their effect on the minds of an audience
stood him in good stead this day.</p>

<p>The Prussian guns continued a deafening roar, hour after hour,
with many blank charges, and the bewildered commanders of the
allied Austrians watched from their elevation the small man on his
white horse giving orders right and left. He wore a three-cornered
hat with a white feather, a plain blue uniform with red facings, a
yellow waistcoat liberally powdered with Spanish snuff, black
velvet breeches, and high soft boots. They were shabby old clothes,
but the figure had a majesty that every one recognised. The
difficulty among the officers on the heights was to find out what
were the orders Frederick was giving so freely. His generals, who
were much smarter in their dress than he, dashed off in all
directions, and marched their troops briskly about, keeping the
whole line of the enemy on the alert.</p>

<p>Daun, ignorant of the St. Petersburg revolution and its
consequences, and seeing the Russian masses drawn up threateningly
opposite his left wing, which he commanded, dared not concentrate
his whole force on Burkersdorf, but from time to time sent bodies
of men to support de Ligne and O'Kelly. As no one could tell what
spot to support, no line of action could be agreed upon. The
commandant of Schweidnitz, General Guasco, with twelve thousand
men, came out of the fortress to attack the Prussian rear, but,
fortunately for Frederick, one of his astute superiors sent him
back.</p>

<p>Meantime, while this uproar and these puzzling operations were
going on, Wied had taken his men out of view of the Austrians by
circuitous paths to the gradual eastern ascent of Ludwigsdorf and
moved up in three detachments. Battery after battery he dislodged,
but when he came in sight of the huge mass of guns and men at the
top, it seemed wild foolishness to try to get there. It could never
have been done by a straight, headlong rush; they crawled along
through thickets and little valleys, creeping spirally higher and
higher, dodging the fire from above, till at last a movement
through a dense wood brought them to the rear and flank of the foe.
Then, with a magnificent charge of bayonets, they sent them flying,
and passed on to the easy rout of the troops on Leuthmannsdorf.</p>

<p>On Burkersdorf Height O'Kelly's men were looking for an attack
on the steepest side, where they were best fortified, but
Mllendorf's troops had gone by a roundabout route to the western
slope, where after some searching they found a sheep-track winding
up the hillside. Following this, they came to a slope so steep that
horses could not draw the guns. And then the men pushed and pulled
them along and up, until the Austrians spied them from above, and
the cannon-balls came crashing down into them. But under this fire
they planted their guns, and did such gallant work with them that
they were soon at the top, dashing down the defences. It was a
tough struggle: the defences were strong&mdash;there were line
after line of them&mdash;and the Austrians had no idea of yielding.
They fought like tigers until the fire from the muskets set the dry
branches of their abatis ablaze, and Mllendorf quickly closed in
around them and forced them to surrender. Frederick's orchestra
still boomed on, and the show of officers on prancing steeds and
parading troops kept reinforcements from coming to assist the men
on Burkersdorf.</p>

<p>It was noon when Mllendorf had achieved his task, and Daun
ordered the army to fall back. But Frederick kept his cannon going
as if with a desperate intention till five, to make matters appear
more dangerous than they really were to Daun. He was successful; at
nightfall Daun led his entire army away, silently and in order, and
he never troubled Frederick again.</p>

<p>He left fourteen guns behind him and over one thousand
prisoners, and quite two thousand deserted to Frederick in the next
few days.</p>

<p>And Czernichef, who had stood by him so nobly? He was full of
warmest admiration for Frederick's curious tactics and their
success, and the king must have been eternally grateful to him. He
marched for home early next morning&mdash;and he was neither
beheaded nor imprisoned by Catherine when he got there: one is very
glad to know that.</p>

<p>Frederick was now enabled to besiege Schweidnitz; its
re-conquest gave him back Silesia and left him to long years of
peace at Sans Souci. It is fair to conclude that these were happy
years, since his happiness lay in incessant work; it needed the
most arduous toil to get his country into shape again, but Prussia
deserved it&mdash;"To have achieved a Frederick the Second for king
over it was Prussia's great merit," says Carlyle.</p>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>A SWEDE'S CAMPAIGN IN GERMANY</h2>

<h3>I. LEIPZIG</h3>

<p>At the opening of the seventeenth century the prospects of
Sweden must have seemed to offer less hope than those of any nation
of Europe.</p>

<p>Only a scanty population clung to the land, whose long winters
paralysed its industrial activities for many months of the year;
and the deadly proximity of the insolent conqueror, Denmark, cut
her off almost entirely from European commerce and made her
complete subjugation seem but a question of time.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Leipzig&mdash;Gustavus Adolphus Giving Thanks
for Victory</b>
</p>

<p>Then it was that the powerful Gustavus Vasa took charge of
Sweden's destinies, delivering the country from Danish tyranny and
establishing his new monarchy with the Lutheran Church for its
foundation.</p>

<p>He was the first of a great race of kings. From the beginning of
his reign, 1527, to the death of Charles XII., 1718, every monarch
displayed some signal ability. But the finest flower of the line,
the most original genius and hero, and one of the world's greatest
conquerors, was Gustavus Adolphus, the "Northern Lion."</p>

<p>He was the grandson of the liberator, Gustavus Vasa, the first
Protestant prince ever crowned, and the son of Charles IX., who
came to the throne in his son's tenth year.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus was born in 1594, his advent bringing great
joy to the Swedes, as it shut out the possible accession of the
Polish house of Vasa, who were Roman Catholics. From early
childhood it was apparent that he had unusual qualities of mind,
great steadfastness, and high ideals of duty, while his perceptions
were swift and wonderfully luminous.</p>

<p>From the first he was inured to hardships&mdash;early rising,
simple fare, indifference to heat and cold; much the same sort of
discipline, I suppose, to which the boys of the house of
Hohenzollern are now habituated. His father felt the necessity of
securing the most distinguished men that were to be found for his
son's education, both from Sweden and foreign lands. Count de la
Gardie had charge of his military education; Helmer von Morner, of
Brandenburg, was his teacher in science and languages, and John
Skythe, a man of great learning, had general charge. So much severe
military drill, combined with constant lessons perseveringly
administered by intellectual martinets, has had the effect of
crushing the spontaneity, the power of taking the initiative, out
of many a callow princeling; but Gustavus was not of any ordinary
princely metal. He took kindly to handling a musket and playing
soldier, while at the same time he displayed a wonderful facility
for learning anything that was presented to him.</p>

<p>Besides his mother tongue, he understood Greek, Latin, German,
Dutch, Italian, Polish, and Russian, using Latin in daily speech
with special fluency. His vigorous memory and brilliantly keen
understanding were at the service of his natural desire to know,
and all combined to make the work of teaching him a delight.</p>

<p>His father was proud of the promise he showed, and from his
tenth year onward allowed him to take part in his councils and
audiences, and sometimes even to give his answers in council.
Records of reports of foreign ambassadors contain many praises of
his intelligence and keen discernment in abstruse questions. When
he visited Heidelberg in 1620 the Duke of Zweibrcken gave an
extremely admiring account of him.</p>

<p>Mathematics came to him easily. His favourite subjects were the
various branches of military science, and fortifications, their
plans and erection, exercised his mind almost unceasingly.
Grotius's treatise on the <i>Right of War and Peace</i> and
Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> were among his favourite readings.</p>

<p>The family of Adolphus owed their position as the reigning power
of the country to their espousal of Protestant principles, and it
was therefore considered essential that the youth should be brought
up to consider himself as the champion and defender of the
Protestant faith.</p>

<p>But it seemed a part of his very being to feel sympathy with
this belief only. He indeed seemed to have been born an ardent
Protestant. The fine austerity of his temperament, the elevation
and purity of his mind, made it impossible for him ever to relax
his views. Protestantism, or Lutheranism, as the latest form of
religion of which he was aware, excited his sincere devotion, which
throughout his career only grew to greater heights of self-effacing
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Gustavus is described as being tall and slim in his early youth,
with a long, thin, pale face, light hair, and pointed beard. But in
after years he grew to great height and bulk, and is said to have
been extremely slow and clumsy in his movements, and so heavy that
no Swedish horse could carry him in armour.</p>

<p>It is a curious physical fact in connection with this
indisputable one that his mind formed its lucid conclusions like
lightning, and that much of his success as a soldier was due to the
marvellous speed of his operations.</p>

<p>His portrait, taken at this later period by Van Dyke, shows the
long face well rounded; the nose is of the prominent Roman type,
while the pointed beard is still worn, also a moustache curved up
at the ends. The eyes are large and beautifully shaped; they were
steel-gray, and capable of fearful flashes of anger when the quick
and often-repented temper of the monarch was aroused; but the brows
are finely arched, and the whole face expresses justice and
benevolence. Sternness is in it, but it is the face pre-eminently
of a good man. One can read in it the courage of high principles
and a great mind; it is absolutely unlike the portraits of the
ferocious and dissolute warriors of the time.</p>

<p>His first campaign was undertaken when he was only in his
seventeenth year. He stormed the city of Christianople, which then
belonged to Denmark, and triumphantly entered the town, but
afterwards, when attacking one of the Danish islands, the young
leader came to grief; his horse broke through the thin ice over a
morass, where he floundered for some time, surrounded by his
enemies. He was finally rescued by young Baner.</p>

<p>In the same year Charles IX. died, and the queen-dowager, the
stepmother of Gustavus, having made a full resignation of her
claims to the regency, which under Swedish law she might have
claimed until Gustavus had reached his twenty-fourth year, he
succeeded to his father's title of "King Elect of the Swedes,
Goths, and Vandals."</p>

<p>For a young man of eighteen it was a formidable undertaking to
ascend the throne of Sweden, and he behaved with modesty and
dignity at a session of the States Assembly convened to discuss the
rights of succession. He spoke of his youth and inexperience, but
added manfully, "Nevertheless, if the States persist in making me
king, I will endeavour to acquit myself with honour and
fidelity."</p>

<p>He was formally proclaimed king on December 31, 1611.</p>

<p>All the force of his character was now called into play. Among
the nobility there was a great deal of jealousy; people of a
certain rank felt that there was no reason why he should occupy the
throne&mdash;each of them had quite as good a claim to it as this
grandson of a former subject.</p>

<p>But here Gustavus's great personal force made itself apparent.
The malcontents found it impossible to treat him otherwise than
with the respect due to a sovereign. He was able to control his
natural impetuosity in all matters of court usage; his nobles were
first made to feel that they were kept at a distance and under the
dominion of a powerful will, and then they seemed glad to serve him
as he wished. His appointments of men to fill public posts, civil
and military, showed remarkable acumen. For his principal
counsellor he chose the famous Oxenstiern, distinguished at
twenty-eight as the coldest, most practical of diplomats, and who
has left a reputation as an unequalled statesman.</p>

<p>Two sets of questions now presented themselves to the king and
the Senate: one related to the development of agriculture and
mining in the country, the other to the critical condition of the
kingdom, between Danes, Polanders, and Muscovites.</p>

<p>The king decided to continue the war with Denmark, but as King
Christian got the better of him, he astutely receded, and signed a
treaty of peace in 1613. He then proceeded against the Czar of
Muscovy, and thereby augmented the Swedish kingdom by several
provinces of importance, one of which included the ground on which
St. Petersburg now stands.</p>

<p>In 1617 peace was concluded with Russia through the mediation of
James I. of England, who was always offering himself as a
peacemaker.</p>

<p>Gustavus now went through the ceremonies of a coronation at
Upsal. It is said that this brief time of festivity was the only
rest he ever enjoyed from the end of his childhood to the abrupt
close of his life. At this time of so-called rest, indeed, he was
concentrating all his mind on international affairs, studying the
laws of commerce, and trying to lift the burden of taxation from
his people as far as was possible.</p>

<p>He looked over his ships, which were in a wretched condition as
a whole, and sent for the best mariners he could obtain from
Holland and the Hanse Towns, with the idea of building up a good
and sufficient navy.</p>

<p>His army also profited by his inventions in arms and artillery;
indeed, he had at all times a watchful eye upon his soldiers,
providing for their comfort and well-being. They had fur-lined
coats for cold weather, and comfortable tents, and they could take
the field in the bitterest winter as well as in summer.</p>

<p>Sweden was continually exporting steel for armour to Spain and
Italy, so it occurred to Gustavus to establish home manufactories
of firearms and swords that should equal those of any other
country. Among his many useful improvements and inventions the
leather cannon was the most curious. These pieces, being very
light, were easily shifted on the battle-field and rapidly hauled
over rugged country. They were made of thick layers of the hardest
leather girt around with iron or brass hoops. After a dozen
discharges they would fall to pieces, but they were made in camp in
quantities, and could be replaced at once. Gustavus attributed many
of his most brilliant victories to them and used them till the day
of his death.</p>

<p>At this time the king and Oxenstiern were staying for a time at
a castle which he had inherited from a cousin, when a fire broke
out in the night and raged up all the staircases. They could only
save themselves by jumping out of the windows and wading up to
their shoulders through a filthy moat, but both escaped with
nothing worse than bruises.</p>

<p>Schiller speaks admiringly of Gustavus for "a glorious triumph
over himself by which he began a reign which was but one continued
series of triumphs, and which was terminated by a victory."</p>

<p>This triumph of duty over inclination was Gustavus's yielding to
the entreaties of his stepmother and other counsellors and giving
up the beautiful Emma, Countess of Brahe. He was deeply in love
with her,&mdash;the chroniclers assure us that his intentions were
honourable,&mdash;and she had promised to be his wife; but it was
represented to him that although the Countess of Brahe had all the
necessary merits and virtues, marriage with a subject would
seriously impair the power of his throne. So, to quote Schiller
again, he "regained an absolute ascendancy over a heart which the
tranquillity of a domestic life was far from being able to
satisfy."</p>

<p>His marriage, however, although it was dictated by
considerations of policy, seems to have been a successful one.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1620 Gustavus made a tour, incognito, of the
principal towns of Germany, with the object of seeing for himself,
in Berlin, the sister of the elector. His suit prospered, and it is
said that in defiance of the elector's wishes the Princess Maria
Eleonora, who was then in her twentieth year, accepted Gustavus and
eloped with him to Sweden. They were married in Stockholm with
great pomp. She was graceful and majestic, and we are assured that
she made Gustavus a worthy and Christian queen.</p>

<p>The relations of Sweden with Poland were perpetually
unsatisfactory. Sigis mund, its Catholic king, disputed the throne
with his cousin Gustavus, and a tedious eight years' war
resulted.</p>

<p>But instead of exhausting Sweden, it had the effect of
developing the consummate military genius of her king; of bringing
his army, by its constant exercise, to an extraordinary degree of
skill, and of making ready for the coming great struggle in Germany
the new principles of military art introduced by Gustavus.</p>

<p>Not only was he a brilliant strategist, but the king looked
after his army with paternal care; it was well fed, well clad, and
promptly and well paid. Every detail was attended to by him.
Religious services were held, morning and evening, by every
regiment. No plunder, cruelty, intemperance, no low and slanderous
talk or immorality, were allowed&mdash;his officers and soldiers
alike were obliged to follow his example.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that this army was led from one
victory to another, or that the fame of its discipline and its
successes should be noised all over Europe. The great Thirty Years'
War, that stupendous struggle of Roman Catholicism to blot out the
work of the Reformation in Germany, was now raging, and in the
various Protestant countries, notably England and Holland, as well
as the anti-Papist states of Germany, people were beginning to look
towards Gustavus as the most likely champion to give them victory.
There were no such generals on the Protestant side in Europe, and
it was known that Gustavus was deeply and sincerely religious,
leading an upright life&mdash;a man of honour, who might be relied
upon to keep his word.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, the Catholic Emperor of Germany, laughed at the idea
of the Swedish champion; the "Snow King," he said (this being one
of the favourite names for Gustavus), would melt if he tried coming
south.</p>

<p>As for Gustavus, he had longed for years to try conclusions with
Tilly and the other Imperial generals, but more particularly since
Ferdinand in 1629 had promulgated the Edict of Restitution, whereby
at one stroke the Archbishoprics of Magdeburg and Bremen, the
Bishoprics of Minden, Verden, Halberstadt, Lubeck, Ratzeburg,
Misnia, Merseburg, Naumburg, Brandenburg, H avelberg, Lebus, and
Cammin, with one hundred and twenty smaller foundations, were taken
away from the Protestant Church and restored to the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>To restore these lands and dignities, which had been from fifty
to eighty years in the possession of the Protestants, was of course
impossible without the use of brute force. By using the armies of
Tilly and Wallenstein to compel it, the Emperor Ferdinand
proclaimed himself the author of a political and religious
revolution, the success of which must depend entirely upon military
despotism, and which was without any moral basis whatever.</p>

<p>There were many different motives prompting Gustavus to enter
the lists against Ferdinand's forces. It was not only that there
was great flattery in the appeal to help the oppressed&mdash;not
only that war was his native element, wherein he felt sure of
success; besides all this, he had bitter grievances to redress. In
1629 Ferdinand sent sixteen thousand Imperialist troops to take
part against him in the war with Poland. To Gustavus's remonstrance
Wallenstein had replied, "The Emperor has too many soldiers; he
must assist his good friends with them." The envoys sent to
represent Gustavus at the Congress of Lubeck were insolently turned
away. Ferdinand also continued to support the claims of the Polish
king, Sigismund, to the Swedish throne, refused the title of king
to Gustavus Adolphus, insulted the Swedish flag, and intercepted
the king's despatches.</p>

<p>However, Gustavus would enter the war only at his own time and
on his own terms. He was far too prudent and wise, far too dutiful,
to impoverish his own country or leave her exposed to the attacks
of enemies. In 1624 England had approached him, wishing to know his
terms for invading Germany, but England would not accede to his
rather high stipulations.</p>

<p>The King of Denmark then underbid Gustavus, made terms with
England, and rushed into the German conflict with great confidence,
but he was ignominiously defeated, while Wallenstein (at that time
Ferdinand's best general) established himself on the Baltic coast.
This was getting dangerously near, as Gustavus felt.</p>

<p>In 1628 Gustavus Adolphus made an alliance with Christian of
Denmark, his old enemy, but as a Protestant and a foe to Catholic
rule in Germany his loyal friend&mdash;for the time. It was agreed
between them that all foreign ships except the ships of the Dutch
should be excluded from the Baltic. In the summer of the same year
he sent two thousand men to defend Stralsund against
Wallenstein.</p>

<p>In 1629, through the secret intervention of Cardinal Richelieu,
a treaty of peace was signed with Poland at Stuhmsdorf. Again, in
1630, Cardinal Richelieu, the wily diplomatist who governed France
for Louis XIII. and had a hand in all the affairs of Europe, sent
Baron de Charnace to Gustavus at Stockholm and made the same
proposals in the name of France that England had made in 1624. But
the flippant manner of de Charnace disgusted the king, and the
terms did not please him: he did not care to assume the rle of a
mercenary general paid by France and bound for a limited number of
years, and so de Charnace returned home without having accomplished
anything.</p>

<p>Richelieu, as the minister of a Catholic king and a prince
himself of the Roman Catholic Church, of course did not dare to
openly ally himself with Gustavus in the latter's character of
defender of the Protestant faith. But in his desire to frustrate
the ambitions of the House of Austria, against which he had schemed
for years, he was quite willing to support any power that would
directly or indirectly advance the supremacy of France.</p>

<p>Gustavus now felt comparatively free to leave Sweden and invade
Germany. By his treaty with Denmark he was free to retreat through
her territory.</p>

<p>After the unsuccessful attempt made by Christian of Denmark to
oppose the emperor by leading the forces of the Protestant Union,
Gustavus remained the only prince in Europe to whom the Germans
felt they could appeal&mdash;the only one strong enough to protect
them, and upright enough to ensure them religious liberty.</p>

<p>Pressing appeals came from all sides now to add to his own
personal motives for embarking in the German war. He raised an army
of forty-three thousand men in Sweden, but set out on his
expedition with only thirteen thousand. On the occasion of taking
his leave, Gustavus appeared before the Estates with his little
daughter of four in his arms. This princess was born so "dark and
ugly," with such a "rough, loud voice," that the attendants had
rushed to Gustavus with the news that a son was born to him. When
this was found to be a mistake they were reluctant to tell him, as
his joy at having an heir to his military greatness was so openly
expressed. But finally his sister, the Princess Catherine, took the
child to him and explained that it was a daughter. If he felt any
disappointment he did not show it; tenderly kissing the child, he
said, "Let us thank God, sister; I hope this girl will be as good
as a boy; I am content, and pray God to preserve the child." Then,
laughing, he added, "She is an arch wench, to put a trick upon us
so soon."</p>

<p>In this manner did the celebrated Christina of Sweden enter the
world. Her father was deeply fond of her, and enjoyed taking her to
his reviews; there she showed great pleasure in hearing the salutes
fired, clapping her little hands, so that the king would order the
firing to be repeated for her, saying, "She is a soldier's
daughter."</p>

<p>There is a famous letter of Gustavus's still preserved in which
he wrote to Oxenstiern: "I exhort and entreat you, for the love of
Christ, that if all does not go on well, you will not lose courage.
I conjure you to remember me and the welfare of my family, and to
act towards me and mine as you would have God act towards you and
yours, and as I will act to you and yours if it please God that I
survive you, and that your family have need of me."</p>

<p>It is said that when Gustavus presented the little girl to the
Estates as his heir, tears came to the eyes of those northern men,
who had the name of being cold and stern, as they repeated their
oath of allegiance to the young princess.</p>

<p>"I know," the king said to them, "the perils, the fatigues, the
difficulties of the undertaking, yet neither the wealth of the
House of Austria dismays me nor her veteran forces. I hold my
retreat secure under the worst alternative. And if it is the will
of the Supreme Being that Gustavus should die in the defence of the
faith, he pays the tribute with thankful acquiescence; for it is a
king's duty and his religion to obey the great Sovereign of Kings
without a murmur. For the prosperity of all my subjects I offer my
warmest prayers to Heaven. I bid you all a sincere&mdash;it may be
an eternal&mdash;farewell."</p>

<p>At this time he could hardly speak for emotion. He clasped his
wife to him and said "God bless you!" and then, rushing forth, he
mounted his horse and galloped down to the ship that was to take
him away from Sweden.</p>

<p>Sweden was anything but rich, yet so inspired had the people
become by the exalted spirit of their monarch, that they were eager
to contribute whatever they could to the campaign.</p>

<p>On June 24, 1630, Gustavus was the first man of his expedition
to land on the Island of Usedom, where he immediately seized a
pickaxe and broke the soil for the first of his entrenchments.
Then, retiring a little way from his officers, he fell upon his
knees and prayed.</p>

<p>Observing a sneering expression upon the faces of some of his
officers at this, he said to them: "A good Christian will never
make a bad soldier. A man that has finished his prayers has at
least completed one half of his daily work."</p>

<p>A painting commemorating this event is said still to be in
existence in a Swedish country-house belonging to the family of de
la Gardie.</p>

<p>Hardly a month after the landing of Gustavus Ferdinand deprived
himself of his most able general; he removed Wallenstein,&mdash;the
Duke of Friedland,&mdash;disbanding a large part of his army, and
putting the rest under the command of Tilly, who now being over
seventy', was slow in getting his army ready for the field.</p>

<p>When Ferdinand heard of the Swedish king's arrival on German
soil, he had said lightly, "I have got another little enemy!" But
by Christmas time Gustavus was established firmly on the banks of
the Rhine, while ambassadors and princes surrounded him.</p>

<p>On reaching Stettin, in Pomerania, the king found his course
opposed by Boguslas, the aged and infirm Duke of Pomerania, who
feared to espouse the cause of the Protestant prince. But Gustavus
insisted upon entering Stettin and seeing the duke. When the latter
came to meet him, borne along the street on a sedan chair, he
responded to Gustavus's hearty greetings by saying lugubriously, "I
must necessarily submit to superior power and the will of
Providence." At which Gustavus said with gracious pleasantry, that
was no doubt trying to the timid old man, "Yonder fair defendants
of your garrison" (the windows were crowded with ladies) "would not
hold out three minutes against one company of Dalicarnian infantry;
you should behave yourself with greater prowess in the married
state" (the duke was over seventy and had no children) "or else
permit me to request you to adopt me for your son and successor."
This was a jest in earnest, for on the death of the duke the Swedes
held possession of Pomerania, which was confirmed to them by
subsequent treaty.</p>

<p>Germany was astounded at the orderly and moral behaviour of the
Swedish soldiers; nothing save "vinegar and salt" were they allowed
to make any demand for outside the camp. In January a notable event
occurred. Richelieu, having in view the effect that so favourable a
diversion would have on the war then going on in Italy between
France and the House of Austria, had at last arranged conditions
that Gustavus could accept.</p>

<p>Richelieu, as Wakeman says, "had long fixed his eyes on Gustavus
as one of the most formidable weapons capable of being used against
the House of Austria, and he desired to put it in the armoury of
France."</p>

<p>In January, 1631, Gustavus signed the treaty of Barwalde, by
which he undertook to maintain an army of thirty-six thousand men,
to respect the Imperial Constitution, observe neutrality towards
Bavaria and the Catholic League as they observed it towards him,
and to leave the Catholic religion untouched in those districts
where it was established. France was to supply the king with two
hundred thousand dollars yearly for six years.</p>

<p>In March a great gathering of Protestants was held in Leipzig;
they agreed to raise troops if they themselves were attacked, but
they were willing to submit to the emperor if he would but repeal
the Edict of Restitution. There seemed to have been some distrust
of Gustavus among them; no doubt they began to fear already that he
would prove too much of a conqueror.</p>

<p>There had been great sympathy in England with Gustavus in his
character as a Protestant champion. Charles I. himself was quite
indifferent, but his subjects, particularly his Scotch subjects,
were anxious to be of service in the campaign.</p>

<p>In July of 1631 the Marquis of Hamilton had landed on the shores
of the Baltic with six thousand troops, generously raised at his
own expense. The marquis was a magnificent fellow, who lived in the
field like a prince, with gorgeous liveries, equipages, and table.
The king received him affectionately, but although he commanded his
own troops he never achieved the rank of general in the Swedish
army.</p>

<p>It is said that the English soldiers were not of great service
in the war, and that they were fearfully affected by the strange
food. The German bread gave them terrible pangs (it must have been
Pumpernickel); they overfed themselves dreadfully with new honey,
and the German beer played havoc with them. In this way the British
contingent was soon reduced to but two regiments, finally to only
one, and the Marquis of Hamilton was content to follow Gustavus as
a simple volunteer.</p>

<p>An expostulating letter from Charles I. to Gustavus in relation
to Hamilton is said to be almost unintelligible except for a
postscript, which reads,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope shortly you will be in a possibility to perform your
promise concerning pictures and statues, therefore now in earnest
do not forget it."</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus sent back to Scotland many well-trained
commanders who had occasion afterwards to use their skill acquired
under him. Some of these had a European reputation: Spence, of
Warminster, created by Gustavus Count Orcholm; Alexander Leslie,
afterwards Earl of Leven; Drummond, Governor of Pomerania; Lindsay,
Earl of Crawford; Ramsay; Hepburn; Munro, and, most devoted and
beloved of all the king's Scottish officers, Sir Patrick
Ruthven.</p>

<p>Various squabbles have been recorded as taking place between the
Scotchmen and the king. One relates to Colonel Seton, who was
mortally offended at receiving a slap in the face from the king. He
demanded instant dismissal from the Swedish service, and it was
given him. He was riding off towards Denmark when the king overtook
him.</p>

<p>"Seton," he said, "I see you are greatly offended with me, and I
am sorry for what I did in haste. I have a high regard for you, and
have followed you expressly to offer you all the satisfaction due
to a brother officer. Here are two swords and two pistols; choose
which weapon you please, and you shall avenge yourself against
me."</p>

<p>This was too great an appeal to Seton's magnanimity; he broke
out with renewed expressions of the utmost devotion to the king and
his cause, and they rode back to camp together.</p>

<p>At one time Hepburn declared with fury to Gustavus that "he
would never more unsheath his sword in the Swedish quarrel," but,
nevertheless, he did do so, and was made Governor of Munich. The
truth was that Gustavus had a domineering spirit and a fiery
temper, but meanness or injustice had no part in him, and his noble
candour won the true and everlasting attachment of those who were
near him.</p>

<p>At one time Douglas, a Scotchman who had enrolled himself in the
Swedish army in 1623, behaved in so unpardonable a fashion in
Munich as to cause his arrest. Sir Henry Vane, the British
ambassador to Sweden, who was greatly disliked there for his
insolence and pig-headedness, approached Gustavus and demanded the
release of Douglas.</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" replied the king, "if you speak another syllable on
the subject of that man, I will order him to be hanged." Presently,
however, he said: "I now release him on <i>your</i> parole, but
will not be affronted a second time. By Heaven! the fellow is a
rascal, and I do not choose to be served by such sort of
animals."</p>

<p>"May it please your majesty, I have always understood that the
subjects of the king my master have rendered you the most excellent
and faithful services."</p>

<p>"Yes, I acknowledge the people of your nation have served me
well, and far better than any others, but this dog concerning whom
we are talking has affronted me, and I am resolved to chastise
him." Within a few moments he had grown calmer, and said: "Sir, I
request you not to take exception at what has dropped from me; it
was the effect of a warm and hasty temper. I am now cool again, and
beseech you to pardon me."</p>

<p>He once spoke of this temper to his generals, saying, "You must
bear with my infirmities, as I have to bear with yours."</p>

<p>That Gustavus had so open a way before him this far in Germany,
that he had been able to walk through Pomerania and Brandenburg
without encountering any opposition that he could not easily
overcome, was owing to Wallenstein's Imperial command having been
taken from him.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest strokes Richelieu had ever made was the
securing the dismissal of Wallenstein from the Imperial army. It
seems a miraculous piece of craft, at the very moment when
Wallenstein's arms had brought glorious victory to the emperor, and
when Gustavus, absolute master of his military operations, was
advancing on German soil, to deprive the Imperial armies of the
only leader whose authority could stand against the great talents
of Gustavus.</p>

<p>To be sure, there was great dissatisfaction with Wallenstein
among the Catholic League on account of his personal pretensions,
but this of itself would not have brought about his downfall. The
only effectual voice to influence Ferdinand was the voice of a
priest. His own confessor wrote of Ferdinand:</p>

<p>"Nothing upon earth was more sacred to him than a sacerdotal
head. If it should happen, he often said, that he were to meet, at
the same time and place, an angel and a priest, the priest would
obtain the first and the angel the second act of obeisance."</p>

<p>So Richelieu introduced in his court a gentle Capuchin monk,
Father Joseph, who lived but to scheme for his master the cardinal.
He told the emperor, among other arguments, that "It would be
prudent at this time to yield to the desire of the princes the more
easily to gain their suffrages for his son in the election of the
King of the Romans. The storm once passed by, Wallenstein might
quickly enough resume his former station."</p>

<p>Ferdinand piously gave in to the gentle monk, although he
afterwards discovered the trickery; Wallenstein was removed and
Tilly was made commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Johann Tzerklas, Count von Tilly, was born in South Brabant in
1559, of an ancient and illustrious Belgian family. It is thought
that he was educated for the Jesuit priesthood, and in this way
became fanatically attached to Rome. At twenty-one he gave up the
priesthood to enter the army of the Duke of Alva. Adopting the
Imperial service, he followed the Duke of Lorraine into Hungary,
where in some campaigns against the Turks he rose rapidly from one
step to another.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this war Maximilian of Bavaria made him
commander-in-chief of his army with an unlimited power. When the
unfortunate Elector Palatine Frederick accepted the crown of
Bohemia and defied the emperor and his Catholic League, Maximilian
took part with the emperor against him, and was rewarded, at the
successful termination of the war, by having the Palatine countries
given to him. The defeat of Frederick's forces in 1620 was no doubt
due to Tilly's generalship. Poor Frederick, who fled from Tilly in
terror and abdicated his electorate when he had two armies ready to
support him, explained his poltroonery by saying philosophically:
"I know now where I am; there are virtues which only misfortune can
teach us; and it is in adversity alone that princes learn to know
themselves."</p>

<p>Tilly, like Wallenstein, paid his troops on "the simple plan,
that they shall get who have the power, and they shall keep who
can."</p>

<p>But Tilly was undoubtedly more disinterested in his character
than Wallenstein, who worked for his own aggrandisement, and only
pretended to be at one time Protestant, at another Catholic.</p>

<p>Tilly was a sincere bigot, of the sort of stuff that the
infamous Duke of Alva, whom he was said to resemble personally, was
made. "A strange and terrific aspect," says Schiller in describing
Tilly, "corresponded with this disposition: of low stature, meagre,
with hollow cheeks, a long nose, a wrinkled forehead, large
whiskers, and a sharp chin. He generally appeared dressed in a
Spanish doublet of light green satin with open sleeves, and a small
but high-crowned hat upon his head, which was ornamented with an
ostrich-feather that reached down to his back."</p>

<p>This horrible fanatic, with his ferocious thirst for the blood
of Protestants, nevertheless appreciated his adversary's powers:
"The King of Sweden," he said in the assembly of the electors at
Ratisbon, "is an enemy as prudent as brave; he is inured to war and
in the prime of life; his measures are excellent, his resources
extensive, and the states of his kingdom have shown him the
greatest devotion. His army, composed of Swedes, Germans,
Livonians, Finlanders, Scotch, and English, seems to be animated by
but one sentiment, that of blind obedience to his commands. He is a
gamester from whom much is won even when nothing is lost."</p>

<p>Tilly had no fondness for parade, and appeared among his troops
mounted on a wretched little palfrey. By a curious contradiction,
this man, who allowed his men to perform unspeakable acts of
cruelty and lust, was himself by nature both temperate and
chaste.</p>

<p>Field Marshal Tilly was now an old man, but he could boast that
he had never lost a battle. Yet he who had vanquished Mansfield,
Christian of Brunswick, the Margrave of Baden, and the King of
Denmark, was now to find the King of Sweden too much for him.</p>

<p>The progress of the "Snow King" in Pomerania and Brandenburg
made the new commander-in-chief put forth all his powers to collect
the military forces scattered through Germany, but it was midwinter
before he appeared with twenty thousand men before
Frankfort-on-the-Oder. Here he had news that Demmin and Colberg had
both surrendered to the King of Sweden, and, giving up his
offensive plan of attack, he retired towards the Elbe River to
besiege Magdeburg.</p>

<p>On his way, however, he turned aside to New Brandenburg, which
Gustavus had garrisoned with two thousand Swedes, Germans, and
British, and, angered by their obstinate resistance, put every man
of them to the sword. When Gustavus heard of this massacre he vowed
that he would make Tilly behave more like a person of humanity than
a savage Croatian.</p>

<p>Breaking up his camp at Schwedt, he marched against
Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which was defended by eight thousand
men&mdash;the same ferocious bands that had been devastating
Pomerania and Brandenburg. The town was taken by storm after a
three days' siege. Gustavus himself, helped by Hepburn and Lumsden,
whom he asked to assist him with their "valiant Scots, and remember
Brandenburg," placed a petard on a gate which sent it flying. The
Swedish troops rushed through, and when the Imperial soldiers asked
to be spared, they cried, "Brandenburg quarter!" and cut them down.
Thousands were killed or drowned in the river. The remainder,
excepting a number of officers who were taken prisoners, fled to
Silesia. All the artillery fell into the hands of the Swedes. For
the first time the king was unable wholly to restrain his
men&mdash;all the stores of ill-gotten Imperialist wealth in
Frankfort were grabbed by his army.</p>

<p>Giving Leslie charge of Frankfort, and having sent one
detachment into Silesia, and another to assist Magdeburg, he
then&mdash;turning aside, incidentally, to carry
Landsberg-on-the-Warth&mdash;proceeded towards Berlin with troops
and artillery, sending couriers in advance to explain his mission,
which was to demand help from his brother-in-law, the elector.</p>

<p>The elector invited the king to dine and sleep at Berlin under
the protection of his own guard, and consented to the temporary
occupation of the fortresses of Spandau and Kustrin by the king's
men, a permission which was withdrawn within a few weeks. When
remonstrated with for these concessions the next day by one of his
advisers, the elector said: "Mais que faire? Ils ont des canons."
It is a remark which seems to explain the lazy, inconsequent
character of the elector, who, however, was always ready to admit
the logic of superior force.</p>

<p>Magdeburg, one of the richest towns of Germany, enjoyed a
republican liberty under its wise magistrates. The rich
archbishopric of which it was the capital had belonged for a long
period to the Protestant princes of the House of Brandenburg, who
had introduced their religion there. The Emperor Ferdinand had
removed the Protestant administration and given the archbishopric
to his own son, Leopold, but, nevertheless, the city of Magdeburg
had found it possible to conclude an alliance with the King of
Sweden, by which he promised to protect with all his powers its
religious and civil liberties, while he obtained permission to
recruit in its territory and was granted free passage through its
gates.</p>

<p>He sent there Dietrich, of Falkenberg, an experienced soldier,
to direct their military operations, and the magistrates made him
governor of the city during the war.</p>

<p>While Gustavus was hindered from coming to its relief, Magdeburg
was invested by the forces of Tilly, with those of Count
Pappenheim, who served under him. Having ordered the Elector of
Saxony to comply with the Edict of Restitution and to order
Magdeburg to surrender, and having received a firm refusal, Tilly
proceeded, March 30, 1631, to conduct the siege personally with
great vigour, and finally, after a long, heroic defence, his men
carried it by storm May 20. Falkenberg was one of the first to
fall. Then began the storied horrors of Magdeburg, the slaughter of
the soldiers, the citizens, the children, the outrages and murder
of the women, many of whom killed themselves to escape the demons
let loose by Tilly.</p>

<p>Many Germans felt pity for the wretched women delivered into
their hands, but the Walloons of Pappenheim's army were monsters of
brutal fury. The scenes of crime in Magdeburg were unsurpassed in
animal insanity by anything that has been recorded. When some
officers of the League, sickened with these sights, appealed to
Tilly to stop them, he said, "The soldier must have some reward for
his danger and his labours."</p>

<p>The inhabitants themselves, it is said, set fire to the city in
twelve different places, preferring to be buried under the walls to
yielding; but some authorities say it was fired by Pappenheim. Only
the Cathedral and fifty houses were left from the conflagration;
the rest had gone to ruin, soot, and ashes.</p>

<p>At last, on May 23, Tilly walked through the ruined streets of
the city. More than six thousand bodies had been thrown into the
Elbe; a much greater number of living and dead had been consumed in
the flames&mdash;altogether thirty thousand were killed.</p>

<p>On the 24th a Te Deum was chanted in the Cathedral by Tilly's
orders, and he wrote to his emperor that since the taking of Troy
and the destruction of Jerusalem no such victory had been seen. He
then marched his men away through the Hartz Mountains, avoiding a
meeting with Gustavus.</p>

<p>Great and bitter complaints arose in all quarters now against
Gustavus for not succouring the city that depended upon him, and he
was obliged to publish a justification of himself. The facts had
been that the two Protestant Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg
insisted, in the most cowardly spirit, upon preserving their
neutrality, and would not allow the king's army to cross their
territory. Had he done so in despite of them, his retreat might
have been cut off. While the siege was in progress, however,
Gustavus finally came to Berlin, and said to the pusillanimous
elector:</p>

<p>"I march towards Magdeburg not for my own advantage, but for
that of the Protestants. If no person will assist me I will
immediately retreat, offer an accommodation to the emperor, and
return to Stockholm. I am certain that Ferdinand will grant me
whatever peace I desire; but let Magdeburg fall, and the emperor
will have nothing more to fear from me; then behold the fate that
awaits you!" The elector was frightened, but would not yield a free
passage for the Swedes through his dominions, and insisted upon
having Spandau given back to him, and while Gustavus was arguing
the question with him the news came that Magdeburg had fallen.</p>

<p>The horrible fate of the city sent a shudder throughout Germany.
On the strength of it Ferdinand began to make fresh exactions,
clearing out more Protestant bishoprics and demanding more men and
funds from the electors; but all this had the effect of opening the
eyes of the members of the Protestant Union to their own
foolishness in not supporting Gustavus, "and the liberties of
Germany arose out of the ashes of Magdeburg," says Schiller.</p>

<p>It was now realised that within eight months the "Snow King" had
made himself master of four cities, forts, and castles, and had
cleared the whole country behind him to the shores of the
Baltic&mdash;a territory one hundred and forty miles wide. But
while other princes were changing their attitude, the Elector of
Brandenburg remained obstinately, stupidly resolved on his own
idea,&mdash;he must have Spandau back; at last Gustavus ordered his
commander to evacuate the fortress, but he declared that from that
day his brother-in-law should be treated as his enemy. To emphasise
this, he brought his whole army before Berlin, and when the elector
sent ambassadors to his camp he said to them:</p>

<p>"I will not be worse treated than the emperor's generals. Your
master has received them in his states, has furnished them with all
necessaries, surrendered every place which they desired, and,
notwithstanding so much complaisance, he has not been able to
prevail upon them to treat his people with more humanity. All that
I require from him is security, a moderate sum of money, and bread
for my troops; in return for which I promise to protect his states
and to keep the war at a distance from him. I must, however, insist
upon these points, and my brother the elector must quickly decide
whether he will accept me for his friend or his capital
plunderer."</p>

<p>A report of this speech, together with pointing the cannon
against the town, had the effect of clearing away the elector's
doubts and sweetening his fraternal relations with Gustavus. Most
amiably he concluded a treaty, in which he consented to pay thirty
thousand dollars monthly to the king, to allow the fortress of
Spandau to remain in his hands, and engaged to open Kustrin at all
times to his troops.</p>

<p>This decisive union of the Elector of Brandenburg with the
Swedes was soon followed by others. The Elector of Saxony, who had
had two hundred of his villages burned by Tilly, now joined
Gustavus eagerly. When Gustavus, in order to test the Saxon ruler,
who had heretofore been so shifty, sent word that he would make no
alliance with him unless he would deliver up the fortress of
Wittenberg, surrender as a hostage his eldest son, give the Swedish
troops three months' pay, and surrender up all traitors in his
ministry, the elector replied:</p>

<p>"Not only Wittenberg, but Torgau, all Saxony, shall be open to
him; I will surrender the whole of my family to him as hostages;
and if that be insufficient, I will even yield up myself to him.
Hasten back, and tell him that I am ready to deliver up all the
traitors he will name, to pay his army the money he desires, and to
venture my life and property for the good cause."</p>

<p>The king, convinced of his sincerity, withdrew his severe
conditions. "The mistrust," said he, "which they showed me when I
wished to go to the aid of Magdeburg awakened mine; the present
confidence of the elector merits an equal return from me. I am
content if he will furnish my army with a month's whole pay, and I
even hope to be able to indemnify him for this advance." The
Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel also joined him. The Dukes of Mecklenburg
and Pomerania were already his firm friends.</p>

<p>Shortly after these events the king summoned his allies to meet
him at Torgau at a council of war, for Tilly had invested Leipzig
with a large army, and was threatening it with the fate of
Magdeburg. The council decided upon pursuing Tilly at once, the
Saxon elector saying this vehemently. Gustavus had had a short
respite from warlike labours; he had visited Pomerania in June,
where great rejoicings had been held on his behalf, and where he
was joined by his queen, Maria Eleonora (just a year after he had
landed), who had come from Sweden with reinforcements of six
thousand Swedes.</p>

<p>But, after all, war was the dominating thought always with
Gustavus; soon he was at headquarters making active preparations
for the next battle. Cust, in his <i>Lives of the Warriors of the
Thirty Years' War,</i> says:</p>

<p class="quote">"The bridge of Wittenberg being in his hands, he
had already issued orders to Horn and Baner to meet him at this
place of rendezvous, about sixteen miles from thence; Colonel Hay
had been directed to occupy Havelberg; while Banditzen was now
directed to remain in charge of the camp at Werben. The king,
however, with the delicacy of a man of honour and station, kept all
his troops on the western bank of the Elbe, that he might leave the
Saxon army encamped on the right bank until he obtained from the
elector his authority in writing to cross the bridge."</p>

<p>The united Saxon and Swedish armies joined their forces on
September 7, 1631, and came within sight of Tilly's forces near
Breitenfeld, a small town four miles from Leipzig. The king's
governor of Leipzig had surrendered to Tilly two days before, but
the "old corporal," as Gustavus called him, had inflicted no
outrages upon the town.</p>

<p>Gustavus pushed his men forward rapidly, leaving tents and
baggage behind him in his camp, thinking his men might well sleep
in the fields at this season of the year. On the evening before the
action Gustavus called his generals to him, explained the plan of
battle to them, and told them that "they were about to fight
tomorrow troops of a different stamp from Polanders or Cossacks, to
whom they had hitherto been opposed.</p>

<p>"Fellow-soldiers," he said, "I will not dissemble the danger of
the crisis. You will have a day's work that will be worthy of you.
It is not my temper to diminish the merit of veteran troops like
the Imperialists, but I know my own officers well, and scorn the
thought of deceiving them. Our numbers are perhaps inferior, but
God is just; and remember Magdeburg."</p>

<p>After riding about through the ranks with the sanguine,
light-hearted manner that always inspired courage in his men, he
retired for a few hours' sleep in his coach. And here, the
chroniclers say, he dreamed that he had a pugilistic encounter with
Tilly and floored him.</p>

<p>Tilly was waiting for them next morning on the slope of a hill,
with large woods behind him, and his artillery on an eminence. His
men wore white ribbons in their hats and helmets, and the allies,
or confederates, as they were called, sprigs of holly or oak. The
Imperial army was stretched in a single line, having neither a
second line nor a reserve.</p>

<p>Gustavus kept his own men well separated from his Saxon troops.
The Saxons were upon and behind a hill with their guns, while his
own men were in separate bodies, each under its own commander, but
capable of being shifted or massed according to the will of
Gustavus in an incredibly short space of time. This manner of
making his battle-field a chess-board, on which only his hand
controlled the moves, was at that time unknown. It has been said by
experts that Gustavus's tactics on the day of Leipzig added more to
the art of war than any that had been invented since the days of
Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>A strong wind raged, blowing thick dust in the faces of the
Swedes, and, as the battle proceeded, the smoke of the powder. As
Gustavus moved his men to the attack in compact columns, in order
to pass the Loderbach, Pappenheim, at the head of two thousand
cuirassiers, plunged at them with violence. The king, clad in gray,
with a green plume in his gray beaver hat, and mounted on his
horse&mdash;of the sort called "flea-bitten,"&mdash;made a dash
forward at the head of his cavalry, anxious to get the wind in his
favour and to get his left flank out of range of a battery.
Pappenheim, whose advance had been made without orders, received a
volley from the musketeers that made him reel, and Baner at the
head of the reserve cavalry, and Gustavus himself with the right
wing, came on him with such impetus as to drive him fairly from the
field.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on Tilly's extreme right Furstenberg threw himself on
the Saxons; they had no such training as the king's old forces, and
flew in a wild rout. The Elector of Saxony, who was in the rear,
joining their flight with his body-guard, never stopped until he
reached Eilenburg, where he consoled himself with deep draughts of
beer, quite content to be out of the fray.</p>

<p>Gustavus witnessed the panic and flight of the
Saxons,&mdash;from whom he had not expected too much,&mdash;and an
officer he had summoned being shot dead in the saddle, the king
took his place and cheered his men forward, crying "Vivat!
vivat!"</p>

<p>The enemy fell back before the vigour of this attack. At the
same time the king discovered from the thick clouds of dust about
him that some large body of troops was near; he was told they were
Swedes, but they were not there in accordance with his plan of
battle, so he galloped up close to them, and coming back quickly
organised his troops to receive an attack. "They are Imperialists,"
he said. "I see the Burgundian cross on their ensigns." It was here
that the two Scottish regiments under Hepburn and Munro first
practised firing by platoons. This was so amazing to the veteran
Cronenberg and his fine Walloon infantry that they retired with all
speed.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the king took charge of his right wing, wheeled
it suddenly to the left, dashed up to the heights where the
Imperial artillery was placed, and capturing it, turned the fire of
their own guns on the enemy. Gustavus now swooped down upon Tilly's
rear.</p>

<p>Caught between this cavalry attack at the rear and Horn's
infantry in front, the Imperialists made a tough struggle. When the
sun went down only six hundred men were left to close around Tilly
and carry him from the field. With that exception the army had been
destroyed. Seven thousand lay dead in the field; five thousand
prisoners remained to take service with the victors, as the custom
was at that time.</p>

<p>The king threw himself on his knees among the dead and wounded
to offer up thanksgivings. He had the alarm-bells set ringing in
all the villages round about to apprise the country of his victory.
He encamped with his army in the deserted camp of the enemy. Almost
all the baggage of the Imperialists fell into the hands of the
conquerors. Hardly a soldier among the killed and wounded had less
than ten ducats in his pocket or concealed within his girdle or
saddle. Now that the battle was over the Elector of Saxony joined
Gustavus in his camp at night. The king, who could be astutely
diplomatic, gave him all the credit for having advised the battle
and kept silent as to the Saxon troops. The elector, transported
with joy at the issue of the day, promised to Gustavus the Roman
crown. Gustavus lost no time in dallying with the Roman crown, but
made new plans for action. He left Leipzig to the elector and set
forward for Merseburg, which, with Halle, at once surrendered.</p>

<p>Here he gave his army a rest of ten days, and many Protestant
princes joined him in council.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>II. LUTZEN</h3>

<p>From the day of Leipzig, Tilly's fortunes left him; his past
victories were forgotten and execrations were heaped upon him.
Though he was wounded, he went to work with all his old energy to
form a new army, but the emperor expressly commanded that he should
never again risk any decisive battle.</p>

<p>The glorious victory at Leipzig is said to have changed not only
the world's opinion of Gustavus, but his own opinion of himself. He
was now more confident; he took a bolder tone with his allies, a
more imperious one with his enemies, and even more decision and
greater speed marked his military movements, though nothing
tyrannical or illiberal was seen in him.</p>

<p>The emperor and the Catholic League were dumfounded at the
annihilation of Tilly. Richelieu was beginning to think his
auxiliary too powerful; Louis XIII. even was heard to mutter, "It
is time to put a limit to the progress of this Goth."</p>

<p>"Alone, without a rival," Schiller says, "he found himself now
in the midst of Germany; nothing could arrest his course. His
adversaries, the princes of the Catholic League, divided among
themselves, led by different and contrary interests, acted without
concert, and consequently without energy. Both statesman and
general were united in the person of Gustavus. He was the only
source from which all authority flowed: he alone was the soul of
his party, the creator and executor of his military plans. Aided by
all these advantages, at the head of such an army, endowed with a
genius to profit by all these resources, conducted besides by
principles of the wisest policy, it is not surprising that Gustavus
Adolphus was irresistible. In not much more time than it would have
taken another to make a tour of pleasure, with the sword in one
hand and pardon in the other he was seen traversing Germany from
one end to the other as a conqueror, lawgiver, and judge. As if he
had been the legitimate sovereign, they brought him from all parts
the keys of the towns and fortresses. No castle resisted him, no
river stopped his victorious progress, and he often triumphed by
the mere dread of his name."</p>

<p>Many of his advisers pressed Gustavus to attack Vienna, but
after careful consideration he thought he would serve his cause
best by marching straight into the heart of Germany on the Main and
the Rhine.</p>

<p>Ten days after Leipzig the king reached Erfurt and ordered Duke
William of Saxe-Weimar to take possession of the city. Proceeding
through the Thuringian Forest, he reached Konigshofen Schweinfurt,
which yielded to him, as did Wurzburg. Marienberg he was obliged to
take by storm; a great store of treasure was here, as well as the
money which the Elector of Bavaria had sent to Tilly for the
purpose of replacing his shattered army.</p>

<p>Great quantities of provisions, corn, and wine fell into Swedish
hands. A coffin filled with ducats was found, and as it was lifted
the bottom gave way, and the soldiers began to help themselves to
the coin in the presence of the king. "Oh, I see how it is," said
he; "it is plain they must have it; let the rogues convert it to
their own uses."</p>

<p>In truth, the character of the Swedish army was no longer beyond
suspicion; the soldiers had become to some extent demoralised with
their conquests; the cruelties and barbarities that they had
suffered had forced upon them terrible reprisals, and the usage of
looting was so universal that they could not be held back from
it.</p>

<p>Tilly had by this time collected a new army out of the
Palatinate and come back to Fulda, and here he tried to get the
consent of Maximilian of Bavaria to engage Gustavus in battle
again, but the duke was fearful of having another army wiped out,
now the only one the Catholic League possessed, and refused
him.</p>

<p>The Swedish king now advanced rapidly towards the Rhine by way
of the Main, reducing Aschaffenburg, Seligenstadt, and the whole
territory on both sides of the river. The Count of Hanau made but
slight resistance when his citadel was captured, and gladly agreed
to pay two thousand five hundred pounds a month for the support of
the army and to recall his retainers from the Imperial service.</p>

<p>Nothing now kept Gustavus from marching on
Frankfort-on-the-Main. The magistrates of the city begged the
ambassador that he sent to entreat him to consider their legitimate
oaths to the emperor, and to leave them neutral, on account of
their annual fairs, which were their chief commercial enterprise.
The king was not moved by these touching business considerations;
he was surprised, he replied, that while the liberties of Germany
were at stake and the Protestant religion in jeopardy, they should
convey to his ear such an odious sentiment as neutrality, and that
the citizens of Frankfort should talk of annual fairs, as if they
regarded all things merely as tradesmen and merchants, rather than
as men of the world with a Christian conscience. More sternly he
went on to say that he had found the keys to many a town and
fortress from the Isle of Rugen on the Baltic to the banks of the
Main, and knew well where to find a key for Frankfort.</p>

<p>The magistrates were filled with alarm at this, and asked for
time to consult the Elector of Mayence, their ecclesiastic
sovereign, but the king replied that he was master of
Aschaffenburg; he was Elector of Mayence; he would give them
plenary absolution.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants," he said, "might desire to stretch out only
their little finger to him, but he would be content with nothing
but the whole hand, that he might have sufficient to grasp."</p>

<p>He then moved his army on Saxenhausen, a beautiful suburb of the
city, and here the magistrates met him, and after taking the oath
of fidelity opened the gates of the city to him. The king made a
solemn public entrance into the city, leading his troops with
uncovered head, as a mark of respect, and bringing in fifty-six
pieces of artillery. He was welcomed by the magistracy to a great
banquet in the coronation hall of the imperial palace of Braunfels.
Maria Eleonora, his queen, now joined him in Frankfort, and when
she met him was so overcome with joy that, throwing her arms around
him, she cried, "Now is Gustavus the Great become my prisoner!"</p>

<p>The next event of importance in this victorious progress was the
carrying of Mayence, which after a short siege capitulated on
December 13. On the 14th the king celebrated his thirty-seventh
birthday by entering Mayence with great pomp, and took up his
residence in the palace of the elector, ordering a service of
thanksgiving for his success to be held in the Roman Catholic
Cathedral. Provisions, artillery, and money fell into the hands of
the army. The king seized as his personal share the library of the
elector, and gave it to Oxenstiern for one of the Swedish
universities, but, alas! it was lost in the Baltic.</p>

<p>The exhausted Swedish soldiers were now allowed a space of rest
to recuperate their energies. On January 10 the queen arrived in
Mayence and shared with Gustavus for a short time the ceremonial
splendours of a regal court, where five German princes and many
foreign ambassadors had come to confer with the king and transact
important negotiations with him. Among these was the Marquis de
Breze, an ambassador from the French court. By his conversation
Gustavus detected something of the truth, that Richelieu now feared
him and was trying to undermine his power.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he sent word to Louis XIII. that he wished to speak
with him personally. The French ambassador tried to persuade
Gustavus that an interview with Richelieu would do as well, but he
replied haughtily:</p>

<p>"All kings are equal. My predecessors have never given place to
the kings of France. If your master thinks fit to despatch the
cardinal half way, I will send some of my people to treat with him,
but I will admit of no superiority."</p>

<p>When the king and queen left Mayence in mid-February, Gustavus
had had a new citadel built at the confluence of the Rhine and
Main, which was called at first "Gustavusburg," but in after days
lapsed into "Pfaffenraube" (Priest-plunder). A lion of marble on a
high marble pillar is near Mayence, holding a naked sword in his
paw and wearing a helmet on his head, to mark the spot where the
"Lion of the North" crossed the great river of Germany.</p>

<p>During February Kreutznach in the Palatinate, one of the
strongest castles in Germany, and the town of Ulm surrendered to
the king.</p>

<p>Leaving Oxenstiern, his minister and friend, to protect his
conquests on the Rhine and Main, Gustavus began his advance against
the enemy March 4, 1632, with an army&mdash;including his allies'
forces&mdash;of one hundred thousand infantry and forty thousand
cavalry under arms. The Catholic League had been extremely active
during the months since the defeat of Tilly at Breitenfeld and
Leipzig, and had raised even larger forces.</p>

<p>By the capture of Donauwrth it was evident to Tilly that
Gustavus's next move was to be towards Bavaria, for he was now
master of the right bank of the Danube. Accordingly, after
destroying all the bridges in the vicinity, Tilly entrenched
himself in a strong position on the other side of the river Lech.
Numerous garrisons defended the river as far as Augsburg. The
Bavarian elector shut himself up in Tilly's camp, feeling that the
issue of the coming battle must decide everything for him.</p>

<p>The Lech, in the month of March, is swollen to a great torrent
by the melting snows from the Tyrol, and dashes furiously between
high, steep banks. The officers of Gustavus considered it
impossible to effect a crossing and urged him not to try it. But he
exclaimed to Horn&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! Have we crossed the Baltic and so many great rivers of
Germany, and shall we now for this Lech, this rivulet, abandon our
enterprise!"</p>

<p>He had made the discovery that his side of the river was higher
by eleven feet than the opposite bank, which would greatly favour
his cannon. He immediately took advantage of this by having three
batteries erected on the spot where the left bank of the Lech forms
an angle opposite its right. Here seventy-two pieces kept up a
constant cannonade on the enemy.</p>

<p>He had now to invent a bridge that would cross the torrent, and
also think of means to distract the enemy from noticing its
construction. He made a strong set of trestles of various heights
and with unequal feet, so that they would stand upright on the
uneven bed of the river; these were secured in their places by
strong piles driven into the river-bed. Planks were then nailed to
the trestles. While this went on, the cannonade drowned the noise
of the hammers and hatchets; one thousand musketeers lined the
Swedish bank and kept the Imperialist soldiers from coming near
enough to discover the work, while a thick smoke, made by burning
wood and wet straw, hid the workmen for the most part.</p>

<p>Before daybreak the bridge was finished, and an army of
engineers and soldiers selected by the king soon crossed it and
threw up a substantial breastwork.</p>

<p>Tilly saw his foes entrenched on his own side of the river and,
under the tremendous firing of the guns from the higher bank, was
utterly powerless to keep them from coming. For thirty-six hours
the cannonade went on, the king standing most of the time at the
foot of the bridge and sometimes acting as gunner himself to
encourage his men. The Imperialists made a desperate effort to
seize the bridge, but a large number were cut down in the
attempt.</p>

<p>Finally, Tilly, whose courage was heroic throughout the day,
fell with a shattered thigh, and had to be borne away. Maximilian,
the Bavarian duke, now precipitately abandoned his impregnable
position and moved the army quietly away to I ngolstadt.</p>

<p>When Gustavus next day found the camp vacant his astonishment
was great.</p>

<p>"Had I been the sovereign of Bavaria," he cried, "never, though
a cannon-ball had taken away my beard and chin&mdash;never would I
have quitted a post like this and laid my states open to the
enemy."</p>

<p>Bavaria, indeed, lay open to the conqueror; before occupying it,
however, he rescued the Protestant town of Augsburg from the
Bavarian yoke, Augsburg being in his eyes a special object of
veneration on account of the famous "Confession" the place "from
whence the law first proceeded from Sion." Augsburg, indeed, at
first resisted him, but when he saw the dread devastation that his
guns began to make on its beautiful buildings he stopped them and
insisted on an interview with the governor, who, seeing the
hopelessness of resistance, yielded.</p>

<p>Tilly died in Ingolstadt, the Elector of Bavaria sitting by his
bedside. He adjured Maximilian to keep Ingolstadt with all his
powers against Gustavus and to seize Ratisbon at once, begged him
never to break his alliance with the emperor, and besought him to
appoint General Gratz in his place. "He will conduct your troops
with reputation, and, as he knows Wallenstein, will traverse the
designs of that insolent man. Oh," he sighed, "would that I had
expired at Leipzig and not survived my fame!"</p>

<p>So died Tilly&mdash;bigoted, merciless, cruel, but nevertheless
faithful and zealous to his last breath in defence of his religion
and the League.</p>

<p>Ingolstadt was a fortress considered impregnable; it had never
been conquered. Gustavus had determined to take it, and made a
partial investment only, for on one side of it was the whole
Bavarian army under Maximilian.</p>

<p>While riding about the walls one day and going very near to take
observations, on account of his short sight, a twenty-four pounder
killed his horse&mdash;the favourite "flea-bitten"
steed&mdash;under him; he rose tranquilly and, mounting another
horse, continued his reconnoitring. In camp in the evening his
generals in a body protested against his risking so valuable a life
in this way; but he replied that he had a foolish sort of a fancy
which always tempted him to imagine that he could see better for
himself than others could, and that his sense of God's providence
gave him the firm assurance that he had other assistance in store
for so just a cause than the precarious existence of one Gustavus
Adolphus.</p>

<p>Within a few days news came that the Bavarian troops had taken
the Imperial town of Ratisbon, and this caused a change in the
king's plans; he had spent eight days on Ingolstadt, but he now
suddenly abandoned it, because it would have been of no special
advantage to him without Ratisbon in his scheme of cutting off
Maximilian from Bohemia.</p>

<p>Munich was his next objective point, and he now proceeded into
the interior of Bavaria, where Mosburg, Landshut, all the Bishopric
of Freysingen, surrendered to him. But the Bavarians looked upon
Protestants as children of hell. Soldiers who did not believe in
the Pope were to them accursed monsters. When they succeeded in
capturing a Swedish straggler they put him to death with tortures
the most refined and prolonged. When the Swedish army came upon
mutilated bodies of their comrades they took vengeance into their
own hands, but never by consent of Gustavus.</p>

<p>His approach to Munich threw the capital into an agony of
terror. It had no defenders, and they feared that the treatment his
soldiers had met at the hands of the country-people might lead him
to use his power cruelly. Some Germans in his army begged to be
allowed to repeat here the sacking of Magdeburg, but such a low
revenge was impossible to the king. When the magistracy sent to
implore his clemency, he answered that if they submitted readily
and with good grace, care should be taken that no man should suffer
with respect to life, liberty, or religion. Only one act of
questionable taste accompanied his public entry, and that was the
presence of a monkey in the procession&mdash;a monkey with a shaven
crown and in a Capuchin's dress, with a rosary in his paw. One
hopes that the king was not responsible for this.</p>

<p>He found an abandoned palace: the elector's treasures had been
removed. There were left, though, many fine 'canvases by Flemish
and Italian masters. His officers urged the king to plunder or
destroy these, but he said: "Let us not imitate our ancestors, the
Goths and Vandals, who destroyed everything belonging to the fine
arts, which has left our nation a proverb and a byword of contempt
with posterity for acts of this wanton barbarity." He had evidently
forgotten the earnest request of Charles I. for "pictures and
statues."</p>

<p>The construction of the palace&mdash;a magnificent
building&mdash;caused the king to express great admiration: he
asked the steward the name of the architect. "He is no other than
the elector himself" was the reply. "I should like to have this
architect," replied the king, "to send him to Stockholm." "That,"
said the steward, "he will take care to avoid."</p>

<p>The guns in the arsenal had been buried so carefully that they
would not have been discovered if it had not been for a treacherous
insider, who told the secret. "Arise from the dead," cried the
king, "and come to judgment!" and one hundred and forty pieces of
artillery were dug up, a large sum of gold being found in one of
them.</p>

<p>Appointing the Scotchman Hepburn to the post of Governor of
Munich, Gustavus soon started forth with his army.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maximilian, although besought by his Bavarians to come
and deliver them from the Swedes, could not resolve to risk a
battle. The wonderful victories of Gustavus had indeed a paralysing
effect upon the country. As yet no one had been found capable of
resisting him. Richelieu himself was horrorstricken at the power he
had helped to raise. It was expected in France that an invasion of
Swedes would be the natural continuation of the Rhine conquests; it
was said that Gustavus would not rest until he had made
Protestantism compulsory throughout Europe. Nothing less than the
command of the German Empire was supposed to be his ultimate
aim.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that his ambitions steadily enlarged
themselves, but there is nothing to prove that he contemplated
supplanting Ferdinand. His enemies were disheartened. Ferdinand was
now brought to the pass of abjectly begging Wallenstein to resume
his command, and Wallenstein was assuming airs of indifference and
allowing himself to be persuaded only with great pressure.</p>

<p>This extraordinary man was the son of a Moravian baron of the
ancient race of Waldstein. As a youth he was notably proud and
stubborn, ambitious and conceited, often saying, "If I am not a
prince, I may become one." He fell from a very high window whilst
at the University of Goldben and was quite unhurt, which is said to
have been the beginning of his certainty of future greatness. He
was grossly superstitious always and entirely an egotist. At
twenty-three he married a wealthy widow, who in a fit of jealousy
gave him a "love philtre" in his wine, from which he narrowly
escaped death. Dying in 1614, she left him a large property, and
later he married a Countess Isabelle von Haggard, of immense
fortune and of much "beauty, piety, and virtue."</p>

<p>Wallenstein now began to invest his great wealth in the purchase
of confiscated properties, and it was said that through his
knowledge of metallurgy he adulterated the coin which he paid. At
all events, his wealth assumed fabulous dimensions, and through his
wife's relations he mingled with the highest nobles of the empire.
He always spoke with affection of his wife, but did not live with
her nor write to her for years at a time.</p>

<p>In person Wallenstein was very tall and thin, with a yellow
complexion, short red hair, and small, twinkling eyes. His cold,
malignant gaze frightened his great troop of servants, who
nevertheless stayed with him because they were unusually well paid.
His military career had begun in his youth, when he served in
Hungary.</p>

<p>Afterwards he raised a body of horse at his own expense for a
war against the Venetians. On the breaking out of the war in
Bohemia, in 1618, he was offered the post of general to the
Bohemian forces, but adopted the side of the sovereign in whose
family he had been brought up.</p>

<p>After putting down the Bohemian rebellion, in which Tilly had
served Maximilian, the emperor decided that it was necessary for
him to have a powerful army under his own orders. Wallenstein
offered to raise an army, clothe, feed, and arm it at his own
expense, if he should be made a field-general, an offer which the
emperor accepted and which Wallenstein carried out.</p>

<p>His military activities from this time on are historical, as
well as the details of his cold, pompous nature. He lived like a
king, with great state, had no principles whatever about the way he
acquired wealth, and spent it with magnificent lavishness.</p>

<p>At the time Ferdinand deprived him of his command, just as
Gustavus was entering Germany, Wallenstein had become Duke of
Friedland, Sagan, Glogau, and Mecklenburg, and was more insolent
than if he had had royal blood in his veins. He spent an income of
three millions of florins yearly, for his armies had plundered the
land for years with great effect. He was able to control his rage
at his sudden downfall because his Italian astrologer, Seni, who
ruled him completely, assured him that the stars showed that a
brilliant future awaited him, exalted beyond anything he had yet
known. And so he was led on to close his career by plots against
his emperor and to meet death by the hands of assassins.</p>

<p>All of Gustavus's successes were the source of deep satisfaction
to Wallenstein; they brought nearer his inevitable recall.</p>

<p>Now when Tilly was dead, and the emperor was beseeching him
again to take command of the Imperial troops, Wallenstein sent an
envoy to convey the congratulations of the Duke of Friedland to the
King of Sweden, and to invite his majesty to a close alliance with
him. He undertook, in concert with Gustavus, to conquer Bohemia and
Moravia and drive the emperor out of Germany.</p>

<p>Gustavus felt that help would be very welcome, and he seriously
considered the offer; but he could not bring himself to believe in
a success promised by such an unscrupulous adventurer, who so
willingly offered to become a traitor. He courteously refused, and
Wallenstein accepted the emperor's offer of chief command with a
salary amounting to the value of one hundred and eight thousand
pounds per annum. He demanded that he should have uncontrolled
command of the German armies of Austria and Spain, with unlimited
power to reward and punish. Neither the King of Hungary (to whom
the emperor had wished to give the highest command) nor the emperor
himself was ever to appear in his army or exercise the slightest
authority in it. No commission or pension was to be granted without
Wallenstein's approval. An Imperial hereditary estate in Austria
was to be assigned to him. As the reward of success in the field he
should be made lord paramount over the conquered countries, and all
conquests and confiscations should be placed entirely at his
disposal. All means and moneys for carrying on the war must be
solely at his command.</p>

<p>The ambassador to whom he made these terms suggested that the
emperor must have some control over his armies, and that the young
King of Hungary should at least be allowed to study the art of war
with Wallenstein, but the reply was: "Never will I submit to any
colleague in my office; no, not even if it were God Himself with
whom I should have to share my command." In his extremity the
emperor accepted these conditions, April 15, 1632.</p>

<p>Although an avowed Jesuit, Wallenstein had no religious scruples
whatever, and the Catholics feared and hated him as much as the
Protestants. The gorgeous luxury of his surroundings was apparently
only designed to impress the world; he was not a sensualist, but
seems to have been actuated only by an insane love of power.
Soldiers flocked to his standard and worshipped the mighty warrior
who rewarded them with ceaseless plunder, but the princes, nobles,
and peasantry of the countries through which he passed were left
with a blight upon them. He seemed to be unable to see in a country
any reasons for industrial prosperity or for conserving wholesome
conditions of any sort; he was a brave, fearless leader&mdash;after
that, a robber, and nothing else.</p>

<p>He distributed enormous sums among his favourites, and the
amount he spent in corrupting the members of the Imperial Court was
still greater. The height to which he raised the Imperial authority
astonished even the emperor; but his design unquestionably was,
that his sovereign should stand in fear of no one in all Germany
besides himself, the source and engine of his despotic power. He
cared nothing, however, himself, for popularity from his equals,
and less for the detestation of the people or the complaints of the
sovereigns, but was ready to bid a general defiance to all
consequences.</p>

<p>Wallenstein raised his army. From Italy, Scotland, Ireland, as
well as from every part of Germany, men flocked to him in thousands
who cared little for country or religion, but were attracted by the
prospects of plunder and of distinction under the renowned soldier
who had made himself a dictator.</p>

<p>In May, 1632, his organisation was complete. He began by driving
Gustavus's Saxon allies out of Bohemia, while Pappenheim scourged
the Rhine country. Then he directed his forces upon rich Protestant
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>Gustavus, before he could get there, threw himself into
Nuremberg and fortified it, and then, gathering his army together,
prepared to give battle to Wallenstein. But the latter had made up
his mind to starve out Gustavus. With his own light cavalry,
superior in number to that of the Swedes, he could more readily
obtain supplies than they.</p>

<p>Forming a huge camp on an eminence overlooking Nuremberg, he
prepared stolidly to wait until the king should be forced to go. At
the end of June the camp was finished, and Gustavus held out until
September.</p>

<p>His men were starving and dying, discipline had become relaxed,
even his 160 generals becoming cruel and rapacious. On September 3
he had led his men against Wallenstein's entrenchments, but was
forced to retire. A few days later he left Nuremberg, providing it
with a garrison, although he had lost through battle, disease, and
starvation nearly twenty thousand men. Wallenstein's loss in the
same time was thirty-six thousand. No attempt at pursuit was made
by Wallenstein. Turning north into Saxony, he proceeded to choose a
position between the Elbe and the Saale, where he might entrench
himself for the winter and carry on what to him was one of the most
necessary features of a campaign&mdash;the sending of bands of
marauders and requisitioners through the country.</p>

<p>He also had in mind detaching the Saxon elector from his
alliance with Gustavus, this vacillating prince having shown
symptoms of yielding to the great furore caused by Wallenstein's
resumption of power.</p>

<p>Gustavus determined that he should not lose Saxony by want of
decision. Summoning Oxenstiern and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar to his
aid, he forced his army with all speed through Thuringia, and
before Wallenstein could recover from his astonishment he seized
both Erfurt and Naumburg. At Erfurt he said farewell to his queen,
who never saw his face again until he was in his coffin at
Weissenfels.</p>

<p>The weather had become so bitterly cold that Wallenstein had
expected no further advances from Gustavus during the winter. He
was preparing to entrench himself between Merseburg and Torgau. He
had sent Pappenheim again to the Rhineland. Gustavus took advantage
of this division and resolved to fight before Pappenheim could
return to reinforce his adversary. Wallenstein sent messenger after
messenger to bring back Pappenheim, and hastily throwing up
entrenchments, he awaited the onslaught of the Swedish king at the
village of Lutzen, November 6.</p>

<p>On the southern side of the large highway leading from Lutzen to
Leipzig lay the Swedes; to the north, the Imperialists. Two ditches
ran by the sides of this road, and some old willow-trees bordered
it. The deep, rich mould of the soil is heavy for horse and foot.
On Wallenstein's right was a hill where a group of windmills waved
their arms.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 5th the Duke of Friedland had ordered his
men to deepen and widen the ditches, and he planted two large
batteries on the windmill hill. Gustavus had passed the night in
his coach with the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, for he owned neither tent
nor field equipage. He had ordered his army to be ready two hours
before daylight, but there was so solid a fog that the darkness was
intense, and not a step could be taken. Gustavus had his chaplain
perform divine service while waiting. He never forgot, it was said,
either the time to pray or the time to pay&mdash;never leaving his
men's wages in arrears. He would take no breakfast and declined to
put on his steel breastplate, as a wound he had received made it
uncomfortable. He was clad in a new plain cloth doublet and an
elk-skin surtout.</p>

<p>Riding along the ranks, he encouraged each regiment, addressing
Swedes and Germans in their respective tongues, and urging all to
valour and steadfastness. "God with us!" was the rallying-cry of
the Swedes. "Jesu Maria!" was the shout of the Imperialists.</p>

<p>The morning wore on, as the soldiers waited still in
impenetrable darkness. At one time Gustavus threw himself on his
knees and began a hymn, the military band accompanying him. His
terrible weeks at Nuremberg and the hardships of the late toilsome
march had seemed to bring out more strongly than ever the fervent
piety of his nature. When, on his arrival a few days before at
Naumburg, the people had rushed from all the country round to see
him, and had prayed on their knees for the favour of touching the
hem of his garment or his sword in its scabbard, he was touched by
this innocent worship, but he was moved to say to those with him:
"Does it not seem as if this people would deify me? Our affairs go
on well without doubt, but I much fear that Divine vengeance will
punish me for this rash mockery, and soon convince the foolish
multitude of my weak mortality."</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock the fog began to lighten, and the enemies
could see each other, while the Swedes beheld the flames of Lutzen,
set on fire by Wallenstein that he might not be flanked on that
side.</p>

<p>Gustavus now mounted his horse and drew his sword for action,
placing himself at the head of the right wing. Wallenstein opened
the attack with a tremendous fire of musketry and artillery, with
which Gustavus's leather guns found it hard to cope. The ditches of
the road made a formidable obstacle to the Swedish cavalry, being
lined with musketeers. But at length the Swedish musketeers cleared
the others away. The horsemen, however, under the heavy firing, now
seemed to find the ditches impassable; they hesitated before them,
whereupon Gustavus dashed forward to lead them across.</p>

<p>"If," said he sternly, "after having passed so many rivers,
scaled so many walls, and fought so many battles, your old courage
fails you, stand still but for a moment and see your master die in
the manner we all ought to be ready to do."</p>

<p>He leaped the ditch, and they were after him like the wind,
urging him to spare his invaluable life and promising to do
everything. On the other side of the road and ditches he observed
three dark masses of Imperial cuirassiers clad in iron, and turning
to a colonel said:</p>

<p>"Charge me those black fellows, for they are men that will undo
us; as for the Croats, I mind them not."</p>

<p>The royal order was at once executed, but the Croats suddenly
swept down upon the Swedish baggage and actually reached the king's
coach, which, however, they failed to capture.</p>

<p>Both sides fought desperately; it had to be decided whether it
was Gustavus's genius that had won at the battle of the Lech and at
Leipzig, or if Tilly's want of skill had been the only cause. On
this day Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, had to justify the
emperor's confidence and the enormous demands he had made upon
it.</p>

<p>Each soldier of each side seemed to feel that the honour and
success of his chieftain depended solely on his individual
efforts.</p>

<p>The Swedes advanced with such velocity and force that the first,
second, and third Imperial brigades were forced to fly; but
Wallenstein stopped the fugitives. Supported by three ranks of
cavalry, the beaten brigades formed a new front to the Swedes and
struck furiously into their ranks. A murderous series of combats
then began; there was no space for even loading muskets&mdash;they
fought wildly with sword and pike. At last the Swedes, exhausted,
withdrew to the other side of the ditches, abandoning a battery
they had gained.</p>

<p>In the meantime the king, at the head of his right wing, had
attacked the enemy's left. His splendidly powerful cuirassiers of
Finland had easily routed all the Croats and Poles covering this
wing, and their flight spread confusion among the rest of the
cavalry. But he then received the news that his infantry had
retired, and that his left wing, under the heavy fire of the
windmill hill, was about to yield.</p>

<p>Ordering Horn to pursue the wing which he had just defeated, he
turned to fly to the assistance of his own men. His horse carried
him so swiftly that no one kept up with him but the Duke of
Lauenburg.</p>

<p>He galloped straight to the place where his men were being
assailed with the greatest fury, and his near-sightedness led him
too near. An Imperialist corporal noticed that all gave way before
him with great respect, and shouted to a musketeer:</p>

<p>"Fire at him! That must be a man of distinction!" and the king's
left arm was shattered.</p>

<p>He begged Lauenburg to help him to a place of safety, but the
next moment he was shot in the back. Turning to Lauenburg he
said:</p>

<p>"Brother, I have enough; seek only to save your own life."</p>

<p>As he spoke he fell to the ground, where a volley of other shots
pierced him.</p>

<p>A desperate struggle still took place over him. A German page,
refusing to tell the royal rank of his master, was mortally shot.
But Gustavus still had life enough to say:</p>

<p>"I am the King of Sweden, and seal with my blood the Protestant
religion and the liberties of Germany." Then he murmured: "My God!
Alas! my poor queen!"</p>

<p>For a long time the Duke of Lauenburg was accused of
assassinating the king, and there is a great deal to be said in
support of such a charge. Among the Spanish archives were found
papers showing that there was a plot in progress to kill Gustavus.
Still, it is conceivable that his death was caused by the ordinary
chances of war.</p>

<p>It was the king's charger, galloping into the Swedish lines
covered with blood, that brought the news of the king's death. The
Swedish cavalry came with furious speed to the place to rescue the
precious remains of their king. A great conflict raged around his
dead body until it was heaped with the slain. The dreadful news,
spreading through the Swedish army, inflamed their courage to
desperation; neither life nor death mattered to them now; the
Yellow Guard of the king was nearly cut to pieces.</p>

<p>Bernhard, Duke of Weimar, a warrior of great skill and courage,
took command of the army. The Swedish regiments under General Horn
completely defeated the enemy's left wing, took possession of the
windmill hill, and turned Wallenstein's cannon against him. The
Swedish centre advanced and carried the battery again, and while
the enemy's resistance grew more feeble, their powder-waggons blew
up with fearful roars. Their courage seemed to give way, and
victory was assured to the Swedes.</p>

<p>Then Pappenheim arrived at the head of his cuirassiers and
dragoons, and there was a new battle to fight. This unexpected
reinforcement renewed and fired the courage of the Imperialists.
Wallenstein seized the favourable moment to form his lines again.
Again he drove the Swedes back and recaptured his battery. Every
man of the Yellow Regiment, which had most distinguished itself on
the side of the Swedish infantry, lay dead in the order in which he
had fought.</p>

<p>The Blue Regiment also had been blotted out by a terrific charge
of the Austrian horse under Count Piccolomini, who had, during the
charge, seven horses shot under him, and was hit in six places.</p>

<p>While the worst of the conflict was going on, Wallenstein rode
through it with cold intrepidity; men and horses fell thick around
him and his mantle was full of bullet-holes, but he escaped
unhurt.</p>

<p>Pappenheim was wounded in the thigh, and the next moment a
musket-ball tore his chest. He felt that he had got his death-blow,
but was able to speak cheerfully to his men, who carried him away
in his coach to Leipzig. He was replaced by Holk.</p>

<p>Duke Bernhard re-formed his men, and the fight went on with a
stubborn fury that nothing could assuage. Neither side would be
beaten. Again and again the Swedes were forced back; again and
again they rallied and drove back their antagonists.</p>

<p>Ten leaders on each side had fallen. The Imperial side finally
weakened with the loss of its generals. At nightfall the Swedes
formed all their broken regiments into one dense mass, made their
final movement across the ditches, captured the battery, and turned
its guns on the enemy.</p>

<p>Confused as the Imperialists had become, they still fought. The
bloody struggle went on until it was too dark to see anything; both
armies then left the field, each claiming the victory. Pappenheim's
army left their guns, being without a general and having no orders.
It was said that after Pappenheim was borne away Wallenstein betook
himself to a sedan chair and did not again expose himself to the
enemy. He was reproached for this afterwards by his army, who also
said that he retired from the field before it was necessary.
Proceeding to Leipzig, he witnessed the death of Pappenheim.
Piccolomini was the last of his side in the field.</p>

<p>The Duke of Friedland insisted on having the Te Deum sung in
honour of a victory in the churches, but this deceived no one. It
was no victory, but a defeat from which he never recovered. While
at Leipzig he accused his officers of cowardice, and after a
court-martial had several of the bravest of them disgraced or shot.
But neither this nor a few inconsequent successes were sufficient
to restore the prestige that Wallenstein had lost at Lutzen.</p>

<p>Nearly one hundred thousand corpses remained unburied on the
field, and the plain all around was covered with wounded and
dying.</p>

<p>It was not until the next day that the Swedes were able to find
the body of their king; it was almost unrecognisable with blood and
wounds, trampled by horses' hoofs, and naked. A huge stone was
rolled by the soldiers as near as they could to the place where the
royal corpse was found; it still rests where they left it, and is
known as "The Stone of the Swede."</p>

<p>The Imperialists had stripped the body in their eagerness to
preserve relics of the great Gustavus. Piccolomini sent his buff
waistcoat to the emperor. His rings, spurs, and gold chain are
still in possession of various families. A famous turquoise is
supposed to have passed into the hands of a Roman Catholic bishop
who desired a trophy of "Anti-Christ," as Gustavus was called by
the Catholics.</p>

<p>The body was carried from the field in solemn state amid a
procession of the whole army. It was taken to Weissenfels, and from
thence to Sweden. There the whole nation mourned, knowing well that
they should not have another monarch like Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>Nothing has ever transpired to change the world's opinion of him
as one of the world's greatest and best. Although the Thirty Years'
War was not concluded for several years after his death, yet he
was, nevertheless, the cause of its cessation. Through his agency
alone the cause of the Protestant belief triumphed, and the effects
of the great upheaval of the Reformation were not allowed to be
obliterated in Germany.</p>

<p>Professor Smyth said of him: "It is fortunate when the high
courage and activity of which the human character is capable are
tempered with a sense of justice, wisdom, and benevolence; when he
who leads thousands to the field has sensibility enough to feel the
responsibility of his awful trust, and wisdom enough to take care
that he directs against its proper objects alone the afflicting
storm of human devastation. It is not always that the great and
high endowments of courage and sagacity are so united with other
high qualities as to present to the historian at once a Christian,
a soldier, and a statesman. Yet such was Gustavus Adolphus, a hero
deserving of the name, perfectly distinguishable from those who
have assumed the honours that belong to it&mdash;the mere military
executioners with whom every age has been infested."</p>

<p>Cust says: "Gustavus Adolphus is thought to have been the first
sovereign who set the example of a standing army. The feudal
association of barons with their retainers had given way in the
previous century to a set of military adventurers, who made war a
profession to gratify their license and their acquisitiveness, and
who were commissioned by kings and leaders to collect together the
assassins of Europe.</p>

<p>"These constituted at the very time of the Thirty Years' War the
unprincipled and insatiate legions who harried Germany, who,
without much discipline, were continually dissipated by the first
disaster and collected together again, as it were from the four
winds of heaven, to cover the face of the land again and again with
terror, devastation, and confusion.</p>

<p>"Gustavus, who had witnessed this from afar, or experienced it
in his Polish wars, had in him that spirit of organisation and
order which signally distinguished him above every great leader who
preceded him. He saw that a well-disciplined force of men to be
commanded by a superior class of officers of high honour and
intelligence, and who should constitute an armed body that might
obtain the dignity of a profession of arms, would be more efficient
and a cheaper defence of nations than the haphazard assembling of
mere bloodhounds, and he first executed the project of having a
force of eighty thousand men, part in activity and part in reserve,
who should be constantly maintained well-armed, well-clothed,
well-fed, and well-disciplined."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>THE STORMING OF BADAJOZ</h2>

<p>In studying the campaign in the Peninsula, one must remember
first of all that the man who was made Earl of Wellington for the
victory at Ciudad Rodrigo was not the great potentiality who, as
the Duke of Wellington, influenced England after Waterloo. During
the Peninsula campaign Wellington was afflicted at all times by a
bitter and suspicious Parliament at home. They had no faith in him,
and they strenuously objected to furnishing him with money and
supplies. Wellington worked with his hands tied behind him against
the eager and confident armies of France. We ourselves can read in
our more frank annals how a disgruntled part of Congress was for
ever wishing to turn Washington out of his position as head of the
colonial forces.</p>

<p>Parliament doled supplies to Wellington with so niggardly a hand
that again and again he was forced to stop operations for the want
of provisions and arms. At one time he actually had been told to
send home the transports in order to save the expense of keeping
them at Lisbon. The warfare in Parliament was not deadly, but it
was more acrimonious than the warfare in the Peninsula. Moreover,
the assistance to his arms from Portugal was so wavering,
uncertain, and dubious that he could place no faith in it. The
French marshals, Soult and Marmont, had a force of nearly one
hundred thousand men.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic5" id="pic5"></a><img alt="" src=

</p>

<p class="caption"><b>In the Breach at Badajoz</b>
</p>

<p>Wellington held Lisbon, but if he wished to move in Portugal
there always frowned upon him the fortified city of Badajoz. But
finally there came his chance to take it, if it could be taken in a
rush, while Soult and Marmont were widely separated and Badajoz was
left in a very confident isolation.</p>

<p>Badajoz lies in Spain, five miles from the Portuguese frontier.
It was the key of a situation. Wellington's chance was to strike at
Badajoz before the two French marshals could combine and crush him.
His task was both in front of him and behind him. He lacked
transport; he lacked food for the men; the soldiers were eating
cassava root instead of bread; the bullocks were weak and
emaciated. All this was the doings of the Parliament at home. But
Wellington knew that the moment to strike had come, and he seems to
have hesitated very little. Placing no faith in the tongues of the
Portuguese, he made his plans with all possible secrecy. The guns
for the siege were loaded on board the transports at Lisbon and
consigned to a fictitious address. But in the river Sadao they were
placed upon smaller vessels, and finally they were again landed and
drawn by bullocks to Eloas, a post in the possession of the allies.
Having stationed two-thirds of his force under General Graham and
General Hill to prevent a most probable interference by Soult and
Marmont, Wellington advanced, reaching Eloas on the 11th of March
1812. He had made the most incredible exertions. The stupidity of
the Portuguese had vied with the stupidity of the government at
home. Wellington had been carrying the preparation for the campaign
upon his own shoulders. If he was to win Badajoz, he was to win it
with no help save that from gallant and trustworthy subordinates.
He was ill with it. Even his strangely steel-like nature had bent
beneath the trouble of preparation amid such indifference. But on
March 16 Beresford with three divisions crossed the Guadiana on
pontoons and flying bridges, drove in the enemy's outposts, and
invested Badajoz.</p>

<p>At the time of the investment the garrison was composed of five
thousand French, Hessians, and Spaniards. Spain had always
considered this city a most important barrier against any attack
through Portugal. A Moorish castle stood three hundred feet above
the level of the plain. Bastions and fortresses enwrapped the town.
Even the Cathedral was bombproof. The Guadiana was crossed by a
magnificent bridge, and on the farther shore the head of this
bridge was strongly fortified.</p>

<p>Wellington's troops encamped to the east of the town. It was
finally decided first to attack the bastion of Trinidad. The French
commander had strengthened all his defences, and by damming a
stream had seriously obstructed Wellington's operations. Parts of
his force were confronted by an artificial lake two hundred yards
in width.</p>

<p>The red coats of the English soldiers were now faded to the
yellow brown of fox fur. All the military finery of the beginning
of the century was tarnished and torn. But it was an exceedingly
hard-bitten army, certain of its leaders, despising the enemy, full
of ferocious desire for battle.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bastion of Trinidad was chosen because it was the
nearest to the entrenchments of the allies. In those days the
frontal attack was possible of success. On the night of the 17th of
March the British broke ground within one hundred and sixty yards
of Fort Picerina. The sound of the digging was muffled by the roar
of a great equinoctial storm. The French were only made wise by the
daylight, but in the meantime the allies had completed a trench six
hundred yards long and three feet deep, and with a communication
four thousand feet in length. The French announced their discovery
by a rattle of musketry, but the allies kept on with their digging,
while general officers wrapped in their long cloaks paced to and
fro directing the work.</p>

<p>The situation did not please the French general at all. He knew
that something must be done to counteract the activity of the
besiegers. He was in command of a very spirited garrison. On the
night of the 19th a sortie was made from the Talavera Gate by both
cavalry and infantry. The infantry began to demolish the trench of
the allies. The cavalry divided itself into two parts and went
through a form of sham fight, which in the darkness was deceptive.
When challenged by the pickets, they answered in Portuguese, and
thus succeeded in galloping a long way behind the trenches, where
they cut down a number of men before their identity was discovered
and they were beaten back. General Phillipon, the French commander,
had offered a reward for every captured entrenching tool. Thus the
French infantry of the sortie devoted itself largely to making a
collection of picks and spades. Men must have risked themselves
with great audacity for this reward, since they left three hundred
dead on the field, but succeeded in carrying off a great number of
the entrenching tools.</p>

<p>Great rain-storms now began to complicate the work of the
besiegers. The trenches became mere ditches half full of
discoloured water. This condition was partly improved by throwing
in bags of sand. On the French side a curious device had been
employed as a means of communication between the gate of the
Trinidad bastion and Fort San Roque. The French soldiers had begun
to dig, but had grown tired, so they finished by hanging up a brown
cloth. This to the besiegers' eyes was precisely like the fresh
earth of a parallel, and behind it the French soldiers passed in
safety.</p>

<p>Storm followed storm. The Guadiana, swollen past all tradition
by these furious downpours, swept away the flying bridges, sinking
twelve pontoons. For several days the army of the allies was
entirely without food, but they stuck doggedly to their trenches,
and when communication was at last restored it was never again
broken. The weather cleared, and the army turned grimly with
renewed resolution to the business of taking Badajoz. This was in
the days of the forlorn hope. There was no question of anything but
a desperate and deadly frontal attack. The command of the assault
of Fort Picerina was given to General Kempt. He had five hundred
men, including engineers, sappers, and miners, and fifty men who
carried axes. At nine o'clock they marched. The night was very
dark. The fort remained silent until the assailants were close.
Then a great fire blazed out at them. For a time it was impossible
for the men to make any progress. The palisades seemed
insurmountable, and the determined soldiers of England were falling
on all sides. In the meantime there suddenly sounded the loud, wild
notes of the alarm-bells in the besieged city, and the guns of
Badajoz awakened and gave back thunder for thunder to the batteries
of the allies. The confusion was worse than in the mad nights on
the heath in <i>King Lear,</i> but amid the thundering and the
death, Kempt's fifty men with axes walked deliberately around Fort
Picerina until they found the entrance gate. They beat it down and
rushed in. The infantry with their bayonets followed closely.
Lieutenant Nixon of the Fifty-second Foot (now the Second Battalion
of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry) fell almost on the threshold,
but his men ran on. The interior of the fort became the scene of a
terrible hand-to-hand fight. All of the English did not come in
through the gate. Some of Kempt's men now succeeded in establishing
ladders against the rampart, and swarmed over to the help of their
comrades. The struggle did not cease until more than half of the
little garrison were killed. Then the commandant, Gasper Thiery,
surrendered a little remnant of eighty-six men. Others who had not
been killed by the British had rushed out and been drowned in the
waters of that inundation which had so troubled Wellington and so
pleased the French general. Phillipon had estimated that the
Picerina would endure for five days, but it had been taken in an
hour, albeit one of the bloodiest hours in the annals of a modern
army.</p>

<p>Wellington was greatly pleased. He was now able to advance his
earthworks close to the eastern part of the town, while his
batteries played continually on the front of Fort San Roque and the
two northern bastions, Trinidad and Santa Maria.</p>

<p>But at the last of the month Wellington was confronted by his
chief fear. News came to him that Marshal Soult was advancing
rapidly from Cordova. It was now a simple question of pushing the
siege with every ounce of energy contained in his army. Forty-eight
guns were made to fire incessantly, and although the French reply
was destructive, the English guns were gradually wearing away the
three great defences. By the 2nd of April Trinidad was seriously
damaged, and one flank of Santa Maria was so far gone that
Phillipon set his men at work on an inner defence to cut the
last-named bastion off from the city. On the night of the 2nd an
attack was made on the dam of the inundation. Two British officers
and some sappers succeeded in gagging and binding the sentinel
guarding the dam, and having piled barrels of gunpowder against it,
they lighted a slow-match and made off. But before the spark could
reach the powder the French arrived under the shelter of the comic
brown cloth communication. The explosion did not occur, and the
inundation still remained to hinder Wellington's progress. On the
6th it was thought that three breaches were practicable for
assault, and the resolute English general ordered the attack to be
made at once. To Picton, destined to attach his name to the
imperishable fame of Waterloo, was given an arduous task. He was to
attack on the right and scale the walls of the castle of Badajoz,
which were from eighteen to twenty-four feet high. On the left
General Walker, marching to the south, was to make a false attack
on Port Pardaleras, but a real one on San Vincente, a bastion on
the extreme west of the town. In the centre the Fourth Division and
Wellington's favourite Light Division were to march against the
breaches. The Fourth was to move against Trinidad, and the Light
Division against Santa Maria. The columns were divided into
storming and firing parties. The former were to enter the ditch
while the latter fired over them at the enemy. Just before the
assault was to be sounded a French deserter brought the
intelligence that there was but one communication from the castle
to the town, and Wellington decided to send against it an entire
division. Brigadier-General Power with his semi-useless Portuguese
brigade was directed to attack the head of the bridge and the other
works on the right of the Guadiana.</p>

<p>The army had now waited only for the night. When it had come,
thick mists from the river increased the darkness. At 10 o'clock
Major Wilson, of the Forty-eighth Foot (now the First Battalion of
the Northamptonshire regiment), led a party against Fort San Roque
so suddenly and so tempestuously that the work capitulated almost
immediately. At the castle, General Picton's men had placed their
ladders and swarmed up them in the face of showers of heavy stones,
logs of wood, and crashing bullets, while at the same time they
were under a heavy fire from the left flank. The foremost were
bayoneted when they reached the top, and the besieged Frenchmen
grasped the ladders and tumbled them over with their load of men.
The air was full of wild screams as the English fell towards the
stones below. Presently every ladder was thrown back, and for the
moment the assailants had to run for shelter against a rain of
flying missiles.</p>

<p>In this moment of uncertainty one man, Lieutenant Ridge, rushed
out, rallying his company. Seizing one of the abandoned ladders, he
planted it where the wall was lower. His ladder was followed by
other ladders, and the troops scrambled with revived courage after
this new and intrepid leader. The British gained a strong foothold
on the ramparts of the castle, and every moment added to their
strength as Picton's men came swarming. They drove the French
through the castle and out of the gates. They met a heavy
reinforcement of the French, but after a severe engagement they
were finally and triumphantly in possession of the castle.
Lieutenant Ridge had been killed.</p>

<p>But at about the same time the men of the Fourth Division and of
the Light Division had played a great and tragic part in the
storming of Badajoz. They moved against the great breach in
stealthy silence. All was dark and quiet as they reached the
glacis. They hurled bags full of hay in the ditch, placed their
ladders, and the storming parties of the Light Division, five
hundred men in all, hurried to this desperate attack.</p>

<p>But the French general had perfectly understood that the main
attacks would be made at his three breaches, and he had made the
great breach the most impregnable part of his line. The English
troops, certain that they had surprised the enemy, were suddenly
exposed by dozens of brilliant lights. Above them they could see
the ramparts crowded with the French. These fire-balls made such a
vivid picture that the besieged and besiegers could gaze upon one
another's faces at distances which amounted to nothing. There was a
moment of this brilliance, and then a terrific explosion shattered
the air. Hundreds of shells and powder-barrels went off together,
and the English already in the ditch were literally blown to
pieces. Still their comrades crowded after them with no definite
hesitation. The French commander had taken the precaution to fill
part of the ditch with water from the inundation, and in it one
hundred fusiliers, men of Albuera, were drowned.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division and the Light Division continued the attack
upon the breach. Across the top of it was a row of sword-blades
fitted into ponderous planks, and these planks, chained together,
were let deep into the ground. In front of them the slope was
covered with loose planks studded with sharp iron points. The
English, stepping on them, rolled howling backward, and the French
yelled and fired unceasingly.</p>

<p>It was too late for the English to become aware of the
hopelessness of their undertaking. Column after column hurled
themselves forward. Young Colonel Macleod, of the Forty-third Foot
(now the First Battalion of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry), a mere
delicate boy, gathered his men again and again and led them at the
breach. A falling soldier behind him plunged a bayonet in his back,
but still he kept on till he was shot dead within a yard of the
line of sword-blades.</p>

<p>For two hours the besiegers were tirelessly striving to achieve
the impossible, while the French taunted them from the
ramparts.</p>

<p>"Why do you not come into Badajoz?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Nicholas of the Engineers, with Lieutenant
Shaw and about one hundred men of the Forty-third Foot, actually
had passed through the breach of the Santa Maria bastion, but once
inside they were met with such a fire that nearly every man dropped
dead. Shaw returned almost alone.</p>

<p>Wellington, who had listened to these desperate assaults and
watched them as well as he was able from a position on a small
knoll, gave orders at midnight for the troops to retire and
re-form. Two thousand men had been slain. Dead and mangled bodies
were piled in heaps at the entrance to the great breach, and the
stench of burning flesh and hair was said to be insupportable.</p>

<p>And still, in the meantime, General Walker's brigade had made a
feint against Pardaleras and passed on to the bastion of San
Vincente. Here for a time everything went wrong. The fire of the
French was frightfully accurate and concentrated. General Walker
himself simply dripped blood; he was a mass of wounds. His ladders
were all found to be too short. The walls of the fortress were
thirty feet in height. However, through some lack of staying power
in the French, success at last crowned the attack. One man
clambered somehow to the top of a wall and pulled up others, until
about half of the Fourth Foot (now the King's Own Royal Lancaster
Regiment) were fairly into the town. Walker's men took three
bastions. General Picton, severely wounded, had not dared to risk
losing the Castle, but now, hearing the tumult of Walker's success,
he sent his men forth and thousands went swarming through the town.
Phillipon saw that all was lost, and retreated with a few hundred
men to San Christoval. He surrendered next morning to Lord Fitzroy
Somerset.</p>

<p>The English now occupied the town. With their comrades lying
stark, or perhaps in frightful torment, in the fields beyond the
walls of Badajoz, these soldiers, who had so heroically won this
immortal victory, became the most abandoned drunken wretches and
maniacs. Crazed privates stood at the corners of streets and shot
every one in sight. Everywhere were soldiers dressed in the garb of
monks, of gentlemen at court, or mayhap wound about with gorgeous
ribbons and laces. Jewels and plate, silks and satins, all suffered
a wanton destruction. Napier writes of "shameless rapacity, brutal
intemperance, savage lust, cruelty and murder, shrieks and piteous
lamentations."</p>

<p>He further says that the horrible tumult was never quelled. It
subsided through the weariness of the soldiers. One wishes to
inquire why the man who was ultimately called the Iron Duke did not
try to stop this shocking business. But one remembers that
Wellington was a wise man, and he did not try to stop this shocking
business because he knew that his soldiers vere out of control, and
that if he tried he would fail.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>THE BRIEF CAMPAIGN AGAINST NEW
ORLEANS</h2>

<p class="cp">(December 14, 1814&mdash;January 8, 1815)</p>

<p>THE Mississippi, broad, rapid, and sinister, ceaselessly
flogging its enwearied banks, was the last great legend of the
dreaming times when the Old World's information of the arisen
continents was roseate but inaccurate. England, at war with the
United States, heard stories of golden sands, bejewelled temples,
fabulous silks, the splendour of a majestic barbarian civilisation;
and even if these tales were fantastic they stood well enough as
symbols of the spinal importance of the grim Father of Waters.</p>

<p>The English put together a great expedition. It was the most
formidable that ever had been directed against the Americans. It
assembled in a Jamaican harbour and at Pensacola, then a Spanish
port and technically neutral. The troops numbered about fourteen
thousand men and included some of the best regiments in the British
army, fresh from service in the Peninsula under Wellington. They
were certainly not men who had formed a habit of being beaten.
Included in the expedition was a full set of civilian officials for
the government of New Orleans after its capture.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic6" id="pic6"></a><img alt="" src=
"1403061h-images/battles-6.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption"><b>The Battle of New Orleans</b>
</p>

<p>A hundred and ten miles from the mouth of the Mississippi, New
Orleans lay trembling. She had no forts or entrenchments; she would
be at the mercy of the powerful British force. The people believed
that the city would be sacked and burned. They were not altogether
a race full of vigour. The peril of the situation bewildered them;
it did not stir them to action.</p>

<p>But the spirit of energy itself arrived in the person of Andrew
Jackson. Since the Creek War, the nation had had much confidence in
Jackson, and New Orleans welcomed him with a great sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>The sallow, gnarled, crusty man came ill to his great work; he
should have been in bed. But the amount of vim he worked into a
rather flabby community in a short time looked like a miracle. The
militia of Louisiana were called out; the free negroes were armed
and drilled; convicts whose terms had nearly expired were enlisted;
and down from Tennessee tramped the type of man that one always
pictures as winning the battle&mdash;the long, lank woodsman, brown
as leather, hard as nails, inseparable from his rifle, in his head
the eye of a hawk.</p>

<p>The Lafitte brothers, famous pirates, whose stronghold was not a
thousand miles from the city, threw in their lot with the
Americans. The British bid for their services, but either the
British committed the indiscretion of not bidding enough or the
buccaneers were men of sentiment. At any rate they accepted the
American pledge of immunity and came with their men to the American
side, where they rendered great service. Afterwards the English,
their offer of treasure repulsed, somewhat severely reproved us for
allowing these men to serve in our ranks.</p>

<p>Martial law was proclaimed, and Jackson kept up an exciting
quarrel with the city authorities at the same time that he was
working his strange army night and day in the trenches. Captain
John Coffee with two thousand men joined from Mobile.</p>

<p>The British warships first attempted to cross the sand-bars at
the mouth of the river and ascend the stream, but the swift
Mississippi came to meet them, and it was as if this monster,
immeasurable in power, knew that he must defend himself. The
well-handled warships could not dodge this simple strength; even
the wind refused its help. The river won the first action.</p>

<p>But if the British could not ascend the stream, they could
destroy the small American gunboats on the lakes below the city,
and this they did on December 14 with a rather painful
thoroughness. The British were then free to land their troops on
the shores of these lakes and attempt to approach the city through
miles of dismal and sweating swamps. The decisive word seems to
have rested with Major-General Keane. Sir George Pakenham, the
commander-in-chief, had not yet arrived. One of Wellington's proud
veterans was not likely to endure any nonsensical delay over such a
business as this campaign against a simple people who had not had
the art of war hammered into their heads by a Napoleon. Moreover,
the army was impatient. Some of the troops had been with Lord Ross
in the taking of Washington, and they predicted something easier
than that very easy campaign. Everybody was completely
cock-sure.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of December 23, Major-General Gabrielle
Viller, one of the gaudy Creole soldiers, came to see Jackson at
headquarters, and announced that about two thousand British had
landed on the Viller plantation, nine miles below the city.
Jackson was still feeble, but this news warmed the old passion in
him. He pounded the table with his fist. "By the Eternal!" he
cried, "they shall not sleep on our soil!" All well-regulated
authorities make Jackson use this phrase&mdash;"By the
Eternal!"&mdash;and any reference to him hardly would be
intelligible unless one quoted the familiar line. I suppose we
should not haggle over the matter; historically one oath is as good
as another.</p>

<p>Marching orders were issued to the troops, and the armed
schooner <i>Carolina</i> was ordered to drop down the river and
open fire upon the British at 7.50 in the evening. In the meantime,
Jackson reviewed his troops as they took the road. He was not a
good-natured man; indeed, he is one of the most irascible figures
in history. But he knew how to speak straight as a stick to the
common Each corps received some special word of advice and
encouragement.</p>

<p>This review was quaint. Some of the Creole officers were very
gorgeous, but perhaps they only served to emphasise the wildly
unmilitary aspect of the procession generally. But the woodsmen
were there with their rifles, and if the British had beaten
Napoleon's marshals, the woodsmen had conquered the forests and the
mountains, and they too did not understand that they could be
whipped.</p>

<p>The first detachment of British troops had come by boat through
Lake Borgne and then made a wretched march through the swamps. Both
officers and men were in sorry plight. They had been exposed for
days to the fury of tropical rains, and for nights to bitter
frosts, without gaining even an opportunity to dry their clothes.
But December 23 was a clear day lit by a mildly warm sun. Arriving
at Viller's plantation on the river bank, the troops built huge
fires and then raided the country as far as they dared, gathering a
great treasure of "fowls and hams and wine." The feast was merry.
The veteran soldier of that day had a grand stomach, and he made a
deep inroad into Louisiana's store of "fowls and hams and
wine."</p>

<p>As they lay comfortably about their fires in the evening some
sharp eye detected by the faint light of the moon a moving shadowy
vessel on the river. She was approaching. An officer mounted the
levee and hailed her. There was no answer. He hailed again. The
silent vessel calmly furled her sails and swung her broadside
parallel. Then a voice shouted, and a whistling shower of
grape-shot tore the air. It was the little <i>Carolina.</i></p>

<p>The British forces flattened themselves in the shelter of the
levee and listened to the grape-shot go ploughing over their heads.
But they had not been long in this awkward position when there was
a yell and a blare of flame in the darkness. Some of Jackson's
troops had come.</p>

<p>Then ensued a strange conflict. The moon, tender lady of the
night, hid while around the dying fires two forces of infuriated
men shot, stabbed, and cut. One remembers grimly Jackson's
sentence&mdash;"They shall not sleep on our soil." No; they were
kept awake this night at least.</p>

<p>There was no concerted action on either side. An officer
gathered a handful of men and by his voice led them through the
darkness at the enemy. If such valour and ferocity had been
introduced into the insipid campaigns of the North, the
introduction would have made overwhelming victory for one people or
the other. Dawn displayed the terrors of the fighting in the night.
In some cases an American and an English soldier lay dead, each
with his bayonet sheathed in the other's body.</p>

<p>Bayonets were rare in the American ranks, but many men carried
long hunting knives.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the two forces had been locked in a blind
and desperate embrace. The British reported a loss of forty-six
killed, one hundred and sixty-seven wounded, and sixty-four
missing. In this engagement the Americans suffered more severely
than in any other action of the short campaign.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 24, Sir George Pakenham arrived with
a strong reinforcement of men and guns. Pakenham was a
brother-in-law of Wellington. He had served in the Peninsula and
was accounted a fine leader. The American schooners <i>Carolina</i>
and <i>Louisiana</i> lay at anchor in the river firing continually
upon the British camp. Pakenham caused a battery to be planted
which quickly made short work of these vessels.</p>

<p>During the days following the two armies met in several
encounters which were fiery but indecisive. One of these meetings
is called the Battle of the Bales and Hogsheads.</p>

<p>Jackson employed cotton-bales in strengthening a position, and
one night the British advanced and built a redoubt chiefly of
hogsheads containing sugar and molasses. The cotton suffered
considerably from the British artillery, often igniting and capable
of being easily rolled out of place, but the sugar and molasses
behaved very badly. The hogsheads were easily penetrated, and they
soon began to distribute sugar and molasses over the luckless
warriors in the redoubt, so that British soldiers died while
mingling their blood with molasses, and with sugar sprinkling down
upon their wounds.</p>

<p>Although neither side had gained a particular advantage, the
British were obliged to retire. They had been the first disciplined
troops to engage molasses, and they were glad to emerge from the
redoubt, this bedraggled, sticky, and astonished body of men.</p>

<p>On the opposite bank of the river a battery to rake the British
encampment had been placed by Commander Patterson. This battery
caused Pakenham much annoyance, and he engaged it severely with his
guns, but at the end of an hour he had to cease firing with a loss
of seventy men and his emplacements almost in ruins. The damage to
the American works was slight, but they had lost thirty-six in
killed and disabled.</p>

<p>Both sides now came to a period of fateful thought. In the
beginning the British had spoken of a feeble people who at first
would offer a resistance of pretence, but soon subside before the
victorious colours of the British regiments. Now they knew that
they were face to face with determined and skilful fighters who
would dauntlessly front any British regiment whose colours had ever
hung in glory in a cathedral of old England. The Americans had
thought to sweep the British into the Gulf of Mexico. But now they
knew that although their foes floundered and
blundered,&mdash;although they displayed that curious stern-lipped
stupidity which is the puzzle of many nations,&mdash;they were
still the veterans of the Peninsula, the stout, undismayed troops
of Wellington.</p>

<p>Jackson moved his line fifty yards back from his cotton-bale
position. Here he built a defensive work on the northern brink of
an old saw-mill race known as the Rodriguez Canal. The line of
defence was a mile in length. It began on the river bank and ended
in a swamp where, during the battle, the Americans stood knee-deep
in mud or on floating planks and logs moored to the trees. The main
defences of the position were built of earth, logs, and fence-rails
in some places twenty feet thick. It barred the way to New
Orleans.</p>

<p>The Americans were prepared for the critical engagement some
days before Pakenham had completed his arrangements. The Americans
spent the interval in making grape-shot out of bar-lead, and in
mending whatever points in their line needed care and work.</p>

<p>Pakenham's final plan was surprisingly simple, and perhaps it
was surprisingly bad. He decided to send a heavy force across the
river to attack Patterson's annoying battery simultaneously with
the deliverance of the main attack against Jackson's position along
the line of the Rodriguez Canal. Why Pakenham decided to make the
two attacks simultaneously is not quite clear at this day.
Patterson's force, divided by the brutally swift river from the
main body of the Americans, might have been considered with much
reason a detached body of troops, and Pakenham might have eaten
them at his leisure while at the same time keeping up a great show
in front of Jackson, so that the latter would consider that
something serious was imminent at the main position.</p>

<p>However, Pakenham elected to make the two attacks at the same
hour, and posterity does not perform a graceful office when it
re-generals the battles of the past.</p>

<p>Boats were brought from the fleet, and with immense labour a
canal was dug from Lake Borgne to the Mississippi. For use in
fording the ditch in front of Jackson, the troops made fascines by
binding together sheaves of sugar-cane, and for the breastwork on
the far side of the ditch they made scaling ladders.</p>

<p>On January 7, 1815, Jackson stood on the top of the tallest
building within his lines and watched the British at work. At the
same time Pakenham was in the top of a pine-tree regarding the
American trenches. For the moment, and indefinitely, it was a
question of eyesight. Jackson studied much of the force that was to
assail him; Pakenham studied the position which he had decided to
attack. Pakenham's eyesight may not have been very good.</p>

<p>Colonel Thornton was in command of the troops which were to
attack Patterson's battery across the river, and a rocket was to be
sent up to tell him when to begin his part of the general
onslaught.</p>

<p>Pakenham advanced serenely against the Rodriguez Canal, the
breastwork, and the American troops. One wishes to use here a
phrase inimical to military phraseology. One wishes to make a
distinction between disinterested troops and troops who are
interested. The Americans were interested troops. They faced the
enemy at the main gate of the United States. Behind them crouched
frightened thousands. In reality they were defending a
continent.</p>

<p>As the British advanced to the attack they made a gallant
martial picture. The motley army of American planters, woodsmen,
free negroes, ex-convicts, and pirates watched them in silence.
Here tossed the bonnets of a fierce battalion of Highlanders; here
marched a bottle-green regiment, the officers wearing furred cloaks
and crimson sashes; here was a steady line of blazing red coats.
Everywhere rode the general officers in their cocked hats, their
short red coats with golden epaulettes and embroideries, their
skin-tight white breeches, their high black boots. The ranks were
kept Iocked in the manner of that day. It was like a grand
review.</p>

<p>But the grandeur was extremely brief. The force was well within
range of the American guns when Pakenham made the terrible
discovery that his orders had been neglected: there was neither
fascine nor ladder on the field. In a storm of rage and grief the
British general turned to the guilty officer and bade him take his
men back and fetch them. When, however, the ladders and fascines
had been brought into the field, a hot infantry engagement had
already begun, and the bearers, becoming wildly rattled, scattered
them on the ground.</p>

<p>It was now that Sir George Pakenham displayed that quality of
his nation which in another place I have called stern-lipped
stupidity. It was an absolute certainty that Jackson's position
could not be carried without the help of fascines and ladders; it
was doubtful if it could be carried in any case.</p>

<p>But Sir George Pakenham ordered a general charge. His troops
responded desperately. They flung themselves forward in the face of
a storm of bullets aimed usually with deadly precision. Back of
their rampart, the Americans, at once furious and cool, shot with
the quickness of aim and yet with the finished accuracy of
life-long hunters. The British army was being mauled and mangled
out of all resemblance to the force that had landed in
December.</p>

<p>Sir George Pakenham, proud, heartbroken, frenzied man, rode full
tilt at the head of rush after rush. And his men followed him to
their death. On the right, a major and a lieutenant succeeded in
crossing the ditch. The two officers mounted the breastwork, but
the major fell immediately. The lieutenant imperiously demanded the
swords of the American officers present. But they said, "Look
behind you." He looked behind him and saw that the men whom he had
supposed were at his back had all vanished as if the earth had
yawned for them.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was taken prisoner and so he does not count, but
the dead body of the major as it fell and rolled within the
American breastwork established the high-water mark of the British
advance upon New Orleans.</p>

<p>Sir George Pakenham seemed to be asking for death, and presently
it came to him. His body was carried from the field. General Gibbs
was mortally wounded. General Keane was seriously wounded. Left
without leaders, the British troops began a retreat. This retreat
was soon a mad runaway, but General Lambert with a strong reserve
stepped between the beaten battalions and their foes. The battle
had lasted twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Jackson's force, armed and unarmed, was four thousand two
hundred and sixty-four. During the whole campaign he lost three
hundred and thirty-three. In the final action he lost four killed,
thirteen wounded. The British force in action was about eight
thousand men. The British lost some nine hundred killed, fourteen
hundred wounded, and five hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>Thornton finally succeeded in reaching and capturing the battery
on the other side of the river, but he was too late. Some of the
British war-ships finally succeeded in crossing the bars, but they
were too late. General Lambert, now in command, decided to
withdraw, and the expedition sailed away.</p>

<p>Peace had been signed at Ghent on December 24, 1814. The real
battle of New Orleans was fought on January 8, 1815.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>THE BATTLE OF SOLFERINO</h2>

<p>"Italy," said Prince Metternich, "is merely a geographical
expression."</p>

<p>The sneer was justified; the storied peninsula was cut up into
little principalities for little princes of the houses of Hapsburg
and Bourbon. The millions who spoke a common tongue and cherished
common traditions of a glorious past were ruled as cynically as if
they were so many cattle. The map of Italy for 1859 is a
crazy-quilt of many patches. How has it come about, then, that the
map of Italy for 1863 is of one uniform colour from the Alps to the
"toe of the boot," including Sardinia and Sicily? We must except
the Papal States, of course, still separate till 1870, and Venetia,
Austrian till 1866, when the "Bride of the Sea" became finally one
with the rest of Italy.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic7" id="pic7"></a><img alt="" src=

</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Carrying the Cemetery Gate at Solferino</b>
</p>

<p>This was the last miracle that Europe had looked for. Unity in
Italy! "Since the fall of the Roman Empire (if ever before it),"
said an Englishman, "there has never been a time when Italy could
be called a nation any more than a stack of timber can be called a
ship." This was true even in the days of the mediaeval magnificence
of the city-states, Venice, Genoa, Milan and Florence, Pisa and
Rome. But in modern times Italy had become only a field for
intriguing dynasties and the wars of jealous nations.</p>

<p>During the latter half of the eighteenth century Italy was
strangely tranquil: Was she content at last with her slavery? Never
that; the people had simply grown apathetic. Their spasmodic
insurrections had always ended in a worse bondage than ever: their
very religion was used to fasten their chains. Perhaps nothing
could have served so well to wake them from this torpor of despair
as the iron tread of the first Napoleon. The "Corsican tyrant"
proved a beneficent counter-irritant&mdash;a wholesome, cleansing
force throughout the land. It was good for Italy to be rid, if only
for a little while, of Hapsburgs and Bourbons; to have the
political divisions of the country reduced to three; to be amazed
at the sight of justice administered fairly and taxation made
equitable. But the most significant effect of the Napoleonic
occupation was this, that the hearts of the Italians were stirred
with a new consciousness: they had been shown the possibility of
becoming a united race&mdash;of owning a nation which should not be
a "mere geographical expression."</p>

<p>And although 1815 brought the bad days of the Restoration, and
the stupid, corrupt, or cruel princes climbed back again on their
little thrones, and the map was made into pretty much the same old
crazy-quilt, still it was not the same old Italy: all the
diplomats&mdash;at Vienna could not make things as they had been
before. The new spirit of freedom came to life in the north, in the
kingdom of Sardinia, that had made itself the most independent
section of the country. In the beginning it was only Savoy, and the
Dukes of Savoy, "owing," as the Prince de Ligne said, "to their
geographical position, which did not permit them to behave like
honest men," had swallowed, first, Piedmont; then, Sardinia; and
then as many of the towns of Lombardy as they could. The
restoration enriched the kingdom by the gift of Genoa, where, in
1806, Joseph Mazzini was born.</p>

<p>Mazzini, Garibaldi, Cavour&mdash;those names will be always
thought of as one with the liberation of Italy.</p>

<p>Though frequently in open antagonism, yet the work of each of
the three was necessary to the cause, and to each it was a holy
cause, for which he was ready to make any sacrifice:</p>

<p class="poem">"Italia! when thy name was but a name,<br>
When to desire thee was a vain desire,<br>
When to achieve thee was impossible,<br>
When to love thee was madness, when to live<br>
For thee was the extravagance of fools,<br>
When to die for thee was to fling away<br>
Life for a shadow&mdash;in those darkest days<br>
Were some who never swerved, who lived, and strove,<br>
And suffered for thee, and attained their end."</p>

<p>Of these devoted ones Mazzini was the prophet; his idealism
undoubtedly made too great demands upon the human beings he worked
for, but let us bear in mind that it needed a conception of
absolute good to rouse the sluggish Italian mind from its
materialism and Machiavellism. Mazzini wore black when a youth as
"mourning for his country," and when his university course was at
an end he took up the profession of political agitator and joined
the Carbonari.</p>

<p>But the greatest service he ever did his cause was the
organisation of a new society&mdash;on a much higher plane than the
Carbonari and its like. The movement was called "Young Italy,"
famous for the spirit it raised from end to end of the peninsula.
Among those attracted by Mazzini's exalted utterance was the young
Garibaldi, who, taking part in Mazzini's rising of 1834, was
condemned to death, and made his escape to South America. In
constant service in the wars between the quarrelsome states he
gained his masterly skill in guerilla warfare, which was afterwards
to play so great a part in the liberation of his country. He did
not return until it seemed as though the hour of Italy's
deliverance was at hand, in 1848, which only proved to be the
"quite undress rehearsal" for the great events of 1859.</p>

<p>Garibaldi has been called "not a soldier but a saint." Most
great heroes, alas! have outlived their heroism, and their
worshippers have outlived their worship; but Garibaldi has never
been anything but the unselfish patriot who wanted everything for
his country but nothing for himself. He has been described, on his
return to Italy from South America, as "beautiful as a statue and
riding like a centaur." "He was quite a show," said the sculptor
Gibson, "every one stopping to look at him." "Probably," said
another Englishman, "a human face so like a lion, and still
retaining the humanity nearest the image of its Maker, was never
seen."</p>

<p>The third of the immortal Italian trio, Count Camillo de Cavour,
was, like Mazzini and Garibaldi, a subject of the Sardinian
kingdom. There was no prouder aristocracy in Europe than that of
Piedmont, but Camillo seems to have drawn his social theories from
the all-pervading unrest that the great Revolution and Bonaparte
had left in the air, rather than the assumed sources of heredity.
In his tenth year he entered the military academy at Turin, and at
the same time was appointed page to the Prince of Carignan,
afterwards Charles Albert, father of Victor Emmanuel. This was
esteemed a high honour, but it did not appeal to him in this light.
When asked what was the costume of the pages, he replied, in a tone
of disgust: "Parbleu! how would you have us dressed, except as
lackeys, which we were? It made me blush with shame."</p>

<p>His attitude of contempt for the place occasioned a prompt
dismissal. At the academy he was so successful with mathematics
that he left it at sixteen, having become sub-lieutenant in the
engineers, although twenty years was the earliest age for this
grade. He then joined the garrison at Genoa, but the military
career had no allurements for him. Taking kindly to liberal ideas,
he expressed himself so freely that the authorities transferred him
to the little fortress of Bard, till, in 1831, he resigned his
commission.</p>

<p>Having by nature a "diabolical activity" that demanded the
widest scope for itself, he now took charge of a family estate at
Leri, and went in for scientific farming.</p>

<p>"At the first blush," he wrote, "agriculture has little
attraction. The habitu of the salon feels a certain repugnance for
works which begin by the analysis of dunghills and end in the
middle of cattle-sheds. However, he will soon discover a growing
interest, and that which most repelled him will not be long in
having for him a charm which he never so much as expected."</p>

<p>Although he began by not knowing a turnip from a potato, his
invincible energy soon made him a capital farmer; his experiments
were so daring that "the simple neighbours who came trembling to
ask his advice stood aghast; he, always smiling, gay, affable,
having for each a clear, concise counsel, an encouragement
enveloped in a pleasantry."</p>

<p>Besides agriculture, his interests extended to banks, railway
companies, a manufactory for chemical fertilisers, steam mills for
grinding corn, and a line of packets on the Lago Maggiore. During
this time he visited England, and was to be seen night after night
in the Strangers' Gallery of the House of Commons, making himself
master of the methods of parliamentary tactics, that were to be of
such value to Italy in later years.</p>

<p>In 1847 Cavour started the <i>Risorgimento,</i> a journal whose
programme was simply this: "Independence of Italy, union between
the princes and peoples, progress in the path of reform, and a
league between the Italian states." As for Italian unity, "Let us,"
Cavour would say, "do one thing at a time; let us get rid of the
Austrians, and then&mdash;we shall see." After returning from
England in 1843. he wrote: "You may well talk to me of hell, for
since I left you I live in a kind of intellectual hell, where
intelligence and science are reputed infernal by him who has the
goodness to govern us."</p>

<p>The king, Charles Albert, had called him the most dangerous man
in the kingdom, and he certainly was the most dangerous to the old
systems of religious and political bigotry; but his work was
educational; gradually he was enlightening the minds of the masses,
and preventing a possible reign of terror. In 1848 he wrote: "What
is it which has always wrecked the finest and justest of
revolutions? The mania for revolutionary means; the men who have
attempted to emancipate themselves from ordinary laws.
Revolutionary means, producing the directory, the consulate, and
the empire; Napoleon, bending all to his caprice, imagining that
one can with a like facility conquer at the Bridge of Lodi and wipe
out a law of nature. Wait but a little longer, and you will see the
last consequence of your revolutionary means&mdash;Louis Napoleon
on the throne!"</p>

<p>Charles Albert, the king, who, as Prince Carignan, had been one
of the Carbonari, and secretly hated Austria, has been accused of
treachery and double dealing. (He explained that he was "always
between the dagger of the Carbonari and the chocolate of the
Jesuits.") But the time came when he nobly redeemed his past. In
1845 he assured d'Azeglio that when Sardinia was ready to free
herself from Austria, his life, his sons' lives, his arms, his
treasure, should all be freely spent in the Italian cause.</p>

<p>In February, 1848, he granted his people a constitution; a
parliament was formed, Cavour becoming member for Turin.</p>

<p>In this month the Revolution broke out in Paris and penetrated
to the heart of Vienna. Metternich was forced to fly his country;
the Austrians left Milan; Venice threw off the yoke&mdash;all Italy
revolted. The Pope, it is said, behaved badly, and left Rome free
for Garibaldi to enter, with Mazzini enrolled as a volunteer.</p>

<p>Even the abominable Ferdinand of Sicily and the Grand Duke of
Tuscany had been obliged to grant constitutions; all the northern
states had hastened to unite themselves to Sardinia by universal
plebiscite. At the very beginning Charles Albert fulfilled his
pledge; he placed himself at the head of his army and defied
Austria.</p>

<p>But it was too soon: Austria was too strong. On the 23rd of
March, 1849, Charles Albert was crushingly defeated by Radetsky at
Novara. There, when night fell, he called his generals to him, and
in their presence abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel,
who knelt weeping before him. The pathos of despair was in his
words: "Since I have not succeeded in finding death," he said, "I
must accomplish one last sacrifice for my country."</p>

<p>He left the battle-field and his country without even visiting
his home; six months later he was dead. "The magnanimous king," his
people called him.</p>

<p>The young Victor Emmanuel began his reign in a kingly fashion;
pointing his sword towards the Austrian camp, he exclaimed: "Per
Dio! d'Italia sar." It seemed at the time a mere empty
boast&mdash;his little country was brought so close to the verge of
ruin. The terms of peace imposed an Austrian occupation until the
war indemnity of eighty million francs should be paid. Yet Cavour
was heard to say that all their sacrifices were not too dear a
price for the Italian tricolour in exchange for the flag of Savoy.
It was not until July that Rome fell&mdash;Rome, where Garibaldi
had established a republic and Mazzini was a Triumvir!</p>

<p>At the invitation of the Pope, Louis Napoleon, then president of
the French republic, seeing the opportunity for conciliating the
religious powers, poured his troops into Rome, and Garibaldi fled,
with Anita at his side. The brave wife with her unborn child would
not leave her hero, but death took her from him. In a peasant's
hut, a few days later, she died, his arms around her. As for
Mazzini, the fall of Rome nearly broke his heart. For days he
wandered dazed about the Eternal City, miraculously escaping
capture, till his friends got him away.</p>

<p>It was not until April of 1850 that Pius IX. dared to come back
to Rome, where a body of French troops long remained, to show how
really religious a nation was France. From his accession there had
been a papal party in Italy, who, because of the good manners of
the gentle ecclesiastic, had wrought themselves up to believe that
Italy could be united under <i>him.</i> But as early as 1847
d'Azeglio wrote from Rome: "The magic of Pio Nono will not last; he
is an angel, but he is surrounded by demons."</p>

<p>After the events of the 1848 rising, and his appeal (twenty-five
pontiffs had made the same appeal before him!) to the foreigner
against his own people, the dream of a patriotic pope melted into
thin air.</p>

<p>And so Austria came back into Italy, and seemed again complete
master there. It would be interesting to be able to analyse the
sensibilities of these prince-puppets who were jerked back to their
thrones by their master at Vienna. Plenty of Austrian troops came
to take care of them. As for the bitter reprisals Italians had to
bear, it is almost impossible to read of them. In certain provinces
every one found with a weapon was put to death. A man found with a
rusty nail was promptly shot. At Brescia a little hunchback was
slowly burnt alive. Women, stripped half naked, were flogged in the
market-place, with Austrian officers looking on. It was after his
visit to Naples in the winter of 1850 that Gladstone wrote, "This
is the negation of God erected into a system of government."</p>

<p>But Italy had now a new champion. When Victor Emmanuel signed
his name to the first census in his reign, he jestingly gave his
occupation as "R Galantuomo," and this name stuck to him for ever
after. A brave monarch Victor Emmanuel proved, whose courage and
honesty were tried in many fires.</p>

<p>When arranging negotiations with Radetsky after Novara, he was
given to understand that the conditions of peace would be much more
favourable if he would abandon the constitution granted by Charles
Albert.</p>

<p>"Marshal," he said, "sooner than subscribe to such conditions, I
would lose a hundred crowns. What my father has sworn I will
maintain. If you wish a war to the death, be it so! My house knows
the road of exile, but not of dishonour."</p>

<p>The Princes of Piedmont had been always renowned for physical
courage and dominating minds. Effeminacy and mendacity are not
their foibles. It is hinted by the Countess of Cesaresco, in her
<i>Liberation of Italy,</i> that sainthood was esteemed the
privilege strictly of the women of the family; but then sainthood
is not absolutely necessary to a monarch. The Piedmont line had
always understood the business of kings,&mdash;but none so
thoroughly as Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p>He was unpopular at first; the Mazzinists cried, "Better Italy
enslaved than handed over to the son of the traitor, Carlo
Alberto!" On the wall of his palace at Turin was written: "It is
all up with us; we have a German king and queen"&mdash;alluding to
the Austrian origin of his mother and of his young queen, Marie
Adelaide.</p>

<p>These two&mdash;wife and mother&mdash;were ruled by clerics, and
made his life melancholy when he began a course of ecclesiastical
reform. One person in every two hundred and fourteen in Sardinia
was an ecclesiastic, and the Church had control of all
ecclesiastical jurisdiction and could shelter criminals, among
other mediaeval privileges. To reform these abuses, the king, in
1849, approached the pope with deferential requests, but the pope
absolutely refused to make any changes.</p>

<p>However, the work of reform was firmly pushed on, and a law was
passed by which the priestly privileges were sensibly cut down,
although the king's wife and mother wrung their hands, and the
religious press shrieked denunciation. At this time Santa Rosa, the
Minister of Commerce and Agriculture, died, and the Church refused
him the last sacrament, though he was a blameless and devout member
of the Roman Church. This hateful act of intolerance reacted on the
clergy, as a matter of course, and gave an impetus to church
reform.</p>

<p>When, in 1855, Victor Emmanuel was so unfortunate as to lose his
wife, his mother, and his brother, within a month, and the nation
as a whole mourned with him, his clerical friends embittered his
affliction by insisting with venomous frankness that it was the
judgment of Heaven that he had brought upon himself for his
religious persecutions.</p>

<p>Strength was Victor Emmanuel's genius: he was not intellectual
in any marked degree, but his ministers could work with him and
rely upon him. A union between him and Cavour, the two great men of
the kingdom, was inevitable. Up to this time Cavour had no general
fame except as a journalist, but the king had the insight to
recognise his extraordinary powers, and when Santa Rosa died
(unshriven) Cavour in his place became Minister of Agriculture and
Commerce. "Look out!" said the king to his prime minister,
d'Azeglio, when this had come to pass, "Cavour will soon be taking
all your portfolios. He will never rest till he is prime minister
himself."</p>

<p>Under the rgime of Cavour, railways and telegraph wires lined
the kingdom in all directions; he took off foolish tariffs and
concluded commercial treaties with England, France, Belgium, and
other powers. "Milord Cavour" was a nickname showing the dislike
aroused by his English predilections, but through him Piedmont
repaired the damage of the war of 1848, and grew steadily in
prosperity.</p>

<p>Cavour's brilliant intellectual powers seem to have been so
limitless that it is rather a relief to think of him personally as
only a dumpy little man with an over-big head. Although a born
aristocrat, and living in the manner becoming one, he was capable
of quite demonstrative behaviour. The occasion for this was a
dinner given by d'Azeglio. Cavour, seated at table, joked the
premier about his jealousy of Ratazzi; the premier replied angrily;
whereupon the greatest of diplomats arose, seized his plate,
lifting it as high as he could, and dashed it to the floor, where
it broke into fragments. Then he rushed out of the house,
crying:</p>

<p>"He is a beast! He is a beast!"</p>

<p>This quarrel, which sounds like an act from a nursery drama, led
to a change in the cabinet, with Cavour left out. But a little
later on d'Azeglio resigned, and Cavour was prime minister.</p>

<p>A marvellous stroke of statesmanship on behalf of his country
was Cavour's intervention in the Crimean War in 1855,&mdash;three
years after Louis Napoleon's <i>coup d'tat.</i> It seemed an act
of folly to send fifteen thousand troops from the little Italian
state&mdash;which had no standing among European powers&mdash;to
help England and France. The undertaking seemed to Sardinians an
act of insanity; Cavour's colleagues were violently against him.
But the king stood by him; so the troops were sent and the
ministers resigned.</p>

<p>Never was an action more fully justified. At the close of the
Crimean War Sardinia had two powerful allies&mdash;France and
England; and for the first time she was admitted on terms of
equality among the "Powers." A significant thing had been said,
too, in 1855: "What can I do for Italy?" asked the Emperor Napoleon
of Cavour. Cavour was not slow to tell him what could be done; he
was convinced that he must look for aid to the vanity and ambition
of Napoleon III.</p>

<p>No diplomatic pressure of his, however, availed. During the next
two years the attitude of Austria became constantly more
unendurable, but still Napoleon would make no move.</p>

<p>It proved to be the most unlikely of events that brought about a
consummation of the wishes of Cavour.</p>

<p>On the evening of January 14, 1858, a carriage drove through the
Paris streets on its way to the opera. With the appearance of its
two occupants all the world is familiar; the wonderful Spanish eyes
of the lady, the exquisite lines of her figure&mdash;who has not
seen them pictured? The smallish man with her had been described by
the Crown Prince of Prussia as having "strangely immobile features
and almost extinguished eyes." His huge moustache had exaggeratedly
long waxed ends, and his chin was covered with an "imperial."</p>

<p>The terrible crash of Orsini's bombs, thrown underneath their
carriage, failed to carry out the conspirators' purpose. The
emperor had a slight wound on the nose, and the empress felt a blow
on the eye. That was all, except that her silks and laces were
spattered with blood from the wounded outside the carriage. They
continued their drive and saw the opera to its finish before they
were told of the tragedy that had befallen. Eight people had been
killed and one hundred and fifty-six wounded by the explosion.</p>

<p>The Empress Eugenie, it is said, showed the greatest composure
over the event, but this was not true of her husband. Probably no
man of modern times had had so many attempts made on his life as
Louis Napoleon, and always, before, he made light of them; but this
last one, resulting in such cruel slaughter, completely unnerved
him. He now lived in a tremor, dreading the vengeance of still
others of the revolutionary ex-friends of his youth; but he dared
not relax the despotic grip with which he ruled his land. How could
he placate them? He wore a cuirass under his coat; he had wires
netted over the chimneys of the Tuileries, so that bombs should not
burst on his hearth; a swarm of detectives were around him wherever
he went, and always the question asked itself in his mind: What
should he do to take off the curse of fear from his life?</p>

<p>Cavour, Victor Emmanuel, the whole of Italy, were filled with
rage and disgust at the news of Orsini's attempt. Orsini&mdash;an
Italian! That must be the end of all their hopes of help from
France! But in the summer of 1848 Cavour was summoned to the
emperor at Plombires, and during two days there the agreement was
formulated by which France and Italy united against Austria. This
was Louis Napoleon's solution of his problem&mdash;to help Italy at
least sufficiently to annul the hate of every assassin on the
peninsula. According to the Prince Regent of Prussia, he chose "la
guerre" instead of "le poignard."</p>

<p>No written record was made of the bargain between Napoleon and
Cavour; but we know that it gave Savoy and Nice to France, and made
one innocent royal victim, the young Princess Clotilde, Victor
Emmanuel's daughter, who was there betrothed by proxy to Prince
Jerome Napoleon.</p>

<p>It was at Plombires that Napoleon with some navet said to
Cavour: "Do you know, there are but three <i>men</i> in all Europe:
one is myself, the second is you, and the third is one whose name I
will not mention." Napoleon was not alone in his high estimate of
Cavour. In Turin they said: "We have a ministry, a parliament, a
constitution; all <i>that</i> spells Cavour."</p>

<p>At his reception on New Year's Day, 1859, Napoleon astounded
every one by greeting the Austrian ambassador with these words: "I
regret that our relations with your government are not so good as
they have been hitherto." This ostentatious expression was equal to
publication in a journal. Immediate war was looked for by every
one. Piedmont, France, and Austria openly made bellicose
preparations.</p>

<p>Although on the 18th of January, 1859, a formal treaty was made,
by which France was bound to support Piedmont if attacked by
Austria, Napoleon hesitated and tried to back out of his agreement.
It will never be known by what tortuous system of diplomacy Cavour
compelled Austria herself to declare war, but it was done, April
27.</p>

<p>Cavour's intrigues during these days were dazzlingly
complicated; he had to deal on one hand with his imperial ally, and
on the other with shady revolutionary elements&mdash;and to keep
his right hand in ignorance of what his left hand did. He summoned
Garibaldi to Turin; Garibaldi, in his loose red shirt and sombrero,
with its plume, with his tumultuous hair and beard, struck dismay
to the heart of the servant who opened the door. He refused to
admit him, but finally agreed to consult his master. "Let him come
in," said Cavour. "It is probably some poor devil who has a
petition to make to me." This was the first meeting of the
statesman and the warrior. When told of the French alliance,
Garibaldi exclaimed: "Mind what you are about! Never forget that
the aid of foreign armies must be, in some way or other, dearly
paid for!" But his adherence was whole-heartedly given to Victor
Emmanuel, and at the end of the short campaign Italy rang with his
name.</p>

<p>For months past Austria had been pouring troops into
Italy&mdash;there seemed no limit to them. Garibaldi, by the end of
April, was in command of a band of Cacciatori delli Alpi, a small
force, but made up of the iron men of North Italy, worthy of their
leader.</p>

<p>On May 2 Victor Emmanuel took the command of his army; it
comprised fifty-six thousand infantry in five divisions, one
division of cavalry in sixteen squadrons, with twelve field-guns
and two batteries of horse artillery. On May 12 the French emperor
rode through the streets of Genoa amid loud acclamations; the city
was hung with draperies and garlands in his honour. At Alessandria
he rode under an arch on which was inscribed, "To the descendant of
the Conqueror of Marengo!" In all he had one hundred and
twenty-eight thousand men, including ten thousand cavalry.</p>

<p>It was a short campaign, but the weeks were thick with battles,
and the battlefields with the slain.</p>

<p>The first engagement was at Genestrello, May 20. The Austrians,
driven out, made a stand at Montebello, where, though twenty
thousand strong, they were routed by six thousand Sardinians. The
armies of the emperor and king forced the Austrians to cross the
Po, and there retire behind the Sesia. On the 30th the allies
crossed the Sesia and drove the foe from the fortified positions of
Palestro, Venzaglio, and Casalino.</p>

<p>Next came Magenta&mdash;a splendid triumph for MacMahon; the
Austrian loss was ten thousand men; that of the French between four
thousand and five thousand. Meantime, Garibaldi had led his
Cacciatori to the Lombard shores of Lake Maggiore, had beaten the
Austrians at Varese, entered Como, routed the enemy again at San
Fermo, and was now proceeding to Bergamo and Brescia with the
purpose of cutting off the enemy's retreat through the Alps of the
Trentino.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June Victor Emmanuel and Napoleon III. made their
triumphal entry into Milan, from whence every Austrian had fled.
Every one remembers how MacMahon, now Duke of Magenta, caught up to
his saddle-bow a child who was in danger of being crushed by the
crowd.</p>

<p>The emperor and the king soon moved on from Milan. By the 23rd
their headquarters were fixed at Montechiaro, close to the site of
the coming battle of Solferino.</p>

<p>On the day before the battle the lines of the allies lay near
the Austrian lines, from the shore of the Lake of Garda at San
Martino to Cavriana on the extreme right. On the evening of the
23rd there was issued a general order regulating the movements of
the allied forces: Victor Emmanuel's army was sent to the extreme
left, near Lake Garda; Baraguay d'Hilliers was given the centre in
front of Solferino, which was the Austrian centre; to his right was
MacMahon, next Marshal Niel, and then Canrobert at the extreme
right, while the emperor's guards were ordered here and there in
the changes of the battle.</p>

<p>The enemy, under Field-Marshal Stadion, held the entire line of
battle strongly, with one hundred and forty thousand men.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Solferino has been the scene of many combats; it is a natural
fighting-ground, and the Austrians had barricaded themselves at all
the strong points of vantage.</p>

<p>At five in the morning of the 24th, Louis Napoleon sat in his
shirt-sleeves, after his early coffee, smoking a cigar, when
tidings came to him that the fighting had begun. In a few minutes
he was driving at full speed to Castiglione, and on the way he said
to an aide: "The fate of Italy is perhaps to be decided to-day." It
was he indeed who decided it; whatever else is said of him, it was
he who struck a great blow for Italy at Solferino.</p>

<p>It was the great day of Napoleon III.; he has never been
considered a notable soldier, but throughout this day, in every
command issued, he displayed consummate military ability.</p>

<p>The sun glared in the intense blue above with tropical heat,
when, at Castiglione, Napoleon climbed the steeple of St. Peter's
Church and beheld the expanse of Lake Garda, growing dim towards
the Tyrolean Alps. There was the remnant of an ancient
castle&mdash;a sturdy tower&mdash;guarding the village of
Solferino, called the "Spy of Italy." Already a deadly fire from
its loopholes poured on Baraguay d'Hilliers's men, who faced it
bravely, but were falling in terrible numbers.</p>

<p>He could see the Austrian masses swarming along the heights
uniting Cavriana with Solferino. The Piedmontese cannon booming
from the left told that Victor Emmanuel was fighting hard, but his
forces were hidden by hills. It was at once plain to him, from his
church steeple, that the object of the Austrians was to divert the
attack on Solferino&mdash;the key of their position&mdash;by
outflanking the French right, filling up the gap between the Second
and Fourth Corps, and thus cutting the emperor's army in two.
Coming down from his height, Napoleon at once sent orders to the
cavalry of the Imperial Guard to join MacMahon, to prevent his
forces from being divided. Altogether the emperor's plan seems to
have been clear and definite; his design was to carry Solferino at
any cost, and then, by a flank movement, to beat the enemy out of
his positions at Cavriana. Galloping to the top of Monte Fenil, the
emperor beheld a thick phalanx of bayonets thrust its way suddenly
through the trees of the valley; it was a huge body of Austrians
sent to cut off the line of the French. There was not a minute to
be lost; he sent orders to General Manque, of the Guard, to
advance at once against the Austrian columns. With magnificent
rapidity the order was executed, and the Austrians&mdash;a great
number&mdash;were beaten back far from the line of battle.</p>

<p>The Austrian batteries placed on the Mount of Cypresses and on
the Cemetery Hill of Solferino were keeping up a deadly fire on the
French.</p>

<p>Baraguay d'Hilliers brought Bazaine's brigade into action
against the one, and the First Regiment of zouaves rushed up the
other, only to be hurled back by the enemy as they reached the
steep slope. A horrible confusion followed these two repulses, the
zouaves and General Negrier's division being fatally mixed and
fighting with each other like furies. But General Negrier kept his
head and collected his troops, scattered all over the hillocks and
valleys. Then, with the Sixty-first Regiment of the line and a
battalion of the One Hundredth Regiment, he started resolutely to
mount the Cemetery Hill. It was a deadly march; the enemy; holding
the advantage, disputed every turn and twist of the ascent. Twice
Negrier's troops rushed up along the ridge-like path, but the
circular wall of the cemetery, bored with thousands of holes,
through which rifles sent a scathing hail, was strong as a fortress
to resist them. It was sheer murder to take his men up again;
Negrier abandoned the attack.</p>

<p>The enemy's cannon-balls from the three defended heights fell
thick and fast on Mount Fenil, where Napoleon and his aides
breathlessly watched the progress of the drama.</p>

<p>Many of the Cent-Gardes who formed the imperial escort were shot
down; the emperor was in the midst of death. The Austrians had been
strongly reinforced, and held to the defence of Solferino more
obstinately than ever.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this, the French were gaining ground; the
left flank of the Austrians was at last broken by the artillery of
the French reserve, and the whole army felt a thrill of
encouragement.</p>

<p>A number of French battalions were now massing themselves about
the spur of the Tower Hill of Solferino, but it was impossible to
proceed to the attack while solid Austrian masses stood ready to
pounce upon their flank.</p>

<p>A few fiery charges scattered the enemy in all directions, and a
tempest of shouts rang out when Forey gave the order to storm the
Tower Hill. The drum beat, the trumpets sounded. "Vive l'Empereur!"
echoed from the encircling hills. "Quick" is too slow a word for
French soldiers. The Imperial Guard, chasseurs, and battalions of
the line rushed up with such fierce velocity that it was no time at
all before the heights of Solferino were covered with Napoleon's
men. Nothing could stand against such an electric shock&mdash;the
Tower Hill was carried, and General Leboeuf turned the artillery on
the defeated masses of Austrians choking up the road that led to
Cavriana.</p>

<p>The convent and adjoining church, strongly barricaded, yielded
after repeated attacks, and then Baraguay d'Hilliers and Negrier
made a last attempt on the Cemetery Hill. The narrow path that led
up to it was strewn with bloody corpses, but neither the dead
resting in their graves nor these new dead could be held sacred. A
strong artillery fire on the gate and walls stopped the rifles from
firing through the holes, and in this pause Colonel Laffaile led
the Seventy-eighth Regiment up. They burst in the gate of the
cemetery,&mdash;there were not many there to kill!&mdash;they were
soon on their way towards the village.</p>

<p>Their way lay through a checker-board of tiny farms and fields,
separated by stone walls wreathed with ivy. Little chapels,
dedicated to favourite saints, stood in every enclosure. Houses,
walls, and chapels had all been turned into barricades by the
Austrians. Douay's and Negrier's men had to fight their way to the
village through a rain of bullets from unseen enemies. Now they
took the narrow path winding up by the Tower Hill into the streets
of the village; when nearly at the top the clanking of heavy
artillery-wheels told them that the enemy were retreating and
carrying off the very guns that had played such havoc on their
ranks from the top of Tower Hill. It took but a short time to
capture them, and then they were fairly in the village, chasing the
last straggling Austrians through the streets.</p>

<p>Solferino was in the hands of the French; but the fate of the
battle was not yet decided, for Cavriana was a strong position, and
Stadion and his generals had made a careful study of its
possibilities.</p>

<p>At two o'clock MacMahon's left wing was completely surrounded by
the enemy, but moving forward on the right he boldly turned the
Austrian front, and swept everything before him to the village of
San Cassiano, adjoining Cavriana. The village was attacked on both
sides and carried by Laure's Algerian sharpshooters; but the
Austrians still held Monte Fontana, which unites San Cassiano to
Cavriana, and repulsed Laure's men with deadly skill.</p>

<p>Reinforced, they made a splendid dash and took Monte Fontana,
but the Prince of Hesse brought up reserves and won it back for the
Austrians. Napoleon now ordered Mac Mahon to push forward his whole
corps to support the attack, and as Manque's brigade and
Mellinet's grenadiers had succeeded in routing the enemy from Monte
Sacro, they were ordered to advance on Cavriana.</p>

<p>Leboeuf placed the artillery of the Guard at the opening of the
valley facing Cavriana, and Laure's Algerian sharpshooters after a
prolonged hand-to-hand conflict with the Prince of Hesse's men
carried Cavriana at four o'clock. Two hours later Napoleon was
resting in the Casa Pastore, where the Austrian emperor had slept
the night before. The sultry glare of the day had culminated in a
wild, black storm; the wind was a hurricane, and it was under
torrents of rain that the Austrians made their retreat, while the
thunder drowned the noise of Marshal Niel's cannon driving them
from every stand they made.</p>

<p>Such overwhelming numbers had been brought to bear on the French
that day that their defeat would have been almost certain if it had
not been for Napoleon's generalship and his modern rifled guns.
These were new to the Austrians, who became panic-stricken at their
effect.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese troops, under their "R Galantuomo," fought as
nobly as their brilliant allies that day. The young Emperor Francis
Joseph commanded in person at San Martino, but it was Benedek that
Victor Emmanuel had to reckon with&mdash;the best general of all
the Austrian staff. He beat him out of San Martino, and to the
Italians the combat of June 24 is known as the Battle of San
Martino to this day.</p>

<p>The scorching sun of next morning shone upon twenty-two thousand
ghastly dead. It has been believed that the horrible sights and
scents of this battlefield sickened the emperor and cut short the
campaign; but who can tell? Was it perhaps Eugenie's
influence&mdash;always used in favour of the pope? Or was it that
he realised that the movement could now only end in the complete
liberation of Italy&mdash;a consummation that he regarded with
horror? All that is known is this: three days after the Austrians
had been driven back to their own country, and while all Italy went
mad with joy at the victory, while Mrs. Browning was writing her
"Emperor Evermore"&mdash;a cruel satire on later events&mdash;it
became known that Napoleon had sent a message to the Austrian
kaiser asking him to suspend hostilities.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The two emperors met at Villafranca, a small place near
Solferino. At the close of their interview Francis Joseph looked
humiliated and sombre&mdash;Louis Napoleon was smilingly at ease.
He, the parvenu, had made terms with a legitimate emperor, and was
pleased with himself. He had arranged that Lombardy was to be
united to Piedmont, while Venetia remained Austrian. When Victor
Emmanuel was told of these terms he could only say coldly that he
must ever remain grateful for what Napoleon <i>had</i> done, but he
murmured "Poor Italy!"</p>

<p>And Cavour? Cavour was struck to the heart. Had he arranged such
a finale as <i>this</i> with the upstart emperor&mdash;that he
should leave the game when it suited his pleasure, and make terms
with the Austrian emperor all by himself&mdash;insolently
disregarding Victor Emmanuel? He wept with grief and anger. He left
at once for the camp, and there he told the emperor his opinion of
him in stinging words. He begged his king to repudiate the treaty
and reject Lombardy, but Victor Emmanuel, although as bitterly
disappointed as Cavour, felt that he must be prudent for his
people's sake.</p>

<p>Angered at the' king's refusal, Cavour resigned his office and
retired to his farms at Lri, but after a few months he was back in
his old place in the cabinet. All his hopes and ambitions came
back&mdash;although physically the shock had broken him&mdash;and
he laboured for Italy till his death in June of 1861. The whole
Italian people, from king to peasant, knew that they had lost their
best friend. But Cavour's life-work was nearly finished. Garibaldi
had taken up the work of emancipation where Napoleon had abandoned
it, and before he left him for ever, to Cavour was given the
triumph of hearing his beloved master proclaimed King of Italy.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL</h2>

<p>On the 12th of June, 1775, Captain Harris, afterwards Lord
Harris, wrote home from the town of Boston, then occupied by
British troops:</p>

<p class="quote">"I wish the Americans may be brought to a sense of
their duty. One good drubbing, which I long to give them, by way of
retaliation, might have a good effect towards it. At present they
are so elated by the petty advantage they gained the 19th of April,
that they despise the powers of Britain. We shall soon take the
field on the other side of the Neck."</p>

<p>This very fairly expressed the irritation in the British camp.
The troops had been sent to Massachusetts to subdue it, but as yet
nothing had been done in that direction.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic8" id="pic8"></a><img alt="" src=
"1403061h-images/battles-8.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption"><b>At The Fence&mdash;The Battle of Bunker
Hill</b>
</p>

<p>The ignominious flight of the British regulars from Lexington
and Concord was still unavenged. More than that, they had been kept
close in Boston ever since by the provincial militia.</p>

<p>"What!" cried General Burgoyne when on his arrival in May he was
told this news. "What! Ten thousand peasants keep five thousand
King's troops shut up? Let <i>us</i> get in, and we'll soon find
elbow-room!" "Elbow-room" was the army's name for Burgoyne after
that.</p>

<p>A little later General Gage remarked to General Timothy Ruggles,
"It is impossible for the rebels to withstand our arms a
moment."</p>

<p>Ruggles replied: "Sir, you do not know with whom you have to
contend. These are the very men who conquered Canada. I fought with
them side by side. I know them well; they will fight bravely. My
God, sir, your folly has ruined your cause!"</p>

<p>Besides Burgoyne, the <i>Cerberus</i> brought over Generals
Clinton and Howe, and large reinforcements, so that the forces
under General Gage, the commander-in-chief, were over ten thousand.
By June 12 the army in Boston was actually unable to procure fresh
provisions, and Gage proclaimed martial law, designating those who
were in arms as rebels and traitors.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex Gazette</i> of June 8 says: "We have the pleasure
to inform the public that the Grand American Army is nearly
completed." This Grand American Army was spread around Boston, its
headquarters at Cambridge, under command of General Artemas Ward,
who had fought under Abercromby. The Grand American Army was an
army of allies. Ward, its supposed chief, was authorised to command
only the Massachusetts and New Hampshire forces, and when the
Connecticut and Rhode Island men obeyed him it was purely through
courtesy. Each colony supplied its own troops with provisions and
ammunition; each had its own officers, appointed by the Committee
of Safety.</p>

<p>To this committee, June 13, came the tidings that Gage proposed
to occupy Bunker Hill, in Charlestown, on the 18th, and a council
of war was held, which included the savagely bluff, warm-hearted
patriot, General Israel Putnam, of the Connecticut troops; General
Seth Pomeroy; Colonel William Prescott; the hardy, independent
Stark; and Captain Gridley, the engineer&mdash;all of whom were
veterans of the French and Indian war.</p>

<p>As a result of the meeting, a detachment of nine hundred men of
the Massachusetts regiments, under Colonels Prescott, Frye, and
Bridge, with two hundred men from Connecticut, and Captain
Gridley's artillery company of forty-nine men and two field-pieces,
were ordered to parade at six o'clock P.M., the 16th, on Cambridge
Common. There they appeared with weapons, packs, blankets, and
entrenching tools. President Langdon, of Harvard College, made an
impressive prayer, and by nine o'clock they had marched, the entire
force being under the command of Colonel Prescott.</p>

<p>A uniform of blue turned back with red was worn by some of the
men, but for the most part they wore their "Sunday suits" of
homespun. Their guns were of all sorts and sizes, and many carried
old-fashioned powder-horns and pouches. Prescott walked at their
head, with two sergeants carrying dark lanterns, until they reached
the Neck.</p>

<p>The Neck was the strip of land leading to the peninsula opposite
Boston, where lay the small town of Charlestown. The peninsula is
only one mile in length, its greatest breadth but half a mile. The
Charles River separates it from Boston on the south, and to the
north and east is the Mystic River. Bunker Hill begins at the
isthmus and rises gradually to a height of one hundred and ten
feet, forming a smooth round hill.</p>

<p>At Cambridge Common, the night the troops started for Bunker
Hill, Israel Putnam had made this eloquent address: "Men, there are
enough of you on the Common this evening to fill hell so full of
the redcoats to-morrow that the devils will break their shins over
them."</p>

<p>At Bunker Hill the expedition halted, and a long discussion
ensued between Prescott, Gridley, Major Brooks, and Putnam as to
whether it would be better to follow Ward's orders literally and
fortify Bunker Hill itself, or to go on to the lesser elevation
south-east of it, which is now known as Breed's Hill, but had then
no special name. They agreed upon Breed's Hill. They began to
entrench at midnight. Prescott was consumed with anxiety lest his
men should be attacked before some screen could be raised to
shelter them. However enthusiastic they might be, he did not think
it possible for his raw troops to meet to any advantage a
disciplined soldiery in the open field.</p>

<p>So the pickaxe and the spade were busy throughout the night. It
was silent work, for the foe was near. In Boston Harbour lay the
<i>Lively,</i> the <i>Somerset,</i> the <i>Cerberus,</i> the
<i>Glasgow,</i> the <i>Falcon,</i> and the <i>Symmetry,</i> besides
the floating batteries. On the Boston shore the sentinels were
pacing outside the British encampment. At intervals through the
night Prescott and Brooks stole down to the shore of Charles River
and listened till the call of "All's well!" rang over the water
from the ships and told them that their scheme was still
undiscovered.</p>

<p>At dawn the entrenchments were six feet high, and there was a
great burst of fire at them from the <i>Lively,</i> which was
joined in a few moments by the other men-of-war and the batteries
on Copp's Hill, on the Boston shore.</p>

<p>The strange thunder of the cannonade brought forth every man,
woman, and child in Boston. Out of their prim houses they rushed
under trellises heavy with damask roses and honeysuckle, and soon
every belfry and tower, house-top and hill-top, was crowded with
them. There the most of them stayed till the thrilling play in
which they had so vital an interest was enacted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prescott, to inspire his raw men with confidence,
mounted the parapet of the redoubt they had raised, and
deliberately sauntered around it, making jocular speeches, until
the men cheered each cannon-ball as it came.</p>

<p>Gage, looking through his field-glasses from the other shore,
marked the tall figure with the three-cornered hat and the
banyan&mdash;a linen blouse&mdash;buckled about the waist, and
asked of Councillor Willard, who stood near him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is the person who appears to command?"</p>

<p>"That is my brother-in-law, Colonel Prescott."</p>

<p>"Will he fight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he is an old soldier, and will fight as long as a
drop of blood remains in his veins."</p>

<p>"The works must be carried," said Gage.</p>

<p>Gage was strongly advised by his generals to land a force at the
Neck and attack the Americans in the rear. It was also suggested
that they might be bombarded by the fleet from the Mystic and the
Charles, and, indeed, might be starved out without any fighting at
all. But none of this suited the warlike British temper; the whole
army longed to fight&mdash;to chase the impudent enemy out of those
entrenchments he had so insolently reared. The challenge was a bold
one; it must be accepted. The British had the weight in all ways,
but they also had the preposterous arrogance of the British army,
which always deems itself invincible because it remembers its
traditions, and traditions are dubious and improper weapons to fire
at a foe.</p>

<p>At noon the watchers on the house-tops saw the lines of smart
grenadiers and light infantry embark in barges under command of
General Howe, who had with him Brigadier-General Pigot and some of
the most distinguished officers in Boston. They landed at the
south-western point of the peninsula.</p>

<p>When the intelligence that the British troops had landed reached
Cambridge it caused great excitement. A letter of Captain Chester
reads:</p>

<p class="letter">"Just after dinner on the 17th ult. I was walking
out from my lodgings, quite calm and composed, and all at once the
drums beat to arms, and bells rang, and a great noise in Cambridge.
Captain Putnam came by on full gallop. 'What is the matter?' says
I. 'Have you not heard?' 'No.' 'Why, the regulars are landing at
Charlestown,' says he, 'and father says you must all meet and march
immediately to Bunker Hill to oppose the enemy.' I waited not, but
ran and got my arms and ammunition, and hastened to my company (who
were in the church for barracks), and found them nearly ready to
march. We soon marched, with our frocks and trousers on over our
other clothes (for our company is in uniform wholly blue, turned up
with red), for we were loath to expose ourselves by our dress; and
down we marched."</p>

<p>After a reconnaissance, Howe sent back to Gage for
reinforcements, and remained passive until they came.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were bitter murmurings among the troops on
Breed's Hill. They had watched the brilliant pageant,&mdash;the
crossing over of their adversaries, scarlet-clad, with glittering
equipments, with formidable guns in their train,&mdash;and were
conscious of being themselves exhausted from the night's labour and
the hot morning sun. It was two o'clock, and they had had
practically nothing to eat that day. Among themselves they accused
their officers of treachery. It seemed incredible that after doing
all the hard work they should be expected to do the fighting as
well. Loud huzzas arose from their lips, however,&mdash;these cross
and hungry Yankees,&mdash;when Doctor&mdash;or General&mdash;Joseph
Warren appeared among them with Seth Pomeroy.</p>

<p>Few men had risen to a higher degree of universal love and
confidence in the hearts of the Massachusetts people than Warren.
He had been active in every patriotic movement. The councils
through which the machinery of the Revolution was put in motion
owed much to him. He was president of the Committee of Safety, and
probably had been one of the Indians of the Boston Tea Party. But a
few days before he had been appointed major-general. In recognition
of this, Israel Putnam, who was keeping a squad of men working at
entrenchments on Bunker Hill, had offered to take orders from him.
But Warren refused, and asked where he might go to be of the
greatest service. "Where will the onset be most furious?" he asked,
and Putnam sent him to the redoubt. There Prescott also offered him
the chief command, but Warren replied, "I came as a volunteer with
my musket to serve under you, and shall be happy to learn from a
soldier of your experience."</p>

<p>At three o'clock the redoubt was in good working order. About
eight yards square, its strongest side, the front, faced the
settled part of Charlestown and protected the south side of the
hill. The east side commanded a field; the north side had an open
passage&mdash;way; to the left extended a breastwork for about two
hundred yards.</p>

<p>By three o'clock some reinforcements for General Howe had
arrived, so that he now had over three thousand men. Just before
action he addressed the officers around him as follows:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I am very happy in having the honour of commanding
so fine a body of men. I do not in the least doubt that you will
behave like Englishmen and as becomes good soldiers. If the enemy
will not come out from their entrenchments, we must drive them out
at all events; otherwise the town of Boston will be set on fire by
them. I shall not desire one of you to go a step farther than where
I go myself at your head. Remember, gentlemen, we have no recourse
to any resources if we lose Boston but to go on board our ships,
which will be very disagreeable to us all."</p>

<p>From the movements of the British, they seemed intending to turn
the American left and surround the redoubt. To prevent this,
Prescott sent down the artillery with two field-pieces&mdash;he had
only four altogether&mdash;and the Connecticut troops under Captain
Knowlton. Putnam met them as they neared the Mystic,
shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Man the rail fence, for the enemy is flanking of us fast!"</p>

<p>This rail fence, half of which was stone, reached from the shore
of the Mystic to within 200 yards of the breastworks. It was not
high, but Putnam had said:</p>

<p>"If you can shield a Yankee's shins he's not afraid of anything.
His head he does not think of."</p>

<p>Captain Knowlton, joined by Colonels Stark and Reid and their
regiments, made another parallel fence a short distance in front of
this, filling in the space between with new-mown hay from the
fields.</p>

<p>A great cannonade was thundering from ships and batteries to
cover Howe's advance. His troops, now increased to three thousand,
came on in two divisions: the left wing, under Pigot, towards the
breastwork and redoubt; the right, led by Howe, to storm the rail
fence. The artillery moved heavily through the miry low ground, and
the embarrassing discovery was made that there were only
twelve-pound balls for six-pounders. H owe decided to load them
with grape. The troops were hindered by a number of fences, as well
as the thick, tall grass. Their knapsacks were extraordinarily
heavy, and they felt the power of the scorching sun.</p>

<p>Inside the redoubt the Americans waited for them, Prescott
assuring his men that the redcoats would never reach the redoubt if
they obeyed him and reserved their fire until he gave the word. As
the assaulting force drew temptingly near, the American officers
only restrained their men from firing by mounting the parapet and
kicking up their guns.</p>

<p>But at last the word was given&mdash;the stream of fire broke
out all along the line. They were wonderful marksmen. The
magnificent regulars were staggered, but they returned the fire.
They could make no headway against the murderous volleys flashed in
quick succession at them. The dead and wounded fell thickly.
General Pigot ordered a retreat, while great shouts of triumph
arose from the Americans.</p>

<p>At the rail fence Putnam gave his last directions when Howe was
nearing him:</p>

<p>"Fire low: aim at the waistbands! Wait until you see the whites
of their eyes! Aim at the handsome coats! Pick off the
commanders!"</p>

<p>The men rested their guns on the rail fence to fire. The
officers were used as targets&mdash;many of the handsome coats were
laid low. So hot was the reception they met that in a few moments
Howe's men were obliged to fall back. One of them said afterwards,
"It was the strongest post that was ever occupied by any set of
men."</p>

<p>There was wild exultation within the American lines,
congratulation and praises, for just fifteen minutes; and then
Pigot and Howe led the attack again. But the second repulse was so
much fiercer than the first that the British broke ranks and ran
down hill, some of them getting into the boats.</p>

<p>"The dead," said Stark, "lay in front of us as thick as sheep in
a fold."</p>

<p>Meantime Charlestown had been set on fire by Howe's orders, and
the spectacle was splendidly terrible to the watchers in Boston.
The wooden buildings made a superb blaze, and through the smoke
could be seen the British officers striking and pricking their men
with their swords in the vain hope of rallying them, while cannon,
musketry, crashes of falling houses, and the yells of the victors
filled up the measure of excitement to the spectators.</p>

<p>Twice, now, the Americans had met the foe and proved that he was
not invincible. The women in Boston thought the last defeat
final&mdash;that their men-folk had gained the day. But Prescott
knew better; he was sure that they would come again, and sure that
he could not withstand a third attack.</p>

<p>If at this juncture strong reinforcements and supplies of
ammunition had reached him, he might well have held his own. But
such companies as had been sent on would come no farther than
Bunker Hill, in spite of Israel Putnam's threats and entreaties.
There they straggled about under hay-cocks and apple-trees,
demoralised by the sights and sounds of battle, with no authorised
leader who could force them to the front.</p>

<p>As for their commander-in-chief, Ward, he would not stir from
his house all day, and kept the main body of his forces at
Cambridge.</p>

<p>When General Clinton saw the rout of his countrymen from the
Boston shore, he rowed over in great haste. With his assistance,
and the fine discipline which prevailed, the troops were re-formed
within half an hour. Clinton also proposed a new plan of assault.
Accordingly, instead of diffusing their forces across the whole
American front, the chief attack was directed on the redoubt. The
artillery bombarded the breastwork, and only a small number moved
against the rail fence.</p>

<p>"Fight! conquer or die!" was the watchword that passed from
mouth to mouth as the tall, commanding figure of Howe led on the
third assault. To his soldiers it was a desperate
venture&mdash;they felt that they were going to certain death. But
inside the redoubt few of the men had more than one round of
ammunition left, though they shouted bravely:</p>

<p>"We are ready for the redcoats again!"</p>

<p>Again their first fire was furious and destructive, but although
many of the enemy fell, the rest bounded forward without returning
it. In a few minutes the columns of Pigot and Clinton had
surrounded the redoubt on three sides. The defenders of the
breastwork had been driven by the artillery fire into the redoubt,
and balls came whistling through the open passage.</p>

<p>The first rank of redcoats who climbed the parapet was shot
down. Major Pitcairn met his death at this time while cheering on
his men. But the Americans had come to the end of their ammunition,
and they had not fifty bayonets among them, though these were made
to do good service as the enemy came swarming over the walls.</p>

<p>Pigot got up by the aid of a tree, and hundreds followed his
lead. The Americans made stout resistance in the hand-to-hand
struggle that followed, but there could be only one ending to it,
and Prescott ordered a retreat. He was almost the last to leave,
and only got away by skilfully parrying with his sword the bayonet
thrusts of the foe. His banyan was pierced in many places, but he
escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>The men at the rail fence kept firm until they saw the forces
leaving the redoubt; they fell back then, but in good order.</p>

<p>A great volley was fired after the Americans. It was then that
Warren fell, as he lingered in the rear&mdash;a loss that was
passionately mourned throughout New England.</p>

<p>During their disordered flight over the little peninsula the
Americans lost more men than at any other time of the day, though
their list of killed and wounded only amounted to four hundred and
forty-nine. The heavy loss of the enemy&mdash;ten hundred and
fifty-four men&mdash;had the effect of checking the eagerness of
their pursuit; the Americans passed the Neck without further
molestation.</p>

<p>General Howe had maintained his reputation for solid courage,
and his long white silk stockings were soaked in blood.</p>

<p>The speech of Count Vergennes, that "if it won two more such
victories as Bunker Hill, there would be no more British Army in
America," echoed the general sentiment in England and America as
well as in France. So impressed were the British leaders with the
indomitable resolution shown by the Provincials in fortifying and
defending so desperate a position as Breed's Hill, that they made
no attempt to follow up their victory. General Gage admitted that
the people of New England were not the despicable rabble they had
sometimes been represented.</p>

<p>Among the Grand Army itself many recriminations and
courts-martial followed the contest. But Washington soon drilled it
into order.</p>

<p>The most important thing to be remembered of Bunker Hill is its
effect upon the colonies. The troubles with the mother country had
been brewing a long time, but this was the first decisive struggle
for supremacy. There was no doubt of the tough, soldierly qualities
displayed by the Colonials; the thrill of pride that went through
the country at the success of their arms welded together the
scattered colonies and made a nation of them. The Revolution was an
accomplished fact. "England," said Franklin, "has lost her colonies
for ever."</p>
