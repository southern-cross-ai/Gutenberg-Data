<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<p>To yesterday and to to-day I say my polite "vaya usted con
Dios." What are these days to me? But that far-off day of my
romance, when from between the blue and white bales in Don
Ramon's darkened storeroom, at Kingston, I saw the door open
before the figure of an old man with the tired, long, white face,
that day I am not likely to forget. I remember the chilly smell
of the typical West Indian store, the indescribable smell of damp
gloom, of locos, of pimento, of olive oil, of new sugar, of new
rum; the glassy double sheen of Ramon's great spectacles, the
piercing eyes in the mahogany face, while the tap, tap, tap of a
cane on the flags went on behind the inner door; the click of the
latch; the stream of light. The door, petulantly thrust inwards,
struck against some barrels. I remember the rattling of the bolts
on that door, and the tall figure that appeared there, snuffbox
in hand. In that land of white clothes, that precise, ancient,
Castilian in black was something to remember. The black cane that
had made the tap, tap, tap dangled by a silken cord from the hand
whose delicate blue-veined, wrinkled wrist ran back into a foam
of lawn ruffles. The other hand paused in the act of conveying a
pinch of snuff to the nostrils of the hooked nose that had, on
the skin stretched tight over the bridge, the polish of old
ivory; the elbow pressing the black cocked-hat against the side;
the legs, one bent, the other bowing a little back&mdash;this was
the attitude of Seraphina's father.</p>
<p>Having imperiously thrust the door of the inner room open, he
remained immovable, with no intention of entering, and called in
a harsh, aged voice: "Se&ntilde;or Ramon! Se&ntilde;or Ramon!"
and then twice: "Sera-phina&mdash;Seraphina!" turning his head
back.</p>
<p>Then for the first time I saw Seraphina, looking over her
father's shoulder. I remember her face on that day; her eyes were
gray&mdash;the gray of black, not of blue. For a moment they
looked me straight in the face, reflectively, unconcerned, and
then travelled to the spectacles of old Ramon.</p>
<p>This glance&mdash;remember I was young on that day&mdash;had
been enough to set me wondering what they were thinking of me;
what they could have seen of me.</p>
<p>"But there he is&mdash;your Se&ntilde;or Ramon," she said to
her father, as if she were chiding him for a petulance in
calling; "your sight is not very good, my poor little
father&mdash;there he is, your Ramon."</p>
<p>The warm reflection of the light behind her, gilding the curve
of her face from ear to chin, lost itself in the shadows of black
lace falling from dark hair that was not quite black. She spoke
as if the words clung to her lips; as if she had to put them
forth delicately for fear of damaging the frail things. She
raised her long hand to a white flower that clung above her ear
like the pen of a clerk, and disappeared. Ramon hurried with a
stiffness of immense respect towards the ancient grandee. The
door swung to.</p>
<p>I remained alone. The blue bales and the white, and the great
red oil jars loomed in the dim light filtering through the
jalousies out of the blinding sunlight of Jamaica. A moment
after, the door opened once more and a young man came out to me;
tall, slim, with very bright, very large black eyes aglow in an
absolute pallor of face. That was Carlos Riego.</p>
<p>Well, that is my yesterday of romance, for the many things
that have passed between those times and now have become dim or
have gone out of my mind. And my day before yesterday was the day
on which I, at twenty-two, stood looking at myself in the tall
glass, the day on which I left my home in Kent and went, as
chance willed it, out to sea with Carlos Riego.</p>
<p>That day my cousin Rooksby had become engaged to my sister
Veronica, and I had a fit of jealous misery. I was rawboned, with
fair hair, I had a good skin, tanned by the weather, good teeth,
and brown eyes. I had not had a very happy life, and I had lived
shut in on myself, thinking of the wide world beyond my reach,
that seemed to hold out infinite possibilities of romance, of
adventure, of love, perhaps, and stores of gold. In the family my
mother counted; my father did not. She was the daughter of a
Scottish earl who had ruined himself again and again. He had been
an inventor, a projector, and my mother had been a poor beauty,
brought up on the farm we still lived on&mdash;the last rag of
land that had remained to her father. Then she had married a good
man in his way; a good enough catch; moderately well off, very
amiable, easily influenced, a dilettante, and a bit of a dreamer,
too. He had taken her into the swim of the Regency, and his purse
had not held out. So my mother, asserting herself, had insisted
upon a return to our farm, which had been her dowry. The
alternative would have been a shabby, ignominious life at Calais,
in the shadow of Brummel and such.</p>
<p>My father used to sit all day by the fire, inscribing "ideas"
every now and then in a pocket-book. I think he was writing an
epic poem, and I think he was happy in an ineffectual way. He had
thin red hair, untidy for want of a valet, a shining, delicate,
hooked nose, narrow-lidded blue eyes, and a face with the colour
and texture of a white-heart cherry. He used to spend his days in
a hooded chair. My mother managed everything, leading an
out-of-door life which gave her face the colour of a wrinkled
pippin. It was the face of a Roman mother, tight-lipped,
brown-eyed, and fierce. You may understand the kind of woman she
was from the hands she employed on the farm. They were smugglers
and night-malefactors to a man&mdash;and she liked that. The
decent, slow-witted, gently devious type of rustic could not live
under her. The neighbours round declared that the Lady Mary
Kemp's farm was a hotbed of disorder. I expect it was, too; three
of our men were hung up at Canterbury on one day&mdash;for
horse-stealing and arson...Anyhow, that was my mother. As for me,
I was under her, and, since I had my aspirations, I had a rather
bitter childhood. And I had others to contrast myself with. First
there was Rooksby: a pleasant, well-spoken, amiable young squire
of the immediate neighbourhood; young Sir Ralph, a man popular
with all sorts, and in love with my sister Veronica from early
days. Veronica was very beautiful, and very gentle, and very
kind; tall, slim, with sloping white shoulders and long white
arms, hair the colour of amber, and startled blue eyes&mdash;a
good mate for Rooksby. Rooksby had foreign relations, too. The
uncle from whom he inherited the Priory had married a Riego, a
Castilian, during the Peninsular war. He had been a prisoner at
the time&mdash;he had died in Spain, I think. When Ralph made the
grand tour, he had made the acquaintance of his Spanish
relations; he used to talk about them, the Riegos, and Veronica
used to talk of what he said of them until they came to stand for
Romance, the romance of the outer world, to me. One day, a little
before Ralph and Veronica became engaged, these Spaniards
descended out of the blue. It was Romance suddenly dangled right
before my eyes. It was Romance; you have no idea what it meant to
me to talk to Carlos Riego.</p>
<p>Rooksby was kind enough. He had me over to the Priory, where I
made the acquaintance of the two maiden ladies, his second
cousins, who kept house for him. Yes, Ralph was kind; but I
rather hated him for it, and was a little glad when he, too, had
to suffer some of the pangs of jealousy&mdash;jealousy of Carlos
Riego.</p>
<p>Carlos was dark, and of a grace to set Ralph as much in the
shade as Ralph himself set me; and Carlos had seen a deal more of
the world than Ralph. He had a foreign sense of humour that made
him forever ready to sacrifice his personal dignity. It made
Veronica laugh, and even drew a grim smile from my mother; but it
gave Ralph bad moments. How he came into these parts was a little
of a mystery. When Ralph was displeased with this Spanish
connection he used to swear that Carlos had cut a throat or taken
a purse. At other times he used to say that it was a political
matter. In fine, Carlos had the hospitality of the Priory, and
the title of Count when he chose to use it. He brought with him a
short, pursy, bearded companion, half friend, half servant, who
said he had served in Napoleon's Spanish contingent, and had a
way of striking his breast with a wooden hand (his arm had
suffered in a cavalry charge), and exclaiming, "I, Tomas
Castro!..." He was an Andalusian.</p>
<p>For myself, the first shock of his strangeness over-come, I
adored Carlos, and Veronica liked him, and laughed at him, till
one day he said good-by and rode off along the London road,
followed by his Tomas Castro. I had an intense longing to go with
him out into the great world that brooded all round our
foothills.</p>
<p>You are to remember that I knew nothing whatever of that great
world. I had never been further away from our farm than just to
Canterbury school, to Hythe market, to Romney market. Our farm
nestled down under the steep, brown downs, just beside the Roman
road to Canterbury; Stone Street&mdash;the Street&mdash;we called
it. Ralph's land was just on the other side of the Street, and
the shepherds on the downs used to see of nights a dead-and-gone
Rooksby, Sir Peter that was, ride upon it past the quarry with
his head under his arm. I don't think I believed in him, but I
believed in the smugglers who shared the highway with that
horrible ghost. It is impossible for any one nowadays-to conceive
the effect these smugglers had upon life thereabouts and then.
They were the power to which everything else deferred. They used
to overrun the country in great bands, and brooked no
interference with their business. Not long before they had
defeated regular troops in a pitched battle on the Marsh, and on
the very day I went away I remember we couldn't do our carting
because the smugglers had given us notice they would need our
horses in the evening. They were a power in the land where there
was violence enough without them, God knows! Our position on that
Street put us in the midst of it all. At dusk we shut our doors,
pulled down our blinds, sat round the fire, and knew pretty well
what was going on outside. There would be long whistles in the
dark, and when we found men lurking in our barns we feigned not
to see them&mdash;it was safer so. The smugglers&mdash;the Free
Traders, they called themselves&mdash;were as well organized for
helping malefactors out of the country as for running goods in;
so it came about that we used to have comers and forgers,
murderers and French spies&mdash;all sorts of
malefactors&mdash;hiding in our straw throughout the day,
wait-for the whistle to blow from the Street at dusk. I, born
with my century, was familiar with these things; but my mother
forbade my meddling with them. I expect she knew enough
herself&mdash;all the resident gentry did. But Ralph&mdash;though
he was to some extent of the new school, and used to boast that,
if applied to, he "would grant a warrant against any Free
Trader"&mdash;never did, as a matter of fact, or not for many
years.</p>
<p>Carlos, then, Rooksby's Spanish kinsman, had come and gone,
and I envied him his going, with his air of mystery, to some
far-off lawless adventures&mdash;perhaps over there in Spain,
where there were war and rebellion. Shortly afterwards Rooksby
proposed for the hand of Veronica and was accepted&mdash;by my
mother. Veronica went about looking happy. That upset me, too. It
seemed unjust that she should go out into the great
world&mdash;to Bath, to Brighton, should see the Prince Regent
and the great fights on Hounslow Heath&mdash;whilst I was to
remain forever a farmer's boy. That afternoon I was upstairs,
looking at the reflection of myself in the tall glass, wondering
miserably why I seemed to be such an oaf.</p>
<p>The voice of Rooksby hailed me suddenly from downstairs. "Hey,
John&mdash;John Kemp; come down, I say!"</p>
<p>I started away from the glass as if I had been taken in an act
of folly. Rooksby was flicking his leg with his switch in the
doorway, at the bottom of the narrow flight of stairs.</p>
<p>He wanted to talk to me, he said, and I followed him out
through the yard on to the soft road that climbs the hill to
westward. The evening was falling slowly and mournfully; it was
dark already in the folds of the sombre downs.</p>
<p>We passed the corner of the orchard. "I know what you've got
to tell me," I said. "You're going to marry Veronica. Well,
you've no need of my blessing. Some people have all the luck.
Here am I...look at me!"</p>
<p>Ralph walked with his head bent down.</p>
<p>"Confound it," I said, "I shall run away to sea! I tell you,
I'm rotting, rotting! There! I say, Ralph, give me Carlos'
direction..." I caught hold of his arm. "I'll go after him. He'd
show me a little life. He said he would."</p>
<p>Ralph remained lost in a kind of gloomy abstraction, while I
went on worrying him for Carlos' address.</p>
<p>"Carlos is the only soul I know outside five miles from here.
Besides, he's friends in the Indies. That's where I want to go,
and he could give me a cast. You remember what Tomas Castro
said..."</p>
<p>Rooksby came to a sudden halt, and began furiously to switch
his corded legs.</p>
<p>"Curse Carlos, and his Castro, too. They'll have me in jail
betwixt them. They're both in my red barn, if you want their
direction..."</p>
<p>He hurried on suddenly up the hill, leaving me gazing upwards
at him. When I caught him up he was swearing&mdash;as one did in
those days&mdash;and stamping his foot in the middle of the
road.</p>
<p>"I tell you," he said violently, "it's the most accursed
business! That Castro, with his Cuba, is nothing but a blasted
buccaneer...and Carlos is no better. They go to Liverpool for a
passage to Jamaica, and see what comes of it!"</p>
<p>It seems that on Liverpool docks, in the owl-light, they fell
in with an elderly hunks just returned from West Indies, who asks
the time at the door of a shipping agent. Castro pulls out a
watch, and the old fellow jumps on it, vows it's his own, taken
from him years before by some picaroons on his outward voyage.
Out from the agent's comes another, and swears that Castro is one
of the self-same crew. He himself purported to be the master of
the very ship. Afterwards&mdash;in the solitary dusk among the
ropes and bales&mdash;there had evidently been some play with
knives, and it ended with a flight to London, and then down to
Rooksby's red barn, with the runners in full cry after them.</p>
<p>"Think of it," Rooksby said, "and me a justice, and...oh, it
drives me wild, this hole-and-corner work! There's a filthy
muddle with the Free Traders&mdash;a whistle to blow after dark
at the quarry. To-night of all nights, and me a justice...and as
good as a married man!"</p>
<p>I looked at him wonderingly in the dusk; his high coat collar
almost hid his face, and his hat was pressed down over his eyes.
The thing seemed incredible to me. Here was an adventure, and I
was shocked to see that Rooksby was in a pitiable state about
it.</p>
<p>"But, Ralph," I said, "I would help Carlos."</p>
<p>"Oh, you," he said fretfully. "You want to run your head into
a noose; that's what it comes to. Why, I may have to flee the
country. There's the red-breasts poking their noses into every
cottage on the Ashford road." He strode on again. A wisp of mist
came stealing down the hill. "I can't give my cousin up. He could
be smuggled out, right enough. But then I should have to get
across salt water, too, for at least a year.
Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He seemed ready to tear his hair, and then I put in my say. He
needed a little persuasion, though, in spite of Veronica.</p>
<p>I should have to meet Carlos Riego and Castro in a little
fir-wood above the quarry, in half an hour's time. All I had to
do was to whistle three bars of "Lillibulero," as a signal. A
connection had been already arranged with the Free Traders on the
road beside the quarry, and they were coming down that night, as
we knew well enough, both of us. They were coming in force from
Canterbury way down to the Marsh. It had cost Ralph a pretty
penny; but, once in the hands of the smugglers, his cousin and
Castro would be safe enough from the runners; it would have
needed a troop of horse to take them. The difficulty was that of
late the smugglers themselves had become demoralized. There were
ugly rumours of it; and there was a danger that Castro and
Carlos, if not looked after, might end their days in some
marsh-dyke. It was desirable that someone well known in our parts
should see them to the seashore. A boat, there, was to take them
out into the bay, where an outward-bound West Indiaman would pick
them up. But for Ralph's fear for his neck, which had increased
in value since its devotion to Veronica, he would have squired
his cousin. As it was, he fluttered round the idea of letting me
take his place. Finally he settled it; and I embarked on a long
adventure. <a name="2HCH0002"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>Between moonrise and sunset I was stumbling through the
bracken of the little copse that was like a tuft of hair on the
brow of the great white quarry. It was quite dark, in among the
trees. I made the circuit of the copse, whistling softly my three
bars of "Lillibulero." Then I plunged into it. The bracken
underfoot rustled and rustled. I came to a halt. A little bar of
light lay on the horizon in front of me, almost colourless. It
was crossed again and again by the small fir-trunks that were
little more than wands. A woodpigeon rose with a sudden crash of
sound, flapping away against the branches. My pulse was dancing
with delight&mdash;my heart, too. It was like a game of
hide-and-seek, and yet it was life at last. Everything grew
silent again and I began to think I had missed my time. Down
below in the plain, a great way off, a dog was barking
continuously. I moved forward a few paces and whistled. The glow
of adventure began to die away. There was nothing at all&mdash;a
little mystery of light on the tree-trunks.</p>
<p>I moved forward again, getting back towards the road. Against
the glimmer of dead light I thought I caught the outlines of a
man's hat down among the tossing lines of the bracken. I
whispered loudly:</p>
<p>"Carlos! Carlos!"</p>
<p>There was a moment of hoarse whispering; a sudden gruff sound.
A shaft of blazing yellow light darted from the level of the
ground into my dazed eyes. A man sprang at me and thrust
something cold and knobby into my neckcloth. The light continued
to blaze into my eyes; it moved upwards and shone on a red
waistcoat dashed with gilt buttons. I was being arrested..."In
the King's name..." It was a most sudden catastrophe. A hand was
clutching my windpipe.</p>
<p>"Don't you so much as squeak, Mr. Castro," a voice whispered
in my ear.</p>
<p>The lanthorn light suddenly died out, and I heard
whispers.</p>
<p>"Get him out on to the road...I'll tackle the other...
Darbies...Mind his knife."</p>
<p>I was like a confounded rabbit in their hands. One of them had
his fist on my collar and jerked me out upon the hard road. We
rolled down the embankment, but he was on the top. It seemed an
abominable episode, a piece of bad faith on the part of fate. I
ought to have been exempt from these sordid haps, but the man's
hot leathery hand on my throat was like a foretaste of the other
collar. And I was horribly afraid&mdash;horribly&mdash;of the
sort of mysterious potency of the laws that these men
represented, and I could think of nothing to do.</p>
<p>We stood in a little slanting cutting in the shadow. A watery
light before the moon's rising slanted downwards from the hilltop
along the opposite bank. We stood in utter silence.</p>
<p>"If you stir a hair," my captor said coolly, "I'll squeeze the
blood out of your throat, like a rotten orange."</p>
<p>He had the calmness of one dealing with an everyday incident;
yet the incident was&mdash;it should have been&mdash;tremendous.
We stood waiting silently for an eternity, as one waits for a
hare to break covert before the beaters. From down the long hill
came a small sound of horses' hoofs&mdash;a sound like the
beating of the heart, intermittent&mdash;a muffled thud on turf,
and a faint clink of iron. It seemed to die away unheard by the
runner beside me. Presently there was a crackling of the short
pine branches, a rustle, and a hoarse whisper said from
above:</p>
<p>"Other's cleared, Thorns. Got that one safe?"</p>
<p>"All serene."</p>
<p>The man from above dropped down into the road, a clumsy,
cloaked figure. He turned his lanthorn upon me, in a painful
yellow glare.</p>
<p>"What! 'Tis the young 'un," he grunted, after a moment. "Read
the warrant, Thorns."</p>
<p>My captor began to fumble in his pocket, pulled out a paper,
and bent down into the light. Suddenly he paused and looked up at
me.</p>
<p>"This ain't&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Lilly white, I don't
believe this ain't a Jack Spaniard."</p>
<p>The clinks of bits and stirrup-irons came down in a waft
again.</p>
<p>"That be hanged for a tale, Thorns," the man with the lanthorn
said sharply. "If this here ain't Riego&mdash;or the
other&mdash;I'll..."</p>
<p>I began to come out of my stupor.</p>
<p>"My name's John Kemp," I said.</p>
<p>The other grunted. "Hurry up, Thorns."</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Lillywhite," Thorns reasoned, "he don't speak like a
Dago. Split me if he do! And we ain't in a friendly country
either, you know that. We can't afford to rile the gentry!"</p>
<p>I plucked up courage.</p>
<p>"You'll get your heads broke," I said, "if you wait much
longer. Hark to that!"</p>
<p>The approaching horses had turned off the turf on to the hard
road; the steps of first one and then another sounded out down
the silent hill. I knew it was the Free Traders from that; for
except between banks they kept to the soft roadsides as if it
were an article of faith. The noise of hoofs became that of an
army.</p>
<p>The runners began to consult. The shadow called Thorns was for
bolting across country; but Lilly white was not built for speed.
Besides he did not know the lie of the land, and believed the
Free Traders were mere bogeys.</p>
<p>"They'll never touch us," Lillywhite grumbled. "We've a
warrant... King's name..." He was flashing his lanthorn aimlessly
up the hill.</p>
<p>"Besides," he began again, "we've got this gallus bird. If
he's not a Spaniard, he knows all about them. I heard him. Kemp
he may be, but he spoke Spanish up there...and we've got
something for our trouble. He'll swing, I'll lay you
a&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>From far above us came a shout, then a confused noise of
voices. The moon began to get up; above the cutting the clouds
had a fringe of sudden silver. A horseman, cloaked and muffled to
the ears, trotted warily towards us.</p>
<p>"What's up?" he hailed from a matter of ten yards. "What are
you showing that glim for? Anything wrong below?"</p>
<p>The runners kept silence; we heard the click of a pistol
lock.</p>
<p>"In the King's name," Lillywhite shouted, "get off that nag
and lend a hand! We've a prisoner."</p>
<p>The horseman gave an incredulous whistle, and then began to
shout, his voice winding mournfully uphill, "Hallo!
Hallo&mdash;o&mdash;o." An echo stole back, "Hallo!
Hallo&mdash;o&mdash;o"; then a number of voices. The horse stood,
drooping its head, and the man turned in his saddle. "Runners,"
he shouted, "Bow Street runners! Come along, come along, boys!
We'll roast 'em...Runners! Runners!"</p>
<p>The sound of heavy horses at a jolting trot came to our
ears.</p>
<p>"We're in for it," Lillywhite grunted.
"D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n this county of Kent."</p>
<p>Thorns never loosed his hold of my collar. At the steep of the
hill the men and horses came into sight against the white sky, a
confused crowd of ominous things.</p>
<p>"Turn that lanthorn off'n me," the horseman said. "Don't you
see you frighten my horse? Now, boys, get round them..."</p>
<p>The great horses formed an irregular half-circle round us; men
descended clumsily, like sacks of corn. The lanthorn was seized
and flashed upon us; there was a confused hubbub. I caught my own
name.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Kemp...John Kemp," I called. "I'm true blue."</p>
<p>"Blue be hanged!" a voice shouted back. "What be you a-doing
with runners?"</p>
<p>The riot went on&mdash;forty or fifty voices. The runners were
seized; several hands caught at me. It was impossible to make
myself heard; a fist struck me on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Gibbet 'em," somebody shrieked; "they hung my nephew! Gibbet
'em all the three. Young Kemp's mother's a bad 'un. An informer
he is. Up with 'em!"</p>
<p>I was pulled down on my knees, then thrust forward, and then
left to myself while they rushed to bonnet Lillywhite. I stumbled
against a great, quiet farm horse.</p>
<p>A continuous scuffling went on; an imperious voice cried:
"Hold your tongues, you fools! Hold your tongues!..." Someone
else called: "Hear to Jack Rangsley. Hear to him!"</p>
<p>There was a silence. I saw a hand light a torch at the
lanthorn, and the crowd of faces, the muddle of limbs, the
horses' heads, and the quiet trees above, flickered into
sight.</p>
<p>"Don't let them hang me, Jack Rangsley," I sobbed. "You know
I'm no spy. Don't let 'em hang me, Jack."</p>
<p>He rode his horse up to me, and caught me by the collar.</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue," he said roughly. He began to make a set
speech, anathematizing runners. He moved to tie our feet, and
hang us by our finger-nails over the quarry edge.</p>
<p>A hubbub of assent and dissent went up; then the crowd became
unanimous. Rangsley slipped from his horse.</p>
<p>"Blindfold 'em, lads," he cried, and turned me sharply
round.</p>
<p>"Don't struggle," he whispered in my ear; his silk
handkerchief came cool across my eyelids. I felt hands fumbling
with a knot at the back of my head. "You're all right," he said
again. The hubbub of voices ceased suddenly. "Now, lads, bring
'em along."</p>
<p>A voice I knew said their watchword, "Snuff and enough,"
loudly, and then, "What's agate?"</p>
<p>Someone else answered, "It's Rooksby, it's Sir Ralph."</p>
<p>The voice interrupted sharply, "No names, now. I don't want
hanging." The hand left my arm; there was a pause in the motion
of the procession. I caught a moment's sound of whispering. Then
a new voice cried, "Strip the runners to the shirt. Strip 'em.
That's it." I heard some groans and a cry, "You won't murder us."
Then a nasal drawl, "We will sure&mdash;<i>ly</i>." Someone else,
Rangsley, I think, called, "Bring 'em along&mdash;this way
now."</p>
<p>After a period of turmoil we seemed to come out of the crowd
upon a very rough, descending path; Rangsley had called out,
"Now, then, the rest of you be off; we've got enough here"; and
the hoofs of heavy horses sounded again. Then we came to a halt,
and Rangsley called sharply &iuml;rom close to me:</p>
<p>"Now, you runners&mdash;and you, John Kemp&mdash;here you be
on the brink of eternity, above the old quarry. There's a sheer
drop of a hundred feet. We'll tie your legs and hang you by your
fingers. If you hang long enough, you'll have time to say your
prayers. Look alive, lads!"</p>
<p>The voice of one of the runners began to shout, "You'll swing
for this&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>As for me I was in a dream. "Jack," I said, "Jack, you
won't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," the voice said in a whisper. "Mum,
now! It's all <i>right</i>."</p>
<p>It withdrew itself a little from my ear and called, "'Now
then, ready with them. When I say three..."</p>
<p>I heard groans and curses, and began to shout for help. My
voice came back in an echo, despairingly. Suddenly I was dragged
backward, and the bandage pulled from my eyes,</p>
<p>"Come along," Rangsley said, leading me gently enough to the
road, which was five steps behind. "It's all a joke," he snarled.
"A pretty bad one for those catchpolls. Hear 'em groan. The
drop's not two feet."</p>
<p>We made a few paces down the road; the pitiful voices of the
runners crying for help came plainly to my ears.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;they&mdash;aren't murdering them?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, no," he answered. "Can't afford to. Wish we could; but
they'd make it too hot for us."</p>
<p>We began to descend the hill. From the quarry a voice
shrieked:</p>
<p>"Help&mdash;help&mdash;for the love of God&mdash;I
can't..."</p>
<p>There was a grunt and the sound of a fall; then a precisely
similar sequence of sounds.</p>
<p>"That'll teach 'em," Rangsley said ferociously. "Come
along&mdash;they've only rolled down a bank. They weren't over
the quarry. It's all right. I swear it is."</p>
<p>And, as a matter of fact, that was the smugglers' ferocious
idea of humour. They would hang any undesirable man, like these
runners, whom it would make too great a stir to murder outright,
over the edge of a low bank, and swear to him that he was clawing
the brink of Shakespeare's Cliff or any other hundred-foot drop.
The wretched creatures suffered all the tortures of death before
they let go, and, as a rule, they never returned to our parts.

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>The spirit of the age has changed; everything has changed so
utterly that one can hardly believe in the existence of one's
earlier self. But I can still remember how, at that moment, I
made the acquaintance of my heart&mdash;a thing that bounded and
leapt within my chest, a little sickeningly. The other details I
forget.</p>
<p>Jack Rangsley was a tall, big-boned, thin man, with something
sinister in the lines of his horseman's cloak, and something
reckless in the way he set his spurred heel on the ground. He was
the son of an old Marsh squire. Old Rangsley had been head of the
last of the Owlers&mdash;the aristocracy of export
smugglers&mdash;and Jack had sunk a little in becoming the head
of the Old Bourne Tap importers. But he was hard enough,
tyrannical enough, and had nerve enough to keep Free-trading
alive in our parts until long after it had become an anachronism.
He ended his days on the gallows, of course, but that was long
afterwards.</p>
<p>"I'd give a dollar to know what's going on in those runners'
heads," Rangsley said, pointing back with his crop. He laughed
gayly. The great white face of the quarry rose up pale in the
moonlight; the dusky red fires of the limekilns glowed at the
base, sending up a blood-red dust of sullen smoke. "I'll swear
they think they've dropped straight into hell.</p>
<p>"You'll have to cut the country, John," he added suddenly,
"they'll have got your name uncommon pat. I did my best for you."
He had had me tied up like that before the runners' eyes in order
to take their suspicions off me. He had made a pretence to murder
me with the same idea. But he didn't believe they were taken in.
"There'll be warrants out before morning, if they ain't too
shaken. But what were you doing in the business? The two
Spaniards were lying in the fern looking on when you come
blundering your clumsy nose in. If it hadn't been for Rooksby you
might have&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Hullo, there!" he broke off.</p>
<p>An answer came from the black shadow of a clump of roadside
elms. I made out the forms of three or four horses standing with
their heads together.</p>
<p>"Come along," Rangsley said; "up with you. We'll talk as we
go."</p>
<p>Someone helped me into a saddle; my legs trembled in the
stirrups as if I had ridden a thousand miles on end already. I
imagine I must have fallen into a stupor; for I have only a vague
impression of somebody's exculpating himself to me. As a matter
of fact, Ralph, after having egged me on, in the intention of
staying at home, had had qualms of conscience, and had come to
the quarry. It was he who had cried the watchword, "Snuff and
enough," and who had held the whispered consultation. Carlos and
Castro had waited in their hiding-place, having been spectators
of the arrival of the runners and of my capture. I gathered this
long afterwards. At that moment I was conscious only of the
motion of the horse beneath me, of intense weariness, and of the
voice of Ralph, who was lamenting his own cowardice.</p>
<p>"If it had come at any other time!" he kept on repeating. "But
now, with Veronica to think of!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; You take me,
Johnny, don't you?"</p>
<p>My companions rode silently. After we had passed the houses of
a little village a heavy mist fell upon us, white, damp, and
clogging. Ralph reined his horse beside mine.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he began again, "I'm miserably sorry I got you
into this scrape. I swear I wouldn't have had it happen, not for
a thousand pounds&mdash;not for ten."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," I said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Ah, but," Rooksby said, "you'll have to leave the country for
a time. Until I can arrange. I will. You can trust me."</p>
<p>"Oh, he'll have to leave the country, for sure," Rangsley said
jovially, "if he wants to live it down. There's five-and-forty
warrants out against me&mdash;but they dursent serve 'em. But
he's not me."</p>
<p>"It's a miserable business," Ralph said. He had an air of the
profoundest dejection. In the misty light he looked like a man
mortally wounded, riding from a battle-field.</p>
<p>"Let him come with us," the musical voice of Carlos came
through the mist in front of us. "He shall see the world a
little."</p>
<p>"For God's sake hold your tongue!" Ralph answered him.
"There's mischief enough. He shall go to France."</p>
<p>"Oh, let the young blade rip about the world for a year or
two, squire," Rangsley's voice said from behind us.</p>
<p>In the end Ralph let me go with Carlos&mdash;actually across
the sea, and to the West Indies. I begged and implored him; it
seemed that now there was a chance for me to find my world of
romance. And Ralph, who, though one of the most law-respecting of
men, was not for the moment one of the most valorous, was wild to
wash his hands of the whole business. He did his best for me; he
borrowed a goodly number of guineas from Rangsley, who travelled
with a bag of them at his saddle-bow, ready to pay his men their
seven shillings a head for the run.</p>
<p>Ralph remembered, too&mdash;or I remembered for him&mdash;that
he had estates and an agent in Jamaica, and he turned into the
big inn at the junction of the London road to write a letter to
his agent bidding him house me and employ me as an improver. For
fear of compromising him we waited in the shadow of trees a
furlong or two down the road. He came at a trot, gave me the
letter, drew me aside, and began upbraiding himself again. The
others rode onwards.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right," I said. "It's fine&mdash;it's fine. I'd
have given fifty guineas for this chance this morning&mdash;and,
Ralph, I say, you may tell Veronica why I'm going, but keep a
shut mouth to my mother. Let her think I've run away&mdash;eh?
Don't spoil your chance."</p>
<p>He was in such a state of repentance and flutter that he could
not let me take a decent farewell. The sound of the others'
horses had long died away down the hill when he began to tell me
what he ought to have done.</p>
<p>"I knew it at once after I'd let you go. I ought to have kept
you out of it. You came near being murdered. And to think of
it&mdash;you, her brother&mdash;to be&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right," I said gayly, "it's all right. You've to
stand by Veronica. I've no one to my back. Good-night,
good-by."</p>
<p>I pulled my horse's head round and galloped down the hill. The
main body had halted before setting out over the shingle to the
shore. Rangsley was waiting to conduct us into the town, where we
should find a man to take us three fugitives out to the expected
ship. We rode clattering aggressively through the silence of the
long, narrow main street. Every now and then Carlos Riego coughed
lamentably, but Tomas Castro rode in gloomy silence. There was a
light here and there in a window, but not a soul stirring abroad.
On the blind of an inn the shadow of a bearded man held the
shadow of a rummer to its mouth.</p>
<p>"That'll be my uncle," Rangsley said. "He'll be the man to do
your errand." He called to one of the men behind. "Here, Joe
Pilcher, do you go into the White Hart and drag my Uncle Tom out.
Bring 'un up to me&mdash;to the nest."</p>
<p>Three doors further on we came to a halt, and got down from
our horses.</p>
<p>Rangsley knocked on a shutter-panel, two hard knocks with the
crop and three with the naked fist. Then a lock clicked, heavy
bars rumbled, and a chain rattled. Rangsley pushed me through the
doorway. A side door opened, and I saw into a lighted room filled
with wreaths of smoke. A paunchy man in a bob wig, with a blue
coat and Windsor buttons, holding a churchwarden pipe in his
right hand and a pewter quart in his left, came towards us.</p>
<p>"Hullo, captain," he said, "you'll be too late with the
lights, won't you?" He had a deprecatory air.</p>
<p>"Your watch is fast, Mr. Mayor," Rangsley answered surlily;
"the tide won't serve for half an hour yet."</p>
<p>"Cht, cht," the other wheezed. "No offence. We respect you.
But still, when one has a stake, one likes to know."</p>
<p>"My stake's all I have, and my neck," Rangsley said
impatiently; "what's yours? A matter of fifty pun ten?...Why
don't you make them bring they lanthorns?"</p>
<p>A couple of dark lanthorns were passed to Rangsley, who
half-uncovered one, and lit the way up steep wooden stairs. We
climbed up to a tiny cock-loft, of which the side towards the sea
was all glazed.</p>
<p>"Now you sit there, on the floor," Rangsley commanded; "can't
leave you below; the runners will be coming to the mayor for new
warrants to-morrow, and he'd not like to have spent the night in
your company."</p>
<p>He threw a casement open. The moon was hidden from us by
clouds, but, a long way off, over the distant sea, there was an
irregular patch of silver light, against which the chimneys of
the opposite houses were silhouetted. The church clock began
muffledly to chime the quarters behind us; then the hour
struck&mdash;ten strokes.</p>
<p>Rangsley set one of his lanthorns on the window and twisted
the top. He sent beams of yellow light shooting out to seawards.
His hands quivered, and he was mumbling to himself under the
influence of ungovernable excitement. His stakes were very large,
and all depended on the flicker of those lanthorns out towards
the men on the luggers that were hidden in the black expanse of
the sea. Then he waited, and against the light of the window I
could see him mopping his forehead with the sleeve of his coat;
my heart began to beat softly and insistently&mdash;out of
sympathy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the deep shadow of the cloud above the sea, a
yellow light flashed silently cut&mdash;very small, very distant,
very short-lived. Rangsley heaved a deep sigh and slapped me
heavily on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"All serene, my buck," he said; "now let's see after you. I've
half an hour. What's the ship?"</p>
<p>I was at a loss, but Carlos said out of the darkness, "The
ship the <i>Thames</i>. My friend Se&ntilde;or Ortiz, of the
Minories, said you would know."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know, I know," Rangsley said softly; and, indeed, he
did know all that was to be known about smuggling out of the
southern counties of people who could no longer inhabit them. The
trade was a survival of the days of Jacobite plots. "And it's a
hanging job, too. But it's no affair of mine." He stopped and
reflected for an instant.</p>
<p>I could feel Carlos' eyes upon us, looking out of the thick
darkness. A slight rustling came from the corner that hid
Castro.</p>
<p>"She passes down channel to-night, then?" Rangsley said. "With
this wind you'll want to be well out in the Bay at a quarter
after eleven."</p>
<p>An abnormal scuffling, intermingled with snatches of jovial
remonstrance, made itself heard from the bottom of the ladder. A
voice called up through the hatch, "Here's your uncle, Squahre
Jack," and a husky murmur corroborated.</p>
<p>"Be you drunk again, you old sinner?" Rangsley asked. "Listen
to me... Here's three men to be set aboard the <i>Thames</i> at a
quarter after eleven."</p>
<p>A grunt came in reply.</p>
<p>Rangsley repeated slowly.</p>
<p>The grunt answered again.</p>
<p>"Here's three men to be set aboard the <i>Thames</i> at a
quarter after eleven..." Rangsley said again.</p>
<p>"Here's...a-cop...three men to be set aboard <i>Thames</i> at
quarter after eleven," a voice hiccoughed back to us.</p>
<p>"Well, see you do it," Rangsley said. "He's as drunk as a
king," he commented to us; "but when you've said a thing three
times, he remembers&mdash;hark to him."</p>
<p>The drunken voice from below kept up a constant babble of,
"Three men to be set aboard <i>Thames</i>...three men to be
set..."</p>
<p>"He'll not stop saying that till he has you safe aboard,"
Rangsley said. He showed a glimmer of light down the
ladder&mdash;Carlos and Castro descended. I caught sight below me
of the silver head and the deep red ears of the drunken uncle of
Rangsley. He had been one of the most redoubtable of the family,
a man of immense strength and cunning, but a confirmed habit of
consuming a pint and a half of gin a night had made him
disinclined for the more arduous tasks of the trade. He limited
his energies to working the underground passage, to the success
of which his fox-like cunning, and intimate knowledge of the
passing shipping, were indispensable. I was preparing to follow
the others down the ladder when Rangsley touched my arm.</p>
<p>"I don't like your company," he said close behind my ear. "I
know who they are. There were bills out for them this morning.
I'd blow them, and take the reward, but for you and Squahre
Rooksby. They're handy with their knives, too, I fancy. You mind
me, and look to yourself with them. There's something
unnatural."</p>
<p>His words had a certain effect upon me, and his manner perhaps
more. A thing that was "unnatural" to Jack Rangsley&mdash;the man
of darkness, who lived forever as if in the shadow of the
gallows&mdash;was a thing to be avoided. He was for me nearly as
romantic a figure as Carlos himself, but for his forbidding
darkness, and he was a person of immense power. The silent
flittings of lights that I had just seen, the answering signals
from the luggers far out to sea, the enforced sleep of the towns
and countryside whilst his plans were working out at night, had
impressed me with a sense of awe. And his words sank into my
spirit, and made me afraid for my future.</p>
<p>We followed the others downwards into a ground-floor room that
was fitted up as a barber's shop. A rushlight was burning on a
table. Rangsley took hold of a piece of wainscotting, part of the
frame of a panel; he pulled it towards him, and, at the same
moment, a glazed show-case full of razors and brushes swung
noiselessly forward with an effect of the supernatural. A small
opening, just big enough to take a man's body, revealed itself.
We passed through it and up a sort of tunnel. The door at the
other end, which was formed of panels, had a manger and straw
crib attached to it on the outside, and let us into a horse's
stall. We found ourselves in the stable of the inn.</p>
<p>"We don't use this passage for ourselves," Rangsley said.
"Only the most looked up to need to&mdash;the justices and such
like. But gallus birds like you and your company, it's best for
us not to be seen in company with. Follow my uncle now.
Good-night."</p>
<p>We went into the yard, under the pillars of the town hall,
across the silent street, through a narrow passage, and down to
the sea. Old Rangsley reeled ahead of us swiftly, muttering,
"Three men to be set aboard the <i>Thames</i>...quarter past
eleven. Three men to be set aboard..." and in a few minutes we
stood upon the shingle beside the idle sea, that was nearly at
the full. <a name="2HCH0004"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<br></div>
<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>It was, I suppose, what I demanded of Fate&mdash;to be gently
wafted into the position of a hero of romance, without rough
hands at my throat. It is what we all ask, I suppose; and we get
it sometimes in ten-minute snatches. I didn't know where I was
going. It was enough for me to sail in and out of the patches of
shadow that fell from the moon right above our heads.</p>
<p>We embarked, and, as we drew further out, the land turned to a
shadow, spotted here and there with little lights. Behind us a
cock crowed. The shingle crashed at intervals beneath the feet of
a large body of men. I remembered the smugglers; but it was as if
I had remembered them only to forget them forever. Old Rangsley,
who steered with the sheet in his hand, kept up an unintelligible
babble. Carlos and Castro talked under their breaths. Along the
gunwale there was a constant ripple and gurgle. Suddenly old
Rangsley began to sing; his voice was hoarse and drunken.</p>
<pre>
     "When Harol' war in va&mdash;a&mdash;ded,
     An' fallin', lost his crownd,
     An' Normun Willium wa&mdash;a&mdash;ded."
</pre>
<p>The water murmured without a pause, as if it had a million
tiny facts to communicate in very little time. And then old
Rangsley hove to, to wait for the ship, and sat half asleep,
lurching over the tiller. He was a very, unreliable scoundrel.
The boat leaked like a sieve. The wind freshened, and we three
began to ask ourselves how it was going to end. There were no
lights upon the sea.</p>
<p>At last, well out, a blue gleam caught our eyes; but by this
time old Rangsley was helpless, and it fell to me to manage the
boat. Carlos was of no use&mdash;he knew it, and, without saying
a word, busied himself in bailing the water out. But Castro, I
was surprised to notice, knew more than I did about a boat, and,
maimed as he was, made himself useful.</p>
<p>"To me it looks as if we should drown," Carlos said at one
point, very quietly. "I am sorry for you, Juan."</p>
<p>"And for yourself, too," I answered, feeling very hopeless,
and with a dogged grimness.</p>
<p>"Just now, my young cousin, I feel as if I should not mind
dying under the water," he remarked with a sigh, but without
ceasing to bail for a moment.</p>
<p>"Ah, you are sorry to be leaving home, and your friends, and
Spain, and your fine adventures," I answered.</p>
<p>The blue flare showed a very little nearer. There was nothing
to be done but talk and wait.</p>
<p>"No; England," he answered in a tone full of
meaning&mdash;"things in England&mdash;people there. One person
at least."</p>
<p>To me his words and his smile seemed to imply a bitter irony;
but they were said very earnestly.</p>
<p>Castro had hauled the helpless form of old Rangsley forward. I
caught him muttering savagely:</p>
<p>"I could kill that old man!"</p>
<p>He did not want to be drowned; neither assuredly did I. But it
was not fear so much as a feeling of dreariness and
disappointment that had come over me, the sudden feeling that I
was going not to adventure, but to death; that here was not
romance, but an end&mdash;a disenchanted surprise that it should
soon be all over.</p>
<p>We kept a grim silence. Further out in the bay, we were caught
in a heavy squall. Sitting by the tiller, I got as much out of
her as I knew how. We would go as far as we could before the run
was over. Carlos bailed unceasingly, and without a word of
complaint, sticking to his self-appointed task as if in very
truth he were careless of life. A feeling came over me that this,
indeed, was the elevated and the romantic. Perhaps he was tired
of his life; perhaps he really regretted what he left behind him
in England, or somewhere else&mdash;some association, some woman.
But he, at least, if we went down together, would go gallantly,
and without complaint, at the end of a life with associations,
movements, having lived and regretted. I should disappear
in-gloriously on the very threshold.</p>
<p>Castro, standing up unsteadily, growled, "We may do it yet!
See, se&ntilde;or!"</p>
<p>The blue gleam was much larger&mdash;it flared smokily up
towards the sky. I made out ghastly parallelograms of a ship's
sails high above us, and at last many faces peering unseeingly
over the rail in our direction. We all shouted together.</p>
<p>I may say that it was thanks to me that we reached the ship.
Our boat went down under us whilst I was tying a rope under
Carlos' arms. He was standing up with the baler still in his
hand. On board, the women passengers were screaming, and as I
clung desperately to the rope that was thrown me, it struck me
oddly that I had never before heard so many women's voices at the
same time. Afterwards, when I stood on the deck, they began
laughing at old Rangsley, who held forth in a thunderous voice,
punctuated by hiccoughs:</p>
<p>"They carried I aboard&mdash;a cop&mdash;theer lugger and
sinks I in the cold, co&mdash;old sea."</p>
<p>It mortified me excessively that I should be tacked to his
tail and exhibited to a number of people, and I had a sudden
conviction of my small importance. I had expected something
altogether different&mdash;an audience sympathetically interested
in my desire for a passage to the West Indies; instead of which
people laughed while I spoke in panting jerks, and the water
dripped out of my clothes. After I had made it clear that I
wanted to go with Carlos, and could pay for my passage, I was
handed down into the steerage, where a tallow candle burnt in a
thick, blue atmosphere. I was stripped and filled with some fiery
liquid, and fell asleep. Old Rangsley was sent ashore with the
pilot.</p>
<p>It was a new and strange life to me, opening there suddenly
enough. The <i>Thames</i> was one of the usual West Indiamen; but
to me even the very ropes and spars, the sea, and the unbroken
dome of the sky, had a rich strangeness. Time passed lazily and
gliding. I made more fully the acquaintance of my companions, but
seemed to know them no better. I lived with Carlos in the
cabin&mdash;Castro in the half-deck; but we were all three pretty
constantly together, and they being the only Spaniards on board,
we were more or less isolated from the other passengers.</p>
<p>Looking at my companions at times, I had vague misgivings. It
was as if these two had fascinated me to the verge of some
danger. Sometimes Castro, looking up, uttered vague ejaculations.
Carlos pushed his hat back and sighed. They had preoccupations,
cares, interests in which they let me have no part.</p>
<p>Castro struck me as absolutely ruffianly. His head was knotted
in a red, white-spotted handkerchief; his grizzled beard was
tangled; he wore a black and rusty cloak, ragged at the edges,
and his feet were often bare; at his side would lie his wooden
right hand. As a rule, the place of his forearm was taken by a
long, thin, steel blade, that he was forever sharpening.</p>
<p>Carlos talked with me, telling me about his former life and
his adventures. The other passengers he discountenanced by a
certain coldness of manner that made me ashamed of talking to
them. I respected him so; he was so wonderful to me then. Castro
I detested; but I accepted their relationship without in the
least understanding how Carlos, with his fine grain, his high
soul&mdash;I gave him credit for a high soul&mdash;could put up
with the squalid ferocity with which I credited Castro. It seemed
to hang in the air round the grotesque ragged-ness of the
saturnine brown man.</p>
<p>Carlos had made Spain too hot to hold him in those tortuous
intrigues of the Army of the Faith and Bourbon troops and Italian
legions. From what I could understand, he must have played fast
and loose in an insolent manner. And there was some woman
offended. There was a gayness and gallantry in that part of it.
He had known the very spirit of romance, and now he was sailing
gallantly out to take up his inheritance from an uncle who was a
great noble, owning the greater part of one of the Intendencias
of Cuba.</p>
<p>"He is a very old man, I hear," Carlos said&mdash;"a little
doting, and having need of me."</p>
<p>There were all the elements of romance about Carlos'
story&mdash;except the actual discomforts of the ship in which we
were sailing. He himself had never been in Cuba or seen his
uncle; but he had, as I have indicated, ruined himself in one way
or another in Spain, and it had come as a God-send to him when
his uncle had sent Tomas Castro to bring him to Cuba, to the town
of Rio Medio.</p>
<p>"The town belongs to my uncle. He is very rich; a Grand
d'Espagne... everything; but he is now very old, and has left
Havana to die in his palace in his own town. He has an only
daughter, a Dona Seraphina, and I suppose that if I find favour
in his eyes I shall marry her, and inherit my uncle's great
riches; I am the only one that is left of the family to inherit."
He waved his hand and smiled a little. "<i>Vaya</i>; a little of
that great wealth would be welcome. If I had had a few pence more
there would have been none of this worry, and I should not have
been on this dirty ship in these rags." He looked down
good-humouredly at his clothes.</p>
<p>"But," I said, "how do you come to be in a scrape at all?"</p>
<p>He laughed a little proudly.</p>
<p>"In a scrape?" he said. "I...I am in none. It is Tomas Castro
there." He laughed affectionately. "He is as faithful as he is
ugly," he said; "but I fear he has been a villain, too...What do
I know? Over there in my uncle's town, there are some
villains&mdash;you know what I mean, one must not speak too
loudly on this ship. There is a man called O'Brien, who
mismanages my uncle's affairs. What do I know? The good Tomas has
been in some villainy that is no affair of mine. He is a good
friend and a faithful dependent of my family's. He certainly had
that man's watch&mdash;the man we met by evil chance at
Liverpool, a man who came from Jamaica. He had bought it&mdash;of
a bad man, perhaps, I do not ask. It was Castro your police
wished to take. But I, <i>bon Dieu</i>, do you think I would take
watches?"</p>
<p>I certainly did not think he had taken a watch; but I did not
relinquish the idea that he, in a glamorous, romantic way, had
been a pirate. Rooksby had certainly hinted as much in his
irritation.</p>
<p>He lost none of his romantic charm in my eyes. The fact that
he was sailing in uncomfortable circumstances detracted little;
nor did his clothes, which, at the worst, were better than any I
had ever had. And he wore them with an air and a grace. He had
probably been in worse circumstances when campaigning with the
Army of the Faith in Spain. And there was certainly the uncle
with the romantic title and the great inheritance, and the
cousin&mdash;the Miss Seraphina, whom he would probably marry. I
imagined him an aristocratic scapegrace, a corsair&mdash;it was
the Byronic period then&mdash;sailing out to marry a sort of
shimmering princess with hair like Veronica's, bright golden, and
a face like that of a certain keeper's daughter. Carlos, however,
knew nothing about his cousin; he cared little more, as far as I
could tell. "What can she be to me since I have seen your...?" he
said once, and then stopped, looking at me with a certain tender
irony. He insisted, though, that his aged uncle was in need of
him. As for Castro&mdash;he and his rags came out of a life of
sturt and strife, and I hoped he might die by treachery. He had
undoubtedly been sent by the uncle across the seas to find Carlos
and bring him out of Europe; there was-something romantic in that
mission. He was now a dependent of the Riego family, but there
were unfathomable depths in that tubby little man's past. That he
had gone to Russia at the tail of the Grande Arm&eacute;e, one
could not help believing. He had been most likely in the grand
army of sutlers and camp-followers. He could talk convincingly of
the cold, and of the snows and his escape. And from his allusions
one could get glimpses of what he had been before and
afterwards&mdash;apparently everything that was questionable in a
secularly disturbed Europe; no doubt somewhat of a bandit; a
guerrillero in the sixes and sevens; with the Army of the Faith
near the French border, later on.</p>
<p>There had been room and to spare for that sort of pike, in the
muddy waters, during the first years of the century. But the
waters were clearing, and now the good Castro had been dodging
the gallows in the Antilles or in Mexico. In his heroic moods he
would swear that his arm had been cut off at Somo Sierra; swear
it with a great deal of asseveration, making one see the Polish
lancers charging the gunners, being cut down, and his own sword
arm falling suddenly.</p>
<p>Carlos, however, used to declare with affectionate cynicism
that the arm had been broken by the cudgel of a Polish peasant
while Castro was trying to filch a pig from a stable..."I cut his
throat out, though," Castro would grumble darkly; "so, like that,
and it matters very little&mdash;it is even an improvement. See,
I put on my blade. See, I transfix you that fly there...See how
astonished he was. He did never expect that." He had actually
impaled a crawling cockroach. He spent his days cooking
extraordinary messes, crouching for hours over a little charcoal
brazier that he lit surreptitiously in the back of his bunk,
making substitutes for eternal <i>gaspachos</i>.</p>
<p>All these things, if they deepened the romance of Carlos'
career, enhanced, also, the mystery. I asked him one day, "But
why do you go to Jamaica at all if you are bound for Cuba?"</p>
<p>He looked at me, smiling a little mournfully.</p>
<p>"Ah, Juan mio," he said, "Spain is not like your England,
unchanging and stable. The party who reign to-day do not love me,
and they are masters in Cuba as in Spain. But in his province my
uncle rules alone. There I shall be safe." He was condescending
to roll some cigarettes for Tomas, whose wooden hand incommoded
him, and he tossed a fragment of tobacco to the wind with a
laugh. "In Jamaica there is a merchant, a Se&ntilde;or Ramon; I
have letters to him, and he shall find me a conveyance to Rio
Medio, my uncle's town. He is an <i>quliado</i>."</p>
<p>He laughed again. "It is not easy to enter that place,
Juanino."</p>
<p>There was certainly some mystery about that town of his
uncle's. One night I overheard him say to Castro:</p>
<p>"Tell me, O my Tomas, would it be safe to take this
<i>caballero</i>, my cousin, to Rio Medio?"</p>
<p>Castro paused, and then murmured gruffly:</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, unless that Irishman is consulted beforehand,
or the English lord would undertake to join with the picaroons,
it is very assuredly not safe."</p>
<p>Carlos made a little exclamation of mild astonishment.</p>
<p>"<i>Pero?</i> Is it so bad as that in my uncle's own
town?"</p>
<p>Tomas muttered something that I did not catch, and then:</p>
<p>"If the English <i>caballero</i> committed indiscretions, or
quarrelled&mdash;and all these people quarrel, why, God
knows&mdash;that Irish devil could hang many persons, even
myself, or take vengeance on your worship."</p>
<p>Carlos was silent as if in a reverie. At last he said:</p>
<p>"But if affairs are like this, it would be well to have one
more with us. The <i>caballero</i>, my cousin, is very strong and
of great courage."</p>
<p>Castro grunted, "Oh, of a courage! But as the proverb says,
'If you set an Englishman by a hornets' nest they shall not
remain long within.":</p>
<p>After that I avoided any allusion to Cuba, because the thing,
think as I would about it, would not grow clear. It was plain
that something illegal was going on there, or how could "that
Irish devil," whoever he was, have power to hang Tomas and be
revenged on Carlos? It did not affect my love for Carlos, though,
in the weariness of this mystery, the passage seemed to drag a
little. And it was obvious enough that Carlos was unwilling or
unable to tell anything about what pre-, occupied him.</p>
<p>I had noticed an intimacy spring up between the ship's second
mate and Tomas, who was, it seemed to me, forever engaged in long
confabulations in the man's cabin, and, as much to make talk as
for any other reason, I asked Carlos if he had noticed his
dependent's familiarity. It was noticeable because Castro held
aloof from every other soul on board. Carlos answered me with one
of his nervous and angry smiles.</p>
<p>"Ah, Juan mine, do not ask too many questions! I wish you
could come with me all the way, but I cannot tell you all I know.
I do not even myself know all. It seems that the man is going to
leave the ship in Jamaica, and has letters for that Se&ntilde;or
Ramon, the merchant, even as I have. <i>Vaya</i>; more I cannot
tell you."</p>
<p>This struck me as curious, and a little of the whole mystery
seemed from that time to attach to the second mate, who before
had been no more to me than a long, sallow Nova Scotian, with a
disagreeable intonation and rather offensive manners. I began to
watch him, desultorily, and was rather startled by something more
than a suspicion that he himself was watching me. On one occasion
in particular I seemed to observe this. The second mate was
lankily stalking the deck, his hands in his pockets. As he paused
in his walk to spit into the sea beside me, Carlos said:</p>
<p>"And you, my Juan, what will you do in this Jamaica?"</p>
<p>The sense that we were approaching land was already all over
the ship. The second mate leered at me enigmatically, and moved
slowly away. I said that I was going to the Horton Estates,
Rooksby's, to learn planting under a Mr. Macdonald, the agent.
Carlos shrugged his shoulders. I suppose I had spoken with some
animation.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, with his air of great wisdom and varied
experience, of disillusionment, "it will be much the same as it
has been at your home&mdash;after the first days. Hard work and a
great sameness." He began to cough violently.</p>
<p>I said bitterly enough, "Yes. It will be always the same with
me. I shall never see life. You've seen all that there is to see,
so I suppose you do not mind settling down with an old uncle in a
palace."</p>
<p>He answered suddenly, with a certain darkness of manner, "That
is as God wills. Who knows? Perhaps life, even in my uncle's
palace, will not be so safe."</p>
<p>The second mate was bearing down on us again.</p>
<p>I said jocularly, "Why, when I get very tired of life at
Horton Pen, I shall come to see you in your uncle's town."</p>
<p>Carlos had another of his fits of coughing.</p>
<p>"After all, we are kinsmen. I dare say you would give me a
bed," I went on.</p>
<p>The second mate was quite close to us then.</p>
<p>Carlos looked at me with an expression of affection that a
little shamed my lightness of tone:</p>
<p>"I love you much more than a kinsman, Juan," he said. "I wish
you could come with me. I try to arrange it. Later, perhaps, I
may be dead. I am very ill."</p>
<p>He was undoubtedly ill. Campaigning in Spain, exposure in
England in a rainy time, and then the ducking when we came on
board, had done him no good. He looked moodily at the sea.</p>
<p>"I wish you could come. I will try&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>The mate had paused, and was listening quite unaffectedly,
behind Carlos' back.</p>
<p>A moment after Carlos half turned and regarded him with a
haughty stare.</p>
<p>He whistled and walked away.</p>
<p>Carlos muttered something that I did not catch about "spies of
that pestilent Irishman." Then:</p>
<p>"I will not selfishly take you into any more dangers," he
said. "But life on a sugar plantation is not fit for you."</p>
<p>I felt glad and flattered that a personage so romantic should
deem me a fit companion for himself. He went forward as if with
some purpose.</p>
<p>Some days afterwards the second mate sent for me to his cabin.
He had been on the sick list, and he was lying in his bunk,
stripped to the waist, one arm and one leg touching the floor. He
raised himself slowly when I came in, and spat. He had in a
pronounced degree the Nova Scotian peculiarities and accent, and
after he had shaved, his face shone like polished leather.</p>
<p>"Hallo!" he said. "See heeyur, young Kemp, does your neck just
<i>itch</i> to be stretched?"</p>
<p>I looked at him with mouth and eyes agape.</p>
<p>He spat again, and waved a claw towards the forward
bulkhead.</p>
<p>"They'll do it for yeh," he said. "You're such a green goose,
it makes me sick a bit. You hevn't reckoned out the chances, not
quite. It's a kind of dead reckoning yeh hevn't had call to make.
Eh?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>He looked at me, grinning, half naked, with amused contempt,
for quite a long time, and at last offered sardonically to open
my eyes for me.</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>"Do you know what will happen to you," he asked, "ef yeh don't
get quit of that Carlos of yours?"</p>
<p>I was surprised into muttering that I didn't know.</p>
<p>"I can tell yeh," he continued. "Yeh will get hanged."</p>
<p>By that time I was too amazed to get angry. I simply suspected
the Blue Nose of being drunk. But he glared at me so soberly that
next moment I felt frightened.</p>
<p>"Hanged by the neck," he repeated; and then added, "Young
fellow, you scoot. Take a fool's advice, and <i>scoot</i>. That
Castro is a blame fool, anyhow. Yeh want men for that job. Men, I
tell you." He slapped his bony breast.</p>
<p>I had no idea that he could look so ferocious. His eyes
fascinated me, and he opened his cavernous mouth as if to swallow
me. His lantern jaws snapped without a sound. He seemed to change
his mind.</p>
<p>"I am done with yeh," he said, with a sort of sinister
restraint. He rose to his feet, and, turning his back to me,
began to shave, squinting into a broken looking-glass.</p>
<p>I had not the slightest inkling of his meaning. I only knew
that going out of his berth was like escaping from the dark lair
of a beast into a sunlit world. There is no denying that his
words, and still more his manner, had awakened in me a sense of
insecurity that had no precise object, for it was manifestly
absurd and impossible to suspect my friend Carlos. Moreover,
hanging was a danger so recondite, and an eventuality so
extravagant, as to make the whole thing ridiculous. And yet I
remembered how unhappy I felt, how inexplicably unhappy.
Presently the reason was made clear. I was homesick. I gave no
further thought to the second mate. I looked at the harbour we
were entering, and thought of the home I had left so eagerly.
After all, I was no more than a boy, and even younger in mind
than in body.</p>
<p>Queer-looking boats crawled between the shores like tiny water
beetles. One headed out towards us, then another. I did not want
them to reach us. It was as if I did not wish my solitude to be
disturbed, and I was not pleased with the idea of going ashore. A
great ship, floating high on the water, black and girt with the
two broad yellow streaks of her double tier of guns, glided out
slowly from beyond a cluster of shipping in the bay. She passed
without a hail, going out under her topsails with a flag at the
fore. Her lofty spars overtopped our masts immensely, and I saw
the men in her rigging looking down on our decks. The only sounds
that came out of her were the piping of boatswain's calls and the
tramping of feet. Imagining her to be going home, I felt a great
desire to be on board. Ultimately, as it turned out, I went home
in that very ship, but then it was too late. I was another man by
that time, with much queer knowledge and other desires. Whilst I
was looking and longing I heard Carlos' voice behind me asking
one of our sailors what ship it was.</p>
<p>"Don't you know a flagship when you see it?" a voice grumbled
surlily. "Admiral Rowley's," it continued. Then it rumbled out
some remarks about "pirates, vermin, coast of Cuba."</p>
<p>Carlos came to the side, and looked after the man-of-war in
the distance.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> could help us," I heard him mutter. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>There was a lad called Barnes, a steerage passenger of about
my own age, a raw, red-headed Northumbrian yokel, going out as a
recruit to one of the West Indian regiments. He was a serious,
strenuous youth, and I had talked a little with him at odd
moments. In my great loneliness I went to say good-by to him
after I had definitely parted with Carlos.</p>
<p>I had been in our cabin. A great bustle of shore-going, of
leave-taking had sprung up all over the ship. Carlos and Castro
had entered with a tall, immobile, gold-spectacled Spaniard,
dressed all in white, and with a certain air of noticing and
attentive deference, bowing a little as he entered the cabin in
earnest conference with Tomas Castro. Carlos had preceded them
with a certain nonchalance, and the Spaniard&mdash;it was the
Se&ntilde;or Ramon, the merchant I had heard of&mdash;regarded
him as if with interested curiosity. With Tomas he seemed already
familiar. He stood in the doorway, against the strong light,
bowing a little.</p>
<p>With a certain courtesy, touched with indifference, Carlos
made him acquainted with me. Ramon turned his searching, quietly
analytic gaze upon me.</p>
<p>"But is the <i>caballero</i> going over, too?" he asked.</p>
<p>Carlos said, "No. I think not, now."</p>
<p>And at that moment the second mate, shouldering his way
through a white-clothed crowd of shore people, made up behind
Se&ntilde;or Ramon. He held a letter in his hand.</p>
<p>"I am going over," he said, in his high nasal voice, and with
a certain ferocity.</p>
<p>Ramon looked round apprehensively.</p>
<p>Carlos said, "The se&ntilde;or, my cousin, wishes for a Mr.
Macdonald. You know him, senor?"</p>
<p>Ramon made a dry gesture of perfect acquaintance. "I think I
have seen him just now," he said. "I will make inquiries."</p>
<p>All three of them had followed him, and became lost in the
crowd. It was then, not knowing whether I should ever see Carlos
again, and with a desperate, unhappy feeling of loneliness, that
I had sought out Barnes in the dim immensity of the steerage.</p>
<p>In the square of wan light that came down the scuttle he was
cording his hair-trunk&mdash;unemotional and very matter-of-fact.
He began to talk in an everyday voice about his plans. An uncle
was going to meet him, and to house him for a day or two before
he went to the barracks.</p>
<p>"Mebbe we'll meet again," he said. "I'll be here many years, I
think."</p>
<p>He shouldered his trunk and climbed unromantically up the
ladder. He said he would look for Macdonald for me.</p>
<p>It was absurd to suppose that the strange ravings of the
second mate had had an effect on me. "Hanged! Pirates!" Was
Carlos really a pirate, or Castro, his humble friend? It was vile
of me to suspect Carlos. A couple of men, meeting by the scuttle,
began to talk loudly, every word coming plainly to my ears in the
stillness of my misery, and the large deserted steerage. One of
them, new from home, was asking questions. Another answered:</p>
<p>"Oh, I lost half a seroon the last voyage&mdash;the old
thing."</p>
<p>"Haven't they routed out the scoundrels yet?" the other
asked.</p>
<p>The first man lowered his voice. I caught only that "the
admiral was an old fool&mdash;no good for this job. He's found
out the name of the place the pirates come from&mdash;Rio Medio.
That's the place, only he can't get in at it with his
three-deckers. You saw his flagship?"</p>
<p>Rio Medio was the name of the town to which Carlos was
going&mdash;which his uncle owned. They moved away from
above.</p>
<p>What was I to believe? What could this mean? But the second
mate's, "Scoot, young man," seemed to come to my ears like the
blast of a trumpet. I became suddenly intensely anxious to find
Macdonald&mdash;to see no more of Carlos.</p>
<p>From above came suddenly a gruff voice in Spanish.
"Se&ntilde;or, it would be a great folly."</p>
<p>Tomas Castro was descending the ladder gingerly. He was coming
to fetch his bundle. I went hastily into the distance of the
vast, dim cavern of spare room that served for the steerage.</p>
<p>"I want him very much," Carlos said. "I like him. He would be
of help to us."</p>
<p>"It's as your worship wills," Castro said gruffly. They were
both at the bottom of the ladder. "But an Englishman there would
work great mischief. And this youth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I will take him, Tomas," Carlos said, laying a hand on his
arm.</p>
<p>"Those others will think he is a spy. I know them," Castro
muttered. "They will hang him, or work some devil's mischief. You
do not know that Irish judge&mdash;the <i>canaille</i>, the
friend of priests."</p>
<p>"He is very brave. He will not fear," Carlos said.</p>
<p>I came suddenly forward. "I will not go with you," &Iuml;
said, before I had reached them even.</p>
<p>Castro started back as if he had been stung, and caught at the
wooden hand that sheathed his steel blade.</p>
<p>"Ah, it is you, Se&ntilde;or," he said, with an air of relief
and dislike. Carlos, softly and very affectionately, began
inviting me to go to his uncle's town. His uncle, he was sure,
would welcome me. Jamaica and a planter's life were not fit for
me.</p>
<p>I had not then spoken very loudly, or had not made my meaning
very clear. I felt a great desire to find Macdonald, and a simple
life that I could understand.</p>
<p>"I am not going with you," I said, very loudly this time.</p>
<p>He stopped at once. Through the scuttle of the half-deck we
heard a hubbub of voices, of people exchanging greetings, of
Christian names called out joyously. A tumultuous shuffling of
feet went on continuously over our heads. The ship was crowded
with people from the shore. Perhaps Macdonald was amongst them,
even looking for me.</p>
<p>"Ah, <i>amigo mio</i>, but you <i>must</i> now," said Carlos
gently&mdash;"you must&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" And, looking me
straight in the face with a still, penetrating glance of his big,
romantic eyes, "It is a good life," he whispered seductively,
"and I like you, John Kemp. You are young-very young yet. But I
love you very much for your own sake, and for the sake of one I
shall never see again."</p>
<p>He fascinated me. He was all eyes in the dusk, standing in a
languid pose just clear of the shaft of light that fell through
the scuttle in a square patch.</p>
<p>I lowered my voice, too. "What life?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Life in my uncle's palace," he said, so sweetly and
persuasively that the suggestiveness of it caused a thrill in
me.</p>
<p>His uncle could nominate me to posts of honour fit for a
<i>caballero</i>.</p>
<p>I seemed to wake up. "Your uncle the pirate!" I cried, and was
amazed at my own words.</p>
<p>Tomas Castro sprang up, and placed his rough, hot hand over my
lips.</p>
<p>"Be quiet, John Kemp, you fool!" he hissed with sudden
energy.</p>
<p>He had spruced himself, but I seemed to see the rags still
nutter about him. He had combed out his beard, but I could not
forget the knots that had been in it.</p>
<p>"I told your worship how foolish and wrong-headed these
English are," he said sardonically to Carlos. And then to me, "If
the senor speaks loudly again, I shall kill him."</p>
<p>He was evidently very frightened of something.</p>
<p>Carlos, silent as an apparition at the foot of the ladder, put
a finger to his lips and glanced upwards.</p>
<p>Castro writhed his whole body, and I stepped backwards. "I
know what Rio Medio is," I said, not very loudly. "It is a nest
of pirates."</p>
<p>Castro crept towards me again on the points of his toes.
"Se&ntilde;or Don Juan Kemp, child of the devil," he hissed,
looking very much frightened, "you must die!"</p>
<p>I smiled. He was trembling all over. I could hear the talking
and laughing that went on under the break of the poop. Two women
were kissing, with little cries, near the hatchway. I could hear
them distinctly.</p>
<p>Tomas Castro dropped his ragged cloak with a grandiose
gesture.</p>
<p>"By my hand!" he added with difficulty.</p>
<p>He was really very much alarmed. Carlos was gazing up the
hatch. I was ready to laugh at the idea of dying by Tomas
Castro's hand while, within five feet of me, people were laughing
and kissing. I should have laughed had I not suddenly felt his
hand on my throat. I kicked his shins hard, and fell backwards
over a chest. He went back a step or two, flourished his arm,
beat his chest, and turned furiously upon Carlos.</p>
<p>"He will get us murdered," he said. "Do you think we are safe
here? If these people here heard that name they wouldn't wait to
ask who your worship is. They would tear us to pieces in an
instant. I tell you&mdash;<i>moi</i>, Tomas Castro&mdash;he will
ruin us, this white fool&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>
<p>Carlos began to cough, shaken speechless as if by an invisible
devil. Castro's eyes ran furtively all round him, then he looked
at me. He made an extraordinary swift motion with his right hand,
and I saw that he was facing me with a long steel blade
displayed. Carlos continued to cough. The thing seemed odd,
laughable still. Castro began to parade round me: it was as if he
were a cock performing its saltatory rites before attacking.
There was the same tenseness of muscle. He stepped with
extraordinary care on the points of his toes, and came to a stop
about four feet from me. I began to wonder what Rooksby would
have thought of this sort of thing, to wonder why Castro himself
found it necessary to crouch for such a long time. Up above, the
hum of many people, still laughing, still talking, faded a little
out of mind. I understood, horribly, how possible it would be to
die within those few feet of them. Castro's eyes were dusky
yellow, the pupils a great deal inflated, the lines of his mouth
very hard and drawn immensely tight. It seemed extraordinary that
he should put so much emotion into such a very easy killing. I
had my back against the bulkhead, it felt very hard against my
shoulder-blades. I had no dread, only a sort of shrinking from
the actual contact of the point, as one shrinks from being
tickled. I opened my mouth. I was going to shriek a last,
despairing call, to the light and laughter of meetings above when
Carlos, still shaken, with one white hand pressed very hard upon
his chest, started forward and gripped his hand round Castro's
steel. He began to whisper in the other's hairy ear. I
caught:</p>
<p>"You are a fool. He will not make us to be molested, he is my
kinsman."</p>
<p>Castro made a reluctant gesture towards Barnes' chest that lay
between us.</p>
<p>"We could cram him into that," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, bloodthirsty fool," Carlos answered, recovering his
breath; "is it always necessary to wash your hands in blood? Are
we not in enough danger? Up&mdash;up! Go see if the boat is yet
there. We must go quickly; up&mdash;up&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-" He
waved his hand towards the scuttle.</p>
<p>"But still," Castro said. He was reluctantly fitting his
wooden hand upon the blue steel. He sent a baleful yellow glare
into my eyes, and stooped to pick up his ragged cloak.</p>
<p>"Up&mdash;mount!" Carlos commanded.</p>
<p>Castro muttered, "<i>Vamos</i>," and began clumsily to climb
the ladder, like a bale of rags being hauled from above. Carlos
placed his foot on the steps, preparing to follow him. He turned
his head round towards me, his hand extended, a smile upon his
lips.</p>
<p>"Juan," he said, "let us not quarrel. You are very young; you
cannot understand these things; you cannot weigh them; you have a
foolish idea in your head. I wished you to come with us because I
love you, Juan. Do you think I wish you evil? You are true and
brave, and our families are united." He sighed suddenly.</p>
<p>"I do not want to quarrel!" I said. "I don't."</p>
<p>I did not want to quarrel; I wanted more to cry. I was very
lonely, and he was going away. Romance was going out of my
life.</p>
<p>He added musically, "You even do not understand. There is
someone else who speaks for you to me, always&mdash;someone else.
But one day you will. I shall come back for you&mdash;one day."
He looked at me and smiled. It stirred unknown depths of emotion
in me. I would have gone with him, then, had he asked me. "One
day," he repeated, with an extraordinary cadence of tone.</p>
<p>His hand was grasping mine; it thrilled me like a woman's; he
stood shaking it very gently.</p>
<p>"One day," he said, "I shall repay what I owe you. I wished
you with me, because I go into some danger. I wanted you.
Good-by. <i>Hasta mas ver</i>."</p>
<p>He leaned over and kissed me lightly on the cheek, then
climbed away. I felt that the light of Romance was going out of
my life. As we reached the top of the ladder, somebody began to
call harshly, startlingly. I heard my own name and the words,
"mahn ye were speerin' after."</p>
<p>The light was obscured, the voice began clamouring
insistently.</p>
<p>"John Kemp, Johnnie Kemp, noo. Here's the mahn ye were
speerin' after. Here's Macdonald."</p>
<p>It was the voice of Barnes, and the voice of the every day. I
discovered that I had been tremendously upset. The pulses in my
temples were throbbing, and I wanted to shut my eyes&mdash;to
sleep! I was tired; Romance had departed. Barnes and the
Macdonald he had found for me represented all the laborious
insects of the world; all the ants who are forever hauling
immensely heavy and immenlsely unimportant burdens up weary
hillocks, down steep places, getting nowhere and doing
nothing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I hurried up, stumbling at the hatchway against a
man who was looking down. He said nothing at all, and I was dazed
by the light. Barnes remarked hurriedly, "This 'll be your Mr.
Macdonald"; and, turning his back on me, forgot my existence. I
felt more alone than ever. The man in front of me held his head
low, as if he wished to butt me.</p>
<p>I began breathlessly to tell him I had a letter from
"my&mdash;my&mdash;Rooksby&mdash;brother-in-law&mdash;Ralph
Rooks-by"&mdash;I was panting as if I had run a long way. He said
nothing at all. I fumbled for the letter in an inner pocket of my
waistcoat, and felt very shy. Macdonald maintained a portentous
silence; his enormous body was enveloped rather than clothed in a
great volume of ill-fitting white stuff; he held in his hand a
great umbrella with a vivid green lining. His face was very pale,
and had the leaden transparency of a boiled artichoke; it was
fringed by a red beard streaked with gray, as brown flood-water
is with foam. I noticed at last that the reason for his
presenting his forehead to me was an incredible squint&mdash;a
squint that gave the idea that he was performing some tortuous
and defiant feat with the muscles of his neck.</p>
<p>He maintained an air of distrustful inscrutability. The hand
which took my letter was very large, very white, and looked as if
it would feel horribly flabby. With the other he put on his nose
a pair of enormous mother-of-pearl-framed spectacles&mdash;things
exactly like those of a cobra's&mdash;and began to read. He had
said precisely nothing at all. It was for him and what he
represented that I had thrown over Carlos and what <i>he</i>
represented. I felt that I deserved to be received with
acclamation. I was not. He read the letter very deliberately,
swaying, umbrella and all, with the slow movement of a dozing
elephant. Once he crossed his eyes at me, meditatively, above the
mother-of-pearl rims. He was so slow, so deliberate, that I own I
began to wonder whether Carlos and Castro were still on board. It
seemed to be at least half an hour before Macdonald cleared his
throat, with a sound resembling the coughing of a defective pump,
and a mere trickle of a voice asked:</p>
<p>"Hwhat evidence have ye of identitee?"</p>
<p>I hadn't any at all, and began to finger my buttonholes as
shamefaced as a pauper before a Board. The certitude dawned upon
me suddenly that Carlos, even if he would consent to swear to me,
would prejudice my chances.</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking that I came very near to being cast
adrift upon the streets of Kingston. To my asseverations
Macdonald returned nothing but a series of minute "humphs." I
don't know what overcame his scruples; he had shown no signs of
yielding, but suddenly turning on his heel made a motion with one
of his flabby white hands. I understood it to mean that I was to
follow him aft.</p>
<p>The decks were covered with a jabbering turmoil of negroes
with muscular arms and brawny shoulders. All their shining black
faces seem to be momentarily gashed open to show rows of white
teeth, and were spotted with inlaid eyeballs. The sounds coming
from them were a bewildering noise. They were hauling baggage
about aimlessly. A large soft bundle of bedding nearly took me
off my legs. There wasn't room for emotion. Macdonald laid about
him with the handle of the umbrella a few inches from the deck;
but the passage that he made for himself closed behind him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the pushing and hurrying, I came upon a little
clear space beside a pile of boxes. Stooping over them was the
angular figure of Nichols, the second mate. He looked up at me,
screwing his yellow eyes together.</p>
<p>"Going ashore," he asked, "'long of that Puffing Billy?"</p>
<p>"What business is it of yours'" I mumbled sulkily.</p>
<p>Sudden and intense threatening came into his yellow eyes:</p>
<p>"Don't you ever come to you know where," he said; "I don't
want no spies on what I do. There's a man there'll crack your
little backbone if he catches you. Don't yeh come now. Never."

<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<p>"Rio Medio?" Se&ntilde;or Ramon said to me nearly two years
afterwards. "The <i>caballero</i> is pleased to give me credit
for a very great knowledge. What should I know of that town?
There are doubtless good men there and very wicked, as in other
towns. Who knows? Your worship must ask the boats' crews that the
admiral has sent to burn the town. They will be back very soon
now."</p>
<p>He looked at me, inscrutably and attentively, through his gold
spectacles.</p>
<p>It was on the arcade before his store in Spanish Town. Long
sunblinds flapped slightly. Before the next door a large sign
proclaimed "Office of the <i>Buchatoro Journal</i>" It was, as I
have said, after two years&mdash;years which, as Carlos had
predicted, I had found to be of hard work, and long, hot
sameness. I had come down from Horton Pen to Spanish Town,
expecting a letter from Veronica, and, the stage not being in,
had dropped in to chat with Ramon over a consignment of Yankee
notions, which he was prepared to sell at an extravagantly cheap
price. It was just at the time when Admiral Rowley was understood
to be going to make an energetic attempt upon the pirates who
still infested the Gulf of Mexico and nearly ruined the Jamaica
trade of those days. Naturally enough, we had talked of the
mysterious town in which the pirates were supposed to have their
headquarters.</p>
<p>"I know no more than others," Ramon said, "save, senor, that I
lose much more because my dealings are much greater. But I do not
even know whether those who take my goods are pirates, as you
English say, or Mexican privateers, as the Havana authorities
say. I do not very much care. <i>Basta</i>, what I know is that
every week some ship with a letter of marque steals one of my
consignments, and I lose many hundreds of dollars."</p>
<p>Ramon was, indeed, one of the most frequented merchants in
Jamaica; he had stores in both Kingston and Spanish Town; his
cargoes came from all the seas. All the planters and all the
official class in the island had dealings with him.</p>
<p>"It was most natural that the hidalgo, your respected cousin,
should consult me if he wished to go to any town in Cuba. Whom
else should he go to? You yourself, se&ntilde;or, or the
excellent Mr. Topnambo, if you desired to know what ships in a
month's time are likely to be sailing for Havana, for New
Orleans, or any Gulf port, you would ask me. What more natural?
It is my business, my trade, to know these things. In that way I
make my bread. But as for Rio Medio, I do not know the place." He
had a touch of irony in his composed voice. "But it is very
certain," he went on, "that if your Government had not recognized
the belligerent rights of the rebellious colony of Mexico, there
would be now no letters of marque, no accursed Mexican
privateers, and I and everyone else in the island should not now
be losing thousands of dollars every year."</p>
<p>That was the eternal grievance of every Spaniard in the
island&mdash;and of not a few of the English and Scotch planters.
Spain was still in the throes of losing the Mexican colonies when
Great Britain had acknowledged the existence of a state of war
and a Mexican Government. Mexican letters of marque had
immediately filled the Gulf. No kind of shipping was safe from
them, and Spain was quite honestly powerless to prevent their
swarming on the coast of Cuba&mdash;the Ever Faithful Island,
itself.</p>
<p>"What can Spain do," said Ramon bitterly, "when even your
Admiral Rowley, with his great ships, cannot rid the sea of
them?" He lowered his voice. "I tell you, young se&ntilde;or,
that England will lose this Island of Jamaica over this business.
You yourself are a Separationist, are you not?...No? You live
with Separationists. How could I tell? Many people say you
are."</p>
<p>His words gave me a distinctly disagreeable sensation. I
hadn't any idea of being a Separationist; I was loyal enough. But
I understood suddenly, and for the first time, how very much like
one I might look.</p>
<p>"I myself am nothing," Ramon went on impassively; "I am
content that the island should remain English. It will never
again be Spanish, nor do I wish that it should. But our little,
waspish friend there"&mdash;he lifted one thin, brown hand to the
sign of the <i>Buckatoro Journal</i>&mdash;"his paper is doing
much mischief. I think the admiral or the governor will commit
him to jail. He is going to run away and take his paper to
Kingston; I myself have bought his office furniture."</p>
<p>I looked at him and wondered, for all his impassivity, what he
knew&mdash;what, in the depths of his inscrutable Spanish brain,
his dark eyes concealed.</p>
<p>He bowed to me a little. "There will come a very great
trouble," he said.</p>
<p>Jamaica was in those days&mdash;and remained for many years
after&mdash;in the throes of a question. The question was, of
course, that of the abolition of slavery. The planters as a rule
were immensely rich and overbearing. They said, "If the Home
Government tries to abolish our slavery system, we will abolish
the Home Government, and go to the United States for protection."
That was treason, of course; but there was so much of it that the
governor, the Duke of Manchester, had to close his ears and
pretend not to hear. The planters had another grievance&mdash;the
pirates in the Gulf of Mexico. There was one in particular, a
certain El Demonio or Diableto, who practically sealed the
Florida passage; it was hardly possible to get a cargo
underwritten, and the planters' pockets felt it a good deal.
Practically, El Demonio had, during the last two years, gutted a
ship once a week, as if he wanted to help the Kingston
Separationist papers. The planters said, "If the Home Government
wishes to meddle with our internal affairs, our slaves, let it
first clear our seas...Let it hang El Demonio..."</p>
<p>The Government had sent out one of Nelson's old captains,
Admiral Rowley, a good fighting man; but when it came to clearing
the Gulf of Mexico, he was about as useless as a prize-fighter
trying to clear a stable of rats. I don't suppose El Demonio
really did more than a tithe of the mischief attributed to him,
but in the peculiar circumstances he found himself elevated to
the rank of an important factor in colonial politics. The
Ministerialist papers used to kill him once a month; the
Separationists made him capture one of old Rowley's sloops five
times a year. They both lied, of course. But obviously Rowley and
his frigates weren't much use against a pirate whom they could
not catch at sea, and who lived at the bottom of a bottle-necked
creek with tooth rocks all over the entrance&mdash;that was the
sort of place Rio Medio was reported to be...</p>
<p>I didn't much care about either party&mdash;I was looking out
for romance&mdash;but I inclined a little to the Separationists,
because Macdonald, with whom I lived for two years at Horton Pen,
was himself a Separationist, in a cool Scotch sort of way. He was
an Argyleshire man, who had come out to the island as a lad in
1786, and had worked his way up to the position of agent to the
Rooksby estate at Horton Pen. He had a little estate of his own,
too, at the mouth of the River Minho, where he grew rice very
profitably. He had been the first man to plant it on the
island.</p>
<p>Horton Pen nestled down at the foot of the tall white scars
that end the Vale of St. Thomas and are not much unlike Dover
Cliffs, hanging over a sea of squares of the green cane,
alternating with masses of pimento foliage. Macdonald's wife was
an immensely stout, raven-haired, sloe-eyed, talkative body, the
most motherly woman I have ever known&mdash;I suppose because she
was childless.</p>
<p>What was anomalous in my position had passed away with the
next outward mail. Veronica wrote to me; Ralph to his attorney
and the Macdonalds. But by that time Mrs. Mac. had darned my
socks ten times.</p>
<p>The surrounding gentry, the large resident landowners, of whom
there remained a sprinkling in the Vale, were at first inclined
to make much of me. There was Mrs. Topnambo, a withered, very
dried-up personage, who affected pink trimmings; she gave the
<i>ton</i> to the countryside as far as ton could be given to a
society that rioted with hospitality. She made efforts to draw me
out of the Macdonald environment, to make me differentiate
myself, because I was the grandson of an earl. But the Topnambos
were the great Loyalists of the place, and the Macdonalds the
principal Separationists, and I stuck to the Macdonalds. I was
searching for romance, you see, and could find none in Mrs.
Topnambo's white figure, with its dryish, gray skin, and pink
patches round the neck, that lay forever in dark or darkened
rooms, and talked querulously of "Your uncle, the earl," whom I
had never seen. I didn't get on with the men any better. They
were either very dried up and querulous, too, or else very
liquorish or boisterous in an incomprehensible way. Their
evenings seemed to be a constant succession of shouts of
laughter, merging into undignified staggers of white trousers
through blue nights&mdash;round the corners of ragged huts. I
never understood the hidden sources of their humour, and I had
not money enough to mix well with their lavishness. I was too
proud to be indebted to them, too. They didn't even acknowledge
me on the road at last; they called me poor-spirited, a
thin-blooded nobleman's cub&mdash;a Separationist
traitor&mdash;and left me to superintend niggers and save money.
Mrs. Mac, good Separationist though she was, as became the wife
of her husband, had the word "home" forever on her lips. She had
once visited the Rooksbys at Horton; she had treasured up a host
of tiny things, parts of my forgotten boyhood, and she talked of
them and talked of them until that past seemed a wholly desirable
time, and the present a dull thing!</p>
<p>Journeying in search of romance&mdash;and that, after all, is
our business in this world&mdash;is much like trying to eaten the
horizon. It lies a little distance before us, and a little
<i>distance behind&mdash;about as far as the eye can carry.</i>
One, discovers that one has passed through it just as one passed
what is to-day our horizon&mdash;One looks back and says. "Why
there it is." One looks forward and says the same. It lies either
in the old days when we used to, or in <i>the new days when we
shall</i>. I look back upon those days of mine, and little things
remain, come back to me, assume an atmosphere, take significance,
go to the making of a <i>temps jadis</i>. Probably, when I look
back upon what is the dull, arid waste of to-day, it will be much
the same.</p>
<p>I could almost wish to take again one of the long,
uninteresting night rides from the Vale to Spanish Town, or to
listen once more to one of old Macdonald's interminable harangues
on the folly of Mr. Canning's policy, or the virtues of Scotch
thrift. "Jack, lad," he used to bellow in his curious squeak of a
voice, "a gentleman you may be of guid Scots blood. But ye're a
puir body's son for a' that." He was set on my making money and
turning honest pennies. I think he really liked me.</p>
<p>It was with that idea that he introduced me to Ramon, "an
esteemed Spanish merchant of Kingston and Spanish Town." Ramon
had seemed mysterious when I had seen him in company with Carlos
and Castro but re-introduced in the homely atmosphere of the
Macdonalds, he had become merely a saturnine, tall,
dusky-featured, gold-spectacled Spaniard, and very good company.
I learnt nearly all my Spanish from him. The only mystery about
him was the extravagantly cheap rate at which he sold his things
under the flagstaff in front of Admiral Rowley's house, the
King's House, as it was called. The admiral himself was said to
have extensive dealings with Ramon; he had at least the
reputation of desiring to turn an honest penny, like myself. At
any rate, everyone, from the proudest planters to the editor of
the <i>Buckatoro Journal</i> next door, was glad of a chat with
Ramon, whose knowledge of an immense variety of things was as
deep as a draw-well&mdash;and as placid.</p>
<p>I used to buy island produce through him, ship it to New
Orleans, have it sold, and re-import parcels of "notions," making
a double profit. He was always ready to help me, and as ready to
talk, saying that he had an immense respect for my relations, the
Riegos.</p>
<p>That was how, at the end of my second year in the island, I
had come to talking to him. The stage should have brought a
letter from Veronica, who was to have presented Rooksby with a
son and heir, but it was unaccountably late. I had been twice to
the coach office, and was making my way desultorily back to
Ramon's. He was talking to the editor of the <i>Buckatoro
Journal</i>&mdash;the man from next door&mdash;and to another who
had, whilst I walked lazily across the blazing square, ridden
furiously up to the steps of the arcade. The rider was talking to
both of them with exaggerated gestures of his arms. He had ridden
off, spurring, and the editor, a little, gleaming-eyed hunchback,
had remained in the sunshine, talking excitedly to Ramon.</p>
<p>I knew him well, an amusing, queer, warped, Satanic member of
society, who was a sort of nephew to the Macdonalds, and hand in
glove with all the Scotch Separationists of the island. He had
started an extraordinary, scandalous paper that, to avoid
sequestration, changed its name and offices every few issues, and
was said by Loyalists, like the Topnambos, to have an extremely
bad influence.</p>
<p>He subsisted a good deal on the charity of people like the
Macdonalds, and I used sometimes to catch sight of him at
evenfall listening to Mrs. Macdonald; he would be sitting beside
her hammock on the veranda, his head very much down on his
breast, very much on one side, and his great hump portending over
his little white face, and ruffling up his ragged black hair.
Mrs. Macdonald clacked all the scandal of the Vale, and the
<i>Buckatoro Journal</i> got the benefit of it all, with
adornments.</p>
<p>For the last month or so the Journal had been more than
usually effective, and it was only because Rowley was preparing
to confound his traducers by the boat attack on Rio Medio, that a
warrant had not come against David. When I saw him talking to
Ramon, I imagined that the rider must have brought news of a
warrant, and that David was preparing for flight. He hopped
nimbly from Ramon's steps into the obscurity of his own door.
Ramon turned his spectacles softly upon me.</p>
<p>"There you have it," he said. "The folly; the folly! To send
only little boats to attack such a nest of villains. It is
inconceivable."</p>
<p>The horseman had brought news that the boats of Rowley's
squadron had been beaten off with great loss, in their attack on
Rio Medio.</p>
<p>Ramon went on with an air of immense superiority, "And all the
while we merchants are losing thousands."</p>
<p>His dark eyes searched my face, and it came disagreeably into
my head that he was playing some part; that his talk was
delusive, his anger feigned; that, perhaps, he still suspected me
of being a Separationist. He went on talking about the failure of
the boat attack. All Jamaica had been talking of it, speculating
about it, congratulating itself on it. British valour was going
to tell; four boats' crews would do the trick. And now the boats
had been beaten off, the crews captured, half the men killed!
Already there was panic on the island. I could see men coming
together in little knots, talking eagerly. I didn't like to
listen to Ramon, to a Spaniard talking in that way about the
defeat of my countrymen by his. I walked across the King's
Square, and the stage driving up just then, I went to the office,
and got my correspondence.</p>
<p>Veronica's letter came like a faint echo, like the sound of
very distant surf, heard at night; it seemed impossible that any
one could be as interested as she in the things that were
happening over there. She had had a son; one of Ralph's aunts was
its godmother. She and Ralph had been to Bath last spring; the
country wanted water very badly. Ralph had used his influence,
had explained matters to a very great personage, had spent a
little money on the injured runners. In the meanwhile I had
nearly forgotten the whole matter; it seemed to be extraordinary
that they should still be interested in it.</p>
<p>I was to come back; as soon as it was safe I was to come back;
that was the main tenor of the letter.</p>
<p>I read it in a little house of call, in a whitewashed room
that contained a cardboard cat labelled "The Best," for sole
ornament. Four swarthy fellows, Mexican patriots, were talking
noisily about their War of Independence, and the exploits of a
General Trapelascis, who had been defeating the Spanish troops
over there. It was almost impossible to connect them with a world
that included Veronica's delicate handwriting with the pencil
lines erased at the base of each line of ink. They seemed to be
infinitely more real. Even Veronica's interest in me seemed a
little strange; her desire for my return irritated me. It was as
if she had asked me to return to a state of bondage, after having
found myself. Thinking of it made me suddenly aware that I had
become a man, with a man's aims, and a disillusionized view of
life. It suddenly appeared very wonderful that I could sit calmly
there, surveying, for instance, those four sinister fellows with
daggers, as if they were nothing at all. When I had been at home
the matter would have caused me extraordinary emotions, as many
as if I had seen an elephant in a travelling show. As for going
back to my old life, it didn't seem to be possible. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>One night I was riding alone towards Horton Pen. A large moon
hung itself up above me like an enormous white plate. Finally the
sloping roof of the Ferry Inn, with one dishevelled palm tree
drooping over it, rose into the disk. The window lights were
reflected like shaken torches in the river. A mass of objects,
picked out with white globes, loomed in the high shadow of the
inn, standing motionless. They resolved themselves into a
barouche, with four horses steaming a great deal, and an army of
negresses with bandboxes on their heads. A great lady was on the
road; her querulous voice was calling to someone within the open
door that let down a soft yellow light from the top of the
precipitous steps. A nondescript object, with apparently two
horns and a wheel, rested inert at the foot of the sign-post; two
negroes were wiping their foreheads beside it. That resolved
itself into a man slumbering in a wheelbarrow, his white face
turned up to the moon. A sort of buzz of voices came from above;
then a man in European clothes was silhouetted against the light
in the doorway. He held a full glass very carefully and started
to descend. Suddenly he stopped emotionally. Then he turned
half-right and called back, "Sir Charles! Sir Charles! Here's the
very man! I protest, the very man!" There was an interrogative
roar from within. It was like being outside a lion's cage.</p>
<p>People appeared and disappeared in front of the lighted door;
windows stood open, with heads craning out all along the inn
face. I was hurrying off the back of my horse when the admiral
came out on to the steps. Someone lit a torch, and the admiral
became a dark, solid figure, with the flash of the gold lace on
his coat. He stood very high in the leg; had small white
whiskers, and a large nose that threw a vast shadow on to his
forehead in the upward light; his high collar was open, and a
mass of white appeared under his chin; his head was uncovered. A
third male face, very white, bobbed up and down beside his
shining left shoulder. He kept on saying:</p>
<p>"What? what? what? Hey, what?...That man?" He appeared to be
halfway between supreme content and violent anger. At last he
delivered himself. "Let's duck him...hey?...Let's duck him!" He
spoke with a sort of benevolent chuckle, then raised his voice
and called, "Tinsley! Tinsley! Where the deuce is Tinsley?"</p>
<p>A high nasal sound came from the carriage window. "Sir
Charles! Sir Charles! Let there be no scene in my presence, I
beg."</p>
<p>I suddenly saw, halfway up, laboriously ascending the steps, a
black figure, indistinguishable at first on account of
deformities. It was David Macdonald. Since his last, really
terrible comments on the failure of the boat-attack, he had been
lying hidden somewhere. It came upon me in a flash that he was
making his way from one hiding place to another. In making his
escape from Spanish Town, either to Kingston or the Vale, he had
run against the admiral and his party returning from the
Topnambos' ball. It was hardly a coincidence: everyone on the
road met at the Ferry Inn. But that hardly made the thing more
pleasant.</p>
<p>Sir Charles continued to clamour for Tinsley, his flag
lieutenant, who, as a matter of fact, was the man drunk in the
wheelbarrow. When this was explained by the shouts of the
negroes, he grunted, "Umph!" turned on the man at his side, and
said, "Here, Oldham; you lend a hand to duck the little toad." It
was the sort of thing that the thirsty climate of Jamaica
rendered frequent enough. Oldham dropped his glass and protested.
Macdonald continued silently and enigmatically to climb the
steps; now he was in for it he showed plenty of pluck. No doubt
he recognized that, if the admiral made a fool of himself, he
would be afraid to issue warrants in soberness. I could not stand
by and see them bully the wretched little creature. At the same
time I didn't, most decidedly, want to identify myself with
him.</p>
<p>I called out impulsively, "Sir Charles, surely you would not
use violence to a cripple."</p>
<p>Then, very suddenly, they all got to action, David Macdonald
reaching the top of the steps. Shrieks came from the interior of
the carriage, and from the waiting n&eacute;gresses. I saw three
men were falling upon a little thing like a damaged cat. I
couldn't stand that, come what might of it.</p>
<p>I ran hastily up the steps, hoping to be able to make them
recover their senses, a force of purely conventional emotion
impelling me. It was no business of mine; I didn't want to
interfere, and I felt like a man hastening to separate half a
dozen fighting dogs too large to be pleasant.</p>
<p>When I reached the top, there was a sort of undignified
scuffle, and in the end I found myself standing above a ghastly
white gentleman who, from a sitting posture, was gasping out,
"I'll commit you!...I swear I'll commit you!..." I helped him to
his feet rather apologetically, while the admiral behind me was
asking insistently who the deuce I was. The man I had picked up
retreated a little, and then turned back to look at me. The light
was shining on my face, and he began to call out, "I know him. I
know him perfectly well. He's John Kemp. I'll commit him at once.
The papers are in the barouche." After that he seemed to take it
into his head that I was going to assault him again. He bolted
out of sight, and I was left facing the admiral. He stared at me
contemptuously. I was streaming with perspiration and upbraiding
him for assaulting a cripple.</p>
<p>The admiral said, "Oh, that's what you think? I will settle
with you presently. This is rank mutiny." I looked at Oldham, who
was the admiral's secretary. He was extremely dishevelled about
his neck, much as if a monkey had been clawing him thereabouts.
Half of his roll collar flapped on his heaving chest; his stock
hung down behind like a cue. I had seen him kneeling on the
ground with his head pinned down by the hunchback. I said
loftily:</p>
<p>"What did you set him on a little beggar like that for? You
were three to one. What did you expect?"</p>
<p>The admiral swore. Oldham began to mop with a lace
handkerchief at a damaged upper lip from which a stream of blood
was running; he even seemed to be weeping a little. Finally, he
vanished in at the door, very much bent together. The undaunted
David hopped in after him coolly.</p>
<p>The admiral said, "I know your kind. You're a treasonous dog,
sir. This is mutiny. You shall be made an example of."</p>
<p>All the same he must have been ashamed of himself, for
presently he and the two others went down the steps without even
looking at me, and their carriage rolled away.</p>
<p>Inside the inn I found a couple of merchant captains, one
asleep with his head on the table and little rings shining in his
great red ears; the other very spick and span&mdash;of what they
called the new school then. His name was Williams&mdash;Captain
Williams of the <i>Lion</i>, which he part owned; a man of some
note for the dinners he gave on board his ship. His eyes sparkled
blue and very round in a round rosy face, and he clawed
effusively at my arm.</p>
<p>"Well done!" he bubbled over. "You gave it them; strike me,
you did! It did me good to see and hear. I wasn't going to poke
my nose in, not I. But I admire you, my boy."</p>
<p>He was a quite guileless man with a strong dislike for the
admiral's blundering&mdash;a dislike that all the seamen
shared&mdash;and for people of the Topnambo kidney who affected
to be above his dinners. He assured me that I had burst upon
those gentry roaring..."like the Bull of Bashan. You should have
seen!" and he drank my health in a glass of punch.</p>
<p>David Macdonald joined us, looming through wreaths of tobacco
smoke. He was always very nice in his dress, and had washed
himself into a state of enviable coolness.</p>
<p>"They won't touch me now," he said. "I wanted that assault and
battery..." He suddenly turned vivid, sarcastic black eyes upon
me. "But you," he said&mdash;"my dear Kemp! You're in a devil of
a scrape! They'll have a warrant out against you under the Black
Act. I know the gentry."</p>
<p>"Oh, he won't mind," Williams struck in, "I know him; he's a
trump. Afraid of nothing."</p>
<p>David Macdonald made a movement of his head that did duty for
an ominous shake:</p>
<p>"It's a devil of a mess," he said. "But I'll touch them up.
Why did you hit Topnambo? He's the spitefullest beast in the
island. They'll make it out high treason. They are capable of
sending you home on this charge."</p>
<p>"Oh, never say die." Williams turned to me, "Come and dine
with me on board at Kingston to-morrow night. If there's any fuss
I'll see what I can do. Or you can take a trip with me to Havana
till it blows over. My old woman's on board." His face fell. "But
there, you'll get round her. I'll see you through."</p>
<p>They drank some sangaree and became noisy. I wasn't very
happy; there was much truth in what David Macdonald had said.
Topnambo would certainly do his best to have me in jail&mdash;to
make an example of me as a Separationist to please the admiral
and the Duke of Manchester. Under the spell of his liquor
Williams became more and more pressing with his offers of
help.</p>
<p>"It's the devil that my missus should be on board, just this
trip. But hang it! come and dine with me. I'll get some of the
Kingston men&mdash;the regular hot men&mdash;to stand up for you.
They will when they hear the tale."</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of sense in what he said. If
warrants were out against me, he or some of the Kingston
merchants whom he knew, and who had no cause to love the admiral,
might help me a good deal.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I did go down to Kingston. It happened to be the
day when the seven pirates were hanged at Port Royal Point. I had
never seen a hanging, and a man who hadn't was rare in those
days. I wanted to keep out of the way, but it was impossible to
get a boatman to row me off to the <i>Lion</i>. They were all
dying to see the show, and, half curious, half reluctant, I let
myself drift with the crowd.</p>
<p>The gallows themselves stood high enough to be seen&mdash;a
long very stout beam supported by posts at each end. There was a
blazing sun, and the crowd pushed and shouted and craned its
thousands of heads every time one heard the cry of "Here they
come," for an hour or so. There was a very limpid sky, a very
limpid sea, a scattering of shipping gliding up and down, and the
very silent hills a long way away. There was a large flavour of
Spaniards among the crowd. I got into the middle of a knot of
them, jammed against the wheels of one of the carriages,
standing, hands down, on tiptoe, staring at the long scaffold.
There were a great many false alarms, sudden outcries, hushing
again rather slowly. In between I could hear someone behind me
talk Spanish to the occupants of the carriage. I thought the
voice was Ramon's, but I could not turn, and the people in the
carriage answered in French, I thought. A man was shouting "Cool
Drinks" on the other side of them.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a roar, an irresistible swaying, a rattle
of musket ramrods, a rhythm of marching feet, and the grating of
heavy iron-bound wheels. Seven men appeared in sight above the
heads, clinging to each other for support, and being drawn slowly
along. The little worsted balls on the infantry shakos bobbed all
round their feet. They were a sorry-looking group, those pirates;
very wild-eyed, very ragged, dust-stained, weather-beaten,
begrimed till they had the colour of unpolished mahogany.
Clinging still to each other as they stood beneath the dangling
ropes of the long beam, they had the appearance of a group of
statuary to forlorn misery. Festoons of chains completed the
"composition."</p>
<p>One was a very old man with long yellow-white hair, one a
negro whose skin had no lustre at all. The rest were very
dark-skinned, peak-bearded, and had long hair falling round their
necks. A soldier with a hammer and a small anvil climbed into the
cart, and bent down out of sight. There was a ring of iron on
iron, and the man next the very old man raised his arms and began
to speak very slowly, very distinctly, and very mournfully. It
was quite easy to understand him; he declared his perfect
innocence. No one listened to him; his name was Pedro Nones. He
ceased speaking, and someone on a horse, the High Sheriff, I
think, galloped impatiently past the cart and shouted. Two men
got into the cart, one pulled the rope, the other caught the
pirate by the elbows. He jerked himself loose, and began to cry
out; he seemed to be lost in amazement, and shrieked:</p>
<p>"<i>Adonde est&aacute; el padre?...Adonde est&aacute; el
padre?</i>" No one answered; there wasn't a priest of any
denomination; I don't know whether the omission was purposed. The
man's face grew convulsed with agony, his eyeballs stared out
very white and vivid, as he struggled with the two men. He began
to curse us epileptically for compassing his damnation. A hoarse
patter of Spanish imprecations came from the crowd immediately
round me. The man with the voice like Ramon's groaned in a
lamentable way; someone else said, "What infamy...what
infamy!"</p>
<p>An aged voice said tremulously in the carriage, "This shall be
a matter of official remonstrance." Another said, "Ah, these
English heretics!"</p>
<p>There was a forward rush of the crowd, which carried me away.
Someone in front began to shout orders, and the crowd swayed back
again. The infantry muskets rattled. The commotion lasted some
time. When it ceased, I saw that the man about to die had been
kissing the very old man; tears were streaming down the gray,
parchment-coloured cheeks. Pedro Nones had the rope round his
neck; it curved upwards loosely towards the beam, growing taut as
the cart jolted away. He shouted:</p>
<p>"<i>Adi&ocirc;s, viejo, para siempre
adi&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>
<p>My whole body seemed to go dead all over. I happened to look
downwards at my hands; they were extraordinarily white, with the
veins standing out all over them. They felt as if they had been
sodden in water, and it was quite a long time before they
recovered their natural colour. The rest of the men were hung
after that, the cart jolting a little way backwards and forwards
and growing less crowded after every journey. One man, who was
very large framed and stout, had to go through it twice because
the rope broke. He made a good deal of fuss. My head ached, and
after the involuntary straining and craning to miss no details
was over, I felt sick and dazed. The people talked a great deal
as they streamed back, loosening over the broader stretch of
pebbles; they seemed to wish to remind each other of details. I
have an idea that one or two, in the sheer largeness of heart
that seizes one after occasions of popular emotions, asked me in
exulting voices if I had seen the nigger's tongue sticking
out.</p>
<p>Others thought that there wasn't very much to be exultant
over. We had not really captured the pirates; they had been
handed over to the admiral by the Havana authorities&mdash;as an
international courtesy I suppose, or else because they were
pirates of no account and short in funds, or because the admiral
had been making a fuss in front of the Morro. It was even
asserted by the anti-admiral faction that the seven weren't
pirates at all, but merely Cuban <i>mauvais sujets</i>, hawkers
of derogatory <i>coplas</i>, and known freethinkers. In any case,
excited people cheered the High Sheriff and the returning
infantry, because it was pleasant to hang any kind of Spaniard. I
got nearly knocked down by the kettle-drummers, who came through
the scattering crowd at a swinging quick-step. As I cannoned off
the drums, a hand caught at my arm, and someone else began to
speak to me. It was old Ramon, who was telling me that he had a
special kind of Manchester goods at his store. He explained that
they had arrived very lately, and that he had come from Spanish
Town solely on their account. One made the eighth of a penny a
yard more on them than on any other kind. If I would deign to
have some of it offered to my inspection, he had his little
curricle just off the road. He was drawing me gently towards it
all the time, and I had not any idea of resisting. He had been
behind in the crowd, he said, beside the carriage of the
commissioner and the judge of the Marine Court sent by the Havana
authorities to deliver the pirates.</p>
<p>It was after that, that in Ramon's dusky store, I had my first
sight of Seraphina and of her father, and then came my meeting
with Carlos. I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw him come
out with extended hand. It was an extraordinary sensation, that
of talking to Carlos again. He seemed to have worn badly. His
face had lost its moist bloom, its hardly distinguishable
subcutaneous flush. It had grown very, very pale. Dark blue
circles took away from the blackness and sparkle of his eyes. And
he coughed, and coughed.</p>
<p>He put his arm affectionately round my shoulders and said,
"How splendid to see you again, my Juan." His eyes had affection
in them, there was no doubt about that, but I felt vaguely
suspicious of him. I remembered how we had parted on board the
<i>Thames</i>. "We can talk here," he added; "it is very
pleasant. You shall see my uncle, that great man, the star of
Cuban law, and my cousin Seraphina, your kinsfolk. They love you;
I have spoken well of you." He smiled gayly, and went on, "This
is not a place befitting his greatness, nor my cousin's, nor,
indeed, my own." He smiled again. "But I shall be very soon dead,
and to me it matters little." He frowned a little, and then
laughed. "But you should have seen the faces of your officers
when my uncle refused to go to their governor's palace; there was
to have been a <i>fiesta</i>, a 'reception'; is it not the word?
It will cause a great scandal."</p>
<p>He smiled with a good deal of fine malice, and looked as if he
expected me to be pleased. I said that I did not quite understand
what had offended his uncle.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was because there was no priest," Carlos answered,
"when those poor devils were hung. They were <i>canaille</i>.
Yes; but one gives that much even to such. And my uncle was there
in his official capacity as a a plenipotentiary. He was very much
distressed: we were all. You heard, my uncle himself had advised
their being surrendered to your English. And when there was no
priest he repented very bitterly. Why, after all, it was an
infamy."</p>
<p>He paused again, and leant back against the counter. When his
eyes were upon the ground and his face not animated by talking,
there became lamentably insistent his pallor, the deep shadows
under his eyes, and infinite sadness in the droop of his
features, as if he were preoccupied by an all-pervading and
hopeless grief. When he looked at me, he smiled, however.</p>
<p>"Well, at worst it is over, and my uncle is here in this dirty
place instead of at your palace. We sail back to Cuba this very
evening." He looked round him at Ramon's calicos and sugar tubs
in the dim light, as if he accepted almost incredulously the fact
that they could be in such a place, and the manner of his voice
indicated that he thought our governor's palace would have been
hardly less barbarous. "But I am sorry," he said suddenly,
"because I wanted you&mdash;you and all your countrymen&mdash;to
make a good impression on him. You must do it yourself alone. And
you will. You are not like these others. You are our kinsman, and
I have praised you very much. You saved my life."</p>
<p>I began to say that I had done nothing at all, but he waved
his hand with a little smile.</p>
<p>"You are very brave," he said, as if to silence me. "I am not
ungrateful."</p>
<p>He began again to ask for news from home&mdash;from my home. I
told him that Veronica had a baby, and he sighed.</p>
<p>"She married the excellent Rooksby?" he asked. "Ah, what a
waste." He relapsed into silence again. "There was no woman in
your land like her. She might have&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- And to
marry that&mdash;that excellent personage, my good cousin. It is
a tragedy."</p>
<p>"It was a very good match," I answered.</p>
<p>He sighed again. "My uncle is asleep in there, now," he said,
after a pause, pointing at the inner door. "We must not wake him;
he is a very old man. You do not mind talking to me? You will
wait to see them? Dona Seraphina is here, too."</p>
<p>"You have not married your cousin?" I asked.</p>
<p>I wanted very much to see the young girl who had looked at me
for a moment, and I certainly should have been distressed if
Carlos had said she was married.</p>
<p>He answered, "What would you have?" and shrugged his shoulders
gently. A smile came into his face. "She is very willful. I did
not please her, I do not know why. Perhaps she has seen too many
men like me."</p>
<p>He told me that, when he reached Cuba, after parting with me
on the <i>Thames</i>, his uncle, "in spite of certain
influences," had received him quite naturally as his heir, and
the future head of the family. But Seraphina, whom by the laws of
convenience he ought to have married, had quite calmly refused
him.</p>
<p>"I did not impress her; she is romantic. She wanted a very
bold man, a Cid, something that it is not easy to have."</p>
<p>He paused again, and looked at me with some sort of challenge
in his eyes.</p>
<p>"She could have met no one better than you," I said.</p>
<p>He waved his hand a little. "Oh, for
that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-" he said deprecatingly. "Besides, I am
dying. I have never been well since I went into your cold sea,
over there, after we left your sister. You remember how I coughed
on board that miserable ship."</p>
<p>I did remember it very well.</p>
<p>He went to the inner door, looked in, and then came back to
me.</p>
<p>"Seraphina needs a guide&mdash;a controller&mdash;someone very
strong and gentle, and kind and brave. My uncle will never ask
her to marry against her wish; he is too old and has too little
will. And for any man who would marry her&mdash;except
one&mdash;there would be great dangers, for her and for him. It
would need a cool man, and a brave man, and a good one, too, to
hazard, perhaps even life, for her sake. She will be very rich.
All our lands, all our towns, all our gold." There was a
suggestion of fabulousness in his dreamy voice. "They shall never
be mine," he added. "<i>Vaya</i>."</p>
<p>He looked at me with his piercing eyes set to an expression
that might have been gentle mockery. At any rate, it also
contained intense scrutiny, and, perhaps, a little of appeal. I
sighed myself.</p>
<p>"There is a man called O'Brien in there," he said. "He does us
the honour to pretend to my cousin's hand."</p>
<p>I felt singularly angry. "Well, he's not a Spaniard," I
said.</p>
<p>Carlos answered mockingly, "Oh, for Spaniard, no. He is a
descendant of the Irish kings."</p>
<p>"He's an adventurer," I said. "You ought to be on your guard.
You don't know these bog-trotting fortune-hunters. They're the
laughter of Europe, kings and all."</p>
<p>Carlos smiled again. "He's a very dangerous man for all that,"
he said. "I should not advise any one to come to Rio Medio, my
uncle's town, without making a friend of the Se&ntilde;or
O'Brien."</p>
<p>He went once more to the inner door, and, after a moment's
whispering with someone within, returned to me.</p>
<p>"My uncle still sleeps," he said. "I must keep you a little
longer. Ah, yes, the Se&ntilde;or O'Brien. He shall marry my
cousin, I think, when I am dead."</p>
<p>"You don't know these fellows," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know them very well," Carlos smiled, "there are many of
them at Havana. They came there after what they call the '98,
when there was great rebellion in Ireland, and many good
Catholics were killed and ruined."</p>
<p>"Then he's a rebel, and ought to be hung," I said.</p>
<p>Carlos laughed as of old. "It may be, but, my good Juan, we
Christians do not see eye to eye with you. This man rebelled
against your government, but, also, he suffered for the true
faith. He is a good Catholic; he has suffered for it; and in the
Ever Faithful Island, that is a passport. He has climbed very
high; he is a judge of the Marine Court at Havana. That is why he
is here to-day, attending my uncle in this affair of delivering
up the pirates. My uncle loves him very much. O'Brien was at
first my uncle's clerk, and my uncle made him a <i>juez</i>, and
he is also the intendant of my uncle's estates, and he has a
great influence in my uncle's town of Rio Medio. I tell you, if
you come to visit us, it will be as well to be on good terms with
the Se&ntilde;or Juez O'Brien. My uncle is a very old man, and if
I die before him, this O'Brien, I think, will end by marrying my
cousin, because my poor uncle is very much in his hands. There
are other pretenders, but they have little chance, because it is
so very dangerous to come to my uncle's town of Rio Medio, on
account of this man's intrigues and of his power with the
populace."</p>
<p>I looked at Carlos intently. The name of the town had seemed
to be familiar to me. Now I suddenly remembered that it was where
Nicolas el Demonio, the pirate who was so famous as to be almost
mythical, had beaten off Admiral Rowley's boats.</p>
<p>"Come, you had better see this Irish hidalgo who wants to do
us so much honour,"&mdash;he gave an inscrutable glance at
me,&mdash;"but do not talk loudly till my uncle wakes."</p>
<p>He threw the door open. I followed him into the room, where
the vision of the ancient Don and the charming apparition of the
young girl had retreated only a few moments before. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>The room was very lofty and coldly dim; there were great bars
in front of the begrimed windows. It was very bare, containing
only a long black table, some packing cases, and half a dozen
rocking chairs. Of these, five were very new and one very old,
black and heavy, with a green leather seat and a coat of arms
worked on its back cushions. There were little heaps of mahogany
sawdust here and there on the dirty tiled floor, and a pile of
sacking in one corner. Beneath a window the flap of an open
trap-door half hid a large green damp-stain; a deep recess in the
wall yawned like a cavern, and had two or three tubs in the right
corner; a man with a blond head, slightly bald as if he had been
tonsured, was rocking gently in one of the new chairs.</p>
<p>Opposite him, with his aged face towards us, sat the old Don
asleep in the high chair. His delicate white hands lay along the
arms, one of them holding a gold vinaigrette; his black,
silver-headed cane was between his silk-stockinged legs. The
diamond buckles of his shoes shot out little vivid rays, even in
that gloomy place. The young girl was sitting with her hands to
her temples and her elbows on the long table, minutely examining
the motionlessness of a baby lizard, a tiny thing with golden
eyes, whom fear seemed to have turned into stone.</p>
<p>We entered quietly, and after a moment she looked up candidly
into my eyes, and placed her finger on her lips, motioning her
head towards her father. She placed her hand in mine, and
whispered very clearly:</p>
<p>"Be welcome, my English cousin," and then dropped her eyes
again to the lizard.</p>
<p>She knew all about me from Carlos. The man of whom I had seen
only the top of his head, turned his chair suddenly and glinted
at me with little blue eyes. He was rather small and round, with
very firm flesh, and very white, plump hands. He was dressed in
the black clothes of a Spanish judge. On his round face there was
always a smile like that which hangs around the jaws of a
pike&mdash;only more humorous. He bowed a little exaggeratedly to
me and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, ye are that famous Mr. Kemp."</p>
<p>I said that I imagined him the more famous Se&ntilde;or Juez
O'Brien.</p>
<p>"It's little use saying ye arren't famous," he said. His voice
had the faint, infinitely sweet twang of certain Irishry; a thing
as delicate and intangible as the scent of lime flowers. "Our
noble friend"&mdash;he indicated Carlos with a little flutter of
one white hand&mdash;"has told me what make of a dare-devil
gallant ye are; breaking the skulls of half the Bow Street
runners for the sake of a friend in distress. Well, I honour ye
for it; I've done as much myself." He added, "In the old days,"
and sighed.</p>
<p>"You mean in the '98," I said, a little insolently.</p>
<p>O'Brien's eyes twinkled. He had, as a matter of fact, nearly
lost his neck in the Irish fiasco, either in Clonmel or Sligo,
bolting violently from the English dragoons, in the mist, to a
French man-of-war's boats in the bay. To him, even though he was
now a judge in Cuba, it was an episode of heroism of
youth&mdash;of romance, in fact. So that, probably, he did not
resent my mention of it. I certainly wanted to resent something
that was slighting in his voice, and patronizing in his
manner.</p>
<p>The old Don slumbered placidly, his face turned up to the
distant begrimed ceiling.</p>
<p>"Now, I'll make you a fair offer," O'Brien said suddenly,
after an intent study of the insolent glance that I gave him. I
disliked him because I knew nothing about the sort of man he was.
He was, as a matter of fact, more alien to me than Carlos. And he
gave me the impression that, if perhaps he were not absolutely
the better man, he could still make a fool of me, or at least
make me look like a fool.</p>
<p>"I'm told you are a Separationist," he said. "Well, it's like
me. I am an Irishman; there has been a price on my head in
another island. And there are warrants out against you here for
assaulting the admiral. We can work together, and there's nothing
low in what I have in mind for you."</p>
<p>He had heard frequently from Carlos that I was a desperate and
aristocratically lawless young man, who had lived in a district
entirely given up to desperate and murderous smugglers. But this
was the first I had heard definitely of warrants against me in
Jamaica. That, no doubt, he had heard from Ramon, who knew
everything. In all this little sardonic Irishman said to me, it
seemed the only thing worth attention. It stuck in my mind while,
in persuasive tones, and with airy fluency, he discoursed of the
profits that could be made, nowadays, in arming privateers under
the Mexican flag. He told me I needn't be surprised at their
being fitted out in a Spanish colony. "There's more than one
aspect to disloyalty like this," said he dispassionately, but
with a quick wink contrasting with his tone.</p>
<p>Spain resented our recognition of their rebellious colonies.
And with the same cool persuasiveness, relieved by humorous
smiles, he explained that the loyal Spaniards of the Ever
Faithful Island thought there was no sin in doing harm to the
English, even under the Mexican flag, whose legal existence they
did not recognize.</p>
<p>"Mind ye, it's an organized thing, I have something to say in
it. It hurts Mr. Canning's Government at home, the curse of
Cromwell on him and them. They will be dropping some of their own
colonies directly. And as you are a Separationist, small blame to
you, and I am an Irishman, we shan't cry our eyes out over it.
Come, Mr. Kemp, 'tis all for the good of the Cause...And there's
nothing <i>low</i>. You are a gentleman, and I wouldn't propose
anything that was. The very best people in Havana are interested
in the matter. Our schooners lie in Rio Medio, but I can't be
there all the time myself."</p>
<p>Surprise deprived me of speech. I glanced at Carlos. He was
watching us inscrutably. The young girl touched the lizard
gently, but it was too frightened to move. O'Brien, with shrewd
glances, rocked his chair... What did I want? he inquired. To see
life? What he proposed was the life for a fine young fellow like
me. Moreover, I was half Scotch. Had I forgotten the wrongs of my
own country? Had I forgotten the '45?</p>
<p>"You'll have heard tell of a Scotch Chief Justice whose son
spent in Amsterdam the money his father earned on the justice
seat in Edinb'ro'&mdash;money paid for rum and run silks..."</p>
<p>Of course I had heard of it; everybody had; but it had been
some years before.</p>
<p>"We're backwards hereabouts," O'Brien jeered. "But over there
they winked and chuckled at the judge, and they do the same in
Havana at us."</p>
<p>Suddenly from behind us the voice of the young girl said, "Of
what do you discourse, my English cousin?"</p>
<p>O'Brien interposed deferentially. "Se&ntilde;orita, I ask him
to come to Rio," he said.</p>
<p>She turned her large dark eyes scrutinizingly upon me, then
dropped them again. She was arranging some melon seeds in a rayed
circle round the lizard that looked motionlessly at her.</p>
<p>"Do not speak very loudly, lest you awaken my father," she
warned us.</p>
<p>The old Don's face was still turned to the ceiling. Carlos,
standing behind his chair, opened his mouth a little in a half
smile. I was really angry with O'Brien by that time, with his air
of omniscience, superiority, and self-content, as if he were
talking to a child or someone very credulous and weak-minded.</p>
<p>"What right have you to speak for me, Se&ntilde;or Juez?" I
said in the best Spanish I could.</p>
<p>The young girl looked at me once more, and then again looked
down.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can speak for you," he answered in English, "because I
know. Your position's this." He sat down in his rocking chair,
crossed his legs, and looked at me as if he expected me to show
signs of astonishment at his knowing so much. "You're in a hole.
You must leave this island of Jamaica&mdash;surely it's as
distressful as my own dear land&mdash;and you can't go home,
because the runners would be after you. You're 'wanted' here as
well as there, and you've nowhere to go."</p>
<p>I looked at him, quite startled by this view of my case. He
extended one plump hand towards me, and still further lowered his
voice.</p>
<p>"Now, I offer you a good berth, a snug berth. And 'tis a
pretty spot." He got a sort of languorous honey into his voice,
and drawled out, "The&mdash;the Se&ntilde;orita's." He took an
air of businesslike candour. "You can help us, and we you; we
could do without you better than you without us. Our
undertaking&mdash;there's big names in it, just as in the Free
Trading you know so well, don't be saying you don't&mdash;is
worked from Havana. What we need is a man we can trust. We had
one&mdash;Nichols. You remember the mate of the ship you came
over in. He was Nicola el Demonio; he won't be any longer&mdash;I
can't tell you why, it's too long a story."</p>
<p>I did remember very vividly that cadaverous Nova Scotian mate
of the <i>Thames</i>, who had warned me with truculent menaces
against showing my face in Rio Medio. I remembered his sallow,
shiny cheeks, and the exaggerated gestures of his claw-like
hands.</p>
<p>O'Brien smiled. "Nichols is alive right enough, but no more
good than if he were dead. And that's the truth. He pretends his
nerve's gone; he was a devil among tailors for a time, but he's
taken to crying now. It was when your blundering old admiral's
boats had to be beaten off that his zeal cooled. He thinks the
British Government will rise in its strength." There was a bitter
contempt in his voice, but he regained his calm business tone.
"It will do nothing of the sort. I've given them those seven poor
devils that had to die to-day without absolution. So Nichols is
done for, as far as we are concerned. I've got him put away to
keep him from blabbing. You can have his place&mdash;and better
than his place. He was only a sailor, which you are not. However,
you know enough of ships, and what we want is a man with courage,
of course, but also a man we can trust. Any of the Creoles would
bolt into the bush the moment they'd five dollars in hand. We'll
pay you well; a large share of all you take."</p>
<p>I laughed outright. "You're quite mistaken in your man," I
said. "You are, really."</p>
<p>He shook his head gently, and brushed an invisible speck from
his plump black knees.</p>
<p>"You <i>must</i> go somewhere," he said. "Why not go with
us?"</p>
<p>I looked at him, puzzled by his tenacity and assurance.</p>
<p>"Ramon here has told us you battered the admiral last night;
and there's a warrant out already against you for attempted
murder. You're hand and glove with the best of the Separationists
in this island, I know, but they won't save you from being
committed&mdash;for rebellion, perhaps. You know it as well as I
do. You were down here to take a passage to-day, weren't you,
now?"</p>
<p>I remembered that the Island Loyalists said that the pirates
and Separationists worked together to bother the admiral and
raise discontent. Living in the centre of Separationist
discontent with the Macdonalds, I knew it was not true. But
nothing was too bad to say against the planters who clamoured for
union with the United States.</p>
<p>O'Brien leaned forward. His voice had a note of disdain, and
then took one of deeper earnestness; it sank into his chest. He
extended his hand; his eyebrows twitched. He looked&mdash;he
was&mdash;a conspirator.</p>
<p>"I tell you I do it for the sake of Ireland," he said
passionately. "Every ship we take, every clamour they raise here,
is a stroke and is disgrace for them over there that have
murdered us and ruined my own dear land." His face worked
convulsively; I was in the presence of one of the primeval
passions. But he grew calm immediately after. "<i>You</i> want
Separation for reasons of your own. I don't ask what they are. No
doubt you and your crony Macdonald and the rest of them will
feather your own nests; I don't ask. But help me to be a thorn in
their sides&mdash;just a little&mdash;just a little longer. What
do I put in your way? Just what you want. Have your Jamaica
joined to the United States. You'll be able to come back with
your pockets full, and I'll be joyful&mdash;for the sake of my
own dear land."</p>
<p>I said suddenly and recklessly&mdash;if I had to face one
race-passion, he had to look at another; we were cat and
dog&mdash;Celt and Saxon, as it was in the beginning: "I am not a
traitor to my country." Then I realized with sudden concern that
I had probably awakened the old Don. He stirred uneasily in his
chair, and lifted one hand.</p>
<p>"The moment I go out from here I'll denounce you," I said very
low; "I swear I will. You're here; you can't get away; you'll
swing."</p>
<p>O'Brien started. His eyes blazed at me. Then he frowned. "I've
been misled," he muttered, with a dark glance at Carlos. And
recovering his jocular serenity, "Ye mean it?" he asked; "it's
not British heroics?"</p>
<p>The old Don stirred again and sighed. The young girl glided
swiftly to his side. "Se&ntilde;or O'Brien," she said, "you have
so irritated my English cousin that he has awakened my
father."</p>
<p>O'Brien grinned gently. "'Tis ever the way," he said
sardonically. "The English fools do the harm and the Irish fool
gets the kicking." He rose to his feet, quite collected, a
spick-and-span little man. "I suppose I've said too much. Well,
well! You are going to denounce the senior judge of the Marine
Court of Havana as a pirate. I wonder who will believe you!" He
went behind the old Don's chair with the gliding motion of a
Spanish lawyer, and slipped down the open trap-hatch near the
window.</p>
<p>It was the disappearance of a shadow. I heard some guttural
mutterings come up through the hatch, a rustling, then silence.
If he was afraid of me at all he carried it off very well. I
apologized to the young girl for having awakened her father. Her
colour was very high, and her eyes sparkled. If she had not been
so very beautiful I should have gone away at once. She said
angrily:</p>
<p>"He is odious to me, the Se&ntilde;or Juez. Too long my father
has suffered his insolence." She was very small, but she had an
extraordinary dignity of command. "I could see, Se&ntilde;or,
that he was annoying you. Why should you consider such a
creature?" Her head drooped. "But my father is very old."</p>
<p>I turned upon Carlos, who stood all black in the light of the
window.</p>
<p>"Why did you make me meet him? He may be a judge of your
Marine Court, but he's nothing but a scoundrelly
bog-trotter."</p>
<p>Carlos said a little haughtily, "You must not denounce him.
You should not leave this place if I feared you would try thus to
bring dishonour on this gray head, and involve this young girl in
a public scandal." His manner became soft. "For the honour of the
house you shall say nothing. And you shall come with us. I need
you."</p>
<p>I was full of mistrust now. If he did countenance this
unlawful enterprise, whose headquarters were in Rio Medio, he was
not the man for me. Though it was big enough to be made, by the
papers at home, of political importance, it was, after all,
neither more nor less than piracy. The idea of my turning a sort
of Irish traitor was so extravagantly outrageous that now I could
smile at the imbecility of that fellow O'Brien. As to turning
into a sea-thief for lucre&mdash;my blood boiled.</p>
<p>No. There was something else there. Something deep; something
dangerous; some intrigue, that I could not conceive even the
first notion of. But that Carlos wanted anxiously to make use of
me for some purpose was clear. I was mystified to the point of
forgetting how heavily I was compromised even in Jamaica, though
it was worth remembering, because at that time an indictment for
rebellion&mdash;under the Black Act&mdash;was no joking matter. I
might be sent home under arrest; and even then, there was my
affair with the runners.</p>
<p>"It is coming to pay a visit," he was saying persuasively,
"while your affair here blows over, my
Juan&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;making my last hours easy,
perhaps."</p>
<p>I looked at him; he was worn to a shadow&mdash;a shadow with
dark wistful eyes. "I don't understand you," I faltered.</p>
<p>The old man stirred, opened his lids, and put a gold
vinaigrette to his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Of course I shall not denounce O'Brien," I said. "I, too,
respect the honour of your house."</p>
<p>"You are even better than I thought you. And if I entreat you,
for the love of your mother&mdash;of your sister? Juan, it is not
for myself, it is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>The young girl was pouring some drops from a green phial into
a silver goblet; she passed close to us, and handed it to her
father, who had leant a little forward in his chair. Every
movement of hers affected me with an intimate joy; it was as if I
had been waiting to see just that carriage of the neck, just that
proud glance from the eyes, just that droop of eyelashes upon the
cheeks, for years and years.</p>
<p>"No, I shall hold my tongue, and that's enough," I said.</p>
<p>At that moment the old Don sat up and cleared his throat.
Carlos sprang towards him with an infinite grace of tender
obsequiousness. He mentioned my name and the relationship, then
rehearsed the innumerable titles of his uncle, ending "and patron
of the Bishopric of Pinar del Rio."</p>
<p>I stood stiffly in front of the old man. He bowed his head at
intervals, holding the silver cup carefully whilst his chair
rocked a little. When Carlos' mellow voice had finished the
rehearsing of the sonorous styles, I mumbled something about
"transcendent honour."</p>
<p>He stopped me with a little, deferentially peremptory gesture
of one hand, and began to speak, smiling with a contraction of
the lips and a trembling of the head. His voice was very low, and
quavered slightly, but every syllable was enunciated with the
same beauty of clearness that there was in his features, in his
hands, in his ancient gestures.</p>
<p>"The honour is to me," he said, "and the pleasure. I behold my
kinsman, who, with great heroism, I am told, rescued my dearly
loved nephew from great dangers; it is an honour to me to be able
to give him thanks. My beloved and lamented sister contracted a
union with an English hidalgo, through whose house your own very
honourable family is allied to my own; it is a pleasure to me to
meet after many years with one who has seen the places where her
later life was passed."</p>
<p>He paused, and breathed with some difficulty, as if the speech
had exhausted him. Afterwards he began to ask me questions about
Rooksby's aunt&mdash;the lamented sister of his speech. He had
loved her greatly, he said. I knew next to nothing about her, and
his fine smile and courtly, aged, deferential manners made me
very nervous. I felt as if I had been taken to pay a ceremonial
visit to a supreme pontiff in his dotage. He spoke about Horton
Priory with some animation for a little while, and then faltered,
and forgot what he was speaking of. Suddenly he said:</p>
<p>"But where is O'Brien? Did he write to the Governor here? I
should like you to know the Se&ntilde;or O'Brien. He is a
spiritual man."</p>
<p>I forbore to say that I had already seen O'Brien, and the old
man sank into complete silence. It was beginning to grow dark,
and the noise of suppressed voices came from the open trap-door.
Nobody said anything.</p>
<p>I felt a sort of uneasiness; I could by no means understand
the connection between the old Don and what had gone before, and
I did not, in a purely conventional sense, know how long I ought
to stop. The sky through the barred windows had grown pallid.</p>
<p>The old Don said suddenly, "You must visit my poor town of Rio
Medio," but he gave no specific invitation and said nothing
more.</p>
<p>Afterwards he asked, rather querulously, "But where is
O'Brien? He must write those letters for me."</p>
<p>The young girl said, "He has preceded us to the ship; he will
write there."</p>
<p>She had gone back to her seat. Don Balthasar shrugged his
shoulders to his ears, and moved his hands from his knees.</p>
<p>"Without doubt, he knows best," he said, "but he should ask
me."</p>
<p>It grew darker still; the old Don seemed to have fallen asleep
again. Save for the gleam of the silver buckle of his hat, he had
disappeared into the gloom of the place. I remembered my
engagement to dine with Williams on board the <i>Lion</i>, and I
rose to my feet. There did not seem to be any chance of my
talking to the young girl. She was once more leaning nonchalantly
over the lizard, and her hair drooped right across her face like
clusters of grapes. There was a gleam on a little piece of white
forehead, and all around and about her there were shadows
deepening. Carlos came concernedly towards me as I looked at the
door.</p>
<p>"But you must not go yet," he said a little suavely; "I have
many things to say. Tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>His manner heightened my uneasiness to a fear. The expression
of his eyes changed, and they became fixed over my shoulder,
while on his lips the words "You must come, you must come,"
trembled, hardly audible. I could only shake my head. At once he
stepped back as if resigning. He was giving me up&mdash;and it
occurred to me that if the danger of his seduction was over,
there remained the danger of arrest just outside the door.</p>
<p>Some one behind me said peremptorily, "It is time," and there
was a flickering diminution of the light. I had a faint
instantaneous view of the old Don dozing, with his head
back&mdash;of the tall windows, cut up into squares by the black
bars. Something hairily coarse ran harshly down my face; I grew
blind; my mouth, my eyes, my nostrils were filled with dust; my
breath shut in upon me became a flood of warm air. I had no time
to resist. I kicked my legs convulsively; my elbows were drawn
tight against my sides. Someone grunted under my weight; then I
was carried&mdash;down, along, up, down again; my feet were
knocking along a wall, and the top of my head rubbed occasionally
against what must have been the roof of a low stone passage,
issuing from under the back room of Ramon's store. Finally, I was
dropped upon something that felt like a heap of wood-shavings. My
surprise, rage, and horror had been so great that, after the
first stifled cry, I had made no sound. I heard the footsteps of
several men going away. <a name="2HCH0009">

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>I remained lying there, bound hand and foot, for a long time;
for quite long enough to allow me to collect my senses and see
that I had been a fool to threaten O'Brien. I had been nobly
indignant, and behold! I had a sack thrown over my head for my
pains, and was put away safely somewhere or other. It seemed to
be a cellar.</p>
<p>I was in search of romance, and here were all the elements;
Spaniards, a conspirator, and a kidnapping; but I couldn't feel a
fool and romantic as well. True romance, I suppose, needs a whirl
of emotions to extinguish all the senses except that of sight,
which it dims. Except for sight, which I hadn't at all, I had the
use of them all, and all reported unpleasant things.</p>
<p>I ached and smarted with my head in a sack, with my mouth full
of flour that had gone mouldy and offended my nostrils; I had a
sense of ignominy, and I was extremely angry; I could see that
the old Don was in his dotage&mdash;but Carlos I was bitter
against.</p>
<p>I was not really afraid; I could not suppose that the Riegos
would allow me to be murdered or seriously maltreated. But I was
incensed against Fate or Chance or whatever it is&mdash;on
account of the ignominious details, the coarse sack, the mouldy
flour, the stones of the tunnel that had barked my shins, the
tightness of the ropes that bound my ankles together, and seemed
to cut into my wrists behind my back.</p>
<p>I waited, and my fury grew in a dead silence. How would it
end&mdash;with what outrage? I would show my contempt and
preserve my dignity by submitting without a struggle&mdash;I
despised this odious plot. At last there were voices, footsteps;
I found it very hard to carry out my resolution and refrain from
stifled cries and kicks. I was lifted up and carried, like a
corpse, with many stumbles, by men who sometimes growled as they
hastened along. From time to time somebody murmured, "Take care."
Then I was deposited into a boat. The world seemed to be swaying,
splashing, jarring&mdash;and it became obvious to me that I was
being taken to some ship. The Spanish ship, of course. Suddenly I
broke into cold perspiration at the thought that, after all,
their purpose might be to drop me quickly overboard. "Carlos!" I
cried. I felt the point of a knife on my breast. "Silence,
Se&ntilde;or!" said a gruff voice.</p>
<p>This fear vanished when we came alongside a ship evidently
already under way; but I was handled so roughly and clumsily that
I was thoroughly exhausted and out of breath, by the time I was
got on board. All was still around me; I was left alone on a
settee in the main cabin, as I imagined. For a long time I made
no movement; then a door opened and shut. There was a murmured
conversation between two voices. This went on in animated
whispers for a time. At last I felt as if someone were trying,
rather ineffectually, to remove the sack itself. Finally, that
actually did rub its way over my head, and something soft and
silken began to wipe my eyes with a surprising care, and even
tenderness. "This was stupidly done," came a discontented remark;
"you do not handle a <i>caballero</i> like this."</p>
<p>"And how else was it to be done, to that kind of
<i>caballero?</i>" was the curt retort.</p>
<p>By that time I had blinked my eyes into a condition for
remaining open for minute stretches. Two men were bending over
me&mdash;Carlos and O'Brien himself. The latter said:</p>
<p>"Believe me, your mistake made this necessary. This young
gentleman was about to become singularly inconvenient, and he is
in no way harmed."</p>
<p>He spoke in a velvety voice, and walked away gently through
the darkness. Carlos followed with the lanthorn dangling at arm's
length; strangely enough he had not even looked at me. I suppose
he was ashamed, and I was too proud to speak to him, with my
hands and feet tied fast. The door closed, and I remained sitting
in the darkness. Long small windows grew into light at one end of
the place, curved into an outline that suggested a deep recess.
The figure of a crowned woman, that moved rigidly up and down,
was silhouetted over my body. Groaning creaks of wood and the
faint swish of water made themselves heard continuously.</p>
<p>I turned my head to a click, I saw a door open a little way,
and the small blue flame of a taper floated into the room. Then
the door closed with a definite sound of shutting in. The light
shone redly through protecting fingers, and upwards on to a small
face. It came to a halt, and I made out the figure of a girl
leaning across a table and looking upwards. There was a click of
glass, and then a great blaze of light created a host of shining
things; a glitter of gilded carvings, red velvet couches, a
shining table, a low ceiling, painted white, on carved rafters. A
large silver lamp she had lighted kept on swinging to the gentle
motion of the ship.</p>
<p>She stood just in front of me; the girl that I had seen
through the door; the girl I had seen play with the melon seeds.
She was breathing fast&mdash;it agitated me to be alone with
her&mdash;and she had a little shining dagger in her hand.</p>
<p>She cut the rope round my ankles, and motioned me imperiously
to turn round. "Your hands&mdash;your hands!"</p>
<p>I turned my back awkwardly to her, and felt the grip of small,
cool, very firm fingers upon my wrists. My arms fell apart, numb
and perfectly useless; I was half aware of pain in them, but it
passed unnoticed among a cloud of other emotions. I didn't feel
my finger-tips because I had the agitation, the flutter, the
tantalization of looking at her.</p>
<p>I was all the while conscious of the&mdash;say, the
irregularity of my position, but I felt very little fear. There
were the old Don, an ineffectual, silver-haired old gentleman,
who obviously was not a pirate; the sleek O'Brien, and Carlos,
who seemed to cough on the edge of a grave&mdash;and this young
girl. There was not any future that I could conceive, and the
past seemed to be cut off from me by a narrow, very dark tunnel
through which I could see nothing at all.</p>
<p>The young girl was, for the moment, what counted most on the
whole, the only thing the eye could rest on. She affected me as
an apparition familiar, yet absolutely new in her charm. I had
seen her gray eyes; I had seen her red lips; her dark hair, her
lithe gestures; the carriage of her head; her throat, her hands.
I knew her; I seemed to have known her for years. A rush of
strange, sweet feeling made me dumb. She was looking at me, her
lips set, her eyes wide and still; and suddenly she said:</p>
<p>"Ask nothing. The land is not far yet. You can escape, Carlos
thought...But no! You would only perish for nothing. Go with
God." She pointed imperiously towards the square stern-ports of
the cabin.</p>
<p>Following the direction of her hand, my eyes fell upon the
image of a Madonna; rather large&mdash;perhaps a third life-size;
with a gilt crown, a pink serious face bent a little forward over
a pink naked child that perched on her left arm and raised one
hand. It stood on a bracket, against the rudder casing, with fat
cherubs' heads carved on the supports. The young girl crossed
herself with a swift motion of the hand. The stern-ports, glazed
in small panes, were black, and gleaming in a white
frame-work.</p>
<p>"Go&mdash;go&mdash;go with God," the girl whispered urgently.
"There is a boat&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>
<p>I made a motion to rise; I wanted to go. The idea of having my
liberty, of its being again a possibility, made her seem of less
importance; other things began to have their share. But I could
not stand, though the blood was returning, warm and tingling, in
my legs and hands. She looked at me with a sharp frown puckering
her brows a little; beat a hasty tattoo with one of her feet, and
cast a startled glance towards the forward door that led on deck.
Then she walked to the other side of the table, and sat looking
at me in the glow of the lamp.</p>
<p>"Your life hangs on a thread," she murmured.</p>
<p>I answered, "You have given it to me. Shall I
never&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-?" I was acutely conscious of the
imperfection of my language.</p>
<p>She looked at me sharply; then lowered her lids. Afterwards
she raised them again. "Think of yourself. Every moment
is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>
<p>"I will be as quick as I can," I said.</p>
<p>I was chafing my ankles and looking up at her. I wanted, very
badly, to thank her for taking an interest in me, only I found it
very difficult to speak to her. Suddenly she sprang to her
feet:</p>
<p>"That man thinks he can destroy you. I hate him&mdash;I detest
him! You have seen how he treats my father."</p>
<p>It struck me, like a blow, that she was merely avenging
O'Brien's insolence to her father. I had been kidnapped against
Don Balthasar Riego's will. It gave me very well the measure of
the old man's powerlessness in face of his intendant&mdash;who
was obviously confident of afterwards soothing the
resentment.</p>
<p>I was glad I had not thanked her for taking an interest in me.
I was distressed, too, because once more I had missed Romance by
an inch.</p>
<p>Someone kicked at the locked door. A voice cried&mdash;I could
not help thinking&mdash;warningly, "Seraphina, Seraphina," and
another voice said with excessive softness, "<i>Senorita! Voyons!
quelle folie</i>."</p>
<p>She sprang at me. Her hand hurt my wrist as she dragged me
aft. I scrambled clumsily into the recess of the counter, and put
my head out. The night air was very chilly and full of brine; a
little boat towing by a long painter was sheering about in the
phosphorescent wake of the ship. The sea itself was pallid in the
light of the moon, invisible to me. A little astern of us, on our
port quarter, a vessel under a press of canvas seemed to stand
still; looming up like an immense pale ghost. She might have been
coming up with us, or else we had just passed her&mdash;I
couldn't tell. I had no time to find out, and I didn't care. The
great thing was to get hold of the painter. The whispers of the
girl urged me, but the thing was not easy; the rope, fastened
higher up, streamed away out of reach of my hand. At last, by
watching the moment when it slacked, and throwing myself half out
of the stern window, I managed to hook it with my finger-tips.
Next moment it was nearly jerked away from me, but I didn't lose
it, and the boat taking a run just then under the counter, I got
a good hold. The sound of another kick at the door made me swing
myself out, head first, without reflection. I got soused to the
waist before I had reached the bows of the boat. With a frantic
effort I clambered up and rolled in. When I got on my legs, the
jerky motion of tossing had ceased, the boat was floating still,
and the light of the stern windows was far away already. The girl
had managed to cut the painter.</p>
<p>The other vessel was heading straight for me, rather high on
the water, broad-beamed, squat, and making her way quietly, like
a shadow. The land might have been four or five miles
away&mdash;I had no means of knowing exactly. It looked like a
high black cloud, and purple-gray mists here and there among the
peaks hung like scarves.</p>
<p>I got an oar over the stern to scull, but I was not fit for
much exertion. I stared at the ship I had left. Her stern windows
glimmered with a slight up-and-down motion; her sails seemed to
fall into black confusion against the blaze of the moon; faint
cries came to me out of her, and by the alteration of her shape I
understood that she was being brought to, preparatory to lowering
a boat. She might have been half a mile distant when the gleam of
her stern windows swung slowly round and went out. I had no mind
to be recaptured, and began to scull frantically towards the
other vessel. By that time she was quite near&mdash;near enough
for me to hear the lazy sound of the water at her bows, and the
occasional flutter of a sail. The land breeze was dying away, and
in the wake of the moon I perceived the boat of my pursuers
coming over, black and distinct; but the other vessel was nearly
upon me. I sheered under her starboard bow and yelled, "Ship
ahoy! Ship ahoy!"</p>
<p>There was a lot of noise on board, and no one seemed to hear
my shouts. Several voices yelled. "That cursed Spanish ship ahead
is heaving-to athwart our hawse." The crew and the officers
seemed all to be forward shouting abuse at the "lubberly Dago,"
and it looked as though I were abandoned to my fate. The ship
forged ahead in the light air; I failed in my grab at her fore
chains, and my boat slipped astern, bumping against the side. I
missed the main chain, too, and yelled all the time with
desperation, "For God's sake! Ship ahoy! For God's sake throw me
a rope, some-, body, before it's too late!"</p>
<p>I was giving up all hope when a heavy coil&mdash;of a brace, I
suppose&mdash;fell upon my head, nearly knocking me over. Half
stunned as I was, desperation lent me strength to scramble up her
side hand over hand, while the boat floated away from under my
feet. I was done up when I got on the poop. A yell came from
forward, "Hard aport." Then the same voice addressed itself to
abusing the Spanish ship very close to us now. "What do you mean
by coming-to right across my bows like this?" it yelled in a
fury.</p>
<p>I stood still in the shadows on the poop. We were drawing
slowly past the stern of the Spaniard, and O'Brien's voice
answered in English:</p>
<p>"We are picking up a boat of ours that's gone adrift with a
man. Have you seen anything of her?" "No&mdash;confound you and
your boat." Of course those forward knew nothing of my being on
board. The man who had thrown me the rope&mdash;a passenger, a
certain Major Cowper, going home with his wife and
child&mdash;had walked away proudly, without deigning as much as
to look at me twice, as if to see a man clamber on board a ship
ten miles from the land was the most usual occurrence. He was, I
found afterwards, an absurd, pompous person, as stiff as a
ramrod, and so full of his own importance that he imagined he had
almost demeaned himself by his condescension in throwing down the
rope in answer to my despairing cries. On the other hand, the
helmsman, the only other person aft, was so astounded as to
become quite speechless. I could see, in the light of the
binnacle thrown upon his face, his staring eyes and his open
mouth.</p>
<p>The voice forward had subsided by then, and as the stern of
the Spanish ship came abreast of the poop, I stepped out of the
shadow of the sails, and going close to the rail I said, not very
loud&mdash;there was no need to shout&mdash;but very
distinctly:</p>
<p>"I am out of your clutches, Mr. O'Brien, after all. I promise
you that you shall hear of me yet."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another man had come up from forward on the poop,
growling like a bear, a short, rotund little man, the captain of
the ship. The Spanish vessel was dropping astern, silent, with
her sails all black, hiding the low moon. Suddenly a hurried hail
came out of her.</p>
<p>"What ship is this?"</p>
<p>"What's that to you, blank your eyes? The <i>Breeze</i>, if
you want to know. What are you going to do about it?" the little
skipper shouted fiercely. In the light wind the ships were
separating slowly.</p>
<p>"Where are you bound to?" hailed O'Brien's voice again.</p>
<p>The little skipper laughed with exasperation. "Dash your
blanked impudence. To Havana, and be hanged to you. Anything more
you want to know? And my name's Lumsden, and I am sixty years
old, and if I had you here, I would put a head on you for getting
in my way, you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped, out of breath. Then, addressing himself to his
passenger:</p>
<p>"That's the Spanish chartered ship that brought these
sanguinary pirates that were hanged this morning, major. She's
taking the Spanish commissioner back. I suppose they had no
man-of-war handy for the service in Cuba. Did you
ever&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He had caught sight of me for the first time, and positively
jumped a foot high with astonishment.</p>
<p>"Who on earth's that there?"</p>
<p>His astonishment was comprehensible. The major, Without
deigning to enlighten him, walked proudly away. He was too
dignified a person to explain.</p>
<p>It was left to me. Frequenting, as I had been doing, Ramon's
store, which was a great gossiping centre of the maritime world
in Kingston, I knew the faces and the names of most of the
merchant captains who used to gather there to drink and swap
yarns. I was not myself quite unknown to little Lumsden. I told
him all my story, and all the time he kept on scratching his bald
head, full of incredulous perplexity. Old Se&ntilde;or Ramon!
Such a respectable man. And I had been kidnapped? From his
store!</p>
<p>"If I didn't see you here in my cuddy before my eyes, I
wouldn't believe a word you say," he declared absurdly.</p>
<p>But he was ready enough to take me to Havana. However, he
insisted upon calling down his mate, a gingery fellow, short,
too, but wizened, and as stupid as himself.</p>
<p>"Here's that Kemp, you know. The young fellow that Macdonald
of the Horton Pen picked up somewhere two years ago. The
Spaniards in that ship kidnapped him&mdash;so he says. He says
they are pirates. But that's a government chartered ship, and all
the pirates that have ever been in her were hanged this morning
in Kingston. But here he is, anyhow. And he says that at home he
had throttled a Bow Street runner before he went off with the
smugglers. Did you ever hear the likes of it, Mercer? I shouldn't
think he was telling us a parcel of lies; hey, Mercer?"</p>
<p>And the two grotesque little chaps stood nodding their heads
at me sagaciously.</p>
<p>"He's a desperate character, then," said Mercer at last,
cautiously. "This morning, the very last thing I heard ashore, as
I went to fetch the fresh beef off, is that he had been
assaulting a justice of the peace on the highroad, and had been
trying to knock down the admiral, who was coming down to town in
a chaise with Mr. Topnambo. There's a warrant out against him
under the Black Act, sir."</p>
<p>Then he brightened up considerably. "So he must have been
kidnapped or something after all, sir, or he would be in chokey
now."</p>
<p>It was true, after all. Romance reserved me for another fate,
for another sort of captivity, for more than one sort. And my
imagination had been captured, enslaved already by the image of
that young girl who had called me her English cousin, the girl
with the lizard, the girl with the dagger! And with every word
she uttered romance itself, if I had only known it, the romance
of persecuted lovers, spoke to me through her lips.</p>
<p>That night the Spanish ship had the advantage of us in a
freshening wind, and overtook the <i>Breeze</i>. Before morning
dawned she passed us, and before the close of the next day she
was gone out of sight ahead, steering, apparently, the same
course with ourselves.</p>
<p>Her superior sailing had an enormous influence upon my
fortunes; and I was more adrift in the world than ever before,
more in the dark as to what awaited me than when I was lugged
along with my head in a sack. I gave her but little thought. A
sort of numbness had come over me. I could think of the girl who
had cut me free, and for all my resentment at the indignity of my
treatment, I had hardly a thought to spare for the man who had me
bound. I was pleased to remember that she hated him; that she had
said so herself. For the rest, I had a vague notion of going to
the English Consul in Havana. After all, I was not a complete
nobody. I was John Kemp, a gentleman, well connected; I could
prove it. The Bow Street runner had not been dead as I had
thought. The last letter from Veronica informed me that the man
had given up thief-catching, and was keeping, now, a little inn
in the neighbourhood. Ralph, my brother-in-law, had helped him to
it, no doubt. I could come home safely now.</p>
<p>And I had discovered I was no longer anxious to return home.

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>There wasn't any weirdness about the ship when I woke in the
sunlight. She was old and slow and rather small. She carried
Lumsden (master), Mercer (mate), a crew that seemed no better and
no worse than any other crew, and the old gentleman who had
thrown me the rope the night before, and who seemed to think that
he had derogated from his dignity in doing it. He was a Major
Cowper, retiring from a West Indian regiment, and had with him
his wife and a disagreeable little girl, with a yellow pigtail
and a bony little chest and arms.</p>
<p>On the whole, they weren't the sort of people that one would
have chosen for companions on a pleasure-trip. Major Cowper's
wife lay all day in a deck chair, alternately drawing to her and
repulsing the whining little girl. The major talked to me about
the scandals with which the world was filled, and kept a
suspicious eye upon his wife. He spent the morning in shaving
what part of his face his white whiskers did not cover, the
afternoon in enumerating to me the subjects on which he intended
to write to the Horse Guards. He had grown entirely amiable,
perhaps for the reason that his wife ignored my existence.</p>
<p>Meantime I let the days slip by idly, only wondering how I
could manage to remain in Havana and breathe the air of the same
island with the girl who had delivered me. Perhaps some day we
might meet&mdash;who knows? I was not afraid of that
Irishman.</p>
<p>It never occurred to me to bother about the course we were
taking, till one day we sighted the Cuban coast, and I heard
Lumsden and Mercer pronounce the name of Rio Medio. The two
ridiculous old chaps talked of Mexican privateers, which seemed
to rendezvous off that place. They pointed out to me the headland
near the bay. There was no sign of privateer or pirate, as far as
the eye could reach. In the course of beating up to windward we
closed in with the coast, and then the wind fell.</p>
<p>I remained motionless against the rail for half the night,
looking at the land. Not a single light was visible. A wistful,
dreamy longing, a quiet longing pervaded me, as though I had been
drugged. I dreamed, as young men dream, of a girl's face. She was
sleeping there within this dim vision of land. Perhaps this was
as near as I should ever be able to approach her. I felt a sorrow
without much suffering. A great stillness reigned around the
ship, over the whole earth. At last I went below and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>I was awakened by the idea that I had heard an extraordinary
row&mdash;shouting and stamping. But there was a dead silence, to
which I was listening with all my ears. Suddenly there was a
little pop, as if someone had spat rather vigorously; then a
succession of shouts, then another little pop, and more shouts,
and the stamping overhead. A woman began to shriek on the other
side of the bulkhead, then another woman somewhere else, then the
little girl. I hurried on deck, but it was some minutes before I
could make things fit together. I saw Major Cowper on the poop;
he was brandishing a little pistol and apostrophizing Lumsden,
who was waving ineffectual arms towards the sky; and there was a
great deal of shouting, forward and overhead. Cowper rushed at
me, and explained that something was an abominable scandal, and
that there were women on board. He waved his pistol towards the
side; I noticed that the butt was inlaid with mother-of-pearl
Lumsden rushed at him and clawed at his clothes, imploring him
not to be rash.</p>
<p>We were so close in with the coast that the surf along the
shore gleamed and sparkled in full view.</p>
<p>Someone shouted aloft, "Look out! They are firing again."</p>
<p>Then only I noticed, a quarter of a mile astern and between
the land and us, a little schooner, rather low in the water,
curtseying under a cloud of white canvas&mdash;a wonderful thing
to look at. It was as if I had never seen anything so instinct
with life and the joy of it. A snowy streak spattered away from
her bows at each plunge. She came at a great speed, and a row of
faces looking our way became plain, like a beady decoration above
her bulwarks. She swerved a little out of her course, and a sort
of mushroom of smoke grew out of her side; there was a little
gleam of smouldering light hidden in its heart. The spitting bang
followed again, and something skipped along the wave-tops beside
us, raising little pillars of spray that drifted away on the
wind. The schooner came back on her course, heading straight for
us; a shout like groaned applause went up from on board us.
Lumsden hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>I could hear little Mercer shrieking out orders forwards. We
were shortening sail. The schooner, luffing a little, ranged
abreast. A hail like a metal blare came out of her.</p>
<p>"If you donn'd heef-to we seenk you! We seenk you! By
God!"</p>
<p>Major Cowper was using abominable language beside me. Suddenly
he began to call out to someone:</p>
<p>"Go down...go down, I say."</p>
<p>A woman's face disappeared into the hood of the companion like
a rabbit's tail into its burrow. There was a great volley of
cracks from the loose sails, and the ship came to. At the same
time the schooner, now on our beam and stripped of her light
kites, put in stays and remained on the other tack, with her
foresheet to windward.</p>
<p>Major Cowper said it was a scandal. The country was going to
the dogs because merchantmen were not compelled by law to carry
guns. He spluttered into my ears that there wasn't so much as a
twopenny signal mortar on board, and no more powder than enough
to load one of his duelling pistols. He was going to write to the
Horse Guards.</p>
<p>A blue-and-white ensign fluttered up to the main gaff of the
schooner; a boat dropped into the water. It all went
breathlessly&mdash;I hadn't time to think. I saw old Cowper run
to the side and aim his pistol overboard; there was an
ineffectual click; he made a gesture of disgust, and tossed it on
deck. His head hung dejectedly down upon his chest.</p>
<p>Lumsden said, "Thank God, oh, thank God!" and the old man
turned on him like a snarling dog.</p>
<p>"You infernal coward," he said. "Haven't you got a spark of
courage?"</p>
<p>A moment after, our decks were invaded by men, brown and
ragged, leaping down from the bulwarks one after the other.</p>
<p>They had come out at break of day (we must have been observed
the evening before), a big schooner&mdash;full of as
ill-favoured, ragged rascals as the most vivid imagination could
conceive. Of course, there had been no resistance on our part. We
were outsailed, and at the first ferocious hail the halyards had
been let go by the run, and all our crew had bolted aloft. A few
bronzed bandits posted abreast of each mast kept them there by
the menace of bell-mouthed blunderbusses pointed upwards. Lumsden
and Mercer had been each tied flat down to a spare spar. They
presented an appearance too ridiculous to awaken genuine
compassion. Major Cowper was made to sit on a hen-coop, and a
bearded pirate, with a red handkerchief tied round his head and a
cutlass in his hand, stood guard over him. The major looked angry
and crestfallen. The rest of that infamous crew, without losing a
moment, rushed into the cuddy to loot the cabins for wearing
apparel, jewellery, and money. They squabbled amongst themselves,
throwing the things on deck into a great heap of booty.</p>
<p>The schooner flying the Mexican flag remained hove to abeam.
But in the man in command of the boarding party I recognized
Tomas Castro!</p>
<p>He <i>was</i> a pirate. My surmises were correct. He looked
the part to the life, in a plumed hat, cloaked to the chin, and
standing apart in a saturnine dignity.</p>
<p>"Are you going to have us all murdered, Castro?" I asked, with
indignation. To my surprise he did not seem to recognize me;
indeed, he pretended not to see me at all. I might have been thin
air for any sign he gave of being aware of my presence; but,
turning his back on me, he addressed himself to the ignobly
captive Lumsden, telling him that he, Castro, was the commander
of that Mexican schooner, and menacing him with dreadful threats
of vengeance for what he called the resistance we had offered to
a privateer of the Republic. I suppose he was pleased to qualify
with the name of armed resistance the miserable little pop of the
major's pocket pistol. To punish that audacity he announced that
no private property would be respected.</p>
<p>"You shall have to give up all the money on board," he yelled
at the wretched man lying there like a sheep ready for slaughter.
The other could only gasp and blink. Castro's ferocity was so
remarkable that for a moment it struck me as put on. There was no
necessity for it. We were meek and silent enough, only poor Major
Cowper muttered:</p>
<p>"My wife and child..."</p>
<p>The ragged brown men were pouring on deck from below; their
arms full of bundles. Half a dozen of them started to pull off
the main hatch tarpaulin. Up aloft the crew looked down with
scared eyes. I began to say excitedly, in my indignation, almost
into his very ear:</p>
<p>"I know you, Tomas Castro&mdash;I know you&mdash;Tomas
Castro."</p>
<p>Even then he seemed not to hear; but at last he looked into my
face balefully, as if he wished to convey the plague to me.</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue," he said very quickly in Spanish. "This is
folly!" His little hawk's beak of a nose nestled in his
moustache. He waved his arm and declared forcibly, "I don't know
you. I am Nicola el Demonio, the Mexican."</p>
<p>Poor old Cowper groaned. The reputation of Nicola el Demonio,
if rumours were to be trusted, was a horrible thing for a man
with women depending on him.</p>
<p>Five or six of these bandits were standing about Lumsden, the
major, and myself, fingering the locks of their guns. Poor old
Cowper, breaking away from his guard, was raging up and down the
poop; and the big pirate kept him off the companion truculently.
The major wanted to get below; the little girl was screaming in
the cuddy, and we could hear her very plainly. It was rather
horrible. Castro had gone forward into the crowd of scoundrels
round the hatchway. It was only then that I realized that Major
Cowper was in a state of delirious apprehension and fury; I
seemed to remember at last that for a long time he had been
groaning somewhere near me. He kept on saying:</p>
<p>"Oh, for God's sake&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;my poor
wife."</p>
<p>I understood that he must have been asking me to do
something.</p>
<p>It came as a shock to me. I had a vague sensation of his
fears. Up till then I hadn't realized that any one could be much
interested in Mrs. Cowper.</p>
<p>He caught hold of my arm, as if he wanted support, and
stuttered:</p>
<p>"Couldn't you&mdash;couldn't you speak
to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" He nodded in the direction of Tomas
Castro, who was bent and shouting down the hatch. "Try
to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-" the old man gasped. "Didn't you hear
the child scream?" His face was pallid and wrinkled, like a piece
of crumpled paper; his mouth was drawn on one side, and his lips
quivered one against the other.</p>
<p>I went to Castro and caught him by the arm. He spun round and
smiled discreetly.</p>
<p>"We shall be using force upon you directly. Pray resist,
Se&ntilde;or; but not too much. What? His wife? Tell that stupid
Inglez with whispers that she is safe." He whispered with an air
of profound intelligence, "We shall be ready to go as soon as
these foul swine have finished their stealing. I cannot stop
them," he added.</p>
<p>I could not pause to think what he might mean. The child's
shrieks resounding louder and louder, I ran below. There were a
couple of men in the cabin with the women. Mrs. Cowper was lying
back upon a sofa, her face very white and drawn, her eyes wide
open. Her useless hands twitched at her dress; otherwise she was
absolutely motionless, like a frozen woman. The black nurse was
panting convulsively in a corner&mdash;a palpitating bundle of
orange and purple and white clothes. The child was rushing round
and round, shrieking. The two men did nothing at all. One of them
kept saying in Spanish:</p>
<p>"But&mdash;we only want your rings. But&mdash;we only want
your rings."</p>
<p>The other made feeble efforts to catch the child as it rushed
past him. He wanted its earrings&mdash;they were contraband of
war, I suppose.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cowper was petrified with terror. Explaining the desires
of the two men was like shouting things into the ear of a very
deaf woman. She kept on saying:</p>
<p>"Will they go away then? Will they go away then?" All the
while she was drawing the rings off her thin fingers, and handing
them to me. I gave them to the ruffians whose presence seemed to
terrify her out of her senses. I had no option. I could do
nothing else. Then I asked her whether she wished me to remain
with her and the child. She said:</p>
<p>"Yes. No. Go away. Yes. No&mdash;let me think."</p>
<p>Finally it came into my head that in the captain's cabin she
would be able to talk to her husband through the deck ventilator,
and, after a time, the idea filtered through to her brain. She
could hardly walk at all. The child and the nurse ran in front of
us, and, practically, I carried her there in my arms. Once in the
stateroom she struggled loose from me, and, rushing in, slammed
the door violently in my face. She seemed to hate me. <a name=

<br></div>
<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>
<p>I went on deck again. On the poop about twenty men had
surrounded Major Cowper; his white head was being jerked
backwards and forwards above their bending backs; they had got
his old uniform coat off, and were fighting for the buttons. I
had just time to shout to him, "Your wife's down there, she's all
right!" when very suddenly I became aware that Tomas Castro was
swearing horribly at these thieves. He drove them away, and we
were left quite alone on the poop, I holding the major's coat
over my arm. Major &Ccedil;owper stooped down to call through the
skylight. I could hear faint answers coming up to him.</p>
<p>Meantime, some of the rascals left on board the schooner had
filled on her in a light wind, and, sailing round our stern, had
brought their vessel alongside. Ropes were thrown on board and we
lay close together, but the schooner with her dirty decks looked
to me, now, very sinister and very sordid.</p>
<p>Then I remembered Castro's extraordinary words; they suggested
infinite possibilities of a disastrous nature, I could not tell
just what. The explanation seemed to be struggling to bring
itself to light, like a name that one has had for hours on the
tip of a tongue without being able to formulate it. Major Cowper
rose stiffly, and limped to my side. He looked at me askance,
then shifted his eyes away. Afterwards, he took his coat from my
arm. I tried to help him, but he refused my aid, and jerked
himself painfully into it. It was too tight for him. Suddenly, he
said:</p>
<p>"You seem to be deuced intimate with that man&mdash;deuced
intimate."</p>
<p>His tone caused me more misgiving than I should have thought
possible. He took a turn on the deserted deck; went to the
skylight; called down, "All well, still?" waited, listening with
his head on one side, and then came back to me.</p>
<p>"You drop into the ship," he said, "out of the clouds. Out of
the clouds, I say. You tell us some sort of cock-and-bull story.
I say it looks deuced suspicious." He took another turn and came
back. "My wife says that you took her rings
and&mdash;and&mdash;gave them to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He had an ashamed air. It came into my head that that hateful
woman had been egging him on to this through the skylight,
instead of saying her prayers.</p>
<p>"Your wife!" I said. "Why, she might have been
murdered&mdash;if I hadn't made her give them up. I believe I
saved her life."</p>
<p>He said suddenly, "Tut, tut!" and shrugged his shoulders. He
hung his head for a minute, then he added, "Mind, I don't
say&mdash;I don't say that it mayn't be as you say. You're a very
nice young fellow...But what I say is&mdash;I am a public
man&mdash;you ought to clear yourself." He was beginning to
recover his military bearing.</p>
<p>"Oh! don't be absurd," I said.</p>
<p>One of the Spaniards came up to me and whispered, "You must
come now. We are going to cast off." At the same time Tomas
Castro prowled to the other side of the ship, within five yards
of us. I called out, "Tomas Castro! Tomas Castro! I will not go
with you." The man beside me said, "Come, se&ntilde;or!
<i>Vamos!</i>"</p>
<p>Suddenly Castro, stretching his arm out at me, cried, "Come,
<i>hombres</i>. This is the <i>caballero</i>; seize him." And to
me in his broken English he shouted, "You may resist, if you
like."</p>
<p>This was what I meant to do with all my might. The ragged
crowd surrounded me; they chattered like monkeys. One man
irritated me beyond conception. He looked like an inn-keeper in
knee-breeches, had a broken nose that pointed to the left, and a
double chin. More of them came running up every minute. I made a
sort of blind rush at the fellow with the broken nose; my elbow
caught him on the soft folds of flesh and he skipped backwards;
the rest scattered in all directions, and then stood at a
distance, chattering and waving their hands. And beyond them I
saw old Cowper gesticulating approval. The man with the double
chin drew a knife from his sleeve, crouched instantly, and sprang
at me. I hadn't fought anybody since I had been at school;
raising my fists was like trying a dubious experiment in an
emergency. I caught him rather hard on the end of his broken
nose; I felt the contact on my right, and a small pain in my left
hand. His arms went up to the sky; his face, too. But I had
started forward to meet him, and half a dozen of them flung their
arms round me from behind.</p>
<p>I seemed to have an exaggerated clearness of vision; I saw
each brown dirty paw reach out to clutch some part of me. I was
not angry any more; it wasn't any good being angry, but I made a
fight for it. There were dozens of them; they clutched my wrists,
my elbows, and in between my wrists and my elbows, and my
shoulders. One pair of arms was round my neck, another round my
waist, and they kept on trying to catch my legs with ropes. We
seemed to stagger all over the deck; I expect they got in each
other's way; they would have made a better job of it if they
hadn't been such a multitude. I must then have got a crack on the
head, for everything grew dark; the night seemed to fall on us,
as we fought.</p>
<p>Afterwards I found myself lying gasping on my back on the deck
of the schooner; four or five men were holding me down. Castro
was putting a pistol into his belt. He stamped his foot
violently, and then went and shouted in Spanish:</p>
<p>"Come you all on board. You have done mischief enough, fools
of <i>Lugarenos</i>. Now we go."</p>
<p>I saw, as in a dream of stress and violence, some men making
ready to cast off the schooner, and then, in a supreme effort, an
effort of lusty youth and strength, which I remember to this day,
I scattered men like chaff, and stood free.</p>
<p>For the fraction of a second I stood, ready to fall myself,
and looking at prostrate men. It was a flash of vision, and then
I made a bolt for the rail. I clambered furiously; I saw the deck
of the old barque; I had just one exulting sight of it, and then
Major Cowper uprose before my eyes and knocked me back on board
the schooner, tumbling after me himself.</p>
<p>Twenty men flung themselves upon my body. I made no movement.
The end had come. I hadn't the strength to shake off a fly, my
heart was bursting my ribs. I lay on my back and managed to say,
"Give me air." I thought I should die.</p>
<p>Castro, draped in his cloak, stood over me, but Major Cowper
fell on his knees near my head, almost sobbing: "My papers! My
papers! I tell you I shall starve. Make them give me back my
papers. They ain't any use to them&mdash;my
pension&mdash;mortgages&mdash;not worth a penny piece to
you."</p>
<p>He crouched over my face, and the Spaniards stood around,
wondering. He begged me to intercede, to save him those papers of
the greatest importance.</p>
<p>Castro preserved his attitude of a conspirator. I was touched
by the major's distress, and at last I condescended to address
Castro on his behalf, though it cost me an effort, for I was
angry, indignant, and humiliated.</p>
<p>"Whart&mdash;whart? What do I know of his papers? Let him find
them." He waved his hand loftily.</p>
<p>The deck was hillocked with heaps of clothing, of bedding,
casks of rum, old hats, and tarpaulins. Cowper ran in and out
among the plunder, like a pointer in a turnip field. He was
groaning.</p>
<p>Beside one of the pumps was a small pile of shiny cases;
ship's instruments, a chronometer in its case, a medicine
chest.</p>
<p>Cowper tottered at a black dispatch-box. "There, there!" he
said; "I tell you I shall starve if I don't have it. Ask
him&mdash;ask him&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-" He was clutching me like
a drowning man.</p>
<p>Castro raised the inevitable arm towards heaven, letting his
round black cloak fall into folds like those of an umbrella.
Cowper gathered that he might take his japanned dispatch-box; he
seized the brass handles and rushed towards the side, but at the
last moment he had the good impulse to return to me, holding out
his hand, and spluttering distractedly, "God bless you, God bless
you." After a time he remembered that I had rescued his wife and
child, and he asked God to bless me for that too. "If it is ever
necessary," he said, "on my honour, if you escape, I will come a
thousand miles to testify. On my honour&mdash;remember." He said
he was going to live in Clapham. That is as much as I remember. I
was held pinned down to the deck, and he disappeared from my
sight. Before the ships had separated, I was carried below in the
cabin of the schooner.</p>
<p>They left me alone there, and I sat with my head on my arms
for a long time, I did not think of anything at all; I was too
utterly done up with my struggles, and there was nothing to be
thought about. I had grown to accept the meanness of things as if
I had aged a great deal. I had seen men scratch each other's
faces over coat buttons, old shoes&mdash;over Mercer's trousers.
My own future did not interest me at this stage. I sat up and
looked round me.</p>
<p>I was in a small, bare cabin, roughly wainscotted and
exceedingly filthy. There were the grease-marks from the backs of
heads all along a bulkhead above a wooden bench; the rough table,
on which my arms rested, was covered with layers of tallow spots.
Bright light shone through a porthole. Two or three ill-assorted
muskets slanted about round the foot of the mast&mdash;a long old
piece, of the time of Pizarro, all red velvet and silver'
chasing, on a swivelled stand, three English fowling-pieces, and
a coachman's blunderbuss. A man was rising from a mattress
stretched on the floor; he placed a mandolin, decorated with red
favours, on the greasy table. He was shockingly thin, and so tall
that his head disturbed the candle-soot on the ceiling. He said:
"Ah, I was waiting for the cavalier to awake."</p>
<p>He stalked round the end of the table, slid between it and the
side, and grasped my arm with wrapt earnestness as he settled
himself slowly beside me. He wore a red shirt that had become
rather black where his long brown ringlets fell on his shoulders;
it had tarnished gilt buttons ciphered "G. R.," stolen, I
suppose, from some English ship.</p>
<p>"I beg the Se&ntilde;or Caballero to listen to what I have to
record," he said, with intense gravity. "I cannot bear this much
longer&mdash;no, I cannot bear my sufferings much longer."</p>
<p>His face was of a large, classical type; a close-featured,
rather long face, with an immense nose that from the front
resembled the section of a bell; eyebrows like horseshoes, and
very large-pupilled eyes that had the purplish-brown lustre of a
horse's. His air was mournful in the extreme, and he began to
speak resonantly as if his chest were a sounding-board. He used
immensely long sentences, of which I only understood
one-half.</p>
<p>"What, then, is the difference between me, Manuel-del-Popolo
Isturiz, and this Tomas Castro? The Se&ntilde;or Caballero can
tell at once. Look at me. I am the finer man. I would have you
ask the ladies of Rio Medio, and leave the verdict to them. This
Castro is an Andalou&mdash;a foreigner. And we, the braves of Rio
Medio, will suffer no foreigner to make headway with our ladies.
Yet this Andalusian is preferred because he is a humble friend of
the great Don, and because he is for a few days given the
command. I ask you, Se&ntilde;or, what is the radical difference
between me, the sailing captain of this vessel, and him, the
fighting captain for a few days? Is it not I that am, as it were,
the brains of it, and he only its knife? I ask the Se&ntilde;or
Caballero."</p>
<p>I didn't in the least know what to answer. His great eyes
wistfully explored my face. I expect I looked bewildered.</p>
<p>"I lay my case at your feet," he continued. "You are to be our
chief leader, and, on account of your illustrious birth and
renowned intelligence, will occupy a superior position in the
council of the notables. Is it not so? Has not the Se&ntilde;or
Juez O'Brien so ordained? You will give ear to me, you will
alleviate my indignant sufferings?" He implored me with his eyes
for a long time.</p>
<p>Manuel-del-Popolo, as he called himself, pushed the hair back
from his forehead. I had noticed that the love-locks were plaited
with black braid, and that he wore large dirty silk ruffles.</p>
<p>"The <i>caballero</i>" he continued, marking his words with a
long, white finger a-tap on the table, "will represent my views
to the notables. My position at present, as I have had the honour
to observe, is become unbearable. Consider, too, how your worship
and I would work together. What lightness for you and me. You
will find this Castro unbearably gross. But I&mdash;I assure you
I am a man of taste&mdash;an <i>improvisador</i>&mdash;an artist.
My songs are celebrated. And yet!..."</p>
<p>He folded his arms again, and waited; then he said, employing
his most impressive voice:</p>
<p>"I have influence with the men of Rio. I could raise a riot.
We Cubans are a jealous people; we do not love that foreigners
should take our best from us. We do not love it; we will not
suffer it. Let this Castro bethink himself and go in peace,
leaving us and our ladies. As the proverb says, 'It is well to
build a bridge for a departing enemy.'"</p>
<p>He began to peer at me more wistfully, and his eyes grew more
luminous than ever. This man, in spite of his grotesqueness, was
quite in earnest, there was no doubting that.</p>
<p>"I have a gentle spirit," he began again, "a gentle spirit. I
am submissive to the legitimate authorities. What the
Se&ntilde;or Juez O'Brien asks me to do, I do. I would put a
knife into any one who inconvenienced the Se&ntilde;or Juez
O'Brien, who is a good Catholic; we would all do that, as is
right and fitting. But this Castro&mdash;this Andalou, who is
nearly as bad as a heretic! When my day comes, I will have his
arms flayed and the soles of his feet, and I will rub red pepper
into them; and all the men of Rio who do not love foreigners will
applaud. And I will stick little thorns under his tongue, and I
will cut off his eyelids with little scissors, and set him facing
the sun. <i>Caballero</i>, you would love me; I have a gentle
spirit. I am a pleasant companion." He rose and squeezed round
the table. "Listen"&mdash;his eyes lit up with rapture&mdash;"you
shall hear me. It is divine&mdash;ah, it is very pleasant, you
will say."</p>
<p>He seized his mandolin, slung it round his neck, and leant
against the bulkhead. The bright light from the port-hole gilded
the outlines of his body, as he swayed about and moved his long
fingers across the strings; they tinkled metallically. He sang in
a nasal voice:</p>
<pre>
     "'Listen!' the young girls say as they hasten to the barred window.
     'Listen! Ah, surely that is the guitar of Man&mdash;u&mdash;el&mdash;del-Popolo,
     As he glides along the wall in the twilight.'"
</pre>
<p>It was a very long song. He gesticulated freely with his hand
in between the scratching of the strings, which seemed to be a
matter of luck. His eyes gazed distantly at the wall above my
head. The performance bewildered and impressed me; I wondered if
this was what they had carried me off for. It was like being mad.
He made a decrescendo tinkling, and his lofty features lapsed
into their normal mournfulness.</p>
<p>At that moment Castro put his face round the door, then
entered altogether. He sighed in a satisfied manner, and had an
air of having finished a laborious undertaking.</p>
<p>"We have arranged the confusion up above," he said to
Manuel-del-Popolo; "you may go and see to the sailing...Hurry; it
is growing late."</p>
<p>Manuel blazed silently, and stalked out of the door as if he
had an electric cloud round his head. Tomas Castro turned towards
me.</p>
<p>"You are better?" he asked benevolently. "You exerted yourself
too much. ...But still, if you liked&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" He
picked up the mandolin, and began negligently scratching the
strings. I noticed an alteration in him; he had grown softer in
the flesh in the past years; there were little threads of gray in
the knotted curls of his beard. It was as if he had lived well,
on the whole. He bent his head over the strings, plucked one,
tightened a peg, plucked it again, then set the instrument on the
table, and dropped on to the mattress. "Will you have some rum?"
he said. "You have grown broad and strong, like a bull...You made
those men fly, <i>sacr&eacute; nom d'une pipe</i>...One would
have thought you were in earnest...Ah, well!" He stretched
himself at length on the mattress, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>I looked at him to discover traces of irony. There weren't
any. He was talking quietly; he even reproved me for having
carried the pretence of resistance beyond a joke.</p>
<p>"You fought too much; you struck many men&mdash;and hard. You
will have made enemies. The <i>picaros</i> of this dirty little
town are as conceited as pigs. You must take care, or you will
have a knife in your back."</p>
<p>He lay with his hands crossed on his stomach, which was round
like a pudding. After a time he opened his eyes, and looked at
the dancing white reflection of the water on the grimy
ceiling.</p>
<p>"To think of seeing you again, after all these years," he
said. "I did not believe my ears when Don Carlos asked me to
fetch you like this. Who would have believed it? But, as they
say," he added philosophically, "'The water flows to the sea, and
the little stones find their places.'" He paused to listen to the
sounds that came from above. "That Manuel is a fool," he said
without rancour; "he is mad with jealousy because for this day I
have command here. But, all the same, they are dangerous pigs,
these slaves of the Se&ntilde;or O'Brien. I wish the town were
rid of them. One day there will be a riot&mdash;a
function&mdash;with their jealousies and madness."</p>
<p>I sat and said nothing, and things fitted themselves together,
little patches of information going in here and there like the
pieces of a puzzle map. O'Brien had gone on to Havana in the ship
from which I had escaped, to render an account of the pirates
that had been hung at Kingston; the Riegos had been landed in
boats at Rio Medio, of course.</p>
<p>"That poor Don Carlos!" Castro moaned lamentably. "They had
the barbarity to take him out in the night, in that raw fog. He
coughed and coughed; it made me faint to hear him. He could not
even speak to me&mdash;his Tomas; it was pitiful. He could not
speak when we got to the Casa."</p>
<p>I could not really understand why I had been a second time
kidnapped. Castro said that O'Brien had not been unwilling that I
should reach Havana. It was Carlos that had ordered Tomas to take
me out of the <i>Breeze</i>. He had come down in the raw morning,
before the schooner had put out from behind the point, to impress
very elaborate directions upon Tomas Castro; indeed, it was
whilst talking to Tomas that he had burst a blood-vessel.</p>
<p>"He said to me: 'Have a care now. Listen. He is my dear
friend, that Se&ntilde;or Juan. I love him as if he were my only
brother. Be very careful, Tomas Castro. Make it appear that he
comes to us much against his will. Let him be dragged on board by
many men. You are to understand, Tomas, that he is a youth of
noble family, and that you are to be as careful of compromising
him as you are of the honour of Our Lady."!</p>
<p>Tomas Castro looked across at me. "You will be able to report
well of me," he said; "I did my best. If you are compromised, it
was you who did it by talking to me as if you knew me."</p>
<p>I remembered, then, that Tomas certainly had resented my
seeming to recognize him before Cowper and Lumsden. He closed his
eyes again. After a time he added:</p>
<p>"<i>Vaya!</i> After all, it is foolishness to fear being
compromised. You would never believe that his Excellency Don
Balthasar had led a riotous life&mdash;to look at him with his
silver head. It is said he had three friars killed once in
Seville, a very, very long time ago. It was dangerous in those
days to come against our Mother, the Church." He paused, and
undid his shirt, laying bare an incredibly hairy chest; then
slowly kicked off his shoes. "One stifles here," he said. "Ah! in
the old days&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned to me and said, with an air of
indescribable interest, as if he were gloating over an obscene
idea:</p>
<p>"So they would hang a gentleman like you, if they caught you?
What savages you English people are!&mdash;what savages! Like
cannibals! You did well to make that comedy of resisting. <i>Quel
pays!</i>...What a people... I dream of them still...The eyes;
the teeth! Ah, well! in an hour we shall be in Rio. I must
sleep..." <a name="2HCH0012"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
<p>By two of the afternoon we were running into the inlet of Rio
Medio. I had come on deck when Tomas Castro had started out of
his doze. I wanted to see. We went round violently as I emerged,
and, clinging to the side, I saw, in a whirl, tall, baked, brown
hills dropping sheer down to a strip of flat land and a belt of
dark-green scrub at the water's edge; little pink squares of
house-walls dropped here and there, mounting the hillside among
palms, like men standing in tall grass, running back, hiding in a
steep valley; silver-gray huts with ragged dun roofs, like
dishevelled shocks of hair; a great pink church-face, very tall
and narrow, pyramidal towards the top, and pierced for seven
bells, but having only three. It looked as if it had been hidden
for centuries in the folds of an ancient land, as it lay there
asleep in the blighting sunlight.</p>
<p>When we anchored, Tomas, beside me in saturnine silence,
grunted and spat into the water.</p>
<p>"Look here," I said. "What is the meaning of it all? What is
it? What is at the bottom?"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders gloomily. "If your worship does not
know, who should?" he said. "It is not for me to say why people
should wish to come here."</p>
<p>"Then take me to Carlos," I said. "I must get this
settled."</p>
<p>Castro looked at me suspiciously. "You will not excite him?"
he said. "I have known people die right out when they were like
that."</p>
<p>"Oh, I won't excite him," I said.</p>
<p>As we were rowed ashore, he began to point out the houses of
the notables. Rio Medio had been one of the principal ports of
the Antilles in the seventeenth century, but it had failed before
the rivalry of Havana because its harbour would not take the
large vessels of modern draft. Now it had no trade, no life, no
anything except a bishop and a great monastery, a few retired
officials from Havana. A large settlement of ragged thatched huts
and clay hovels lay to the west of the cathedral. The Casa Riego
was an enormous palace, with windows like loopholes, facing the
shore. Don Balthasar practically owned the whole town and all the
surrounding country, and, except for his age and feebleness,
might have been an absolute monarch.</p>
<p>He had lived in Havana with great splendour, but now, in his
failing years, had retired to his palace, from which he had since
only twice set foot. This had only been when official ceremonies
of extreme importance, such as the international execution of
pirates that I had witnessed, demanded the presence of someone of
his eminence and lustre. Otherwise he had lived shut up in his
palace. There was nowhere in Rio Medio for him to go to.</p>
<p>He was said to regard his intendente O'Brien as the apple of
his eye, and had used his influence to get him made one of the
judges of the Marine Court. The old Don himself probably knew
nothing about the pirates. The inlet had been used by buccaneers
ever since the days of Columbus; but they were below his serious
consideration, even if he had ever seen them, which Tomas Castro
doubted.</p>
<p>There was no doubting the sincerity of his tone.</p>
<p>"Oh, you thought <i>I</i> was a pirate!" he muttered. "For a
day&mdash;yes&mdash;to oblige a Riego, my friend&mdash;yes!
Moreover, I hate that familiar of the priests, that soft-spoken
Juez, intendente, intriguer&mdash;that O'Brien. A sufferer for
the faith! <i>Que picardia!</i> Have I, too, not suffered for the
faith? I am the trusted humble friend of the Riegos. But,
perhaps, you think Don Balthasar is himself a pirate! He who has
in his veins the blood of the Cid Campeador; whose ancestors have
owned half this island since the days of Christopher
himself..."</p>
<p>"Has he nothing whatever to do with it?" I asked. "After all,
it goes on in his own town."</p>
<p>"Oh, you English," he muttered; "you are all mad! Would one of
your great nobles be a pirate? Perhaps they would&mdash;God
knows. Alas, alas!" he suddenly broke off, "when I think that my
Carlos shall leave his bones in this ungodly place..."</p>
<p>I gave up questioning Tomas Castro; he was too much for
me.</p>
<p>We entered the grim palace by the shore through an imposing
archway, and mounted a broad staircase. In a lofty room, giving
off the upper gallery round the central court of the Casa Riego,
Carlos lay in a great bed. I stood before him, having pushed
aside Tomas Castro, who had been cautiously scratching the great
brilliant mahogany panels with a dirty finger-nail.</p>
<p>"Damnation, Carlos!" I said. "This is the third of your
treacheries. What do you want with me?"</p>
<p>You might well have imagined he was a descendant of the Cid
Campeador, only to look at him lying there without a quiver of a
feature, his face stainlessly white, a little bluish in extreme
lack of blood, with all the nobility of death upon it, like an
alabaster effigy of an old knight in a cathedral. On the
red-velvet hangings of the bed was an immense coat-of-arms,
worked in silk and surrounded by a collar, with the golden sheep
hanging from the ring. The shield was patched in with an immense
number of quarterings&mdash;lions rampant, leopards courant,
fleurs de lis, castles, eagles, hands, and arms. His eyes opened
slowly, and his face assumed an easy, languorous smile of immense
pleasure.</p>
<p>"Ah, Juan," he said, "<i>se bienvenido</i>, be welcome, be
welcome."</p>
<p>Castro caught me roughly by the shoulder, and gazed at me with
blazing, yellow eyes.</p>
<p>"You should not speak roughly to him," he said. "English
beast! He is dying."</p>
<p>"No, I won't speak roughly to him," I answered. "I see."</p>
<p>I did see. At first I had been suspicious; it might have been
put on to mollify me. But one could not put on that blueness of
tinge, that extra&mdash;nearly final&mdash;touch of the chisel to
the lines round the nose, that air of restfulness that nothing
any more could very much disturb. There was no doubt that Carlos
was dying.</p>
<p>"Treacheries&mdash;no. You had to come," he said suddenly. "I
need you. I am glad, dear Juan." He waved a thin long hand a
little towards mine. "You shall not long be angry. It had to be
done&mdash;you must forgive the means."</p>
<p>His air was so gay, so uncomplaining, that it was hard to
believe it came from him.</p>
<p>"You could not have acted worse if you had owed me a grudge,
Carlos," I said. "I want an explanation. But I don't want to kill
you..."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, oh, no," he said; "in a minute I will tell."</p>
<p>He dropped a gold ball into a silver basin that was by the
bedside, and it sounded like a great bell. A nun in a sort of
coif that took the lines of a buffalo's horns glided to him with
a gold cup, from which he drank, raising himself a little. Then
the religious went out with Tomas Castro, who gave me a last
ferocious glower from his yellow eyes. Carlos smiled.</p>
<p>"They try to make my going easy," he said. "<i>Vamos!</i> The
pillow is smooth for him who is well loved." He shut his eyes.
Suddenly he said, "Why do you, alone, hate me, John Kemp? What
have I done?"</p>
<p>"God knows I don't hate you, Carlos," I answered.</p>
<p>"You have always mistrusted me," he said. "And yet I am,
perhaps, nearer to you than many of your countrymen, and I have
always wished you well, and you have always hated and mistrusted
me. From the very first you mistrusted me. Why?"</p>
<p>It was useless denying it; he had the extraordinary
incredulity of his kind. I remembered how I had idolized him as a
boy at home.</p>
<p>"Your brother-in-law, my cousin Rooksby, was the very first to
believe that I was a pirate. I, a vulgar pirate! I, Carlos Riego!
Did he not believe it&mdash;and you?" He glanced a little
ironically, and lifted a thin white finger towards the great
coat-of-arms. "That sort of thing," he said, "<i>amigo mio</i>,
does not allow one to pick pockets." He suddenly turned a little
to one side, and fixed me with his clear eyes. "My friend," he
said, "if I told you that Rooksby and your greatest Kent earls
carried smugglers' tubs, you would say I was an ignorant fool.
Yet they, too, are magistrates. The only use I have ever made of
these ruffians was to-day, to bring you here. It was a necessity.
That O'Brien had gone on to take you when you arrived. You would
never have come alive out of Havana. I was saving your life. Once
there, you could never have escaped from that man."</p>
<p>I saw suddenly that this might be the truth. There had been
something friendly in Tomas Castro's desire not to compromise me
before the people on board the ship. Obviously he had been acting
a part, with a visible contempt for the pilfering that he could
not prevent. He <i>had</i> been sent merely to bring me to Rio
Medio.</p>
<p>"I never disliked you," I protested. "I do not understand what
you mean. All I know is, that you have used me
ill&mdash;outrageously ill. You have saved my life now, you say.
That may be true; but why did you ever make me meet with that man
O'Brien?"</p>
<p>"And even for that you should not hate me," he said, shaking
his head on the silk pillows. "I never wished you anything but
well, Juan, because you were honest and young, of noble blood,
good to look upon; you had done me and my friend good service, to
your own peril, when my own cousin had deserted me. And I loved
you for the sake of another. I loved your sister. We have a
proverb: 'A man is always good to the eyes in which the sister
hath found favour.'"</p>
<p>I looked at him in amazement. "You loved Veronica!" I said.
"But Veronica is nothing at all. There was the
Se&ntilde;orita."</p>
<p>He smiled wearily. "Ah, the Se&ntilde;orita; she is very well;
a man could love her, too. But we do not command love, my
friend."</p>
<p>I interrupted him. "I want to know why you brought me here.
Why did you ask me to come here when we were on board the
<i>Thames?</i>"</p>
<p>He answered sadly, "Ah, then! Because I loved your sister, and
you reminded me always of her. But that is all over
now&mdash;done with for good...I have to address myself to dying
as it becomes one of my race to die." He smiled at me. "One must
die in peace to die like a Christian. Life has treated me rather
scurvily, only the gentleman must not repine like a poor man of
low birth. I would like to do a good turn to the friend who is
the brother of his sister, to the girl-cousin whom I do not love
with love, but whom I understand with affection&mdash;to the
great inheritance that is not for my wasted hands."</p>
<p>I looked out of the open door of the room. There was the
absolutely quiet inner court of the palace, a colonnade of tall
square pillars, in the centre the little thread of a fountain.
Round the fountain were tangled bushes of flowers&mdash;enormous
geraniums, enormous hollyhocks, a riot of orange marigolds.</p>
<p>"How like our flowers at home!" I said mechanically.</p>
<p>"I brought the seeds from there&mdash;from your sister's
garden," he said.</p>
<p>I felt horribly hipped. "But all these things tell me
nothing," I said, with an attempt towards briskness.</p>
<p>"I have to husband my voice." He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>There is no saying that I did not believe him; I did, every
word. I had simply been influenced by Rooks-by's suspicions. I
had made an ass of myself over that business on board the
<i>Thames</i>. The passage of Carles and his faithful Tomas had
been arranged for by some agent of O'Brien in London, who was in
communication with Ramon and Rio Medio. The same man had engaged
Nichols, that Nova Scotian mate, an unscrupulous sailor, for
O'Brien's service. He was to leave the ship in Kingston, and
report himself to Ramon, who furnished him with the means to go
to Cuba. That man, seeing me intimate with two persons going to
Rio Medio, had got it into his head that I was going there, too.
And, very naturally, he did not want an Englishman for a witness
of his doings.</p>
<p>But Rooksby's behaviour, his veiled accusations, his
innuendoes against Carlos, had influenced me more than anything
else. I remembered a hundred little things now that I knew that
Carlos loved Veronica. I understood Rooksby's jealous impatience,
Veronica's friendly glances at Carlos, the fact that Rooksby had
proposed to Veronica on the very day that Carlos had come again
into the neighbourhood with the runners after him. I saw very
well that there was no more connection between the Casa Riego and
the rascality of Rio Medio than there was between Ralph himself
and old drunken Rangsley on Hythe beach. There was less,
perhaps.</p>
<p>"Ah, you have had a sad life, my Carlos," I said, after a long
time.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, and smiled his brave smile. "Ah, as to
that," he said, "one kept on. One has to husband one's voice,
though, and not waste it over lamentations. I have to tell
you&mdash;ah, yes..." He paused and fixed his eyes upon me.
"Figure to yourself that this house, this town, an immense part
of this island, much even yet in Castile itself, much gold, many
slaves, a great name&mdash;a very great name&mdash;are what I
shall leave behind me. Now think that there is a very noble old
man, one who has been very great in the world, who shall die very
soon; then all these things shall go to a young girl. That old
man is very old, is a little foolish with age; that young girl
knows very little of the world, and is very passionate, very
proud, very helpless.</p>
<p>"Add, now, to that a great menace&mdash;a very dangerous,
crafty, subtle personage, who has the ear of that old man; whose
aim it is to become the possessor of that young girl and of that
vast wealth. The old man is much subject to the other. Old men
are like that, especially the very great. They have many things
to think of; it is necessary that they rely on somebody. I am, in
fact, speaking of my uncle and the man called O'Brien. You have
seen him." Carlos spoke in a voice hardly above a whisper, but he
stuck to his task with indomitable courage. "If I die and leave
him here, he will have my uncle to himself. He is a terrible man.
Where would all that great fortune go? For the re-establishing of
the true faith in Ireland? <i>Quien sabe?</i> Into the hands of
O'Brien, at any rate. And the daughter, too&mdash;a young
girl&mdash;she would be in the hands of O'Brien, too. If I could
expect to live, it might be different. That is the greatest
distress of all." He swallowed painfully, and put his frail hand
on to the white ruffle at his neck. "I was in great trouble to
find how to thwart this O'Brien. My uncle went to Kingston
because he was persuaded it was his place to see that the
execution of those unhappy men was conducted with due humanity.
O'Brien came with us as his secretary. I was in the greatest
horror of mind. I prayed for guidance. Then my eyes fell upon
you, who were pressed against our very carriage wheels. It was
like an answer to my prayers." Carlos suddenly reached out and
caught my hand.</p>
<p>I thought he was wandering, and I was immensely sorry for him.
He looked at me so wistfully with his immense eyes. He continued
to press my hand.</p>
<p>"But when I saw you," he went on, after a time, "it had come
into my head, 'That is the man who is sent in answer to my
prayers.' I knew it, I say. If you could have my cousin and my
lands, I thought, it would be like my having your
sister&mdash;not quite, but good enough for a man who is to die
in a short while, and leave no trace but a marble tomb. Ah, one
desires very much to leave a mark under God's blessed sun, and to
be able to know a little how things will go after one is dead...I
arranged the matter very quickly in my mind. There was the
difficulty of O'Brien. If I had said, 'Here is the man who is to
marry my cousin,' he would have had you or me murdered; he would
stop at nothing. So I said to him very quietly, 'Look here,
Se&ntilde;or Secretary, that is the man you have need of to
replace your Nichols&mdash;a devil to fight; but I think he will
not consent without a little persuasion. Decoy him, then, to
Ramon's, and do your persuading.' O'Brien was very glad, because
he thought that at last I was coming to take an interest in his
schemes, and because it was bringing humiliation to an
Englishman. And Sera-phina was glad, because I had often spoken
of you with enthusiasm, as very fearless and very honourable.
Then I made that man Ramon decoy you, thinking that the matter
would be left to me."</p>
<p>That was what Carlos had expected. But O'Brien, talking with
Ramon, had heard me described as an extreme Separationist so
positively that he had thought it safe to open himself fully. He
must have counted, also, on my youth, my stupidity, or my want of
principle. Finding out his mistake, he very soon made up his mind
how to act; and Carlos, fearing that worse might befall me, had
let him.</p>
<p>But when the young girl had helped me to escape, Carlos, who
understood fully the very great risks I ran in going to Havana in
the ship that picked me up, had made use of O'Brien's own
picaroons to save me from him. That was the story.</p>
<p>Towards the end his breath came fast and short; there was a
flush on his face; his eyes gazed imploringly at me.</p>
<p>"You will stay here, now, till I die, and then&mdash;I want
you to protect.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" He fell back on the
pillows. <a name="2H_PART3"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<p>All this is in my mind now, softened by distance, by the
tenderness of things remembered&mdash;the wonderful dawn of life,
with all the mystery and promise of the young day breaking
amongst heavy thunder-clouds. At the time I was
overwhelmed&mdash;I can't express it otherwise. I felt like a man
thrown out to sink or swim, trying to keep his head above water.
Of course, I did not suspect Carlos now; I was ashamed of ever
having done so. I had long ago forgiven him his methods. "In a
great need, you must," he had said, looking at me anxiously,
"recur to desperate remedies." And he was going to die. I had
made no answer, and only hung my head&mdash;not in resentment,
but in doubt of my strength to bear the burden of the great trust
that this man whom I loved for his gayety, his recklessness and
romance, was going to leave in my inexperienced hands.</p>
<p>He had talked till, at last exhausted, he sank back gently on
the pillows of the enormous bed emblazoned like a monument. I
went out, following a gray-headed negro, and the nun glided in,
and stood at the foot with her white hands folded patiently.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or!" I heard her mutter reproachfully to the
invalid.</p>
<p>"Do not scold a poor sinner, Dona Maria," he addressed her
feebly, with valiant jocularity. "The days are not many now."</p>
<p>The strangeness and tremendousness of what was happening came
over me very strongly whilst, in a large chamber with barred
loopholes, I was throwing off the rags in which I had entered
this house. The night had come already, and I was putting on some
of Carlos' clothes by the many flames of candles burning in a
tall bronze candelabrum, whose three legs figured the paws of a
lion. And never, since I had gone on the road to wait for the
smugglers, and been choked by the Bow Street runners, had I
remembered so well the house in which I was born. It was as if,
till then, I had never felt the need to look back. But now, like
something romantic and glamorous, there came before me Veronica's
sweet, dim face, my mother's severe and resolute countenance. I
had need of all her resoluteness now. And I remembered the figure
of my father in the big chair by the ingle, powerless and lost in
his search for rhymes. He might have understood the romance of my
situation.</p>
<p>It grew upon me as I thought. Don Balthasar, I understood, was
apprised of my arrival. As in a dream, I followed the old negro,
who had returned to the door of my room. It grew upon me in the
silence of this colonnaded court. We walked along the upper
gallery; his cane tapped before me on the tessellated pavement;
below, the water splashed in the marble basins; glass lanthorns
hung glimmering between the pillars and, in wrought silver
frames, lighted the broad white staircase. Under the inner curve
of the vaulted gateway a black-faced man on guard, with a
bell-mouthed gun, rose from a stool at our passing. I thought I
saw Castro's peaked hat and large cloak flit in the gloom into
which fell the light from the small doorway of a sort of
guardroom near the closed gate. We continued along the arcaded
walk; a double curtain was drawn to right and left before me,
while my guide stepped aside.</p>
<p>In a vast white apartment three black figures stood about a
central glitter of crystal and silver. At once the aged, slightly
mechanical voice of Don Balthasar rose thinly, putting himself
and his house at my disposition.</p>
<p>The formality of movements, of voices, governed and checked
the unbounded emotions of my wonder. The two ladies sank, with a
rustle of starch and stiff silks, in answer to my profound bow. I
had just enough control over myself to accomplish that, but
mentally I was out of breath; and when I felt the slight,
trembling touch of Don Balthasar's hand resting on my inclined
head, it was as if I had suddenly become aware for a moment of
the earth's motion. The hand was gone; his face was averted, and
a corpulent priest, all straight and black below his rosy round
face, had stepped forward to say a Latin grace in solemn tones
that wheezed a little. As soon as he had done he withdrew with a
circular bow to the ladies, to Don Balthasar, who inclined his
silvery head. His lifeless voice propounded:</p>
<p>"Our excellent Father Antonio, in his devotion, dines by the
bedside of our beloved Carlos." He sighed. The heavy carvings of
his chair rose upright at his back; he sat with his head leaning
forward over his silver plate. A heavy silence fell. Death
hovered over that table&mdash;and also, as it were, the breath of
past ages. The multitude of lights, the polished floor of costly
wood, the bare whiteness of walls wainscotted with marble, the
vastness of the room, the imposing forms of furniture, carved
heavily in ebony, impressed me with a sense of secular and
austere magnificence. For centuries there had always been a Riego
living in this fortress-like palace, ruling this portion of the
New World with the whole majesty of his race. And I thought of
the long, loop-holed, buttressed walls that this abode of noble
adventurers presented foursquare to the night outside, standing
there by the seashore like a tomb of warlike glories. They built
their houses thus, centuries ago, when the bands of buccaneers,
indomitable and atrocious, had haunted their conquest with a
reminder of mortality and weakness.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous thing for me, this dinner. The portly
duenna on my left had a round eye and an irritated, parrot-like
profile, crowned by a high comb, a head shaded by black lace. I
dared hardly lift my eyes to the dark and radiant presence facing
me across a table furniture that was like a display of
treasure.</p>
<p>But I did look. She was the girl of the lizard, the girl of
the dagger, and, in the solemnity of the silence, she was like a
fabulous apparition from a half-forgotten tale. I watched
covertly the youthful grace of her features. The curve of her
cheek filled me with delight. From time to time she shook the
heavy clusters of her curls, and I was amazed, as though I had
never before seen a woman's hair. Each parting of her lips was a
distinct anticipation of a great felicity; when she said a few
words to me, I felt an inward trembling. They were indifferent
words.</p>
<p>Had she forgotten she was the girl with the dagger? And the
old Don? What did that old man know? What did he think? What did
he mean by that touch of a blessing on my head? Did <i>he</i>
know how I had come to his house? But every turn of her head
troubled my thoughts. The movements of her hands made me forget
myself. The gravity of her eyes above the smile of her lips
suggested ideas of adoration.</p>
<p>We were served noiselessly. A battalion of young lusty
negroes, in blue jackets laced with silver, walked about
barefooted under the command of the old major-domo. He, alone,
had white silk stockings, and shoes with silver buckles; his
wide-skirted maroon velvet coat, with gold on the collar and
cuffs, hung low about his thin shanks; and, with a long ebony
staff in his hand, he directed the service from behind Don
Balthasar's chair. At times he bent towards his master's ear. Don
Balthasar answered with a murmur: and those two faces brought
close together, one like a noble ivory carving, the other black
with the mute pathos of the African faces, seemed to commune in a
fellowship of age, of things far off, remembered, lived through
together. There was something mysterious and touching in this
violent contrast, toned down by the near approach to the
tomb&mdash;the brotherhood of master and slave.</p>
<p>At a given moment an enormous iron key was brought in on a
silver salver, and, bending over the chair, the gray-headed negro
laid it by Don Balthasar's plate.</p>
<p>"Don Carlos' orders," he muttered.</p>
<p>The old Don seemed to wake up; a little colour mounted to his
cheeks.</p>
<p>"There was a time, young <i>caballero</i>, when the gates of
Casa Riego stood open night and day to the griefs and poverty of
the people, like the doors of a church&mdash;and as respected.
But now it seems..."</p>
<p>He mumbled a little peevishly, but seemed to recollect
himself. "The safety of his guest is like the breath of life to a
Castilian," he ended, with a benignant but attentive look at
me.</p>
<p>He rose, and we passed out through the double lines of the
servants ranged from table to door. By the splash of the
fountain, on a little round table between two chairs, stood a
many-branched candlestick. The duenna sat down opposite Don
Balthasar. A multitude of stars was suspended over the breathless
peace of the court.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," I began, mustering all my courage, and all
my Spanish, "I do not know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>She was walking by my side with upright carriage and a
nonchalant step, and shut her fan smartly.</p>
<p>"Don Carlos himself had given me the dagger," she said
rapidly.</p>
<p>The fan flew open; a touch of the wind fanning her person came
faintly upon my cheek with a suggestion of delicate perfume.</p>
<p>She noticed my confusion, and said, "Let us walk to the end,
Se&ntilde;or."</p>
<p>The old man and the duenna had cards in their hands now. The
intimate tone of her words ravished me into the seventh
heaven.</p>
<p>"Ah," she said, when we were out of ear-shot, "I have the
spirit of my house; but I am only a weak girl. We have taken this
resolution because of your <i>hidal-guidad</i>, because you are
our kinsman, because you are English. <i>Ay de mi!</i> Would I
had been a man. My father needs a son in his great, great age.
Poor father! Poor Don Carlos!"</p>
<p>There was the catch of a sob in the shadow of the end gallery.
We turned back, and the undulation of her walk seemed to throw me
into a state of exaltation.</p>
<p>"On the word of an Englishman&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" I
began.</p>
<p>The fan touched my arm. The eyes of the duenna glittered over
the cards.</p>
<p>"This woman belongs to that man, too," muttered Seraphina.
"And yet she used to be faithful&mdash;almost a mother.
<i>Misericordia!</i> Se&ntilde;or, there is no one in this
unhappy place that he has not bought, corrupted, frightened, or
bent to his will&mdash;to his madness of hate against England. Of
our poor he has made a rabble. The bishop himself is afraid."</p>
<p>Such was the beginning of our first conversation in this court
suggesting the cloistered peace of a convent. We strolled to and
fro; she dropped her eyelids, and the agitation of her mind,
pictured in the almost fierce swiftness of her utterance, made a
wonderful contrast to the leisurely rhythm of her movements,
marked by the slow beating of the fan. The retirement of her
father from the world after her mother's death had made a great
solitude round his declining years. Yes, that sorrow, and the
base intrigues of that man&mdash;a fugitive, a hanger-on of her
mother's family&mdash;recommended to Don Balthasar's grace by her
mother's favour. Yes! He had, before she died, thrown his baneful
influence even upon that saintly spirit, by the piety of his
practices and these sufferings for his faith he always paraded.
His faith! Oh, hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite! His only faith
was hate&mdash;the hate of England. He would sacrifice everything
to it. He would despoil and ruin his greatest benefactors, this
fatal man!</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, my cousin," she said picturesquely, "he would,
if he could, drop poison into every spring of clear water in your
country...Smile, Don Juan."</p>
<p>Her repressed vehemence had held me spellbound, and the
silvery little burst of laughter ending her fierce tirade had the
bewildering effect of a crash on my mind. The other two looked up
from their cards.</p>
<p>"I pretend to laugh to deceive that woman," she explained
quickly. "I used to love her."</p>
<p>She had no one now about her she could trust or love. It was
as if the whole world were blind to the nefarious nature of that
man. He had possessed himself of her little father's mind. I
glanced towards the old Don, who at that moment was brokenly
taking a pinch of snuff out of a gold snuff-box, while the
duenna, very sallow and upright, waited, frowning loftily at her
cards.</p>
<p>"It seemed as if nothing could restrain that man," Seraphina's
voice went on by my side, "neither fear nor gratitude." He seemed
to cast a spell upon people. He was the plenipotentiary of a
powerful religious order&mdash;no matter. Don Carlos knew these
things better than she did. He had the ear of the Captain-General
through that. "Sh! But the intrigues, the intrigues!" I saw her
little hand clenched on the closed fan. There were no bounds to
his audacity. He wasted their wealth. "The audacity!" He had
overawed her father's mind; he claimed descent from his Irish
kings, he who&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; "Se&ntilde;or, my English
cousin, he even dares aspire to my person."</p>
<p>The game of cards was over.</p>
<p>"Death rather," she let fall in a whisper of calm
resolution.</p>
<p>She dropped me a deep curtsey. Servants were ranging
themselves in a row, holding upright before their black faces wax
lights in tall silver candlesticks inherited from the second
Viceroy of Mexico. I bowed profoundly, with indignation on her
behalf and horror in my breast; and, turning away from me, she
sank low, bending her head to receive her father's blessing. The
major-domo preceded the <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>. The two women
moved away with an ample rustling of silk, and with lights
carried on each side of their black, stiff figures. Before they
had disappeared up the wide staircase, Don Balthasar, who had
stood perfectly motionless with his old face over his snuff-box,
seemed to wake up, and made in the air a hasty sign of the cross
after his daughter.</p>
<p>They appeared again in the upper gallery between the columns.
I saw her head, draped in lace, carried proudly, with the white
flower in her hair. I raised my eyes. All my being seemed to
strive upwards in that glance. Had she turned her face my way
just a little? Illusion! And the double door above closed with an
echoing sound along the empty galleries. She had disappeared.</p>
<p>Don Balthasar took three turns in the courtyard, no more. It
was evidently a daily custom. When he withdrew his hand from my
arm to tap his snuff-box, we stood still till he was ready to
slip it in again. This was the strangest part of it, the most
touching, the most startling&mdash;that he should lean like this
on me, as if he had done it for years. Before me there must have
been somebody else. Carlos? Carlos, no doubt. And in this placing
me in that position there was apparent the work of death, the
work of life, of time, the pathetic realization of an inevitable
destiny. He talked a little disjointedly, with the uncertain
swaying of a shadow on his thoughts, as if the light of his mind
had flickered like an expiring lamp. I remember that once he
asked me, in a sort of senile worry, whether I had ever heard of
an Irish king called Brian Boru; but he did not seem to attach
any importance to my reply, and spoke no more till he said
good-night at the door of my chamber.</p>
<p>He went on to his apartment, surrounded by lights and preceded
by his major-domo, who walked as bowed with age as himself; but
the African had a firmer step.</p>
<p>I watched him go; there was about his progress in state
something ghostlike and royal, an old-time, decayed majesty. It
was as if he had arisen before me after a hundred years' sleep in
his retreat&mdash;that man who, in his wild and passionate youth,
had endangered the wealth of the Riegos, had been the idol of the
Madrid populace, and a source of dismay to his family. He had
carried away, <i>vi et armis</i>, a nun from a convent, incurring
the enmity of the Church and the displeasure of his sovereign. He
had sacrificed all his fortune in Europe to the service of his
king, had fought against the French, had a price put upon his
head by a special proclamation. He had known passion, power, war,
exile, and love. He had been thanked by his returned king,
honoured for his wisdom, and crushed with sorrow by the death of
his young wife&mdash;Seraphina's mother.</p>
<p>What a life! And what was my arm&mdash;my arm on which he had
leaned in his decay? I looked at it with a sort of surprise,
dubiously. What was expected of it? I asked myself. Would it have
the strength? Ah, let <i>her</i> only lean on it!</p>
<p>It seemed to me that I would have the power to shake down
heavy pillars of stone, like Samson, in her service; to reach up
and take the stars, one by one, to lay at her feet. I heard a
sigh. A shadow appeared in the gallery.</p>
<p>The door of my room was open. Leaning my back against the
balustrade, I saw the black figure of the Father Antonio,
muttering over his breviary, enter the space of the light.</p>
<p>He crossed himself, and stopped with a friendly, "You are
taking the air, my son. The night is warm." He was rubicund, and
his little eyes looked me over with priestly mansuetude.</p>
<p>I said it was warm indeed. I liked him instinctively.</p>
<p>He lifted his eyes to the starry sky. "The orbs are shining
excessively," he said; then added, "To the greater glory of God.
One is never tired of contemplating this sublime spectacle."</p>
<p>"How is Don Carlos, your reverence?" I asked.</p>
<p>"My beloved penitent sleeps," he answered, peering at me
benevolently; "he reposes. Do you know, young <i>caballero</i>,
that I have been a prisoner of war in your country, and am
acquainted with Londres? I was chaplain of the ship <i>San
Jos&eacute;</i> at the battle of Trafalgar. On my soul, it is,
indeed, a blessed, fertile country, full of beauty and of
well-disposed hearts. I have never failed since to say every day
an especial prayer for its return to our holy mother, the Church.
Because I love it."</p>
<p>I said nothing to this, only bowing; and he laid a short,
thick hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"May your coming amongst us, my son, bring calmness to a
Christian soul too much troubled with the affairs of this world."
He sighed, nodded to me with a friendly, sad smile, and began to
mutter his prayers as he went. <a name="2HCH0014">

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>Don Balthasar accepted my presence without a question. Perhaps
he fancied he had invited me; of my manner of coming he was
ignorant, of course. O'Brien, who had gone on to Havana in the
ship which had landed the Riegos in Rio Medio, gave no sign of
life. And yet, on the arrival of the <i>Breeze</i>, he must have
found out I was no longer on board. I forgot the danger suspended
over my head. For a fortnight I lived as if in a dream.</p>
<p>"What is the action you want me to take, Carlos?"</p>
<p>I asked one day.</p>
<p>Propped up with pillows, he looked at me with the big eyes of
his emaciation.</p>
<p>"I would like best to see you marry my cousin. Once before a
woman of our race had married an Englishman. She had been happy.
English things last forever&mdash;English peace, English power,
English fidelity. It is a country of much serenity, of order, of
stable affection..."</p>
<p>His voice was very weak and full of faith. I remained silent,
overwhelmed at this secret of my innermost heart, voiced by his
bloodless lips&mdash;as if a dream had come to pass, as if a
miracle had taken place. He added, with an indefinable smile of
an almost unearthly wistfulness:</p>
<p>"I would have married your sister, my Juan."</p>
<p>He had on him the glamour of things English&mdash;of English
power emerging from the dust of wars and revolution; of England
stable and undismayed, like a strong man who had kept his feet in
the tottering of secular edifices shaken to their foundations by
an earthquake. It was as if for him that were something fine,
something romantic, just as for me romance had always seemed to
be embodied in his features, in his glance, and to live in the
air he breathed. On the other side of the bed the old Don, lost
in a high-backed armchair, remained plunged in that meditation of
the old which resembles sleep, as sleep resembles death. The
priest, lighted up by the narrow, bright streak of the window,
was reading his breviary through a pair of enormous spectacles.
The white coif of the nun hovered in distant corners of the
room.</p>
<p>We were constantly talking of O'Brien. He was the only subject
of all our conversations; and when Carlos inveighed against the
Intendente, the old Don nodded sadly in his chair. He was
dishonouring the name of the Riegos, Carlos would exclaim feebly,
turning his head towards his uncle. His uncle's own province, the
name of his own town, stood for a refuge of the scum of the
Antilles. It wras a shameful sanctuary. Every ruffian, rascal,
murderer, and thief of the West Indies had come to think of this
ancient and honourable town as a safe haven.</p>
<p>I myself could very well remember the Jamaica household
expression, "The Rio Medio piracies," and all these paragraphs in
the home papers that reached us a month old headed, "The Activity
of the So-called Mexican Privateers," and urging upon our
Government the necessity of energetic remonstrances in Madrid.
"The fact, incredible as it may appear," said the writers,
"seeming to be that the nest of these Picaroons is actually
within the loyal dominions of the Spanish Crown." If Spain, our
press said, resented our recognition of South American
independence, let it do so openly, not by countenancing
criminals. It was unworthy of a great nation. "Our West Indian
trade is being stabbed in the back," declaimed the <i>Bristol
Mirror</i>. "Where is our fleet?" it asked. "If the Cuban
authorities are unable or unwilling, let us take the matter in
our own hands."</p>
<p>There was a great deal of mystery about this peculiar outbreak
of lawlessness that seemed to be directed so pointedly against
the British trade. The town of Rio Medio was alluded to as one of
the unapproachable towns of the earth&mdash;closed, like the
capital of Prester John to the travellers, or Mecca to the
infidels. Nobody I ever met in Jamaica had set eyes on the place.
The impression prevailed that no stranger could come out of it
alive. Incredible stories were told of it in the island, and
indignation at its existence grew at home and in the
colonies.</p>
<p>Admiral Rowley, an old fighter, grown a bit lazy, no
diplomatist (the stories of his being venal, I take it, were
simply abominable calumnies), unable to get anything out of the
Cuban authorities but promises and lofty protestations, had made
up his mind, under direct pressure from home, to take matters
into his own hands. His boat attack had been a half-and-half
affair, for all that. He intended, he had said, to go to the
bottom of the thing, and find out what there was in the place;
but he could not believe that anybody would dare offer resistance
to the boats of an English squadron. They were sent in as if for
an exploration rather than for an armed landing.</p>
<p>It ended in a disaster, and a sense of wonder had been added
to the mystery of the fabulous Rio Medio organization. The Cuban
authorities protested against the warlike operations attempted in
a friendly country; at the same time, they had delivered the
seven pirates&mdash;the men whom I saw hanged in Kingston. And
Rowley was recalled home in disgrace.</p>
<p>It was my extraordinary fate to penetrate into this holy city
of the last organized piracy the world would ever know. I beheld
it with my eyes; I had stood on the point behind the very battery
of guns which had swept Rowley's boats out of existence.</p>
<p>The narrow entrance faced, across the water, the great portal
of the cathedral. Rio Medio had been a place of some splendour in
its time. The ruinous heavy buildings clung to the hillsides, and
my eyes plunged into a broad vista of an empty and magnificent
street. Behind many of the imposing and escutcheoned frontages
there was nothing but heaps of rubble; the footsteps of rare
passers-by woke lonely echoes, and strips of grass outlined in
parallelograms the flagstones of the roadway. The Casa Riego
raised its buttressed and loop-holed bulk near the shore,
resembling a defensive outwork; on my other hand the shallow bay,
vast, placid, and shining, extended itself behind the strip of
coast like an enormous lagoon. The fronds of palm-clusters dotted
the beach over the glassy shimmer of the far distance. The dark
and wooded slopes of the hills closed the view inland on every
side.</p>
<p>Under the palms the green masses of vegetation concealed the
hovels of the rabble. There were three so-called 'villages' at
the bottom of the bay; and that good Catholic and terrible man,
Se&ntilde;or Juez O'Brien, could with a simple nod send every man
in them to the gallows.</p>
<p>The respectable population of Rio Medio, leading a cloistered
existence in the ruins of old splendour, used to call that
thievish rabble <i>Lugarenos</i>&mdash;villagers. They were
sea-thieves, but they were dangerous. At night, from these
clusters of hovels surrounded by the banana plantations, there
issued a villainous noise, the humming of hived scoundrels.
Lights twinkled. One could hear the thin twanging of guitars,
uproarious songs, all the sounds of their drinking, singing,
gambling, quarrelling, love-making, squalor. Sometimes the long
shriek of a woman rent the air, or shouting tumults rose and
subsided; while, on the other side of the cathedral, the houses
of the past, the houses without life, showed no light and made no
sound.</p>
<p>There would be no strollers on the beach in the daytime; the
masts of the two schooners (bought in the United States by
O'Brien to make war with on the British Empire) appeared like
slender sticks far away up the empty stretch of water; and that
gathering of ruffians, thieves, murderers, and runaway slaves
slept in their noisome dens. Their habits were obscene and
nocturnal. Cruel without hardihood, and greedy without courage,
they were no skull-and-crossbones pirates of the old kind, that,
under the black flag, neither gave nor expected quarter. Their
usual practice was to hang in rowboats round some unfortunate
ship becalmed in sight of their coast, like a troop of vultures
hopping about the carcass of a dead buffalo on a plain. When they
judged the thing was fairly safe, they would attack with a great
noise and show of ferocity; do some hasty looting amongst the
cargo; break into the cabins for watches, wearing apparel, and so
on; perpetrate at times some atrocity, such as singeing the soles
of some poor devil of a ship-master, when they had positive
information (from such affiliated helpers as Ramon, the
storekeeper in Jamaica) that there was coined money concealed on
board; and take themselves off to their sordid revels on shore,
and to hold auctions of looted property on the beach. These Were
attended by people from the interior of the province, and now and
then even the Havana dealers would come on the quiet to secure a
few pieces of silk or a cask or two of French wine. Tomas Castro
could not mention them without spitting in sign of contempt. And
it was with that base crew that O'Brien imagined himself to be
making war on the British Empire!</p>
<p>In the time of Nichols it did look as if they were really
becoming enterprising. They had actually chased and boarded ships
sixty miles out at sea. It seems he had inspired them with
audacity by means of kicks, blows, and threats of instant death,
after the manner of Bluenose sailors. His long limbs, the
cadaverous and menacing aspect, the strange nasal ferocity of
tone, something mocking and desperate in his aspect, had
persuaded them that this unique sort of heretic was literally in
league with the devil. He had been the most efficient of the
successive leaders O'Brien had imported to give some sort of
effect to his warlike operations. I laugh and wonder as I write
these words; but the man did look upon it as a war and nothing
else. What he had had the audacity to propose to me had been
treason, not thieving. It had a glamour for him which, he
supposed, a Separationist (as I had the reputation of being)
could not fail to see. He was thinking of enlarging his activity,
of getting really in touch with the Mexican Junta of rebels. As
he had said, he needed a gentleman now. These were Carlos'
surmises.</p>
<p>Before Nichols there had been a rather bloodthirsty Frenchman,
but he got himself stabbed in an <i>aguardiente</i> shop for
blaspheming the Virgin. Nichols, as far as I could understand,
had really grown scared at O'Brien's success in repulsing
Rowley's boats; he had mysteriously disappeared, and neither of
the two schooners had been out till the day of my kidnapping,
when Castro, by order of Carlos, had taken the command. The
freebooters of Rio Medio had returned to their cautious and petty
pilfering in boats, from such unlucky ships as the chance of the
weather had delivered into their hands. I heard, also, during my
walks with Castro (he attended me wrapped in his cloak, and with
two pistols in his belt), that there were great jealousies and
bickerings amongst that base populace. They were divided into two
parties. For instance, the rascals living in the easternmost
village accepted tacitly the leadership of a certain Domingo, a
mulatto, keeper of a vile grogshop, who was skilled in the art of
throwing a knife to a great distance. Man-uel-del-Popolo, the
extraordinary <i>improvisador</i> with the guitar, was an
aspirant for power with a certain following of his own. Words
could not express Castro's scorn for these fellows.
<i>Ladrones!</i> vermin of the earth, scum of the sea, he called
them.</p>
<p>His position, of course, was exceptional. A dependent of the
Riegos, a familiar of the Casa, he was infinitely removed from a
Domingo or a Manuel. He lived soberly, like a Spaniard, in some
hut in the nearest of the villages, with an old woman who swept
the earth floor and cooked his food at an outside fire&mdash;his
<i>puchero</i> and <i>tortillas</i>&mdash;and rolled for him his
provision of cigarettes for the day. Every morning he marched up
to the Casa, like a courtier, to attend on his king. I never saw
him eat or drink anything there. He leaned a shoulder against the
wall, or sat on the floor of the gallery with his short legs
stretched out near the big mahogany door of Carlos' room, with
many cigarettes stuck behind his ears and in the band of his hat.
When these were gone he grubbed for more in the depths of his
clothing, somewhere near his skin. Puffs of smoke issued from his
pursed lips; and the desolation of his pose, the sorrow of his
round, wrinkled face, was so great that it seemed were he to
cease smoking, he would die of grief.</p>
<p>The general effect of the place was of vitality exhausted, of
a body calcined, of romance turned into stone. The still air, the
hot sunshine, the white beach curving around the deserted sheet
of water, the sombre green of the hills, had the motionlessness
of things petrified, the vividness of things painted, the sadness
of things abandoned, desecrated. And, as if alone intrusted with
the guardianship of life's sacred fire, I was moving amongst
them, nursing my love for Sera-phina. The words of Carlos were
like oil upon a flame; it enveloped me from head to foot with a
leap. I had the physical sensation of breathing it, of seeing it,
of being at the same time driven on and restrained. One moment I
strode blindly over the sand, the next I stood still; and Castro,
coming up panting, would remark from behind that, on such a hot
day as this, it was a shame to disturb even a dog sleeping in the
shade. I had the feeling of absolute absorption into one idea. I
was ravaged by a thought. It was as if I had never before
imagined, heard spoken of, or seen a woman.</p>
<p>It was true. She was a revelation to my eye and my ear, as
much as to my heart and mind. Indeed, I seemed never before to
have seen a woman. Whom had I seen? Veronica? We had been too
poor, and my mother too proud, to keep up a social intercourse
with our neighbours; the village girls had been devoid of even
the most rustic kind of charm; the people were too poor to be
handsome. I had never been tempted to look at a woman's face; and
the manner of my going from home is known. In Jamaica, sharing
with an exaggerated loyalty the unpopularity of the Mac-donalds,
I had led a lonely life; for I had no taste for their friends'
society, and the others, after a time, would have nothing to do
with me. I had made a sort of hermitage for myself out of a house
in a distant plantation, and sometimes I would see no white face
for whole weeks together. She was the first woman to me&mdash;a
strange new being, a marvel as great as Eve herself to Adam's
wondering awakening.</p>
<p>It may be that a close intimacy stands in the way of love
springing up between two young people, but in our case it was
different. My passion seemed to spring from our understanding,
because the understanding was in the face of danger. We were like
two people in a slowly sinking ship; the feeling of the abyss
under our feet was our bond, not the real comprehension of each
other. Apart from that, she remained to me always unattainable
and romantic?&mdash;unique, with all the unexpressed promises of
love such as no world had ever known. And naturally, because for
me, hitherto, the world had held no woman. She was an apparition
of dreams&mdash;the girl with the lizard, the girl with the
dagger, a wonder to stretch out my hands to from afar; and yet I
was permitted to whisper intimately to this my dream, to this
vision. We had to put our heads close together, talking of the
enemy and of the shadow over the house; while under our eyes
Carlos waited for death, made cruel by his anxieties, and the old
Don walked in the darkness of his accumulated years.</p>
<p>As to me, what was I to her?</p>
<p>Carlos, in a weak voice, and holding her hand with a feeble
and tenacious grasp, had told her repeatedly that the English
cousin was ready to offer up his life to her happiness in this
world. Many a time she would turn her glance upon me&mdash;not a
grateful glance, but, as it were, searching and pensive&mdash;a
glance of penetrating candour, a young girl's glance, that, by
its very trustfulness, seems to look one through and through.</p>
<p>And then the sense of my unworthiness made me long for her
love as a sinner, in his weakness, longs for the saving
grace.</p>
<p>"Our English cousin is worthy of his great nation. He is very
brave, and very chivalrous to a poor girl," she would say
softly.</p>
<p>One day, I remember, going out of Carlos' room, she had just
paused on the threshold for an almost imperceptible moment, the
time to murmur, with feeling, "May Heaven reward you, Don Juan."
This sound, faint and enchanting, like a breath of sweet wind,
staggered me. Castro, sitting outside as usual, had scrambled to
his feet and stood by, hat in hand, his head bent slightly with
saturnine deference. She smiled at him. I think she felt kindly
towards the tubby little bandit of a fellow. After all, there was
something touching and pathetic in his mournful vigil at the door
of our radiant Carlos. I could have embraced that figure of
grotesque and truculent devotion. Had she not smiled upon
him?</p>
<p>The rest of that memorable day I spent in a state of
delightful distraction, as if I had been ravished into the
seventh heaven, and feared to be cast out again presently, as my
unworthiness deserved. What if it were possible, after
all?&mdash;this, what Carlos wished, what he had said. The
heavens shook; the constellations above the court of Casa Riego
trembled at the thought.</p>
<p>Carlos fought valiantly. There were days when his courage
seemed to drive the grim presence out of the chamber, where
Father Antonio with his breviary, and the white coif of the nun,
seemed the only reminders of illness and mortality. Sometimes his
voice was very strong, and a sort of hopefulness lighted his
wasted features. Don Balthasar paid many visits to his nephew in
the course of each day. He sat apparently attentive, and nodding
at the name of O'Brien. Then Carlos would talk against O'Brien
from amongst his pillows as if inspired, till the old man,
striking the floor with his gold-headed cane, would exclaim, in a
quavering voice, that he, alone, had made him, had raised him up
from the dust, and could abase him to the dust again. He would
instantly go to Havana; orders would be given to Cesar for the
journey this very moment. He would then take a pinch of snuff
with shaky energy, and lean back in the armchair. Carlos would
whisper to me, "He will never leave the Casa again," and an air
of solemn, brooding helplessness would fall upon the funereal
magnificence of the room. Presently we would hear the old Don
muttering dotingly to himself the name of Seraphina's mother, the
young wife of his old days, so saintly, and snatched away from
him in punishment of his early sinfulness. It was impossible that
she should have been deceived in Don Patricio (O'Brien's
Christian name was Patrick). The intendente was a man of great
intelligence, and full of reverence for her memory. Don Balthasar
admitted that he himself was growing old; and, besides, there was
that sorrow of his life...He had been fortunate in his affliction
to have a man of his worth by his side. There might have been
slight irregularities, faults of youth (O'Brien was
five-and-forty if a day). The archbishop himself was edified by
the life of the upright judge&mdash;all Havana, all the island.
The intendente's great zeal for the House might have led him into
an indiscretion or two. So many years now, so many years. A noble
himself. Had we heard of an Irish king? A king...king...he could
not recall the name at present. It might be well to hear what a
man of such abilities had to say for himself.</p>
<p>Carlos and I looked at each other silently. "And his life
hangs on a thread," whispered the dying man with something like
despair.</p>
<p>The crisis of all these years of plotting would come the
moment the old Don closed his eyes. Meantime, why was it that
O'Brien did not show himself in Rio Medio? What was it that kept
him in Havana?</p>
<p>"Already I do not count, my Juan," Carlos would say. "And he
prepares all things for the day of my uncle's death."</p>
<p>The dark ways of that man were inscrutable. He must have
known, of course, that I was in Rio Medio. His presence was to be
feared, and his absence itself was growing formidable.</p>
<p>"But what do you think he will do? How do you think he will
act?" I would ask, a little bewildered by my responsibility.</p>
<p>Carlos could not tell precisely. It was not till some time
after his arrival from Europe that he became clearly aware of all
the extent of that man's ambition. At the same time, he had
realized all his power. That man aimed at nothing less than the
whole Riego fortune, and, of course, through Seraphina. I would
feel a rage at this&mdash;a sort of rage that made my head spin
as if the ground had reeled. "He would have found means of
getting rid of me if he had not seen I was not long for this
world," Carlos would say. He had gained an unlimited ascendency
over his uncle's mind; he had made a solitude round this solemn
dotage in which ended so much power, a great reputation, a stormy
life of romance and passion&mdash;so picturesque and excessive
even in his old man's love, whose after-effect, as though the
work of a Nemesis resenting so much brilliance, was casting a
shadow upon the fate of his daughter.</p>
<p>Small, fair, plump, concealing his Irish vivacity of
intelligence under the taciturn gravity of a Spanish lawyer, and
backed by the influence of two noble houses, O'Brien had attained
to a remarkable reputation of sagacity and unstained honesty.
Hand in glove with the clergy, one of the judges of the Marine
Court, procurator to the cathedral chapter, he had known how to
make himself so necessary to the highest in the land that
everybody but the very highest looked upon him with fear. His
occult influence was altogether out of proportion to his official
position. His plans were carried out with an unswerving tenacity
of purpose. Carlos believed him capable of anything but a vulgar
peculation. He had been reduced to observe his action quietly,
hampered by the weakness of ill-health. As an instance of
O'Brien's methods, he related to me the manner in which, faithful
to his purpose of making a solitude about the Riegos, he had
contrived to prevent overtures for an alliance from the Salazar
family. The young man Don Vincente himself was impossible, an
evil liver, Carlos said, of dissolute habits. Still, to have even
that shadow of a rival out of the way, O'Brien took advantage of
a sanguinary affray between that man and one of his boon
companions about some famous guitar-player girl. The encounter
having taken place under the wall of a convent, O'Brien had
contrived to keep Don Vincente in prison ever since&mdash;not on
a charge of murder (which for a young man of that quality would
have been a comparatively venial offence), but of sacrilege. The
Salazars were a powerful family, but he was strong enough to risk
their enmity. "Imagine that, Juan!" Carlos would exclaim, closing
his eyes. What had caused him the greatest uneasiness was the
knowledge that Don Balthasar had been induced lately to write
some letter to the archbishop in Havana. Carlos was afraid it was
simply an expression of affection and unbounded trust in his
intendente, practically dictated to the old man by O'Brien. "Do
you not see, Juan, how such a letter would strengthen his case,
should he ask the guardians for Seraphina's hand?" And perhaps he
was appointed one of the guardians himself. It was impossible to
know what, were the testamentary dispositions; Father Antonio,
who had learned many things in the confessional, could tell us
nothing, but, when the matter was mentioned, only rolled his eyes
up to heaven in an alarming manner. It was startling to think of
all the unholy forces awakened by the temptation of Seraphina's
helplessness and her immense fortune. Incorruptible himself, that
man knew how to corrupt others. There might have been combined in
one dark intrigue the covetousness of religious orders, the
avarice of high officials&mdash;God knows what
conspiracy&mdash;to help O'Brien's ambition, his passions. He
could make himself necessary; he could bribe; he could frighten;
he was able to make use of the highest in the land and of the
lowest, from the present Captain-General to the <i>Lugarenos</i>.
In Havana he had for him the reigning powers; in Rio Medio the
lowest outcasts of the island.</p>
<p>This last was the most dangerous aspect of his power for us,
and also his weakest point. This was the touch of something
fanciful and imaginative; a certain grim childishness in the idea
of making war on the British Empire; a certain disregard of risk;
a bizarre illusion of his hate for the abhorred Saxon. That he
risked his position by his connection with such a nest of
scoundrels, there could be no doubt. It was he who had given them
such organization as they had, and he stood between them and the
law. But whatever might have been suspected of him, he was
cautious enough not to go too far. He never appeared personally;
his agents directed the action&mdash;men who came from Havana
rather mysteriously. They were of all sorts; some of them were
friars. But the rabble, who knew him really only as the
intendente of the great man, stood in the greatest dread of him.
Who was it procured the release of some of them who had got into
trouble in Havana? The intendente. Who was it who caused six of
their comrades, who had been taken up on a matter of
street-brawling in the capital, to be delivered to the English as
pirates? Again, the intendente, the terrible man, the Juez, who
apparently had the power to pardon and condemn.</p>
<p>In this way he was most dangerous to us in Rio Medio. He had
that rabble at his beck and call. He could produce a rising of
cut-throats by lifting his little finger. He was not very likely
to do that, however. He was intriguing in Havana&mdash;but how
could we unmask him there? "He has cut us off from the world,"
Carlos would say. "It is so, my Juan, that, if I tried to write,
no letter of mine would reach its destination; it would fall into
his hands. And if I did manage to make my voice heard, he would
appeal to my uncle himself in his defence."</p>
<p>Besides, to whom could he write?&mdash;who would believe him?
O'Brien would deny everything, and go on his way. He had been
accepted too long, had served too many people and known so many
secrets. It was terrible. And if I went myself to Havana, no one
would believe me. But I should disappear; they would never see me
again. It was impossible to unmask that man unless by a long and
careful action. And for this he&mdash;Carlos&mdash;had no time;
and I&mdash;I had no standing, no relations, no skill even...</p>
<p>"But what is my line of conduct, Carlos?" I insisted; while
Father Antonio, from whom Carlos had, of course, no secrets,
stood by the bed, his round, jolly face almost comical in its
expression of compassionate concern.</p>
<p>Carlos passed his thin, wasted hand over a white brow pearled
with the sweat of real anguish.</p>
<p>Carlos thought that while Don Balthasar lived, O'Brien would
do nothing to compromise his influence over him. Neither could I
take any action; I must wait and watch. O'Brien would, no doubt,
try to remove me; but as long as I kept within the Casa, he
thought I should be safe. He recommended me to try to please his
cousin, and even found strength to smile at my transports. Don
Balthasar liked me for the sake of his sister, who had been so
happy in England. I was his kinsman and his guest. From first to
last, England, the idea of my country, of my home, played a great
part in my life then; it seemed to rest upon all our thoughts. To
me it was but my boyhood, the farm at the foot of the
downs&mdash;Rooksby's Manor&mdash;all within a small nook between
the quarry by the side of the Canterbury road and the shingle
beach, whose regular crashing under the feet of a smuggling band
was the last sound of my country I had heard. For Carlos it was
the concrete image of stability, with the romantic feeling of its
peace and of Veronica's beauty; the unchangeable land where he
had loved. To O'Brien's hate it loomed up immense and odious,
like the form of a colossal enemy. Father Antonio, in the
na&iuml;ve benevolence of his heart, prayed each night for its
conversion, as if it were a loved sinner. He believed this event
to be not very far off accomplishment, and told me once, with an
amazing simplicity of certitude, that "there will be a great joy
amongst the host of heaven on that day." It is marvellous how
that distant land, from which I had escaped as if from a prison
to go in search of romance, appeared romantic and perfect in
these days&mdash;all things to all men! With Seraphina I talked
of it and its denizens as of a fabulous country. I wonder what
idea she had formed of my father, of my mother, my
sister&mdash;"Se&ntilde;ora Dona Veronica Rooksby," she called
her&mdash;of the landscape, of the life, of the sky. Her eyes
turned to me seriously. Once, stooping, she plucked an orange
marigold for her hair; and at last we came to talk of our farm as
the only perfect refuge for her. <a name="2HCH0015">

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>One evening Carlos, after a silence of distress, had said,
"There's nothing else for it. When the crisis comes, you must
carry her off from this unhappiness and misery that hangs over
her head. You must take her out of Cuba; there is no safety for
her here."</p>
<p>This took my breath away. "But where are we to go, Carlos?" I
asked, bending over him.</p>
<p>"To&mdash;to England," he whispered.</p>
<p>He was utterly worn out that evening by all the perplexities
of his death-bed. He made a great effort and murmured a few words
more&mdash;about the Spanish ambassador in London being a near
relation of the Riegos; then he gave it up and lay still under my
amazed eyes. The nun was approaching, alarmed, from the shadows.
Father Antonio, gazing sadly upon his beloved penitent, signed me
to withdraw.</p>
<p>Castro had not gone away yet; he greeted me in low tones
outside the big door.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or," he went on, "I make my report usually to his
Se&ntilde;oria Don Carlos; only I have not been admitted to-day
into his rooms at all. But what I have to say is for your ear,
also. There has arrived a friar from a Havana convent amongst the
<i>Lugarenos</i> of the bay. I have known him come like this
before."</p>
<p>I remembered that in the morning, while dressing, I had
glanced out of the narrow outside window of my room, and had seen
a brown, mounted figure passing on the sands. Its sandalled feet
dangled against the flanks of a powerful mule.</p>
<p>Castro shook his head. "Malediction on his green eyes! He
baptizes the offspring of this vermin sometimes, and sits for
hours in the shade before the door of Domingo's posada telling
his beads as piously as a devil that had turned monk for the
greater undoing of us Christians. These women crowd there to kiss
his oily paw. What else they&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; <i>Basta!</i>
Only I wanted to tell you, Se&ntilde;or, that this evening (I
just come from taking a <i>pasear</i> that way) there is much
talk in the villages of an evil-intentioned heretic that has
introduced himself into this our town; of an <i>Inglez</i> hungry
for men to hang&mdash;of you, in short."</p>
<p>The moon, far advanced in its first quarter, threw an ashen,
bluish light upon one-half of the courtyard; and the straight
shadow upon the other seemed to lie at the foot of the columns,
black as a broad stroke of Indian ink.</p>
<p>"And what do you think of it, Castro?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I think that Domingo has his orders. Manuel has made a song
already. And do you know its burden, Se&ntilde;or? Killing is its
burden. I would the devil had all these <i>Improvisadores</i>.
They gape round him while he twangs and screeches, the wind-bag!
And he knows what words to sing to them, too. He has talent.
<i>Maladetta!</i>"</p>
<p>"Well, and what do you advise?"</p>
<p>"I advise the senor to keep, now, within the Casa. No songs
can give that vermin the audacity to seek the senor here. The
gate remains barred; the firearms are always loaded; and Cesar is
a sagacious African. But methinks this moon would fall out of the
heaven first before they would dare...Keep to the Casa, I
say&mdash;I, Tomas Castro."</p>
<p>He flung the corner of his cloak over his left shoulder, and
preceded me to the door of my room; then, after a "God guard you,
Se&ntilde;or," continued along the colonnade. Before I had shut
my door it occurred to me that he was going on towards the part
of the gallery on which Seraphina's apartments opened. Why? What
could he want there?</p>
<p>I am not so much ashamed of my sudden suspicion of
him&mdash;one did not know whom to trust&mdash;but I am a little
ashamed to confess that, kicking off my shoes, I crept out
instantly to spy upon him.</p>
<p>This part of the house was dark in the inky flood of shadow;
and before I had come to a recess in the wall, I heard the
discreet scratching of a finger-nail on a door. A streak of light
darted and disappeared, like a signal for the murmurs of two
voices.</p>
<p>I recognized the woman's at once. It belonged to one of
Seraphina's maids, a pretty little quadroon&mdash;a favourite of
hers&mdash;called La Chica. She had slipped out, and her
twitter-like whispering reached me in the still solemnity of the
quadrangle. She addressed Castro as "His Worship" at every second
word, for the saturnine little man, in his unbrushed cloak and
battered hat, was immensely respected by the household. Had he
not been sent to Europe to fetch Don Carlos? He was in the
confidence of the masters&mdash;their humble friend. The little
tire-woman twittered of her mistress. The senorita had been most
anxious all day&mdash;ever since she had heard the friar had
come. Castro muttered:</p>
<p>"Tell the Excellency that her orders have been obeyed. The
English <i>caballero</i> has been warned. I have been sleepless
in my watchfulness over the guest of the house, as the senorita
has desired&mdash;for the honour of the Riegos. Let her set her
mind at ease."</p>
<p>The girl then whispered to him with great animation. Did not
his worship think that it was the senorita's heart which was not
at ease?</p>
<p>Then the quadrangle became dumb in its immobility, half sheen,
half night, with its arcades, the soothing plash of water, with
its expiring lights, in a suggestion of Castilian severity,
enveloped by the exotic softness of the air.</p>
<p>"What folly!" uttered Castro's sombre voice. "You women do not
mind how many corpses come into your imaginings of love. The mere
whisper of such a thing&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>She murmured swiftly. He interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Thine eyes, La Chica&mdash;thine eyes see only the silliness
of thine own heart. Think of thine own lovers, <i>nina. Por
Dios!</i>"&mdash;he changed to a tone of severe
appreciation&mdash;"thy foolish face looks well by
moonlight."</p>
<p>I believe he was chucking her gravely under the chin. I heard
her soft, gratified cooing in answer to the compliment; the
streak of light flashed on the polished shaft of a pillar; and
Castro went on, going round to the staircase, evidently so as not
to pass again before my open door.</p>
<p>I forgot to shut it. I did not stop until I was in the middle
of my room; and then I stood still for a long time in a
self-forgetful ecstasy, while the many wax candles of the high
candelabrum burned without a flicker in a rich cluster of flames,
as if lighted to throw the splendour of a celebration upon the
pageant of my thoughts.</p>
<p>For the honour of the Riegos!</p>
<p>I came to myself. Well, it was sweet to be the object of her
anxiety and care, even on these terms&mdash;on any terms. And I
felt a sort of profound, inexpressible, grateful emotion, as
though no one, never, on no day, on no occasion, had taken
thought of me before.</p>
<p>I should not be able to sleep. I went to the window, and
leaned my forehead on the iron bar. There was no glass; the heavy
shutter was thrown open; and, under the faint crescent of the
moon I saw a small part of the beach, very white, the long streak
of light lying mistily on the bay, and two black shapes, cloaked,
moving and stopping all of a piece like pillars, their immensely
long shadows running away from their feet, with the points of the
hats touching the wall of the Casa Riego. Another, a shorter,
thicker shape, appeared, walking with dignity. It was Castro. The
other two had a movement of recoil, then took off their hats.</p>
<p>"<i>Buenas noches, caballeros</i>," his voice said, with grim
politeness. "You are out late."</p>
<p>"So is your worship. <i>Vaya, Se&ntilde;or, con Dios</i>. We
are taking the air."</p>
<p>They walked away, while Castro remained looking after them.
But I, from my elevation, noticed that they had suddenly crouched
behind some scrubby bushes growing on the edge of the sand. Then
Castro, too, passed out of my sight in the opposite direction,
muttering angrily.</p>
<p>I forgot them all. Everything on earth was still, and I seemed
to be looking through a casement out of an enchanted castle
standing in the dreamland of romance. I breathed out the name of
Seraphina into the moonlight in an increasing transport.
"Seraphina! Seraphina! Seraphina!" The repeated beauty of the
sound intoxicated me. "Seraphina!" I cried aloud, and stopped,
astounded at myself. And the moonlight of romance seemed to
whisper spitefully from below:</p>
<p>"Death to the traitor! Vengeance for our brothers dead on the
English gallows!" "Come away, Manuel."</p>
<p>"No. I am an artist. It is necessary for my soul..."</p>
<p>"Be quiet!"</p>
<p>Their hissing ascended along the wall from under the window.
The two <i>Lugarenos</i> had stolen in unnoticed by me. There was
a stifled metallic ringing, as of a guitar carried under a
cloak.</p>
<p>"Vengeance on the heretic <i>Inglez!</i>"</p>
<p>"Come away! They may suddenly open the gate and fall upon us
with sticks."</p>
<p>"My gentle spirit is roused to the accomplishment of great
things. I feel in me a valiance, an inspiration. I am no vulgar
seller of <i>aguardiente</i>, like Domingo. I was born to be the
<i>capataz</i> of the <i>Lugarenos</i>."</p>
<p>"We shall be set upon and beaten, oh, thou Manuel. Come
away!"</p>
<p>There were no footsteps, only a noiseless flitting of two
shadows, and a distant voice crying:</p>
<p>"Woe, woe, woe to the traitor!"</p>
<p>I had not needed Castro's warning to understand the meaning of
this. O'Brien was setting his power to work, only this Manuel's
restless vanity had taught me exactly how the thing was to be
done. The friar had been exciting the minds of this rabble
against me; awakening their suspicions, their hatred, their
fears.</p>
<p>I remained at the casement, lost in rather sombre reflections.
I was now a prisoner within the walls of the Casa. After all, it
mattered little. I did not want to go away unless I could carry
off Seraphina with me. What a dream! What an impossible dream!
Alone, without friends, with no place to go to, without means of
going; without, by Heaven, the right of even as much as speaking
of it to her. Carlos&mdash;Carlos dreamed&mdash;a dream of his
dying hours. England was so far, the enemy so near;
and&mdash;Providence itself seemed to have forgotten me.</p>
<p>A sound of panting made me turn my head. Father Antonio was
mopping his brow in the doorway. Though a heavy man, he was
noiseless of foot. A wheezing would be heard along the dark
galleries some time before his black bulk approached you with a
gliding motion. He had the outward placidity of corpulent people,
a natural artlessness of demeanour which was amusing and
attractive, and there was something shrewd in his simplicity.
Indeed, he must have displayed much tact and shrewdness to have
defeated all O'Brien's efforts to oust him from his position of
confessor to the household. What had helped him to hold his
ground was that, as he said to me once, "I, too, my son, am a
legacy of that truly pious and noble lady, the wife of Don Riego.
I was made her spiritual director soon after her marriage, and I
may say that she showed more discretion in the choice of her
confessor than in that of her man of affairs. But what would you
have? The best of us, except for Divine grace, is liable to err;
and, poor woman, let us hope that, in her blessed state, she is
spared the knowledge of the iniquities going on here below in the
Casa."</p>
<p>He used to talk to me in that strain, coming in almost every
evening on his way from the sick room. He, too, had his own
perplexities, which made him wipe his forehead repeatedly;
afterwards he used to spread his red bandanna handkerchief over
his knees.</p>
<p>He sympathized with Carlos, his beloved penitent, with
Seraphina, his dear daughter, whom he had baptized and instructed
in the mysteries of "our holy religion," and he allowed himself
often to drop the remark that his "illustrious spiritual son,"
Don Balthasar, after a stormy life of which men knew only too
much, had attained to a state of truly childlike and God-fearing
innocence&mdash;a sign, no doubt, of Heaven's forgiveness for
those excesses. He ended, always, by sighing heartily, to sit
with his gaze on the floor.</p>
<p>That night he came in silently, and after shutting the door
with care, took his habitual seat, a broad wooden armchair.</p>
<p>"How did your reverence leave Don Carlos?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Very low," he said. "The disease is making terrible ravages,
and my ministrations&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I ought to be used to
the sight of human misery, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" He raised
his hands; a genuine emotion overpowered him; then, uncovering
his face to stare at me, "He is lost, Don Juan," he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I fear we are about to lose him, your reverence," I
said, surprised at this display. It seemed inconceivable that he
should have been in doubt up to this very moment.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes painfully. I was forgetting the infinite
might of God. Still, nothing short of a
miracle&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But what had we done to deserve
miracles?</p>
<p>"Where is the ancient piety of our forefathers which made
Spain so great?" he apostrophized the empty air, a little wildly,
as if in distraction. "No, Don Juan; even I, a true servant of
our faith, am conscious of not having had enough grace for my
humble ministrations to poor sailors and soldiers&mdash;men
naturally inclined to sin, but simple. And now&mdash;there are
two great nobles, the fortune of a great house..."</p>
<p>I looked at him and wondered, for he was, in a manner,
wringing his hands, as if in immense distress.</p>
<p>"We are all thinking of that poor child&mdash;<i>mas que</i>,
Don Juan, imagine all that wealth devoted to the iniquitous
purposes of that man. Her happiness sacrificed."</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine this&mdash;I will not," I interrupted, so
violently that he hushed me with both hands uplifted.</p>
<p>"To these wild enterprises against your own country," he went
on vehemently, disregarding my exasperated and contemptuous
laugh. "And she herself, the <i>ni&ntilde;a</i> I have baptized
her; I have instructed her; and a more noble disposition, more
naturally inclined to the virtues and proprieties of her
sex&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But, Don Juan, she has pride, which
doubtless is a gift of God, too, but it is made a snare of by
Satan, the roaring lion, the thief of souls. And what if her
feminine rashness&mdash;women are rash, my son," he interjected
with unction&mdash;"and her pride were to lead her into&mdash;I
am horrified at the thought&mdash;into an act of mortal sin for
which there is no repentance?"</p>
<p>"Enough!" I shouted at him.</p>
<p>"No repentance," he repeated, rising to his feet excitedly,
and I stood before him, my arms down my sides, with my fists
clenched.</p>
<p>Why did the stupid priest come to talk like this to me, as if
I had not enough of my own unbearable thoughts?</p>
<p>He sat down and began to flourish his handkerchief. There was
depicted on his broad face&mdash;depicted simply and even
touchingly&mdash;the inward conflict of his benevolence and of
his doubts.</p>
<p>"I observe your emotion, my son," he said. I must have been as
pale as death. And, after a pause, he meditated aloud, "And,
after all, you English are a reverent nation. You, a scion of the
nobility, have been brought up in deplorable rebellion against
the authority of God on this earth; but you are not a
scoffer&mdash;not a scoffer. I, a humble
priest&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But, after all, the Holy Father
himself, in his inspired wisdom&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I have prayed
to be enlightened..."</p>
<p>He spread the square of his damp handkerchief on his knees,
and bowed his head. I had regained command over myself, but I did
not understand in the least. I had passed from my exasperation
into a careworn fatigue of mind that was like utter darkness.</p>
<p>"After all," he said, looking up naively, "the business of us
priests is to save souls. It is a solemn time when death
approaches. The affairs of this world should be cast aside. And
yet God surely does not mean us to abandon the living to the
mercy of the wicked."</p>
<p>A sadness came upon his face, his eyes; all the world seemed
asleep. He made an effort. "My son," he said with decision, "I
call you to follow me to the bedside of Don Carlos at this very
hour of night. I, a humble priest, the unworthy instrument of
God's grace, call upon you to bring him a peace which my
ministrations cannot give. His time is near."</p>
<p>I rose up, startled by his solemnity, by the hint of hidden
significance in these words.</p>
<p>"Is he dying now?" I cried.</p>
<p>"He ought to detach his thoughts from this earth; and if there
is no other way&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What way? What am I expected to do?"</p>
<p>"My son, I had observed your emotion. We, the appointed
confidants of men's frailties, are quick to discern the signs of
their innermost feelings. Let me tell you that my cherished
daughter in God, Se&ntilde;orita Dona Seraphina Riego, is with
Don Carlos, the virtual head of the family, since his Excellency
Don Balthasar is in a state of, I may say, infantile
innocence."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, father?" I faltered.</p>
<p>"She is waiting for you with him," he pronounced, looking up.
And as his solemnity seemed to have deprived me of my power to
move, he added, with his ordinary simplicity, "Why, my son, she
is, I may say, not wholly indifferent to your person."</p>
<p>I could not have dropped more suddenly into the chair had the
good <i>padre</i> discharged a pistol into my breast. He went
away; and when I leapt up, I saw a young man in black velvet and
white ruffles staring at me out of the large mirror set frameless
into the wall, like the apparition of a Spanish ghost with my own
English face.</p>
<p>When I ran out, the moon had sunk below the ridge of the roof;
the whole quadrangle of the Casa had turned black under the
stars, with only a yellow glimmer of light falling into the well
of the court from the lamp under the vaulted gateway. The form of
the priest had gone out of sight, and a far-away knocking,
mingling with my footfalls, seemed to be part of the tumult
within my heart. Below, a voice at the gate challenged, "Who goes
there?" I ran on. Two tiny flames burned before Carlos' door at
the end of the long vista, and two of Seraphina's maids shrank
away from the great mahogany panels at my approach. The
candlesticks trembled askew in their hands; the wax guttered
down, and the taller of the two girls, with an uncovered long
neck, gazed at me out of big sleepy eyes in a sort of dumb
wonder. The teeth of the plump little one&mdash;La
Chica&mdash;rattled violently like castanets. She moved aside
with a hysterical little laugh, and glanced upwards at me.</p>
<p>I stopped, as if I had intruded; of all the persons in the
sick-room, not one turned a head. The stillness of the lights, of
things, of the air, seemed to have passed into Seraphina's face.
She stood with a stiff carriage under the heavy hangings of the
bed, looking very Spanish and romantic in her short black skirt,
a black lace shawl enveloping her head, her shoulders, her arms,
as low as the waist. Her bare feet, thrust into high-heeled
slippers, lent to her presence an air of flight, as if she had
run into that room in distress or fear. Carlos, sitting up
amongst the snowy pillows of eider-down at his back, was not
speaking to her. He had done; and the flush on his cheek, the
eager lustre of his eyes, gave him an appearance of animation,
almost of joy, a sort of consuming, flame-like brilliance. They
were waiting for me. With all his eagerness and air of life, all
he could do was to lift his white hand an inch or two off the
silk coverlet that spread over his limbs smoothly, like a vast
crimson pall. There was something joyous and cruel in the shimmer
of this piece of colour, contrasted with the dead white of the
linen, the duskiness of the wasted face, the dark head with no
visible body, symbolically motionless. The confused shadows and
the tarnished splendour of emblazoned draperies, looped up high
under the ceiling, fell in heavy and unstirring folds right down
to the polished floor, that reflected the lights like a sheet of
water, or rather like ice.</p>
<p>I felt it slippery under my feet. I, alone, had to move, in
this great chamber, with its festive patches of colour amongst
the funereal shadows, with the expectant, still figures of priest
and nun, servants of passionless eternity, as if immobilized and
made mute by hostile wonder before the perishable triumph of life
and love. And only the impatient tapping of the sick man's hand
on the stiff silk of the coverlet was heard.</p>
<p>It called to me. Seraphina's unstirring head was lighted
strongly by a two-branched sconce on the wall; and when I stood
by her side, not even the shadow of the eyelashes on her cheek
trembled. Carlos' lips moved; his voice was almost extinct; but
for all his emaciation, the profundity of his eyes, the sunken
cheeks, the hollow temples, he remained attractive, with the
charm of his gallant and romantic temper worn away to an almost
unearthly fineness.</p>
<p>He was going to have his desire because, on the threshold of
his spiritual inheritance, he refused, or was unable, to turn his
gaze away from this world. Father Antonio's business was to save
this soul; and with a sort of simple and sacerdotal shrewdness,
in which there was much love for his most noble penitent, he
would try to appease its trouble by a romantic satisfaction. His
voice, very grave and profound, addressed me:</p>
<p>"Approach, my son&mdash;nearer. We trust the natural feelings
of pity which are implanted in every human breast, the nobility
of your extraction, the honour of your <i>hidalguidad</i>, and
that inextinguishable courage which, as by the unwearied mercy of
God, distinguishes the sons of your fortunate and unhappy
nation." His bass voice, deepened in solemn utterance, vibrated
huskily. There was a rustic dignity in his uncouth form, in his
broad face, in the gesture of the raised hand. "You shall promise
to respect the dictates of our conscience, guided by the
authority of our faith; to defer to our scruples, and to the
procedure of our Church in matters which we believe touch the
welfare of our souls...You promise?"</p>
<p>He waited. Carlos' eyes burned darkly on my face. What were
they asking of me? This was nothing. Of course I would respect
her scruples&mdash;her scruples&mdash;if my heart should break. I
felt her living intensely by my side; she could be brought no
nearer to me by anything they could do, or I could promise. She
had already all the devotion of my love and youth, the
unreasoning and potent devotion, without a thought or hope of
reward. I was almost ashamed to pronounce the two words they
expected. "I promise."</p>
<p>And suddenly the meaning pervading this scene, something that
was in my mind already, and that I had hardly dared to look at
till now, became clear to me in its awful futility against the
dangers, in all its remote consequences. It was a betrothal. The
priest&mdash;Carlos, too&mdash;must have known that it had no
binding power. To Carlos it was symbolic of his wishes. Father
Antonio was thinking of the papal dispensation. I was a heretic.
What if it were refused? But what was that risk to me, who had
never dared to hope? Moreover, they had brought her there, had
persuaded her; she had been influenced by her fears, impressed by
Carlos. What could she care for me? And I repeated:</p>
<p>"I promise. I promise, even at the cost of suffering and
unhappiness, never to demand anything from her against her
conscience."</p>
<p>Carlos' voice sounded weak. "I answer for him, good father."
Then he seemed to wander in a whisper, which we two caught
faintly, "He resembles his sister, O
Divine&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>And on this ghostly sigh, on this breath, with the feeble
click of beads in the nun's hands, a silence fell upon the room,
vast as the stillness of a world of unknown faiths, loves,
beliefs, of silent illusions, of unexpressed passions and secret
motives that live in our unfathomable hearts.</p>
<p>Seraphina had given me a quick glance&mdash;the first
glance&mdash;which I had rather felt than seen. Carlos made an
effort, and, raising himself, put her hand in mine.</p>
<p>Father Antonio, trying to pronounce a short allocution, broke
down, na&iuml;ve in his emotion, as he had been in his dignity. I
could at first catch only the words, "Beloved child&mdash;Holy
Father&mdash;poor priest..." He had taken this upon himself; and
he would attest the purity of our intentions, the necessity of
the case, the assent of the head of the family, my excellent
disposition. All the Englishmen had excellent dispositions. He
would, personally, go to the foot of the Holy See&mdash;on his
knees, if necessary. Meantime, a document&mdash;he should at once
prepare a justificative document. The archbishop, it is true, did
not like him on account of the calumnies of that man O'Brien. But
there was, beyond the seas, the supreme authority of the Church,
unerring and inaccessible to calumnies.</p>
<p>All that time Seraphina's hand was lying passive in my
palm&mdash;warm, soft, living; all the life, all the world, all
the happiness, the only desire&mdash;and I dared not close my
grasp, afraid of the vanity of my hopes, shrinking from the
intense felicity in the audacious act. Father Antonio&mdash;I
must say the word&mdash;blubbered. He was now only a
tender-hearted, simple old man, nothing more.</p>
<p>"Before God now, Don Juan...I am only a poor priest, but
invested with a sacred office, an enormous power. Tremble,
Se&ntilde;or, it is a young girl...I have loved her like my own;
for, indeed, I have in baptism given her the spiritual life. You
owe her protection; it is for that, before God,
Se&ntilde;or&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>It was as if Carlos had swooned; his eyes were closed, his
face like a carving. But gradually the suggestion of a tender and
ironic smile appeared on his lips. With a slow effort he raised
his arm and his eyelids, in an appeal of all his weariness for my
ear. I made a movement to stoop over him, and the floor, the
great bed, the whole room, seemed to heave and sway. I felt a
slight, a fleeting pressure of Seraphina's hand before it slipped
out of mine; I thought, in the beating rush of blood to my
temples, that I was going mad.</p>
<p>He had thrown his arm over my neck; there was the calming
austerity of death on his lips, that just touched my ear and
departed, together with the far-away sound of the words, losing
themselves in the remoteness of another world:</p>
<p>"Like an Englishman, Juan."</p>
<p>"On my honour, Carlos."</p>
<p>His arm, releasing my neck, fell stretched out on the
coverlet. Father Antonio had mastered his emotion; with the trail
of undried tears on his face, he had become a priest again,
exalted above the reach of his earthly sorrow by the august
concern of his sacerdocy.</p>
<p>"Don Carlos, my son, is your mind at ease, now?"</p>
<p>Carlos closed his eyes slowly.</p>
<p>"Then turn all your thoughts to heaven." Father Antonio's bass
voice rose, aloud, with an extraordinary authority. "You have
done with the earth."</p>
<p>The arm of the nun touched the cords of the curtains&raquo;
and the massive folds shook and fell expanded, hiding from us the
priest and the penitent. <a name="2HCH0016">

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>Seraphina and I moved towards the door sadly, as if under the
oppression of a memory, as people go back from the side of a
grave to the cares of life. No exultation possessed me. Nothing
had happened. It had been a sick man's whim.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," I said low, with my hand on the wrought
bronze of the door-handle, "Don Carlos might have died in full
trust of my devotion to you&mdash;without this."</p>
<p>"I know it," she answered, hanging her head.</p>
<p>"It was his wish," I said. "And I deferred."</p>
<p>"It was his wish," she repeated.</p>
<p>"Remember he had asked you for no promise."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is you only he has asked. You have remembered it very
well, Se&ntilde;or. And you&mdash;you ask for nothing."</p>
<p>"No," I said; "neither from your heart nor from your
conscience&mdash;nor from your gratitude. Gratitude from you! As
if it were not I that owe you gratitude for having condescended
to stand with your hand in mine&mdash;if only for a
moment&mdash;if only to bring peace to a dying man; for giving me
the felicity, the illusion of this wonderful instant, that, all
my life, I shall remember as those who are suddenly stricken
blind remember the great glory of the sun. I shall live with it,
I shall cherish it in my heart to my dying day; and I promise
never to mention it to you again."</p>
<p>Her lips were slightly parted, her eyes remained downcast, her
head drooped as if in extreme attention.</p>
<p>"I asked for no promise," she murmured coldly.</p>
<p>My heart was heavy. "Thank you for that proof of your
confidence," I said. "I am yours without any promises. Wholly
yours. But what can I offer? What help? What refuge? What
protection? What can I do? I can only die for you. Ah, but this
was cruel of Carlos, when he knew that I had nothing else but my
poor life to give."</p>
<p>"I accept that," she said unexpectedly. "Se&ntilde;orita, it
is generous of you to accept so worthless a gift&mdash;a life I
value not at all save for one unique memory which I owe to
you."</p>
<p>I knew she was looking at me while I swung open the door with
a low bow. I did not trust myself to look at her. An unreasonable
disenchantment, like the awakening from a happy dream, oppressed
me. I felt an almost angry desire to seize her in my
arms&mdash;to go back to my dream. If I had looked at her then, I
believed I could not have controlled myself.</p>
<p>She passed out; and when I looked up there was O'Brien booted
and spurred, but otherwise in his lawyer's black, inclining his
dapper figure profoundly before her in the dim gallery. She had
stopped short. The two maids, huddled together behind her, stared
with terrified eyes. The flames of their candles vacillated very
much.</p>
<p>I closed the door quietly. Carlos was done with the earth.
This had become my affair; and the necessity of coming to an
immediate decision almost deprived me of my power of thinking.
The necessity had arisen too swiftly; the arrival of that man
acted like the sudden apparition of a phantom. It had been
expected, however; only, from the moment we had turned away from
Carlos' bedside, we had thought of nothing but ourselves; we had
dwelt alone in our emotions, as if there had been no inhabitant
of flesh and blood on the earth but we two. Our danger had been
present, no doubt, in our minds, because we drew it in with every
breath. It was the indispensable condition of our contact, of our
words, of our thoughts; it was the atmosphere of our feelings; a
something as all-pervading and impalpable as the air we drew into
our lungs. And suddenly this danger, this breath of our life, had
taken this material form. It was material and expected, and yet
it had the effect of an evil spectre, inasmuch as one did not
know where and how it was vulnerable, what precisely it would do,
how one should defend one's self.</p>
<p>His bow was courtly; his gravity was all in his bearing, which
was quiet and confident: the manner of a capable man, the sort of
man the great of this earth find invaluable and are inclined to
trust. His full-shaven face had a good-natured, almost a
good-humored expression, which I have come to think must have
depended on the cast of his features, on the setting of his
eyes&mdash;on some peculiarity not under his control, or else he
could not have preserved it so well. On certain occasions, as
this one, for instance, it affected me as a refinement of
cynicism; and, generally, it was startling, like the assumption
of a mask inappropriate to the action and the speeches of the
part.</p>
<p>He had journeyed in his customary manner overland from Havana,
arriving unexpectedly at night, as he had often done before; only
this time he had found the little door, cut out in one of the
sides of the big gate, bolted fast. It was his knocking I had
heard, as I hurried after the priest. The major-domo, who had
been called up to let him in, told me afterwards that the senor
intendente had put no question whatever to him as to this, and
had gone on, as usual, towards his own room. Nobody knew what was
going on in Carlos' chamber, but, of course, he came upon the two
girls at the door. He said nothing to them either, only just
stopped there and waited, leaning with one elbow on the
balustrade with his good-tempered, gray eyes fixed on the door.
He had fully expected to see Seraphina come out presently, but I
think he did not count on seeing me as well. When he straightened
himself up after the bow, we two were standing side by side.</p>
<p>I had stepped quickly towards her, asking myself what he would
do. He did not seem to be armed; neither had I any weapon about
me. Would he fly at my throat? I was the bigger, and the younger
man. I wished he would. But he found a way of making me feel all
his other advantages. He did not recognize my existence. He
appeared not to see me at all. He seemed not to be aware of
Seraphina's startled immobility, of my firm attitude; but turning
his good-humoured face towards the two girls, who appeared ready
to sink through the floor before his gaze, he shook his
fore-finger at them slightly.</p>
<p>This was all. He was not menacing; he was almost playful; and
this gesture, marvellous in its economy of effort, disclosed all
the might and insolence of his power. It had the unerring
efficacy of an act of instinct. It was instinct. He could not
know how he dismayed us by that shake of the finger. The tall
girl dropped her candlestick with a clatter, and fled along the
gallery like a shadow. La Chica cowered under the wall. The light
of her candle just touched dimly the form of a negro boy, waiting
passively in the background with O'Brien's saddle-bags over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>"You see," said Seraphina to me, in a swift, desolate murmur.
"They are all like this&mdash;all, all."</p>
<p>Without a change of countenance, without emphasis, he said to
her in French:</p>
<p>"<i>Votre p&egrave;re dort sans doute,
Se&ntilde;orita</i>."</p>
<p>And she intrepidly replied, "You know very well, Se&ntilde;or
Intendente, that nothing can make him open his eyes."</p>
<p>"So it seems," he muttered between his teeth, stooping to pick
up the dropped candlestick. It was lying at my feet. I could have
taken him at a disadvantage, then; I could have felled him with
one blow, thrown myself upon his back. Thus may an athletic
prisoner set upon a jailer coming into his cell, if there were
not the prison, the locks, the bars, the heavy gates! the walls,
all the apparatus of captivity, and the superior weight of the
idea chaining down the will, if not the courage.</p>
<p>It might have been his knowledge of this, or his absolute
disdain of me. The unconcerned manner in which he busied
himself&mdash;his head within striking distance of my
fist&mdash;in lighting the extinguished candle from the trembling
Chica's humiliated me beyond expression. He had some difficulty
with that, till he said to her just audibly, "Calm thyself,
ni&ntilde;a," and she became rigid in her appearance of excessive
terror.</p>
<p>He turned then towards Seraphina, candlestick in hand,
courteously saying in Spanish:</p>
<p>"May I be allowed to help light you to your door, since that
silly Juanita&mdash;I think it was Juanita&mdash;has taken leave
of her senses? She is not fit to remain in your service&mdash;any
more than this one here."</p>
<p>With a gasp of desolation, La Chica began to sob limply
against the wall. I made one step forward; and, holding the
candle well up, as though for the purpose of examining my face
carefully, he never looked my way, while he and Seraphina were
exchanging a few phrases in French which I did not understand
well enough to fellow.</p>
<p>He was politely interrogatory, it seemed to me. The natural,
good-humoured expression never left his face, as though he had a
fund of inexhaustible patience for dealing with the unaccountable
trifles of a woman's conduct. Seraphina's shawl had slipped off
her head. La Chica sidled towards her, sobbing a deep sob now and
then, without any sign of tears; and with their scattered hair,
their bare arms, the disorder of their attire, they looked like
two women discovered in a secret flight for life. Only the
mistress stood her ground firmly; her voice was decided; there
was resolution in the way one little white hand clutched the
black lace on her bosom. Only once she seemed to hesitate in her
replies. Then, after a pause he gave her for reflection, he
appeared to repeat his question. She glanced at me
apprehensively, as I thought, before she confirmed the previous
answer by a slow inclination of her head.</p>
<p>Had he allowed himself to make a provoking movement, a dubious
gesture of any sort, I would have flung myself upon him at once;
but the nonchalant manner in which he looked away, while he
extended to me his hand with the candlestick, amazed me. I simply
took it from him. He stepped back, with a ceremonious bow for
Seraphina. La Chica ran up close to her elbow. I heard her voice
saying sadly, "You need fear nothing for yourself, child"; and
they moved away slowly. I remained facing O'Brien, with a vague
notion of protecting their retreat.</p>
<p>This time it was I who was holding the light before his face.
It was calm and colourless; his eyes were fixed on the ground
reflectively, with the appearance of profound and quiet
absorption. But suddenly I perceived the convulsive clutch of his
hand on the skirt of his coat. It was as if accidentally I had
looked inside the man&mdash;upon the strength of his illusions,
on his desire, on his passion. Now he will fly at me, I thought,
with a tremendously convincing certitude.
Now&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;All my muscles, stiffening, answered the
appeal of that thought of battle.</p>
<p>He said, "Won't you give me that light?"</p>
<p>And I understood he demanded a surrender.</p>
<p>"I would see you die first where you stand," was my
answer.</p>
<p>This object in my hand had become endowed with moral
meaning&mdash;significant, like a symbol&mdash;only to be torn
from me with my life.</p>
<p>He lifted his head; the light twinkled in his eyes. "Oh,
<i>I</i> won't die," he said, with that bizarre suggestion of
humour in his face, in his subdued voice. "But it is a small
thing; and you are young; it may be yet worth your while to try
and please me&mdash;this time."</p>
<p>Before I could answer, Seraphina, from some little distance,
called out hurriedly:</p>
<p>"Don Juan, your arm."</p>
<p>Her voice, sounding a little unsteady, made me forget O'Brien,
and, turning my back on him, I ran up to her. She needed my
support; and before us La Chica tottered and stumbled along with
the lights, moaning:</p>
<p>"<i>Madr&eacute; de Dios!</i> What will become of us now! Oh,
what will become of us now!"</p>
<p>"You know what he had asked me to let him do," Seraphina
talked rapidly. "I made answer, 'No; give the light to my
cousin.' Then he said, 'Do you really wish it, Se&ntilde;orita? I
am the older friend.' I repeated, 'Give the light to my cousin,
Se&ntilde;or.' He, then, cruelly, 'For the young man's own sake,
reflect, Se&ntilde;orita.' And he waited before he asked me
again, 'Shall I surrender it to him?' I felt death upon my heart,
and all my fear for you&mdash;there." She touched her beautiful
throat with a swift movement of a hand that disappeared at once
under the lace. "And because I could not speak,
I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Don Juan, you have just offered me your
life&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; <i>Misericordia!</i> What else
was possible? I made with my head the sign 'Yes.'"</p>
<p>In the stress, hurry, and rapture encompassing my immense
gratitude, I pressed her hand to my side familiarly, as if we had
been two lovers walking in a lane on a serene evening.</p>
<p>"If you had not made that sign, it would have been worse than
death&mdash;in my heart," I said. "He had allied me, too, to
renounce my trust, my light."</p>
<p>We walked on slowly, accompanied in our sudden silence by the
plash of the fountain at the bottom of the great square of
darkness on our left, and by the piteous moans of La Chica.</p>
<p>"That is what he meant," said the enchanting voice by my side.
"And you refused. That is your valour."</p>
<p>"From no selfish motives," I said, troubled, as if all the
great incertitude of my mind had been awakened by the sound that
brought so much delight to my heart. "My valour is nothing."</p>
<p>"It has given me a new courage," she said.</p>
<p>"You did not want more," I said earnestly.</p>
<p>"Ah! I was very much alone. It is difficult
to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>"To live alone," I finished.</p>
<p>"More so to die," she whispered, with a new note of timidity.
"It is frightful. Be cautious, Don Juan, for the love of God,
because I could not&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>We stopped. La Chica, silent, as if exhausted, drooped
lamentably, with her shoulder against the wall, by Seraphina's
door; and the pure crystalline sound of the fountain below,
enveloping the parting pause, seemed to wind its coldness round
my heart.</p>
<p>"Poor Don Carlos!" she said. "I had a great affection for him.
I was afraid they would want me to marry him. He loved your
sister."</p>
<p>"He never told her," I murmured. "I wonder if she ever
guessed."</p>
<p>"He was poor, homeless, ill already, in a foreign land."</p>
<p>"We all loved him at home," I said.</p>
<p>"He never asked her," she breathed out. "And,
perhaps&mdash;but he never asked her."</p>
<p>"I have no more force," sighed La Chica, suddenly, and sank
down at the foot of the wall, putting the candlesticks on the
floor.</p>
<p>"You have been very good to him," I said; "only he need not
have demanded this from you. Of course, I understood
perfectly...I hope you understand, too, that
I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, my cousin," she flashed out suddenly, "do you
think that I would have consented only from my affection for
him?"</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," I cried, "I am poor, homeless, in a foreign
land. How can I believe? How can I dare to dream?&mdash;unless
your own voice&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then you are permitted to ask. Ask, Don Juan."</p>
<p>I dropped on one knee, and, suddenly extending her arm, she
pressed her hand to my lips. Lighted up from below, the
picturesque aspect of her figure took on something of a
transcendental grace; the unusual upward shadows invested her
beauty with a new mystery of fascination. A minute passed. I
could hear her rapid breathing above, and I stood up before her,
holding both her hands.</p>
<p>"How very few days have we been together," she whispered.
"Juan, I am ashamed."</p>
<p>"I did not count the days. I have known you always. I have
dreamed of you since I can remember&mdash;for days, for months, a
year, all my life."</p>
<p>The crash of a heavy door flung to, exploded, filling the
galleries all round the <i>patio</i> with the sonorous reminder
of our peril.</p>
<p>"Ah! We had forgotten."</p>
<p>I heard her voice, and felt her form in my arms. Her lips at
my ear pronounced:</p>
<p>"Remember, Juan. Two lives, but one death only."</p>
<p>And she was gone so quickly that it was as though she had
passed through the wood of the massive panels.</p>
<p>La Chica crouched on her knees. The lights on the floor burned
before her empty stare, and with her bare shoulders the tone of
old ivory emerging from the white linen, with wisps of raven hair
hanging down her cheeks, the abandonment of her whole person
embodied every outward mark and line of desolation.</p>
<p>"What do you fear from him?" I asked.</p>
<p>She looked up; moved nearer to me on her knees. "I have a
lover outside."</p>
<p>She seized her hair wildly, drew it across her face, tried to
stuff handfuls of it into her mouth, as if to stop herself from
shrieking.</p>
<p>"He shook his finger at me," she moaned.</p>
<p>Her terror, as incomprehensible as the emotion of an animal,
was gaining upon me. I said sternly:</p>
<p>"What can he do, then?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>She did not know. She was like me. She feared for her love.
Like myself! Was there anything in the way of our undoing which
it was not in his power to achieve?</p>
<p>"Try to be faithful to your mistress," I said, "and all may be
well yet."</p>
<p>She made no answer, but staggered to her feet, and went away
blindly through the door, which opened just wide enough to let
her through. There were clouds on the sky. The <i>patio</i>, in
its blackness, was like the rectangular mouth of a bottomless
pit. I picked up the candlesticks, and lighted myself to my room,
walking upon air, upon tempestuous air, in a feeling of
insecurity and exultation.</p>
<p>The lights of my candelabrum had gone out. I stood the two
candlesticks on a table, and the shadows of the room, uplifted
above the two flames as high as the ceiling, filled the corners
heavily like gathered draperies, descended to the foot of the
four walls in the shape of a military tent, in which warlike
objects vaguely gleamed: a trophy of ancient arquebuses and
conquering swords, arranged with bows, spears, the stick and
stone weapons of an extinct race, a war collar of shells or
pebbles, a round wicker-work shield in a halo of arrows, with a
matchlock piece on each side&mdash;of the sort that had to be
served by two men.</p>
<p>I had left the door of my room open on purpose, so that he
should know I was back there, and ready for him. I took down a
long straight blade, like a rapier, with a basket hilt. It was a
cumbrous weapon, and with a blunt edge; still, it had a point,
and I was ready to thrust and parry against the world. I called
upon my foes. No enemy appeared, and by the light of two candles,
with a sword in my hand, I lost myself in the foreshadowings of
the future.</p>
<p>It was positive and uncertain. I wandered in it like a soul
outside the gates of paradise, with an anticipation of bliss, and
the pain of my exclusion. There was only one man in the way. I
was certain he had been watching us across the blackness of the
<i>patio</i>. He must have seen the dimly-lit dumb show of our
parting at Sera-phina's door. I hoped he had understood, and that
my shadow, bearing the two lights, had struck him as triumphant
and undismayed, walking upon air. I strained my ears. I had
heard...</p>
<p>Somebody was coming towards me along the silent galleries. It
was he; I knew it. He was coming nearer and nearer. In the
profound, tomb-like stillness of the great house, I had heard the
sound of his footsteps on the tessellated pavement from afar. Now
he had turned the corner, and the calm, strolling pace of his
approach was enough to strike awe into an adversary's heart. It
never hesitated, not once; never hurried; never slowed till it
stopped. He stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>I suppose, in that big room, by the light of two candles, I
must have presented an impressive picture of a menacing youth all
in black, with a tense face, and holding a naked, long rapier in
his hand. At any rate, he stood still, eyeing me from the
doorway, the picture of a dapper Spanish lawyer in a lofty frame;
all in black, also, with a fair head and a well-turned leg
advanced in a black silk stocking. He had taken off his riding
boots. For the rest, I had never seen him dressed otherwise.
There was no weapon in his hand, or at his side.</p>
<p>I lowered the point, and, seeing he remained on the doorstep,
as if not willing to trust himself within, I said
disdainfully:</p>
<p>"You don't suppose I would murder a defenceless man."</p>
<p>"Am I defenceless?" He had a slight lift of the eyebrows.
"That is news, indeed. It is you who are supposing. I have been a
very certain man for this many a year."</p>
<p>"How can you know how an English gentleman would feel and act?
I am neither a murderer nor yet an intriguer."</p>
<p>He walked right in rapidly, and, getting round to the other
side of the table, drew a small pistol out of his breeches
pocket.</p>
<p>"You see&mdash;I am not trusting too much to your English
generosity."</p>
<p>He laid the pistol negligently on the table. I had turned
about on my heels. As we stood, by lunging between the two
candlesticks, I should have been able to run him through the body
before he could cry out.</p>
<p>I laid the sword on the table.</p>
<p>"Would you trust a damned Irish rebel?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You are wrong in your surmise. I would have nothing to do
with a rebel, even in my thoughts and suppositions. I think that
the Intendente of Don Balthasar Riego would look twice before
murdering in a bedroom the guest of the house&mdash;a relation, a
friend of the family."</p>
<p>"That's sensible," he said, with that unalterable air of good
nature, which sometimes was like the most cruel mockery of
humour. "And do you think that even a relation of the Riegos
would escape the scaffold for killing Don Patricio O'Brien, one
of the Royal Judges of the Marine Court, member of the Council,
Procurator to the Chapter..."</p>
<p>"Intendente of the Casa," I threw in.</p>
<p>"That's my gratitude," he said gravely. "So you see..."</p>
<p>"Supreme chief of thieves and picaroons," I suggested
again.</p>
<p>He answered this by a gesture of disdainful superiority.</p>
<p>"I wonder if you&mdash;-if any of you English&mdash;would have
the courage to risk your all&mdash;ambition, pride, position,
wealth, peace of mind, your dearest hope, your
self-respect&mdash;like this. For an idea."</p>
<p>His tone, that revealed something exalted and sad behind
everything that was sordid and base in the acts of that man's
villainous tools, struck me with astonishment. I beheld, as an
inseparable whole, the contemptible result, the childishness of
his imagination, the danger of his recklessness, and something
like loftiness in his pitiful illusion.</p>
<p>"Nothing's too hot, too dirty, too heavy. Any way to get at
you English; any means. To strike! That's the thing. I would die
happy if I knew I had helped to detach from you one
island&mdash;one little island of all the earth you have filched
away, stolen, taken by force, got by lying... Don't taunt me with
your taunts of thieves. What weapons better worthy of you could I
use? Oh, I am modest. I am modest. This is a little thing, this
Jamaica. What do I care for the Separationist blatherskite more
than for the loyal fools? You are all English to me. If I had my
way, your Empire would die of pin-pricks all over its big,
overgrown body. Let only one bit drop off. If robbing your ships
may help it, then, as you see me standing here, I am ready to go
myself in a leaky boat. I tell you Jamaica's gone. And that may
be the beginning of the end."</p>
<p>He lifted his arm not at me, but at England, if I may judge
from his burning stare. It was not to me he was speaking. There
we were, Irish and English, face to face, as it had been ever
since we had met in the narrow way of the world that had never
been big enough for the tribes, the nations, the races of
man.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. O'Brien, I don't know what you may do to me, but I
won't listen to any of this," I said, very red in the face.</p>
<p>"Who wants you to listen?" he muttered absently, and went away
from the table to look out of the loophole, leaving me there with
the sword and the pistol.</p>
<p>Whatever he might have said of the scaffold, this was very
imprudent of him. It was characteristic of the man&mdash;of that
impulsiveness which existed in him side by side with his
sagacity, with his coolness in intrigue, with his unmerciful and
revengeful temper. By my own feelings I understood what an
imprudence it was. But he was turning his back on me, and how
could I?...His imprudence was so complete that it made for
security. He did not, I am sure, remember my existence. I would
just as soon have jumped with a dagger upon a man in the
dark.</p>
<p>He was really stirred to his depths&mdash;to the depths of his
hate, and of his love&mdash;by seeing me, an insignificant youth
(I was no more), surge up suddenly in his path. He turned where
he stood at last, and contemplated me with a sort of thoughtful
surprise, as though he had tried to account to himself for my
existence.</p>
<p>"No," he said, to himself really, "I wonder when I look at
you. How did you manage to get that pretty reputation over there?
Ramon's a fool. He shall know it to his cost. But the craftiness
of that Carlos! Or is it only my confounded willingness to
believe?"</p>
<p>He was putting his finger nearly on the very spot. I said
nothing.</p>
<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "when it's all boiled down, you are only
an English beggar boy."</p>
<p>"I've come to a man's estate since we met last," I said
meaningly.</p>
<p>He seemed to meditate over this. His face never changed,
except, perhaps, to an even more amused benignity of
expression.</p>
<p>"You have lived very fast by that account," he remarked
artlessly. "Is it possible now? Well, life, as you know, can't
last forever; and, indeed, taking a better look at you in this
poor light, you do seem to be very near death."</p>
<p>I did not flinch; and, with a very dry mouth, I uttered
defiantly:</p>
<p>"Such talk means nothing."</p>
<p>"Bravely said. But this is not talk. You've gone too fast. I
am giving you a chance to turn back."</p>
<p>"Not an inch," I said fiercely. "Neither in thought, in deed;
not even in semblance."</p>
<p>He seemed as though he wanted to swallow a bone in his
throat.</p>
<p>"Believe me, there is more in life than you think. There is at
your age, more than..." he had a strange contortion of the body,
as though in a sudden access of internal pain; that humorous
smile, that abode in the form of his lips, changed into a
ghastly, forced grin..."than one love in a life&mdash;more than
one woman."</p>
<p>I believe he tried to leer at me, because his voice was
absolutely dying in his throat. My indignation was boundless. I
cried out with the fire of deathless conviction:</p>
<p>"It is not true. You know it is not true."</p>
<p>He was speechless for a time; then, shaking and stammering
with that inward rage that seemed to heave like molten lava in
his breast, without ever coming to the surface of his face:</p>
<p>"What! Is it I, then, who have to go back? For&mdash;for
you&mdash;-a boy&mdash;come from devil knows where&mdash;an
English, beggarly...For a girl's whim... I&mdash;a man."</p>
<p>He calmed down. "No; you are mad. You are dreaming. You don't
know. You can't&mdash;you! You don't know what a man is; you with
your calf-love a day old. How dare you look at me who have
breathed for years in the very air? You fool&mdash;you little,
wretched fool! For years sleeping, and waking, and
working..."</p>
<p>"And intriguing," I broke in, "and plotting, and
deceiving&mdash;for years."</p>
<p>This calmed him altogether. "I am a man; you are but a boy; or
else I would not have to tell you that your love"&mdash;he choked
at the word&mdash;"is to mine like&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>
<p>His eyes fell on a cut-glass water-ewer, and, with a
convulsive sweep of his arm, he sent it flying far away from the
table. It fell heavily, shattering itself with the unringing thud
of a piece of ice. "Like this." He remained for some time with
his eyes fixed on the table, and when he looked up at me it was
with a sort of amused incredulity. His tone was not resentful. He
spoke in a business-like manner, a little contemptuously. I had
only Don Carlos to thank for the position in which I found
myself. What the "poor devil over there" expected from me, he,
O'Brien, would not inquire. It was a ridiculous boy-and-girl
affair. If those two&mdash;meaning Carlos and Seraphina&mdash;had
not been so mighty clever, I should have been safe now in Jamaica
jail, on a charge of treasonable practices. He seemed to find the
idea funny. Well, anyhow, he had meant no worse by me than my own
dear countrymen. When he, O'Brien, had found how absurdly he had
been hoodwinked by Don Carlos&mdash;the poor devil&mdash;and
misled by Ramon&mdash;he would make him smart for it,
yet&mdash;all he had intended to do was to lodge me in Havana
jail. On his word of honour...</p>
<p>"Me in jail!" I cried angrily. "You&mdash;you would dare! On
what charge? You could not..."</p>
<p>"You don't know what Pat O'Brien can do in Cuba."</p>
<p>The little country solicitor came out in a flash from under
the Spanish lawyer. Then he frowned slightly at me. "You being an
Englishman, I would have had you taken up on a charge of
stealing."</p>
<p>Blood rushed to my face. I lost control over myself. "Mr.
O'Brien," I said, "I dare say you could have trumped up anything
against me. You are a very great scoundrel."</p>
<p>"Why? Because I don't lie about my motives, as you all do? I
would wish you to know that I would scorn to lie either to myself
or to you."</p>
<p>I touched the haft of the sword on the table. It was lying
with the point his way.</p>
<p>"I had been thinking," said I, in great heat, "to propose to
you that we should fight it out between us two, man to man, rebel
and traitor as you have been."</p>
<p>"The devil you have!" he muttered.</p>
<p>"But really you are too much of a Picaroon. I think the
gallows should be your end."</p>
<p>I gave rein to my exasperation, because I felt myself
hopelessly in his power. What he was driving at, I could not
tell. I had an intolerable sense of being as much at his mercy as
though I had been lying bound hand and foot on the floor. It gave
me pleasure to tell him what I thought. And, perhaps, I was not
quite candid, either. Suppose I provoked him enough to fire his
pistol at me. He had been fingering the butt, absently, as we
talked. He might have missed me, and then...Or he might have shot
me dead. But surely there was some justice in Cuba. It was clear
enough that he did not wish to kill me himself. Well, this was a
desperate strait; to force him to do something he did not wish to
do, even at the cost of my own life, was the only step left open
to me to thwart his purpose; the only thing I could do just then
for the furtherance of my mission to save Seraphina from his
intrigues. I was oppressed by the misery of it all. As to killing
him as he stood&mdash;if I could do it by being very quick with
the old rapier&mdash;my bringing up, my ideas, my very being,
recoiled from it. I had never taken a life. I was very young. I
was not used to scenes of violence; and to begin like this in
cold blood! Not only my conscience, but my very courage faltered.
Truth to tell, I was afraid; not for myself&mdash;I had the
courage to die; but I was afraid of the act. It was the unknown
for me&mdash;for my nerve&mdash;for my conscience. And then the
Spanish gallows! That, too, revolted me. To kill him, and then
kill myself...No, I must live. "Two lives, one death," she had
said....For a second or two my brain reeled with horror; I was
certainly losing my self-possession. His voice broke upon that
nightmare.</p>
<p>"It may be your lot, yet," it said. I burst into a nervous
laugh. For a moment I could not stop myself.</p>
<p>"I won't murder you," I cried.</p>
<p>To this he said astonishingly, "Will you go to Mexico?"</p>
<p>It sounded like a joke. He was very serious. "I shall send one
of the schooners there on a little affair of mine. I can make use
of you. I give you this chance." It was as though he had thrown a
bucketful of water over me. I had an inward shiver, and became
quite cool. It was his turn now to let himself go.</p>
<p>It was a matter of delivering certain papers to the Spanish
commandant in Tamaulipas. There would be some employment found
for me with the Royal troops. I was a relation of the Riegos. And
there came upon his voice a strange ardour; a swiftness into his
utterance. He walked away from the table; came back, and gazed
into my face in a marked, expectant manner. He was not prompted
by any love for me, he said, and gave an uncertain laugh.</p>
<p>My wits had returned to me wholly; and as he repeated "No love
for you&mdash;no love for you," I had the intuition that what
influenced him was his love for Seraphina. I saw it. I read it in
the workings of his face. His eyes retained his good-humoured
twinkle. He did not attach any importance to a boy-and-girl
affair; not at all&mdash;pah! The lady, naturally young,
warmhearted, full of kindness. I mustn't think...Ha, ha! A man of
his age, of course, understood...No importance at all.</p>
<p>He walked away from the table trying to snap his fingers, and,
suddenly, he reeled; he reeled, as though he had been overcome by
the poison of his jealousy&mdash;as though a thought had stabbed
him to the heart. There was an instant when the sight of that man
moved me more than anything I had seen of passionate suffering
before (and that was nothing), or since. He longed to kill
me&mdash;I felt it in the very air of the room; and he loved her
too much to dare. He laughed at me across the table. I had
ridiculously misunderstood a very proper and natural kindness of
a girl with not much worldly experience. He had known her from
the earliest childhood.</p>
<p>"Take my word for it," he stammered.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there were tears in his eyes. A stiff
smile was parting his lips. He took up the pistol, and evidently
not knowing anything about it, looked with an air of curiosity
into the barrel.</p>
<p>It was time to think of making my career. That's what I ought
to be thinking of at my age. "At your age&mdash;at your age," he
repeated aimlessly. I was an Englishman. He hated me&mdash;and it
was easy to believe this, though he neither glared nor grimaced.
He smiled.</p>
<p>He smiled continuously and rather pitifully. But his devotion
to a&mdash;a&mdash;person who...His devotion was great enough to
overcome even that, even that. Did I understand? I owed it to the
lady's regard, which, for the rest, I had
misunderstood&mdash;stupidly misunderstood.</p>
<p>"Well, at your age it's excusable!" he mumbled. "A career
that..."</p>
<p>"I see," I said slowly. Young as I was, it was impossible to
mistake his motives. Only a man of mature years, and really
possessed by a great passion&mdash;by a passion that had grown
slowly, till it was exactly as big as his soul&mdash;could have
acted like this&mdash;with that profound simplicity, with such
resignation, with such horrible moderation&mdash;But I wanted to
find out more. "And when would you want me to go?" I asked, with
a dissimulation of which I would not have suspected myself
capable a moment before. I was maturing in the fire of love, of
danger; in the lurid light of life piercing through my youthful
innocence.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, banging the pistol on to the table hurriedly.
"At once. To-night. Now."</p>
<p>"Without seeing anybody?"</p>
<p>"Without seeing...Oh, of course. In your own interest."</p>
<p>He was very quiet now. "I thought you looked intelligent
enough," he said, appearing suddenly very tired. "I am glad you
see your position. You shall go far in the Royal service, on the
faith of Pat O'Brien, English as you are. I will make it my own
business for the sake of&mdash;the Riego family. There is only
one little condition."</p>
<p>He pulled out of his pocket a piece of paper, a pen, a
travelling inkstand. He looked the lawyer to the life; the
Spanish family lawyer grafted on an Irish attorney.</p>
<p>"You can't see anybody. But you ought to write. Dona Seraphina
naturally would be interested. A cousin and...I shall explain to
Don Balthasar, of course...I will dictate: 'Out of regard for
your future, and the desire for active life, of your own will,
you accept eagerly Se&ntilde;or O'Brien's proposition.' She'll
understand."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, she'll understand," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes. And that you will write of your safe arrival in
Tamaulipas. You must promise to write. Your word..."</p>
<p>"By heavens, Se&ntilde;or O'Brien!" I burst out with
inexpressible scorn, "I thought you meant your villains to cut my
throat on the passage. I should have deserved no better
fate."</p>
<p>He started. I shook with rage. A change had come upon both of
us as sudden as if we had been awakened by a violent noise. For a
time we did not speak a word. One look at me was enough for him.
He passed his hand over his forehead.</p>
<p>"What devil's in you, boy?" he said. "I seem to make nothing
but mistakes."</p>
<p>He went to the loophole window, and, advancing his head, cried
out:</p>
<p>"The schooner does not sail to-night."</p>
<p>He had some of his cut-throats posted under the window. I
could not make out the reply he got; but after a while he said
distinctly, so as to be heard below:</p>
<p>"I give up that spy to you." Then he came back, put the pistol
in his pocket, and said to me, "Fool! I'll make you long for
death yet."</p>
<p>"You've given yourself away pretty well," I said. "Some day I
shall unmask you. It will be my revenge on you for daring to
propose to me..."</p>
<p>"What?" he interrupted, over his shoulder. "You? Not
you&mdash;and I'll tell you why. It's because dead men tell no
tales."</p>
<p>He passed through the door&mdash;a back view of a dapper
Spanish lawyer, all in black, in a lofty frame. The calm,
strolling footsteps went away along the gallery. He turned the
corner. The tapping of his heels echoed in the <i>patio</i>, into
whose blackness filtered the first suggestion of the dawn.

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>I remember walking about the room, and thinking to myself,
"This is bad, this is very bad; what shall I do now?" A sort of
mad meditation that in this meaningless way became so tense as
positively to frighten me. Then it occurred to me that I could do
nothing whatever at present, and I was soothed by this sense of
powerless-ness, which, one would think, ought to have driven me
to distraction. I went to sleep ultimately, just as a man
sentenced to death goes to sleep, lulled in a sort of ghastly way
by the finality of his doom. Even when I awoke it kept me steady,
in a way. I washed, dressed, walked, ate, said "Good-morning,
Cesar," to the old major-domo I met in the gallery; exchanged
grins with the negro boys under the gateway, and watched the
mules being ridden out barebacked by other nearly naked negro
boys into the sea, with great splashing of water and a noise of
voices. A small knot of men, unmistakably __Lugare&ntilde;os__,
stood on the beach, also, watching the mules, and exchanging loud
jocular shouts with the blacks. Rio Medio, the dead, forsaken,
and desecrated city, was lying, as bare as a skeleton, on the
sands. They were yellow; the bay was very blue, the wooded hills
very green.</p>
<p>After the mules had been ridden uproariously back to the
stables, wet and capering, and shaking their long ears, all the
life of the land seemed to take refuge in this vivid colouring.
As I looked at it from the outer balcony above the great gate,
the small group of __Lugare&ntilde;os__ turned about to look at
the Casa Riego.</p>
<p>They recognized me, no doubt, and one of them flourished,
threateningly, an arm from under his cloak. I retreated
indoors.</p>
<p>This was the only menacing sign, absolutely the only sign that
marked this day. It was a day of pause. Seraphina did not leave
her apartments; Don Balthasar did not show himself; Father
Antonio, hurrying towards the sick room, greeted me with only a
wave of the hand. I was not admitted to see Carlos; the nun came
to the door, shook her head at me, and closed it gently in my
face. Castro, sitting on the floor not very far away, seemed
unaware of me in so marked a manner that it inspired me with the
idea of not taking the slightest notice of him. Now and then the
figure of a maid in white linen and bright petticoat flitted in
the upper gallery, and once I fancied I saw the black, rigid
carriage of the duenna disappearing behind a pillar.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or O'Brien, old Cesar whispered, without looking at
me, was extremely occupied in the <i>Canciller&iacute;a</i>. His
midday meal was served him there. I had mine all alone, and then
the sunny, heat-laden stillness of siesta-time fell upon the
Castilian dignity of the house.</p>
<p>I sank into a kind of reposeful belief in the work of
accident. Something would happen. I did not know how soon and how
atrociously my belief was to be justified. I exercised my
ingenuity in the most approved lover-fashion&mdash;in devising
means how to get secret speech with Seraphina. The confounded
silly maids fled from my most distant appearance, as though I had
the pest. I was wondering whether I should not go simply and
audaciously and knock at her door, when I fancied I heard a
scratching at mine. It was a very stealthy sound, quite capable
of awakening my dormant emotions.</p>
<p>I went to the door and listened. Then, opening it the merest
crack, I saw the inexplicable emptiness of the gallery. Castro,
on his hands and knees, startled me by whispering at my feet:</p>
<p>"Stand aside, Se&ntilde;or."</p>
<p>He entered my room on all-fours, and waited till I got the
door closed before he stood up.</p>
<p>"Even he may sleep sometimes," he said. "And the balustrade
has hidden me."</p>
<p>To see this little saturnine bandit, who generally stalked
about haughtily, as if the whole Casa belonged to him by right of
fidelity, crawl into my room like this was inexpressibly
startling. He shook the folds of his cloak, and dropped his hat
on the floor.</p>
<p>"Still, it is better so. The very women of the house are not
safe," he said. "Se&ntilde;or, I have no mind to be delivered to
the English for hanging. But I have not been admitted to see Don
Carlos, and, therefore, I must make my report to you. These are
Don Carlos' orders. 'Serve him, Castro, when I am dead, as if my
soul had passed into his body.'"</p>
<p>He nodded sadly. "<i>Si!</i> But Don Carlos is a friend to me
and you&mdash;you." He shook his head, and drew me away from the
door. "Two __Lugare&ntilde;os__," he said, "Manuel and another
one, did go last night, as directed by the friar"&mdash;he
supposed&mdash;"to meet the <i>Juez</i> in the bush outside Rio
Medio."</p>
<p>I had guessed that much, and told him of Manuel's behaviour
under my window. How did they know my chamber?</p>
<p>"Bad, bad," muttered Castro. "La Chica told her lover, no
doubt." He hissed, and stamped his foot.</p>
<p>She was pretty, but flighty. The lover was a silly boy of
decent, Christian parents, who was always hanging about in the
low villages. No matter.</p>
<p>What he could not understand was why some boats should have
been held in readiness till nearly the morning to tow a schooner
outside. Manuel came along at dawn, and dismissed the crews. They
had separated, making a great noise on the beach, and yelling,
"Death to the <i>Inglez!</i>"</p>
<p>I cleared up that point for him. He told me that O'Brien had
the duenna called to his room that morning. Nothing had been
heard outside, but the woman came out staggering, with her hand
on the wall. He had terrified her. God knows what he had said to
her. The widow&mdash;as Castro called her&mdash;had a son, an
<i>escrivano</i> in one of the Courts of Justice. No doubt it was
that.</p>
<p>"There it is, Se&ntilde;or," murmured Castro, scowling all
round, as if every wall of the room was an enemy. "He holds all
the people in his hand in some way. Even I must be cautious,
though I am a humble, trusted friend of the Casa!"</p>
<p>"What harm could he do you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"He is civil to me. <i>Amigo Castro</i> here, and <i>Amigo
Castro</i> there. Bah! The devil, alone, is his friend! He could
deliver me to justice, and get my life sworn away. He
could&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Quien sabe?</i> What need he care
what he does&mdash;a man that can get absolution from the
archbishop himself if he likes."</p>
<p>He meditated. "No! there is only one remedy for him." He
tiptoed to my ear. "The knife!"</p>
<p>He made a pass in the air with his blade, and I remembered
vividly the cockroach he had impaled with such accuracy on board
the <i>Thames</i>. His baneful glance reminded me of his
murderous capering in the steerage, when he had thought that the
only remedy for <i>me</i> was the knife.</p>
<p>He went to the loop-hole, and passed the steel thoughtfully on
the stone edge. I had not moved.</p>
<p>"The knife; but what would you have? Before, when I talked of
this to Don Carlos, he only laughed at me. That was his way in
matters of importance. Now they will not let me come in to him.
He is too near God&mdash;and the Se&ntilde;orita&mdash;why, she
is too near the saints for all the great nobility of her spirit.
But, <i>que dia-bleria</i>, when I&mdash;in my
devotion&mdash;opened my mouth to her I saw some of that spirit
in her eyes..."</p>
<p>There was a slight irony in his voice. "No! Me&mdash;Castro!
to be told that an English Se&ntilde;ora would have dismissed me
forever from her presence for such a hint. 'Your Excellency,' I
said, 'deign, then, to find it good that I should avoid giving
offence to that man. It is not my desire to run my neck into the
iron collar.'"</p>
<p>He looked at me fixedly, as if expecting me to make a sign,
then shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"<i>Bueno</i>. You see this? Then look to it yourself,
Se&ntilde;or. You are to me even as Don Carlos&mdash;all except
for the love. No English body is big enough to receive his soul.
No friend will be left that would risk his very honour of a noble
for a man like Tomas Castro. Let me warn you not to leave the
Casa, even if a shining angel stood outside the gate and called
you by name. The gate is barred, now, night and day. I have
dropped a hint to Cesar, and that old African knows more than the
Se&ntilde;or would suppose. I cannot tell how soon I may have the
opportunity to talk to you again."</p>
<p>He peeped through the crack of the door, then slipped out,
suddenly falling at once on his hands and knees, so as to be
hidden by the stone balustrade from anybody in the <i>patio</i>.
He, too, did not think himself safe.</p>
<p>Early in the evening I descended into the court, and Father
Antonio, walking up and down the <i>patio</i> with his eyes on
his breviary, muttered to me:</p>
<p>"Sit on this chair," and went on without stopping.</p>
<p>I took a chair near the marble rim of the basin with its
border of English flowers, its splashing thread of water. The
goldfishes that had been lying motionless, with their heads
pointing different ways, glided into a bunch to the fall of my
shadow, waiting for crumbs of bread.</p>
<p>Father Antonio, his head down, and the open breviary under his
nose, brushed my foot with the skirt of his cassock.</p>
<p>"Have you any plan?"</p>
<p>When he came back, walking very slowly, I said, "None."</p>
<p>At this next turn I pronounced rapidly, "I should like to see
Carlos."</p>
<p>He frowned over the edge of the book. I understood that he
refused to let me in. And, after all, why should I disturb that
dying man? The news about him was that he felt stronger that day.
But he was preparing for eternity. Father Antonio's business was
to save souls. I felt horribly crushed and alone. The priest
asked, hardly moving his lips: "What do you trust to?"</p>
<p>I had the time to meditate my reply. "Tell Carlos I think of
escape by sea."</p>
<p>He made a little sign of assent, turned off towards the
staircase, and went back to the sick room.</p>
<p>"The folly of it," I thought. How could I think of it? Escape
where? I dared not even show myself outside the Casa. My safety
within depended on old Cesar more than on anybody else. He had
the key of the gate, and the gate was practically the only thing
between me and a miserable death at the hands of the first
ruffian I met outside. And with the thought I seemed to stifle in
that <i>patio</i> open to the sky.</p>
<p>That gate seemed to cut off the breath of life from me. I was
there, as if in a trap. Should I&mdash;I asked myself&mdash;try
to enlighten Don Balthasar? Why not? He would understand me. I
would tell him that in his own town, as he always called Rio
Medio, there lurked assassination for his guest. That would move
him if anything could.</p>
<p>He was then walking with O'Brien after dinner, as he had
walked with me on the day of my arrival. Only Seraphina had not
appeared, and we three men had sat out the silent meal alone.</p>
<p>They stopped as I approached, and Don Balthasar listened to me
benignantly. "Ah, yes, yes! Times have changed." But there was no
reason for alarm. There were some undesirable persons. Had they
not arrived lately? He turned to O'Brien, who stood by, in
readiness to resume the walk, and answered, "Yes, quite lately.
Very undesirable," in a matter-of-fact tone. The excellent Don
Patricio would take measures to have them removed, the old man
soothed me. But it was not really dangerous for any one to go
out. Again he addressed O'Brien, who only smiled gently, as much
as to say, "What an absurdity!" I must not forget, continued the
old man, the veneration for the very name of Riego that still,
thank Heaven, survived in these godless and revolutionary times
in the Riegos' own town. He straightened his back a little,
looking at me with dignity, and then glanced at the other, who
inclined his head affirmatively. The utter and complete
hopelessness of the position appalled me for a moment. The old
man had not put foot outside his door for years, not even to go
to church. Father Antonio said Mass for him every day in the
little chapel next the dining room. When O'Brien&mdash;for his
own purposes, and the better to conceal his own connection with
the Rio Medio piracies&mdash;had persuaded him to go to Jamaica
officially, he had been rowed in state to the ship waiting
outside. For many years now it had been impossible to enlighten
him as to the true condition of affairs. He listened to people's
talk as though it had been children's prattle. I have related how
he received Carlos' denunciations. If one insisted, he would draw
himself up in displeasure. But in his decay he had preserved a
great dignity, a grave firmness that intimidated me a little.</p>
<p>I did not, of course, insist that evening, and, after giving
me my dismissal in a gesture of blessing, he resumed his
engrossing conversation with O'Brien. It related to the services
commemorating his wife's death, those services that, once every
twelve months, draped in black all the churches in Havana. A
hundred masses, no less, had to be said that day; a distribution
of alms had to be made. O'Brien was charged with all the
arrangements, and I caught, as they crept past me up and down the
<i>patio</i>, snatches of phrases relating to this mournful
function, when all the capital was invited to pray for the soul
of the illustrious lady. The priest of the church of San Antonio
had said this and that; the grand vicar of the diocese had made
difficulties about something; however, by the archbishop's
special grace, no less than three altars would be draped in the
cathedral.</p>
<p>I saw Don Balthasar smile with an ineffable satisfaction; he
thanked O'Brien for his zeal, and seemed to lean more familiarly
on his arm. His voice trembled with eagerness. "And now, my
excellent Don Patricio, as to the number of candles..."</p>
<p>I stood for a while as if rooted to the spot, overwhelmed by
my insignificance. O'Brien never once looked my way. Then,
hanging my head, I went slowly up the white staircase towards my
room.</p>
<p>Cesar, going his rounds along the gallery, shuffled his
silk-clad shanks smartly between two young negroes balancing
lanthorns suspended on the shafts of their halberds. That little
group had a mediaeval and outlandish aspect. Cesar carried a
bunch of keys in one hand, his staff of office in the other. He
stood aside, in his maroon velvet and gold lace, holding the
three-cornered hat under his arm, bowing his gray, woolly
head&mdash;the most venerable and deferential of majordomos. His
attendants, backing against the wall, grounded their halberds
heavily at my approach.</p>
<p>He stepped out to intercept me, and, with great discretion,
"Se&ntilde;or, a word," he said in his subdued voice. "A moment
ago I have been called within the door of our senorita's
apartments. She has given me this for your worship, together with
many compliments. It is a seal. The Se&ntilde;or will
understand."</p>
<p>I took it; it was a tiny seal with her monogram on it. "Yes,"
I said.</p>
<p>"And Se&ntilde;orita Dona Seraphina has charged me to
repeat"&mdash;he made a stealthy sign, as if to counteract an
evil influence&mdash;"the words, 'Two lives&mdash;one death.' The
Se&ntilde;or will understand."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, looking away with a pang at my heart. He
touched my elbow. "And to trust Cesar. Se&ntilde;or, I dandled
her when she was quite little. Let me most earnestly urge upon
your worship not to go near the windows, especially if there is
light in your worship's room. Evil men are gazing upon the house,
and I have seen myself the glint of a musket at the end of the
street. The moon grows fast, too. The senorita begs you to trust
Cesar."</p>
<p>"Are there many men?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Not many in sight; I have seen only one. But by signs, open
to a man of my experience, I suspect many more to be about."
Then, as I looked down on the ground, he added parenthetically,
"They are poor shots, one and all, lacking the very firmness of
manhood necessary to discharge a piece with a good aim. Still,
Se&ntilde;or, I am ordered to entreat you to be cautious. Strange
it is that to-night, from the great revelry at the Aldea Bajo,
one might think they had just visited an English ship
outside."</p>
<p>A ship! a ship! of any sort. But how to get out of the Casa?
Murder forbade me even as much as to look out of the windows. Was
there a ship outside? Cesar was positive there was not&mdash;not
since I had arrived. Besides, the empty sea itself was
unattainable, it seemed. I pressed the seal to my lips. "Tell the
senorita how I received her gift," I said; and the old negro
inclined his head lower still. "Tell her that as the letters of
her name are graved on this, so are all the words she has spoken
graven on my heart."</p>
<p>They went away busily, the lanthorns swinging about the
ax-heads of the halberds, Cesar's staff tapping the stones.</p>
<p>I shut my door, and buried my face in the pillows of the state
bed. My mental anguish was excessive; action, alone, could
relieve it. I had been battling with my thoughts like a man
fighting with shadows. I could see no issue to such a struggle,
and I prayed for something tangible to encounter&mdash;something
that one could overcome or go under to. I must have fallen
suddenly asleep, because there was a lion in front of me. It
lashed its tail, and beyond the indistinct agitation of the brute
I saw Seraphina. I tried to shout to her; no voice came out of my
throat. And the lion produced a strange noise; he opened his jaws
like a door. I sat up. It was like a change of dream. A glare
filled my eyes. In the wide doorway of my room, in a group of
attendants, I saw a figure in a short black cloak standing, hat
on head, and an arm outstretched. It was Don Balthasar. He held
himself more erect than I had ever seen him before. Stifled
sounds of weeping, a vast, confused rumour of lamentations,
running feet and flamming doors, came from behind him; his aged,
dry voice, much firmer and very distinct, was speaking to me.</p>
<p>"You are summoned to attend the bedside of Don Carlos Riego at
the hour of death, to help his soul struggling on the threshold
of eternity, with your prayers&mdash;as a kinsman and a
friend."</p>
<p>A great draught swayed the lights about that black and courtly
figure. All the windows and doors of the palace had been flung
open for the departure of the struggling soul. Don Balthasar
turned; the group of attendants was gone in a moment, with a
tramp of feet and jostling of lights in the long gallery.</p>
<p>I ran out after them. A wavering glare came from under the
arch, and, through the open gate, I saw the bulky shape of the
bishop's coach waiting outside in the moonlight. A strip of cloth
fell from step to step down the middle of the broad white stairs.
The staircase was brilliantly lighted, and quite empty. The
household was crowding the upper galleries; the sobbing murmurs
of their voices fell into the deserted <i>patio</i>. The strip of
crimson cloth laid for the bishop ran across it from the arch of
the stairway to the entrance.</p>
<p>The door of Carlos' room stood wide open; I saw the many
candles on a table covered with white linen, the side of the big
bed, surpliced figures moving within the room. There was the
ringing of small bells, and sighing groans from the kneeling
forms in the gallery through which I was making my way
slowly.</p>
<p>Castro appeared at my side suddenly. "Se&ntilde;or," he began,
with saturnine stoicism, "he is dead. I have seen
battlefields&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" His voice broke.</p>
<p>I saw, through the large portal of the death-chamber, Don
Balthasar and Seraphina standing at the foot of the bed; the
bowed heads of two priests; the bishop, a tiny old man, in his
vestments; and Father Antonio, burly and motionless, with his
chin in his hand, as if left behind after leading that soul to
the very gate of Eternity. All about me, women and men were
crossing themselves; and Castro, who for a moment had covered his
eyes with his hand, touched my elbow.</p>
<p>"And you live," he said, with sombre emphasis; then,
warningly, "You are in great danger now."</p>
<p>I looked around, as if expecting to see an uplifted knife. I
saw only a lot of people&mdash;household negroes and the
women&mdash;rising from their knees. Below, the <i>patio</i> was
empty.</p>
<p>"The house is defenceless," Castro continued. We heard
tumultuous voices under the gate. O'Brien appeared in the doorway
of Carlos' room with an attentive and dismayed expression on his
face. I do not really think he had anything to do with what then
took place. He meant to have me killed outside; but the rabble,
excited by Manuel's inflammatory speeches, had that night started
from the villages below with the intention of clamouring for my
life. Many of their women were with them. Some of the
__Lugare&ntilde;os__ carried torches, others had pikes; most of
them, however, had nothing but their long knives. They came in a
disorderly, shouting mob along the beach, intending this not for
an attack, but as a simple demonstration.</p>
<p>The sight of the open gate struck them with wonder. The
bishop's coach blocked the entrance, and for a time they
hesitated, awed by the mystery of the house and by the rites
going on in there. Then two or three bolder spirits stole closer.
The bishop's people, of course, did not think of offering any
resistance. The very defencelessness of the house restrained the
mob for a while. A few more men from outside ran in. Several
women began to clamour scoldingly to them to bring the
<i>Inglez</i> out. Then the men, encouraging each other in their
audacity, advanced further under the arch.</p>
<p>A solitary black, the only guard left at the gate, shouted at
them, "<i>Arria!</i> Go back!" It had no effect. More of them
crowded in, though, of course, the greater part of that mob
remained outside. The black rolled big eyes. He could not stop
them; he did not like to leave his post; he dared not fire. "Go
back! Go back!" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Not without the <i>Inglez</i>," they answered.</p>
<p>The tumult we had heard arose when the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>
suddenly fell upon the sentry, and wrenched his musket from
him.</p>
<p>This man, when disarmed, ran away. I saw him running across
the <i>patio</i>, on the crimson pathway, to the foot of the
staircase. His shouting, "The <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> have
risen!" broke upon the hush of mourning. Father Antonio made a
brusque movement, and Seraphina sent a startled glance in my
direction.</p>
<p>The cloistered court, with its marble basin and a jet of water
in the centre, remained empty for a moment after the negro had
run across; a growing clamour penetrated into it. In the midst of
it I heard O'Brien's voice saying, "Why don't they shut the
gate?" Immediately afterwards a woman in the gallery cried out in
surprise, and I saw the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> pour into the
<i>patio</i>.</p>
<p>For a time that motley group of bandits stood in the light, as
if intimidated by the great dignity of the house, by the
mysterious prestige of the Casa whose interior, probably, none of
them had ever seen before. They gazed about silently, as if
surprised to find themselves there.</p>
<p>It looked as if they would have retired if they had not caught
sight of me. A murmur of "the <i>Inglez</i>" arose at once. By
that time the household negroes had occupied the staircase with
what weapons they could find upstairs.</p>
<p>Father Antonio pushed past O'Brien out of the room, and shook
his arms over the balustrade.</p>
<p>"Impious men," he cried, "begone from this house of death."
His eyes flashed at the ruffians, who stared stupidly from
below.</p>
<p>"Give us the <i>Inglez</i>," they growled. Seraphina, from
within, cried, "Juan." I was then near the door, but not within
the room.</p>
<p>"The <i>Inglez!</i> The heretic! The traitor!" came in sullen,
subdued mutter. A hoarse, reckless voice shouted, "Give him to
us, and we shall go!"</p>
<p>"You are putting in danger all the lives in this house!"
O'Brien hissed at me. "Se&ntilde;orita, pray do not." He stood in
the way of Seraphina, who wished to come out.</p>
<p>"It is you!" she cried. "It is you! It is your voice, it is
your hand, it is your iniquity!"</p>
<p>He was confounded by her vehemence.</p>
<p>"Who brought him here?" he stammered. "Am I to find one of
that accursed brood forever in my way? I take him to witness that
for your sake&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>A formidable roar, "Throw us down the <i>Inglez!</i>" filled
the <i>patio</i>. They were gaining assurance down there; and the
ferocious clamouring of the mob outside came faintly upon our
ears.</p>
<p>O'Brien barred the way. Don Balthasar leaned on his daughter's
arm&mdash;she very straight, with tears still on her face and
indignation in her eye, he bowed, and with his immovable fine
features set in the calmness of age. Behind that group there were
two priests, one with a scared, white face, another,
black-browed, with an exalted and fanatical aspect. The light of
the candles from the improvised altar fell on the bishop's small,
bald head, emerging with a patient droop from the wide spread of
his cope, as though he had been inclosed in a portable gold
shrine. He was ready to go.</p>
<p>Don Balthasar, who seemed to have heard nothing, as if
suddenly waking up to his duty, left his daughter, and muttering
to O'Brien, "Let me precede the bishop," came out, bare-headed,
into the gallery. Father Antonio had turned away, and his heavy
hand fell on O'Brien's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Have you no heart, no reverence, no decency?" he said. "In
the name of everything you respect, I call upon you to stop this
sacrilegious outbreak."</p>
<p>O'Brien shook off the priestly hand, and fixed his eyes upon
Seraphina. I happened to be looking at his face; he seemed to be
ready to go out of his mind. His jealousy, the awful torment of
soul and body, made him motionless and speechless.</p>
<p>Seeing Don Balthasar appear by the balustrade, the ruffians
below had become silent for a while. His aged, mechanical voice
was heard asking distinctly:</p>
<p>"What do these people want?"</p>
<p>Seraphina, from within the room, said aloud, "They are
clamouring for the life of our guest." She looked at O'Brien
contemptuously, "They are doing this to please you."</p>
<p>"Before God, I have nothing to do with this."</p>
<p>It was true enough, he had nothing to do with this outbreak;
and I believe he would have interfered, but, in his dismay at
having lost himself in the eyes of Seraphina, in his rage against
myself, he did not know how to act. No doubt he had been
deceiving himself as to his position with Seraphina. He was a man
who in his wishes. His desire of revenge on me, the downfall of
his hopes (he could no longer deceive himself), a desperate
striving of thought for their regaining, his impulse towards the
impossible&mdash;all these emotions paralyzed his will.</p>
<p>Don Balthasar beckoned to me.</p>
<p>"Don't go near him," said O'Brien, in a thick, mumbling voice.
"I shall&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I must&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>I put him aside. Don Balthasar took my arm. "Misguided
populace," he whispered. "They have been a source of sorrow to me
lately. But this wicked folly is incredible. I shall call upon
them to come to their senses. My voice&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>The court below was strongly lighted, so that I saw the
bearded, bronzed, wild faces of the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>
looking up. We, also, were strongly shown by the light of the
doorway behind us, and by the torches burning in the gallery.</p>
<p>That morning, in my helplessness, I had come to put my trust
in accident&mdash;in some accident&mdash;I hardly knew of what
nature&mdash;my own death, perhaps&mdash;that would find a
solution for my responsibilities, put an end to my tormenting
thoughts. And now the accident came with a terrible swiftness, at
which I shudder to this day.</p>
<p>We were looking down into the <i>patio</i>. Don Balthasar had
just said, "You are nowhere as safe as by my side," when I
noticed a <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> withdrawing himself from the
throng about the basin. His face came to me familiarly. He was
the pirate with the broken nose, who had had a taste of my fist.
He had the sentry's musket on his shoulder, and was slinking away
towards the gate.</p>
<p>Don Balthasar extended his hand over the balustrade, and there
was a general movement of recoil below. I wondered why the slaves
on the stairs did not charge and clear the <i>patio</i>; but I
suppose with such a mob outside there was a natural hesitation in
bringing the position to an issue. The <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>
were muttering, "Look at the <i>Inglez!</i>" then cried out
together, "Excellency, give up this <i>Inglez!</i>"</p>
<p>Don Balthasar seemed ten years younger suddenly. I had never
seen him so imposingly erect.</p>
<p>"Insensate!" he began, without any anger.</p>
<p>"He is going to fire!" yelled Castro's voice somewhere in the
gallery.</p>
<p>I saw a red dart in the shadow of the gate. The broken-nosed
pirate had fired at me. The report, deadened in the vault, hardly
reached my ears. Don Balthazar's arm seemed to swing me back.
Then I felt him lean heavily on my shoulder. I did not know what
had happened till I heard him say:</p>
<p>"Pray for me, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Father Antonio received him in his arms.</p>
<p>For a second after the shot, the most dead silence prevailed
in the court. It was broken by an affrighted howl below: and
Seraphina's voice cried piercingly:</p>
<p>"Father!"</p>
<p>The priest, dropping on one knee, sustained the silvery head,
with its thin features already calm in death. Don Balthasar had
saved my life; and his daughter flung herself upon the body.
O'Brien pressed his hands to his temples, and remained
motionless.</p>
<p>I saw the bishop, in his stiff cope, creep up to the group
with the motion of a tortoise. And, for a moment, his quavering
voice pronouncing the absolution was the only sound in the
house.</p>
<p>Then a most fiendish noise broke out below. The negroes had
charged, and the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>, struck with terror at
the unforeseen catastrophe, were rushing helter-skelter through
the gate. The screaming of the maids was frightful. They ran up
and down the galleries with their hair streaming. O'Brien passed
me by swiftly, muttering like a madman.</p>
<p>I, also, got down into the courtyard in time to strike some
heavy blows under the gateway; but I don't know who it was that
thrust into my hands the musket which I used as a club. The
sudden burst of shrieks, the cries of terror under the vault of
the gate, yells of rage and consternation, silenced the mob
outside. The <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>, appalled at what had
happened, shouted most pitifully. They squeaked like the vermin
they were. I brought down the clubbed musket; two went down. Of
two I am sure. The rush of flying feet swept through between the
walls, bearing me along. For a time a black stream of men eddied
in the moonlight round the bishop's coach, like a torrent
breaking round a boulder. The great heavy machine rocked, mules
plunged, torches swayed.</p>
<p>The archway had been cleared. Outside, the slaves were forming
in the open space before the Casa, while Cesar, with a few
others, laboured to swing the heavy gates to. Hats, torn cloaks,
knives strewed the flagstones, and the dim light of the lamps,
fastened high up on the walls, fell on the faces of three men
stretched out on their backs. Another, lying huddled up in a
heap, got up suddenly and rushed out.</p>
<p>The thought of Seraphina clinging to the lifeless body of her
father upstairs came to me; it came over me in horror, and I let
the musket fall out of my hand. A silence like the silence of
despair reigned in the house. She would hate me now. I felt as if
I could walk out and give myself up, had it not been for the
sight of O'Brien.</p>
<p>He was leaning his shoulders against the wall in the posture
of a man suddenly overcome by a deadly disease. No one was
looking at us. It came to me that he could not have many
illusions left to him now. He looked up wearily, saw me, and,
waking up at once, thrust his hands into the pockets of his
breeches. I thought of his pistol. No wild hope of love would
prevent him, now, from killing me outright. The fatal shot that
had put an end to Don Balthasar's life must have brought to him
an awakening worse than death. I made one stride, caught him by
both arms swiftly, and pinned him to the wall with all my
strength. We struggled in silence.</p>
<p>I found him much more vigorous than I had expected; but, at
the same time, I felt at once that I was more than a match for
him. We did not say a word. We made no noise. But, in our
struggle, we got away from the wall into the middle of the
gateway I dared not let go of his arms to take him by the throat.
He only tried to jerk and wrench himself away. Had he succeeded,
it would have been death for me. We never moved our feet from the
spot, fairly in the middle of the archway but nearer to the gate
than to the <i>patio</i>. The slaves, formed outside, guarded the
bishop's coach, and I do not know that there was anybody else
actually with us under the vault of the entrance. We glared into
each other's faces, and the world seemed very still around us. I
felt in me a passion&mdash;not of hate, but of determination to
be done with him; and from his face it was impossible to guess
his suffering, his despair, or his rage.</p>
<p>In the midst of our straining I heard a sibilant sound. I
detached my eyes from his; his struggles redoubled, and, behind
him, stealing in towards us from the court, black on the strip of
crimson cloth, I saw Tomas Castro. He flung his cloak back. The
light of the lanthorn under the keystone of the arch glimmered
feebly on the blade of his maimed arm. He made a discreet and
bloodcurdling gesture to me with the other.</p>
<p>How could I hold a man so that he should be stabbed from
behind in my arms? Castro was running up swiftly, his cloak
opening like a pair of sable wings. Collecting all my strength, I
forced O'Brien round, and we swung about in a flash. Now he had
his back to the gate. My effort seemed to have uprooted him. I
felt him give way all over.</p>
<p>As soon as our position had changed, Castro checked himself,
and stepped aside into the shadow of the guardroom doorway. I
don't think O'Brien had been aware of what had been going on. His
strength was overborne by mine. I drove him backwards. His eyes
blinked wildly. He bared his teeth. He resisted, as though I had
been forcing him over the brink of perdition. His feet clung to
the flagstones. I shook him till his head rolled.</p>
<p>"Viper brood!" he spluttered.</p>
<p>"Out you go!" I hissed.</p>
<p>I had found nothing heroic, nothing romantic to
say&mdash;nothing that would express my desperate resolve to rid
the world of his presence. All I could do was to fling him out.
The Casa Riego was all my world&mdash;a World full of great pain,
great mourning, and love. I saw him pitch headlong under the
wheels of the bishop's enormous carriage. The black coachman who
had sat aloft, unmoved through all the tumult, in his white
stockings and three-cornered hat, glanced down from his high box.
And the two parts of the gate came together with a clang of
ironwork and a heavy crash that seemed as loud as thunder under
that vault. <a name="2HCH0018"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>
<p>Not even in memory am I willing to live over again those three
days when Father Antonio, the old major-domo, and myself would
meet each other in the galleries, in the <i>patio</i>, in the
empty rooms, moving in the stillness of the house with heavy
hearts and desolate eyes, which seemed to demand, "What is there
to do?"</p>
<p>Of course, precautions were taken against the
Lugare&ntilde;os. They were besieging the Casa from afar. They
had established a sort of camp at the end of the street, and they
prowled about amongst the old, barricaded houses in their pointed
hats, in their rags and finery; women, with food, passed
constantly between the villages and the panic-stricken town;
there were groups on the beach; and one of the schooners had been
towed down the bay, and was lying, now, moored stem and stern
opposite the great gate. They did nothing whatever active against
us. They lay around and watched, as if in pursuance of a plan
traced by a superior authority. They were watching for me. But
when, by some mischance, they burnt the roof off the outbuildings
that were at some distance from the Casa, their chiefs sent up a
deputation of three, with apologies. Those men came unarmed, and,
as it were, under Castro's protection, and absolutely whimpered
with regrets before Father Antonio. "Would his reverence kindly
intercede with the most noble senorita?..."</p>
<p>"Silence! Dare not pronounce her name!" thundered the good
priest, snatching away his hand, which they attempted to grab and
kiss.</p>
<p>I, in the background, noted their black looks at me even as
they cringed. The man who had fired the shot, they said, had
expired of his wounds after great torments. Their other dead had
been thrust out of the gate before. A long fellow, with slanting
eyebrows and a scar on his cheek, called El Rechado, tried to
inform Cesar, confidentially, that Manuel, his friend, had been
opposed to any encroachment of the Casa's offices, only: "That
Domingo&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>As soon as we discovered what was their object (their apparent
object, at any rate), they were pushed out of the gate
unceremoniously,&mdash;still protesting their love and
respect&mdash;by the Riego negroes. Castro followed them out
again, after exchanging a meaning look with Father Antonio. To
live in the two camps, as it were, was a triumph of Castro's
diplomacy, of his saturnine mysteriousness. He kept us in touch
with the outer world, coming in under all sorts of pretences,
mostly with messages from the bishop, or escorting the priests
that came in relays to pray by the bodies of the two last Riegos
lying in state, side by side, rigid in black velvet and white
lace ruffles, on the great bed dragged out into the middle of the
room.</p>
<p>Two enormous wax torches in iron stands flamed and guttered at
the door; a black cloth draped the emblazoned shields; and the
wind from the sea, blowing through the open casement, inclined
all together the flames of a hundred candles, pale in the
sunlight, extremely ardent in the night. The murmur of prayers
for these souls went on incessantly; I have it in my ears now.
There would be always some figure of the household kneeling in
prayer at the door; or the old major-domo would come in to stand
at the foot, motionless for a time; or, through the open door, I
would see the cassock of Father Antonio, flung on his knees, with
his forehead resting on the edge of the bed, his hands clasped
above his tonsure.</p>
<p>Apart from what was necessary for defence, all the life of the
house seemed stopped. Not a woman appeared; all the doors were
closed; and the numbing desolation of a great bereavement was
symbolized by Don Bal-thasar's chair in the <i>patio</i>, which
had remained lying overturned in full view of every part of the
house, till I could bear the sight no longer, and asked Cesar to
have it put away. "<i>Si, Se&ntilde;or</i>," he said
deferentially, and a few tears ran suddenly down his withered
cheeks. The English flowers had been trampled down; an unclean
hat floated on the basin, now here, now there, frightening the
goldfish from one side to the other.</p>
<p>And Seraphina. It seems not fitting that I should write of her
in these days. I hardly dared let my thoughts approach her, but I
had to think of her all the time. Her sorrow was the very soul of
the house.</p>
<p>Shortly after I had thrown O'Brien out the bishop had left,
and then I learned from Father Antonio that Seraphina had been
carried away to her own apartments in a fainting condition. The
excellent man was almost incoherent with distress and trouble of
mind, and walked up and down, his big head drooping on his
capacious chest, the joints of his entwined fingers cracking. I
had met him in the gallery, as I was making my way back to
Carlos' room in anxiety and fear, and we had stepped aside into a
large saloon, seldom used, above the gateway. I shall never
forget the restless, swift pacing of that burly figure, while,
feeling utterly crushed, now the excitement was over, I leaned
against a console. Three long bands of moonlight fell, chilly
bluish, into the vast room, with its French Empire furniture
stiffly arranged about the white walls.</p>
<p>"And that man?" he asked me at last.</p>
<p>"I could have killed him with my own hands," I said. "I was
the stronger. He had his pistols on him, I am certain, only I
could not be a party to an assassination..."</p>
<p>"Oh, my son, it would have been no sin to have exerted the
strength which God had blessed you with," he interrupted. "We are
allowed to kill venomous snakes, wild beasts; we are given our
strength for that, our intelligence..." And all the time he
walked about, wringing his hands.</p>
<p>"Yes, your reverence," I said, feeling the most miserable and
helpless of lovers on earth; "but there was no time. If I had not
thrown him out, Castro would have stabbed him in the back in my
very hands. And that would have been&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" Words
failed me.</p>
<p>I had been obliged not only to desist myself, but to save his
life from Castro. I had been obliged! There had been no option.
Murderous enemy as he was, it seemed to me I should never have
slept a wink all the rest of my life.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is just, it is just. What else? Alas!" Father Antonio
repeated disconnectedly. "Those feelings implanted in your
breast&mdash;&mdash;I have served my king, as you know, in my
sacred calling, but in the midst of war, which is the outcome of
the wickedness natural to our fallen state. I understand; I
understand. It may be that God, in his mercy, did not wish the
death of that evil man&mdash;not yet, perhaps. Let us submit. He
may repent." He snuffled aloud. "I think of that poor child," he
said through his handkerchief. Then, pressing my arm with his
vigorous fingers, he murmured, "I fear for her reason."</p>
<p>It may be imagined in what state I spent the rest of that
sleepless night. At times, the thought that I was the cause of
her bereavement nearly drove me mad.</p>
<p>And there was the danger, too.</p>
<p>But what else could I have done? My whole soul had recoiled
from the horrible help Castro was bringing us at the point of his
blade. No love could demand from me such a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Next day Father Antonio was calmer. To my trembling inquiries
he said something consolatory as to the blessed relief of tears.
When not praying fervently in the mortuary chamber, he could be
seen pacing the gallery in a severe aloofness of meditation. In
the evening he took me by the arm, and, without a word, led me up
a narrow and winding staircase. He pushed a small door, and we
stepped out on a flat part of the roof, flooded in moonlight.</p>
<p>The points of land dark with the shadows of trees and broken
ground clasped the waters of the bay, with a body of shining
white mists in the centre; and, beyond, the vast level of the
open sea, touched with glitter, appeared infinitely sombre under
the luminous sky.</p>
<p>We stood back from the parapet, and Father Antonio threw out a
thick arm at the splendid trail of the moon upon the dark
water.</p>
<p>"This is the only way," he said.</p>
<p>He had a warm heart under his black robe, a simple and
courageous comprehension of life, this priest who was very much
of a man; a certain grandeur of resolution when it was a matter
of what he regarded as his principal office.</p>
<p>"This is the way," he repeated.</p>
<p>Never before had I been struck so much by the gloom, the
vastness, the emptiness of the open sea, as on that moonlight
night. And Father Antonio's deep voice went on:</p>
<p>"My son, since God has made use of the nobility of your heart
to save that sinner from an unshriven
death&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He paused to mutter, "Inscrutable! inscrutable!" to himself,
sighed, and then:</p>
<p>"Let us rejoice," he continued, with a completely unconcealed
resignation, "that you have been the chosen instrument to afford
him an opportunity to repent."</p>
<p>His tone changed suddenly.</p>
<p>"He will never repent," he said with great force. "He has sold
his soul and body to the devil, like those magicians of old of
whom we have records."</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue with compunction, and regretted his want
of charity. It was proper for me, however, as a man having to
deal with a world of wickedness and error, to act as though I did
not believe in his repentance.</p>
<p>"The hardness of the human heart is incredible; I have seen
the most appalling examples." And the priest meditated. "He is
not a common criminal, however," he added profoundly.</p>
<p>It was true. He was a man of illusions, ministering to
passions that uplifted him above the fear of consequences, Young
as I was, I understood that, too. There was no safety for us in
Cuba while he lived. Father Antonio nodded dismally.</p>
<p>"Where to go?" I asked. "Where to turn? Whom can we trust? In
whom can we repose the slightest confidence? Where can we look
for hope?"</p>
<p>Again the <i>padre</i> pointed to the sea. The hopeless aspect
of its moonlit and darkling calm struck me so forcibly that I did
not even ask how he proposed to get us out there. I only made a
gesture of discouragement. Outside the Casa, my life was not
worth ten minutes' purchase. And how could I risk her there? How
could I propose to her to follow me to an almost certain death?
What could be the issue of such an adventure? How could we hope
to devise such secret means of getting away as would prevent the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> pursuing us? I should perish, then, and
she...</p>
<p>Father Antonio seemed to lose his self-control suddenly.</p>
<p>"Yes," he cried. "The sea is a perfidious element, but what is
it to the blind malevolence of men?" He gripped my shoulder. "The
risk to her life," he cried; "the risk of drowning, of hunger, of
thirst&mdash;that is all the sea can do. I do not think of that.
I love her too much. She is my very own spiritual child; and I
tell you, Se&ntilde;or, that the unholy intrigue of that man
endangers not her happiness, not her fortune alone&mdash;it
endangers her innocent soul itself."</p>
<p>A profound silence ensued. I remembered that his business was
to save souls. This old man loved that young girl whom he had
watched growing up, defenceless in her own home; he loved her
with a great strength of paternal instinct that no vow of
celibacy can extinguish, and with a heroic sense of his priestly
duty. And I was not to say him nay. The sea&mdash;so be it. It
was easier to think of her dead than to think of her immured; it
was better that she should be the victim of the sea than of evil
men; that she should be lost with me than to me.</p>
<p>Father Antonio, with that na&iuml;ve sense of the poetry of
the sky he possessed, apostrophized the moon, the "gentle orb,"
as he called it, which ought to be weary of looking at the
miseries of the earth. His immense shadow on the leads seemed to
fling two vast fists over the parapet, as if to strike at the
enemies below, and without discussing any specific plan we
descended. It was understood that Seraphina and I should try to
escape&mdash;I won't say by sea, but to the sea. At best, to ask
the charitable help of some passing ship, at worst to go out of
the world together.</p>
<p>I had her confidence. I will not tell of my interview with
her; but I shall never forget my sensations of awe, as if
entering a temple, the melancholy and soothing intimacy of our
meeting, the dimly lit loftiness of the room, the vague form of
La Chica in the background, and the frail, girlish figure in
black with a very pale, delicate face. Father Antonio was the
only other person present, and chided her for giving way to
grief. "It is like rebellion&mdash;like rebellion," he denounced,
turning away his head to wipe a tear hastily; and I wondered and
thanked God that I should be a comfort to that tender young girl,
whose lot on earth had been difficult, whose sorrow was great but
could not overwhelm her indomitable spirit, which held a promise
of sweetness and love.</p>
<p>Her courage was manifest to me in the gentle and sad tones of
her voice. I made her sit in a vast armchair of tapestry, in
which she looked lost like a little child, and I took a stool at
her feet. This is an unforgettable hour in my life in which not a
word of love was spoken, which is not to be written of. The burly
shadow of the priest lay motionless from the window right across
the room; the flickering flame of a silver lamp made an unsteady
white circle of light on the lofty ceiling above her head. A
clock was beating gravely somewhere in the distant gloom, like
the unperturbed heart of that silence, in which our understanding
of each other was growing, even into a strength fit to withstand
every tempest.</p>
<p>"Escape by the sea," I said aloud. "It would be, at least,
like two lovers leaping hand in hand off a high rock, and nothing
else."</p>
<p>Father Antonio's bass voice spoke behind us.</p>
<p>"It is better to jeopardize the sinful body that returns to
the dust of which it is made than the redeemed soul, whose awful
lot is eternity. Reflect."</p>
<p>Seraphina hung her head, but her hand did not tremble in
mine.</p>
<p>"My daughter," the old man continued, "you have to confide
your fate to a noble youth of elevated sentiments, and of a truly
chivalrous heart..."</p>
<p>"I trust him," said Seraphina.</p>
<p>And, as I heard her say this, it seemed really to me as if, in
very truth, my sentiments were noble and my heart chivalrous.
Such is the power of a girl's voice. The door closed on us, and I
felt very humble.</p>
<p>But in the gallery Father Antonio leaned heavily on my
shoulder.</p>
<p>"I shall be a lonely old man," he whispered faintly. "After
all these years! Two great nobles; the end of a great
house&mdash;a child I had seen grow up...But I am less afraid for
her now."</p>
<p>I shall not relate all the plans we made and rejected.
Everything seemed impossible. We knew from Castro that O'Brien
had gone to Havana, either to take the news of Don Balthasar's
death himself, or else to prevent the news spreading there too
soon. Whatever his motive for leaving Rio Medio, he had left
orders that the house should be respected under the most awful
penalties, and that it should be watched so that no one left it.
The Englishman was to be killed at sight. Not a hair on anybody
else's head was to be touched.</p>
<p>To escape seemed impossible; then on the third day the thing
came to pass. The way was found. Castro, who served me as if
Carlos' soul had passed into my body, but looked at me with a
saturnine disdain, had arranged it all with Father Antonio.</p>
<p>It was the day of the burial of Carlos and Don Balthasar. That
same day Castro had heard that a ship had been seen becalmed a
long way out to sea. It was a great opportunity; and the funeral
procession would give the occasion for my escape. There was in
Rio Medio, as in all Spanish towns amongst the respectable part
of the population, a confraternity for burying the dead, "The
Brothers of Pity," who, clothed in black robes and cowls, with
only two holes for the eyes, carried the dead to their
resting-place, unrecognizable and unrecognized in that pious
work. A "Brother of Pity" dress would be brought for me into
Father Antonio's room. Castro was confident as to his ability of
getting a boat. It would be a very small and dangerous one, but
what would I have, if I neither killed my enemy, nor let any one
else kill him for me, he commented with sombre sarcasm.</p>
<p>A truce of God had been called, and the burial was to take
place in the evening when the mortal remains of the last of the
Riegos would be laid in the vault of the cathedral of what had
been known as their own province, and had, in fact, been so for a
time under a grant from Charles V.</p>
<p>Early in the day I had a short interview with Seraphina. She
was resolute. Then, long before dark, I slipped into Father
Antonio's room, where I was to stay until the moment to come out
and mingle with the throng of other Brothers of Pity. Once with
the bodies in the crypt of the cathedral, I was to await
Seraphina there, and, together, we should slip through a side
door on to the shore. Cesar, to throw any observer off the scent
(three <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> were to be admitted to see the
bodies put in their coffins), posted two of the Riego negroes
with loaded muskets on guard before the door of my empty room, as
if to protect me.</p>
<p>Then, just as dusk fell, Father Antonio, who had been praying
silently in a corner, got up, blew his nose, sighed, and suddenly
enfolded me in his powerful arms for an instant.</p>
<p>"I am an old man&mdash;a poor priest," he whispered jerkily
into my ear, "and the sea is very perfidious. And yet it favours
the sons of your nation. But, remember&mdash;the child has no one
but you. Spare her."</p>
<p>He went off; stopped. "Inscrutable! inscrutable!" he murmured,
lifting upwards his eyes. He raised his hand with a solemn
slowness. "An old man's blessing can do no harm," he said humbly.
I bowed my head. My heart was too full for speech, and the door
closed. I never saw him again, except later on in his surplice
for a moment at the gate, his great bass voice distinct in the
chanting of the priests conducting the bodies.</p>
<p>The <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> would respect the truce arranged
by the bishop.</p>
<p>No man of them but the three had entered the Casa. Already,
early in the night, their black-haired women, with coarse faces
and melancholy eyes, were kneeling in rows under the black
<i>mantillas</i> on the stone floor of the cathedral, praying for
the repose of the soul of Seraphina's father, of that old man who
had lived among them, unapproachable, almost invisible, and as if
infinitely removed. They had venerated him, and many of them had
never set eyes on his person.</p>
<p>It strikes me, now, as strange and significant of a mysterious
human need, the need to look upwards towards a superiority
inexpressibly remote, the need of something to idealize in life.
They had only that and, maybe, a sort of love as idealized and as
personal for the mother of God, whom, also, they had never seen,
to whom they trusted to save them from a devil as real. And they
had, moreover, a fear even more real of O'Brien.</p>
<p>And, when one comes to think of it, in putting on the long
spectacled robe of a Brother of Pity, in walking before the
staggering bearers of the great coffin with a tall crucifix in my
hand, in thus taking advantage of their truce of God, I was,
also, taking advantage of what was undoubtedly their
honour&mdash;a thing that handicapped them quite as much as had
mine when I found myself unable to strike down O'Brien. At that
time, I was a great deal too excited to consider this, however. I
had many things to think of, and the immense necessity of keeping
a cool head.</p>
<p>It was, after all, Tomas Castro to whom all the credit of the
thing belonged. Just after it had fallen very dark, he brought me
the black robes, a pair of heavy pistols to gird on under them,
and the heavy staff topped by a crucifix. He had an air of
sarcastic protest in the dim light of my room, and he explained
with exaggeratedly plain words precisely what I was to
do&mdash;which, as a matter of fact, was neither more nor less
than merely following in his own footsteps.</p>
<p>"And, oh, Se&ntilde;or," he said sardonically, "if you desire
again to pillow your head upon the breast of your mother; if you
would again see your sister, who, alas! by bewitching my Carlos,
is at the heart of all our troubles; if you desire again to see
that dismal land of yours, which politeness forbids me to curse,
I would beg of you not to let the mad fury of your nation break
loose in the midst of these thieves and scoundrels."</p>
<p>He peered intently into the spectacled eyeholes of my cowl,
and laid his hand on his sword-hilt. His small figure, tightly
clothed in black velvet from chin to knee, swayed gently
backwards and forwards in the light of the dim candle, and his
grotesque shadow flitted over the ghostly walls of the great
room. He stood gazing silently for a minute, then turned smartly
on his heels, and, with a gesture of sardonic respect, threw open
the door for me.</p>
<p>"Pray, Se&ntilde;or," he said, "that the moon may not rise too
soon."</p>
<p>We went swiftly down the colonnades for the last time, in the
pitch darkness and into the blackness of the vast archway. The
clumping staff of my heavy crucifix drew hollow echoes from the
flagstones. In the deep sort of cave behind us, lit by a dim
lanthorn, the negroes waited to unbar the doors. Castro himself
began to mutter over his beads. Suddenly he said:</p>
<p>"It is the last time I shall stand here. Now, there is not any
more a place for me on the earth."</p>
<p>Great flashes of light began to make suddenly visible the tall
pillars of the immense mournful palace, and after a long time,
absolutely without a sound, save the sputter of enormous torches,
an incredibly ghostly body of figures, black-robed from head to
foot, with large eyeholes peering fantastically, swayed into the
great arch of the hall. Above them was the enormous black coffin.
It was a sight so appalling and unexpected that I stood gazing at
them without any power to move, until I remembered that I, too,
was such a figure. And then, with an ejaculation of impatience,
Tomas Castro caught at my hand, and whirled me round.</p>
<p>The great doors had swung noiselessly open, and the black
night, bespangled with little flames, was framed in front of me.
He suddenly unsheathed his portentous sword, and, hanging his
great hat upon his maimed arm, stalked, a pathetic and sinister
figure of grief, down the great steps. I followed him in the
vivid and extraordinary compulsion of the sinister body that,
like one fabulous and enormous monster, swayed impenetrably after
me.</p>
<p>My heart beat till my head was in a tumultuous whirl, when
thus, at last, I stepped out of that house&mdash;but I suppose my
grim robes cloaked my emotions&mdash;though, seeing very clearly
through the eyeholes, it was almost incredible to me that I was
not myself seen. But these Brothers of Pity were a secret
society, known to no man except their spiritual head, who chose
them in turn, and not knowing even each other. Their good deeds
of charity were, in that way, done by pure stealth. And it
happened that their spiritual director was the Father Antonio
himself. At that foot of the palace steps, drawn back out of our
way, stood the great glass coach of state, containing, even then,
the woman who was all the world to me, invisible to me,
unattainable to me, not to be comforted by me, even as her great
griefs were to me invisible and unassuageable. And there between
us, in the great coffin, held on high by the grim, shadowy
beings, was all that she loved, invisible, unattainable, too, and
beyond all human comfort. Standing there, in the midst of the
whispering, bare-headed, kneeling, and villainous crowd, I had a
vivid vision of her pale, dim, pitiful face. Ah, poor thing! she
was going away for good from all that state, from all that
seclusion, from all that peace, mutely, and with a noble pride of
quietness, into a world of dangers, with no head but mine to
think for her, no arm but mine to ward off all the great terrors,
the immense and dangerous weight of a new world.</p>
<p>In the twinkle of innumerable candles, the priceless harness
of the white mules, waiting to draw the great coach after us,
shone like streaks of ore in an infinitely rich silver mine. A
double line of tapers kept the road to the cathedral, and a crowd
of our negroes, the bell muzzles of their guns suggested in the
twinkling light, massed themselves round the coach. Outside the
lines were the crowd of rapscallions in red jackets, their women
and children&mdash;all the population of the Aldea Bajo,
groaning. The whole crowd got into motion round us, the white
mules plunging frantically, the coach swaying. Ahead of me
inarched the sardonic, gallantly grotesque figure of true Tomas,
his sword point up, his motions always jaunty. Ahead of him,
again, were the white robes of many priests, a cluster of tall
candles, a great jewelled cross, and a tall saint's figure
swaying, more than shoulder high, and disappearing up above into
the darkness. For me, under my cowl, it was suffocatingly hot;
but I seemed to move forward, following, swept along without any
volition of my own. It appeared an immensely long journey; and
then, as we went at last up the cathedral steps, a voice cried
harshly, "Death to the heretic!" My heart stood still. I clutched
frantically at the handle of a pistol that I could not disengage
from folds of black cloth. But, as a matter of fact, the cry was
purely a general one; I was supposed to be shut up in the palace
still.</p>
<p>The sudden glow, the hush, the warm breath of incense, and the
blaze of light turned me suddenly faint; my ears buzzed, and I
heard strange sounds.</p>
<p>The cathedral was a mass of heads. Everyone in Rio Medio was
present, or came trooping in behind us. The better class was
clustered near the blaze of gilding, mottled marble, wax flowers,
and black and purple drapery that vaulted over the two black
coffins in the choir. Down in the unlit body of the church the
riff-raff of O'Brien kept the doors.</p>
<p>I followed the silent figure of Tomas Castro to the bishop's
own stall, right up in the choir, and we became hidden from the
rest by the forest of candles round the catafalque. Up the centre
of the great church, and high over the heads of the kneeling
people, came the great coffin, swaying, its bearers robbed of
half their grimness by the blaze of lights. Tomas Castro suddenly
caught at my sleeve whilst they were letting the coffin down on
to the bier. He drew me unnoticed into the shadow behind the
bishop's stall. In the swift transit, I had a momentary glance of
a small, black figure, infinitely tiny in that quiet place, and
infinitely solitary, veiled in black from head to foot, coming
alone up the centre of the nave.</p>
<p>I stood hidden there beside the bishop's stall for a long
time, and then suddenly I saw the black figure alone in the
gallery, looking down upon me&mdash;from the <i>loggia</i> of the
Riegos. I felt suddenly an immense calm; she was looking at me
with unseeing eyes, but I knew and felt that she would follow me
now to the end of the world. I had no more any doubts as to the
issue of our enterprise; it was open to no unsuccess with a
figure so steadfast engaged in it; it was impossible that blind
fate should be insensible to her charm, impossible that any man
could strike at or thwart her.</p>
<p>Monks began to sing; a great brass instrument grunted
lamentably; in the body of the building there was silence. The
bishop and his supporters moved about, as if aimlessly, in front
of the altar; the chains of the gold censors clicked ceaselessly.
Seraphina's head had sunk forward out of my sight. All the heads
of the cathedral bowed down, and suddenly, from round the side of
the stall, a hand touched mine, and a voice said, "It is time."
Very softly, as if it were part of the rite, I was drawn round
the stall through a door in the side of the screen. As we went
out, in his turnings, the old bishop gave us the benediction.
Then the door closed on the glory of his robes, and in a minute,
in the darkness we were rustling down a circular narrow staircase
into the dimness of a crypt, lit by the little blue flame of an
oil lamp. From above came sounds like thunder, immense,
vibrating; we were immediately under the choir. Through the
cracks round a large stone showed a parallelogram of light.</p>
<p>In the dimness I had a glimpse of the face of my
conductor&mdash;a thin, wonderfully hollow-cheeked lay brother.
He began, with great gentleness, to assist me out of my black
robes, and then he said:</p>
<p>"The senorita will be here very soon with the Se&ntilde;or
Tomas," and then added, with an infinitely sad and tender, dim
smile:</p>
<p>"Will not the Se&ntilde;or Caballero, if it is not repugnant,
say a prayer for the repose of..." He pointed gently upwards to
the great flagstone above which was the coffin of Don Balthasar
and Carlos. The priest himself was one of those very holy, very
touching&mdash;-perhaps, very stupid&mdash;men that one finds in
such places. With his dim, wistful face he is very present in my
memory. He added: "And that the good God of us all may keep it in
the Se&ntilde;or Caballero's heart to care well for the soul of
the dear senorita."</p>
<p>"I am a very old man," he whispered, after a pause. He was
indeed an old man, quite worn out, quite without hope on earth.
"I have loved the senorita since she was a child. The
Se&ntilde;or Caballero takes her from us. I would have him
pray&mdash;to be made worthy."</p>
<p>Whilst I was doing it, the place began to be alive with
whispers of garments, of hushed footsteps, a small exclamation in
a gruff voice. Then the stone above moved out of its place, and a
blaze of light fell down from the choir above.</p>
<p>I saw beside me Seraphina's face, brilliantly lit, looking
upwards. Tomas Castro said:</p>
<p>"Come quickly...come quickly...the prayers are ending; there
will be people in the street." And from above an enormous voice
intoned:</p>
<p>"<i>Tu.. u.. ba mi.. i.. i..rum...</i>" And the serpent
groaned discordantly. The end of a great box covered with black
velvet glided forward above our heads; ropes were fastened round
it. The priest had opened a door in the shadowy distance, beside
a white marble tablet in the thick walls. The coffin up above
moved forward a little again; the ropes were readjusted with a
rattling, wooden sound. A dry, formal voice intoned from
above:</p>
<p>"<i>&Egrave;rit...Justus Ab auditione...</i>"</p>
<p>From the open door the priest rattled his keys, and said,
"Come, come," impatiently.</p>
<p>I was horribly afraid that Seraphina would shriek or faint, or
refuse to move. There was very little time. The pirates might
stream out of the front of the cathedral as we came from the
back; the bishop had promised to accentuate the length of the
service. But Seraphina glided towards the open door; a breath of
fresh air reached us. She looked back once. The coffin was
swinging right over the hole, shutting out the light. Tomas
Castro took her hand and said, "Come...come," with infinite
tenderness.</p>
<p>He had been sobbing convulsedly. We went up some steps, and
the door shut behind us with a sound like a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>We walked fast, in perfect blackness and solitude, on the
deserted beach between the old town and the village. Every soul
was near the cathedral. A boat lay half afloat. To the left in
the distance the light of the schooner opposite the Casa Riego
wavered on the still water.</p>
<p>Suddenly Tomas Castro said:</p>
<p>"The senorita never before set foot to the open ground."</p>
<p>At once I lifted her into the boat. "Shove off, Tomas," I
said, with a beating heart. <a name="2H_PART4">

<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<p>There was a slight, almost imperceptible jar, a faint grating
noise, a whispering sound of sand&mdash;and the boat, without a
splash, floated.</p>
<p>The earth, slipping as it were away from under the keel, left
us borne upon the waters of the bay, which were as still as the
windless night itself. The pushing off of that boat was like a
launching into space, as a bird opens its wings on the brow of a
cliff, and remains poised in the air. A sense of freedom came to
me, the unreasonable feeling of exultation&mdash;as if I had been
really a bird essaying its flight for the first time. Everything,
sudden and evil and most fortunate, had been arranged for me, as
though I had been a lay figure on which Romance had been wreaking
its bewildering unexpectedness; but with the floating clear of
the boat, I felt somehow that this escape I had to manage
myself.</p>
<p>It was dark. Dipping cautiously the blade of the oar, I gave
another push against the shelving shore. Seraphina sat, cloaked
and motionless, and Tomas Castro, in the bows, made no sound. I
didn't even hear him breathe. Everything was left to me. The
boat, impelled afresh, made a slight ripple, and my elation was
replaced in a moment by all the torments of the most acute
anxiety.</p>
<p>I gave another push, and then lost the bottom. Success
depended upon my resource, readiness, and courage. And what was
this success? Immediately, it meant getting out of the bay, and
into the open sea in a twelve-foot dinghy looted from some ship
years ago by the Rio Medio pirates, if that miserable population
of sordid and ragged outcasts of the Antilles deserved such a
romantic name. They were sea-thieves.</p>
<p>Already the wooded shoulder of a mountain was thrown out
intensely black by the glow in the sky behind. The moon was about
to rise. A great anguish took my heart as if in a vice. The
stillness of the dark shore struck me as unnatural. I imagined
the yell of the discovery breaking it, and the fancy caused me a
greater emotion than the thing itself, I flatter myself, could
possibly have done. The unusual silence in which, through the
open portals, the altar of the cathedral alone blazed with many
flames upon the bay, seemed to enter my very heart violently,
like a sudden access of anguish. The two in the boat with me were
silent, too. I could not bear it.</p>
<p>"Seraphina," I murmured, and heard a stifled sob.</p>
<p>"It is time to take the oars, Se&ntilde;or," whispered Castro
suddenly, as though he had fallen asleep as soon as he had
scrambled into the bows, and only had awaked that instant. "The
mists in the middle of the bay will hide us when the moon
rises."</p>
<p>It was time&mdash;if we were to escape. Escape where? Into the
open sea? With that silent, sorrowing girl by my side! In this
miserable cockleshell, and without any refuge open to us? It was
not really a hesitation; she could not be left at the mercy of
O'Brien. It was as though I had for the first time perceived how
vast the world was; how dangerous; how unsafe. And there was no
alternative. There could be no going back.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if I had known what was before us, my heart would
have failed me utterly out of sheer pity. Suddenly my eyes caught
sight of the moon making like the glow of a bush fire on the
black slope of the mountain. In a moment it would flood the bay
with light, and the schooner anchored off the beach before the
Casa Riego was not eighty yards away. I dipped my oar without a
splash. Castro pulled with his one hand.</p>
<p>The mists rising on the lowlands never filled the bay, and I
could see them lying in moonlight across the outlet like a
silvery white ghost of a wall. We penetrated it, and instantly
became lost to view from the shore.</p>
<p>Castro, pulling quickly, turned his head, and grunted at a red
blur very low in the mist. A fire was burning on the low point of
land where Nichols&mdash;the Nova Scotian&mdash;had planted the
battery which had worked such havoc with Admiral Rowley's boats.
It was a mere earthwork and some of the guns had been removed.
The fire, however, warned us that there were some people on the
point. We ceased rowing for a moment, and Castro explained to me
that a fire was always lit when any of these thieves' boats were
stirring. There would be three or four men to keep it up. On this
very night Manuel-del-Popolo was outside with a good many
rowboats, waiting on the <i>Indiaman</i>. The ship had been seen
nearing the shore since noon. She was becalmed now. Perhaps they
were looting her already.</p>
<p>This fact had so far favoured our escape. There had been no
strollers on the beach that night. Since the investment of the
Casa Riego, Castro had lived amongst the besiegers on his
prestige of a superior person, of a <i>caballero</i> skilled in
war and diplomacy. No one knew how much the tubby, saturnine
little man was in the confidence of the Juez O'Brien; and there
was no doubt that he was a good Catholic. He was a very grave, a
very silent <i>caballero</i>. In reality his heart had been
broken by the death of Carlos, and he did not care what happened
to him. His action was actuated by his scorn and hate of the Rio
Medio population, rather than by any friendly feeling towards
myself.</p>
<p>On that night Domingo's partisans were watching the Casa
Riego, while Manuel (who was more of a seaman) had taken most of
his personal friends, and all the larger boats that would float,
to do a bit of "outside work," as they called it, upon the
becalmed West Indiaman.</p>
<p>This had facilitated Castro's plan, and it also accounted for
the smallness of the boat, which was the only one of the refuse
lot left on the beach that did not gape at every seam. She was
not tight by any means, though. I could hear the water washing
above the bottom-boards, and I remember how concern about keeping
Seraphina's feet dry mingled with the grave apprehensions of our
enterprise.</p>
<p>We had been paddling an easy stroke. The red blurr of the fire
on the point was growing larger, while the diminished blaze of
lights on the high altar of the cathedral pierced the mist with
an orange ray.</p>
<p>"The boat should be baled out," I remarked in a whisper.</p>
<p>Castro laid his oar in and made his way to the thwart. It
shows how well we were prepared for our flight, that there was
not even a half-cocoanut shell in the boat. A gallon earthenware
jar, stoppered with a bunch of grass, contained all our provision
of fresh water. Castro displaced it, and, bending low, tried to
bale with his big, soft hat. I should imagine that he found it
impracticable, because, suddenly, he tore off one of his
square-toed shoes with a steel buckle. He used it as a scoop,
blaspheming at the necessity, but in a very low mutter, out of
respect for Seraphina.</p>
<p>Standing up in the stern-sheets by her side, I kept on
sculling gently. Once before I had gone desperately to
sea&mdash;escaping the gallows, perhaps&mdash;in a very small
boat, with the drunken song of Rangsley's uncle heralding the
fascination of the unknown to a very callow youth. That night had
been as dark, but the danger had been less great. The boat, it is
true, had actually sunk under us, but then it was only the sea
that might have swallowed me who knew nothing of life, and was as
much a stranger to fate as the animals on our farm. But now the
world of men stood ready to devour us, and the Gulf of Mexico was
of no more account than a puddle on a road infested by robbers.
What were the dangers of the sea to the passions amongst which I
was launched&mdash;with my high fortunes in my hand, and, like
all those who live and love, with a sword suspended above my
head?</p>
<p>The danger had been less great on that old night, when I had
heard behind me the soft crash of the smugglers' feet on the
shingle. It had been less great, and, if it had had a touch of
the sordid, it had led me to this second and more desperate
escape&mdash;in a cockleshell, carrying off a silent and cloaked
figure, which quickened my heart-beats at each look. I was
carrying her off from the evil spells of the Casa Riego, as a
knight a princess from an enchanted castle. But she was more to
me than any princess to any knight.</p>
<p>There was never anything like that in the world. Lovers might
have gone, in their passion, to a certain death; but never, it
seemed to me, in the history of youth, had they gone in such an
atmosphere of cautious stillness upon such a reckless adventure.
Everything depended upon slipping out through the gullet of the
bay without a sound. The men on the point had no means of
pursuit, but, if they heard or saw anything, they could shout a
warning to the boats outside. These were the real
dangers&mdash;my first concern. Afterwards...I did not want to
think of afterwards. There were only the open sea and the
perilous coast. Perhaps, if I thought of them, I should give
up.</p>
<p>I thought only of gaining each successive moment and
concentrated all my faculties into an effort of stealthiness. I
handled the boat with a deliberation full of tense prudence, as
if the oar had been a stalk of straw, as if the water of the bay
had been the film of a glass bubble an unguarded movement could
have shivered to atoms. I hardly breathed, for the feeling that a
deeper breath would have blown away the mist that was our sole
protection now.</p>
<p>It was not blown away. On the contrary, it clung closer to us,
with the enveloping chill of a cloud wreathing a mountain crag.
The vague shadows and dim outlines that had hung around us began,
at last, to vanish utterly in an impenetrable and luminous
whiteness. And through the jumble of my thoughts darted the
sudden knowledge that there was a sea-fog outside&mdash;a thing
quite different from the nightly mists of the bay. It was rolling
into the passage inexplicably, for no stir of air reached us. It
was possible to watch its endless drift by the glow of the fire
on the point, now much nearer us. Its edges seemed to melt away
in the flight of the water-dust. It was a sea-fog coming in. Was
it disastrous to us, or favourable? It, at least, answered our
immediate need for concealment, and this was enough for me, when
all our future hung upon every passing minute.</p>
<p>The Rio picaroons, when engaged in thieving from some ship
becalmed on the coast, began by towing one of their schooners as
far as the entrance. They left her there as a rallying point for
the boats, and to receive the booty.</p>
<p>One of these schooners, as I knew, was moored opposite the
Casa Riego. The other might be lying at anchor somewhere right in
the fairway ahead, within a few yards. I strained my ears for
some revealing sound from her, if she were there&mdash;a cough, a
voice, the creak of a block, or the fall of something on her
deck. Nothing came. I began to fear lest I should run stem on
into her side without a moment's warning. I could see no further
than the length of our twelve-foot boat.</p>
<p>To make certain of avoiding that danger, I decided to shave
close the spit of sand that tipped the narrow strip of lowland to
the south. I set my teeth, and sheered in resolutely.</p>
<p>Castro remained on the after-thwart, with his elbows on his
knees. His head nearly touched my leg. I could distinguish the
woeful, bent back, the broken swaying of the plume in his hat.
Seraphina's perfect immobility gave me the measure of her
courage, and the silence was so profoundly pellucid that the
flutter of the flames that we were nearing began to come loud out
of the blur of the glow. Then I heard the very crackling of the
wood, like a fusillade from a great distance. Even then Castro
did not deign to turn his head.</p>
<p>Such as he was&mdash;a born vagabond, <i>contrabandista</i>,
spy in armed camps, sutler at the tail of the <i>Grande
Arm&eacute;e</i> (escaped, God only knows how, from the snows of
Russia), beggar, <i>guerrillero</i>, bandit, sceptically
murderous, draping his rags in saturnine dignity&mdash;he had
ended by becoming the sinister and grotesque squire of our
quixotic Carlos. There was something romantically sombre in his
devotion. He disdained to turn round at the danger, because he
had left his heart on the coffin as a lesser affection would have
laid a wreath. I looked down at Seraphina. She too, had left a
heart in the vaults of the cathedral. The edge of the heavy cloak
drawn over her head concealed her face from me, and, with her
face, her ignorance, her great doubts, her great fears.</p>
<p>I heard, above the crackling of dry wood, a husky exclamation
of surprise, and then a startled voice exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Look! <i>Santissima Madre!</i> What is this?"</p>
<p>Sheer instinct altered at once the motion of my hand so as to
incline the bows of the dinghy away from the shore; but a sort of
stupefying amazement seized upon my soul. We had been seen. It
was all over. Was it possible? All over, already?</p>
<p>In my anxiety to keep clear of the schooner which, for all I
know to this day, may not have been there at all, I had come too
close to the sand, so close that I heard soft, rapid footfalls
stop short in the fog. A voice seemed to be asking me in a
whisper:</p>
<p>"Where, oh, where?"</p>
<p>Another cried out irresistibly, "I see it."</p>
<p>It was a subdued cry, as if hushed in sudden awe.</p>
<p>My arm swung to and fro; the turn of my wrist went on
imparting the propelling motion of the oar. All the rest of my
body was gripped helplessly in the dead expectation of the end,
as if in the benumbing seconds of a fall from a towering height.
And it was swift, too. I felt a draught at the back of my
neck&mdash;a breath of wind. And instantly, as if a battering-ram
had been let swing past me at many layers of stretched gauze, I
beheld, through a tattered deep hole in the fog, a roaring vision
of flames, borne down and springing up again; a dance of purple
gleams on the strip of unveiled water, and three coal-black
figures in the light.</p>
<p>One of them stood high on lank black legs, with long black
arms thrown up stiffly above the black shape of a hat. The two
others crouched low on the very edge of the water, peering as if
from an ambush.</p>
<p>The clearness of this vision was contained by a thick and
fiery atmosphere, into which a soft white rush and swirl of fog
fell like a sudden whirl of snow. It closed down and overwhelmed
at once the tall flutter of the flames, the black figures, the
purple gleams playing round my oar. The hot glare had struck my
eyeballs once, and had melted away again into the old, fiery
stain on the mended fabric of the fog. But the attitudes of the
crouching men left no room for doubt that we had been seen. I
expected a sudden uplifting of voices on the shore, answered by
cries from the sea, and I screamed excitedly at Castro to lay
hold of his oar.</p>
<p>He did not stir, and after my shout, which must have fallen on
the scared ears with a weird and unearthly note, a profound
silence attended us&mdash;the silence of a superstitious fear.
And, instead of howls, I heard, before the boat had travelled its
own short length, a voice that seemed to be the voice of fear
itself asking, "Did you hear that?" and a trembling mutter of an
invocation to all the saints. Then a strangled throat trying to
pronounce firmly, "The souls of the dead <i>Inglez</i>. Crying
from pain."</p>
<p>Admiral Rowley's seamen, so miserably thrown away in the
ill-conceived attack on the bay, were making a ghostly escort for
our escape. Those dead boats'-crews were supposed to haunt the
fatal spot, after the manner of spectres that linger in remorse,
regret, or revenge, about the gates of departure. I had
blundered; the fog, breaking apart, had betrayed us. But my
obscure and vanquished countrymen held possession of the outlet
by the memory of their courage. In this critical moment it was
they, I may say, who stood by us.</p>
<p>We, on our part, must have been disclosed, dark, indistinct,
utterly inexplicable; completely unexpected; an apparition of
stealthy shades. The painful voice in the fog said:</p>
<p>"Let them be. Answer not. They shall pass on, for none of them
died on the shore&mdash;all in the water. Yes, all in the
water."</p>
<p>I suppose the man was trying to reassure himself and his
companions. His meaning, no doubt, was that, being on shore, they
were safe from the ghosts of those <i>Inglez</i> who had never
achieved a landing. From the enlarging and sudden deepening of
the glow, I knew that they were throwing more brushwood on the
fire.</p>
<p>I kept on sculling, and gradually the sharp fusillade of dry
twigs grew more distant, more muffled in the fog. At last it
ceased altogether. Then a weakness came over me, and, hauling my
oar in, I sat down by Sera-phina's side. I longed for the sound
of her voice, for some tender word, for the caress of a murmur
upon my perplexed soul. I was sure of her, as of a conquered and
rare treasure, whose possession simplifies life into a sort of
adoring guardianship&mdash;and I felt so much at her mercy that
an overwhelming sense of guilt made me afraid to speak to her.
The slight heave of the open sea swung the boat up and down.</p>
<p>Suddenly Castro let out a sort of lugubrious chuckle, and, in
low tones, I began to upbraid him with his apathy. Even with his
one arm he should have obeyed my call to the oar. It was
incomprehensible to me that we had not been fired at. Castro
enlightened me, in a few moody and scornful words. The Rio Medio
people, he commented upon the incident, were fools, of bestial
nature, afraid of they knew not what.</p>
<p>"Castro, the valour of these dead countrymen of mine was not
wasted; they have stood by us like true friends," I whispered in
the excitement of our escape.</p>
<p>"These insensate English," he grumbled...</p>
<p>"A dead enemy would have served the turn better. If the
<i>caballero</i> had none other than dead friends..."</p>
<p>His harsh, bitter mumble stopped. Then Sera-phina's voice said
softly:</p>
<p>"It is you who are the friend, Tomas Castro. To you shall come
a friend's reward."</p>
<p>"Alas, Se&ntilde;orita!" he sighed. "What remains for me in
this world&mdash;for me who have given for two masses for the
souls of that illustrious man, and of your cousin Don Carlos, my
last piece of silver?"</p>
<p>"We shall make you very rich, Tomas Castro," she said with
decision, as if there had been bags of gold in the boat.</p>
<p>He returned a high-flown phrase of thanks in a bitter, absent
whisper. I knew well enough that the help he had given me was not
for money, not for love&mdash;not even for loyalty to the Riegos.
It was obedience to the last recommendation of Carlos. He ran
risks for my safety, but gave me none of his allegiance.</p>
<p>He was still the same tubby, murderous little man, with a
steel blade screwed to the wooden stump of his forearm, as when,
swelling his breast, he had stepped on his toes before me like a
bloodthirsty pigeon, in the steerage of the ship that had brought
us from home. I heard him mumble, with almost incredible,
sardonic contempt, that, indeed, the senor would soon have none
but dead friends if he refrained from striking at his enemies.
Had the senor taken the very excellent opportunity afforded by
Providence, and that any sane Christian man would have
taken&mdash;to let him stab the Juez O'Brien&mdash;we should not
then be wandering in a little boat. What folly! What folly! One
little thrust of a knife, and we should all have been now safe in
our beds...</p>
<p>His tone was one of weary superiority, and I remained appalled
by that truth, stripped of all chivalrous pretence. It was clear,
in sparing that defenceless life, I had been guilty of cruelty
for the sake of my conscience. There was Seraphina by my side; it
was she who had to suffer. I had let her enemy go free, because
he had happened to be near me, disarmed. Had I acted like an
Englishman and a gentleman, or only like a fool satisfying his
sentiment at other people's expense? Innocent people, too, like
the Riego servants, Castro himself; like Seraphina, on whom my
high-minded forbearance had brought all these dangers, these
hardships, and this uncertain fate.</p>
<p>She gave no sign of having heard Castro's words. The silence
of women is very impenetrable, and it was as if my hold upon the
world&mdash;since she was the whole world for me&mdash;had been
weakened by that shade of decency of feeling which makes a
distinction between killing and murder. But suddenly I felt,
without her cloaked figure having stirred, her small hand slip
into mine. Its soft warmth seemed to go straight to my heart
soothing, invigorating&mdash;as it she had slipped into my palm a
weapon of extraordinary and inspiring potency.</p>
<p>"Ah, you are generous," I whispered close to the edge of the
cloak overshadowing her face.</p>
<p>"You must now think of yourself, Juan," she said.</p>
<p>"Of myself," I echoed sadly. "I have only you to think of, and
you are so far away&mdash;out of my reach. There are your
dead&mdash;all your loss, between you and me."</p>
<p>She touched my arm.</p>
<p>"It is I who must think of my dead," she whispered. "But you,
you must think of yourself, because I have nothing of mine in
this world now."</p>
<p>Her words affected me like the whisper of remorse. It was
true. There were her wealth, her lands, her palaces; but her only
refuge was that little boat. Her father's long aloofness from
life had created such an isolation round his closing years that
his daughter had no one but me to turn to for protection against
the plots of her own Intendente. And, at the thought of our
desperate plight, of the suffering awaiting us in that small
boat, with the possibility of a lingering death for an end, I
wavered for a moment. Was it not my duty to return to the bay and
give myself up? In that case, as Castro expressed it, our throats
would be cut for love of the <i>Juez</i>.</p>
<p>But Seraphina, the rabble would carry to the Casa on the palms
of their hands&mdash;out of veneration for the family, and for
fear of O'Brien.</p>
<p>"So, Se&ntilde;or," he mumbled, "if to you to-morrow's sun is
as little as to me let us pull the boat's head, round."</p>
<p>"Let us set our hands to the side and overturn it, rather,"
Seraphina said, with an indignation of high command.</p>
<p>I said no more. If I could have taken O'Brien with me into the
other world, I would have died to save her the pain of so much as
a pinprick. But because I could not, she must even go with me;
must suffer because I clung to her as men cling to their hope of
highest good&mdash;with an exalted and selfish devotion.</p>
<p>Castro had moved forward, as if to show his readiness to pull
round. Meantime I heard a click. A feeble gleam fell on his misty
hands under the black halo of the hat rim. Again the flint and
blade clicked, and a large red spark winked rapidly in the bows.
He had lighted a cigarette. <a name="2HCH0020">

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>Silence, stillness, breathless caution were the absolute
conditions of our existence. But I hadn't the heart to
remonstrate with him for the danger he caused Seraphina and
myself. The fog was so thick now that I could not make out his
outline, but I could smell the tobacco very plainly.</p>
<p>The acrid odour of <i>picadura</i> seemed to knit the events
of three years into one uninterrupted adventure. I remembered the
shingle beach; the deck of the old <i>Thames</i>. It brought to
my mind my first vision of Seraphina, and the emblazoned
magnificence of Carlos' sick bed. It all came and went in a whiff
of smoke; for of all the power and charm that had made Carlos so
seductive there remained no such deep trace in the world as in
the heart of the little grizzled bandit who, like a philosopher,
or a desperado, puffed his cigarette in the face of the very
spirit of murder hovering round us, under the mask and cloak of
the fog. And by the serene heaven of my life's evening, the
spirit of murder became actually audible to us in hasty and
rhythmical knocks, accompanied by a cheerful tinkling.</p>
<p>These sounds, growing swiftly louder, at last induced Castro
to throw away his cigarette. Seraphina clutched my arm. The noise
of oars rowing fast, to the precipitated jingling of a guitar,
swooped down upon us with a gallant ferocity.</p>
<p>"<i>Caramba</i>," Castro muttered; "it is the fool Manuel
himself!"</p>
<p>I said, then: "We have eight shots between us two, Tomas."</p>
<p>He thrust his brace of pistols upon my knees.</p>
<p>"Dispose of them as your worship pleases," he muttered.</p>
<p>"You mustn't <i>give</i> up, yet," I whispered.</p>
<p>"What is it that I give up?" he mumbled wearily. "Besides,
there grows from my forearm a blade. If I shall find myself
indisposed to quit this world alone...Listen to the singing of
that imbecile."</p>
<p>A carolling falsetto seemed to hang muffled in upper space,
above the fog that settled low on the water, like a dense and
milky sediment of the air. The moonlight fell into it strangely.
We seemed to breathe at the bottom of a shallow sea, white as
snow, shining like silver, and impenetrably opaque everywhere,
except overhead, where the yellow disc of the moon glittered
through a thin cloud of steam. The gay truculence of the hollow
knocking, the metallic jingle, the shrill trolling, went on
crescendo to a burst of babbling voices, a mad speed of tinkling,
a thundering shout, "<i>Altro, Amigos!</i>" followed by a great
clatter of oars flung in. The sudden silence pulsated with the
ponderous strokes of my heart.</p>
<p>To escape now seemed impossible. At least it seemed impossible
while they talked. A dark spot in the shining expanse of fog swam
into view. It shifted its place after I had first made it out,
and then remained motionless, astern of the dinghy. It was the
shadow of a big boat full of men, but when they were silent, I
was not sure that I saw anything at all. I made no doubt, had
they been aware of our nearness, there were amongst them eyes
that could have detected us in the same elusive way. But how
could they even dream of anything of the kind? They talked
noisily, and there must have been a round dozen of them, at the
least.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would fall a-shouting all together, and then
keep quiet as if listening. By-and-by I began to hear answering
yells, that seemed to converge upon us from all directions.</p>
<p>We were in the thick of it. It was Manuel's boat, as Castro
had guessed, and the other boats were rallying upon it gropingly,
keeping up a succession of yells:</p>
<p>"<i>Ohe! Ohe!</i> Where, where?"</p>
<p>And the people in Manuel's boat howled back at them, "<i>Ohe!
Ohe...e!</i> This way; here!"</p>
<p>Suddenly he struck the guitar a mighty blow, and chanted in an
inspired and grandiose strain:</p>
<p>"Steer&mdash;for&mdash;the&mdash;song."</p>
<p>His fingers ran riot among the strings, and above the jingling
his voice, forced to the highest pitch, declaimed, as in the
midst of a tempest:</p>
<pre>
     "I adore the saints in the glory of heaven
     And, on the dust of the earth,
     The print of her footsteps."
</pre>
<p>He was improvising. Sometimes he gasped; the rill of softened
tinkle ran on, and, glaring watchfully, I fancied I could detect
his shape in the white vapour, like a shadow thrown from afar by
a tallow dip upon a snowy sheet&mdash;the lank droop of his
posturing, the greasy locks, the attentive poise of his head, the
sentimental rolling of his lustrous and enormous eyes.</p>
<p>I had not forgotten his astonishing display in the cabin of
the schooner when, after the confiding of his woes and his
ambitions, he had favoured me with a sample of his art. As at
that time, when he had been nursing his truculent conceit, he
sang, and the unsteady twanging of his guitar lurched and
staggered far behind his voice, like a drunken slave in the
footsteps of a raving master. Tinkle, tinkle, twang! A headlong
rush of muddled fingering; a sudden bang, like a heavy
stumble.</p>
<p>"She is the proud daughter of the old Castile! <i>Ol&agrave;!
Ol&agrave;!</i>" he chanted mysteriously at the beginning of
every stanza in a rapturous and soft ecstasy, and then would
shriek, as though he had been suddenly cast up on the rock. The
poet of Rio Medio was rallying his crew of thieves to a rhapsody
of secret and unrequited passion. <i>Twang, ping, tinkle
tinkle</i>. He was the <i>Capataz</i> of the valiant
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>! The true <i>Capataz!</i> The only
<i>Capataz. Ol&agrave;! Ol&agrave;! Twang, twang</i>. But he was
the slave of her charms, the captive of her eyes, of her lips, of
her hair, of her eyebrows, which, he proclaimed in a soaring
shriek, were like rainbows arched over stars.</p>
<p>It was a love-song, a mournful parody, the odious grimacing of
an ape to the true sorrow of the human face. I could have fled
from it, as from an intolerable humiliation. And it would have
been easy to pull away unheard while he sang, but I had a plan,
the beginning of a plan, something like the beginning of a hope.
And for that I should have to use the fog for the purpose of
remaining within earshot.</p>
<p>Would the fog last long enough to serve my turn? That was the
only question, and I believed it would, for it settled lower; it
settled down denser, almost too heavy to be stirred by the fitful
efforts of the breeze. It was a true night fog of the tropics,
that, born after sunset, tries to creep back into the warm bosom
of the sea before sunrise. Once in Rio Medio, taking a walk in
the early morning along the sand-dunes, I had stood watching
below me the heads of some people, fishing from a boat, emerge
strangely in the dawn out of such a fog. It concealed their very
shoulders more completely than water could have done. I trusted
it would not come so soon to our heads, emerging, though it
seemed to me that already, by merely clambering on Castro's
shoulders, I could attain to clear moonlight; see the highlands
of the coast, the masts of the English ship. She could not be
very far off if only one could tell the direction. But an
unsteady little dinghy was not the platform for acrobatic
exercises, and Castro not exactly the man.</p>
<p>The slightest noise would have betrayed us, and moreover, the
thing was no good, for even supposing I had got a hurried sight
of the ship's spars, I should have to get down into the fog to
pull, and there would be nothing visible to keep us from going
astray, unless at every dozen strokes I clambered on Castro's
shoulders again to rectify the direction&mdash;an obviously
impracticable and absurd proceeding.</p>
<p>"She is the proud daughter of old Castile, <i>Ol&agrave;,
Ol&agrave;</i>," Manuel sang confidentially with a subdued and
gallant lilt...Obviously impracticable. But I had another
idea.</p>
<pre>
     "<i>Tinkle tinkle pinnnng...Brrroum. Brrrroum</i>.
     My soul yearns for the alms of a smile.
     For a forgiving glance yearns my lofty soul..."
</pre>
<p>he sang. Ah, if one could have added another four feet to
one's stature. Four or five feet only. There seemed to be nothing
but a thin veil between me and the moon. No more than a thin
haze. But at the level of my eyes everything was hidden. From
behind the white veil came the crying of the strings, a
screeching, lugubrious and fierce in its artificial transport, as
if it were mocking my sad and ardent conviction of un-worthiness,
the crowning torment, and the inward pride of pure love. In the
breathless pauses I could hear the hollow bumping of gunwales
knocking against each other; faint splashings of oars; the
distant hail of some laggards groping their way on the shrouded
sea.</p>
<p>The note of cruel passion that runs in the blood held these
cut-throats profoundly silent in their boats, as at home I could
imagine a party of smugglers (they would not stick at a murder or
two, either) listening, with pensive faces, to a sentimental
ditty of some "sweet Nancy," howled dismally within the walls of
a wayside taproom in the smoke of pipes. I seemed to understand
profoundly the difference of races that brings with it the
feeling of romance or awakens hate. My gorge rose at Manuel's
song. I hated his lamentations. "Alas, alas; in vain, in vain."
He strummed with vertiginous speed, with fury, and the distracted
clamour of his voice, wrestling madly with the ringing madness of
the strings, ended in a piercing and supreme shriek.</p>
<p>"Finished. It is finished." A low and applauding murmur flowed
to my ears, the austere acclamations of connoisseurs. "Viva,
viva, Manuele!"&mdash;a squeak of fervid admiration. "Ah, our
<i>Manuelito</i>."...But a gruff voice discoursed jovially, "Care
not, Manuel. What of Paquita with the broken tooth? Is she not
left to thee? And <i>por Dios, hombres</i>, in the dark all women
are alike."</p>
<p>"I will cram thy unclean mouth with live coals," Manuel
drawled spitefully.</p>
<p>They roared with laughter at this sally. I depicted to myself
their shapes, their fierce gesticulations, their earrings, bound
heads, rags, and weapons, the vile scowls on their swarthy,
grimacing faces. My anxiety beheld them as plainly as anything
seen with the eyes of the body. And, with my sharpened hearing
catching every word with preternatural distinctness, I felt as
if, the ring of Gyges on my finger, I had sat invisible at the
council of my enemies.</p>
<p>It was noisy, animated, with an issue of supreme interest for
us. The ship, seen at midday standing inshore with a light wind,
had not approached the bay near enough to be conveniently
attacked till just after dusk. They had waited for her all the
afternoon, sleeping and gambling on the spit of sand. But
something heavy in her appearance had excited their craven
suspicions, and checked their ardour. She appeared to them
dangerous. What if she were an English man-of-war disguised? Some
even pretended to recognize in her positively one of the lighter
frigates of Rowley's squadron. Night had fallen whilst they
squabbled, and their flotilla hung under the land, the men in a
conflict of rapacity and fear, arguing among themselves as to the
ship's character, but all unanimously goading Manuel&mdash;since
he <i>would</i> call himself their only <i>Capataz</i>&mdash;to
go boldly and find out.</p>
<p>It seems he had just been doing this with the help of a few
choicer spirits, and under cover of the fog. They had managed to
steal near enough to hear Englishmen conversing on board, orders
given, and the yo-hoing of invisible sailors, trimming the yards
of the ship to the fitful airs. This last, of course, was
decisive. Such sounds are not heard on a man-of-war. She was a
merchant ship: she would be an easy prey. And Manuel, in a state
of exaltation at his venturesome bravery, had pulled back
inshore, to rally all the boats round his own, and lead them to
certain plunder. They would soon find out, he declaimed, what it
was to have at their head their own valiant Manuel, instead of
that vagabond, that stranger, that Andalusian starveling; that
traitor, that infidel, that Castro. Hidden away, he seemed to
spout all this for our ears alone, as though he could see us in
our boat...Patience; patience! Some day he would cut off that
interloper's eyelids, and lay him on his back under a nice clear
sun. Castro made a brusque movement; a little shudder of disgust
escaped Seraphina...Meantime, Manuel declared, by his audacity,
that ship was as good as theirs already. "<i>Viva el
Capataz!</i>" they cheered.</p>
<p>The cloud-like vapours resting on the sea muffled the short
roar; we heard grim laughter, excited cries. He began to make a
set speech, and his voice, haranguing with vehement inflections
in the shining whiteness of a cloud, had an amazing and
uncorporeal character; the quality of abstract surprise; of
phenomenal emotion shouted into empty space. And for me it had,
also, the fascination of a revealed depth.</p>
<p>It was like the oration of an ambitious leader in a farce; he
held his hearers with his eloquence, as much as he had done with
the song of his grotesque and desecrating love. He vaunted his
sagacity and his valour, and overwhelmed with invective all sorts
of names&mdash;my own and Castro's among them. He revealed the
unholy ideals of all that band of scoundrels&mdash;ideals that he
said should find fruition under his captaincy. He boasted of
secret conferences with O'Brien. There were murmurs of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>I don't wonder at Seraphina's shudder of horror, of disgust,
of dismay, and indignation. Robbed of the inexpugnable shelter of
the Casa Riego, she, too, was made to look into the depths; upon
the animalism, the lusts, and the reveries of that sordid,
vermin-haunted crowd. I felt for her a profound and shamed
sorrow. It was like a profaning touch on the sacredness of her
mourning for the dead, and on her clear and passionate vision of
life.</p>
<p>"<i>Hombres de Rio Medio! Amigos! Valientes!...</i>" Manuel
was beginning his peroration. He would lead them, now, against
the English ship. The terrified heretics would surrender. There
was always gold in English ships. He stopped his speech, and then
called loudly, "Let the boats keep touch with each other, and not
stray in that fog."</p>
<p>"The dog," grunted Castro. We heard a resolute bustle of
preparation; oars were being shipped.</p>
<p>"Make ready, Tomas," I whispered.</p>
<p>"Ready for what?" he grumbled. "Where shall your worship run
from these swine?"</p>
<p>"We must follow them," I answered.</p>
<p>"The madness of the senor's countrymen descends upon him," he
whispered with sardonic politeness. "Wherefore follow?"</p>
<p>"To find the English ship," I answered swiftly.</p>
<p>This, from the moment we had heard Manuel's guitar, had been
my idea. Since the fog that concealed us from their sight made
us, too, hopelessly blind, those wretches must guide us
themselves out of their own clutches, as it were. I don't put
this forward as an inspired conception. It was a most risky and
almost hopeless expedient; but the position was so critical that
there was no other alternative to sitting still and waiting with
folded hands for discovery. Castro seemed more inclined for the
latter.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bandits wasted some time in blasphemous
bickerings as to the order of the boats in the procession of
attack. I urged my views upon Castro in hurried whispers. His
assent was of importance, since he could use an oar very well,
and, if left to myself, I could not hope to scull fast enough to
keep within hearing of the flotilla.</p>
<p>"Of what use to us would be a ship in Manuel's power?" he
argued morosely. On the other hand, if we waited near her till
she had been plundered and released, neither the fog nor the
night would last forever.</p>
<p>"My countrymen will beat them off," I affirmed confidently.
"At any rate, let us be on the spot. We may take a hand. And
remember, Tomas, they are not led by you, this time."</p>
<p>"True," he said, mollified. "But one thing more deserves the
consideration of your worship...If we follow this plan, we take
the senorita among flying bullets. And lead, alas! unlike steel,
is blind, or that illustrious man would not now be dead. If we
wait here, the senorita, at least, shall take no harm from these
ruffians, as I have said."</p>
<p>"Are you afraid of the bullets?" I asked Seraphina.</p>
<p>Before she had answered, Castro hissed at me:</p>
<p>"Oh, you unspeakable English. Would you sacrifice the
daughter, too, only because she is brave?"</p>
<p>His sinister allusion made my blood boil with rage, and
suddenly run cold in my veins. Swathed in the brilliant cloud, we
heard the sounds of quarrelling and scrambling die away; cries of
"Ready! ready!" an unexpected and brutal laugh. Seraphina leaned
forward.</p>
<p>"Tomas, I wish this thing. I command it," she whispered
imperiously. "We shall help these English on the ship. We must; I
command it. For these are now my people."</p>
<p>I heard him mutter to himself, "h, dear shade of my Carlos.
Her people. Where are now mine?" But he shipped his oar, and sat
waiting.</p>
<p>In the moment before the picaroons actually started, I became
the prey of the most intense anxiety. I knew we were to seaward
of the cluster. But of our position relatively to the boats, and
to the English ship they would make for, I was profoundly
ignorant. The dinghy might be lying right in the way. Before I
could master the sort of disorder I was thrown into by that
thought&mdash;which, strange to say, had not occurred to me till
then&mdash;with a shrill whistle Manuel led off.</p>
<p>We are always incited to trust, our eyes rather than our ears;
and such is the conventional temper in which we receive the
impression of our senses that I had no idea they were so near us.
The destruction of my illusory feeling of distance was the most
startling thing in the world. Instantly, it seemed, with the
second swing and plash of the oars, the boats were right upon us.
They went clear. It was like being grazed by a fall of rocks. I
seemed to feel the wind of the rush.</p>
<p>The rapid clatter of rowing, the excited hum of voices, the
violent commotion of the water, passed by us with an impetuosity
that took my breath away. They had started in a bunch. There must
have been amongst them at least one crew of negroes, because
somebody was beating a tambourine smartly, and the rowers
chorused in a quick, panting undertone, "<i>Ho, ho,
talibambo...Ho, ho, talibambo</i>." One of the boats silhouetted
herself for an instant, a row of heads swaying back and forth,
towered over astern by a full-length figure as straight as an
arrow. A retreating voice thundered, "Silence!" The sounds and
the forms faded together in the fog with amazing swiftness.</p>
<p>Seraphina, her cloak off, her head bare, stared forward after
the fleeting murmurs and shadows we were pursuing. Sometimes she
warned us, "More to the left "; or, "Faster!" We had to put forth
our best, for Manuel, as if in the very wantonness of confidence,
had set a tremendous pace.</p>
<p>I suppose he took his first direction by the light on the
point. I cannot tell what guided him after that feeble sheen had
become buried in the fog; but there was no check in the speed, no
sign of hesitation. We followed in the track of the sound, and,
for the most part, kept in sight of the elusive shadow of the
sternmost boat. Often, in a denser belt of fog, the sounds of
rowing became muffled almost to extinction; or we seemed to hear
them all round and, startled, checked our speed. Dark apparitions
of boats would surge up on all sides in a most inexplicable way;
to the right; to the left; even coming from behind. They appeared
real, unmistakable, and, before we had time to dodge them,
vanished utterly. Then we had to spurt desperately after the
grind of the oars, caught, just in time, in an unexpected
direction.</p>
<p>And then we lost them. We pulled frantically. Seraphina had
been urging us, "Faster! faster!" From time to time I would ask
her, "Can you see them?" "Not yet," she answered curtly. The
perspiration poured down my face. Castro's panting was like the
wheezing of bellows at my back. Suddenly, in a despairing tone,
she said:</p>
<p>"Stop! I can neither see nor hear anything now."</p>
<p>We feathered our oars at once, and fell to listening with
lowered heads. The ripple of the boat's way expired slowly. A
great white stillness hung slumbrously over the sea.</p>
<p>It was inconceivable. We pulled once or twice with extreme
energy for a few minutes after imaginary whistles or shouts. Once
I heard them passing our bows. But it was useless; we stopped,
and the moon, from within the mistiness of an immense halo,
looked dreamily upon our heads.</p>
<p>Castro grunted, "Here is an end of your plan, Se&ntilde;or Don
Juan."</p>
<p>The peculiar and ghastly hopelessness of our position could
not be better illustrated than by this fresh difficulty. We had
lost touch&mdash;with a murderous gang that had every inducement
not to spare our lives. And positively it was a misfortune; an
abandonment. I refused to admit to myself its finality, as if it
had reflected upon the devotion of tried friends. I repeated to
Castro that we should become aware of them
directly&mdash;probably even nearer than we wished. And, at any
rate, we were certain of a mighty loud noise when the attack on
the ship began. She, at least, could not be very far now.
"Unless, indeed," I admitted with exasperation, "we are to
suppose that your imbecile <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> have missed
their prey and got themselves as utterly lost as we
ourselves."</p>
<p>I was irritated&mdash;by his nodding plume; by his cold,
perfunctory, as if sleepy mutters, "Possibly, possibly, <i>puede
ser</i>." He retorted: "Your English generosity could wish your
countrymen no better luck than that my <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>,
as your worship pleases to call them, should miss their way. They
are hungry for loot&mdash;with much fasting. And it is hunger
that makes your wolf fly straight at the throat."</p>
<p>All the time Seraphina breathed no word. But when I raised my
voice, she put out a hushing hand to my arm. And, from her intent
pose, from the turn of her shadowy head, I knew that she was
peering and listening loyally.</p>
<p>Minutes passed&mdash;very few, I dare say&mdash;and brought no
sound. The restlessness of waiting made us dip our oars in a
haphazard stroke, without aim, without the means of judging
whether we pulled to seaward, inshore, north, or south, or only
in a circle. Once we went excitedly in chase of some splashing
that must have been a leaping fish. I was hanging my head over my
idle oar when Seraphina touched me.</p>
<p>"I see!" she said, pointing over the bows.</p>
<p>Both Castro and I, peering horizontally over the water, did
not see anything. Not a shadow. Moreover, if they were so near,
we ought to have heard something.</p>
<p>"I believe it is land!" she murmured. "You are looking too
low, Juan."</p>
<p>As soon as I looked up I saw it, too, dark and beetling, like
the overhang of a low cliff. Where on earth had we blundered to?
For a moment I was confounded. Fiery reflections from a light
played faintly above that shape. Then I recognized what I was
looking at. We had found the ship.</p>
<p>The fog was so shallow that up there the upper bulk of a
heavy, square stern, the very rails and stanchions crowning it
like a balustrade, jutted out in the misty sheen like the balcony
of an invisible edifice, for the lines of her run, the sides of
her hull, were plunged in the dense white layer below. And,
throwing back my head, I traced even her becalmed sails, pearly
gray pinnacles of shadow uprising, tall and motionless, towards
the moon.</p>
<p>A redness wavered over her, as from a blaze on her deck. Could
she be on fire? And she was silent as a tomb. Could she be
abandoned? I had promised myself to dash alongside, but there was
a weirdness in that fragment of a dumb ship hanging out of a fog.
We pulled only a stroke or two nearer to the stern, and stopped.
I remembered Castro's warning&mdash;the blindness of flying lead;
but it was the profound stillness that checked me. It seemed to
portend something inconceivable. I hailed, tentatively, as if I
had not expected to be answered, "Ship, ahoy!"</p>
<p>Neither was I answered by the instantaneous, "Hallo," of usual
watchfulness, though she was not abandoned. Indeed, my hail made
a good many men jump, to judge by the sounds and the words that
came to me from above. "What? What? A hail?" "Boat near?" "In
English, sir."</p>
<p>"Dive for the captain, one of you," an authoritative voice
directed. "He's just run below for a minute. Don't frighten the
missus. Call him out quietly."</p>
<p>Talking, in confidential undertones, followed.</p>
<p>"See him?" "Can't, sir." "What's the dodge, I wonder."
"Astern, I think, sir." "D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n this fog, it
lies as thick as pea-soup on the water."</p>
<p>I waited, and after a perplexed sort of pause, heard a stern
"Keep off." <a name="2HCH0021"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>They did not suspect how close I was to them. And their temper
struck me at once as unsafe. They seemed very much on the alert,
and, as I imagined, disposed to precipitate action. I called out,
deadening my voice warily:</p>
<p>"I am an Englishman, escaping from the pirates here. We want
your help."</p>
<p>To this no answer was made, but by that time the captain had
come on deck. The dinghy must have drifted in a little closer,
for I made out behind the shadowy rail one, two, three figures in
a row, looming bulkily above my head, as men appear enlarged in
mist.</p>
<p>"'Englishman,' he says." "That's very likely," pronounced a
new voice. They held a hurried consultation up there, of which I
caught only detached sentences, and the general tone of concern.
"It's perfectly well known that there <i>is</i> an Englishman
here...Aye, a runaway second mate...Killed a man in a Bristol
ship...What was his name, now?"</p>
<p>"Won't you answer me?" I called out.</p>
<p>"Aye, we will answer you as soon as we see you...Keep your
eyes skinned fore and aft on deck there...Ready, boys?"</p>
<p>"All ready, sir"; voices came from further off.</p>
<p>"Listen to me," I entreated.</p>
<p>Someone called out briskly, "This is a bad place for pretty
tales of Englishmen in distress. We know very well where we
are."</p>
<p>"You are off Rio Medio," I began anxiously; "and
I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>
<p>"Speaks the truth like a Briton, anyhow," commented a lazy
drawl.</p>
<p>"I would send another man to the pump," a reflective voice
suggested. "To make sure of the force, Mr. Sebright, you
know."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir...Another hand to the brakes, bo'sun."</p>
<p>"I have been held captive on shore," I said. "I escaped this
evening, three hours ago."</p>
<p>"And found this ship in the fog? You made a good shot at it,
didn't you?"</p>
<p>"It's no time for trifling, I swear to you," I continued.
"They are out looking for you, in force. I've heard them. I was
with them when they started."</p>
<p>"I believe you."</p>
<p>"They seem to have missed the ship."</p>
<p>"So you came to have a friendly chat meantime. That's kind.
Beastly weather, aint it?"</p>
<p>"I want to come aboard," I shouted. "You must be crazy not to
believe me."</p>
<p>"But we do believe every single word you say," bantered the
Sebright voice with serenity.</p>
<p>Suddenly another struck in, "Nichols, I call to mind,
sir."</p>
<p>"Of course, of course. This is the man."</p>
<p>"My name's not Nichols," I protested.</p>
<p>"Now, now. You mustn't begin to lie," remonstrated Sebright.
Somebody laughed discreetly.</p>
<p>"You are mistaken, on my honour," I said. "Nichols left Rio
Medio some time ago."</p>
<p>"About three hours, eh?" came the drawl of insufferable folly
in these precious minutes.</p>
<p>It was clear that Manuel had gone astray, but I feared not for
long. They would spread out in search. And now I had found this
hopeless ship, it seemed impossible that anybody else could miss
her.</p>
<p>"You may be boarded any moment by more than a dozen boats. I
warn you solemnly. Will you let me come?"</p>
<p>A low whistle was heard on board. They were impressed, "Why
should he tell us this?" an undertone inquired.</p>
<p>"Why the devil shouldn't he? It's no great news, is it? Some
scoundrelly trick. This man's up to any dodge. Why, the
'<i>Jane</i>' was taken in broad day by two boats that pretended
they were going to sell vegetables."</p>
<p>"Look out, or by heavens you'll be taken by surprise. There's
a lot of them," I said as impressively as I could.</p>
<p>"Look out, look out. There's a lot of them," someone yelled in
a sort of panic.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's your game," Sebright's voice said to me. "Frighten
us, eh? Never you mind what this skunk says, men. Stand fast. We
shall take a lot of killing." He was answered by a sort of
pugnacious uproar, a clash of cutlasses and laughter, as if at
some joke.</p>
<p>"That's right, boys; mind and send them away with clean faces,
you gunners. Jack, you keep a good lookout for that poor
distressed Englishman. What's that? a noise in the fog? Stand by.
Now then, cook!..."</p>
<p>"All ready to dish up, sir," a voice answered him.</p>
<p>It was like a sort of madness. Were they thinking of eating?
Even at that the English talk made my heart expand&mdash;the
homeliness of it. I seemed to know all their voices, as if I had
talked to each man before. It brought back memories, like the
voices of friends.</p>
<p>But there was the strange irrelevancy, levity, the
enmity&mdash;the irrational, baffling nature of the anguishing
conversation, as if with the unapproachable men we meet in
nightmares.</p>
<p>We in the dinghy, as well as those on board, were listening
anxiously. A profound silence reigned for a time.</p>
<p>"I don't care for myself," I tried once more, speaking
distinctly. "But a lady in the boat here is in great danger, too.
Won't you do something for a woman?"</p>
<p>I perceived, from the sort of stir on board, that this caused
some sensation.</p>
<p>"Or is the whole ship's company afraid to let one little boat
come alongside?" I added, after waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>A throat was cleared on board mildly, "Hem...you see, we don't
know who you are."</p>
<p>"I've told you who I am. The lady is Spanish."</p>
<p>"Just so. But there are Englishmen and Englishmen in these
days. Some of them keep very bad company ashore, and others
afloat. I couldn't think of taking you on board, unless I know
something more of you."</p>
<p>I seemed to detect an intention of malice in the mild voice.
The more so that I overheard a rapid interchange of mutterings up
there. "See him yet?" "Not a thing, sir." "Wait, I say."</p>
<p>Nothing could overcome the fixed idea of these men, who seemed
to enjoy so much the cleverness of their suspicions. It was the
most dangerous of tempers to deal with. It made them as
untrustworthy as so many lunatics. They were capable of anything,
of decoying us alongside, and stoving the bottom out of the boat,
and drowning us before they discovered their mistake, if they
ever did. Even as it was, there was danger; and yet I was
extremely loath to give her up. It was impossible to give her up.
But what were we to do? What to say? How to act?</p>
<p>"Castro, this is horrible," I said blankly. That he was
beginning to chafe, to fret, and shuffle his feet only added to
my dismay. He might begin at any moment to swear in Spanish, and
that was sure to bring a shower of lead, blind, fired blindly.
"We have nothing to expect from the people of that ship. We
cannot even get on board."</p>
<p>"Not without Manuel's help, it seems," he said bitterly.
"Strange, is it not, Se&ntilde;or? Your countrymen&mdash;your
excellent and virtuous countrymen. Generous and courageous and
perspicacious."</p>
<p>Seraphina said suddenly, "They have reason. It is well for
them to be suspicious of us in this place." She had a tone of
calm reproof, and of faith.</p>
<p>"They shall be of more use when they are dead," Castro
muttered. "The senor's other dead countrymen served us well."</p>
<p>"I shall give you great, very great sums of money," Seraphina
suddenly cried towards the ship. "I am the Se&ntilde;orita
Seraphina Riego."</p>
<p>"There is a woman&mdash;that's a woman's voice, I'll swear," I
heard them exclaim on board, and I cried again:</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. There is a woman."</p>
<p>"I dare say. But where do you come in? You are a distressed
Englishman, aren't you?" a voice came back.</p>
<p>"You shall let us come up on your ship," Seraphina said. "I
shall come myself, alone&mdash;Seraphina Riego."</p>
<p>"Eh, what?" the voice asked.</p>
<p>I felt a little wind on the back of my head. There was
desperate hurry.</p>
<p>"We are escaping to get married," I called out. They were
beginning to shout orders on the ship. "Oh, you've come to the
wrong shop. A church is what you want for <i>that</i> trouble,"
the voice called back brutally, through the other cries of orders
to square the yards.</p>
<p>I shouted again, but my voice must have been drowned in the
creaking of blocks and yards. They were alert enough for every
chance of getting away&mdash;for every flaw of wind. Already the
ship was less distinct, as if my eyes had grown dim. By the time
a voice on board her cried, "Belay," faintly, she had gone from
my sight. Then the puff of wind passed away, too, and left us
more alone than ever, with only the small disk of the moon poised
vertically above the mists.</p>
<p>"Listen," said Tomas Castro, after what seemed an eternity of
crestfallen silence.</p>
<p>He need not have spoken; there could be no doubt that Manuel
had lost himself, and my belief is that the ship had sailed right
into the midst of the flotilla. There was an unmistakable
character of surprise in the distant tumult that arose suddenly,
and as suddenly ceased for a space of a breath or two. "Now,
Castro," I shouted. "Ha! <i>bueno!</i>"</p>
<p>We gave way with a vigour that seemed to lift the dinghy out
of the water. The uproar gathered volume and fierceness.</p>
<p>From the first it was a hand-to-hand contest, engaged in
suddenly, as if the assailants had at once managed to board in a
body, and, as it were, in one unanimous spring. No shots had been
fired. Too far to hear the blows, and seeing nothing as yet of
the ship, we seemed to be hastening towards a deadly struggle of
voices, of shadows with leathern throats; every cry heard in
battle was there&mdash;rage, encouragement, fury, hate, and pain.
And those of pain were amazingly distinct. They were yells; they
were howls. And suddenly, as we approached the ship, but before
we could make out any sign of her, we came upon a boat. We had to
swerve to clear her. She seemed to have dropped out of the fight
in utter disarray; she lay with no oars out, and full of men who
writhed and tumbled over each other, shrieking as if they had
been flayed. Above the writhing figures in the middle of the
boat, a tall man, upright in the stern-sheets, raved awful
imprecations and shook his fists above his head.</p>
<p>The blunt dinghy foamed past that vision within an oar's
length, no more, making straight for the clamour of the fight.
The last puff of wind must have thinned the fog in the ship's
track; for, standing up, face forward to pull stroke, I saw her
come out, stern-on to us, from truck to water-line, mistily tall
and motionless, but resounding with the most fierce and desperate
noises. A cluster of empty boats clung low to her port side,
raft-like and vague on the water.</p>
<p>We heard now, mingled with the fury and hate of shouts
reverberating from the placid sails, mighty thuds and crashes, as
though it had been a combat with clubs and battle-axes.</p>
<p>Evidently, in the surprise and haste of the unexpected coming
together, they had been obliged to board all on the same side. As
I headed for the other a big boat, full of men, with many oars,
shot across our bows, and vanished round the ship's counter in
the twinkling of an eye. The defenders, engaged on the port side,
were going to be taken in the rear. We were then so close to the
counter that the cries of "Death, death," rang over our heads. A
voice on the poop said furiously in English, "Stand fast, men."
Next moment, we, too, rounded the quarter only twenty feet behind
the big boat, but with a slightly wider sweep.</p>
<p>I said, "Have the pistols ready, Seraphina." And she answered
quite steadily:</p>
<p>"They are ready, Juan."</p>
<p>I could not have believed that any handiwork of man afloat
could have got so much way through the water. To this very day I
am not rid of the absurd impression that, at that particular
moment, the dinghy was travelling with us as fast as a
cannon-ball. No sooner round than we were upon them. We were upon
them so fast that I had barely the time to fling away my oar, and
close my grip on the butt of the pistols Seraphina pressed into
my hand from behind. Castro, too, had dropped his oar, and,
turning as swift as a cat, crouched in the bows. I saw his good
arm darting out towards their boat.</p>
<p>They had cast a grapnel cleverly, and, swung abreast of the
main chains, were grimly busied in boarding the undefended side
in silence. One had already his leg over the ship's rail, and
below him three more were clambering resolutely, one above the
other. The rest of them, standing up in a body with their faces
to the ship, were so oblivious of everything in their purpose,
that they staggered all together to the shock of the dinghy,
heavily, as if the earth had reeled under them.</p>
<p>Castro knew what he was doing. I saw his only hand hop along
the gunwale, dragging our cockle-shell forward very swiftly. The
tottering Spaniards turned their heads, and for a moment we
looked at each other in silence.</p>
<p>I was too excited to shout; the surprise seemed to have
deprived them of their senses, and they all had the same grin of
teeth closed upon the naked blades of their knives, the same
stupid stare fastened upon my eyes. I pulled the trigger in the
nearest face, and the terrific din of the fight going on above us
was overpowered by the report of the pistol, as if by a clap of
thunder. The man's gaping mouth dropped the knife, and he stood
stiffly long enough for the thought, "I've missed him," to flash
through my mind before he tumbled clean out of the boat without
touching anything, like a wooden dummy tipped by the heels. His
headlong fall sent the water flying high over the stern of the
dinghy. With the second barrel I took a long shot at the man
sitting amazed, astride of the rail above. I saw him double up
suddenly, and fall inboard sideways, but the fellow following him
made a convulsive effort, and leapt out of sight on to the deck
of the ship. I dropped the discharged weapon, and fired the first
barrel of the other at the upper of the two men clinging halfway
up the ship's side. To that one shot they both vanished as if by
enchantment, the fellow I had hit knocking off his friend below.
The crash of their fall was followed by a great yell.</p>
<p>These had been all nearly point-blank shots, and, anyhow, I
had had a good deal of pistol practice. Macdonald had a little
gallery at Horton Pen. The <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>, huddled
together in the boat, were only able to moan with terror. They
made soft, pitiful, complaining noises. Two or three took headers
overboard, like so many frogs, and then one began to squeak
exactly like a rat.</p>
<p>By that time, Castro, with his fixed blade, had cut their
grapnel rope close to the ring. As the ship kept forging ahead
all the time, the boat of the pirate bumped away lightly from
between the vessel and our dinghy, and we remained alongside,
holding to the end of the severed line. I sent my fourth shot
after them and got in exchange a scream and a howl of "Mercy!
mercy! we surrender!" She swung clear of the quarter, all hushed,
and faded into the mist and moonlight, with the head and arms of
a motionless man hanging grotesquely over the bows.</p>
<p>Leaving Seraphina with Castro, and sticking the remaining pair
of pistols in my belt, I swarmed up the rope. The moon, the
lights of several lanthorns, the glare from the open doors,
mingled violently in the steamy fog between the high bulwarks of
the ship. But the character of the contest was changing, even as
I paused on the rail to get my bearings. The fellow who had leapt
on board to escape my shot had bolted across the deck to his
friends on the other side, yelling:</p>
<p>"Fly, fly! The heretics are coming, shooting from the sea. All
is lost. Fly, oh fly!"</p>
<p>He had jumped straight overboard, but the infection of his
panic was already visible. The cries of "<i>Muerte, muerte!</i>
Death, death!" had ceased, and the Englishmen were cheering
ferociously. In a moment, under my eyes, the seamen, who had been
holding their own with difficulty in a shower of defensive blows,
began to dart forward, striking out with their fists, catching
with their hands. I jumped upon the main hatch, and found myself
in the skirt ef the final rush.</p>
<p>A tall <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> had possessed himself of one of
the ship's capstan bars, and, less craven than the others, was
flourishing it on high, aiming at the head of a sailor engaged in
throttling a negro whom he held at the full length of his immense
arms. I fired, and the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> tumbled down with
all the appearance of having knocked himself over with the bar he
had that moment uplifted. It rested across his neck as he lay
stretched at my feet.</p>
<p>I was not able to effect anything more after this, because the
sailor, after rushing his limp antagonist overboard with terrific
force, turned raging for more, caught sight of me&mdash;an
evident stranger&mdash;and flew at my throat. He was English, but
as he squeezed my windpipe so hard that I couldn't utter a word I
brought the butt of my pistol upon his thick skull without the
slightest compunction, for, indeed, I had to deal with a powerful
man, well able to strangle me with his bare hands, and very
determined to achieve the feat. He grunted under the blow, reeled
away a few steps, then, charging back at once, gripped me round
the body, and tried to lift me off my feet. We fell together into
a warm puddle.</p>
<p>I had no idea spilt blood kept its warmth so much. And the
quantity of it was appalling; the deck seemed to swim with gore,
and we simply weltered in it. We rolled rapidly along the reeking
scuppers, amongst the feet of a lot of men who were hopping about
us in the greatest excitement, the hearty thuds of blows, aimed
with all sorts of weapons, just missing my head. The pistol was
kicked out of my hand.</p>
<p>The horror of my position was very great. Must I kill the man?
must I die myself in this miserable and senseless manner? I tried
to shout, "Drag this maniac off me."</p>
<p>He was pinning my arms to my body. I saw the furious faces
bending over me, the many hands murderously uplifted. They, of
course, couldn't tell that I wasn't one of the men who had
boarded them, and my life had never been in such jeopardy. I felt
all the fury of rage and mortification. Was I to die like this,
villainously trodden underfoot, on the threshold of safety, of
liberty, of love? And, in those moments of violent struggle I
saw, as one sees in moments of wisdom and meditation, my
soul&mdash;all life, lying under the shadow of a perfidious
destiny. And Seraphina was there in the boat, waiting for me. The
sea! The boat! They were in another land, and I, I should no
more...never any more... A sharp voice called, "Back there, men.
Steady. Take him alive." They dragged me up.</p>
<p>I needn't relate by what steps, from being terribly handled as
a captive, I was promoted to having my arms shaken off in the
character of a saviour. But I got any amount of praise at last,
though I was terribly out of breath&mdash;at the very last gasp,
as you might say. A man, smooth-faced, well-knit, very elated and
buoyant, began talking to me endlessly. He was mighty happy, and
anyhow he could talk to me, because I was past doing anything but
taking a moment's rest. He said I had come in the nick of time,
and was quite the best of fellows.</p>
<p>"If you had a fancy to be called the Archbishop of Canterbury,
we'd 'your Grace' you. I am the mate, Sebright. The captain's
gone in to show himself to the missus; she wouldn't like to have
him too much chipped...Wonderful is the love of woman. She sat up
a bit later to-night with her fancy-sewing to see what might turn
up. I told her at tea-time she had better go in early and shut
her stateroom door, because if any of the Dagos chanced to come
aboard, I couldn't be responsible for the language of my crowd.
We are supposed to keep clear of profanity this trip, she being a
niece of Mr. Perkins of Bristol, our owner, and a Methodist. But,
hang it all, there's reason in all things. You can't have a ship
like a chapel&mdash;though <i>she</i> would. Oh, bless you, she
would, even when we're beating off these picaroons."</p>
<p>I was sitting on the afterhatch, and leaning my head on my
arms.</p>
<p>"Feel bad? Do you? Handled you like a bag of shavings. Well,
the boys got their monkey up, hammering the Dagos. Here you,
Mike, go look along the deck, for a double-barrelled pistol. Move
yourself a bit. Feel along under the spars."</p>
<p>There was something authoritative and knowing in his
personality; boyishly elated and full of business.</p>
<p>"We must put the ship to rights. You don't think they'd come
back for another taste? The blessed old deck's afloat. That's my
little dodge, boiling water for these Dagos, if they come. So I
got the cook to fire up, and we put the suction-hose of the fire
pump into the boiler, and we filled the coppers and the kettles.
Not a bad notion, eh? But ten times as much wouldn't have been
enough, and the hose burst at the third stroke, so that only one
boat got anything to speak of. But Lord, <i>she</i> dropped out
of the ruck as if she'd been swept with langridge. Squealed like
a litter of pigs, didn't they?"</p>
<p>What I had taken for blood had been the water from the burst
hose. I must say I was relieved. My new friend babbled any amount
of joyous information into me before I quite got my wind back. He
rubbed his hands and clapped me on the shoulder. But his heart
was kind, and he became concerned at my collapsed state.</p>
<p>"I say, you don't think my chaps broke some of your ribs, do
you? Let me feel."</p>
<p>And then I managed to tell him something of Seraphina that he
would listen to.</p>
<p>"What, what?" he said. "Oh, heavens and earth! there's your
girl. Of course...Hey, bo'sun, rig a whip and chair on the
yardarm to take a lady on board. Bear a hand. A lady! yes, a
lady. Confound it, don't lose your wits, man. Look over the
starboard rail, and you will see a lady alongside with a Dago in
a small boat. Let the Dago come on board, too; the gentleman here
says he's a good sort. Now, do you understand?"</p>
<p>He talked to me a good deal more; told me that they had made a
prisoner&mdash;"a tall, comical chap; wears his hair like an old
aunt of mine, a bunch of curls flapping on each side of his
face"&mdash;and then said that he must go and report to Captain
Williams, who had gone into his wife's stateroom. The name struck
me. I said:</p>
<p>"Is this ship the <i>Lion?</i>"</p>
<p>"Aye, aye. That's her. She is," several seamen answered
together, casting curious glances from their work.</p>
<p>"Tell your captain my name is Kemp," I shouted after Sebright
with what strength of lung I had.</p>
<p>What luck! Williams was the jolly little ship's captain I was
to have dined with on the day of execution on Kingston
Point&mdash;the day I had been kidnapped. It seemed ages ago. I
wanted to get to the side to look after Seraphina, but I simply
couldn't remember how to stand. I sat on the hatch, looking at
the seamen.</p>
<p>They were clearing the ropes, collecting the lamps, picking up
knives, handspikes, crowbars, swabbing the decks with squashy
flaps. A bare-footed, bare-armed fellow, holding a bundle of
brass-hilted cutlasses under his arm, had lost himself in the
contemplation of my person.</p>
<p>"Where are you bound to?" I inquired at large, and everybody
showed a friendly alacrity in answer.</p>
<p>"Havana." "Havana, sir." "Havana's our next port. Aye,
Havana."</p>
<p>The deck rang with modulations of the name.</p>
<p>I heard a loud, "Alas," sighed out behind me. A distracted,
stricken voice repeated twice in Spanish, "Oh, my greatness; oh,
my greatness." Then, shiveringly, in a tone of profound
self-communion, "I have a greatly parched throat," it said.
Harshly jovial voices answered:</p>
<p>"Stow your lingo and come before the captain. Step along."</p>
<p>A prisoner, conducted aft, stalked reluctantly into the light
between two short, bustling sailors. Dishevelled black hair like
a damaged peruke, mournful, yellow face, enormous stag's eyes
straining down on me. I recognized Manuel-del-Popolo. At the same
moment he sprang back, shrieking, "This is a miracle of the
devil&mdash;of the devil."</p>
<p>The sailors fell to tugging at his arms savagely, asking,
"What's come to you?" and, after a short struggle that shook his
tatters and his raven locks tempestuously like a gust of wind, he
submitted to be walked up repeating:</p>
<p>"Is it you, Se&ntilde;or? Is it you? Is it <i>you?</i>"</p>
<p>One of his shoulders was bare from neck to elbow; at every
step one of his knees and part of a lean thigh protruded their
nakedness through a large rent; a strip of grimy, blood-stained
linen, torn right down to the waist, dangled solemnly in front of
his legs. There was a horrible raw patch amongst the roots of his
hair just above his temple; there was blood in his nostrils, the
stamp of excessive anguish on his features, a sort of guarded
despair in his eye. His voice sank while he said again,
twice:</p>
<p>"Is it you? Is it you?" And then, for the last time, "Is it
you?" he repeated in a whisper.</p>
<p>The seamen formed a wide ring, and, looking at me, he talked
to himself confidentially.</p>
<p>"Escaped&mdash;the <i>Inglez!</i> Then thou art doomed,
Domingo. Domingo, thou art doomed. Dom...Se&ntilde;or!"</p>
<p>The change of tone, his effort to extend his hands towards me,
surprised us all. I looked away.</p>
<p>"Hold hard! Hold him, mate!"</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, condescend to behold my downfall. I am led here
to the slaughter, Se&ntilde;or! To the slaughter, Se&ntilde;or!
Pity! Grace! Mercy! And only a short while ago&mdash;behold.
Slaughter...I...Manuel. Se&ntilde;or, I am universally
admired&mdash;with a parched throat, Se&ntilde;or. I could
compose a song that would make a priest weep...A greatly parched
throat, Se&ntilde;or," he added piteously.</p>
<p>I could not help turning my head. I had not been used half as
hard as he. It was enough to look at him to believe in the
dryness of his throat. Under the matted mass of his hair, he was
grinning in amiable agony, and his globular eyes yearned upon me
with a motionless and glassy lustre.</p>
<p>"You have not forgotten me, Se&ntilde;or? Forget Manuel!
Impossible! Manuel, Se&ntilde;or. For the love of God. Manuel.
Manuel-del-Popolo. I did sing, deign to remember. I offered you
my fidelity, Se&ntilde;or. As you are a <i>caballero</i>, I
charge you to remember. Save me, Se&ntilde;or. Speak to those
men...For the sake of your honour, Se&ntilde;or."</p>
<p>His voice was extraordinarily harsh&mdash;not his own.
Apparently, he believed that he was going to be cut to pieces
there and then by the sailors. He seemed to read it in their
faces, shuddering and shrinking whenever he raised his eyes. But
all these faces gaped with good-natured wonder, except the faces
of his two guardians, and these expressed a state of
conscientious worry. They were ridiculously anxious to suppress
his sudden contortions, as one would some gross indecency. In the
scuffle they hissed and swore under their breath. They were
scandalized and made unhappy by his behaviour.</p>
<p>"Are you ready down there?" roared the bo'sun in the
waist.</p>
<p>"Olla raight! Olla raight! Waita a leetle," I heard Castro's
voice coming, as if from under the ship. I said coldly a few
words about the certain punishment awaiting a pirate in Havana,
and got on to my feet stiffly. But Manuel was too terrified to
understand what I meant. He attempted to snatch at me with his
imprisoned hands, and got for his pains a severe jerking, which
made his head roll about his shoulders weirdly.</p>
<p>"Pity, Se&ntilde;or!" he screamed. And then, with low fervour,
"Don't go away. Listen! I am profound. Perhaps the Se&ntilde;or
did not know that? Mercy! I am a man of intrigue. A
<i>politico</i>. You have escaped, and I rejoice at it."...He
bared his fangs, and frothed like a mad dog..."Se&ntilde;or, I am
made happy because of the love I bore you from the
first&mdash;and Domingo, who let you slip out of the Casa, is
doomed. He is doomed. Thou art doomed, Domingo! But the excessive
affection for your noble person inspires my intellect with a
salutary combination. Wait, Se&ntilde;or! A moment! An
instant!...A combination!..."</p>
<p>He gasped as though his heart had burst. The seamen,
open-mouthed, were slowly narrowing their circle.</p>
<p>"Can't he gabble!" remarked someone patiently.</p>
<p>His eyes were starting out of his head. He spoke with fearful
rapidity.</p>
<p>"...There's no refuge from the anger of the <i>Juez</i> but
the grave&mdash;the grave&mdash;the grave!...Ha! ha! Go into thy
grave, Domingo. But you, Se&ntilde;or&mdash;listen to my
supplications&mdash;where will you go? To Havana. The <i>Juez</i>
is there, and I call the malediction of the priests on my head if
you, too, are not doomed. Life! Liberty! Se&ntilde;or, let me go,
and I shall run&mdash;I shall ride, Se&ntilde;or&mdash;I shall
throw myself at the feet of the <i>Juez</i>, and say...I shall
say I killed you. I am greatly trusted by the reason of my
superior intelligence. I shall say, 'Domingo let him go&mdash;but
he is dead. Think of him no more&mdash;of that <i>Inglez</i> who
escaped&mdash;from Domingo. Do not look for him. I, your own
Manuel, have killed him.' Give me my life for yours,
Se&ntilde;or. I shall swear I had killed you with this right
hand! Ah!"</p>
<p>He hung on my lips breathless, with a face so distorted that,
though it might have been death alone he hated, he looked,
indeed, as if impatient to set to and tear me to pieces with his
long teeth. Men clutching at straws must have faces thus
convulsed by an eager and despairing hope. His silence removed
the spell&mdash;the spell of his incredible loquacity. I heard
the boatswain's hoarse tones:</p>
<p>"Hold on well, ma'am. Right! Walk away steady with that
whip!"</p>
<p>I ran limping forward.</p>
<p>"High enough," he rumbled; and I received Seraphina into my
arms. <a name="2HCH0022"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>I said, "This is home, at last. It is all over"; and she stood
by me on the deck. She pushed the heavy black cloak from over her
head, and her white face appeared above the dim black shadow of
her mourning. She looked silently round her on the mist, the
groups of rough men, the spatterings of light that were like
violence, too. She said nothing, but rested her hand on my
arm.</p>
<p>She had her immense griefs, and this was the home I offered
her. She looked back at the side. I thought she would have liked
to be in the boat again. I said:</p>
<p>"The people in this ship are my old friends. You can trust
them&mdash;and me."</p>
<p>Tomas Castro, clambering leisurely over the side, followed. As
soon as his feet touched the deck, he threw the corner of his
cloak across his left shoulder, bent down half the rim of his
hat, and assumed the appearance of a short, dark conspirator,
overtopped by the stalwart sailors, who had abandoned Manuel to
crowd, bare-armed, bare-chested, pushing, and craning their
necks, round us.</p>
<p>She said, "I can trust you; it is my duty to trust you, and
this is now my home."</p>
<p>It was like a definite pronouncement of faith&mdash;and of a
line of policy. She seemed, for that moment, quite apart from my
love, a thing very much above me and mine; closed up in an
immense grief, but quite whole-souledly determined to go
unflinchingly into a new life, breaking quietly with all her past
for the sake of the traditions of all that past.</p>
<p>The sailors fell back to make way for us. It was only by the
touch of her hand on my arm that I had any hope that she trusted
me, me personally, and apart from the commands of the dead
Carlos; the dead father, and the great weight of her dead
traditions that could be never anything any more for
her&mdash;except a memory. Ah, she stood it very well; her head
was erect and proud. The cabin door opened, and a rigid female
figure with dry outlines, and a smooth head, stood out with
severe simplicity against the light of the cabin door. The light
falling on Seraphina seemed to show her for the first time. A
lamentable voice bellowed:</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita!...Se&ntilde;orita!" and then, in an
insinuating, heart-breaking tone, "Se&ntilde;orita!..."</p>
<p>She walked quietly past the figure of the woman, and
disappeared in the brilliant light of the cabin. The door closed.
I remained standing there. Manuel, at her disappearance, raised
his voice to a tremendous, incessant yell of despair, as if he
expected to make her hear.</p>
<p>"<i>Se&ntilde;orita...proteccion del opprimido; oh, hija de
piedad... Se&ntilde;orita</i>."</p>
<p>His lamentable noise brought half the ship round us; the
sailors fell back before the mate, Sebright, walking at the elbow
of a stout man in loose trousers and jacket. They stopped.</p>
<p>"An unexpected meeting, Captain Williams," was all I found to
say to him. He had a constrained air, and shook hands in awkward
silence.</p>
<p>"How do you do?" he said hurriedly. After a moment he added,
with a sort of confused, as if official air, "I hope, Kemp,
you'll be able to explain satisfactorily..."</p>
<p>I said, rather off-handedly, "Why, the two men I killed ought
to be credentials enough for all immediate purposes!"</p>
<p>"That isn't what I meant," he said. He spoke rather with a
mumble, and apologetically. It was difficult to see in him any
trace of the roystering Williams who had roared toasts to my
health in Jamaica, after the episode at the Ferry Inn with the
admiral. It was as if, now, he had a weight on his mind. I was
tired. I said:</p>
<p>"Two dead men is more than you or any of your crew can show.
And, as far as I can judge, you did no more than hold your own
till I came."</p>
<p>He positively stuttered, "Yes, yes. But..."</p>
<p>I got angry with what seemed stupid obstinacy.</p>
<p>"You'd be having a rope twisted tight round your head, or
red-hot irons at the soles of your feet, at this very moment, if
it had not been for us," I said indignantly.</p>
<p>He wiped his forehead perplexedly. "Phew, how you do talk!" he
remonstrated. "What I mean is that my wife..." He stopped again,
then went on. "She took it into her head to come with me this
voyage. For the first time...And you two coming alone in an open
boat like this! It's what she isn't used to."</p>
<p>I simply couldn't get at what he meant; I couldn't even hear
him very well, because Manuel-del-Popolo was still calling out to
Seraphina in the cabin. Williams and I looked at each
other&mdash;he embarrassed, and I utterly confounded.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Williams thinks it's irregular," Sebright broke in, "you
and your young lady being alone&mdash;in an open boat at night,
and that sort of thing. It isn't what they approve of at
Bristol."</p>
<p>Manuel suddenly bellowed out, "Se&ntilde;orita&mdash;save me
from their barbarity. I am a victim. Behold their bloody knives
ready&mdash;and their eyes which gloat."</p>
<p>He shrank convulsively from the fellow with the bundle of
cutlasses under his arm, who innocently pushed his way close to
him; he threw himself forward, the two sailors hung back on his
arms, nearly sitting on the deck, and he strained dog-like in his
intense fear of immediate death. Williams, however, really seemed
to want an answer to his absurdity that I could not take very
seriously. I said:</p>
<p>"What do you expect us to do? Go back to our boat, or
what?"</p>
<p>It seemed to affect him a good deal. "Wait till you are caught
by a good woman yourself," he mumbled wretchedly.</p>
<p>Was this the roystering Williams? The jolly good fellow? I
wanted to laugh, a little hysterically, because of the worry
after great fatigue. Was his wife such a terrifying virago? "A
good woman," Williams insisted. I turned my eyes to Sebright, who
looked on amusedly.</p>
<p>"It's all right," he answered my questioning look. "She's a
good soul, but she doesn't see fellows like us in the
congregation she worships with at home." Then he whispered in my
ear, "Owner's niece. Older than the skipper. Married him for
love. Suspects every woman&mdash;every man, too, by George,
except me, perhaps. She's learned life in some back chapel in
Bristol. What can you expect? You go straight into the cabin," he
added.</p>
<p>At that moment the cabin door opened again, and the figure of
the woman I had seen before reappeared against the light.</p>
<p>"I was allowed to stand under the gate of the Casa,
Excellency, I was in very truth. Oh, turn not the light of your
face from me." Manuel, who had been silent for a minute,
immediately recommenced his clamour in the hope, I suppose, that
it would reach Seraphina's ears, now the door was opened.</p>
<p>"What is to be done, Owen?" the woman asked, with a serenity I
thought very merciless.</p>
<p>She had precisely the air of having someone "in the house,"
someone rather questionable that you want, at home, to get rid
of, as soon as a very small charity permitted.</p>
<p>"Madam," I said rather coldly, "I appeal to your woman's
compassion..."</p>
<p>"Even thus the arch-enemy sets his snares," she retorted on me
a little tremulously.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita, I have seen you grow," Manuel called again.
"Your father, who is with the saints, gave me alms when I was a
boy. Will you let them kill a man to whom your father..."</p>
<p>"Snares. All snares. Can she be blessed in going away from her
natural guardians at night, alone, with a young man? How can we,
consistently with our duty..."</p>
<p>Her voice was cold and gentle. Even in the imperfect light her
appearance suggested something cold and monachal. The thought of
what she might have been saying, or, in the subtle way of women,
making Seraphina feel, in there, made me violently angry, but
lucid, too.</p>
<p>"She comes straight from the fresh grave of her father," I
said. "I am her only guardian."</p>
<p>Manuel rose to the height of his appeal. "Se&ntilde;orita, I
worshipped your childhood, I threw my hat in the air many times
before your coach, when you drove out all in white, smiling, an
angel from paradise. Excellency, help me. Excel..."</p>
<p>A hand was clapped on his mouth then, and we heard only a
great scuffle going on behind us. The way to the cozy cabin
remained barred. My heart was kindled by resentment, but by the
power of love my soul was made tranquil, for come what absurdity
might, I had Sera-phina safe for the time. The woman in the
doorway guarded the respectable ship's cuddy from the un-wedded
vagabondage of romance.</p>
<p>"What's to be done, Owen?" she asked again, but this time a
little irresolutely, I thought. "You know something of
this&mdash;but I..."</p>
<p>"My dear, what an idea," began Williams; and I heard his
helpless mutters, "Like a hero&mdash;one
evening&mdash;admiral&mdash;old Topnambo&mdash;nothing of
her&mdash;on my soul&mdash;Lord's son..."</p>
<p>Sebright spoke up from the side. "We could drive them
overboard together, certainly, Mrs. Williams, but that wouldn't
be quite proper, perhaps. Put them each in a bag, separately, and
drown them one on each side of the ship, decently..."</p>
<p>"You will not put me off with your ungodly levity, Mr.
Sebright."</p>
<p>"But I am perfectly serious, Mrs. Williams. It may raise a
mutiny amongst these horrid, profane sailors, but I really don't
see how we are to get rid of them else. The bo'sun has cut adrift
their ramshackle, old sieve of a boat, and she's now a quarter of
a mile astern, half-full of water. And we can't give them one of
the ship's boats to go and get their throats cut ashore. J.
Perkins, Esquire, wouldn't like it. He would swear something
awful, if the boat got lost. Now, don't say no, Mrs. Williams.
I've heard him myself swear a pound's worth of oaths for a matter
of tenpence. You know very well what your uncle is. A perfect
Turk in that way."</p>
<p>"Don't be scandalous, Mr. Sebright."</p>
<p>"But I didn't begin, Mrs. Williams. It's you who are raising
all this trouble for nothing; because, as a matter of fact, they
did not come alone. They had a man with them. An elderly, most
respectable man. There he stands yonder, with a feather in his
hat. Hey! You! <i>Se&ntilde;or caballero</i>, hidalgo,
Pedro&mdash;Miguel&mdash;Jos&eacute;&mdash;what's your particular
saint? Step this way a bit..."</p>
<p>Manuel managed to jerk a half-choked "Excellency," and Castro,
muffled up to the eyes, began to walk slowly aft, pausing after
each solemn stride. The dark woman in the doorway was as
effectual as an angel with a flaming sword. She paralyzed me
completely.</p>
<p>Sebright dropped his voice a little. "I don't see that's much
worse than going off at six o'clock in the morning to get married
on the quiet; all alone with a man in a hackney coach&mdash;you
know you did&mdash;and being given away by a perfect
stranger."</p>
<p>"Mr. Sebright! Be quiet! How dare you?...Owen!"</p>
<p>Williams made a vague, growling noise, but Sebright, after
muttering hurriedly, "It's all right, sir," proceeded with the
utmost coolness:</p>
<p>"Why, all Bristol knows it! There are those who said that you
got out of the scullery window into the back street. I am only
telling you..."</p>
<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself to believe such tales,"
she cried in great agitation. "I walked out at the gate!"</p>
<p>"Yes. And the gardener's wife said you must have sneaked the
key off the nail by the side of the cradle&mdash;coming to the
lodge the evening before, to see her poor, ailing baby. You ought
to know what love brings the best of us to. And your uncle isn't
a bloody-handed pirate either. He's only a good-hearted,
hard-swearing old heathen. And you, too, are good-hearted. Come,
Mrs. Williams. I know you're just longing to tuck this young lady
up in bed&mdash;poor thing. Think what she has gone through! You
ought to be fussing with sherry and biscuits and what
not&mdash;making that good-for-nothing steward fly round. The
beggar is hiding in the lazarette, I bet. Now then&mdash;allow
me."</p>
<p>I got hold of the matter there again. I said&mdash;because I
felt that the matter only needed making clear:</p>
<p>"This young lady is the daughter of a great Spanish noble. Her
father was killed by these pirates. I am myself of noble family,
and I am her appointed guardian, and am trying to save her from a
very horrible fate."</p>
<p>She looked at me apprehensively.</p>
<p>"You would be committing a wicked act to try to interfere with
this," I said.</p>
<p>I suppose I carried conviction.</p>
<p>"I must believe what you say," she said. She added suddenly,
with a sort of tremulous, warm feeling, "There, there. I don't
mean to be unkind. I knew nothing, and a married woman can't be
too careful. For all I could have told, you might have been
a&mdash;a libertine; one of the poor lost souls that
Satan..."</p>
<p>Manuel, as if struggling with the waves, managed to free his
lips.</p>
<p>"Excellency, help!" he spluttered, like a drowning man.</p>
<p>"I will give the young lady every care," Mrs. Williams said,
"until light shall be vouchsafed."</p>
<p>She shut the door.</p>
<p>"You will go too far, Sebright," Williams remonstrated; "and
I'll have to give you the sack."</p>
<p>"It's all right, captain. I can turn her round my little
finger," said the young man cheerily. "Somebody has to do it if
you won't&mdash;or can't. What shall we do with that yelping
Dago? He's a distressful beast to have about the decks."</p>
<p>"Put him in the coal-hole, I suppose, as far as Havana. I
won't rest till I see him on his way to the gallows. The
Captain-General shall be made sick of this business, or my name
isn't Williams. I'll make a breeze over it at home. You shall
help in that, Kemp. You ain't afraid of big-wigs. Not you. You
ain't afraid of anything..."</p>
<p>"He's a devil of a fellow, and a dead shot," threw in
Sebright. "And jolly lucky for us, too, sir. It's simply
marvellous that you should turn up like this, Mr. Kemp. We hadn't
a grain of powder that wasn't caked solid in the canisters.
Nothing'll take it out of my head that somebody had got at the
magazine while we lay in Kingston..."</p>
<p>It did not occur to Williams to ask whether I was wounded, or
tired, or hungry. And yet all through the West Indies the dinners
you got on board the Lion were famous in shipping circles. But
festive men of his stamp are often like that. They do it more for
the glory and romance of the hospitality, and he could not,
perhaps, under the circumstances, expect me to intone "for he is
a jolly good fellow" over the wine. He was by no means a bad or
unfeeling man; only he was not hungry himself, and another's mere
necessity of that sort failed to excite his imagination. I know
he was no worse than other men, and I have reason to remember him
with gratitude; but, at the time, I was surprised and indignant
at the extraordinary way he took my presence for granted, as if I
had come off casually in a shore boat to idle away an hour or two
on board. Since his wife appeared satisfied, he did not seem to
desire any explanation. I felt as if I had for him no independent
existence. When I had ceased to be a source of domestic
difficulty, I became a precious sort of convenience, a most
welcome person ("an English gentleman to back me up," he repeated
several times), who would help him to make "these old women at
the Admiralty sit up!" A burning shame, this! It had gone on long
enough, God knows, but if they were to tackle an old trader, like
the "Lion", now, it was time the whole country should hear of it.
His owner, J. Perkins, his wife's uncle, wasn't the man to go to
sleep over the job. Parliament should hear of it. Most fortunate
I was there to be produced&mdash;eye-witness&mdash;nobleman's
son. He knew I could speak up in a good cause.</p>
<p>"And by the way, Kemp," he said, with sudden annoyance,
recollecting himself, as it were, "you never turned up for that
dinner&mdash;sent no word, nor anything..."</p>
<p>Williams had been talking to me, but it was with Sebright that
I felt myself growing intimate. The young mate of the "Lion"
stood by, very quiet, listening with a capable smile. Now he
said, in a tone of dry comment:</p>
<p>"Jolly sight more useful turning up here."</p>
<p>"I was kidnapped away from Ramon's back shop, if that's a
sufficient apology. It's rather a long story."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't tell it on deck, that's very clear," Sebright
had to shout to me. "Not while this infernal noise&mdash;what the
deuce's up? It sounds more like a dog-fight than anything
else."</p>
<p>As we ran towards the main hatch I recognized the aptness of
the comparison. It was that sort of vicious, snarling, yelping
clamour which arises all at once and suddenly dies.</p>
<p>"Castro! Thou Castro!"</p>
<p>"Malediction...My eyelids..."</p>
<p>"Thou! Englishman's dog!"</p>
<p>"Ha! <i>Porco</i>."</p>
<p>The voices ceased. Castro ran tiptoeing lightly, mantled in
ample folds. He assumed his hat with a brave tap, crouched
swiftly inside his cloak. It touched the deck all round in a
black cone surmounted by a peering, quivering head. Quick as
thought he hopped and sank low again. Everybody watched with
wonder this play, as of some large and diabolic toy. For my part,
knowing the deadly purpose of these preliminaries, I was struck
with horror. Had he chosen to run on him at once, nothing could
have saved Manuel. The poor wretch, vigorously held in front of
Castro, was far too terrified to make a sound. With an immovable
sailor on each side, he scuffled violently, and cowered by starts
as if tied up between two stone posts. His dumb, rapid panting
was in our ears. I shouted:</p>
<p>"Stop, Castro! Stop!...Stop him, some of you! He means to kill
the fellow!"</p>
<p>Nobody heeded my shouting. Castro flung his cloak on the deck,
jumped on it, kicked it aside, all in the same moment as it
seemed, dodged to the right, to the left, drew himself up, and
stepped high, paunchy in his tight smalls and short jacket,
making all the time a low, sibilant sound, which was perfectly
blood-curdling.</p>
<p>"He has a blade on his forearm!" I yelled. "He's armed, I tell
you!"</p>
<p>No one could comprehend my distress. A sailor, raising a lamp,
had a broad smile. Somebody laughed outright. Castro planted
himself before Manuel, nodded menacingly, and stooped ready for a
spring. I was too late in my grab at his collar, but Manuel's
guardians, acting with precision, put out one arm each to meet
his rush, and he came flying backwards upon me, as though he had
rebounded from a wall.</p>
<p>He had almost knocked me down, and while I staggered to keep
my feet the air resounded with urgent calls to shoot, to fire, to
bring him down!... "Kill him, Se&ntilde;or!" came in an
entreating yell from Castro. And I became aware that Manuel had
taken this opportunity to wrench himself free. I heard the hard
thud of his leap. Straight from the hatch (as I was told later by
the marvelling sailors) he had alighted with both feet on the
rail. I only saw him already there, sitting on his heels,
jabbering and nodding at us like an enormous baboon. "Shoot, sir!
Shoot!" "Kill! Kill, Se&ntilde;or! As you love your
life&mdash;kill!"</p>
<p>Unwittingly, without volition, as if compelled by the
suggestion of the bloodthirsty cries, my hand drew the remaining
pistol out of my belt. I raised it, and found myself covering the
strange antics of an infuriated ape. He tore at his flanks with
both hands in the idea, I suppose, of stripping for a swim. Rags
flew from him in all directions; an astounding eruption of rags
round a huddled-up figure crouching, wildly active, in front of
the muzzle. I had him. I was sure of my shot. He was only an ape.
A dead ape. But why? Wherefore? To what end? What could it matter
whether he lived or died. He sickened me, and I pitied him, as I
should have pitied an ape.</p>
<p>I lowered my arm an almost imperceptible fraction of a second
before he sprang up and vanished. The sound of the heavy plunge
was followed by a regretful clamour all over the decks, and a
general rush to the side. There was nothing to be seen; he had
gone through the layer of fog covering the water. No one heard
him blow or splutter. It was as if a lump of lead had fallen
overboard.</p>
<p>Williams wouldn't have had this happen for a five-pound note.
Sebright expressed the hope that he wouldn't cheat the gallows by
drowning. The two men who had held him slunk away abashed. To
lower a boat for the purpose of catching him in the water would
have been useless and imprudent.</p>
<p>"His friends can't be far off yet in the boats," growled the
bo'sun; "and if they don't pick him up, they would be more than
likely to pick up our chaps."</p>
<p>Somebody expectorated in so marked a manner that I looked
behind me. Castro had resumed his cloak, and was draping himself
with deliberate dignity. When this undertaking had been
accomplished, he came up very close to me, and without a word
looked up balefully from the heavy folds thrown across his mouth
and chin under the very tip of his hooked nose.</p>
<p>"I could not do it," I said. "I could not. It would have been
useless. Too much like murder, Tomas."</p>
<p>"Oh! the inconstancy, the fancifulness of these English," he
generalized, with suppressed passion, right into my face. "I
don't know what's worse, their fury or their pity. The
childishness of it! The childishness...Do you imagine,
Se&ntilde;or, that Manuel or the Juez O'Brien shall some day
spare you in their turn? If I didn't know the courage of your
nation..."</p>
<p>"I despise the <i>Juez</i> and Manuel alike," I interrupted
angrily. I despised Castro, too, at that moment, and he paid me
back with interest. There was no mistaking his scathing tone.</p>
<p>"I know you well. You scorn your friends, as well as your
foes. I have seen so many of you. The blessed saints guard us
from the calamity of your friendship..."</p>
<p>"No friendship could make an assassin of me, Mr.
Castro..."</p>
<p>"...Which is only a very little less calamitous than your
enmity," he continued, in a cold rage. "A very little less. You
let Manuel go... Manuel!...Because of your mercy...Mercy! Bah! It
is all your pride&mdash;your mad pride. You shall rue it,
Se&ntilde;or. Heaven is just. You shall rue it,
Se&ntilde;or."</p>
<p>He denounced me prophetically, wrapped up with an air of
midnight secrecy; but, after all, he had been a friend in the
act, if not in the spirit, and I contented myself by asking, with
some pity for his imbecile craving after murder:</p>
<p>"Why? What can Manuel do to me? He at least is completely
helpless."</p>
<p>"Did the Se&ntilde;or Don Juan ever ask himself what Manuel
could do to me&mdash;Tomas Castro? To me, who am poor and a
vagabond, and a friend of Don Carlos, may his soul rest with God.
Are all you English like princes that you should never think of
anybody but yourselves?"</p>
<p>He revolted and provoked me, as if his opinion of the English
could matter, or his point of view signify anything against the
authority of my conscience. And it is our conscience that
illumines the romantic side of our life. His point of view was as
benighted and primitive as the point of view of hunger; but, in
his fidelity to the dead architect of my fortunes, he reflected
dimly the light of Carlos' romance, and I had taken advantage of
it, not so much for the saving of my life as for the guarding of
my love. I had reached that point when love displaces one's
personality, when it becomes the only ground under our feet, the
only sky over our head, the only light of vision, the first
condition of thought&mdash;when we are ready to strive for it, as
we fight for the breath of our body. Brusquely I turned my back
on him, and heard the repeated clicking of flint against his
blade. He lighted a cigarette, and crossed the deck to lean
cloaked against the bulwark, smoking moodily under his slouched
hat. <a name="2HCH0023"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>Manuel's escape was the last event of that memorable night.
Nothing more happened, and nothing more could be done; but there
remained much talk and wonderment to get through. I did all the
talking, of course, under the cuddy lamps. Williams, red and
stout, sat staring at me across the table. His round eyes were
perfectly motionless with astonishment&mdash;the story of what
had happened in the Casa Riego was not what he had expected of
the small, badly reputed Cuban town.</p>
<p>Sebright, who had all the duties of the soiled ship and
chipped men to attend to, came in from the deck several times,
and would stand listening for minutes with his fingers playing
thoughtfully about his slight moustache. The dawn was not very
far when he led me into his own cabin. I was half dead with
fatigue, and troubled by an inward restlessness.</p>
<p>"Turn in into my berth," said Sebright.</p>
<p>I protested with a stiff tongue, but he gave me a friendly
push, and I tumbled like a log on to the bedclothes. As soon as
my head felt the pillow the fresh colouring of his face appeared
blurred, and an arm, mistily large, was extended to put out the
light of the lamp screwed to the bulkhead.</p>
<p>"I suppose you know there are warrants out in Jamaica against
you&mdash;for that row with the admiral," he said.</p>
<p>An irresistible and unexpected drowsiness had relaxed all my
limbs.</p>
<p>"Hang Jamaica!" I said, with difficult animation. "We are
going home."</p>
<p>"Hang Jamaica!" he agreed. Then, in the dark, as if coming
after me across the obscure threshold of sleep, his voice
meditated, "I am sorry, though, we are bound for Havana. Pity.
Great pity! Has it occurred to you, Mr. Kemp, that..."</p>
<p>It is very possible that he did not finish his sentence; no
more penetrated, at least, into my drowsy ear. I awoke slowly
from a trance-like sleep, with a confused notion of having to
pick up the thread of a dropped hint. I went up on deck.</p>
<p>The sun shone, a faint breeze blew, the sea sparkled freshly,
and the wet decks glistened. I stood still, touched by the new
glory of light falling on me; it was a new world&mdash;new and
familiar, yet disturbingly beautiful. I seemed to discover all
sorts of secret charms that I had never seen in things I had seen
a hundred times. The watch on deck were busy with brooms and
buckets; a sailor, coiling a rope over a pin, paused in his work
to point over the port-quarter, with a massive fore-arm like a
billet of red mahogany.</p>
<p>I looked about, rubbing my eyes. The "Lion", close hauled, was
heading straight away from the coast, which stood out, not very
far yet, outlined heavily and flooded with light. Astern, and to
leeward of us, against a headland of black and indigo, a dazzling
white speck resembled a snowflake fallen upon the blue of the
sea.</p>
<p>"That's a schooner," said the seaman.</p>
<p>They were the first words I heard that morning, and their
friendly hoarseness brushed away whatever of doubt might seem to
mar the inexplicability of my new glow of my happiness. It was
because we were safe&mdash;she and I&mdash;and because my
undisturbed love let my heart open to the beauty of the young day
and the joyousness of a splendid sea. I took deep breaths, and my
eyes went all over the ship, embracing, like an affectionate
contact, her elongated shape, the flashing brasses, the tall
masts, the gentle curves of her sails soothed into perfect
stillness by the wind. I felt that she was a shrine, for was not
Seraphina sleeping in her, as safe as a child in its cradle? And
presently the beauty, the serenity, the purity, and the splendour
of the world would be reflected in her clear eyes, and made over
to me by her glance.</p>
<p>There are times when an austere and just Providence, in its
march along the inscrutable way, brings our hearts to the test of
their own unreason. Which of us has not been tried by irrational
awe, fear, pride, abasement, exultation? And such moments remain
marked by indelible physical impressions, standing out of the
ghostly level of memory like rocks out of the sea, like towers on
a plain. I had many of these unforgettable emotions&mdash;the
profound horror of Don Balthasar's death; the first floating of
the boat, like the opening of wings in space; the first
fluttering of the flames in the fog&mdash;many others afterwards,
more cruel, more terrible, with a terror worse than death, in
which the very suffering was lost; and also this&mdash;this
moment of elation in the clear morning, as if the universe had
shed its glory upon my feelings as the sunshine glorifies the
sea. I laughed in very lightness of heart, in a profound sense of
success; I laughed, irresponsible and oblivious, as one laughs in
the thrilling delight of a dream.</p>
<p>"Do I look so confoundedly silly?" asked Sebright, speaking as
though he had a heavy cold. "I am stupid&mdash;tired. I've been
on my feet this twenty-four hours&mdash;about the liveliest in my
life, too. You haven't slept very long either&mdash;none of us
have. I'm sure I hope your young lady has rested."</p>
<p>He put his hands in his pockets. He might have been very
tired, but I had never seen a boy fresh out of bed with a rosier
face. The black pin-points of his pupils seemed to bore through
distance, exploring the horizon beyond my shoulder. The man
called Mike, the one I had had the tussle with overnight, came up
behind the indefatigable mate, and shyly offered me my pistol.
His head was bound over the top, and under the chin, as if for
toothache, and his bronzed, rough-hewn face looked out
astonishingly through the snowy whiteness of the linen. Only a
few hours before, we had been doing our best to kill each other.
In my cordial glow, I bantered him light-heartedly about his
ferocity and his strength.</p>
<p>He stood before me, patiently rubbing the brown instep of one
thick foot with the horny sole of the other.</p>
<p>"You paid me off for that bit, sir," he said bashfully. "It
was in the way of duty."</p>
<p>"I'm uncommon glad you didn't squeeze the ghost out of me," I
said; "a morning like this is enough to make you glad you can
breathe."</p>
<p>To this day I remember the beauty of that rugged, grizzled,
hairy seaman's eyelashes. They were long and thick, shadowing the
eyes softly like the lashes of a young girl.</p>
<p>"I'm sure, sir, we wish you luck&mdash;to you and the young
lady&mdash;all of us," he said shamefacedly; and his bass,
half-concealed mutter was quite as sweet to my ears as a
celestial melody; it was, after all, the sanction of simple
earnestness to my desires and hopes&mdash;a witness that he and
his like were on my side in the world of romance.</p>
<p>"Well, go forward now, Mike," Sebright said, as I took the
pistol.</p>
<p>"It's a blessing to talk to one's own people," I said,
expansively, to him. "He's a fine fellow." I stuck the pistol in
my belt. "I trust I shall never need to use barrel or butt again,
as long as I live."</p>
<p>"A very sensible wish," Sebright answered, with a sort of
reserve of meaning in his tone; "especially as on board here we
couldn't find you a single pinch of powder for a priming. Do you
notice the consort we have this morning?"</p>
<p>"What do I want with powder?" I asked. "Do you mean that?" I
pointed to the white sail of the schooner. Sebright, looking hard
at me, nodded several times.</p>
<p>"We sighted her as soon as day broke. D'you know what she
means?"</p>
<p>I said I supposed she was a coaster.</p>
<p>"It means, most likely, that the fellow with the curls that
made me think of my maiden aunt, has managed to keep his
horse-face above water." He meant Manuel-del-Popolo. "What
mischief he may do yet before he runs his head into a noose, it's
hard to say. The old Spaniard you brought with you thinks he has
already been busy&mdash;for no good, you may be sure."</p>
<p>"You mean that's one of the Rio schooners?" I asked
quickly.</p>
<p>That, with all its consequent troubles forme, was what he did
mean. He said I might take his word for it that, with the winds
we had had, no craft working along the coast could be just there
now unless she came out of Rio Medio. There was a calm almost up
to sunrise, and it looked as if they had towed her out with boats
before daylight..."Seems a rather unlikely bit of exertion for
the lazy brutes; but if they are as much afraid of that
confounded Irishman as you say they are, that would account for
their energy."</p>
<p>They would steal and do murder simply for the love of God, but
it would take the fear of a devil to make them do a bit of honest
work&mdash;and pulling an oar <i>was</i> honest work, no matter
why it was done. This was the combined wisdom of Sebright and of
Tomas Castro, with whom he had been in consultation. As to the
fear of the devil, O'Brien was very much like a devil, an
efficient substitute. And there was certainly somebody or
something to make them bestir themselves like this...</p>
<p>Before my mind arose a scene: Manuel, the night before, pulled
out of the water into a boat&mdash;raging, half-drowned,
eloquent, inspired. The contemptible beast <i>was</i> inspired,
as a politician is, a demagogue. He could sway his fellows, as I
had heard enough to know. And I felt a slight chill on the warmth
of my hope, because that bright sail, brilliantly and furtively
dodging along in our wake, must be the product of Manuel's
inspiration, urged to perseverance by the fear of O'Brien. The
mate continued, staring knowingly at it:</p>
<p>"You know I am putting two and two together, like the old
maids that come to see my aunt when they want to take away a
woman's character. The Dagos are out and no mistake. The question
is, Why? You must know whether those schooners can sail anything;
but don't forget the old <i>Lion</i> is pretty smart. Is it
likely they'll attempt the ship again?"</p>
<p>I negatived that at once. I explained to Sebright that the
store of ammunition in Rio Medio would not run to it; that the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> were cowardly, divided by faction,
incapable, by themselves, of combining for any length of time,
and still less of following a plan requiring perseverance and
hardihood.</p>
<p>"They can't mean anything in the nature of open attack," I
affirmed. "They may have attempted something of the sort in
Nichols' time, but it isn't in their nature."</p>
<p>Sebright said that was practically Castro's opinion,
too&mdash;except that Castro had emphasized his remarks by
spitting all the time, "like an old tomcat. He seems a very
spiteful man, with no great love for you, Mr. Kemp. Do you think
it safe to have him about you? What are all these grievances of
his?"</p>
<p>Castro seemed to have spouted his bile like a volcano, and had
rather confused Sebright. He had said much about being a friend
of the Spanish lord&mdash;Carlos; and that now he had no place on
earth to hide his head.</p>
<p>"As far as I could make out, he's wanted in England," said
Sebright, "for some matter of a stolen watch, years ago in
Liverpool, I think. And your cousin, the grandee, was mixed up in
that, too. That sounds funny; you didn't tell us about that.
Damme if he didn't seem to imply that you, too...But you have
never been in Liverpool. Of course not..."</p>
<p>But that had not been precisely Castro's point. He had
affirmed he had enemies in Spain; he shuddered at the idea of
going to France, and now my English fancifulness had made it
impossible for him to live in Rio Medio, where he had had the
care of a good <i>pad-rona</i>.</p>
<p>"I suppose he means a landlady," Sebright chuckled. "Old but
good, he says. He expected to die there in peace, a good
Christian. And what's that about the priests getting hold of his
very last bit of silver? I must say that sounded truest of all
his rigmarole. For the salvation of his soul, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No, my cousin's soul," I said gloomily.</p>
<p>"Humbugs. I only understood one word in three."</p>
<p>Just then Tomas himself stalked into sight among the men
forward. Coming round the corner of the deck-house, he stopped at
the galley door like a crow outside a hut, waiting. We watched
him getting a light for his cigarette at the galley door with
much dignified pantomime. The negro cook of the <i>Lion</i>,
holding out to him in the doorway a live coal in a pair of tongs,
turned his Ethiopian face and white ivories towards a group of
sailors lost in the contemplation of the proceedings.' And, when
Castro had passed them, spurting jets of smoke, they swung about
to look after his short figure, upon whose draped blackness the
sunlight brought out reddish streaks as if bucketfuls of rusty
water had been thrown over him from hat to toe. The end of his
broken plume hung forward aggressively.</p>
<p>"Look how the fellow struts! Night and thunder! Hey, Don
Tenebroso! Would your worship hasten hither..." Sebright hailed
jocularly.</p>
<p>Castro, without altering his pace, came up to us.</p>
<p>"What do you think of her now?" asked Sebright, pointing to
the strange sail. "She's grown a bit plainer, now she is out of
the glare."</p>
<p>Castro, wrapping his chin, stood still, face to the sea. After
a long while:</p>
<p>"Malediction," he pronounced slowly, and without moving his
head shot a sidelong glance at me.</p>
<p>"It's clear enough how <i>he</i> feels about our friends over
there. Malediction. Just so. Very proper. But it seems as though
he had a bone to pick with all the world," drawled Sebright, a
little sleepily. Then, resuming his briskness, he bantered, "So
you don't want to go to England, Mr. Castro? No friends there?
<i>Sus. per col.</i>, and that sort of thing?"</p>
<p>Castro, contemptuous, staring straight away, nodded
impatiently.</p>
<p>"But this gentleman you are so devoted to is going to
England&mdash;to his friends."</p>
<p>Castro's arms shook under the mantle falling all round him
straight from the neck. His whole body seemed convulsed. From his
puckered dark lips issued a fiendish and derisive squeal.</p>
<p>"Let his friends beware, then. <i>Por Dios!</i> Let them
beware. Let them pray and fast, and beg the intercession of the
saints. Ha! ha! ha!..."</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more unlike his saturnine self-centred
truculence of restraint. He impressed me; and even Sebright's
steady, cool eyes grew perceptibly larger before this sarcastic
fury. Castro choked; the rusty, black folds encircling him shook
and heaved. Unexpectedly he thrust out in front of the cloak one
yellow, dirty little hand, side by side with the bright end of
his fixed blade.</p>
<p>"What do I hear? To England! Going to England! Ha! Then let
him hasten there straight! Let him go straight there, I
say&mdash;I, Tomas Castro!"</p>
<p>He lowered his tone to impress us more, and the point of the
knife, as it were an emphatic forefinger, tapped the open palm
forcibly. Did we think that a man was not already riding along
the coast to Havana on a fast mule?&mdash;the very best mule from
the stables of Don Balthasar himself&mdash;that murdered saint.
The Captain-General had no such mules. His late excellency owned
a sugar estate halfway between Rio Medio and Havana, and a relay
of riding mules was kept there for quickness when His Excellency
of holy memory found occasion to write his commands to the
capital. The news of our escape would reach the <i>Juez</i> next
day at the latest. Manuel would take care of that&mdash;unless he
were drowned. But he could swim like a fish. Malediction!</p>
<p>"I cried out to you to kill!" he addressed me directly; "with
all my soul I cried. And why? Because he had seen you and the
senorita, too, alas! He should have been made dumb&mdash;made
dumb with your pistol, Se&ntilde;or, since those two stupid
English mariners were too much for an old man like me. Manuel
should have been made dumb&mdash;dumb forever, I say. What
mattered he&mdash;that gutter-born offspring of an evil
<i>Gitana</i>, whom I have seen, Se&ntilde;or! I, myself, have
seen her in the days of my adversity in Madrid,
Se&ntilde;or&mdash;a red flower behind the ear, clad in rags that
did not cover all her naked skin, looking on while they fought
for her with knives in a wine-shop full of beggars and thieves.
Si, senor. That's his mother.
<i>Improvisador&mdash;politico&mdash;capataz</i>. Ha...Dirt!"</p>
<p>He made a gesture of immense contempt.</p>
<p>"What mattered he? The coach would have returned from the
cathedral, and the Casa Riego could have been held for
days&mdash;and who could have known you were not inside. I had
conversed earnestly with Cesar the major-domo&mdash;an African,
it is true, but a man of much character and excellent sagacity.
Ah, Manuel! Manuel! If I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But the devil
himself fathers the children of such mothers. I am no longer in
possession of my first vigour, and you, Se&ntilde;or, have all
the folly of your nation..."</p>
<p>He bared his grizzled head to me loftily.</p>
<p>"...And the courage! Doubtless, that is certain. It is well.
You may want it all before long, Se&ntilde;or...And the
courage!"</p>
<p>The broken plume swept the deck. For a time he blinked his
creased, brown eyelids in the sun, then pulled his hat low down
over his brows, and, wrapping himself up closely, turned away
from me to look at the sail to leeward.</p>
<p>"What an old, old, wrinkled, little, puffy beggar he is!"
observed Sebright, in an undertone...</p>
<p>"Well, and what is your worship's opinion as to the purpose of
that schooner?"</p>
<p>Castro shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows?"...He released the
gathered folds of his cloak, and moved off without a look at
either of us.</p>
<p>"There he struts, with his wings drooping like a turkey-cock
gone into deep mourning," said Sebright. "Who knows? Ah, well,
there's no hurry to know for a day or two. I don't think that
craft could overhaul the Lion, if they tried ever so. They may
manage to keep us in sight perhaps."</p>
<p>He yawned, and left me standing motionless, thinking of
Seraphina. I longed to see her&mdash;to make sure, as if my
belief in the possession of her had been inexplicably weakened. I
was going to look at the door of her cabin. But when I got as far
as the companion I had to stand aside for Mrs. Williams, who was
coming up the winding stairs.</p>
<p>From above I saw the gray woollen shawl thrown over her narrow
shoulders. Her parting made a broad line on her brown head. She
mounted busily, holding up a little the front of her black, plain
skirt. Her glance met mine with a pale, searching candour from
below.</p>
<p>Overnight she had heard all my story. She had come out to the
saloon whilst I had been giving it to Williams, and after saying
reassuringly, "The young lady, I am thankful, is asleep," she had
sat with her eyes fixed upon my lips. I had been aware of her
anxious face, and of the slight, nervous movements of her hands
at certain portions of my narrative under the blazing lamps. We
met now, for the first time, in the daylight.</p>
<p>Hastily, as if barring my road to Seraphina's cabin, "Miss
Riego, I would have you know," she said, "is in good bodily
health. I have this moment looked upon her again. The poor,
superstitious young lady is on her knees, crossing herself."</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams shuddered slightly. It was plain that the sight
of that popish practice had given her a shock&mdash;almost a
scare, as if she had seen a secret and nefarious rite. I
explained that Seraphina, being a Catholic, worshipped as her
lights enjoined, as we did after ours. Mrs. Williams only sighed
at this, and, making an effort, proposed that I should walk with
her a little. We began to pace the poop, she gliding with short
steps at my side, and drawing close the skimpy shawl about her.
The smooth bands of her hair put a shadow into the slight hollows
of her temples. No nun, in the chilly meekness of the habit, had
ever given me such a strong impression of poverty and
renunciation.</p>
<p>But there was in that faded woman a warmth of sentiment. She
flushed delicately whenever caught (and one could not help
catching her continually) following her husband with eyes that
had an expression of maternal uneasiness and the captivated
attention of a bride. And after she had got over the idea that I,
as a member of the male British aristocracy, was
dissolute&mdash;it was an article of faith with her&mdash;that
warmth of sentiment would bring a faint, sympathetic rosiness to
her sunken cheeks.</p>
<p>She said suddenly and trembling, "Oh, young sir, reflect upon
these things before it is too late. You young men, in your
luxurious, worldly, ungoverned lives..."</p>
<p>I shall never forget that first talk with her on the
poop&mdash;her hurried, nervous voice (for she was a timid woman,
speaking from a sense of duty), and the extravagant forms her
ignorance took. With the emotions of the past night still
throbbing in my brain and heart, with the sight of the sea and
the coast, with the Rio Medio schooner hanging on our quarter, I
listened to her, and had a hard task to believe my ears. She was
so convinced that I was "dissolute," because of my class&mdash;as
an earl's grandson.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine how she arrived at the conviction;
it must have been from pulpit denunciations of the small Bethel
on the outskirt of Bristol. Her uncle, J. Perkins, was a great
ruffian, certainly, and Williams was dissolute enough, if one
wished to call his festive imbecilities by a hard name. But these
two could, by no means, be said to belong to the upper classes.
And these two, apart from her favourite preacher, were the only
two men of whom she could be said to have more than a visual
knowledge.</p>
<p>She had spent her best years in domestic slavery to her
bachelor uncle, an old shipowner of savage selfishness; she had
been the deplorable mistress of his big, half-furnished house,
standing in a damp garden full of trees. The outrageous Perkins
had been a sailor in his time&mdash;mate of a privateer in the
great French war, afterwards master of a slaver, developing at
last into the owner of a small fleet of West Indiamen. Williams
was his favourite captain, whom he would bring home in the
evening to drink rum and water, and smoke churchwarden pipes with
him. The niece had to sit up, too, at these dismal revels. Old
Perkins would keep her out of bed to mix the grogs, till he was
ready to climb the bare stone staircase, echoing from top to
bottom with his stumbles. However, it seems he dozed a good deal
in snatches during the evening, and this, I suppose, gave their
opportunity to the pale, spiritual-looking spinster with the
patient eyes, and to the thick, staring Williams, florid with
good living, and utterly unused to the company of women of that
sort. But in what way these two unsimilar beings had looked upon
each other, what she saw in him, what he imagined her to be like,
why, how, wherefore, an understanding arose between them, remains
inexplicable. It was her romance&mdash;and it is even possible
that he was moved by an unselfish sentiment. Sebright accounted
for the matter by saying that, as to the woman, it was no wonder.
Anything to get away from a bullying old ruffian, that would use
bad language in cold blood just to horrify her&mdash;and then
burst into a laugh and jeer; but as to Captain Williams (Sebright
had been with him from a boy), he ought to have known he was
quite incapable of keeping straight after all these free-and-easy
years.</p>
<p>He used to talk a lot, about that time, of good women, of
settling down to a respectable home, of leading a better life;
but, of course, he couldn't. Simply couldn't, what with old
friends in Kingston and Havana&mdash;and his habits
formed&mdash;and his weakness for women who, as Sebright put it,
could not be called good. Certainly there did not seem to have
been any sordid calculation in the marriage. Williams fully
expected to lose his command; but, as it turned out, the old
beast, Perkins, was quite daunted by the loss of his niece. He
found them out in their lodgings, came to them
crying&mdash;absolutely whimpering about his white hairs, talking
touchingly of his will, and promising amendment. In the end it
was arranged that Williams should keep his command; and Mrs.
Williams went back to her uncle. That was the best of it.
Actually went back to look after that lonely old rip, out of pure
pity and goodness of heart. Of course old Perkins was afraid to
treat her as badly as before, and everything was going on fairly
well, till some kind friend sent her an anonymous letter about
Williams' goings on in Jamaica. Sebright strongly suspected the
master of another regular trading ship, with whom Williams had a
difference in Kingston the voyage before last&mdash;Sebright
said&mdash;about a small matter, with long hair&mdash;not worth
talking about. She said nothing at first, and nearly worried
herself into a brain-fever. Then she confessed she had a
letter&mdash;didn't believe it&mdash;but wanted a change, and
would like to come for one voyage. Nothing could be said to
that.</p>
<p>The worst was, the captain was so knocked over at the idea of
his little sins coming to light, that he&mdash;Sebright&mdash;had
the greatest difficulty in preventing him from giving himself
away.</p>
<p>"If I hadn't been really fond of her," Sebright concluded, "I
would have let everything go by the board. It's too difficult.
And mind, the whole of Kingston was on the broad grin all the
time we were there&mdash;but it's no joke. She's a good woman,
and she's jealous. She wants to keep her own. Never had much of
her own in this world, poor thing. She can't help herself any
more than the skipper can. Luckily, she knows no more of life
than a baby. But it's a most cruel set out."</p>
<p>Sebright had exposed the domestic situation on board the
<i>Lion</i> with a force of insight and sympathy hardly to be
expected from his years. No doubt his attachment to the disparate
couple counted for not a little. He seemed to feel for them both
a sort of exasperated affection; but I have no doubt that in his
way he was a remarkable young man with his contrasted bringing up
first at the hands of an old maiden lady; afterwards on board
ship with Williams, to whom he was indentured at the age of
fifteen, when as he casually mentioned&mdash;"a scoundrelly
attorney in Exeter had run off with most of the old girl's
money." Indeed, looking back, they all appear to me uncommon;
even to the round-eyed Williams, cowed simply out of respect and
regard for his wife, and as if dazed with fright at the
conventional catastrophe of being found out before he could get
her safely back to Bristol. As to Mrs. Williams, I must confess
that the poor woman's ridiculous and genuine misery, inducing her
to undertake the voyage, presented itself to me simply as a
blessing, there on the poop. She had been practically good to
Seraphina, and her talking to me mattered very little, set
against that...And such talk!</p>
<p>It was like listening to an earnest, impassioned, tremulous
impertinence. She seemed to start from the assumption that I was
capable of every villainy, and devoid of honour and conscience;
only one perceived that she used the words from the force of
unworldly conviction, and without any real knowledge of their
meaning, as a precocious child uses terms borrowed from its
pastors and masters.</p>
<p>I was greatly disconcerted at first, but I was never angry.
What of it, if, with a sort of sweet absurdity, she talked in
great agitation of the depravity of hearts, of the sin of
light-mindedness, of the self-deception which leads men
astray&mdash;a confused but purposeful jumble, in which
occasional allusions to the errors of Rome, and to the want of
seriousness in the upper classes, put in a last touch of
extravagance?</p>
<p>What of it? The time was coming when I should remember the
frail, homely, as if starved, woman, and thank heaven for her
generous heart, which was gained for us from that moment. Far
from being offended, I was drawn to her. There is a beauty in the
absolute conscience of the simple; and besides, her distrust was
for me, alone. I saw that she erected* herself not into a judge,
but into a guardian, against the dangers of our youth and our
romance. She was disturbed by its origin.</p>
<p>There was so much of the unusual, of the unheard of in its
beginning, that she was afraid of the end. I was so
inexperienced, she said, and so was the young lady&mdash;poor
motherless thing&mdash;wilful, no doubt&mdash;so very
taking&mdash;like a little child, rather. Had I comprehended all
my responsibility? (And here one of the hurried side-allusions to
the errors of Rome came in with a reminder, touching the charge
of another immortal soul beside my own.) Had I reflected?...</p>
<p>It seems to me that this moment was the last of my boyishness.
It was as if the contact with her earnestness had matured me with
a power greater than the power of dangers, of fear, of tragic
events. She wanted to know insistently whether I were sure of
myself, whether I had examined my feelings, and had measured my
strength, and had asked for guidance. I had done nothing of this.
Not till brought face to face with her unanswerable simplicity
did I descend within myself. It seemed I had descended so deeply
that, for a time, I lost the sound of her voice. And again I
heard her.</p>
<p>"There's time yet," she was saying. "Think, young sir (she had
addressed me throughout as 'young sir.') My husband and I have
been talking it over most anxiously. Think well before you commit
the young lady for life. You are both so young. It looks as if we
had been sent providentially..."</p>
<p>What was she driving at? Did she doubt my love? It was rather
horrible; but it was too startling and too extravagant to be met
with anger. We looked at each other, and I discovered that she
had been, in reality, tremendously excited by this adventure.
This was the secret of her audacity. And I was also possessed by
excitement. We stood there like two persons meeting in a great
wind. Without moving her hands, she clasped and unclasped her
fingers, looking up at me with soliciting eyes; and her lips,
firmly closed, twitched.</p>
<p>"I am looking for the means of explaining to you how much I
love her," I burst out. "And if I found a way, you could not
understand. What do you know?&mdash;what can you know?..."</p>
<p>I said this not in scorn, but in sheer helplessness. I was at
a loss before the august magnitude of my feeling, which I saw
confronting me like an enormous presence arising from that blue
sea. It was no longer a boy-and-girl affair; no longer an
adventure; it was an immense and serious happiness, to be paid
for by an infinity of sacrifice.</p>
<p>"I am a woman," she said, with a fluttering dignity. "And it
is because I know how women suffer from what men say..."</p>
<p>Her face flushed. It flushed to the very bands of her hair.
She was rosy all over the eyes and forehead. Rosy and ascetic,
with something outraged and inexpressibly sweet in her
expression. My great emotion was between us like a mist, through
which I beheld strange appearances. It was as if an immaterial
spirit had blushed before me. And suddenly I saw
tears&mdash;tears that glittered exceedingly, falling hard and
round, like pellets of glass, out of her faded eyes.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Williams," I cried, "you can't know how I love her. No
one in the world can know. When I think of her&mdash;and I think
of her always&mdash;it seems to me that one life is not enough to
show my devotion. I love her like something unchangeable and
unique&mdash;altogether out of the world; because I see the world
through her. I would still love her if she had made me miserable
and unhappy."</p>
<p>She exclaimed a low "Ah!" and turned her head away for a
moment.</p>
<p>"But one cannot express these things," I continued. "There are
no words. Words are not meant for that. I love her so that, were
I to die this moment, I verily believe my soul, refusing to leave
this earth, would remain hovering near her..."</p>
<p>She interrupted me with a sort of indulgent horror. "Sh! sh!"
I mustn't talk like that. I really must not&mdash;and
inconsequently she declared she was quite willing to believe me.
Her husband and herself had not slept a wink for thinking of us.
The notion of the fat, sleepy Williams, sitting up all night to
consider, owlishly, the durability of my love, cooled my
excitement. She thought they had been providentially thrown into
our way to give us an opportunity of reconsidering our decision.
There were still so many difficulties in the way.</p>
<p>I did not see any; her utter incomprehension began to weary
me, while she still twined her fingers, wiped her eyes by
stealth, as it were, and talked unflinchingly. She could not have
made herself clearly understood by Seraphina. Moreover, women
were so helpless&mdash;so very helpless in such matters. That is
why she was speaking to me. She did not doubt my sincerity at the
present time&mdash;but there was, humanly speaking, a long life
before us&mdash;and what of afterwards? Was I sure of
myself&mdash;later on&mdash;when all was well?</p>
<p>I cut her short. Seizing both her hands:</p>
<p>"I accept the omen, Mrs. Williams!" I cried. "That's it! When
all is well! And all must be well in a very short time, with you
and your husband's help, which shall not fail me, I know. I feel
as if the worst of our troubles were over already..."</p>
<p>But at that moment I saw Seraphina coming out on deck. She
emerged from the companion, bare-headed, and looked about at her
new surroundings with that air of imperious and childlike beauty
which made her charm. The wind stirred slightly her delicate
hair, and I looked at her; I looked at her stilled, as one
watches the dawn or listens to a sweet strain of music caught
from afar. Suddenly dropping Mrs. Williams' hand, I ran to
her...</p>
<p>When I turned round, Williams had joined his wife, and she had
slipped her arm under his. Her hand, thin and white, looked like
the hand of an invalid on the brawny forearm of that man bursting
with health and good condition. By the side of his lustiness, she
was almost ethereal&mdash;and yet I seemed to see in them
something they had in common&mdash;something subtle, like the
expression of eyes. It <i>was</i> the expression of their eyes.
They looked at us with commiseration; one of them sweetly, the
other with his owlish fixity. As we two, Seraphina and I,
approached them together, I heard Williams' thick, sleepy voice
asking, "And so he says he won't?" To which his wife, raising her
tone with a shade of indignation, answered, "Of course not." No,
I was not mistaken. In their dissimilar persons, eyes, faces,
there was expressed a common trouble, doubt, and commiseration.
This expression seemed to go out to meet us sadly, like a bearer
of ill-news. And, as if at the sight of a downcast messenger, I
experienced the clear presentiment of some fatal
intelligence.</p>
<p>It was conveyed to me late in the afternoon of that 'same day
out of Williams' own thick lips, that seemed as heavy and inert
as his voice.</p>
<p>"As far as we can see," he said, "you can't stay in the ship,
Kemp. It would do no one any good&mdash;not the slightest good.
Ask Sebright here."</p>
<p>It was a sort of council of war, to which we had been summoned
in the saloon. Mrs. Williams had some sewing in her lap. She
listened, her hands motionless, her eyes full of desolation.
Seraphina's attitude, leaning her cheek on her hand, reminded me
of the time when I had seen her absorbed in watching the
green-and-gold lizard in the back room of Ramon's store, with her
hair falling about her face like a veil. Castro was not called in
till later on. But Sebright was there, leaning his back
negligently against the bulkhead behind Williams, and looking
down on us seated on both sides of the long table. And there was
present, too, in all our minds, the image of the Rio Medio
schooner, hull down on our quarter. In all the trials of sailing,
we had not been able to shake her off that day.</p>
<p>"I don't want to hide from you, Mr. Kemp," Sebright began,
"that it was I who pointed out to the captain that you would be
only getting the ship in trouble for nothing. She's an old trader
and favourite with shippers; and if we once get to loggerheads
with the powers, there's an end of her trading. As to missing
Havana this trip, even if you, Mr. Kemp, could give a pot of
money, the captain could never show his nose in there again after
breaking his charter-party to help steal a young lady. And it
isn't as if she were nobody. She's the richest heiress in the
island. The biggest people in Spain would have their say in this
matter. I suppose they could put the captain in prison or
something. Anyway, good-by to the Havana business for good. Why,
old Perkins would have a fit. He got over one runaway match...All
right, Mrs. Williams, not another word...What I meant to say is
that this is nothing else but a love story, and to knock on the
head a valuable old-established connection for it..Don't bite
your lip, Mr. Kemp. I mean no disrespect to your feelings.
Perkins would start up to break things&mdash;let alone his heart.
I am sure the captain and Mrs. Williams think so, too."</p>
<p>The festive and subdued captain of the <i>Lion</i> was staring
straight before him, as if stuffed. Mrs. Williams moved her
fingers, compressed her lips, and looked helplessly at all of us
in turn. "Besides altering his will," Sebright breathed
confidentially at the back of my head. I perceived that this old
Perkins, whom I had never seen, and was never to see in the body,
whose body no one was ever to see any more (he died suddenly on
the echoing staircase, with a flat candlestick in his hand; was
already dead at the time, so that Mrs. Williams was actually
sitting in the cabin of her very own ship)&mdash;I perceived that
old Perkins was present at this discussion with all the power of
a malignant, bad-tempered spirit. Those two were afraid of him.
They had defied him once, it is true&mdash;but even that had been
done out of fear, as it were.</p>
<p>Dismayed, I spoke quickly to Seraphina. With her head resting
on her hand, and her eyes following the aimless tracings of her
finger on the table, she said:</p>
<p>"It shall be as God wills it, Juan."</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't!" said Sebright, coughing behind me.
He understood Spanish fairly well. "What I've said is perfectly
true. Nevertheless the captain was ready to risk it."</p>
<p>"Yes," ejaculated Williams profoundly, out of almost still
lips, and otherwise so motionless all over that the deep sound
seemed to have been produced by some person under the table. Mrs.
Williams' fingers were clasped on her lap, and her eyes seemed to
beg for belief all round our faces.</p>
<p>"But the point is that it would have been no earthly good for
you two," continued Sebright. "That's the point I made. If
O'Brien knows anything, he knows you are on board this ship. He
reckons on it as a dead certainty. Now, it is very evident that
we could refuse to give <i>you</i> up, Mr. Kemp, and that the
admiral (if the flagship's off Havana, as I think she must be by
now) would have to back us up. How you would get on afterwards
with old Groggy Rowley, I don't know. It isn't likely he has
forgotten you tried to wipe the floor with him, if I am to take
the captain's yarn as correct."</p>
<p>"A regular hero," Williams testified suddenly, in his
concealed, from-under-the-table tone. "He's not afraid of any of
them; not he. Ha! ha! Old Topnambo must have..." He glanced at
his wife, and bit his tongue&mdash;perhaps at the recollection of
his unsafe conjugal position&mdash;ending in disjointed words,
"In his chaise&mdash;warrant&mdash;separationist&mdash;rebel,"
and all this without moving a limb or a muscle of his face, till,
with a low, throaty chuckle, he fluttered a stony sort of wink to
my address.</p>
<p>Sebright had paused only long enough for this ebullition to be
over. The cool logic of his surmise appalled me. He didn't see
why O'Brien or anybody in Havana should want to interfere with me
personally. But if I wanted to keep my young lady, it was obvious
she must not arrive in Havana on board a ship where they would be
sure to look for her the very first thing. It was even worse than
it looked, he declared. His firm conviction was that if the
<i>Lion</i> did not turn up in Havana pretty soon, there would be
a Spanish man-of-war sent out to look for her&mdash;or else Mr.
O'Brien was not the man we took him for. There was lying in
harbour a corvette called the <i>Tornado</i>, a very likely
looking craft. I didn't expect them to fight a corvette. No doubt
there would be a fuss made about stopping a British ship on the
high seas; but that would be a cold comfort after the lady had
been taken away from me. She was a person of so much importance
that even our own admiral could be induced&mdash;say, by the
Captain-General's remonstrances&mdash;to sanction such an action.
There was no saying what Rowley would do if they only promised to
present him with half a dozen pirates to take home for a hanging.
Why! that was the very identical thing the flagship was kept
dodging off Havana for! And O'Brien knew where to lay his hands
on a gross of such birds, for that matter.</p>
<p>"No," concluded Sebright, overwhelming me from behind, as I
sat looking, not at the uncertainties of the future, but at the
paralyzing hopelessness of the bare to-morrow. "The <i>Lion</i>
is no place for you, whether she goes into Havana or not.
Moreover, into Havana she must go now. There's no help for it.
It's the deuce of a situation."</p>
<p>"Very well," I gasped. I tried to be resolute. I felt,
suddenly, as if all the air in the cabin had gone up the open
skylight. I couldn't remain below another moment; and, muttering
something about coming back directly, I jumped up and ran out
without looking at any one lest I should give myself away. I ran
out on deck for air, but the great blue emptiness of the open
staggered me like a blow over the heart. I walked slowly to the
side, and, planting both my elbows on the rail, stared abroad
defiantly and without a single clear thought in my head. I had a
vague feeling that the descent of the sun towards the waters,
going on before my eyes with changes of light and cloud, was like
some gorgeous and empty ceremonial of immersion belonging to a
vast barren faith remote from consolation and hope. And I
noticed, also, small things without importance&mdash;the hirsute
aspect of a sailor; the end of a rope trailing overboard; and
Castro, so different from everybody else on board that his
appearance seemed to create a profound solitude round him,
lounging before the cabin door as if engaged in a deep conspiracy
all by himself. I heard voices talking loudly behind me, too.</p>
<p>I noted them distinctly, but with perfect indifference. A long
time after, with the same indifference, I looked over my
shoulder. Castro had vanished from the quarter-deck. And I turned
my face to the sea again as a man, feeling himself beaten in a
fight with death, might turn his face to the wall.</p>
<p>I had fought a harder battle with a more cruel foe than death,
with the doubt of myself; an endless contest, in which there is
no peace of victory or of defeat. The open sea was like a blank
and unscalable wall imprisoning the eternal question of conduct.
Right or wrong? Generosity or folly? Conscience or only weak fear
before remorse? The magnificent ritual of sunset went on
palpitating with an inaudible rhythm, with slow and unerring
observance, went on to the end, leaving its funeral fires on the
sky and a great shadow upon the sea. Twice I had honourably
stayed my hand. Twice...to this end.</p>
<p>In a moment, I went through all the agonies of suicide, which
left me alive, alas, to burn with the shame of the treasonable
thought, and terrified by the revolt of my soul refusing to leave
the world in which a young girl lived! The vast twilight seemed
to take the impress of her image like wax. What did Seraphina
think of me? I knew nothing of her but her features, and it was
enough. Strange, this power of a woman's face upon a man's
heart&mdash;this mastery, potent as witchcraft and mysterious
like a miracle. I should have to go and tell her. I did not
suppose she could have understood all of Sebright's
argumentation. Therefore, it was for me to explain to what a
pretty pass I had brought our love.</p>
<p>I was so greatly disinclined to stir that I let Sebright's
voice go on calling my name half a dozen times from the cabin
door. At last I faced about.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kemp! I say, Kemp! Aren't you coming in yet?"</p>
<p>"To say good-by," I said, approaching him.</p>
<p>It had fallen dark already.</p>
<p>"Good-by? No. The carpenter must have a day at least."</p>
<p>Carpenter! What had a carpenter to do in this? However,
nothing mattered&mdash;as though I had managed to spoil the whole
scheme of creation.</p>
<p>"You didn't think of making a start to-night, did you?"
Sebright wondered. "Where would be the sense of it?"</p>
<p>"Sense," I answered contemptuously. "There is no sense in
anything. There is necessity. Necessity."</p>
<p>He remained silent for a time, peering at me.</p>
<p>"Necessity, to be sure," he said slowly. "And I don't see why
you should be angry at it."</p>
<p>I was thinking that it was easy enough for him to keep
cool&mdash;the necessity being mine. He continued to philosophize
with what seemed to me a shocking freedom of mind.</p>
<p>"Must try to put some sense into it. That's what we are here
for, I guess. Anyhow, there's some room for sense in arranging
the way a thing is to be done, be it as hard as it may. And I
don't see any sense, either, in exposing a woman to more hardship
than is absolutely necessary. We have talked it out now, and I
can do no more. Do go inside for a bit. Mrs. Williams is worrying
the Se&ntilde;orita, rather, I'm afraid."</p>
<p>I paused a moment to try and regain the command of my
faculties. But it was as if a bombshell had exploded inside my
skull, scattering all my wits to the four winds of heaven. Only
the conviction of failure remained, attended by a profound
distress.</p>
<p>I fancy, though, I presented a fairly bold front. The lamp was
lit, and small changes had occurred during my absence. Williams
had turned his bulk sideways to the table. Mrs. Williams had
risen from her place, and was now sitting upright close to
Seraphina, holding one little hand inclosed caressingly between
her frail palms, as if she had there something alive that needed
cherishing. And in that position she looked up at me with a
strange air of worn-out youth, cast by a rosy flush over her
forehead and face. Seraphina still leaned her head on her other
hand, and I noted, through the soft shadow of falling hair, the
heightened colour on her cheek and the augmented brilliance of
her eye.</p>
<p>"'How I wish she had been an English girl," Mrs. Williams
sighed regretfully, and leaned forward to look into Seraphina's
half-averted face.</p>
<p>"My dear, did you quite, quite understand what I have been
saying to you?"</p>
<p>She waited.</p>
<p>"<i>Si Se&ntilde;ora</i>," said Seraphina. None of us moved.
Then, after a time, turning to me with sudden animation, "This
woman asked me if I believed in your love," she cried. "She is
old. Oh, Juan, can the years change the heart? your heart?" Her
voice dropped. "How am I to know that?" she went on piteously. "I
am young&mdash;and we may not live so long. I believe in
mine..."</p>
<p>The corners of her delicate lips drooped; but she mastered her
desire to cry, and steadied her voice which, always rich and full
of womanly charm, took on, when she was deeply moved, an imposing
gravity of timbre.</p>
<p>"But I am a Spaniard, and I believe in my lover's honour; in
your&mdash;your English honour, Juan."</p>
<p>With the dignity of a supreme confidence she extended her
hand. It was one of the culminating moments of our love. For love
is like a journey in mountainous country, up through the clouds,
and down into the shadows to an unknown destination. It was a
moment rapt and full of feeling, in which we seemed to dwell
together high up and alone&mdash;till she withdrew her hand from
my lips, and I found myself back in the cabin, as if precipitated
from a lofty place.</p>
<p>Nobody was looking at us. Mrs. Williams sat with downcast
eyelids, with her hands reposing on her lap: her husband gazed
discreetly at a gold moulding on the deck-beam; and the upward
cast of his eyes invested his red face with an air of singularly
imbecile ecstasy. And there was Castro, too, whom I had not seen
till then, though I must have brushed against him on entering. He
had stood by the door a mute, and, as it were, a voluntarily
unmasked conspirator with the black round of the hat lying in
front of his feet. He, alone, looked at us. He looked from
Seraphina to me&mdash;from me to Seraphina. He looked unutterable
things, rolling his crow-footed eyes in pious horror and
glowering in turns. When Seraphina addressed him, he hastened to
incline his head with his usual deference for the daughter of the
Riegos.</p>
<p>She said, "There are things that concern this
<i>caballero</i>, and that you can never understand. Your
fidelity is proved. It has sunk deep here... It shall give you a
contented old age&mdash;on the word of Seraphina Riego."</p>
<p>He looked down at his feet with gloomy submission.</p>
<p>"There is a proverb about an enamoured woman," he muttered to
himself, loud enough for me to overhear. Then, stooping
deliberately to pick up his hat, he flourished it with a great
sweep lower than his knees. His dumpy black back flitted out of
the cabin; and almost directly we heard the sharp click of his
flint and blade outside the door. <a name="2HCH0024">

<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>
<p>How often the activity of our life is the least real part of
it! Life, looked upon as a whole, presents itself to my fancy as
a pursuit with open arms of a winged and magnificent dream,
hovering just over our heads and casting its glory upon our
hopes. It is in this simple vision, which is one and enduring,
and not in the changing facts, that we must look for meaning and
for truth. The three quiet days we spent together on board the
<i>Lion</i> remain to me memorable and full of import, eventless
and containing the very quintessence of existence. We shared the
sunshine, always together, very close, turning hand in hand to
the sea, whose unstained blueness continued under our feet the
blue above our heads, as though we had been snatched up into the
sky. The insignificant words we exchanged seemed informed by a
sustaining certitude and an admirable gravity, as though there
had been some quality of unerring wisdom in the blind love of man
and woman. From the inexhaustible treasure of her feelings she
drew words, glances, gestures that appeased every uneasiness of
my heart. In some brief moment of illumination whose advent my
man's eyes had utterly missed, she had learned all at once
everything there was to know. She knew. She no longer needed to
survey my actions, my words, my thoughts; but she accorded me the
sincere flattery of spell-bound attention, and it was made
intoxicating by her smile. In those short days of a pause, when,
like a swimmer turning on his back, we lived in the trustful
confidence of the sustaining depths, instead of struggling with
the agitation of the surface&mdash;in these days we had the time
to look at each other profoundly; and I saw her smile come back
again a little changed, more meaning and a little less mirthful,
as if her lips had been made stiff by sorrow. But she was young;
and youth, the time of softness, of tenderness, of enthusiasm,
and of pity, presents a surface as hard as marble to the finality
of death.</p>
<p>Breathing side by side, drinking in the sunshine, and talking
of ourselves not at all, but casting the sense of our love like a
magnificent garment over the wide significance of a world already
conquered, we could not help being made aware of the currents of
excitement and sympathy that converged upon our essential
isolation from the life of the ship. It was the excitement of the
adventure brewing for our drinking according to Sebright's
recipe. People approached us&mdash;spoke to us. We attended to
them as if called down from an elevation; we were aware of the
kind tone; and, remaining indistinct, they retreated, leaving us
free to regain the heights of the lovers' paradise&mdash;a region
of tender whispers and intense silences. Suddenly there would be
a short, throaty laugh behind our backs, and Williams would
begin, "I say, Kemp; do you call to mind so-and-so?" Invariably
some planter or merchant in Jamaica. I never could.</p>
<p>Williams would grunt, "No? I wonder how you passed your time
away these two years or more. The place isn't that big." His
purpose was to cheer me up by some gossip, if only he could find
a common acquaintance to talk over. I believe he thought me a
queer fish. He told me once that everybody he knew in Jamaica had
that precise opinion of me. Then with &agrave; chuckle and
muttering,
"Warrants&mdash;assault&mdash;Top&mdash;nambo&mdash;ha, ha!" he
would leave us to ourselves, and continue his waddle up and down
the poop. He wore loose silk trousers, and the round legs inside
moved like a contrivance made out of two gate-posts.</p>
<p>He was absurd. They all were that before our sweet
reasonableness. But this atmosphere, full of interest and good
will, was good to breathe. The very steward&mdash;the same who
had been hiding in the lazarette during the fight&mdash;a hunted
creature, displaying the most insignificant anatomy ever
inhabited by a quailing spirit, devoted himself to the
manufacture of strange cakes, which at tea-time he would deposit
smoking hot in front of Seraphina's place. After each such
exploit, he appeared amazed at his audacity in taking so much
upon himself. The carpenter took more than a day, tinkering at an
old ship's boat. He was a Shetlander&mdash;a sort of shaggy
hyperborean giant with a forbidding face, an appraising,
contemplative manner, and many nails in his mouth. At last the
time came when he, too, approached our oblivion from behind, with
a large hammer in his hand; but instead of braining us with one
sweep of his mighty arm, he remarked simply in uncouth accents,
"There now; I am thinking she will do well for what ye want her.
I can do no more for ye."</p>
<p>We turned round, arm-in-arm, to look at the boat. There she
was, lying careened on the deck, with patched sides, in a belt of
chips, shavings, and sawdust; a few pensive sailors stood about,
gazing down at her with serious eyes. Sebright, bent double,
circled slowly on a prowl of minute inspection. Suddenly
straightening himself up, he pronounced a curt "She'll do"; and,
without looking at us at all, went off busily with his rapid
stride.</p>
<p>A light sigh floated down upon our heads. Williams and his
wife appeared on the poop above us like an allegorical couple of
repletion and starvation, conceived in a fantastic vein on a
balcony. A cigar smouldered in his stumpy red fingers. She had
slipped a hand under his arm, as she would always do the moment
they came near each other. She never looked more wasted and
old-maidish than when thus affirming her wifely rights. But her
eyes were motherly.</p>
<p>"Ah, my dears!" (She usually addressed Seraphina as "miss,"
and myself as "young sir.") "Ah, my dears! It seems so heartless
to be sending you off in such a small boat, even for your own
good."</p>
<p>"Never fear, Mary. Repaired. Carry six comfortably," reassured
Williams in a tremendous mutter, like a bull.</p>
<p>"But why can't you give them one of the others, Owen? That big
one there?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Mary. Never see boat again. Wouldn't grudge it.
Only Sebright is quite right. Didn't you hear what Sebright said?
Very sensible. Ask Sebright. He will explain to you again."</p>
<p>It was Sebright, with his asperity and his tact, with fits of
brusqueness subdued by an almost affectionate contempt, who
conducted all their affairs, as I have seen a trustworthy and
experienced old nurse rule the infinite perplexities of a room
full of children. His clear-sightedness and mental grip seemed
independent of age and experience, like the ability of genius. He
had an imaginative eye for detail, and, starting from a mere
hint, would go scheming onwards with astonishing precision. His
plan, to which we were committed&mdash;committed helplessly and
without resistance&mdash;was based upon the necessity of our
leaving the ship.</p>
<p>He had developed it to me that evening, in the cabin, directly
Castro had gone out. He had already got Williams and his wife to
share his view of our situation. He began by laying it down that
in every desperate position there was a loophole for escape. Like
other great men, he was conscious of his ability, and was
inclined to theorize at large for a while. You had to accept the
situation, go with it in a measure, and as you had walked into
trouble with your eyes shut, you had only to continue with your
eyes open. Time was the only thing that could defeat one. If you
had no time, he admitted, you were at a dead wall. In this case
he judged there would be time, because O'Brien, warned already,
would sit tight for a few days, being sure to get hold of us
directly the <i>Lion</i> came into port. It was only if the
<i>Lion</i> failed to turn up within a reasonable term in Havana,
that he would take fright, and take measures to hunt her up at
sea. But I might rest assured that the <i>Lion</i> was going to
Havana as fast as the winds would allow her.</p>
<p>What was, then, the situation? he continued, looking at me
piercingly above Williams' cropped head. I had run away for dear
life from Cuba (taking with me what was best in it, to be sure,
he interjected, with a faint smile towards Seraphina). I had no
money, no friends (except my friends in this cabin, he was good
enough to say); warrants out against me in Jamaica; no means to
get to England; no safety in the ship. It was no use shirking
that little fact. We must leave the <i>Lion</i>. This was a
hopeless enough position. But it was hopeless only because it was
not looked upon in the right way. We assumed that we had to leave
her forever, while the whole secret of the trick was in this,
that we need only leave her for a time. After O'Brien's myrmidons
had gone through her, and had been hooted away empty-handed, she
became again, if not absolutely safe, then at least
possible&mdash;the only possible refuge for us&mdash;the only
decent means of reaching England together, where, he understood,
our trouble would cease. Williams nodded approval heavily.</p>
<p>"The friends of Miss Riego would be glad to know she had made
the passage under the care of a respectable married lady,"
Sebright explained, in that imperturbable manner of his, which
reflected faintly all his inner moods&mdash;whether of
recklessness, of jocularity or anxiety&mdash;and often his
underlying scorn. His gravity grew perfectly portentous. "Mrs.
Williams," he continued, "was, of course, very anxious to do her
part creditably. As it happened, the <i>Lion</i> was chartered
for London this voyage; and notwithstanding her natural desire to
rejoin, as soon as possible, her home and her aged uncle in
Bristol, she intended to go with the young lady in a hackney
coach to the very door."</p>
<p>I had previously told them that the lately appointed Spanish
ambassador in London was a relation of the Riegos, and personally
acquainted with Seraphina, who, nearly two years before, had been
on a short visit to Spain, and had lived for some months with his
family <i>in</i> Madrid, I believe. No trouble or difficulty was
to be apprehended as to proper recognition, or in the mattei of
rights and inheritance, and so on. The ambassador would make that
his own affair. And for the rest I trusted the decision of her
character and the strength of her affection. I was not afraid she
would let any one talk her out of an engagement, the dying wish
of her nearest kinsman, sealed, as it were, with the blood of her
father. This matter of temporary absence from the <i>Lion</i>,
however, seemed to present an insuperable difficulty. We could
not, obviously, be left for days floating in an open boat outside
Havana harbour, waiting till the ship came out to pick us up.
Sebright himself admitted that at first he did not see how it
could be contrived. He didn't see at all. He thought and thought.
It was enough to sicken one of every sort of thinking. Then,
suddenly, the few words Castro had let drop about the sugar
estate and the relay of mules came into his
head&mdash;providentially, as Mrs. Williams would say. He fancied
that the primitive and grandiose manner for a gentleman to keep a
relay of mules&mdash;any amount of mules&mdash;in case he should
want to send a letter or two, caused the circumstance to stick in
his mind. At once he had "our little <i>hidalgo</i>" in, and put
him through an examination.</p>
<p>"He turned fairly sulky, and tried constantly to break out
against you, till Dona Seraphina here gave him a good talking
to," Sebright said.</p>
<p>Otherwise it was most satisfactory. The place was accessible
from the sea through a narrow inlet, opening into a small,
perfectly sheltered basin at the back of the sand-dunes. The
little river watering the estate emptied itself into that basin.
One could land from a boat there, he understood, as if in a
dock&mdash;and it was the very devil if I and Miss Riego could
not lie hidden for a few days on her own property, the more so
that, as it came out in the course of the discussion, while I had
"rushed out to look at the sunset," that the manager, or whatever
they called him&mdash;the fellow in charge&mdash;was the husband
of Dona Seraphina's old nurse-woman. Of course, it behoved us to
make as little fuss as possible&mdash;try to reach the house
along by-paths early in the morning, when all the slaves would be
out at work in the fields. Castro, who professed to know the
locality very well indeed, would be of use. Meantime, the
<i>Lion</i> would make her way to Havana, as if nothing was the
matter. No doubt all sorts of confounded <i>alguazils</i> and
custom-house hounds would be ready to swarm on board in full cry.
They would be made very welcome. Any strangers on board?
Certainly not. Why should there be?...Rio Medio? What about Rio
Medio? Hadn't been within miles and miles of Rio Medio; tried
this trip to beat up well clear of the coast. Search the ship?
With pleasure&mdash;every nook and cranny. He didn't suppose they
would have the cheek to talk of the pirates; but if they did
venture&mdash;what then? Pirates? That's very serious and
dishonourable to the power of Spain. Personally, had seen nothing
of pirates. Thought they had all been captured and hanged quite
lately. Rumours of the <i>Lion</i> having been attacked obviously
untrue. Some other ship, perhaps...That was the line to take. If
it didn't convince them, it would puzzle them altogether. Of
course, Captain Williams, in his great regard for me, had
abandoned the intention of making an affair of state of the
outrage committed on his ship. He would not lodge any complaint
in Havana&mdash;nothing at all. The old women of the Admiralty
wouldn't be made to sit up this time. No report would be sent to
the admiral either. Only, if the ship were interfered with, and
bothered under any pretence whatever, once they had been given
every facility to have one good look everywhere, the admiral
would be asked to stop it. And the Spanish authorities would have
not a leg to stand on either, for this simple reason, that they
could not very well own to the sources of their information.
Meantime, all hands on board the <i>Lion</i> had to be taken into
confidence; that could not be avoided. He, Sebright, answered for
their discretion while sober, anyhow; and he promised me that no
leave or money would be given in Havana, for fear they should get
on a spree, and let out something in the grogshops on shore. We
all knew what a sailor-man was after a glass or two. So that was
settled. Now, as to our rejoining the <i>Lion</i>. This, of
necessity, must be left to me. Counting from the time we parted
from her to land on the coast, the <i>Lion</i> would remain in
Havana sixteen days; and if we did not turn up in that time, and
the cargo was all on board by then, Captain Williams would try to
remain in harbour on one pretence or another a few days longer.
But sixteen days should be ample, and it was even better not to
hurry up too much. To arrive on the fifteenth day would be the
safest proceeding in a way, but for the cutting of the thing too
fine, perhaps. With all these mules at our disposal, Sebright
didn't see why we should not make our way by land, pass through
the town at night, or in the earliest morning, and go straight on
board the <i>Lion</i>&mdash;perhaps use some sort of disguise. He
couldn't say. He was out of it there. Blackened faces or
something. Anyway, we would be looked out for on board night and
day.</p>
<p>Later on, however, we had learned from Castro that the estate
possessed a sailing craft of about twenty tons, which made
frequent trips to Havana. These sugar <i>droghers</i> belonging
to the plantations (every estate on the coast had one or more)
went in and out of the harbour without being taken much notice
of. Sometimes the battery at the water's edge on the north side
or a custom-house guard would hail them, but not often&mdash;and
even then only to ask the name, where from, and for the number of
sugar-hogsheads on board. "By heavens! That's the very thing!"
rejoiced Sebright. And it was agreed that this would be our best
way. We should time our arrival for early morning, or else at
dusk. The craft that brought us in should be made, by a piece of
unskillful management, to fall aboard the <i>Lion</i>, and remain
alongside long enough to give us time to sneak in through an open
deck-port.</p>
<p>The whole occurrence must be so contrived as to wear the
appearance of a pure accident to the onlookers, should there be
any. Shouting and an exchange of abuse on both parts should sound
very true. Then the <i>drogher</i>, getting herself clear, would
proceed innocently to the custom-house steps, where all such
coasters had to report themselves on arrival. "Never fear. We
shall put in some loud and scandalous cursing," Sebright assured
me. "The boys will greatly enjoy that part, I dare say."</p>
<p>Remained to consider the purpose of the schooner that had come
out of Rio Medio to hang on our skirts. It was doubtful whether
it was in our power to shake her off. Sebright was full of
admiration for her sailing qualities, coupled with infinite
contempt for the "lubberly gang on board."</p>
<p>"If I had the handling of her, now," he said, "I would take my
position as near as I liked, and stick there. It seems almost as
if she would do it of herself, if those imbeciles would only let
her have her own way. I never yet saw a Spaniard, good or bad,
that was anything of a sailor. As it is, we may maintain a
distance that would make it difficult for them to see what we are
about. And if not, then&mdash;why, you must take your leave of us
at night."</p>
<p>He didn't know that, but for the dismalness of such a
departure, it were not just as well. Who could tell what eyes
might be watching on shore?</p>
<p>"You know I never pretended my plan was quite safe. But have
you got another?"</p>
<p>I made no answer, because I had no other, and could not think
of one. Incredible as it may appear, not only my heart, but my
mind, also, in the awakened comprehension of my love, refused to
grapple with difficulties. My thoughts raced ahead of ships and
pursuing men, into a dream of cloudless felicity without end. And
I don't think Sebright expected any suggestion from me. This took
place during one of our busy talks&mdash;only he and
I&mdash;alone in his cabin. He had been washing his hands, making
ready for tea.</p>
<p>"Do you know," he said, turning full on me, and wiping his
fingers carefully with a coarse towel&mdash;"do you know, I
shouldn't wonder if that schooner were not keeping watch on us,
in suspicion of just some such move on our part. 'Tis
extraordinary how clever the greatest fool may show himself
sometimes. Only, with their lubberly Spanish seamanship, they
would expect us, probably, to make a whole ceremony of your
landing: ship hove to for hours close in shore, a boat going off
to land and returning, and all such pother. 'We are sure to see
their little show,' they think to themselves. Eh? What? Whereas
we shall keep well clear of the land when the time comes, and
drop you in the dark without as much check on our way as there is
in the wink of an eye. Hey?... Mind, Mr. Kemp, you take the boat
out of sight up that little river, in case they should have a
fancy, as they go along after us, to peep into that inlet. As I
have said it wouldn't do to trust too much in any fool's
folly."</p>
<p>And now the time was approaching; the time to awake and step
forth out of the temple of sunshine and love&mdash;of whispers
and silences. It had come. The night before both Williams and
Sebright had been on deck, working the ship with an anxious care
to take the utmost advantage of every favouring flaw in the
contrary breeze. In the morning I was told there was a norther
brewing. A norther is a tempestuous gale. I saw no signs of it.
The realm of the sun, like the vanished one of the stars,
appeared to my senses to be profoundly asleep, and breathing as
gently as a child upon the ship. The <i>Lion</i>, too, seemed to
lie wrapped in an enchanted slumber from the water-line to the
tops of her upright masts. And yet she moved with the breath of
the world, but so imperceptibly that it was the coast that seemed
to be nearing her like a line of low vapour blown along the
water. Between Williams and Sebright Castro pointed with his one
arm, and a splutter of guttural syllables fell like hail out of
his lips. The other two seemed incredulous. He stamped with both
his feet angrily. Finally they went below together, to look at
the chart, I suppose. They came up again very fast, one after
another, and stood in a row, looking on as before. Three more
dissimilar human beings it would have been difficult to
imagine.</p>
<p>Dazzling white patches, about the size of a man's hand, came
out between sky and water. They grew in width, and ran together
with a hummocky outline into a continuous undulation of
sand-dunes. Here and there this rampart had a gap like a breach
made by guns. Mrs. Williams, behind me, blew her nose faintly;
her eyes were red, but she did not look at us. No eye was turned
our way, and the spell of the coast was on her, too. A low, dark
headland broke out to view through the dunes, and stood there
conspicuous amongst the heaps of dazzling sand, like a small man
frowning. A voice on deck pronounced:</p>
<p>"That's right. Here's his landmark. The fellow knew very well
what he was talking about."</p>
<p>It was Sebright's voice, and Castro, strolling away
triumphantly, affected to turn his back on the land. He had
recognized the formation of the coast about the inlet long before
anybody else could distinguish the details. His word had been
doubted. He was offended, and passed us by, wrapping himself up
closely. One of Seraphina's locks blew against my cheek, and this
last effort of the breeze remained snared in the silken meshes of
her hair.</p>
<p>"There's not enough wind to fill the sail of a toy boat,"
grumbled Sebright; "and you can't pull this heavy gig ashore with
only that one-armed man at the other oar." He was sorry he could
not send us off with four good rowers. The norther might be
coming on before they could return to the ship, and&mdash;apart
from the presence of four English sailors on the coast being sure
to get talked about&mdash;there was the difficulty in getting
them back on board in Havana. We could, no doubt, smuggle
ourselves in; but six people would make too much of a show. On
the other hand, the absence of four men out of the ship's company
could not be accounted for very well to the authorities. "We
can't say they all died, and we threw them overboard. It would be
too startling. No; you must go alone, and leave us at the first
breath of wind; and that, I fear, 'll be the first of the
norther, too."</p>
<p>He threw his head back, and hailed, "Do you see anything of
that schooner from aloft there?"</p>
<p>"Nothing of her, sir," answered a man perched, with dangling
feet, astride the very end of the topsail yard-arm. He paused,
scanned the space from under the flat of his hand, and added,
shouting with deliberation, "There's&mdash;a&mdash;haze&mdash;to
seaward, sir." The ship, with her decks sprinkled over with men
in twos and threes, sent up to his ears a murmur of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>If we could not see her, she could not see us. This was a
favourable circumstance. To the infinite gratification of
everyone on board, it had been discovered at daylight that the
schooner had lost touch with us during the hours of
darkness&mdash;either through unskillful handling, or from some
accidental disadvantage of the variable wind. I had been informed
of it, directly I showed myself on deck in the morning, by
several men who had radiant grins, as if some great piece of luck
had befallen them, one and all. They shared their unflagging
attention between the land and the sea-horizon, pointing out to
each other, with their tattooed arms, the features of the coast,
nodding knowingly towards the open. At midday most of them
brought out their dinners on deck, and could be seen forward,
each with a tin plate in the left hand, gesticulating amicably
with clasp knives. A small white handkerchief hung from Mrs.
Williams' fingers, and now and then she touched her eyes lightly,
one after the other. Her husband and Sebright, with a grave mien,
stamped busily around the binnacle aft, changing places, making
way for each other, stooping in turns to glance carefully along
the compass card at the low bluff, like two gunners laying a
piece of heavy ordnance for an important shot. The steward,
emerging out of the companion, rang a handbell violently, and
remained scared at the failure of that appeal. After waiting for
a moment, he produced a further feeble tinkle, and sank down out
of sight, with resignation.</p>
<p>A white sun, as if blazing with the pallor of fury, swung past
the zenith in a profound and universal stillness. There was not a
wrinkle on the sea; it presented a lustrous and glittering level,
like the polished facet of a gem. In the cabin we sat down to the
meal, not even pretending a desire to eat, exchanging vague
phrases, hanging our heads over the empty plates. But the regular
footsteps of the boatswain left in charge hesitated, stopped near
the skylight. He said in an imperfectly assured voice, "Seems as
if there was a steadier draught coming now." At this we rose from
the table impetuously, as though he had shouted an alarm of fire,
and Mrs. Williams, with a little cry, ran round to Seraphina.
Leaving the two women locked in a silent embrace, the captain,
Sebright and myself hurried out on deck.</p>
<p>Every man in the ship had done the same. Even the shiny black
cook had come out of his galley, and was already comfortably
seated on the rail, baring his white teeth to the sunshine.</p>
<p>"Just about enough to blow out a farthing dip," said Sebright,
in a disappointed mutter.</p>
<p>He thought, however, we had better not wait for more. There
would be too much presently. Some sailors hauled the boat
alongside, the rest lined the rail as for a naval spectacle, and
Williams stared blankly. We were waiting for Seraphina, who
appeared, attended by Mrs. Williams, looking more kind,
bloodless, and ascetic than ever. But my girl's cheeks glowed;
her eyes sparkled audaciously. She had done up her hair in some
way that made it fit her head like a cap. It became her
exceedingly, and the decision of her movements, the white
serenity of her brow, dazzled me as if I had never seen her
before. She seemed less childlike, older, ripe for this adventure
in a new development of strength and courage. She inclined her
head slowly at the gaping sailors, who had taken their caps
off.</p>
<p>As soon as she appeared, Castro, who had been leaning against
the bulwark, started up, and with a muttered "<i>Adios,
Se&ntilde;ores</i>," went down the overside ladder and ensconced
himself in the bow of the boat. The leave-taking was hurried
over. Williams gave no sign of feeling, except, perhaps, for the
greater intensity of his stare, which passed beyond our shoulders
in the very act of handshaking. Sebright helped Seraphina down
into the boat, and ran up again nimbly. Mrs. Williams, with her
slim hand held in both mine, uttered a few incoherent
words&mdash;about men's promises and the happiness of women, as I
thought; but, truth to say, my own suppressed excitement was too
considerable for close attention. I only knew that I had given
her my confidence, that complete and utter confidence which
neither wisdom nor power alone, can command. And, suddenly, it
occurred to me that the heiress of a splendid name and fortune,
down in the boat there, had no better friend in the world than
this woman, who had come to us out of the waste of the sea,
opening her simple heart to our need, like a pious and naive
hermit in a wilderness throwing open the door of his cell to
strange wayfarers.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Williams," I stammered. "If we&mdash;if I&mdash;there's
no saying what may happen to any of us. If she ever comes to
you&mdash;if she ever is in want of help..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Always, always&mdash;like my own daughter."</p>
<p>And the good woman broke down, as if, indeed, I were taking
her own daughter away.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, Mary!" Williams advanced, muttering tremendously.
"They are not going round the world. Dare say get ashore in time
for supper."</p>
<p>He stared through her without expression, as if she had been
thin air, but she seized his arm, of course, and he gave me,
then, an amazingly rapid wink which, I suppose, meant that I
should go...</p>
<p>"All right there?" asked Sebright from above, as soon as I had
taken my seat in the stern sheets by the side of Seraphina. He
was standing on the poop deck ready with a sign for letting go
the end of our painter on deck; but before I could answer in the
affirmative, Castro, ensconced forward under his hat, drew his
ready blade across the rope, as it were a throat.</p>
<p>At once a narrow strip of water opened between the boat and
the ship, and our long-prepared departure, hastened thus by half
a second, seemed to strike everybody dumb with surprise, as if we
had taken wings to ourselves to fly away. Hastily I grasped the
tiller to give the boat a sheer, and heard a sort of loud gasp in
the air above. A row of heads, posed on chins all along the rail,
stared after us with unanimous fixity. Mrs. Williams averted her
face on her husband's shoulder. Behind the couple, Sebright
raised his cap gravely.</p>
<p>Our little sail filled to a breeze which was much too feeble
to produce a perceptible effect on the ship, and we left behind
us her towering form, as one recedes from a tall white spire on a
plain. I laid the boat's head straight for the dwarf headland,
marking the mouth of the inlet on the interminable range of
sand-dunes. We drove on with a smart ripple, but before we felt
sufficiently settled to exchange a few words the animated sound
languished suddenly, paused altogether, and, with a renewed
murmur under our feet seemed to lose itself below the glassy
waters. <a name="2HCH0025"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
<p>The calm had returned. The sea, changing from the warm glitter
of a gem, and attuned to the grays and blacks of space, resembled
a monstrous cinder under a sky of ashes.</p>
<p>The sun had disappeared, smothered in these clouds that had
formed themselves all at once and everywhere, like some swift
corruption of the upper air. For the best part of the afternoon
the ship and the boat remained lying at right angles, within half
a mile of each other. What light was left in the world, cut off
from the source of life, seemed to sicken with a strange decay.
The long stretch of sands and the sails of the motionless vessel
stood out lividly pale in universal gloom. And yet the state of
the atmosphere was such that we could see clear-cut the very
folds in the steep face of the dunes, and the figures of the
people moving on the poop of the <i>Lion</i>. There was always
somebody there that had the aspect of watching us. Then, with
some excitement, we saw them on board haul up the mainsail and
lower the gig.</p>
<p>The four oars beat the sombre water, rising and falling
apparently in the same place. She was an interminable time coming
on, but as she neared us I was surprised at her dashing speed.
Sebright, who steered, laid her alongside smartly, and two of his
men, clambering over without a word, lowered our lug at once.</p>
<p>"We came to reef your sail for you. You couldn't manage that
very well with a one-armed crew," said the young mate quietly in
the enormous stillness. In his opinion, we couldn't expect now
any wind till the first squall came down. This flurry, as he
called it, would send us in smoking, and he was sure it would
help the ship, as well, into Havana, in about twenty-four hours.
He didn't think that it would come <i>very</i> heavy at first;
and, once landed, we need not care how hard it blew.</p>
<p>He tendered me over the gunwale a pocket-flask covered with
leather, and with a screwed silver stopper in the shape of a cup.
It was from the captain; full of prime rum. We were pretty sure
to get wet. He thrust, also, into my hands a gray woollen shawl.
Mrs. Williams thought my young lady might be glad of it at night.
"The dear old woman has shut herself up inside their stateroom,
and is praying for you now," he concluded. "Look alive,
boys."</p>
<p>His men did not answer him, but at some words he addressed to
Castro, the latter, in the bows and looking at the coast, growled
with a surly impatience. He was perfectly sure of the entrance.
Had been in and out several times. Yes. At night, too. Sebright
then turned to me. After all, it was not so difficult. The inlet
bore due south from us, and the wind would come true from the
north. Always did in these bursts. I had only to keep dead before
it. "The clouds will light you in at the last," he added
meaningly, glancing upwards.</p>
<p>The two sailors, having finished reefing, hoisted, lowered,
and hoisted again the yard to see that the gear ran clear, and
without one look at us, stepped back into the gig, and sat down
in their places. For a moment longer we lay together, touching
sides. Sebright extended his hand from boat to boat.</p>
<p>"You are in God's care now, Kemp," he said, looking up at me,
and with an unexpected depth of feeling in his tone. "Take no
turn with the sheet on any account, and if you feel it coming too
heavy, let fly and chance it. Did I tell you we have sighted the
schooner from aloft? No? We can just make her out from the
main-yard away astern under the land. That don't matter
now...Se&ntilde;orita, I kiss your hands." He liked to air his
Spanish..."Keep cool whatever happens. Dead before it&mdash;mind.
And count on sixteen days from to-morrow. Well. No more. Give
way, boys."</p>
<p>He never looked back. We watched the boat being hoisted and
secured. Shortly afterwards, as we were observing the Lion
shortening sail, the first of the rain descended between her and
us like a lowered veil. For a time she remained mistily visible,
dark and gaunt with her bared spars. The downpour redoubled; she
disappeared; and our hearts were stirred to a faster beat.</p>
<p>The shower fell on us, around us, descending perpendicularly,
with a steady force; and the thunder rolled far off, as if coming
from under the sea. Sometimes the muffled rumbling stopped, and
let us hear plainly the gentle hiss and the patter of the drops
falling upon a vast expanse. Suddenly, mingled with a loud
detonation right over our heads, a burst of light outlined under
the bellying strip of our sail the pointed crown of Castro's hat,
reposing on a heap of black clothing huddled in the bows. The
darkness swallowed it all. I swung Seraphina in front of me, and
made her sit low on the stern sheets beneath my feet. A lot of
foam boiled up around the boat, and we had the sensation of
having been sent flying from a catapult.</p>
<p>Everything was black&mdash;perfectly black. At intervals,
headlong gusts of rain swept over our heads. I suppose I did keep
sufficiently cool, but in every flash of lightning the wind, the
sea, the clouds, the rain, and the boat appeared to rush together
thundering upon the coast. The line of sands, bordered with a
belt of foam, zigzagged dazzlingly upon an earth as black as the
clouds; only the headland, with every vision, remained sombre and
unmoved. At last it rose up right before the boat. Blue lightning
streamed on a lane of tumbling waters at its foot. Was this the
entrance? With the vague notion of shortening sail, I let the
sheet go from my hand. There was a jerk, the crack of snapped
wood, and the next flash showed me Castro emerging from the ruins
of mast and sail. He uprose, hurling the wreck from him
overboard, then flickered out of sight with his arm waving to the
left, and I bore accordingly on the tiller. In a moment I saw him
again, erect forward, with the arm pointing to the right, and I
obeyed his signal. The clouds, straining with water and fire,
were, indeed, lighting us on our way. A wave swelled astern,
chasing us in; rocking frightfully, we glanced past a stationary
mass of foam&mdash;a sandbar&mdash;breakers...It was terrible...
Suddenly, the motion of the boat changed, and the flickers of
lightning fell into a small, land-locked basin. The wind tore
deep furrows in it, howling and scuffling behind the dunes. Spray
flew from the whole surface, the entire pool of a bay seemed to
heave bodily upwards, and I saw Castro again, with his face to me
this time. His black cloak was blowing straight out from his
throat, his mouth yawned wide; he shouted directions, but in an
instant darkness sealed my eyes with its impenetrable impress. It
was impossible to steer now; the boat swung and reeled where she
listed; a violent shock threw me sideways off my seat. I felt her
turning over, and, gathering Seraphina in my arms, I leaped out
before she capsized. I leaped clear out into shallow water.</p>
<p>I should never in my life have thought myself capable of such
a feat, and yet I did it with assurance, with no effort that I
can remember. More than that&mdash;I managed, after the leap, to
keep my feet in the clinging, staggering clutch of water charged
with sand, which swirled heavily about my knees. It kept on
hurling itself at my legs from behind, while I waded across the
narrow strip of sand with an inspired firmness of step defying
all the power of the elements. I felt the harder ground at last,
but not before I had caught a momentary glimpse of a black and
bulky object tumbling over and over in the advancing and
withdrawing liquid flurry of the beach.</p>
<p>"Sit still here on the ground," I shouted to Seraphina, though
flights of spray enveloped us completely. "I am going back for
Castro."</p>
<p>I faced about, putting my head down. He had been undoubtedly
knocked over; and an old man, with only one hand to help himself
with, ran a very serious risk of being buffeted into
insensibility, and thus coming to his death in some four feet of
water. The violent glare disclosed a body, entangled in a cloak,
rolling about helplessly between land and water, as it were. I
dashed on in the dark; a wave went over my head as I stooped,
nearly waist-deep, groping. His rotary motion, in that smother,
made it extremely difficult to obtain any sort of hold. A little
more, and he would have knocked my legs from under me, but it was
as if my grim determination were by itself of a saving nature. He
submitted to being hauled up the beach, passively, like a sack.
It was a heavy drag on the sand; I felt him bump behind me on the
edge of the harder ground, and a deluge fell uninterruptedly from
above. He lay prone on his face, like a corpse, between Seraphina
and myself. We could not remain there, however.</p>
<p>But where to go? What to do? In what direction to look for a
refuge? Was there any shelter near by? How were we to reach it?
How were we to move at all? No doubt he had expired; and the
earth, swept, deluged, glimmering fiercely and devastated with an
awful uproar, appeared no longer habitable. A thunder-clap seemed
to crash new life into him; the world flared all round, as if
turning to a spark, and he was seen sitting up dazedly, like one
called up from the dead. Through it all he had preserved his
hat.</p>
<p>It was fixed firmly down under his chin with a handkerchief,
the side rims over his ears like flaps, and, for the rest,
presenting the appearance of a coal-scuttle bonnet behind, as
well as in front. We followed its peculiar aspect. Driving on
under this indestructible headgear, he flickered in and out of
the world, while, with entwined arms and leaning back against the
wind with all our might, Seraphina and myself were borne along in
his train. He knew of a shelter; and this knowledge, perhaps, and
also his evident familiarity with the topography of the country,
made him appear indomitably confident in the storm.</p>
<p>A small plain of coarse grass was bounded by the steep spur of
a rise. To the left a little river would burst, all at once, in
all its windings into a bluish sulphurous glow; and between the
crashes of thunder there was heard the long-drawn, whistling
swish of the rushes and cane-brakes springing on the boggy
ground. We skirted the rise. The rain beat against it; the
lightning showed its streaming and furrowed surface. We stumbled
in the gusts. We felt under our feet, mud, sand, rocky
inequalities of the ground, and the moving stones in the bed of a
torrent, which broke headlong against our ankles. The entrance of
a deep ravine opened.</p>
<p>Its lower sides palpitated with the ceaseless tossing of dwarf
trees and bushes; and, motionless above the sombre tumult of the
slopes, the monumental stretch of bare rock rose on high, level
at the top, and emitting a ghastly yellow sheen in the flashes.
The thunderclaps rolled ponderously between the narrowing walls
of that chasm, that was all aflame one moment, and all black the
next. A torrent springing at its head, and dashing with inaudible
fury along the bottom, seemed to gleam placidly amongst the
rounded forms of inky bushes and pale boulders below our path.
Enormous eddies of wind from above made us stop short and totter
breathless, clinging to each other.</p>
<p>Castro sustained Seraphina on the other side; but frequently
he had to leave us and move ahead, looking for the way. There
was, in fact, a half-obliterated path winding along the less
steep of the two sides; and we struggled after our guide with the
unthinking fortitude of despair. He was being disclosed to us so
suddenly, extinguished so swiftly, that he appeared, always, as
if motionless and posturing in a variety of climbing attitudes.
The rise of the bottom was very steep, and the last hundred yards
really stiff. We did them practically on our hands and knees. The
dislodged stones bounded away from under our feet, unheard, like
puff-balls.</p>
<p>At the top I tried to make of my body a shelter for Seraphina.
The wind howled and roared over us. "Up! <i>Vamos!</i> The worst
is yet before us," shrieked Castro in my ear.</p>
<p>What could he mean by this? The play of lightning opened to
view only a vast and rolling upland. Fire flowed in sheets
undulating with the expanses of long grass amongst the trees,
here and there, in coal-black clumps, and flashed violently
against a low edge of forests very dark and far away.</p>
<p>"Let us go!" he cried. "Courage, Se&ntilde;orita!"</p>
<p>Courage! The populace said of her that she had never needed to
put her foot to the ground. If courage consists, for a being so
tender, in toiling and enduring without faltering and
plaint,&mdash;even to the very limit of physical
power,&mdash;then she was the most courageous woman in the world,
as she was the most charming, most faithful, most generous, and
the most worthy of love. I tried not to think of her racked
limbs, for the very pain and pity of it. We retraced our steps,
but now following the edge of that precipice out of which we had
emerged. I had peremptorily insisted on carrying her. She put her
arms round my neck and, to my uplifted heart, she weighed no
heavier than a feather. Castro, grasping my arm, guided my steps
and gave me support against the wind.</p>
<p>There was a distinct lull. Even the thunder had rolled away,
dwindling to a deep mutter. Castro fell on his knees in front of
me.</p>
<p>"It is here," I heard him scream.</p>
<p>I set Seraphina down. A hooked dart of fire tore in two the
thick canopy of clouds. I started back from the edge.</p>
<p>"What! Here?" I yelled.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or&mdash;<i>Si!</i> There is a cavern below..."</p>
<p>I had seen a ledge clinging to the face of the rock.</p>
<p>It was a cornice inclining downwards upon the wall of the
precipice, as you see, sometimes, a flight of stairs built
against the outside wall of a house. And it resembled a stair
roughly, with long, sloping steps, wet with rain.</p>
<p>"<i>Por Dios</i>, Se&ntilde;or, do not let us stay to think
here, or we shall perish in this tempest."</p>
<p>He howled, gesticulated, shrieked with all the strength of his
lungs. He knew these tornadoes. Brute beasts would be found lying
dead in the fields in the morning. This was the beginning only.
The lightning showed his kneeling form, the eager upturned face,
and a finger pointing urgently into the abyss. The wind was
nothing! Nothing to what would come after. As he shrieked these
words I was feeling the crust of the earth vibrate, absolutely
vibrate, under the soles of my feet, with the sound of
thunder.</p>
<p>He unfastened his cloak, and was seen to struggle above his
head with the hovering and flapping cloth, as though he had
captured a black and pugnacious bird. We mastered at last a
corner each, and then we started to twist the whole, as if to
wring the water out. We produced, thus, a sort of short rope, the
thickness of a cable, and the descent began.</p>
<p>"Do not look behind you. Do not look," Castro screeched.</p>
<p>The first downward steps were terrible, but as soon as our
heads had sunk below the level of the plain it was better, for we
had turned about to the rock, moving sideways, cautiously, one
step at a time, as if inspecting its fractured roughness for
traces of a mysterious inscription. Castro, with one end of the
twisted cloak in his hand, went first; I held the other; and
between us, Seraphina, the rope at her back, imitated our
movements, with her loosened hair flying high in the wind, and
her pale, rigid head as if deaf to the crashes. I saw the drawn
stillness of her face, her dilated eyes staring within three
inches of the strata. The strain on our prudence was tremendous.
The knowledge of the precipice behind must have affected me.
Explain it as you will, several times during that descent I felt
my brain slip away from my control, and suggest a desire to fling
myself over backwards. The twigs of the bushes, growing a little
below the outer edge of the path, swished at my calves. Castro
stopped. The cornice ended as a broken stairway hangs upon
nothing. A tall, narrow arch stood back in the rock, with a sill
three feet high at least. Castro clambered over; his head and
torso, when he turned about, were lighted up blindingly between
the inner walls at every flash. Seeing me lay hold of Seraphina,
he yelled:</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, mind! It's death if you stagger back."</p>
<p>I lifted her up, and put her over like a child; and, no sooner
in myself, felt my strength leave all my limbs as water runs out
of an overturned vessel. I could not have lifted up a child's
doll then. Directly, with a wild little laugh, she said to
me:</p>
<p>"Juan&mdash;I shall never dare come out."</p>
<p>I hugged her silently to my breast.</p>
<p>Castro went ahead. It was a narrow passage; our elbows touched
the sides all the way. He struck at his flint regularly, sparks
streamed down from his hand; we felt a freshness, a sense of
space, as though we had come into another world. His voice
directed us to turn to the left, then cried in the dark, "Stand
still." A blue gleam darted after us, and retired without having
done anything against the tenebrous body of gloom, and the
thunder rolled far in, unobstructed, in leisurely, organ-like
peals, as if through an amazingly vast emptiness of a temple. But
where was Castro? We heard snappings, rustlings, mutters; sparks
streamed, now here, now there. We dared not move. There might
have been steep ridges&mdash;deep holes in that cavern. And
suddenly we discovered him on all-fours, puffing out his cheeks
above a small flame kindled in a heap of dry sticks and
leaves.</p>
<p>It was an abode of darkness, enormous, without sonority.
Feeble currents of air, passing on our faces, gave us a feeling
of being in the open air on a night more black than any known
night had been before. One's voice lost itself in there without
resonance, as if on a plain; the smoke of our blaze drove aslant,
scintillating with red sparks, and went trailing afar, as if
under the clouds of a starless sky. Ultimately, it must have
escaped through some imperceptible crevices in the roof of rock.
In one place, only, the light of the fire illuminated a small
part of the rugged wall, where the shadows of our bodies would
surge up, repeating our movements, and suddenly be gone from our
sight. Everywhere else, pressing upon the reflection of the
flames, the blind darkness of the vault might have extended away
for miles and miles.</p>
<p>Castro thought it probable. He made me observe the incline of
the floor. It sloped down deep and far. For miles, no doubt.
Nobody could tell; no one had seen the end of it. This cavern had
been known of old. This brushwood, these dead leaves, that would
make a couch for her Excellency, had been stored for
years&mdash;perhaps by men who had died long ago. Look at the dry
rot. These large piles of branches were found stacked up when he
first beheld this place. <i>Caramba!</i> What toil! What fatigue!
Let us thank the saints, however.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he shook his head at the strangeness of it. His
cloak, spread out wide, was drying in the light, while he busied
himself with his hat, turning it before the blaze in both hands,
tenderly; and his tight little figure, lit up in front from head
to foot, steamed from every limb. His round, plump shoulders and
gray-shock head smoked quietly at the top. Suddenly, the fine
mesh of wrinkles on his face ran together, shrinking like a torn
cobweb; a spasmodic sound, quite new to me, was heard. He had
laughed.</p>
<p>The warmth of the fire had penetrated our chilled bodies with
a feeling of comfort and repose. Williams' flask was empty; and
this was a new Castro, mellowed, discoursive, almost genial. It
was obvious to me that, had it not been for him, we two, lost and
wandering in the storm, should have died from exposure and
exhaustion&mdash;from some accident, perhaps. On the other hand I
had indubitably saved his life, and he had already thanked me in
high-flown language; very grave, but exaggerating the horrors of
his danger, as a woman might have done for the better expression
of gratitude. He had been greatly shocked. Spaniards, as a race,
have never, for all their conquests, been on intimate terms with
the sea. As individuals I have often observed in them, especially
in the lower classes, a sort of dread, a dislike of salt water,
mingled with contempt and fear.</p>
<p>Castro, lifting up his right arm, protested that I had given a
proof of very noble devotion in rushing back for an old man into
that black water. Ough! He shuddered. He had given himself
up&mdash;<i>por Dios!</i> He hinted that, at his age, he could
not have cared much for life; but then, drowning in the sea was a
death abhorrent to an old Christian. You died
brutally&mdash;without absolution, and unable, even, to think of
your sins. He had had his mouth filled with horrid, bitter sand,
too. Tfui! He gave me a thousand thanks. But these English were
wonderful in their way...Ah! <i>Caramba!</i> They were...</p>
<p>A large protuberance of the rocky floor had been roughly
chipped into the semblance of a seat, God only knows by what
hands and in what forgotten age. Seraphina's inclined pose, her
torn dress, the wet tresses lying over her shoulders, her
homeless aspect, made me think of a beautiful and miserable gipsy
girl drying her hair before a fire. A little foot advanced,
gleamed white on the instep in front of the ruddy glare; her
clasped fingers nursed one raised knee; and, shivering no longer,
her head drooping in still profile, she listened to us, frowning
thoughtfully upon the flames.</p>
<p>In the guise of a beggar-maid, and fair, like a fugitive
princess of romance, she sat concealed in the very heart of her
dominions. This cavern belonged to her, as Castro remarked, and
the bay of the sea, and the earth above our heads, the rolling
upland, herds of cattle, fields of sugar-cane&mdash;even as far
as the forest away there; the forest itself, too. And there were
on that estate, alone, over two hundred Africans, he was able to
tell us. He boasted of the wealth of the Riegos. Her Excellency,
probably, did not know such details. Two hundred&mdash;certainly.
The estate of Don Vincente Salazar was on the other side of the
river. Don Vincente was at present suffering the indignity of a
prison for a small matter of a quarrel with another
<i>caballero</i>&mdash;who had died lately&mdash;and all, he
understood, through the intrigues of the prior of a certain
convent; the uncle, they said, of the dead <i>caballero</i>. Bah!
There was something to get. These fat friars were like the lean
wolves of Russia&mdash;hungry for everything they could see.
Never enough, <i>Cuerpo de Bios!</i> Never enough! Like their
good friend who helped them in their iniquities, the Juez
O'Brien, who had been getting rich for years on the sublime
generosity of her Excellency's blessed father. In the greatness
of his nobility, Don Balthasar of holy memory had every right to
be obstinate...<i>Basta!</i> He would speak no more; only there
is a saying in Castile that fools and obstinate people make
lawyers rich...</p>
<p>"<i>Vuestra Se&ntilde;oria</i>," he cried, checking himself,
slapping his breast penitently, "deign to forgive me. I have been
greatly exalted by the familiarity of the two last men of your
house&mdash;allowed to speak freely because of my
fidelity...Alas! Alas!"</p>
<p>Seraphina, on the other side of the fire, made a vague
gesture, and took her chin in her hand without looking at
him.</p>
<p>"Patience," he mumbled to himself very audibly. "He is rich,
this picaro, O'Brien. But there is, also, a proverb&mdash;that no
riches shall avail in the day of vengeance."</p>
<p>Noticing that we had begun to whisper together, he threw
himself before the fire, and was silent.</p>
<p>"Promise me one thing, Juan," murmured Seraphina.</p>
<p>I was kneeling by the side of her seat.</p>
<p>"By all that's holy," I cried, "I shall force him to come out
and fight fair&mdash;and kill him as an English gentleman
may."</p>
<p>"Not that! Not that!" she interrupted me. She did not mean me
to do that. It was what she feared. It would be delivering myself
into that man's hands. Did I think what that meant? It would be
delivering her, too, into that man's power. She would not survive
it. And if I desired her to live on, I must keep out of O'Brien's
clutches.</p>
<p>"In my thoughts I have bound my life to yours, Juan, so fast
that the stroke which cuts yours, cuts mine, too. No death can
separate us."</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>And she took my head in her hands, and looked into my
eyes.</p>
<p>"No more mourning," she whispered rapidly. "No more. I am too
young to have a lover's grave in my life&mdash;and too proud to
submit..."</p>
<p>"Never," I protested ardently. "That couldn't be."</p>
<p>"Therefore look to it, Juan, that you do not sacrifice your
life which is mine, either to your
love&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;to revenge." She bowed her head; the
falling hair concealed her face. "For it would be in vain."</p>
<p>"The cloak is perfectly dry now, Se&ntilde;orita," said
Castro, reclining on his elbow on the edge of the darkness.</p>
<p>We two stepped out towards the entrance, leaving her on her
knees, in silent prayer, with her hands clasped on her forehead,
and leaning against the rugged wall of rock. Outside, the earth,
enveloped in fire and uproar, seemed to have been given over to
the fury of a devil.</p>
<p>Yes. She was right. O'Brien was a formidable and deadly enemy.
I wished ourselves on board the <i>Lion</i> chaperoned by Mrs.
Williams, and in the middle of the Atlantic. Nothing could make
us really safe from his hatred but the vastness of the ocean.
Meantime we had a shelter, for that night, at least, in this
cavern that seemed big enough to contain, in its black gloom of a
burial vault, all the dust and passions and hates of a
nation...</p>
<p>Afterwards Castro and I sat murmuring by the diminished fire.
He had much to say about the history of this cave. There was a
tradition that the ancient buccaneers had held their revels in
it. The stone on which the senorita had been sitting was supposed
to have been the throne of their chief. A ferocious band they
were, without the fear of God or devil&mdash;mostly English. The
Rio Medio picaroons had used this cavern, occasionally, up to a
year or so ago. But there were always ugly affairs with the
people on the estate&mdash;the <i>vaqueros</i>. In his younger
days Don Balthasar, having whole leagues of grass land here, had
introduced a herd of cattle; then, as the Africans are useless
for that work, he had ordered some peons from Mexico to be
brought over with their families&mdash;ignorant men, who hardly
knew how to make the sign of the cross. The quarrels had been
about the cattle, which the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> killed for
meat. The peons rode over them, and there were many wounds on
both sides. Then, the last time a Rio Medio schooner was lying
here (after looting a ship outside), there was some gambling
going on (they played round this very stone), and
Manuel&mdash;(<i>Si, Se&ntilde;or</i>, this same Manuel the
singer&mdash;<i>Bestia!</i>)&mdash;in a dispute over the stakes,
killed a peon, striking him unexpectedly with a knife in the
throat. No vengeance was taken for this, because the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> sailed away at once; but the widow made a
great noise, and some rumours came to the ears of Don Balthasar
himself&mdash;for he, Castro, had been honoured with a mission to
visit the estate. That was even the first occasion of Manuel's
hate for him&mdash;Castro. And, as usual, the Intendente after
all settled the matter as he liked, and nothing was done to
Manuel. Don Balthasar was old, and, besides, too great a noble to
be troubled with the doings of such vermin...And Castro began to
yawn.</p>
<p>At daybreak&mdash;he explained&mdash;he would start for the
<i>hacienda</i> early, and return with mules for Seraphina and
myself. The buildings of the estate were nearly three leagues
away. All this tract of the country on the side of the sea was
very deserted, the sugar-cane fields worked by the slaves lying
inland, beyond the habitations. Here, near the coast, there were
only the herds of cattle ranging the <i>savannas</i> and the
peons looking after them, but even they sometimes did not come in
sight of the sea for weeks together. He had no fear of being seen
by anybody on his journey; we, also, could start without fear in
daylight, as soon as he brought the mules. For the rest, he would
make proper arrangements for secrecy with the husband of
Seraphina's nurse&mdash;Enrico, he called him: a silent Galician;
a graybeard worthy of confidence.</p>
<p>One of his first cares had been to grub out of his soaked
clothes a handful of tobacco, and now he turned over the little
drying heap critically. He hunted up a fragment of maize leaf
somewhere upon his bosom. His face brightened. "<i>Bueno</i>," he
muttered, very pleased.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or&mdash;good-night," he said, more humanized than
I had supposed possible; or was it only that I was getting to
know him better? "And thanks. There's that in life which even an
old tired man...Here I, Castro...old and sad, Se&ntilde;or. Yes,
Se&ntilde;or&mdash;nothing of mine in all the world&mdash;and
yet...But what a death! Ouch! the brute water...<i>Caramba!</i>
Altogether improper for a man who has escaped from a great many
battles and the winter of Russia...The snow, Se&ntilde;or..."</p>
<p>He drowsed, garrulous, with the blackened end of his cigarette
hanging from his lower lip, swayed sideways&mdash;and let himself
go over gently, pillowing his head on the stump of his arm. The
thin, viperish blade, stuck upwards from under his temple,
gleamed red before the sinking fire.</p>
<p>I raised a handful of flaring twigs to look at Sera-phina. A
terrible night raged over the land; the inner arch of the opening
growled, winking bluishly time after time, and, like an enchanted
princess enveloped in a beggar's cloak, she was lying profoundly
asleep in the heart of her dominions. <a name="2HCH0026">

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
<p>The first thing I noted, on opening my eyes, was that Castro
had gone already; I was annoyed. He might have called me.
However, we had arranged everything the evening before. The broad
day, penetrating through the passage, diffused a semicircle of
twilight over the flooring. It extended as far as the emplacement
of the fire, black and cold now with a gray heap of ashes in the
middle. Farther away in the darkness, beyond the reach of light,
Seraphina on her bed of leaves did not stir. But what was that
hat doing there? Castro's hat. It asserted its existence more
than it ever did on the head of its master; black and rusty, like
a battered cone of iron, reposing on a wide flange near the
ashes. Then he was not gone. He would not start to walk three
leagues, bare-headed. He would appear presently; and I waited,
vexed at the loss of time. But he did not appear. "Castro," I
cried in an undertone. The leaves rustled; Seraphina sat up.</p>
<p>We were pleased to be with each other in an inexpugnable
retreat, to hear our voices untinged by anxiety; and, going to
the outer end of the short passage, we breathed with joy the pure
air. The tops of the bushes below glittered with drops of rain,
the sky was clear, and the sun, to us invisible, struck full upon
the face of the rock on the other side of the ravine. A great
bird soared, all was light and silence, and we forgot Castro for
a time. I threw my legs over the sill, and sitting on the stone
surveyed the cornice. The bright day robbed the ravine of half
its horrors. The path was rather broad, though there was a
frightful sheer drop of ninety feet at least. Two men could have
walked abreast on that ledge, and with a hand-rail one would have
thought nothing of it. The most dangerous part yet was at the
entrance, where it ended in a rounded projection not quite so
wide as the rest. I bantered Seraphina as to going out. She said
she was ready. She would shut her eyes, and take hold of my hand.
Englishmen, she had heard, were good at climbing. Their heads
were steady. Then we became silent. There were no signs of
Castro. Where could he have gone? What could he be doing? It was
unimaginable.</p>
<p>I grew nervous with anxiety at last, and begged Seraphina to
go in. She obeyed without a word, and I remained just within the
entrance, watching. I had no means to tell the time, but it
seemed to me that an hour or two passed. Hadn't we better, I
thought, start at once on foot for the <i>hacienda?</i> I did not
know the way, but by descending the ravine again to the sea, and
walking along the bank of the little river, I was sure to reach
it. The objection to this was that we should miss Castro. Hang
Castro! And yet there was something mysterious and threatening in
his absence. Could he&mdash;could he have stepped out for some
reason in the dark, perhaps, and tumbled off the cornice? I had
seen no traces of a slip&mdash;there would be none on the rock;
the twigs of the growth below the edge would spring back, of
course. But why should he fall? The footing was
good&mdash;however, a sudden attack of vertigo...I tried to look
at it from every side. He was not a somnambulist, as far as I
knew. And there was nothing to eat&mdash;I felt hungry
already&mdash;or drink. The want of water would drive us out very
soon to the spring bubbling out at the head of the ravine, a mile
in the open. Then why not go at once, drink, and return to our
lair as quickly as possible?</p>
<p>But I did not like to think of her going up and down the
cornice. I remembered that we had a flask, and went in hastily to
look for it. First, I looked near the hat; then, Seraphina and I,
bent double with our eyes on the ground examined every square
inch of twilight; we even wandered a long way into the darkness,
feeling about with our hands. It was useless! I called out to
her, and then we desisted, and coming together, wondered what
might have become of the thing. He had taken it&mdash;that was
clear.</p>
<p>But if, as one might suppose, he had taken it away to get some
water for us, he ought to have been back long before. I was
beginning to feel rather alarmed, and I tried to consider what we
had better do. It was necessary to learn, first, what had become
of him. Staring out of the opening, in my perplexity, I saw, on
the other side of the ravine, the lower part of a man from his
waist to his feet.</p>
<p>By crouching down at once, I brought his head into view. This
was not Castro. He wore a black sombrero, and on his shoulder
carried a gun. He turned his back on the ravine, and began to
walk straight away, sinking from my sight till only his hat and
shoulders remained visible. He lifted his arm then&mdash;straight
up&mdash;evidently as a signal, and waited. Presently another
head and shoulders joined him, and they glided across my line of
sight together. But I had recognized their bandit-like aspect
with infinite consternation. <i>Lu-garenos!</i></p>
<p>I caught Seraphina's hand. My first thought was that we should
have to steal out of the cavern with the first coming of
darkness. Castro must be lying low in hiding somewhere above. The
thing was plain. We must try to make our way to the
<i>hacienda</i> under the cover of the night, unseen by those two
men. Evidently they were emissaries sent from Rio Medio to watch
this part of the coast against our possible landing. I was to be
hunted down, it seems: and I reproached myself bitterly with the
hardships I was bringing upon her continually. Thinking of the
fatigues she had undergone&mdash;(I did not think of
dangers&mdash;that was another thing&mdash;the romance of dying
together like all the lovers in the tradition of the
world)&mdash;I shook with rage and exasperation. The firm
pressure of her hands calmed me. She was content. But what if
they took it into their heads to come into the cavern?</p>
<p>The emptiness of the blue sky above the sheer yellow rock
opposite was frightful. It was a mere strip, stretched like a
luminous bandage over our eyes. They were, perhaps, even now on
their way round the head of the ravine. I had no weapon except
the butt of my pistol. The charges had been spoilt by the salt
water, of course, and I had been tempted to fling it out of my
belt, but for the thought of obtaining some powder somewhere. And
those men I had seen were armed. At once we abandoned the
neighbourhood of the entrance, plunging straight away into the
profound obscurity of the cave. The rocky ground under our feet
had a gentle slope, then dipped so sharply as to surprise us; and
the entrance, diminishing at our backs, shone at last no larger
than the entrance of a mouse-hole. We made a few steps more,
gropingly. The bead of light disappeared altogether when we sat
down, and we remained there hand-in-hand and silent, like two
frightened children placed at the centre of the earth. There was
not a sound, not a gleam. Sera-phina bore the crushing strain of
this perfect and black stillness in an almost heroic immobility;
but, as to me, it seemed to lie upon my limbs, to embarrass my
breathing like a numbness full of dread; and to shake that
feeling off I jumped up repeatedly to look at that luminous bead,
that point of light no bigger than a pearl in the infinity of
darkness. And once, just as I was looking, it shut and opened at
me slowly, like the deliberate drooping and rising of the lid
upon a white eyeball.</p>
<p>Somebody had come in.</p>
<p>We watched side by side. Only one. Would he go out? The point
of light, like a white star setting in a coal-black firmament,
remained uneclipsed. Whoever had entered was in no haste to
leave. Moreover, we had no means of telling what another
obscuring of the light might mean; a departure or another
arrival. There were two men about, as we knew; and it was even
possible that they had entered together in one wink of the light,
treading close upon each other's heels. We both felt the sudden
great desire to know for certain. But, especially, we needed to
find out if perchance this was not Castro who had returned. We
could not afford to lose his assistance. And should he conclude,
we were out&mdash;should he risk himself outside again, in order
to find us and be discovered himself, and thus lost to us when we
felt him so necessary? And the doubt came. If this man was
Castro, why didn't he penetrate further, and shout our names? He
ought to have been intelligent enough to guess...And it was this
doubt that, making suspense intolerable, put us in motion.</p>
<p>We circled widely in that subterranean darkness, which, unlike
the darkest night on the surface of the earth, had no suggestion
of shape, no horizon, and seemed to have no more limit than the
darkness of infinite space. On this floor of solid rock we moved
with noiseless steps, like a pair of timid phantoms. The spot of
light grew in size, developed a shape&mdash;stretching from a
pearly bead to a silvery thread; and, approaching from the side,
we scanned from afar the circumscribed region of twilight about
the opening. There was a man in it. We contemplated for a time
his rounded back, his drooping head. It was gray. The man was
Castro. He sat rocking himself sorrowfully over the ashes. He was
mourning for us. We were touched by this silent faithfulness of
grief.</p>
<p>He started when I put my hand on his shoulder, looked up,
then, instead of giving any signs of joy, dropped his head
again.</p>
<p>"You managed to avoid them, Castro?" I said.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, behold. Here I am. I, Castro."</p>
<p>His tone was gloomy, and after sitting still for a while under
our gaze, he slapped his forehead violently. He was in his
tantrums, I judged, and, as usual, angry with me&mdash;the cause
of every misfortune. He was upset and annoyed beyond reason, as I
thought, by this new difficulty. It meant delay&mdash;a certain
measure of that sort of danger of which we had thought ourselves
free for a time&mdash;night travelling for Seraphina. But I had
an idea to save her this. We did not all want to go. Castro could
start, alone, for the <i>hacienda</i> after dark, and bring,
besides the mules, half a dozen peons with him for an escort.
There was nothing really to get so upset about. The danger would
have been if he had let himself be caught. But he had not. As to
his temper, I knew my man; he had been amiable too long. But by
this time we were so sure of his truculent devotion that
Seraphina spoke gently to him, saying how anxious we had
been&mdash;how glad we were to see him safe with us... He would
not be conciliated easily, it seemed, and let out only a
blood-curdling dismal groan. Without looking at her, he tried
hastily to make a cigarette. He was very clever at it generally,
rolling it with one hand on his knee somehow; but this time all
his limbs seemed to shake, he lost several pinches of tobacco,
dropped the piece of maize leaf. Seraphina, stooping over his
shoulder, took it up, twisted the thing swiftly. "Take,
<i>amigo</i>," she said.</p>
<p>He was looking up at her, as if struck dumb, roiling his eye
wildly. He jumped up.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;Se&ntilde;orita! For a miserable old man! You break
my heart."</p>
<p>And with long strides he disappeared in the darkness, leaving
us wondering.</p>
<p>We sat side by side on the couch of leaves. With Castro there
I felt we were quite equal to dealing with the two
Lugare&ntilde;os if they had the unlucky idea of intruding upon
us. Indeed, a vigilant man, posted on one side of the end of the
passage, could have disputed the entrance against ten, twenty,
almost any number, as long as he kept his strength and had
something heavy enough to knock them over. Faint sounds reached
me, as if at a great distance Castro had been shouting to
himself. I called to him. He did not answer, but unexpectedly his
short person showed itself in the brightest part of the
light.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or!" he called out with a strange intonation. I got
up and went to him. He seemed to be listening intently with his
ear turned to the opening. Then suddenly:</p>
<p>"Look at me, Se&ntilde;or. Am I Castro&mdash;the same Castro?
old and friendless?"</p>
<p>He stood biting his forefinger and looking up at me from under
his knitted eyebrows. I didn't know what to say. What was this
nonsense?</p>
<p>He ejaculated a sort of incomprehensible babble, and, passing
by me, rushed towards Seraphina; she sat up, startled, on her
couch of leaves. Falling before her on his plump knees, he seized
her hand, pressed it against his ragged moustache.</p>
<p>"Excellency, forgive me! No&mdash;no forgiveness! Ha! old man!
Ha&mdash;thou old man..."</p>
<p>He bowed before her shadowy figure, that sustained the pale
oval of the face, till his forehead struck the rock. Plunging his
hand into the ashes, he poured a fistful with inarticulate low
cries over his gray hairs; and the agitation of that obese little
body on its knees had a lamentable and grotesque inconsequence,
as inexplicable in itself as the sorrow of a madman. Full of
wonder before his abject collapse, she murmured:</p>
<p>"What have you done?"</p>
<p>He tried to fling himself upon her feet, but my hand was in
his collar, and after an unmerciful shaking, I sat him down by
main force. He gulped, blinked the whites of his eyes, then, in a
whisper full of rage:</p>
<p>"Horror, shame, misery, and malediction; I have betrayed
you."</p>
<p>At once she said soothingly, "Tomasr I do not believe this";
while I thought to myself: How? Why? For what reason? In what
manner betrayed? How was it possible? And, if so, why did he come
back to us? But, as things stood, he would never dare approach a
Lugare&ntilde;o. If he had, they would never have let him go
again.</p>
<p>"You told them we were here?" I asked, so perfectly
incredulous that I was not at all surprised to hear him protest,
by all the saints, that he never did&mdash;never would do. Never.
Never...But why should he? Was he the prey of some strange
hallucination? Rocking himself, he struck his breast with his
clenched hand, then suddenly caught at his hair and remained
perfectly motionless. Minutes passed; this despairing stillness
inspired in me a feeling of awe at last&mdash;the awe of
something inconceivable. My head buzzed so with the effort to
think that I had the illusions of faint murmurs in the cave, the
very shadows of murmurs. And all at once a real voice&mdash;his
voice&mdash;burst out fearfully rapid and voluble.</p>
<p>He had really gone out to get a provision of water. Waking up
early, he saw us sleeping, and felt a great pity for the
senorita. As to the <i>caballero</i>&mdash;his saviour from
drowning, alas!&mdash;the senorita would need every ounce of his
strength. He would let us sleep till his return from the spring;
and, there being a blessed freshness in the air, he caught up the
flask and started bare-headed. The sun had just risen. Would to
God he had never seen it! After plunging his face in the running
water, he remained on his knees and busied himself in rinsing and
filling the flask. The torrent, gushing with force, made a loud
noise, and after he had done screwing the top on, he was about to
rise, when, glancing about carelessly, he saw two men leaning on
their <i>escopetas</i> and looking at him in perfect silence.
They were standing right over him; he knew them well; one they
called El Rubio; the other, the little one, was
Jos&eacute;&mdash;squinting Jos&eacute;. They said nothing;
nothing at all. With a sudden and mighty effort he preserved his
self-command, affected unconcern and, instead of getting up, only
shifted his pose to a sitting position, took off his shoes and
stockings, and proceeded to bathe his feet. But it was as if a
blazing fire had been kindled in his breast, and a tornado had
been blowing in his head.</p>
<p>He could not tell whence these two had come, with what object,
or how much they knew. They might have been only messengers from
Rio Medio to Havana. They generally went in couples. If Manuel
had escaped alive out of the sea, everything was known in Rio
Medio. From where he sat he beheld the empty, open sea over the
dunes, but the edge of the upland, cleft by many ravines (of
which the one we had ascended was the deepest), concealed from
him the little basin and the inlet. He was certain these men had
not come up that way. They had approached him over the plain. But
there was more than one way by which the upland could be reached
from below. The thoughts rushed round and round his head. He
remembered that our boat must be floating or lying stranded in
the little bay, and resolved, in case of necessity, to say that
we two were dead, that we had been drowned.</p>
<p>It was El Rubio who put the very question to him, in an
insolent tone, and sitting on the ground out of his reach, with
his gun across his knees. His long knife ready in his hand,
squinting Jos&eacute; remained standing over Castro. Those two
men nodded to each other significantly at the intelligence. He
perceived that they were more than half disposed to credit his
story. They had nearly been drowned themselves pursuing that
accursed heretic of an Englishman. When, from their remarks, he
learned that the schooner was in the bay, he began putting on his
shoes, though the hope of making a sudden dash for his life down
the ravine abandoned him.</p>
<p>The schooner had been run in at night during the gale, and in
such distress that they let her take the ground. She was not
injured, however, and some of them were preparing to haul her
off. Our boat, as I conceived, after bumping along the beach, had
drifted within the influence of the current created by the little
river, or else by the water forced into the basin by the tempest,
seeking to escape, and had been carried out towards the inlet.
She was seen at daylight, knocking about amongst the breakers,
bottom up, and in such shallow water that three or four men
wading out knee-deep managed to turn her over. They had found
Mrs. Williams' woollen shawl and my cap floating underneath. At
the same time the broken mast and sail were made out, tossing
upon the waves, not very far off to seaward. That the boat had
been in the bay at all did not seem to have occurred to them. It
had been concluded that she had capsized outside the entrance. It
was very possible that we had been drowned under her. Castro
hastened to confirm the idea by relating how he had been clinging
to the bottom of the boat for a long time. Thus he had saved
himself, he declared.</p>
<p>"Manuel will be glad," observed El Rubio then, with an evil
laugh. And for a long time nobody said a word.</p>
<p>El Rubio, cross-legged, was observing him with the eyes of a
basilisk, but Castro swore a great oath that, as to himself, he
showed no signs of fear. He looked at the water gushing from the
rock, bubbling up, sparkling, running away in a succession of
tiny leaps and falls. Why should he fear? Was he not old, and
tired, and without any hope of peace on earth? What was death?
Nothing. It was absolutely nothing. It comes to all. It was rest
after much vain trouble&mdash;and he trusted that, through his
devotion to the Mother of God, his sins would be forgiven after a
short time in purgatory. But, as he had made up his mind not to
fall into Manuel's hands, he resolved that presently he would
stab himself to the heart, where he sat&mdash;over this running
water. For it would not be like a suicide. He was doomed, and
surely God did not want his body to be tormented by such a devil
as Manuel before death.</p>
<p>He would lean far over before he struck his faithful blade
into his breast, so as to fall with his face in the water. It
looked deliciously cool, and the sun was heavy on his bare head.
Suddenly, El Rubio sprang to his feet, saying:</p>
<p>"Now, Jos&eacute;."</p>
<p>It is clear that these ruffians stood in awe of his blade. In
their cowardly hearts they did not think it quite safe (being
only two to one) to try and disarm that old man. They backed away
a step or two, and, levelling their pieces, suddenly ordered him
to get up and walk before. He threw at them an obscene word. He
thought to himself, "<i>Bueno!</i> They will blow my head off my
shoulders." No emotion stirred in him, as if his blood had
already ceased to run in his veins. They remained, all three, in
a state of suspended animation, but at last El Rubio hissed
through his teeth with vexation, and grunted:</p>
<p>"Attention, Jos&eacute;. Take aim. We will break his legs and
take away the sting of this old scorpion."</p>
<p>Castro's blood felt chilly in his limbs, but instead of
planting his knife in his breast, he spoke up to ask them where,
supposing he consented, they wished to conduct him.</p>
<p>"To Manuel&mdash;our captain. He would like to embrace you
before you die," said El Rubio, advancing a stride nearer, his
gun to his shoulder. "Get up! March!"</p>
<p>And Castro found himself on his feet, looking straight into
the black holes of the barrels.</p>
<p>"Walk!" they exclaimed together, stepping upon him.</p>
<p>The time had come to die.</p>
<p>"Ha! <i>Canalla!</i>" he said.</p>
<p>They made a menacing clamour, "Walk <i>viejo</i>, traitor;
walk."</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita&mdash;I walked." The heartrending effort of
the voice, the trembling of this gray head, the sobs under the
words, oppressed our breast with dismay and dread. Ardently he
would have us believe that at this juncture he was thinking of us
only&mdash;of us wondering, alone, ignorant of danger, and hidden
blindly under the earth. His purpose was to provoke the two
<i>Luga-re&ntilde;os</i> to shoot, so that we should be warned by
the reports. Besides, an opportunity for escape might yet present
itself in some most unlikely way, perhaps at the very last
moment. Had he not his own life in his own hands? He cared not
for it. It was in his power to end it at any time. And there
would be dense thickets on the way; long grass where one could
plunge suddenly&mdash;who knows! And overgrown ravines where one
could hide&mdash;creep under the bushes&mdash;escape&mdash;and
return with help...But when he faced the plains its greatness
crushed his poor strength. The uncovered vastness imprisoned him
as effectually as a wall. He knew himself for what he was: an old
man, short of breath, heavy of foot; nevertheless he walked on
hastily, his eyes on the ground. The footsteps of his captors
sounded behind him, and he tried to edge towards the ravine. When
nearly above the opening of the cavern he would, he thought,
swerve inland, and dash off as fast as he was able. Then they
would have to fire at him; we would be sure to hear the shots,
the warning would be clear...and suddenly, looking up, he saw
that a small band of <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>, having just
ascended the brow of the upland, were coming to meet him. Now was
the time to get shot; he turned sharply, and began to run over
that great plain towards a distant clump of trees.</p>
<p>Nobody fired at him. He heard only the mingled jeers and
shouts of the two men behind, "Quicker, Castro; quicker!" They
followed him, holding their sides. Those ahead had already spread
themselves out over the plain, yelling to each other, and were
converging upon him. That was the time to stop, and with one blow
fall dead at their feet. He doubled round in front of Manuel, who
stood waving his arms and screeching orders, and ran back towards
the ravine. The plain rang with furious shouts. They rushed at
him from every side. He would throw himself over. It was a race
for the precipice. He won it.</p>
<p>I suppose he found it not so easy to die, to part with the
warmth of sunshine, the taste of food; to break that material
servitude to life, contemptible as a vice, that binds us about
like a chain on the limbs of hopeless slaves. He showered blows
upon his chest, sitting before us, he battered with his fist at
the side of his head till I caught his arm. We could always sell
our lives dearly, I said. He would have to defend the entrance
with me. We two could hold it till it was blocked with their
corpses.</p>
<p>He jumped up with a derisive shriek; a cloud of ashes flew
from under his stumble, and he vanished in the darkness with mad
gesticulations.</p>
<p>"Their corpses&mdash;their corpses&mdash;their...Ha! ha!
ha!"</p>
<p>The snarling sound died away; and I understood, then, what
meant this illusion of ghostly murmurs that once or twice had
seemed to tremble in the narrow region of gray light around the
arch. The sunshine of the earth, and the voices of men, expired
on the threshold of the eternal obscurity and stillness in which
we were imprisoned, as if in a grave with inexorable death
standing between us and the free spaces of the world. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER NINE</h2>
<p>For it meant that. Imprisoned! Castro's derisive shriek meant
that. And I had known it before. He emerged back out of the black
depths, with livid, swollen features, and foam about his mouth,
to splutter:</p>
<p>"Their corpses, you say...Ha! Our corpses," and retreated
again, where I could only hear incoherent mutters.</p>
<p>Seraphina clutched my arm. "Juan&mdash;together&mdash;no
separation."</p>
<p>I had known it, even as I spoke of selling our lives dearly.
They could only be surrendered. Surrendered miserably to these
wretches, or to the everlasting darkness in which Castro muttered
his despair. I needed not to hear this ominous and sinister
sound&mdash;nor yet Seraphina's cry. She understood, too. They
would never come down unless to look upon us when we were dead. I
need not have gone to the entrance of the cave to understand all
the horror of our fate. The <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> had already
lighted a fire. Very near the brink, too.</p>
<p>It was burning some thirty feet above my head; and the sheer
wall on the other side caught up and sent across into my face the
crackling of dry branches, the loud excited talking, the
arguments, the oaths, the laughter; now and then a very shriek of
joy. Manuel was giving orders. Some advanced the opinion that the
cursed <i>Inglez</i>, the spy who came from Jamaica to see whom
he could get for a hanging without a priest, was down there, too.
So that was it! O'Brien knew how to stir their hate. I should get
a short shrift. "He was a fiend, the <i>Inglez</i>: look how many
of us he has killed!" they cried; and Manuel would have loved to
cut my flesh, in small pieces, off my bones&mdash;only, alas! I
was now beyond his vengeance, he feared. However, somebody was
left.</p>
<p>He must have thrown himself flat, with his head over the
brink, for his yell of "Castro!" exploded, and rolled heavily
between the rocks.</p>
<p>"Castro! Castro! Castro!" he shouted twenty times, till he set
the whole ravine in an uproar. He waited, and when the clamour
had quieted down amongst the bushes below, called out softly, "Do
you hear me, Castro, my victim? Thou art my victim, Castro."</p>
<p>Castro had crept into the passage after me. He pushed his head
beyond my shoulder.</p>
<p>"I defy thee, Manuel," he screamed.</p>
<p>A hubbub arose. "He's there! He is there!"</p>
<p>"Bravo, Castro," Manuel shouted from above. "I love thee
because thou art my victim. I shall sing a song for thee. Come
up. Hey! Castro! Castro! Come up...No? Then the dead to their
grave, and the living to their feast."</p>
<p>Sometimes a little earth, detached from the layer of soil
covering the rock, would fall streaming from above. The men told
off to guard the cornice walked to and fro near the edge, and the
confused murmur of voices hung subdued in the air of the cleft,
like a modulated tremor. Castro, moaning gently, stumbled back
into the cave.</p>
<p>Seraphina had remained sitting on the stone seat. The twilight
rested on her knees, on her face, on the heap of cold ashes at
her feet. But Castro, who had stood stock-still, with a hand to
his forehead, turned to me excitedly:</p>
<p>"The peons, <i>for Dios!</i>" Had I ever thought of the peons
belonging to the <i>estancia?</i></p>
<p>Well, that was a hope. I did not know exactly how matters
stood between them and the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>. There was no
love lost. A fight was likely; but, even if no actual collision
took place, they would be sure to visit the camp above in no very
friendly spirit; a chance might offer to make our position known
to these men, who had no reason to hate either me or
Castro&mdash;and would not be afraid of thwarting the miserable
band of ghouls sitting above our grave. How our presence could be
made known I was not sure. Perhaps simply by shouting with all
our might from the mouth of the cave. We could offer
rewards&mdash;say who we were, summon them for the service of
their own Se&ntilde;orita. But, probably, they had never heard of
her. No matter. The news would soon reach the <i>hacienda</i>,
and Enrico had two hundred slaves at his back. One of us must
always remain at the mouth of the cave listening to what went on
above. There would be the trampling of horses'
hoofs&mdash;quarrelling, no doubt&mdash;anyway, much
talk&mdash;new voices&mdash;something to inform us. Only, how
soon would they come? They were not likely to be riding where
there were no cattle. Had Castro seen any signs of a herd on the
uplands near by?</p>
<p>His face fell. He had not. There were many <i>savannas</i>
within the belt of forests, and the herds might be miles away,
stampeded inland by the storm. Sitting down suddenly, as if
overcome, he averted his eyes and began to scratch the rock
between his legs with the point of his blade.</p>
<p>We were all silent. How long could we wait? How long could
people live?...I looked at Seraphina. How long could she
live?...The thought seared my heart like a hot iron. I wrung my
hands stealthily.</p>
<p>"Ha! my blade!" muttered Castro. "My sting...Old scorpion!
They did not take my sting away...Only&mdash;bah!"</p>
<p>He, a man, had not risen to the fortitude of a venomous
creature. He was defeated. He groaned profoundly. Life was too
much. It clung to one. A scorpion&mdash;an insect&mdash;within a
ring of flames, would lift its sting and stab venom into its own
head. And he&mdash;Castro&mdash;a man&mdash;a man, <i>por
Dios</i>&mdash;had less firmness than a creeping thing.
Why&mdash;why, did he not stab this dishonoured old heart?</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," he cried agonizingly, "I swear I did shout
to them to fire&mdash;so&mdash;in to my breast&mdash;and
then..."</p>
<p>Seraphina leaned over him pityingly.</p>
<p>"Enough, Castro. One lives because of hope. And grieve not.
Thy death would have done no good."</p>
<p>Her face had a splendid pallor, the radiant whiteness and
majesty of marble; it had never before appeared to me more
beautiful: and her hair unrolling its dark undulations, as if
tinged deep with the funereal gloom of the background, covered
her magnificently right down to her elbows. Her eyes were
incredibly profound. Her person had taken on an indefinable
beauty, a new beauty, that, like the comeliness that comes from
joy, love, or success, seemed to rise from the depths of her
being, as if an unsuspected and sombre quality of her soul had
responded to the horror of our situation. The fierce trials had
gradually developed her, as burning sunshine opens the bud of a
flower; and I beheld her now in the plenitude of her nature. From
time to time Castro would raise up to her his blinking old eyes,
full of timidity and distress.</p>
<p>He had not been young enough to throw himself over&mdash;he
had worn the chain for too many years, had lived well and softly
too long, was too old a slave. And yet&mdash;if he had had the
courage of the act! Who knows? I rejected the thought far from
me. It returned, and I caught myself looking at him with
irritated eyes. But this first day passed not intolerably. We
ignored our sufferings. Indeed, I felt none for my part. We had
kept our thoughts bound to the slow blank minutes. And if we
exchanged a few words now and then, it was to speak of patience,
of resolution to endure and to hope.</p>
<p>At night, from the hot ravine full of shadows, came the cool
fretting of the stream. The big blaze they kept up above crackled
distinctly, throwing a fiery, restless stain on the face of the
rock in front of the cave, high up under the darkness and the
stars of the sky&mdash;and a pair of feet would appear stamping,
the shadow of a pair of ankles and feet, fantastic, sustaining no
gigantic body, but enormous, tramping slowly, resembling two
coffins leaping to a slow measure. I see them in my dreams now,
sometimes. They disappeared.</p>
<p>Manuel would sing; far in the night the monotonous staccato of
the guitar went on, accompanying plaintive murmurs, outbursts of
anger and cries of pain, the tremulous moans of sorrow. My nerves
vibrated, I broke my nails on the rock, and seemed to hear once
more the parody of all the transports and of every anguish, even
to death&mdash;a tragic and ignoble rendering of life. He was a
true artist, powerful and scorned, admired with derision, obeyed
with jeers. It was a song of mourning; he sat on the brink with
his feet dangling over the precipice that sent him back his
inspired tones with a confused noise of sobs and desolation...
His idol had been snatched from the humility of his adoring
silence, like a falling star from the sight of the worm that
crawls...He stormed on the strings; and his voice emerged like
the crying of a castaway in the tumult of the gale. He
apostrophized his instrument... Woe! Woe! No more songs. He would
break it. Its work was done. He would dash it against the
rock...His palm slapped the hollow wood furiously...So that it
should lie shattered and mute like his own heart!</p>
<p>A frenzied explosion of yells, jests, and applause covered the
finale.</p>
<p>A complete silence would follow, as if in the acclamations
they had exhausted at once every bestial sound. Somebody would
cough pitifully for a long time&mdash;and when he had done
spluttering and cursing, the world outside appeared lost in an
even more profound stillness. The red stain of the fire wavered
across to play under the dark brow of the rock. The irritated
murmur of the torrent, tearing along below, returned timidly at
first, expanded, filled the ravine, ran through my ears in an
angry babble. The deadened footfalls on the brink sometimes
dislodged a pebble: it would start with a feeble rattle and be
heard no more.</p>
<p>In the daytime, too, there were silences up there, perfect,
profound. No prowl of feet disturbed them; the sun blazed between
the rocks, and even the hum of insects could be heard. It seemed
impossible not to believe that they had all died by a miracle, or
else had been driven away by a silent panic. But two or more were
always on the watch, directly above, with their heads over the
edge; and suddenly they would begin to talk together in drowsy
tones. It was as if some barbarous somnambulists had mumbled in
the daytime the bizarre atrocity of their thoughts.</p>
<p>They discussed Williams' flask, which had been picked up. Was
the cup made of silver, they wondered. Manuel had appropriated it
for his own use, it seems. Well&mdash;he was the <i>capataz</i>.
The <i>Inglez</i>, should he appear by an impossible chance, was
to be shot down at once; but Castro must be allowed to give
himself up. And they would snigger ferociously. Sometimes
quarrels arose, very noisy, a great hubbub of bickerings touching
their jealousies, their fears, their unspeakable hopes of murder
and rapine. They did not feel very safe where they were. Some
would maintain that Castro could not have saved himself, alone.
The <i>Inglez</i> was there, and even the senorita
herself...Manuel scouted the idea with contempt. He advanced the
violence of the storm, the fury of the waves, the broken mast,
the position of the boat. How could they expect a woman!...No. It
was as his song had it. And he defended his point of view
angrily, as though he could not bear being robbed of that source
of poetical inspiration. He emitted profound sighs and superb
declamations.</p>
<p>Castro and I listened to them at the mouth of the cave. Our
tongues were dry and swollen in our mouths, there was the
pressure of an iron clutch on our windpipes, fire in our throats,
and the pangs of hunger that tore at us like iron pincers. But we
could hear that the bandits above were anxious to be gone; they
had but very few charges for their guns, and it was apparent that
they were afraid of a collision with the peons of the
<i>hacienda</i>. Glaring at each other with bloodshot, uncertain
eyes, Castro and I imagined longingly a vision of men in
<i>ponchos</i> spurring madly out of the woods, bent low, and
swinging <i>riatas</i> over the necks of their horses&mdash;with
the thunder of the galloping hoofs in the cave. Seraphina had
withdrawn further into the darkness. And, with a shrinking fear,
I would join her, to eat my heart out by the side of her tense
and mute contemplation.</p>
<p>Sometimes Manuel would begin again, "Castro! Castro! Castro!"
till he seemed to stagger the rocks and disturb the placid
sunshine with an immense wave of sound. He called upon his victim
to drink once more before he died. Long shrieks of derision rent
the air, as if torn out of his breast by far greater torments
than any his fancy delighted to invent. There was something
terrible and weird in the abundance of words screeched
continuously, without end, as if in desperation. No wonder Castro
fled from the passage. And Seraphina and I, within, would be
startled out of our half-delirious state by the sudden appearance
of that old man, disordered, sordid, with a white beard
sprouting, who wandered, weeping aloud in the twilight.</p>
<p>More than once I would stagger off far away into the depths of
the cavern in an access of rage, fling myself on the floor, bite
my arms, beat my head on the rock. I would give myself up. She
must be saved from this tortured death. She had said she would
throw herself over if I left her. But would she have the
strength? It was impossible to know. For days it seemed she had
been lying perfectly still, on her side, one hand under her wan
cheek, and only answering "Juan" when I pronounced her name.
There was something awful in our dry whispers. They were
lifeless, like the tones of the dead, if the dead ever speak to
each other across the earth separating the graves. The moral
suffering, joined to the physical torture of hunger and thirst,
annihilated my will in a measure, but also kindled a vague,
gnawing feeling of hostility against her. She asked too much of
me. It was too much. And I would drag myself back to sit for
hours, and with an aching heart look towards her couch from a
distance.</p>
<p>My eyes, accustomed to obscurity, traced an indistinct and
recumbent form. Her forehead was white; her hair merged into the
darkness which was gathering slowly upon her eyes, her cheeks,
her throat. She was perfectly still. It was cruel, it was odious,
it was intolerable to be so still. This must end. I would carry
her out by main force. She said no word, but there was in the
embrace of those arms instantly thrown around my neck, in the
feel of those dry lips pressed upon mine, in the emaciated face,
in the big shining eyes of that being as light as a feather, a
passionate mournfulness of seduction, a tenacious clinging to the
appointed fate, that suddenly overawed my movement of rage. I
laid her down again, and covered my face with my hands. She
called out to Castro. He reeled, as if drunk, and waited at the
head of her couch, with his chin dropped on his breast.
"<i>Vuestra, Se&ntilde;oria</i>," he muttered.</p>
<p>"Listen well, Castro." Her voice was very faint, and each word
came alone, as if shrunk and parched. "Can my gold&mdash;the
promise of much gold&mdash;you know these men&mdash;save the
lives...?"</p>
<p>He uttered a choked cry, and began to tremble, groping for her
hand.</p>
<p>"<i>Si, Se&ntilde;orita</i>. Excellency, <i>si</i>. It would.
Mercy. Save me. I am too old to bear this. Gold, yes; much gold.
Manuel..."</p>
<p>"Listen, Castro...And Don Juan?" His head fell again. "Speak
the truth, Castro."</p>
<p>He struggled with himself; then, rattling in his throat,
shrieked "No!" with a terrible effort. "No. Nothing can save thy
English lover." "Why?" she breathed feebly. He raged at her in
his weakness. Why? Because the order had gone forth; because they
dared not disobey. Because she had only gold in the palm of her
hand, while Se&ntilde;or O'Brien held all their lives in his. The
accursed <i>Juez</i> was for them like death itself that walks
amongst men, taking this one, leaving another.</p>
<p>He was their life, and their law, and their safety, and their
death&mdash;and the <i>caballero</i> had not killed him...</p>
<p>His voice seemed to wither and dry up gradually in his throat.
He crawled away, and we heard him chuckling horribly somewhere,
like a madman. Seraphina stretched out her hand.</p>
<p>"Then, Juan&mdash;why not together&mdash;like this?"</p>
<p>If she had the courage of this death, I must have even more.
It was a point of honour. I had no wish, and no right, to seek
for some easier way out of life. But she had a woman's capacity
for passive endurance, a serenity of mind in this martyrdom
confessing to something sinister in the power of love that, like
faith, can move mountains and order cruel sacrifices. She could
have walked out in perfect safety&mdash;and it was that thought
that maddened me. And there was no sleep; there were only
intervals in which I could fall into a delirious reverie of still
lakes, of vast sheets of water. I waded into them up to my lips.
Never further. They were smooth and cold as ice; I stood in them
shivering and straining for a draught, burning within with the
fire of thirst, while a phantom all pale, and with its hair
streaming, called to me "Courage!" from the brink in Seraphina's
voice. As to Castro, he was going mad. He was simply going mad,
as people go mad for want of food and drink. And yet he seemed to
keep his strength. He was never still. It was a factitious
strength, the restlessness of incipient insanity. Once, while I
was trying to talk with him about our only hope&mdash;the
peons&mdash;he gave me a look of such sombre distraction that I
left off, intimidated, to wonder vaguely at this glimpse of
something hidden and excessive springing from torments which
surely could be no greater than mine.</p>
<p>He had the strength, and sometimes he could find the voice, to
hurl abuse, curses, and imprecations from the mouth of the cave.
Great shouts of laughter exploded above, and they seemed to hold
their breath to hear more; or Manuel, hanging over, would praise
in mocking, mellifluous accents the energy of his denunciations.
I tried to pull him away from there, but he turned upon me
fiercely; and from prudence&mdash;for all hope was not dead in me
yet&mdash;I left him alone.</p>
<p>That night I heard him make an extraordinary sound chewing; at
the same time he was sobbing and cursing stealthily. He had found
something to eat, then! I could not believe my ears, but I began
to creep towards the sound, and suddenly there was a short, mad
scuffle in the darkness, during which I nearly spitted myself on
his blade. At last, trembling in every limb, with my blood
beating furiously in my ears, I scrambled to my feet, holding a
small piece of meat in my hands. Instantly, without hesitating,
without thinking, I plunged my teeth into it only to fling it far
away from me with a frantic execration. This was the first sound
uttered since we had grappled. Lying prone near me, Castro, with
a rattle in his throat, tried to laugh.</p>
<p>This was a supreme touch of Manuel's art; they were pressed
for time, and he had hit upon that deep and politic invention to
hasten the surrender of his beloved victim. I nearly cried with
the fiery pain on my cracked lips. That piece of half-putrid
flesh was salt&mdash;horribly salt&mdash;salt like salt itself.
Whenever they heard him rave and mutter at the mouth of the cave,
they would throw down these prepared scraps. It was as if I had
put a live coal into my mouth.</p>
<p>"Ha!" he croaked feebly. "Have you thrown it away? I, too; the
first piece. No matter. I can no more swallow anything, now."</p>
<p>His voice was like the rustling of parchment at my feet.</p>
<p>"Do not look for it, Don Juan. The sinners in hell...Ha!
Fiend. I could not resist."</p>
<p>I sank down by his side. He seemed to be writhing on the floor
muttering, "Thirst&mdash;thirst&mdash;thirst." His blade clicked
on the rock; then all was still. Was he dead? Suddenly he began
with an amazingly animated utterance.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or! For this they had to kill cattle."</p>
<p>This thought had kept him up. Probably, they had been firing
shots. But there was a way of hamstringing a stalked cow
silently; and the plains were vast, the grass on them was long;
the carcasses would lie hidden out of sight; the herds were
rounded up only twice every year. His despairing voice died out
in a mournful fall, and again he was as still as death.</p>
<p>"No! I can bear this no longer," he uttered with force. He
refused to bear it. He suffered too much. There was no hope. He
would overwhelm them with maledictions, and then leap down from
the ledge. "<i>Adios, Se&ntilde;or</i>."</p>
<p>I stretched out my arm and caught him by the leg. It seemed to
me I could not part with him. It would have been disloyal, an
admission that all was over, the beginning of the end. We were
exhausting ourselves by this sort of imbecile wrestling.
Meantime, I kept on entreating him to be a man; and at last I
managed to clamber upon his chest. "A man!" he sighed. I released
him. For a space, unheard in the darkness, he seemed to be
collecting all his remaining strength.</p>
<p>"Oh, those strange <i>Inglez!</i> Why should I not leap? and
whom do you love best or hate more, me or the senorita? Be thou a
man, also, and pray God to give thee reason to understand men for
once in thy life. Ha! Enamoured woman&mdash;he is a fool! But I,
Castro..."</p>
<p>His whispering became appallingly unintelligible, then ceased,
passing into a moan. My will to restrain him abandoned me. He had
brought this on us. And if he really wished to give up the
struggle...</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or," he mumbled brokenly, "a thousand thanks.
Br-r-r! Oh, the ugly
water&mdash;water&mdash;water&mdash;water&mdash;salt
water&mdash;salt! You saved me. Why? Let God be the Judge. I
would have preferred a malignant demon for a friend. I forgive
you. <i>Adios!</i> And&mdash;-Her Excellency&mdash;poor
Castro...Ha! Thou old scorpion, encircled by fire&mdash;by fire
and thirst. No. No scorpion, alas! Only a man&mdash;not like
you&mdash;therefore&mdash;a Mass&mdash;or
two&mdash;perhaps..."</p>
<p>The freshness of the night penetrated through the arch, as far
as the faint twilight of the day. I heard his tearful muttering
creep away from my side. "Thirst&mdash;thirst&mdash;thirst." I
did not stir; and an incredulity, a weariness, the sense of our
common fate, mingled with an unconfessed desire&mdash;the desire
of seeing what would come of it&mdash;a desire that stirred my
blood like a glimmer of hope, and prevented me from making a
movement or uttering a whisper. If his sufferings were so great,
who was I to...Mine, too. I almost envied him. He was free.</p>
<p>As if an inward obscurity had parted in two I looked to the
very bottom of my thoughts. And his action appeared like a
sacrifice. It could liberate us two from this cave before it was
too late. He, he alone, was the prey they had trapped. They would
be satisfied, probably. Nay! There could be no doubt. Directly he
was dead they would depart. Ah! he wanted to leap. He must not be
allowed. Now that I understood perfectly what this meant, I had
to prevent him. There was no choice. I must stop him at any
cost.</p>
<p>The awakening of my conscience sent me to my feet; but before
I had stumbled halfway through the passage I heard his shout in
the open air, "Behold me!"</p>
<p>A man outside cried excitedly, "He is out!"</p>
<p>An exulting tumult fell into the arch, the clash of twenty
voices yelling in different keys, "He is out&mdash;the traitor!
He is out!" I was too late, but I made three more hesitating
steps and stood blinded. The flaming branches they were holding
over the precipice showered a multitude of sparks, that fell
disappearing continuously in the lurid light, shutting out the
night from the mouth of the cave. And in this light Castro could
be seen kneeling on the other side of the sill.</p>
<p>With his fingers clutching the edge of the slab, he hung
outwards, his head falling back, his spine arched tensely, like a
bow; and the red sparks coming from above with the dancing whirl
of snowflakes, vanished in the air before they could settle on
his face.</p>
<p>"Manuel! Manuel!"</p>
<p>They answered with a deep, confused growl, jostling and
crowding on the edge to look down into his eyes. Meantime I
stared at the convulsive heaving of his breast, at his upturned
chin, his swelling throat. He defied Manuel. He would leap.
Behold! he was going to leap&mdash;to his own death&mdash;in his
own time. He challenged them to come down on the ledge; and the
blade of the maimed arm waved to and fro stiffly, point up, like
a red-hot weapon in the light. He devoted them to pestilence, to
English gallows, to the infernal powers: while all the time
commenting murmurs passed over his head, as though he had
extorted their sinister appreciation.</p>
<p>"<i>Canalla!</i> dogs, thieves, prey of death, vermin of
hell&mdash;I spit on you&mdash;like this!"</p>
<p>He had not the force, nor the saliva, and remained straining
mutely upwards while they laughed at him all together, with
something sombre, and as if doomed in their derision..."He will
jump! No, he will not!" "Yes! Leap, Castro! Spit, Castro!" "He
will run back into the cave! <i>Maladetta!</i>"...Manuel's voiced
cooed lovingly on the brink:</p>
<p>"Come to us and drink, Castro."</p>
<p>I waited for his leap with doubt, with disbelief, in the
helpless agitation of the weak. Gradually he seemed to relax all
over.</p>
<p>"Drink deep; drink, and drink, and drink, Castro. Water. Clear
water, cool water. Taste, Castro!"</p>
<p>He called on him in tones that were almost tender in their
urgency, to come and drink before he died. His voice seemed to
cast a spell, like an incantation, upon the tubby little figure,
with something yearning in the upward turn of the listening
face.</p>
<p>"Drink!" Manuel repeated the word several times; then,
suddenly he called, "Taste, Castro, taste," and a descending
brightness, as of a crystal rod hurled from above, shivered to
nothing on the upturned face. The light disappearing from before
the cave seemed scared away by the inhuman discord of his shriek;
and I flung myself forward to lick the splash of moisture on the
sill. I did not think of Castro, I had forgotten him. I raged at
the deception of my thirst, exploring with my tongue the rough
surface of the stone till I tasted my own blood. Only then,
raising my head to gasp, and clench my fists with a baffled and
exasperated desire, I noticed how profound was the silence, in
which the words, "Take away his sting," seemed to pronounce
themselves over the ravine in the impersonal austerity of the
rock, and with the tone of a tremendous decree. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER TEN</h2>
<p>He had surrendered to his thirst. What weakness! He had not
thrown himself over, then. What folly! One splash of water on his
face had been enough. He was contemptible; and lying collapsed,
in a sort of tormented apathy, at the mouth of the cave, I
despised and envied his good fortune. It could not save him from
death, but at least he drank. I understood this when I heard his
voice, a voice altogether altered&mdash;a firm, greedy voice
saying, "More," breathlessly. And then he drank again. He was
drinking. He was drinking up there in the light of the fire, in a
circle of mortal enemies, under Manuel's gloating eyes. Drinking!
O happiness! O delight! What a miserable wretch! I clawed the
stone convulsively; I think I would have rushed out for my share
if I had not heard Manuel's cruel and caressing voice:</p>
<p>"How now? You do not want to throw yourself over, my
Castro?"</p>
<p>"I have drunk," he said gloomily.</p>
<p>I think they must have given him something to eat then. In my
mind there are many blanks in the vision of that scene, a vision
built upon a few words reaching me, suddenly, with great
intervals of silence between, as though I had been coming to
myself out of a dead faint now and then. A ferocious hum of many
voices would rise sometimes impatiently, the scrambling of feet
near the edge; or, in a sinister and expectant stillness, Manuel
the artist would be speaking to his "beloved victim Castro" in a
gentle and insinuating voice that seemed to tremble slightly with
eagerness. Had he eaten and drunk enough? They had kept their
promises, he said. They would keep them all. The water had been
cool&mdash;and presently he, Manuel-del-Popolo, would accompany
with his guitar and his voice the last moments of his victim.
Bursts of laughter punctuated his banter. Ah! that Manuel, that
Manuel! Some actually swore in admiration. But was Castro really
at his ease? Was it not good to eat and drink? Had he quite
returned to life? But, <i>Caramba, amigos</i>, what neglect! The
<i>caballero</i> who has honoured us must smoke. They shouted in
high glee: "Yes. Smoke, Castro. Let him smoke." I suppose he did;
and Manuel expounded to him how pleasant life was in which one
could eat, and drink, and smoke. His words tortured me. Castro
remained mute&mdash;from disdain, from despair, perhaps.
Afterwards they carried him along clear of the cornice, and I
understood they formed a half-circle round him, drawing their
knives. Manuel, screeching in a high falsetto, ordered the bonds
of his feet to be cut. I advanced my head out as far as I dared;
their voices reached me deadened; I could only see the profound
shadow of the ravine, a patch of dark clear sky opulent with
stars, and the play of the firelight on the opposite side. The
shadow of a pair of monumental feet, and the lower edge of a
cloak, spread amply like a skirt, stood out in it, intensely
black and motionless, right in front of the cave. Now and then,
elbowed in the surge round Castro, the guitar emitted a deep and
hollow resonance. He was tumultuously ordered to stand up and, I
imagine, he was being pricked with the points of their knives
till he did get on his feet. "Jump!" they roared all
together&mdash;and Manuel began to finger the strings, lifting up
his voice between the gusts of savage hilarity, mingled with
cries of death. He exhorted his followers to close on the traitor
inch by inch, presenting their knives.</p>
<p>"He runs here and there, the blood trickling from his
limbs&mdash;but in vain, this is the appointed time for the
leap..."</p>
<p>It was an improvisation; they stamped their feet to the slow
measure; they shouted in chorus the one word "Leap!" raising a
ferocious roar; and between whiles the song of voice and strings
came to me from a distance, softened and lingering in a
voluptuous and pitiless cadence that wrung my heart, and seemed
to eat up the remnants of my strength. But what could I have
done, even if I had had the strength of a giant, and a most
fearless resolution? I should have been shot dead before I had
crawled halfway up the ledge. A piercing shriek covered the
guitar, the song, and the wild merriment.</p>
<p>Then everything seemed to stop&mdash;even my own painful
breathing. Again Castro shrieked like a madman:</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;orita&mdash;your gold. Se&ntilde;orita! Hear me!
Help!"</p>
<p>Then all was still.</p>
<p>"Hear the dead calling to the dead," sneered Manuel.</p>
<p>An awestruck sort of hum proceeded from the Spaniards. Was the
senorita alive? In the cave? Or where?</p>
<p>"Her nod would have saved thee, Castro," said Manuel slowly. I
got up. I heard Castro stammer wildly:</p>
<p>"She shall fill both your hands with gold. Do you hear,
hombres? I, Castro, tell you&mdash;each man&mdash;both
hands&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He had done it. The last hope was gone now. And all that there
remained for me to do was to leap over or give myself up, and end
this horrible business.</p>
<p>"She was a creature born to command the moon and the stars,"
Manuel mused aloud in a vibrating tone, and suddenly smote the
strings with emphatic violence. She could even stay his
vengeance. But was it possible! No, no. It could not be&mdash;and
yet...</p>
<p>"Thou art alive yet, Castro," he cried. "Thou hast eaten and
drunk; life is good&mdash;is it not, old man?&mdash;and the leap
is high."</p>
<p>He thundered "Silence!" to still the excited murmurs of his
band. If she lived Castro should live, too&mdash;he, Manuel, said
so; but he threatened him with horrible tortures, with two days
of slow dying, if he dared to deceive. Let him, then, speak the
truth quickly.</p>
<p>"Speak, 'viejo'. Where is she?"</p>
<p>And at the opening, fifty yards away, I was tempted to call
out, as though I had loved Castro well enough to save him from
the shame and remorse of a plain betrayal. That the moment of it
had come I could have no doubt. And it was I myself, perhaps, who
could not face the certitude of his downfall. If my throat had
not been so compressed, so dry with thirst and choked with
emotion, I believe I should have cried out and brought them away
from that miserable man with a rush. Since we were lost, he at
least should be saved from this. I suffered from his spasmodic,
agonized laugh away there, with twenty knives aimed at his breast
and the eighty-foot drop of the precipice at his back. Why did he
hesitate?</p>
<p>I was to learn, then, that the ultimate value of life to all
of us is based on the means of self-deception. Morally he had his
back against the wall, he could not hope to deceive himself; and
after Manuel had cried again at him, "Where are they?" in a
really terrible tone, I heard his answer:</p>
<p>"At the bottom of the sea."</p>
<p>He had his own courage after all&mdash;if only the courage not
to believe in Manuel's promises. And he must have been weary of
his life&mdash;weary enough not to pay that price. And yet he had
gone to the very verge, calling upon Seraphina as if she could
hear him. Madness of fear, no doubt&mdash;succeeded by an
awakening, a heroic reaction. And yet sometimes it seems to me as
if the whole scene, with his wild cries for help, had been the
outcome of a supreme exercise of cunning. For, indeed, he could
not have invented anything better to bring the conviction of our
death to the most sceptical of those ruffians. All I heard after
his words had been a great shout, followed by a sudden and
unbroken silence. It seemed to last a very long time. He had
thrown himself over! It is like the blank space of a swoon to me,
and yet it must have been real enough, because, huddled up just
inside the sill, with my head reposing wearily on the stone, I
watched three moving flames of lighted branches carried by men
follow each other closely in a swaying descent along the path on
the other side of the ravine. They passed on downwards,
flickering out of view. Then, after a time, a voice below, to the
left of the cave, ascended with a hooting and mournful effect
from the depths.</p>
<p>"Manuel! Manuel! We have found him!...<i>Es muerte!</i>"</p>
<p>And from above Manuel's shout rolled, augmented, between the
rocks.</p>
<p>"<i>Bueno!</i> Turn his face up&mdash;for the birds!"</p>
<p>They continued calling to each other for a good while. The men
below declared their intention of going on to the sea shore; and
Manuel shouted to them not to forget to send him up a good rope
early in the morning. Apparently, the schooner had been refloated
some time before; many of the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> were to
sleep on board. They purposed to set sail early next day.</p>
<p>This revived me, and I spent the night between Seraphina's
couch and the mouth of the cave, keeping tight hold of my reason
that seemed to lose itself in this hope, in this darkness, in
this torment. I touched her cheek, it was hot&mdash;while her
forehead felt to my fingers as cold as ice. I had no more voice,
but I tried to force out some harsh whispers through my throat.
They sounded horrible to my own ears, and she endeavoured to
soothe me by murmuring my name feebly. I believe she thought me
delirious. I tried to pray for my strength to last till I could
carry her out of that cave to the side of the brook&mdash;then
let death come. "Live, live," I whispered into her ear, and would
hear a sigh so faint, so feeble, that it swayed all my soul with
pity and fear, "Yes, Juan."...And I would go away to watch for
the dawn from the mouth of the cave, and curse the stars that
would not fade.</p>
<p>Manuel's voice always steadied me. A languor had come over
them above, as if their passion had been exhausted; as if their
hearts had been saddened by an unbridled debauch. There was,
however, their everlasting quarrelling. Several of them, I
understood, left the camp for the schooner, but avoiding the road
by the ravine as if Castro's dead body down there had made it
impassable. And the talk went on late into the night. There was
some superstitious fear attached to the cave&mdash;a legend of
men who had gone in and had never come back any more. All they
knew of it was the region of twilight; formerly, when they used
the shelter of the cavern, no one, it seems, ever ventured
outside the circle of the fire. Manuel disdained their fears. Had
he not been such a profound politico, a man of stratagems, there
would have been a necessity to go down and see...They all
protested.</p>
<p>Who was going down? Not they...Their craven cowardice was
amazing.</p>
<p>He begged them to keep themselves quiet. They had him for
<i>Capataz</i> now. A man of intelligence. Had he not enticed
Castro out? He had never believed there was any one else in
there. He sighed. Otherwise Castro would have tried to save his
life by confessing. There had been nothing to confess. But he had
the means of making sure. A voice suggested that the
<i>Inglez</i> might have withdrawn himself into the depths. These
English were not afraid of demons, being devils themselves; and
this one was fiendishly reckless. But Manuel observed,
contemptuously, that a man trapped like this would remain near
the opening. Hope would keep him there till he died&mdash;unless
he rushed out like Castro-Manuel laughed, but in a mournful tone:
and, listening to the craven talk of their doubts and fears, it
seemed to me that if I could appear at one bound amongst them,
they would scatter like chaff before my glance It seemed
intolerable to wait; more than human strength could bear. Would
the day never come? A drowsiness stole upon their voices.</p>
<p>Manuel kept watch. He fed the fire, and his incomplete shadow,
projected across the chasm, would pass and return, obscuring the
glow that fell on the rock. His footsteps seemed to measure the
interminable duration of the night. Sometimes he would stop short
and talk to himself in low, exalted mutters. A big bright star
rested on the brow of the rock opposite, shining straight into my
eyes. It sank, as if it had plunged into the stone. At last.
Another came to look into the cavern. I watched the gradual
coming of a gray sheen from the side of Seraphina's couch. This
was the day, the last day of pain, or else of life. Its ghostly
edge invaded slowly the darkness of the cave towards its
appointed limit, creeping slowly, as colourless as spilt water on
the floor. I pressed my lips silently upon her cheek. Her eyes
were open. It seemed to me she had a smile fainter than her
sighs. She was very brave, but her smile did not go beyond her
lips. Not a feature of her face moved. I could have opened my
veins for her without hesitation, if it had not been a forbidden
sacrifice.</p>
<p>Would they go? I asked myself. Through Castro's heroism or
through his weakness, perhaps through both the heroism and the
weakness of that man, they must be satisfied. They must be. I
could not doubt it; I could not believe it. Everything seemed
improbable; everything seemed possible. If they descended I
would, I thought, have the strength to carry her off, away into
the darkness. If there was any truth in what I had overheard them
saying, that the depths of the cavern concealed an abyss, we
would cast ourselves into it.</p>
<p>The feeble, consenting pressure of her hand horrified me. They
would not come down. They were afraid of that place, I whispered
to her&mdash;and I thought to myself that such cowardice was
incredible. Our fate was sealed. And yet from what I had
heard...</p>
<p>We watched the daylight growing in the opening; at any moment
it might have been obscured by their figures. The tormenting
incertitudes of that hour were cruel enough to overcome, almost,
the sensations of thirst, of hunger, to engender a restlessness
that had the effect of renewed vigour. They were like a
nightmare; but that nightmare seemed to clear my mind of its
feverish hallucinations. I was more collected, then, than I had
been for the last forty-eight hours of our imprisonment. But I
could not remain there, waiting. It was absolutely necessary that
I should watch at the entrance for the moment of their
departure.</p>
<p>The morning was serenely cool and, in its stillness, their
talk filled with clear-cut words the calm air of the ravine. A
party&mdash;I could not tell how many&mdash;had already come up
from the schooner in a great state of excitement. They feared
that their presence had, in some way, become known to the peons
of the <i>hacienda</i>. There was much abuse of a man called
Carneiro, who, the day before, had fired an incautious shot at a
fat cow on one of the inland <i>savannas</i>. They cursed him.
Last night, before the moon rose, those on board the schooner had
heard the whinnying of a horse. Somebody had ridden down to the
water's edge in the darkness and, after waiting a while, had
galloped back the way he came. The prints of hoofs on the beach
showed that.</p>
<p>They feared these horsemen greatly. A vengeance was owing for
the man Manuel had killed; and I could guess they talked with
their faces over their shoulders. "And what about finding out
whether the <i>Inglez</i> was there, dead or alive?" asked
some.</p>
<p>I was sure, now, that they would not come down in a body. It
would expose them to the danger of being caught in the cavern by
the peons. There was no time for a thorough search, they
argued.</p>
<p>For the first time that morning I heard Manuel's voice, "Stand
aside."</p>
<p>He came down to the very brink.</p>
<p>"If the <i>Inglez</i> is down there, and if he is alive, he is
listening to us now."</p>
<p>He was as certain as though he had been able to see me. He
added:</p>
<p>"But there's no one."</p>
<p>"Go and look, Manuel," they cried.</p>
<p>He said something in a tone of contempt. The Voices above my
head sank into busy murmurs.</p>
<p>"Give me the rope here," he said aloud.</p>
<p>I had a feeling of some inconceivable danger nearing me; and
in my state of weakness I began to tremble, backing away from the
orifice. I had no strength in my limbs. I had no weapons. How
could I fight? I would use my teeth. With a light knocking
against the rock above the arch, Williams' flask, tied by its
green cord to the end of a thick rope, descended slowly, and hung
motionless before the entrance.</p>
<p>It had been freshly filled with water; it was dripping wet
outside, and the silver top, struck by the sunbeams, dazzled my
eyes.</p>
<p>This was the danger&mdash;this bait. And it seems to me that
if I had had the slightest inkling of what was coming, I should
have rushed at it instantly. But it took me some time to
understand&mdash;to take in the idea that this was water, there,
within reach of my hand. With a great effort I resisted the
madness that incited me to hurl myself upon the flask. I hung
back with all my power. A convulsive spasm contracted my throat.
I turned about and fled out of the passage.</p>
<p>I ran to Seraphina. "Put out your hand to me," I panted in the
darkness. "I need your help."</p>
<p>I felt it resting lightly on my bowed head. She did not even
ask me what I meant; as if the greatness of her soul was
omniscient. There was, in that silence, a supreme unselfishness,
the unquestioning devotion of a woman.</p>
<p>"Patience, patience," I kept on muttering. I was losing
confidence in myself. If only I had been free to dash my head
against the rock. I had the courage for that, yet. But this was a
situation from which there was no issue in death.</p>
<p>"We are saved," I murmured distractedly.</p>
<p>"Patience," she breathed out. Her hand slipped languidly off
my head.</p>
<p>And I began to creep away from her side. I am here to tell the
truth. I began to creep away towards the flask. I did not confess
this to myself; but I know now. There was a devilish power in it.
I have learned the nature of feelings in a man whom Satan
beguiles into selling his soul&mdash;the horror of an
irresistible and fatal longing for a supreme felicity. And in a
drink of water for me, then, there was a greater promise than in
universal knowledge, in unbounded power, in unlimited wealth, in
imperishable youth. What could have been these seductions to a
drink? No soul had thirsted after things unlawful as my parched
throat thirsted for water. No devil had ever tempted a man with
such a bribe of perdition.</p>
<p>I suffered from the lucidity of my feelings. I saw, with
indignation, my own wretched self being angled for like a fish.
And with all that, in my forlorn state, I remained prudent. I did
not rush out blindly. No. I approached the inner end of the
passage, as though I had been stalking a wild creature, slowly,
from the side. I crept along the wall of the cavern, and
protruded my head far enough to look at the fiendish
temptation.</p>
<p>There it was, a small dark object suspended in the light, with
the yellow rock across the ravine for a background. The silver
top shivered the sunbeams brilliantly. I had half hopes they had
taken it away by this time. When I drew my head back I lost sight
of it, but all my being went out to it with an almost pitiful
longing. I remembered Castro for the first time in many hours.
Was I nothing better than Castro? He had been angled for with
salted meat. I shuddered. A darkness fell into the passage. I put
down my uplifted foot without advancing. The unexpectedness of
that shadow saved me, I believe. Manuel had descended the
cornice.</p>
<p>He was alone. Standing before the outer opening, he darkened
the passage, through which his talk to the people above came
loudly into my ears. They could see now if he were not a worthy
<i>Capataz</i>. If the <i>Inglez</i> was in there he was a
corpse. And yet, of these living hearts above, of these
<i>valientes</i> of Rio Medio, there was not one who would go
alone to look upon a dead body. He had contrived an infallible
test, and yet they would not believe him. Well, his valiance
should prove it; his valiance, afraid neither of light nor of
darkness.</p>
<p>I could not hear the answers he got from up there; but the
vague sounds that reached me carried the usual commingling of
derision and applause, the resentment of their jeers at the
admiration he knew how to extort by the display of his
talents.</p>
<p>They must kill the cattle, these <i>caballeros</i>. He scolded
ironically. Of course. They must feed on meat like lions; but
their souls were like the souls of hens born on dunghills. And
behold! there was he, Manuel, not afraid of shadows.</p>
<p>He was coming in, there could be no doubt. Out there in the
full light, he could not possibly have detected that rapid
appearance of my head darted forward and withdrawn at once; but I
had a view of his arm putting aside the swinging flask, of his
leg raised to step over the high sill. I saw him, and I ran
noiselessly away from the opening.</p>
<p>I had the time to charge Seraphina not to move, on our
lives&mdash;on the wretched remnant of our lives&mdash;when his
black shape stood in the frame of the opening, edged with a
thread of light following the contour of his hat, of his
shoulders, of his whole body down to his feet&mdash;whence a long
shadow fell upon the pool of twilight on the floor.</p>
<p>What had made him come down? Vanity? The exacting demands of
his leadership? Fear of O'Brien? The <i>Juez</i> would expect to
hear something definite, and his band pretended not to believe in
the stratagem of the bottle. I think that, for his part, from his
knowledge of human nature, he never doubted its efficacy. He
could not guess how very little, only, he was wrong. How very
little! And yet he seemed rooted in incertitude on the threshold.
His head turned from side to side. I could not make out his face
as he stood, but the slightest of his movements did not escape
me. He stepped aside, letting in all the fullness of the
light.</p>
<p>Would he have the courage to explore at least the immediate
neighbourhood of the opening? Who could tell his complex motives?
Who could tell his purpose or his fears? He had killed a man in
there once. But, then, he had not been alone. If he were only
showing off before his unruly band, he need not stir a step
further. He did not advance. He leaned his shoulders against the
rock just clear of the opening. One half of him was lighted
plainly; his long profile, part of his raven locks, one listless
hand, his crossed legs, the buckle of one shoe.</p>
<p>"Nobody," he pronounced slowly, in a dead whisper.</p>
<p>While I looked at him, the profound <i>politico</i>, the
artist, the everlastingly questioned <i>Capataz</i>, the man of
talent and ability, he thought himself alone, and allowed his
head to drop on his breast, as if saddened by the vanity of human
ambition. Then, lifting it with a jerk, he listened with one ear
turned to the passage; afterwards he peered into the cavern. Two
long strides, over the cold heap of ashes, brought him to the
stone seat.</p>
<p>It was very plain to me from his starting movements and
attitudes, that he shared his uneasy attention between the inside
and the outside of the cave. He sat down, but seemed ready to
jump up; and I saw him turn his eyes upwards to the dark vault,
as if on the alert for a noise from above. I am inclined to think
he was expecting to hear the galloping hoofs of the peons' horses
every moment. I think he did. The words "I am safer here than
they above," were perfectly audible to me in the mumbling he kept
up nervously. He wished to hear the sound of his own voice, as a
timid person whistles and talks on a lonely road at night. Only
the year before he had killed a man in that cavern, under
circumstances that were, I believe, revolting even to the honour
of these bandits. He sat there between the shadow of his murder
and the reality of the vengeance. I asked myself what could be
the outcome of a struggle with him. He was armed; he was not
weakened by hunger; but he stood between us and the water. My
thirst would give me strength; the desire to end Seraphina's
sufferings would make me invincible. On the other hand, it was
dangerous to interfere. I could not tell whether they would not
try to find out what became of him. It was safest to let him go.
It was extremely improbable that they would sail without him.</p>
<p>I am not conscious of having stirred a limb; neither had
Seraphina moved, I am ready to swear; but plainly something, some
sort of sound, startled him. He bounded out of his seated
immobility, and in one leap had his shoulders against the rock
standing at bay before the darkness, with his knife in his hand.
I wonder he did not surprise me into an exclamation. I was as
startled as himself. His teeth and the whites of his eyes gleamed
straight at me from afar; he hissed with fear; for an instant I
was firmly convinced he had seen me. All this took place so
quickly that I had no time to make one movement towards receiving
his attack, when I saw him make a great sign of the cross in the
air with the point of his dagger.</p>
<p>He sheathed it slowly, and sidled along the few feet to the
entrance, his shoulders rubbing the wall. He blocked out the
light, and in a moment had backed out of sight.</p>
<p>Before he got to the further end I was already, at the inner,
creeping after him. I had started at once, as if his
disappearance had removed a spell, as though he had drawn me
after him by an invisible bond. Raising myself on my forearms I
saw him, from his knees up, standing outside the sill, with his
back to the precipice and his face turned up.</p>
<p>"There is nobody in there," he shouted.</p>
<p>I sank down and wriggled forward on my stomach, raising myself
on my elbows, now and then, to look. Manuel was looking upwards
conversing with the people above, and holding Williams' flask in
both his hands. He never once glanced into the passage; he seemed
to be trying to undo the cord knotted to the end of the thick
rope, which hung in a long bight before him. The flask captured
my eyes, my thought, my energy. I would tear it away from him
directly. There was in me, then, neither fear nor intelligence;
only the desire of possessing myself of the thing; but an
instinctive caution prevented my rushing out violently. I
proceeded with an animal-like stealthiness, with which cool
reason had nothing to do.</p>
<p>He had some difficulty with the knot, and evidently did not
wish to cut the green silk cord. How well I remember his fumbling
fingers. He sat down sideways on the sill, with his legs outside,
of course, his face and hands turned to the light, very absorbed
in his endeavour. They shouted to him from above.</p>
<p>"I come at once," he cried to them, without lifting his
head.</p>
<p>I had crept up almost near enough to grab the flask. It never
occurred to me that by flinging myself on him, I could have
pushed him off the sill. My only idea was to get hold. He did not
exist for me. The leather-covered bottle was the only real thing
in the world. I was completely insane. I heard a faint
detonation, and Manuel got up quickly from the sill. The flask
was out of my reach.</p>
<p>There were more popping sounds of shots fired, away on the
plain. The peons were attacking an outpost of the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>. A deep voice cried, "They are driving
them in." Then several together yelled:</p>
<p>"Come away, Manuel. Come away. <i>Por Dios...</i>"</p>
<p>Stretched at full length in the passage, and sustaining myself
on my trembling arms, I gazed up at him. He stood very rigid,
holding the flask in both hands. Several muskets were discharged
together just above, and in the noise of the reports I remember a
voice crying urgently over the edge, "Manuel! Manuel!" The shadow
of irresolution passed over his features. He hesitated whether to
run up the ledge or bolt into the cave. He shouted something. He
was not answered, but the yelling and the firing ceased suddenly,
as if the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> had given up and taken to their
heels. I became aware of a sort of increasing throbbing sound
that seemed to come from behind me, out of the cave; then, as
Manuel lifted his foot hastily to step over the sill, I jumped up
deliriously, and with outstretched hands lurched forward at the
flask in his fingers.</p>
<p>I believe I laughed at him in an imbecile manner.</p>
<p>Somebody laughed; and I remember the superior smile on his
face passing into a ghastly grin, that disappeared slowly, while
his astonished eyes, glaring at that gaunt and dishevelled
apparition rising before him in the dusk of the passage, seemed
to grow to an enormous size. He drew back his foot, as though it
had been burnt; and in a panic-stricken impulse, he flung the
flask straight into my face, and staggered away from the
sill.</p>
<p>I made a catch at it with a scream of triumph, whose unearthly
sound brought me back to my senses.</p>
<p>"In the name of God, retire," he cried, as though I had been
an apparition from another world.</p>
<p>What took place afterwards happened with an inconceivable
rapidity, in less time than it takes to draw breath. He never
recognized me. I saw his glare of incredulous awe change,
suddenly, to horror and despair. He had felt himself losing his
balance.</p>
<p>He had stepped too far back. He tried to recover himself, but
it was too late. He hung for a moment in his backward fall; his
arms beat the air, his body curled upon itself with an awful
striving. All at once he went limp all over, and, with the
sunlight full upon his upturned face, vanished downwards from my
sight.</p>
<p>But at the last moment he managed to clutch the bight of the
hanging rope. The end of it must have been lying quite loose on
the ground above, for I saw its whole length go whizzing after
him, in the twinkling of an eye. I pressed the flask fiercely to
my breast, raging with the thought that he could yet tear it out
of my hands; but by the time the strain came, his falling body
had acquired such a velocity that I didn't feel the slightest
jerk when the green cord snapped&mdash;no more than if it had
been the thread of a cobweb.</p>
<p>I confess that tears, tears of gratitude, were running down my
face. My limbs trembled. But I was sane enough not to think of
myself any more.</p>
<p>"Drink! Drink," I stammered, raising Seraphina's head on my
shoulder, while the galloping horses of the peons in hot pursuit
passed with a thundering rumble above us. Then all was still.</p>
<p>Our getting out of the cave was a matter of unremitting toil,
through what might have been a year of time; the recollection is
of an arduous undertaking, accomplished without the usual
incentives of men's activity. Necessity, alone, remained; the
iron necessity without the glamour of freedom of choice, of
pride.</p>
<p>Our unsteady feet crushed, at last, the black embers of the
fires scattered by the hoofs of horses; and the plain appeared
immense to our weakness, swept of shadows by the high sun, lonely
and desolate as the sea. We looked at the litter of the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os'</i> camp, rags on the trodden grass, a
couple of abandoned blankets, a musket thrown away in the panic,
a dirty red sash lying on a heap of sticks, a wooden bucket from
the schooner, smashed water-gourds. One of them remained
miraculously poised on its round bottom and full to the brim,
while everything else seemed to have been overturned, torn,
scattered haphazard by a furious gust of wind. A scaffolding of
poles, for drying strips of meat, had been knocked over; I found
nothing there except bits of hairy hide; but lumps of scorched
flesh adhered to the white bones scattered amongst the ashes of
the camp&mdash;and I thanked God for them.</p>
<p>We averted our eyes from our faces in very love, and we did
not speak from pity for each other. There was no joy in our
escape, no relief, no sense of freedom. The
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> and the peons, the pursued and the
pursuers, had disappeared from the upland without leaving as much
as a corpse in view. There were no moving things on the earth, no
bird soared in the pellucid air, not even a moving cloud on the
sky. The sun declined, and the rolling expanse of the plain
frightened us, as if space had been something alive and
hostile.</p>
<p>We walked away from that spot, as if our feet had been shod in
lead; and we hugged the edge of the cruel ravine, as one keeps by
the side of a friend. We must have been grotesque, pathetic, and
lonely; like two people newly arisen from a tomb, shrinking
before the strangeness of the half-forgotten face of the world.
And at the head of the ravine we stopped.</p>
<p>The sensation of light, vastness, and solitude, rolled upon
our souls emerging from the darkness, overwhelmingly, like a wave
of the sea. We might have been an only couple sent back from the
underworld to begin another cycle of pain on a depopulated earth.
It had not for us even the fitful caress of a breeze; and the
only sound of greeting was the angry babble of the brook dashing
down the stony slope at our feet.</p>
<p>We knelt over it to drink deeply and bathe our faces. Then
looking about helplessly, I discovered afar the belt of the sea
inclosed between the undulating lines of the dunes and the
straight edge of the horizon. I pointed my arm at the white sails
of the schooner creeping from under the land, and Seraphina,
resting her head on my shoulder, shuddered.</p>
<p>"Let us go away from here."</p>
<p>Our necessity pointed down the slope. We could not think of
another way, and the extent of the plain with its boundary of
forests filled us with the dread of things unknown. But, by
getting down to the inlet of the sea, and following the bank of
the little river, we were sure to reach the <i>hacienda</i>, if
only a hope could buoy our sinking hearts long enough.</p>
<p>From our first step downwards the hard, rattling noise of the
stones accompanied our descent, growing in volume, bewildering
our minds. We had missed the indistinct beginning of the trail on
the side of the ravine, and had to follow the course of the
stream. A growth of wiry bushes sprang thickly between the large
fragments of fallen rocks. On our right the shadows were
beginning to steal into the chasm. Towering on our left the great
stratified wall caught at the top of the glow of the low sun in a
rich, tawny tint, right under the dark blue strip of sky, that
seemed to reflect the gloom of the ravine, the sepulchral arid
gloom of deep shadows and gray rocks, through which the shallow
torrent dashed violently with glassy gleams between the sombre
masses of vegetation.</p>
<p>We pushed on through the bunches of tough twigs; the massive
boulders closed the view on every side; and Seraphina followed me
with her hands on my shoulders. This was the best way in which I
could help her descent till the declivity became less steep; and
then I went ahead, forcing a path for her. Often we had to walk
into the bed of the stream. It was icy cold. Some strange beast,
perhaps a bird, invisible somewhere, emitted from time to time a
faint and lamentable shriek. It was a wild scene, and the orifice
of the cave appeared as an inaccessible black hole some ninety
feet above our heads.</p>
<p>Then, as I stepped round a large fragment of rock, my eyes
fell on Manuel's body.</p>
<p>Seraphina was behind me. With a wave of my hand I arrested
her. It had not occurred to me before that, following the bottom
of the ravine, we must come upon the two bodies. Castro's was
lower down, of course. I would have spared her the sight, but
there was no retracing our steps. We had no strength and no time.
Manuel was lying on his back with his hands under him, and his
feet nearly in the brook.</p>
<p>The lower portion of the rope made a heap of cordage on the
ground near him, but a great length of it hung perpendicularly
above his head. The loose end he had snatched over the edge of
his fall had whipped itself tight round the stem of a dwarf tree
growing in a crevice high up the rock; and as he fell below, the
jerk must have checked his descent, and had prevented him from
alighting on his head. There was not a sign of blood anywhere
upon him or on the stones. His eyes were shut. He might have lain
down to sleep there, in our way; only from the slightly unnatural
twist in the position of his arms and legs, I saw, at a glance,
that all his limbs were broken.</p>
<p>On the other side of the boulder Seraphina called to me, and I
could not answer her, so great was the shock I received in seeing
the flutter of his slowly opening eyelids.</p>
<p>He still lived, then! He looked at me! It was an awful
discovery to make, and the contrast of his anxious and feverish
stare with the collapsed posture of his body was full of
intolerable suggestions of fate blundering unlawfully, of death
itself being conquered by pain. I looked away only to perceive
something pitiless, belittling, and cruel in the precipitous
immobility of the sheer walls, in the dark funereal green of the
foliage, in the falling shadows, in the remoteness of the
sky.</p>
<p>The unconsciousness of matter hinted at a weird and mysterious
antagonism. All the inanimate things seemed to have conspired to
throw in our way this man just enough alive to feel pain. The
faint and lamentable sounds we had heard must have come from him.
He was looking at me. It was impossible to say whether he saw
anything at all. He barred our road with his remnant of life;
but, when suddenly he spoke, my heart stood still for a moment in
my motionless body.</p>
<p>"You, too!" he droned awfully. "Behold! I have been
precipitated, alive, into this hell by another ghost. Nothing
else could have overcome the greatness of my spirit."</p>
<p>His red shirt was torn open at the throat. His bared breast
began to heave. He cried out with pain. Ready to fly from him
myself, I shouted to Seraphina to keep away.</p>
<p>But it was too late. Imagining I had seen some new danger in
our path, she had advanced to stand by my side.</p>
<p>"He is dying," I muttered in distraction. "We can do
nothing."</p>
<p>But could we pass him by before he died? "This is terrible,"
said Seraphina.</p>
<p>My real hope had been that, after driving the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> away, the peons would off-saddle near the
little river to rest themselves and their horses. This is why I
had almost pitilessly hurried Seraphina, after we had left the
cave, down the steep but short descent of the ravine. I had kept
to myself my despairing conviction that we could never reach the
<i>hacienda</i> unaided, even if we had known the way. I had
pretended confidence in ourselves, but all my trust was in the
assistance I expected to get from these men. I understood so well
the slenderness of that hope that I had not dared to mention it
to her and to propose she should wait for me on the upland, while
I went down by myself on that quest. I could not bear the fear of
returning unsuccessful only to find her dead. That is, if I had
the strength to return after such a disappointment.</p>
<p>And the idea of her, waiting for me in vain, then wandering
off, perhaps to fall under a bush and die alone, was too
appalling to contemplate. That we must keep together, at all
costs, was like a point of honour, like an article of faith with
us&mdash;confirmed by what we had gone through already. It was
like a law of existence, like a creed, like a defence which, once
broken, would let despair upon our heads. I am sure she would not
have consented to even a temporary separation. She had a sort of
superstitious feeling that, should we be forced apart, even to
the manifest saving of our lives, we would lay ourselves open to
some calamity worse than mere death could be.</p>
<p>I loved her enough to share that feeling, but with the
addition of a man's half-unconscious selfishness. I needed her
indomitable frailness to prop my grosser strength. I needed that
something not wholly of this world, which women's more exalted
nature infuses into their passions, into their sorrows, into
their joys; as if their adventurous souls had the power to range
beyond the orbit of the earth for the gathering of their love,
their hate&mdash;and their charity.</p>
<p>"He calls for death," she said, shrinking with horror and pity
before the mutters of the miserable man at our feet. Every moment
of daylight was of the utmost importance, if we were to save our
freedom, our happiness, our very lives; and we remained rooted to
the spot. For it seemed as though, at last, he had attained the
end of his enterprise. He had captured us, as if by a very cruel
stratagem.</p>
<p>A drowsiness would come at times over those big open eyes,
like a film through which a blazing glance would break out now
and then. He had recognized us perfectly; but, for the most part,
we seemed to him to be the haunting ghosts of his inferno.</p>
<p>"You came from heaven," he raved feebly, rolling his straining
eyes towards Seraphina. His internal injuries must have been
frightful. Perhaps he dared not shift his head&mdash;the only
movement that was in his power. "I reached up to the very angels
in the inspiration of my song," he droned, "and would be called a
demon on earth. <i>Manuel el Demonio</i>. And now precipitated
alive...Nothing less. There is a greatness in me. Let some dew
fall upon my lips."</p>
<p>He moaned from the very bottom of his heart. His teeth
chattered.</p>
<p>"The blessed may not know anything of the cold and thirst of
this place. A drop of dew&mdash;as on earth you used to throw
alms to the poor from your coach&mdash;for the love of God."</p>
<p>She sank on the stones nearer to him than I would willingly
have done, brave as a woman, only, can be before the atrocious
depths of human misery. I leaned my shoulders against the boulder
and crossed my arms on my breast, as if giving up an unequal
struggle. Her hair was loose, her dress stained with ashes, torn
by brambles; the darkness of the cavern seemed to linger in her
hollow cheeks, in her sunken temples.</p>
<p>"He is thirsty," she murmured to me.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>She tore off a strip of her dress, dipped it in the running
water at her side, and approached it, all dripping, to his lips
which closed upon it with avidity. The walls of the rock looked
on implacably, but the rushing stream seemed to hurry away, as if
from an accursed spot.</p>
<p>"Dew from heaven," he sighed out.</p>
<p>"You are on earth, Manuel," she said. "You are given time to
repent. This is earth."</p>
<p>"Impossible," he muttered with difficulty.</p>
<p>He had forced his human fellowship upon us, this man whose
ambition it had been to be called demon on the earth. He held us
by the humanity of his broken frame, by his human glance, by his
human voice. I wonder if, had I been alone, I would have passed
on as reason dictated, or have had the courage of pity and
finished him off, as he demanded. Whenever he became aware of our
presence, he addressed me as "Thou, English ghost," and directed
me, in a commanding voice, to take a stone and crush his head,
before I went back to my own torments. I withdrew, at last, where
he could not see me; but Seraphina never flinched in her task of
moistening his lips with the strip of cloth she dipped in the
brook, time after time, with a sublime perseverance of
compassion.</p>
<p>It made me silent. Could I have stood there and recited the
sinister detail of that man's crimes, in the hope that she would
recoil from him to pursue the road of safety? It was not his
evil, but his suffering that confronted us now. The sense of our
kinship emerged out of it like a fresh horror after we had
escaped the sea, the tempest; after we had resisted untold
fatigues, hunger, thirst, despair. We were vanquished by what was
in us, not in him. I could say nothing. The light ebbed out of
the ravine. The sky, like a thin blue veil stretched between the
earth and the spaces of the universe, filtered the gloom of the
darkness beyond.</p>
<p>I thought of the invisible sun ready to set into the sea, of
the peons riding away, and of our helpless, hopeless state.</p>
<p>"For the love of God," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"Yes, for the love of God," I heard her expressionless voice
repeat. And then there was only the greedy sound of his lips
sucking at the cloth, and the impatient ripple of the stream.</p>
<p>"Come, death," he sighed.</p>
<p>Yes, come, I thought, to release him and to set us free. All
my prayer, now, was that we should be granted the strength to
struggle from under the malignant frown of these crags, to close
our eyes forever in the open.</p>
<p>And the truth is that, had we gone on, we should have found no
one by the sea. The routed <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> had been able
to embark under cover of a fusillade from those on board the
schooner. All that would have met our despair, at the end of our
toilsome march, would have been three dead pirates lying on the
sand. The main body of the peons had gone, already, up the valley
of the river with their few wounded. There would have been
nothing for us to do but to stumble on and on upon their track,
till we lay down never to rise again. They did not draw rein
once, between the sea and the <i>hacienda</i>, sixteen miles
away.</p>
<p>About the time when we began our descent into the ravine, two
of the peons, detached from the main body for the purpose of
observing the schooner from the upland, had topped the edge of
the plain. We had then penetrated into Manuel's inferno, too deep
to be seen by them. These men spent some time lying on the grass,
and watching over the dunes the course of the schooner on the
open sea. Their horses were grazing near them. The wind was
light; they waited to see the vessel far enough down the coast to
make any intention of return improbable.</p>
<p>It was Manuel who saved our lives, defeating his own aim to
the bitter end. Had not his vanity, policy, or the necessity of
his artistic soul, induced him to enter the cave; had not his
cowardice prevented him joining the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>
above, at the moment of the attack; had he not recoiled violently
in a superstitious fear before my apparition at the mouth of the
cave&mdash;we should have been released from our entombment, only
to look once more at the sun. He paid the price of our ransom, to
the uttermost farthing, in his lingering death. Had he killed
himself on the spot, he would have taken our only slender chance
with him into that nether world where he imagined himself to have
been "precipitated alive." Finding him dead, we should have gone
on. Less than ten minutes, no more than another ten paces beyond
the spot, we should have been hidden from sight in the thickets
of denser growth in the lower part of the ravine. I doubt whether
we should have been able to get through; but, even so, we should
have been going away from the only help within our reach. We
should have been lost.</p>
<p>The two <i>vaqueros</i>, after seeing the schooner hull down
under the low, fiery sun of the west, mounted and rode home over
the plain, making for the head of the ravine, as their way lay.
And, as they cantered along the side opposite to the cave, one of
them caught sight of the length of rope dangling down the
precipice. They pulled up at once.</p>
<p>The first I knew of their nearness was the snorting of a horse
forced towards the edge of the chasm. I saw the animal's forelegs
planted tensely on the very brink, and the body of the rider
leaning over his neck to look down. And, when I wished to shout,
I found I could not produce the slightest sound.</p>
<p>The man, rising in his stirrups, the reins in one hand and
turning up the brim of his sombrero with the other, peered down
at us over the pricked ears of his horse. I pointed over my head
at the mouth of the cave, then down at Seraphina, lifting my
hands to show that I was unarmed. I opened my lips wide.
Surprise, agitation, weakness, had robbed me of every vestige of
my voice. I beckoned downwards with a desperate energy, Horse and
rider remained perfectly still, like an equestrian statue set up
on the edge of a precipice. Sera-phina had never raised her
head.</p>
<p>The man's intent scrutiny could not have mistaken me for a
<i>Lugareno</i>. I think he gazed so long because he was amazed
to discover down there a woman on her knees, stooping over a
prostrate body, and a bareheaded man in a ragged white shirt and
black breeches, reeling between the bushes and gesticulating
violently, like an excited mute. But how a rope came to hang down
from a tree, growing in a position so inaccessible that only a
bird could have attached it there struck him as the most
mysterious thing of all. He pointed his finger at it
interrogatively, and I answered this inquiring sign by indicating
the stony slope of the ravine. It seemed as if he could not speak
for wonder. After a while he sat back in his saddle, gave me an
encouraging wave of the hand, and wheeled his horse away from the
brink.</p>
<p>It was as if we had been casting a spell of extinction on each
other's voices. No sooner had he disappeared than I found mine. I
do not suppose it was very loud but, at my aimless screech,
Seraphina looked upwards on every side, saw no one anywhere, and
remained on her knees with her eyes, full of apprehension, fixed
upon me.</p>
<p>"No! I am not mad, dearest," I said. "There was a man. He has
seen us."</p>
<p>"Oh, Juan!" she faltered out, "pray with me that God may have
mercy on this poor wretch and let him die."</p>
<p>I said nothing. My thin, quavering scream after the peon had
awakened Manuel from his delirious dream of an inferno. The voice
that issued from his shattered body was awfully measured, hollow,
and profound.</p>
<p>"You live!" he uttered slowly, turning his eyes full upon my
face, and, as if perceiving for the first time in me the
appearance of a living man. "Ha! You English walk the earth
unscathed."</p>
<p>A feeling of pity came to me&mdash;a pity distinct from the
harrowing sensations of his miserable end. He had been evil in
the obscurity of his life, as there are plants growing harmful
and deadly in the shade, drawing poison from the dank soil on
which they flourish. He was as unconscious of his evil as
they&mdash;but he had a man's right to my pity.</p>
<p>"I am b&mdash;roken," he stammered out.</p>
<p>Seraphina kept on moistening his lips.</p>
<p>"Repent, Manuel," she entreated fervently. "We have forgiven
thee the evil done to us. Repent of thy crimes&mdash;poor
man."</p>
<p>"Your voice, Se&ntilde;orita. What? You! You yourself bringing
this blessing to my lips! In your childhood I cried '<i>viva</i>'
many times before your coach. And now you deign&mdash;in your
voice&mdash;with your hand. Ha! I could improvise&mdash;The star
stoops to the crushed worm..."</p>
<p>A rising clatter of rolling stones mingled from afar with the
broken moanings of his voice. Looking over my shoulder, I saw one
peon beginning the descent of the slope, and, higher up,
motionless between the heads of two horses, the head of another
man&mdash;with the purple tint of an enlarged sky beyond,
reflecting the glow of an invisible sun setting into the sea.</p>
<p>Manuel cried out piercingly, and we shuddered. Seraphina
shrank close to my side, hiding her head on my breast. The peon
staggered awkwardly down the slope, descending sideways in small
steps, embarrassed by the enormous rowels of his spurs. He had a
striped <i>serape</i> over his shoulder, and grasped a
broad-bladed <i>machete</i> in his right hand. His stumbling,
cautious feet sent into the ravine a crashing sound, as though we
were to be buried under a stream of stones.</p>
<p>"<i>Vuestra Se&ntilde;oria</i>" gasped Manuel. "I shall be
silent. Pity me! Do not&mdash;do not withdraw your hand from my
extreme pain."</p>
<p>I felt she had to summon all her courage to look at him again.
She disengaged herself, resolutely, from my enfolding arms.</p>
<p>"No, no; unfortunate man," she said, in a benumbed voice.
"Think of thy end."</p>
<p>"A crushed worm, senorita," he mumbled.</p>
<p>The peon, having reached the bottom of the slope, became lost
to view amongst the bushes and the great fragments of rocks
below. Every sound in the ravine was hushed; and the darkening
sky seemed to cast the shadow of an everlasting night into the
eyes of the dying man.</p>
<p>Then the peon came out, pushing through, in a great swish of
parted bushes. His spurs jingled at every step, his footfalls
crunched heavily on the pebbles. He stopped, as if transfixed,
muttering his astonishment to himself, but asking no questions.
He was a young man with a thin black moustache twisted gallantly
to two little points. He looked up at the sheer wall of the
precipice; he looked down at the group we formed at his feet.
Suddenly, as if returning from an abyss of pain, Manuel declared
distinctly:</p>
<p>"I feel in me a greatness, an inspiration..."</p>
<p>These were his last words. The heavy dark lashes descended
slowly upon the faint gleam of the eyeballs, like a lowered
curtain. The deep folds of the ravine gathered the falling dusk
into great pools of absolute blackness, at the foot of the
crags.</p>
<p>Rising high above our littleness, that watched, fascinated,
the struggle of lights and shadows over the soul entangled in the
wreck of a man's body, the rocks had a monumental indifference.
And between their great, stony faces, turning pale in the gloom,
with the amazed peon as if standing guard, <i>machete</i> in
hand, Manuel's greatness and his inspiration passed away without
as much as an exhaled sigh. I did not even know that he had
ceased to breathe, till Seraphina rose from her knees with a low
cry, and flung far away from her, nervously, the strip of cloth
upon which his parted lips had refused to close.</p>
<p>My arms were ready to receive her. "Ah! At last!" she cried.
There was something resentful and fierce in that cry, as though
the pity of her woman's heart had been put to too cruel a
test.</p>
<p>I, too, had been humane to that man. I had had his life on the
end of my pistol, and had spared him from an impulse that had
done nothing but withhold from him the mercy of a speedy death.
This had been my pity.</p>
<p>But it was Seraphina's cry&mdash;this "At last," showing the
stress and pain of the ordeal&mdash;that shook my faith in my
conduct. It had brought upon our heads a retribution of mental
and bodily anguish, like a criminal weakness. I was young, and my
belief in the justice of life had received a shock. If it were
impossible to foretell the consequences of our acts, if there
were no safety in the motives within ourselves, what remained for
our guidance?</p>
<p>And the inscrutable immobility of towering forms, steeped in
the shadows of the chasm, appeared pregnant with a dreadful
wisdom. It seemed to me that I would never have the courage to
lift my hand, open my lips, make a step, obey a thought. A long
sun-ray shot to the zenith from the beclouded west, crossing
obliquely in a faint red bar the purple band of sky above the
ravine.</p>
<p>The young <i>vaquero</i> had taken off his hat before the
might of death, and made a perfunctory sign of the cross. He
looked up and down the lofty wall, as if it could give him the
word of that riddle. Twice his spurs clashed softly, and, with
one hand grasping the rope, he stooped low in the twilight over
the body.</p>
<p>"We looked for this <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>," he said,
replacing his hat on his head carelessly. "He was a mad singer,
and I saw him once kill one of us very swiftly. They used to call
him in jest, <i>El Demonio</i>. Ah! But you... But you..."</p>
<p>His wonder overcame him. His bewildered eyes glimmered,
staring at us in the deepening dusk.</p>
<p>"Speak, <i>hombre</i>," he cried. "Who are you and who is she?
Whence came you? Where are you going with this woman?..."

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
<p>Not a soul stirred in the one long street of the negro
village. The yellow crescent of the diminished moon swam low in
the pearly light of the dawn; and the bamboo walls of huts,
thatched with palm leaves, glistened here and there through the
great leaves of bananas. All that night we had been moving on and
on, slowly crossing clear <i>savannas</i>, in which nothing
stirred beside ourselves but the escort of our own shadows, or
plunging through dense patches of forest of an obscurity so
impenetrable that the very forms of our rescuers became lost to
us, though we heard their low voices and felt their hands
steadying us in our saddles. Then our horses paced softly on the
dust of a road, while athwart an avenue of orange trees whose
foliage seemed as black as coal, the blind walls of the
<i>hacienda</i> shone dead white like a vision of mists. A
Brazilian aloe flowered by the side of the gate; we drooped in
our saddles; and the heavy knocks against the wooden portal
seemed to go on without cause, and stop without reason, like a
sound heard in a dream. We entered Seraphina's <i>hacienda</i>.
The high walls inclosed a square court deep as the yard of a
prison, with flat-roofed buildings all around. It rang with many
voices suddenly. Every moment the daylight increased; young
n&eacute;gresses in loose gowns ran here and there, cackling like
chased hens, and a fat woman waddled out from under the shadow of
a veranda.</p>
<p>She was Seraphina's old nurse. She was scolding volubly, and
suddenly she shrieked, as though she had been stabbed. Then all
was still for a long time. Sitting high on the back of my patient
mount, with my fingers twisted in the mane, I saw in a throng of
woolly heads and bright garments Seraphina's pale face. An
increasing murmur of sobs and endearing names mounted up to me.
Her hair hung down, her eyes seemed immense; these people were
carrying her off&mdash;and a man with a careworn, bilious face
and a straight, gray beard, neatly clipped on the edges, stood at
the head of my horse, blinking with astonishment.</p>
<p>The fat woman reappeared, rolling painfully along the
veranda.</p>
<p>"Enrico! It is her lover! Oh! my treasure, my lamb, my
precious child. Do you hear, Enrico? Her lover! Oh! the poor
darling of my heart."</p>
<p>She appeared to be giggling and weeping at the same time. The
sky above the yard brightened all at once, as if the sun had
emerged with a leap from the distant waters of the Atlantic. She
waved her short arms at me over the railing, then plunged her
dark fingers in the shock of iron-gray hair gathered on the top
of her head. She turned away abruptly, a yellow head-kerchief
dodged in her way, a slap resounded, a cry of pain, and a negro
girl bolted into the court, nursing her cheek in the palms of her
hands. Doors slammed; other negro girls ran out of the veranda
dismayed, and took cover in various directions.</p>
<p>I swayed to and fro in the saddle, but faithful to the plan of
our escape, I tried to make clear my desire that these peons
should be sworn to secrecy immediately. Meantime, somebody was
trying to disengage my feet from the stirrups.</p>
<p>"Certainly. It is as your worship wishes."</p>
<p>The careworn man at the head of my horse was utterly in the
dark.</p>
<p>"Attention!" he shouted. "Catch hold, <i>hombres</i>. Carry
the <i>caballero</i>."</p>
<p>What <i>caballero?</i> A rosy flush tinged a boundless expanse
above my face, and then came a sudden contraction of space and
dusk. There were big earthen' ware jars ranged in a row on the
floor, and the two <i>vaqueros</i> stood bareheaded, stretching
their arms over me towards a black crucifix on a wall, taking
their oaths, while I rested on my back. A white beard hovered
about my face, a voice said, "It is done," then called anxiously
twice, "Se&ntilde;or! Se&ntilde;or!" and when I had escaped from
the dream of a cavern, I found myself with my head pillowed on a
fat woman's breast, and drinking chicken broth out of a basin
held to my lips. Her large cheeks quivered, she had black
twinkling eyes and slight moustaches at the corners of her lips.
But where was her white beard? And why did she talk of an angel,
as if she were Manuel?</p>
<p>"Seraphina!" I cried, but Castro's cloak swooped on my head
like a sable wing. It was death. I struggled. Then I died. It was
delicious to die. I followed the floating shape of my love beyond
the worlds of the universe. We soared together above pain,
strife, cruelty, and pity. We had left death behind us and
everything of life but our love, which threw a radiant halo
around two flames which were ourselves&mdash;and immortality
inclosed us in a great and soothing darkness.</p>
<p>Nothing stirred in it. We drifted no longer. We hung in it
quite still&mdash;and the empty husk of my body watched our two
flames side by side, mingling their light in an infinite
loneliness. There were two candles burning low on a little black
table near my head. Enrico, with his white beard and zealous
eyes, was bending over my couch, while a chair, on high runners,
rocked empty behind him. I stared.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, the night is far advanced," he said soothingly,
"and Dolores, my wife, watches over Dona Seraphina's slumbers, on
the other side of this wall."</p>
<p>I had been dead to the world for nearly twenty hours, and the
awakening resembled a new birth, for I felt as weak and helpless
as an infant.</p>
<p>It is extraordinary how quickly we regained so much of our
strength; but I suppose people recover sooner from the effects of
privation than from the weakness of disease. Keeping pace with
the return of our bodily vigour, the anxieties of mind returned,
augmented tenfold by all the weight of our sinister experience.
And yet, what worse could happen to us in the future? What other
terror could it hold? We had come back from the very confines of
destruction. But Seraphina, reclining back in an armchair, very
still, with her eyes fixed on the high white wall facing the
veranda across the court, would murmur the word "Separation!"</p>
<p>The possibility of our lives being forced apart was terrible
to her affection, and intolerable to her pride. She had made her
choice, and the feeling she had surrendered herself to so openly
must have had a supreme potency. She had disregarded for it all
the traditions of silence and reserve. She had looked at me
fondly through the very tears of her grief; she had followed
me&mdash;leaving her dead unburied and her prayers unsaid. What
more could she have done to proclaim her love to the world? Could
she, after that, allow anything short of death to thwart her
fidelity? Never! And if she were to discover that I could, after
all, find it in my heart to support an existence in which she had
no share, then, indeed, it would be more than enough to make her
die of shame.</p>
<p>"Ah, dearest!" I said, "you shall never die of shame."</p>
<p>We were different, but we had read each other's natures by a
fierce light. I understood the point of honour in her constancy,
and she never doubted the scruples of my true devotion, which had
brought so many dangers on her head. We were flying not to save
our lives, but to preserve inviolate our truth to each other and
to ourselves. And if our sentiments appear exaggerated, violent,
and overstrained, I must point back to their origin. Our love had
not grown like a delicate flower, cherished in tempered sunshine.
It had never known the atmosphere of tenderness; our souls had
not been awakened to each other by a gentle whisper, but as if by
the blast of a trumpet. It had called us to a life whose enemy
was not death, but separation.</p>
<p>The enemy sat at the gate of our shelter, as death sits at the
gate of life. These high walls could not protect us, nor the
tearful mumble of the old woman's prayers, nor yet the careworn
fidelity of Enrico. The couple hung about us, quivering with
emotion. They peeped round the corners of the veranda, and only
rarely ventured to come out openly. The silent Galician stroked
his clipped beard; the obese woman kept on crossing herself with
loud, resigned sighs. She would waddle up, wiping her eyes, to
stroke Seraphina's head and murmur endearing names. They waited
on us hand and foot, and would stand close together, ready for
the slightest sign, in a rapt contemplation. Now and then she
would nudge her husband's ribs with her thick elbow and murmur,
"Her lover."</p>
<p>She was happy when Seraphina let her sit at her feet, and hold
her hand. She would pat it with gentle taps, squatting
shapelessly on a low stool.</p>
<p>"Why go so far from thy old nurse, darling of my heart? Ah!
love is love, and we have only one life to live, but this England
is very far&mdash;very far away."</p>
<p>She nodded her big iron-gray head slowly; and to our longing
England appeared very distant, too, a fortunate isle across the
seas, an abode of peace, a sanctuary of love.</p>
<p>There was no plan open to us but the one laid down by
Sebright. The secrecy of our sojourn at the <i>hacienda</i> had,
in a measure, failed, though there was no reason to suppose the
two peons had broken their oath. Our arrival at dawn had been
unobserved, as far as we knew, and the domestic slaves, mostly
girls, had been kept from all communication with the field hands
outside. All these square leagues of the estate were very much
out of the world, and this isolation had not been broken upon by
any of O'Brien's agents coming out to spy. It seemed to be the
only part of Seraphina's great possessions that remained
absolutely her own.</p>
<p>Not a whisper of any sort of news reached us in our
hiding-place till the fourth evening, when one of the
<i>vaqueros</i> reported to Enrico that, riding on the inland
boundary, he had fallen in with a company of infantry encamped on
the edge of a little wood. Troops were being moved upon Rio
Medio. He brought a note from the officer in command of that
party. It contained nothing but a requisition for twenty head of
cattle. The same night we left the <i>hacienda</i>.</p>
<p>It was a starry darkness. Behind us the soft wailing of the
old woman at the gate died out:</p>
<p>"So far! So very far!"</p>
<p>We left the long street of the slave village on the left, and
walked down the gentle slope of the open glade towards the little
river. Seraphina's hair was concealed in the crown of a wide
sombrero and, wrapped up in a serape, she looked so much like a
cloaked vaquero that one missed the jingle of spurs out of her
walk. Enrico had fitted me out in his own clothes from top to
toe. He carried a lanthorn, and we followed the circle of light
that swayed and trembled upon the short grass. There was no one
else with us, the crew of the <i>drogher</i> being already on
board to await our coming.</p>
<p>Her mast appeared above the roof of some low sheds grouped
about a short wooden jetty. Enrico raised the lamp high to light
us, as we stepped on board.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken; the five negroes of the crew (Enrico
answered for their fidelity) moved about noiselessly, almost
invisible. Blocks rattled feebly aloft.</p>
<p>"Enrico," said Seraphina, "do not forget to put a stone cross
over poor Castro's grave."</p>
<p>"No, Se&ntilde;orita. May you know years of felicity. We would
all have laid down our lives for you. Remember that, and do not
forget the living. Your childhood has been the consolation of the
poor woman there for the loss of our little one, your foster
brother, who died. We have given to you much of our affection for
him who was denied to our old age."</p>
<p>He stepped back from the rail. "Go with God," he said.</p>
<p>The faint air filled the sail, and the outlines of wharf and
roof fell back into the sombre background of the land, but the
lanthorn in Enrico's hand glimmered motionless at the end of the
jetty, till a bend of the stream hid it from our sight.</p>
<p>We glided smoothly between the banks. Now and then a stretch
of osiers and cane brakes rustled alongside in the darkness. All
was strange; the contours of the land melted before our advance.
The earth was made of shifting shadows, and only the stars
remained in unchanged groups of glitter on the black sky. We
floated across the land-locked basin, and under the low headland
we had steered for from the sea in the storm. All this, seen only
once under streams of lightning, was unrecognizable to us, and
seemed plunged in deep slumber. But the fresh feel of the sea
air, and the freedom of earth and sky wedded on the sea horizon,
returned to us like old friends, the companions of that time when
we communed in words and silences on board the <i>Lion</i>, that
fragment of England found in a mist, boarded in battle, with its
absurd and warmhearted protection. On our other hand, the rampart
of white dunes intruded the line of a ghostly shore between the
depth of the sea and the profundity of the sky; and when the
faint breeze failed for a moment, the negro crew troubled the
silence with the heavy splashes of their sweeps falling in slow
and solemn cadence. The rudder creaked gently; the black in
command was old and of spare build, resembling Cesar, the
major-domo, without the splendour of maroon velvet and gold lace.
He was a very good sailor, I believe, taciturn and intelligent.
He had seen the <i>Lion</i> frequently on his trips to Havana,
and would recognize her, he assured me, amongst a whole host of
shipping. When I had explained what was expected of him,
according to Sebright's programme, a bizarre grimace of a smile
disturbed the bony, mournful cast of his African face.</p>
<p>"Fall on board by accident, Se&ntilde;or. <i>Si!</i> Now, by
St. Jago of Compostella, the patron cf our <i>hacienda</i>, you
shall see this old Pedro&mdash;who has been set to sail the craft
ever since she was built&mdash;as overcome by an accident as a
little rascal of a boy that has stolen a boat."</p>
<p>After this wordy declaration he never spoke to us again. He
gave his short orders in low undertones, and the others, four
stalwart blacks, in the prime of life, executed them in silence.
Another night brought the unchanging stars to look at us in their
multitudes, till the dawn put them out just as we opened the
entrance of the harbour. The daylight discovered the arid
colouring of the coast, a castle on a sandy hill, and a few small
boats with ragged sails making for the land. A brigantine, that
seemed to have carried the breeze with her right in, threw up the
Stars and Stripes radiantly to the rising sun, before rounding
the point. The sound of bells came out to sea, and met us while
we crept slowly on, abreast of the battery at the water's
edge.</p>
<p>"A feast-day in the city," said the old negro at the helm.
"And here is an English ship of war."</p>
<p>The sun-rays struck from afar full at her belted side; the
water was like glass along the shore. She swam into the very
shade of the hill, before she wore round, with great
deliberation, in an ample sweep of her headgear through a
complete half-circle. She came to the wind on the other tack
under her short canvas; her lower deck ports were closed, the
hammock cloths like a ridge of unmelted snow lying along her
rail.</p>
<p>It was evident she was kept standing off and on outside the
harbour, as an armed man may pace to and fro before a gate. With
the hum of six hundred wakeful lives in her flanks, the
tap-tapping of a drum, and the shrill modulations of the
boatswain's calls piping some order along her decks, she floated
majestically across our path. But the only living being we saw
was the red-coated marine on sentry by the lifebuoys, looking
down at us over the taffrail. We passed so close to her that I
could distinguish the whites of his eyes, and the tompions in the
muzzles of her stern-chasers protruding out of the ports
belonging to the admiral's quarters.</p>
<p>I knew her. She was Rowley's flagship. She had thrown the
shadow of her sails upon the end of my first sea journey. She was
the man-of-war going out for a cruise on that day when Carlos,
Tomas, and myself arrived in Jamaica in the old <i>Thames</i>.
And there she was meeting me again, after two years, before
Havana&mdash;the might of the fortunate isle to which we turned
our eyes, part and parcel of my inheritance, formidable with the
courage of my countrymen, humming with my native speech&mdash;and
as foreign to my purposes as if I had forfeited forever my
birthright in her protection. I had drifted into a sort of
outlaw. You may not break the king's peace and be made welcome on
board a king's ship. You may not hope to make use of a king's
ship for the purposes of an elopement. There was no room on board
that seventy-four for our romance.</p>
<p>As it was, I very nearly hailed her. What would become of us
if the Lion had already left Havana? I thought. But no. To hail
her meant separation&mdash;the only forbidden thing to those who,
in the strength of youth and love, are permitted to defy the
world together.</p>
<p>I did not hail; and the marine dwindled to a red speck upon
the noble hull forging away from us on the offshore tack. The
brazen clangour of bells seemed to struggle with the sharp puff
of the breeze that sent us in.</p>
<p>The shipping in harbour was covered with bunting in honour of
the feast-day; for the same reason, there was not a sign of the
usual crowd of small boats that give animation to the waters of a
port; the middle of the harbour was strangely empty. A solitary
bumboat canoe, with a yellow bunch of bananas in the bow, and an
old negro woman dipping a languid paddle at the stern, were all
that met my eye. Presently, however, a six-oared custom-house
galley darted out from the tier of ships, pulling for the
American brigantine. I noticed in her, beside the ordinary port
officials, several soldiers, and a person astonishingly like the
<i>alguazil</i> of the illustrations to Spanish romances. One of
the uniformed sitters waved his hand at us, recognizing an estate
<i>drogher</i>, and shouted some directions, of which we only
caught the words:</p>
<p>"Steps&mdash;examination&mdash;to-morrow."</p>
<p>Our steersman took off his old hat humbly, to hail back,
"<i>Muy bien, Se&ntilde;or</i>."</p>
<p>I breathed freely, for they gave us no more of their
attention. Soldiers, <i>alguazil</i>, and custom-house officers
were swarming aboard the American, as if bent on ransacking her
from stem to stern in the shortest possible time, so as not to be
late for the procession.</p>
<p>The absence of movement in the harbour, the festive and idle
appearance of the ships, with the flutter of innumerable flags on
the forest of masts, and the great uproar of church bells in the
air, made an impressive greeting for our eyes and ears. And the
deserted aspect of the harbour front of the city was very
striking, too. The feast had swept the quays of people so
completely that the tiny pair of sentries at the foot of a tall
yellow building caught the eye from afar. Sera-phina crouched on
a coil of rope under the bulwark; old Pedro, at the tiller,
peered about from under his hand, and I, trying to expose myself
to view as little as possible, helped him to look for the
<i>Lion</i>. There she is. Yes! No! There she was. A crushing
load fell off my chest. We had made her out together, old Pedro
and I.</p>
<p>And then the last part of Sebright's plan had to be carried
out at once. The foresheet of the <i>drogher</i> appeared to
part, our mainsail shook, and before I could gasp twice, we had
drifted stern foremost into the <i>Lion's</i> mizzen chains with
a crash that brought a genuine expression of concern to the old
negro's face. He had managed the whole thing with a most
convincing skill, and without even once glancing at the ship. We
had done our part, but the people of the Lion seemed to fail in
theirs unaccountably. Of all the faces that crowded her rail at
the shock, not one appeared with a glimmer of intelligence. All
the cargo ports were down. Their surprise and their swearing
appeared to me alarmingly unaffected; with a most imbecile
alacrity they exerted themselves, with small spars and boathooks,
to push the drogher off. Nobody seemed to recognize me; Seraphina
might have been a peon sitting on deck, cloaked from neck to
heels and under a sombrero. I dared not shout to them in English,
for fear of being heard on board the other ships around. At last
Sebright himself appeared on the poop.</p>
<p>He gave one look over the side.</p>
<p>"What the devil..." he began. Was he blind, too?</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw him throw up his arms above his head. He
vanished. A port came open with a jerk at the last moment. I
lifted Seraphina up: two hands caught hold of her, and, in my
great hurry to scramble up after her, I barked my shins cruelly.
The port fell; the drogher went on bumping alongside, completely
disregarded. Seraphina dropped the cloak at her feet and flung
off her hat.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, <i>amigos</i>," she said gravely.</p>
<p>A hissed "Damn you fools&mdash;keep quiet!" from Sebright,
stifled the cheer in all those bronzed throats. Only a thin
little poor "hooray" quavered along the deck. The timid steward
had not been able to overcome his enthusiasm. He slapped his head
in despair, and rushed away to bury himself in his pantry.</p>
<p>"Turned up, by heavens!...Go in...Good God!...Bucketfuls of
tears..." stammered Sebright, pushing us into the cuddy. "Go in!
Go in at once!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams rose from behind the table wide-eyed, clasping
her hands, and stumbled twice as she ran to us.</p>
<p>"What have you done to that child, Mr. Kemp!" she cried
insanely at me. "Oh, my dear, my dear! You look like your own
ghost."</p>
<p>Sebright, burning with impatience, pulled me away. The cabin
door fell upon the two women, locked in a hug, and, stepping into
his stateroom, we could do nothing at first but slap each other
on the back and ejaculate the most unmeaning exclamations, like a
couple of jocular idiots. But when, in the expansion of my heart,
I tried to banter him about not keeping his word to look out for
us, he bent double in trying to restrain his hilarity, slapped
his thighs, and grew red in the face.</p>
<p>The excellent joke was that, for the past six days, we had
been supposed to be dead&mdash;drowned; at least Dona Seraphina
had been provided with that sort of death in her own name; I was
drowned, too, but in the disguise of a piratical young English
nobleman.</p>
<p>"There's nothing too bad for them to believe of us," he
commented, and guffawed in his joy at seeing me unscathed. "Dead!
Drowned! Ha! Ha! Good, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams&mdash;he said&mdash;had been weeping her eyes
out over our desolate end; and even the skipper had sulked with
his food for a day or two.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Drowned! Excellent!" He shook me by the shoulders,
looking me straight in the eyes&mdash;and the bizarre, nervous
hilarity of my reception, so unlike his scornful attitude, proved
that he, too, had believed the rumour. Indeed, nothing could have
been more natural, considering my inexperience in handling boats
and the fury of the norther. It had sent the Lion staggering into
Havana in less than twenty hours after we had parted from her on
the coast.</p>
<p>Suddenly a change came over him. He pushed me on to the
settee.</p>
<p>"Speak! Talk! What has happened? Where have you been all this
time? Man, you look ten years older."</p>
<p>"Ten years. Is that all?" I said.</p>
<p>And after he had heard the whole story of our passages he
appeared greatly sobered.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! Wonderful!" he muttered, lost in deep thought,
till I reminded him it was his turn, now, to speak.</p>
<p>"You are the talk of the town," he said, recovering his
elasticity of spirit as he went on. The death of Don Balthasar
had been the first great sensation of Havana, but it seemed that
O'Brien had kept that news to himself, till he heard by an
overland messenger that Sera-phina and I had escaped from Casa
Riego.</p>
<p>Then he gave it to the world; he let it be inferred that he
had the news of both events together. The story, as sworn to by
various suborned rascals, and put out by his creatures, ran that
an English desperado, arriving in Rio Medio with some Mexicans in
a schooner, had incited the rabble of the place to attack the
Casa Riego. Don Balthasar had been shot while defending his house
at the head of his negroes; and Don Bal-thasar's daughter had
been carried off by the English pirate.</p>
<p>The amazement and sensation were extreme. Several of the first
families went into mourning. A service for the repose of Don
Balthasar's soul was sung in the Cathedral. Captain Williams went
there out of curiosity, and returned full of the magnificence of
the sight; nave draped in black, an enormous catafalque, with
silver angels, more than life-size, kneeling at the four corners
with joined hands, an amazing multitude of lights. A
demonstration of unbounded grief from the Judge of the Marine
Court had startled the distinguished congregation. In his place
amongst the body of higher magistrature, Don Patricio O'Brien
burst into an uncontrollable paroxysm of sobs, and had to be
assisted out of the church.</p>
<p>It was almost incredible, but I could well believe it. With
the thunderous strains of <i>Dies Irae</i> rolling over his bowed
head, amongst all these symbols and trappings of woe, he must
have seen, in the black anguish of his baffled passion, the true
image of death itself, and tasted all the profound deception of
life. Who could tell how much secret rage, jealousy, regret, and
despair had gone to that outburst of grief, whose truth had
fluttered a distinguished company of mourners, and had nearly
interrupted their official supplications for the repose of that
old man, who had been dead to the world for so many years? I
believe that, on that very day, just as he was going to the
service, O'Brien had received the news of our supposed death by
drowning. The music, the voices, the lights of the grave, the
pomp of mourning, awe, and supplication crying for mercy upon the
dead, had been too much for him. He had presumed too much upon
his fortitude. He wept aloud for his love lost, for his vengeance
defeated, for the dreams gone out of his life, for the
inaccessible consummation of his desire.</p>
<p>"And, you know, with all these affairs, he feels himself
wobbling in his socket," Sebright began again, after musing for a
while. Indeed, the last events in Rio Medio were endangering his
position. He could no more present his reports upon the state of
the province with incidental reflections upon the bad faith of
the English Government (who encouraged the rebels against the
Catholic king), the arrogance of the English admiral, and
concluding with the loyalty and honesty of the Rio Medio
population, "who themselves suffered many acts of molestation
from the Mexican pirates." The most famous of these papers,
printed at that time in the official <i>Gazette</i>, had
recommended that the loyal town should be given a battery of
thirty-six pounders for purposes of self-defence. They had been
given them just in time to be turned on Rowley's boats; it is
known with what deadly effect. O'Brien's report after that event
had made it clear that that virtuous population of the bay,
exasperated by the intrusions of the Mexicanos upon their
peaceful state, and abhorring in their souls the rebellion trying
to lift its envenomed head, etc., etc.,...heroically manned the
battery to defend their town from the boats which they took to be
these very pirates the British admiral was in search of. He
pleaded for them the uncertain light of the early morning, the
ardour of citizens, valorous, but naturally inexperienced in
matters of war, and the impossibility to suppose that the admiral
of a friendly power would dispatch an armed force to land on
these shores. I have read these things with my own eyes; there
were old files of the <i>Gazette</i> on board, and Sebright, who
had been reading up his O'Brien, pointed them out to me with his
finger, muttering:</p>
<p>"Here&mdash;look there. Pretty, ain't it?"</p>
<p>But that was all over. The bubble had burst. It was reported
in town that the private audience the <i>Juez</i> had lately from
the Captain-General was of a most stormy description. They say
old Marshal What-d'ye-call-'um ended by flinging his last report
in his face, and asking him how dared he work his lawyer's tricks
upon an old soldier. Good old fighting cock. But stupid. All
these old soldiers were stupid, Sebright declared. Old admirals,
too. However, the land troops had arrived in Rio Medio by this
time; the <i>Tornado</i> frigate, too, no doubt, having sailed
four days ago, with orders to burn the villages to the ground;
and the good <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> must be catching colds
trying to hide from the carabineers in the deep, damp woods.</p>
<p>Our admiral was awaiting the issue of that expedition.
Returning home under a cloud, Rowley wanted to take with him the
assurance of the pirate nest being destroyed at last, as a sort
of diplomatic feather in his cap.</p>
<p>"He may think," Sebright commented, "that it's his sailorly
bluff that has done it, but, as far as I can see, nobody but you
yourself, Kemp, had anything to do with bringing it about. Funny,
is it not? Old Rowley keeps his ship dodging outside because it's
cooler at sea than stewing in this harbour, but he sends in a
boat for news every morning. What he is most anxious for is to
get the notorious Nichols into his hands; take him home for a
hanging. It seems clear to me that they are humbugging him
ashore. Nichols! Where's Nichols? There are people here who say
that Nichols has had free board and lodging in Havana jail for
the last six months. Others swear that it is Nichols who has
killed the old gentleman, run off with Dona Seraphina, and got
drowned. Nichols! Who's Nichols? On that showing you are Nichols.
Anybody may be Nichols. Who has ever seen him outside Rio Medio?
I used to believe in him at one time, but, upon my word I begin
to doubt whether there ever was such a man."</p>
<p>"But the man existed, at any rate," I said. "I knew
him&mdash;I've talked with him. He came out second mate in the
same ship with me&mdash;in the old <i>Thames</i>. Ramon took
charge of him in Kingston, and that's the last positive thing I
can swear to, of him. But that he was in Rio Medio for two years,
and vanished from there almost directly after that unlucky boat
affair, I am absolutely certain."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose O'Brien knows where to lay his hand on him.
But no matter where the fellow is, in jail or out of it, the
admiral will never get hold of him. If they had him they could
not think of giving him up. He knows too much of the game; and
remember that O'Brien, if he wobbles in the socket, is by no
means down yet. A man like that doesn't get knocked over like a
ninepin. You may be sure he has twenty skeletons put away in good
places, that he will haul out one by one, rather than let himself
be squashed. He's not going to give in. A few days ago, a
priest&mdash;your priest, you know&mdash;turned up here on foot
from Rio Medio, and went about wringing his hands, declaring that
he knew all the truth, and meant to make a noise about it, too.
O'Brien made short work of him, though; got the archbishop to
send him into retreat, as they call it, to a Franciscan convent a
hundred miles from here. These things are whispered about all
along the gutters of this place."</p>
<p>I imagined the poor Father Antonio, with his simple
resignation, mourning for us in his forced retreat,
brokenhearted, and murmuring, "Inscrutable, inscrutable." I
should have liked to see the old man.</p>
<p>"I tell you the town is fairly buzzing with the atrocities of
this business," Sebright went on. "It's the thing for fashionable
people to go and see what I may call the relics of the crime.
They are on show in the waiting-hall of the Palace of Justice.
Why, I went there myself. You go through a swing door into a big
place that, for cheerfulness, is no better than a monster coal
cellar, and there you behold, laid out on a little black table,
Mrs. Williams' woollen shawl, your Se&ntilde;orita's
tortoise-shell comb, that had got entangled in it somehow, and my
old cap that I lent you&mdash;you remember. I assure you, it gave
me the horrors to see the confounded things spread out there in
that dim religious light. Dash me, if I didn't go queer all over.
And all the time swell carriages stopping before the portico,
dressed-up women walking up in pairs and threes, sighing before
the missus' shawl, turning up their eyes, 'Ah! <i>Pobrecita!
Pobrecita!</i> But what a strange wrap for her to have. It is
very coarse. Perished in the flower of her youth. Incredible! Oh,
the savage, cruel Englishman.' The funniest thing in the
world."</p>
<p>But if this was so, Manuel's <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> were now
in Havana. Sebright pointed out that, as things stood, it was the
safest place for them, under the wing of their patron. Sebright
had recognized the schooner at once. She came in very early one
morning, and hauled herself unostentatiously out of sight amongst
a ruck of small craft moored in the lower part of the harbour. He
took the first opportunity to ask one of the guards on the quay
what was that pretty vessel over there, just to hear what the man
would say. He was assured that she was a Porto Rico trader of no
consequence, well known in the port.</p>
<p>"Never mind the scoundrels; they can do nothing more to
you."</p>
<p>Sebright dismissed the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> out of my life.
The unfavourable circumstance for us was that the captain had
gone ashore. The ship was ready for sea; absolutely cleared;
papers on board; could go in an hour if it came to that; but, at
any rate, next morning at daylight, before O'Brien could get wind
of the Riego <i>drogher</i> arriving. Every movement in port was
reported to the <i>Juez</i>; but this was a feast, and he would
not hear of it probably till next day. Even <i>fiestas</i> had
their uses sometimes. In his anxiety to discover Seraphina,
O'Brien had played such pranks amongst the foreign shipping
(after the <i>Lion</i> had been drawn blank) that the whole
consular body had addressed a joint protest to the Governor, and
the <i>Juez</i> had been told to moderate his efforts. No ship
was to be visited more than once. Still I had seen, myself,
soldiers going in a boat to board the American brigantine: a
garlic-eating crew, poisoning the cabins with their breath, and
poking their noses everywhere. Of course, since our supposed
drowning, there had been a lull; but the least thing might start
him off again. He was reputed to be almost out of his mind with
sorrow, arising from his great attachment for the family. He
walked about as if distracted, suffered from insomnia, and had
not been fit to preside in his court for over a week, now.</p>
<p>"But don't you expect Williams back on board directly?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"No. Not even to-night. He told the missus he was going to
spend the day out of town with his consignee, but he tipped me
the wink. This evening he will send a note that the consignee
detains him for the night, because the letters are not ready, and
I'll have to go to her and lie, the best I am able, that it's
quite the usual thing. Damn!"</p>
<p>I was appalled. This was too bad. And, as I raged against the
dissolute habits of the man, Sebright entreated me to moderate my
voice so as not to be heard in the cabin. Did I expect the man to
change his skin? He had been doing the gay bachelor about here
all his life; had never suspected he was doing anything
particularly scandalous either.</p>
<p>"He married the old girl out of chivalry,&mdash;the romantic
fat beggar,&mdash;and never realized what it meant till she came
out with him," Sebright went on whispering to me. "He loves and
honours her more than you may think. That is so, for all your
shrugs, Mr. Kemp. It is not so easy to break the old connection
as you imagine. Why, the other evening, two of his dissolute
habits (as you call them) came off, with mantillas over their
heads, in a boat, in company with a male scallawag of sorts,
pinching a mandolin, and serenaded the ship for him. We were all
in the cabin after supper, and poor Mrs. Williams, with her eyes
still red from weeping over you people, says to us, 'How sweet
and melancholy that sounds,' says she. You should have seen the
skipper rolling his eyes at me. The perspiration of fright was
simply pouring down his face. I rushed on deck, and it took me
all my Spanish to stop them from coming aboard. I had to swear by
all the saints, and the honour of a <i>caballero</i>, that there
was a wife. They went away laughing at last. They did not want to
make trouble. They simply had not believed the tale before.
Thought it was some dodge of his. I could hear their peals of
laughter all the way up the harbour. These are the difficulties
we have. The old girl must be protected from that sort of
eye-opener, if I've to forswear my soul. I've been keeping guard
over her ever since we arrived here&mdash;besides looking out for
you people, as long as there was any hope."</p>
<p>I was greatly cast down. Perhaps Williams was justified in
making concessions to the associates of his former jolly
existence to save some outrage to the feelings of his consort. I
did not want to criticise his motives&mdash;but what about
getting him back on board at once?</p>
<p>Sebright was biting his lip. The necessity was pressing, he
admitted.</p>
<p>He had an idea where to find him. But for himself he could not
<i>go</i>&mdash;that was evident. Neither would I wish him to
leave the ship, even for a moment, now Seraphina was on board. An
unexpected visit from some zealous police understrapper, a
momentary want of presence of mind on the part of the timid
steward; there was enough to bring about our undoing. Moreover,
as he had said, he must remain on guard over the missus. But whom
to send? There was not a single boatman about. The harbour was a
desert of water and dressed ships; but even the crews of most of
them were ashore&mdash;"on a regular spree of praying," as he
expressed it vexedly. As to our own crew, not one of them knew
anything more of Spanish than a few terms of abuse, perhaps.
Their hearts were in the right place, but as to their wits, he
wouldn't trust a single one of them by himself&mdash;no, not an
inch away from the ship. How could he send one of them ashore
with the wineshops yawning wide on all sides, and not enough
lingo to ask for the way. Sure to get drunk, to get lost, to get
into trouble in some way, and in the end get picked up by the
police. The slightest hitch of that sort would call attention
upon the ship&mdash;and with O'Brien to draw inferences...He
rubbed his head.</p>
<p>"I suppose I'll have to go," he grunted. "But I am known; I
may be followed. They may wonder why I rush to fetch my skipper.
And yet I feel this is the time. The very time. Between now and
four o'clock to-morrow morning we have an almost absolute
certitude of getting away with you two. This is our chance and
your chance."</p>
<p>He was lost in perplexity. Then, as if inspired, I cried:</p>
<p>"I will go!"</p>
<p>"The devil!" he said, amazed. "Would you?"</p>
<p>I rushed at him with arguments. No one would know me. My
clothes were all right and clean enough for a feast-day. I could
slip through the crowds un-perceived. The principal thing was to
get Seraphina out of O'Brien's reach. At the worst, I could
always find means to get away from Cuba by myself. There was Mrs.
Williams to look after her, and if I missed Williams by some
mischance, and failed to make my way back to the ship in time, I
charged them solemnly not to wait, but sail away at the earliest
possible moment.</p>
<p>I said much more than this. I was eloquent. I became as if
suddenly intoxicated by the nearness of freedom and safety. The
thought of being at sea with her in a few hours away from all
trouble of mind or heart, made my head swim. It seemed to me I
should go mad if I was not allowed to go. My limbs tingled with
eagerness. I stuttered with excitement.</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;after all!" Sebright mumbled.</p>
<p>"I must go in and tell her," I said.</p>
<p>"No. Don't do that," said that wise young man. "Have you made
up your mind?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have," I answered. "But she's reasonable."</p>
<p>"Still," he argued, "the old girl is sure to say that nothing
of the kind is necessary. The captain told her that he was coming
back for tea. What could we say to that? We can't explain the
true state of the case, and if you persist in going, it will look
like pig-headed folly on your part."</p>
<p>He threw his writing-desk open for me.</p>
<p>"Write to her. Write down your arguments&mdash;what you have
been telling me. It's a fact that the door stands open for a few
hours. As to the rest," he pursued, with a weary sigh, "I'll do
the lying to pass it off with Mrs. Williams."</p>
<p>Thus it came about that, with only two flimsy bulkheads
between us, I wrote my first letter to Seraphina, while Sebright
went on deck to make arrangements to send me ashore. He was some
time away; long enough for me to pour out on paper the exultation
of my thought, the confidence of my hope, my desire to have her
safe at last with me upon the blue sea. One must seize a
propitious moment lest it should slip away and never return, I
wrote. I begged her to believe I was acting for the best, and
only from my great love, that could not support the thought of
her being so near O'Brien, the arch-enemy of our union. There was
no separation on the sea.</p>
<p>Sebright came in brusquely.</p>
<p>"Come along."</p>
<p>The American brigantine was berthed by then, close astern of
the <i>Lion</i>, and Sebright had the idea of asking her mate to
let his boat (it was in the water) put ashore a visitor he had on
board. His own were hoisted, he explained, and there were no
boatmen plying for hire.</p>
<p>His request was granted. I was pulled ashore by two American
sailors, who never said a word to each other, and evidently took
me for a Spaniard.</p>
<p>It was an excellent idea. By borrowing the Yankee's boat, the
track of my connection with the <i>Lion</i> was covered. The
silent seamen landed me, as asked by Sebright, near the battery
on the sand, quite clear of the city.</p>
<p>I thanked them in Spanish, and, traversing a piece of open
ground, made a wide circle to enter the town from the land side,
to still further cover my tracks. I passed through a sort of
squalid suburb of huts, hovels, and negro shanties. I met very
few people, and these mostly old women, looking after the swarms
of children of all colours and sizes, playing in the dust. Many
curs sunned themselves among heaps of rubbish, and took not the
trouble to growl at me. Then I came out upon a highroad, and
turned my face towards the city lying under a crude sunshine, and
in a ring of metallic vibrations.</p>
<p>Better houses with plastered fronts washed yellow or blue, and
even pinky red, alternated with tumble-down wooden structures. A
crenellated squat gateway faced me with a carved shield of stone
above the open gloom. A young smooth-faced mulatto, in some sort
of dirty uniform, but wearing new straw slippers with blue silk
rosettes over his naked feet, lounged cross-legged at the door of
a kind of guardroom. He held a big cigar tilted up between his
teeth, and ogled me, like a woman, out of the corners of his
languishing eyes. He said not a word.</p>
<p>Fortunately my face had tanned to a dark hue. Enrico's clothes
would not attract attention to me, of course. The light colour of
my hair was concealed by the handkerchief bound under my hat; my
footsteps echoed loudly under the vault, and I penetrated into
the heart of the city.</p>
<p>And directly, it seemed to me, I had stepped back three
hundred years. I had never seen anything so old; this was the
abandoned inheritance of an adventurous race, that seemed to have
thrown all its might, all its vigour, and all its enthusiasm into
one supreme effort of valour and greed. I had read the history of
the Spanish Conquest; and, looking at these great walls of stone,
I felt my heart moved by the same wonder, and by the same
sadness. With what a fury of heroism and faith had this whole
people flung itself upon the opulent mystery of the New World.
Never had a nation clasped closer to its heart its dream of
greatness, of glory, and of romance. There had been a moment in
its destiny, when it could believe that Heaven itself smiled upon
its massacres. I walked slowly, awed by the solitude. They had
conquered and were no more, and these wrought stones remained to
testify gloomily to the death of their success. Heavy houses,
immense walls, pointed arches of the doorways, cages of iron bars
projecting balcony wise around each square window. And not a soul
in sight, not a head looking out from these dwellings, these
houses of men, these ancient abodes of hate, of base rivalries,
of avarice, of ambitions&mdash;these old nests of love, these
witnesses of a great romance now past and gone below the horizon.
They seemed to return mournfully my wondering glances; they
seemed to look at me and say, "What do you here? We have seen
other men, heard other footsteps!" The peace of the cloister
brooded over these aged blocks of masonry, stained with the green
trails of mosses, infiltrated with shadows.</p>
<p>At times the belfry of a church would volley a tremendous
crash of bronze into the narrow streets; and between whiles I
could hear the faint echoes of far-off chanting, the brassy
distant gasps of trombones. A woman in black whisked round a
corner, hurrying towards the route of the procession. I took the
same direction. From a wine-shop, yawning like a dirty cavern in
the basement of a palatial old building, issued suddenly a brawny
ruffian in rags, wiping his thick beard with the back of a hairy
paw. He lurched a little, and began to walk before me hastily. I
noticed the glitter of a gold earring in the lobe of his huge
ear. His cloak was frayed at the bottom into a perfect fringe
and, as he flung it about, he showed a good deal of naked skin
under it. His calves were bandaged crosswise; his peaked hat
seemed to have been trodden upon in filth before he had put it on
his head. Suddenly I stopped short. A <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>!</p>
<p>We were then in the empty part of a narrow street, whose lower
end was packed, close with a crowd viewing the procession which
was filing slowly past, along the wide thoroughfare. It was too
late for me to go back. Moreover, the ruffian paid no attention
to me. It was best to go on. The people, packed between the
houses with their backs to us, blocked our way. I had to
wait.</p>
<p>He took his position near me in the rear of the last rank of
the crowd. He must have been inclined to repentance in his cups,
because he began to mumble and beat his breast. Other people in
the crowd were also beating their breasts. In front of me I had
the fa&ccedil;ade of a building which, according to the little
plan of my route Sebright drew for me, was the Palace of Justice.
It had a peristyle of ugly columns at the top of a flight of
steps. A cordon of infantry kept the roadway clear. The singing
went on without interruption; and I saw tall saints of wood, gilt
and painted red and blue, pass, borne shoulder-high, swaying and
pitching above the heads of the crowd like the masts of boats in
a seaway. Crucifixes were carried, flashing in the sun; an
enormous Madonna, which must have weighed half a ton, tottered
across my line of sight, dressed up in gold brocade and with a
wreath of paper roses on her head. A military band sent a
hurricane blast of brasses as it went by. Then all was still at
once, except the silvery tinkling of hand-bells. The people
before me fell on their knees together and left me standing up
alone.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact I had been caught gaping at the ceremony
quite new to me, and had not expected a move of that sort. The
ruffian kneeling within a foot of me thumped and bellowed in an
ecstasy of piety. As to me, I own I stood there looking with
impatience at a passing canopy that seemed all gold, with three
priests in gorgeous capes walking slowly under it, and I
absolutely forgot to take off my hat. The bearded ruffian looked
up from the midst of his penitential exercises, and before I
realized I was outraging his or anybody else's feelings, leaped
up with a yell, "Thou sacrilegious infidel," and sent my hat
flying off my head.</p>
<p>Just then the band crashed again, the bells pealed out, and no
one heard his shout. With one blow of my fist I sent him
staggering backwards. The procession had passed; people were
rising from their knees and pouring out of the narrow street.
Swearing, he fumbled under his cloak; I watched him narrowly; but
in a moment he sprang away and lost himself amongst the moving
crowd. I picked up my hat.</p>
<p>For a time I stood very uneasy, and then retreated under a
doorway. Nothing happened, and I was anxious to get on. It was
possible to cross the wide street now. That
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> did not know me. He was a
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>, though. No doubt about it. I would make a
dash now; but first I stole a hasty glance at the plan of my
route which I kept in the hollow of my palm.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or," said a voice. I lifted my head.</p>
<p>An elderly man in black, with a white moustache and imperial,
stood before me. The ruffian was stalking up to his side, and
four soldiers with an officer were coming behind. I took in the
whole disaster at a glance.</p>
<p>"The Se&ntilde;or is no doubt a foreigner&mdash;perhaps an
Englishman," said the official in black. He had a lace collar, a
chain on his neck, velvet breeches, a well-turned leg in black
stockings. His voice was soft.</p>
<p>I was so disconcerted that I nodded at him.</p>
<p>"The Se&ntilde;or is young and inconsiderate. Religious
feelings ought to be respected." The official in black was
addressing me in sad and measured tones. "This good Catholic," he
continued, eying the bearded ruffian dubiously, "has made a
formal statement to me of your impious demonstration."</p>
<p>What a fatal accident, I thought, appalled; but I tried to
explain the matter. I expressed regret. The other gazed at me
benevolently.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, Se&ntilde;or, pray follow me. Even for your own
safety. You must give some account of yourself."</p>
<p>This I was firmly resolved not to give. But the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> had been going through a pantomime of
scrutinizing my person. He crouched up, stepped back, then to one
side.</p>
<p>"This worthy man," began the official in black, "complains of
your violence, too..."</p>
<p>"This worthy man," I shouted stupidly, "is a pirate. He is a
Rio Medio <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>. He is a criminal."</p>
<p>The official seemed astounded, and I saw my idiotic mistake at
once&mdash;too late!</p>
<p>"Strange," he murmured, and, at the same time, the ruffianly
wretch began to shout:</p>
<p>"It is he! The traitor! The heretic! I recognize him!"</p>
<p>"Peace, peace!" said the man in black.</p>
<p>"I demand to be taken before the Juez Don Patricio for a
deposition," shrieked the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>. A crowd was
beginning to collect.</p>
<p>The official and the officer exchanged consulting glances. At
a word from the latter, the soldiers closed upon me.</p>
<p>I felt utterly overcome, as if the earth had crumbled under my
feet, and the heavens had been rent in twain.</p>
<p>I walked between my captors across the street amongst hooting
knots of people, and up the steps of the portico, as if in a
frightful dream.</p>
<p>In the gloomy, chilly hall they made me wait. A soldier stood
on each side of me, and there, absolutely before my eyes on a
little table, reposed Mrs. Williams' shawl and Sebright's cap.
This was the very hall of the Palace of Justice of which Sebright
had spoken. It was more than ever like an absurd dream, now. But
I had the leisure to collect my wits. I could not claim the
Consul's protection simply because I should have to give him a
truthful account of myself, and that would mean giving up
Seraphina. The Consul could not protect her. But the <i>Lion</i>
would sail on the morrow. Sebright would understand it if
Williams did not. I trusted Sebright's sagacity. Yes, she would
sail tomorrow evening. A day and a half. If I could only keep the
knowledge of Seraphina from O'Brien till then&mdash;she was safe,
and I should be safe, too, for my lips would be unsealed. I could
claim the protection of my Consul and proclaim the villainy of
the <i>Juez</i>.</p>
<p>"Go in there now, Se&ntilde;or, to be confronted with your
accuser," said the official in black, appearing before me. He
pointed at a small door to the left. My heart was beating
steadily. I felt a sort of intrepid resignation. <a name=

<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<p>"Why have I been brought here, your worships?" I asked, with a
great deal of firmness.</p>
<p>There were two figures in black, the one beside, the other
behind a large black table. I was placed in front of them,
between two soldiers, in the centre of a large, gaunt room, with
bare, dirty walls, and the arms of Spain above the judge's
seat.</p>
<p>"You are before the <i>Juez de la Primiera Instancia</i>,"
said the man in black beside the table. He wore a large and
shadowy tricorn. "Be silent, and respect the procedure."</p>
<p>It was, without doubt, excellent advice. He whispered some
words in the ear of the Judge of the First Instance. It was plain
enough to me that the judge was a quite inferior official, who
merely decided whether there were any case against the accused;
he had, even to his clerk, an air of timidity, of doubt.</p>
<p>I said, "But I insist on knowing..."</p>
<p>The clerk said, "In good time..." And then, in the same tone
of disinterested official routine, he spoke to the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>, who, from beside the door, rolled very
frightened eyes from the judges and the clerk to myself and the
soldiers&mdash;"Advance."</p>
<p>The judge, in a hurried, perfunctory voice, put questions to
the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>; the clerk scratched with a large
quill on a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>"The town of Rio Medio, Excellency."</p>
<p>"Of what occupation?"</p>
<p>"Excellency&mdash;a few goats..."</p>
<p>"Why are you here?"</p>
<p>"My daughter, Excellency, married Pepe of the posada in the
Calle..."</p>
<p>The judge said, "Yes, yes," with an unsanguine impatience. The
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o's</i> dirty hands jumped nervously on the
large rim of his limp hat.</p>
<p>"You lodge a complaint against the senor there."</p>
<p>The clerk pointed the end of his quill towards me.</p>
<p>"I? God forbid, Excellency," the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>
bleated. "The <i>Alguazil</i> of the Criminal Court instructed me
to be watchful.</p>
<p>"You lodge an information, then?" the <i>juez</i> said.</p>
<p>"Maybe it is an information, Excellency," the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> answered, "as regards the senor
there."</p>
<p>The <i>Alguazil</i> of the Criminal Court had told him, and
many other men of Rio Medio, to be on the watch for me,
"undoubtedly touching what had happened, as all the world knew,
in Rio Medio."</p>
<p>He looked me full in the face with stupid insolence, and
said:</p>
<p>"At first I much doubted, for all the world said this man was
dead&mdash;though others said worse things. Perhaps, who
knows?"</p>
<p>He had seen me, he said, many times in Rio Medio, outside the
Casa; on the balcony of the Casa, too. And he was sure that I was
a heretic and an evil person.</p>
<p>It suddenly struck me that this man&mdash;I was undoubtedly
familiar with his face&mdash;must be the lieutenant of
Manuel-del-Popolo, his boon companion. Without doubt, he had seen
me on the balcony of the Casa.</p>
<p>He had gained a lot of assurance from the conciliatory manner
of the <i>Juez</i>, and said suddenly, in a tentative way:</p>
<p>"An evil person; a heretic? Who knows? Perhaps it was he who
incited some people there to murder his se&ntilde;oria, the
illustrious Don."</p>
<p>I said almost contemptuously, "Surely the charge against me is
most absurd? Everyone knows who I am."</p>
<p>The old judge made a gentle, tired motion with his hand.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or," he said, "there is no charge against
you&mdash;except that no one knows who you are. You were in a
place where very lamentable and inexplicable things happened; you
are now in Havana: you have no passport. I beg of you to remain
calm. These things are all in order."</p>
<p>I hadn't any doubt that, as far as he knew, he was speaking
the truth. He was a man, very evidently, of a weary and
na&iuml;ve simplicity. Perhaps it was really true&mdash;that I
should only have to explain; perhaps it was all over.</p>
<p>O'Brien came into the room with the casual step of an official
from an office entering another's room.</p>
<p>It was as if seeing me were a thing that he very much
disliked&mdash;that he came because he wanted to satisfy himself
of my existence, of my identity, and my being alone. The slow
stare that he gave me did not mitigate the leisureliness of his
entry. He walked behind the table; the judge rose with immense
deference; with his eternal smile, and no word spoken, he
motioned the judge to resume the examination; he stood looking at
the clerk's notes meditatively, the smile still round lips that
had a nervous tremble, and eyes that had dark marks beneath them.
He seemed as if he were still smiling just after having been
violently shaken.</p>
<p>The judge went on examining the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>.</p>
<p>"Do you know whence the se&ntilde;or came?"</p>
<p>"Excellency, Excellency..." The man stuttered, his eyes on
O'Brien's face.</p>
<p>"Nor how long he was in the town of Rio Medio?" the judge went
on.</p>
<p>O'Brien suddenly drooped towards his ear. "All those things
are known, senor, my colleague," he said, and began to
whisper.</p>
<p>The old judge showed signs of very na&iuml;ve astonishment and
joy.</p>
<p>"Is it possible?" he exclaimed. "This man? He is very young to
have committed such crimes."</p>
<p>The clerk hurriedly left the room. He returned with many
papers. O'Brien, leaning over the judge's shoulder, emphasized
words with one finger. What new villainies could O'Brien be
meditating? It wasn't possibly the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o's</i>
suggestion that I had lured men to murder Don Balthasar? Was it
merely that I had infringed some law in carrying off
Seraphina?</p>
<p>The old judge said, "How lucky, Don Patricio! We may now
satisfy the English admiral. What good fortune!"</p>
<p>He suddenly sat straight in his chair; O'Brien behind him
scrutinized my face&mdash;to see how I should bear what was
coming.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" the judge asked peremptorily.</p>
<p>I said, "Juan&mdash;John Kemp. I am of noble English family; I
am well enough known. Ask the Se&ntilde;or O'Brien."</p>
<p>On O'Brien's shaken face the smile hardened.</p>
<p>"I heard that in Rio Medio the senor was called...was
called..." He paused and appealed to the
<i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>.</p>
<p>"What was he called&mdash;the <i>capataz</i> the man who led
the picaroons?"</p>
<p>The <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> stammered, "Nikola...Nikola el
Escoces, Se&ntilde;or Don Patricio."</p>
<p>"You hear?" O'Brien asked the judge. "This villager identifies
the man."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly&mdash;undoubtedly," the <i>Juez</i> said. "We
need no more evidence...You, Se&ntilde;or, have seen this villain
in Rio Medio, this villager identifies him by name."</p>
<p>I said, "This is absurd. A hundred witnesses can say that I am
John Kemp..."</p>
<p>"That may be true," the <i>Juez</i> said dryly, and then to
his clerk:</p>
<p>"Write here, 'John Kemp, of noble British family, called, on
the scene of his crimes, Nikola el Escoces, otherwise El
Demonio.'"</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. I did not, at the moment, realize to
what this all tended.</p>
<p>The judge said to the clerk, "Read the Act of Accusation. Read
here..." He was pointing to a paragraph of the papers the clerk
had brought in. They were the Act of Accusation, prepared long
before, against the man Nichols.</p>
<p>This particular villainy suddenly became grotesquely and
portentously plain. The clerk read an appalling catalogue of
sordid crimes, working into each other like kneaded
dough&mdash;the testimony of witnesses who had signed the record.
Nikola had looted fourteen ships, and had apparently murdered
twenty-two people with his own hand&mdash;two of them
women&mdash;and there was the affair of Rowley's boats. "The
pinnace," the clerk read, "of the British came within ten yards.
The said Nikola then exclaimed, 'Curse the bloodthirsty hounds,'
and fired the grapeshot into the boat. Seven were killed by that
discharge. This I saw with my own eyes... Signed, Isidoro
Alemanno." And another swore, "The said Nikola was below, but he
came running up, and with one blow of his knife severed the
throat of the man who was kneeling on the deck..."</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Nikola had committed these crimes;
that the witnesses had sworn to them and signed the
deposition...The old judge had evidently never seen him, and now
O'Brien and the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> had sworn that I was
Nikola el Escoces, alias El Demonio.</p>
<p>My first impulse was to shout with rage; but I checked it
because I knew I should be silenced. I said:</p>
<p>"I am not Nikola el Escoces. That I can easily prove."</p>
<p>The Judge of the First Instance shrugged his shoulders and
looked, with implicit trust, up into O'Brien's face.</p>
<p>"That man," I pointed at the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i>, "is a
pirate. And, what is more, he is in the pay of the Se&ntilde;or
Juez O'Brien. He was the lieutenant of a man called
Manuel-del-Popolo, who commanded the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>
after Nikola left Rio Medio."</p>
<p>"You know very much about the pirates," the <i>Juez</i> said,
with the sardonic air of a very stupid man. "Without doubt you
were intimate with them. I sign now your order for committal to
the <i>carcel</i> of the Marine Court."</p>
<p>I said, "But I tell you I am not Nikola..."</p>
<p>The <i>Juez</i> said impassively, "You pass out of my hands
into those of the Marine Court. I am satisfied that you are a
person deserving of a trial. That is the limit of my
responsibility."</p>
<p>I shouted then, "But I tell you this O'Brien is my personal
enemy."</p>
<p>The old man smiled acidly.</p>
<p>"The se&ntilde;or need fear nothing of our courts. He will be
handed over to his own countrymen. Without doubt of them he will
obtain justice." He signed to the <i>Lugare&ntilde;o</i> to go,
and rose, gathering up his papers; he bowed to O'Brien. "I leave
the criminal at the disposal of your worship," he said, and went
out with his clerk.</p>
<p>O'Brien sent out the two soldiers after him, and stood there
alone. He had never been so near his death. But for sheer
curiosity, for my sheer desire to know what he <i>could</i> say,
I would have smashed in his brains with the clerk's stool. I was
going to do it; I made one step towards the stool. Then I saw
that he was crying.</p>
<p>"The curse&mdash;the curse of Cromwell on you," he sobbed
suddenly. "You send me back to hell again." He writhed his whole
body. "Sorrow!" he said, "I know it. But what's this? What's
<i>this?</i>"</p>
<p>The many reasons he had for sorrow flashed on me like a
procession of sombre images.</p>
<p>"Dead and done with a man can bear," he muttered. "But
this&mdash;Not to know&mdash;perhaps alive&mdash;perhaps
hidden&mdash;She may be dead..." With a change like a flash he
was commanding me.</p>
<p>"Tell me how you escaped."</p>
<p>I had a vague inspiration of the truth.</p>
<p>"You aren't fit for a decent man's speaking to," I said.</p>
<p>"You let her drown."</p>
<p>It gave me suddenly the measure of his ignorance; he did not
know anything&mdash;nothing. His hell was uncertainty. Well, let
him stay there.</p>
<p>"Where is she?" he said. "Where is she?"</p>
<p>"Where she's no need to fear you," I answered.</p>
<p>He had a sudden convulsive gesture, as if searching for a
weapon.</p>
<p>"If you'll tell me she's alive..." he began.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not dead," I answered.</p>
<p>"Never a drowned puppy was more," he said, with a flash of
vivacity. "You hang here&mdash;for murder&mdash;or in England for
piracy."</p>
<p>"Then I've little to want to live for," I sneered at him.</p>
<p>"You let her drown," he said. "You took her from that house, a
young girl, in a little boat. And you can hold up your head."</p>
<p>"I was trying to save her from you," I answered.</p>
<p>"By God," he said. "These English&mdash;I've seen them, spit
the child on the mother's breast. I've seen them set fire to the
thatch of the widow and childless. But this...But this...I can
save you, I tell you."</p>
<p>"You can't make me go through worse than I've borne," I
answered. Sorrow and all he might wish on my head, my life was
too precious to him till I spoke. I wasn't going to speak.</p>
<p>"I'll search every ship in the harbour," he said
passionately.</p>
<p>"Do," I said. "Bring your <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> to the
task."</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I wasn't much afraid. Unless he got definite
evidence he couldn't&mdash;in the face of the consul's protests,
and the presence of the admiral&mdash;touch the <i>Lion</i>
again. He fixed his eyes intently upon me.</p>
<p>"You came in the American brigantine," he said. "It's known
you landed in her boat."</p>
<p>I didn't answer him; it was plain enough that the
<i>drogher's</i> arrival had either not been reported to him, or
it had been searched in vain.</p>
<p>"In her boat," he repeated. "I tell you I know she is not
dead; even you, an Englishman, must have a different face if she
were."</p>
<p>"I don't at least ask you for life," I said, "to enjoy with
her."</p>
<p>"She's alive," he said. "Alive! As for where, it matters
little. I'll search every inch of the island, every road, every
<i>hacienda</i>. You don't realize my power."</p>
<p>"Then search the bottom of the sea," I shouted.</p>
<p>"Let's look at the matter in the right light."</p>
<p>He had mastered his grief, his incertitude. He was himself
again, and the smile had returned&mdash;as if at the moment he
forced his features to their natural lines.</p>
<p>"Send one of your friars to heaven&mdash;you'll never go there
yourself to meet her."</p>
<p>"If you will tell me she's alive, I'll save you."</p>
<p>I made a mute, obstinate gesture.</p>
<p>"If she's alive, and you don't tell me, I can't but find her.
And I'll make you know the agonies of suspense&mdash;a long way
from here."</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>"If she's dead, and you'll tell me, I'll save you some
trouble. If she's dead and you don't, you'll have your own
remorse and the rest, too."</p>
<p>I said, "You're too Irish mysterious for me to understand. But
you've a choice of four evils for me&mdash;choose yourself."</p>
<p>He continued with a quivering, taut good-humour: "Prove to me
she's dead, and I'll let you die sharply and mercifully."</p>
<p>"You won't believe!" I said; but he took no notice.</p>
<p>"I tell you plainly," he smiled. "If we find...if we find her
dear body&mdash;and I can't help; but I've men on the watch all
along the shores&mdash;I'll give you up to your admiral for a
pirate. You'll have a long slow agony of a trial; I know what
English justice is. And a disgraceful felon's death."</p>
<p>I was thinking that, in any case, a day or so might be gained,
the <i>Lion</i> would be gone; they could not touch her while the
flagship remained outside. I certainly didn't want to be given up
to the admiral; I might explain the mistaken identity. But there
was the charge of treason in Jamaica. I said:</p>
<p>"I only ask to be given up; but you daren't do it for your own
credit. I can show you up."</p>
<p>He said, "Make no mistake! If he gets you, he'll hang you.
He's going home in disgrace. Your whole blundering Government
will work to hang you."</p>
<p>"They know pretty well," I answered, "that there are queer
doings in Havana. I promise you, I'll clear things up. I know too
much..."</p>
<p>He said, with a sudden, intense note of passion, "Only tell me
where her grave is, I'll let you go free. You couldn't, you dare
not, dastard that you are, go away from where she
died&mdash;without...without making sure."</p>
<p>"Then search all the new graves in the island," I said, "I'll
tell you nothing...Nothing!"</p>
<p>He came at me again and again, but I never spoke after that.
He made all the issues clearer and clearer&mdash;his own side
involuntarily and all the griefs I had to expect. As for him, he
dared not kill me&mdash;and he dared not give me up to the
admiral. In his suspense, since, for him, I was the only person
in the world who knew Seraphina's fate, he dared not let me out
of his grip. And all the while he had me he must keep the admiral
there, waiting for the surrender either of myself or of some
other poor devil whom he might palm off as Nikola el Escoces.
While the admiral was there the <i>Lion</i> was pretty safe from
molestation, and she would sail pretty soon.</p>
<p>At the same time, except for the momentary sheer joy of
tormenting a man whom I couldn't help regarding as a devil, I had
more than enough to fear. I had suffered too much; I wanted rest,
woman's love, slackening off. And here was another endless
coil&mdash;endless. If it didn't end in a knife in the back, he
might keep me for ages in Havana; or he might get me sent to
England, where it would take months, an endless time, to prove
merely that I wasn't Nikola el Escoces. I should prove it; but,
in the meantime, what would become of Sera-phina? Would she
follow me to England? Would she even know that I had gone there?
Or would she think me dead and die herself? O'Brien knew nothing;
his spies might report a hundred uncertainties. He was standing
rigidly still now, as if afraid to move for fear of breaking
down. He said suddenly:</p>
<p>"You came in some ship; you can't deceive me, I shall have
them all searched again."</p>
<p>I said desperately, "Search and be damned&mdash;whatever ships
you like."</p>
<p>"You cold, pitiless, English scoundrel," he shrieked suddenly.
The breaking down of his restraint had let him go right into
madness. "You have murdered her. You cared nothing; you came from
nowhere. A beggarly fool, too stupid to be even an adventurer. A
miserable blunderer, coming in blind; coming out blind; and
leaving ruin and worse than hell. What good have you done
yourself? What could you? What did you see? What did you
hope?...Sorrow? Ruin? Death? I am acquainted with them. It is in
the blood; 'tis in the tone; in the entrails of us, in our
mother's milk. Your accursed land has brought always that on our
own dear and sorrowful country...You waste, you ruin, you spoil.
What for?...Tell me what for? Tell me? Tell me? What did you
gain? What will you ever gain? An unending curse!...But, ah,
ye've no souls."</p>
<p>He called very loudly, as if with a passionate relief, his
voice giving life to an unsuspected, misgiving echo:</p>
<p>"Guards! Soldiers!...You shall be shot, now!"</p>
<p>He was going to cut the knot that way. Two soldiers pushed the
door noisily open, their muskets advanced. He took no notice of
them; and they retained an attitude of military stupidity, their
eyes upon him. He whispered:</p>
<p>"No, no! Not yet!"</p>
<p>Then he looked at me searchingly, as if he still hoped to get
some certainty from my face, some inkling, perhaps some
inspiration of what would persuade me to speak. Then he shook his
wrists violently, as if in fear of himself.</p>
<p>"Take him away," he said. "Away! Out of reach of my hands. Out
of reach of my hands."</p>
<p>I was trembling a good deal; when the soldiers entered I
thought I had got to my last minute. But, as it was, he had not
learnt a thing from me. Not a thing. And I did not see where else
he could go for information. <a name="2HCH0031">

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>The entrance to the common prison of Havana was a sort of
lofty tunnel, finished by great, iron-rusted, wooden gates. A
civil guard was exhibiting the judge's warrant for my committal
to a white-haired man, with a red face and blue eyes, that seemed
to look through tumbled bushes of silver eyebrows&mdash;the
<i>alcayde</i> of the prison. He bowed, and rattled two
farcically large keys. A practicable postern was ajar on the
yellow wood of the studded gates. It was as if it afforded a
glimpse of the other side of the world. The venerable turnkey, a
gnome in a steeple-crowned hat, protruded a blood-red hand
backwards in the direction of the postern.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or Caballero," he croaked, "I pray you to consider
this house your own. My servants are yours."</p>
<p>Within was a gravel yard, shut in by portentous lead-white
house-sides with black window holes. Under each row of windows
was a vast vaulted tunnel, caged with iron bars, for all the
world like beasts' dens. It being day, the beasts were out and
lounging about the <i>patio</i>. They had an effect of infinite
tranquillity, as if they were ladies and gentlemen parading in a
Sunday avenue. Perhaps twenty of them, in snowy white shirts and
black velvet knee-breeches, strutted like pigeons in a knot, some
with one woman on the arm, some with two. Bundles of variegated
rags lay against the walls, as if they were sweepings. Well, they
were the sweepings of Havana jail. The men in white and black
were the great thieves...and there were children, too&mdash;the
place was the city orphanage. For the fifth part of a second my
advent made no difference. Then, at the far end, one of the men
in black and white separated himself, and came swiftly to me
across the sunny <i>patio</i>. The others followed slowly, with
pea-fowl steps, their women hanging to them and whispering. The
bundles of rags rose up towards me; others slunk furtively out of
the barred dens. The man who was approaching had the head of a
Julius C&aelig;sar of fifty, for all the world as if he had
stolen a bust and endowed it with yellow skin and stubby gray and
silver hair. He saluted me with intense gravity and an imperial
glance of yellow eyes along a hooked nose. His linen was the most
spotless broidered and embossed stuff; &icirc;rom the crimson
scarf round his waist protruded the shagreen and silver handle of
a long dagger. He said:</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or, I have the honour to salute you. I am
Crisostomo Garcia. I ask the courtesy of your trousers."</p>
<p>I did not answer him. I did not see what he wanted with my
trousers, which weren't anyway as valuable as his own. The others
were closing in on me like a solid wall. I leant back against the
gate; I was not frightened, but I was mightily excited. The man
like C&aelig;sar looked fiercely at me, swayed a long way back on
his haunches, and imperiously motioned the crowd to recede.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or Inglesito," he said, "the gift I have the honour
to ask of you is the price of my protection. Without it these, my
brothers, will tear you limb from limb, there will nothing of you
remain."</p>
<p>His brothers set up a stealthy, sinister growl, that went
round among the heads like the mutter of an obscene echo among
the mountain-tops. I wondered whether this, perhaps, was the man
who, O'Brien said, would put a knife in my back. I hadn't any
knife; I might knock the fellow's teeth down his throat,
though.</p>
<p>The <i>alcayde</i> thrust his immense hat, blood-red face, and
long, ragged, silver locks out of the little door. His features
were convulsed with indignation. He had been whispering with the
Civil Guard.</p>
<p>"Are you mad, gentlemen?" he said. "Do you wish to visit hell
before your times? Do you know who the senor is? Did you ever
hear of Carlos el Demonio? This is the <i>Inglesito</i> of Rio
Medio!"</p>
<p>It was plain that my deeds, such as they were, reported by
O'Brien spies, by the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>, by all sorts of
credulous gossipers, had got me the devil of a reputation in the
<i>patio</i> of the jail. Men detached themselves from the crowd,
and went running about to announce my arrival. The <i>alcayde</i>
drew his long body into the <i>patio</i>, and turned to lock the
little door with an immense key. In the crowd all sorts of little
movements happened. Women crossed themselves, and furtively
thrust pairs of crooked, skinny, brown, black-nailed fingers in
my direction. The man like C&aelig;sar said:</p>
<p>"I ask your pardon, Se&ntilde;or Caballero. I did not know.
How could I tell? You are free of all the <i>patios</i> in this
land."</p>
<p>The tall <i>alcayde</i> finished grinding the immense key in
the lock, and touched me on the arm.</p>
<p>"If the senor will follow me," he said. "I will do the honours
of this humble mansion, and indicate a choice of rooms where he
may be free from the visits of these gentry."</p>
<p>We went up steps, and through long, shadowy corridors, with
here and there a dark, lounging figure, like a stag seen in the
dim aisles of a wood. The <i>alcayde</i> threw open a door.</p>
<p>The room was like a blazing oblong-box, filled with light, but
without window or chimney. Two men were fencing in the
illumination of some twenty candles stuck all round the mildewed
white walls on lumps of clay. There was a blaze of silver things,
like an altar of a wealthy church, from a black, carved table in
the far corner. The two men, in shirts and breeches, revolved
round each other, their rapiers clinking, their left arms
scarved, holding buttoned daggers. The <i>alcayde</i>
proclaimed:</p>
<p>"Don Vincente Salazar, I have the honour to announce an
English senor."</p>
<p>The man with his face to me tossed his rapier impatiently into
a corner. He was a plump, dark Cuban, with a brooding truculence.
The other faced round quickly. His cheeks shone in the
candle-light like polished yellow leather, his eyes were narrow
slits, his face lugubrious. He scrutinized me intently, then
drawled:</p>
<p>"My! You?...Hang me if I didn't think it would be you!"</p>
<p>He had the air of surveying a monstrosity, and pulled the neck
of his dirty print shirt open, panting. He slouched out into the
corridor, and began whispering eagerly to the <i>alcayde</i>. The
little Cuban glowered at me; I said I had the honour to salute
him.</p>
<p>He muttered something contemptuous between his teeth. Well, if
he didn't want to talk to me, I didn't want to talk to him. It
had struck me that the tall, sallow man was undoubtedly the
second mate of the <i>Thames</i>. Nicholas, the real Nikola el
Escoces! The Cuban grumbled suddenly:</p>
<p>"You, Se&ntilde;or, are without doubt one of the spies of that
friend of the priests, that O'Brien. Tell him to
beware&mdash;that I bid him beware. I, Don Vincente Salazar de
Valdepefias y Forli y..."</p>
<p>I remembered the name; he was once the suitor of
Seraphina&mdash;the man O'Brien had put out of the way. He
continued with a grotesque frown of portentous significance:</p>
<p>"To-morrow I leave this place. And your compatriot is very
much afraid, Se&ntilde;or. Let him fear! Let him fear! But a
thousand spies should not save him."</p>
<p>The tall <i>alcayde</i> came hurriedly back and stood bowing
between us. He apologized abjectly to the Cuban for intruding me
upon him. But the room was the best in the place at the disposal
of the prisoners of the Juez O'Brien. And I was a noted
<i>caballero</i>. Heaven knows what I had not done in Rio Medio.
Burnt, slain, ravished...The Se&ntilde;or Juez was understood to
be much incensed against me. The gloomy Cuban at once rushed upon
me, as if he would have taken me into his arms.</p>
<p>"The <i>Inglesito</i> of Rio Medio!" he said. "Ha, ha! Much
have I heard of you. Much of the senor's valiance! Many tales!
That foul eater of the carrion of the priests wishes your life!
Ah, but let him beware! I shall save you, Se&ntilde;or&mdash;I,
Don Vincente Salazar."</p>
<p>He presented me with the room&mdash;a remarkably bare place
but for his properties: silver branch candlesticks, a silver
chafing-dish as large as a basin. They might have been chased by
Cellini&mdash;one used to find things like that in Cuba in those
days, and Salazar was the person to have them. Afterwards, at the
time of the first insurrection, his eight-mule harness was sold
for four thousand pounds in Paris&mdash;by reason of the gold and
pearls upon it. The atmosphere, he explained, was fetid, but his
man was coming to burn sandal-wood and beat the air with
fans.</p>
<p>"And to-morrow!" he said, his eyes rolling. Suddenly he
stopped. "Se&ntilde;or," he said, "is it true that my venerated
friend, my more than father, has been murdered&mdash;at the
instigation of that fiend? Is it true that the senorita has
disappeared? These tales are told."</p>
<p>I said it was very true.</p>
<p>"They shall be avenged," he declared, "to-morrow! I shall seek
out the senorita. I shall find her. I shall find her! For me she
was destined by my venerable friend."</p>
<p>He snatched a black velvet jacket from the table and put it
on.</p>
<p>"Afterwards, Se&ntilde;or, you shall relate. Have no fear. I
shall save you. I shall save all men oppressed by this scourge of
the land. For the moment afford me the opportunity to meditate."
He crossed his arms, and dropped his round head. "Alas, yes!" he
meditated.</p>
<p>Suddenly he waved towards the door. "Se&ntilde;or," he said
swiftly, "I must have air; I stifle. Come with me to the
corridor..."</p>
<p>He went towards the window giving on to the <i>patio</i>; he
stood in the shadow, his arms folded, his head hanging
dejectedly. At the moment it grew suddenly dark, as if a veil had
been thrown over a lamp. The sun had set outside the walls. A
drum began to beat. Down below in the obscurity the crowd
separated into three strings and moved slowly towards the barren
tunnels. Under our feet the white shirts disappeared; the ragged
crowd gravitated to the left; the small children strung into the
square cage-door. The drum beat again and the crowd hurried. Then
there was a clang of closing grilles and lights began to show
behind the bars from deep recesses. In a little time there was a
repulsive hash of heads and limbs to be seen under the arches
vanishing a long way within, and a little light washed across the
gravel of the <i>patio</i> from within.</p>
<p>"Se&ntilde;or," the Cuban said suddenly, "I will pronounce his
panegyric. He was a man of a great gentleness, of an inevitable
nobility, of an invariable courtesy. Where, in this degenerate
age, shall we find the like!" He stopped to breathe a sound of
intense exasperation.</p>
<p>"When I think of these Irish,..." he said. "Of that
O'Brien..." A servant was arranging the shining room that we had
left. Salazar interrupted himself to give some orders about a
banquet, then returned to me. "I tell you I am here for
introducing my knife to the spine of some sort of Madrid
<i>embustero</i>, a man who was insolent to my <i>amiga</i>
Clara. Do you believe that for that this O'Brien, by the
influence of the priests whose soles he licks with his tongue,
has had me inclosed for many months? Because he feared me! Aha! I
was about to expose him to the noble don who is now dead! I was
about to wed the Se&ntilde;orita who has disappeared. But
to-morrow...I shall expose his intrigue to the Captain-General.
You, Se&ntilde;or, shall be my witness! I extend my protection to
you..." He crossed his arms and spoke with much deliberation.
"Se&ntilde;or, this Irishman incommodes me, Don Vincente Salazar
de Valdepe&ntilde;as y Forli..." He nodded his head expressively.
"Se&ntilde;or, we offered these Irish the shelter of our robe for
that your Government was making martyrs of them who were good
Christians, and it behoves us to act in despite of your
Government, who are heretics and not to be tolerated upon God's
Christian earth. But, Se&ntilde;or, if they incommoded your
Government as they do us, I do not wonder that there was a desire
to remove them. Se&ntilde;or, the life of that man is not worth
the price of eight mules, which is the price I have paid for my
release. I might walk free at this moment, but it is not fitting
that I should slink away under cover of darkness. I shall go out
in the daylight with my carriage. And I will have an offering to
show my friends who, like me, are incommoded by this..." The man
was a monomaniac; but it struck me that, if I had been O'Brien, I
should have felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the dark of the corridor a long shape appeared, lounging.
The Cuban beside me started hospitably forward.</p>
<p>"<i>Vamos</i>," he said briskly; "to the banquet..." He waved
his hand towards the shining door and stood aside. We
entered.</p>
<p>The other man was undoubtedly the Nova Scotian mate of the
<i>Thames</i>, the man who had dissuaded me from following Carlos
on the day we sailed into Kingston Harbour. He was chewing a
toothpick, and at the ruminant motion of his knife-jaws I seemed
to see him, sitting naked to the waist in his bunk, instead of
upright there in red trousers and a blue shirt&mdash;an immense
lank-length of each. I pieced his history together in a sort of
flash. He was the true Nikola el Escoces; his name was Nichols,
and he came from Nova Scotia. He had been the chief of O'Brien's
<i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i>. He surveyed me now with a twinkle in his
eyes, his yellow jaws as shiny-shaven as of old; his arms as much
like a semaphore. He said mockingly:</p>
<p>"So you went there, after all?"</p>
<p>But the Cuban was pressing us towards his banquet; there was
<i>gaspacho</i> in silver plates, and a man in livery holding
something in a napkin. It worried me. We surveyed each other in
silence. I wondered what Nichols knew; what it would be safe to
tell him; how much he could help me? One or other of these men
undoubtedly might. The Cuban was an imbecile; but he might have
some influence&mdash;and if he really were going out on the
morrow, and really did go to the Captain-General, he certainly
could further his own revenge on O'Brien by helping me...But as
for Nichols...</p>
<p>Salazar began to tell a long, exaggerated story about his
cook, whom he had imported from Paris.</p>
<p>"Think," he said; "I bring the fool two thousand
miles&mdash;and then&mdash;not even able to begin on a land-crab.
A fool!"</p>
<p>The Nova Scotian cast an uninterested side glance at him, and
said in English, which Salazar did not understand:</p>
<p>"So you went there, after all? And now <i>he's</i> got you." I
did not answer him. "I know all about you," he added.</p>
<p>"It's more than I do about you," I said.</p>
<p>He rose and suddenly jerked the door open, peered on each side
of the corridor, and then sat down again.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid to tell," he said defiantly. "I'm not afraid
of anything. I'm safe."</p>
<p>The Cuban said to me in Spanish: "This senor is my friend.
Everyone who hates that devil is my friend."</p>
<p>"I'm safe," Nichols repeated. "I know too much about our
friend the raparee." He lowered his voice. "They say you're to be
given up for piracy, eh?" His eyes had an extraordinarily anxious
leer. "You are now, eh? For how much? Can't you tell a man? We're
in the same boat! I kin help you!"</p>
<p>Salazar accidentally knocked a silver goblet off the table
and, at the sound, Nichols sprang half off his chair. He glared
in a wild stare around him then grasped at a flagon of
<i>aguardiente</i> and drank.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of any damn thing" he said. "I've got a hold
on that man. He dursen't give me up. I kin see! He's going to
give you up and say you're responsible for it all."</p>
<p>"I don't know what he's going to do," I answered.</p>
<p>"Will you not, Se&ntilde;or," Salazar said suddenly, "relate,
if you can without distress, the heroic death of that venerated
man?"</p>
<p>I glanced involuntarily at Nichols. "The distress," I said,
"would be very great. I was Don Balthasar's kinsman. The
Se&ntilde;or O'Brien had a great fear of my influence in the
Casa. It was in trying to take me away that Don Balthasar, who
defended me, was slain by the <i>Lugare&ntilde;os</i> of
O'Brien."</p>
<p>Salazar said, "Aha! Aha! We are kindred spirits. Hated and
loved by the same souls. This fiend, Se&ntilde;or. And
then..."</p>
<p>"I escaped by sea&mdash;in an open boat, in the confusion.
When I reached Havana, the <i>Juez</i> had me arrested."</p>
<p>Salazar raised both hands; his gestures, made for large, grave
men, were comic in him. They reduced Spanish manners to
absurdity. He said:</p>
<p>"That man dies. That man dies. To-morrow I go to the
Captain-General. He shall hear this story of yours, Se&ntilde;or.
He shall know of these machinations which bring honest men to
this place. We are a band of brothers..."</p>
<p>"That's what I say." Nichols leered at me. "We're all in the
same boat."</p>
<p>I expect he noticed that I wasn't moved by his declaration. He
said, still in English:</p>
<p>"Let us be open. Let's have a council of war. This O'Brien
hates me because I wouldn't fire on my own countrymen." He
glanced furtively at me. "I wouldn't," he asserted; "he wanted me
to fire into their boats; but I wouldn't. Don't you believe the
tales they tell about me! They tell worse about you. Who says I
would fire on my countrymen? Where's the man who says it?" He had
been drinking more brandy and glared ferociously at me. "None of
your tricks, my hearty," he said. "None of your getting out and
spreading tales. O'Brien's my friend; he'll never give me up. He
dursen't. I know too much. You're a pirate! No doubt it was you
who fired into them boats. By God I'll be witness against you if
they give me up. I'll show you up."</p>
<p>All the while the little Cuban talked swiftly and with a
saturnine enthusiasm. He passed the wine rapidly.</p>
<p>"My own countrymen!" Nichols shouted. "Never! I shot a Yankee
lieutenant&mdash;Allen he was&mdash;with my own hand. That's
another thing. I'm not a man to trifle with. No, sir. Don't you
try it...Why, I've papers that would hang O'Brien. I sent them
home to Halifax. I know a trick worth his. By God, let him try
it! Let him only try it. He dursen't give me up..."</p>
<p>The man in livery came in to snuff the candles. Nichols sprang
from his seat in a panic and drew his knife with frantic haste.
He continued, glaring at me from the wall, the knife in his
hand:</p>
<p>"Don't you dream of tricks. I've cut more throats than you've
kissed gals in your little life."</p>
<p>Salazar himself drew an immense pointed knife with a shagreen
hilt. He kissed it rapturously.</p>
<p>"Aha!...Aha!" he said, "bear this kiss into his ribs at the
back." His eyes glistened with this mania. "I swear it; when I
next see this dog; this friend of the priests." He threw the
knife on the table. "Look," he said, "was ever steel truer or
more thirsty?"</p>
<p>"Don't you make no mistake," Nichols continued to me. "Don't
you think to presume. O'Brien's my friend. I'm here snug and out
of the way of the old fool of an admiral. That's why he's kept
waiting off the Morro. When he goes, I walk out free. Don't you
try to frighten me. I'm not a man to be frightened."</p>
<p>Salazar bubbled: "Ah, but now the wine flows and is red. We
are a band of brothers, each loving the other. Brothers, let us
drink."</p>
<p>The air of close confinement, the blaze, the feel of the jail,
pressed upon me, and I felt sore, suddenly, at having eaten and
drunk with those two. The idea of Seraphina, asleep perhaps,
crying perhaps, something pure and distant and very blissful,
came in upon me irresistibly.</p>
<p>The little Cuban said, "We have had a very delightful
conversation. It is very plain this O'Brien must die."</p>
<p>I rose to my feet. "Gentlemen," I said in Spanish, "I am very
weary; I will go and sleep in the corridor."</p>
<p>The Cuban sprang towards me with an immense anxiety of
hospitableness. I was to sleep on his couch, the couch of cloth
of gold. It was impossible, it was insulting, that I should think
of sleeping in the corridor. He thrust me gently down upon it,
making with his plump hands the motions of smoothing it to
receive me. I lay down and turned my face to the wall.</p>
<p>It wasn't possible to sleep, even though the little Cuban,
with a tender solicitude, went round the walls blowing out the
candles. He might be useful to me, might really explain matters
to the Captain-General, or might even, as a last resource, take a
letter from me to the British Consul. But I should have to be
alone with him. Nichols was an abominable scoundrel; bloodthirsty
to the defenceless; a liar; craven before the ghost of a threat.
No doubt O'Brien did not want to give him up. Perhaps he
<i>had</i> papers. And no doubt, once he could find a trace of
Seraphina's whereabouts, O'Brien would give me up. All I could do
was to hope for a gain of time. And yet, if I gained time, it
could only mean that I should in the end be given up to the
admiral.</p>
<p>And Seraphina's whereabouts. It came over me lamentably that I
myself did not know. The <i>Lion</i> might have sailed. It was
possible. She might be at sea. Then, perhaps, my only chance of
ever seeing her again lay in my being given up to the admiral, to
stand in England a trial, perhaps for piracy, perhaps for
treason. I might meet her only in England, after many years of
imprisonment. It wasn't possible. I would not believe in the
possibility. How I loved her! How wildly, how
irrationally&mdash;this woman of another race, of another world,
bound to me by sufferings together, by joys together.
Irrationally! Looking at the matter now, the reason is plain
enough. Before then I had not lived. I had only waited&mdash;for
her and for what she stood for. It was in my blood, in my race,
in my tradition, in my training. We, all of us for generations,
had made for efficiency, for drill, for restraint. Our Romance
was just this very Spanish contrast, this obliquity of vision,
this slight tilt of the convex mirror that shaped the same world
so differently to onlookers at different points of its
circle.</p>
<p>I could feel a little of it even then, when there was only the
merest chance of my going back to England and getting back
towards our old position on the rim of the mirror. The
deviousness, the wayward passion, even the sempiternal abuses of
the land were already beginning to take the aspect of something
like quaint impotence. It was charm that, now I was on the road
away, was becoming apparent. The inconveniences of life, the
physical discomforts, the smells of streets, the heat, dropped
into the background. I felt that I did not want to go away,
irrevocably from a land sanctioned by her presence, her young
life. I turned uneasily to the other side. At the heavy black
table, in the light of a single candle, the Cuban and the Nova
Scotian were discussing, their heads close together.</p>
<p>"I tell you no," Nichols was saying in a fluent, abominable,
literal translation into Spanish. "Take the knife so...thumb
upwards. Stab down in the soft between the neck and the
shoulder-blade. You get right into the lungs with the point. I've
tried it: ten times. Never stick the back. The chances are he
moves, and you hit a bone. There are no bones there. It's the way
they kill pigs in New Jersey."</p>
<p>The Cuban bent his brows as if he were reflecting over a
chessboard. "Ma..." he pondered. His knife was lying on the
table. He unsheathed it, then got up, and moved behind the seated
Nova Scotian.</p>
<p>"You say...there?" he asked, pressing his little finger at the
base of Nichols' skinny column of a neck. "And then..." He
measured the length of the knife on Nichols's back twice with
elaborate care, breathing through his nostrils. Then he said with
a convinced, musing air, "It is true. It would go down into the
lungs."</p>
<p>"And there are arteries and things," Nichols said.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the Cuban answered, sheathing the knife and
thrusting it into his belt.</p>
<p>"With a knife that length it's perfect." Nichols waved his
shadowy hand towards Salazar's scarf. Salazar moved off a
little.</p>
<p>"I see the advantages," he said. "No crying out, because of
the blood in the lungs. I thank yous Se&ntilde;or Escoces."</p>
<p>Nichols rose, lurching to his full height, and looked in my
direction. I closed my eyes. I did not wish him to talk to me. I
heard him say:</p>
<p>"Well, <i>hasta mas ver</i>. I shall get away from here.
Good-night."</p>
<p>He swayed an immense shadow through the door. Salazar took the
candle and followed him into the corridor.</p>
<p>Yes, that was it, why she was so great a part, a whole wall, a
whole beam of my life's house. I saw her suddenly in the
blackness, her full red lips, her quivering nostrils, the curve
of her breasts, her lithe movements from the hips, the way she
set her feet down, the white flower waxen in the darkness of her
hair, and the robin-wing flutter of her lids over her gray eyes
when she smiled. I moved convulsively in my intense desire. I
would have given my soul, my share of eternity, my honour, only
to see that flutter of the lids over the shining gray eyes. I
never felt I was beneath the imponderable pressure of a prison's
wall till then. She was infinite miles away; I could not even
imagine what inanimate things surrounded her. She must be talking
to someone else; fluttering her lids like that. I recognized with
a physical agony that was more than jealousy how slight was my
hold upon her. It was not in her race, in her blood as in mine,
to love me and my type. She had lived all her life in the middle
of Romance, and the very fire and passion of her South must make
me dim prose to her. I remember the flicker of Salazar's
returning candle, cast in lines like an advancing scythe across
the two walls from the corridor. I slept.</p>
<p>I had the feeling of appalled horror suddenly invading my
sleep; a vast voice seemed to be exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Tell me where she is!"</p>
<p>I looked at the glowing horn of a lanthorn. It was O'Brien who
held it. He stood over me, very sombre.</p>
<p>"Tell me where she is," he said, the moment my eyes
opened.</p>
<p>I said, "She's...she's&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I don't know."</p>
<p>It appalls me even now to think how narrow was my escape. It
was only because I had gone to sleep in the thought that I did
not know, that I answered that I did not know. Ah&mdash;he was a
cunning devil! To suddenly wake one; to get one's thoughts before
one had had time to think! I lay looking at him, shivering. I
couldn't even see much of his face.</p>
<p>"Where is she?" he said again. "Where? Dead? Dead? God have
mercy on your soul if the child is dead!"</p>
<p>I was still trembling. If I had told him!&mdash;I could hardly
believe I had not. He continued bending over me with an attitude
that hideously mocked solicitude.</p>
<p>"Where is she?" he asked again.</p>
<p>"Ransack the island," I said. He glared at me, lifting the
lamp. "The whole earth, if you like."</p>
<p>He ground his teeth, bending very low over me; then stood up,
raising his head into the shadow above the lamp.</p>
<p>"What do I care for all the admirals?" he was speaking to
himself. "No ship shall leave Havana till..." He groaned. I heard
him slap his forehead, and say distractedly, "But perhaps she is
not in a ship."</p>
<p>There was a silence in which I heard him breathe heavily, and
then he amazed me by saying:</p>
<p>"Have pity."</p>
<p>I laughed, lying on my back. "On you!"</p>
<p>He bent down. "Fool! on yourself."</p>
<p>A vast and towering shadow ran along the wall.</p>
<p>There wasn't a sound. The face of Salazar appeared behind him,
and an uplifted hand grasping a knife. O'Brien saw the horror in
my eyes. I gasped to him: "Look..." and before he could move the
knife went softly home between neck and shoulder. Salazar glided
to the door and turned to wave his hand at me. O'Brien's lips
were pressed tightly together, the handle of the knife was
against his ear, the lanthorn hung at the end of his rigid arm
for a moment. As he lowered it, the blood spurted from his
shoulder as if from a burst stand-pipe, only black and warm. It
fell over my face, over my hands, everywhere. For a minute of
eternity his agonized eyes searched my features, as if to discern
whether I had connived, whether I condoned.</p>
<p>I had started up, my face coming right against his. I felt an
immense horror. What did it mean? What had he done? He had been
such a power for so long, so inevitably, over my whole life that
I could not even begin to understand that this was not some new
subtle villainy of his. He shook his head slowly, his ear
disturbing the knife.</p>
<p>Then he turned jerkily on his heel, the lanthorn swinging
round and leaving me in his shadow. There were ten paces to reach
the door. It was like the finish of a race whether he would cover
the remaining seven after the first three steps. The dangling
lanthorn shed small patches of light through the holes in the
metal top, like sunlight through leaves, upon the gloom of the
remote ceiling. At the fifth step he pressed his hand
spasmodically to his mouth; at the sixth he wavered to one side.
I made a sudden motion as if to save him from falling. He was
dying! He was dying! I hardly realized what it meant. This
immense weight was being removed from me. I had no need to fear
him any more. I couldn't understand, I could only look. This was
his passing. This...</p>
<p>He sank, knelt down, placing the Ian thorn on the floor. He
covered his face with his hands and began to cough incessantly,
like a man dying of consumption. The glowing top of the lanthorn
hissed and sputtered out in little sharp blows, like hammer
strokes...Carlos had coughed like that. Carlos was dead. Now
O'Brien! He was going. I should escape. It was all over. Was it
all over? He bowed stiffly forward, placing his hands on the
stones, then lay over on his side with his face to the light, his
eyes glaring at it. I sat motionless, watching him. The lanthorn
lit the carved leg of the black table and a dusty circle of the
flags. The spurts of blood from his shoulder grew less long in
answer to the pulsing of his heart; his fists unclenched, he drew
his legs up to his body, then sank down. His eyes looked suddenly
at mine and, as the features slowly relaxed, the smile seemed to
come back, enigmatic, round his mouth.</p>
<p>He was dead; he was gone; I was free! He would never know
where she was; never! He had gone, with the question on his lips;
with the agony of uncertainty in his eyes. From the door came an
immense, grotesque, and horrible chuckle.</p>
<p>"Aha!-Aha! I have saved you, Se&ntilde;or, I have protected
you. We are as brothers."</p>
<p>Against the tenuous blue light of the dawn Salazar was
gesticulating in the doorway. I felt a sudden repulsion; a
feeling of intense disgust. O'Brien lying there, I almost wished
alive again&mdash;I wanted to have him again, rather than that I
should have been relieved of him by that atrocious murder. I sat
looking at both of them.</p>
<p>Saved! By that lunatic? I suddenly appreciated the agony of
mind that alone could have brought O'Brien, the cautious, the
all-seeing, into this place&mdash;. to ask me a question that for
him was answered now. Answered for him more than for me.</p>
<p>Where was Seraphina? Where? How should I come to her? O'Brien
was dead. And I...Could I walk out of this place and go to her?
O'Brien was dead. But I...</p>
<p>I suddenly realized that now I was the pirate Nikola el
Escoces&mdash;that now he was no more there, nothing could save
me from being handed over to the admiral. Nothing.</p>
<p>Salazar outside the door began to call boastfully towards the
sound of approaching footsteps.'</p>
<p>"Aha! Aha! Come all of you! See what I have done! Come,
Se&ntilde;or Alcayde! Come, brave soldiers..."</p>
<p>In that way died this man whose passion had for so long hung
over my life like a shadow. Looking at the matter now, I am,
perhaps, glad that he fell neither by my hand nor in my quarrel.
I assuredly had injured him the first; I had come upon his
ground; I had thwarted him; I had been a heavy weight at a time
when his fortunes had been failing. Failing they undoubtedly
were. He had run his course too far.</p>
<p>And, if his death removed him out of my path, the legacy of
his intrigue caused me suffering enough. Had he lived, there is
no knowing what he might have done. He was bound to deliver
someone to the British&mdash;either myself or Nichols. Perhaps,
at the last moment, he would have kept me in Havana. There is no
saying.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly he had not wished to deliver Nichols; either
because he really knew too much or because he had scruples.
Nichols had certainly been faithful to him. And, with his fine
irony, it was delightful to him to think that I should die a
felon's death in England. For those reasons he had identified me
with Nikola el Escoces, intending to give up whichever suited him
at the last moment.</p>
<p>Now that was settled for him and for me. The delivery was to
take place at dawn, and O'Brien not to be found, the old Judge of
the First Instance had been sent to identify the prisoner. He
selected me, whom, of course, he recognized. There was no
question of Nichols, who had been imprisoned on a charge of theft
trumped up by O'Brien.</p>
<p>Salazar, whether he would have gone to the Captain-General or
not, was now entirely useless. He was retained to answer the
charge of murder. And to any protestations I could make, the old
<i>Juez</i> was entirely deaf.</p>
<p>"The senor must make representations to his own authorities,"
he said. "I have warrant for what I have done."</p>
<p>It was impossible to expose O'Brien to him. The soldiers of
the escort, in the dawn before the prison gates, simply laughed
at me.</p>
<p>They marched me down through the gray mists, to the water's
edge. Two soldiers held my arms; O'Brien's blood was drying on my
face and on my clothes. I was, even to myself, a miserable
object. Among the n&eacute;gresses on the slimy boat-steps a
thick, short man was asking questions. He opened amazed eyes at
the sight of me. It was Williams&mdash;the <i>Lion</i> was not
yet gone then. If he spoke to me, or gave token of connection
with Seraphina, the Spaniards would understand. They would take
her from him certainly; perhaps immure her in a convent. And now
that I was bound irrevocably for England, she must go, too. He
was shouldering his way towards my guards.</p>
<p>"Silence!" I shouted, without looking at him. "Go away, make
sail... Tell Sebright..."</p>
<p>My guards seemed to think I had gone mad; they laid hands upon
me. I didn't struggle, and we passed down towards the landing
steps, brushing Williams aside. He stood perturbedly gazing after
me; then I saw him asking questions of a civil guard. A
man-of-war's boat, the ensign trailing in the glassy water, the
glazed hats of the seamen bobbing like clockwork, was flying
towards us. Here was England! Here was home! I should have to
clear myself of felony, to strain every nerve and cheat the
gallows. If only Williams understood, if only he did not make a
fool of himself. I couldn't see him any more; a jabbering crowd
all round us was being kept at a distance by the muskets of the
soldiers. My only chance was Sebright's intelligence. He might
prevent Williams making a fool of himself. The commander of the
guard said to the lieutenant from the flagship, who had landed,
attended by the master-at-arms:</p>
<p>"I have the honour to deliver to your worship's custody the
prisoner promised to his excellency the English admiral. Here are
the papers disclosing his crimes to the justice. I beg for a
receipt."</p>
<p>A shabby <i>escrivano</i> from the prison advanced bowing,
with an inkhorn, shaking a wet goose-quill. A <i>guardia
civil</i> offered his back. The lieutenant signed a paper
hastily, then looking hard at me, gave the order:</p>
<p>"Master-at-arms, handcuff one of the prisoner's hands to your
own wrist. He is a desperate character." <a name="2HCH0032">

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>The first decent word I had spoken to me after that for months
came from my turnkey at Newgate. It was when he welcomed me back
from my examination before the Thames Court magistrate. The
magistrate, a bad-tempered man, snuffy, with red eyes, and the
air of being a piece of worn and dirty furniture of his court,
had snapped at me when I tried to speak:</p>
<p>"Keep your lies for the Admiralty Session. I've only time to
commit you. Damn your Spaniards; why can't they translate their
own papers;" had signed something with a squeaky quill, tossed it
to his clerk, and grunted, "Next case."</p>
<p>I had gone back to Newgate.</p>
<p>The turnkey, a man with the air of an innkeeper, bandy-legged,
with a bulbous, purple-veined nose and watering eyes, slipped out
of the gatehouse door, whilst the great, hollow-sounding gate
still shook behind me. He said:</p>
<p>"If you hurries up you'll see a bit of life...Do you good.
Condemned sermon. Being preached in the chapel now; sheriffs and
all. They swing tomorrow&mdash;three of them. Quick with the
stumps."</p>
<p>He hurried me over the desolate mossy-green cobbles of the
great solitary yard into a square, tall, bare, whitewashed place.
Already from the outside one caught a droning voice. There might
have been three hundred people there, boxed off in pews, with
turnkeys at each end. A vast king's arms, a splash of red and
blue gilt, sprawled above a two-tiered pulpit that was like the
trunk of a large broken tree. The turnkey pulled my hat off, and
nudged me into a box beside the door.</p>
<p>"Kneel down," he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>I knelt. A man with a new wig was droning out words, waving
his hands now and then from the top of the tall pulpit. Beneath
him a smaller man in an old wig was dozing, his head bent
forward. The place was dirty, and ill-lighted by the tall, grimy
windows, heavily barred. A pair of candles flickered beside the
preacher's right arm...</p>
<p>"They that go down to the sea in ships, my poor brethren," he
droned, "lying under the shadow..."</p>
<p>He directed his hands towards a tall deal box painted black,
isolated in the centre of the lower floor. A man with a red head
sat in it, his arms folded; another had his arms covering his
head, which leant abjectly forward on the rail in front. There
were large rusty gyves upon his wrists.</p>
<p>"But observe, my poor friends," the chaplain droned on, "the
psalmist saith, 'At the last He shall bring them unto the desired
haven.' Now..."</p>
<p>The turnkey whispered suddenly into my ear: "Them's the
condemned he's preaching at, them in the black pew. See Roguey
Cullen wink at the woman prisoners up there in the gallery...Him
with the red hair...All swings to-morrow."</p>
<p>"After they have staggered and reeled to and fro, and been
amazed... observe. After they have been tempted; even after they
have fallen..."</p>
<p>The sheriffs had their eyes decorously closed. The clerk
reached up from below the preacher, and snuffed one of the
candles. The preacher paused to rearrange his shining wig. Little
clouds of powder flew out where he touched it. He struck his
purple velvet cushion, and continued:</p>
<p>"At the last, I say, He shall bring them to the haven they had
desired."</p>
<p>A jarring shriek rose out of the black pew, and an insensate
jangling of irons rattled against the hollow wood. The ironed
man, whose head had been hidden, was writhing in an epileptic
fit. The governor began signalling to the jailers, and the whole
dismal assembly rose to its feet, and craned to get a sight. The
jailers began hurrying them out of the building. The redheaded
man was crouching in the far corner of the black box.</p>
<p>The turnkey caught the end of my sleeve, and hurried me out of
the door.</p>
<p>"Come away," he said. "Come out of it...Damn my good
nature."</p>
<p>We went swiftly through the tall, gloomy, echoing stone
passages. All the time there was the noise of the prisoners being
marshalled somewhere into their distant yards and cells. We went
across the bottom of a well, where the weeping December light
struck ghastly down on to the stones, into a sort of
rabbit-warren of black passages and descending staircases, a
horror of cold, solitude, and night. Iron door after iron door
clanged to behind us in the stony blackness. After an
interminable traversing, the turnkey, still with his hand on my
sleeve, jerked me into my familiar cell. I hadn't thought to be
glad to get back to that dim, frozen, damp-chilled little hole;
with its hateful stone walls, stone ceiling, stone floor, stone
bed-slab, and stone table; its rope mat, foul stable-blanket, its
horrible sense of eternal burial, out of sound, out of sight
under a mined mountain of black stones. It was so tiny that the
turnkey, entering after me, seemed to be pressed close up to my
chest, and so dark that I could not see the colour of the dirty
hair that fell matted from the bald patch on the top of his
skull; so familiar that I knew the feel of every little worming
of rust on the iron candlestick. He wiped his face with a brown
rag of handkerchief, and said:</p>
<p>"Curse me if ever I go into that place again." After a time he
added: "Unless 'tis a matter of duty."</p>
<p>I didn't say anything; my nerves were still jangling to that
shrieking, and to the clang of the iron doors that had closed
behind me. I had an irresistible impulse to get hold of the iron
candlestick and smash it home through the skull of the
turnkey&mdash;as I had done to the men who had killed Seraphina's
father...to kill this man, then to creep along the black passages
and murder man after man beside those iron doors until I got to
the open air.</p>
<p>He began again. "You'd think we'd get used to it&mdash;you'd
think we would&mdash;but 'tis a strain for us. You never knows
what the prisoners will do at a scene like that there. It drives
'em mad. Look at this scar. Machell the forger done that for me,
'fore he was condemned, after a sermon like that&mdash;a quiet,
gentlemanly man, much like you. Lord, yes, 'tis a strain..." He
paused, still wiping his face, then went on: "<i>And</i> I swear
that when I sees them men sit there in that black pew, an' hev
heard the hammers going clack, clack on the scaffolding outside,
and knew that they hadn't no more chance than you have to get out
of there..." He pointed his short thumb towards the handkerchief
of an opening, where the little blurr of blue light wavered
through the two iron frames crossed in the nine feet of well.
"Lord, you <i>never</i> gets used to it. You <i>wants</i> them to
escape; 'tis in the air through the whole prison, even the
debtors. I tells myself again and again, 'You're a fool for your
pains.' But it's the same with the others&mdash;my mates. You
can't get it out of your mind. That little kid now. I've seen
children swing; but that little kid&mdash;as sure to swing as
what...as what <i>you</i> are..."</p>
<p>"You think I am going to swing?" I asked.</p>
<p>I didn't want to kill him any more; I wanted too much to hear
him talk. I hadn't heard anything for months and months of
solitude, of darkness&mdash;on board the admiral's ship, stranded
in the guardship at Plymouth, bumping round the coast, and now
here in Newgate. And it had been darkness all the time. Jove!
That Cuban time, with its movements, its pettiness, its intrigue,
its warmth, even its villainies showed plainly enough in the
chill of that blackness. It had been romance, that life.</p>
<p>Little, and far away, and irrevocably done with, it showed all
golden. There wasn't any romance where I lay then; and there had
been irons on my wrists; gruff hatred, the darkness, and always
despair.</p>
<p>On board the flagship coming home I had been chained down in
the cable-tier&mdash;a place where I could feel every straining
of the great ship. Once these had risen to a pandemonium, a
frightful tumult. There was a great gale outside. A sailor came
down with a lanthorn, and tossed my biscuit to me.</p>
<p>"You d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d pirate," he said, "maybe it's you
saving us from drowning."</p>
<p>"Is the gale very bad?" I had called.</p>
<p>He muttered&mdash;and the fact that he spoke to me at all
showed how great the strain of the weather must have been to
wring any words out of him:</p>
<p>"Bad&mdash;there's a large Indiaman gone. We saw her one
minute and then..." He went away, muttering.</p>
<p>And suddenly the thought had come to me. What if the Indiaman
were the <i>Lion</i>&mdash;the <i>Lion</i> with Seraphina on
board? The man would not speak to me when he came again. No one
would speak to me; I was a pirate who had fired on his own
countrymen. And the thought had pursued me right into
Newgate&mdash;if she were dead; if I had taken her from that
security, from that peace, to end there...And to end myself.</p>
<p>"Swing!" the turnkey said; "you'll swing right enough." He
slapped the great key on his flabby hand. "You can tell that by
the signs. You, being an Admiralty case, ought to have been in
the Marshalsea. And you're ordered solitary cell, and I'm tipped
the straight wink against your speaking a blessed word to a
blessed soul. Why don't they let you see an attorney? Why?
Because they <i>mean</i> you to swing."</p>
<p>I said, "Never mind that. Have you heard of a ship called the
<i>Lion?</i> Can you find out about her?"</p>
<p>He shook his head cunningly, and did not answer. If the
<i>Lion</i> had been here, I must have heard. They couldn't have
left me here.</p>
<p>I said, "For God's sake find out. Get me a shipping
gazette."</p>
<p>He affected not to hear.</p>
<p>"There's money in plenty," I said.</p>
<p>He winked ponderously and began again. "Oh, you'll swing all
right. A man with nothing against him has a chance; with the
rhino he has it, even if he's guilty. But you'll <i>swing</i>.
Charlie, who brought you back just now, had a chat with the
'Torney-General's devil's clerk's clerk, while old Nog o' Bow
Street was trying to read their Spanish. He says it's a Gov'nment
matter. They wants to hang you bad, they do, so's to go to the
Jacky Spaniards and say, 'He were a nob, a nobby nob.' (So you
are, aren't you? One uncle an earl and t'other a dean, if so be
what they say's true.) 'He were a nobby nob and we swung 'im. Go
you'n do likewise.' They want a striking example t' keep the West
India trade quiet..." He wiped his forehead and moved my water
jug of red earth on the dirty deal table under the window, for
all the world like a host in front of a guest. "They means you to
swing," he said. "They've silenced the Thames Court reporters.
Not a noospaper will publish a correct report t'morrer. And you
haven't see nobody, nor you won't, not if I can help it."</p>
<p>He broke off and looked at me with an expression of
candour.</p>
<p>"Mind you," he said, "I'm not uffish. To 'n ornery
gentleman&mdash;of the road or what you will&mdash;I'm not, if so
be he's the necessary. I'd take a letter like another. But for
you, no&mdash;fear. Not that I've my knife into you. What I can
do to make you comfor'ble I will do, <i>both</i> now an'
hereafter. But when I gets the wink, I looks after my skin. So'd
any man. You don't see nobody, nor you won't; nor your nobby
relations won't have the word. Till the Hadmir'lty trile. Charlie
says it's unconstitutional, you ought to see your 'torney, if
you've one, or your father's got one. But Lor', I says, 'Charlie,
if they wants it they gets it. This ain't no <i>habeas
carpis</i>, give-the-man-a-chance case. It's the Hadmir'lty. And
not a man tried for piracy this thirty year. See what a show it
gives them, what bloody Radicle knows or keeres what the
perceedin's should be? Who's a-goin' t' make a question out of
it? Go away,' says I to Charlie. And that's it straight."</p>
<p>He went towards the door, then turned.</p>
<p>"You should be in the Marshalsea common yard; even I knows
that. But they've the wink there. 'Too full,' says they. Too full
be d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d. I've know'd the time&mdash;after the
Vansdell smash it were&mdash;when they found room for three
hundred more improvident debtors over and above what they're
charted for. Too full! Their common yard! They don't want you to
speak to a soul, an' you won't till this day week, when the
Hadmir'lty Session is in full swing." He went out and locked the
door, snorting, "Too full at the Marshalsea!...Go away!"</p>
<p>"Find out about the <i>Lion</i>," I called, as the door
closed.</p>
<p>It cleared the air for me, that speech. I understood that they
wanted to hang me, and I wanted not to be hung, desperately, from
that moment. I had not much cared before; I had&mdash;call it,
moped. I had not really believed, really sensed it out. It isn't
easy to conceive that one is going to be hanged, I doubt if one
does even with the rope round one's neck. I hadn't much wanted to
live, but now I wanted to fight&mdash;one good fight before I
went under for good and all, condemned or acquitted. There wasn't
anything left for me to live for, Seraphina could not be alive.
The <i>Lion</i> must have been lost.</p>
<p>But I was going to make a fight for it; curse it, I was going
to give them trouble. My "them" was not so much the Government
that meant to hang me as the unseen powers that suffered such a
state of things, that allowed a number of little meannesses,
accidents, fatalities, to hang me. I began to worry the turnkey.
He gave me no help, only shreds of information that let me see
more plainly than ever how set "they" were on sacrificing me to
their exigencies.</p>
<p>The whole West Indian trade in London was in an uproar over
the Pirate Question and over the Slave Question. Jamaica was
still squealing for Separation before the premonitory grumbles of
Abolition. Horton Pen, over there, came back with astonishing
clearness before me. I seemed to hear old, wall-eyed,
sandy-headed Macdonald, agitating his immense bulk of ill-fitting
white clothes in front of his newspaper, and bellowing in his
ox-voice:</p>
<p>"Abolition, they give us Abolition...or ram it down our
throats. <i>They</i> who haven't even the spunk to rid us o' the
d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d pirates, not the spunk to catch and hang
one...Jock, me lahd, we's abolush them before they sail touch our
neegurs...Let them clear oor seas, let them hang <i>one</i>
pirate, and then talk."</p>
<p>I was the one they were going to hang, to consolidate the bond
with the old island. The cement wanted a little blood in the
mixing. Damn them! I was going to make a fight; they had torn me
from Seraphina, to fulfill their own accursed ends. I felt myself
grow harsh and strong, as a tree feels itself grow gnarled by
winter storms. I said to the turnkey again and again:</p>
<p>"Man, I will promise you a thousand pounds or a pension for
life, if you will get a letter through to my mother or Squire
Rooksby of Horton."</p>
<p>He said he daren't do it; enough was known of him to hang him
if he gave offence. His flabby fingers trembled, and his eyes
grew large with successive shocks of cupidity. He became afraid
of coming near me; of the strain of the temptation. On the next
day he did not speak a word, nor the next, nor the next. I began
to grow horribly afraid of being hung. The day before the trial
arrived. Towards noon he flung the door open.</p>
<p>"Here's paper, here's pens," he said. "You can prepare your
defence. You may write letters. Oh, hell! why did not they let it
come sooner, I'd have had your thousand pounds. I'll run a letter
down to your people fast as the devil could take it. I know a
man, a gentleman of the road. For twenty pun promised, split
between us, he'll travel faster'n Turpin did to York." He was
waving a large sheet of newspaper agitatedly.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" I asked. My head was whirling.</p>
<p>"Radical papers got a-holt of it," he said. "Trust them for
nosing out. And the Government's answering them. They say you're
going to suffer for your crimes. Hark to this...um, um...'The
wretched felon now in Newgate will incur the just penalty...'
Then they slaps the West Indies in the face. 'When the planters
threaten to recur to some other power for protection, they, of
course, believe that the loss of the colonies would be severely
felt. But...'"</p>
<p>"The <i>Lion's</i> home," I said.</p>
<p>It burst upon me that she was&mdash;that she must be.
Williams&mdash;or Sebright&mdash;he was the man, had been
speaking up for me. Or Seraphina had been to the Spanish
ambassador.</p>
<p>She was back; I should see her. I started up.</p>
<p>"The <i>Lion's</i> home," I repeated.</p>
<p>The turnkey snarled, "She was posted as overdue three days
ago."</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it was true.</p>
<p>"I saw it in the papers," he grumbled on. "I dursn't tell
you." He continued violently, "Blow my dickey. It would make a
cat sick."</p>
<p>My sudden exaltation, my sudden despair, gave way to
indifference.</p>
<p>"Oh, coming, coming!" he shouted, in answer to an immense
bellowing cry that loomed down the passage without.</p>
<p>I heard him grumble, "Of course, of course. I shan't make a
penny." Then he caught hold of my arm. "Here, come along, someone
to see you in the press-yard."</p>
<p>He pulled me along the noisome, black warren of passages,
slamming the inner door viciously behind him.</p>
<p>The press-yard&mdash;the exercising ground for the
condemned&mdash;was empty; the last batch had gone out, <i>my</i>
batch would be the next to come in, the turnkey said suddenly. It
was a well of a place, high black walls going up into the
desolate, weeping sky, and quite tiny. At one end was a sort of
slit in the wall, closed with tall, immense windows. From there a
faint sort of rabbit's squeak was going up through the immense
roll and rumble of traffic on the other side of the wall. The
turnkey pushed me towards it.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said. "I'll not listen; I ought to. But, curse me,
I'm not a bad sort," he added gloomily; "I dare say you'll make
it worth my while."</p>
<p>I went and peered through the bars at a faint object pressed
against other bars in just another slit across a black
passage.</p>
<p>"What, Jackie, boy; what, Jackie?" Blinking his eyes, as if
the dim light were too strong for them, a thin, bent man stood
there in a brilliant new court coat. His face was meagre in the
extreme, the nose and cheekbones polished and transparent like a
bigaroon cherry. A thin tuft of reddish hair was brushed back
from his high, shining forehead. It was my father. He
exclaimed:</p>
<p>"What, Jackie, boy! How old you look!" then waved his arm
towards me. "In trouble?" he said. "You in trouble?"</p>
<p>He rubbed his thin hands together, and looked round the place
with a cultured man's air of disgust. I said, "Father!" and he
suddenly began to talk very fast and agitatedly of what he had
been doing for me. My mother, he said, was crippled with
rheumatism, and Rooksby and Veronica on the preceding Thursday
had set sail for Jamaica. He had read to my mother, beside her
bed, the newspaper containing an account of my case; and she had
given him money, and he had started with violent haste for
London. The haste and the rush were still dazing him. He had
lived down there in the farmhouse beneath the downs, with the
stackyards under his eyes, with his books of verse and his few
prints on the wall&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;My God, how it all came
back to me.</p>
<p>In his disjointed speeches, I could see how exactly the same
it all remained. The same old surly man with a squint had driven
him along the muddy roads in the same ancient gig, past the bare
elms, to meet the coach. And my father had never been in London
since he had walked the streets with the Prince Regent's
friends.</p>
<p>Whilst he talked to me there, lines of verse kept coming to
his lips; and, after the habitual pleasure of the apt quotation,
he felt acutely shocked at the inappropriateness of the place,
the press-yard, with the dim light weeping downwards between
immensely high walls, and the desultory snowflakes that dropped
between us. And he had tried so hard, in his emergency, to be
practical. When he had reached London, before even attempting to
see me, he had run from minister to minister trying to influence
them in my favour&mdash;and he reached me in Newgate with nothing
at all effected.</p>
<p>I seemed to know him then, so intimately, so much better than
anything else in the world.</p>
<p>He began, "I had my idea in the up-coach last night. I
thought, 'A very great personage was indebted to me in the old
days (more indebted than you are aware of, Johnnie). I will
intercede with him.' That was why my first step was to my old
tailor's in Conduit Street. Because...what is fit for a farm for
a palace were low." He stopped, reflected, then said, "What is
fit for <i>the</i> farm for <i>the</i> palace were low."</p>
<p>He felt across his coat for his breast pocket. It was what he
had done years and years ago, and all these years between,
inscribe ideas for lines of verse in his pocket-book. I said:</p>
<p>"You have seen the king?"</p>
<p>His face lengthened a little. "Not <i>seen</i> him. But I
found one of the duke's secretaries, a pleasant young
fellow...not such as we used to be. But the duke was kind enough
to interest himself. Perhaps my name has lived in the land. I was
called Curricle Kemp, as I may have told you, because I drove a
vermilion one with green and gilt wheels..."</p>
<p>His face, peering at me through the bars, had, for a moment, a
flush of pride. Then he suddenly remembered, and, as if to
propitiate his own reproof, he went on:</p>
<p>"I saw the Secretary of State, and he assured me, very
civilly, that not even the highest personage in the land..." He
dropped his voice, "Jackie, boy," he said, his narrow-lidded eyes
peering miserably across at me, "there's not even hope of a
reprieve afterwards."</p>
<p>I leaned my face wearily against the iron bars. What, after
all, was the use of fighting if the <i>Lion</i> were not
back?</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, as the sound of his words echoed down the
bare, black corridors, he seemed to realize the horror of it. His
face grew absolutely white, he held his head erect, as if
listening to a distant sound. And then he began to
cry&mdash;horribly, and for a long time.</p>
<p>It was I that had to comfort him. His head had bowed at the
conviction of his hopeless uselessness; all through his own life
he had been made ineffectual by his indulgence in perfectly
innocent, perfectly trivial enjoyments, and now, in this
extremity of his only son, he was rendered almost fantastically
of no avail.</p>
<p>"No, no, sir! You have done all that any one could; you
couldn't break these walls down. Nothing else would help."</p>
<p>Small, hopeless sobs shook him continually. His thin, delicate
white fingers gripped the black grille, with the convulsive grasp
of a very weak man. It was more distressing to me than anything I
had ever seen or felt. The mere desire, the intense desire to
comfort him, made me get a grip upon myself again. And I
remembered that, now that I could communicate with the outer air,
it was absolutely easy; he would save my life. I said:</p>
<p>"You have only to go to Clapham, sir."</p>
<p>And the moment I was in a state to command him, to direct him,
to give him something to do, he became a changed man. He looked
up and listened. I told him to go to Major Cowper's. It would be
easy enough to find him at Clapham. Cowper, I remembered, could
testify to my having been seized by Tomas Castro. He had seen me
fight on the decks. And what was more, he would certainly know
the addresses of Kingston planters, if any were in London. They
could testify that I had been in Jamaica all the while Nikola el
Escoces was in Rio Medio. I knew there were some. My father was
fidgeting to be gone. He had his name marked for him, and a will
directing his own. He was not the same man. But I particularly
told him to send me a lawyer first of all.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" he said, fidgeting to go, "to Major Cowper's. Let
me write his address."</p>
<p>"And a solicitor," I said. "Send him to me on your way
there."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," he said, "I shall be able to be of use to the
solicitor. As a rule, they are men of no great perspicacity."</p>
<p>And he went hurriedly away.</p>
<p>The real torture, the agony of suspense began then. I steadied
my nerves by trying to draw up notes for my speech to the jury on
the morrow. That was the turnkey's idea.</p>
<p>He said, "Slap your chest, 'peal to the honour of a British
gent, and pitch it in strong."</p>
<p>It was not much good; I could not keep to any logical sequence
of thought, my mind was forever wandering to what my father was
doing. I pictured him in his new blue coat, running agitatedly
through crowded streets, his coat-tails flying behind his thin
legs. The hours dragged on, and it was a matter of minutes. I had
to hold upon the table edge to keep myself from raging about the
cell. I tried to bury myself again in the scheme for my defence.
I wondered whom my father would have found. There was a man
called Cary who had gone home from Kingston. He had a bald head
and blue eyes; he must remember me. If he would corroborate! And
the lawyer, when he came, might take another line of defence. It
began to fall dusk slowly, through the small barred windows.</p>
<p>The entire night passed without a word from my father. I paced
up and down the whole time, composing speeches to the jury. And
then the day broke. I calmed myself with a sort of frantic
energy.</p>
<p>Early the jailer came in, and began fussing about my cell.</p>
<p>"Case comes on about one," he said. "Grand jury at half after
twelve. No fear they won't return a true bill. Grand jury, five
West India merchants. They means to have you. 'Torney-General,
S'lic'tor-General. S'r Robert Mead, and five juniors agin
you...You take my tip. Throw yourself on the mercy of the court,
and make a rousing speech with a young 'ooman in it. Not that
you'll get much mercy from them. They Admir'lty jedges is all
hangers. 'S we say, 'Oncet the anchor goes up in the Old Bailey,
there ain't no hope. We begins to clean out the c'ndemned cell,
here. Sticks the anchor up over their heads, when it is
Hadmir'lty case,'" he commented.</p>
<p>I listened to him with strained attention. I made up my mind
to miss not a word uttered that day. It was my only chance.</p>
<p>"You don't know any one from Jamaica?" I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his bullet head, and tapped his purple nose. "Can't
be done," he said. "You'd get a ornery hallybi fer a guinea a
head, but they'd keep out of this case. They've necks like you
and me."</p>
<p>Whilst he was speaking, the whole of the outer world, as far
as it affected me, came suddenly in upon me&mdash;that was what I
meant to the great city that lay all round, the world, in the
centre of which was my cell. To the great mass, I was matter for
a sensation; to them I might prove myself beneficial in this
business. Perhaps there were others who were thinking I might be
useful in one way or another. There were the ministers of the
Crown, who did not care much whether Jamaica separated or not.
But they wanted to hang me because they would be able to say
disdainfully to the planters, "Separate if you like; we've done
our duty, we've hanged a man."</p>
<p>All those people had their eyes on me, and they were about the
only ones who knew of my existence. That was the end of my
Romance! Romance! The broadsheet sellers would see to it
afterwards with a "Dying confession." <a name="2HCH0033">

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>I never saw my father again until I was in the prisoner's
anteroom at the Old Bailey. It was full of lounging men, whose
fleshy limbs bulged out against the tight, loud checks of their
coats and trousers. These were jailers waiting to bring in their
prisoners. On the other side of one black door the Grand Jury was
deliberating on my case, behind another the court was in waiting
to try me. I was in a sort of tired lull. All night I had been
pacing up and down, trying to bring my brain to think of
points&mdash;points in my defence. It was very difficult. I knew
that I must keep cool, be calm, be lucid, be convincing; and my
brain had reeled at times, even in the darkness of the cell. I
knew it had reeled, because I remembered that once I had fallen
against the stone of one of the walls, and once against the door.
Here, in the light, with only a door between myself and the last
scene, I regained my hold. I was going to fight every inch from
start to finish. I was going to let no chink of their armour go
untried. I was going to make a good fight. My teeth chattered
like castanets, jarring in my jaws until it was painful. But that
was only with the cold.</p>
<p>A hubbub of expostulation was going on at the third door. My
turnkey called suddenly:</p>
<p>"Let the genman in, Charlie. Pal o' ourn," and my father ran
huntedly into the room. He began an endless tale of a hackney
coachman who had stood in front of the door of his coach to
prevent his number being taken; of a crowd of caddee-smashers,
who had hustled him and filched his purse. "Of course, I made a
fight for it," he said, "a damn good fight, considering. It's in
the blood. But the watch came, and, in short&mdash;on such an
occasion as this there is no time for words&mdash;I passed the
night in the watch-house. Many and many a night I passed there
when I and Lord&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But I am losing time."</p>
<p>"You ain't fit to walk the streets of London alone, sir," the
turnkey said.</p>
<p>My father gave him a corner of his narrow-lidded eyes. "My
man," he said, "I walked the streets with the highest in the land
before your mother bore you in Bridewell, or whatever jail it
was."</p>
<p>"Oh, no offence," the turnkey muttered.</p>
<p>I said, "Did you find Cowper, sir? Will he give evidence?"</p>
<p>"Jackie," he said agitatedly, as if he were afraid of
offending me, "he said you had filched his wife's rings."</p>
<p>That, in fact, was what Major Cowper <i>had</i>
said&mdash;that I had dropped into their ship near Port Royal
Heads, and had afterwards gone away with the pirates who had
filched his wife's rings. My father, in his indignation, had not
even deigned to ask him for the address of Jamaica planters in
London; and on his way back to find a solicitor he had come into
contact with those street rowdies and the watch. He had only just
come from before the magistrates.</p>
<p>A man with one eye poked his head suddenly from behind the
Grand Jury door. He jerked his head in my direction.</p>
<p>"True bill against that 'ere," he said, then drew his head in
again.</p>
<p>"Jackie, boy," my father said, putting a thin hand on my
wrist, and gazing imploringly into my eyes, "I'm...I'm...I can't
tell you how..."</p>
<p>I said, "It doesn't matter, father." I felt a foretaste of how
my past would rise up to crush me. Cowper had let that wife of
his coerce him into swearing my life away. I remembered vividly
his blubbering protestations of friendship when I persuaded Tomas
Castro to return him his black deed-box with the brass handle, on
that deck littered with rubbish..."Oh, God bless you, God bless
you. You have saved me from starvation..." There had been tears
in his old blue eyes. "If you need it I will go anywhere...do
anything to help you. On the honour of a gentleman and a
soldier." I had, of course, recommended his wife to give up her
rings when the pirates were threatening her in the cabin. The
other door opened, another man said:</p>
<p>"Now, then, in with that carrion. D'you want to keep the
judges waiting?"</p>
<p>I stepped through the door straight down into the dock; there
was a row of spikes in the front of it. I wasn't afraid; three
men in enormous wigs and ermine robes faced me; four in short
wigs had their heads together like parrots on a branch. A fat
man, bareheaded, with a gilt chain round his neck, slipped from
behind into a seat beside the highest placed judge. He was wiping
his mouth and munching with his jaws. On each side of the judges,
beyond the short-wigged assessors, were chairs full of ladies and
gentlemen. They all had their eyes upon me. I saw it all very
plainly. I was going to see everything, to keep my eyes open, not
to let any chance escape. I wondered why a young girl with blue
eyes and pink cheeks tittered and shrugged her shoulders. I did
not know what was amusing. What astonished me was the smallness,
the dirt, the want of dignity of the room itself. I thought they
must be trying a case of my importance there by mistake.</p>
<p>Presently I noticed a great gilt anchor above the judges'
heads. I wondered why it was there, until I remembered it was an
Admiralty Court. I thought suddenly, "Ah! if I had thought to
tell my father to go and see if the <i>Lion</i> had come in in
the night!"</p>
<p>A man was bawling out a number of names..."Peter Plimley,
gent., any challenge...Lazarus Cohen, merchant, any
challenge..."</p>
<p>The turnkey beside me leant with his back against the spikes.
He was talking to the man who had called us in.</p>
<p>"Lazarus Cohen, West Indian merchant...Lord, well, I'd
challenge..."</p>
<p>The other man said, "S&mdash;sh."</p>
<p>"His old dad give me five shiners to put him up to a thing if
I could," the turnkey said again.</p>
<p>I didn't catch his meaning until an old man with a very ragged
gown was handing up a book to a row of others in a box so near
that I could almost have touched them. Then I realized that the
turnkey had been winking to me to challenge the jury. I called
out at the highest of the judges:</p>
<p>"I protest against that jury. It is packed. Half of them, at
least, are West Indian merchants."</p>
<p>There was a stir all over the court. I realized then that what
had seemed only a mass of stuffs of some sort were human beings
all looking at me. The judge I had called to opened a pair of dim
eyes upon me, clasped and unclasped his hands, very dry, ancient,
wrinkled. The judge on his right called angrily:</p>
<p>"Nonsense, it is too late...They are being sworn. You should
have spoken when the names were read." Underneath his wig was an
immensely broad face with glaring yellow eyes.</p>
<p>I said, "It is scandalous. You want to murder me, How should I
know what you do in your courts? I say the jury is packed."</p>
<p>The very old judge closed his eyes, opened them again, then
gasped out:</p>
<p>"Silence. We are here to try you. This is a court of law."</p>
<p>The turnkey pulled my sleeve under cover of the planking.
"Treat him civil," he whispered, "Lord Justice Stowell of the
Hadmir'lty. 'Tother's Baron Garrow of the Common Law; a beast;
him as hanged that kid. You can sass him; it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>Lord Stowell waved his hand to the clerk with the ragged gown;
the book passed from hand to hand along the faces of the jury,
the clerk gabbling all the while. The old judge said suddenly, in
an astonishingly deep, majestic voice:</p>
<p>"Prisoner at the bar, you must understand that we are here to
give you an impartial trial according to the laws of this land.
If you desire advice as to the procedure of this court you can
have it."</p>
<p>I said, "I still protest against that Jury. I am an innocent
man, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He answered querulously, "Yes, yes, afterwards." And then
creaked, "Now the indictment..."</p>
<p>Someone hidden from me by three barristers began to read in a
loud voice not very easy to follow. I caught:</p>
<p>"For that the said John Kemp, alias Nichols, alias Nikola el
Escoces, alias el Demonio, alias el Diabletto, on the twelfth of
May last, did feloniously and upon the high seas piratically
seize a certain ship called the <i>Victoria</i>...um...um, the
properties of Hyman Cohen and others...and did steal and take
therefrom six hundred and thirty barrels of coffee of the value
of...um...um...um...one hundred and one barrels of coffee of the
value of...ninety-four half kegs...and divers others..."</p>
<p>I gave an immense sigh...That was it, then. I had heard of the
<i>Victoria</i>; it was when I was at Horton that the news of her
loss reached us. Old Macdonald had sworn; it was the day a negro
called Apollo had taken to the bush. I ought to be able to prove
that. Afterwards, one of the judges asked me if I pleaded guilty
or not guilty. I began a long wrangle about being John Kemp but
not Nikola el Escoces. I was going to fight every inch of the
way. They said:</p>
<p>"You will have your say afterwards. At present, guilty or not
guilty?"</p>
<p>I refused to plead at all; I was not the man. The third judge
woke up, and said hurriedly:</p>
<p>"That is a plea of not guilty, enter it as such." Then he went
to sleep again. The young girl on the bench beside him laughed
joyously, and Mr. Baron Garrow nodded round at her, then snapped
viciously at me:</p>
<p>"You don't make your case any better by this sort of foolery."
His eyes glared at me like an awakened owl's.</p>
<p>I said, "I'm fighting for my neck...and you'll have to fight,
too, to get it."</p>
<p>The old judge said angrily, "Silence, or you will have to be
removed."</p>
<p>I said, "I am fighting for my life."</p>
<p>There was a sort of buzz all round the court.</p>
<p>Lord Stowell said, "Yes, yes;" and then, "Now, Mr. King's
Advocate, I suppose Mr. Alfonso Jervis opens for you."</p>
<p>A dusty wig swam up from just below my left hand, almost to a
level with the dock.</p>
<p>The old judge shut his eyes, with an air of a man who
<i>is</i> going a long journey in a post-chaise. Mr. Baron Garrow
dipped his pen into an invisible ink-pot, and scratched it on his
desk. A long story began to drone from under the wig, an
interminable farrago of dull nonsense, in a hypochondriacal
voice; a long tale about piracy in general; piracy in the times
of the Greeks, piracy in the times of William the Conqueror...
<i>pirata nequissima Eustachio</i>, and thanking God that a case
of the sort had not been heard in that court for an immense lapse
of years. Below me was an array of wigs, on each side a
compressed mass of humanity, squeezed so tight that all the
eyeballs seemed to be starting out of the heads towards me. From
the wig below, a translation of the florid phrases of the Spanish
papers was coming:</p>
<p>"His very Catholic Majesty, out of his great love for his
ancient friend and ally, his Britannic Majesty, did surrender the
body of the notorious El Demonio, called also..."</p>
<p>I began to wonder who had composed that precious document,
whether it was the <i>Juez de la Primera Instancia</i>, bending
his yellow face and sloe-black eyes above the paper, over there
in Havana&mdash;or whether it was O'Brien, who was dead since the
writing.</p>
<p>All the while the barrister was droning on. I did not listen
because I had heard all that before&mdash;in the room of the
Judge of the First Instance at Havana. Suddenly appearing behind
the backs of the row of gentlefolk on the bench was the pale,
thin face of my father. I wondered which of his great friends had
got him his seat. He was nodding to me and smiling faintly. I
nodded, too, and smiled back. I was going to show them that I was
not cowed. The voice of the barrister said:</p>
<p>"M'luds and gentlemen of the jury, that finishes the Spanish
evidence, which was taken on commission on the island of Cuba. We
shall produce the officer of H. M. S. Elephant, to whom he was
surrendered by the Spanish authorities at Havana, thus proving
the prisoner to be the pirate Nikola, and no other. We come, now,
to the specific instance, m'luds and gentlemen, an instance as
vile..."</p>
<p>It was some little time before I had grasped how absolutely
the Spanish evidence damned me. It was as if, once I fell into
the hands of the English officer on Havana quays, the identity of
Nikola could by no manner of means be shaken from round my neck.
The barrister came to the facts.</p>
<p>A Kingston ship had been boarded...and there was the old story
over again. I seemed to see the Rio Medio schooner rushing
towards where I and old Cowper and old Lumsden looked back from
the poop to see her come alongside; the strings of brown pirates
pour in empty-handed, and out laden. Only in the case of the
<i>Victoria</i> there were added the ferocities of "the prisoner
at the bar, m'luds and gentlemen of the jury, a fiend in human
shape, as we shall prove with the aid of the most respectable
witnesses..."</p>
<p>The man in the wig sat down, and, before I understood what was
happening, a fat, rosy man&mdash;the Attorney-General&mdash;whose
cheerful gills gave him a grotesque resemblance to a sucking pig,
was calling "Edward Sadler," and the name blared like sudden fire
leaping up all over the court. The Attorney-General wagged his
gown into a kind of bunch behind his hips, and a man, young,
fair, with a reddish beard and a shiny suit of clothes, sprang
into a little box facing the jury. He bowed nervously in several
directions, and laughed gently; then he looked at me and scowled.
The Attorney-General cleared his throat pleasantly...</p>
<p>"Mr. Edward Sadler, you were, on May 25th, chief mate of the
good ship <i>Victoria...</i>"</p>
<p>The fair man with the beard told his story, the old story of
the ship with its cargo of coffee and dye-wood; its good passage
past the Gran Caymanos; the becalming off the Cuban shore in
latitude so and so, and the boarding of a black schooner, calling
itself a Mexican privateer. I could see all that.</p>
<p>"The prisoner at the bar came alongside in a boat, with
seventeen Spaniards," he said, in a clear, expressionless voice,
looking me full in the face.</p>
<p>I called out to the old judge, "My Lord...I protest. This is
perjury. I was not the man. It Was Nichols, a Nova Scotian."</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Garrow roared, "Silence," his face suffused with
blood.</p>
<p>Old Lord Stowell quavered, "You must respect the
procedure..."</p>
<p>"Am I to hear my life sworn away without a word?" I asked.</p>
<p>He drew himself frostily into his robes. "God forbid," he
said; "but at the proper time you can cross-examine, if you think
fit."</p>
<p>The Attorney-General smiled at the jury-box and addressed
himself to Sadler, with an air of patience very much tried:</p>
<p>"You swear the prisoner is the man?"</p>
<p>The fair man turned his sharp eyes upon me. I called, "For
God's sake, don't perjure yourself. You are a decent man."</p>
<p>"No, I won't swear," he said slowly. "I think he was. He had
his face blacked then, of course. When I had sight of him at the
Thames Court I thought he was; and seeing the Spanish evidence, I
don't see where's the room..."</p>
<p>"The Spanish evidence is part of the plot," I said.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General snickered. "Go on, Mr. Sadler," he said.
"Let's have the rest of the plot unfolded."</p>
<p>A juryman laughed suddenly, and resumed an abashed sudden
silence. Sadler went on to tell the old story...I saw it all as
he spoke; only gaunt, shiny-faced, yellow Nichols was chewing and
hitching his trousers in place of my Tomas, with his sanguine
oaths and jerked gestures. And there was Nichol's wanton, aimless
ferocity.</p>
<p>"He had two pistols, which he fired twice each, while we were
hoisting the studding-sails by his order, to keep up with the
schooner. He fired twice into the crew. One of the men hit died
afterwards..."</p>
<p>Later, another vessel, an American, had appeared in the
offing, and the pirates had gone in chase of her. He finished,
and Lord Stowell moved one of his ancient hands. It was as if a
gray lizard had moved on his desk, a little toward me.</p>
<p>"Now, prisoner," he said.</p>
<p>I drew a deep breath. I thought for a minute that, after all,
there was a little fair play in the game&mdash;that I had a
decent, fair, blue-eyed man in front of me. He looked hard at me;
I hard at him; it was as if we were going to wrestle for a belt.
The young girl on the bench had her lips parted and leant
forward, her head a little on one side.</p>
<p>I said, "You won't swear I was the man...Nikola el
Escoces?"</p>
<p>He looked meditatively into my eyes; it was a duel between
us.</p>
<p>"I won't swear," he said. "You had your face blacked, and
didn't wear a beard."</p>
<p>A soft growth of hair had come out over my cheeks whilst I lay
in prison. I rubbed my hand against it, and thought that he had
drawn first blood.</p>
<p>"You must not say 'you,'" I said. "I swear I was not the man.
Did he talk like me?"</p>
<p>"Can't say that he did," Sadler answered, moving from one foot
to the other.</p>
<p>"Had he got eyes like me, or a nose, or a mouth?"</p>
<p>"Can't say," he answered again. "His face was blacked."</p>
<p>"Didn't he talk Blue Nose&mdash;in the Nova Scotian way?"</p>
<p>"Well, he did," Sadler assented slowly. "But any one could for
a disguise. It's as easy as..."</p>
<p>Beside me, the turnkey whispered suddenly, "Pull him up; stop
his mouth."</p>
<p>I said, "Wasn't he an older man? Didn't he look between forty
and fifty?"</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> look like?" the chief mate asked.</p>
<p>"I'm twenty-four," I answered; "I can prove it."</p>
<p>"Well, you look forty and older," he answered negligently. "So
did he."</p>
<p>His cool, disinterested manner overwhelmed me like the blow of
an immense wave; it proved so absolutely that I had parted with
all semblance of youth. It was something added to the immense
waste of waters between myself and Seraphina; an immense waste of
years. I did not ask much of the next witness; Sadler had made me
afraid. Septimus Hearn, the master of the <i>Victoria</i>, was a
man with eyes as blue and as cold as bits of round blue pebble; a
little goat's beard, iron-gray; apple-coloured cheeks, and small
gold earrings in his ears. He had an extraordinarily mournful
voice, and a retrospective melancholy of manner. He was just such
another master of a trader as Captain Lumsden had been, and it
was the same story over again, with little different touches, the
hard blue eyes gazing far over the top of my head; the gnarled
hands moving restlessly on the rim of his hat.</p>
<p>"Afterwards the prisoner ordered the steward to give us a
drink of brandy. A glass was offered me, but I refused to drink
it, and he said, 'Who is it that refuses to drink a glass of
brandy?' He asked me what countryman I was, and if I was an
American."</p>
<p>There were two others from the unfortunate
<i>Victoria</i>&mdash;a Thomas Davis, boatswain, who had had one
of Nikola's pistol-balls in his hip; and a sort of
steward&mdash;I have forgotten his name&mdash;who had a scar of a
cutlass wound on his forehead.</p>
<p>It was horrible enough; but what distressed me more was that I
could not see what sort of impression I was making. Once the
judge who was generally asleep woke up and began to scratch
furiously with his quill; once three of the assessors&mdash;the
men in short wigs&mdash;began an animated conversation; one man
with a thin, dark face laughed noiselessly, showing teeth like a
white waterfall. A man in the body of the court on my left had an
enormous swelling, blood-red, and looking as if a touch must
burst it, under his chin; at one time he winked his eyes
furiously for a long time on end. It seemed to me that something
in the evidence must be affecting all these people. The turnkey
beside me said to his mate, "Twig old Justice Best making notes
in his stud-calendar," and suddenly the conviction forced itself
upon me that the whole thing, the long weary trial, the evidence,
the parade of fairness, was being gone through in a spirit of
mockery, as a mere formality; that the judges and the assessors,
and the man with the goitre took no interest whatever in my case.
It was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>A tiny, fair man, with pale hair oiled and rather long for
those days, and with green and red signet rings on fingers that
he was forever running through that hair, came mincingly into the
witness-box. He held for a long time what seemed to be an amiable
conversation with Sir Robert Gifford, a tall, portentous-looking
man, who had black beetling brows, like tufts of black horsehair
sticking in the crannies of a cliff. The conversation went like
this:</p>
<p>"You are the Hon. Thomas Oldham?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes."</p>
<p>"You know Kingston, Jamaica, very well?"</p>
<p>"I was there four years&mdash;two as the secretary to the
cabinet of his Grace the Duke of Manchester, two as civil
secretary to the admiral on the station."</p>
<p>"You saw the prisoner?"</p>
<p>"Yes, three times."</p>
<p>I drew an immense breath; I thought for a moment that they had
delivered themselves into my hands. The thing must prove of
itself that I had been in Jamaica, not in Rio Medio, through
those two years. My heart began to thump like a great solemn
drum, like Paul's bell when the king died&mdash;solemn,
insistent, dominating everything. The little man was giving an
account of the "'bawminable" state of confusion into which the
island's trade was thrown by the misdeeds of a pirate called
Nikola el Demonio.</p>
<p>"I assure you, my luds," he squeaked, turning suddenly to the
judges, "the island was wrought up into a pitch of...ah...almost
disloyalty. The...ah...planters were clamouring
for...ah...separation. And, to be sure, I trust you'll hang the
prisoner, for if you don't..."</p>
<p>Lord Stowell shivered, and said suddenly with haste, "Mr.
Oldham, address yourself to Sir Robert."</p>
<p>I was almost happy; the cloven hoof had peeped so damningly
out. The little man bowed briskly to the old judge, asked for a
chair, sat himself down, and arranged his coat-tails.</p>
<p>"As I was saying," he prattled on, "the trouble and the worry
that this man caused to His Grace, myself, and Admiral Rowley
were inconceivable. You have no idea, you...ah...can't conceive.
And no wonder, for, as it turned out, the island was simply
honeycombed by his spies and agents. You have no idea; people who
seemed most respectable, people we ourselves had dealings
with..."</p>
<p>He rattled on at immense length, the barrister taking huge
pinches of yellow snuff, and smiling genially with the air of a
horse-trainer watching a pony go faultlessly through difficult
tricks. Every now and then he flicked his whip.</p>
<p>"Mr. Oldham, you saw the prisoner three times. If it does not
overtax your memory pray tell us." And the little creature
pranced off in a new direction.</p>
<p>"Tax my memory! Gad, I like that. You remember a man who has
had your blood as near as could be, don't you?"</p>
<p>I had been looking at him eagerly, but my interest faded away
now. It was going to be the old confusing of my identity with
Nikola's. And yet I seemed to know the little beggar's falsetto;
it was a voice one does not forget.</p>
<p>"Remember!" he squeaked. "Gad, gentlemen of the jury, he came
as near as possible&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;You have no idea what a
ferocious devil it is."</p>
<p>I was wondering why on earth Nichols should have wanted to
kill such a little thing. Because it was obvious that it must
have been Nichols.</p>
<p>"As near as possible murdered myself and Admiral Rowley and a
Mr. Topnambo, a most enlightened and loyal...ah...inhabitant of
the island, on the steps of a public inn."</p>
<p>I had it then. It was the little man David Mac-donald had
rolled down the steps with, that night at the Ferry Inn on the
Spanish Town road.</p>
<p>"He was lying in wait for us with a gang of assassins. I was
stabbed on the upper lip. I lost so much blood...had to be
invalided...cannot think of horrible episode without
shuddering."</p>
<p>He had seen me then, and when Ramon ("a Spaniard who was
afterwards proved to be a spy of El Demonio's&mdash;of the
prisoner's. He was hung since") had driven me from the place of
execution after the hanging of the seven pirates; and he had come
into Ramon's store at the moment when Carlos ("a piratical devil
if ever there was one," the little man protested) had drawn me
into the back room, where Don Balthasar and O'Brien and Seraphina
sat waiting. The men who were employed to watch Ramon's had never
seen me leave again, and afterwards a secret tunnel was
discovered leading down to the quay.</p>
<p>"This, apparently, was the way by which the prisoner used to
arrive and quit the island secretly," he finished his evidence in
chief, and the beetle-browed, portly barrister sat down. I was
not so stupid but what I could see a little, even then, how the
most innocent events of my past were going to rise up and crush
me; but I was certain I could twist him into admitting the
goodness of my tale which hadn't yet been told. He knew I had
been in Jamaica, and, put what construction he liked on it, he
would have to admit it. I called out:</p>
<p>"Thank God, my turn's come at last!"</p>
<p>The faces of the Attorney-General, the King's Advocate, Sir
Robert Gifford, Mr. Lawes, Mr. Jervis, of all the seven counsel
that were arrayed to crush me, lengthened into simultaneous
grins, varying at the jury-box. But I didn't care; I grinned,
too. I was going to show them.</p>
<p>It was as if I flew at the throat of that little man. It
seemed to me that I must be able to crush a creature whose malice
was as obvious and as nugatory as the green and red rings that he
exhibited in his hair every few minutes. He wanted to show the
jury that he had rings; that he was a mincing swell; that I
hadn't and that I was a bloody pirate. I said:</p>
<p>"You know that during the whole two years Nichols was at Rio I
was an improver at Horton Pen with the Macdonalds, the agents of
my brother-in-law, Sir Ralph Rooksby. You must know these things.
You were one of the Duke of Manchester's spies."</p>
<p>We used to call the Duke's privy council that. "I certainly
know nothing of the sort," he said, folding his hands along the
edge of the witness-box, as if he had just thought of exhibiting
his rings in that manner. He was abominably cool. I said:</p>
<p>"You must have heard of me. The Topnambos knew me."</p>
<p>"The Topnambos used to talk of a blackguard with a name like
Kemp who kept himself mighty out of the way in the Vale."</p>
<p>"You knew I was on the island," I pinned him down.</p>
<p>"You used to <i>come</i> to the island," he corrected. "I've
just explained how. But you were not there much, or we should
have been able to lay hands on you. We wanted to. There was a
warrant out after you tried to murder us. But you had been
smuggled away by Ramon."</p>
<p>I tried again:</p>
<p>"You have heard of my brother-in-law, Sir Ralph Rooksby?"</p>
<p>I wanted to show that, if I hadn't rings, I had relations.</p>
<p>"Nevah heard of the man in my life," he said.</p>
<p>"He was the largest land proprietor on the island," I
said.</p>
<p>"Dessay," he said; "I knew forty of the largest. Mostly
sharpers in the boosing-kens." He yawned.</p>
<p>I said viciously:</p>
<p>"It was your place to know the island. You knew Horton
Pen&mdash;the Macdonalds?"</p>
<p>The face of jolly old Mrs. Mac. came to my mind&mdash;the
impeccable, Scotch, sober respectability.</p>
<p>"Oh, I knew the Macdonalds," he said&mdash;"<i>of</i> them.
The uncle was a damn rebellious, canting, planting Scotchman.
Horton Pen was the centre of the Separation Movement. We could
have hung <i>him</i> if we'd wanted to. The nephew was the writer
of an odious blackmailing print. He calumniated all the decent,
loyal inhabitants. He was an agent of you pirates, too. We
arrested him&mdash;got his papers; know all about your relations
with him."</p>
<p>I said, "That's all nonsense. Let us hear"&mdash;the
Attorney-General had always said that&mdash;"what you know of
myself."</p>
<p>"What I know of you," he sniffed, "if it's a pleasuah, was
something like this. You came to the island in a mysterious way,
gave out that you were an earl's son, and tried to get into the
very excellent society of...ah...people like my friends, the
Topnambos. But they would not have you, and after that you kept
yourself mighty close; no one ever saw you but once or twice, and
then it was riding about at night with that humpbacked scoundrel
of a blackmailer.</p>
<p>"You, in fact, weren't on the island at all, except when you
came to spy for the pirates. You used to have long confabulations
with that scoundrel Ramon, who kept you posted about the
shipping. As for the blackmailer, with the humpback, David
Macdonald, you kept him, you... ah...subsidized his filthy print
to foment mutiny and murder among the black fellows, and preach
separation. You wanted to tie our hands, and prevent
our...ah...prosecuting the preventive measures against you. When
you found that it was no good you tried to murder the admiral and
myself, and that very excellent man Topnambo, coming from a ball.
After that you were seen encouraging seven of your...ah...pirate
fellows whom we were hanging, and you drove off in haste with
your agent, Ramon, before we could lay hands on you, and vanished
from the island."</p>
<p>I didn't lose my grip; I went at him again, blindly, as if I
were boxing with my eyes full of blood, but my teeth set tight. I
said:</p>
<p>"You used to buy things yourself of old Ramon; bought them for
the admiral to load his frigates with; things he sold at Key
West."</p>
<p>"That was one of the lies your scoundrel David Macdonald
circulated against us."</p>
<p>"You bought things...even whilst you were having his store
watched."</p>
<p>"Upon my soul!" he said.</p>
<p>"You used to buy things..." I pinned him. He looked suddenly
at the King's Advocate, then dropped his eyes.</p>
<p>"Nevah bought a thing in my life," he said.</p>
<p>I knew the man had; Ramon had told me of his buying for the
admiral more than three hundred barrels of damaged coffee for
thirty pounds. I was in a mad temper. I smashed my hand upon the
spikes of the rail in front of me, and although I saw hands move
impulsively towards me all over the court, I did not know that my
arm was impaled and the blood running down.</p>
<p>"Perjurer," I shouted, "Ramon himself told me."</p>
<p>"Ah, you were mighty thick with Ramon..." he said.</p>
<p>I let him stand down. I was done. Someone below said harshly,
"That closes our case, m'luds," and the court rustled all over.
Old Lord Stowell in front of me shivered a little, looked at the
window, and then said:</p>
<p>"Prisoner at the bar, our procedure has it that if you wish to
say anything, you may now address the jury. Afterwards, if you
had a counsel, he could call and examine your witnesses, if you
have any."</p>
<p>It was growing very dark in the court. I began to tell my
story; it was so plain, so evident, it shimmered there before
me...and yet I knew it was so useless.</p>
<p>I remembered that in my cell I had reasoned out that I must be
very constrained; very lucid about the opening. "On such and such
a day I landed at Kingston, to become an improver on the estate
of my brother-in-law. He is Sir Ralph Rooksby of Horton Priory in
Kent." I <i>did</i> keep cool; I <i>was</i> lucid; I spoke like
that. I had my eyes fixed on the face of the young girl upon the
bench. I remember it so well. Her eyes were fixed, fascinated,
upon my hand. I tried to move it, and found that it was stuck
upon the spike on which I had jammed it. I moved it carelessly
away, and only felt a little pain, as if from a pin-prick; but
the blood was dripping on to the floor, pat, pat. Later on, a man
lit the candles on the judge's desk, and the court looked
different. There were deep shadows everywhere; and the
illuminated face of Lord Stowell looked grimmer, less kind, more
ancient, more impossible to bring a ray of sympathy to. Down
below, the barristers of the prosecution leaned back with their
arms all folded, and the air of men resting in an interval of
cutting down a large tree. The barristers who were, merely
listeners looked at me from time to time. I heard one say, "That
man ought to have his hand bound up." I was telling the story of
my life, that was all I could do.</p>
<p>"As for Ramon, how could I know he was in the pay of the
pirates, even if he were? I swear I did not know. Everyone on the
island had dealings with him, the admiral himself. That is not
calumny. On my honour, the admiral did have dealings. Some of you
have had dealings with forgers, but that does not make you
forgers."</p>
<p>I warmed to it; I found words. I was telling the story for
that young girl. Suddenly I saw the white face of my father peep
at me between the head of an old man with an enormous nose, and a
stout lady in a brown cloak that had a number of little
watchmen's capes. He smiled suddenly, and nodded again and again,
opened his eyes, shut them; furtively waved a hand. It distracted
me, threw me off my balance, my coolness was gone. It was as if
something had snapped. After that I remembered very little; I
think I may have quoted "The Prisoner of Chillon," because he put
it into my head.</p>
<p>I seemed to be back again in Cuba. Down below me the
barristers were talking. The King's Advocate pulled out a
puce-coloured bandanna, and waved it abroad preparatorily to
blowing his nose. A cloud of the perfume of a West Indian bean
went up from it, sweet and warm. I had smelt it last at Rio, the
sensation was so strong that I could not tell where I was.</p>
<p>The candles made a yellow glow on the judge's desk; but it
seemed to be the blaze of light in the cell where Nichols and the
Cuban had fenced. I thought I was back in Cuba again. The people
in the court disappeared in the deepening shadows. At times I
could not speak. Then I would begin again.</p>
<p>If there were to be any possibility of saving my life, I had
to tell what I had been through&mdash;and to tell it
vividly&mdash;I had to narrate the story of my life; and my whole
life came into my mind. It was Seraphina who was the essence of
my life; who spoke with the voice of all Cuba, of all Spain, of
all Romance. I began to talk about old Don Balthasar Riego. I
began to talk about Manuel-del-Popolo, of his red shirt, his
black eyes, his mandolin; I saw again the light of his fires
flicker on the other side of the ravine in front of the cave.</p>
<p>And I rammed all that into my story, the story I was telling
to that young girl. I knew very well that I was carrying my
audience with me; I knew how to do it, I had it in the blood. The
old pale, faded, narrow-lidded father who was blinking and
nodding at me had been one of the best raconteurs that ever was.
I knew how. In the black shadows of the wall of the court I could
feel the eyes upon me; I could see the parted lips of the young
girl as she leaned further towards me. I knew it because, when
one of the barristers below raised his voice, someone hissed
"S&mdash;sh" from the shadows. And suddenly it came into my head,
that even if I did save my life by talking about these things, it
would be absolutely useless. I could never go back again; never
be the boy again; never hear the true voice of the Ever Faithful
Island. What did it matter even if I escaped; even if I could go
back? The sea would be there, the sky, the silent dim hills, the
listless surge; but <i>I</i> should never be there, I should be
altered for good and all. I should never see the breathless dawn
in the pondwater of Havana harbour, never be there with Seraphina
close beside me in the little <i>drogher</i>. All that remained
was to see this fight through, and then have done with fighting.
I remember the intense bitterness of that feeling and the oddity
of it all; of the one "I" that felt like that, of the other that
was raving in front of a lot of open-eyed idiots, three old
judges, and a young girl. And, in a queer way, the thoughts of
the one "I" floated through into the words of the other, that
seemed to be waving its hands in its final struggle, a little way
in front of me.</p>
<p>"Look at me...look at what they have made of me, one and the
other of them. I was an innocent boy. What am I now? They have
taken my life from me, let them finish it how they will, what
does it matter to me, what do I care?"</p>
<p>There was a rustle of motion all round the court. On board
Rowley's flagship the heavy irons had sawed open my wrists. I
hadn't been ironed in Newgate, but the things had healed up very
little. I happened to look down at my claws of hands with the
grime of blood that the dock spikes had caused.</p>
<p>"What sort of a premium is it that you set on sticking to the
right? Is this how you are going to encourage the others like me?
What do I care about your death? What's life to me? Let them get
their scaffold ready. I have suffered enough to be put out of my
misery. God, I have suffered enough with one and another. Look at
my hands, I say. Look at my wrists, and say if I care any more."
I held my ghastly paws high, and the candle light shone upon
them.</p>
<p>Out of the black shadows came shrieks of women and curses. I
saw my young girl put her hands over her face and slip slowly,
very slowly, from her chair, down out of sight. People were
staggering in different directions. I had had more to say, but I
forgot in my concern for the young girl. The turnkey pulled my
sleeve and said:</p>
<p>"I say, that ain't <i>true</i>, is it, it ain't <i>true?</i>"
Because he seemed not to want it to have been true, I glowed for
a moment with the immense pride of my achievement. I had made
them see things.</p>
<p>A minute after, I understood how futile it was. I was not a
fool even in my then half-mad condition. The real feeling of the
place came back upon me, the "Court of Law" of it. The King's
Advocate was whispering to the Attorney-General, he motioned with
his hand, first in my direction, then towards the jury; then they
both laughed and nodded. They knew the ropes too well for me, and
there were seven West India merchants up there who would remember
their pockets in a minute. But I didn't care. I had made them see
things. <a name="2HCH0034"><!--H2 anchor--></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>I had shot my bolt and I was going to die; I could see it in
the way the King's Advocate tossed his head back, fluttered his
bands, looked at the jury-box, and began to play with the seals
on his fob. The court had resumed its stillness. A man in some
sort of livery passed a square paper to the Lord Mayor, the Lord
Mayor passed it to Lord Stowell, who opened it with a jerking
motion of an ancient fashion that impressed me immensely. It was
as if I, there at the end of my life, were looking at a man
opening a letter of the reign of Queen Anne. The shadows of his
ancient, wrinkled face changed as he read, raising his eyebrows
and puckering his mouth. He handed the unfolded paper to Mr.
Baron Garrow, then with one wrinkled finger beckoned the
Attorney-General to him. The third judge was still asleep.</p>
<p>"What the devil's this?" the turnkey beside me said to his
companion.</p>
<p>I was in a good deal of pain, and felt sickly that every pulse
of my heart throbbed in my mangled hand. The other spat straight
in front of him.</p>
<p>"Damme if I know," he said. "This cursed business ought to
have been over and done with an hour agone. I told Jinks to have
my rarebit and noggin down by the gate-house fire at half-past
five, and it's six now."</p>
<p>They began an interminable argument under their breaths.</p>
<p>"It's that wager of Lord March's...run a mile, walk a mile,
eat five pounds of mutton, drink five pints of claret. No, it
ain't.. Medmenham coach ain't in yet...roads too heavy...It is.
What else would stop the Court at this time of night? It isn't,
or Justice Best 'd be awake and hedging his bets."</p>
<p>In a dizzy way I noted the Attorney-General making his way
carefully back between the benches to his knot of barristers, and
their wigs went all together in a bunch like ears of corn drawn
suddenly into a sheaf. The heads of the other barristers were
like unreaped ears. A man with a face like a weasel's called to a
man with a face like a devil's&mdash;he was leaving the
court&mdash;something about an ambassador. The other stopped,
turned, and deposited his bag again. I heard the deep voice of
Sir Robert Gifford say: "What!...Never!...too infamous..." and
then the interest and the light seemed to flicker out together. I
could hardly see. Voices called out to each other, harsh, dry, as
if their owners had breathed nothing but dust for years and
years.</p>
<p>One loud one barked, "You can't hear him, m'luds; in <i>Rex v.
Marsupenstein...</i>"</p>
<p>A lot began calling all together, "Ah, but that was different,
Mr. Attorney. You couldn't subpoena him, he being in the position
of <i>extra lege commune</i>. But if he offers a
statement..."</p>
<p>The candles seemed to be waving deliberately like elm-tops in
a high wind.</p>
<p>Someone called, "Clerk, fetch me volume xiii...I think we
shall find there...You recollect the case of <i>Hildeshein v.
Roe...</i> Wasn't it <i>Hildegaulen and another</i>, m'lud?"..."I
tried the case myself. The Prussian Plenipotentiary..."</p>
<p>I wanted to call out to them that it was not worth while to
try their dry throats any more; that having shot my bolt, I gave
in. But I could not think of any words, I was so tired. "I didn't
sleep at all last night," I found myself saying to myself.</p>
<p>The sleeping judge woke up suddenly and snarled, "Why in
Heaven's name don't we get on? We shall be all night. Let him
call the second name on the list. We can take the Spanish
ambassador when you have settled. For my part I think we ought to
hear him..."</p>
<p>Lord Stowell said suddenly, "Prisoner at the bar, some
gentlemen have volunteered statements on your behalf. If you wish
it, they can be called."</p>
<p>I didn't answer; I did not understand; I wanted to tell him I
did not care, because the <i>Lion</i> was posted as overdue and
Seraphina was drowned. The Court seemed to be moving slowly up
and down in front of me like the deck of a ship. I thought I was
bound again, and on the sofa in the gorgeous cabin of the
<i>Madre-de-Dios</i>. Someone seemed to be calling, "Prisoner at
the bar...Prisoner at the bar..." It was as if the candles had
been lit in front of the Madonna with the pink child, only she
had a gilt anchor instead of the spiky gilt glory above her head.
Somebody was saying, "Hello there...Hold up!...Here, bring a
chair,..." and there were arms around me. Afterwards I sat down.
A very old judge's voice said something rather kindly, I thought.
I knew it was the very old judge, because he was called the star
of Cuban law. Someone would be bending over me soon, with a
lanthorn, and I should be wiping the flour out of my eyes and
blinking at the red velvet and gilding of the cabin ceiling. In a
minute Carlos and Castro would come...or was it O'Brien who would
come? No, O'Brien was dead; stabbed, with a knife in his neck;
the blood was still sticky between my first and second fingers. I
could feel it. I ought to have been allowed to wash my hands
before I was tried; or was it before I spoke to the admiral? One
would not speak to a man with hands like that.</p>
<p>A loud, high-pitched voice called from up in the air, "I will
give any of you gentlemen of the robe down there fifty pounds to
conduct the remainder of the case for him. I am the prisoner's
father."</p>
<p>My father's voice broke the spell. I was in the court; the
candles were still burning; all the faces, lit up or in the
shadow, were bunched together in little groups; hands waved. The
barrister whose face was like the devil's under his wig held in
his hands the paper that had been handed to Lord Stowell; my
father was talking to him from the bench. The barrister, tall,
his robes old and ragged, silhouetted against the light, glanced
down the paper, fluttered it in his hand, nodded to my father,
and began a grotesque, nasal drawl:</p>
<p>"M'luds, I will conduct the case for the prisoner, if your
lordships will bear with me a little. He obviously can't call his
own witnesses. If he has been treated as he says, it has been one
of the most abominable..."</p>
<p>Old Lord Stowell said, "Ch't, ch't, Mr. Walker; you know you
must not make a speech for the prisoner. Call your witness. It is
all that is needed."</p>
<p>I wondered what he meant by that. The barrister was calling a
man of the name of Williams. I seemed to know the name. I seemed
to know the man, too.</p>
<p>"Owen Williams, Master of the ship <i>Lion</i>...Coffee and
dye-wood... Just come in under a jury-rig. Had been dismasted and
afterwards becalmed. Heard of this trial from the pilot in
Graves-end. Had taken post-chaises..."</p>
<p>I only heard snatches of his answers.</p>
<p>"On the twenty-fifth of August last I was close in with the
Cuban coast...The mate, Sebright, got boiling water for
them...Afterwards a heavy fog. They boarded us in many boats..."
He was giving all the old evidence over again, fastening another
stone around my neck. But suddenly he said: "This gentleman came
alongside in a leaky dinghy. A dead shot. He saved all our
lives."</p>
<p>His bullet-head, the stare of his round blue eyes seemed to
draw me out of a delirium. I called out:</p>
<p>"Williams, for God's sake, Williams, where is Seraphina? Did
she come with you?" There was an immense roaring in my head, and
the ushers were shouting, "Silence! Silence!" I called out
again.</p>
<p>Williams was smiling idiotically; then he shook his head and
put his finger to his mouth to warn me to keep silence. I only
noted the shake of the head. Sera-phina had not come. The Havana
people must have taken her. It was all over with me. The roaring
noise made me think that I was on a beach by the sea, with the
smugglers, perhaps, at night down in Kent. The silence that fell
upon the court was like the silence of a grave. Then someone
began to speak in measured, portentous Spanish, that seemed a
memory of the past.</p>
<p>"I, the ambassador of his Catholic Majesty, being here upon my
honour and on my oath, demand the re-surrender of this gentleman,
whose courage equals his innocence. Documents which have just
reached my hands establish clearly the mistake of which he is the
victim. The functionary who is called <i>Alcayde</i> of the
<i>carcel</i> at Havana confused the men. Nikola el Escoces
escaped, having murdered the judge whose place it was to
identify. I demand that the prisoner be set at liberty..."</p>
<p>A long time after a harsh voice said:</p>
<p>"Your Excellency, we retire, of course, from the
prosecution."</p>
<p>A different one directed:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen of the jury, you will return a verdict of 'Not
Guilty'..."</p>
<p>Down below they were cheering uproariously because my life was
saved. But it was I that had to face my saved life. I sat there,
my head bowed into my hands. The old judge was speaking to me in
a tone of lofty compassion:</p>
<p>"You have suffered much, as it seems, but suffering is the lot
of us men. Rejoice now that your character is cleared; that here
in this public place you have received the verdict of your
countrymen that restores you to the liberties of our country and
the affection of your kindred. I rejoice with you who am a very
old man, at the end of my life..."</p>
<p>It was rather tremendous, his deep voice, his weighted words.
Suffering is the lot of us men!...The formidable legal array, the
great powers of a nation, had stood up to teach me that, and they
had taught me that&mdash;suffering is the lot of us men!</p>
<p>It takes long enough to realize that someone is dead at a
distance. I had done that. But how long, how long it needs to
know that the life of your heart has come back from the dead. For
years afterwards I could not bear to have her out of my
sight.</p>
<p>Of our first meeting in London all I remember is a
speechlessness that was like the awed hesitation of our overtried
souls before the greatness of a change from the verge of despair
to the opening of a supreme joy.</p>
<p>The whole world, the whole of life, with her return, had
changed all around me; it enveloped me, it enfolded me so lightly
as not to be felt, so suddenly as not to be believed in, so
completely that that whole meeting was an embrace, so softly that
at last it lapsed into a sense of rest that was like the fall of
a beneficent and welcome death.</p>
<p>For suffering is the lot of man, but not inevitable failure or
worthless despair which is without end&mdash;suffering, the mark
of manhood, which bears within its pain a hope of felicity like a
jewel set in iron...</p>
<p>Her first words were:</p>
<p>"You broke our compact. You went away from me whilst I was
sleeping." Only the deepness of her reproach revealed the depth
of her love, and the suffering she too had endured to reach a
union that was to be without end&mdash;and to forgive.</p>
<p>And, looking back, we see Romance&mdash;that subtle thing that
is mirage&mdash;that is life. It is the goodness of the years we
have lived through, of the old time when we did this or that,
when we dwelt here or there. Looking back, it seems a wonderful
enough thing that I who am this, and she who is that, commencing
so far away a life that, after such sufferings borne together and
apart, ended so tranquilly there in a world so stable&mdash;that
she and I should have passed through so much, good chance and
evil chance, sad hours and joyful, all lived down and swept away
into the little heap of dust that is life. That, too, is
Romance!</p>
