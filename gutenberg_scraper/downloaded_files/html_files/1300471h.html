  <h2><a name="story1"
     id="story1">I. &mdash; THE GOVERNOR OF CHI-FOO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN Chi-Foo, as in the Forbidden City, the phrase
  Iang-knei-tsi, which means "foreign devil," was one seldom employed, for
  Colin" Hemel, who in the days of the Manchu dynasty had the august and
  godlike ear of the Daughter of Heaven, was as terribly quick to punish now
  that he served a democratic president. As for Chi-Foo, Augustus Verrill sat
  there, and, brute as he was, he had still enough of the white man in him to
  resent Iang-knei-tsi.</p>s

  <p>So it was Iang-ren that people said, meaning (so we persuade ourselves)
  "honorable foreign."</p>

  <p>What they call foreigners in Chi-Foo nowadays I do not know, for Augustus
  Verrill is not there, and for this reason.</p>

  <p>On a bright spring morning the interested but fearful people of Chi-Foo,
  straining their ears for the sound, were rewarded with the word they awaited.
  It was the word "shul!" which means "kill!"</p>

  <p>A Chinaman with a thick padded coat of blue, his hands concealed in his
  sleeves, was picking a delicate way along the untidy street which leads to
  the Gate of a Thousands Regrets, when he heard the guttural whisper, and saw
  the crazy door of a house come flying outward.</p>

  <p>He spun round on the heel of his felt boot, his eyes blinking in the
  strong sunlight, his lean brown face tense, and a grin of expectancy showing
  the white even rim of his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" said the dog-faced leader.</p>

  <p>The blue-coated Chinaman squared his elbow and a straight splinter of fire
  leaped from his hand.</p>

  <p>The dog-faced man, with a grimace like one who swallows a noxious draught,
  went lurching against the white wall of the house, leaving it smeared and
  disfigured when he finally collapsed to his knees.</p>

  <p>This was against all arrangement, for the Devil in Blue had left the inn
  outside the city gates, and in a second's space the Street of Going Forth was
  deserted save for the bluecoated Chinaman and the gurgling thing that was
  huddled in the mud by the wall. The blue Chinaman looked down, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Insensate Chink," said he. "Blind and prejudiced instrument of fate
  &mdash;quo vadis?"</p>

  <p>He took a white handkerchief from the fold of his sleeve and blew his
  nose, never removing his eyes from the dying man.</p>

  <p>"Better you than me, by gad," he said earnestly, "from all over the world
  to die like a pig in a wallow of mud? That's no death for a gentleman."</p>

  <p>All the time he spoke aloud in English, yet so cleverly was he made up, so
  scrupulous was the attention he had devoted to his toilette and the <i>et
  ceteras</i> of his character that none in the city of Chi-Foo knew him for
  any other than Li Wan, a small-piece mandarin charged by the Daughter of
  Heaven to inquire into certain irregularities at the Court of Mandarin Wen-Ho
  Hong, Governor of the Province of Chi-Foo.</p>

  <p>He waited until the man was dead, then looked up and down the deserted
  street. The Gate of a Thousand Regrets was closed, though it was long before
  sunrise. The Captain of the Guard would explain the unusual happening, would
  also swear by his domestic gods that he saw no sight of brawling and heard no
  sound of shot.</p>

  <p>At the other end of the street a little knot of small boys had gathered
  with folded arms, frowning curiously, and relaxing their attitude from time
  to time to point out, with their thin little arms stretched stiffly, the
  tragic consequences of the attack.</p>

  <p>These melted as the man in blue, twirling his long-barreled Browning,
  walked slowly back the way he had come. The bazaar was alive with
  people&mdash;the bazaar which ran to the right from the street end to the
  very gates of the Yamen.</p>

  <p>But even this crowd, silent and watchful, stepped on one side to give him
  a free passage. Once he heard a half-hearted "Shul!" and his quick ears
  caught the rustle of movement which is so ominous a sequence to such an
  urgent suggestion. Then a jagged stone whistled past his ear, and he heard
  the "Ugh!" of the man who threw it.</p>

  <p>He was half-way to the Yamen, and did not turn until another stone caught
  him in the middle of his well-padded back.</p>

  <p>He whipped round as the thrower was stooping for further ammunition, and
  covered him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, man," said he, in the queer dialect of the river province, "I wish
  you a safe journey."</p>

  <p>The thrower dropped his stone as if he had been shot.</p>

  <p>"Come nearer to me," commanded the Blue Man, and the coolie shuffled
  forward through the mud, staring without expression into the gray eyes of the
  other.</p>

  <p>"There is a wind on the river tonight," said the man with the pistol.</p>

  <p>"I sail my sampan in the wind," stammered the other; and then, "Let me die
  if I have offended your honorable body."</p>

  <p>"Walk behind me, brother," said the blue Chinaman, and continued on his
  way. The trembling coolie who had followed him did not see him grin, or know
  that the Devil in Blue was armed. He had used the password of the Mournful
  Owls&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;and here was a member of the secret
  society humbly serving him, though Chung-Win-Ti, the local head of the Order,
  lay stiffening in the mud not a stone's throw away.</p>

  <p>The man in blue passed hastily through the gates of the Yamen, and entered
  the outer Court of Justice.</p>

  <p>He swept aside an imploring secretary full of murmurs about the Mandarin's
  indisposition, and came without ceremony to the presence of the Governor.</p>

  <p>Wen-Ho-Hong looked up as the Blue Man entered, and started.</p>

  <p>"It is an honorable happening that you condescend to come to my hovel," he
  murmured. "Does your graciousness desire something?"</p>

  <p>"My miserable carcass has come," said the Blue Man, a snarl on his lips,
  "despite the fact that your honorable assassins endeavored to send me on the
  journey; also, my noble prince, I fear that I have villainously slain an
  honorable servant of yours, Chung-Win-Ti, in the Street by the Gate."</p>

  <p>The aesthetic face of the other did not so much as twitch.</p>

  <p>"If you had brought your nobleness with the other honorable members of
  your Commission," he said gently, "I, unworthy as I am, would have sent forth
  my miserable guard to bring your felicity to the Yamen."</p>

  <p>For a moment they sat, two Chinamen with shaven heads and plaited queues,
  their hands upon their knees, watching one another; then the Governor
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"Will your lordship deign to enter my poverty-stricken inner room?"</p>

  <p>The stranger hesitated a moment, then rose without a word and followed the
  Mandarin through the great lacquered door, which the Mandarin closed
  carefully behind him.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Hemel," he said, in English, "we can talk&mdash;what is the
  idea?"</p>

  <p>Colin Hemel, the President of China's Secret Service, lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"A few slight irregularities, Augustus," he said slowly, between his
  puffs. "Robbery of troops' pay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's nothing," said the other lightly. "Betrayal of the Government to
  the rebels&mdash;membership of a secret society."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing either," snarled the Mandarin. "Isn't there anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>Colin Hemel looked up at the beautiful carved ceiling of the
  sanctuary.</p>

  <p>"When we were very young men," he said slowly, "long before you went
  Chinese&mdash;I suppose the fact that we were both born in the land makes our
  jobs natural&mdash;there was a girl at Shanghai; do you remember?"</p>

  <p>The other licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"I was rather fond of her, and so were you," Colin went on, "and when Li
  Hang took you up, made you his English secretary, and finally gave you a
  province to rule, I was jolly glad&mdash;it sort of left the way open to
  me."</p>

  <p>The other smiled faintly, but Colin seemed not to see him.</p>

  <p>"I heard all about your wonderful success at Pekin, how you had pleased
  the Daughter of Heaven, and your fine new appointment&mdash;the only American
  to hold such a job, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>The Mandarin nodded.</p>

  <p>"I used to talk about it to her, and she was a little wistful. One day she
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>The man before him averted his gaze.</p>

  <p>"She disappeared," repeated the Secret Service man, blowing out a cloud of
  smoke, "and she came here."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence, which the Mandarin broke.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the other, "I have added to your crimes&mdash;that."</p>

  <p>The man he called Augustus&mdash;he was an Augustus Verrill before his
  Chinese days&mdash;nodded.</p>

  <p>"I somehow fancied you were on the track when I heard the Commission was
  appointed," he said; "naturally I tried&mdash;to stop you. I am rather a big
  chap with the Owls, and they do, well&mdash;they do things for me."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said the blue-coated man dryly.</p>

  <p>"As for Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Verrill, for, of course, I married
  her&mdash;you are quite mistaken if you think she is unhappy. You shall see
  her if you care&mdash;after this trial. I suppose it <i>is</i> a trial?"</p>

  <p>Colin nodded. "The Commission will arrive in an hour. I came on ahead for
  reasons of my own."</p>

  <p>"To secure news of her?" The Mandarin's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Can't I&mdash;can't I see her now?"</p>

  <p>The Mandarin shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Be reasonable, my dear fellow," he said suavely. "She is in the very best
  of health&mdash;lives like a princess and all that sort of
  thing&mdash;servants&mdash;and she's awfully happy."</p>

  <p>Colin rose, and paced the parquetted floor of the room, his hand on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"That is all I want," he said, a little huskily. "I wronged you,
  Verrill&mdash;I'm sorry." He held out his hand. "I always thought there was a
  beast in you. Somehow I never thought of her as being happy. That&mdash;that
  was conceit, I suppose. I'll arrange the Commission for you."</p>

  <p>Later he was to remember the attempt on his life, and wonder why &mdash;if
  the man had nothing to fear. But perhaps he feared for her, that this
  masterful officer, who now enjoyed the confidence of the Daughter of Heaven,
  would carry her back to her people perhaps.</p>

  <p>He went to the sitting of the Commission with a light heart.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He who was called Wen-Ho-Hong swore by all his domestic gods, and by every
  sacred thing save his dead father&mdash;he was too much of a gentleman to so
  perjure himself&mdash;that he knew nothing of the world of the Owls, nor of
  any,other secret society. He was charged also with having been the cause of a
  mutiny in the army by withholding his soldiers' pay for a year, but here he
  saved himself without difficulty.</p>

  <p>The Owls' business was more difficult to explain away to the commissioners
  from Pekin. Though he thrust responsibility upon a smallpiece mandarin named
  Ho-shi-lai, though he arrayed witnesses by the thousand&mdash;producing a
  sample hundred in the flesh before the grave Commission who sat, hands on
  knees, spectacled and impassive, in the court-house-to testify to his
  innocence, neither Li-hung-sao nor the teak-faced Mandarin with the winking
  eye, who sat at the end of the row of judges, were visibly impressed.</p>

  <p>"The Daughter of Heaven" (they still preserve the faction of Royal
  Government in China), murmured Li-hung-sao apologetically, "is disturbed, and
  miserable sycophant as I am, and unworthy to discuss such high matters with
  Your Excellency, yet I must humbly ask for a better story to carry to the
  gate of the Celestial City."</p>

  <p>"Prince," said the Governor lightly, and he glanced meaningly at Colin
  Hemel, "I have sworn by the Noble Dead, and I have brought witnesses to prove
  that I know nothing of the killing of the Sesu folk&mdash;I can do no
  more."</p>

  <p>Li-hung-sao had glanced from time to time at the third member of the
  Commission.</p>

  <p>"What does Your Excellency say to this?" he asked timidly, for president
  though he was, the last word was with the blue-coated man at the least
  important place.</p>

  <p>Colin Hemel twisted round.</p>

  <p>"I am unworthy to give an opinion," he said, and he was occupied in his
  mind with the important question&mdash;how little could he with decency fine
  this peccant Mandarin, before he delivered a mild admonition?</p>

  <p>For he was anxious to have done with this farce of a trial&mdash;a farce
  which he had planned so tragically&mdash;and go to some place where he could
  see her over again and for the last time. How strange she would seem in the
  Chinese costume she would wear! She with her flaxen hair and gray eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency knows," he began, when there was a stir in the crowd, a
  howl like the howl of a beast, and a figure dived head down between the
  soldiers. It fell on its knees before the grave court.</p>

  <p>A coolie flung after and lashed at the quivering figure in his fear and
  rage.</p>

  <p>"Excellencies," he stammered, "a woman from the
  kitchen&mdash;shameless."</p>

  <p>"Mercy, 0 judges!" the thing on the floor mumbled and blubbered in
  Chinese, and raised its head and caught the staring eyes of the Mandarin in
  blue. He saw the cropped hair, the gray eyes, the wasted face, the skinny
  arms stretched in supplication.</p>

  <p>"Mr.&mdash;Mr. Hemell" sobbed the wreck, and collapsed.</p>

  <p>"Let this woman be taken to my chair," said Hemel softly; "in the name of
  the Daughter of Heaven, let no man harm her."</p>

  <p>The court was very still; only the shuffling feet of the man who lifted
  the figure and the heavy breathing of the Governor of Chi-Foo were the sounds
  heard.</p>

  <p>Then Hemel, white as death, leaned forward, consulting no man, and struck
  a gong with his bare knuckles. Through the side door curtained with gold and
  black tapestries came a man bare to the waist, dull-eyed and brown. He ran
  forward and sank on his knees before the judge, sweeping his lithe body till
  his shaven forehead touched the ground.</p>

  <p>"Go, Fa-ti-sing," said Colin Hemel huskily, "taking with you His
  Excellency Wen-Ho-Hong, the Governor. Outside the city gate, near by the
  Plain of Ten Thousand Sorrows, you shall strike the head of Wen-Ho-Hong from
  his body. In the name of the Daughter of Heaven, tremble and obey."</p>

  <p>So they took Augustus Verrill to the appointed place, and snicked off his
  head before an incurious crowd, and the members of the Commission went back
  to Pekin in their chairs.</p>

  <p>All except the teak-faced Mandarin, who, with three soldiers at his back,
  rode out of the Gate of Great Assistance, and took the bumpy road for the
  hospital at Foo-sang, riding beside a palanquin wherein lay a Chinese
  kitchen-wench who was all the world to him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">II. &mdash; IN THRALL</a></h2>

  <p class="poem">"Who knows where I may sleep to-night.<br>
  On what dark moor or what wild shore?<br>
  With starry robes of Heaven for gown,<br>
  I'll lay my bruisèd body down.<br>
  My bed the em'rald bracken bright&mdash;<br>
  Who knows where I shall sleep to-night?"</p>

  <p class="first">IF it were not for the fact that this was Poggy's favorite
  ballad, Ferdie would have said nothing. But whenever Letty sat down and
  twiddled the keys and turned over the music and said, "I don't like that," or
  "That's a beautiful song, but I can't sing it properly," or strummed and
  hummed another, and finally ran her white hand down the crease of "The Song
  of the Zingari," Ferdie used to sit back and recite the multiplication table
  to himself until she struck the final chord. Poggy, of course, wrote the
  song. His name, E. Poglan Bannett, was stamped all over the cover, and he
  drew unbelievable sums in the shape of royalties. Amongst the unbelievers was
  Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"I think it is a perfectly asinine song," said Ferdie. "Where the deuce do
  you expect to sleep?"</p>

  <p>Letty dropped her hand on her lap. She would, with the slightest
  encouragement, have dropped one on his ear.</p>

  <p>Picking up her fan, she walked across to the library table, which Mr.
  Revel insisted upon keeping in the drawing-room, and sat down. And they
  talked. And at the end of ten minutes...</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know," said Ferdie, choking, "that you've simply blighted
  my whole life!"</p>

  <p>Lettice Revel considered the matter, knit brows and pursed lips
  advertising her study.</p>

  <p>"Like the Spaniard?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>Ferdie had no acquaintance with vaudeville songs, being somewhat serious
  minded, but he did know that the Spanish were a romantic and melancholy
  people, and took the illustration in good part.</p>

  <p>"I daresay the Spaniard is blighted under similar circumstances, and, for
  the matter of that, the Czecho-Slovakian. And the Transylvanian. You've made
  an absolute mess of my existence, Letty. You've simply hashed me!"</p>

  <p>"Hash is Irish Stew, isn't it?"&mdash;really interested. "We had the
  funniest cookery mistress at school. We called her Doughnut Dora, because she
  simply specialized&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A man has a right to believe that, when a woman accepts a man's ring and
  says 'Certainly,' or whatever she says when the man says 'Will you, old
  dear?' that a woman won't go strolling over a man's
  suscep&mdash;sus&mdash;well, whatever it is&mdash; with spiked boots. If a
  man has principles and refuses to go to a party where you've invited a
  shocking little bounder, who simply makes a fearful ass of himself all the
  time, and thinks he's being funny because a lot of fearful asses laugh at his
  apish tricks&mdash;and as to his being a composer... he couldn't compose a
  rice pudding!&mdash;I say, if a man says, 'No, I won't go and I don't want
  you to have him,' if a man&mdash;well, dash it, Letty, can't you see...?"</p>

  <p>She ran her fingers through her hair&mdash;it was a mass of golden
  floss&mdash;and leant back, resigned.</p>

  <p>"Who is this man you're talking about&mdash;the fearful ass?"</p>

  <p>"Me, of course," he said indignantly. "No, not that one, that's Poggy. I
  mean I'm the man you're talking about&mdash;I'm talking about!"</p>

  <p>"0h!" said Letty quietly.</p>

  <p>The wonderful eyes she turned upon Ferdie were grave, every contour that
  made up expression showed how much she realized the exceeding seriousness of
  the situation. Her diamond engagement-ring lay on the table by her side (she
  happened to be sitting on the table), well within reach of the wretched young
  man, who blinked alternately from the ring to the girl.</p>

  <p>"No useful purpose can be served by prolonging an interview already too
  painful," she said primly. "We are experiencing the clash of
  ideals&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come down off the table if you want to be dignified," said the young man
  miserably. "And all that clashing of ideals stuff sounds like the
  introduction to a cinema drama of love and sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Let us part without a scene," she said gently, and held out her hand. "I
  shall never forget you, Reggie."</p>

  <p>He writhed.</p>

  <p>"I won't even trouble to tell you that my name is Ferdinand. It would only
  make you more comic."</p>

  <p>The ring he gathered up with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Don't you dare throw it in the fire!" she warned him as he lifted the
  trinket to the level of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It cost a hundred and twenty-five pounds," said the disconsolate young
  man. "They gave me a ten per cent discount because I knew the managing
  director. Am I likely to throw it away? I was looking to see if you'd damaged
  it. You've been very careful. Good-bye, Letty."</p>

  <p>Her speculative gaze held him.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to shoot lions?" she asked. He appealed to her mutely. "0r
  build a house in some fever-stricken swamp in Central Africa? Once I believed
  in you, Ferdie, and ordered black. Once I put an advertisement in the
  newspapers asking Central African newspapers to copy. And the same night I
  saw you in Chiro's, teaching Molly Fetinhough the new tango step. Ferdie, you
  are speaking to a woman who has suffered!"</p>

  <p>"I lost the boat," he said lamely.</p>

  <p>"Did you find it looking down that bony creature's back? You will not go
  away. Tomorrow night you will be here."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the exact spot on the carpet where he would grovel. Ferdie
  examined it curiously.</p>

  <p>Through the open window came the soft harmonies of church bells and the
  hushed music of a band playing carols. It was the Salvation Army band. Ferdie
  recognized the flat E of the cornet.</p>

  <p>"And is this Christmas Eve!" he said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It is&mdash;the twenty-fourth," she said informatively. "Didn't you
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, when you're entertaining your beastly bounder friend, Poggy, or
  singing his 'Who Knows?' and splitting your sides over his fatuous, infantile
  jokes that he cuts from <i>Life</i> and keeps in a scrapbook&mdash;I've seen
  it," he added treacherously. "There isn't a boat for Asia Minor tonight, but
  perhaps you'll think of me in my lonely apartment drinking beer all
  alone&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Surely you don't want assistance to drink beer!" she said coldly. "I've
  always understood that it wasn't strong enough to necessitate the calling in
  of help. Ferdie, I wish you a happy Christmas. There is no reason in the
  world why we shouldn't be good friends. I've realized for a long time that,
  temperamentally, we were unfitted for one another. A woman has the right to
  choose her friends."</p>

  <p>"A woman!" he scoffed. "And the year before last I was coaching you
  through the holidays for your school certificate! Who sat up half the night
  trying to knock the first idea of the integral calculus into your nut?"</p>

  <p>"The past is dead," she said, with dignity, and switched her fan.</p>

  <p>"Do that again," he said, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"Do what? The fan? It is an old trick I learnt years ago."</p>

  <p>"In the kindergarten? Go on, do it. That's cute. I'll bet Poggy taught you
  that. What a lady!"</p>

  <p>She was on her feet now, delicate trace of eyebrows arched. She might,
  with profit to her reputation as a well-bred lady, have maintained the pose.
  Instead of which:</p>

  <p>"Now, Ferdie, are you going? Or shall I call Arthurs to chuck you through
  the window?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie bowed. In the presence of vibrant maidenhood he was dumb&mdash;
  temporarily.</p>

  <p>"I only want to say&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She walked to the fireplace and put her finger on the bell, and there was
  a look of sinister curiosity in her eyes. So might Caesar's wife, above
  suspicion and well out of reach, have looked when she saw her first Christian
  martyrs introduced to the lions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ferdinand Stevington stepped out into Portland Place and turned up the
  collar of his overcoat. It was a rainy night, a warm westerly breeze was
  blowing&mdash;typical Christmas weather.</p>

  <p>Standing by the iron railings that separated the street from the cavernous
  area, he gazed, dim eyed, at the yellow blind which hid from his view all
  that had been desirable in life. He had an immeasurable sense of poverty, and
  his heart blazed resentfully against those who, rich in her respect and
  affection, refused him the crumbs which had so sparsely fallen from the feast
  her bounty provided.</p>

  <p>The watchful Nobbins brought the Rolls from the center of the road, where
  it had been parked, and guided it noiselessly and cunningly to the edge of
  the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Nobbins; I will walk," said Ferdie quietly.</p>

  <p>"It's raining, sir."</p>

  <p>Nobbins invariably told him the news. Many a murder would have passed
  unscanned but for Nobbins.</p>

  <p>Ferdie glanced up at the copper-hued sky and laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't noticed it," he said.</p>

  <p>A raindrop fell straight into his eye and he cursed.</p>

  <p>"No, I will walk," he said.</p>

  <p>He was wearing the thinnest of shoes, and the pavement was wet and muddy.
  Wet feet had turned many a robust man into a wan and listless invalid about
  whose cot red-eyed women hung breathlessly, praying that the past could be
  wiped out and cruel words recalled. Ferdie walked in the gutter.</p>

  <p>The Salvation Army band at the corner of Duke Street was inviting
  Christians to awake. Most of the Christians in Duke Street had been awake for
  hours, and were only just beginning to take an interest in the overcrowded
  state of the dancing-floor. Those Christians who were asleep were in the
  smoke-rooms of respectable clubs, where only the head waiter or the house
  steward is allowed to waken members.</p>

  <p>And at this blessed time, when the servants' Christmas-box list is hanging
  in the hall and only three tables are laid in the dining-room, even head
  waiters hesitated to assist the carollers in their mission.</p>

  <p>Ferdie strode on, shrugged at the collecting-box that was pushed timidly
  toward him by a bonneted adjutant, repenting, to return and donate
  handsomely. And then there occurred in his brain one of those seismic
  disturbances that send tidal waves of brilliant inspiration across the
  commonplace surfaces of his mind.</p>

  <p>"Will you be good enough to take your band to No. 743 and play 'Where is
  my Wandering Boy Tonight?'" he asked.</p>

  <p>She consulted the man with the silver cornet&mdash;he of the flat
  E&mdash;and it was arranged.</p>

  <p>Ferdie went onward with a lighter heart. His flat in Devonshire Street
  seemed strangely lonely and empty. On the table lay a little package wrapped
  in thin silver paper and tied with blue ribbons, and at the sight of it, his
  spirits sank again. On the mantlepiece was a photograph of a girl. He averted
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nobbins is here, sir."</p>

  <p>His valet made the announcement in his quiet way.</p>

  <p>"Here, is he? Let him go home to his wife and family, Stephen; it is
  Christmas-tide. Go home to your wife and family!"</p>

  <p>"I am not married, sir."</p>

  <p>Ferdie turned upon the man.</p>

  <p>"Have you a family?"</p>

  <p>Stephen, a man with a beautiful mind, whose dream it was that some day he
  would be appointed a lay reader or a court missionary, gazed at his master
  with eyes that in dumb suffering were like unto a wounded beast.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; it follows," he said gently.</p>

  <p>Ferdie hunched himself round in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What would you like to do tomorrow, Stephen?"</p>

  <p>Stephen coughed.</p>

  <p>"I should like to attend the morning service at the Foundling Hospital,
  sir," he said. "In the afternoon I and some friends are giving a little
  musical entertainment at the Marylebone Workhouse. I play a little."</p>

  <p>"The harp, one thinks!" said Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"No, sir: the saxophone," replied Stephen modestly. "It is somewhat
  difficult to play."</p>

  <p>"Go somewhere&mdash;and play it. Bring joy into suffering hearts,
  Stephen." He sat up quickly. "Can you play 'Where is my Wandering Boy
  Tonight'?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>Ferdie pointed to the door. Stephen bowed slightly and went out.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow was Christmas Day. He had rejected every invitation but one. And
  that one...</p>

  <p>...His maniacal laughter reached the butler's pantry, where Stephen and
  Nobbins were exchanging cigarette cards.</p>

  <p>"One can excuse much on Christmas Eve, Nobbins," said Stephen charitably.
  They were both members of a Brotherhood, but Stephen was the more brotherly.
  "You wouldn't like to drop in at the Marylebone Workhouse tomorrow
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Am I drunk, too?" asked the chauffeur reproachfully.</p>

  <p>But Ferdie was not drunk. He was not even intoxicated. He was just
  broken-hearted and crushed and baffled. He wanted to do something that was
  exceedingly reckless, such as rescuing a child from a fire. The fire, for
  preference, to be in Portland Place, immediately opposite No. 743. He wanted
  to grow a beard and go away to sea before the mast. Or, if necessary, he was
  willing to give the mast a start. And then he wanted to come back bronzed and
  bearded, and be knocked down by a motor-car, preferably Letty's two-seater,
  and be picked up and carried into 743 Portland Place and hear Letty cry,
  "Why, it's Ferdie! What have I done?"</p>

  <p>He wanted to sink lower and lower in the social scale (without necessarily
  surrendering his large holdings in Conifers Corporation, which yielded a
  steady 8 per cent) until he was the inmate of a common lodging-house. He
  wanted Stephen also to sink lower and lower in the social scale until he was
  the inmate of a common lodging-house too. Stephen could sleep in the next
  cubicle and bring his tea in the morning.</p>

  <p>And by day he would sell things in the gutter, such as shoe-laces,
  matches, and pitiable little toys. And Letty would come along and buy
  something. Then, looking down at him, she would pale and say, "Ferdie! Have I
  brought you to this?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie rang the bell at this point.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a glass of milk," he said.</p>

  <p>"Hot or cold, sir?" asked Stephen.</p>

  <p>Ferdie shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I am indifferent," he said. He was in his most dangerous mood.</p>

  <p>Christmas! He remembered a story he had read, one of Dickens', or it may
  have been some other Johnny. After consideration he decided that it was
  Dickens. He had a wonderful memory for names. The story was about a
  curmudgeon of a fellow who hated Christmas. Sneered at the serried ranks of
  deceased turkeys that hung in the poulterer's shop, snarled at the rosy-faced
  apples, at the grocer's, loathed plum-pudding, and despised holly and
  mistletoe. Ferdie's heart warmed toward... Snoop, was it? Or Gooch, or
  Groodge... Scrooge! That was the chap's name. Scrooge! He remembered
  perfectly. His memory was uncanny where names were concerned.</p>

  <p>Ferdie hated Christmas too. He hated everything that was bright and
  cheery. He turned down the gas fire to make the atmosphere of the room attune
  with his sentiments. Stephen came in to say good-night.</p>

  <p>"And a merry Christmas to you, sir."</p>

  <p>"A merry Christmas!" said Ferdie through his nose. He had never snarled in
  his life; but Scrooge snarled.</p>

  <p>"Have you a cold, sir?"</p>

  <p>Stephen could be fatherly.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't! Christmas! Put out that fire! Have you locked up the bread
  and butter? Do it, Stephen, in case some of the poor break in. Your wages are
  reduced. I'll do without you next week. Did I promise you a
  Christmas-box?"</p>

  <p>"You are good enough, as a rule..."</p>

  <p>It hurt Ferdie to laugh through his nose; it was like champagne that went
  the wrong way. Nevertheless he laughed.</p>

  <p>Stephen went back to the Butler's pantry.</p>

  <p>"Nobbins," he asked earnestly, "will you join me in a short prayer for our
  master?"</p>

  <p>"If it is short," said Nobbins.</p>

  <p>It was toward twelve o'clock when Ferdie put out his hand and clawed
  toward him the little flat package in silver paper. He untied the blue
  ribbons thoughtfully, carefully removed and smoothed the paper, and pressed
  the spring which held together the two sides of a small jewel case. Gleaming
  and glittering in its blue velvet bed was a diamond and platinum pendant. It
  had cost a lot of money. Letty would have given him in exchange a
  cigarette-holder or a walking-stick or a manicure set. Poggy would get it
  now. He ground his teeth at the thought. And Letty would be disappointed and
  hurt. He must send it on and then go away. Whither, he knew not; to some
  obscure foreign town where nobody would dream of looking for him. But who
  would look for him! He asked the question of himself, and his lips curled.
  Stephen would miss him, but he would soon find a new master. The income-tax
  collector would miss him and write to his lawyer. Letty!... She would go,
  uncaring, through life, holding her slim sides and rocking with laughter,
  with Poggy twittering like an ape at her side and asking if she'd heard the
  story about the plumber and the Colonel's knee?</p>

  <p>Stephen came in with a knock.</p>

  <p>"What time would you like your tea in the morning, sir?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie bit his lip deliberately.</p>

  <p>"I may not want tea in the morning, Stephen. My plans are unsettled. At
  any moment I may have to go away. Don't look for me. Dewberry, Hokey,
  Middleton, Parker and Sutton will pay you your wages."</p>

  <p>"Would you like your letters forwarded, sir?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie sighed his impatience.</p>

  <p>"I may be dead," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. Good-night and a merry&mdash;good-night, sir."</p>

  <p>The fellow was impressed, Ferdie could see that. And other people would be
  impresesd. He looked up the first train to Bournemouth.</p>

  <p>But the package must go. A letter should be enclosed, just a brief,
  courteous, and yet not too courteous greeting. "Yours sincerely, Ferdinand
  Stevington." Or, " Wishing you the Christmas you deserve "? No, Ferdie could
  never wish her the least harm.</p>

  <p>"Dear Letty," he began, altered it to "My dear Letty," and began
  again.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend,&mdash;This trifle" (he originally wrote 'inexpensive
  trifle' but cut out the adjective) "comes to you with all my best
  wishes..."</p>

  <p>He ought to make her feel that all the blame was not hers. It was only
  fair.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I have been rather a bear. Forgive me!! I am going a long
  journey, and we may not meet again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused here to consider whether he ought to add "for a day or two," but
  decided to let it go without qualification. It was cruel to raise false
  hopes.</p>

  <p>"I have left your ring in an envelope. It will be found with other little
  intimate relics of a life that has not altogether been wasted. Who knows
  where I may sleep tonight?"</p>

  <p>This he blotted smugly, read every line, picturing her distress when she
  read it. Reluctantly he folded the note inside the silver paper, tied again
  the blue ribbons, and dropped the whole into a long envelope. At twelve
  forty-five he stole up to the door of 743 Portland Place, opened the flap of
  the letter-box and dropped the letter in; it was addressed, with rugged
  simplicity, "Letty, from F.S."</p>

  <p>On three points he was satisfied. It was a big, a magnanimous thing to
  have done. There was something innately fine in the act. The deed was worthy
  of the man. The three statements passed unchallenged. Ferdie knew that he had
  not judged himself unfairly. There was no sterner critic of his actions than
  himself. This he also admitted as an incontrovertible truth.</p>

  <p>And yet...?</p>

  <p>Ferdie wriggled in his chair and looked hard at the shoes he had taken
  off.</p>

  <p>And yet...?</p>

  <p>Had he not lowered himself in her eyes? Was it not an abject surrender on
  the part of one who was, and had been all the time, entirely in the right?
  Was it not a fulfilment of all her scornful predictions? He remembered the
  identical spot on the carpet where he must abase himself!</p>

  <p>Would it not have been better to send a Christmas card? There was one on
  his mantlepiece. It had come from his old nurse and was a picture of a blue
  cottage and white moon. The ground and roof were covered with Epsom salts
  that glittered in the light and was a fair representation of hoar-frost.</p>

  <p class="poem">"May Christmas cheer this day be yours,<br>
  Of sorrow may you ne'er have cause"&mdash;</p>

  <p>was appropriate&mdash;singularly so.</p>

  <p>This time he bit his upper lip, and when a man bites his upper lip he is
  in doubt. She would laugh at him. Poor fool! How quickly he had come to
  heel!</p>

  <p>Ferdie rose, kicked off his slippers so that when he did make up his mind,
  he could instantly dash into the kind of footwear that his decision called
  for. Whilst he was thinking, he might as well put on his street shoes.</p>

  <p>She would tell Poggy, of course...</p>

  <p>He took down the Christmas card, underlined the pious hope in the second
  line of the stanza, and, scribbling a line, "Merry Xmas, F.," put it into an
  envelope.</p>

  <p>There was a pair of ice tongs somewhere about&mdash;curved silver ice
  tongs, with handles like scissors. He had thought everything out.</p>

  <p>"I would have made a wonderful criminal," said Ferdie regretfully.</p>

  <p>With the tongs in his coat pocket, he drove in a taxi to Langham Place,
  dismissed the machine, and walked up Portland Place. A thin fog assisted the
  drizzle to make England what it is at Christmas-time. A new and livelier herd
  of carol players were jazzing "Good King Wenceslas" brightly. Ferdie found
  himself stepping unconsciously. And the clock struck two.</p>

  <p>No. 743 was in darkness when he stepped up to the door. In a second the
  ice tongs were in the letter-box and had gripped. He drew out a package of a
  familiar shape and dropped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>In his agitation Ferdie released his ice tongs, and they fell with a
  clatter.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?" he said, and added seasonably, "A merry
  Christmas!"</p>

  <p>"And a happy New Year!" said the big man who had come noiselessly behind
  him. "You're coming to Marylebone Lane with me."</p>

  <p>"If you imagine I'm going to take a country stroll at this hour and in
  this beastly weather, you're mistaken. Give me the lanes of England by all
  means&mdash;but on a summer day with the meadow-sweet and the may-weed and
  the dog-roses on the hedges..."</p>

  <p>"Are you coming quietly!"</p>

  <p>There was something very tremendous in the question. Ferdie reeled and
  gripped the railings, tight.</p>

  <p>"That sort of thing went out with the suffragettes," said the detective
  testily.</p>

  <p>"You're a policeman!"</p>

  <p>"Sergeant&mdash;M'Neill. Now come on, my lad, I've been watching you for
  an hour."</p>

  <p>He took Ferdie's arm unaffectionately, and they walked on.</p>

  <p>"Where's your pal. Lew?" asked the officer.</p>

  <p>"Loo&mdash;do you mean Waterloo?" Dazed but brave, Ferdie endeavored to be
  intelligent.</p>

  <p>At the station, a bright steel dock and a very stout and annoyed station
  sergeant who put down his pen and surveyed the prisoner with disfavor:</p>

  <p>"Name?"</p>

  <p>"My name... Smith."</p>

  <p>"Very original&mdash;John or William?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie thought.</p>

  <p>"Caractacus," he said.</p>

  <p>The sergeant at the desk lifted his upper lip cynically.</p>

  <p>"Address?"</p>

  <p>"Buckingham Palace, ha, ha!" said Ferdie dismally.</p>

  <p>Such jests had been made before.</p>

  <p>"Refuses address&mdash;yes, sergeant, what's the charge?"</p>

  <p>"Letter-box stealing. I found him extracting letters from 743 Portland
  Place with the aid of an instrument or tool."</p>

  <p>The instrument or tool was laid on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Did he get anything?"</p>

  <p>The detective laid a package on the table, and Ferdie scratched his chin.
  His little present had been in a long envelope. This was not in any kind of
  envelope. Moreover, it was tied with lavender ribbon.</p>

  <p>"'From Poggy to Lettice,'" read the detective.</p>

  <p>Ferdie staggered out of the pen, but the detective pushed him back.</p>

  <p>"A diamond and emerald ornament in the shape of a grand piano," announced
  the desk-officer.</p>

  <p>"What execrable taste, and may I add how singularly vulgar!" said
  Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"Have you anybody you wish to notify of your arrest? You will be in
  custody for three days," said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"A word from a woman could save me," said Ferdie brokenly. "I am too proud
  to ask: we Smiths are not without our proper pride."</p>

  <p>A weary gaoler appeared; Ferdie was searched. A pocket-book containing a
  fabulous sum of money, a gold cigarette-case, divers articles of gold and
  silver.</p>

  <p>"You've had a good day, son," said the sergeant respectfully. "Put him in
  No. 6, Wilkins..."</p>

  <p>The cell door did not clang, Ferdie noticed; it "ooshed"!</p>

  <p>The Revels never opened their Christmas presents until the dinner-hour,
  when all kind donors were on hand to be thanked, enthusiastically,
  ecstatically, or just thanked. "You really ought not to have got such a
  beautiful handbag. It is just the thing I wanted! I'm getting so used to the
  other twelve."</p>

  <p>There was a master to the house, one George Palliter Revel, P.O., M.P. He
  paid for everything and approved of everything. Lettice Gionvanna Revel was
  another master. She merely gave orders, and said who might come to dinner and
  who might not. Everybody loved Lettice. People wrote poems about her, even
  people who could not write poetry. She had a speed-car, a bull-terrier, and a
  signed photograph of Douglas Fairbanks framed in gold. She liked men to be
  strong and manly and silent. Purposeful men who picked girls up in their arms
  and strode through the dim aisles of the primeval woods. Ferdie had never
  picked her up, except in a figurative sense. She loved him as a mother loves
  a helpless babe.</p>

  <p>She mentioned this fact at dinner, being entirely without reticence.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie isn't here, papa, because I told him not to come."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Revel mildly. "I thought that you and he...?"</p>

  <p>She smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"It was merely a boy-and-girl courtship," she said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Revel rubbed his left ear.</p>

  <p>"How old are you now, Letty?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteen and a bit," she said. "I'm a woman, daddy&mdash;you sometimes
  forget that. My love for Ferdie is purely maternal."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Revel, more mildly than ever.</p>

  <p>He was by nature mild, being one of those large-faced men with pannier
  cheeks and a bald and wrinkled forehead. He owed his eminence to his
  mildness, for, when his party was in power, he was so mild that the
  opposition thought he was sympathetic, and when they came in they offered him
  a seat in the Cabinet, only to discover that he was mildness itself to his
  former colleagues, and by them was confirmed in his office when they, in
  their turn, came back to power. To any Government, mild opposition is more
  acceptable than violent support.</p>

  <p>"Now for the presents!" said Mr. Revel.</p>

  <p>Poggy Bannett grew melancholy.</p>

  <p>"You quite understand why mine isn't here, Letty? The wretched burglar
  took it. I've been half the day at the police station, identifying the thing.
  They wouldn't let me bring it away."</p>

  <p>She smiled with her eyes. It is awfully difficult, but if you practise
  before a mirror for an hour a day it can be mastered.</p>

  <p>"It was too good of you, Poggy, my dear. I'd much rather have had a signed
  copy of your lovely song. Honestly, I dislike Christmas presents. They are so
  unreal&mdash;so... you know."</p>

  <p>Poggy nodded. He was a thin-faced young man with a sharp, out-thrust nose.
  Even amateur artists found him easy to draw.</p>

  <p>"And, of course, I don't expect anything from Ferdie. He wouldn't
  dare&mdash; "</p>

  <p>She looked at the envelope and frowned.</p>

  <p>"If he has returned the pipe I gave him last Christmas, I shall be very
  angry," she said. The envelope torn: "0h! How perfectly wonderful! Oh, but he
  shouldn't! Isn't that just like Ferdie, papa? He really has the most
  exquisite taste!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the little price ticket that Ferdie had left on, and rapidly
  calculated what 10 per cent, discount on £95 might be.</p>

  <p>The letter she read slowly, her lips moving.</p>

  <p>"Heavens!"</p>

  <p>Poggy saw her pale... She passed the letter to him without a word.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense!" said Poggy. "Twiff! Skittles! He's all right! You don't
  imagine...pooh! He's done it before!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes shone like twin stars.</p>

  <p>"If Ferdie says he will do a thing, he will do it," she said.</p>

  <p>"What is it, my dear!"</p>

  <p>When Mr. Revel asked a question, he signified his intention by fixing his
  pince-nez.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie may have committed suicide," breathed Lettice.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Revel, and took off his glasses. He had no further
  questions to ask. All day long he had had a feeling that it would be an
  interesting evening.</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" said Poggy hotly. "I like his nerve quoting my verses: 'Where
  will I sleep tonight?'&mdash;that's practically plagiarism."</p>

  <p>She drew a long, long breath that swelled her all up momentarily.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think he is?"</p>

  <p>The author of "Where Will I Sleep Tonight" smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you a story," he said. "A South American once asked an
  Irishman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you reserve your quotations from Life until a more appropriate
  occasion?"&mdash;icily. "I asked you what do you think he has done?"</p>

  <p>"You asked me where he was," responded the aggrieved composer. "He's in
  his own rooms; that's where he is&mdash;sulking and causing everybody
  trouble! I'll bet a thousand!"</p>

  <p>He got up from the table excitedly.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and bring him!" he said. "With my bare bands I will drag him from
  his hiding-place. He can't fool me. My friend Cruthers has a flat on the same
  floor. Wait for us!"</p>

  <p>He dashed from the room. Mr. Revel, who had dozed, looked up.</p>

  <p>"There will be an inquest, of course," he said, addressing the ceiling.
  "Happily I shall not be called."</p>

  <p>She looked at her progenitor, pain in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she said, and he winced at the word. "How can you! Ferdie isn't
  the kind of man who would allow you to be called."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cruthers, the good friend and former schoolmate of Poggy Bannett, was
  dressing for dinner when Poggy was announced. He was as a rule an early
  riser, and seldom missed his luncheon, but today, there being no racing and
  no daily newspapers and consequently no sin in the world, he had slept on
  until seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't seen Ferdie; his man told my man he was going away; in
  fact, he hasn't been visible since last night."</p>

  <p>"Skulking and sulking," said Poggy. "I've knocked at his door. No answer.
  Naturally! I'm going to get out of your window and walk along the fire
  parapet and have an independent investigation."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind waiting until I've changed my undies?" pleaded his friend.
  "It's so unpleasant with the window open."</p>

  <p>Poggy seated himself with folded arms.</p>

  <p>"I can wait," he said.</p>

  <p>Not until his friend was nearly dressed did he raise the sash and find his
  way along a narrow iron gang-way. Ferdie's bedroom window was open at the
  top; therefore it was openable at the bottom; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>.
  He lifted the sash and stepped in.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie, my boy," he called, "the game's up. Come, come! Don't be
  naughty!"</p>

  <p>Silence answered him. He switched on the light. The bedroom was in order.
  The cupboards and wardrobes held no more than made life supportable to a
  gentleman of fashion.</p>

  <p>The dining-saloon had the tidiness of an empty room. Ferdie's slippers
  were before the fire. On the table was a stack of letters of a seasonable
  character. The spare bedroom, the study where Ferdie studied the sporting
  press, the bathroom, box-room, valet's room, pantry, and kitchen were
  empty.</p>

  <p>On the mantlepiece in the dining-room was the framed portrait of a woman,
  a woman of nineteen and a bit. Across the foot was written a message that was
  in no sense maternal. Poggy's brows met. They had not far to go. He felt that
  in a sense he had been deceived. A woman who signs herself " Yours for
  eternity, darling" wasn't being matronly at all. He seized the photograph
  viciously. This he would produce to her embarrassment or relief. At any rate
  it was hardly a fit possession for one who had outlived Letty Revel's
  eternity.</p>

  <p>The lights he extinguished, opened the window, and stepped out. Mr.
  Cruthers's light was also extinguished when he reached the window; the sash
  was fastened also. Mr. Cruthers had probably thought that Poggy would make
  his exit via Ferdie's front door. It seemed the simplest method.</p>

  <p>Poggy considered the matter for a moment. What was wrong with the fire
  escape? He went down the narrow iron staircase, dropped the last few feet
  into the yard, and then an interested spectator came from the shadows.</p>

  <p>"A merry Christmas!" said the stranger. "Coming a little walk along with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" said Poggy. "I don't know you; and I don't want to know
  you. Good evening.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The stranger caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"My name is Sergeant M'Neill, C.I.D., and I shall take you into custody
  for breaking and entering."</p>

  <p>With rare presence of mind, Poggy took the photograph from his pocket and
  dropped it on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the officer of the law, and picked it up. "Been
  collecting art treasures? I've watched you for two hours. Where's your friend
  Ike? I haven't seen him for years."</p>

  <p>At the station:</p>

  <p>"Smith," said Poggy, pale but inventive. The photograph episode was
  damning. And Sergeant M'Neill, who all morning had been pestering him to
  identify the diamond piano, had not recognized him, and the station sergeant
  of the morning was away on leave.</p>

  <p>"John or William?"</p>

  <p>"Haydn," said Poggy musically.</p>

  <p>The gaoler went over him and enumerated his finds. Then, in a state of
  exaltation, Poggy said:</p>

  <p>"I think it is only fair that you should know that my name is Bannett, and
  I am the composer and author of `'Where Shall I Sleep Tonight?'..."</p>

  <p>"The answer is, No. 6!" said the station sergeant.</p>

  <p>Ferdie heard the key turn and the cell door swing open. He sat up,
  interested, and Poggy recoiled at the sight of him.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie!... You here!"</p>

  <p>Ferdie was not surprised.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and make me laugh," he said. "What are you in
  for&mdash;murder?"</p>

  <p>"This is the second case today," said the magistrate awfully, "where a
  prosecutor who should have come forward and identified stolen property has
  failed to realize his responsibilities to the public. The cases have been
  remanded for a fortnight, yet neither Mr. Stevington nor Mr. Bannett have
  appeared to aid the police. I have sent the other man to prison for a month
  as a suspected person; you also will go to prison with hard labor for a
  month, and I warn you..."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A month later they left Pentonville Model Prison together. Ferdie bagged
  the only taxi in sight, and when Poggy reached Portland Place, Letty was
  engaged. He waited an hour. She was still engaged. The footman thought she
  would be engaged for some time.</p>

  <p>Her head of gold floss was on Ferdie's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Two nights later I arrived in Constantinople, despair in my heart. I knew
  I had lost you; there was nothing to live for. Should I dash madly into the
  desert, perhaps never to return!"</p>

  <p>"If you had only cabled!" she breathed. "When Poggy didn't return I knew
  that he dared not face me. Oh, my dearest darling, I didn't dream that you
  would take such awful risks. You will never run away again! I can't bear it!
  Where have you come from now!"</p>

  <p>"Penton Villia&mdash;a suburb of Rome," said Ferdie. "As I was saying, I
  might have joined the dervishes..."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is any use my waiting!" asked Poggy.</p>

  <p>The footman, an honest man, shook his head. The back of the drawing-room
  settee was exactly opposite the keyhole.</p>

     id="story3">III. &mdash; ON THE WITNEY ROAD</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Yes or No</i>, Vol. 61, Dec 1924-May 1925</h3>

  <p class="first">TOM CURTIS said nothing. He fiddled with his bread-knife,
  stared out of the window, apparently absorbed in the phenomena of nature, in
  the gray of flying clouds, in the drunken lurchings of poplars, in everything
  except the enormities of Chesney Blackland. When he did speak, it was to
  remark that it was going to be a real snorter.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said thoughtfully, "that one ought to have a snowy
  Christmas once in forty years to justify the Christmas cards."</p>

  <p>Margaret pressed her lips tightly together, and her fine eyes glittered
  ominously.</p>

  <p>"You're a slug, Tom," she said.</p>

  <p>Tom closed his eyes in patient resignation. He was a slug, and was proud
  of his lowliness. He stood six foot three, was broad in proportion, and had
  little interest in life outside the fluctuations of the industrial market and
  the very excellent pack he hunted in the Cresmore country.</p>

  <p>"There will be no hunting for weeks," he said pathetically.</p>

  <p>"Hunt Everstein," she snapped. He looked at her in mild reproof.</p>

  <p>"Really, Margaret, you're unreasonable," he said. "Everstein has been
  acquitted by a jury of his fellow-countrymen, and there's an end of it. I
  admit he's a poisonous little beast; I'll go so far as to say that if every
  man had his due, Everstein would be breaking coke in Dartmoor &mdash;or
  whatever they break. Which reminds me that I've been asked down to Devonshire
  Hunt on Thursday. It's a pretty sporting country&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Margaret leant back, a picture of despair.</p>

  <p>"I can't get father to see it, but it's little short of a crime &mdash;it
  is a crime&mdash;that this horrible man should be basking in the sunlight at
  Monte Carlo, his wretched pockets filled with our money. I think Mr.
  Blackland is as bad as he. Everstein is a criminal, but at least Mr.
  Blackland has some pretensions to being a gentleman."</p>

  <p>She looked to her father for confirmation, but the Colonel did no more
  than shift uncomfortably in his chair and fidget with his serviette.</p>

  <p>Colonel Robert Curtis had been described as "a beautiful old man." He was
  gentle, sweetnatured, weak. He hated trouble of any kind, and Heaven knows he
  had had trouble enough this past six months; for there had come into his
  life, a little more than two years before, a most plausible financier, with a
  scheme for amalgamating industries, and the Colonel had joined his board.
  Some of the industries were represented by genuine factories which prepared
  and distributed real commodities that people bought, but there were a few
  which were little more than derelict buildings and rusted machinery. They did
  not appear that way on the balance-sheet: they were most important assets,
  and few people realized their utter worthlessness until the crash came and
  Mr. Everstein was arrested.</p>

  <p>The Colonel had been a director of the parent company, and the smash had
  cost him a lot of money. How much, Margaret did not know. She did know that
  after Everstein's arrest her father had taken to his bed, and for three weeks
  had talked brokenly of the ruin which faced him, and had even gone as far as
  inviting an estate agent from Oxford to value Deeplands and its contents. But
  he did not go any further than this: the threatened sale was never held, and
  the only servant dismissed was a chauffeur who disposed of two worn tires
  without his master's permission.</p>

  <p>"Everstein brought father to the very verge of ruin," said Margaret
  tragically. "If father hadn't been able to borrow money from his friends, we
  should have been living in some wretched little villa and owing the landlady
  money."</p>

  <p>"Rot!" said her practical brother. "Suppose Blackland hadn't defended
  Everstein, or suppose he had defended him and Everstein had been sent to jail
  for seven or eight years, what difference would that have made? Chesney is
  one of the best fellows in the world, and anybody but an idiot knows that
  it's the duty of a barrister to defend his client to the best of his ability.
  He would have been a skunk if he hadn't."</p>

  <p>"And you call him a friend of yours" said Margaret witheringly.</p>

  <p>"He's a very good friend and a ripping fine fellow! If you weren't such an
  unreasonable goose, I should have asked him to come over to spend Christmas
  Day with us."</p>

  <p>It needed but this to drive Margaret over the edge of reason. She got up
  and, her hands clutching the cloth, leant over the table towards him.</p>

  <p>"Tommy!" she said intensely. "If you bring Chesney Blackland here, I will
  leave the house! I would not spend an hour under the same roof with him. Have
  you read his speech for the defense?"</p>

  <p>She flung towards the little secretaire which stood in a corner of the
  room, wrenched open a drawer and brought out a folded newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Listen: "'There is no doubt,' counsel went on, 'that Everstein had
  amongst his shareholders some of the most credulous and simple-minded people
  in England. In effect, however, whatever onus attaches to the prisoner from
  that cause is attached also to Everstein's fellow-directors.'"</p>

  <p>She put the paper down and glared at her brother. "In other words," she
  said deliberately, "this wretched man said that father was as big a thief as
  Everstein... and this reptile is your friend!"</p>

  <p>Tom rubbed his nose and looked at his father. That aristocratic gentleman
  shook his head and closed his eyes, as though he could not bear either the
  contemplation of his son or the thought of Blackland's enormity.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, counsel have got to say all sorts of things," said Tom stoutly.
  "It's silly to bear malice against a barrister for what he's said in the
  defense of a&mdash;" He fizzled out lamely.</p>

  <p>"If you dare ask Chesney Blackland here, Tom, I will never forgive you."
  She pointed a minatory finger at the big young man. "Father would forgive
  him, of course, because father forgives everybody, and he's a Christian and
  all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"It's Christmas time," murmured Tom.</p>

  <p>"It would make no difference to me if it were August Bank Holiday," said
  Margaret. "If you bring Mr. Blackland to Deeplands, I will go out. I would
  rather die than be in the same room with him. He has slandered father, he has
  let this scoundrel loose upon society, he is worse than Everstein himself;
  and if you had any self-respect you would write to him and tell him just what
  you think of him."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned. "Why not send him a Christmas card and write all these
  admirable sentiments on the back?" he demanded, and Margaret shivered at his
  vulgarity.</p>

  <p>She had to go into her father's study soon after breakfast to consult him
  about the following day's arrangements. The Colonel stood with his back to
  the fire, a pipe in his mouth, a look of settled gloom on his fine-cut
  face.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should bother Tommy about this man Blackland if I were
  you," he said. "Blackland's really a nice fellow. Didn't you meet him when
  you were up at Cambridge last May week?"</p>

  <p>She gazed at him blankly. "The thing is finished and done with," her
  father went on hurriedly. "I see no advantage in bearing malice. We shall
  &mdash;er&mdash;battle through. Blackland was a good fellow: I liked
  him."</p>

  <p>Colonel Curtis was one of those fortunate people who can convey the most
  subtle of expressions by an innuendo. You never realized that he had enemies
  until he forgave them. He had borne his troubles bravely and silently, and
  Margaret had not realized how badly he was hit until there came the valuer
  with his notebook, examining legs of chairs and weighing the silver on the
  palm of his hand. It is true that the legs of the chairs were still planted
  on the carpets of Deeplands, and that the silver graced the table at every
  meal, but the atmosphere of near ruin was established.</p>

  <p>The Colonel had never complained about Everstein's duplicity or
  Blackland's treachery, but in those simple words, "Blackland was a good
  fellow: I liked him," she read the Colonel's crushing disappointment when he
  had discovered that this good fellow whom he liked had stood up in a crowded
  court and had basely hinted that Everstein was not alone in his guilt. And
  Margaret loathed Chesney Blackland more than ever.</p>

  <p>"You will be in this afternoon, Margaret?" said the Colonel, changing the
  subject. "I have asked the Walshes to come over, and I thought we might have
  a rubber of bridge."</p>

  <p>Margaret shook her head. "Tom can make a fourth," she said. "I am going to
  drive over to Cheltenham to see old Mrs. Gurney and take her Christmas
  present."</p>

  <p>The Colonel's face fell.</p>

  <p>"The post, of course, is gone&mdash;it might have been sent direct from
  the shop&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to take it myself, Father," said Margaret decisively; and when she
  spoke in that tone of voice, the Colonel seldom opposed her.</p>

  <p>She had intended going that morning, but old Mrs. Gurney's woolen coat did
  not arrive until after lunch; and by the time she had packed the little
  hamper with the whisky, and the plum pudding, and the body of a cockerel
  slaughtered that morning, it was three o'clock.</p>

  <p>Tom, who had taken his gun out on to the Priory fields, came into the hall
  as she was making her preparations for departure. He was sheeted white from
  head to foot.</p>

  <p>"It's snowing like the dickens," he said. And then, as she was fastening
  her coat: "You're never going out in this weather?" he added in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"I'm running over to Cheltenham," replied Margaret, with that note of
  finality which as a rule suspended all argument.</p>

  <p>"You're driving to Cheltenham in that wretched thing?" Tom's blue hands
  pointed to the two-seater at the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," said Margaret. "You don't imagine a little snow will
  stop me?"</p>

  <p>Tom walked out into the road and looked up at the skies, which were filled
  now with whirling white specks.</p>

  <p>"You really oughtn't to go, Margaret," he remonstrated. "Send Downes
  over&mdash;or, if you must go now, let me drive you. You'll get snowed up as
  sure as fate."</p>

  <p>"It will be even more certain if a fat man like you is in the car," she
  said, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be helpful, put that hamper and parcel into the boot."</p>

  <p>As she settled herself in the little car and drew a fur rug over her
  knees, she raised a warning finger to Tom.</p>

  <p>"I'm very serious about Chesney Blackland," she said, "and if you have
  some Machiavellian plan for bringing him here tomorrow"&mdash;Tom wriggled
  uncomfortably&mdash;"I want you to alter your plan, Tommy: if he comes here,
  I shall go to town and spend Christmas Day with the Readings."</p>

  <p>"Beastly prejudice," muttered Tom, and from his guilty demeanor she
  guessed that she had not been far wide of the mark when she suggested that he
  had already formed a plan for inviting the hateful Blackland.</p>

  <p>She smiled triumphantly as she sent the little car down the snowy drive
  and turned on to the Witney Road. The hood of the machine was raised, but the
  snow blew persistently under the canvas, and although her tiny electric
  screen-wiper worked frantically, it was difficult to see more than a few
  yards ahead, and that through a blurred surface.</p>

  <p>The road was fairly good, and the car held its way without any more than
  an occasional skid, and she came through the deserted streets of gloomy
  Witney in excellent time. She had left the town and was climbing up on to the
  plateau which separates Witney from Cheltenham when she experienced her first
  sense of misgiving. It was nearly dusk. The storm had abated just before she
  reached Witney, and there was little or no wind, but the snow was falling
  thicker than ever, and once she plunged into a drift which lay athwart the
  road. It was not very formidable: the bonnet of the car sent the fine powdery
  snow flying, and she was through almost, before she realized she had hit an
  obstruction.</p>

  <p>Her spirits rose when she came on to a stretch of road which was almost
  free of snow, being protected by a belt of trees which ran for half a mile
  along the roadside; but her satisfaction was shortlived. Dipping down into a
  valley, she met a recrudescence of the storm, and she slowed almost to a
  crawl, for now it was absolutely impossible even to see the road, and she
  could only guess her position by observing the stone wall which marked the
  boundary of a farm on her right.</p>

  <p>It grew dark with surprising suddenness, and, looking at her watch, she
  saw with dismay that it was past four o'clock. Where she was she could only
  guess, but the road she followed went downhill and that did not seem right.
  Presently she came to a place where another road joined that on which she was
  traveling, and, getting down from her seat, she plodded to a sign-post, the
  face of which was so covered with snow as to be indecipherable. Taking her
  umbrella from the car, she managed to clean the face of the indicator, and
  her jaw dropped in consternation. She was on the wrong road: by following the
  stone wall she had been led miles out of her track.</p>

  <p>Margaret took counsel with herself and decided that the only sane thing to
  do was to return to Oxford. She got into the car and backed up the road,
  intending to return on her tracks. But to come downhill was one thing, to go
  back up that long and tiring slope was another. She had accomplished less
  than a third of her journey when the car struck. She must continue along the
  wrong track, hoping to work her way back to the main road.</p>

  <p>Hers was a very small machine, ordinarily easy to turn, but in thick snow
  the smallest of motor-cars becomes a little unmanageable. Backing to the
  hedge to give herself room to turn, she suddenly felt the wheels sinking, and
  before she could reverse, the back part of the car settled gracefully into a
  ditch.</p>

  <p>"Blow!" said Margaret.</p>

  <p>She might have said something stronger, but it was very dark and she felt
  rather frightened. She felt that this was not the moment for profanity.
  Nearly a mile farther on she had passed a small lodge and a pair of big
  gates, suggesting that somewhere behind the pine and the laurel was a human
  habitation. With what philosophy she could summon she trudged up the hill,
  slipping and sliding in the snow, and came, hot and weary, to the lodge
  gates.</p>

  <p>The lodge proved to be empty; but the iron gates opened readily, and she
  followed a serpentine path which led her at last to a white lawn that
  stretched before a small Elizabethan mansion. She sighed with relief when she
  saw a light glowing in one of the windows, and with great labor made her slow
  way across the lawn and knocked on the old-fashioned double door.</p>

  <p>It was immediately opened by a middle-aged woman, obviously, from her
  sedate alpaca and her trim lace cap, the housekeeper. In a few words Margaret
  explained her predicament.</p>

  <p>"Come in, miss," said the housekeeper. "I will send a man down to get your
  car. Why, you're wet through!"</p>

  <p>Margaret gazed ruefully at her sodden feet. "You have a telephone
  here?"</p>

  <p>She saw the instrument standing on a table in the wide, flagged hall. "I
  want to telephone to my people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The housekeeper shook her head. "I'm afraid, miss, the line must have
  broken. The master was talking to a gentleman in Oxford a quarter of an hour
  ago when he was cut off. But you must change, miss. I will see Mr. John."</p>

  <p>She disappeared through an open door, and Margaret had a glimpse of a cozy
  library, the lights of which she had seen from the drive. There was a murmur
  of voices, and the housekeeper came back.</p>

  <p>"Will you come this way, miss?"</p>

  <p>She led the way up the broad stairs and opened the door into a comfortable
  bedroom, which was obviously a man's room, for she saw certain striped
  garments folded on the bed.</p>

  <p>"I may be able to get you some silk stockings, miss, but I'm afraid I
  can't give you anything better than the maid's shoes. We have no lady in the
  house," she said. "Mr. John is a bachelor."</p>

  <p>There was a bright fire burning, and before this Margaret changed as many
  of her garments as were necessary, accepting the unknown maid's skirt and
  stockings with gratitude. She strolled to the open casement window, and by
  the light which streamed from the room she saw that the snow was still
  falling heavily.</p>

  <p>The housekeeper, who had been to make inquiries, returned with somewhat
  disconcerting news.</p>

  <p>"There is no possibility of a car getting away from here tonight, miss,"
  she said. "Mr. John will send the gardener to the nearest telephone with any
  message you wish to send to your parents."</p>

  <p>Margaret gazed at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that I shan't be able to get away from here
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>The housekeeper shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, miss, I'm afraid you won't," she said. "The roads are quite
  impassable and it's still snowing."</p>

  <p>"But I must!" insisted Margaret. "I simply can't stay here... in a
  bachelor's house."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> stay in a bachelor's house, miss," said the middle-aged lady,
  with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know. But don't you see&mdash;" began Margaret. And then the
  absurdity of the situation struck her and she laughed. "I'm afraid you and
  Mr. John will think I'm very ungrateful," she said. "I'll write a
  message."</p>

  <p>She scribbled a note to her father, headed with the telephone number, and
  then: "But I can't stay here: this is Mr. John's own room, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"I'm having a room made ready for you, miss," nodded the housekeeper, "and
  Mr. John has asked me whether you would like to come down to tea."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to come down, if only to thank him," she said. "Will you send
  this message?"</p>

  <p>She handed the paper to the woman, who went away and came back almost
  immediately to announce that tea was waiting.</p>

  <p>A slim man, soberly attired, rose as she entered the library. He might
  have been thirty, but might as easily have been forty. He was very tall, with
  a slight stoop, and her first impression of him was that he was rather
  goodlooking. She guessed, from his preter-natural solemnity, that he was a
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"I ought to bless the snow for bringing me a visitor, Miss Curtis," he
  said. (He had rather a charming smile, she thought.) "But I expect at this
  moment you are hardly sharing my view?"</p>

  <p>"I am not," she said frankly. "Is it really impossible for me to get away
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it is," he answered, with a return to his grave manner. "I
  have sent a man out to telephone to your people, and I can only hope that the
  snow will stop falling, and that tomorrow morning we shall be able to get you
  back to Oxford. In the meantime, are you partial to muffins?"</p>

  <p>He raised the lid of a dish, and Margaret, who by this time was very
  hungry, speared a crisp brown morsel to her plate.</p>

  <p>"Do you live here alone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I usually spend winter in Switzerland," he said, "but this
  year my work has kept me at home. You see, the Christmas vacation is a very
  short one."</p>

  <p>She put down her cup. "Are you a lawyer?" she asked, and he laughed softly
  at the dismay in her voice.</p>

  <p>"You don't like lawyers?"</p>

  <p>"I like some lawyers," she admitted, and adroitly he turned the
  conversation into another channel.</p>

  <p>It was a jolly little house. She could quite understand that even solitude
  had a charm in these paneled, low-ceilinged rooms. Once or twice between tea
  and dinner she sounded him about her <i>bête noir</i>, but Mr. John skilfully
  evaded discussion of Chesney Blackland and his villainous deeds.</p>

  <p>It was after dinner; they were sitting before the log fire in the library,
  she in one deep armchair, he in another, when&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you know Chesney Blackland?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Mr. John, do you know Chesney Blackland?"</p>

  <p>"You don't like him?" said the lean-faced man, looking into the fire. "And
  yet, he likes you rather a lot. He once saw you, though he never spoke to
  you, and carried the memory in his heart for years and years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You do know him?" She sat up.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the man quietly; "I am Chesney Blackland."</p>

  <p>Margaret gasped.</p>

  <p>"Then you&mdash;you told them to call you Mr. John... to deceive
  me..."</p>

  <p>She was on her feet now. "No; I am Mr. John to Mrs. Buckingham. My name is
  John Chesney Blackland."</p>

  <p>She was looking down at him with a deep frown.</p>

  <p>"I am very grateful to you for your hospitality," she said stiffly, "and I
  can only regret that I have given you so much trouble."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" he asked, jumping up as she moved to the door.</p>

  <p>"To get my coat, and then I'm going to walk back to Witney," she said.</p>

  <p>In two strides he was between her and the door.</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," he said violently. "Why, it is madness!
  You will be caught in the storm: you haven't a ghost of a chance of getting
  back!"</p>

  <p>"I am going to Witney," she said steadily. "Will you please let me pass?"
  And then, in a sudden burst of resentment: "I would rather die than remain in
  the same house with you, Mr. Blackland! You have insulted my father, you have
  helped a blackguard to escape justice. I hate you!"</p>

  <p>For a second she saw the bleakness in his eyes and shivered.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind your hatred," he said in a low voice, "but I cannot allow
  you to leave this house."</p>

  <p>"But if I insist?"</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"Will you please let me pass?"</p>

  <p>For answer he pointed to the chair before the fire. "You may go, of
  course, but before you go I want to tell you something that apparently you do
  not know."</p>

  <p>"Nothing you can say will alter my view, Mr. Blackland&mdash;" she
  began.</p>

  <p>"At least I am entitled to a hearing," he interrupted. "I cannot prevent
  your leaving this house. I suppose you would make it so unpleasant that I had
  no other course. But if you go, I must accompany you, whatever be the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"If I go, I go alone."</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"At least you will allow me to tell you the secret that lay behind the
  Everstein case?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "Nothing you could say would convince me&mdash;" she began
  irresolutely, and then, to her own amazement, went back to the chair she had
  vacated.</p>

  <p>"May I smoke?" He filled a pipe from a silver box, lit the tobacco
  carefully, and, settling down in his chair, puffed for a moment or two, his
  eyes fixed on the blazing logs.</p>

  <p>"The man you call Everstein is my brother," he began, and her eyes opened
  wide.</p>

  <p>"Your brother?" incredulously.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But he is a Swiss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Swiss, too," said Chesney Blackland. "Isaac Everstein is my brother,
  though I am not proud of the relationship. He is a swindler! I knew him to be
  a swindler. But he has a child&mdash;she is in the house at this moment."</p>

  <p>"Here?" He nodded again.</p>

  <p>"A sensitive girl of fifteen, who had no illusions about her father, and
  yet loved him passionately. By some mischance she learnt that Isaac was under
  arrest, and the shock nearly killed her. Had he been sent to penal
  servitude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I know you hate me," he went on. "Your brother was on the telephone to me
  a few minutes ago: I was coming over to spend Christmas in your house. I
  suppose you didn't know that? It was a scheme of Tom's, who knew you disliked
  me, but thought that if we met, you might modify your point of view. I
  defended my brother, and was prepared to involve any person in the world
  rather than that he should be sent to prison. If you ask me whether I like
  him, I reply that he is utterly loathsome to me. I should not have turned a
  hair if he had been sent to the scaffold. But all the time I was pleading in
  that fusty court, I had one thought and one thought only&mdash;the child,
  stretched upon a bed of pain, who was waiting, waiting.. dreading the sound
  of the telephone bell..."</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly. Margaret was listening open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"But nobody knew this?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "You are the first person I have ever told."</p>

  <p>"And the child?"</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"She is slowly recovering. The trial will have left its mark upon
  her&mdash;that is natural. But imagine, Miss Curtis, what would have been the
  consequence if&mdash;Isaac had been sent to penal servitude for a term of
  years?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Margaret, and on the impulse of her emotion leant
  forward and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>He shrank back at the touch.</p>

  <p>"No, no, please don't sympathize with me," he said, as he rose quickly,
  and she thought she understood.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I've been such a fool. Won't you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>She held out her hand and he took it.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you will forgive me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course. And now you can teach me picquet, as you promised: I am
  quite sane. May I see your little niece?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She will not be fit to see visitors for many weeks," he said gravely.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Margaret was wakened from a dreamless sleep by a hideous view-halloa from
  the garden below, and, jumping out of bed, she ran to the window and looked
  down. It was Tom, and, standing before the porch of the house, was an old
  victoria and the four horses that he had hired from a livery stable. Snow had
  ceased to fall; the world lay under a thick carpet of white.</p>

  <p>"Merry Christmas!" yelled Tom. "Can't you get down and let me in? Nobody
  seems to be up in this establishment."</p>

  <p>In ten minutes she was dressed and downstairs, but one of the servants had
  already opened the door, and Tom was warming his chilled hands before a
  hastily kindled fire.</p>

  <p>"How do you like Chesney?" asked Tom. "You did stay under the same roof,
  after all, old girl."</p>

  <p>She raised her hand in quiet protest. "I know a little more about Mr.
  Blackland than I did," she said. "I'm afraid I was rather uncharitable."</p>

  <p>"He's a nice-looking fellow," said Tom. "What about having him over for
  dinner tonight?"</p>

  <p>Margaret had already decided that her uncharitable ban should be lifted,
  and her invitation to "Mr. John" had been given and accepted.</p>

  <p>"The governor's worried to death about you," said Tom. "He made me get up
  in the dark and commandeer this old bus to bring you back to civilization.
  Hullo, Chesney!"</p>

  <p>Chesney was coming downstairs in his dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>"I've got to rush my sister back to Oxford: the Colonel is all nerves
  about her," said Tom. "No, no, I won't stop to breakfast. Something hot to
  drink, and a bite for the young lady..."</p>

  <p>Coffee and rolls were forthcoming almost immediately. They stood before
  the hall fire talking, Tom apparently oblivious to the signs Which his host
  had given him, until, in desperation, Chesney Blackland said: "I'd like to
  see you for a moment before you go, Tom. Will you come into the library?"</p>

  <p>"Not now, old boy," pleaded Tom, putting down the cup. "You're coming over
  to dinner&mdash;I must get back: there's some more snow coming."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to tell you&mdash;" said Chesney, but Tom was out in the open,
  giving directions to the ancient driver of this extemporized four-in-hand.
  "We dine at seven, but you'll come to tea," said Margaret, as she held out
  her hand with a smile. "And you really do forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering whether you're going to forgive me," groaned Chesney
  Blackland, as he took her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"For what? You mean, for the things you said about father? Of course!"</p>

  <p>There was a roaring invitation from Tom outside, and the girl hurried into
  the victoria. The flakes were beginning to fall again, and there was reason
  for hurry, Tom explained, as they began their climb to the Witney Road.</p>

  <p>"If we can make Witney we shall be all right, but the road is rather like
  High Street, Siberia."</p>

  <p>To their intense relief, they reached the main road without mishap, and in
  a quarter of an hour Witney lay beneath them, a gray, cheerless town in a
  hollow.</p>

  <p>"That's a quaint place of old Chesney's," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"It's a very pretty house: has he had it long?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Lord, yes," said Tom, lighting a cigarette with some difficulty. "It's
  been in the family hundreds of years. It was a gift from King Charles to one
  of the Blacklands."</p>

  <p>Margaret's pretty face came round, the picture of amazement.</p>

  <p>"A gift of King Charles? But they're not English: his brother
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped. Obviously Tom was not interested in Blackland's
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"His brother!" scoffed Tom. "Why, he never had a brother. I knew the
  family: I was with Chesney at Eton."</p>

  <p>The girl did not speak till they were clear of Witney, and then:</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"What about? About Chesney? Why, of course I'm sure. Old man Blackland
  only had one son and five daughters."</p>

  <p>"What nationality was Mr. Everstein?" she asked, with outward calm.</p>

  <p>"He was a Swiss Jew."</p>

  <p>With an effort Margaret controlled her voice. "Has he any children?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Fourteen, I am told."</p>

  <p>"Will you stop the carriage? I want to walk a little way," she said
  unsteadily.</p>

  <p>Tom roared a direction to the driver and got out, a very much perplexed
  man.</p>

  <p>"Now what on earth&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Tom," she said, when they had walked some little distance from the
  victoria, "you must send to Mr. Blackland and tell him he cannot come to the
  house."</p>

  <p>"Great Moses!" he gasped. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;he is a liar! Oh, the brute, the brute! To play on my
  feelings..."</p>

  <p>Bit by bit the story came out. Tom listened, and, to the girl's surprise,
  did not laugh.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a lie," said Tom. "Chesney has no brothers. Of course, he
  told you that story to prevent you from making a fool of yourself, as you
  undoubtedly would have done."</p>

  <p>"He's hateful!" she stormed.</p>

  <p>Tom shook his head. "He's not so hateful as you think, Margaret," he said
  quietly. "And now I'm going to tell you the truth. What he said about father
  was true."</p>

  <p>She stared at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"Father was in the Everstein swindle right up to his neck," Tom went on.
  "He was a party to the faking of the balance-sheet, and it was only by a
  fluke that he didn't stand in the dock with Everstein."</p>

  <p>She was white and shaking now.</p>

  <p>"Is that true" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Tom nodded.</p>

  <p>"When Everstein was sent for trial, and Blockland went to Brixton Gaol for
  consultation, Everstein told Chesney the truth, and said that if he was
  convicted he'd bring down father... that he wasn't going to suffer alone. And
  Chesney played the game: he came to see me and told me this. Of course, it
  was no use telling the governor; anyway, he was in bed, sick with
  fright."</p>

  <p>"But why did&mdash;Chesney&mdash;take all that trouble?" she asked
  unsteadily.</p>

  <p>Tom's reply was rather like Tom, frank to the point of brutality.</p>

  <p>"Because he saw you a few years ago, and, like a chump, fell in love with
  you. That's the truth! Chesney was unscrupulous in his defense: it was the
  talk of the Bar. But he fought like a demon to save Everstein from
  conviction, because he knew father would be involved, and, through father,
  you."</p>

  <p>The snow was falling heavily now. She looked back to the old victoria and
  the steaming horses. "He is a liar, anyway," she said, as she walked slowly
  towards the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Tom, will there be any shops open in Oxford this morning?" she asked, as
  the victoria bowled along the homeward road.</p>

  <p>"There may be: why?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to buy a present&mdash;for Chesney Blackland's niece," she said,
  with pleasant malice.</p>

  <h2><a name="story4"
     id="story4">IV. &mdash; MOTHER O' MINE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Royal Magazine</i>, March 1920</h3>

  <p class="first">THEY called Ian Cranford "Iron" Cranford.</p>

  <p>Lest it be thought that the employees of the Cranford Manufacturing
  Corporation were possessed of the sense of poetry, or that they bestowed a
  romantical and even heroic nickname upon their managing director because they
  loved and admired him, it may be explained that there was about this time
  another and a more public "Ian," a popular figure in London boxing circles
  who was also addressed as "Iron," less as a tribute to his robust
  constitution than in the exercise of the Cockneys' immemorial right to give
  any pronunciation he chooses to any word he employs.</p>

  <p>And Ian Cranford was not beloved. He was likewise called by other
  names.</p>

  <p>A girl, red of face and trembling with suppressed wrath, came out of
  Cranford's private office, and slammed the door behind her. Six pairs of
  youthful eyes surveyed her in joyous anticipation. The seventh pair of eyes
  did not look up from the note she was transcribing, and her typewriter,
  alone, clattered and clicked through the buzz of eager inquiry and heated
  reply which followed.</p>

  <p>"If he thinks he's gotta slave to deal with," said the red-faced girl as
  she banged the cover down on her typewriter, "he's made a mistake so far as
  I'm concerned! I ses to him, 'If a young lady can't take a day off when her
  head's splitting so that she could get a doctor's certificate for the asking,
  you'd better get somebody else!' 'Oh,' he ses, in his sarcastic way, 'and is
  it necessary to take the 9.55 for Brighton to cure your headache? I happened
  to see you getting in the train.' 'Well,' I ses, 'if I can't go down to
  Brighton and see my poor dear mother, it's pretty hard,' I ses. 'You can go
  and live with your poor dear mother at the end of the week,' he ses. 'I'll go
  now,' I ses, 'and as for you, you can go to hell!' I ses."</p>

  <p>A most gratifying chorus of admiring gasps.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, you can go to hell!' I ses. That's the way to treat 'em," said the
  red-faced girl, with trembling pride. "There's no other way for fellers like
  that! He hasn't got a heart, that Iron Cranford; he's not human! If ever I
  tell my young man the things he said to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sudden and violent rattle of space-bars and six fluffy heads dropped, as
  though at the word of a drill sergeant, over six banks of complicated keys. A
  man stood in the doorway of the private office, the type of man who wears
  rough blue serge, soft loose collars, and smokes a straight, short pipe. He
  was nearing the forties, with gray at the temple, hard-jawed and resentful of
  eye.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you gone?"</p>

  <p>His voice had a snap and a bite which sent shivers down six young
  spines.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't gone yet, Mr. Cranford," said the girl in a milder tone
  than might have been expected.</p>

  <p>She was all for a dignified exit, but her knees wobbled annoyingly.</p>

  <p>"I am going when&mdash;I am going when&mdash;" she choked.</p>

  <p>"You are going when you please, I suppose?" said the man in the doorway.
  "You should worry about me, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>There was no mirth in his "ha, ha1" but a hint of sardonic laughter.</p>

  <p>"Now, you girls!"</p>

  <p>Six backs straightened to attention, the seventh was still bent over the
  machine, though her hands were idle.</p>

  <p>"I am firing Miss Wilkinson, as she has probably told you," said Cranford.
  "You ought to be told the reason I am discharging her. It is not because she
  took a day off; any girl can take a day off if she has a headache. I am
  sending her away because she lied, and because on Saturday morning I saw her
  in company with a type of man with whom I do not want any of the girls in
  this office to associate."</p>

  <p>Miss Wilkinson's trembling became a visible ripple of wrath. It was a
  ripple which swayed her shoulders and her head and produced an alarming
  elongation of neck.</p>

  <p>"Be careful what you're saying!" she shrilled. "You take people's
  character away, and you can be had up in the court. You&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get on with your work," said Cranford shortly. "Miss Glynn!"</p>

  <p>The seventh stenographer rose at his nod, gathered her notebook and
  pencil, and followed him into the office. She was a slight, pretty girl,
  rather white of face and tired of eye. There were some in the office who
  feared Ian Cranford. Some perverted souls who adored for the very reputation
  of brutality which was his. Some, like the shivering Miss Wilkinson, who
  alternately loathed and fawned upon him. But Doris Glynn, his confidential
  secretary, alone hated him consistently and silently.</p>

  <p>She never joined in the chorus of abuse, which at intervals rose against
  him; she never identified herself with those informal services of absolution
  that followed some act of justice on the part of Ian Cranford, which bore the
  appearance of generosity.</p>

  <p>She hated him for all that he was, and all that he had. She hated him for
  his undeviating ruthlessness because he kept to his way, walking down the
  strong and the weak who stood between him and his objective. And mostly she
  hated him for what he would some day think of her.</p>

  <p>She sat meekly by his desk, her notebook on her knees, and Ian Cranford
  stroked his trim moustache thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Wilkinson is keeping bad company," he said. He always referred to the
  girls by their surnames, another abominable practice of his. "She is a poor,
  brainless, flighty fool, without a single decent instinct which I have been
  able to discover."</p>

  <p>He scratched his big jaw, then he reached for the telephone and gave a
  number, which she recognized as police headquarters.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to Mr. Holding," he said; and after a minute's silence,
  "That you, Holding? It's Cranford speaking. You remember that long-firm man,
  Sawerson, who runs fake selling-agencies and did a term in jail some time
  ago... you remember him? Good. Well, he's taken up with a girl in this office
  whom I have just dismissed. A Miss Wilkinson, I will send you her address.
  She had access to my list of customers, and I should say that was what he is
  after."</p>

  <p>Evidently the man at the other end of the wire asked a question concerning
  Miss Wilkinson, whose complaining voice was still audible through the closed
  door of the office.</p>

  <p>"No, no, she is nothing," said Cranford. "Just a Nothing. She hasn't the
  brains to be a crook. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver and swung round to the waiting girl.</p>

  <p>"Now, we'll get on with that correspondence with Mrs. Bristow," he said.
  "Write to Harbury and instruct to call in all the mortgages on the quarries.
  I hear that Mother's darling son has been sent down from College and has
  arrived home with a sackful of unreceipted bills."</p>

  <p>He stared down at his desk awhile, then:</p>

  <p>"I shall never ruin Mrs. Bristow," he said, "nor pierce her of her
  colossal vanity."</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I want to ruin her anyway," he said. "I merely want
  to&mdash;" He stopped. "That woman had had too much money anyway."</p>

  <p>The girl made no reply, merely jotting down a note in her book; then
  suddenly, and to her surprise, he said: "I understand you are married
  &mdash;Mrs. Glynn?" She was taken aback for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I have been married," she said quietly. "I am a widow."</p>

  <p>He frowned at her.</p>

  <p>"Any children?"</p>

  <p>"One," she said, her anger rising.</p>

  <p>His frown grew deeper.</p>

  <p>"You are very young. Why didn't you tell me you were married when you
  came? Why did you call yourself Miss Glynn? There was no need to lie about
  it."</p>

  <p>"I didn't lie about it," she said hotly. "I was only married for a
  year&mdash;somehow I never think of myself as married."</p>

  <p>She might have added that that year was the most wretched year of her
  life. The street accident which ended the life of her drunkard husband was
  the only happy memory of three hundred and eighty days of purgatory
  &mdash;she used to count the days.</p>

  <p>"Some employers do not like married women in their offices," she went on,
  more calmly, "especially young married women, and that is why, when I was
  addressed as Miss by your cashier, I did not correct him."</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, and as she rose:</p>

  <p>"I am going down to South Devon in the morning."</p>

  <p>She listened, holding her breath. "Come to me before I go for the key of
  my safe. The tender for the Shaftesbury Power House must be delivered
  personally at five minutes to twelve, not a minute before or a minute later,
  to the architects at Winchester House. They are received up to twelve
  o'clock, but you ought to allow yourself five minutes in case of accidents.
  Not before, you understand? I don't trust that architect of theirs, and he'll
  be tipping off our price to somebody else if he gets it too soon. You'll find
  it in the bottom drawer in the safe."</p>

  <p>She nodded, and again made a note in her book.</p>

  <p>"Benson leaves for Rio in the afternoon: give him three hundred pounds in
  banknotes; you'll find them in the same drawer. Note the numbers and get a
  receipt. Remind him to telegraph... Send Wilkinson's address to Inspector
  Holding, New Scotland Yard..." He fired a dozen other instructions before he
  dismissed her with his curt nod, and she went back to her desk with the last
  of her qualms seared out of existence.</p>

  <p>He was not human, there was nothing human about him. His talk of Mrs.
  Bristow, that aged widow whom she had once seen in the office... A pompous,
  white-haired lady, insolent it is true, but still a woman&mdash;and an old
  woman. His lighthearted blackening of poor Lilly Wilkinson's character, his
  slander about an architect&mdash;these things were as a tonic to strengthen
  her in her resolve.</p>

  <p>She hated him, she hated him! She wanted to hate him more. She could not
  hate him enough. For hatred was a narcotic which was to deaden the pain and
  drown a voice that whispered "No, no no!" all the day and all the night.</p>

  <p>The office staff was allowed an hour for lunch&mdash;no more and no less.
  Doris Glynn alone was given an extra half-hour, that being the additional
  time which Cranford allowed himself. The half-hour was especially desirable
  today, and she permitted herself the unaccustomed luxury of a taxi-cab. She
  had to get from the city to Devonshire Street by a quarter-past one. Of
  course, she could have asked for extra time, but the idea of making such a
  request to Cranford was in itself abhorrent.</p>

  <p>She reached the house of the great chest specialist at the same minute as
  a woman turned the corner of the street, leading a little boy by the hand,
  and Doris walked toward them with a smiling welcome for the child.</p>

  <p>"It is awfully good of you to come, Mrs. Thomas. I don't think I could
  have got home in time."</p>

  <p>The motherly woman with the child arrested the flow of thanks with a bluff
  "Nonsense!" and together they walked up the steps and passed into the
  specialist's house and into the gloomy waiting-room. He did not detain them
  very long. Presently a nurse came in and beckoned the mother and child, and
  they followed into Sir George Crisly's consulting-room.</p>

  <p>The specialist shook hands with the girl and led the boy to the window,
  scrutinizing him sharply.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Glynn, when are you going?" he asked. She was fidgeting with
  her handkerchief, and started as he spoke. "I&mdash;I don't know," she
  stammered. "I have the passports&mdash;thank you, doctor, for getting those
  for me. I shall never be able to repay you for your great kindness. Do you
  really, really think that a year will make all that difference to the
  boy?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I not only think, but know," he said. "Of course the child is
  very young to have a crisis, but undoubtedly he is in that pathological
  condition when the next twelve months will make all the difference in the
  world to his future health. There is undoubtedly a dispostion to
  tuberculosis. The mountain air is absolutely certain to destroy that tendency
  and give him something to build up on. I suggest Argentière because the air
  there is particularly good for such cases. There are nice <i>pensions</i>
  where you will be able to live very cheaply, and the journey is an easy one."
  He smiled. "I think you are exceedingly fortunate in being able to go at all.
  So few people have saved their money as you have against a rainy day."</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly, and had he looked at her closely he would have seen her
  bosom rising and falling as though she found a difficulty in breathing.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind telling you, now that you have decided to go," Sir George
  went on, "that to have lived in England would have killed your boy."</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes, and he walked quickly to her side and took her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry; I thought you knew," he said gently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I knew, doctor," she smiled bravely. "Of course I knew, only I
  wouldn't let myself know, if you understand."</p>

  <p>"I think I do," said he. "Anyway, you've nothing to worry about now."</p>

  <p>He turned to the child and patted him on the head.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, little man," he said. "Come along and see me in twelve months'
  time and I shan't know you!"</p>

  <p>The girl waited until the child and his motherly guardian had turned the
  corner before she began her walk in search of a cab to take her back to the
  office. She was numb with fear, with apprehension, with doubts, but the
  greatest doubt of all had vanished. No longer could she hesitate or allow any
  false ideals to stand in her way.</p>

  <p>At parting she had made her final preparations. For a small sum paid
  weekly the goodnatured Mrs. Thomas, who occupied an apartment on the same
  floor in the tenement where Doris had her home, took charge of the small boy
  during the day. She was to bring the child and the two portmanteaux, already
  packed, to Waterloo Station that night in time to catch the Havre boat-train.
  Doris had allowed herself two hours to do what she had to do. She closed her
  eyes tight, with a little wince of pain, as she thought of what those two
  hours would hold.</p>

  <p>Passports, time-tables, tickets, little notes on the route, all these were
  in her bag. She would tell Mrs. Thomas that she was going to Italy, and had
  already hinted as much to her.</p>

  <p>That afternoon the office was purgatory to her. She was filled with an
  immense sense of desolation and loneliness. It was as though she was living
  in another and a more enviable world, and she did envy these light-hearted
  girls with homes of their own, mothers and fathers who cared for them and
  would worry about them if they were late. She envied their freedom from care,
  their silly chatter about boys and clothes. Somehow the office appeared in a
  more pleasant light than she had ever viewed it, a more homelike place than
  she had ever dreamed it could be, and she was amazed to discover the tears
  rising to her eyes at the thought that she would not again see this big
  prosaic room with its rows of desks. Cranford was out until half-past three,
  and he came back more truculent than ever. He dictated three slashing
  letters, a bite in every line: one to his works' manager at Bletchley, one to
  the solicitor of the unfortunate Mrs. Bristow, and a third to a second
  solicitor, no less than the advocate chosen by the discharged Miss Wilkinson
  to vindicate her character.</p>

  <p>"Delivered by hand, was it?" he growled. "I know the solicitor, a dirty
  little police-court practitioner. A decent man wouldn't have had the time to
  sit down and write straight away. Sue me for slander, will she! Huh I take
  this...!"</p>

  <p>Her pencil flew over the paper, and there was need for speed, for when Ian
  Cranford was annoyed he spoke very quickly. She was in the midst of taking a
  milder correspondence when he stopped and said suddenly:</p>

  <p>"That passport..."</p>

  <p>It seemed that her heart stopped beating. She could only stare at him
  open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Passport?" she managed to say at last.</p>

  <p>She was as white as death, but he was not looking at her.</p>

  <p>"That diplomatic passport which I received from the Government during the
  war," he said, "you are to return that to the Foreign Office. I am not
  engaged on Government business in France now, and there is no need of it.
  Remind me tomorrow that I return it."</p>

  <p>She could have swooned with relief. As it was, her limbs felt like water
  and her mouth and throat were dry. One of the girls saw how pale she looked
  and, much concerned, brought her a cup of tea, and she drank it and felt
  refreshed. At half-past five the staff left, and she was still taking down
  Cranford's notes, now upon some new construction in which he was interested,
  now an article for a technical newspaper, always at top speed in a voice
  which seemed to hold an everlasting complaint.</p>

  <p>At half-past six he finished, tidied his desk neatly, and closed it with a
  bang. He looked at her as she turned over the leaves of her notebook.</p>

  <p>"You've got two hours' work there," he said. "You may go early tomorrow to
  make up."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think that is all," he said after a while. "You know my address in
  Devonshire. Here is the key of the safe; don't lose it. Good-night."</p>

  <p>The "good-night" was his usual curt farewell, and only her lips moved in
  response. She went back to her desk and tackled her work.</p>

  <p>Her fingers flew over the keys, and by eight o'clock she had gathered
  together the typescript, signed and enveloped such letters as she had
  authority to send, laid the copy of his article on his desk, and had covered
  her own machine.</p>

  <p>It was dark. There was only the light above where she sat and the solitary
  light which she had switched on in Cranford's office. Save for the
  caretakers, whose brooms she heard thumping in the corridor without, she was
  alone in the building.</p>

  <p>She opened her bag, dived her hand into its depths, and took out the key.
  She felt surprisingly calm. Did other criminals feel the same? Often she had
  wondered how burglars and murderers could have brought themselves to commit
  their cold-blooded deeds, but now she understood. There was no tremor in her
  hand, and when she walked into the inner office, her step was steady and she
  felt no inclination to faint as she had feared. It was very easy. She did not
  know what reserves of strength she was exhausting.</p>

  <p>She opened the safe, pushed back the heavy door, and pulled out a drawer.
  On the top lay the sealed envelope containing the tender for the Shaftesbury
  Power House.</p>

  <p>This she carried to the desk, wrote on a slip of paper, "To be Delivered
  by 12.5 certain" even underlined the 'certain'&mdash;pinned it to the
  envelope and laid it in the chief stenographer's basket. Then she went back
  for the money. it lay in two wads, the money that was usually kept there,
  supplemented by the £300 which had been drawn from the bank that morning to
  pay the expenses of Benson, who was leaving for South America. It was this
  £300 she took, and it was when those notes were in her hand that her nerve
  broke. She felt the break coming and tried to fight it off, but in an instant
  she was leaning against the safe, sobbing softly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's wrong, it's wrong," she sobbed. "Nothing can make it right,
  nothing, nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!"</p>

  <p>The voice was behind her, and she turned round, her mouth open to
  scream.</p>

  <p>Cranford had come in and had half closed the door behind him. His
  remorseless face was a mask, his steady gray eyes were fixed upon her. She
  did not faint, she did not scream; she clutched the hard steel corner of the
  safe to hold her erect and looked at him. She could not even think, though
  she had a picture of a little boy who would be waiting for her in two hours'
  time at a London terminus, and there was the winter ahead, and the greatest
  specialist in London had said frankly that the winter would kill him. She did
  not think of herself or what it meant to her. If she saw anything, it was
  only the supreme and horrible tragedy which centered round the white-faced
  little boy who was her greatest treasure and her greatest sorrow.</p>

  <p>"Nothing can make it right," said Cranford in even tones.</p>

  <p>She lurched forward, but he caught her before she fell and propped her
  into a big chair at his desk.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she muttered.</p>

  <p>He watched her for a while in silence, then reached for the telephone, and
  she shrank back as though he were going to strike her. He called a number.
  She was faintly familiar with it. Cranford was on speaking terms with the
  police and knew somebody at almost every station, and she braced herself to
  hear her doom.</p>

  <p>When the call came through, she recognized the man whose name he mentioned
  as a business associate of his.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going down to Devonshire tonight," said Cranford. "Just let me
  know what happens."</p>

  <p>He made no explanations as to his change of plan, because that was not
  Cranford's way. Slowly he removed his light overcoat, hung this and his hat
  on their usual peg, and pulled up a chair to the position which she usually
  occupied when she was taking notes. She was still holding the money in her
  hand, unconscious of the fact, indeed, her arm was still rigidly held as it
  was when he had surprised her.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is this all about? he asked, and she looked at him
  wonderingly, and he repeated the question.</p>

  <p>"I was stealing your money," she said.</p>

  <p>"I guessed that," said Cranford dryly; "but you're not the kind of person
  who steals money, Mrs. Glynn?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No&mdash;I'm not," she 'answered helplessly, "but I
  was stealing. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Why were you taking that money?" demanded Cranford. "That is the first
  point. I will decide what I am going to do afterwards. By the way, I will
  relieve you of that."</p>

  <p>He took the notes from her unresisting hand and slipped them into his
  pocket. Then he got up, closed the door of the safe, and locked it.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>She told him simply. It was the story of a mother's fight for her delicate
  boy, told without excuse, without emphasis, and might have moved any man.
  Apparently it did not move Cranford, and she would have been surprised if it
  had.</p>

  <p>"You were taking money to send your boy into the mountains?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Who was the doctor?"</p>

  <p>She told him, and he nodded. "Where do you live?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In Clerkenwell," she said, and he rose.</p>

  <p>"Get your things on," he said. "We will go to your house in
  Clerkenwell."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Put on your coat," he said in a voice which allowed no argument.</p>

  <p>She obeyed, delaying her return to his room just long enough to wipe the
  evidence of tears from her face. He was dressed waiting for her, and without
  a word led the way from the office and the building. No word was spoken on
  the journey. For the second time that day she had the unusual experience of
  traveling by taxi-cab, but this time in a different mood.</p>

  <p>She mounted the narrow, ill-lighted stairs, and ushered him into a tiny
  flat. Two bags stood packed in the hall, and in the little living-room the
  child was being dressed for the journey. At a sign from Doris Mrs. Thomas
  came to the passage.</p>

  <p>"I just want a few minutes," whispered the girl. "Mr. Cranford wishes to
  see my boy."</p>

  <p>She came back to find Cranford and the child solemnly surveying one
  another.</p>

  <p>"That's your boy, eh?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "He doesn't look very ill. He's white, but I wonder how
  children can be anything but white in London."</p>

  <p>Presently his survey ended, and he turned his impassive face to the girl.
  "I suppose you have your passport and ticket?"</p>

  <p>Her lips trembled, and she could only assent with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, rising. "You are going by the Havre boat, I
  presume?"</p>

  <p>She assented again.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll meet you at Waterloo at half-past nine," he said. "You had
  better look for me by the bookstall. Give your trunks to a porter and he will
  register them for you." She stared at him wildly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cranford!" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Do as you are told," he said, and was gone before she could gather her
  scattered thoughts.</p>

  <p>He was waiting for them at the station, and had secured a carriage. To her
  amazement he himself got in with them, also to her embarrassment, because she
  held third-class tickets, whilst the carriage he had reserved was
  first-class.</p>

  <p>"But you are not going, Mr. Cranford? You have no passport."</p>

  <p>"I came up to bring my diplomatic passport to you for you to return," he
  said. "That is why I called at the office. I have it in my pocket."</p>

  <p>She found a bundle of papers, and on arrival at Southampton she was to
  learn that he had reserved a cabin for her and the boy.</p>

  <p>There never was, perhaps, so strange a journey or such queer
  fellow-passengers as these two who journeyed through France, from Havre to
  Paris and from Paris to the golden valley of Chamonix, without speaking any
  more than was necessary to announce that dinner was served or that a change
  of trains was scheduled. And so they came to Argentière, the girl still in a
  maze, still without understanding, and it was not until they were lunching at
  La Planet that he discussed any aspect of their amazing journey.</p>

  <p>"I know one of the Alpine guides who lives in this village," he said. "He
  has an extremely nice home, and his wife is a very kindly sort of person. I
  have arranged for your little boy to stay with them for a year. He is old
  enough to enjoy the life and too young really to miss you. He will have
  excellent food, and there is no reason why you shouldn't come out two or
  three times a year to see him."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him through her tears.</p>

  <p>"Why have you done this, Mr. Cranford?" she asked. "Why have you been
  so&mdash;so wonderful to me?"</p>

  <p>And then for the first time in her life she saw him smile, and it was a
  smile of singular sweetness and, too, singular sadness.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bristow will tell you one of these days," he said shortly, and
  changed the subject, leaving her more bewildered than ever.</p>

  <p>She left the boy without a pang. He waved her so cheery a farewell from
  the brow of the little hill on which La Planet is built, that it would have
  been the sheerest selfishness if she had felt grieved at the parting. So far
  she had been upheld by the tremendous novelty of the situation, by the
  gratitude which had welled and bubbled up from her heart, gratitude to the
  man who had saved her boy and had saved her. She was beginning to understand
  all that her act and her plans had meant. She could look down from the brink
  of the precipice and see herself, a strange and remote figure engaged in an
  act which she could neither understand nor sanction in her normal mood.</p>

  <p>But most astounding of all the experiences which had been crowded into
  three days, Ian Cranford was indefinably changed, though still monosyllabic
  of speech, silent and unsmiling.</p>

  <p>So far she had borne herself well, but the reaction came that night on the
  way back to Paris. They were alone in a first-class compartment. He was
  dozing in a corner, a traveling rug over his knees, and she was vainly
  attempting to sleep, lying full length upon a seat. Then she began to cry,
  softly at first, but, as she lost control, melting into a very passion of
  tears. Before she knew what had happened he was sitting by her, his arm about
  her, her head upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Poor little mother, poor little mother!" his soft voice came to her ear.
  "You've stood it splendidly, you brave dear soul!"</p>

  <p>She felt his lips brush her cheek, and sank into delicious
  unconsciousness. She spent the night in his arms, sleeping like a child.</p>

  <p>Two days later Doris Glynn was back at her desk in the room which she had
  not expected to see again, as grave, as imperturbable as ever, yet with a
  certain softness of voice and manner which was remarked upon. None knew the
  turmoil of her mind or the film of half-answered questions which flickered
  through her head.</p>

  <p>Why had he done it? Why for her? Why of all the women in the world had he
  chosen a weakling who saw no way out of her difficulties other than the way
  of theft?</p>

  <p>She could only think with awe of that awakening in the gray light of an
  autumn dawn with her cheek against his, his strong arm around her, and the
  low-spoken words of homage and love...</p>

  <p>The recollection of it caught her breath, and she stopped with her hand
  poised over the keyboard. Then the door of Cranford's private office flung
  open and his bull-voice roared for her. She went meekly, notebook in hand,
  and the door closed behind her.</p>

  <p>"My Gawd!" said one stenographer to another, "I wouldn't have that girl's
  job for a million a week!"</p>

  <p>Inside the office Mr. Cranford had visitors: one, a stately, gray woman
  who did not deign to notice the girl. Mrs. Bristow was accompanied by her
  solicitor, and evidently the least pleasant part of the negotiations had been
  concluded before Doris was called in.</p>

  <p>"I think you've been extremely hard," the lady was drawling, "and really
  your terms are ruinous. After the quarries are gone I shall hardly have £5000
  a year to live upon."</p>

  <p>She shook her head mournfully.</p>

  <p>"People have starved on less," said Cranford, and the old lady's eyebrows
  rose in resentment at the flippancy.</p>

  <p>"You have been very hard, Mr. Cranford," she said. "By the way, are you
  one of the Cranfords of Cranford Bassett?"</p>

  <p>Ian Cranford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"And yet the name is familiar to me," said the old woman as she rose. "I
  have known many Cranfords. There was Stanley Cranford. You remember, Stiles
  "&mdash;she addressed the elderly solicitor&mdash;"a perfectly charming boy.
  And then there was a Mrs. Cranford; who was she? Oh, I remember," she nodded;
  "a very estimable person. My housekeeper, for some time. What happened to
  her, Stiles? I seem to remember that there was something disagreeable."</p>

  <p>"You prosecuted her for theft," said the solicitor.</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course," said Mrs. Bristow complacently. "She had ideas far
  above her station, poor soul; stole jewelry, did she not, to educate her son,
  or some such nonsense? Did she go to prison?"</p>

  <p>"For six months," said the solicitor.</p>

  <p>"So she did, so she did! Good morning, Mr. Cranford."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand, but Cranford did not take it.</p>

  <p>"You have been harsh with me, very harsh indeed. I hardly know which way
  to turn, and my poor boy..."</p>

  <p>She was still talking to herself when the girl opened the door for her,
  and they heard her complaining voice growing fainter.</p>

  <p>Doris turned to meet Ian Cranford's eye.</p>

  <p>"A nice woman," he said grimly; "she believes she is ruined with £5000 a
  year."</p>

  <p>"I think she was trying to be horrid," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, dear." Cranford's voice was unusually soft. "You've been
  wondering why such a disagreeable beast of a man&mdash;" she put her hand on
  his to stop him, but he went on: "You wonder why I have been..."</p>

  <p>He stopped himself and was at a loss for words. "I always liked you, but I
  loved you that moment when I came in and found you sobbing as if your poor
  heart would break with my money in your hand."</p>

  <p>"But why?" she asked in amazement.</p>

  <p>"For your sacrfice," he said, "because you were doing what another woman
  did, what Mrs. Bristow's housekeeper did for my sake, that I might go to a
  good school and start fair in the battle of life."</p>

  <p>"For you?" said the girl, staring at him, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"For me," he said simply. "My mother was Mrs. Bristow's housekeeper. She
  stole to keep me at a decent school, and Mrs. Bristow, though she knew all
  the circumstances, prosecuted her."</p>

  <p>He looked out of the window and licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"My mother died in prison," he said softly. "She died in prison!"</p>

  <p>And then Doris Glynn understood.</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">V. &mdash; JAKE'S BROTHER BILL</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Royal Magazine</i>, April 1922</h3>

  <p class="first">THE effect of wine upon temperament is a subject for study
  which the psychologists have neglected.</p>

  <p>Jake's brother Bill was the only man who ever tackled the question in an
  earnest spirit of research, and although his studies were frequently
  interrupted by circumstances over which he had no control, he never forsook
  his course of study. On one point he was emphatic, and it was that champagne
  produced an overwhelming sense of patriotism. He reached this conclusion in
  the week he was expelled from college for painting a pacifist professor's
  motorcar red, white and blue.</p>

  <p>He had to break into the garage to do it, and he spent the whole of one
  night at his task, but neither his enterprise nor his nobility of purpose
  saved him from being expelled.</p>

  <p>When he was in prison for violently assaulting the police in the execution
  of their duty, he developed his theory to the extent of marking rum as a
  "revolutionary stimulant which arouses the basest resentment against
  established law."</p>

  <p>He used to write long letters to Jake, setting forth his views.</p>

  <p>It is to his credit that he never drank rum again. Jake insists that he
  did one memorable evening at Funchal, but the truth is not yet known, for
  Bill is somewhere in China, having escaped from Funchal on a fruit boat which
  "he did unlawfully seize by piracy, and did cast away by neglect upon the
  foreshores of Algiers "&mdash;to quote the indictment on which, in his
  absence, he was tried and sentenced to death by the Government of Lisboa.</p>

  <p>All the trouble came about over a girl who was also a ward of
  Government.</p>

  <p>Wards in Chancery are frequent phenomena, but a ward whose guardians
  changed with the fluctuating fortune of political parties was a surprising
  circumstance even to Jake Harrison.</p>

  <p>And the only thing that ever surprised Jake was Q.Z.H., who lived at the
  Vigo end of the cable. Q.Z.H. had a name and an identity, but nobody at
  Funchal ever knew him, except by the initials which preceded the messages he
  relayed. And he was certainly a poor operator.</p>

  <p>"It is surprising to me that that fellow holds down his job," said Jake at
  odd intervals.</p>

  <p>Jake came to the South-Eastern from the Western Union. He left the Western
  Union from sheer ennui.</p>

  <p>Wall Street prices were his specialty, and after five weary years of
  fraction tapping, he threw up the work and came to the South-Eastern, which
  carries a line of romance and unexpectedness. For the South-Eastern drains
  China and India, Africa and Australia of their surplus news, and there is
  generally a little war near one sensitive, trembling antenna of the service,
  and Funchal got all the news that was going.</p>

  <p>Jake was a Canadian, a brilliant operator and a misogynist. Or he was
  until one day, strolling up the long hill road that skirts the Grand Canyon,
  he met a girl who had no other duenna than a half-bred terrier pup.</p>

  <p>At the sight of her Jake stood still and stared. Women did not usually
  take him that way, but this girl was amazingly different. Her father had
  been, in his lifetime, a native of Funchal, which meant that the blood of two
  proud Latin races had flowed in his veins. In his native land he had been a
  marquis, or something of the sort, but Jake never troubled to inquire. In
  Funchal he had owned banana lands of vast size.</p>

  <p>The girl's mother was a Miss Macverney, and pretty.</p>

  <p>In the person of Inez Savalla the warm south and the austere north fought,
  gigantically, for expression, and neither side lost. Her hair should have
  been black or flaxen. Instead, it was of swarthy gold. South won in the
  creamy complexion, but the north triumphed in her blue eyes. The pride of the
  Clan Macverney (who are really Brodies) compromised with the <i>hauteur</i>
  of a race that once lived on the borderline of Castile. The carriage of her,
  the swing of hip and shoulder, the tilt of her head, and the long black
  eyelashes through which the blue eyes flashed sideways as she passed him,
  these were pleasantly southern.</p>

  <p>Jake stared after her as she strode down the hill, and he blinked
  twice.</p>

  <p>"That is a pretty nice girl," he admitted.</p>

  <p>He observed that she was very simply dressed, and this puzzled him.
  Simplicity is very uninformative. She might have been a tradesman's daughter,
  and therefore within the possibilities of his acquaintance. On the other
  hand, she might be one of those grand ladies of the Island who live on so
  exalted a plane that nothing meaner than the officers of a visiting man o'
  war, or a consul-general, or a distinguished man of affairs breaking his
  journey to Cape Town, might meet on terms of equality.</p>

  <p>"That is an extraordinarily nice girl," said Jake with a sigh, and
  followed her with his eye until she was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Society on the island of Funchal is notoriously exclusive, but is neither
  as exclusive nor as outspoken as the mess of the South-Eastern Cable Company.
  Here reputations go cheap, as is only natural, for if the officials of the
  S.E.C.C. are punctilious in the matter of secrecy, and it is considered bad
  form even to discuss the contents of cables outside the instrument-room, the
  knowledge of private affairs gained professionally has very naturally an
  influence on the attitude of the individual mind. To the mess-room the folks
  high and low of Funchal were just Funchalese, with or without endearing
  adjectives.</p>

  <p>The mess had few friends outside, and depended upon Fanelly to supply all
  that was requisite of local gossip. Fanelly, who spoke the language like a
  native, was an inveterate collector of news. To him Jake went.</p>

  <p>"A girl with gold-black hair!" Fanelly knitted his youthful brows. "It
  sounds like Inez Savalla: do you know Colonel Pinto Muello, the fat man with
  the mole on his chin f"</p>

  <p>"I have seen the swine," said Jake inelegantly. "Don't tell me she is his
  daughter!"</p>

  <p>Fanelly sneered.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Savalla, I tell you&mdash;how can she be his daughter,
  eh!"</p>

  <p>"Well, what about him!" asked the impatient Jake.</p>

  <p>"She is going to marry him, that's all," said Fanelly, with an air of
  finality.</p>

  <p>Jake fingered his lean brown cheek and a light shone in eyes that at least
  were as blue as Inez Savalla's.</p>

  <p>"She isn't," he said.</p>

  <p>The young man resented this refutation of news which was practically
  official.</p>

  <p>"I tell you the marriage has been fixed by the governor, who is her
  guardian. Old Savalla was an eccentric old devil, and he left his daughter a
  ward of the governor."</p>

  <p>"But this governor is a new man&mdash;Almedez only came to the island six
  months ago."</p>

  <p>Fanelly smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's the joke: whoever is governor is her guardian. Almedez is a great
  friend of Muello's, they went to the same chiropodist in Lisboa&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cease your facetious commentaries," said Jake, laying his big hand on the
  young man's shoulder, "and when you go calling on your dago friends, pass the
  word around that the engagement has been dissolved."</p>

  <p>"Who by?" asked the startled youth.</p>

  <p>"By whom, is better English," said Jake gently, "but if you are asked that
  question, hand 'em my card... does she speak English?"</p>

  <p>Fanelly nodded.</p>

  <p>"With a strong Aberdeen accent," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good!" nodded Jake in all seriousness. "Then the last obstacle to our
  happy union has been removed."</p>

  <p>She spoke English very prettily, when she came upon Jake bandaging his
  ankle on the mountain road.</p>

  <p>It was a sprained ankle for the time being.</p>

  <p>"Are you English?" she asked, as she helped him to a convenient bank.</p>

  <p>"Scottish," said Jake somberly. "Aberdeen&mdash;maybe you have heard of
  the place?"</p>

  <p>He was a liar and a scoundrel, and was prepared to admit it. For the
  moment there was no necessity. She sat by his side whilst the half-bred
  terrier pup gnawed and pulled at loose ends of the bandage. And there was
  such beauty in the world and in his heart, that Jake Harrison was prepared to
  find excuses for the deception he was practising.</p>

  <p>Funchal is a jewel of an island. Above them, as they sat, the scarp of the
  Sierra was a gray-banner flung against the blue. Beneath, the land lay in
  irregular squares of brown and emerald and gold. Funchal was a dainty
  toy-town, perched on a ledge of rock that jutted into the blue Atlantic. And
  the air was sweet with the aromatic fragrance of fruit and flowers.</p>

  <p>"It is a wonderful island: I was born here," she said simply, "and I
  suppose I shall die here."</p>

  <p>"God forbid," said Jake fervently.</p>

  <p>He met her again the next day, and then every day, and learnt more than
  Fanelly could have told him. She certainly was engaged to Colonel Pinto
  Muello. She spoke of the fact without enthusiasm. And Jake discovered why she
  had not been married off before. Her successive guardians had successively
  administered her estate. Each governor stole a little on one pretext or
  another. Now there was nothing left to steal. She did not state the case as
  crudely. She spoke of "expenses of administration," but Jake was an impartial
  student of graft in all its forms, and supplied his own interpretation.</p>

  <p>The last governor to arrive had discovered to his intense annoyance that
  the Savalla estate, which was and had been for years regarded as a perquisite
  of office, was no longer there to be "administered." Having nothing else to
  sell, he sold the girl. Pinto Muello was a rich man.</p>

  <p>On the ninth day of meeting, Jake met the colonel. He was a stout, tightly
  uniformed man, with a heavy black moustache, which he twisted with a quick
  "wiping" gesture, the result of many years of practice, and Jake gazed in
  fascination at the large mole on the side of his chin and wondered how often
  the colonel shaved.</p>

  <p>In manner he was fiery and made gurgling noises in his throat. This, Jake
  gathered, was an expression of his fierceness.</p>

  <p>"You are the operator in charge?" he demanded insolently.</p>

  <p>"I admit it," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"There has not come a cable for me, yes, no!"</p>

  <p>Jake Harrison shook his head with exasperating slowness. Moles were
  supposed to be lucky, he thought, yet he would not have changed places with
  the colonel. And Jake had no moles.</p>

  <p>"Twice, four times, seven, I have come to this bureau," thundered Colonel
  Pinto Muello, thumping the counter, "and always it is no! You are certain?
  Have you messages I may look through to be sure none has escaped the
  observer! I have authority, eh! I am in command of military mens on the
  island."</p>

  <p>"So I'm told," said Jake wearily, "but if a cable comes through for you,
  it goes through to you."</p>

  <p>"If it comes through, it goes through?" repeated the colonel frowningly.
  His knowledge of idiomatic English was slight. "Remember!" he thumped the
  table again. "I have all authorities for search! I command military mens on
  the island&mdash;all of them!"</p>

  <p>"I know 'em both," said Jake.</p>

  <p>He related the conversation at tiffin to Jack Boynes; the senior operator
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"Pinto is in a devil of a state of mind," he said. "He's been to the
  office twenty or thirty times the past two days."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's expecting a remittance," suggested Jake.</p>

  <p>It was Fanelly who supplied the explanation.</p>

  <p>"There is a whole lot of political trouble in the dear land that owns this
  island," he said. "Some people think there will be a revolution, and that
  Pinto is in it. Anyway, his police are pinching all sort of people on the
  island&mdash;why, they even shadowed me last night!"</p>

  <p>"This is fearful news," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"You can laugh, Harrison." Fanelly was very serious. "But it isn't a joke.
  Every new arrival on the island is being trailed."</p>

  <p>"That's certainly tough luck on Bonson's baby," said Jake, and big Bill
  Bonson, whose wife had augmented the population that morning, howled his
  delight.</p>

  <p>That afternoon the humorous aspect of the situation carried no appeal to
  Jake Harrison.</p>

  <p>Neither the blue of the bay nor the scarlet of wild geraniums, nor the
  sun-blazed glories of the wispy clouds that trail from peak to peak of the
  Sierra Funchal, had form or color or beauty for him as he stood stricken dumb
  on the canyon road and listened to the halting words of Inez Savalla. He knew
  the worst when he met her, and saw the ravage the all-night tears had
  made.</p>

  <p>"In three days..." she sobbed. "Oh, Jake... can't you do something,
  dear?"</p>

  <p>So far had their friendship developed from the pleasantries, the
  sympathies, the shameless deceptions, and the other correlatives of a
  sprained ankle.</p>

  <p>Jake thought powerfully. There was no ship leaving for three days, and
  though he might speak slightingly of Muello's army and his ragged
  gendarmerie, they were unpleasant facts. So, too, was the untidy prison on
  Tower Hill.</p>

  <p>A fruit boat was entering the bay as he looked, a squat tub of a boat out
  of Cadiz&mdash;there was no help from there. She was under the command of
  Pietro Manzana y Manzana. Jake had once smitten Pietro and had been fined a
  hundred milreis for his brutality.</p>

  <p>"You just trust to old Jake," was all he could say: the basis for such a
  trust was his faith in Jake.</p>

  <p>He had hardly got back to his quarters before he received a letter. It was
  written on the yellow edge of Funchal's one newspaper, the Diaro del
  Funchal,</p>

  <p>"I am a prisoner in the house; Muello has sent his aunt to stay with me,
  and there are soldiers on guard at the door. Do not expect me, dear;
  good-bye."</p>

  <p>Jake read the penciled words and rubbed his head. Fanelly, coming into the
  reading-room where Jake was sitting, asked in his aimless way if he wanted
  anything.</p>

  <p>"A red-hot miracle, my son," said Jake.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the South-Eastern in Funchal is as near to the shore
  end of the cable as is convenient. It had the disadvantage of accessibility,
  a considerable disadvantage, remembering that Funchal is essentially a relay
  station, for the business done on the island would not pay the board of the
  most junior operator.</p>

  <p>The evening meal had finished, and all but Jake had gone their several
  ways. He alone sat at the table, his head on his hands, thinking wonderfully
  but ineffectively.</p>

  <p>He had no more thought of his brother than he had of the Grand Khan of
  Muscovy. He had not thought of the erratic Bill for years, and yet into his
  solitary meditations came this last considerable factor.</p>

  <p>The man who stood in the doorway was tall, dark, and untidy. He had a
  week's growth of beard on his cheek and his linen was even older. He came in
  softly, seeming to wriggle through a two-inch opening of the door, and he
  stood surveying the room and its rough comfort with an approving eye.</p>

  <p>Between the tramp who shuffles the countryside and the tramp who stalks
  the world, there is a great difference.</p>

  <p>The world tramp brings with him an air of self-confidence, and meets the
  most exalted personages on terms of equality. He is never abashed, never
  cringes, and is equally at home in the musty hold of a steamer or the
  gorgeous club-rooms of the colonial aristocracy.</p>

  <p>With his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his stained and ragged
  trousers, he regarded the gloomy and unconscious figure of Jake with a smile
  of amusement.</p>

  <p>Presently Jake looked round, took a good look at the newcomer, and rose
  slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Where in hell have you been, Bill!" he demanded, and a wise observer
  would have known immediately that Jake Harrison was talking to his brother,
  and by his attitude of domination, his younger brother.</p>

  <p>Bill Harrison came forward to the table, seated himself, and viewed the
  scraps of food which were left with the eye of a connoisseur.</p>

  <p>"I've just blown in," he said.</p>

  <p>"0n the <i>Onzona</i>?"</p>

  <p>Bill Harrison selected a piece of bread, buttered it calmly from a remnant
  left on the edge of a plate, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were here: I thought I'd come along and look you up. Let me
  see, it's nearly eight years since we met, isn't it, Jake?"</p>

  <p>"Nine," said Jake. "Where have you come from?"</p>

  <p>"Cadiz," replied the other. "Do you mind passing that loaf along? Thank
  you. Have you got a drink?"</p>

  <p>Jake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A glass of Marsala?" suggested his guest. "Except for its melancholic
  reaction, Marsala is as innocuous as grape fruit."</p>

  <p>"You'll get no drink here," said Jake. "Haven't you been drinking
  already?"</p>

  <p>"I have drunk and eaten bananas for eight days," said his brother. "There
  should be a law passed making the growing of bananas a penal offense."</p>

  <p>Jake made no comment, and the other went on. He cut a slice of bread, and
  Jake pushed toward him a plate of butter.</p>

  <p>"I got to Cadiz," said the wanderer, "from Malta, on a C. and I. boat that
  was short of a steward. Before then I was in Alexandria: a pretty mean kind
  of place, but not so mean as Colombo. I tossed up whether I'd go across to
  Rio, or whether I 'd look in here, and you won."</p>

  <p>"You won, you mean," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"Very likely," said the visitor carelessly, and then: "what is wrong here?
  Has Funchal gone dry or is there an election in progress?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There are so many things wrong on this damned island that I couldn't
  start telling you," said Jake testily. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, "except that I've been followed around by a cop
  ever since I landed."</p>

  <p>"You don't tell me," said Jake sarcastically. "Why they should shadow a
  well-set-up young fellow like you is beyond my understanding. I will send a
  note to the governor." He winced at the word "governor," and his grimace did
  not escape the attention of his brother, who was a student of humanity.</p>

  <p>Jake walked to the door and beckoned his relative with a jerk of his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Come along, I'll find you a bed," he said. "! suppose I shall have to
  keep you for a day or two."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Mr. Bill Harrison was sucking luxuriously at a long
  black cigar in his brother's room.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to sleep here tonight. Tomorrow I'll get you a place in the
  town," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"A glass of Madeira," murmured Bill, "and I should be in paradise. Madeira
  is a sedative, and excellent for the tired business man. Its pathological
  effects are exaggerated. And it is cheap."</p>

  <p>"You'll drink ice-water," snarled Jake.</p>

  <p>Bill Harrison nodded calmly.</p>

  <p>"Ice-water is poison, but is not as deadly as the fruit of the <i>musa
  sapientium</i>, or as the vulgar describe it, the banana."</p>

  <p>Later Jake had to vouch for his identity to a suspicious chief of
  police.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know who he is," said Jake icily. "He has come out with
  excellent credentials, and he is the guest of the mess for a week or two." He
  did not admit the relationship in which the visitor stood to him, for obvious
  reasons. It was just like Bill to come barging in at this moment of crisis,
  he thought bitterly as he went on duty that night. Only a fraction of his
  mind was on the instrument he manipulated; the best of his thoughts were with
  a girl and a stout colonel of infantry in a tight-fitting uniform.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock in the morning came an urgent Government message. Jake
  was the only man on duty at the moment, Fanelly, his second in command,
  having been dispatched to make coffee. Jake wrote the words mechanically, and
  sat for a long time staring at the written message whilst Cape Town called
  frantically on his right, and Vigo chattered impatiently on his left.</p>

  <p>Although he was a poor linguist, he could both read and write the
  language, and the message ran:</p>

  <p>"To Colonel Pinto Muello, very urgent. By order of the Government you will
  arrest Almedez and assume the functions of governor. The Diaz Government has
  fallen. Long live the Revolution."</p>

  <p>There followed a code-word which Jake knew terminated all Government
  messages, and guaranteed their <i>bona fides</i>. He sat for ten minutes, and
  then hearing the footsteps of Fanelly, thrust the message into his pocket. An
  hour later he was relieved, and went back to his quarters carrying with him a
  blank message form.</p>

  <p>He switched on the light and kicked his brother awake. Bill Harrison sat
  up blinking.</p>

  <p>"Bill, do you speak this lingo very well?"</p>

  <p>"It is my native language," said Bill modestly, and then Jake outlined the
  wildest scheme that the mind of a cable operator ever evolved.</p>

  <p>"It is not a job I like," said Bill, "and it is certainly not a dry job.
  This palace, I presume, will be well stocked?"</p>

  <p>Jake swore at him for fully three minutes.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you to cuss," said Bill, hurt. "You ask me to
  masquerade as a new governor appointed by the Central Government. You ask me
  to bestow a wife upon you, and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can have anything you like when it is all over," said Jake. "I'll
  borrow Bane's motor-boat, and the day after I'm married we'll get away."</p>

  <p>Bill thought for a long time, then:</p>

  <p>"Cut my hair, Jake, and lend me a suit of your society clothes. I have
  views about governing."</p>

  <p>"The only thing I ask you&mdash;in fact. Bill, I implore you&mdash;is to
  cut out the champagne," pleaded Jake, and his brother eyed him coldly.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten that such a wine is made," he said.</p>

  <p>At half-past five, when the dawn was coming up over the eastern seas, a
  Major Corelli was wakened from his profound slumbers, and into the hands of
  this dazed man was thrust a telegram.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">YOU WILL TAKE CONTROL OF THE TROOPS; ARREST COLONEL
  MUELLO AND GOVERNOR ALMEDEZ. YOU WILL CO-OPERATE WITH SEÑOR DUSA, WHO HAS
  ARRIVED SECRETLY FROM LISBOA, AND WHO IS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF FUNCHAL. YOU
  ARE PROMOTED COLONEL AND ARE DECORATED WITH THE SECOND CLASS ORDER OF ST.
  XAVIER.</p>

  <p>Probably Jake's most artistic effort was the decoration of the new
  commander of troops. By eight o'clock in the morning the evolution was
  accomplished. At seven o'clock that evening, Jake Harrison was united in the
  holy bonds of matrimony to the Senhora Inez Savalla. And he was married in
  style by the Archbishop of Funchal. The new governor had insisted upon this,
  and when Jake heard the news he quaked, for when Bill Harrison was grandiose,
  he was usually drunk.</p>

  <p>Furthermore one of the first acts of the new governor was to issue a
  decree prohibiting the consumption of bananas.</p>

  <p>Here was proof positive.</p>

  <p>"He's got as far as the sparkling wines," groaned Jake when he heard the
  news, and hurried his preparations for departure.</p>

  <p>The next morning he chartered a fiacre and drove up to the governor's
  palace. The decree against the consumption of bananas was being pasted upon
  the brick gateway as he drove in, and almost the first person he met in the
  large stone hall was the newly decorated commander of troops. He was looking
  a little wistful.</p>

  <p>"You have brought a message?" he asked eagerly, recognizing Jake, but the
  operator shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand it," said the major. "It is inexplicable! No other
  instructions have come to me, and I simply await the orders of my
  Government."</p>

  <p>Jake could have explained why no other messages came through. Some evil
  person had waded out at low tide, and had affixed an explosive charge to the
  cable connecting Funchal with Lisboa. He thought it wise not to mention this
  fact.</p>

  <p>"I want to see the governor," said Jake, and the major's face lit up.</p>

  <p>"What a man!" he said. "Only for two days has he been at the palace, and
  everything is reorganized! And what a voice!"</p>

  <p>Jake's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Has he been singing?" he asked faintly.</p>

  <p>"In every language," said the enthusiastic major. "To me alone, you
  understand: we are as brothers." He threw out his arms expansively.</p>

  <p>"You can have him," said Jake in English.</p>

  <p>He found Governor Bill Harrison in the governor's library, and there was
  in Bill's eye a gentle sadness which confirmed Jake's worst suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Now, Bill," he said violently, when the door had closed, "you've got to
  cut this drink out. I've heard stories in the town that have kept me awake at
  night. I have the boat ready and we can leave tonight."</p>

  <p>"You leave alone," said Bill grandly. "I have a duty to perform; a duty to
  a downtrodden people, crushed under the burdens imposed by successive
  tyrants. Every democratic fibre in my body vibrates to the call of their
  necessity. Will you have a drink?"</p>

  <p>"No, I won't have a drink," shouted Jake. "You're a madman. Bill; you
  can't stay here. The Lisboa Government will send a warship, and I daresay
  there's one on its way already. And then where will you be!"</p>

  <p>"I shall defy them," said Bill dreamily, as he sat easily in his chair,
  his legs crossed, his finger tips together. "I've already summoned a meeting
  of the Cabinet, and we have decided to resist any attack upon our
  sovereignty."</p>

  <p>Jake drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Is this the effect of Marsala!" he asked bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It is a light German wine which I found in the cellar&mdash;pre-war
  stuff, Jake. You're losing the experience of a lifetime if you refuse my
  hospitality."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do!" asked Jake again.</p>

  <p>Bill shrugged his shoulders and smiled serenely.</p>

  <p>He had enlisted the services of a hairdresser. His little beard was
  trimmed to a point, his linen was faultless. Happily the late governor, now
  languishing in Tower Hill prison, had been almost Bill's size and shape.</p>

  <p>"I have given instructions to the batteries to fire upon any warship that
  attempts to enter the harbor," he said briskly. "Tomorrow morning we're
  having a meeting of the Education Board. Funchal shall be educated into an
  appreciation of our democratic ins&mdash;institutions."</p>

  <p>Jake could only stare at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine that you're going to be allowed to remain here in peace?"
  he asked, awe-stricken.</p>

  <p>Bill nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he said. "If those old guns don't bust!"</p>

  <p>Jake walked out of the room like a man in a dream; it couldn't be
  champagne, he thought. Champagne did not induce in Bill's hard heart a love
  for the new people he had acquired. And it couldn't be rum, because he was so
  gentle and reasonable. Besides:</p>

  <p>Bill's last words rang in his ears.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about the champagne, because there isn't any in the
  palace," he said. "There's a legend about a dozen cases having been bricked
  up by the last governor, in the hope that he would be able to come back and
  enjoy them, and I'm having a search made, but I have no great hopes,
  Jake."</p>

  <p>Jake had a very considerable sum in the bank, and this he drew before he
  went to the hotel where he had taken his wife.</p>

  <p>"Inez, my dear, we're going to have a pretty bad time," he said, "and I
  don't exactly know where the first few years of our married life will be
  spent. But of all the troubles that are likely to come along, there is one
  which we shall be spared."</p>

  <p>"What is that, Jake?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We shan't see much of Bill," said Jake grimly.</p>

  <p>He spent the remainder of the night provisioning the motor-boat which he
  had hired on the excuse of taking a honeymoon trip to the Lesser Canaries. He
  had long since ceased to be an efficient member of the South-Eastern staff,
  but it may be said of them that knowing little, but guessing a lot, he
  carried with him a whole cargo of their good wishes when he slipped out of
  the tiny harbor in the early morning, and set the nose of the motor-boat for
  the nearest Canary island.</p>

  <p>He was three miles out when ahead of him he saw a boat on the horizon, and
  fixed his glasses upon the tiny ship that was coming over the edge of the
  world.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he said. "It is a warship; poor old Bill!"</p>

  <p>The words were hardly spoken before there came the sound of a deep boom
  from the island, and he looked round. They could not have opened fire on the
  incoming man o' war; that was beyond the range of their antiquated pieces.
  Again the gun crashed, and after an interval, it boomed once more. They were
  firing a salute, he realized, and wondered to whom this salutation was
  offered.</p>

  <p>And then, above the governor's palace he saw a ball creep to the masthead
  and break. In the morning breezes fluttered the Union Jack, and Jake's jaw
  dropped.</p>

  <p>"He's annexed the island to England!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Jake's brother Bill had found the champagne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story6"
     id="story6">VI. &mdash; THE WEAKLING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">REX MADLON was a nice boy&mdash;one of those charming young
  persons who made friends more easily than he could make money. Mostly, his
  friends were other charming folk: somehow he had no affinity for hard-faced
  men who wore impossible neckwear and could put you on to the good things of
  the market.</p>

  <p>On those occasions when he strolled into Denny Horli's office just before
  one o'clock, Denny knew that young Mr. Madlon had come out in a hurry and
  wanted a couple of pounds for lunch, or else had come to consult him in a
  professional capacity in regard to some wretched tailor who refused to wait
  longer than two years for the settlement of his bill.</p>

  <p>Dennis Horll paid good-humoredly when it was a matter of a few pounds:
  once he had made a compromise with a tailor in regard to an overdue account.
  He liked the exquisite young man: more to the point, he loved the sister of
  this amusing youth.</p>

  <p>Norah Madlon was hardly ever amused by her adored brother's
  shiftlessness.</p>

  <p>The six hundred a year which her mother had left her, plus the eight
  hundred which had been settled on Rex, might have made life rather
  comfortable for them both. But Rex's eight hundred seemed to have no
  existence. His half-yearly dividend was earmarked months ahead. He had a
  vague idea that he could marry money; and he ended by promising to marry an
  unspeakable young lady whom he met in a night club.</p>

  <p>From this entanglement Denny rescued him.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know what to do." Norah's pretty face was paler than
  usual. "Rex is such a darling fool, but if anything happened to him I think I
  should die. Denny, surely you can advise him? He would listen to you."</p>

  <p>She was very pretty and appealing, with red lips that quivered
  pathetically in moments of distress. And she was distressed now as they sat
  in the drawing-room of the little Queen's Gate flat.</p>

  <p>"Darling, you must do something&mdash;Rex is in a terrible mess. He's
  given I.O.U.'s... debts of honor... and this horrible man threatens to go to
  Uncle Lewis."</p>

  <p>Uncle Lewis was very old and very wealthy&mdash;a churchwarden and church
  trustee. He held definite views about the Revised Book, and had nothing but
  gas lighting in his house. He believed that dancing was an invention of the
  devil in the time he could spare from inventing playing-cards.</p>

  <p>"Some day Rex will be awfully rich, but I'm terrified that Uncle will find
  out... you know, about that dreadful girl and the gambling."</p>

  <p>Denny looked glumly into the fire.</p>

  <p>If the truth be told, the vagaries of Rex had ceased to raise a smile.
  Though this she did not know, Rex was already in his debt to the extent of
  close on five hundred pounds, and Denny was not a rich man.</p>

  <p>"My darling, I don't know what to suggest. Rex is such a
  waster&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw her stiffen at this. The sanest, dearest girl in every other
  respect, she could not endure the least suggestion of disparagement applied
  to Rex.</p>

  <p>"Well, he certainly isn't a saver, is he?" He tried to turn the phrase to
  its least offensive meaning.</p>

  <p>"Rex isn't a waster!" Her voice was very cold. "He is just thoughtless,
  and depends too much upon Uncle Lewis and his money. It isn't very kind of
  you, Denny!"</p>

  <p>Happily or unhappily, Rex interrupted the conversation at this point. He
  came in, a figure of gala, perfectly tailored, perfectly valeted &mdash;a
  tall, fair-haired young man with a disarming smile. Norah looked at the
  clock: it was a quarter after eleven.</p>

  <p>"Are you going out again, Rex? I thought you said you were going to bed
  early?"</p>

  <p>Rex laughed. "I'm going to have an inexpensive evening&mdash;Lord Levon's
  little dance. I must go&mdash;I promised."</p>

  <p>"Nowhere else?" she appealed.</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd." His left eye closed humorously in Denny's direction. In
  a few seconds he was gone.</p>

  <p>Denny walked to the window, pulled aside the shade and looked out into the
  street. Rex's little coupe was already moving at break-neck speed along the
  broad, deserted road&mdash;he had a passion for fast and costly machines.</p>

  <p>"You can do something, Denny?" Her nerves were on edge, her voice more
  than a little impatient. "I always thought that lawyers could raise
  money."</p>

  <p>"This lawyer can't," he said good-humoredly. "Is it much?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "Four or five thousand pounds," she said, with an attempt
  at airiness; and Denny Horll groaned.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I couldn't raise that except on very good security."</p>

  <p>"On Uncle Lewis's will?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Your uncle may change his will at any moment. Four or
  five thousand pounds?" He whistled. "My dear, that is impossible!"</p>

  <p>He saw the red lips go tighter.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "But I did think you could help. You mustn't
  imagine, because you saw Rex so cheerful, that he isn't worried to death
  about it."</p>

  <p>He pressed her for some particulars of the debt. Here she was rather
  vague, and he guessed that she knew very little. He did gather, however, that
  Rex was in the habit of playing baccarat at the house of "a friend."</p>

  <p>She seemed unwilling to supply any details, if there were any she could
  supply. Their parting was a little distant, and he went home to his lodgings
  near Regent's Park a very unhappy young man.</p>

  <p>Life had not been very easy for Denny Horll; he had followed his father,
  only to clear up the tangle which that light-hearted man had left behind. Ben
  Horll had had something of the temperament of Rex, and Denny found his
  practice more of a responsibility than a profit. For three ghastly years he
  had worked to right the number of wrongs, with the rectification of which his
  father had saddled him. He had to live down suspicions, that were in some
  cases certainties, attached to the name of Horll. But at last the nightmare
  struggle was over, and he had cleared away the wreckage, and was building on
  a new and solid foundation.</p>

  <p>He was in the midst of a heavy morning's work next day when Rex came
  in.</p>

  <p>"You had a bit of a row with Norah, didn't you&mdash;all about me!" He
  screamed with laughter. "You're a silly old ass! But honestly, Denny, what's
  the chance of raising that money?"</p>

  <p>Denny shook his head. "Precious little, my son."</p>

  <p>Rex pulled a long face, but was instantly his smiling self. "It's going to
  be deuced awkward," he said. "If old Lewis&mdash;who is pretty
  ill&mdash;would have the decency to pop off... but I suppose he won't."</p>

  <p>"Are things really so bad?"</p>

  <p>Rex strolled to the window and looked out.</p>

  <p>"Ghastly place, Baker Street," he said. And then, carelessly: "Yes, the
  fellow who's got my paper is an absolute cad. I told Likstein, and he's
  furious."</p>

  <p>"Who is Likstein?" asked Dennis.</p>

  <p>"He's the fellow that runs the game&mdash;I mean, he's a friend of mine
  whom I meet occasionally." Rex became suddenly vague. "Come to lunch?"</p>

  <p>Dennis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't. I've got a very important job," he said, and
  explained what it was.</p>

  <p>That afternoon he had to go to the city to a consultation with another
  solicitor. When he came back he learned that in his absence Rex had called,
  and, after waiting a quarter of an hour, had gone again.</p>

  <p>That night he had another interview with Norah, and this time she was a
  little more unreasonable. But he was not prepared for the sequel. On the
  following afternoon there was delivered to him a curt note and a half-hoop of
  diamonds. Denny Horll felt that the world had suddenly become a bleak,
  colorless place.</p>

  <p>As he sat with his head in his hands by his desk, the telephone bell
  rang.</p>

  <p>"Is that Mr. Dennis Horll?... Scotland Yard speaking. Inspector
  Boscombe... We have information that you've got a lot of money in your
  safe... never mind how we know. I should like to warn you, there's a fellow
  in town who specializes in burgling the offices of solicitors. A fellow named
  Darkey Cane. You want to be very careful. There was a burglary in Lincoln's
  Inn last night."</p>

  <p>Denny listened with a smile, expressed his gratitude, and, restoring the
  receiver to the hook, he went to the safe to make absolutely sure.</p>

  <p>Ten hours later...</p>

  <p>Denny Horll walked slowly to the desk, opened a drawer, and took out the
  loaded Browning.</p>

  <p>"Put that down&mdash;and lively!" He spun round, the pistol still in his
  hand. The long curtains that covered the window looking out on to Baker
  Street had parted. A man was standing there, an overcoat buttoned to his
  chin, his face hidden behind black silk&mdash;the top of a woman's stocking,
  in which two irregular ovals had been cut level with the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Drop it&mdash;quick!" Mechanically he dropped the pistol to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Stand over by the fireplace, put your hands on your head, and don't make
  a fuss, or you'll get it where the hen got hers!"</p>

  <p>The mask reached behind and pulled the curtains close.</p>

  <p>"Keys of the safe&mdash;throw 'em on to the table!"</p>

  <p>Denny put his hand in his pocket, and flung the keys as he was ordered.
  The intruder backed to the safe and, with one eye on his victim, turned the
  key and the big door swung open.</p>

  <p>"Stand over by the window where I can see you&mdash;thank you; sorry to
  bother you."</p>

  <p>The tone was ironical; here was an experienced practitioner with a sense
  of humor.</p>

  <p>He made a quick scrutiny, pulled out a thickly packed envelope marked
  "Steffan Estate". On its flap was the name of the Northern &amp; Southern
  Bank.</p>

  <p>"This will be a lesson to you&mdash;never keep real money in your office.
  You drew this three days ago to pay John Steffan when he arrived from
  America. If there hadn't been a fog, I'd have been late, shouldn't I? Still,
  that's part of the luck... we didn't know anything about it till last night.
  You've got a talkative friend&mdash;he's young, and he'll grow out of
  it."</p>

  <p>Denny said nothing. He watched, fascinated, and saw the envelop disappear
  into the pocket of the burglar.</p>

  <p>"I'll be on the other side of the curtain for two minutes. If you move
  I'll shoot you without warning. I may not be there&mdash;you've got to take
  that risk."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead."</p>

  <p>Denny's voice was unnaturally calm and steady. The burglar saw the pallor
  of the thin, aesthetic face, and chuckled to himself. "Color is the one thing
  you can't control," he said. "Good-night!"</p>

  <p>He was through the curtains in a flash. Denny did not move, though he knew
  that his visitor would hardly wait a second on the balcony. He heard a shot,
  and then another, from the street below, and the shrill blowing of a police
  whistle. He leapt through the curtains and peered down into the fog. A man
  shouted up at him. Dimly he saw the helmet of a policeman.</p>

  <p>"Man got over the balcony. lost anything?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come down."</p>

  <p>He went down the dark, uncarpeted stairs two at a time. No. 804 Baker
  Street was once a dwelling-house, but business had moved north from Oxford
  Street, and the house was now a collection of office suites. Denny Horll had
  his on the first floor&mdash;two rooms sufficed to carry on the dwindling
  solicitor's practice which his father had left him.</p>

  <p>"You're working late, Mr. Horll." The policeman evidently recognized him,
  though he could not remember the man.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;clearing up before my Christmas holiday. Denny spoke quietly,
  monotonously; like a man dazed. He walked up the stairs before the policeman.
  The safe was still open. He indicated this with a gesture, and the policeman
  walked over and stared helplessly at the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>"That's what he did, eh?" He saw the revolver on the table. "Held you
  up?"</p>

  <p>"That's my pistol," said Denny. "I'm afraid I was a little late on the
  draw."</p>

  <p>"Held you up!" repeated the policeman owlishly.</p>

  <p>He put his electric lamp on the weapon. It was such a ludicrous,
  unnecessary action, for the lights were burning, that in any other
  circumstances Denny would have laughed.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;saw him coming down from the balcony on a rope, and nearly got
  him. He shot at me and missed&mdash;twice he shot. I couldn't chase him on a
  night like this&mdash;I ask you."</p>

  <p>Then he became dimly aware of his responsibilities.</p>

  <p>"Anything lost?"</p>

  <p>Denny licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"There was a packet in the safe containing twenty-three thousand pounds,
  or rather a hundred and ten thousand dollars. It was the proceeds of the sale
  of the Steffan Estate. I drew it from the bank a few days ago. Mr. Steffan
  should have arrived tonight, but I think his ship has been held up in the
  Channel by the fog."</p>

  <p>The policeman looked at him and shook his head. He was now out of his
  depth. The immensity of the theft brought the matter into the purview of high
  official Scotland Yard. The fact that the money was in dollars bewildered
  him: he could remember no formula in regard to foreign monies.</p>

  <p>"Banknotes&mdash;American banknotes? I suppose you've got the
  numbers?"</p>

  <p>Denny shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"I'll use your 'phone."</p>

  <p>His story to the station-house was a little incoherent. A balcony, a rope,
  a man, a shot: he insisted upon this; mentioned the theft as an afterthought.
  Somebody asked him a question at the other end of the wire, and he went over
  it all again&mdash;a man, a rope, a balcony, a shot in the fog...</p>

  <p>"Absolutely impossible to chase a man in this weather, sir. You couldn't
  see your hand before your face in Baker Street... the man shot twice."</p>

  <p>He sighed, hung up the receiver, and turned to Denny.</p>

  <p>"Boscombe's there. He's been in our division all the night, looking for
  the gang that smashed Avington's, the jewelers. That's a bit of luck
  &mdash;Mr. Boscombe, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Very," said Denny.</p>

  <p>Boscombe, tall, thin, constitutionally sceptical, came in ten minutes'
  time, and with him two assistants. After he had questioned the constable, he
  sent the man back to the station to make his report.</p>

  <p>"You didn't recognize the man, of course? Masked, wasn't he? The policeman
  thought so. Who knew you had this money in the office?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Boscombe wrote down his name and address. "My clerk," said Denny.</p>

  <p>"Anybody else?"</p>

  <p>Horll shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Any of your relations?"</p>

  <p>"I have no relations," curtly.</p>

  <p>"Friends Are you married, Mr. Horll? No! Engaged, of course?"</p>

  <p>A sour reply was on the tip of Denny's tongue.</p>

  <p>"I am engaged, yes."</p>

  <p>Mr. Boscombe looked at him, pulling at his nose thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The young lady, now: would she know you had the money in the office?"</p>

  <p>"No." The reply was sharp.</p>

  <p>The sceptical Mr. Boscombe took a swift glance at him, folded up his
  notebook, and dropped it into his pocket before he went across to the safe
  and made another examination.</p>

  <p>"The man wore gloves, you say? Cotton gloves"</p>

  <p>"They looked like gray suede, but they could easily have been cotton."</p>

  <p>Boscombe took the keys from the safe, laid them on a sheet of paper, and
  wrapped them up.</p>

  <p>"I'll have a couple of men down to examine the safe door and photograph
  it," he said. "Anything in the safe of value? You can trust 'em, of
  course."</p>

  <p>Denny shook his head.</p>

  <p>Boscombe changed his mind, unwrapped the paper, and took out the keys, and
  locked the safe door; then he put the keys back in the paper.</p>

  <p>"Bad luck on you, Mr. Horll. You're not insured, of course? Insurance
  Companies will not take risks on money. How is it you were working so late in
  the office?"</p>

  <p>"I was doing a little work, clearing up for Christmas. I wanted to take a
  holiday."</p>

  <p>The detective glanced at the desk: it was very orderly; there was no
  appearance of documents or books; the basket on the table contained a tied
  brief.</p>

  <p>"You must have finished your work when he came in. The revolver, of
  course, you had in your drawer? You expected burglars?"</p>

  <p>"I expected burglars after you had warned me," said Denny. He spoke with a
  great effort. "Naturally, having this money in the office, I took no
  risks."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," murmured Boscombe. "I forgot that I 'phoned
  you&mdash;Darkey's work this: very typical."</p>

  <p>He walked to the fire: it had burnt very low. On the top was a litter of
  ashes.</p>

  <p>"You burnt that recently, I presume? What was it? It looks like a letter
  to me."</p>

  <p>The ashes still bore the shape of a letter. There were innumerable black
  charred scraps that indicated the letter had been a long one. It required all
  Denny Horll's effort to maintain his assumption of indifference.</p>

  <p>"Nothing particular; just a begging letter, as far as I remember."</p>

  <p>The detective looked down at the ashes. The letter had not only been
  burnt, but it had been broken up by a poker. There was a suspicious
  depression in the low fire, as though it had been stirred especially for the
  purpose of destroying this document.</p>

  <p>Boscombe looked at the table again, then into the wastepaper-basket,
  stooped, and took out a crumpled sheet of paper. Smoothing it flat, he
  read:</p>

  <p>"Dearest, I don't know how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He found another sheet, and a third and a fourth, all the same size, and
  one began without address:</p>

  <p>"You will understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The detective looked at him hard for a long time.</p>

  <p>"You've been trying to write a letter to somebody, Mr. Horll?"</p>

  <p>Dennis nodded. "A friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply. Inspector Boscombe folded the sheets of paper and put
  them in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I'll come round and have a talk with you in the morning."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The fog still held, but was thinner on the outskirts of London. Not even
  the fastest of cars, chosen and stolen for the purpose, could contend against
  the handicap which nature imposed upon the brightest of "snap burglars."</p>

  <p>Darkey Cane and his two companions threaded their way painfully through
  the misty streets.</p>

  <p>"If it hampers us it hampers them," growled a confederate; and by "them"
  he meant those custodians of law and order whose duty and pleasure it was to
  checkmate such as he.</p>

  <p>Darkey, who was sitting by his side, his heavy overcoat turned up to his
  ears, grunted.</p>

  <p>"Fog has never stopped the working of a telephone yet. It's clearing
  &mdash;hit her up, Augustus!"</p>

  <p>It was certainly clearing; one could see two street lamps ahead. Beyond
  Kennington Oval the fog was a thinnish mist; the car increased in speed. They
  flew through Deptford and up Blackheath Hill. At the crest of the hill the
  road was almost clear. The car increased its speed. Suddenly ahead of them
  they saw a red lamp waving.</p>

  <p>"That's 'phone work," said Darkey philosophically, and added jocosely,
  "Kid him&mdash;he's only a copper."</p>

  <p>The machine flew past the signaller at fifty miles an hour.</p>

  <p>"I think&mdash;" began Darkey.</p>

  <p>That particular thought was never expressed. They were a hundred yards
  past the red lamp when there were four explosions so loud that they seemed as
  one. The Flying Squad that was looking for Darkey had thrown a band of canvas
  across the roadway, and that canvas was heavily laden with upturned nails.
  The machine swerved left and right, crashed into a lamp standard, and turned
  a complete somersault. By the time Darkey was on his feet he was entirely
  surrounded by blue uniforms. A hated voice&mdash;for he knew this particular
  detective-inspector&mdash;hailed him as a friend.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Darkey, for a job in Baker Street. Fan him, somebody."</p>

  <p>Big hands fanned Darkey very carefully. They ran down his vest and under
  his vest, his back and legs, but they did not find the revolver, for he had
  thrown that over the balustrade of Westminster Bridge as they had crawled
  across.</p>

  <p>"All right, it's a cop," said Darkey. His hand stole stealthily to his
  inside pocket, but before he could reach the packet the inspector had deftly
  removed it.</p>

  <p>It was in Greenwich police station that the contents of an envelope marked
  "Steffan Estate" were examined. Fifty sheets of quarto notepaper were
  revealed before the astonished eyes of Darkey Cane.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm&mdash;" he exploded.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have been caught," said the inspector, and examined the flap
  of the envelope again. He had not been surprised to find it open, thinking
  that Darkey had already made his investigations.</p>

  <p>Darkey sneered.</p>

  <p>"I ought to be murdered for trying to hold up a crook firm like Horlls.
  His father was a twister, and I'll bet he's worse. It's disgraceful, the way
  these lawyers are allowed to steal."</p>

  <p>"This is a matter, I think, which will interest Mr. Boscombe," said the
  police officer...</p>

  <p>At half-past two Dennis was still sitting at his desk. He picked up the
  revolver again, looked at it for a long time, then dropped it into a drawer
  of the desk. The old agony was to begin anew: the suspicion attaching to the
  name of Horll &amp; Son was solidified into a grisly fact. He could hear them
  saying, "Like father, like son." The Law Society would hold an inquiry, of
  course, and he would be struck off.</p>

  <p>He pulled open the center drawer, brought an envelope into view, and
  brought out the half-hoop of diamonds. The cruel little letter Norah had sent
  he had destroyed. He gazed, fascinated, at the jewel....</p>

  <p>He heard the knock on the outer door, looked up; the hands of the clock
  were pointing to a quarter after three. It was the police... Boscombe
  again.</p>

  <p>He went slowly down the stairs, stopping to switch on the light, and
  opened the front door. Standing, a shadowy figure in the fog, was a girl. For
  a moment he could not believe the evidence of his senses.</p>

  <p>"May I come in?" Her voice was little above a whisper.</p>

  <p>He opened the door wider. Norah went swiftly past him up the stairs. She
  had disappeared before he reached the first landing. He found her standing by
  the dead fire, white-faced, hollow-eyed. "I'm sorry, Denny." Her voice was
  husky and low. "Will you forgive me?" Her hands closed on his, and their
  iciness shocked him to wakefulness.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, what are you doing out at this time of night Have you
  heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Rex told me. He came home two hours ago. and, Denny, he was
  terribly&mdash;drunk! He was so boastful and weak that I couldn't even be
  sorry for him. And then he told me that the man he went to pay the money to
  wasn't there, and he gambled and won thousands. Denny, you've got to forgive
  him."</p>

  <p>Her numb fingers fumbled at the catch of her bag; she opened it, and took
  out a large packet of American bills. She laid them on the table.</p>

  <p>"He didn't touch a penny. He came in when you were out and took the money
  from the safe, and put a packet of writing-paper in its place. He knew where
  you kept your duplicate keys. It was horrible... beastly of him. And
  everything happened last night, Denny. Poor Uncle Lewis died."</p>

  <p>Dennis took up the notes like a man in a dream.</p>

  <p>"They are all there: I counted them&mdash;a hundred and ten thousand.
  You've got to forgive him, Denny: he's a weakling."</p>

  <p>"We are all weaklings," said Dennis Horll slowly; and his mind went to the
  last long letter he had written to her, the letter that had taken so long to
  compose and which was an agony to put on paper, and absent-mindedly his hand
  touched the drawer where lay the revolver with which he had planned a swift
  end to all his troubles.</p>

  <p>There were compensations other than the palpitating girl he held in his
  arms. The mental picture of the notorious Darkey cursing over a packet of
  valueless letter-heads was one of them.</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7">VII. &mdash; A TRYST WITH GHOSTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE upon a time, in the far-away days of war, there was a
  mythical or semi-mythical individuality whom the British Tommies named
  "Quiff." He was credited with a prescience which was quite inhuman. He knew
  when the divisions were mustering for attack; he warned commanders of
  impending raids; at his word battalion chiefs were superseded... for he had
  an uncanny instinct for weakness. He was the guardian angel of five hundred
  miles of trench line, and was visualized as a white-bearded gentleman, with a
  halo. When the enemy put a price on his head of 50,000 marks (in those days
  marks were real money), thus proving his tangibility, the line was immensely
  startled.</p>

  <p>Nigel Porter was sitting in the shade of his porch one warm day in early
  December, reading a Vancouver newspaper. It was the anniversary of a battle
  in which the Canadians had been heavily engaged, and the writer of the
  reminiscences which he was reading recalled the fact that "Quiff" had warned
  the British higher command of the coming attack. This interested Nigel
  considerably. Later he saw a brief reference to himself, and the mention of
  his having been blown up by a land mine.... The paper dropped from his hands,
  and he jumped with an exclamation. He picked the paper up and looked at the
  date. Then he went into his house&mdash;too big for a well-to-do
  bachelor&mdash;and began routing out cablegrams. In four days he was speeding
  eastward with two suit-cases and a sense of guilt.</p>

  <p>If anybody had asked him why he was taking that cold and very comfortless
  journey, he would have been ashamed to say. A man who owns farmlands in
  British Columbia views the barrier of the Rockies, which keeps in check the
  shrivelling winds that roar down from the frozen north, with the same
  satisfaction that a man, snuggled by a log fire, a pipe between his teeth and
  a book on his knee, might regard the frosted windows and the stout walls of
  the house that keeps from him the howling gale without.</p>

  <p>And here he was, a lover of comfort, and a man who grudged every second of
  the cold months that took him from sight of the Pacific and smell of cedar
  pine, tossing and pitching in the gray, wintry seas of the Atlantic, in the
  teeth of a nor'westerly gale. The ship was not a large one, the accommodation
  was fairly poor, his fellow-passengers... but there was a Compensation.</p>

  <p>The Compensation was amazing in many respects, for Nigel was not a woman's
  man, and was almost, if not wholly, unromantic. If you forgot the
  extraordinary mission which was bringing him across the December sea, you
  might have said that romance had no place in his equipment. The Compensation
  came aboard at New York, and their eyes met for the fraction of a second
  before she stumbled upon the slippery deck (it had been snowing) and was
  caught in his strong arms. There was a murmured apology, an embarrassed
  second of incoherence on his part, and then she had vanished. He did not see
  her till the second day out, and then, literally, he fell against her. He was
  on his way to the smoke-room, a journey which involved alternate climbing and
  sliding along the rubber-tiled alleyways, as bow and stern of the
  <i>Beranic</i> went up and down like delicately poised scales. Again she was
  in his arms for just as long a time as it might take to count three,
  quickly.</p>

  <p>On the fifth day he found her on deck, stretched in a chair, inadequately
  covered by a rug. A little self-consciously, he arranged the covering without
  invitation and they talked.</p>

  <p>Her name was Elsie Steyne, and she was traveling alone. She gave no
  explanation, such as fellow-passengers in the first moments of their
  confidence give to one another, for her solitary journey. When, after another
  day's acquaintance, he offered her the opportunity of telling him why she was
  coming to Europe in Christmas week, she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"...It is a queer season for holiday-making in Europe," she confessed,
  after a long and thoughtful pause, and then immediately; "but I am going to
  see my brother. He went over last week; it was arranged that I should spend
  Christmas with my mother in Ohio. But somehow... I am a little worried about
  him. And you, Mr. Porter? I suppose you are traveling on business?"</p>

  <p>Nigel's blue eyes twinkled for a second.</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly," he said, and she looked up at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he said humorously, "I have a tryst with a ghost!"</p>

  <p>To Nigel's astonishment he saw the color fade from her face. She struggled
  up into a sitting position and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"A tryst with a ghost?" she repeated, and her voice shook.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was dumbfounded by the effect that his words had produced
  on the girl, and he cursed himself for his grim jest. Probably she was
  nervous; there were people in the world in whom the word "ghost" produced a
  shiver.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, Miss Steyne," he said apologetically. "I am afraid I
  startled you."</p>

  <p>Her eyes did not leave his.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked huskily. "A tryst with a ghost? Where did
  you hear..."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly and, seeing the quick rise and fall of her breast,
  the pallor of her face, the queer, hunted look in her blue eyes, Nigel Porter
  became almost incoherent in his efforts to undo the mischief which his
  ill-timed remark had produced.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he began, and then, realizing how fantastical and absurd
  the explanation that he was on the point of making would sound, he laughed.
  "It was a startling thing to say, wasn't it? I am afraid I have a latent
  streak of melodrama in my composition. Won't you please forgive me?"</p>

  <p>She settled back in her chair, and for a while she gazed blankly out over
  the tumbling gray seas.</p>

  <p>"It was stupid of me," she said, "but my nerves aren't in very good order.
  Would you ask the steward to bring a cup of tea?"</p>

  <p>No further reference to his unfortunate <i>faux pas</i> was made. He saw
  her the next morning, when the ship was rolling through the English Channel
  and Devonshire was a gray blur on the northern horizon; and she was
  apparently so absorbed in the book she was reading that she only gave him a
  nod before she returned to a steadfast scrutiny of the printed page.</p>

  <p>The morning on which they reached Cherbourg, Nigel made an unpleasant
  discovery. He had been out of his cabin all the morning, walking the deck, in
  the hope of seeing the girl. She did not put in an appearance, however, and
  he went down to his cabin to prepare for lunch, with an unsatisfactory
  feeling that the morning had been wasted. It was then that he had his shock.
  Somebody had been in his cabin. A trunk which was under the bed had been
  pulled out, and a brief examination of its contents told him that it had been
  subjected to a hurried but thorough search. His passport, which he kept with
  other confidential papers under his pillow, was lying open on the bed. He
  rang the bell, and presently the steward came.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the man in surprise, "I've seen nobody in your cabin. I've
  been on this deck all morning. Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm sure," said Nigel irritably. "Look at this trunk. And
  that&mdash;I haven't opened that passport since I left New York."</p>

  <p>The steward looked round inadequately.</p>

  <p>"There's nobody been in your cabin, sir, as far as I know," he said. "Of
  course, I haven't been watching it all the time, because I've been in the
  other cabins, tidying up."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen any of the passengers near the cabin?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;yes, I have," he corrected himself. "I saw that young lady
  in 87, Miss Steyne. She came down this alleyway by mistake. Her cabin is two
  alleyways farther along."</p>

  <p>Nigel scratched his chin in perplexity. "Of course, it couldn't have been
  Miss Steyne," he said, and the steward, who was happy to agree that it could
  not have been anybody at all, nodded.</p>

  <p>"It has been a clean trip," he said. "There are none of the gangs on board
  that usually work the line, and yours is the first complaint we've
  had&mdash;would you like me to report this to the purser?"</p>

  <p>Nigel shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," he said.</p>

  <p>When the steward had gone, he made a search of his belongings to find if
  anything had been stolen; but although the intruder had evidently made a
  systematic search of his cabin, nothing was missing. With his passport had
  been a letter of credit, and this apparently had not been taken from its
  envelope. He was a fool, anyway, to leave important papers lying around, he
  thought, and congratulated himself that he had not suffered any important
  loss.</p>

  <p>For some reason he could not escape the conviction that the search of his
  cabin had been conducted with no other object than the examination of his
  passport. The intruder had been searching for a document. What that document
  was, Nigel could not guess, though he racked his brains for some plausible
  explanation.</p>

  <p>He saw the girl on the tender at Cherbourg, and to his surprise she was
  not only friendly but communicative.</p>

  <p>"I am going to Paris," she said. "You are going too, of course? Where are
  you staying?"</p>

  <p>"I am not going to Paris," said Nigel, with a little smile.</p>

  <p>Again that look of suspicion and doubt appeared in her eyes, but she made
  no further inquiries. He saw her through the Customs, and then made his way
  in a crazy taxi-cab to the town, where, if his cabled instructions had been
  carried out, the car would be waiting. He found it&mdash;an ancient French
  machine, but suitable for his purpose. His temptation was to stay the night
  in Cherbourg, but the time at his disposal was short. He had landed at the
  French port on the 24th, and he had less than twenty-four hours to reach his
  destination.</p>

  <p>As the car bumped and jolted along the <i>pavé</i> road that makes at long
  last for Calais, he could only wonder at himself. It did not seem real, and
  yet it was true that, a little more than a fortnight ago, he had been sitting
  in the sunlight of British Columbia, when there had come to him, in the
  nature of a shock, the realization that he was fast approaching the Christmas
  of 1921. Once he remembered the date, there was no other course for him to
  follow, being the man he was. He did not regret his lost comfort; he did not
  feel sorry for himself; he did not even regret that he was in a car of
  uncertain age, rattling through a driving blizzard that obscured all view,
  that made the <i>pavé</i> so slippery that the car skidded every five
  minutes. And even when, tired and hungry, with the dawn just showing in a
  gray sky, he came into the station square at Ypres, he did not regard his
  adventure as being outside the limitations of common sense.</p>

  <p>Ypres was changed, he noticed silently. Handsome red villas were going up
  in all directions. The Cloth Hall still pointed its maimed tower to the sky,
  and here and there, half covered with snow, he recognized a gaunt shell of a
  house that had been as familiar to him in those painful days of war as the
  Eros in Piccadilly Circus, or the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.</p>

  <p>Early as was the hour, there were workers abroad. A goods train was
  shunting noisily in a station which had been shelled out of existence in his
  days. Facing the station was a brand-new hotel, and he got down, gave an
  instruction to the weary-eyed French driver, and carried his bag into the
  dimly lit hallway. A sleepy man was sweeping the floor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur, Major Burns is here, but he is leaving by the early train
  for England. He has twice been down to look for you. I will tell him you have
  come."</p>

  <p>Nigel made his way to the big, bare dining-room, redolent of new paint,
  and lighted by one yellow carbon lamp. A table had been laid near the window
  for two. This he noted with satisfaction. Burns had evidently received his
  cable and the wire he had sent from Cherbourg.</p>

  <p>There was a quick step in the hall, and the Major, wearing his long
  military overcoat and (as usual) his cap perched rakishly on the side of his
  head, hurried in and offered a gloved hand.</p>

  <p>"I've been over to the station to fix my trunks. I'm going on a month's
  leave," he said. "So you've come back to the salient? They all do. Had some
  fellows here last week who knew you. We were talking of old 'Quiff.' Do you
  remember him? Wonder what happened to the old devil... never heard about
  him&mdash;hasn't even written a book! Do you remember that night when he
  tipped us off about the gas attack...?"</p>

  <p>The Major rattled on reminiscently. He was a red-faced man, with a bright,
  twinkling eye, and he was obviously amused. Men who are amused at seven
  o'clock on a raw, wintry morning, amidst the sorrowful shades of Ypres, may
  be written down as possessing a strong sense of humor.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I'm mad?" asked Nigel, when the other stopped.</p>

  <p>Major Burns pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said at last. "No, I really don't think so. I
  suppose that, having lived in the midst of so much madness these past years,
  one takes a generous view of human sanity. 'Joseph'"&mdash;he beckoned the
  waiter&mdash;"'coffee.' I can give you half an hour," he said to his
  <i>vis-à-vis</i>. "And by the way, here is the plan so far as I can
  reconstruct it from the old operation plans of 1917."</p>

  <p>He lugged out from his inside pocket a thin sheet of paper and spread it
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"There's Kelners Farm, there's Dead Horse Lane, and that's Windy Corner.
  You'll recognize Windy Corner; it's one of the few bits of the old
  battlefield that have been left. I had to get this, by the way, from the
  Belgians, because it was on their front, I think, that this happened. I must
  tell you that Houthulst Forest has entirely disappeared; you won't find any
  trace of it, except a few straggling trees... it's a perfect beast of a
  place, Nigel."</p>

  <p>Nigel was examining the plan, and now looked up as he folded the
  paper.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm mad?" he said again.</p>

  <p>"I don't, probably because my knowledge of the circumstances is more or
  less shaky. If I had a larger understanding of what occurred, perhaps I would
  be less charitable. I only know that you cabled me from British Columbia that
  you wanted me to discover the exact place where you had been blown up,
  because you wished to spend Christmas Day in the hole. Which reminds me that
  I had a Belgian officer in here yesterday&mdash;Colonel de Villiers&mdash;who
  said that the mine craters still exist."</p>

  <p>Again Nigel nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was lucky your being here. Luckier still that I remembered you were
  here, Burns," he said, and then: "I'll tell you the story. It happened on
  Christmas Eve of 1917. As a matter of fact, it happened on the twenty-third
  of December. I was attached to the French corps that was holding the
  southeastern edge of Houthulst Forest. I was working in connection with the
  Canadian Intelligence, and my instructions were to go over to discover the
  exact composition of the force that was holding the Belgian front. The G.O.C.
  wasn't at all satisfied with the intelligence he got from the Belgian staff,
  who were supposed to be <i>au fait</i> with these particulars, and of course
  the French had only recently come up, and were not in a position to give any
  accurate information."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked out of the window, and it came to him sadly that this
  was not the Ypres he knew, that smouldering furnace of a town, bombarded
  daily, hourly, every minute; rocked and shaken by high explosive shells, a
  town that rumbled and thundered night and day, year in and year out; a gray,
  dusty town, where long files of men crept cautiously under such walls as
  existed, on their way to the muddy inferno which lay along the ridges of the
  north. Sadly, for he was thinking of all the brave hearts that were stilled
  and the bright, boyish faces that had gone and were no more seen.</p>

  <p>"The curious thing was that, at the identical moment I went over into No
  Man's Land, a young German officer was sent to discover the exact composition
  of the French force that was holding this sector. We met half-way. To be
  exact, I stumbled over wire in the dark and slid down the edge of the
  crater&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Crater No. 17," murmured Major Burns. "The hole is about twenty metres
  away."</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was on the Hun before he knew what had happened. We both pulled our
  guns, and by the most extraordinary coincidence we both missed fire. It
  looked like being a real caveman's scrap, when the German chuckled and threw
  down his pistol.</p>

  <p>"'I think, my friend,' he said, 'we had better both go home again. It
  would be stupid for us to batter one another with our fists, for that would
  probably mean that we should both be killed in attempting to get back to our
  lines in a condition of exhaustion.'</p>

  <p>"The logic of it struck me, and we just sat down and talked. We not only
  talked, but we exchanged confidences of a highly compromising character. He
  told me that the 18th Bavarian Division was on our front, and I responded
  politely with the information that the 43rd French Division was on <i>his</i>
  front. He didn't seem as interested as he might have been. He produced a
  packet of sandwiches, I had a flask of whisky, and we sat and talked,
  until&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'It will be daylight soon,' he said. 'I think we'd better go home.'</p>

  <p>"So we shook hands, and we were half-way up the crumbling slope of the
  crater, when there broke out the most infernal fire that I had ever heard
  before or since. The air seemed to be so thick with traveling bullets and
  shells that you couldn't have put up a fishing-line without getting it cut in
  three places simultaneously!</p>

  <p>"'I think we'd better wait,' shouted the German.</p>

  <p>"So we retired again to the shell-hole, and prayed fervently&mdash;at
  least I did&mdash;that 'shorts' on either side would be few, and in other
  directions than ours. Dawn broke, and the fury of the fire did not abate. And
  then I found myself talking about things I never thought I would ever discuss
  with a German. He didn't tell me a great deal about himself, except that he
  was an officer in a Bavarian regiment. His English was perfect. I could have
  sworn, when I first saw him, that he was an American. Well, to cut a long
  story short, there we sat throughout the day. Christmas Eve came, and there
  was no slackening of the fire. Every gun, big and little, on both sides was
  in action, and we spent the night counting Verey lights and speculating upon
  what was the cause of this unseemly disturbance. Christmas Day came, but
  still there was practically no reduction of fire. I afterwards discovered
  that this was the preliminary bombardment to an attack which the French
  commander had planned, and which he hoped would bring the Forest into his
  hands. Poor soul! He never lived to know what a hell-trap that forest was!
  Later in the morning the fire seemed to die down just a little, and I crawled
  to the edge of the shell-hole to take observation. What happened I don't
  know. I woke up to find my head on the German's knee, and he was draining the
  last dregs of my whisky flask down my throat. My head was wet and aching, my
  eyes seemed to be filled with sand.</p>

  <p>"'Shell fragment,' he said. 'I don't think you're badly hurt. I have two
  sandwiches and half a bottle of water left. We look like having a peach of a
  Christmas Day.'"</p>

  <p>"What was his name&mdash;did you find that out?" asked Burns
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Karl&mdash;that was all he told me," replied Nigel. "That fellow was some
  prophet! I think both sides must have brought up all their reserves of
  artillery and trebled their stock of machine-guns. It was when I realized
  that we had had no 'Quiff' message from G.H.Q. that I knew the initiative was
  on our side. It was toward the evening that Karl said:</p>

  <p>"'If we get through this, my friend, I should like to have a little dinner
  with you somewhere.'</p>

  <p>"'When and where?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"He thought a long time before he answered.</p>

  <p>"'Maybe we shan't get through,' he said. 'But I'll tell you what I will
  do. If I am alive in four years' time, I will come and meet you here; and if
  you're not here, well, I'll keep a tryst with your ghost.'"</p>

  <p>"Why four years?" asked Burns.</p>

  <p>"He thought the war would last another three. He made it four to give us a
  chance of getting a peace. Of course, it was lunatic, it was childish, it was
  anything you like to call it, but there and then we made our agreement. It
  was the sort of thing that schoolgirls do, and... anyway, there's something
  peculiarly simple and infantile about the full-grown soldier.</p>

  <p>"It was eleven o'clock that night that the French fired the mine. My own
  impression was that it was just underneath where I was sitting, but my
  recollections of the circumstances are necessarily hazy. I just remember
  saying to Karl that I had a passion for marrons glacés, when I felt somebody
  slapping my face, and looked up into the eyes of an English surgeon who was
  in his shirt-sleeves. I just remember hearing him say 'He's all right,' and
  then I sort of dozed myself out of Belgium and woke up in an English
  hospital. The body of Karl was found and buried on the very edge of the
  crater. We took the ground and lost it, took it again and lost it again, but
  I know he was found, because the officer who picked me up after the mine was
  exploded was in the next bed to me in hospital, and he told me all about it,
  how they found this poor chap quite dead and buried him."</p>

  <p>"Hum!" said Major Burns, gulping down his coffee. "I think you're a fool,
  but it's the sort of fool thing I should have done myself."</p>

  <p>He scrutinized the lowering skies through the window.</p>

  <p>"You're going to have a cold Christmas Day, my lad," he said.</p>

  <p>"I never expected any other."</p>

  <p>Just before noon Nigel came out of the hotel with a basket, a bottle of
  wine, and a box of cigars, which he stowed away in one of the car's pockets.
  He himself went to the wheel, and in a few minutes was passing slowly
  westward. The car sped down a perfectly gravelled road, and passed cemetery
  upon cemetery crowded with white crosses, whiter for the rim of snow which
  lay upon their edges, and presently, turning abruptly from the main road, he
  came almost instantly into a region of desolation. The new red buildings were
  behind him. The road was no longer a road, it was a succession of deep holes
  and ruts. Sharp-cornered paving-blocks jagged up from the sodden earth, stark
  walls that had once been houses loomed through the sleet on either side.
  Broken and jagged barbed wire, red with rust, trailed its tangled lengths by
  the roadside, and here and there he saw the drunken outlines of block-houses
  where men had lived horribly and had died in fear. Presently the car was
  lurching between flat heaps of rubble that the rains of the years had washed
  and pounded into little unrecognizable plateaux. A village had been here
  once. Rotting weeds showed where love and life had been, and holes gaped in
  the roadway before a medley of black, wrought-iron crosses which marked a
  graveyard that had been set around a church. There was no church.</p>

  <p>These sights were too familiar to sadden him, though now it seemed, in the
  years of peace, that the ugliness of war was emphasized more strongly. He
  came at last, by the aid of his map, and after constant backings and changing
  of direction, and guided at the very last by a miserable-looking man who
  lived with his family in a deserted dug-out, to the edge of what was once a
  forest but was now nothing. For all that was left of the trees were blackened
  stumps and dead white stems that stood starkly against the cold sky.</p>

  <p>He stopped his car, got out and took his bearings, and instinctively he
  went straight to the place he sought. The hole was deep: it was half filled
  with yellow water. To the right was a smaller hole, also water-logged, and he
  smiled faintly, contrasting the calm of that winter day with no other sound
  in his ear but the sough and sigh of the wind that swept down from the dunes,
  and the tawny sea beyond, with the deafening fury of the storm that swept
  this spot four years before. There was the grave: he saw it at once, a small
  black cross above a slab of concrete that the Government had laid down to
  prevent farmers ploughing ground hallowed by sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Bending down, he read: "Allemand." Karl was "Allemand." In small letters
  was the word "officer." It was not usual to distinguish the rank of the dead.
  That was all. It stood for life and humor and courage, and God knows what
  hope. It stood also for an enemy, but that was incidental and meant nothing
  to Nigel Porter, sitting there on the edge of the crater, with his fur collar
  pulled up about his ears.</p>

  <p>His eyes roved around the starved landscape. It was such a foul setting
  for the rare jewel of a soul.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friend," he said&mdash;his tone was one of heavy jocularity;
  insensibly he had recalled, and was reproducing, the very tone of the man
  whom he apostrophised&mdash;"here am I, after four years! I owe you an
  apology, because I nearly forgot my promise. If I hadn't read in a Vancouver
  newspaper some highly flattering references to my services during the war, I
  should certainly have broken my promise."</p>

  <p>There was such quiet dignity in that black cross, such serenity in the
  truncated pyramid of concrete that marked the abiding-place of this
  "Allemand, officer," that his voice died down. The dead are so immensely
  superior to the living that he felt abashed.</p>

  <p>He sat for a long time, his gloved hands crossed on his knees, his head
  bent forward in thought, and then he got up with a sigh and dusted his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" he began, and his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>Standing on the farther rim of the crater was a tall figure, draped from
  neck to feet in a long, dark cloak. It was bareheaded, and the wind had blown
  a lock of fair hair across the forehead of the man. Nigel stared
  open-mouthed, speechless, and then:</p>

  <p>"Karl!" he croaked.</p>

  <p>The voiceless figure stirred.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! I thought you were a ghost."</p>

  <p>In a dozen strides Nigel had flown round the edge of the crater and
  gripped the outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here!" he asked huskily.... "Stupid question to ask,
  but you are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm keeping a tryst with a ghost," he said, with a twinkle in his eyes.
  "You see, I thought you were... dead. When our people took the ground they
  found a grave here."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he gripped the other by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of this beastliness," he said. "My God! How hideous war
  is!"</p>

  <p>They had nearly reached the sunken road where the stranger's car was
  waiting, when Nigel remembered that he had some responsibility in the matter
  of transportation.</p>

  <p>"You can go back for it. I want to introduce you to my sister. By the way,
  my name is Steyne."</p>

  <p>And there Nigel found the girl.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was after dinner in the barrack-like dining-room of the Hotel d'Ypres
  that Nigel Porter heard and understood.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not a German," said Mr. Charles Steyne, pulling gently at his
  cigar, "I am an American. I was in the war from the very first month."</p>

  <p>"On the German side?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I was on the German side. That is to say, I wore the German
  uniform and served in the German Intelligence Department. There were five of
  us originally, and we were employed by the most effective secret service that
  the world has ever known. I speak respectfully of Great Britain. Of the five
  only one is left alive. Taylor was shot in Hanover after being tried by
  court-martial for running the secret wireless by which the British were
  informed of the movement of German ships. Jack Holtz suffered a like fate on
  the Russian frontier, when he was trying to get through to the Russian
  headquarters the news of the German concentration&mdash;he owed his death to
  the treachery of the Russian General Staff, by the way; and Micky Thomas was
  killed by a night watchman at the German Foreign Office after he had got away
  with some very important documents which were necessary to your Whitehall.
  Long Bill Fenner was accidentally killed by an aeroplane bomb dropped by an
  American airman. And I was almost, but not quite, destroyed by the explosion
  of a mine.... Well, you know that story. If Elsie had only told me that she
  had met you on the ship, and had given me a hint about your keeping a tryst
  with ghosts&mdash;a phrase of mine, by the way, which, coming from you, so
  startled her that she nearly jumped out of her skin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nigel was looking at the girl, and under his eyes the color came to her
  face, for she had anticipated the question which was coming.</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to see my passport, Miss Steyne?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I can answer that," replied Charles Steyne. "My sister doesn't
  realize that war ever ends, and that the price the Germans put on the head of
  their pet enemy is no longer offered. She pictured you a member of the
  Government, tracking down the shy and elusive Quiff&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quiff!" gasped Nigel. "Then you were&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was on my way to the French lines to tell the General not to attack. If
  I had told you I was 'Quiff' you would not have believed me."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Nigel sat back in his chair and stared at the girl, but she
  averted her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad... you're not exactly German," he said, a little gauchely. "I
  don't believe in mixed marriages.... I mean...."</p>

  <p>The ghost smiled wisely.</p>

  <h2><a name="story8"
     id="story8">VIII. &mdash; THE GREEK POROPULOS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, November 19,
  1910<br></h3>

  <p class="first">AT Carolina, in the Transvaal, was a store kept by a man
  named Lioski, who was a Polish Jew. There was an officers' clubhouse, the
  steward of which was a Greek sportsman named Poropulos, and this story is
  about these two men, and about an officer of Hampton's Scouts who took too
  much wine and saw a pair of boots.</p>

  <p>I have an intense admiration for George Poropulos, and I revere his
  memory. I admire him for his nerve; though, for the matter of that, his nerve
  was no greater than mine.</p>

  <p>Long before the war came, when the negotiations between Great Britain and
  the Transvaal Government were in the diplomatic stage, I drifted to Carolina
  from the Rand, leaving behind me in the golden city much of ambition, hope,
  and all the money I had brought with me from England. I came to South Africa
  with a young wife and £370&mdash;within a few shillings&mdash;because the
  doctors told me the only chance I had was in such a hot, dry climate as the
  highlands of Africa afforded. For my own part, there was a greater attraction
  in the possibility of turning those few hundreds of mine into thousands, for
  Johannesburg was in the delirium of a boom.</p>

  <p>I left Johannesburg nearly penniless. I could not, at the moment, explain
  the reason of my failure, for the boom continued, and I had the advantage of
  the expert advice of Arthur Lioski, who was staying at the same boarding
  house as myself.</p>

  <p>There were malicious people who warned me against Lioski. His own
  compatriots, sharp men of business, told me to 'ware Lioski, but I ignored
  the advice because I was very confident in my own judgment, and Lioski was a
  plausible, handsome man, a little flashy in appearance, but decidedly a
  beautiful animal.</p>

  <p>He was in Johannesburg on a holiday, he said. He had stores in various
  parts of the country where he sold everything from broomsticks to farm
  wagons, and he bore the evidence of his prosperity.</p>

  <p>He took us to the theater, or rather he took Lillian, for I was too seedy
  to go out much. I did not grudge Lillian the pleasure. Life was very dull for
  a young girl whose middle-aged husband had a spot on his lung, and Lioski was
  so kind and gentlemanly, so far as Lil was concerned, that the only feeling I
  had in the matter was one of gratitude.</p>

  <p>He was tall and dark, broad-shouldered, with a set to his figure and a
  swing of carriage that excited my admiration. He was possessed of enormous
  physical strength, and I have seen him take two quarreling Kaffirs&mdash;men
  of no ordinary muscularity&mdash;and knock their heads together.</p>

  <p>He had an easy, ready laugh, a fund of stories, some a little coarse, I
  thought, and a florid gallantry which must have been attractive to women. Lil
  always brightened up wonderfully after an evening with him.</p>

  <p>His knowledge of mines and mining propositions was bewildering. I left all
  my investments in his hands, and it proves something of my trust in him, that
  when, day by day, he came to me for money, to "carry over"
  stock&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;I paid without hesitation. Not only did
  I lose every penny I possessed, but I found myself in debt to him to the
  extent of a hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>Poor Lil! I broke the news to her of my ruin, and she took it badly;
  reproached, stormed, and wept in turn, but quieted down when I told her that
  in the kindness of his heart, Lioski had offered me a berth at his Carolina
  store. I was to get a £16 a month, half of which was to be paid in stores at
  wholesale prices and the other half in cash. I was to live rent free in a
  little house near the store. I was delighted with the offer. It was an
  immediate rise, though I foresaw that the conditions of life would be much
  harder than the life to which I had been accustomed in England. We traveled
  down the Delagoa line to Middleburg, and found a Cape cart waiting to carry
  us across the twenty miles of rolling veldt. The first six months in Carolina
  were the happiest I have ever spent. The work in the store was not
  particularly arduous. I found that it had the reputation of being one of the
  best-equipped stores in the Eastern Transvaal, and certainly we did a huge
  business for so small a place. It was not on the town we depended, but upon
  the surrounding country. Lioski did not come back with us, but after we had
  been installed for a week he came and took his residence in the store.</p>

  <p>All went well for six months. He taught Lil to ride and drive, and every
  morning they went cantering over the veldt together. Me he treated more like
  a brother than an employee, and I found myself hotly resenting the
  uncharitable things that were said about him, for Carolina, like other small
  African towns, was a hotbed of gossip.</p>

  <p>Lil was happy for that six months, and then I began to detect a change in
  her attitude toward me. She was snappy, easily offended, insisted upon having
  her own room&mdash;to which I agreed, for, although my chest was better, I
  still had an annoying cough at night which might have been a trial to anybody
  within hearing.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that I met Poropulos. He came into the store on a
  hot day in January, a little man of forty-five or thereabouts. He was
  unusually pale, and had a straggling, weedy beard. His hair was long, his
  clothes were old and stained, and so much of his shirt as was revealed at his
  throat was sadly in need of laundering.</p>

  <p>Yet he was cheerful and <i>debonair</i>&mdash;and singularly flippant. He
  stalked in the store, looked around critically, nodded to me, and smiled.
  Then he brought his <i>sjambok</i> down on the counter with a smack.</p>

  <p>"Where's Shylock?" he asked easily.</p>

  <p>I am afraid that I was irritated.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean Mr. Lioski?"</p>

  <p>"Shylock, I said," he repeated. "Shylockstein, the Lothario of Carolina."
  He smacked the counter again, still smiling.</p>

  <p>I was saved the trouble of replying, for at that moment Lioski entered. He
  stopped dead and frowned when he saw the Greek.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, you little beast," he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>For answer, the man leaned up against the counter, ran his fingers through
  his straggling beard, and cocked his head.</p>

  <p>"I want justice," he said unctuously&mdash;"the restoration of money
  stolen. I want to send a wreath to your funeral: I want to write your
  biography&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Clear out," shouted Lioski. His face was purple with anger, and he
  brought his huge fist down upon the counter with a crash that shook the
  wooden building.</p>

  <p>He might have been uttering the most pleasant of compliments, for all the
  notice the Greek took.</p>

  <p>Crash! went Lioski's fist on the counter.</p>

  <p>Smash! came Poropulos's <i>sjambok</i>, and there was something mocking
  and derisive in his action that made Lioski mad.</p>

  <p>With one spring he was over the counter, a stride and he had his hand on
  the Greek's collar&mdash;and then he stepped back quickly with every drop of
  blood gone from his face, for the Greek's knife had flashed under his eyes. I
  thought Lioski was stabbed, but it was fear that made him white.</p>

  <p>The Greek rested the point of the knife on the counter and twiddled it
  round absentmindedly, laying his palm on the hilt and spinning it with great
  rapidity.</p>

  <p>"Nearly did it that time, my friend," he said, with a note of regret,
  "nearly did it that time&mdash;I shall be hanged for you yet."</p>

  <p>Lioski was white and shaking.</p>

  <p>"Come in here," he said in a low voice, and the little Greek followed him
  to the back parlor. They were together for about an hour; sometimes I could
  hear Mr. Lioski's voice raised angrily, sometimes Poropulos's little laugh.
  When they came out again the Greek was smiling still and smoking one of my
  employer's cigars.</p>

  <p>"My last word to you," said Lioski huskily, "is this&mdash;keep your mouth
  closed and keep away from me."</p>

  <p>"And my last word to you," said Poropulos, jauntily puffing at the cigar,
  "is this&mdash;turn honest, and enjoy a sensation."</p>

  <p>He stepped forth from the store with the air of one who had gained a moral
  victory.</p>

  <p>I never discovered what hold the Greek had over my master. I gatherered
  that at some time or another, Poropulos had lost money, and that he held
  Lioski responsible.</p>

  <p>In some mysterious way Poropulos and I became friends. He was an
  adventurer of a type. He bought and sold indifferent mining propositions,
  took up contracts, and, I believe, was not above engaging in the Illicit Gold
  Buying business. His attitude to Lillian was one of complete adoration. When
  he was with her his eyes never left her face.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that my great sorrow came to me. Lioski went away
  to Durban&mdash;to buy stock, he said&mdash;and a few days afterwards
  Lillian, who had become more and more exigent, demanded to be allowed to go
  to Cape Town for a change.</p>

  <p>I shall remember that scene.</p>

  <p>I was at breakfast in the store when she came in. She was white, I
  thought, but her pallor suited her, with her beautiful black hair and great
  dark eyes.</p>

  <p>She came to the point without any preliminary. "I want to go away," she
  said.</p>

  <p>I looked up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Go away, dear? Where?"</p>

  <p>She was nervous. I could see that from the restless movement of her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I want to go to&mdash;to Cape Town&mdash;I know a girl there &mdash;I'm
  sick of this place&mdash;I hate it!"</p>

  <p>She stamped her foot, and I thought that she was going to break into a fit
  of weeping. Her lips trembled, and for a time she could not control her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be ill if you don't let me go," she said at last. "I can
  feel&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"But the money, dear," I said, for it was distressing to me that I could
  not help her toward the holiday she wanted.</p>

  <p>"I can find the money," she said, in an unsteady voice. "I have got a few
  pounds saved&mdash;the allowance you gave me for my clothes&mdash;I didn't
  spend it all&mdash;let me go, Charles&mdash;please, please!"</p>

  <p>I drove her to the station, and took her ticket for Pretoria. I would have
  taken her to the capital, but I had the store to attend to.</p>

  <p>"By the way, what will your address be?" I asked just as the train was
  moving off.</p>

  <p>She was leaning over the gate of the car platform, looking at me
  strangely.</p>

  <p>"I will wire it&mdash;I have it in my bag," she called out, and I watched
  the tail of the train round the curve, with an aching heart. There was
  something wrong; what it was I could not understand. Perhaps I was a fool. I
  think I was.</p>

  <p>I think I have said that I had made friends with Poropulos. Perhaps it
  would be more truthful to say that he made friends with me, for he had to
  break down my feeling of distrust and disapproval. Then, again, I was not
  certain how Mr. Lioski would regard such a friendship, but, to my surprise,
  he took very little notice of it or, for the matter of that, of me.</p>

  <p>Poropulos came into the store the night my wife left. Business was slack;
  there was war in the air, rumors of ultimatums had been persistent, and the
  Dutch farmers had avoided the store.</p>

  <p>A week passed, and I began to worry, for I had not heard from Lil. I had
  had a letter from Lioski, telling me that in view of the unsettled condition
  of the country he was extending his stay in Durban for a fortnight. The
  letter gave me the fullest instructions as to what I was to do in case war
  broke out, but, unfortunately, I had no opportunity of putting them into
  practice.</p>

  <p>The very day I received the letter, a Boer commando rode into Carolina,
  and at the head of it rode the Landrost Peter du Huis, a pleasant man, whom I
  knew slightly. He came straight to the store, dismounted, and entered.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Gray," he said. "I fear that I come on unpleasant
  business."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I have come to commandeer your stock in the name of the Republic," he
  said, "and to give you the tip to clear out."</p>

  <p>It does not sound possible, but it is nevertheless a fact that in two
  hours I had left Carolina, leaving Lioski's store in the hands of the Boers,
  and bringing with me receipts signed by the Landrost for the goods he had
  commandeered. In four hours I was in a cattle truck with a dozen other
  refugees on my way to Pretoria&mdash;for I had elected to go to Durban to
  inform Lioski at first hand of what had happened.</p>

  <p>Of the journey down to the coast it is not necessary to speak. We were
  sixty hours <i>en route</i>; we were without food, and had little to drink.
  At Ladysmith I managed to get a loaf of bread and some milk; at Maritzburg I
  got my first decent meal. But I arrived in Durban, tired, dispirited, and
  hungry. Lioski was staying at the Royal, and as soon as I got to the station
  I hailed a <i>ricksha</i> to take me there.</p>

  <p>There had been no chance of telegraphing. The wires were blocked with
  government messages. We had passed laden troop trains moving up to the
  frontier, and had cheered the quiet men in khaki who were going, all of them,
  to years of hardship and privation, many of them to death.</p>

  <p>The vestibule of the Royal was crowded, but I made my way to the
  office.</p>

  <p>"Lioski?" said the clerk. "Mr. and Mrs. Lioski, No. 84&mdash;you'll find
  your way to their sitting room."</p>

  <p>I went slowly up the stairs, realizing in a flash the calamity.</p>

  <p>I did not blame Lil; it was a hard life I had brought her to. I had been
  selfish, as sick men are selfish, inconsiderate.</p>

  <p>They stood speechless, as I opened the door and entered. I closed the door
  behind me. Still they stood, Lil as pale as death, with terror and shame in
  her eyes, Lioski in a black rage.</p>

  <p>"Well?" It was he who broke the silence.</p>

  <p>He was defiant, shameless, and as I went on to talk about what had
  happened at the store, making no reference to what I had seen, his lips
  curled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>But Lil, womanlike, rushed in with explanations. She had meant to go to
  Cape Town&mdash;the train service had been bad&mdash;she had decided to go to
  Durban&mdash;Mr. Lioski had been kind enough to book her a
  room&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>I let her go on. When she had finished I handed my receipts to Lioski.</p>

  <p>"That ends our acquaintance, I think."</p>

  <p>"As you like," he replied with a shrug.</p>

  <p>I turned to Lillian.</p>

  <p>"Come, my dear," I said, but she made no move, and I saw Lioski smile
  again.</p>

  <p>I lost all control over myself and leaped at him, but his big fist caught
  me before I could reach him, and I went down, half stunned. I was no match
  for him. I knew that, and if the blow did nothing else, it sobered me. I
  picked myself up. I was sick with misery and hate.</p>

  <p>"Come, Lil," I said again.</p>

  <p>She was looking at me, and I thought I saw a look of disgust in her face.
  I did not realize that I was bleeding, and that I must have been a most
  unpleasant figure. I only knew that she loathed me at that moment, and I
  turned on my heel and left them, my own wife and the big man who had broken
  me.</p>

  <p>One forgets things in war time. I joined the Imperial Light Horse and went
  to the front. The doctor passed me as sound, so I suppose that all that is
  claimed for the climate of Africa is true.</p>

  <p>We went into Ladysmith, and I survived the siege. I was promoted for
  bringing an officer out of action under fire. I earned a reputation for
  daring, which I did not deserve, because always I was courting swift death,
  and taking risks to that end.</p>

  <p>Before Buller's force had pushed a way through the stubborn lines to our
  relief, I had received my commission. More wonderful to me, I found myself a
  perfectly healthy man, as hard as nails, as callous as the most-experienced
  soldier. Only, somewhere down in my heart, a little worm gnawed all the time;
  sleeping or waking, fighting or resting, I thought of Lillian, and wondered,
  wondered, wondered.</p>

  <p>Ladysmith was relieved. We marched on toward Pretoria. I was transferred
  to Hampton's Horse with the rank of major, and for eighteen months I moved up
  and down the Eastern Transvaal chasing a will-o'-the-wisp of a commandant,
  who was embarrassing the blockhouse lines.</p>

  <p>Then one day I came upon Poropulos.</p>

  <p>We were encamped outside Standerton when he rode in on a sorry-looking
  Burnto pony. He had been in the country during the war, he said, buying and
  selling horses. He did not mention Lioski's name to me, and so studiously did
  he avoid referring to the man, that I saw at once that he knew.</p>

  <p>It was brought home to me by his manner that he had a liking for me that I
  had never guessed. In what way I had earned his regard I cannot say, but it
  was evident he entertained a real affection for me.</p>

  <p>We parted after an hour's chat&mdash;he was going back to Carolina. He had
  a scheme for opening an officers' club in that town, where there was always a
  large garrison, and to which the wandering columns came from time to time to
  be re-equipped.</p>

  <p>As for me, I continued the weary chase of the flying commando. Trek, trek,
  trek, in fierce heat, in torrential downpour, over smooth veldt and broken
  hills, skirmishing, sniping, and now and then a sharp engagement, with a
  dozen casualties on either side.</p>

  <p>Four months passed, and the column was ordered into Carolina for a refit.
  I went without qualms, though I knew she was there, and Lioski was there.</p>

  <p>We got into Carolina in a thunderstorm, and the men were glad to reach a
  place that bore some semblance of civilization. My brother officers, after
  our long and profitless trek, were overjoyed at the prospect of a decent
  dinner&mdash;for Poropulos's club was already famous among the columns.</p>

  <p>My horse picked up a stone and went dead lame, so I stayed behind to
  doctor him, and rode to Carolina two hours after the rest of the column had
  arrived.</p>

  <p>It was raining heavily as I came over a fold of the hill that showed the
  straggling township. There was no human being in sight save a woman who stood
  by the roadside, waiting, and I knew instinctively, long before I reached
  her, that it was Lillian. I cantered toward her. Her face was turned in my
  direction, and she stood motionless as I drew rein and swung myself to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>She was changed, not as I expected, for sorrow and suffering had
  etherealized her. Her big eyes burned in a face that was paler than ever, her
  lips, once so red and full, were almost white.</p>

  <p>"I have been waiting for you," she said.</p>

  <p>"Have you, dear? You are wet."</p>

  <p>She shook her head impatiently. I slipped off my mackintosh and put it
  about her.</p>

  <p>"He has turned me out," she said.</p>

  <p>She did not cry. I think she had not recovered from the shock. Something
  stirred from the thin cloak she was wearing; a feeble cry was muffled by the
  wrapping.</p>

  <p>"I have got a little girl," she said, "but she is dying." She began to cry
  silently, the tears running down her wet face in streams.</p>

  <p>I took her into Carolina, and found a Dutchwoman who put her and the baby
  to bed, and gave her some coffee.</p>

  <p>I went up to the officers' club just after sunset and met Poropulos coming
  down.</p>

  <p>He was in a terrible rage, and was muttering to himself in some tongue I
  could not understand.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are!"&mdash;he almost spat the words in his anger
  &mdash;"that dog Lioski&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He was about to say something, but checked himself. I think it was about
  Lillian that he intended to speak at first, but he changed the subject to
  another grievance. "I was brought before the magistrate and fined £100 for
  selling field-force tobacco. My club will be ruined &mdash;Lioski informed
  the police&mdash;by&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He was incoherent in his passion. I gather that he had been engaged in
  some shady business, and that Lioski had detected him. He almost danced
  before me in the rain.</p>

  <p>"Shylock dies tonight," he said, and waved his enemy out of the world with
  one sweep of his hand. "He dies tonight&mdash;I am weary of him&mdash;for
  eighteen&mdash;nineteen years I have known him, and he's dirt right
  through&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He went out without another word. I stood on the slope of the hill
  watching him.</p>

  <p>I dined at the club, and went straight back to the house where I had left
  my wife. She was sleeping&mdash;but the baby was dead. Poor little mortal! I
  owed it no grudge, but I was glad when they told me.</p>

  <p>All the next day I sat by her bed listening to Lillian's mutterings, for
  she was very ill. I suffered all the tortures of a damned soul sitting there,
  for she spoke of Lioski&mdash;"Arthur" she called him&mdash;prayed to him for
  mercy&mdash;told him she loved him&mdash;</p>

  <p>I was late for dinner at the club. There was a noisy crowd there. Young
  Harvey of my own regiment had had too much to drink, and I avoided his
  table.</p>

  <p>My hand shook as I poured out a glass of wine, and somebody remarked on
  it.</p>

  <p>I did not see Poropulos until the dinner was halfway through. Curiously
  enough, I looked at the clock as he came in, and the hands pointed to half
  past eight.</p>

  <p>The Greek was steward of the club, and was serving the wine. He was calm,
  impassive, remarkably serene, I thought. He exchanged jokes with the officers
  who were grumbling that they had had to wait for the fulfillment of their
  orders.</p>

  <p>"It was ten to eight when I ordered this," grumbled one man.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, Harvey, who had been regarding Poropulos with drunken
  gravity, pointed downward.</p>

  <p>"He's changed his boots," he said, and chuckled. Poropulos smiled amiably
  and went on serving. "He's changed his boots!" repeated Harvey, concentrating
  his mind upon trivialities as only a drunken man can. The men laughed. "Oh,
  dry up, Harvey!" said somebody.</p>

  <p>"He's changed&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He got no further. Through the door came a military policeman, splashed
  from head to foot with mud.</p>

  <p>"District Commandant here, sir?" he demanded. "There's been a man
  murdered."</p>

  <p>"Soldier?" asked a dozen voices.</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;storekeeper, name of Lioski&mdash;shot dead half an hour
  ago."</p>

  <p>I do not propose to tell in detail all that happened following that. Two
  smart C.I.D. men came down from Johannesburg, made a few inquiries, and
  arrested Poropulos. He was expecting the arrest, and half an hour before the
  officers came he asked me to go to him.</p>

  <p>I spent a quarter of an hour with him, and what we said is no man's
  business but ours. He told me something that startled me&mdash;he loved
  Lillian, too. I had never guessed it, but I did not doubt him. But it was
  finally for Lillian's sake that he made me swear an oath so dreadful that I
  cannot bring myself to write it down&mdash;an oath so unwholesome, and so
  against the grain of a man, that life after it could only be a matter of
  sickness and shame.</p>

  <p>Then the police came and took him away.</p>

  <p>Lioski had been shot dead in the store by some person who had walked in
  when the store was empty, at a time when there was nobody in the street. This
  person had shot the Jew dead and walked out again. The police theory was that
  Poropulos had gone straight from the club, in the very middle of dinner, had
  committed the murder, and returned to continue his serving, and the crowning
  evidence was the discovery that he had changed his boots between 7.30 and
  8.30. The mud-stained boots were found in a cellar, and the chain of evidence
  was completed by the statement of a trooper who had seen the Greek walking
  from the direction of the store, at 8.10, with a revolver in his hand.</p>

  <p>Poropulos was cheerful to the last&mdash;cheerful through the trial,
  through the days of waiting in the fort at Johannesburg.</p>

  <p>"I confess nothing," he said to the Greek priest. "I hated Lioski, and I
  am glad that he is dead, that is all. It is true that I went down to kill
  him, but it was too late."</p>

  <p>When they pinioned him he turned to me.</p>

  <p>"I have left my money to you," he said. "There is about four thousand
  pounds. You will look after her."</p>

  <p>"That is the only reason I am alive."</p>

  <p>"Did you murder Arthur Lioski?" said the priest again.</p>

  <p>"No," said Poropulos, and smiled as he went to his death. And what he said
  was true, as I know. I shot Lioski.</p>
