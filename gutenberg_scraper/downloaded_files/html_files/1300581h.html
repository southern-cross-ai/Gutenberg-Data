  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Mrs. Jackson!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jackson was feeding her ducks at the beck behind the house. But the
  kitchen door stood open, and she not only heard her name, but recognised the
  voice which shouted it.</p>

  <p>"It's Mr. Gordon," she said to the servant who was with her, and she
  bustled through the kitchen into the parlour, drying her hands with her apron
  as she went.</p>

  <p>David Gordon stood by the window, looking dreamily out across the fields.
  He turned as she entered the room, and shook hands with her.</p>

  <p>"I have given you a surprise," he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You have, indeed, Mr. Gordon. I never expected to see you again at
  Wastdale Head. You should have written you were coming."</p>

  <p>And she proceeded to light the fire.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know myself that I was coming until yesterday."</p>

  <p>"It is three years since you were here."</p>

  <p>"Three years," Gordon repeated slowly. "Yes! I did not realise it until I
  caught sight of the farm-house again."</p>

  <p>"You will be wanting breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"The sooner, the better. I have walked from Boot."</p>

  <p>"Already?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't seem really far;" and a smile broke over his face as he
  added&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I heard my marriage bells ringing all the way across Burnmoor."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jackson retired to the kitchen to prepare breakfast and to ponder
  over his remark. The result of her reflections was shown in the unusual
  strength of the tea and in an extra thickness of butter on the toast. She
  decked the table with an assortment of jams, and carefully closed the door
  which opened into the lane, although the April sunlight was pouring through
  it in a warm flood. It seemed as if Gordon had gained an additional value and
  herself an additional responsibility. She even took a cushion from the sofa
  and placed it on his chair, and then waited on him while he breakfasted,
  nodding and smiling a discreet but inquisitive sympathy.</p>

  <p>On Gordon, however, her pantomime was lost. His thoughts no longer chimed
  to marriage bells. For Wastdale, and this farmhouse in particular, were
  associated in his mind with the recollection of two friends, of whom one was
  dead in reality, the other dead to him; and always vividly responsive to the
  impression of the moment, he had stepped back across the interval of the past
  three years, and now dwelled with a strange sense of loneliness amidst a
  throng of quickening memories.</p>

  <p>The woman, however, got the upper hand in Mrs. Jackson, and she suggested,
  tentatively&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Then maybe, Mr. Gordon, you are going to be married?"</p>

  <p>"You can omit the 'maybe,'" he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should never have thought it!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Time brings in his revenges," said he.</p>

  <p>"The way you three gentlemen used to rail at women! Well, there!"</p>

  <p>"But, then, they weren't women. They were Aunt Sallies of our own
  contriving&mdash;mere pasteboard. We were young and we didn't know."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jackson inquired the date and place of the ceremony. At Keswick, she
  was told, and in a week's time. She floated out garrulous on a tide of
  sentiment. She hoped that Mr. Gordon's two friends would follow his example
  and find out their mistake, not noticing the shadow which her words brought
  to her lodger's face. She dropped the name of Hawke and the shadow
  deepened.</p>

  <p>"I rather fancy," he said abruptly, "that Mr. Hawke found out the mistake
  at exactly the same time as I did myself."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jackson was a quick woman, and she took his meaning from the
  inflection of his voice.</p>

  <p>"He was your rival!"</p>

  <p>"I have not seen much of him lately."</p>

  <p>She thought for a moment and said, "Then it's just as well he's staying at
  the Inn."</p>

  <p>Gordon sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"At the Inn?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "He still comes to climb at Wastdale every Easter.
  But he has always stayed at the Inn, since you and Mr. Arkwright have stopped
  away."</p>

  <p>Gordon stood drumming with his fingers on the table-cloth. A sudden
  impulse of a sentimental kind had persuaded him to spend his last week of
  bachelorhood alone in the familiar privacy of this spot, and he had obeyed it
  on the instant, thoughtlessly it now appeared to him. He might have foreseen
  the likelihood of Hawke's presence. After all, however, it could not matter.
  It would be, perhaps, a little awkward if they met, though, indeed, it need
  not be even that. Their actual rivalry had ended with the announcement of his
  engagement two years ago. Hawke could gain no end by sustaining the feud.
  There was, in truth, no reason why they should not shake hands over the
  matter. So he argued to himself, desire pointing the argument and stifling
  certain uneasy reflections as to the tenacity of Hawke's nature.</p>

  <p>He sat down to resume his breakfast. The third member of the trio which
  for years had made the farmhouse the resort during Easter vacations claimed
  Mrs. Jackson's attention.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Arkwright?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," Gordon replied after a pause. "He died last year in
  Switzerland. It was an accident. I was with him at the time."</p>

  <p>He spoke with spasmodic jerks and ended with something like a sigh of
  relief. But if Mrs. Jackson loved marriages, she hankered after violent
  deaths, and so, while she expressed unbounded pity, she insisted upon
  details. Gordon submitted reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"It happened in the Oberland," he said, and Mrs. Jackson took a chair. "We
  were coming down a mountain towards the evening&mdash;Arkwright, myself, and
  a guide. We chanced to be late. The descent was new to us, and knowing that
  we should not get off the snow before dark we looked out for a spot to camp
  on. We came to a little plateau of rock just as the night was falling, and
  determined to remain there. The guide had a bottle of wine left out of our
  provisions. We had kept it back purposely."</p>

  <p>Gordon paused for a moment and then went on again with a certain
  deliberateness of speech as though the episode fascinated him in the telling
  of it.</p>

  <p>"Arkwright volunteered to draw the cork. The neck of the bottle burst and
  cut into his arm. It severed the main artery just above the wrist. I sent the
  guide down to the valley, but, of course, no help came until the morning. He
  was dead then."</p>

  <p>"And you stayed with him all the time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" said Gordon, and he rose from the table.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jackson, however, failed to take the hint. She wanted a description
  of his feelings during that night of watching, and she persisted until she
  had obtained it.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you can bear to speak about it at all!" she said almost
  reproachfully when he had finished.</p>

  <p>Left to himself, Gordon became the prey of a singular depression. The
  sensation of horror which the recital of the incident revived in him was
  intensified, not merely by its sombre contrast with the former liveliness of
  his thoughts, but by the actual surroundings amongst which he stood. The room
  itself was so suggestive of reminiscences that it seemed instinct with the
  presence of his dead friend. For the fact that he had but lately entered it
  after a lapse of years gave a fresh vividness to his memories. It was as if
  the dust had been suddenly swept from them by a rough hand.</p>

  <p>He walked over to the oak chest which stood against the wall by the
  fireplace. A book in a red cover lay upon it and he took it up. It was a
  novel which Arkwright had written at the farmhouse, and it contained an
  inscription to that effect from the author's hand.</p>

  <p>"I seem likely to pass a pleasant week," he said to himself, and taking
  his hat, stepped out into the clear sunshine.</p>

  <p>But his thoughts ran ever in the same channel. Each familiar object that
  he passed recalled his friend, and the remembrance of that night in the Alps
  hung like a black cloud about his heart. He tried to thrust it aside, but the
  more earnestly he tried, the more persistently it chained his attention,
  until in the end it seemed to shadow forth something sinister, something
  almost of menace. For some distance he followed the bed of the valley and
  then struck upwards to the right, on to the slopes of Scafell Pike. After a
  while he stopped to light his pipe, and, turning, saw over against him the
  track mounting in sharp zigzags towards the summit of the Styhead Pass. It
  was as clearly defined on the hill-side as a pencilled line on paper, and his
  eyes followed its direction mechanically until it bent over the edge of the
  Pass and disappeared from view. Then equally mechanically he began to picture
  in his mind its subsequent course. He had traced it past the tarn and half
  the way to Borrowdale, when of a sudden a smile dawned through the gloom on
  his face, "The path to Keswick!" he thought. He traced it consciously after
  that; he saw it broaden out into a road, and his imagination set a dainty
  figure in a white dress and a sailor hat at the end of it.</p><br>

  <p>Gordon had met Kate Nugent for the first time some three years before at
  Hawke's home in London, and from the outset of their acquaintance she had
  commenced to dominate his thoughts, not so much on account of her beauty as
  from a certain distinctness of personality which appealed to him at that time
  with a very peculiar force. For she came to him at a somewhat critical period
  in his life.</p>

  <p>Left an orphan while yet a child, David had spent his boyhood alone in the
  north of Scotland. His guardian&mdash;an uncle with a seat in Parliament and
  an estate near Ravenglass&mdash;he never saw; his tutor&mdash;an unpractical
  scholar of the old-fashioned type&mdash;he neglected, in order to follow the
  marsh- lamps of his own dreamy and somewhat morbid imagination. And so
  dividing his time between the study of the more exuberant poets and solitary
  rides along the bleak sea-coast, he mapped out the world for himself upon a
  purely fanciful plan. He first came into contact with actual life on his
  migration to Oxford. He was brought face to face with new facts and new
  experiences, which, strive as he might, he could not fit in with his
  theories. And, besides, he seemed to see all around him men actuated by the
  interests of truth toiling noisily at the overthrow of creeds and erecting
  nothing in their place. As a consequence, his false idealism crumbled beneath
  him, he lost his self-reliance, and felt hemmed in by a confused tangle of
  truth and falsehood which there was no clue to help him to unravel. The step
  between an intellectual scepticism and personal cynicism is an easy one for
  most men to take. Gordon strode over the intervening gaps unconsciously the
  moment he ceased to trust himself, since his own sensations had, of
  necessity, been the one standard by which he judged.</p>

  <p>His meeting with Kate Nugent, however, changed the whole tenor of his
  mind. She appeared to him the one real thing that he had found in his journey
  through a world of shadows. He pictured her standing out white and clear from
  a background of shifting haze, and his very self-distrust diminished since he
  referred his thoughts and actions to his conception of her as to a touchstone
  for the testing of them.</p>

  <p>After their engagement, she became almost his religion. He re-fashioned a
  second world in her image, faith coming to him like a child born from the
  joining of their hearts. His ambitions, so long dulled to inaction, sprang
  into new vigour and he followed their lead with a confident patience. There
  was, in fact, an element of quaint extravagance in his devotion, such as one
  finds mirrored in the love-poems of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>Hence it came about that as he walked home in the fall of the afternoon,
  matching the sunset with the colour of his thoughts, the sight of the white
  Inn walls, prominent in a dark clump of firs, recalled to him not only the
  fact of Hawke's proximity, but his desire to put an end to their
  estrangement. The desire grew as he dwelled upon it, until he began to feel
  an absolute repulsion from the prospect of starting along this new stage of
  his life at enmity with an old comrade.</p>

  <p>He determined to make the overture, and continuing his way onwards to the
  Inn, inquired for Mr. Hawke. He was out, they told him. He had waited until
  the postman came at twelve, and had then set out for the fells. Gordon
  rummaged in his pockets and unearthed a card. He scribbled on it a request
  that Hawke would visit him during the evening, and turned back to the
  farm-house in a glow of satisfaction. A wild fancy shot through him that
  Hawke and himself had been designedly brought together into the seclusion of
  the valley. He laughed it aside for the moment.</p>

  <p>But it returned to him afterwards with overwhelming conviction.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Austen Hawke strolled down from Yewbarrow an hour later. He
  was a man of a tall figure, spare of limb and lithe of movement, with a keen,
  narrow face, which fitted itself into one's memory. Inside his sitting-room
  it was already dark, and he rang for lights and stretched himself
  complacently in an arm-chair before the fire. The mistress of the Inn
  answered the bell and informed him, with intervals between the words as she
  scratched off the heads of refractory matches, that a gentleman had called to
  see him during the afternoon. Hawke swung round towards her, a look of
  annoyance showing in his face. He hastily ran over in his mind the names of
  his friends.</p>

  <p>"Did he leave no message?" he asked in perplexity.</p>

  <p>The card was produced, and Hawke took it, and stooping over the grate read
  Gordon's name and invitation by the light of the fire. The look of annoyance
  changed to one of utter incredulity. He read the card again, peering at it as
  if he expected each moment to see the letters dance from their order and
  group themselves afresh. By this time, however, the gas was lit, and as he
  rose erect, his eyes fell upon an envelope addressed to him in a clear, bold
  hand, which stood plain to view against the clock on the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gordon, of course, wrote his message in here?" he asked, and a note
  of anxiety struggled through the indifference of his tone.</p>

  <p>He was assured, however, that his visitor had come no further than the
  doorway of the hall.</p>

  <p>"You should have asked him in," he said carelessly, and slipped the
  envelope into his pocket.</p>

  <p>After dinner he smoked his pipe in his chair until the clock struck nine.
  Then he took out his watch, adjusted the hands exactly to the hour, and
  walked up the lane to the farm. The door stood on the latch and he flung it
  open noisily.</p>

  <p>The sound roused Gordon from a doze, and he started suddenly to his feet.
  On the instant Hawke stepped backwards to the threshold and stood in the
  doorway, eyeing him searchingly. For a moment the two men measured one
  another in silence, and Gordon fancied, with some wonderment, that there was
  an expression of more than mere antagonism, an expression of actual fear, in
  his visitor's attitude.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Hawke at last, and there was a ring of defiance in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Austen!" the other replied simply, and he held out his hand.</p>

  <p>There was no doubting the wistful sincerity of his appeal; and yet Hawke
  came forward but slowly, and took the outstretched hand with a watchful
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"You are a stranger here," he said.</p>

  <p>Gordon answered the implied question.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was only in the way at Keswick." He stopped abruptly, mindful
  that he trod delicate ground.</p>

  <p>Hawke shot a rapid glance at him. "Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Bridesmaids, you know. I was a flounder in a shoal of mermaids," and
  Gordon laughed apologetically.</p>

  <p>But Hawke joined in the laugh, and said&mdash;"Yes; the bridegroom is of
  no value until the wedding-day;" and he added softly, "and sometimes he is of
  no value after it."</p>

  <p>Gordon smiled confidently and observed&mdash;"At all events, you have not
  changed."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, we are not all&mdash;&mdash;" He cast about for an
  epithet less offensive than that ready to his tongue. "We are not all
  versatile."</p>

  <p>"The adjective hardly explains my case; for I don't seem to have existed
  at all before."</p>

  <p>"Don't," Hawke broke in. "Please don't. I will take your sentiment for
  granted."</p>

  <p>Gordon appreciated that he had brought the rejoinder upon himself by a
  misplaced egotism, and relapsed into his chair. Hawke came and stood
  immediately above him, leaning against the edge of the table.</p>

  <p>"And so," said he, "you came to Wastdale just to see me." He laid his hand
  on Gordon's arm with a show of cordiality, but he spoke slowly and with a
  faint flavour of irony about the words.</p>

  <p>"What made you think that?" Gordon asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Your message, of course."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstood it. I had no idea you were here until I arrived myself.
  I meant to spend the week at Ravenglass, but my uncle was summoned to town
  yesterday. So I thought that I would come over to the old place again."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Is that all?"</p>

  <p>Hawke's voice told of relief. Gordon noticed the change, and turned
  inquiring eyes on him sharply. Just for the second their glances crossed;
  Hawke was off his guard; and it appeared to his companion that the very
  spirit of malice was blazing triumphantly in his eyes. Hawke rose hastily
  from the table, and Gordon cried out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Take care! You will have the whisky on the floor."</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice it. Shall I help you?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks!"</p>

  <p>Hawke measured out the whisky into the glasses and filled them from the
  kettle which sang on the fire.</p>

  <p>"It's quite like old times," he said genially.</p>

  <p>"Not quite!"</p>

  <p>"You mean Arkwright? Yes, poor devil! I had forgotten him. Tell me how it
  happened." And he lay down on the sofa.</p>

  <p>"Why, didn't you hear!"</p>

  <p>"Only vaguely."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, shot a furtive look at Gordon, and added,
  tentatively&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I was in India at the time."</p>

  <p>"Were you in India, too?" Gordon exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Hawke turned his head to the wall to conceal the smile on his face, and
  answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was there. But why 'too'?"</p>

  <p>"Well, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Nugent happened to be at Poonah."</p>

  <p>"Really? But tell me about Arkwright."</p>

  <p>For the second time that day Gordon related the story of the accident.</p>

  <p>"Here's to better luck next time!" Hawke yawned when he had finished. "By
  the way, you are not drinking. That is one of the signs of impending
  matrimony, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" Gordon laughed. "Only you have made it so confoundedly
  strong."</p>

  <p>"It will help you to sleep."</p>

  <p>"I shan't need help."</p>

  <p>"Ah! You look tired, and I am keeping you up."</p>

  <p>Hawke drew his watch from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, it's past eleven!"</p>

  <p>He rose from the sofa and took his hat.</p>

  <p>"Are you going?" asked Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Good night!"</p>

  <p>Gordon went to the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't you bother to come out!" cried Hawke quickly.</p>

  <p>But Gordon lifted the latch and stepped out into the porch. Instantly
  Hawke slipped by him and hurried across the little garden to the gate. He
  looked eagerly up and down the lane, but there was nothing to be seen. The
  night was moonless and cloudy, with a cold wind blowing from the north.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" he repeated as Gordon joined him. "It's cold out here."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" Gordon inquired.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Hawke turned sharply to the speaker.</p>

  <p>"You looked as if you expected to see some one."</p>

  <p>"Here? At this time? Why, I suppose you and I are the only living beings
  awake for ten miles round," and he laughed, uneasily to Gordon's
  thinking.</p>

  <p>"I shall see you to-morrow, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," Hawke replied. "I mean to cross into Eskdale, if it is fine,
  and come back over Mickledoor. So I shall probably not reach home till
  late."</p>

  <p>And he started off down the lane.</p>

  <p>Gordon returned to the room, latched the door, and came thoughtfully back
  to the fire. "Why was Hawke afraid?" he asked himself. Of the fact of his
  alarm there could be no doubt. His sudden recoil when Gordon rose to greet
  him was evidence enough by itself. But, besides, there was the betrayal of
  relief when he ascertained the absence of design in Gordon's visit to the
  valley. And, beyond these particular proofs, throughout the interview
  suspicion had been visibly alert in the man, showing in his face, in his
  words, in his very posture. It must have been fear, Gordon argued, which had
  prompted him to pretend acceptance of the proffered reconciliation. For that
  he did but pretend was plain from the irrepressible irony in his voice, and,
  above all, from that flash of malice which just for a second had, as it were,
  lit up the face of his mind. But the reason of it all? Why was Hawke afraid
  of him?</p>

  <p>Gordon's thoughts circled blankly about the question. Finally he tried to
  forget it, lit his candle, and went upstairs to bed. Sleep, however, had now
  become impossible to him. He had flogged his wits out of their drowsiness,
  and he tossed from side to side in a fever of tired unrest until his
  speculations lost shape and form, and loomed vaguely into premonitions of
  evil. The very muscles of his limbs seemed braced like an athlete's, with the
  sense of a coming contest.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden, however, as he lay ransacking his memory for the least detail
  of the conversation, it occurred to him that he had left the lamp burning in
  the parlour. He felt for the matches at his bedside, and as he opened the box
  he heard a light sound as of a cautious step rise through the open window. He
  struck a match, it flared up into a flame and the sound was repeated more
  distinctly&mdash;a hurried shuffle of the pebbles.</p>

  <p>Gordon remained quite still in his bed, and the match burned down to his
  fingers. But there was no further movement. Then he rose and crept to the
  window. The night was like a bandage before his eyes. But after a while it
  thinned to a veil, and he made out the barn wall facing him (for his room lay
  at the side of the house), and as he watched something moved from the shadow
  of it, stood for a second in the open opposite the window, and then slipped
  round the corner of the barn and disappeared down the lane.</p>

  <p>It could be no one but Hawke, Gordon thought. The man's own remark flashed
  into his mind. "I suppose that you and I are the only living beings awake for
  ten miles round." For some reason he had been waiting until all was quiet in
  the house. Gordon flung on his clothes hurriedly, lit the candle, and went
  downstairs. But as he pushed open the door of the parlour a sudden gust of
  wind extinguished the light in his hand. The room was in darkness; only
  facing where he stood there was a panel of twilight, and through it he could
  see the boughs of trees rising and falling.</p>

  <p>The door into the lane stood open, and the lamp had been turned out.</p>

  <p>Gordon stood fixed there in a panic, listening. But no sound menaced him.
  Inside, the beat of the clock merely emphasized the silence; outside, the
  wind moaned among the hills with a dreary lift and drop, like surf upon a
  distant beach. He walked through the garden and strained his eyes up and down
  the road. No moving thing was visible, but he remembered that Hawke had
  scanned the surroundings too, and he hung on the gate, charged with
  expectancy.</p>

  <p>After a time he noticed a white speck in the black of the opposite field.
  He observed it casually at first, but it grew larger and approached him, and
  shaped itself into the figure of a woman. She climbed over a stile in the
  boundary wall facing the gate and brushed quickly by without noticing his
  presence. She was closely muffled in a large shawl, so that Gordon could see
  nothing of her face. But it struck him, from the momentary glimpse of her
  which he caught as she swung past him, that there was something familiar in
  her gait and bearing. The perception was a spark to the train of his fears.
  They flashed into one monstrous conjecture. Gordon thrust it down; it sprang
  up again and clutched at his throat, stifling him.</p>

  <p>Beyond that field, the track from Styhead&mdash;the track which he had
  watched that afternoon&mdash;ran towards the lake. If you came from the Pass
  to the upper part of Wastdale&mdash;say to the Inn&mdash;you crossed the
  field, you joined the lane at the very spot where Gordon stood. And over the
  Pass the woman had come&mdash;must have come. For Gordon's farm was the
  outpost of the village. The next house was built in Borrowdale.</p>

  <p>In the stillness he could hear the footsteps rattling on the loose stones.
  Then all at once they stopped, and Gordon felt his heart stop with them. The
  silence, however, pointed to the necessity of speed, and he followed the
  woman cautiously down the lane, creeping close under cover of the wall.</p>

  <p>But there was no one outside the Inn, and no sign of life within it. The
  front stared blindly into the night. He stole up to the door and laid his ear
  to the panel. A second after the bolt grated with an almost imperceptible jar
  as it was eased into its socket. He just heard a faint rustling sound as of
  feet stealthily receding along a flagged passage, and all was quiet
  again.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand to the bell, but a sudden thought checked his impulse.
  Suppose that his conjecture was false! And yet another thought came to second
  the first. Suppose that his conjecture was true! His arm dropped nervously to
  his side. For the girl's sake he dared not rouse the inmates.</p>

  <p>And yet what action should he take? He stood paralysed, feeling the
  question beat into his brain like a hammer, until a yellow beam of light
  leaped out on to the trees at the west corner of the house. Gordon hurried
  round to the spot and perceived that it came from a window on the first floor
  in the end of the building. He looked eagerly about for a means of reaching
  it. Immediately under the window the space was clear, but a little farther
  towards the back of the Inn an outhouse with a thatched sloping roof jutted
  forth at a right angle. From the extreme point of that roof Gordon believed
  that he could command a view of the room. In this way he would at all events
  ascertain the truth.</p>

  <p>A short examination showed him a tree which leaned against the far side of
  the building. Scaling the trunk, he crept out along a bough, dropped lightly
  on the thatch, and crept up to its apex. Over the edge he looked into the
  room, as from the opposite point at the base of a triangle. Three-fourths of
  its area were within his view, and this was what he saw.</p>

  <p>Hawke sat almost facing him in front of a table with his back towards a
  blazing fire. A number of letters lay before him, and he was evidently
  reading them aloud, for now and again he looked up with narrowed eyes and a
  crafty smile, much as Gordon remembered him when he held a winning hand at
  whist.</p>

  <p>The sex of his visitor was revealed by a shawl trailing on the hearthrug.
  But of her person, Gordon caught not so much as a glimpse. For she stood on
  the near side of the room, concealed from him.</p>

  <p>Hawke, as he finished each letter, placed it methodically on a file which
  lay by his side. One, however, seemed longer than the rest and afforded him
  peculiar interest. He turned back to the first page and read it a second
  time, pointing here and there to passages with his finger. All at once the
  slender figure of a girl moved into the light. She passed round the table and
  stood behind Hawke's shoulder, her face gleaming pale as ivory from a cloud
  of tumbled hair. Gordon recognized her on the instant. It was Kate Nugent.
  She bent over Hawke as if to follow him more closely, and with a sudden
  clutch tore the paper from his hand and flung it into the fire. Hawke started
  to his feet, transfigured. Some such flame as was shrivelling the letter
  seemed to leap across his face. He pinned Kate's wrist to the table and
  thrust his head close down upon hers. What he said Gordon could not
  distinguish for the closed window, but he noticed a savage incisiveness about
  the movement of his lips, and saw the veins swell upon his forehead and along
  his throat.</p>

  <p>For a moment the girl confronted him, returning glance for glance, but
  only for a moment. The defiance flickered out of her face, her lips shaped to
  an entreaty, and, with a meek gentleness which was infinitely pitiful, she
  unclasped the fingers about her wrist. She moved towards the window,
  stumbling as she went. She felt blindly for the catch, unfastened it as
  though her hands were numbed, and slowly lifted the sash.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">She leaned against the sill, gazing into the darkness. After
  a while she turned. Hawke was watching her with a complacent smile.</p>

  <p>"And it pleases you to torture me! You enjoy seeing a woman suffer. I
  couldn't have believed that any man could be such a coward and so mean!"</p>

  <p>Hawke laughed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Give them to me!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Think!" he answered in a mock appeal. "They will be my only consolation
  after you are married."</p>

  <p>"Give them to me!" she cried again.</p>

  <p>Hawke was standing by the fireplace and she moved towards him, changing
  her tone to one of wondering reproach.</p>

  <p>"You can't mean to keep them! You are just laughing at me&mdash;for the
  minute. Yes! yes! I know. That was your way. But you will give me the letters
  in the end, won't you? Look! I will kneel to you for them. Only give them to
  me!" And she sank on her knees at his feet before the fire.</p>

  <p>"They will be much safer with me," he replied. "You might leave them
  about. David might pry. And it would strain even his innocence to
  misunderstand them."</p>

  <p>"Can you think I should keep them?" she said with a shiver of disgust.
  "Give them to me or burn them yourself! Yes!" she continued, feverishly,
  clutching his arm, "burn them yourself&mdash;now&mdash;here&mdash;and I will
  thank you all my life."</p>

  <p>She stirred the coals into a blaze.</p>

  <p>"See! They will burn so quickly," and she darted out her hands towards the
  file.</p>

  <p>Hawke snatched it away. "No, no!" he laughed. "You must vary your game if
  you mean to win."</p>

  <p>He reached up and hung it on the mirror over his mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"There!" said he. "You will have to jump for them."</p>

  <p>The girl stared at him incredulously; the words seeming to her some trick
  of her strained senses. But she glanced upwards to the file and sank back
  with a low moan.</p>

  <p>"Will nothing touch you?" she said.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was a pause. Only the noise of the brook laughing
  happily as it raced over the stones behind the house broke the silence in the
  room. Kate heard it vaguely, and it awoke a reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember?" she said. "At Poonah? There was a stream running past
  the verandah there."</p>

  <p>She was speaking wearily, with closed eyes, and the firelight played upon
  a face as white and impassive as a wax mask.</p>

  <p>"Yes! I remember," answered Hawke, his voice softening with the memory of
  those few months in India, The recollection was not of what they had thought
  or said or done&mdash;that would not have moved him; but simply of how he had
  felt towards her. He stood and watched her curiously. The dark lashes began
  to glisten, and then all in a moment her apathy broke up, and she was shaking
  in an agony of tears.</p>

  <p>"I was never so hard to you," she faltered between her sobs.</p>

  <p>The words floated out freely to Gordon and set his senses reeling. In
  Hawke they deepened the phantom tenderness already aroused. There was
  something so childlike in their simplicity. Indeed, as she crouched upon the
  floor in her abandonment, her white frock stained by her long journey, her
  sash all crumpled, her loosened hair curling vagrantly about her neck, and
  her slender figure quivering down to the tips of her shoes, she looked little
  more than a child masquerading in the emotions of a woman.</p>

  <p>He took down the file and swung it irresolutely to and fro upon his
  finger. Kate turned to him impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Give them to me! You promised you would if I came to fetch them. You
  can't break that promise now! Think what you have made me risk! Suppose they
  find out at home? It would have been cruel enough if that had been the only
  danger. But to bring me to the village where you and Dav&mdash;where you and
  he are the only strangers!"</p>

  <p>"That was not my fault," Hawke interposed. "How could I tell he was going
  to blunder over here? I only met him this afternoon. However, you needn't be
  afraid. The fool's asleep."</p>

  <p>Gordon felt an almost overpowering impulse to laugh aloud. The irony of
  the situation was the one thing which his mind could grasp. However, he set
  his teeth fast to restrain the desire. He would learn all that was to be
  known first. He could disclose himself to Hawke afterwards.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure he suspects nothing?" Kate asked.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. I was with him this evening, I tell you. He left his lamp
  burning, so that I had to wait until the place was quiet to put it out, for
  fear you should mistake the house. There is nothing to fear. Why, he told me
  that he hadn't even existed until he met you."</p>

  <p>"Don't!" Kate exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You need not reproach yourself for his credulity. They say it's quite
  good for a man to believe in a woman."</p>

  <p>Kate remained silent, knowing that replies were but fuel to his sneers.
  But her eyes caught the clock and awoke her to the lapse of time.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she cried. "It is past one. I must go back, and it is so far. Give
  me the letters, I am tired."</p>

  <p>Hawke determined to comply. So much the sight of her fresh, young beauty,
  drooping at his feet, had wrung from him. But he was an epicure where women
  were concerned. He took a natural delight in evoking their emotions, and when
  the display gratified him, he allowed no obtrusive knowledge of its cost to
  them to abridge his enjoyment. So he merely repeated&mdash;</p>

  <p>"They will be safe with me."</p>

  <p>"I cannot trust you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>The question rang cold and sharp, like the crack of a pistol. Kate looked
  at his face and realised that she had lost her ground. But, as she had said,
  she was tired. She was too over-wrought to choose her phrases.</p>

  <p>"I dare not marry him and leave those letters in your hands."</p>

  <p>"Why not? You have trusted me with more than your letters."</p>

  <p>The brutality of the remark was emphasised by the harshness of his tone.
  But she replied, quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And you taunt me with my trust! Surely that is reason enough."</p>

  <p>"You are afraid that I shall use them!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I only know that if you keep them, I may be his wife, but
  you will be my master; and I dare not face that."</p>

  <p>The explanation appeased Hawke. It warmed his vanity and disposed him to
  reward so clear an appreciation of his power. Only the reward she asked was
  nothing less than the renunciation of that power. He paused over that.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Kate continued, "why did you force me to come here?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he replied, musingly. "Perhaps I wanted to see you
  again."</p>

  <p>"No! That was not why. You would have come to me yourself, if that had
  been the cause."</p>

  <p>"What was the reason, then?" Hawke smiled indulgently. This scrutiny of
  his intentions added to his satisfaction. It lifted him in his self-esteem,
  attributed to him an unusual personality. For, as a rule, people find the
  twenty-four hours barely long enough to discover what their neighbours do,
  and so are compelled to leave their thoughts and aims alone. Hawke loomed
  larger on his own horizon, the more particularly because the analyst was a
  young woman and well-favoured.</p>

  <p>"What was the reason?"</p>

  <p>"Just my marriage. You felt that I was slipping out of your
  grasp&mdash;escaping you. I know you so well."</p>

  <p>"But it's almost a year since I have seen you. I have left you alone
  during all that time. So, even if I had possessed any power, you can't urge
  that I have used it."</p>

  <p>"No! But because you possessed it," Kate insisted. "Because you were
  certain you possessed it; and so you were content to let things lie. Now,
  however, everything was changing. I was escaping you; and you made me come
  here at night, across that horrible lonely pass, just to assert your mastery
  over me&mdash;just to convince yourself it was real. Don't you see? I dare
  not go back and leave those letters with you."</p>

  <p>Hawke wavered. If he gave her what she wished, she would escape him, as
  she had said. She would pass clean beyond his reach. She would have no fear
  of him&mdash;no strong feeling of any kind.</p>

  <p>"Suppose that I give you your way," he said, hesitatingly; "what is going
  to happen between you and me?"</p>

  <p>The unexpected question scared the girl, and she answered, catching her
  breath&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Everything was over between us&mdash;ages ago, it seems to me. You have
  not seen me for a year. You said so yourself."</p>

  <p>"Yes! I know," he replied, slowly, and Kate felt that he was watching her
  keenly. "But now that I do see you again, it is like meeting you for the
  first time without the trouble of having to make friends."</p>

  <p>Kate half rose to her feet, with a slight cry.</p>

  <p>"Don't get up!" Hawke exclaimed, and he smoothed her hair caressingly with
  his hand. "You look so pretty like that."</p>

  <p>She clenched her nails in her palms. Her whole nature rose against the
  man. The mere touch of his fingers turned her sick. At last, however, she
  forced herself to meet his gaze. She saw that he was going to speak, and
  began first, coaxing him, while a deadly humiliation set her cheeks
  ablaze.</p>

  <p>"Friends? Yes! We might be friends. Only give me the letters, and I will
  think of you as a friend!"</p>

  <p>"For just so long as it takes you to reach Keswick."</p>

  <p>"No; always," she said simply. "You don't know what a woman can forgive
  when once she has felt as I have felt towards you."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Hawke suddenly stripped the letters off the file.</p>

  <p>"I will give them to you," he said.</p>

  <p>Kate held out her hands to him eagerly, with a low cry of joy. But Hawke
  dropped the packet on the table, and seized her outstretched wrists.</p>

  <p>"But they have their price," he whispered, bending over her.</p>

  <p>Kate shrank away in a whirl of terror. But his grasp only tightened, and
  he drew her towards him, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Only a kiss," he said. "One kiss for each."</p>

  <p>"No!" She almost shouted the word.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" he laughed. "You will rouse the house. One kiss for each," and he
  laughed again almost hysterically.</p>

  <p>"It is not a heavy price&mdash;it is not even a new price. You have paid
  it before with nothing to buy. Think of the distance you have come, of the
  horrible lonely pass!"</p>

  <p>He repeated her words with a burlesque shudder. But the taunts fell upon
  deaf ears. Kate was engrossed in the shame of his proposal. It was so
  characteristic of him, she thought. He had chosen the one device which would
  humiliate her most effectually. Its very puerility added to her sense of
  degradation. There was a touch of the ludicrous in the notion so grotesquely
  incongruous with the pain it caused her. She pictured the scene with a
  spectator. "How he would laugh!" she thought, bitterly. However, there would
  be no spectator&mdash;and it was the only way.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Hawke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she replied.</p>

  <p>He released her wrists, and she stood up and faced him. He took the
  letters and handed them to her, one by one; and for each letter that he gave
  her, she kissed him on the lips.</p>

  <p>And outside the window was the spectator. Only he did not laugh.</p>

  <p>Hawke also had grown serious. The sight of Kate Nugent after so long an
  interval, the familiar sound of her voice, and to some degree also a certain
  distorted pleasure which he drew from the knowledge of Gordon's proximity,
  had served to prepare his passions. Now they were tinder to the touch of her
  lips. So, as he let the last letter go and she turned her face upwards to
  complete the bargain, he suddenly placed his hands behind her shoulders, drew
  her towards him, and returned her kiss with a fervour.</p>

  <p>The change in him came almost as a relief to Kate. It diminished her sense
  of humiliation. For the moment he began to show passion, the less she felt
  herself his toy. So, for a second, she did not resist his embrace. Then she
  struggled to free herself.</p>

  <p>"I have paid you," she said.</p>

  <p>Hawke dropped his arms, and she moved towards the fireplace. One by one,
  she noted the dates of the letters, tore them across and let them fall into
  the flames. Then she stood thinking.</p>

  <p>"You have not given me all."</p>

  <p>"All I showed you."</p>

  <p>"There are four more, written on my way home from Calcutta, Aden,
  Brindisi, and London."</p>

  <p>"Three! You were rude enough to burn one."</p>

  <p>"Where are they?"</p>

  <p>"Here!" Hawke tapped his breast pocket as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Fulfil your bargain! Give them to me!"</p>

  <p>"They will cost more."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The strain upon Gordon's nerves had become intolerable. When
  he first mounted the outhouse roof he had been wholly absorbed in the horror
  of his conjecture that Hawke's midnight visitor was the girl to whom he was
  betrothed, and the need of either verifying or disproving it was the one
  thing clear to him amid the turmoil of his brain. Of what the visit might
  actually imply he took no thought. Now, however, he knew; the interview which
  he had witnessed left him not a glimmer of doubt. But during the two years of
  their engagement, Kate Nugent had so grown into the heart of his life, had
  become so real a part of him, that she was not easily dethroned from his
  respect. He clung instinctively to a vague hope that there might have been
  some compelling cause of which he knew nothing to account for her subjection
  to Hawke. That this subjection meant treachery to him, treachery of an
  unpardonable kind, whatever its cause, he realised in a way, but as yet did
  he not feel it. The blow had stunned his reason, had even dulled his senses,
  had, in a word, struck at the very roots of his being. He was adrift in a
  maze of bewilderment. The scene he was witnessing grew in the end shadowy and
  unreal. Even Hawke seemed to lose his individuality; he became just a detail
  in the sum of the mystery, a thing to be explained, not a man to be punished.
  Gordon, in fact, was left conscious of but one feeling&mdash;the overwhelming
  desire to see the woman he had worshipped face to face with him, to speak
  with her, and realising the necessity of getting solid ground beneath his
  feet, if he was to accomplish his wish, he clambered from his
  perch&mdash;just too soon to see Kate strike Hawke across the mouth, as her
  answer to the last words he had only dimly heard.</p>

  <p>Gordon reached the earth securely and crept softly back to his garden
  gate. The sky had cleared during the last half hour, and the valley lay pure
  and clean in the starlight. After a while a sound reached him. It struck upon
  muffled senses at first, meaninglessly; but its continued repetition fixed
  his attention, and he perceived that it was the sound of Kate's footsteps on
  the stones again at the bottom of the lane. She was returning. Gordon was
  still in that dazed condition when the brain, unable to take a complete
  impression, or, to speak more plainly, unable to combine its different
  impressions into one whole, fixes itself upon some small particular sensation
  and magnifies that, to the thorough exclusion of the rest. So, now as he
  listened to her steps drawing nearer and nearer, he noticed acutely a
  difference in the manner of her walk, a certain hesitancy, absent when she
  swept by him on her way to the Inn. Then her footfalls had rung surely and
  rhythmically, betokening some quest in view; now they wavered, timidly, with
  uncertain beats as if the hope had gone out of her limbs. The sound was
  somehow familiar to Gordon, and, curiously ransacking his memories, he
  discovered the reason. He had marked women walk like that, with the same
  weariness, with the same hopelessness, late at night in the quiet of the
  London streets. This chance association of ideas acted on him like a shock.
  It woke him from his stupor, revivified him, set him with clear vision
  fronting facts. He grasped the full meaning of Kate's interview with Hawke.
  It rose before him like an acted scene in a play, and he recollected with a
  sudden horror those last words, "They will cost more." How long was it since
  he had climbed down from the outhouse roof? How long had he been waiting by
  the gate? He had been unconscious of time. Hours might have lapsed for all he
  knew. Meanwhile the steps drew nearer. He saw her plainly advancing towards
  him. She was walking with her eyes on the ground, and so did not observe him
  barring her path until she almost knocked against him. She lifted her head,
  stood for a second looking searchingly into his face, as if he were a ghost,
  the fancied embodiment of her fears, and then, with an inarticulate moan like
  the cry of the dumb, she reeled against the wall of the lane. Gordon heard
  her breath coming and going in quick jets and the scrabbling of her
  finger-nails as she clutched at the stones.</p>

  <p>"Is it you?" she said, attempting a light surprise. "How you startled me!
  I am late, very late. I was delayed. I came over
  to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To recover your letters," Gordon broke in bitterly upon her labouring
  effort to dig up an excuse. "You were right to come late. That kind of errand
  can't be run by daylight."</p>

  <p>Kate drew herself up and moved toward him, but he thrust his hands out
  with a gesture of repulsion to check her approach.</p>

  <p>"Those last three letters?"</p>

  <p>"He has them still."</p>

  <p>"Come in!" Gordon said. The relief he experienced gave a gentleness to the
  tone of his voice. That loathsome dread at all events was dispelled. For even
  then he did not doubt the truth of her words.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" and he turned and went into the parlour. The girl followed him
  in silence, drew a chair close to the dying fire and hung over it, shivering.
  Gordon lit the lamp, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is cold. These April nights always are up here."</p>

  <p>Kate looked at the clock, and Gordon's eyes followed her gaze. The hands
  pointed to half-past one. He had heard her implore Hawke that it was past the
  hour, some time before he quitted his post of observation. So there could
  have been but the briefest interval between her departure and his own.</p>

  <p>"Be quick! What do you want with me? I have no time to lose!"</p>

  <p>Kate flung the words at him petulantly. The knowledge that she had been
  discovered exasperated her against Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't you speak?"</p>

  <p>She turned towards him. Gordon was still standing at the table by the
  lamp. For, now that his object was attained and she was alone with him, he
  found no words to express the questions he had meant to ask. The light fell
  full upon the delicate beauty of her face, and indeed nearly drove the
  questions themselves from his mind. "You always look to me as if you had just
  come out of a convent," he had once said to her; and that sentence most
  exactly indicated the nature of the passion he had felt for her&mdash;an
  intense love refined and exalted by a blind, unreasoning reverence. There
  was, in truth, a certain air of spirituality about her manifest to most
  people on their first introduction. But it belonged to the face, not to the
  expression. It was due to the fragile purity of her features, not to the mind
  which animated them, and was consequently more noticeable when she was in
  repose. The impression, as a rule, wore off upon a closer acquaintance, but
  Gordon had fallen in love and saw her always through the mist of his
  feelings.</p>

  <p>So the memory of all that she had meant to him kept him silent now. His
  thoughts seemed almost a sacrilege&mdash;plainly impossible to speak unless
  Kate gave him a decided lead. He waited and watched her. The skin of her
  wrist had broken when Hawke gripped it, and every now and then a drop of
  blood would fall on to her white dress and trickle down in a red wavering
  line. The sight somehow fascinated Gordon, and as each drop fell he waited
  and watched for the next.</p>

  <p>To Kate, his silence became intolerable. She would have preferred
  reproaches, abuse, even violence&mdash;anything, in a word&mdash;to this
  leaden reticence. For it accused her more sharply than any words. Her lover
  had always been as an easy book to her keen intelligence, and she could read
  clearly enough that what kept his lips locked now was the conflict between
  his new knowledge and his old loyalty. In a flash she imagined Hawke's
  behaviour under the like circumstances and contrasted it with Gordon's
  bearing. Side by side the two men toed the line for her mental inspection,
  and the result was a feminine outcry against Fate, the Powers above and
  below&mdash;what you will, in a word, except her concrete self.</p>

  <p>"What brought you over here?" she cried. "You said you were going to
  Ravenglass. You told me so. What brought you over to Wastdale?"</p>

  <p>She spoke fiercely, almost vindictively, and it seemed as if the pair had
  suddenly changed places, as if she were the accuser and he the culprit,
  standing meekly self-condemned. Indeed, to complete the illusion, there was
  even a tinge of remorse in his tone as he answered her.</p>

  <p>"God, perhaps. Who knows?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes, yes, yes!" she went on. "Preach to me! Preach to me! Go on! Only
  be quick about it and make the sermon short!"</p>

  <p>"Don't, Kitty!" he said, and added, wistfully, "It can't be your true self
  that is speaking."</p>

  <p>"Yea, it is," she replied, struggling with a sense of pity for him (evoked
  by the quiet sadness of his voice). "My very own self, my real true self,
  that you have never known&mdash;that you never <i>would</i> know. You always
  had wrong ideas about me. I tried to open your eyes at first, but it was no
  good, and I gave it up. You always dressed me up in virtues that didn't fit
  me. I used to feel as if I were wearing a strait-waistcoat."</p>

  <p>Gordon drew up a chair and sat opposite to her on the other side of the
  fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Then it was all my fault," he said.</p>

  <p>Kate glanced at him quickly, but there was no trace of irony in his
  manner. He was speaking quite seriously. As a matter of fact, it had just
  begun to dawn on him that a frank expectation of ideal behaviour is the most
  exacting form of tyranny a man can exercise over a woman.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "No! It was my fault. I ought never to have become
  engaged to you; for I never loved you, even at the beginning. Oh, it is no
  use shirking the truth now," she went on, as Gordon rose with a cry of pain.
  "I never loved you. I realised that very soon after we were engaged. I had
  always liked you. I liked you better than any man I had met, and so in time I
  thought I might come to love you as well. I don't know whether I ever should
  have reached that if I had been left alone. But you made it impossible. You
  would not see that I had faults and caprices. You would not see that those
  very faults pleased me, that I meant to keep them, that I did not want to
  change. No! Whenever you came to me, I always felt as if I was being lifted
  up reverently and set on a very high and a very small pedestal. And there I
  had to stand, with my heels together, and my toes turned out, in an attitude
  of decorum until you had gone. Well, you want people with flat heels to enjoy
  that. I always wore high ones, and the attitude tired me."</p>

  <p>Instinctively she stretched one foot out as she spoke. The sparkle of the
  firelight on the buckle caught Gordon's eye, and he saw that she was wearing
  thin kid slippers with a strap across the instep.</p>

  <p>"You must be wet through," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "I rode to the head of the Pass, and left the horse
  tied up to the footbridge over the stream. It was dry enough the rest of the
  way."</p>

  <p>"You rode over here!" he exclaimed. "Then they must have known you were
  coming?"</p>

  <p>"Who must have known?" she asked, in a sudden alarm.</p>

  <p>"Your father and your aunt. She is staying with you still, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But they knew nothing, of course. My father had some people to
  dinner to-night. I left them early, saying that I was tired. I should have
  had no time to change if I had thought of it, as it was close on ten. I had
  told Martin, our groom, that I should want a horse&mdash;you know he would do
  anything for me&mdash;and he had it ready saddled. So I locked my room door,
  took the key with me, and came away just as I was."</p>

  <p>She stopped abruptly. The mention of her home aroused her to the
  consequences of her detection. Up till now the fact that Gordon had found her
  out had alone possessed her mind. Now, however, she was compelled to look
  forward. What would he do? He was to have married her in a week, in just
  seven days. Would he disclose the truth? She scanned his face for an answer
  to her conjectures.</p>

  <p>Gordon was leaning against the mantelshelf above her, and his eyes met her
  inquiring gaze.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So you see," she faltered, "I am pretty safe for to-night; but
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" He seemed not to have grasped her drift.</p>

  <p>"Yes! To-morrow," she repeated. "What do you mean to do?"</p>

  <p>The question startled Gordon. He had been thinking of her, not of himself.
  Yes, to-morrow he would have to act. But how?</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered. "I must have time to think. I have not
  mastered today yet."</p>

  <p>"You will spare me as much as you can?"</p>

  <p>There was something very pitiful in the childlike entreaty; at least so it
  seemed to Gordon. She was so young for all this misery. Her very humility
  pained him, all the more because it was so strange to him.</p>

  <p>"I will spare you altogether, child," he replied. "You need not be afraid
  of me. I have loved you too well to hurt you now."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he paced about the room restlessly, trying to discover
  some means by which he could break the marriage off and take the blame upon
  himself. But no likely plan occurred to him. His brain refused to act.
  Disconnected scraps of ideas and ludicrous reminiscences, all foreign to the
  matter, forced themselves upon his mind, the harder he strove to think. He
  gave the effort up. He would be able to concentrate his attention better when
  he was alone. Besides, he recollected he had not heard the whole story as
  yet. Some clue to an issue might perhaps be found in the untold
  remainder.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the rest!" he said, returning to his chair.</p>

  <p>"The rest?" she inquired. Gordon's generosity had pierced straight to her
  heart at last, and had sent the tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Yes! The rest of the story down to tonight."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I can't," she cried. "Not now! I can't! If you had been rough and
  harsh, yes! But you have been so gentle with me.</p>

  <p>"It will be the kindest way for me," Gordon replied. "I must know the
  truth some way or another, and I would rather have you tell it me than ferret
  it out for myself."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she said, wearily; and for a space there was silence in
  the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"My mother died," she began, "eight months after our
  engagement, and then I went out to Poonah on a visit to my uncle. It is just
  a year and a half since I started."</p>

  <p>"Yea! I remember. I did not want you to go."</p>

  <p>"And I insisted. You know why now."</p>

  <p>"Yes! I know why now."</p>

  <p>Gordon repeated her words with a shiver. If only he had understood her a
  little better, he thought.</p>

  <p>Kate hardly noticed his interruption. She was staring straight into the
  fire and speaking in a dull monotone, with no spring in her voice. She would
  have spared him now, had she been able, but she felt irresistibly impelled to
  lay all her disloyalty bare before his eyes&mdash;to show him at how empty a
  shrine he had been worshipping. It seemed to her almost as if some stronger
  will was prompting her, and the very sound of her words was thin and strange
  to her ears, as though some one else was speaking them at a great
  distance.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she continued, "I wanted to get away from you&mdash;to slip out of
  my shackles for a time. So I went to Poonah, and&mdash;and there I found
  Austen."</p>

  <p>"Austen! Austen!" Gordon burst out in a frenzy. "For God's sake, don't
  call him that!" and he brought his clenched fist down on the table with all
  his strength. The glasses on it rattled at the blow, and the tumbler which
  Hawke had used, standing close at the edge, fell and splintered on the floor.
  Gordon laughed at the sight.</p>

  <p>"That was his glass," he explained. "He was here to-night, drinking with
  me," and he laughed again, harshly.</p>

  <p>The girl hurriedly drew her skirts away from the broken fragments.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Gordon said, recovering his composure, "I interrupted you.
  Go on!"</p>

  <p>But there was a new hardness in his tone. Kate remarked it, and it grated
  on her painfully after his forbearance. She paused for a moment, looking at
  him anxiously. But he made no further sign, and she took up the burden of her
  tale again.</p>

  <p>"There I found Mr. Hawke. I don't think I had ever given a thought to him
  before. But from this time he began to influence me, because of the
  difference between yourself and him. He paid me no respect, no deference, and
  outwardly, indeed, no attention; but all the time I felt that he was
  consciously and deliberately taking possession of me, and I made no struggle
  to resist him. He became my master&mdash;imposed himself upon me until I lost
  the sense of responsibility for my own actions. It was not that he gave me
  orders or even suggested them, but somehow I always realised what he wanted
  me to do, and did it. And I knew besides that he was conscious of my
  submission and counted on it."</p>

  <p>Kate had relapsed into the impersonal commonplace manner which had
  characterised her speech before Gordon broke in. The words fell from her lips
  in a level regularity, without rise or fall, and she was abstractedly
  smoothing out one of the broad ribbons of her sash&mdash;an old trick of
  hers, very familiar to her listener. For all the emotion that she showed she
  might have been dissecting the character of an uninteresting
  acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"So that is the way for men to win women!"</p>

  <p>"Some women, yes!"</p>

  <p>"Well, there is nothing like buying one's experience, they say."</p>

  <p>The attempt at sarcasm only served to reveal the intensity of Gordon's
  suffering. He was sitting with his body bent forward and his chin pressed
  against his chest; his hands were clenched between his knees, and his whole
  attitude told of the strain his self-repression caused him.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I have told you enough," she exclaimed, tossed out of her apathy by a
  sudden comprehension of the torture her story inflicted.</p>

  <p>"No! no!" Gordon replied, hoarsely. "Go on! Go on and finish it!"</p>

  <p>"Well," she continued, her voice sinking into a tremulous whisper, "one
  evening I was left in the house alone. The rest had gone out to a dance, but
  I was worn out by the heat, and remained at home. It was very hot; there was
  hardly a breath of air, I remember, and I curled myself up in a long chair on
  the verandah and fell fast asleep. I was awakened by some one pulling my
  hair, and when I looked up I saw who it was."</p>

  <p>"How long was that before you left India?"</p>

  <p>"Two months."</p>

  <p>"And during those two months you kept writing home to me and saying how
  slowly the time passed."</p>

  <p>Gordon spoke with an accent of incredulous wonder. Each moment thrust a
  new inconceivable fact before his eyes, and forced him to contemplate it. He
  felt that his world was toppling in ruins about him, much as it had done in
  that first year of his University life.</p>

  <p>"That was not my fault," the girl exclaimed. "He made me do it. I wanted
  to write to you and break the engagement off; but he would not let me. I
  suppose he was afraid I should bother him to marry me himself," she
  concluded, contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"And you obeyed him in that, too?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I was at his mercy. He did what he liked with me. He made me
  write those letters to you;" and she added, with a certain softness, "and in
  a way, too, I was glad he did."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because even then I was afraid of him. I distrusted him, and you seemed a
  kind of anchor for me, and every letter an extra link in the cable."</p>

  <p>The words touched Gordon strangely. The surface implication that he was
  valued merely as a convenient refuge from the consequences of folly did not
  occur to him. He applied a deeper meaning to them, and fancied that she had
  been willing to retain her hold on him for much the same reason which had
  made him cling to her&mdash;out of an instinctive need to feel something
  stable in a world of shadow. She had taken an open knife from the table and
  was mechanically tracing with its point the crimson lines upon her dress, and
  he thought her tired helplessness was the saddest sight man could ever see.
  Sentences out of the letters came back to him.</p>

  <p>"So, in a way," he said, almost with a smile, "you meant what you
  wrote."</p>

  <p>"Yes! What I wrote. But I wrote so little of them myself. I mean," she
  went on, noticing the surprise in the other's face, "I put the words down. He
  dictated them."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>A sudden fury seized upon Gordon. For the first time since he had been
  talking with Kate, he realised Hawke the man, a living treacherous being,
  flesh and blood, that could be crushed and killed. The idea sent a thrill
  through his veins. The lust for revenge sprang up, winged and armed, in a
  flame of hatred. His imagination pictured the scene, clear cut as a cameo; he
  saw the keen, pointed face bending over Kate's shoulder; he heard him
  unctuously rolling out loving phrases, savouring them as he spoke, and
  chuckling over the deceit.</p>

  <p>He turned on Kate in a frenzy.</p>

  <p>"He dictated them; and he laughed as he did it, I suppose. Did he laugh?
  Tell me! Did he laugh?"</p>

  <p>Gordon shook the girl's arm savagely, his face livid and working with
  passion. His aspect terrified her. She dared not tell him the truth, and she
  turned away with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"That is answer enough," and he dropped her arm and began again pacing
  about the room. Now, however, he walked quietly and softly, with his
  shoulders rounded and his head thrust forward. His lips were drawn back from
  his teeth, and there was something catlike in his tread, which reminded Kate
  irresistibly of Hawke. Indeed, to her fevered eyes, he began to change and to
  grow like his enemy in face and bearing.</p>

  <p>"Don't," she whispered. "You frighten me. You remind me of him."</p>

  <p>The words recalled Gordon to himself. There was something else he wished
  to know. What was it? He beat his forehead with the palms of his hands in the
  effort to recollect. If only he could banish Hawke from his mind until she
  had gone! At last the question took shape.</p>

  <p>"The letters he was reading to you?"</p>

  <p>"They were notes and appointments written when we were both at Poonah,"
  she answered, submissively. "I never thought that he would keep them, though
  I might have known he would."</p>

  <p>"And the three he has still?"</p>

  <p>"They were the only real letters I ever wrote to him. There were four, but
  I burned one to-night."</p>

  <p>"Yes! I saw."</p>

  <p>"I wrote them on the way home, from Calcutta, Aden, Brindisi and the last
  from London the evening I arrived."</p>

  <p>"You have never written since?"</p>

  <p>"Never! Nor have I seen him since until he compelled me to come
  to-night."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly, as if some new idea had crossed her mind. In a
  moment, however, she began again, but she was speaking to herself.</p>

  <p>"No. I had to come. There was no other way. I dared not leave those
  letters in his hands. Oh! how I hate him!"</p>

  <p>She uttered the words with a slow intensity which enforced conviction,
  looking straight at Gordon; and he saw a flame commence to glow in the depths
  of her eyes and spread until her whole face was ablaze with it.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?" he queried, almost eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Can you doubt it?" she replied, starting to her feet. "Oh, yes, you
  would! I forgot. Oh, David, if only you had understood me better!"</p>

  <p>It was what he had been saying to himself, with a deep self- reproach, and
  her repetition of his thought, coupled with a weary gesture of despair,
  exaggerated the feeling on him by the addition of a very lively pity.</p>

  <p>"So that is true, then?" he asked, hesitatingly. "You no longer care for
  him?"</p>

  <p>The mere weakness of the question betokened a mind in doubt, as to its
  choice of action, betrayed a certain tentative indecision.</p>

  <p>"I never really cared for him," she answered.</p>

  <p>A look of actual gladness showed in the man's face. They were standing
  opposite to one another, and the girl shut her eyelids tight, as if the sight
  hurt her.</p>

  <p>"That pleases you!" she exclaimed, twisting her hands convulsively. "Ah!
  Don't you understand? It is the most horrible part of it all to me&mdash;that
  I never cared for him. It doubles my shame. He dominated me when he was with
  me, close to me, by my side; but I never cared for him. I had realised that
  by the time I reached England, and my last letter was to tell him so."</p>

  <p>Her whole attitude expressed humiliation. Had she been able to look back
  upon a passion overmastering both Hawke and herself, and encircling them in a
  ring of flame which, by its very brightness, made the world beyond look
  colourless and empty, she could have found some plea to alleviate her
  consciousness of guilt. As it was, however, the episode appeared nakedly
  sordid to her recollection, unredeemed by even a flavour of romance.</p>

  <p>"So you never really cared for him!"</p>

  <p>Gordon's earnest insistence struck her as singular. He seemed to have
  taken no note of the last words, but dwelt upon that one point&mdash;clung to
  it, it appeared. What difference could it make to him, she wondered, whether
  she had cared or not; the sin lay between them none the less. She watched his
  face for the solution. Perplexity was shown in the contracted forehead and in
  a tremulous twitching of the lips. As a matter of fact, Gordon was hunting a
  will-o'-the-wisp of hope, and it had led him to the brink of a resolve.
  Should he take the leap, or soberly decline it! He hesitated, half made up
  his mind, took one short halting step towards Kate and stopped, checked by a
  new thought.</p>

  <p>"You said you would have broken off our engagement had he allowed
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Yes! I said that."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you when you returned to England and felt free from him?"</p>

  <p>The girl gained a hint of his drift more from his manner than his
  question, and answered him warily, with a spark of hope.</p>

  <p>"Because, as I told you, I relied on you so much, and I felt the need of
  some one I could trust more than ever then. Besides, every one approved of
  the marriage."</p>

  <p>An abrupt movement warned her that she had chosen a wrong turning. A quick
  traverse, however, brought her out upon the right road again.</p>

  <p>"It is not so easy for a girl to cut the knot. She must find explanations
  to justify her&mdash;valid not only to her parents, but to the man. And I
  knew you would not let me go so lightly. I knew that I meant all the world to
  you."</p>

  <p>She paused, but Gordon gave no sign, and she repeated her words with a
  nervous smile.</p>

  <p>"It sounds queer, but it is true all the same. I knew that I meant all the
  world to you."</p>

  <p>Again she waited, but with a like result. He was still pondering, still in
  doubt. The way in which he drew his breath, now in short, jerky catches, now
  in a long, labouring sigh, made that plain to her. Her shot had failed of its
  aim.</p>

  <p>A sudden gust of the wind brought the rustle of the trees through the open
  door. Kate looked at the clock; the hands made one threatening line.</p>

  <p>"Two o'clock!" she cried, with a start. "I must get back to Keswick while
  they are still asleep&mdash;asleep." She spoke the word again with a
  melancholy longing in her voice which was indescribably sad.</p>

  <p>"You will write, then," she resumed, "and break it off."</p>

  <p>Gordon nodded assent, and she turned away in search for something.</p>

  <p>The action helped to decide Gordon by pointing out the necessity of
  decision. What course should he take? He had thought to choose his path on
  careful reflection when Kate was on her way back to Keswick; but he saw now
  that would be too late. It would be time enough then to consider the
  consequences of his choice, how best to cope with them and force them to his
  service; but the choice itself could not be deferred. For if he let her go
  quietly without another word the matter would be settled finally, the choice
  determined, a prison wall raised to further effort. What course should he
  take? The question pressed urgently for an immediate answer.</p>

  <p>He went to the door and out into the porch. The sudden slip into night
  seemed to him a symbol of what his life would mean if he kept silence. His
  mind played with the idea and carried it further. It pictured him standing
  alone in the empty darkness and the girl behind him alone in the empty light.
  The beck, too, at the back of the house, whispered its music in his ears and
  pleaded with him.</p>

  <p>A timid hand was laid on his arm: Kate was by his side.</p>

  <p>"David!"</p>

  <p>"I was listening to the brook," he said.</p>

  <p>For a while they both stood quiet in the gloom of the porch.</p>

  <p>"What do you hear in it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I dare not tell you. What do you?"</p>

  <p>"I hear all my days to come flowing down and down with a sound of
  tears."</p>

  <p>"David!" she said, her voice breaking on the name.</p>

  <p>He had often noticed the wonderful clearness of her eyes, and they shone
  very softly on him now. He drew her towards him in the gloom of the
  porch.</p>

  <p>"Kitty!" he whispered, "tell me that it isn't true! Tell me I have been
  dreaming! I will believe you. I must believe you. For if I lose faith in you,
  I lose faith in everything. You have been the light of my life, making the
  world real. If that dies out, I live in the dark, always."</p>

  <p>Her heart sank lower with every word he uttered. She had hoped for
  forgiveness, for a recognition of the dead sin, with a belief in an atoning
  future. But he gave her no hint of that. Nay, his very phrases proved that
  the conception was beyond his reach. "If I lose faith in you, I lose faith in
  everything." The sentence showed the exotic sickliness of his faith,
  demonstrated it no vital inherent part of him rooted in his being, but an
  alien graft watered and kept alive by his passion. He had not the sturdiness
  to accept the facts, nor the sincerity to foresee the possibility of
  redemption. He would marry her. Yes! But his motive was an instinct of
  self-preservation rather than his love for her. She would still have to pose
  upon her pedestal, apeing the stainless goddess; he would still have to kneel
  at her feet, apeing the worshipper; and both in their hearts would know the
  hollowness of their pretence.</p>

  <p>Kate realised the futility of such a marriage, and looking forward, caught
  a glimpse of the day when the sham would shred and vanish before the truth,
  like a morning mist at sunrise.</p>

  <p>Gordon felt her whole frame relax and draw away from him. He clasped her
  hands; there was no response in them. He held her closer, placed one hand
  behind her head and turned her face up towards him, while the warm curls
  nestled and twined about his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Kitty! Why don't you answer? Tell me that it isn't true! Every belief I
  have depends on that."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Don't make me responsible for everything," she replied, with a flash
  of her old petulance. "I am only one woman in the world."</p>

  <p>"But the only woman in the world for me. You know it. You said so
  yourself. Tell me that it isn't true! Lie to me, if you must!" he added, with
  a passionate cry. "I will believe the lie."</p>

  <p>"That could be of no use either to you or to me."</p>

  <p>She spoke coldly, with the familiar feeling of repugnance reawakened by
  his effort to canonise her afresh. Besides, the knowledge of the truth
  vibrated in every tone of his voice, and his despairing resolve to crush and
  drown that knowledge added a sense of mockery to her repulsion.</p>

  <p>"That could be of no use," she said. "There was just a chance of our
  joining hands again, but what you have said has destroyed it."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"You may some day."</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> true," she resumed. "All that you saw, all that you heard
  Austen Hawke say, all that I have told you&mdash;every word of it is
  true."</p>

  <p>She turned from him and went back into the room, while Gordon sank upon
  the low coping of the garden fence.</p>

  <p>The girl came out to him again after a while.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen my shawl? I can't find it."</p>

  <p>"Did you bring it away from the Inn?" Gordon asked, dully.</p>

  <p>The question made Kate start. She must have left it there.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Gordon said; "I will get it back with the letters."</p>

  <p>He passed through the porch and took down a lanthorn from a nail in the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"I will come up with you to the head of the Pass."</p>

  <p>"Don't light it," she said. "It might be seen."</p>

  <p>Very well!</p>

  <p>He was on the point of replacing it, but stopped and asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Did you bring one with your horse?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Then I had better take it. It will keep you from stumbling when you are
  riding home. There is a scarf on the sofa."</p>

  <p>Kate twisted it over her head and they passed out softly into the
  lane.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The wind had dropped with the advance of morning, and only
  an impalpable breath&mdash;a faint reminiscence of the wind it
  seemed&mdash;stirring the larch-clumps, dotted here and there along the lower
  edges of their path, broke the stillness for a moment as they passed. They
  paused by the side of a watercourse which, descending from Great Gable, the
  mountain on their left, cut through the track on its way to the centre of the
  valley and caused a gap of some fifty feet. Stones planted at intervals
  uncertainly in the stream gave an insecure footing, and afforded the only
  traverse to the opposite side; and in the darkness their position was dimly
  shown, or, rather, could be hazily guessed at, by little points of white
  where the water swirled and broke about them.</p>

  <p>"I must have crossed it when I came," said Kate, blankly. "But I don't
  remember. I don't seem to have noticed it at all. I should slip on the
  stepping-stones now."</p>

  <p>"Let me carry you over!"</p>

  <p>"No!" she replied quickly. "I crossed it safely before. I can do the same
  again."</p>

  <p>There was a greater confidence in her words than in her voice, and she
  still hesitated on the brink. Instinctively she laid a hand upon Gordon's
  sleeve for steadiness, but drew it away hurriedly when she felt the contact
  of his arm. Her companion renewed his offer of help, but, without answering
  him, she stepped forward on to the nearest boulder. Her foot, set down
  timidly, slipped on its polished roundness. Gordon, however, was alert to her
  fatigue, and his arm was round her waist before she had completely lost her
  balance.</p>

  <p>"Lean towards me," he said, and lightly lifted her back on to the bank.
  She remained for a second in his support, lulled by a physical feeling of
  security induced in her by the strong clasp of his arm. Then she freed
  herself almost roughly, and silently faced the stream again.</p>

  <p>"It will be best if I go first," said Gordon. "I can give you a hand
  then."</p>

  <p>"Is there no other crossing?" she asked, straining her gaze vainly up and
  down the stream.</p>

  <p>"No! Surely you can take that much help from me."</p>

  <p>He planted himself as firmly as he could, Colossus-wise on the rocks.</p>

  <p>"All right!" he said, and stretched out a hand towards her. She took it
  reluctantly and made a second trial, wavered as she reached the stone on
  which she had slipped, and secured her balance by tightening her grasp. So
  they proceeded until a wider interval than usual flowed between their
  footholds.</p>

  <p>Gordon turned his head round to her.</p>

  <p>"You must let go of me here!"</p>

  <p>"Must I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! or I may slip and drag you in."</p>

  <p>She only realised how hard had been her grip when she relaxed it, and the
  consequent knowledge of the assistance she had needed gave her a momentary
  sense of loneliness now that it was removed. Gordon was just able to bridge
  the distance between the boulders with the full reach of his stride. That on
  which he now stood, however, was flat and broad, a platform that gave sure
  footing.</p>

  <p>"You will have to spring," he cried. "I can catch you. I am solid enough
  here."</p>

  <p>"I can't," she replied, "I daren't move."</p>

  <p>She stood looking into the water bubbling at her feet, and its swift flow
  made her feel giddy and insecure.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" she cried plaintively.</p>

  <p>"You must jump," Gordon answered. "It is the only way. Jump boldly! Don't
  be afraid, I will catch you."</p>

  <p>The ring of confidence in his voice enheartened her, and she tried to face
  the leap, but recoiled from it. Why had she refused his offer, was her first
  thought; why had he not renewed it, her second. The stone on which she was
  standing rolled with the movement, and she uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>"Dav&mdash;," she began, and shore the name of its tail.</p>

  <p>In a moment he was by her side, standing on the bed of the channel and the
  water up to his thighs. The girl clung to him.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have lost my nerve altogether," and she essayed a laugh
  unsuccessfully.</p>

  <p>"You are tired, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am tired," she answered, "very tired."</p>

  <p>And she leaned her weight upon him, resting her arm on his shoulders.
  Their muscular breadth renewed in her the feeling of protection, and she
  waited expectantly for him to propose again to carry her, or, better still,
  to just lift her up without a word and so spare her a repast of her own
  words. To all seeming, however, Gordon was waiting too. "He means the request
  to come from me," she thought. As a matter of fact, nothing was farther from
  his reflections. The experience of the past few hours had rendered the
  perfect control of his faculties impossible, and the shuttles in the loom of
  his mind, set at work by the touch of any chance suggestion, were weaving his
  thoughts in a grotesque inconsequence. The tension of her attitude recalled
  the pedestal on which he had perched her, as she said, to the undoing of them
  both. He had a vision of a pair of tiny feet, delicately shod in grey kid
  slippers, straining to fix high heels firmly on a smooth sloping surface.</p>

  <p>Kate threw out a more patent suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I am very tired, and this stone is not over restful."</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking," he answered abstractedly, "it must be as awkward as
  my pedestal."</p>

  <p>The unconscious sarcasm stung her to the quick.</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh at me!" she pleaded, and realised that she was pleading.</p>

  <p>"Laugh at you?" he replied. "Good God! I have got to finish my laugh at
  myself first, and I think it will take me all my life."</p>

  <p>"For believing in me?" she asked rather sadly. The bitterness of his
  remark seemed to show her that he grasped at last the full folly of his faith
  in her. It was the goal at which she had been aiming, and yet, now that it
  was reached, she felt a keen pang of regret.</p>

  <p>"No! For demanding so much myself."</p>

  <p>The knowledge that she had mistaken his meaning gratified her and, indeed,
  raised him in her respect. The words, spoken at another time, would only have
  served to strengthen her old conception of him, and to justify that lurking
  contempt for his humility which formed a factor in her ready reliance upon
  his services. Now, however, she stood in sore need of his help; he was there
  dominating her plainly by the superiority of his physical strength, and he
  could afford to be humble, nay, rather bettered his position by the
  contrast.</p>

  <p>Kate gave in and said weakly:</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I shall have to ask you to carry me across after
  all."</p>

  <p>"It is what I came back for," he answered, no suspicion of her thoughts
  occurring to him. He lifted her slight figure with an absence of effort or
  jerk which told of practised sinews, and Kate clasped her hands behind his
  neck and nestled down into his arms with a child's sigh of content. To Gordon
  the sigh conveyed no direct or immediate meaning. His fanciful tendency to
  symbolism made it expressive only of the relief she had experienced on
  stepping down from her pedestal.</p>

  <p>Had he but known it, however, he was nearer to her heart than he had ever
  been. He was showing himself in the man's shape which most appealed to her.
  He was the protector, not the attendant, with strength to be appreciated as
  masterful, not to be carelessly used and forgotten. Had he stopped dead in
  mid-stream and asserted his cause with a like mental force, claiming her and
  her sins to himself with the courage of a confident love, he would have
  undone the harm of his maladroit pleading in the porch.</p>

  <p>It was the crucial moment of his life. But his dominance was of the body,
  not the spirit, and he passed through it without an inkling of its
  importance.</p>

  <p>The next moment he reached the farther bank and set her silently on the
  ground, apart from him.</p>

  <p>From this point the path rose steeply along the side of Great Gable, and
  as they mounted, the brisk freshness of the air revived the girl's languid
  spirits. Her lassitude and the feeling of helpless weakness which it
  engendered gradually gave place to a lively buoyancy. A new vigour entered
  her limbs. Gordon was walking a few paces ahead of her, the lanthorn swinging
  at his side on a shoulder-strap, and now and again he turned to help her over
  some rough portion of the track. But the way was almost as familiar to her as
  it was to him, and as they rose she needed his assistance less and less. The
  limpid clearness of the night, too, contributed in no small measure to this
  invigoration of her nature. The sky was unstained by a cloud, and glittered
  with a multitude of stars that shone like points of silver, so that the
  darkness below had a certain translucency. One seemed to see right into the
  heart of the night; at the same time, the landmarks and boundary walls in the
  valley&mdash;always productive of a sense of limit&mdash;were invisible, and
  the very mountains appeared but deeper shadows, a massing of the darkness, as
  it were, at separate spots, with here and there a gap from the faint glimmer
  of a snowdrift. The journey thus appealed to Kate's senses by its aspect of
  spaciousness and filled her with a new and strange feeling of liberty. The
  feeling penetrated to her mind and set in motion a train of thought which, in
  turn, gave back to it a fresh strength and colour. A consciousness of
  distinct relief forced itself into evidence as the main result to her of
  Gordon's chance visit to Wastdale Head, and obliterated to a great degree the
  shame of the disclosures which had paved the way for it. She was free alike
  from the brutal authority of Austen Hawke and from the irksome tyranny of
  Gordon's adoration; for the former's power rested upon its concealment and
  was killed by Gordon's discovery of its existence. Every trace of it would
  vanish when he recovered the three remaining letters. Of the means by which
  they were to be regained she took no more thought than Gordon at this time
  did himself. She was too absorbed by her newly-found freedom to foresee the
  possibility of danger there. Its forcible pre-occupation of her mind indeed
  blinded her to all ideas which hinted antagonism. She barely wasted a
  conjecture on the pretext which her companion would select for the breaking
  off of their engagement almost on the eve of their marriage. She just caught
  a dim glimpse of him taking the blame upon himself, and was restfully content
  to leave the exact solution in his hands. "I will spare you altogether," he
  had said; and she knew him well enough for complete assurance that he would
  keep his word. That she owed her liberty entirely to the generosity of her
  lover, she hardly felt at all now; from habit, she was incapable of
  accounting that quality of his at its true value. For a moment, it is true,
  at the outset of her interview with him in the farm-house, she appreciated
  with some accuracy the measure of his devotion; but this estimation was due
  merely to the immediate succession of his presence to that of Hawke and to
  the pronounced contrast between their attitudes. As their conversation wore
  on, however, his voice, his words, and certain tricks of manner, gradually
  brought back to her the familiar conceptions of character which she had
  always associated with them. And in consequence of the return of those
  conceptions, the old habit of expecting sacrifices from him as his usual
  tribute reasserted itself afresh. Her sense of liberty was thus unmarred by
  doubts or fears, and the rebound of her nature from a preceding despair gave
  to it a double exhilaration. She drank in the night air with a keen pleasure,
  its brisk sharpness seeming somehow to harmonise with her thoughts. She would
  begin her life anew to-morrow, using her knowledge as a clear light for the
  guiding of her steps. She had a vision of morning mists clearing off a long
  white road and leaving it vividly distinct&mdash;a road in Normandy.</p>

  <p>The influence of the hour and the locality was no less predominant over
  her fellow-traveller, but it led his thoughts in a far opposite direction.
  All the way up that wearisome ascent he was strewing his steps with the dead
  leaves of his illusions. The edifice of idealism which he had built up, fancy
  upon fancy, with such care and such seeming solidity, crumbled in an
  irresistible decay and forced him to the contemplation of its ruins. And the
  surrounding space, shapeless and empty of life, stimulated his poignant sense
  of desolation. He tried to picture and place actual features of the dale, to
  map out the darkness by his recollections of what it hid. Across there would
  be the dark mouth of Peer's Ghyll; or had he passed it?&mdash;above his head
  the cliffs of Great Gable, with its familiar Pinnacle; now he should be
  opposite the bathing-pool at the bottom of the valley. But it was all
  uncertainty and surmise, and so far was Gordon from drawing solace from his
  conjectures, that the intervening gloom, by its sensuous effect, helped
  largely to re-animate and nurse his old belief in the shifty unreality of
  things. He came to feel certain of nothing except the narrow strip of path he
  trod and the light footsteps behind which were following him for the last
  time, and of which the sound to his ears was exquisitely sad.</p>

  <p>They had reached the highest point of the track, where two masses of rock,
  ranged on either side, form a ruined gateway to the Pass. From there the
  ground slopes quickly to the Styhead Tarn, and as they skirted its edge they
  heard the welcoming neigh of Kate's horse. It was tied to the far end of a
  primitive footbridge which spans the beck in the valley but a few yards
  beyond. Gordon lit the lanthorn and fastened it to the saddle, and, standing
  on the end of the bridge, lifted the girl on to the horse's back. For a
  moment they remained there, she in the shadow, he with the light streaming
  full on his face, and then without a word Kate gathered up the reins and rode
  off eastwards along the Pass. She felt that he was still standing on the
  bridge in the darkness, but she never turned her head. After a while, she
  heard him cry out her name "Kitty!" The sound echoed down the hollow in a
  despairing wail, like a death-cry, and was faintly repeated by the mountains
  that closed her in, but she only pressed her horse the harder, and rode more
  steadily towards her home.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In a sense, indeed, it was a death-cry that she heard. For
  Gordon, as he watched her ride away, and listened to the lanthorn clanking
  against the saddle, knew that his real self went with her.</p>

  <p>The extended sympathy for his fellows which he had fostered during these
  last two years, his interest in their comings and goings, his ambitions and
  his assiduous patience in straining after their attainment&mdash;in fact, the
  finer qualities of his nature seemed not merely to have been awakened by his
  one great passion, but to have gained their being from it and to be dependent
  upon it for their life. They were, if one may use the phrase, the reflex of
  his imaginative belief in the worth of his mistress&mdash;a belief founded
  purely upon sentiment and sustained by misconceptions of different points in
  her bearing, such as a certain air of disdain she habitually wore, which was
  in itself only the result of a fastidious intuition in matters of taste and
  the like, and which Gordon mistook for the visible sign of an innate
  superiority.</p>

  <p>And so this mute farewell meant something more to him than even the final
  parting from the woman he loved; it was also a parting from his gentler
  nature. All that there was of goodness and truth in him had come into his
  life through Kate Nugent, and now that she took her gift back with her as she
  went, she left him stripped almost of his humanity, bare and scarred as the
  rugged crags surrounding him. So intense and poignant grew the feeling of his
  loss, that he came to fancy, with the imagery peculiar to his bent, that his
  very soul was the flame of the candle in the lanthorn, which he saw, like a
  red star, moving farther and farther into the distance.</p>

  <p>He made one last spasmodic effort, like a dying man clutching at his life.
  He ran forward in a mad revolt, and the well-loved name sprang to his lips.
  "Kitty!" he shouted, his whole being in the cry. But no answer came back to
  him; he heard the lanthorn still faintly clanking against the saddle, and the
  mountains drearily mocking him with their melancholy repetition of his word,
  while the light went steadily dwindling down the Pass&mdash;a pin's head of
  fire.</p>

  <p>For a moment he waited stone-still, staring after it, and then flung
  himself face-downwards in the bracken, tearing the roots convulsively with
  his fingers. A savage fury seized him and ran through his veins like a flame,
  demanding action and retaliation. Any passive return to the old trough of his
  cynicism was barred by a clear consciousness of what might have been had Kate
  but matched his truth to her with a like truth to him, and by an exaggerated
  self-reproach which led him still to fix the chief blame for her treachery
  upon his own failure to understand her. But there was another man to share
  his blame. The thought swept down upon him&mdash;a black whirlwind blotting
  out even the image of Kate. If he had erred himself, it was through excess of
  chivalry; he could, at all events, plead that. But Hawke! Gordon was unable
  to think of him; he only saw him a sinister picture of malice and craft, and
  as he looked he became filled with a venom of hate. Hawke's face rose before
  his mind, every feature magnified and stamped with the brand of his
  character, and remained fixed in full view leering at him. Gordon's loathing
  grew until he felt sick with the strength of it. He sprang hastily to his
  feet. The night was very clear, and low down to the ground a spark was just
  visible in the far distance. But he did not look that way; he turned his back
  towards Keswick and blindly, with stumbling steps, descended into Wastdale
  towards his enemy. And all the length of that path Hawke's face bore him
  company.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p>It was close upon four when Kate started off upon her long ride, and, with
  the knowledge that she had no time to spare, she urged her horse on at a
  greater speed than the roughness of the Pass made prudent. Once, indeed, at
  the far end, when the track takes a sudden turn at right angles to its
  previous course, and begins to wind down into Borrowdale, she barely escaped
  a heavy fall, and was only saved by the quick recovery of the beast she rode.
  At the bottom of the decline, however, after crossing Stockley Bridge, the
  path widens out on to more level ground. But it runs through pastures, and
  Kate's progress was impeded by a succession of gates which, since she carried
  no crop, compelled her to dismount to open them. But by the time she had
  reached Sea Toller&mdash;the long white house, lying two miles from the base
  of Styhead&mdash;the difficulties of her journey were ended. A firm, broad
  road led straight from that point over the nine miles which separated Kate
  from Keswick, and she roused her horse to a gallop. The animal stretched
  itself out in a full stride as if it realised the need for haste, making the
  night air ring with the clatter of its hoofs, and it seemed to Kate that
  barely a minute could have passed before she burst through the little village
  of Rosthwaite.</p>

  <p>This quick approach to home, however, plunged a new fear into her
  breast.</p>

  <p>What if her family had discovered her absence?</p>

  <p>The question was a fever to her blood. At the time she had set off from
  Keswick the chance of that discovery had appeared to her the least of the
  dangers that she ran, so completely had she been engrossed by the necessity
  of regaining her letters; and, besides, she had laid her plans carefully,
  with perfect confidence in the fidelity of the groom. Afterwards, at
  Wastdale, the hurry of events had obscured her to all speculation on the
  matter, compelling a concentration of her faculties upon immediate issues.
  Now, however, she began to see a hundred threatening possibilities.</p>

  <p>She had pleaded a headache. What more likely than that her father or her
  aunt should have come to her room to inquire after her before they went to
  bed? Her father?&mdash;she dismissed him with a moment's reflection. The good
  man took life and his daughter's ailments easily. But her aunt! Kate
  remembered with a shiver that she was a homoeopathist. She was bound to have
  inquired. She could not enter the room, it is true, for Kate had locked the
  door and held the key safe in her pocket.</p>

  <p>She felt in her dress suddenly, half-expecting to find that she had
  dropped it. It was safe, however, and she experienced a relief; but the
  relief was only momentary.</p>

  <p>For the window of her bedroom opened level on to the garden. A lucky
  advantage, she had considered it before, as affording an easy egress and
  return. Now it seemed to her the most vulnerable point in her plan. For if
  her aunt made inquiries at the door, and received no answer, she had but to
  step into the garden to solve her perplexities. A passing vision of an old
  lady in bedroom slippers padding over the grass with a box of pills failed to
  distract her. Kate sent her wits abroad on the wings of fear in search of
  excuses, but they returned to her empty-handed. Her dread was, moreover,
  accentuated by a retrospect upon the other dangers of that night. Her
  successful evasion of them only made this last risk loom the larger.</p>

  <p>The nearer she drew towards home, the more it overshadowed her. When she
  crossed the marsh land at the end of the Lake, discovery had already become
  the probability; by the time she passed Lodore, a certainty, and when she
  topped Castle Hill, just above Keswick town, she strained her eyes towards
  the water's edge, fully expecting to see every window of their house ablaze
  with light.</p>

  <p>All was in darkness, however, except for one faint glimmer, which Kate
  guessed came from the stables. The revulsion of feeling which she underwent
  acted on her like a shock, and she reined up her horse and clung to the
  saddle, dizzy. In the hollow a clock chimed the half-hour, lifting a silvery
  encouragement, and she moved on again slowly down the hill. Some twenty yards
  from the front of the house she dismounted, led the horse into a lane which
  gave on to the road, crossed a paddock at the back of the garden, and reached
  the stables, which stood apart from the main building. The light which she
  had noticed came from the harness-room; she tapped softly on the window-pane
  and was answered by a low growl, followed by a sharp "Quiet!"</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards the door was opened cautiously, and the groom
  Martin appeared and led the horse in quietly. Kate followed him and closed
  the door.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" she asked, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Just gone half-past five, Miss."</p>

  <p>"Has any one&mdash;I mean, no one has noticed my absence?"</p>

  <p>Martin reassured her, with a touch of patronage in his tone, which a
  cockney deficiency of aspirates made singularly unpalatable. She turned to
  the collie; he had followed Martin from the harness-room and was wisely
  superintending the proceedings with his ear cocked and his head on one
  side.</p>

  <p>"You brought Charlie in."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss! I dursn't leave him in the yard. He mightn't have known your
  footsteps at once."</p>

  <p>"That was thoughtful of you." The dog took the compliment to itself after
  the fashion of its kind, and showed his appreciation by planting his forepaws
  as high up on her as he could, and stretching itself lazily.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," said Kate. "Good night!" and she hurried across the
  yard, pursued by a whispered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You 're very welcome, Miss, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>A wicket-gate gave her entrance into the garden, and she crept softly to
  the window of her bedroom, and opened it with a palpitating heart. Nothing,
  however, had been disarranged, the room was as she had left it. She did not
  dare to risk a light, but flung off her clothes quickly in the dark, unlocked
  the door, and tumbled into bed. For a long time sleep would not come to her
  in spite of her fatigue. She heard the clock strike six, and then half-past.
  For now that she herself was safe, her thoughts unconsciously reverted to
  Gordon. She saw his face again framed in the darkness, as the light fell on
  it from her lanthorn, and wondered whether he was still on the bridge,
  looking eastwards down the Pass. That last cry of his recurred to her.
  "Kitty!" The name rang in her ears, stretched out into a threnody. She tried
  to flee from it, and it pursued her, now swelling into the deep peal of an
  organ-note, now sinking into a pitiful wail. And it was not merely the cry
  she heard, but Gordon's voice in it, vibrating with its hopeless misery. For
  a time it accused her sharply, but with continual repetition began to lose
  its meaning. The girl started to murmur the word to herself mechanically, in
  an undertone of accompaniment. Finally it became a lullabye, and so hymned
  her to sleep.</p>

  <p>"Kitty!"</p>

  <p>Was she destined to hear it all her life, Kate questioned on the
  borderland of sleep.</p>

  <p>"Kitty!"</p>

  <p>A hand was laid on her shoulder and she woke with a start. A girl-cousin,
  one of the intending bridesmaids, was standing by her bedside.</p>

  <p>"How startled you look!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you were&mdash;&mdash;" Kate checked herself in confusion, and
  a peal of laughter rippled through the room. It warned her of the part she
  had to play.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" she asked hastily.</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock! Your aunt would not have you called before. How is your
  head?"</p>

  <p>Kate asserted complete recovery and proceeded to dress, though with a
  languid dilatoriness which belied her statement. The house was nearly full of
  her women-folk relations, and she dreaded to face them. She looked at herself
  in the mirror and fancied every one would read her night's ride in her jaded
  pallor and the shadows about her eyes. Even her father noticed them when she
  entered the breakfast-room, with a "You don't look over bright, Kitty!" The
  company was assembled in full force about the table, and she had to run the
  gauntlet of their smirking condolements. "Never mind. I will put you right.
  It's bile." Homoeopathy smiled comfortably from behind the tea-urn, and Kate
  for the first time thanked Providence for the birth of Dr. Hahnemann. She
  noticed with relief that the meal was nearly over, but gained no respite
  thereby. For, after breakfast, there were new presents to be inspected and
  acclaimed&mdash;noticeably one from Poonah, a jade idol of most admired
  ugliness. Kate explained her shiver of repulsion by the carven malice of its
  features. Then followed consultations upon frocks, interspersed with eulogies
  of David and predictions of the happiness in store for well-assorted couples,
  plainly calling for enthusiastic answers nicely tempered by a diffident
  modesty. At times, indeed, the task almost exceeded her powers of endurance,
  and she felt madly spurred to hurl the truth like a bombshell into the midst
  of the flummery. She restrained herself, however, drawing a faint solace of
  amusement from a mental picture of the resultant chaos, and somehow or
  another the day wore on to its close. "They will know in the morning," she
  reflected. But she was mistaken. It was not until the third day that the news
  of the liberation came.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p>Gordon quickened his pace as he reached the basin of the valley under an
  apprehension lest he should find the farm people already risen. For, although
  it was still quite dark, there was all around him that universal movement, as
  if the earth itself were stirring from its sleep, which tells of an
  approaching dawn. The last two fields he covered at a run and regained the
  farm only to discover that his fears were groundless. The lamp in his parlour
  was still alight, but beginning to flicker for want of replenishing. Gordon
  cautiously opened the door at the foot of the staircase and listened. But he
  could hear nothing but his own breathing; evidently no one was moving as yet.
  He returned into the room to blow out the lamp, but was checked by the sight
  of his writing case on a cabinet against the wall. He went to it, drew out a
  packet of letters, and, pulling up a chair to the table, read, by the last
  spurts of the light, those which Kate had sent to him from Poonah. How blind
  he must have been, he thought. Why, effort was visible in every line of them,
  coldness seeking to screen itself beneath a wealth of phrases. He commenced
  to speculate curiously which portions were Hawke's dictation and which her
  own work; otherwise the letters awakened no feeling in him. Phrases here and
  there fixed his attention. "You came into my life like a ray of sunlight into
  a musty room." Yes! Hawke would have invented that, knowing how it would
  appeal to him. And, again, "I feel that I can rely on you whatever
  comes"&mdash;a postscript, scribbled hastily and smudged, evidently Kate's
  own, and written covertly in Hawke's presence. The extinction of the lamp put
  an end to this unprofitable investigation, and Gordon gathered the letters
  together, placed them in the grate, and set them ablaze. He waited until the
  last spark had died out and a heap of black flaky ashes was all that was left
  of the false tokens which he had treasured as sacred, and then crept
  cautiously up to his room. For some time he remained by his window, thinking.
  He noticed the angle in the barn-wall from which Hawke had darted out, and it
  seemed to him that the century might well have run to its end since then. His
  mind wandered to a side-issue, jumping at a stray suggestion that Time was
  held to mark age only because it represented the conventional progress of
  self-knowledge.</p>

  <p>But what if the knowledge of twenty years were crowded into one night?
  Gordon felt that that had been the case with him. He understood so much now;
  for instance, the fancy which had fleetingly occurred to him that they both
  had been brought into the isolation of that valley to work out a predestined
  purpose. He understood that purpose, could explain it, and would demonstrate
  his explanation to the other's ignorance tomorrow. A gradual fading of colour
  from the sky made him correct himself. "To-day," he murmured, with something
  of quiet exultation in his voice. Only he must spare Kate; no suspicion must
  be allowed to connect her with the solution of his problem. "I feel that I
  can rely on you whatever comes," she had written. Well, he must prove to her
  that she was right&mdash;some way or another. The sound of movement in the
  interior of the house brought him back to the present and hinted the
  advantage of rest. So Gordon went to bed and slept dreamlessly until the sun
  stood high above the shoulder of Great End.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As Gordon was breakfasting next morning, the door was thrown
  open and Hawke strolled in from the lane.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you got over your fatigue yet?" he asked, with a show of
  cordiality.</p>

  <p>"Quite, thanks!"</p>

  <p>Gordon let a moment or two slip before he found his tongue. For his new
  knowledge, acting vividly upon a somewhat morbid imagination, had not merely
  changed his conceptions of Hawke's character, but, with them, also his very
  impressions of his appearance. He had been unconsciously developing the man's
  features and body to express the qualities which he now attributed to him,
  moulding them, as it were, by the model of his own thoughts. So that, at the
  first, when Hawke stood before him in the flesh, clearly lit by the sunlight,
  which was pouring in through the open doorway, he hardly recognised his
  enemy. The very colloquialism of his speech seemed incongruous and out of
  place.</p>

  <p>"You slept soundly?" asked Hawke.</p>

  <p>There was a shade of anxiety in the question appreciable by his observer,
  and a faint symptom of a sneer about the lips when the answer was
  received.</p>

  <p>"Like a humming-top."</p>

  <p>"You are going over to Eskdale, aren't you?" Gordon resumed.</p>

  <p>"I shall if I have time."</p>

  <p>"You have changed your plans?" The query was put with a sudden
  alacrity.</p>

  <p>"More or less. Lawson arrived at the Inn this morning from Drigg."</p>

  <p>"Lawson?"</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy you know him, but he was a friend of Arkwright's."</p>

  <p>"And is he going to stay here?" The anxiety was upon Gordon's side now.
  Everything depended on the answer. For the presence of this interloper, even
  for a day, would render the accomplishment of his purpose impossible.</p>

  <p>"No! He is on his way to Buttermere. I am going with him part of the
  distance, and we mean to spend an hour or so on the Pillar Rock. If I have
  time I shall work round to Eskdale afterwards."</p>

  <p>"It will mean a long day."</p>

  <p>"Yes! But I have to leave for London to-morrow. And, by the way, that is
  what brought me up here. I shall be late back, I expect, and I want to borrow
  your lanthorn."</p>

  <p>Hawke turned towards the nail on which he had seen it hanging the previous
  night. Gordon just managed to check an involuntary start from his chair when
  the other wheeled quickly round.</p>

  <p>"Why, it is gone!" he said suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Haven't they any at the Inn?"</p>

  <p>The counter-thrust was delivered with a perfect assumption of
  carelessness, and Hawke parried it clumsily.</p>

  <p>"Only one, and that's broken. So I thought I would borrow yours."</p>

  <p>"I should have been pleased to lend it you, but it belongs to the house. I
  suppose the farmer has taken it."</p>

  <p>The indifference with which Gordon spoke disarmed Hawke, and the next
  moment a shadow darkening the doorway effectually prevented any further
  investigation as to the whereabouts of the missing article. The newcomer
  carried a lanthorn.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't mind me intruding," he said. "It's rather unceremonious,
  I know. But Hawke said he was going to borrow your lanthorn. Why, the
  landlady had two or three," he went on, turning to Hawke. "She said she would
  have lent you one with pleasure. So I brought it for you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks! Thanks!" Hawke interposed in confusion. "I must have
  misunderstood her. I never could unravel her dialect." He abruptly introduced
  his friend to Gordon, and resumed: "I was just speaking of you. Gordon, you
  know, was with Arkwright when he died."</p>

  <p>The conversation drifted into the desired channel, but too late to prevent
  Gordon realising that the request for a lanthorn had been the merest pretext
  to enable Hawke to assure himself that the night's proceedings remained a
  secret. It was interrupted, however, by the servant, who bustled in with the
  tray to clear the table, and Gordon thought with a tremor: Suppose she had
  entered a minute earlier? Hawke would have been certain to question her, and
  to repeat his request; as it was, however, he was too anxious to cover his
  slip to risk broaching the subject again.</p>

  <p>"That is a good-looking girl," said Lawson, when she had left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Is she?" Gordon inquired. "I have not noticed her."</p>

  <p>Lawson smothered an incredulous laugh, and Hawke broke in: "Oh, it's true
  enough! Gordon never notices women's looks. They are too sacred to him."</p>

  <p>"And you nothing but their looks, I am told," Lawson replied. "Well, I
  shall try to strike the golden mean."</p>

  <p>"You will be making a mistake if you do," Hawke answered.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because women are moods. Nothing more. They can cover the distance
  between Diana and Phryne at a jump. They are mere moods, and always to be
  construed in the present tense. You must take them as they are."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have made a grammatical study of the subject," Lawson
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"No! That is exactly what I have not done. It is of no use. For, being
  moods, they are unintelligble, and the man who tries to solve them usually
  comes to grief. Besides, the effort is really unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"You speak from experience?" Gordon asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I don't say that," Hawke replied, and with a shade more of earnestness
  than the occasion seemed to demand. "No, I don't say that. You may call it a
  theory of mine if you like. But I believe that it is true all the same. All
  that you want to know about a woman is the colour of her hair and eyes,
  whether she paints, how she is dressed, the texture of her gloves, and the
  size of her boots."</p>

  <p>"I fancied a woman liked to be talked to about herself," Lawson
  objected.</p>

  <p>"But those things constitute herself&mdash;at all events to most women,"
  he added, seeing that the other was about to interpose. "I admit there may be
  exceptions."</p>

  <p>"But you have never met one."</p>

  <p>Hawke shot a quick glance from beneath knitted brows at Gordon as the
  latter spoke; but the remark had fallen quite casually from his lips, and he
  appeared only bored by the discussion.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to have my ideas attributed to personal causes. An anchorite
  may theorise," Hawke replied.</p>

  <p>"Anchorite is good," said Lawson.</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not, that is the right plan. A woman's self is an awkward
  thing to tackle. It perplexes you if you begin to think about it, and the
  more you think, the more it perplexes you, and, consequently, the stronger
  the hold it seizes on you. And just because a woman's bewildering, you run
  the risk of ending by respecting her&mdash;and that is fatal."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because the moment you begin to respect her, she begins to despise
  you."</p>

  <p>Lawson burst out into a hearty laugh and said, "Come along, Hawke! That is
  enough lecture for to-day. You have made me laugh and bored Gordon to
  death."</p>

  <p>"You epitomise the fate of unconventional truths," Hawke answered, and
  then turned to Gordon.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of my theory? Does it bore you?"</p>

  <p>"I think," Gordon replied, quietly, "that it is one of those theories
  which, to use your own words, sooner or later bring a man to grief."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, yes! and irretrievably," said Lawson. "So you had better take
  care, Master Hawke. I have often noticed that!" he continued musingly. "When
  a man comes to grief over facts, he can pull round if he has any luck. But
  when he comes a cropper over theories, there's an end of him for good and
  all."</p>

  <p>The chance remark made Gordon look towards the speaker with an active
  interest. Hawke's lecture, as Lawson had said, merely bored him. The views it
  set forth were precisely those which he had attributed to the man, and he
  felt so certain of the accuracy of his opinion that the actual utterance of
  the views sounded to him little more than a repetition. His resolve, besides,
  to exact a full and speedy retribution from Hawke was mail of proof alike
  against the covert innuendo of the disquisition and the ironical malice which
  had prompted it. But these last words of Lawson seemed to him instinct with
  truth, and found a convincing commentary in his own experience.</p>

  <p>Lawson shook hands with Gordon and went out in the porch, with Hawke after
  him. The latter paused at the door to adjust the rucksack in which he carried
  their lunch on to his back, and shot a careless "I may see you again this
  evening" backwards over his shoulder, and they both passed the house and
  turned along the track to Black Sail.</p>

  <p>Gordon followed them into the open air. He crossed the field in front of
  the farm, and climbing on to the top of a huge moss-grown mound of stones
  which fills an angle in the boundary wall, lit his pipe and lay in the warm
  sunlight watching them. He could see them for some time toiling up the side
  of Kirkfell into Mosedale, and every now and then he caught a flash as the
  sun glittered on the steel head of an ice-axe. Mosedale forms, as it were, a
  recess in Wastdale, running back from the valley on the side opposite to
  Scafell, and the Pillar mountain makes the end wall of this recess. The
  Pillar Rock, however, to which Lawson and Hawke were directing their steps,
  projects from the further side of the mountain and lies in the northern
  valley of Ennerdale, and the distance between that spot and Wastdale cannot
  be traversed at the quickest in less than an hour.</p>

  <p>Gordon looked at his watch; it was a quarter to ten when they passed from
  his sight behind the shoulder of Kirkfell, and he began to calculate the time
  when he might hope to meet Hawke on Mickledoor Chasm. For that was the spot
  which he had chosen, its bleak solitude appealing to him with a sense of
  appropriateness. Hawke, he reflected, would have to cross Great Gable, and
  the Styhead, continue in the same direction southwards along Esk-Hause, the
  pass to Langdale, and then turn to the right into Eskdale, which is separated
  from the valley of Wastdale by the barrier of the Scafell chain. From there
  he would have to ascend the southern slope of the latter mountain, and Gordon
  reckoned that under no circumstances could he reach Mickledoor, the ridge
  between Scafell and Scafell Pikes, before half-past six.</p>

  <p>It would then be dark.</p>

  <p>That Hawke might change his plan and return home by the way he set out did
  not occur to him until hours after. For the half-formed idea that he was
  working under destiny had grown into a living conviction. He had come to look
  upon himself as the tool and agent in the completion of an ordained plan. So
  keen indeed had this feeling of personal irresponsibility become, that he
  gave no thoughts as to the details by which he was to carry out his purpose,
  confidently leaving occasion to direct the act. A line of Beatrice Cenci's in
  Shelley's play kept marching through his brain&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Thou wert a weapon in the hand of God<br>
  To a just use."</p><br>

  <p>In a word, he was looking across the interval of the next few hours, and
  dignifying as the judicial execution of a law what was in reality only the
  gratification of a savage lust for revenge; a distinction which he might have
  grasped from a certain luxurious feeling in the anticipation of it had he not
  abandoned his habit of self-analysis.</p>

  <p>The illusion was, moreover, very naturally strengthened by the fact that
  circumstances seemed strangely shaping themselves to fit in with his resolve.
  The very appearance of Lawson, which Gordon had considered at first an
  insuperable obstacle, now showed as an additional advantage. For the couple
  had ascended in full view towards the Pillar, in the reverse direction to
  Scafell, and consequently if Hawke's body were found by the latter mountain,
  suspicion would be diverted from the idea of a premeditated attack. It would
  look as if Hawke had changed his route by chance, made the circuit of the
  valley, and then slipped on the cliffs at the opposite end. For Gordon
  reckoned that no one but Lawson and himself knew of Hawke's projected
  expedition, and the former, being ignorant of the hostility between the two
  men, would have no reason to connect him with the accident. That Hawke had
  not mentioned his intentions to the Inn people seemed fairly evident from his
  lie about the lanthorn. Lawson, it is true, might have told them, for he
  borrowed it. Gordon determined to find that out. For at all costs suspicion
  must be diverted from himself for the sake of the girl waiting for his
  message fifteen miles away. He would go down to the Inn now; and besides, he
  recollected he had another mission to accomplish there.</p>

  <p>Gordon rose from his resting-place and had already proceeded some way in
  that direction when he suddenly stopped. After a moment's thought he turned
  on his steps and went back to the farm. He shouted to his landlady to pack up
  his lunch in a parcel, and mounted to his room. The day before he had brought
  over such few articles as he required in a rucksack&mdash;the bag, half
  knapsack, half haversack, peculiar to mountaineers&mdash;and at the bottom of
  this lay, still folded up, an extra coat and pair of knee-breeches of the
  same cloth as those which he was wearing now. He emptied the bag of its other
  contents and descended with it to the parlour. The landlady presently brought
  in the packet which he had ordered, and he placed it with his flask inside
  the rucksack and fastened the strings.</p>

  <p>"Dinner at half-past seven," he said. "I don't expect to be in till then,
  I am going over to Rosthwaite to get some fresh nails hammered into my
  boots."</p>

  <p>And he slung the rucksack on to his shoulders and went down to the Inn. He
  inquired what time they expected Mr. Hawke back. Mr. Hawke, they told him,
  had borrowed a lanthorn and set out for the Pillar, with a friend some time
  since. He knew that, but when did they expect him home? They were not quite
  sure, late they gathered, but Mr. Hawke had said nothing of the matter to
  them. In fact it was his friend who had borrowed the lanthorn. Could Mr.
  Gordon leave a note? Certainly! Would he write it in the coffee-room? Oh! He
  knew Mr. Hawke's sitting-room then. No? The servant would show him to it if
  he preferred to write it there.</p>

  <p>Gordon was accordingly ushered up into the room where the first act of his
  tragical-comical history had been presented to his eyes the night before. He
  wasted no time over his recollections, however, but just cast one curious
  glance towards the outhouse on which he had hung, and proceeded to hunt for
  Kate's missing shawl. The room was furnished upon strictly utilitarian
  principles, and seemed defiantly to challenge inspection by flaunting its
  incapacity for concealment. The search was consequently short. Gordon stopped
  before a cupboard in a recess by the side of the fireplace. There was another
  of a similar make in a corresponding position on the farther side, but that
  stood open, while this one was locked and the key removed. Gordon stooped to
  examine the lock; it belonged to that type which appears to have been
  invented in a genial spirit in order to excite curiosity and gratify it, and
  Gordon's knife proved a quick skeleton-key. He found the shawl, as he had
  expected, carelessly tumbled on to the shelf, and he took it down and ran the
  white fleecy wool through his fingers with a queer sensation, as if he were
  handling something which he ought to recognise and yet could not. As a matter
  of fact, he knew the shawl quite well. He had bought it for Kate himself at
  Goring last September, when the evenings were growing chilly on the river.
  But he had rather fancied that the touch of it would somehow send a thrill
  through his deadened emotions, and the entire absence of any pulsation or
  throb made him hazily wonder for a moment whether this that he held was the
  real shawl of which he was in search.</p>

  <p>He added it, however, to the other contents of his bag, and closed the
  cupboard door. His knife had left little or no trace upon the wood-work,
  which was soft and yielded pliantly; and this Gordon looked upon as an
  important detail. Since, when the room was searched, as it would be
  afterwards, any fresh marks or scratches about the lock might, he thought,
  draw attention to himself, and suggest the possibility of an ulterior motive
  for his visit beyond the mere inditing of a note. As to the lock itself, in
  all probability no one but Hawke knew that it had been fastened, and Hawke's
  knowledge, he reflected, with a smile, would then be a matter of no
  importance. So he only stayed to scribble a hasty line&mdash;an invitation to
  dinner that evening was the somewhat gruesome device on which his ingenuity
  had hit&mdash;and then set out upon his way, following the path which he had
  ascended in the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>Nothing so clearly showed the change which had taken place in Gordon as
  his indifference in retraversing this ground. For although he recollected
  with perfect completeness every feature of that previous journey, he
  recollected it with no shadow of emotion, and almost without interest. The
  facts recurred to him, but devoid of personal application. Gordon remembered
  them much as a man may remember vividly the details of a death which he has
  mourned, when he has well-nigh lost the memory of his regret.</p>

  <p>It was barely one when he reached the cairn upon Styhead Pass, and
  realising that he had five hours still to wear away, he turned to the right
  along Esk House and ascended the central gully in the cliffs of Great End.
  The sky had darkened since the morning, and the air was growing heavy and
  still with a prophecy of a storm; so that he was not surprised, when he came
  out on the summit of the crags, to find the clouds brooding angrily about the
  tops of the fells. Far away, it is true, from one broad solitary rift, he
  could see the sunlight pouring on to Helvellyn and tinting its white slopes
  to a sheet of gold. But there were black masses clustered close above it, as
  if jealous of its glow, and even as he watched, the rift closed up and the
  snow was discoloured to a dull, cheerless grey.</p>

  <p>From that point Gordon doubled back along the edge, descended slowly to
  the gloomy fissure of Piers Gill, crossed the depression at its head and the
  neck of land between Scafell Pikes and Lingmell, and turned up to the left
  towards Mickledoor, the sunken ridge between the former mountain and Scafell.
  It was half-past five when he stood finally upon the top of the gap, and
  already growing rapidly dark. The cold, moreover, had become intense; so that
  that silent wilderness of stones, overhung by black crags, seemed to him in
  the dim light the most desolate spot in all the world. On both sides the
  ridge sloped steeply down in an incline of scree and shattered boulders, the
  debris of the cliffs above. Below that were rounded promontories of brown
  grass strewn here and there with soiled patches of snow. But as far as the
  eye could see there was no trace of a living thing; for the village of
  Wastdale itself was excluded from view by the intervening barrier of
  Lingmell.</p>

  <p>Gordon strained his eyes in the opposite direction to catch a glimpse of
  Hawke mounting from Eskdale. But there was no sign of his coming, not even
  the clatter of a dislodged stone. "It is early yet," he muttered to himself,
  though with the chill of a misgiving. For the first time that day his
  confidence began to fail him. If Hawke should have abandoned his intention of
  making the circuit of the hills, and gone quickly home! He would discover the
  note, find that Gordon had come to his rooms, and ascertain the disappearance
  of the shawl. He would know the game was up, and, worse still, would have
  time to get clear away. Gordon tried to banish the supposition; he dared not
  face it, the mere utterance of it seeming to accuse him of a breach of trust.
  None the less, however, it clung to his back and thrashed him into an aimless
  activity. He descended the ridge towards Wastdale in hot haste. There, to add
  to his dismay, he beheld a mist floating quickly up the valleys in tongues of
  smoke, and he knew that the moment it swept across Mickledoor, adding its
  thick confusion to the increasing gloom, his chances of discovering Hawke,
  even if he, came that way, were practically destroyed. He turned on his steps
  in a panic and raced back to the top of the ridge. The same stagnant silence
  enveloped it. There was not even a stir of the wind. Looking back, he saw the
  mist was already licking the boulders at the bottom of the steep incline. It
  would pour over the gap in a minute, he thought, and, without stopping to
  reason, he ran down the slope from it on the Eskdale side. It occurred to
  him, upon subsequent thought, that this action was the most ill-advised he
  could have adopted, for the gap on both sides widens rapidly from its summit.
  Had he calculated chances with any approach to accuracy, he would have
  remained where he was on the apex and narrowest part of the ridge. And yet to
  this mistake he owed the completion of his design. For he kept close to
  Scafell as he went and he had not moved many yards when he heard right above
  his head the metallic clink of an ice-axe. He was standing by a narrow cleft
  in the rocks known as "the Chimney," which, for a climber, affords an issue
  on to the actual summit of Scafell. Hawke, then, was crossing the mountain
  itself. The sound told Gordon that he was as yet not far up the side. He must
  have entered the cleft after Gordon's arrival, and while the latter was on
  the farther side of the ridge.</p>

  <p>Gordon wondered how it was that he had not originally noticed his
  approach. At that moment the mist swept over Mickledoor, and a plan shaped
  itself in his mind. Parallel to the chimney, but some yards to the west of
  it, the cliffs offer a simpler route, called "Broad Stand," and after a
  certain height is attained by that way, a man may reach by an easy traverse a
  spot where Hawke must leave his gully and climb out on to the face of the
  rock. This latter man&oelig;uvre is always attended with a certain
  difficulty, since the walls of the gully afford no foothold and give only on
  to a shelving slab. Gordon, therefore, had little fear that Hawke would
  outstrip him, and determined to join him by way of Broad Stand. So he turned
  back once more and reascended the incline, treading cautiously and feeling
  along the mountain as he went, lest in the darkness he should pass the point
  at which the climb began. After proceeding in this manner for about a minute,
  he came to a narrow vertical slit in the rock, which was just discernible. It
  was the spot of which he was in search, and he entered it, appearing to be
  swallowed up in the cliff, A walk of a few yards brought him to some huge
  blocks piled one above another, and shaped in pyramidal steps. These formed
  the pathway of his ascent. They present no great difficulty as a rule, but
  now they were coated with a thin glaze of ice, and as Gordon had brought no
  axe with him, purposely, in order to sustain the supposition that he had
  spent the afternoon in crossing the Styhead Pass towards Rosthwaite, he was
  compelled at each step that he took to clear out the next footing above, with
  the sole aid of his numbed fingers. Consequently he made his way but slowly.
  An overpowering dread that his enemy might escape while he was yet struggling
  below the traverse began to creep over him and strung his nerves to more
  strenuous efforts. His hatred, tantalised by the possibility, took a renewed
  life and sent the blood spinning through his veins like fire. He forgot the
  cold in his limbs, and the ice on the rocks, and clambered up in a reckless
  fury.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the mist was thickening continually, and by the time Gordon had
  completed his ascent and reached the point from which he had to diverge along
  the cliff's face, the night had fallen pitch-dark. He stood still for a
  moment, with his head bent forward, listening eagerly for a sound. Was he too
  late? Then he heard the scrabbling of boot-nails upon the slab, and a minute
  after the stamping of feet a few yards away to his left. The noise drove all
  his thoughts of averting suspicion from his mind. The mere knowledge that his
  enemy was there filled him; a cry of exultation rose up to his lips and he
  barely checked it, and crept silently forwards. A thin buttress of rock ran
  down shoulder-high between the two men, and this Gordon had forgotten. He
  came upon it unawares as he was moving with outstretched hands, and,
  understanding that he had traversed the space diagonally instead of in a
  direct line, he descended a little to round it. As he was doing this he heard
  the spirt of a match. There was not a breath of wind, and the tiny flame
  burnt steadily, throwing out a brown light upon the mirky gloom. To Gordon it
  seemed blood-red. He paused and waited for the match to blow out. Instead of
  that, however, it grew brighter, and he remembered that Hawke carried a
  lanthorn. For a second he was staggered as by an unexpected blow, and stood
  thinking. Then he continued his stealthy descent to the end of the buttress.
  As he turned the corner he drew his knife and crouched like an animal. Hawke
  was some fifteen feet away, kneeling on the ground by the light and fumbling
  a small bottle clumsily in his frozen hands. Gordon measured the intervening
  space with his eye, and chose the point between Hawke's shoulders, where he
  meant to strike, gently swaying his body to and fro the while in preparation
  for a spring. As he threw his weight backwards, however, for the last time,
  his heel slipped on a loose stone and sent it echoing behind him down the
  crags.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" cried Hawke, lifting the lanthorn and standing upright.</p>

  <p>Gordon stepped forward on the instant, slipping his knife with its open
  blade into his pocket, and the flame of the lanthorn encircled them both in a
  little ring of light.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You!" cried Hawke.</p>

  <p>The wall of the rock made a right angle behind him, and he backed into the
  corner of it, fronting Gordon with the lanthorn held aloft between them.
  There was a ring of terror in his voice, and his eyes glanced rapidly round
  with a hunted look.</p>

  <p>Gordon saw the look and smiled; for the little platform on which they
  stood was open only upon two sides, of which the gully guarded one and
  himself the other.</p>

  <p>He did not answer Hawke's exclamation at once, for the sudden check had
  aroused him to the need of wariness. A struggle had to be avoided at all
  costs, he thought; for it would land them both, locked together, on the
  screes below. It was very pleasant to him, besides, to watch the shrinking
  fear visible in his enemy's attitude. The very lanthorn was rattling in his
  unsteady grasp, and the sound of it was music to Gordon's ears.</p>

  <p>"You did not expect to see me, did you, Austen?" he said at last, purring
  the words.</p>

  <p>"You did rather startle me, I own. You came along so quietly."</p>

  <p>"One needs to be careful when it is as dark as this. As it was, I lost my
  way. If you had not lit that lanthorn I should have been over the cliffs. I
  may thank you for my life," and Gordon laughed cheerfully.</p>

  <p>His words and the familiarity of his voice helped Hawke back to some
  portion of his confidence. But he still held the lanthorn above their
  heads.</p>

  <p>During these last days he had lived in a constant dread of detection,
  Gordon's unforeseen visit to the dale wearing to him almost the appearance of
  a fatality. He cursed the infatuation which had led him to summon Kate
  Nugent, and each fresh sight of the man he had wronged awakened in him a
  shudder of alarm. It is true that he had voluntarily sought Gordon's company
  at the farm-house the night before and again this morning. But the
  inconsistency of the proceeding was purely on the surface. He had felt
  compelled to that course by the urgency of his dread, which shook him chiefly
  when alone. And it was the effect of these solitary cogitations which
  produced his inexpressible terror on each occasion that he met the man. Once
  in his presence, however, the feeling wore off. He had always been accustomed
  to regard Gordon somewhat contemptuously in the light of an unpractical
  dreamer, and as he listened to his voice and watched his gestures, this habit
  reasserted itself from an association of ideas. He came to the conclusion
  that there were no grounds for his fears, crediting Gordon with no great
  powers of self-repression.</p>

  <p>Viewed generally, this latter judgment of Hawke's was correct. The fatal
  mistake, however, which he committed was to make no allowance for a possible
  concentration of his entire faculties upon a single aim, under the influence
  of an overmastering passion, such as the lust for revenge which absorbed
  Gordon now.</p>

  <p>On this particular occasion, however, Hawke had been more than usually
  startled. He had intended to leave Wastdale Head early the next morning, and
  had planned this expedition in order to avoid meeting Gordon again&mdash;nay,
  more, had actually given him a false description of his route. Consequently
  his sudden appearance from the surrounding darkness and the silence of his
  approach had intensified his feeling of alarm and betrayed it unmistakably to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"You have made the circuit quickly," Gordon resumed.</p>

  <p>"I gave up the idea of Eskdale when the sky clouded," Hawke replied, "and
  came straight across from the Pillar."</p>

  <p>"I wonder we did not meet before."</p>

  <p>Gordon was speaking at random, watching keenly for a chance; but Hawke
  still faced him, with his back to the rock.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I have been on the mountain for some time. You have only just come, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"I came with the mist."</p>

  <p>"It's a poor companion," Hawke resumed. "I found rather a good glissade
  just behind these cliffs running into Eskdale. I spent most of the afternoon
  on that. You ought to try it."</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>"It lands you out close to Mickledoor and not far below the chimney. So I
  thought I would go home this way. But if I had known it was going to grow as
  cold and dark as this I would have seen myself damned first."</p>

  <p>"It is cold," Gordon assented, although his senses gave him no knowledge
  of the fact. He was wondering whether Hawke would ever move. If only he would
  set the lanthorn down!</p>

  <p>"Suppose that we move," he went on. "You have got the lanthorn, so you had
  better go first."</p>

  <p>He drew to one side as he spoke, and made room for Hawke to pass. But at
  the very moment that he was taking the step, Hawke suddenly placed the
  lanthorn on the ground, and cried&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment!"</p>

  <p>The next instant he stood upright, and that opportunity was gone.</p>

  <p>"I have got a bottle of brandy here," said Hawke. "We had better open it.
  Has your knife got a corkscrew?"</p>

  <p>Gordon thrust his hand quickly into his pocket and felt the sharp blade
  cut into his flesh. But he drew his hand out again empty, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I haven't got a knife at all. I left mine at home."</p>

  <p>"We must use mine, then, and knock the neck off. They have jammed the cork
  in so tightly, that there is no other way. Here! hold the bottle."</p>

  <p>Hawke handed him the bottle and searched in his pocket for his knife. He
  was perfectly defenceless at the moment, but the memory of Arkwright's
  accident had suddenly flashed upon Gordon and suggested to him a safer
  plan.</p>

  <p>He added another item to his supposed new knowledge. He understood now, he
  fancied, why the recollection of that night in the Alps had so persistently
  mingled with his thoughts yesterday, and he laughed gleefully.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" Hawke asked. "You seem pleased."</p>

  <p>"I am," he replied. "It is the brandy warming me through the cork."</p>

  <p>Hawke laughed. "It wasn't a bad suggestion, was it?"</p>

  <p>"It was the best I ever heard from you."</p>

  <p>Hawke found his knife and held it out to Gordon, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You had better do it! My fingers are so cursedly numbed, I should only
  cut myself or drop the bottle."</p>

  <p>Gordon took the knife with his right hand, and Hawke exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What on earth have you done to your hand? It is covered with blood."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's nothing," Gordon answered quickly. "I cut it on a pointed piece
  of rock, that's all."</p>

  <p>For a moment he stood with the bottle poised in one hand and the knife in
  the other, thinking. Then he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Just take this while I open the blade," and he handed the bottle
  back.</p>

  <p>"The handle will serve," said Hawke.</p>

  <p>"The blade will do it cleaner."</p>

  <p>Hawke took the bottle back while Gordon opened the knife. It was of a
  strong and heavy make, with a long, powerful blade. Gordon ran his thumb
  along the edge and found it sharp and even.</p>

  <p>"Now if you will hold the bottle out," he said, "I will operate. Not that
  way! We shall spill it all;" and he readjusted the bottle in Hawke's hands,
  settling the base in his upturned palms, with the cork pointing towards
  himself.</p>

  <p>"That's right," he said, and struck the neck on the side nearest to Hawke,
  slipped the blade on the glass, and drove it with all his force down into his
  left arm where it showed white below his sleeve.</p>

  <p>The bottle crashed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Hawke reeled against the rock wall behind him, clutching the injured wrist
  with his disengaged hand.</p>

  <p>"God!" he shrieked. "It's an artery."</p>

  <p>Gordon could see the blood spurting in quick jets, and said,
  quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It reminds me of Arkwright. That was an accident, too."</p>

  <p>"Don't stand there, man&mdash;dreaming! Do something!"</p>

  <p>Gordon laughed at the words&mdash;a low, happy laugh, which struck a new
  horror into Hawke.</p>

  <p>"You meant to do it?"</p>

  <p>Gordon nodded to him, knowingly.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" Hawke hissed and sunk down upon the platform beside the
  lanthorn, concentrating all his strength into the oath. He was still vainly
  endeavouring to stop the bursts from the vein by the pressure of his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Gordon knelt by his side.</p>

  <p>"Let me look," he said.</p>

  <p>Hawke dragged himself a few inches farther away, with an inarticulate
  snarl, and turned his back.</p>

  <p>"Won't you let me help you?" Gordon asked, in a tone of gentle
  remonstrance.</p>

  <p>The other shot a quick glance across his shoulder, and replied, with a
  beaten air&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I could believe it was myself said that."</p>

  <p>"But I mean it. There's the difference. Won't you let me bind up your
  arm?"</p>

  <p>Hawke looked at him again and rolled over to face him, his eyes alive with
  hope.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you will," he said. "But be quick! quick! Use my scarf! Only be
  quick!"</p>

  <p>Something in his manner recalled vividly to Gordon Kate's appeal to Hawke
  of the night before; but he unwound the scarf from the neck of the wounded
  man. The latter could not repress a convulsive shiver as he felt the touch of
  his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Gordon apologised. "I know it must be unpleasant."</p>

  <p>The scarf was of thick white wool, and he twisted it round the arm just
  above the cut and tied it firmly; but a dark stain came through it at once
  and widened over the folds.</p>

  <p>"The ice-axe," gasped Hawke. "It is by your side."</p>

  <p>Gordon took it from where it was resting on the ground, and inserting the
  pick into the wool, used it as a tourniquet, and strained the bandage
  tight.</p>

  <p>"Thanks! thanks!" murmured Hawke. "That will hold. Give me the pole of the
  axe. Now run down to the Inn and get help. I may be able to last out&mdash;if
  only I don't freeze to death," he added, with a moan.</p>

  <p>"It is a pity the brandy's spilt."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that! Hurry down to the Inn."</p>

  <p>"No! no! Austen," Gordon replied, indulgently, much as one refuses a child
  an impossible request. "I don't think I can do that."</p>

  <p>Hawke raised himself upon his right elbow and peered into the other's
  face. Neither of them spoke, but the animation flickered out of Hawke's
  features, and it seemed as if a veil were drawn across the pupils of his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You have murdered me," he said, sinking back and letting his head fall
  sideways on the ground.</p>

  <p>"I have waked up. You said I was dreaming. I have waked up, that's all. It
  is not the sleeper's fault if he hits the man who wakes him."</p>

  <p>Gordon bent over as he spoke, and shot the words into Hawke's ear with a
  savage intensity. In a moment, however, he resumed his former composure.</p>

  <p>"But we are wasting time, and we have not much time to waste, have we? I
  want three letters."</p>

  <p>Hawke dropped the pole of the axe and instinctively moved his right hand
  to protect his breast-pocket.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Gordon. "I only wanted to know whether you had them with
  you. I felt sure you would have, but it was best to make certain. Don't worry
  about them now. I will take them&mdash;afterwards."</p>

  <p>He laid the slightest possible stress upon the word, and
  continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The shawl is safe enough, too. I am carrying it now. I thought you would
  like to know that. Is there anything more? Oh, yes! You have taught me a
  lesson&mdash;never to conduct interviews at night with the blind up and the
  window open."</p>

  <p>"Then you&mdash;you were outside?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! I was outside," cried Gordon, his savage fury boiling over its
  barriers and sweeping him away on a full flow.</p>

  <p>"The fool was asleep, was he? The fool was on the outhouse staring into
  your face. Who was the fool, eh? Did you think I was blind? Did you think I
  didn't see you were frightened when I met you yesterday! Did you think I
  didn't see you watching my bedroom from the barn? What made you come back and
  turn my lamp out? Who was the fool, eh? Why, but for you I should never have
  known, never have suspected, never have killed you."</p>

  <p>His voice had risen to a scream, and he thrust his face into Hawke's,
  livid with hate. A sudden access of passion stung the latter into life; he
  pushed the face away from him and gathering all his strength, half struggled
  to his feet. On the instant Gordon slipped the steel point of the axe from
  the bandage round his arm and Hawke fell back, fainting and sick.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" he whispered, "and the girl, too!"</p>

  <p>Gordon uttered a cry, and dying though the man was, struck him on the
  mouth with his clenched fist.</p>

  <p>Hawke took the blow without a moan, fixed one steady look upon the other,
  and then let his head fall back upon the rock.</p>

  <p>After that neither spoke.</p>

  <p>A feeling of horror at this last action swept over Gordon. He reproached
  himself for the blow, and sought to replace the axe in the scarf. His
  fingers, however, were now too numbed; so he clenched them tightly round the
  arm and knelt there watching the blanching face and feeling the blood soak
  about his knees. In a moment or two he saw Hawke's eyeballs quiver under the
  half-closed lids and he leaned across the body and blew out the
  lanthorn-light. The darkness rushed down between them, and almost immediately
  the storm broke in a pitiless shower of hail.</p>

  <p>After awhile it passed, and Gordon bethought him of the time, but he was
  now so starved by the cold that at first he was powerless to unclasp his
  hands. The feeling of utter helplessness threw him into an agony. He fancied
  that his hands were dead&mdash;dead hands frozen round the dead man's wrist
  with blood. He looked forward in his mind through the black hours of the
  night and saw the morning pour down the mountain side and touch the grey face
  by his knees&mdash;nay, more, bring the dalesmen up to discover him riveted
  to the man he had killed. With this last thought he summoned all his strength
  to his aid, and making a final effort wrenched his hands free. The body was
  lying motionless at his side, and he felt along it until he reached the
  breast. To take the letters, however, he had to unbutton the coat, and he
  paused, shrinking from that. In the end he mustered courage for the task,
  rebuttoned the coat, and groped his way cautiously to the summit, the rest of
  the ascent being no more than a rock-strewn slope. From there his path was
  easy, and although a high wind was now blowing, he descended rapidly.
  Half-way down he struck a glissade which rare winters of great snow form
  along an old stone wall, and so slid out of the mist.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The glissade stretched down towards a beck which flows
  between Lingmell and the flank of Scafell. So that when Gordon stopped at the
  end of the snow, a tinkling of water, as it splashed from stone to stone,
  rose to his ears, and there seemed to him something strangely sweet and
  peaceful in the sound. He advanced to its edge and washed carefully in the
  stream. Then he took his haversack from his shoulders and opened it. Kate
  Nugent's shawl was the first thing which his fingers touched, and the feel of
  it sent a shiver through his frame. It reminded him too clearly of Hawke's
  scarf and the black stain widening over it. He took it out, and after it, a
  parcel. For a moment he wondered what that was, and then remembered that he
  had forgotten to eat his lunch. He repaired the omission on the instant, and
  proceeded to change his clothes.</p>

  <p>That done, he sat down upon a stone, and went over carefully all that had
  occurred. Reflection showed him no opening for suspicion to arise, either
  from the deed itself or its attendant circumstances. Against the latter he
  had already guarded, while the broken fragments of glass, the presence of
  Hawke's own knife open by the side of the body, and even the scarf about his
  arm, which hung loose and clumsily after the ice-axe had been removed, would
  all point to the one conclusion&mdash; that the wound was an accident and
  self-inflicted. Satisfied upon the point, Gordon picked up the clothes which
  he had discarded, wrapped them in the shawl, and continued his descent. At
  the bottom of the valley, however, instead of turning to the right in the
  direction of Wastdale Head, he bent away towards the Lake.</p>

  <p>The strong wind, blowing up from the sea, had cleared the mist above his
  head and was chasing the clouds along the sky. Here and there a star could be
  seen winking from a blue gap, and so Gordon was able to distinguish when he
  reached the shore, that no loiterer was near to spy upon his acts. He felt in
  the pockets of the coat he was carrying and drew out the letters which he had
  taken from Hawke. Then he fastened the bundle securely about the biggest
  stone he could find and hurled it far out into the Lake. It sank with a loud
  splash, and Gordon looked quickly round thinking that some one must have
  noticed it. The only sound that he heard, however, was the wash of the
  ripples on the bank, and he turned and made hastily up the valley, across the
  fields, until he had left the village some hundreds of yards behind. From
  there he crossed into the path which leads down from Styhead, and finally
  reached the farmhouse. It was close upon half-past eight, he noticed, when he
  entered the parlour. He explained his lateness to Mrs. Jackson by saying that
  he had taken refuge from the storm. She added, indulgently, that it was a
  long way to Rosthwaite.</p>

  <p>"Oh I did not get as far after all," said he. "Has not Mr. Hawke come
  yet?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hawke?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! I never told you. I asked him, or rather left a note to that effect,
  to come up to dinner this evening. I ought to have told you, but the fact is
  I never thought of inviting him until I had left the house."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jackson disclaimed all responsibility for the dinner, and had not set
  eyes on Mr. Hawke.</p>

  <p>"Then I won't wait for him," said Gordon. "Bring the dinner in! I will
  just go up and wash."</p>

  <p>"And change your clothes."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any clothes to change into," he said, with a laugh. "You might
  lay another plate," he added. "Mr. Hawke may appear yet."</p>

  <p>So Gordon dined, and opposite to him a place was laid for the man who was
  lying dead on Scafell.</p>

  <p>The one thing which troubled Gordon was the recollection of the blow he
  had struck with his fist. He despised himself for that; and besides, the look
  with which Hawke had returned it somehow remained fixed in his mind. Strive
  as he might, he could not banish it. Everything else he had intended, and
  justice had dictated. But that blow!</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock the Inn people sent up to inquire for their lodger. They
  had not imagined anything amiss before, as they understood from Lawson that
  Hawke meant to stay late upon the fells.</p>

  <p>"He said he was going to the Pillar," Gordon said, "and he went up
  Mosedale in that direction."</p>

  <p>One dalesman, however, asserted that he passed Hawke not later than one in
  the afternoon by the church in the centre of the valley. He was then going
  towards Scafell.</p>

  <p>Finally two search parties were organised&mdash;one to proceed to the
  Pillar Rock, the other to examine the cliffs of Scafell. Gordon elected to
  join the former, and they separately started off, with much narrating of past
  accidents to cheer them on their way.</p>

  <p>"Ten men have I brought down from these mountains, stone dead," said one,
  "and this will be the eleventh."</p>

  <p>He repeated his lugubrious statement so often, that Gordon found himself
  in the end humming the words to the cadence of his steps.</p>

  <p>They reached the Rock at last, and this mockery of a search began and was
  kept up all through the freezing night. In the grey of the morning they came
  down the path again. A man was running towards them with the news that the
  body had been found, and he led them up to the cliffs on Scafell. Gordon
  stood by Hawke's side for a moment, as he lay stretched out in a frozen pool
  of blood, and then turned away sick; for he had noticed about the corners of
  his mouth a faint blue mark, like a bruise.</p>

  <p>"You will carry him down," he said. "I will follow you."</p>

  <p>The men understood his feelings, or rather thought they did, and lifted
  the body gently and bore it down to the village. On the way they passed the
  glissade on the side of the mountain, and one of them stopped and pointed to
  the groove in the snow where Gordon had descended.</p>

  <p>But he only said, "He will never come down that slide again, poor
  chap!"</p>

  <p>Gordon watched them until they had disappeared round a headland, and then
  turned and looked down the crags.</p>

  <p>"Not there!" he muttered to himself, with a shudder, and crossed over the
  mountain top down to the screes. He stopped in front of a steep, narrow
  gully, and far down he could see the quiet waters of the Lake lapping the
  base of it. He cast one look towards Wastdale. Eastwards the sun was rising
  over the Pass; "from Keswick," he thought. He took out of his pocket the
  three letters and handled them, and his eyes fell upon the signature.</p><br>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3><br>

  <p>Two days afterwards he was found by a fisherman at the bottom of the
  gully, caught by a boulder on the water's edge. One hand was trailing in the
  water and it clenched a torn scrap of sodden paper.</p>
