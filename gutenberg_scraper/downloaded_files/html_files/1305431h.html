<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>During some 20 years after the disappearance of Leichhardt's
party in their 1848 attempt to overland to the Swan River, a
number of search expeditions were mounted to look for traces of
the party and to attempt to determine Leichhardt's fate.</p>
<p>Here are collected the original records of these focussed
expeditions, together with other contemporary material regarding
Leichhardt and his thinking around that time. This is not
intended as an <i>exhaustive</i> compilation of all material
bearing on the search for information on Leichhardt's fate;
rather, it is a gathering of the major accessible materials.
While none of the expeditions answered the ultimate question,
they all took place at a time when the trail was still
(relatively) "warm".</p>
<p>The websites external to Project Gutenberg Australia referred
to here are likewise <i>not</i> intended as a comprehensive
list.</p>
<p>The cut-off date for this collection is taken as the finding
of the gun nameplate.</p>

<h3><span class="a">Introduction</span></h3>
<br>
<p>About a year after completing his first, lauded, expedition to
Port Essington, N.T., Ludwig Leichhardt's first attempt to
journey overland to the Swan River left the Darling Downs
(December 1846). The expedition proved abortive. The party
arrived at the Peak Range, near Emerald (Qld.), by early May,
1847. By that stage, many of them had become seriously ill;
Leichhardt decided after a month to abandon the expedition and
return to the Darling Downs.</p>
<p>Soon after, he learnt of the progress and recent discoveries
of Sir Thomas Mitchell and his deputy, Edmund Kennedy, and made a
short journey west (his third expedition), to the Maranoa river
and Fitzroy Downs.</p>
<p>Leichhardt then returned to Sydney to organise his last
expedition, to try to achieve what he had set out to do on his
second. About this time, he wrote two interesting letters to his
brother-in-law (1.1, 1.2). He recruited a largely new and smaller
party (there had been nine members of the second expedition). The
party consisted of a relative, Augustus Classen; Arthur Hentig, a
local overseer (also German); two local station workers, Donald
Stuart and Mr. Kelly; rounded out with his loyal aboriginal,
Wommai (who, with Leichhardt, were the only members of the second
expedition), and Billy, another aboriginal man. Leichhardt chose
not to take Daniel Bunce, who had been on both the second and
third expeditions.</p>
<p>This fourth expedition party left Macpherson's Station on the
Darling Downs in early April, 1848 (1.3), heading north-west,
destination Swan River, and was not heard from again.</p>
<p>Over the next twenty years, three expeditions were mounted
specifically to search for traces the Leichhardt party:</p>
<p class="indent">* Hovenden Hely's, 1852 (2.; Hely was a member
of Leichhardt's second expedition);</p>
<p class="indent">* Augustus Gregory's, 1858 (4.); and</p>
<p class="indent">* Duncan McIntyre's, 1865-6 (6.).</p>
<p>Some of these search parties found several marked trees but
produced few other tangible or definitive results.</p>
<p>Shortly after the outcome of Augustus Gregory's search was
known, Leichhardt's firm friend, Rev. W.B. Clarke, critiqued the
search expeditions to date in detailed letters, to both the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> (5.1-5.5) and the Royal Geographical
Society of London (5.6). Leichhardt had shared his plans for Swan
River with Clarke after returning from his Maranoa expedition,
the journal of which Clarke published about a year after his
letters to the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<p>In addition to these three specific search expeditions, three
others of relevance were mounted between 1855 and 1870, the third
given specific instructions to stay alert for any traces of
Leichhardt; these were:</p>
<p class="indent">* The Gregory Brothers' North Australian
expedition of 1855-6. (3.);</p>
<p class="indent">* Frederick Walker's "Victorian Relief
Expedition", searching for Burke and Wills toward the end of
1861. (6.); and</p>
<p class="indent">* John Forrest's first expedition, east from
Perth in 1869. (8.)</p>
<p>Of these, only Walker found any traces of Leichhardt's trail,
around 145°E, 22°S. Apart from these three, other parties may
possibly have crossed Leichhardt's path; for example, John
McDouall Stuart. Few records of pertinent observations
remain.</p>
<p>About 1900, a burnt firearm with a nameplate marked
"<span class="u">LUDWIG LEICHHARDT 1848</span>" was discovered by
an Aboriginal man, known as 'Jackie', in a boab tree near Sturt
Creek, between the Tanami and Great Sandy Deserts.</p>
<p>The Gregory map of the Sturt Creek region, from their 1855-6
expedition, is located at the end of the work, to give some idea
of the geography of the region where the nameplate was found.
Note that Gregory found no traces of Leichhardt in this area in
1856.</p>
<p>Apart from a number of private letters, the accounts of the
listed expeditions cover the bulk of the information unearthed
during the 19th century about the fate of Leichhardt and his
party.</p>
<p>The University of Goettingen has a very comprehensive site
about the personal side of Leichhardt; such information may be
sourced <a href=
"http://leichhardt.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.html.en">here.</a></p>
<p>Full accounts of the extensive explorations of the Gregorys,
McDouall Stuart and the Forrests are all found at the Project
Gutenberg Australia website. They have not been duplicated
here.</p>

<h3>1. <span class="a">"Leichhardt's Last Letters"</span></h3>
<h4>1.1. Letter of 20 October, 1847</h4>
<p align="center">THE LAST LETTERS WRITTEN BY LEICHARDT.[sic]</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>In accordance with our promise made a few days ago we now
present our readers with a translation of some interesting
letters of Leichardt to his relatives in Germany, written during
the summer of 1847-48. The first has reference chiefly to the
unsuccessful expedition, or rather the unsuccessful start which
he made previous to his final departure. It records in a manner
which is now almost painful to reflect on the many difficulties
he encountered and the disappointments he experienced; while, on
the other side, the noble ambition which animated him appears
equally affecting. It is a matter of regret that very few details
of his early life are obtainable. He was born in the small
village of Betskow, near Berlin, where his father was a
clergyman. After the usual course of education at the Volkschule
and the Gymnasium he studied medicine at the Berlin University.
The passion for scientific exploration, which Humboldt awakened
among his countrymen, manifested itself in Leichardt at a very
early age. He went to London as soon as he had completed his
studies, not even waiting to perform the three years' military
service which is incumbent on all Prussian citizens on pain of
outlawry, and other still more disagreeable consequences.
Afterwards, when he had proved that he could be as useful to his
country on a foreign shore as in the Betskow Infantry, a royal
dispensation was granted him, otherwise he could not have
returned to his native land without danger of imprisonment as an
incipient traitor. In London he found encouragement and
assistance in his designs, especially from a gentleman who is
referred to in one of the following letters. This gentleman gave
him the means of preceeding to Australia, where his persevering
and enthusiastic devotion to science gained for him the
reputation with which all of us are familiar, and perhaps also a
fate which we shudder to think of.</p>
<p>It is only courteous to repeat here that the originals have
been furnished to us by Dr. Schomburgk, who received them from
his brother in Berlin. They were given to the latter by Alex. Von
Humboldt, the distinguished naturalist, who obtained them from
Leichardt's family. The first letter is in two parts written at
different times. At present we shall only have space to give the
first of these:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right">"Sydney. October 20, 1847.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Dear Brother-in-Law&mdash;Here I am back again from a
journey of discovery, not in the glow of success, with flags
waving and a nation's applause resounding in my ears, but
exhausted with illness, and my companions each more dissatisfied
than the other. In order to lead them back to the fleshpots of
Egypt, I found myself obliged to return before I had even entered
the unexplored country. The causes of this failure may he
described as follows:&mdash;In the first place the young men I
had with me were not experienced bushmen. They belonged to
Sydney, and had been accustomed to the easy effeminate style of
city life. Their constitutions wanted that elasticity which would
have enabled them when overtaken by illness to recover fast, and
their minds were unfit to take a contented self-adapting view of
circumstances; in short, they could not confine their attention
to the present but were always looking back to the pleasures and
comforts they had left behind them in Sydney. Their whole
interest in the undertaking was pecuniary and selfish. They
expected that at the return of the expedition they would be
rewarded with Government appointments and public money. Having
witnessed our reception in Sydney on our return from Port
Essington they thought to win similar laurels, overlooking,
however, the difficulties that lay in the way. Once started on
the journey when the difficulties commenced, their firmness was
suddenly shaken. Instead of remembering their former professions
of gratitude to me for taking them with me, they began to regard
me as a hard taskmaster, and to distrust me as if I wished to
take an unfair advantage of them. In my first expedition I had
only oxen with me, which we used for the transport of stores, and
slaughtered one by one as we required them for consumption. From
the very first we limited ourselves in our daily rations, and
lived for the most part on dried beef. The consequence was that
we soon acquired a first rate appetite and a sound digestion. On
this last expedition, however, we had mules for transport, and
cattle besides for consumption&mdash; 38 oxen, 290 goats, and 108
sheep. We began with the sheep, killing one almost every day.
They were in splendid condition, but one sufficient for only nine
men. We had but little bread and no vegetables to counterbalance
this large amount of animal food. Very frequently our healths got
deranged, and our bodies became peculiarly susceptible to
disease. This evil was aggravated when the rainy season came on,
and we had to cross swollen rivers, marching for hours in damp
clothes, and sleeping night after night on the damp ground. At
length one of the overflooded streams brought us to a standstill,
and as there was no alternative but to cross it we had to remain
for three weeks on this side before we could do so. The past
season has been extremely wet throughout the whole colony, and
the "three days' fever" has broken out in places where it had
never before Mackenzie this fever had so weakened the party that
we had to camp three weeks longer on the other side. Even then it
was only by sheer force I could get the party to advance, and in
this way we proceeded 70 miles further. Then the growing
discontentment of my comrades broke out openly. They would not
undergo the least exertion or risk to assist me or my blacks.
What little they did was done badly; and altogether they were
more of a hindrance than a help to us. To complete my misfortunes
the goats went astray, then the few remaining oxen, and lastly
some of the mules and horses. Our only hope of escape was a
speedy return. Hitherto I had not suffered much from ill health,
but now I was seized in all my joints-fingers, arms, back, and
knees&mdash;with the most dreadful rheumatism, which rendered me
so helpless that I could neither mount nor dismount from my
horse. On reaching Mr. Russell's station at Darling Downs, I
remained there a fortnight to recruit after which I felt
sufficiently strong for another journey of five or six hundred
miles, which I wished to undertake in order to determine the
course of the Condamine, and generally to investigate the
district intervening between my previous explorations and Sir
Thomas Mitchell's. I accomplished this journey in about six
weeks, and in the process effectually rid myself of rheumatism,
by exposing the affected parts to the scorching influence of an
Australian sun, which acted like a blister. Then I hastened back
to Sydney to make preparations for a new expedition. Before I
left Darling Downs, I had the pleasure to hear of five of my
mules having found their way back to the settled districts. This
will be a considerable saving to me. It will cost at least £200
to equip a fresh expedition. My original outlay for the last was
about £650, so I shall have to be altogether £850 out of pocket.
In Germany that would be thought a great deal of money, and even
here it is a very nice sum; but <i>I live, I exist alone in this
undertaking, and leave God to provide for the future</i>. In your
welcome letter you give me some very good advice: but I cannot
follow it for it goes against my nature and my ambition. I am
urged on by an irresistible impulse to study the physical
character of this country, and solve if possible its enigmas. To
a man of science it presents a vast and beautiful field of
research. Had I the right sort of companions I could wander
through the Australian wilds happy as the son of an Irish king:
but to find such is extremely difficult Most of those who offer
themselves to me are young men of unsound constitutions and loose
habits, who are reduced to a last shift for a livelihood. The
members of my first expedition were, with two exceptions, all
boys, so that I was able to enforce obedience and order amongst
them. In my next I shall have with me Mr. [C]lasse[n], a well
educated young man from Hamburg, who, during 12 years of travel
in all quarters or the globe, has undergone numerous hardships,
and thus qualified himself for work like mine.</p>
<p>"My friendly host, Mr. Lind, is under orders for New Zealand,
the doings of the natives there having rendered additional
soldiers necessary. Therefore I must look out for another home.
For myself I can find a hospitable roof anywhere, but I require
besides a safe place for my continually increasing
collections&mdash;a place where they will not only be protected
from the weather, but where I can have convenient access to them
when I have leisure to study.</p>
<p>"I long to see once more my dear mother, and you all; but
there is no hope of that till I have wandered through and through
this great continent which probably will not be in less than two
or three years. I suppose I shall hardly recognise Germany again,
the railways will have so completely altered its character and
appearance. What think you are men coming to? To what will such
discoveries as that of chloroform lead? will they rot transform
us into effeminate pain-dreading creatures, unable to bear
patiently the least suffering or privation? Then, should a wild,
warlike horde burst forth again from the East the age might
return when the corrupt enervated Roman was overthrown by the
energetic child of nature. A retrograde element is also
manifesting itself in our educational system. Everything is being
made easy and superficial. Whereas, in times past, one had to
split his head with reading and thinking, he now acquires
knowledge by a mere glance at a diagram, or a figure, or a
popular handbook. May not this be carried too far? Will not such
students naturally fear and shrink from serious study? A union of
the two would answer well, but the inherent indolence of man
inclines him to skip the difficult passages fast enough without
any artificial inducement."</p>

<h4>1.2 Letter of 21 October, 1847</h4>
<br>
<p align="center">THE LAST LETTERS WRITTEN BY LEICHARDT.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">(Continued from the <i>Register</i> of January
15.)<br>
No. 2.&mdash; <span class="a">To his Brother-in Law</span>.</p>
<p align="right">Sydney. October 21, 1847.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had hardly finished my last letter to you when Mr. Holt
called, with a boy at his heels, carrying an immense portfolio.
"I have received," said he, "this portfolio from a business
friend in the Cottbus, and the address will give you further
information about it." I looked at the address accordingly, and
saw on it your dear name. In half a minute I had the parcel open,
and was searching among newspapers and religious tracts for a
letter. By-and-by I hailed with delight your own writing, and a
portrait of my beloved mother. Unfortunately the glass of the
daguerreotype was broken, but the portrait was not much injured.
Mr. Link says the latter is very like myself; that I would only
need to shave my beard and put on a cap to become identical in
appearance.</p>
<p>But how shall I thank you for your friendly exertions in
procuring for me the royal pardon? * It is, I assure you, a very
comfortable thought to be at peace with one's Fatherland&mdash;to
be able, unhindered and unapprehensive, to return to it, and to
have before me the prospect of again seeing my friends, even if
fate on other grounds should not permit the wish to be realized.
To a freeman that little word "can" is the sweetest in the
language. The Cabinet order perfectly satisfies me; even the
conditional clause I accept It was necessary, of course, for His
Majesty to be self-consistent. What his Government deemed itself
obliged to refuse me when an unknown petitioner it cannot pant me
now simply because I have become known, for had the request been
right in its opinion it would nave been granted in the first
instance, for myself, I was not dissatisfied with the general
principle of military duty, but only that the Government did not
think it had the power in special cases to make exceptions
therefrom. When Mr. Nicholson ** left Berlin the question with me
was whether I could be of greater service to my country and to
science by getting thoroughly trained in the greatest Museums of
Europe, and then travelling as an explorer in remote parts of the
world, or by spending a year in military evolutions on the
"Kopeneker Feld" (exercise-ground near Berlin). The Government
decided for the latter; I for the former. I did wrong by
following my own inclinations and transgressing the law-that is,
the law as a dead inflexible power, which could not be modified
by the guiding hand of reason.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This refers to Leichardt having quitted
Prussia without fulfilling his term of military service. By so
doing he tendered himself an outlaw and liable to punishment if
ever afterwards found on Prussian soil. The context will show how
well he acted at this critical juncture of his life in
sacrificing himself to the letter of the law, in order, in a
nobler sense, to serve his country and science also.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** We presume Sir Charles Nicholson, the eminent
geographer, or one of the same family.]</p>
<p>But enough of this. Often have I talked myself over it into a
fury of excitement: and the English, I can assure you, were more
inclined to fan the flame than to check it. Then I have consoled
myself with the hope of once more belonging to the Fatherland.
Now that it is accomplished, there rises within me, in spite of
myself, a feeling of pride at my being indebted for my good
fortune to men whose achievements in science are to boyhood like
fairy tales, which fire youth with ambition, and at length
constrain it to follow in the same noble course. How often has
Count Puckler, in the eagle flight of his investigations, drawn
me after him and filled my breast with a longing towards those
higher regions through which he soared free and at ease, scanning
with keen glance all the heights lie passed, intuitively
apprehending the characteristic features of every country and
people lie visited, faithfully and attractively representing
them. And Humboldt? His example was and is continually before my
eyes. I strove after him, but felt always that my resources were
far too limited to emulate his achievements. I mean him, the
explorer of America&mdash;not the great contemplative
philos[o]pher who now turns to so important account the hoarded
experience of his youth.</p>
<p>In my explorations the great difficulty has been the length of
time and the distance to which I have been removed from the
settled districts of the colony and from all possible assistance.
At present I am obliged to limit to the utmost the number of my
party and the quantity of supplies. Much of the drudgery, and the
heaviest kind of it, too, I shall have to do myself. Our stinted
mode of life in a tropical climate, combined with our daily
exertions, causes great fatigue, especially to the feet When we
have finished our day's march, and pitched our camp for the
night, it often requires the greatest resolution to overcome this
fatigue so far as to enable me, to make scientific observations.
When away from the vicinity of rivers I am obliged often to ride
from 30 to 50 miles ahead of the party to look for water. On such
occasions my companions&mdash;excepting a black, who is my
constant and faithful attendant&mdash;remain in the camp. As I
have said before, it is extremely difficult to keep the party in
order and obedience. When they act openly it does not so much
matter; for them my procedure and motives are patent, and I am in
a position to convince the malcontents, or at least the others,
of their mistake. When, however, they act secretly and underhand,
then the whole camp gets perverted and my plans neutralized. This
circumstance I believe caused the failure of my hut expedition.
One <i>sauve qui peut</i> can shake the strongest resolutions,
and disorder the best laid schemes.</p>
<p>Your news of our family and of the great movements which have
taken place lately in the Church and State are to me extremely
interesting. It appears much is expected from the Prussian
Constitution. People here are curious to see how freedom will
develop itself in a nation which has hitherto been recognised as
the best educated in the world. How, they ask, will the feeling
of freedom manifest itself, and how will the Princes tolerate its
youthful excesses? The Prussian, it is true, is well educated,
but not politically. In respect of the latter he has yet to pass
through a severe school. Equitable representation of every
popular interest, calm discussion; clear, candid, straightforward
speech; an Executive which respects the opinions of the popular
representatives, and honestly gives effect to their well-matured,
well-balanced decisions: all working for the general good, and
not pandering to private interests&mdash;these are the fruits of
a plant which grows but slowly.</p>
<p>Many of the sermons you have sent me are extremely able, and
do honour to the German language as well as to their authors. But
why have you sent me nothing in the shape of German poetry? Have
all our bards gone to sleep, and has the present age found no
poetic expression worthy of itself? The thought has grown with
us&mdash;it is natural to us&mdash;that great times produce great
poets. As for these tunes in which we live I cannot help thinking
that they are specially important Since my return from my three
years' sojourn in the wilderness I have again perused Schiller's
poems. What noble, magnificent language is theirs! What an
intensity of feeling burnt in the soul of the great poet! Never
has music made so strong an impression upon me as one stormy
night, during my voyage from England to Sydney, when the sea
rushed and foamed beneath the keel of the ship as she glided
swiftly along. For a long time I had been listening to the vague
confused noise; then a sudden impulse took me into the cabin of
one of my fellow-passengers, Mr. Marsh, who was an exquisite
performer on the harp. As I entered he was playing a very
beautiful and pathetic fantasia, the harmonious tones of which,
after the wild discordant chorus of tho wind and waves, affected
me so powerfully and yet so agreeably that the tears rushed into
my eyes. Just such a feeling seized me again in reading Schiller;
and how vividly does the great poet himself describe it,
considering that he can never have known it by
experience&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Even as a child, that after pining<br>
For the sweet absent mother, hears<br>
Her voice, and round her neck entwining<br>
Young arms, vents all his soul in tears;<br>
So, by harsh custom far estranged,<br>
Along the glad and guileless track,<br>
To childhood's happy home unchanged,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prest<br>

&mdash;<i>Bulwer Lytton's Translation</i>.</p>
<p>As to the proposed publication of my letters I have simply to
observe that I rejoice, of course, at their being considered
worthy of such an honour, not alone by tho indulgent partiality
of friends, but in the opinion of competent unbiassed judges.</p>

<p align="center">NEWS FROM LEICHHARDT.</p>
<p><span class="a">We</span> had the pleasure yesterday of
receiving a letter from Dr. Leichhardt, containing an account of
his journey as far as Fitz Roy Downs, which we are sure will be
read with interest. It is not probable that any more will be
heard of the enterprising traveller until the middle of next
year. He and his party were all well, and in good health and
spirits:</p>
<p align="right">Sheep station at Mount
Abundance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
April 4th, 1848.</p>
<p>As it will be interesting to many of your readers to know a
little more about the country intervening between the last
station at the Condamine, belonging to Mr. Birell, and the
stations on Fitz Roy Downs, belonging to Mr. Macpherson, I take
the liberty of sending you the following short account of my
journey from Birell's to this place. I left Mr. Birell's the 23rd
March, and travelled twelve miles west by south, to make one of
my old camps on Dogwood Creek, in lat. 26.53. Having accomplished
so much, I continued for about three miles down Dogwood Creek,
which makes a considerable sweep to the northward. The 24th, I
continued about two miles down Dogwood Creek, crossed at a rather
boggy crossing place, and kept on westerly course for about six
miles, when I met a good sized creek, on which I encamped. We
passed some fine country, and the higher part of the creek was,
according to Mr. Hentig, very beautiful, consisting of sound very
open box ridges and undulations. I think that this creek is the
outlet of the Emu Creeks, which Mr. F. Isaacs is going to occupy.
The 25th, we travelled again to the westward for the first few
miles over a fine country, passed some bricklow scrub, which can
be skirted with a dray, crossed a chain of lagoons or
water-holes, entered again bricklow scrub, out of which we came
into the waters of Sandy Creek or the Gregor, as Mr. Archer and
Chauvel called the larger western branch of it. Even this scrub
can be avoided. We camped on the Gregor in lat 26.52. The 26th we
travelled about ten miles up the Gregor in a north-west by north
direction, and passed its junction with another creek from the
left, which keeps the name of Sandy Creek, which I had formerly
given to the joined creeks. Sandy Creek is without water, but the
Gregor is admirably supplied, and is rather larger in lat. 26.46
where I left it, than lower down. The country along its banks as
well as towards the next river to the westward is tolerably open,
but poor and sandy, and abounds in cypress pine. I am inclined to
believe that the Gregor will turn out to be my Robinson's Creek,
to which I came in lat. 25.30 on my former expeditions. The 27th
March we continued our journey about nine miles west-north-west,
and camped on Horsetrack River, in lat. about 26.43. We passed no
scrub, but as I mentioned before the country was open and poor.
The Horsetrack River had decreased in size much more than I
expected from what I had seen in lat. 27., about seventeen miles
more to the southward; but there I had met with scrub and nasty
broken country, which was wanting here. The 28th, we travelled
about sixteen or eighteen miles due west, and encamped on the
Yahoo River of my former trip. We passed three small creeks with
temporary water, and a tolerable open sound country&mdash;(box
forest, with a good deal of underwood, and some very fine
silver-leaved ironbark undulations); but at nine miles distance
we came into bricklow scrub, and had to pass a very heavy scrubby
sandstone ridge, from which we dropped again into bricklow scrub,
through which we travelled for five miles, when we came to a
small myal creek that led us down to the Yahoo River, the left
banks of which were fine and open. From Birell's to this ridge
and scrub a dray could pass without difficulty. Seventeen miles
lower down, a dray could pass easily between Horsetrack River and
the Yahoo River. It is consequently to be hoped that even near to
my present line a careful examination will discover good
openings. From the ridge we saw large plains surrounded with
scrub to the west-north-west. The 29th, we travelled scarcely two
and a half miles, through myal scrub, when we came to another
large creek, which no doubt is one of the branches of Yahoo
River. From this creek we continued for seven miles farther to
the west-north-west, over very fine but scrubby myal downs, and
encamped on a small creek with fine water holes, which I
considered to belong to Frederick's Creek of my former trip. The
myal downs were all connected with sound pebbly ground and most
richly provided with grass and herbage. The 30th March, we
travelled for about ten and a half miles west by south, mostly
through thick bricklow scrub, and encamped on a large creek,
which I considered to be Bunce's Creek. Our latitude was 26.43.
There were downs on the right side of the creek, which increased
according to Mr. Hentig up the creek, which takes its rise from
Grafton Range. These downs were according to him very large,
treeless, a most beautiful undulating country; but he saw
barriers of forest land and scrub to the westward and southward.
The creek did not appear well supplied with permanent water, but
there were several small lagoons, between which and the creek we
encamped. The 31st March, we travelled eight and a half miles
west by north, when we encamped on another good sized creek. On
our march we found the downs next to our camp did not continue
far to the westward, but that they changed into bricklow scrub
with open patches; at about four miles and a half we crossed a
creek which was larger than that on which we had camped, and
appeared better provided with water; the country on its bank was
very open; in some cypress pine thickets we observed numerous old
cattle tracks, which we met again in going to the next creek, on
which we camped in lat. 26.41. This latter creek I distinguished
by the name of M. Creek, as Mr. Hentig found that letter on one
of the trees not far off our camp. We ascertained afterwards that
Mr. Macpherson has taken possession of the upper part of this
creek to form a cattle station, and that he has put already some
of his cattle on it. The 1st April, we travelled about eleven
miles and a half west by south over a succession of beautiful
downs, with patches of bricklow scrub and forest land. Myal
abounded on the open scrub, silver-leaved ironbark and box formed
the timber of the forest, the ground was excellently grassed,
mostly pebbly and no doubt sound. The little creek on which we
camped was surrounded with myal; the water appeared however only
temporary. The 2nd April, we travelled ten miles west-north-west
over most beautiful downs, with belts and patches of scrub,
particularly to the south-west and west; to the northward
(north-west by north) we saw two distant hills; to the eastward
we saw the blue Grafton Range; to the west-north-west a scrubby
short range composed of two swelling hills and a hillock proved
to be Mount Abundance. The whole country between Mount Abundance,
the Northern Hills, and Grafton Range, is an open almost treeless
stretch, which is beautiful indeed, and deserves Sir Thomas
Mitchell's calling it "a splendid region," the ground is sound,
the grass and herbage is excellent. Very probably M. Creek or
Bunce's Creek form the eastern limits of these downs; the ranges
of the Maranoa and Amby the western; the distance from Mount
Abundance to Bunce's Creek is about 25 to 30 miles. We travelled
rather on their southern extremity, where the scrubs encroach on
the open country; but from M. Creek to the Cogoon on the west
side of Mount Abundance water was either evidently only
temporary, even in M. Creek the water-holes were entirely absent,
or the water-holes were neither reedy nor did they possess any
water-plants. Damasoniums, villarsias, potamogetons, which
characterise permanent waters.</p>
<p>The 3rd April, we travelled over the scrubby grass of Mount
Abundance to the W.N.W., and came after three or four miles to
the principal branch of the Cogoon, and to one of Mr.
Macpherson's sheep stations, the head station being about four
miles more to the southward. Even the Cogoon in its upper course
is badly supplied with permanent water, by far less than Bunce's
Creek, Frederick's Creek, and the Yahoo River. I call the
attention of the squatter particularly to Frederick's Creek, the
head of which deserves a careful examination.</p>
<p>I travelled consequently from Birell's to Mount Abundance in
eleven days, over about 118 miles; I found the greatest obstacles
between the scrubby ridge six to seven miles east of the Yahoo,
and between Bunce's Creek, a distance of twenty-five miles. All
the other country could be easily passed by drays.</p>
<p>We were most kindly received and treated wherever we came, and
had even to refuse kind offers of cattle, fearing that strange
cattle added to our own, which are remarkably quiet and steady,
might unsettle the latter. I cannot speak in too high terms of my
present party, who seem to me well qualified for the long and
tedious journey which is before us. We have killed our first
bullock at this station to obtain the necessary provisions to
carry us to the Victoria. We have been extremely favoured by the
weather; our mules and bullocks are very quiet, and we have
travelled from Canning Downs to Fitz Roy Downs without any
accident and without interruption, (with the exception of four
days stopping at Mr. Russell's) from the 3rd of March to the 3rd
of April.</p>

<br>
<p>I do myself the honor to inform you of my return with my party
from our late journey to the north-western interior, for the
purpose of gaining intelligence from the natives frequenting the
earlier parts of Dr. Leichhardt's exploration, relative to the
fate of that Gentleman and his companions: and to lay before you,
for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General, an
account of my journey and its results.</p>
<p>In accordance with your instructions directing me to proceed
to Peak Range, via the Dawson, and thence to the westward in
search of Sir Thomas Mitchell's track, in hopes of thereby
falling in with that of Dr. Leichhardt, I had left Darling Downs,
and was proceeding on that route, when being encamped in the
vicinity of Dog-wood Creek, I received an express communication
from Mr. Commissioner Whitty, of the Maranoa District, to the
effect that a man named Walker, who had been out collecting
cattle in the Mount Abundance country, had just come into Surat,
bringing in a report received by him from the natives, of the
murder of a party of white men with horses, &amp;c., on a creek
distant ten days' journey from Mount Abundance; and that some of
these natives had seen the remains, and had offered to guide him
<span class="pagenum">{Page 220}</span> thereto. Under these
circumstances I deemed it advisable at once to change my route
and proceed to this place, and test the truth of the rumour.</p>
<p>Of my proceedings after this; of having engaged Walker, in
order, through him, to procure the services (if possible) of the
two natives; and of my having started from this place, and been
compelled to return from Mount Bindango by the scarcity of water;
and of having dispatched Captain Anderson, with Walker and
another man, to bring out more rations and other mules, and if
possible to procure two other natives as guides or interpreters;
I have already informed you by my letters, dated Surat, 22nd
April, and Uckabilla, 8th May. I shall therefore proceed to a
detail of my proceedings from the latter date up to the period of
my return here, on the 20th instant.</p>
<p>A heavy fall of rain immediately after his departure delayed
the return of Captain Anderson for a week, and I was in hopes
that it had extended so far to the north-west as to fill all the
creeks and water-courses in my probable route; in this
expectation, however, I was disappointed, as I afterwards found
that the rain had not extended beyond Mount Bindango, the very
spot from which I had been previously driven back.</p>
<p>When Captain Anderson returned, bringing with him extra mules
and rations, I found that Walker had succeeded in obtaining the
services of two natives, one a "Combo", a leading man amongst the
Balonne and Mount Abundance tribes, as interpreter, and the other
a "Coppi", a young man who had just come into stations for the
first time, from a long distance to the north-west, and who
professed to know all about the murder of the white men, and said
that he had seen the very place, and the remains of bones, guns,
saddles, &amp;c.; that it was twelve days' journey, and on a
creek this side of Bunderabrilla. They had both stipulated that
they were to receive rations and ride on horseback, and on the
return of the party be rewarded each with a tomahawk, shirt, and
tobacco.</p>
<p>I accordingly once more left Uckabilla, and proceeded towards
Mount Abundance, but after one day's journey I was again detained
for three days by another <span class="pagenum">{Page 221}</span>
heavy fall of rain, which made the ground too heavy for the
loaded mules to travel; but I finally reached Mount Abundance on
the 29th May.</p>
<p>It is here worthy of remark, as proving that the natives must,
from the very first, have in some manner known every movement of
this party, which they afterwards killed, that in riding across
the Fitz Roy Downs, and in sight of the Grafton Range, "Coppi"
informed me, through the medium of "Combo" (the former not
knowing one word of English) "that the whitefellows whose remains
we were going to see had not come this way (meaning the way we
were pursuing) but had left the river and gone up the Yeulba
Creek to those hills (pointing to the Grafton Range) and thence
across the Downs to Mount Abundance." This was voluntary
information on his part, as I was riding ahead at the time, not
speaking to either of them, and I know it to be correct, having
heard on Darling Downs that Leichhardt had run up the Horse Track
Creek (Yeulba) to the Grafton Range, and thence due west to Mr.
Macpherson's station at Mount Abundance, whence he took his final
departure.</p>
<p>On the following day we remained in camp, in order to mend
hobbles, of which nearly every pair had been broken during the
late wet weather; and the next day made our final start, under
the guidance of "Coppi," who took the same direction round to the
northward of Mount Bindango, and on the third day we encamped on
the Amby or Tina Montil Creek. Here the two blacks began to show
signs of having gone far enough, telling us that there was no
more water between us and the Culba, and that blackfellows would
kill us, and so forth. I could very easily believe the former
statement, as there had evidently been no rain at all in this
direction, and we were then encamped on a small isolated
waterhole in the creek, to which we had that day been compelled
to retrace our steps, having found that another creek farther on
was perfectly dry. However, knowing that we could not be at most
farther than thirty-five miles from Sir Thomas Mitchell's old
Depot Camp, on the Maranoa, I determined to reach that, even if
we should have to pass one night without water; first determining
to leave the party in camp for one day, and reconnoitre. This I
did, but unsuccessfully; so we all moved on the next day,
<span class="pagenum">{Page 222}</span> travelled thirty miles,
found every creek and watercourse dry and overgrown with grass
and weeds: encamped without water; and finally, on the 5th June,
reached the Maranoa, and encamped about a quarter of a mile below
the Depot, on a reach described by Sir Thomas as being full of
water and large fish, but where we now saw nothing but a deep dry
sandy bed, full of long reeds, with a small shallow pool of
brackish water, out of which, to avoid dirt and sediment, the
buckets had to be filled by means of a pint pot.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, "Coppi" now said that we were near the
place, and going up to the old Depot, whither I and Mr. Drysdale
accompanied him, he commenced picking up sheep's bones, old
pieces of powder canisters, &amp;c., showing them to us. I knew
very well that all these things had been thrown about and left
here by Sir Thomas Mitchell's party, but I made signs to him to
enquire where were the white men's bones, horses' bones, guns,
saddles, &amp;c. He told me by signs that everything had been
thrown into the water and carried away in a flood. However, in
the absence of Old Billy (Combo), whom I had sent with Walker in
search of a stray mule, I could make nothing of him, so returned
to the camp. He had, on first joining us, given a very clear
account of the whole affair, saying that he was only a young boy
when it happened (he being now apparently about sixteen years
old). He told us how the blacks had followed the party for some
days, and at last surprised them all when asleep; that they had
driven off all the horses and mules and killed them: that only
one shot had been fired by the whites, which killed one
blackfellow; and that some of the bullocks had escaped, and were
now running about higher up the Culba; and had also assigned as a
reason for the murder the ill-treatment of some gins by the two
blackfellows attached to the white party, when riding about the
bush in search of the horses and bullocks; and he further said
that one of these blacks had large bushy beard and whiskers, like
my man Brown, and the other smooth face like him. This I also
know to be correct. One of Leichhardt's blacks, "Flash Billy,"
whose brother is now with me, having had a very large beard, and
the other, "Wommai," as I knew myself, was almost a boy, without
either beard or whiskers.</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 223}</span>
<p>Walker and "Combo," with another (Mr. Edgar), being away all
night in search of this mule, it was necessary to reduce each
watch from two men to one, giving each one hour and a half. The
night of the 6th was very dark, and our guide, "Coppi," escaped.
I had had not the slightest idea that by himself he would have
attempted it, or I should have taken measures to prevent his
doing so. I very much suspected that he had arranged with the
other that he too should run away, and meet him at some appointed
place; and was rather surprised, next day, when they returned
with the mule, to see Billy with them. He had, at any rate, got
the same story from "Coppi," and we were, consequently, for the
next five days, examining the river side, the Depot Camp, and
every angle and bend in the river for some miles both up and
down, to try and find some indication of Leichhardt's having been
there; but nothing could we find, not even a marked tree, to show
that he had gone that way. My blacks indeed thought that in some
places they could see tracks as if a large lot of cattle and
horses had been driven either up or down the river, but these
were only partial, and could not be kept by them for any
distance. On the fifth day Billy told Walker that "Coppi" had
only been telling us "gammon" about this being the spot, that it
was a good way further; that we should leave the Culba and cross
a range to another large creek, the country of the "Niemin" or
Pisant Blacks, who were the people that had killed the white men.
He said that "Coppi" was afraid to take this white party out
amongst his own people, as we would shoot both him and them when
we saw the bones, and that he had consequently determined to tell
us a lie and leave us; but that he (Billy) would go with us, and
talk to the blackfellows for us, provided we made good haste, as
he was afraid we would all be killed if we delayed. I accordingly
promised him a double-barrelled gun, knife, tomahawk, &amp;c., on
our return to Surat, as a reward for his services, if we could
fall in with natives who would lead us to the desired spot.</p>
<p>The 14th and 15th June we travelled up the Maranoa, being
fortunate enough to find water in the bed of the river at which
to encamp on both days, in Lat. 26 deg. 4 mins. 0 secs. South. I
thought it advisable to leave <span class="pagenum">{Page
224}</span> the party and find water ahead before again moving
it; this I did after following the course of the river for some
miles, though in a very small and dirty pool; moved on here next
day, and leaving them to form the camp, went on again with
Walker, Brown, and Billy, to look for more water, and also in
hopes of falling in with the natives. During this ride of
reconnaissance we saw fresh cattle tracks, apparently of not more
than four or six head of very large bullocks; these tracks were
not more than a day or two old, and Billy said belonged to the
cattle which had got away from the blacks when they killed the
white men.</p>
<p>Finding water, I moved the camp on next day, and on the 19th
left the river and followed a tributary from the westward, in
which, at about ten miles, we found water and encamped. Here was
the first native camp we had seen, apparently of one blackfellow
and his gin; after encamping, I sent Walker and Billy out in
search of them; they returned just after sunset with a
"picaninny," a boy about ten years old, who it appeared had been
there with an old gin, and who said he knew all about the murder
of the white men, and volunteered to come with us.</p>
<p>Next morning, having the boy mounted on a led horse, we
started under his guidance, but it soon became apparent that he
knew nothing of the direction we ought to take to reach this
place stated by him to be five days' journey distant. On
questioning him through old Billy, he said that he had never been
there, but that he had heard the story from all the blackfellows;
he told us the same as "Coppi" had formerly, and even on this
very morning when our horses and mules were driven up to the camp
in hobbles, he shouted and laughed and repeatedly said something
in the Coogi language, repeating the word "Bunderabulla," and on
my asking Billy what he was saying, he told me it was "that the
mules and horses were jumping in the hobbles in the same way that
the blackfellows described those to have done which they had
driven off and killed."</p>
<p>However, I followed the same tributary for some distance to
the north-west, and then left it and crossed another deep creek
running to the north-west; seeing a <span class="pagenum">{Page
225}</span> fire, as of a gin burning the reeds in the bed of the
creek, I sent Billy with Walker down to endeavour to obtain some
information from her; they returned, accompanied by a gin with a
child on her shoulders. She came towards us without much apparent
trepidation, and a long conversation ensued between her and
Billy, the substance of which was that the white men were killed
on a creek this side of Bunderabulla, to which she pointed
W.N.W., that it was seven days' journey, and then pointing to
saddles, guns, pots, &amp;c., said that plenty of those were
there; she pointed N.W. as the direction we should take, and told
Billy there was plenty of water.</p>
<p>Leaving her, we proceeded in a general N.W. course tor about
five miles, gradually ascending a scrubby pine ridge&mdash;the
creek running from N.W. away to S. and S.W.; crossing this ridge
we descended a grassy valley which led us to a creek or river in
very fine open forest country, coming from N. and N.E. and
running here E. to W. The broad sandy bed was, however, perfectly
dry, and though we followed every bend and turn for upwards of
sixteen miles in a general N.W. course, not one drop could we
find. Long after nightfall we fortunately fell in with about two
buckets-full of water in a hole in a rock&mdash;upon which we
encamped, having enough to make some tea for ourselves, though
the horses and mules could get none&mdash;this deprivation,
however, being in some measure alleviated by the abundance of
green feed, particularly wild carrots and geranium, which was
springing up in all directions.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the horses not having wandered far, I went off
down the river, attended by Brown and Billy, to look for water.
This we found after having followed its course about eight miles,
in a small deep pool; to this I moved the camp, and here we were
detained next day by heavy rain, which however had no effect on
the sandy bed of the river; for the next two days I had to
reconnoitre for water before moving the party.</p>
<p>On the 25th, leaving the party at camp XIX., in Lat. 25 deg.
38 min. 23 secs. S., I again went out attended by Walker, Brown,
and Billy, to look for water, and also in hopes of meeting some
other natives from whom we might obtain intelligence. The river,
which had for the last twenty <span class="pagenum">{Page
226}</span> miles been gradually taking a S.W. course, here
turned almost due south, and I accordingly took a west course in
hopes of falling in with some other creek leading in the
direction I wished for; after riding some miles, we came upon a
broad deep creek, dry, but which by the floodmarks we could tell
ran from W. to E. and S.E., apparently to join the river we had
left, and which I now assumed from its course and position to be
the Warregi; riding up this for some distance, we saw a native
fire, and hastening up to it saw a wretched-looking infant
sitting on the ground, with no one else near it. I left Brown to
watch there, while we searched the bush round about, could find
no natives, and returning to the fire, saw, perched in a tree
above Brown's head, the mother of the child. She was very
frightened, but on Billy speaking to her in Coogi, and assuring
her we meant no harm, she came down. A long conversation then
ensued, and as the interpreter informed me, the substance of it
was that she knew all about the murder of these white men, saying
that it was four days' journey thence; she also pointed out guns,
saddles, &amp;c., as having been scattered about; we accompanied
her to her camp on the other side of the creek, where was a very
old, withered gin; on our coming up, and before the first one
spoke, the old woman corroborated the story, saying that the
creek upon which we now were was the one upon which the white men
were killed, that the name of the "touri" or place was "Ballour,"
and of the creek "Berando," and that of the river behind us
"Bialing." The old woman told us that she would remain where she
was until next day, and that when we came up she would go with us
and guide us to some blackfellows, who would show us the place;
we then returned to camp.</p>
<p>Next day the whole party moved on, and in order that these two
gins might not be alarmed at the sight of so many men and
animals, I sent Walker and Billy ahead to keep them there until
we should get up. On arriving at the creek, however, the gins
were gone, nor were there any signs of the other two; presuming
that the gins had decamped, and that Walker had followed them, I
halted the party on the other side of the creek to wait for his
arrival. He did not come in till nearly 11 p.m., bringing the two
women with him; he reported <span class="pagenum">{Page
227}</span> that not finding them at the camp, he had followed
them; Billy tracked them many miles, and they at length came up
with them in a pine scrub.</p>
<p>I now told them that they must stay with us and take us to the
place we were looking for, that I would give them plenty to eat,
and a tomahawk each when we should have seen these remains; they
agreed to go, and on the following morning we started under their
guidance. We had not gone many miles when the old gin suddenly
told us "that she would take us a short cut to the spot where the
white men were killed, that it had taken them four days to run up
a creek that way (pointing east), but that by going through some
brigalow we could make a very short cut, and that by sunset we
should reach the very place." She accordingly took us a general
W.N.W. course through some brigalow and pine scrubs, and just
before sunset brought us up to a water-hole, which I at first
took to be the head of the creek we had left in the morning,
especially as we had been ascending ridges all day, and the
barometer showed that we had an increased altitude of nine
hundred feet.</p>
<p>Here the old gin sat down and told us this was the spot. There
were no relics to be seen, and on enquiring of her where such
were, she replied that "big water carried them all away." I was
far from satisfied with this reply, but as we had made a long
stage of about 10 miles, over very heavy sandy country, I
determined to encamp, and remain a day or two if necessary, and
examine the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On the following morning, the 28th, I again spoke to these two
gins, through the medium of the interpreter. The old woman still
adhered to her story, and said that she knew this was the place,
though she had never seen the remains, as the blackfellows would
not allow any of the women to approach it, telling them "that
whitemen's 'debil debil' always walked about." She again said
that she had been there present at the murder, or rather, as the
women and children always are in such cases, in the background;
she even pointed to the ridges behind as having been their
position at the time;&mdash;that the blackfellows had followed
these white men for many days;&mdash;that they were in countless
numbers, like "niemen" (pointing to a large ant bed near
her);&mdash;that they formed <span class="pagenum">{Page
228}</span> a very large circle, and gradually closed up upon the
white camp;&mdash;that just at day dawn, all the white men being
asleep, the blacks rushed on them and speared them as they
lay;&mdash;that only one white man, who was sleeping at some
distance, awoke, and fired his gun once, shooting one
blackfellow, but that he was immediately killed, and that the
blackfellow who was wounded went away and died in the
bush;&mdash;that previous to this the blacks had, in the early
part of the night, driven away and killed all the horses and
mules, and that they afterwards ate them, having a great
feast;&mdash;when they were very full lying down and sleeping
till again hungry; they also killed a few of the cattle, but that
the rest got away from them; that for a long time afterwards
there were quart pots, pint pots, red shirts, axes and other
things in the blacks' camps, but that now they were all gone. She
also assigned as a reason for this act the ill usage of some gins
by the two blackfellows attached to the party. She then told me
that up that way (pointing east) was an old Camp and marked tree
of this party, and that away westward there was another. On my
asking her "how it could be that they had been killed here if
they had a camp further on," she said that they had gone from the
eastward camp to the westward, and thence returned and encamped
at this waterhole.</p>
<p>I mounted my horse, and attended by Walker and Brown, rode out
to the eastward; found a creek running in that direction, and
about 10 miles down it found for the first time one of
Leichhardt's marked Camps. It was in an angle of the creek, now
perfectly dry; there was the mark, thus&mdash; <span style=
"float:left; margin: 0px 10px 5px 20px; clear:left;"><a name=
"hely-1" id="hely-1"></a><img alt="" src=
"1305431h-images/hely-1.jpg"></span> the letters probably intended
for 15th April; the tent poles and forks&mdash;the heavy saplings
on which he had placed his packs (showing that the ground must
have been very wet and damp); and even the forked sticks and
cross piece in front of the fire, on which they had most probably
roasted part of a kangaroo, the bones of which were lying about.
There was also in one place a large quantity of cattle dung,
showing where the bullocks had been bedded; but though Brown and
Billy, who was also with me, looked carefully for tracks either
coming to or departing <span class="pagenum">{Page 229}</span>
from this camp, they could find none, the soil being as we had
found it ever since we reached the Maranoa, loose and sandy. The
most probable reason for our never having seen any of his camps
before is that at the time he left Mount Abundance the whole
country was in a state of inundation; consequently he could
travel in any direction, always sure of plenty of water, whereas
it has been so scarce since I have been out that we have been
compelled to follow water courses, and even then have had to
encamp more than once without any.</p>
<p>Returning to the camp, we fell in with natives' tracks and
followed them, and about sunset came up with an old gin with a
child and two young girls of nine or ten years old. They were
very frightened, but we called out as usual "ara-wabbe," which
means in Coogi that we would not hurt them. They then came up to
us, and the old woman told us that the white men were killed
eight days' journey hence; that there were very large plains to
cross, three days' journey, without water, &amp;c.; but she also
pointed to saddles, guns, &amp;c. We brought them also to the
camp, and found that during my absence they had secured another
gin, who was passing near without perceiving them. We had now
nine women and children in camp, whom I was determined to detain
until I could find some of the blackfellows; had I allowed the
others to go, of course the blacks would soon leave the
neighbourhood. I gave them all plenty of flour and sugar, and
they were soon perfectly at home.</p>
<p>The gin who had been detained during my absence told me that
the bones, &amp;c., were to be seen at a place four days' journey
away, and that her son, a "Coppi," was camped a short distance
away; that she would in the morning go with me to his camp and
prevail upon him to accompany us to the spot, as he had seen the
remains, &amp;c., and knew all about the whole affair.
Accordingly at daylight on the 29th I went on horseback with the
same attendants as on the previous day, and taking also the old
gin who had volunteered, and one of the little girls. About four
miles N.E. of our camp, and on the borders of a pine scrub, we
found the blacks' camp. On going up to them, assuring them
through Billy of our peaceable intentions, we saw two fine
athletic young men, of which one was "Coppi," the other "Marri."
<span class="pagenum">{Page 230}</span> They repeated the same
story that we had so often heard before, pointing also to guns,
&amp;c.; said the place was three days' journey thence, and was
due west, at least so they pointed. They agreed to come with us;
they told us they were two of the "Niemens", but that it was
other blacks who had killed the white men, whereas, at Mount
Abundance, the natives accused the "Niemens". "Coppi" was a good
countenanced man, but the other as villainous a looking scoundrel
as I ever saw. I would have preferred taking the former alone,
but they said they must both go.</p>
<p>I brought these back to the camp (XXI.), and prepared
immediately for proceeding on our journey. We left at about
half-past one o'clock, leaving all the gins and children to go
about their business. We travelled about ten miles in a general
W.N.W. course, and encamped on a waterhole, or rather chain of
ponds, in Lat. 25 deg. 30 min. S., and long., by account, from
lunar observations of Capt. Anderson at Camp XVIII., 146 deg. 35
min. E. On the following morning I presented each of my guides
with trousers and shirt, and gave them many promises of tomahawks
and knives when they should have performed the service required
of them. We again proceeded, under their guidance, W.N.W., and in
about five miles reached a large deep creek, half bank high, with
water discoloured, as if from recent floods; this they informed
me was called Alpomdulla Creek. The country here was magnificent,
open forest, or rather plains, with clumps of apple tree, well
grassed, and altogether the finest I have ever seen.</p>
<p>From this creek they turned off at a tangent, and much to my
surprise led us all the day until nearly sunset in an E.N.E., and
N.N.E. course, finally causing us to encamp on a very muddy
waterhole.</p>
<p>During the first watch Walker informed me that Billy had just
told him these natives were leading us to the bones of
blackfellows, and not to the place where the white men had been
murdered. On speaking to them about it, they said they were
afraid to take us there, as they knew we would shoot them
directly. I assured them that they were perfectly safe, and that
so far from shooting them, I would reward them. Walker suggested
to me the propriety of putting handcuffs on them; but this
<span class="pagenum">{Page 231}</span> I would not listen to;
and I also gave strict orders that should they get away in any of
the watches, that no shot should he fired on them, even if they
could not be recaptured. I had no authority to permit anything of
the sort, and it would have been in the highest degree
injudicious.</p>
<p>These two men had accompanied me of their own free will, and
on my assurance of their safety; they did not consider themselves
prisoners, but thought, no doubt, as they came so they might go;
and I was convinced that if by fair means they would not show us
that of which we were in search, force would be of no avail; and
I determined rather to let them go if they felt so disposed, and
stand my chance of finding others who might give me information,
than attempt any restraint or threats with them. Had I used the
latter, had I tied them up and threatened to shoot them if they
did not lead me to this place, they might have immediately denied
all knowledge of it; and as I would not be justified in shooting
them, I should then have had to let them go, with a very poor
opinion of the courage of the white men.</p>
<p>Our guides did not, however, desert us this night, but the
next morning said they would take us to the place, but that it
was now eight days' journey, W. by S. They accordingly led us
about 12 miles, as we did not leave the camp until about 1 p.m.,
in order to obtain the sun's meridian altitude, which gave our
latitude 25 deg. 21 min. S.; the direction we pursued to-day was
to the north of west, and it was not until after the moon rose
that we encamped on Alpomdulla Creek, much higher up that when we
had met it yesterday. The flood at this part of the creek had
passed away, leaving only various small streams of muddy water
meandering along the various channels it had formed for itself in
the sandy bed.</p>
<p>Here at length our two guides deserted us; they sneaked away
as only blackfellows can; during my own (the morning watch), and
three of us standing intently watching their fire where they were
one instant, and from which in another they were gone. Billy, who
had been getting very uneasy for a day or so before, told me that
these two natives were too much afraid of being shot <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 232}</span> to show us the bones; but that they
had told him we must cross four creeks, then a large plain for
three days, and then three more creeks before we should find the
spot.</p>
<p>I determined, however, to proceed further up this creek, in
hopes of falling in with some other natives from whom I might
gain intelligence, and perhaps a guide; followed it in a general
north course for 12 or 14 miles; saw neither natives nor tracks,
and encamped.</p>
<p>We were now on the Nive, or Nivelle, of Sir Thomas Mitchell,
much lower down than that gentleman had been. Our position was 25
deg. 9 min. S. latitude, and longitude by account from lunar
observations, 146 deg. 29 min. E., considerably to the south, and
far to the west of the head of the Victoria; and yet when even
more to the southward these guides had pointed to W. by S., as
the situation of the creek upon which the whites were killed.</p>
<p>At 9 p.m. this night our interpreter deserted. This was a
thing I nor any body else who has the slightest knowledge of the
natives would never for an instant have dreamed of. We were now
nearly three hundred miles from the nearest part of the Balonne,
his own country; and the idea of his leaving us to go in by
himself, and run the gauntlet of all the tribes in his route, I
should have scouted as ridiculous; but it was, nevertheless,
true; he had gone, and with him taken our best tomahawk, leaving
in exchange some of his clothes. I could not help thinking that
this had been done by him in pursuance of an arrangement entered
into between him and the guides who had previously deserted. As
Billy was known as one of the greatest scoundrels in the Mount
Abundance country, and as the head and prime mover in all the
murders and disturbances which had at last driven Mr. McPherson
from the Fitz Roy Downs, I thought that he might, perhaps, have
made a commencement by driving away our horses, &amp;c., so I
sent two men mounted, by the light of the moon, to drive them all
up to the camp, where the watches kept them about until
daylight.</p>
<p>No other course was now left open to me but to return at once
to camp XXI., and endeavour to find the <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 233}</span> other camp of Leichhardt, of which
the old gin had told me as being to the westward. We accordingly,
on the 3rd instant, retraced our steps, and arrived at this camp
on the evening of the 5th. Here the party remained the following
day, while I went out, attended by Edgar, Walker, and Brown, in
search of this camp. Riding due west, I came upon a creek, from
S.W. to N. and N.E., followed it down some miles, and at length
crossed our own track to camp XXII., under the guidance of the
two natives. Within a quarter of a mile of this I found, in an
angle of the creek, the other camp marked L, of which she had
told me; the same mark&mdash; <span style=
"float:right; margin: 0px 10px 5px 20px; clear:right;"><a name=
"hely-2" id="hely-2"></a><img alt="" src=
"1305431h-images/hely-2.jpg"></span> large and heavy saplings for
packs, tent poles, I bullock dung, &amp;c.; but no tracks; and
the creek itself, with a shallow bed, dry, and overgrown with
long grass and weeds. Even about the camp Brown could not see a
track. I was now aware that it would be useless, or worse than
useless, to remain any longer searching about for his tracks. We
had been beyond this upwards of 45 miles&mdash;west, east, and
north&mdash;without seeing any, and I thought the wisest plan I
could pursue would be to return to Surat with all speed, and, if
possible, obtain another interpreter, and return, though not with
the hope of gaining more information than I have hitherto
obtained. In this matter I consulted some of my party, and their
opinion coincided with my own, and all expressed their readiness
to come out with me again. I was more induced to pursue this
course on account of the severe illness of one of my companions,
Mr. Horsburgh, who had for some time past been seriously
indisposed, and was daily growing worse.</p>
<p>I accordingly retraced my steps, and knowing exactly where I
should find water. I regulated the stages accordingly, and
arrived here on the 20th instant, exactly seventeen days from the
date of our interpreter's desertion, and four months from the day
we first loaded the mules to leave Darling Downs. For the last
week Mr. Horsburgh has suffered much from an attack of acute
rheumatism, having had to be lifted on and off his horse, raised
up and laid down, and even assisted to walk a few steps. He is
now under the care of Mr. Drysdale, the Surgeon, considerably
better, but very weak and unable to travel.</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 234}</span>
<p>On our return I found that Billy was already here, having
arrived on the 14th; thus making the journey in twelve days, or
at the rate of nearly twenty-five miles per day. He tried to
evade me; but I called to him as he was running off, and he
unwillingly came. He excused himself by saying that he feared we
would shoot him; then that he thought the blacks would kill us
all, and so forth; but on my asking him if he were willing to
come with me again, he said he would. He also told me that those
blackfellows "too much gammon"; that they had taken us past the
place, and would never show us; that they feared too much we were
going to kill them in revenge; and they said that they had told
him a fire had burned everything.</p>
<p>Of course I know it would be folly to believe all he says; but
at the same time I am now fully convinced that the chances of
success would be very dubious even were I to return. I might find
natives who would pretend to take us to the spot and show us
where Leichhardt was killed, and tell us everything had been
burned, or carried away in a flood, as the old woman has already
done. She certainly may have told the truth, though I doubt it;
but she could at all events show us, or tell us where to find old
camps of this very party. I am much disposed to believe that the
natives, now that we have been amongst them, and fearing another
visit, will put out of the way everything that has already not
been destroyed, as they firmly believed, notwithstanding our
assurances, that we intended shooting them in revenge for the
death of our countrymen by their hands. Of the truth of the
report I have now not the slightest doubt. The manner and cause
of the murder has been told and corroborated in every particular
by so many that there can now be but one opinion on the
matter.</p>
<p>After mature consideration, therefore, I have determined to
return to Sydney with all dispatch; the rations I have now
remaining, that is the flour, will barely suffice to carry me
there, and in the event of going out again. I had depended upon
replenishing my stock here or at the neighbouring stations; but
in consequence of the late floods at Moreton Bay, the teams have
been detained, and every establishment on the river is short of
rations.</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 235}</span>
<p>With regard to my own, I must observe that I had in the outset
calculated the quantity with the greatest care, as a limited
ration of 5 lbs. flour and 2½ lbs. meat for nine men and nine
mouths. By the subsequent alteration of my arrangements (my party
originally consisted of ten instead of nine) I have been for the
last three months feeding never less than eleven, sometimes
twelve, sometimes fourteen, and on one occasion twenty-two. I
never limited the natives, giving them as much as they could eat
to prevent them leaving, and as for my own party, I found that
short rations for nine men would not serve ten who had to work
hard, live in the open air, and keep from two to three hours
watch every night in a temperature averaging ten degrees below
freezing point. The meat which I took with me originally, 420
lbs., though excellent, lost in weight at least 25 per cent., and
as for game, we could not depend upon it, having been
twenty-eight days without even seeing a pigeon; on other
occasions we obtained abundance, but at any time the allowance of
meat from the stores did not exceed 3 lbs. per diem amongst the
whole party, blacks and all. For the last week we had none. I
merely mention this to account for the rations not having lasted
as long as I had anticipated, and as most probably would have
been expected. We have now been using them since the 3rd March,
and they will last about seven weeks more, which will altogether
make a period of about 6½ months.</p>
<p>I had almost omitted to report that amongst the gins whom we
had collected at Camp XXI. there were three tomahawks, apparently
rudely fashioned from the plates of saddle trees; these they
acknowledged to have been part of the spoil of the white men, and
said that the blackfellows had given them to them. They appeared
to have been made by doubling and hammering together the gullet
plates of saddles, and were sharpened at one end and fastened
with gum into cleft sticks, as are the common stone tomahawks. I
should have taken one of these, but had none to spare in exchange
for it, and taking it away from them would have been much at
variance with our professions towards them; besides, I had just
then obtained the two guides, and was in hopes of soon finding
other and stronger proof.</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 236}</span>
<p>The boy who joined the party beyond the Maranoa, and who has
since remained with us, I intend taking to Sydney. He will soon
become sufficiently acquainted with our language to tell all he
knows of this sad business, and in the event of any future
expedition going in that direction would prove most useful as an
interpreter, his language&mdash;the Coogi&mdash;being the
furthest known northern dialect.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude this report without thanking my party,
generally, for their assistance and zealous co-operation on all
occasions; to Messrs. Anderson, Horsburgh, and Drysdale, these
are especially due; Mr. Edgar, though newly arrived in the
Colony, and utterly unused to such a life, proved useful; Walker
was most anxious for the successful termination of the journey,
and did his best to promote it; and Jefferson proved an active,
hard-working man, and particularly fitted for this sort of thing.
My two natives, Brown and Jackey (the former particularly) could
not be excelled; and the half-caste boy was also very useful,
especially in the catching and loading of the mules, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Mr. Drysdale, in addition to his share in the general duties
of the camp, has made a valuable and interesting collection of
birds and insects for the Museum; and in all cases where his
medical aid has been required, particularly in that of Mr.
Horsburgh, his unwearied attention has been beyond all
praise.</p>
<p>To the squatters on my outward route, particularly to H.
Hughes, Esq., M.L.C., of Darling Downs, I am under great
obligations for their kindness; to that gentleman especially, at
whose stations we were encamped for upwards of four weeks, and on
whose run our sick and knocked up horses recovered their strength
and vigour, are my thanks due.</p>
<p>Hoping that what has been done may meet with the approval of
His Excellency the Governor-General.</p>

14TH SEPTEMBER, 1857, WITH RESPECT TO AN EXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF
DR. LEICHHARDT.</p>
<p align="center">MINUTE NUMBER 57-44.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Governor-General, at the instance of the
Honourable the Colonial Secretary, brings under the consideration
of the Council a proposal which has been made to organise another
Expedition to ascertain, if possible, beyond doubt, the fate of
Dr. Leichhardt, who left Sydney some nine years ago with the
intention of exploring the north-western interior of Australia.
This proposal has its origin in a public meeting, held in Sydney
on the 11th instant, at which resolutions were passed invoking
the assistance of the Government, and it is recommended to
favourable consideration at the present moment by the
circumstance that Mr. Gregory, who recently returned from a
successful exploration in the same direction, has intimated his
willingness to undertake the conduct of the proposed
Expedition.</p>
<p>2. The Council express themselves desirous of seizing so
favourable an opportunity of pursuing this inquiry, and they
therefore advise that Mr. Gregory should be at once invited to
submit, for approval, a definite proposal having for its object:
1st, to ascertain the fate of the late Dr. Leichhardt; and, 2nd,
to connect the exploring surveys of Mitchell and Kennedy with his
own; such proposal to be accompanied by an estimate of the
probable expense which it will be necessary to incur.</p>

<p align="center">2. <i>Expedition from Moreton Bay in Search of
Leichhardt and Party</i>. By <span class="a">Augustus Charles
Gregory, Esq.</span> (<span class="u">gold medallist,
r.g.s.</span>).</p>
<p>8<i>th Dec</i>. 1857.&mdash;Having received instructions from
the Honourable the Secretary for Land and Public Works to
organize an expedition for the purpose of searching for traces of
Dr. Leichhardt and party, who left New South Wales in 1848 with
the intention of proceeding overland to Western Australia, I
proceeded to Moreton Bay (11<i>th Jan</i>. 1858) with such
portions of the equipment as had been prepared in Sydney.</p>
<p>On reaching Ipswich forty horses were purchased, and having
despatched the stores to Mr. Royd's station, on the Dawson River,
by drays, the party was collected at that place; but, owing to
unforeseen delays in the transport of the stores, the equipment
and organization of the expedition were not complete till the
latter part of March.</p>
<span class="pagenum">{Page 19}</span>
<p>The following list of the party, horses, stores, &amp;c., will
show the principal arrangements.</p>
<p>The party consisted of nine persons, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>A. C. Gregory, <i>Commander</i>; C. F. Gregory,
<i>Assistant-Commander</i>; S. Burgoyne, <i>Assistant</i>; G.
Phibbs, <i>Overseer. Stockmen, &amp;c.</i>, E. Bowman, W. Selby,
T. Dunn, W. Wedel, and D. Worrell.</p>
<p>The stock consisted of horses alone, comprising 31 pack and 9
saddle horses, completely equipped.</p>
<p>Provisions comprised the dried meat of 2 bullocks and 4 sheep,
weighing, as butcher's meat, 16 cwt., but when dried and the
bones removed, reduced to 300 lbs.; in addition to this, 500 lbs.
bacon, 1600 lbs. flour, 100 lbs. rice, 350 lbs. sugar, 60 lbs.
tea, 40 lbs. tobacco, and some minor articles.</p>
<p>The arms and ammunition were: 1 Minié rifle, 8 double-barrel
guns, 9 revolver pistols, 25 lbs. gunpowder, 150 lbs. shot and
balls, percussion caps, &amp;c.</p>
<p>For the conveyance of water two leather water-bags were
provided, each holding 5 gallons, besides which each of the party
was furnished with a water-bag of India-rubber, holding 3
pints.</p>
<p>The tents were made of calico, each suited for the
accommodation of two persons, and the several articles of camp
equipage were of the lightest construction consistent with the
service required.</p>
<p>The instruments employed were an 8-inch sextant, box-sextant,
prismatic compasses, pocket compasses, double axis compass,
aneroid barometers, thermometers, and artificial horizon,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Including forty sets of horseshoes, farrier's and carpenter's
tools, together with sundry material for repairs, &amp;c., the
total weight of the equipment was about 4600 lbs. exclusive of
the saddles and harness, which gave an average load of 160 lbs.
as the net load carried by each pack-horse.</p>
<p>24<i>th March</i>.&mdash;These arrangements being complete the
expedition left "Juanda" and proceeded by the road to Mr. Carew's
station at "Euroomba," from which (27<i>th March</i>), under the
guidance of Mr. Bolton&mdash;whose local knowledge was of
material service&mdash;we made our way through the dense scrubs
and broken country to the west for about 30 miles, to the head of
"Scott's Creek," a small tributary of the Dawson River.</p>
<p>29<i>th March</i>.&mdash;The general course was now W.N.W.,
through a country with rich grassy valleys and dense scrubs of
"brigalow" acacia on the higher ground. Green grass was abundant
at this time; but I fear that in seasons of drought few of the
water-holes are permanent. The timber consists of iron-bark, box,
and a few other species of eucalyptus; the brigalow acacia
attaining the height of <span class="pagenum">{Page 20}</span> 30
feet. Soft brown sandstones of the coal measures are the
prevailing rock, forming hills with table summits.</p>
<p>2<i>nd April</i>.&mdash;With some difficulty, owing to the
dense scrubs, we crossed the basaltic ridge which divides the
eastern waters flowing to the Dawson River from those trending to
the west into the basin of the Maranoa River, a tributary of
which, probably the Merivale River, was followed westward. The
country became more sandy, timbered with iron-bark, cypress,
&amp;c. The whole was, however, well grassed, and suited for
grazing, if not too heavily stocked.</p>
<p>5<i>th April</i>.&mdash;Beaching the Maranoa River in about
latitude 25° 45', water was scarcely procurable in the sandy bed,
and we had to dig wells to obtain a supply.</p>
<p>Warned by the fact that Messrs. H. Gregory and Hely had been
unable to penetrate the country to the west from scarcity of
water, even three months earlier in the season, we followed up
the Maranoa to "Mount Owen" (7<i>th April</i>), and having found
a sufficient supply of water and grass for a few days' halt, I
proceeded to reconnoitre the country to the west, and at length
found a practicable route to the tributaries of the "Warrego"
River, to which the party was advanced (12<i>th April</i>).</p>
<p>A heavy shower of rain had filled the gullies in this
locality, and green grass clothed the country, forming a striking
contrast to the dry and waterless valley of the Maranoa.</p>
<p>Fine openly timbered valleys, well suited for pasture,
alternated with ridges of scrub of brigalow acacia till we
reached "Mount Playfair" (15<i>th April</i>), a basaltic hill on
the sandstone ridge which separates the Warrego Valley from that
of the "Nive," a small branch of which was followed (16<i>th
April</i>) down to its junction with the main channel in latitude
25° 6'.</p>
<p>The soil in the valley of the Nive is sandy, thinly grassed,
and openly timbered with iron-bark, spotted gum, &amp;c.; the
back country rising into low sandstone ridges, covered with dense
scrub of brigalow acacia. Some pools of permanent water,
containing small fish, were passed, on the bank of which the
remains of numerous native camps were seen.</p>
<p>17<i>th April</i>.&mdash;From the Nive River a N.N.W. course
was pursued through a nearly level sandy country, covered with a
scrub of acacia, eucalypti, bottle-tree, &amp;c., which offered
great impediments to our progress, till within 6 miles of the
"Victoria River," when we suddenly emerged from the scrub on to
open downs of rich clay soil; but the drought had been of such a
long continuance that the whole of the vegetation had been
destroyed and swept away by the wind, leaving the country to all
appearance an absolute desert. <span class="pagenum">{Page
21}</span></p>
<p>The bed of the Victoria was scarcely 10 yards wide, and
perfectly dry, so that it was only after a prolonged search along
its course that a small puddle of water was found in a hollow of
the clay flat, and near it, fortunately for our horses, a little
grass growing in widely scattered tufts.</p>
<p>Being now on the line of route which Leichhardt had stated his
intention of following, the party was divided, so that both sides
of the river were examined 'in all probable positions in which
his camps might have been situated (19<i>th April</i>); but as
the high floods appeared to have inundated the country for nearly
a mile on each bank last year, all tracks of previous explorers
were necessarily obliterated, and it was only by marked trees, or
the bones of cattle, that we could hope to discover any
trace.</p>
<p>During the first two days' journey down the river only a few
small pools of water were seen, and these not of a permanent
character, while, the rich vegetation on the open downs, which
had excited the admiration of Sir T. Mitchell on his discovery of
the country in a favourable season, had wholly passed away,
leaving little but a bare surface of clay, the deep fissures in
its surface giving evidence of long-continued drought.</p>
<p>20<i>th April</i>&mdash;In latitude 24° 37', longitude 146°
13', a small sandy creek, of equal size with the Victoria, joined
from the east, and just below the first permanent pool of water
was found. There was a slight improvement in the grass, but dense
scrubs prevailed in the back country, and even approached the
river at intervals.</p>
<p>21<i>st April</i>.&mdash;While collecting the horses near this
pool of water, I detected a party of armed natives watching one
of the stockmen, evidently, from their position in the scrub and
general movements, inclined to hostilities, and I imagine that it
was a knowledge that we were aware of their intentions which
prevented my being able to establish any communication with them.
I may here remark that this party, which numbered about eight,
were the first natives seen during the journey.</p>
<p>21<i>st April</i>&mdash;(Lat. 24° 85', long. 146° 6'.)
Continuing our route along the river we discovered a "Moreton Bay
Ash" (<i>Eucalyptus sp</i>.), about two feet diameter, marked
with the letter L on the east side, cut through the bark, about'
four feet from the ground, and near it the stumps of some small
trees which had been cut with a sharp axe, also a deep notch cut
in the side of a sloping tree, apparently to support the
ridge-pole of a tent, or for some similar purpose; all indicating
that a camp had been established here by Leichhardt's party. The
tree was near the bank of a small reach of water, which is noted
on Sir T. Mitchell's map: this, together with its actual and
<span class="pagenum">{Page 22}</span> relative position as
regards other features of the country, prove it not to have been
either one of Sir T. Mitchell's or Mr. Kennedy's camps, as
neither encamped within several miles of the spot, besides which,
the letter could not have been marked by either of them to
designate the number of the camp, as the former had long passed
his 50th camp, and the latter had not reached that number on the
outward route, and numbered his camps from the farthest point
attained on his return journey.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding a careful search, no traces of stock could be
found. This is, however, easily accounted for, as the country had
been inundated last season, though the current had not been
sufficiently strong to remove some emu bones and mussel-shells
which lay round a native camping-place within a few yards of the
spot.</p>
<p>No other indications having been found, we continued the
search down the river, examining every likely spot for marked
trees, but without success.</p>
<p>The general aspect of the country was extremely level, and
even the few distant ridges which were visible had but small
elevation above the plain, the highest apparently not exceeding
200 or 300 feet. Timber was wholly confined to the bank of the
river, and though open plains existed, acacia scrubs were the
principal feature. Water became very scarce in the channels of
the river, and we were principally dependent on small puddles of
rain-water from a recent thunder-shower, but as we approached the
northern bend some fine reaches of water were passed.</p>
<p>6<i>th April</i>.&mdash;In latitude 24° 2' we observed a small
dry creek joining from the N.E. This I traced upwards for a few
miles; but as its relative position with regard to the adjacent
country, as well as the latitude, did not correspond with that of
the Alice River on the chart, we continued oar route; finding,
however, that the general course of the river changed to S.W., I
left the party at a small lagoon and rode up the river again
(28<i>th April</i>), making a second search, more especially at
the junction of the small dry creek, which proved to be identical
with the Alice River, though more than five miles to the south,
as the Victoria River never reaches the parallel of 24°.</p>
<p>Our position was now becoming very critical, as a long
continuance of drought had not only dried up all the water,
except in the deepest hollows in the channel of the main river,
but the smaller vegetation, and even the trees on the back
country were annihilated, rendering the country almost
impracticable from the quantity of fallen dead branches, and even
in the bed of the river, where the inundation derived from heavy
rain near the sources of the river <span class="pagenum">{Page
23}</span> last year had somewhat refreshed the grass, it was
scarcely possible to find subsistence for the horses. Under
existing circumstances, it would have been certain destruction to
attempt a north-west route from this point; and the only course
that appeared open to us was to follow down the main river to the
junction of the Thompson River, and ascend that watercourse so as
to intersect Leichhardt's probable line of route, had he
penetrated in that direction, favoured by a better season. At the
same time it was probable that, like ourselves, he had been
repulsed, and would then follow down the river, and search for a
more favourable point from which to commence his north-west
course, in order to round the desert interior on its northern
side (29<i>th April</i>), and we therefore continued our search
down towards the Thompson River.</p>
<p>The country was perfectly flat on both sides of the river, and
showed traces of tremendous floods. The soil near the river was
often deeply-cracked mud, water very scarce, and grass seldom
seen. The back country was covered with scrubs of dead acacia,
the soil a red sand or gravel; and such was the unpromising
appearance that I began to fear our horses would soon fail for
want of food and water; but having camped at a water-hole during
Sunday (2<i>nd May</i>), to rest the party, heavy rain commenced,
and though the greater portion of the water was absorbed by the
dry soil, some of the channels of the river filled and commenced
to flow. This relieved us from much difficulty as regarded the
want of water, and enabled us to seek for grass in positions
which were otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p>3<i>rd May</i>.&mdash;Just as we were leaving our camp a party
of seven natives made their appearance, but, though they came up
to us, and talked much, I could get no useful information from
them. As the party moved on they followed us, and, thinking they
were not observed, made an attempt to throw a spear at one of the
men; but Mr. C. Gregory wheeling his horse quickly and presenting
a revolver at the intending aggressors, they ran away and left us
to pursue our journey in peace.</p>
<p>The abundance of water was not without its inconveniences, and
had the rain continued the party would have been annihilated, as
our camp was between the deep channels which intersected the
plain; and in attempting to extricate ourselves from the plains
subject to inundation (4<i>th May</i>), found ourselves so
completely entangled among the numerous deep channels and boggy
gullies, in some of which the horses narrowly escaped suffocation
in the soft mud, that after having forded one branch of the
river, carrying the whole equipment across on our own backs,
constructing a bridge over a second for the transport of the
stores, and dragging the horses <span class="pagenum">{Page
24}</span> through as we best could with ropes, after three days
of severe toil we had scarcely accomplished a direct distance of
five miles (6<i>th May</i>).</p>
<p>The dry weather which followed rapidly hardened the surface of
the clay plains, and I attempted to steer due west to the
Thompson, but found the country so destitute of feed, and covered
with dense acacia scrub, that we were compelled to return to the
plains on the bank of the river.</p>
<p>8<i>th May</i>.&mdash;The valley of the river trending west
was somewhat contracted, and did not exceed five or six miles in
breadth; the plains were firmer, salt-bush and grass more
abundant, and the horses recovered slightly from the effects of
the barren country.</p>
<p>Keeping back from the right bank of the main channel, we
passed some ridges of drift sand, and came on a fine lagoon
nearly a mile in length. Here we surprised a party of natives,
who decamped on our approach, leaving a net, fish, &amp;c., which
we of course left untouched, and camped at a spot lower down the
lagoon.</p>
<p>9<i>th May</i>.&mdash;The next day, being Sunday, we remained
at our camp, and the party of natives, consisting of seven or
eight men, three or four women, and some children, approached us,
and remained the greater part of the day near the tents. They
were very anxious to enter the camp, but this was not
permitted.</p>
<p>By signs they expressed that they had observed we had not
taken away any of their property the evening before, when they
ran away and left their nets, and were therefore satisfied our
intentions were friendly; but we could not procure any
information relative to the objects of our journey or the
character of the country before us.</p>
<p>At 4 P.M. they informed us they were going to sleep at the
most distant part of the lagoon, and would return next morning at
sunrise, and then departed.</p>
<p>9<i>th May</i>.&mdash;After dark, however, the natives were
detected attempting to crawl into the camp through the bushes,
and though we called to them in an unmistakeable tone to retire,
they would not withdraw.</p>
<p>As the position they had taken up was such as to command our
camp, and render it unsafe in the event of an attack, it was
necessary to dislodge them. I therefore fired a pistol over them,
but was answered by a shout of derision, which no doubt would
have been soon followed by a shower of spears had we not
compelled them to retreat by a discharge of small shot directed
into the scrub, after which we were not further molested.</p>
<p>10<i>th May</i>.&mdash;We were now approaching the junction of
the Thompson River, but the country became worse as we advanced,
<span class="pagenum">{Page 25}</span> and the last 5 miles of
the plain were absolutely devoid of vegetation. Our hopes were,
however, raised on finding that the late rain had caused the
Thompson to flow, though the current was not strong; we had,
besides, to travel upwards of 12 miles up its course before any
grass could be found for the horses.</p>
<p>11<i>th May</i>.&mdash;Continuing our route up the Thompson,
nothing could be more desolate than the aspect of the country:
except the few trees which grew on the immediate bank of the
river, there was scarcely a tree left alive, while the plains
were quite bare of vegetation, except a few salsolaceous bushes.
At the distance of 5 miles low ridges of red drift sand showed
the desert character of all around; even the lower surfaces of
the clouds assumed a lurid tinge from the reflection of the bare
surface of red sand.</p>
<p>12<i>th May</i>.&mdash;In latitude 24° 40' low sandstone
hills, or rather table-land, approached both banks of the river,
and the gullies which intersected them had supplied the water
lower down, as the channel was dry above. We, however, succeeded
in reaching latitude 23° 47' (15<i>th May</i>), when the absence
of water and grass&mdash;the rain not having extended so far
north, and the channels of the river separating into small
gullies and spreading on the wide plains&mdash;precluded our
progressing farther to the north or west; and the only prospect
of saving our horses was to return south as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>This was a more severe disappointment, as we had just reached
the part of the country through which Leichhardt most probably
travelled, if the season was sufficiently wet to render it
practicable.</p>
<p>Thus compelled to abandon the principal object of the
expedition, only two courses remained open&mdash;either to return
to the head of the Victoria River and attempt a northern course
by the valley of the "Belyando," or to follow down the river and
ascertain whether it flowed into "Cooper Creek" or the Darling.
The latter course appeared most desirable, as it was just
possible that Leichhardt, under similar circumstances, had been
driven to the S.W.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain whether any large watercourses came from
the west, the return route was along the right bank of the
Thompson, but only one small creek and some inconsiderable
gullies joined on that side; nor was the country of a better
character than on the left bank&mdash;consisting of barren
plains, subject to inundation, low rocky ridges covered with
dense scrub, and sandy ridges producing triodia.</p>
<p>22<i>nd May</i>.&mdash;We had nearly reached the Barcu, or
Victoria River, when, in crossing a gully, Worrell's horse fell
and hurt him so severely that we had to halt for some time before
he could be placed <span class="pagenum">{Page 26}</span> on his
horse again, and it was therefore fortunate that a small patch of
dry grass was found on the bank of the river, which enabled us to
halt the next day (23<i>rd May</i>), which was Sunday.</p>
<p>Travelling down the right bank of the river the principal
channels were full of water, but the clay plains between were
quite dry, the rain which had caused the river to flow not having
extended so far south; nothing could well be more desolate than
the unbounded level of these vast plains, which, destitute of
vegetation, extended to the horizon. Our horses were reduced to
feeding on the decayed weeds, and even these were so scarce that
they eagerly devoured the thatch of some old native huts.</p>
<p>27<i>th May</i>.&mdash;We had nearly reached the farthest
point attained by Mr. Kennedy when the horses showed signs of
failing strength, and the channels on the east side of the plain
being dry, I conceived it prudent to cross to the western side
again.</p>
<p>The dry mud was so deeply cracked that the horses were
continually falling, and one horse was so completely exhausted
that we had to abandon him.</p>
<p>28<i>th May</i>.&mdash;Steering a westerly, and then a north
course, we reached the small water-hole at Mr. Kennedy's second
camp on the return route; there was just sufficient water to
supply the party for one night, and a few scattered tufts of
grass near it, but quite insufficient for the supply of so large
a number of horses.</p>
<p>Close to the water-hole we found Mr. Kennedy's marked
tree;<span style=
"float:right; margin: 2px 10px 2px 20px; clear:right;"><a name=
"greg-1" id="greg-1"></a><img alt="" src=
"1305431h-images/greg-1.jpg"></span> it was a large box-tree, marked
on the north side thus: cuts of the axe and chisel were still
quite clear, though twelve years had elapsed; but the slow growth
and decay of trees in the interior may be attributed to the
dryness of the climate.</p>
<p>29<i>th May</i>.&mdash;Steering north-west, after toiling
nearly 30 miles across this fearful waste of dry mud, we at
length reached a small patch of grass on a sandy hummock, but
only just in time to save the horses, as many could scarcely keep
on their legs, and we had to remove their loads to those which
were less exhausted.</p>
<p>30<i>th May</i>.&mdash;Long before the next morning our hungry
animals had consumed every blade of grass, and the small patch
round the camp was reduced to the same barren appearance as the
surrounding plain. We therefore started in search of food for
them, and were fortunate in finding a second patch of grass,
about 3 miles to the south, and halted for the remainder of the
day, which was Sunday, thankful that Providence had enabled us to
make it a day of rest.</p>
<p>31<i>st May</i>.&mdash;The running channel of the river being
still to the west of our position we steered south-west, over
barren clay plains, to <span class="pagenum">{Page 27}</span>
some low ridges of drift sand, beyond which we found the channel
full of water, with a slight current (lat. 26° 2'); but it
terminated in a large reach of water which had not yet filled,
and the channel lower down was dry.</p>
<p>Low ridges of red drift sand were now frequent on the plain,
and appeared to be the higher points of the former sandy desert,
the clay plains resulting from the deposition of mud in the
hollows between which had in course of time filled it to one
uniform level.</p>
<p>1<i>st June</i>.&mdash;The channels on the western side of the
plain were very irregular, sometimes completely lost on the level
surface, and again collecting into large hollows, with box trees
on the banks, in which fine sheets of water still remained, some
100 yards wide and more than a mile in length. We therefore did
not experience so much inconvenience with regard to the supply of
this necessary element as from the absence of sufficient grass,
and the all but impracticable nature of the mud plains.</p>
<p>4<i>th June</i>.&mdash;In latitude 27° low sandstone
table-land approached the west side of the river, and we
attempted to travel along the slope between it and the mud
plains, but found it so stony that the horses' hoofs were soon
worn to the quick, as we had been compelled to remove their shoes
to enable them to traverse the mud plains.</p>
<p>Had it not been for green bushes of salsola, and some similar
plants which had sprung up since the rain, this tract of country
exactly resembled the stony desert described by Captain Sturt, as
existing 200 miles to the westward. These remarkable features
forming the declivities of the sandstone table-land through which
"Cooper Creek" forces its way, and by confining the waters to a
narrower space during floods, causes the fine deep reaches of
water which characterise it.</p>
<p>8<i>th June</i>.&mdash;By following the western limits of the
plains we reached latitude 27° 30', when the sandstone table-land
receded, and a boundless expanse of mud plain was before us; the
lines of box trees which had hitherto marked the channels nearly
ceased, polygonum and atriplex constituting the main feature of
the vegetation.</p>
<p>9<i>th June</i>.&mdash;After toiling S.W. a day and a half
over this level surface to latitude 27° 60', we approached some
low ridges, at the foot of which there was a lagoon 100 yards
wide, exhibiting signs of a current during flood to the N.W.; and
as there was an evident westerly trend in all the smaller
channels previously crossed, it was evident they would soon merge
in Cooper Creek.</p>
<p>Steering W.N.W. the several channels collected together, and
soon formed a deep watercourse, with fine reaches of water.</p>
<p>9<i>th June</i>.&mdash;-The sandstone table land closed in on
both sides; the <span class="pagenum">{Page 28}</span> soil of
the intervening plain was much firmer, but showed by the
vegetation that saline nature which so often attends the
development of the upper sandstones in Australia. Grass was
abundant, and it was surprising with what rapidity the horses
recovered their strength.</p>
<p>12<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Approaching the 141st meridian, which
is the boundary of the province of South Australia, stony ridges
closed in on both banks of Cooper Creek, forming almost a natural
division, across which we followed a well-beaten native path; and
here I observed the only instance which has come under ray
observation where the aborigines have taken the trouble to remove
natural obstacles from their paths. The loose stones had been
cleared from the track, and in some places piled in large
heaps.</p>
<p>14<i>th June</i>.&mdash;After passing the stony ridge the
valley became wider, the hills receding suddenly, in longitude
140° 30', both to the north and south; and the whole country to
the west seemed to consist of a succession of low ridges of red
sand and level plains of dry mud, subject to inundation.</p>
<p>Shortly before reaching the branch of Cooper Creek, named by
Captain Sturt "Strzelecki" Creek, we observed the tracks of two
horses, one apparently a carthorse and the other a well-bred
animal; but as none of their tracks were within the last month,
the rain had obliterated them to such an extent that they could
not be traced up, as they had left the bank of the creek on the
first fall of rain, as is the usual habit of horses whose
wanderings are uncontrolled.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that these horses belonged to
Captain Sturt, who left one in an exhausted state near this
locality, and also lost a second horse, whose tracks were
followed many miles in the direction of this part of Cooper
Creek.</p>
<p>"Strzelecki Creek," which separates nearly at a right angle
from the main channel, appears to convey about one-third of the
waters of Cooper Creek nearly south, and, as we afterwards
ascertained, connects it with Lake Torrens. We, however,
continued to follow the channels which trended west for 30 miles,
but large branches continually broke off to the south and west,
and at length (16<i>th June</i>) the whole was lost on the wide
plains of dry mud between the sand ridges; and, as there was no
prospect of either water or grass to the west, I steered south
and south-east for 50 miles over a succession of ridges of red
drift sand, 10 to 50 feet high, running parallel to each other,
and in a nearly north and south direction. Between these ridges
we occasionally found shallow puddles of rain-water, or rather
mud, as it was so thick with clay as to be scarcely fluid.
Fortunately, a great quantity of green weeds had grown up since
<span class="pagenum">{Page 29}</span> the rain, and the horses
improved in condition and did not require much water.</p>
<p>21<i>st June</i>.&mdash;In latitude 28° 24' we again came on
Strzelecki Creek, and then followed it nearly S.S.W. between
sandy ridges to latitude 29° 25', when it turned to the west and
entered Lake Torrens. (25<i>th June</i>.) No permanent water was
seen in the bed of the creek, though there are many deep hollows
which, when once filled, retain water for several months, and
this, combined with the existence of a fine reach of water in
Cooper Creek immediately above the point where Strzelecki Creek
branches off, renders it far the best line of route into the
interior which has yet been discovered.</p>
<p>Passing between the eastern point of Lake Torrens and what has
hitherto been considered the eastern arm, but now ascertained to
be an independent lake, the space between (about half a mile) was
level sandy ground, covered with salicornia, without any apparent
connecting channel. The course was continued S.S.W. towards Mount
Hopeless, at the northern extreme of the high ranges of South
Australia, which had been visible across the level country at a
distance of 60 miles.</p>
<p>26<i>th June</i>.&mdash;As we approached the range of hills
tracks of cattle and horses were observed, and 8 miles beyond
Mount Hopeless came to a cattle station which had been lately
established by Mr. Baker.</p>
<p>As the nature of the country we had traversed was such as not
to admit of any useful deviations from it if we returned to New
South Wales by land, I deemed it advisable to proceed forthwith
to Adelaide, and, disposing of the horses and equipment, return
with the party by sea to Sydney.</p>
<p>31<i>st July</i>.&mdash;We therefore proceeded by easy stages
towards Adelaide, experiencing the greatest hospitality at the
stations on our route, while our reception in the city was of the
most flattering nature.</p>
<p>His Excellency Sir Richard Macdonald kindly gave me the use of
an extensive paddock for the horses, and provided quarters for
the men during the period which necessarily elapsed before the
sale of the equipment of the expedition was effected. I have also
to express my acknowledgments of the kind assistance rendered by
the Honourable the Commissioner of Crown Lands, to the
Surveyor-General, and the Superintendent of Telegraphs for
valuable data connected with the construction of the map of the
route, as well as to many other gentlemen whose cordial
co-operation greatly facilitated my arrangements.</p>
<p>It is extremely gratifying to record my appreciation of the
untiring zeal and energy which distinguished every individual
composing the <span class="pagenum">{Page 30}</span> expedition;
and it is to the unvarying and cheerful alacrity with which each
and all performed their respective duties, that, under
Providence, the rapidity and success of the journey are to be
mainly attributed.</p>
<p>With reference to the probable fate of Leichhardt, it is
evident, from the existence of the marked camp, nearly 80 miles
beyond those seen by Mr. Hely, that the account given to that
gentleman by the natives of the murder of the party was untrue;
and I am inclined to think only a revival of the report current
during Leichhardt's first journey to Port Essington. Nor is it
probable that they were destroyed until they had left the
Victoria, as, if killed by the natives, the scattered bones of
the horses and cattle would have been observed during our
search.</p>
<p>I am therefore of opinion that they left the river at the
junction of the Alice, and, favoured by thunder showers,
penetrated the level desert country to the north-west; in which
case, on the cessation of the rain, the party would not only be
deprived of a supply of water for the onward journey, but unable
to retreat, as the shallow deposits of rain-water would evaporate
in a few days, and it is not likely that they would commence a
retrograde movement until the strength of the party had been
severely taxed in the attempt to advance.</p>
<p>The character of the country traversed, from the out-stations
on the Dawson River to the head of the Wan-ego River, was
generally that of a grassy forest, with ridges of dense brigalow
scrub. A great portion is available for pastoral purposes, but
not well watered; and the soil being sandy, the grass would soon
be destroyed if too heavily stocked.</p>
<p>As we advanced into the interior it became more barren, and,
except along the banks of the larger watercourses, destitute of
timber; and the character of the vegetation indicated excessive
droughts.</p>
<p>North of lat. 26° dense scrubs of acacia prevailed on the
level country beyond the influence of the inundations; but to the
southward sandy and stony deserts, with low shrubby vegetation,
were the characteristic feature.</p>
<p>West of longitude 147°, nearly to the boundary of South
Australia, in 141°, the country is unfit for occupation, for,
though in favourable seasons there might in some few localities
be abundance of feed for stock, the uncertainty of rain and
frequent recurrence of drought render it untenable, the grasses
and herbage being principally annuals, which not only die, but
are swept away by the hot summer winds, leaving the surface of
the soil completely bare.</p>
<p>On Cooper Creek, near the boundary, there is a small tract of
second-rate country, which, being abundantly supplied with water.
<span class="pagenum">{Page 31}</span> may eventually be
occupied. The best part is, however, within the Province of South
Australia.</p>
<p>Between Cooper Creek and Lake Torrens about 120 miles of sandy
country intervenes. This tract is destitute of surface water; but
as it is probable that it could be obtained by sinking wells of
moderate depth, I think it might be occupied to advantage during
the cool season, and thus relieve the stations which are now
established within Lake Torrens, though I fear that the summer
heat would be too great to admit of permanent occupation.</p>
<p>The geological character of the country is remarkably uniform.
Carboniferous sandstones and shales, containing occasional beds
of coal, with superincumbent hills and ridges of basalt, extend
from Darling Downs to the 146th meridian, where these rocks are
covered by horizontal sandstones, with beds of chert and
water-worn quartz pebbles. This latter formation extends as far
as Mount Hopeless, where the slate ranges of South Australia rise
abruptly from the plain.</p>
<p>The sandy deserts and mud plains are only superficial
deposits, as the sandstones are often exposed where the upper
formation is intersected by gullies.</p>
<p>The direction of the parallel ridges of drift sand appears to
be the result of the prevailing winds, and not the action of
water, it being sufficient to visit them on a windy day to be
convinced that it is unnecessary to seek for a more remote and
obscure cause than that which is in present operation.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, with reference to the physical geography of
Australia that the results of the expedition are most important;
as, by connecting successively the explorations of Sir T.
Mitchell, Mr. Kennedy, Captain Sturt, and Mr. Eyre, the waters of
the tropical interior of the eastern portion of the continent are
proved to flow towards Spencer Gulf, if not actually into it, the
barometrical observations showing that Lake Torrens, the lowest
part of the interior, is decidedly above the sea level.</p>
<p>Although only about one-third of the waters of Cooper Creek
flow into Lake Torrens by the channel of Strzelecki Creek, there
is strong evidence that the remaining channels, after spreading
their waters on the vast plains which occupy the country between
them and Sturt's Stony Desert, finally drain to the south,
augmented probably by the waters of "Eyre Creek," the "Stony
Desert," and perhaps some other watercourses of a similar
character coming from the westward.</p>
<p>This peculiar structure of the interior renders it improbable
that any considerable inland lakes should exist in connection
with the <span class="pagenum">{Page 32}</span> known system of
waters; for, as Lake Torrens is decidedly only an expanded
continuation of Cooper Creek, and therefore the culminating point
of this vast system of drainage, if there was sufficient average
fall of rain in the interior to balance the effects of
evaporation from the surface of an extensive sheet of water, the
"Torrens Basin," instead of being occupied by salt marshes, in
which the existence of anything beyond shallow lagoons of salt
water is yet problematical, would be maintained as a permanent
lake.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the waters flowing from so large a tract of
country are insufficient to meet the evaporation from the surface
of Lake Torrens, there is even less probability of the waters of
the western interior forming an inland lake of any magnitude,
even should there be so anomalous a feature as a depression of
the surface in which it could be collected, especially as our
knowledge of its limits indicates a much drier climate and less
favourable conformation of surface than in the eastern division
of the continent.</p>
<p>The undulations of the surface of the country are nearly
parallel to the meridian, gradually decreasing in height from the
dividing range between the eastern and western waters till,
instead of the waters of the rivers being confined to valleys,
they occupy plains formed by a slight flattening of the curvature
of the sphere. Thus the sides of the plain through which the
river ran before it turned west to Cooper Creek were 150 feet
below the tangential level of the centre channels, and even the
summit of the sandstone table land which rose beyond was below
the visible horizon.</p>
<p>It is this peculiar conformation which causes the stream beds
to spread so widely when following the course of the valleys from
north to south, and it is only where they break through the
intervening ridges that the water is confined sufficiently to
form well-defined channels.</p>
<p>The existence of these extensive valleys trending north and
south over so large a tract of country, renders it by no means
unlikely that they continue far beyond the limits of present
explorations, and it is not unreasonable to infer that the great
depression which has been traced nearly 500 miles north from
Spencer Gulf through Lake Torrens to the stony desert of Sturt
(or rather the mud plains contiguous to its western limit), may
be continuous for an equal distance beyond to the low land at the
head of the Gulf of Carpentaria; a theory also supported by the
fact, that the rivers flowing into the Gulf either come from the
east or west, apparently from higher land in those directions,
while there is not a single watercourse from the south, or any
indication of elevated country in that direction.</p>
<p>With regard to the number and habits of the aborigines, I
could <span class="pagenum">{Page 33}</span> gather little
information, as only a collective number of about 100 men, a few
women and children, were seen in small scattered parties; but,
judging from the number of encampments seen, at least a thousand
must visit the banks of the river; and it is probable that the
whole of the inhabitants for at least a hundred miles on each
side ai'e dependent on it for water during the dry season.</p>
<p>Neither sex wear any clothing. Their weapons and utensils are
similar to those used on the eastern coast; nor was there any
characteristic by which they could be observed to differ from the
aborigines of other portions of Australia.</p>
<p>Fish, rats, grass seeds, and a few roots, constitute their
chief food.</p>
<p>On the upper part of the river they bury their dead, piling
wood on the grave; near the junction of the Thompson they suspend
the bodies in nets, and afterwards remove the bones; while on
Cooper Creek the graves are mounds of earth 3 to 4 feet high,
apparently without any excavation, and surmounted by a pile of
dead wood. In the last-named locality the number of burial mounds
which had been constructed about two years ago greatly exceeded
the proportion of deaths which could have possibly occurred in
any ordinary season of mortality, even assuming the densest
population known in any other part of Australia; and it is not
improbable that the seasons of drought which proved so
destructive to the tree vegetation higher up the river may have
been equally disastrous in its effects on the aboriginal
inhabitants of this portion of the interior.</p>
<p align="right"><span class="a">A. C.

<blockquote><i>Sydney</i>, 27<i>th August</i>, 1858.<br>
<br>
The <span class="u">President</span>.&mdash;I am happy to hear
that the views of so experienced an Australian traveller as Mr.
Gregory coincide with the opinion I have so frequently expressed
as to the probable saline condition of the interior of Australia.
This is the same gentleman who performed that remarkable journey
from North Australia to Sydney, which obtained for him our Gold
Medal. He is the first man who has gone far to determine the
great problem, by journeys on three sides of Australia, that the
great interior is a saline desert.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Count Strzelecki, f.r.g.s.</span>&mdash;The
valuable paper which was just communicated to the Society
suggests at its outset a painful reminiscence, and as painful
regret that Mr. Gregory's expedition, undertaken with a view to
ascertain the fate of the deeply-lamented Leichhardt, has failed
in the humane object with which it was conceived, and that, like
the preceding ones, it only adds fresh evidences of the
indubitable loss which the public has sustained. The services of
Leichhardt deserved indeed all the efforts which New South Wales
has been making in search of him. In about 1840, while I was
engaged in surveying the south of that colony, Leichhardt began
his career of an explorer in the north of Moreton Bay: in 1846 he
undertook and accomplished the perilous journey across from
Brisbane waters to Port Essington which, from its dangers,
privations, and value of geographical discoveries earned for him
the well-deserved honours which this Society and the colony so
justly bestowed upon him. Unfortunately, in the end or the
commencement <span class="pagenum">{Page 34}</span> of 1847,
Leichhardt fell a prey to his praiseworthy attempt to traverse
the continent from Moreton Bay to Swan River. His loss originated
then a series of expeditions, among which that of Mr. Gregory
deserves a most prominent place and notice from the range of
scientific knowledge which it furnishes of the Australian
continent. For although his expedition did not lead to the
discovery of Leichhardt's traces, his different journeys from the
north-east and south-east, performed towards the centre, girdle
as it wore the mysterious and impenetrable region of the interior
of Australia, and facilitate thus the solution of that
geographical problem. Considering then the services rendered to
science by Mr. Gregory, this Society cannot but join cordially in
the thanks to that distinguished explorer which are proposed to
him from the chair.</blockquote>

1858</span></h4>
<p align="center">LEICHHARDT AND THE DESERT.[&mdash;(1)<br>
<br>
<i>To the Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald.</i></p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your interesting leader
of this morning on the subject of Mr. Gregory's recent journey
from Moreton Bay to Adelaide, I find these words: "That the
Victoria River joined the stream which Captain Sturt has called
Cooper's Creek was considered as nearly certain by all who paid
attention to the matter; <i>but it was thought that their united
waters found their way to the Darling, somewhere in the
neighbourhood of Mount Murchison. It appears, however, that their
real outlet is Lake Torrens</i>."</p>
<p>This must have been written in forgetfulness of certain
geographical papers and reviews on the subject of the
explorations of Mitchell, Kennedy, Sturt, Leichhardt, &amp;c.,
which appeared in your columns during the years 1848 and 1849. In
one of them, in the Herald of June 23, 1849, we read as follows:
"It seems a curious thing that four explorers should have traced
its course in portions, and, yet, that there should be so many
gaps. Mitchell, Kennedy, Sturt, and Eyre have seen it from its
beginning to its ending, but neither one nor all continuously.
<i>But its termination in the channel of Lake Torrens, to which
it runs</i>, is very different from what was anticipated at the
time of its discovery, <i>though just that which the almost
parallel courses of the rivers forming the Darling would
naturally indicate</i>."</p>
<p>I am induced to notice this, because the journey of Mr.
Gregory has <i>proved</i> that the views entertained of the
natural courses of the rivers flowing on the interior border of
New South Wales (which views, however, were disputed at the
time), and which were repeatedly mentioned by <i>one writer</i>
in your columns, were well founded. So many events have occurred
within the last few years, to call off attention from the
<i>geographical</i> conditions of this great continent, that it
may have escaped recollection how <i>that writer</i> showed, by
fair demonstration, that the rivers in question could, in
consequence of the peculiar structure of the country, take no
other course than to the south-west, though, in spite of his own
discoveries and calculations of level, the late Surveyor-General
insisted upon these waters finding their way to the Gulf of
Carpentaria. No one who had really studied the structure of
Australia could believe that the Victoria would ever join the
Darling; and it was stated in your columns that it would be found
following a distinct course to the head of Spencer's Gulf.</p>
<p>Captain Sturt, reviewing at the end of his narrative the
discoveries of Kennedy, in connection with his own, comes to a
conclusion, which made him doubt his own original views. But, he
points out that Kennedy had shown that "just below where the
Alice joins the Victoria, the latter river had already commenced
its south-west course, and that the last thirty miles down which
the Surveyor-General traced this river, was a <i>part</i> of the
general <i>south-west</i> course, which it afterwards maintained
to the termination of Mr. Kennedy's route," &amp;c.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory's two journeys have satisfactorily established two
points. He has shown, by adopting Leichhardt's general line from
the Roper River to Moreton Bay, that that traveller's account of
his journey from Moreton Bay to the Roper River is in the main
correct; and by following down the Barcoo (Mitchell's Victoria)
to Cooper's Creek, and finally to Lake Torrens, he has filled up
the gaps alluded to above, and shown that the structure of this
country is of a very simple and consistent kind, as previously
suggested.</p>
<p>The rapid manner in which Mr. Gregory has accomplished his
undertaking is deserving of all praise; but, of course, that has
deprived him of the means of investigation as to any value of the
country traversed in respect of its mineral resources. The chief
value of these rapid journeys is, however, in this.</p>
<p>To Mr. Gregory we are indebted for the outlines of the
northern and eastern borders of the central desert, and all
conjecture having now been set at rest on those points, we have
it in our power to define the actual limits of available land to
the west and north-west of New South Wales.</p>
<p>But, as regards the supposed chief object of the last journey,
viz., a search for Leichhardt, it must be held that, owing to the
peculiar nature of the late and present season, such
investigation has been frustrated.</p>
<p>I will now offer a suggestion respecting that investigation.
Occupied, as I have been, for nearly twenty years in the study of
the physical character of Australia, the explorations and
discoveries that have been made have continually engaged my
leisure hours, and, therefore, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for
touching on this subject. My intimate acquaintance with most of
the explorers has also led to discussions and correspondence with
them on the proposed routes beforehand and on the results
afterwards. Now, as touching Leichhardt, I am persuaded his
remains have not been sought for in the right direction.</p>
<p>Previous to his last departure from Sydney, he was on a visit
to me; and we occupied some time in collecting information on the
<i>possibility</i> of his overland journey to Swan River. Over
and over again he stated to me, that he would never again see
Syd[n]ey, unless he came from the Swan River. And when I pointed
out to him the great improbability that a direct route existed,
by means of <i>oases</i> in the desert, which was a favourite
idea of his, he built very much upon a fact mentioned by Mr.
Gregory (or his brother), in his account of the country to the
north-east of Perth, that a great accumulation of bones of
supposed buffaloes had been met with. Leichhardt insisted that
these were not the bones of buffaloes, but of <i>bullocks</i>,
which had crossed the country from the western frontier of this
colony. And he argued, that if cattle could get across, it must
have been by <i>oases</i>, where grass would be found, and that
he could cross also.</p>
<p>But, after a great deal of consideration, he said it would be
better to <i>skirt the desert</i>, and that, therefore, his final
intention was to follow up the Burdekin to the river he named
after myself, and proceed from the head of the Clarke, which he
had not seen, to the westward, and so attempt to reach the
country where the bones where found, by crossing the tract along
the north-west end west coast, which, so far, as I believe,
offers very little hope of success in any season.</p>
<p>That this was always in the mind of Leichhardt may be inferred
from what he himself published respecting his <i>second</i>
expedition, from which he was driven back by fever:&mdash;"The
object of the new expedition here alluded to, is to explore the
interior of Australia, to <i>discover the extent of Sturt's
Desert</i>, and <i>the character of the western and north-western
coast</i>, and to observe the gradual change in vegetation and
animal life, from one side of the continent to the other. Dr.
Leichhardt does not expect to be able to accomplish this
<i>overland journey to Swan River</i>"&mdash;(i.e. by way of the
bounds of Sturt's Desert, the west and north-west coasts) "in
less than two years and a half. . . . According to a letter
written by him on the eve of his departure (December 6, 1846.") .
. . "He then purposed <i>to travel over his old route as far as
Peak Range</i>, and then to shape his course westwards, but
thought it not impossible, as his course depends on <i>water</i>,
that he should be obliged to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria and
then follow up some river to its source."&mdash;<i>Appendix to
Journal</i>, p. 544.</p>
<p>It is quite clear from this that he would never rashly venture
into the desert, and it is not impossible that he might have been
dead or dying nearer to the North-west Victoria*, from which Mr.
Gregory started on 21st June, 1856, than to the Victoria
(Barcoo), where Mr. Gregory found the letter L in 1858.</p>
<p class="foot">[* North-west Victoria is that which Mr. Gregory
visited in 1856.]</p>
<p>My impression is, therefore, that Leichhardt never attempted
to cross by way of Mitchell's Victoria.</p>
<p>There is another reason why I think he would not. A great
jealousy existed between the two explorers: Sir Thomas called
Leichhardt&mdash;adding an expressive expletive&mdash;"a ....
<i>foreign coaster</i>"&mdash;alluding to his habit of keeping as
near the sea as possible&mdash;and under this impression he
removed one of Leichhardt's mountain ranges (Expedition Range) a
<i>whole degree of longitude</i> out of the place to which he had
assigned it. This may be seen on Sir Thomas' General Map of his
expeditions up to the year 1850. A similar feeling would have
kept Leichhardt from following Mitchell's tracks; and yet it is
at the junction of the Alice and Barcoo, where the united waters
run south-west, that Mr. Gregory looked for traces of his
outward-bound course. The letter L carved on a tree in longitude
146.6 is not likely to be Leichhardt's, because he was in the
habit of marking all his camps, and only this has been found. It
might, perhaps, have been the mark of <i>Luff</i>, who
accompanied Kennedy.</p>
<div>The spot is close to the camp of Sir Thomas Mitchell of the
17th September, 1845; and of Kennedy's camp on 29th July, 1847.
Sir Thomas Mitchell repassed the locality the day he gave to the
river its name. Kennedy himself does not appear to have marked
his camp till his arrival at his furthest point, which was on the
9th September, and then his mark was</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<table class="2">
<tr>
<td align="center">E K<br>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div>the next camp upwards bearing KII. On looking over his
journal, which I prepared for the press, I find Luff was
frequently out with him.</div>
<br>
<p>It is not impossible, however, that some stockmen may have
been there; expeditions of that kind are not uncommon, and the
late Mr. Nelson Lawson told me that his stockmen at Fort Bourke,
on the Darling, had been in this way across the country as far as
what is now known as Mount Lyell, which was one of the points
made by Sturt in his last expedition into Central Australia. No
dependence then can, I think, be put on the solitary L, in
longitude 146°. And I am still of opinion that the remains of
Leichhardt's expedition, seeing the cattle have not returned,
will, if ever, be found far away to the north-westward, of any
search yet made.</p>
<p>As conjectures can do harm, it may be farther observed that
Kennedy commenced his exploration of the unknown portion of the
river on the 13th August, and he again reached his camp of July
29th (146°E), on the 12th October, during which interval he
remained ten days in camp at different places, making the
locality in question the <i>fiftieth</i> of his camps. This might
account for the L. But there is a fact mentioned by him, under
date of 12th August, which seems to show that a visitor had been
on the Victoria since Sir T. Mitchell; for not very far distant
from his farthest point, and where he had never been, in a spot
too rough for pleasant riding, Kennedy came upon <i>horse
dung</i> in two places near the river, and Mitchell, he says, as
the charts also show, kept wide of the river there for three
days. Sir Thomas also says, that even there the chief of the
native tribe had possession of an "iron tomahawk, with a very
long handle to it." This is on a river unknown, as he thought,
till then to the white man! According to Mitchell's account of
the "large permanent huts of the natives," even the saplings,
&amp;c., seen by Mr. Gregory might be either the remains of a
temporary hut, or of a native hut, as well as of Leichhardt. At
any rate, it is very unlikely that he is living; and all the
stories about his captivity appear to me idle speculation. The
parties who accompanied Leichhardt were, perhaps, little capable
of shifting for themselves in case of any accident to the leader.
The second in command, a brother-in-law of Leichhardt, came from
Germany to join him just before starting; and <i>he</i> told me,
when I asked him what his qualifications for the journey were,
that he had been at sea, had suffered shipwreck, and was
therefore well able to endure hardship. I do not know what his
other qualifications were. Leichhardt himself was of <i>weak
sight</i>, afflicted with a troublesome complaint, and, if we are
to believe the statements of those who were with him, by no means
a good bushman. That under such circumstances, he ever found his
way through the desert, where opthalmia is so general an enemy,
is improbable; but knowing his ideas of exploration, and having
conversed on the topic with him, I feel convinced, that he never
attempted the desert where he has been looked for, and that it is
not improbable that some of his camps, which Mr. Gregory found on
his homeward journey from the north-west coast, are likely to
have been his camps on his third and last expedition.</p>
<p>It is this problem which I hope will yet be solved; and
perhaps when the gold-fields, which will some day be discovered
about the Burdekin River, and its higher affluents, shall have
attracted population into that region, we shall know more of the
fate of my poor friend than we are likely to do from what has
hitherto been accomplished.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory might, perhaps, be able to tell whether the L in
146° E. is of more recent date than those he saw on the
north-west route; and whether these were all of the same epoch.
The remains of saplings, used for a temporary shelter, might also
teach something. The experience Leichhardt had of the danger of
<i>housing</i>, in the case of <i>Gilbert</i>, who lost his life
owing to his living under cover, made him shy of useless
covering, which also concealed the blacks who might come upon
him.</p>
<p>I have not written this with the very slightest idea of
depreciating Mr. Gregory, with whose acquaintance I am honoured
and for whom I entertain the greatest respect; but at this
juncture, it seems right to state plainly what are the opinions
of one, who has given as much attention as most persons in the
colony, to the subject in hand, who has contributed very much to
the general information on the physical geography of the
continent, and whose intercourse with <i>all</i> the explorers of
the last twenty years has been considerable.</p>

<h4>5.2. Clarke's Letter to <i>S.M.H</i>., 5 August, 1858</h4>
<p align="center">LEICHHARDT AND THE DESERT.[&mdash;(2)]<br>
<br>
<em>To the Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald.</em></p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>, I am not in the habit of writing
of others, dead or alive, that which requires an apology. Nor do
I ever say of them that which I cannot, so far as I believe,
substantiate. Mr. Richard Thompson, however, states that he has
"read with much pain" what I said in my letter in Friday's
<i>Herald</i>, viz., that "a great jealousy existed between the
two explorers," viz., Sir T. L. Mitchell and Dr. Leichhardt. It
will give me much pleasure if I am enabled to remove the pain I
have unintentionally inflicted.</p>
<p>Probably, had Mr. Thompson given me credit for using the word
"jealous" in any but the worst sense of the word, he would have
been nearer the mark; but, overlooking the sense in which it was
used, as connected with exploration, and that of a particular
portion of this country, he has assumed that I apply it in a
sense which it is not capable of bearing under the circumstances
involved.</p>
<p>Cicero tells us that jealousy is this: <i>Aegritudo si eo quod
concupieret alius patiatur, ipse careat</i>. "Jealous" is
defined, in Crabbe's English Synonymes, in this way. "The jealous
man has an object of desire, something to get and something to
retain: he does not look beyond the object that interferes with
his enjoyment." "Jealousy," he adds, "is a noble or an ignoble
passion, according to the object: in the former case it is
emulation; sharpened by fear; in the latter case it is
greediness, stimulated by fear." Now, it was not in the latter,
but in the former case, I used the word; the same sense in which
I found it in the lexicons of our mother-tongue&mdash;"Emulous,
full of competition."</p>
<p>I was endeavouring to assign my reasons for believing that
Leichhardt never ventured into the desert; one of which was, that
his habit of exploration was to keep nearer the sea, and I
illustrated this by quoting the remark made to me by Sir Thomas
(and also made to others), and his act in removing, from the
place assigned to it, the Expedition Range a degree nearer the
sea than it held on the original chart of Leichhardt's journey.
And I said, that a great jealousy existed.</p>
<p>In order to prove that Sir T. Mitchell was not jealous of
Leichhardt, in the matter of his exploration, Mr. Thompson, by a
logic of his own, tells us, that Captain Ferry drafted
Leichhardt's chart; that Captain Perry defended Leichhardt's
exploration; that Mr. Roderick Mitchell offered to go in search
of Leichhardt, and other things of like kind. And he then says,
that I have expressed, as "imputation," that which, as regards
the late Sir T. Mitchell, he declares to be "unfounded."</p>
<p>I can assure Mr. Thompson that I have too many recollections
of services rendered by Sir Thomas to myself, and of the
conversations I have had with him, and of letters received from
him, to desire to say any thing unfounded respecting him. During
the period I had the honour of his acquaintance in England, which
commenced before I had come to this colony, I have had to
acknowledge many little attentions, which I do not overlook; but
I cannot say that I think he was free from jealousy respecting
his own particular status as an explorer, nor respecting that
particular exploration to which I was alluding. Sir Thomas was
celebrated for energy, perseverance, intellect, and acquirement;
he was a scholar and a poet; but he was a man for all that. And
never did he show his relationship to our common humanity more
than in this very matter which Mr. Thompson disputes, and for my
opinion of which he condemns me.</p>
<p>Every man "has his hobby"&mdash;no doubt Mr. Thompson has his
own, I have mine, and Sir. T. Mitchell had his. That was, his
idea that be should some day get to Carpentaria. This seems to
have been his day-dream, and his vision by night. It was
undoubtedly a "noble" ambition to attain this point. He saw the
advantages which would eventually accrue to this country if a
route could be opened thither; and his volumes are full of it.
If, then, the "object" was "noble," according to the definition
above, even "jealousy" of other explorers was not altogether an
"ignoble passion."</p>
<p>So strongly was the impression on his mind, that a practical
river-way did exist to the Gulf, that it led to Sir Thomas's
expedition into tropical Australia in 1845 and 1846.</p>
<p>In the account of that expedition, we read as
follows:&mdash;(He is speaking of his return from the exploration
of the river Belyando, now determined by Mr. Gregory to be the
Suttor of Leichhardt)&mdash;"I reluctantly ordered my men (who
believed themselves on the highway to Carpentaria) to turn the
horses' heads homewards, merely saying that we were obliged to
explore from a higher point." And, having come to a conclusion,
that he ought, instead of seeking "it in this east coast river to
have sought the River of Carpentaria to the westward of all the
sources of the river Salvator;" he then got on the Nive, which is
now known to ran to the south (since it joins the Warrego) into
the desert, and of this, he says&mdash;"I verily believed that
<i>this</i> river would run to Carpentaria." Next we find him on
the head of the Victoria, and if the enthusiasm with which he
hailed the first sight of this river, which he called the noblest
in Australia (for which reference may be made to his reports to
the Government, and to his "Tropical Australia") do not prove,
that he must have been jealous for the honor of his own designs,
I confess I do not understand what I am writing. "What was all
this," he says "to the romantic uncertainty as to what lay
beyond?" "There, I found then, at last, the realization of my
long cherished hopes, an interior river, falling to the N.W., in
the heart of an open country extending in that direction. Ulloa's
delight on the first view of the Pacific could not have surpassed
mine on this occasion, nor could the fervour with which he was
impressed at the moment have exceeded my sense of gratitude, for
being allowed to make such a discovery." [p. 309.]</p>
<p>Sir Thomas told me himself, that when he saw the first streaks
of daylight reflected from the distant waters, he fell upon his
knees, raised his hat, and offered his thanks to God for the
discovery he had made. Yet, the very same day, after he had
reached this extraordinary river, he could get no water for his
horse. A week afterwards he writes, "I laid down our journey on
paper, and found we were making great progress towards
Carpentaria, across a very open country." In spite, however, of
this, the Victoria did not run to Carpentaria at all, but to the
southwards; and, though Sir Thomas left it, where its bed was
only 633 feet above the sea, he still saw it at that point
running nearly northward, though it immediately after took the
course which led Kennedy into the desert, and Gregory to Cooper's
Creek. Notwithstanding all doubts, he wrote to the Colonial
Secretary, "although I could not follow the river throughout its
long course at that advanced season, I was convinced that its
estuary was in the Gulf of Carpentaria. At all events the country
is open and well watered for a direct route thereto. That the
river is the most important of Australia, increasing as it does
by successive tributaries, and not a mere product of distant
ranges, admits of no dispute; and the downs and plains of Central
Australia, through which it flows, seem sufficient to supply the
whole world with animal food."</p>
<p>This is, however, not all. In the instructions issued by Sir
Thomas to Mr. Kennedy, 22nd February, 1847, respecting his
exploration of the Victoria, he wrote: "But the principal object
of the journey being the determination of the course of the
Victoria, and the discovery of a convenient route to the head of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, the accomplishment of these great
objects must be steadily kept in view, without regard to minor
considerations. . . . On arriving at or near the Gulf of
Carpentaria," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now, I think I have shown quite enough to prove that
Carpentaria was a kind of scientific lady-love of the late
Surveyor-General; and I do not think the word jealous at all too
strong to represent his feelings at the idea, that another would
supplant him in the attainment of his coveted object. I now come
to that point.</p>
<p>But, before I touch on it, I must take the liberty of stating
an anecdote, which <i>confirms</i> what I have just written, and
what I aver on the honor of a gentleman. Previous to Sir Thomas'
departure on his expedition to the Victoria, I called on him at
his office, and had conversation with him respecting the probable
condition of the country in the parallel of 25·. I took with me
an ideal section, and showed him that I believed the country in
that parallel would end abruptly to the westward. He took the
paper and put it away, and said he would keep it to refer to, and
would tell me how it was when he returned.</p>
<p>On his return I called on him to offer my congratulations, and
to chat over his discoveries. He said, "You were right about the
25th degree, and it was there I found the Victoria." I said to
him that river can never go to Carpentaria; you left it at 633
feet above the sea&mdash;less than 500 miles from the Gulf, and
as the curvature is more than 300 feet, how is it to get thither,
even if no ranges for the Gulf waters intervene? His reply was
emphatic: "Then, . . . ., Sir, I will make it."</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson has given us a detail about matters connected
with Leichhardt's chart of his journey to Port Essington-what Sir
George Gipps said, and what Captain Perry did, &amp;c. Now all
this, save the opinion of Sir George, I have long known.</p>
<p>It is quite true that at first Leichhardt was to have joined
Sir Thomas in a subordinate capacity; for, referring to a letter,
dated December, 1843, from Mr. Lynd, the Barrack Master of
Sydney, to Leichhardt, I find the former says: "You will have
heard that the Governor has stopped for the present all idea or
the overland expedition. I am sorry for it on all accounts, but
especially on yours, as I understand Sir T. Mitchell had felt
disposed to associate you in that concern, had you desired. The
Governor has good reasons for his conduct, which I will explain
when we meet."</p>
<p>Now, when it is considered, that Leichhardt was a
<i>foreigner</i>, and undertook, as chief, that which was denied
to Sir Thomas with Leichhardt as a subaltern, it may be conceived
that jealousy respecting Carpentaria might occur. Much more,
then, when Leichhardt's journey was <i>un fait accompli</i>, may
we, without doing injustice to the memory of Sir Thomas, think
there was a jealous expression in the following words, which we
find in his journal under date of 2nd June, 1846, written on the
Maranoa, not very many miles from the spot assumed by Mr. Hely to
be the scene of Leichhardt's death. "Mr Kennedy had brought me a
dispatch from Commissioner Mitchell, accompanied by some
newspapers, in which I read such passages as the
following:-'Australia Felix and the discoveries of Sir Thomas
Mitchell now dwindle into comparative insignificance.' 'We
understand the intrepid Leichhardt is about to start on another
expedition to the Gulf, keeping to the westard of the coast
ranges,' &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; and then, he adds, 'Not very
encouraging to us certainly; but we work for the future.'</p>
<p>Surely, these words, at least, convey a feeling very much akin
to what most people would call jealousy&mdash;although I think
them nothing but reasonable, and just what, under similar
circumstances, Mr. Thompson might himself feel.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson thinks this not probable, because Captain Perry,
as Deputy Surveyor-General, drafted the map of Leichhardt's
route. I really do not see the <i>sequitur</i>. This, I believe,
that Sir Thomas was not in Sydney at the time; and this I know,
that Captain Perry told me Sir Thomas was annoyed and angry he
had done so. Again, Mr. Thompson says that, because Captain Perry
praised Leichhardt's perseverance, therefore there could be no
such feeling as I have named; and he quotes the fact, that
Leichhardt named a river The Mitchell, as if the jealousy alluded
to ought to have ended in the ignoring of all by each. This is,
however, clear, that though Leichhardt, as he says, "took the
liberty of naming after Sir Thomas Mitchell, the talented
Surveyor-General of New South Wales," the river which now bears
his name, Sir Thomas has nowhere returned the compliment, nor has
he admitted anything but Expedition Range to appear, which
Leichhardt discovered. But Sir Thomas might not have intended
unfriendliness by this.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson seems to think, too, that because Sir Thomas
Mitchell, like every other Christian man, felt deep regret at the
loss of Leichhardt; therefore, in the matter of the letter's
previous success there could be no such jealousness as I have
named. Does he, then, believe that I have such a bad opinion of
Sir Thomas, as to consider himself worse than the savages; or
that an English knight had none of the feelings of an English
gentleman about him? I maintain again that there was a jealousy
between the "two explorers," but not that kind of jealousy which
is only appreciable by people of a certain disposition. I meant
no more than I have said; and I now say again, what I
meant,&mdash;that I do not believe Sir Thomas Mitchell would have
followed in Leichhardt's tracks (as proved by his return from the
Belyando so soon as he was convinced it was a "river on M.
Leichhardt's route," &amp;c.); nor do I believe Leichhardt, who,
in his way, was as great an explorer as Mitchell, and who kept up
his dignity when in the field, would follow the track, of the
latter to his own destruction.</p>
<p>I shall have something more to say on that subject another
time; my business now being to dispose of Mr. Thompson's
condemnation of me, I confine myself to it. But I cannot close
this letter without two further remarks.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson depreciates Leichhardt's map&mdash;says it was
Captain Perry's, and that Captain Perry derived but "very meagre
aids in the vignette illustrations of Leichhardt." Did, then,
Captain Perry draw the map from imagination? I know
this:&mdash;Leichhardt mapped down his route after his own
method, by latitudes, bearings, and distances. That route was
worked from the map by Captain Perry; and Captain Perry, shewing
it to me, said he was satisfied with its general accuracy, for it
fitted in well with acknowledged positions. In this matter, Sir
Thomas Mitchell was even more generous than Mr. Thompson. He says
in a note at p. 4 (Tropical Australia), "the journal of his
journey, recently published, shows what difficulties may be
surmounted by energy and perseverance." All this is, however,
compatible with a jealous feeling respecting the first discovery
of a way to Carpentaria.</p>
<p>Finally, that Sir Thomas Mitchell did alter the position of
Expedition Range in his chart from the place assigned by
Leichhardt or (if Mr. Thompson would rather have it so) by the
Deputy Surveyor-General, Captain Perry, is patent to all who
compare the chart appended to Leichhardt's work and which was
embodied by the critical Arrowsmith), with the General Map of
1850 by Sir T. Mitchell, and he will further see that on the
latter there is added on the place of the range, "from Mann's
survey."</p>
<p>Now, how was this? The same Sir Thomas who was (at any rate)
jealous of his authority as a leader, displaces a feature from
the map of another leader on the strength of the private
information of a subordinate, who could no more have surveyed the
spot (in the sense supposed by Mr. Thompson) than Leichhardt
himself.</p>
<p>It so happens that I have at this moment lying before me the
MS. journal of Mr. Mann, who accompanied Leichhardt on his second
expedition to Peak Range; and I find this entry under date of
Monday, 8th February, 1847. "At 10 miles cross Erythrina Creek,
below its junction with Expedition Creek. The Dr. reconnoitred
after dinner; found we were on Erythrina Greek, and about 3 miles
from a former camp." (That of 9th December, 1844.) He then gives
the latitude 24·44.</p>
<p>Thus, then, Mann confirms the latitude. And, as to
<i>longitude</i>, Mann notes next day that "<i>Mount
Nicholson</i> was due south, a fine, bold, flattish-topped
mountain 2000 feet at least high."</p>
<p>Could two expeditions be thus in general agreement, if the
longitude is out a whole degree and the error not be discovered,
especially by one who was well able to detect it?</p>
<p>I must leave all this to the judgment of the reader; but I
think Mr. Thompson might have left the word <i>jealous</i> where
it was, without any detriment to the subject.</p>
<p>The displacement of the range was under the conviction that
the explorer was nearer to the sea than Captain Perry's chart
made him; and I well recollect that the late Admiral King told me
that Sir Thomas had said to him, also, that Leichhardt had, on
one occasion, got very close to the east coast.</p>
<p>If I have omitted to notice anything else, which ought to have
received due honour in Mr. Thompson's letter, I must beg him to
be kind enough, in consideration of the length to which this has
run, to accept the will for the deed.</p>

<h4>5.3. Clarke's Letter to <i>S.M.H</i>., 24 August, 1858</h4>
<p align="center">LEICHHARDT AND THE DESERT.[&mdash;(3)]<br>
<br>
<i>To the Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;The supplement to the
Government Gazette of 4th December, 1846, containing the
despatches of Sir T. L. Mitchell, "reporting the progress made by
the expedition under his command in exploring the <i>overland
route to Port Essington</i>," states that he advanced up the
Balonne River to Mount Abundance, in 26·39'30" S. and 148·40' E.;
and that he afterwards travelled down the Belyando, of which he
says, "Your Excellency may imagine with what disappointment I
then discovered that this river, which has brought us so far,
instead of leading to the Gulf of Carpentaria, was no other than
that which Mr. Leichhardt had called "the Cape, a river from the
West." Sir Thomas then states that "the Eastern Coast Range,
hitherto supposed to extend from Wilson's Promontory to Cape
York, is only imaginary," and "that there was no feature
deserving the name of a coast range to the westward of the
Belyando was too evident from the absence of any tributaries of
importance." He then "lost no time in renewing his search for the
River of Carpentaria," being satisfied that the S.W. course of
the rivers previously seen, and that of the Belyando reduced "the
probability that the waters falling still further westward form a
river running to the Gulf almost to a certainty." He next
reported that the Victoria, "he was convinced, had its estuary in
the Gulf of Carpentaria," and was a river "watering the best
portion of the largest island in the world." He found, he says,
"the country beautiful, and the party with him never suffered any
inconvenience from heat or want of water." He had "no collision
with the aborigines, although parties of them on different
occasions visited his party at the camp during his absence, and
very significantly declared, brandishing their spears or clubs,
that the country was theirs, and making signs to his men to quit
it and follow him." This was in 1846.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Surveyor-General was thus hampered with
the rivers on his way to Port Essington, Leichhardt had found his
way thither, by following the mountains between these rivers and
the sea, and coasting the southern border of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Hence, he obtained the <i>soubriquet</i> of the
"foreign-coaster."</p>
<p>Leichhardt, on this occasion, avoided the edge of the desert;
but had he not lost his horses in crossing the Roper River, he
would have seen it in returning. But he says: "The loss of these
was very heavy. I had to throw away the greatest part of my
botanical and geological collections; and my plan of <i>returning
overland</i>, cutting off the angles of my route and <i>keeping
more to the westward were frustrated</i>." This was in
1844-5.</p>
<p>That, however, which he could not do, has been since done by
Mr. Gregory, who in 1855-6 following on a line parallel to that
adopted by Leichhardt, that which he was prevented from adopting,
has given us the information which was needed, as to the sources
of the waters crossed by Leichhardt along the Gulf, in a low
table land of desert country, which has, however, sufficient
elevation to prevent the Barcoo or any other rivers from the
south breaking through. Mr. G. says, by this route parallel to
Leichhardt's along the Gulf, "the distance to which the rivers
extend from the coast has now been approximately ascertained."
This service was only exceeded by the discovery of a dividing
ridge on the 130th meridian, whence the drainage fell on one side
to the (N.W.) Victoria, and on the other to the desert. Mr.
Gregory has further shown, that as the rainy season had been dry,
no grass or water existed south of 18· S. on that parallel, or of
20· on the parallel of 127· E.; and, therefore, after such a
season, though that point might be attained from Sydney by land,
little hope would be left for an expedition coasting along the
N.W. coast to Swan River. He has also shown that, in that distant
part of Australia, the water courses falling to the desert take
the same direction as the rivers on the south side the desert,
first trending to N.W. and then curving round to the S.W.</p>
<p>In August, 1847, Leichhardt undertook and completed a short
journey to connect Moreton Bay with the Maranoa of Mitchell; it
was <i>his own route</i>, therefore, which he followed when, in
1848, he travelled in eleven days from Birrell's station, on the
Condamine, 118 miles from Mount Abundance, from which his last
letter was written, and which is found in the <i>Herald</i> of
1st June, 1848. [1.3]</p>
<p>But, previous to this, in the years 1846 and 1847, he had made
his second unsuccessful journey to Peak Range, on his way to
Western Australia. And it was on his return from that journey,
that he undertook the shorter exploration, which has just been
mentioned.</p>
<p>Thus far, we find Leichhardt following his own tracks up to
April 1848, when we lose sight of him; to Peak Range, in 1847, by
his former route, in 1844-5, and to Mount Abundance in 1848 by
his former route in 1847. Just as Sir T. L. Mitchell turned back
when he found himself on a river of M. Leichhardt, so we see the
latter keeping his own individual plan of exploration.</p>
<p>We have now only conjecture as to what has become of him; but
judging from the past experience, he is not likely to be found on
the tracks of the late Surveyor-General, though of course he may
have crossed them.</p>
<p>In the year 1852, four years after the last tidings of
Leichhardt, an expedition was <i>en route</i> to look for him,
under the charge of Mr. Hovenden Hely, who discovered <i>two
camps marled by the same letters</i> XVA within a border, which
may certainly have been intended for the letter L, but is a rough
kind of initial. In the year 1858, six years after Mr. Hely, Mr.
A. C. Gregory starts on a similar errand, and finds a letter L (a
huge letter) without other marks on a tree, on the Victoria
River, not far from the known camp of Mitchell in 1846, and
probably on one of those of Kennedy in 1847.</p>
<p>Supposing these discoveries to be of those required, the
intervals that have elapsed and the difference of seasons must
have occasioned difficulties in the way of establishing the
necessary identifications.</p>
<p>It may be well, first of all, to consider the affirmative, and
this can only be done, by referring to the details of Mr. Hely's
exploration. The information he has given is vague and brief.
Although the latitudes of some localities in his journey are
recorded, his report omits those of the two camps in which he
found the marked trees. And the account is too confused, to
enable them to be laid down with any certainty. Nevertheless,
they appear to be somewhere between the Warrego and the Nive of
Sir T. L. Mitchell, and on the upper part of that district, on a
course not far northwards of a direct line between Mount
Abundance and the L of Gregory.</p>
<p>Now, if we are to admit that the <i>two</i> marks XVA are
Leichhardt's, and that, as Mr. Hely says, they mean the 15th
April (though they might just as well stand for the 15th August),
the distance from Mount Abundance will be at a rough guess about
150 miles, and from Gregory's L. about 100, or at least 80.</p>
<p>But we know that Leichhardt's journey to Mount Abundance was
at the rate of <i>less than eleven miles a day</i>; and his road,
he says, was excellent, with the exception of a little brigalo
scrub here and there. At that rate his journey to Hely's XVA
camps, would have taken nearly thirteen days; and, therefore, the
date XV A (15th April), could hardly be correct, because
Leichhardt did not leave Mount Abundance till after the 4th of
April.</p>
<p>If, however, we adopt the distance indicated in the memorandum
forwarded by Mr. Gregory to the Colonial Secretary, on 15th
September, 1857, at 190 miles (since Surat is 40 from Mount
Abundance), we shall see that Leichhardt's time must have been at
least 18 days, which could not bring him to XVA on the 15th
April, but at least eight days later. Moreover, Mr. Hely says the
country at the time was under the waters of an inundation, so
that Leichhardt could go where he pleased (which is the reason he
gives for not finding more of Leichhardt's tracts), and we know
from Mitchell and Kennedy, that the country is very difficult and
very different from that between Birrell's and Mount Abundance;
and we further know, that Leichhardt's usual average rate was
about <i>seven miles per diem</i>. For which reasons, we may
infer, that if Leichhardt ever reached XVA, it was probably not
before May, so that the supposition of the date goes for very
little; and it is unaccountable how these letters should indicate
the only camps during even so incredibly short a period as ten
days, in a country which he must have traversed direct and,
therefore, still on a <i>route of his own</i>.</p>
<p>From Mount Abundance to the head of the Warrego, it took
Mitchell 55 days, and Kenned; took 28 days of actual travelling
from a point on the Maranoa abreast of Mount Abundance to the
junction of the Nive and Nivelle; and it took Mr. Hely 14 days to
reach Kennedy's camp on the Warrego, and three days' more
(exclusive of stoppages and searchings for water and tracks) to
the easternmost of the XVA camps, <i>i.e. seventeen</i> days in
all. Moreover, it took him 49 days to travel from the Condamine
110 miles to Mount Abundance. In 1847, Leichhardt took eleven
days from Gogg's station on Acacia Creek to the Cogoon below
Mount Abundance, 132 miles of direct distance, about the same
rate as that of his journey out to Mount Abundance in 1848, and
the camps XVA are about 150 miles further as the "crow flies."
Could all this be done in ten days? As it is full 40 miles of
direct distance from Kennedy's camp of 30th June, 1847, on the
Maranoa, to his camp of 28th October, on the Warrego, i.e., to
Hely's camp of 26th June, 1852, we may (supposing Leichhardt
crossed there) allow by the known route (excluding stoppages)
that Leichhardt could not have reached the eastern XVA camp
before the nineteenth day, which would have brought him up to the
24th, and not to the 15th April.</p>
<p>It is on this ground of interpreting the letters as a
<i>date</i>, that we must discard the idea of their indicating a
camp of Leichhardt's; and excepting the general resemblance to
the letter L of the outline surrounding them, there is nothing
else to identify them. On the presumption, moreover, that these
are Leichhardt's marks, and that he continued to travel at the
rate of ten and a half miles a day, he could not have reached the
spot marked L on the Victoria direct before the 1st or 2nd May;
and the probability is, that no direct route exists, as he would
have a generally waterless tract covered with brigalo, broken by
ravines and spurs of Mount Enniskillen. As Kennedy's journey was
in 1847 and Leichhardt's in 1848, <i>only five months after</i>,
it is not probable that though the summer of that year had
increased the drought, it had made so great an alteration as to
increase the unfavourable conditions of climate to such an excess
as is supposed, always allowing that Leichhardt did not venture
into the desert, which was, as we know from Kennedy's traverse
from the Warrego to the Culgoa in the preceding November, and
from Sturt's experience in the same season in the year 1845,
three hundred miles further westward, bad enough.</p>
<p>With this we have little to do; but confining our inquiries as
to the state of the country revealed by Mitchell, Kennedy, and
Hely, it is impossible for Leichhardt to have got over the ground
so as to have been at the spot alluded to on the 15th of
April.</p>
<p>In Mr. Commissioner Whitty's despatch of 8th April, 1852, to
Mr. Hely, and in Mr. Hely's letter to the Colonial Secretary of
22nd April (dated Surat, within 40 miles of Mount Abundance), the
distance assumed is "<i>ten days' journey</i>," or "<i>two
hundred miles</i>," from the Mount to the spot where Leichhardt
was supposed to be killed, and the distance reported by the black
gins, from whom Mr. Hely got his information, was either
<i>seven</i> days' journey, or <i>four, not one</i>, or
<i>eight</i>, or <i>four</i>, or <i>three</i>, or <i>eight</i>,
or only a short distance from the camp intermediate between the
two XVA camps; the directions varying almost as much as the
distances! If these stories were true, and Leichhardt had kept up
his former rate of travelling to get thither, he must have gone
(without any delay or stoppage), nearly 20 days, from Mount
Abundance (which is perfectly incredible), right into the heart
of the desert between the Victoria and the Warrego, over new
ground with unknown features, and, in all probability, without a
drop of water the greater part of the way, for the locality of
the report brought to Surat was <i>westward</i> from Mount
Abundance.</p>
<p>It is a curious coincidence, that on the 5th of November,
1847, Kennedy fell in, on the Warrego, about half-way between
Mount Abundance and the point 200 miles westward, with six
natives, of whom he says: "They were as ill-looking a set as I
have met with, and the young man who acted as our guide" (to a
water-hole) "had in his belt the blade of a knife which Niblett
recognised as the property of W. Bond, and which had been lost on
the depôt on the Maranoa."</p>
<p>As this depôt was about 110 miles to north-eastward, and as we
learn from another memorandum of Kennedy, that the language of
the people he met on that part of the Warrego is "the same as
that of the natives of the desert;" it is clear, the same tribes
range over the whole country between the Victoria and the
Maranoa, and that some of them are savage and dangerous,
sufficiently appears from Mitchell and Kennedy, though, on the
other hand, the greater part seem to be an inoffensive, obliging,
and friendly people.</p>
<p>The story of the massacre of Leichhardt has some features,
therefore, of <i>vraisemblance</i>: but in that case, as Mr.
Gregory has already pointed out, the L on the Victoria (if his
mark) upsets the whole, because he could not have marked a tree
there, if he had been killed at least a week or fortnight before,
a long way to the southward.</p>
<p><i>That</i> L, as before suggested by me, may have been
Luff's, or as I am inclined to think, perhaps, <i>Mr. Gideon
Lang's</i>, who, I understand, was on the Victoria since 1848. As
the country within forty miles of the locality of the XVA camps
is now settled by colonists, and probably the whole of the tract
between the head of the Warrego and the Victoria L has been
visited by others beside Mr. Lang, and that between his visit and
1858, we may obtain more accurate information about the XVA
marks. I have been disappointed at not having been able to find
in Sydney a gentleman who could tell us much on the nature of the
country about the head of the Warrego, which he has sometime
occupied. We must wait, however, patiently for such information,
as well as for the particulars of the route of Mr. Gregory, of
which little is known, save that he did not find the Alice River
within six miles of the indicated locality, and saw nothing he
could interpret respecting Leichhardt save the L, the remains of
sapling poles, and two horses running wild on Cooper's Creek,
which have been conjectured to be part of those which the blacks
told Mr. Hely had been eaten.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the <i>horses</i> belonged to <i>Sturt's
expedition</i>. He turned out a roan horse to enjoy its liberty,
on Cooper's Creek, on the 2nd November, 1845, "<i>in pity</i>,"
as he says, "to wander at large along the sunny banks of the
finest water course he had discovered." And on 30th August of the
same year, Flood lost his horse about 145 miles N.W. of Cooper's
Creek; the animal stole away, and it was supposed he had died
under a bush. The same animal had, however, twice before done the
same thing&mdash;once when in the Government paddock at Adelaide,
and once from a camp on the Murray. The probability is, that this
old soldier would find his way, if he survived, on the return
route, to the nearest and only fertile country of the
desert&mdash;that was Cooper's Creek.</p>
<p>As to the saplings, I have already conjectured that they may
have been those of a native hut, if not belonging to Kennedy's
camp, for Mitchell tells us that the natives on that part of the
river build their huts, not after the manner of the rude bark
<i>guniahs</i> of this part of New South Wales, but in this wise,
"a frame like a lean-to roof had first been erected; rafters had
next been laid upon that; and, thereupon, thin square portions of
bark were laid like tiles." (<i>Tropical Australia</i>, p.
319.)</p>
<p>As it may serve to give the reader an idea of the
improbability that the XVA camps are Leichhardt's, I have copied
here the marks Nos. 1 and 2 from Hely's Report, and No. 3 from
Mr. Gregory's letter to yourself, giving the L the proportions
assigned to it in an Adelaide newspaper.</p>

<p>No one, I imagine, can believe, that these marks were made by
one explorer during the same journey. Besides, we have a clue to
Leichhardt's mark.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of September, 1847, he made his furthest point
westward from Acacia Creek, Mitchell's camp 80 on the Maranoa,
which Kennedy also attained on 31st May of the same year. And
thence, after travelling upwards to camp 79, he returned
downwards to camp 81, and thence crossed the Balonne on his
homeward route. A little more than four miles south of that camp,
where they had first fallen in with Mitchell's dray tracks, he
"<i>marked a tree with a cross and an L in the wood</i>." This
spot is not less than 140 miles S.E. of the camps XVA. How
unlikely, then, is it that the latter can be Leichhardt's,
especially as Mr. Hely could find no trace of him on the Maranoa!
It may be as well to mention here, that in 1847 there were other
marks besides this, and Mitchell's and Kennedy's numerals in the
line of country between Darling Downs and the Maranoa. Of these,
there was a tree marked M. a little north-east of Mount
Abundance, discovered by Mr. Hentig.</p>
<p>The letter B was also marked on three trees on the Condamine,
twenty-six miles west of Ewer's Creek; one of the letters was cut
into the wood, the bark being removed. The letter H occurred on
each side of the Yalebone or Frederick's Creek, near the junction
with the Balonne, at the distance of more than twelve miles.
These were, no doubt, the marks of gentlemen looking for runs,
and may have been Macpherson's, Birell's, and Hughes.' The whole
of that country was thus well marked in places by cattle and
horse tracks, some coming <i>from the westward</i>; and amongst
them Mr. Archer's party was tracked by the shape of a particular
horse-hoof. There was another mark, however, more to the purpose.
The following extract from Leichhardt's unpublished notes of his
traverse along the Balonne will explain it.&mdash;"September 8th.
Mr. Bunce discovered this morning very old horsedung at the very
place where we camped. We continued to follow up the river, and
had gone scarcely three miles, when dray-tracks were observed.
They were very old and faint, and belonged to Mitchell's
expedition. Fresh horse tracks were seen coming down the river,
and apparently turning up to the N.W. on Mitchell's track. These
horse tracks were observed all along our road, and <i>at one
place an L was cut into a small watergum tree with a
blackfellow's tomahawk</i>."</p>
<p>It is clear from this, that even the letter L is no proof, by
itself, of Leichhardt's presence. And if this is the case, then
the solitary L on the Victoria may have been the work of the same
person, or of some other beside Leichhardt, as Luff or Lang.</p>
<p>My own interpretation of Mr. Hely's No. 1 and No. 2 XVA marks
is this. I believe them to have been made by some of Kennedy's
party, and that X is the prominent letter in the word
<i>expedition</i>, and chosen for it, and that V and A equally
easy letters to cut into a tree, are the commencing and terminal
letters of the word <i>Victoria</i>. In fact, as it is repeated,
at the interval of several miles, and found, too, at the "angle
of a creek," in both instances it is, I think, undoubtedly the
mark of some persons belonging to the "<i>Expedition to the
Victoria</i>," which Kennedy's expedition was expressly, and who,
being detached in search of water, found, it there, in a country
generally destitute of it. And for this supposition there is
probable evidence.</p>
<p>On the 25th June, 1852, Mr. Hely was in camp on the Warrego,
in 25·38·23' S., within two miles or so of Kennedy's camp of 28th
October, 1857, in 25·40·36' S. It was from this camp he started
in search of the marked trees XVA. My belief is, that those trees
were marked by Luff, who was constantly employed by Mr. Kennedy
in searching for water. Whoever carefully compares the extracts
made by myself from Kennedy's private journal of the expedition
(which were published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical
Society of London, vol. xxii.), with Mr. Hely's report, will find
ample grounds for believing that these marks correspond with
localities to which Luff and Costigan were detached in October,
and others in the preceding July, when a party was left in camp
from 4th to 16th of that month. We everywhere read in that part
of Kennedy's journal of the dearth of water, of excursions in
search of it, of wells dug to find it; and although at the
distance of five years, Mr. Hely's statement so far agrees, that
it was a permanent and not a <i>night</i> encampment which he
fell in with. The marks were at the angle of a creek; and I think
Mr. Kennedy was on the head of that creek on 19th July. The
latter says, "the bed of the creek was so soft, that it was
necessary to tether the horses." Mr. Hely says, (speaking of No.
1) "the soil being as we had found it ever since we reached the
Maranoa loose and sandy."</p>
<p>Again, on 21st October, Kennedy came to his old camp of 17th
and 18th July, at the head of the Warrego, of which he says,
"this hole, and that on the Nivelle, are the only two between our
present position and the reach on the Victoria, to be depended
upon is a very dry season," &amp;c. The next day he satisfied
himself that there was no considerable creek between it and the
Warrego. And, therefore, he removed his camp to that of the 16th
July.</p>
<p>This is some of the evidence as to the state of the country
six months before Leichhardt could have visited it.
Notwithstanding, however, that the country was then under unusual
drought, rain occasionally fell and on the 23rd October, when K.
again arrived at the permanent camp of 4-16th July, it
"<i>commenced raining at sunset and continued almost incessantly
through the night</i>." This, too, agrees with Mr. Hely's remark,
where he speaks of heavy saplings on which he supposes Leichhardt
placed his packs "(<i>showing that the ground must have been very
wet and damp</i>.")</p>
<p>It may be great presumption to doubt any statement made by an
actual explorer, respecting positions said to be determined by
observation, but I find a difficulty in reconciling the
<i>directions</i> of Mr. Hely's creeks, the one running east, the
other from south-west to north and north-east, for that could
hardly be if there is a range between them, as the facts require,
and which I have assumed above, separating the waters running on
the one hand to the Warrego, and on the other to the Nive.
Mitchell gives the indication of such a range running S.W.
Kennedy appears to have crossed this on the 20th of July, and
Mitchell on the 11th September, where it was from 2032 to 1787
feet above the sea. Mr. Hely had a rise of 900 feet on that
range, on the 27th June. I do not comprehend how any creek could
on the west side of such a range run from S.W. to N. and N.E.,
"considerably to the south, and far to the head of the Victoria,"
unless there is in that country some new feature, which belongs
to another river channel flowing parallel to the Nive into the
desert.</p>
<p>The country described by Mr. Hely has, apparently, all the
features of the Victoria basin, being richer and more beautiful
than that of the Warrego. Alpomdulla Creek of Hely must run
southwards, and one of the conditions required is a dividing
ridge between it, the Victoria and the Nive, a continuation of
the Gap Range, at the head of the Victoria.</p>
<p>I name this, because if full reliance is to be placed on the
geographical features involved in Mr. Hely's statements, we do
not know yet the actual northern boundary of the desert on the
parallel of 25· S. And it is a great pity, that when Mr. Hely was
in this country he did not glean more of the physical features.
Close too, as he was, according to his reckoning, to the L camp
on the Victoria, and on one occasion nearly within 20 miles of
that river, he might, perhaps, have ascertained whether the L
found by Mr. Gregory was there in the year 1852. Mr. Lang's back
run extended to the Warrego; and the head of the Maranoa in that
year was in legal occupation. The statements made to Mr. Hely by
the black gins, and by the aid of his interpreter, who appears to
me to have merely interpreted what his employer was in search of
(which, by the way, is no fault of Mr. Hely's), do not prove
clearly that any massacre took place. The narratives of Mitchell
and Kennedy do not confirm the idea that any tribe numerous as
"niemen" (ants) dwelt there in that district; but they do confirm
the idea that all the tribes were anxious to get rid of the white
intruders&mdash;jealous, no doubt, of the waterholes and creeks,
these being drained by the white men. As for the quart and
tinpots, red shirts, axes, guns, &amp;c., that they represented
as being in the black camps after the massacre, and strewing the
ground, the same things lie about every white man's camp when he
is taking up or occupying new ground. Again, that Leichhardt's
party should <i>all</i> have slept, is contrary to his known
habits. After his experience on the Nassau, he would not have
allowed <i>all</i> hands to sleep without a watch, and so be
murdered. One white man is represented as shooting a black, who
was wounded and died in the bush. Now, Kennedy represents that on
two occasions his party on the Victoria were troubled by natives,
and that he had to fire over their heads and charge them on
horseback to dislodge them, but in every instance the motive of
hostility appears to have been dread of the loss of water. In
other cases, the natives were particularly civil, in showing
where water could be found. It is probable too, that they might
have desired to obtain articles of value of which they had seen
the use; and it is curious how many of these things were in
possession of the natives. For instance. Sir T. Mitchell threw
away a pack-saddle on the Victoria, on 23rd September, and left a
tomahawk on the Maranoa, on 26th October; and Kennedy, when at
the same spot on 31st May, next year, "found an unusual number of
native camps, their proprietors no doubt having been attracted to
the spot in the hope of a similar piece of good fortune." Then,
again, Kennedy gave away an axe on 20th September, and another on
the 21st September; 26th October, a knife, and on 5th November a
powder-horn. Besides these, there were no doubt many articles
left at Mitchell's and Kennedy's depôts, and at other camps of
some days' duration. Mr. Hely says that the black boy noticed the
motion of the horses in hobbles, and said so it was when the
party were killed; and Kennedy says, "the boy laughed
immoderately at the movements of the horses." But when it is
asserted that all Leichhardt's horses and mules were killed and
eaten, we may reasonably doubt the story, especially when they
may have merely eaten the horse which Kennedy had killed and left
on the 9th September. Mr. Hely also mentions that some of the
cattle were eaten, and that some got away, and that he found
traces of their presence only a day or two old. It was on the
Maranoa, and within two miles of Kennedy's camp of 12-13th June.
The blacks said <i>these</i> were part of Leichhardt's! How
happens it that, if so, they too, had not been hunted down and
killed during the four years that had elapsed? And how was it
that it did not occur to an old bushman and settler, as Mr. Hely
was, to hunt them up himself to decipher their brands? As the
locality was nearly one hundred miles from XVA, the whole thing
is improbable. The cattle probably belonged to some settlers on
the Maranoa.</p>
<p>Adding to these rumours of the natives the fact that Mr.
Hedley and Mr. Mitchell, who left Tenterfield in 1852, had been
reported as murdered as well as others, we can only consider the
story of the aboriginals to be a carefully reported
conglomeration of matters of fact which, according to the habit
of the aboriginals, have been related by one tribe to another,
and so at last got to the ears of white people. One of the
<i>eye-witnesses</i> could have been only six years old at the
time of the alleged murder, and he professed to know all about
it. Now, it is a very curious circumstance, that this story was
not known even so short a distance eastward as Mount Abundance,
till January, 1852, nearly four years after the alleged
occurrence, as is detailed in Mr. Commissioner Whitty's despatch
of April, 1852.</p>
<p>To sum up all, what does this enquiry amount to? Merely to
this, that it is very unlikely that Leichhardt was killed at
all&mdash;that the places indicated by the letters XVA were
probably Kennedy's camps&mdash;and that the whole evidence of
Leichhardt's having reached the Victoria depends on the letter L
found by Mr. Gregory, which could not be his, if he was killed
before he could get thither, and which, if his, will completely
disprove the story of the black gins reported to Mr. Hely.</p>
<p>Did then Leichhardt get to the Victoria at all? There is no
doubt that when he penned his last letter, dated 4th April, 1848,
from Macpherson's station on the Cogoon, it was in his mind to
visit the Victoria, for he distinctly says, "We have killed our
first bullock at this station to obtain the necessary provisions
to carry us to the Victoria." But as an argument additional to
those above, it may be said, if the conjecture I have hazarded be
correct, that XVA has reference to the "Expedition to the
Victoria," it was not his, for his expedition was "to Western
Australia." Mr. Hely moreover states, in one of his despatches to
the Colonial Secretary, that Mr. Isaac, who was Leichhardt's
companion in his journey of 1847 to the Fitz Roy Downs, says it
was L.'s "firm intention at leaving, to go to the Victoria of Sir
Thomas Mitchell, and running it up to its junction with the
Alice, travel up that river in its supposed N.W. direction, and
endeavour to find the watershed of the Gulf Rivers and any
running to westward and southward. Mr. Isaac says that the Doctor
<i>may have</i> changed his intention after arriving at the
Balonne, but that he does not think it likely. I was myself (in
confirmation of this) told by a shepherd in New England, who was
in the employment of Mr. Macpherson, at Mount Abundance, at the
time of Dr. L.'s departure thence, that he was with his flock of
sheep when the Doctor passed by, and that he went due west, or,
as he expressed it, 'towards the setting sun.'"</p>
<p>This is the whole of the positive evidence for the Victoria.
But even that is diluted, by the possible may have of Mr. Isaac,
who knows too well, from his own experience, how circumstances,
unexpected sometimes, affect the traveller's route in the
bush.</p>
<p>The evidence the other way is as follows: I have already
stated, in my first letter, that Leichhardt distinctly stated to
me, that he intended to follow up the Burdekin to the Clarke, and
thence to explore the watershed to the Desert. With this, in some
measure, agree the assertions of others who were in Leichhardt's
confidence. Mr. Isaac himself says he might have changed his
purpose on reaching the Balonne; but he did not go to the Balonne
at all; he went to Mount Abundance, instead, and there,
certainly, wrote that he was going to the Victoria. If he changed
the first part of his route, why might he not have changed any
other portion of it?</p>
<p>Kennedy has told us, that the country was already suffering
from drought in 1847&mdash;that drought must have increased in
the subsequent summer, and the <i>probability</i> is, with this
in prospect, and the knowledge that, in less than 400 miles from
Mount Abundance, he would get into the frightful desert of Sturt,
I conceive, that neither Leichhardt nor any but a madman, bent on
suicide, would have attempted to penetrate to Western Australia
on such a route. And, if he had reached the Victoria, the
argument would be the stronger, for he would <i>see</i> what more
to the eastward would have been only an induction, that the
desert is impracticable except to explorers on the back of
Pegasus, who like Mr. Gregory can accomplish what cannot but be
considered an unparalleled act of rapidity and daring. As
Leichhardt did not travel in this wise, he must have coasted the
desert or would not have attempted it.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Hely himself set out with the same view, from which
he was deflected by the opinion of Mr. Isaac. He says, "I have
been speaking to several parties who were on the Downs, and had
communication with Dr. Leichhardt, previous to his setting out on
his expedition, and have heard many conflicting statements; some
maintaining that he intended first visiting Peak Range, and
others, that he went from the Maranoa to the north-west without
any intention whatever of going near Peak Range; <i>my own
opinion always has been that he did intend doing so, and I
accordingly expressed</i> a wish to the Government to be allowed
first to visit that locality, <i>but a conversation with Mr.
Frederick Isaac of Gowrie, has materially altered that
opinion</i>."</p>
<p>Again, he says in another despatch: "As I before mentioned,
the chances are very much in favour of Dr. Leichhardt having
visited Peak Range, and thence taken his departure for the N.W.
coast." Accordingly his instructions were given him to go from
the Condamine to Peak Range, via the Dawson, and to search for
letters indicating Leichhardt's route, and the stores which he
had left there on his former journey.</p>
<p>Mr. Hely, however, in consequence of his conversation with Mr
Isaac, obtained leave to alter his route, but nevertheless turned
back short of the Victoria.</p>
<p>It is certain he acted according to the best of his judgment
and belief; but had he, on leaving the Nive, carried out the rest
of his intentions, he would have told us more. "In the event of
proceeding to the north-west," he writes to the Colonial
Secretary, "on Sir T. L. Mitchell's track to the Alice, and
finding no traces of the missing party I shall then return down"
(? up) "the Victoria to the Nogoa (supposed to be the head of the
Mackenzie) which river I will run down and thus gain the Peak
Range country, which I shall thoroughly examine in the hope of
finding their tracks."</p>
<p>From this he was driven by the story of the natives which, on
his return, he thoroughly believed. But the L of Mr. Gregory has
sadly tested that belief.</p>
<p>That Leichhardt always intended to <i>skirt</i> and not
<i>intersect</i> the desert was known generally. Kennedy, under
date of 5th August, on the Victoria, at the camp where he buried
his carts and provisions (which were afterwards rifled by the
blacks), made this memorandum: "I, this evening, read
Leichhardt's lecture, by which I find that there is a probability
of our meeting, and that it is his intention to run <i>the
Albert</i> up to its source, which is, I hope, in this part of
the country." How Kennedy made this mistake about the Albert, I
know not; but it alludes to the Albert, on the Gulf of
Carpentaria, whither Kennedy was also bound, and confirms my
statement that Leichhardt intended to explore the country between
the Gulf and the desert. Captain Sturt has these remarks: "It may
not be generally known, that Dr. Leichhardt is at this moment
endeavouring to accomplish an undertaking, in which, if he should
prove successful, he will stand the first of Australian
explorers. It is to traverse the continent from east to west, nor
will he be able to do this under a distance of more than 5000
miles in a direct line. He had, already, started on this gigantic
journey, but was obliged to return, as his party had contracted
the ague, and he lost all his animals; but, undaunted by these
reverses, he left Moreton Bay in December last, and has not since
been heard of. One really cannot but admire such a spirit of
enterprise and self-devotion, or be too earnest in our wishes for
his prosperity. <i>Dr. Leichhardt intends keeping on the
outskirts of the desert, all the way round to Swan River</i>, and
the difficulties he will have to encounter, as well as the
distance he may have to travel will greatly depend on its
extent." * * * "Our best feelings have been raised to save the
Wanderer of the Pole&mdash;should they not also be raised to
carry relief to the Wanderer of the Desert?" (<i>Central
Australia</i>, p. 304.)</p>
<p>To prove further that this view of the case is correct, I now
quote, in conclusion, the hitherto unpublished statement of my
friend Mr. Mann, who was one of Leichhardt's companions in the
unsuccessful attempt of 1846-7, alluded to by Sturt. "The party
on this occasion consisted of Mr. Mann, Mr. Hovenden Hely, Mr.
Bunce; Perry, a saddler; Bocking, a German tanner and baker; and
Brown, a Newcastle black. The object of this trip was to proceed
as far as Peak Range, in latitude 22·, and to explore the Downs
and country which he had discovered in his first expedition; and,
by keeping a westerly course, endeavour to make Shark's Bay, and
then Swan River. His first intentions, however, were to strike
west before arriving at such a latitude, in fact make a bold push
directly across to Swan River. I, however, after many
conversations, persuaded him to relinquish such a design. Captain
Sturt had arrived at latitude 21·, and had seen nothing but
desert; and, therefore, any attempt to penetrate across it would
have been folly, we therefore arranged to proceed as far north as
Peak Range, and then keep a westerly course to Shark's Bay.
Before meeting Dr. L., in fact before he had returned from Port
Essington, the idea had often struck me of undertaking an
expedition across the island, by starting from Fort Bourke, on
the Darling, and by keeping a northerly or north-westerly course,
skirting the desert, to eventually arrive at Swan River. From
what I had read of Sturt's journey, and the description of the
country about the Gulf of Carpentaria, I felt convinced that the
waters of those two points were divided by a low range of hills,
by keeping along which water might be obtained, and the extent of
the desert as fully ascertained as by proceeding directly across
it. I mentioned this to my friend, Colonel Gordon, R.E., who
agreed with my idea of the country, but thought the journey a
very long and hazardous one to be undertaken. Dr. L. and party,
to the astonishment of every one, arriving soon after, I had the
pleasure of meeting him at Colonel Gordon's, who suggested that
the expedition should be undertaken between us. I accordingly
felt very willing to unite with Dr. L., and arrangements were at
once commenced for another journey into the interior."</p>
<p>Such is the testimony of various independent witnesses, who
all confirm the idea, that the intention of Leichhardt was all
along to skirt the desert.</p>
<p>If then he did reach the Victoria in 1848, and was not cut
off, and we have now no ground to conclude he was, he would, in
case of finding the country impracticable to the west, have gone
round by the head of the Victoria, towards the north, and it is
somewhere between the head of the Victoria and the head of the
Clarke, that, I think, he is to be looked for; not, probably, on
any line of route explored by Mitchell, but to the westward, or,
crossing Mitchell's track, on a line to Peak Range and the
Burdekin. Or driven in by drought, he may have taken a course on
the 148th meridian, without going across the Maranoa, where Hely
could not trace him, on a new track of his own.</p>
<p>It is in the hope that, on the return of Mr. Gregory to this
colony, a new expedition may be organised, with a view to the
exploration of the country west of Mitchell's Belyando, as well
as ascertaining whether any traces of my lamented friend can he
found, that I have taken the trouble to lay before your readers
this lengthened communication; believing, that, as I have had it
in my power to put the matter in a tangible form, and to quote
from MSS. notes in my possession, what has not before been
committed to the press, I am only rendering a service to the
cause of science, civilisation, and humanity.</p>
<p>One of your correspondents at Moreton Bay, thinks that some of
this information might have been wisely given before Mr. Gregory
stated. Not so. I had no opportunity of expressing an opinion by
invitation on the subject. I did not wish to interfere with a
plan which, had it been successful, would have served the purpose
(for Mr. Gregory was deterred by the season from going northwards
in 1858), and some of my data I had not then at hand. But now, as
the Victoria is put out of the question, there remains only one
further region to investigate, and it is my hearty desire that
this should be accomplished. I cannot undertake it myself, nor
have I the means to send out others. I contribute my <i>mite</i>,
therefore, in the present form.</p>
<p>I would, however, suggest whether it may not be a satisfactory
service to find some new and fitting feature in the unexamined
tracts of this country, by which to do honour to our present
Governor. Brisbane, Macquarie, Darling, King, Bourke, Gipps,
Fitzroy, are names familiar enough to geographers, and whilst
there are many features dignified by the name of
Goulburn&mdash;whilst Lindesay and Bligh, and every other person
who has held the reins of Government in New South Wales are
immortalized on the charts of Australia, there is yet no river
Denison to be found, and the name of the present representative
of our Sovereign, who has done more for science than all the
other Governors put together, is left attached to no more
edifying locality than the fort recently erected on the rock
known of old in the euphonious Australian Doric as
"Pinchgut."</p>
<p>It is a very bad practice, to alter the names of rivers or
ranges, when once they have been acknowledged by geographers; and
it would only lead to confusion to do so. But the example of
America may be adduced to show the equally bad effects of
admitting the same names over and over again to represent the
same features. Now, in Australia, we have the province of
Victoria; the settlement of Victoria, at Port Essington; the
river Victoria, on the N.W. coast; and the river Victoria, of
Mitchell. The latter ought to be permanently changed for the
native name <i>Barcoo</i>, which Kennedy says it is called by the
natives. But what is to be done with the <i>two Fitzroy
Rivers</i>, the one on the N.W. coast; the other disemboguing
near Port Curtis? And there are also the <i>Fitzroy Downs</i>.
The latter were only named provisionally by Mitchell, i.e., if
the Governor's name should happen to be Fitzroy.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, not much to be discovered of any interest
as affects the great features of a vast portion of this
continental island. But we have some <i>lacunæ</i> to fill up,
and Mr. Gregory seems to be the right man in the right place,
when he is filling up other people's gaps. Perhaps he could fill
up what is still a gap in respect to nomenclature.</p>
<p>If in these letters I have given offence to any persons by the
freedom of my remarks, I must request them to believe, that I
have offended unintentionally. Although all mentioned are friends
of my own, I have made free with their statements and
publications, only after the manner in which I would have dealt,
under similar circumstances of geographical interest, with the
journals and treatises of those ancient explorers and historians,
Herodotus, Arrian, and Polybius; with respect for their words,
where they report their own experience, but without reliance on
what they mention on hearsay, when it does nor bear the outward
and visible sign of the likeliest probability.</p>
<p align="center">I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>St. Leonard's, 17th August.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;When the above was written I had not heard of Mr.
Gregory's return to this colony. I can only hope, that some
demonstration, honorable alike to him and the colony, will mark
the public opinion of his skill, judgment, and diligence in
completing in so brief a period our knowledge of two most
interesting and important routes.</p>

<h4>5.4. Clarke's Letter to <i>S.M.H</i>., 10 September,
1858</h4>
<p align="center">LEICHHARDT AND THE DESERT.[&mdash;(4)]</p>
<p><span class="a">Previous</span> to the arrival of Mr. A. C.
Gregory from his last journey of exploration, I addressed two
letters under the above heading, to the Editor of the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>. The length of those communications
prohibiting a repetition of them on the present occasion, it is
considered advisable to offer an abridgement in the present form,
in order to meet the views of those who are anxious that my
statements should be put on further record; and as I am now in
possession of Mr. Gregory's report, I thus comply with their
desire, in the hope that this discussion may initiate another
expedition into the districts yet unexplored, between the 146th
and 147th meridians, and which I conceive, may bear traces of
Leichhardt's route, although I believe that he perished far to
the northward and westward of the Victoria.</p>
<p>In the year 1846, Sir T. L. Mitchell undertook an expedition
to discover a river running to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
disappointed by the structural features of the country, which
ought beforehand to have taught him the impossibility of such a
river existing, he returned, after discovering the upper parts of
the Belyando and Victoria Rivers, leaving the latter to be
explored further by Mr. Kennedy in 1847, and by Mr. Gregory in
1858, who traced it eventually into the channel of Lake Torrens
and Spenceres Gulf, whither I stated in 1847 it would be found to
go.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Surveyor-General was thus hampered by the
rivers on his way to Port Essington, Leichhardt had found his way
thither, by following the mountains between these rivers and the
sea, and coasting the southern border of the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>
<p>Leichhardt, on this occasion, avoided the edge of the desert;
but had he not lost his horses in crossing the Roper River, he
would have seen it in returning. But he says: "The loss of these
was very heavy. I had to throw away the greatest part of my
botanical and geological collections; and my plans of
<i>returning overland</i>, cutting off the angles of my route and
<i>keeping more to the Westward were frustrated</i>." This was in
1844-5.</p>
<p>That, however, which he could not do, has been since done by
Mr. Gregory, who in 1855-6 travelling on a line parallel to that
adopted by Leichhardt, that which he was prevented from adopting,
has given us the information which was needed, as to the sources
of the waters crossed by Leichhardt along the Gulf, in a low
table land of desert country, which has, however, sufficient
elevation to prevent the Barcoo or any other rivers from the
south breaking through. Mr. G. says, by this route parallel to
Leichhardt's along the Gulf, "the distance to which the rivers
extend from the coast has now been approximately ascertained."
This service was only exceeded by tho discovery of a dividing
ridge on the 130th meridian, whence tho drainages fell on one
side to the (N.W.) Victoria, and on the other to the desert. Mr.
Gregory has farther shown, that as the rainy season had been dry,
no grass or water existed south of 18· S. on that meridian, or of
20· on the meridian of 127· E.; and, therefore, after such a
season, though that point might be attained from Sydney by land,
little hope would be left for an expedition working along the
N.W. coast to Swan River. He has also shown that, in that distant
part of Australia, the water courses falling to the desert take
tho same direction as the rivers on the south side of the desert,
first trending to N.W. and then curving round to the S.W.</p>
<p>In August, 1847, Leichhardt undertook and completed a short
journey to connect Moreton Bay with the Maranoa of Mitchell; it
was <i>his own route</i>, therefore, which he followed when, in
1848, he travelled in eleven days from Birrell's station, on the
Condamine, 118 miles to Mount Abundance, from which his last
letter was written on the 4th April, 1848.</p>
<p>But, previous to this, in the years 1846 and 1847, he had made
his second unsuccessful journey to Peak Range, on his way to
Western Australia. And it was on his return from that journey,
that he undertook the shorter exploration, which has just been
mentioned.</p>
<p>Thus far, we find Leichhardt following his own tracks up to
April 1848, when we lose sight of him; to Peak Range, in 1847, by
his former route, in 1844-5, and to Mount Abundance in 1848 by
his former route in 1847.</p>
<p>We have now only conjecture as to what has become of him; but
judging from the past experience, he is not likely to be found on
tho tracks of the late Surveyor-General, though of course he may
have crossed them.</p>
<p>In the year 1852, four years after the last tidings of
Leichhardt, an expedition was en route to look for him, under the
charge of Mr. Hovenden Hely, who discovered <i>two camps marked
by the same letters</i> XVA within a border, which may certainly
have been intended for the letter L, but is a rough kind of
initial[.] This occurred too, in a district, where, according to
Mitchell, the trees are much marked by the aborigines. The
reported L looks really like a boomerang. In the year 1858, six
years after Mr. Hely, Mr. A. C. Gregory starts on a similar
errand, and finds a letter L (a huge letter) without other marks
on a tree, on the Victoria River, only half a mile of latitude
from a known camp of Mitchell in 1840, and two miles of latitude
from one of Kennedy's in 1847.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory says that this camp is neither Mitchell's nor
Kennedy's, and quotes the <i>charts</i>; these, however, do not
agree with the <i>journals</i>. But if they did, the letter L is
all that can be depended on.</p>
<p>It may be well, first of all, to consider the details of Mr.
Hely's exploration. The information he has given is vague and
brief. Although the latitudes of some localities in his journey
are recorded, his report omits those of the two camps in which he
found the marked trees. And the account is too confused, to
enable them to be laid down with any certainty. Nevertheless,
they appear to be somewhere on tho Warrego of Sir T. L. Mitchell;
and on the unexplored channel of that river.</p>
<p>Now, if we are to admit that the two marks XVA are
Leichhardt's, and that, as Mr. Hely says, they mean the 15th
April (though they might just as well stand for the 15th August),
the distance from Mount Abundance will be at a rough guess about
150 miles, and from Gregory's L about 100, or at least 80.</p>
<p>But we know that Leichhardt's journey to Mount Abundance was
at the rate of <i>less than eleven miles a day</i>; and his road,
he says, was excellent, with the exception of a little brigalo
scrub here and there. At that rate his journey to Hely's XVA
camps, would have taken nearly thirteen days; and, therefore, the
date XVA (15th April), could hardly be correct, because
Leichhardt did not leave Mount Abundance till after the 4th of
April.</p>
<p>If, however, we adopt the distance indicated in the memorandum
forwarded by Mr. Gregory to the Colonial Secretary, on 15th
September, 1857, at 190 miles (since Surat is 40 from Mount
Abundance), we shall see that Leichhardt's time must have been at
least 18 days, which could not bring him to XVA on the 15th
April, but at least eight days later.</p>
<p>From Mount Abundance to the head of the Warrego, it took
Mitchell 55 days, and Kennedy took 28 days of actual travelling
from a point on the Maranoa abreast of Mount Abundance to the
junction of the Nive and Nivelle; and it took Mr. Hely 14 days to
reach Kennedy's camp on the Warrego, and three days more
(exclusive of stoppages and searchings for water and tracks) to
the easternmost of the XVA camps, <i>i.e., seventeen</i> days in
all. Moreover, it took him 49 days to travel from the Condamine
110 miles to Mount Abundance. Even Mr. Gregory took twenty-three
days from Juanda to the Nive, in 1858. In 1847, Leichhardt took
eleven days from Gogg's station on Acacia Creek to the Cogoon
below Mount Abundance, 132 miles of direct distance, about the
same rate as that of his journey out to Mount Abundance in 1848,
and the camps XVA are about 150 miles further, as the "crow
flies." Could all this be done in <i>ten</i> days?</p>
<p>As it is full 40 miles of direct distance from Kennedy's camp
of 30th June, 1847, on the Maranoa, to his camp of 28th October,
on the Warrego, <i>i.e</i>., to Hely's camp of 26th June, 1852,
we may (supposing Leichhardt crossed there) allow by the known
rate (excluding stoppages) that Leichhardt could not have reached
the eastern XVA camp before the <i>nineteenth</i> day, which
would have brought him up to the 24th, and not to the 15th
April.</p>
<p>It is on this ground of interpreting the letters as a
<i>date</i>, that we must discard the idea of their indicating a
camp of Leichhardt's; and excepting the general resemblance to
the letter L of the outline surrounding them, there is nothing
else to identify them.</p>
<p>And confining our inquiries as to the state of the country
revealed by Mitchell, Kennedy, and Hely, we shall find, that it
was impossible for Leichhardt to have got over the ground so as
to have been at the spot alluded to on the 15th April.</p>
<p>It is a curious coincidence, that on the 5th of November,
1847, Kennedy fell in, on the Warrego, about half-way between
Mount Abundance and the point 200 miles westward, with six
natives, of whom he says: "They were as ill-looking a set as I
have met with, and the young man who acted as our guide" (to a
water-hole) "had in his belt the blade of a knife which Niblett
recognised as the property of W. Bond, and which had been lost on
the depôt on the Maranoa."</p>
<p>As this depôt was about 110 miles to north-eastward, and as we
learn from another memorandum of Kennedy, that the language of
the people he met on that part of the Warrego is "the same as
that of the natives of the desert;" it is clear, the same tribes
range over the whole country between the Victoria and the
Maranoa, and that some of them are savage and dangerous,
sufficiently appears from Mitchell, Kennedy and Gregory, though,
on the other hand, the greater part seem to be an inoffensive,
obliging, and friendly people.</p>
<p>The story of the massacre of Leichhardt has some features,
therefore, of <i>vraisemblance</i>: but in that case, as Mr.
Gregory has already pointed out, the L on the Victoria (if his
mark) upsets the whole, because he could not have marked a tree
there, if he had been killed at least a week or a fortnight
before, a long way to the southward and eastward.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory tells us little, save that he did not find the
Alice River within six miles of the indicated locality, and saw
nothing he could interpret respecting Leichhardt save the L, the
remains of saplingpoles, and two horses running wild on Cooper's
Creek which have been conjectured to be part of those which the
blacks told Mr. Hely had been eaten.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the <i>horses</i> belonged to <i>Sturt's
expedition</i>. He turned out a roan horse to enjoy its liberty,
on Cooper's Creek, on the 2nd November, 1845, "<i>in pity</i>,"
as he says, "to wander at large along the sunny banks of the
finest water course he had discovered." And on 30th August of the
same year, Flood lost his horse about 145 miles N.W. of Cooper's
Creek: the animal stole away, and it was supposed he had died
under a bush. The same animal had, however, twice before done the
same thin&mdash;once when in the Government paddock at Adelaide,
and once from a camp on the Murray. The probability is, that this
old stager would find his way, if he survived, on the return
route to the nearest and only fertile country of the
desert&mdash;that was Cooper's Creek. This is confirmed by Mr.
Gregory, who learned at Adelaide, that the tracks had been
traced.</p>
<p>As to the saplings, they may have been those of a native hut,
if not belonging to Kennedy's camp, for Mitchell tells us that
the natives on that part of the river build their huts, not after
the manner of the rude bark <i>guniahs</i> of this part of New
South Wales, but in this wise, "a frame like a lean-to roof had
first been erected; rafters had next been laid upon that; and,
thereupon, thin square portions of bark were laid like tiles."
(<i>Tropical Australia</i>, p. 319.) This precisely corresponds
with "a deep notch in the side of a tree, apparently to support
the ridge pole of a tent;" mentioned by Mr. Gregory.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory says, that some small trees had also been cut by a
<i>sharp axe</i>, but Kennedy, the year before&mdash;in 1847, had
given away <i>several axes</i> to the natives of the Victoria.
Moreover, he distinctly says, there was "a native camping place
within a few yards of the spot."</p>
<p>As it may serve to give the reader an idea of the
improbability that the XVA camps are Leichhardt's, I have copied
here the marks Nos. 1 and 2 from Hely's Report, and No. 3 from a
private letter of Mr. Gregory. In his report to the Government,
it is merely outlined.</p>

<p>No one, I imagine, can believe, that these marks were made by
one explorer during the same journey. Besides, we have a clue to
Leichhardt's mark.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of September, 1847, he made his furthest point
westward from Acacia Creek, Mitchell's camp 80 on the Maranoa,
which Kennedy also attained on 31st May of the same year. And
thence after travelling upwards to camp 79, he returned downwards
to camp 81, and crossed the Balonne on his homeward route. A
little more than four miles south of that camp, where they had
first fallen in with Mitchell's dray tracks, he "<i>marked a tree
with a cross, and an L in the wood</i>." This spot is not less
than 140 miles S.E. of the camps XVA. How unlikely, then, is it
that the latter can be Leichhardt's, especially as Mr. Hely could
find no trace of him on the Maranoa! It may be as well to mention
here, that in 1847 there were other marks besides this and
Mitchell's and Kennedy's numerals, in the line of country between
Darling Downs and the Maranoa.</p>
<p>Of these, there was a tree marked M. a little north-east of
Mount Abundance, discovered by Mr. Hentig. The letter B was also
marked on three trees on the Condamine, twenty-six miles west of
Ewer's Creek; one of the letters was cut into the wood, the bark
being, removed. The letter H occurred on each side of the
Yalebone or Frederick's Creek, near the junction with the
Balonne, at the distance of more than twelve miles. These were,
no doubt, the marks of gentlemen looking for runs, and may have
been Macpherson's, Birrell's, and Hughes.' The whole of that
country was thus well marked in places by cattle and horse
tracks, some coming <i>from the westward</i>; and amongst them
Mr. Archer's party was tracked by the shape of a particular
horse-hoof. There was another mark, however, more to the purpose.
The following extract from Leichhardt's unpublished notes of his
traverse along the Balonne will explain it.&mdash;"September 8th.
Mr. Bunce discovered this morning very old horsedung at the very
place where we camped. We continued to follow up the river and
had gone scarcely three miles, when dray tricks were observed.
They were <i>very old</i> and faint, and belonged to Mitchell's
expedition. Fresh horse tracks were seen coming down the river,
and apparently turning up to the N.W. on Mitchell's track. These
horse tracks were observed all along our road, and <i>at one
place an L cut into a small watergum tree with a blackfellow's
tomahawk</i>."</p>
<p>It is clear from this, that even the letter L is no proof, by
itself, of Leichhardt's presence. And if this is the case, then
the solitary L on the Victoria may have been the work of the same
person, or of some other beside Leichhardt, as Luff or Lang.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang's back run extended in 1852 to the Warrego. Moreover,
it it said by those who think Leichhardt went to the Victoria,
that he intended to leave letters there: (<i>See Gregory's
memorandum sent to the Colonial Secretary</i>, 15<i>th
September</i>, 1857), but we know from his marked trees on his
route to Fort Essington, that in such cases, he cut the word DIG
on the tree. No such mark exists according to Gregory. Nor is
there anything but conjecture to connect Leichhardt with the
locality.</p>
<p>Comparing Kennedy's Journal, (as given by myself in the
Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xxii.), with
Hely's report, it is certain the locality XVA is on the Warrego,
and probably, on Kennedy's camp of 16th July, 1857, where water
was to be had. All the features agree.</p>
<p>On 21st October, Kennedy came to his old camp of 17th and 18th
July, at the head of the Warrego, of which he says, "this hole,
and that on the Nivelle, are the only two between our present
position and the reach on the Victoria, to be depended upon in a
very dry season," &amp;c. The next day he satisfied himself that
there was no considerable creek between it and the Warrego. And,
therefore, he removed his camp to that of the 16th July.</p>
<p>This is some of the evidence as to the state of the country
six months before Leichhardt could have visited it.
Notwithstanding, however, that the country was then under unusual
drought, rain occasionally fell, and on the 23rd October, when K.
again arrived at the permanent camp of 4-16th July, it
"<i>commenced raining at sunset and continued almost incessantly
through the night</i>." This, too, agrees with Mr. Hely's remark,
where he speaks of heavy saplings on which he supposes Leichhardt
placed his packs "(<i>showing that the ground must have been very
wet and damp</i>.")</p>
<p>With respect to the statements made to Mr. Hely by the blacks,
it may suffice to sum up all in Mr. Gregory's words, "That the
account given to that gentleman of the murder of the party was
untrue," and Mr. Hely's guides had told him more than once, that
the blackfellows had "too much gammon."</p>
<p>Adding to the rumours of the natives the fact that Mr. Hedley
and Mr. Mitchell, who left Tenterfield in 1852, had been reported
as murdered as well as others, we can only consider the story of
the aboriginals to be a carefully reported conglomeration of
matters of fact, which, according to the habit of the
aboriginals, have been related by one tribe to another, and so at
last got to the ears of white people. One of the
<i>eye-witnesses</i> could have been only six years old at the
time of the alleged murder, and he professed to know all about
it. Now, it is a very curious circumstance, that this story was
not known even so short a distance eastward as Mount Abundance,
till January, 1852, nearly four years after the alleged
occurrence, as is detailed in Mr. Commissioner Whitty's despatch
of April. 1852.</p>
<p>To sum up all, what does this enquiry amount to? Merely to
this, that it is very unlikely that Leichhardt was killed at
all&mdash;that the places indicated by the letters XVA were
probably Kennedy's camps&mdash;and that the whole evidence as to
Leichhardt having reached the Victoria depends on the letter L
found by Mr. Gregory, which could not be his, if he was killed
before he could get thither, and which if his, will completely
disprove the story of the black-gins reported to Mr. Hely.</p>
<p>Did then Leichhardt get to the Victoria at all? There is no
doubt that when he penned his last letter, dated 4th April, 1848,
from Macpherson's station on the Cogoon, it was in his mind to
visit the Victoria; for he distinctly says, "We have killed our
first bullock at this station to obtain the necessary provisions
to carry us up to the Victoria."</p>
<p>Mr. Hely moreover states, in one of his despatches to the
Colonial Secretary, that Mr. Isaac, who was Leichhardt's
companion in his journey of 1847 to the Fitzroy Downs, says it
was L's "firm intention at leaving, to go to the Victoria of Sir
Thomas Mitchell, and running it up to its junction with the
Alice, travel up that river in its supposed N.W. direction, and
endeavour to find the watershed of the Gulf Rivers and any
running to westward and southward. Mr. Isaac says that the Doctor
may have changed his intention after arriving at the Balonne, but
that he does not think it likely. I was myself (in confirmation
of this) told by a shepherd in New England, who was in the
employment of Mr. Macpherson, at Mount Abundance, at the time of
Dr. L's departure thence, that he was with his flock of sheep
when the Doctor passed by ,and that he went due west, or, as he
expressed if, 'towards the setting sun.'"</p>
<p>This is the whole of the positive evidence for the Victoria.
But even that is diluted, by the possible <i>may have</i> of Mr.
Isaac, who knows too well, from his own experience, how
circumstances, unexpected sometimes, affect the traveller's route
in the bush.</p>
<p>The evidence the other way is as follows: Leichhardt
distinctly stated to me, that he intended to follow up the
Burdekin to the Clarke, and thence to explore the watershed to
the Desert. With this, in some measure, agree the assertions of
others who were in Leichhardt's confidence. Mr. Isaac himself
says he might have changed his purpose on reaching the Balonne;
but <i>he did not go to the Balonne at all</i>; he went to Mount
Abundance, instead, and there, certainly, wrote that he was going
to the Victoria. If he changed the first part of his route, why
may he not have changed any other portion of it?</p>
<p>Kennedy has told us, that the country was already suffering
from drought in 1847&mdash;<i>that</i> drought must have
increased in the subsequent summer, and the <i>probability</i>
is, with this in prospect, and the knowledge that, in less than
400 miles from Mount Abundance, he would get into the frightful
desert of Sturt, I conceive, that neither Leichhardt nor any but
a madman, bent on suicide, would have attempted to penetrate to
Western Australia on such a route. And, if he had reached the
Victoria, the argument would be the stronger, for he would
<i>see</i> what more to the eastward would have been only an
induction, that the desert is impracticable except to explorers,
who, like Mr. Gregory can accomplish what cannot but be
considered an unparall[el]ed feat of rapidity and daring. As
Leichhardt did not travel in this wise, he must have coasted the
desert or would not have attempted it.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Hely himself set out with the same view, from which
he was deflected by the opinion of Mr. Isaac. He says, "I have
been speaking to several parties who were on the Downs, and had
communication with Dr. Leichhardt, previous to his setting out on
his expedition, and have heard many conflicting statements; some
maintaining that he intended first visiting Peak Range, and
others, that; he went from the Maranoa to the north-west without
any intention whatever of going near Peak Range; <i>my own
opinion always has been that he did intend doing so, and I
accordingly expressed</i> a wish to the Government to be allowed
first to visit that locality, <i>but a conversation with Mr.
Frederick Isaac, of Gowrie, has materially altered that
opinion</i>."</p>
<p>Again, he says in another despatch: "As I before mentioned,
the chances are very much in favour of Dr. Leichhardt having
visited Peak Range, and thence taken his departure for the N.W.
coast." Accordingly instructions were given him to go from the
Condamine to Peak Range, via the Dawson, and to search for
letters indicating Leichhardt's route, and the stores which he
had left there on his former journey.</p>
<p>Mr. Hely, however, in consequence of his conversation with Mr.
Isaac, obtained leave to alter his route, but nevertheless turned
back short of the Victoria.</p>
<p>It is certain, he acted according to the best of his judgment
and belief; but had he, on leaving the Nive, carried out the rest
of his intentions, he would have told us more. "In the event of
proceeding to the north-west," he writes to the Colonial
Secretary, "on Sir T. L. Mitchell's track to the Alice, and
finding <i>no</i> traces of the missing party I shall then return
down" (? up) "the Victoria to the Nogoa (supposed to be the head
of the Mackenzie) which river I will run down and thus gain the
Peak Range country, which I shall thoroughly examine in the hope
of finding their tracks." From this he was driven by the story of
the natives.</p>
<p>That Leichhardt always intended to <i>skirt</i> and not
<i>intersect</i> the desert was known generally. Kennedy, under
date of 5th August, on the Victoria, at the camp where he buried
his carts and provisions (which were afterwards rifled by the
blacks) made this memorandum: "I, this evening, read Leichhardt's
lecture, by which I find that there is a probability of our
meeting, and that it is his intention to run <i>the Albert</i> up
to its source, which is, I hope, in this part of the country."
How Kennedy, made this mistake about the Albert I know not; but
it alludes to the Albert, on the Gulf of Carpentaria, whither
Kennedy was also bound, and confirms my statement that Leichhardt
intended to explore the country between the Gulf and the
desert.</p>
<p>Captain Sturt has these remarks: "It may not be generally
known, that Dr. Leichhardt is at this moment endeavouring to
accomplish an undertaking, in which, if he should prove
successful, he will stand the first of Australian explorers. It
is to traverse the continent from east to west, nor will he be
able to do this under a distance of more than 5000 miles in a
direct line. He had, already, started on this gigantic journey,
but was obliged to return, as his party had contracted the ague,
and he lost all his animals; but, undaunted by these reverses, he
left Moreton Bay in December last, and has not since been heard
of. One really cannot but admire such a spirit of enterprise and
self-devotion, or be too earnest in our wishes for his
prosperity. <i>Dr. Leichhardt intended keeping on the outskirts
of the desert all the way round to Swan River</i>, and the
difficulties he will have to encounter, as well as distance he
may have to travel, will greatly depend on its extent." * * *
"Our best feelings have been raised to save the Wanderer of the
Pole&mdash;should they not be raised to carry relief to the
Wanderer of the Desert?" (<i>Central Australia</i>, p. 304.)</p>
<p>To prove further that this view of the case is correct, I now
quote, in conclusion, the hitherto unpublished statement of my
friend Mr. Mann, who was one of Leichhardt's companions in the
unsuccessful attempt of 1846-7, alluded to by Sturt. "The party
on this occasion consisted of Mr. Mann, Mr. Hovenden Hely, Mr.
Bunce; Perry, a saddler; Boeking, a German tanner and baker; and
Brown, a Newcastle black. The object of this trip was to proceed
as far as Peak Range, in latitude 22·, and to explore the Downs
and country which he had discovered in his first expedition; and,
by keeping a westerly course, endeavour to make Shark's Bay, and
then Swan River. His first intentions, however, were to strike
west before arriving at such a latitude, in fact make a bold push
directly across to Swan River. I, however, after many
conversations, persuaded him to relinquish such a design. Captain
Sturt had arrived at latitude 24·, and had seen nothing but
desert; and, therefore, any attempt to penetrate across it would
be folly, we therefore arranged to proceed as far north as Peak
Range, and then keep a westerly course to Shark's Bay. Before
meeting Dr. L, in fact before he had returned from Port
Essington, the idea had often struck me of undertaking an
expedition across the island, by starting from Fort Bourke, on
the Darling, and by keeping a northerly or north-westerly course,
skirting the desert, to eventually arrive at Swan River. From
what I had read of Sturt's journey, and the description of the
country about the Gulf of Carpentaria, I felt convinced that the
waters of these two points were divided by a low range of hills,
by keeping along which water might be obtained, and the extent of
the desert as fully ascertained as by proceeding directly across
it. I mentioned this to my friend, Colonel Gordon, R. E, who
agreed with my idea of the country, but thought the journey a
very long and hazardous one to be undertaken. Dr. L. and party,
to the astonishment of every one, arriving soon after, I had the
pleasure of meeting him at Colonel Gordon's, who suggested that
the expedition should be undertaken between us. I accordingly
felt very willing to unite with Dr. L., and arrangements were at
once commenced for another journey into the interior."</p>
<p>Such is the testimony of various independent witneses, who all
confirm the idea, that the intention of Leichhardt was all along
to skirt the desert.</p>
<p>If then he did reach the Victoria in 1848, and was not cut
off, and we have now no ground to conclude he was, he would, in
case of finding the country impracticable to the west, have gone
round by the head of the Victoria, towards the north, and it is
somewhere between the head of the Victoria and the head of the
Clarke, that, I think, his tracks are to be looked for; not,
probably, on any line of route explored by Mitchell, but to the
westward, or, crossing Mitchell's track, on a line to Peak Range
and the Burdekin. Or driven in by drought, he may have taken a
course on the 148th meridian, without going across the Maranoa,
where Hely could not trace him, on a new track of his own.</p>
<p>It is in the hope that a new expedition may be organised, with
a view to the exploration of the country west of Mitchell's
Belyando, as well as to ascertain whether any traces of my
lamented friend can be found, that I have made this
communication; believing, that, as I have had it in my power to
put the matter in a tangible form, and to quote from MSS. notes
in my possession, what has not before been committed to the
press, I am only rendering a service to the cause of science,
civilisation, and humanity.</p>

<h4>5.5. Clarke's Letter to <i>S.M.H</i>., 20 October, 1858</h4>
<p align="center">LEICHHARDT AND THE DESERT.[&mdash;(5)]<br>
<br>
<i>To the Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,-I am glad to find that the
opinions which I have expressed in my former communications as to
the necessity of a further search for the route taken by
Leichhardt, in his journey towards Western Australia, have been
generally admitted to be satisfactory; and I hope that an
application which I have thought fit to make to the Government on
the subject will not be without the desired result.</p>
<p>Having made this application, not without a reasonable
expectation that it will be favourably considered, I did not
intend taking up space in your columns with any further
discussion. But the letter of Mr. Isaac, in your impression of
this morning, induces me to trespass a little more on the
patience of your readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Isaac has dealt very fairly with my letter of the 23rd
August, on which he comments. He explains why he advised Mr. Hely
to go westward instead of northward, and I do not blame, and
never have presumed to blame, the latter gentleman for taking the
advice given him. All I have regretted is, that he did not go
further, and, before he returned, act on his own original
intentions. As a bushman of considerable experience, and as a
traveller with Leichhardt on a former occasion, he was well able
to encounter difficulties from broken ground, scrubs, or any
other of the physical obstacles of exploration; and, as he did
not himself undertake the determination of geographical positions
on the journey of 1852, having with him a person, purposely
engaged to perform that part of the work, he is not to be
considered personally responsible for any errors of that kind.
And I should be very sorry to have it thought that, in what I
said of his journey, I implied anything more than his own
published reports justify.</p>
<p>Mr. Hely thought that Leichhardt would go by way of Peak
Range. All that I have read or heard on the subject, and all that
I have endeavoured to ascertain by reflection on the information
before me, makes me now more strongly of opinion than ever that
Mr. Hely was not far wrong in his belief, that Leichhardt would
go rather in the direction of Peak Range (i.e. northwards) than
directly to the west. It is very probable that his actual route
was west of the Belyando River.</p>
<p>The letter you reprinted on the 12th instant from the
<i>Border Post</i>, written by Mr. Roper, who was one of the band
of explorers during Leichhardt's grand expedition to Port
Essington, endorses my opinions, and accepts my statements in
full, adopting my views and strengthening them by conclusions
which are additional arguments in favour of those opinions. But
Mr. Isaac says he does not see how my argument respecting
Leichhardt's change of intended route to Mount Abundance, taking,
instead of going by the way of the Balonne River, a direct line
to the Mount, justifies the opinion that he might have changed
his course on any other part of his journey. "I am," he says, "at
a loss to understand how the fact of his having adopted this
latter route in preference to the former can show any change of
purpose." I have, however, said nothing of any change of
"<i>purpose</i>," as affects his <i>design</i>, of getting to
Western Australia, or even to the edge of the desert; my words
are clearly enough explained in my letter, in this way:&mdash;"If
he changed the first <i>part of his route</i>, why might he not
have changed any other part of it?" And very satisfactorily to
myself Mr. Isaac furnishes me, in his next sentence, with one of
the strongest grounds I could desire for establishing the opinion
(the one I have already adopted in my letter) that Leichhardt
<i>did</i> change some other part of his route. "<i>The abundance
or deficiency of grass and water</i>," says Mr. Isaac, "<i>might
easily account for so small a deviation from his proposed line of
route</i>." Well, if that is a good reason, as I admit, for "so
small a deviation from his proposed line of route," how much
better is it a reason for supposing a deviation from a direct
passage into the desert! Such an admission strengthens what I
said in my letter, that "neither Leichhardt nor any but a madman,
bent on suicide, would have attempted to penetrate to Western
Australia on such a route." It was <i>exactly</i> "the abundance
or deficiency of grass and water," which I had in view.</p>
<p>I do not consider, therefore, that my friend Mr. Isaac, has
refuted my argument; and I am much obliged for what he has done
to support it.</p>
<p>As to the marked trees on the Warrego, I have now satisfied
myself that Mr. Hely never went beyond that river, and that his
Alpomdulla Creek is the western arm of the Warrego, the head of
which Kennedy visited on 19th July, and which is left only
indicated by dots on his chart. It is well known, that names are
not assigned by the Aborigines, as by ourselves, to <i>a whole
river course</i>, but that each particular spot is named to which
any interest is attached&mdash;such as a waterhole, or any
locality which has value in their eyes;&mdash;hence Alpomdulla,
Warrego, Barcoo, Maranoa, &amp;c., do not define to the blacks
<i>so many rivers</i>, but so many localities on the rivers to
which explorers have attached the names given by the
blacks-names, too, which have a significant meaning, but which
are very seldom discovered by the explorers. Hence, Mr. Hely may
have misunderstood what the black gins told him of the creek on
which the supposed murder was committed, leading him to infer
that it could not be on the Warrego, because he did not bear in
mind that there was an unexplored arm of that river. In this
matter he got very poor aid from Captain Anderson, who
"<i>did</i>" the latitudes and longitudes for him.</p>
<p>Since my last letter was published, I have received a
communication from P. G. King, Esq., of Goonoo-goonoo, who thinks
the letters XVA might mean "<i>Expedition to the Victoria and
Albert</i>," which Kennedy's really was, as, after exploring the
Victoria, he was to go to the head of the Albert, on the Gulf of
Carpentaria. I admit this interpretation by my friend is more
likely than my own. That X might be need for <i>Expedition</i>
may be illustrated by an accident to which, the press is
sometimes exposed, for, in the <i>Moreton Bay Free Press</i>, of
5th October, in the heading of Mr. Gregory's report, there is
mention of the "XPEDITION" in "search of Dr. Leichhardt and
party." What the compositor dropped by accident, the explorer may
have dropped by design.</p>
<p>A good deal has been made of the statement of a shepherd, who
told Mr. Hely, that he saw Leichhardt "going towards the setting
sun," <i>i.e</i>. westwards, when he left Mount Abundance; Mr.
Isaac alludes to it. But, after all, what is the statement worth?
Of course, Leichhardt must have gone in some direction, to get
clear of the station; and that, I presume, is all that can be
made of it. He could scarcely have been more than a mile or two
away; for the shepherd was with his flock, and had he gone
northwards, Leichhardt would still have been within Mr.
Macpherson's run, for that gentleman had other stations, in that
direction. What the shepherd says is worth nothing to the
question involved. Shepherds are fond of "yarns;" this, perhaps,
is one of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Isaac says, that Leichhardt often omitted to mark his
stations, "by leaving long intervals between his marked trees;"
but we know he marked all important <i>new</i> localities, and he
marked even the tree at his farthest point on the Maranoa, when
in company with Mr. Isaac in 1847. I can hardly believe that he
would go direct from Mount Abundance, to the Victoria, crossing
the Warrego, without marking his line of route, because that was
quite new.</p>
<p>As to the L surrounding XVA on the Warrego, Mr. Isaac thinks
it may have been. Leichhardt's because some of his letters L were
rough, and often made by a black-boy. But, if the L was carved by
a black boy, were XVA also carved by him? And, would a black boy
have put such letters <i>inside</i> such a letter L? I think it
very probable, the assumed Warrego L <i>was</i> made by a
blackfellow; it looks like a boomerang, as I before suggested,
and the XVA may have been put on a blackfellows' mark of very old
standing. A friend, however, suggests that there is no L in the
case; and that that mark is a <i>direction</i>&mdash;a mark made
pointing to the route of tho XVA, or Kennedy's "Expedition."</p>
<p>As to the Victoria L, Mr. Gregory's opinion must, of course,
be respected. And Mr. Isaac says that Mr. Lang waa never there; I
cannot maintain a supposition that he was, against a positive
assertion that he was not. But, admitting this, and all that Mr.
Isaac says touching the improbability that any one but Leichhardt
cut that L, and admitting also, that it was there he camped "for
the night," I do not see anything "singular" in the "coincidence"
that another party, if the leader had an initial L to his name,
should have used the same mark as Leichhardt, and I have already
proved that Leichhardt, with Mr. Isaac in company, actually
discovered a letter L on the back of a tree in 1847, and this L
was not made by himself.</p>
<p>But I have argued up to this point, and I still maintain the
argument, that, though there is nothing to prove, that the L on
the Victoria is "<i>not Leichhardt's</i>," there is nothing to
prove, that <i>it is his</i>, and it is <i>that</i> proof, and
not the negative one, that we want.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Hely, nor Mr. Gregory, nor Mr. Isaac, nor any one
else, has shown, with any certainty, what became of Leichhardt
after he left Mount Abundance, nor has any one yet produced any
mark alleged to be his between that locality and the Victoria. On
the Maranoa Mr. Hely could not find him; on the Warrego Mr.
Gregory did not find him; and all there is to show his route,
even, though when intending to go to the Victoria, he arranged to
leave letters there, indicating his route beyond, is the solitary
L and some cut saplings in the vicinity of a black fellows' camp,
which is reported as such by Mr. Gregory. If he did not change
his purpose in getting to the Victoria, he did, it seems, change
his purpose of leaving any unmistakeable record of his arrival.
For where are his letters? where the direction to dig for
them?</p>
<p>But I have no objection, <i>for argument's sake</i>, to
assume, that he <i>did</i> reach the Victoria; that the saplings
were cut by him; that the L was made by him; and that he did
write letters, and that (as the gins reported to Mr. Hely of
Alpomdulla Creek that a flood swept away all the tin-pots and
other articles of his camp,) so the flood Mr. Gregory speaks of,
swept away all traces of the camp on the Victoria, save a sapling
or two, and the dead shells heaped up by the blacks&mdash;but,
admitting, this, I throw myself on the timely support afforded by
Mr. Isaac in his allusion to the course adopted by Leichhardt
from the Downs to Mount Abundance, and rely on the conviction of
all experienced bushmen and explorers, that, if "the abundance or
deficiency of grass and water might easily account for so small a
deviation from his purposed line of route,"&mdash;the same
consideration must have acted upon Leichhardt with irresistible
force when he saw (<i>though ten years ago</i>) the burning
wilderness before him, through which, with no trees to build his
favourite gunyahs, no grass to feed his cattle, no game on which
he, without provisions, as he was, save a few bullocks and very
scanty supplies of other kinds, could live through a journey of
upwards of 2000 miles, and no water; save of those periodical or
paroxysmal rains, which would not be his friend, but his very
worst enemy.</p>
<p>If any one, candidly reviewing all the circumstances of the
case&mdash;all the facts which have been elicited, and all the
arguments advanced (putting aside any errors into which I may
have fallen in the anxiety to make the most of my own
convictions) shall say that Leichhardt did not "hark back" in
front of the desert, and follow out his original purpose of
skirting the desert; by following it round, and keeping within
the resources to be derived from the highlands, such as drinkable
water, wood for fires, grass for cattle, and game, <i>without
which the whole party must have starved</i>,&mdash;then, I will
admit, that I am somewhat mistaken, and that instead of being a
careful, cautious, and considerate explorer, he was "a madman,
bent on suicide," and on the destruction of his companions. I
cannot accept Mr. Gregory's explanation of his becoming entangled
between the barren sand hills, and sheets of mud (from which he,
certainly, never could have emerged), and which would, of course,
have happened, had he gone "right a-head," till I have a proof
which does not rest on probabilities alone, that in the most
important journey he ever took, the great explorer threw away all
his own experience and all the use of the information he had
obtained from others, knowing that he had very little to depend
on but his gun for food, in a country that could produce nothing
of animal life but rats and reptiles, in which his cattle could
get nothing to eat for days and days at a time, and even the
deficiency of the grass seeds of the aboriginal bakeries would
supply no bread for his party.</p>
<p>The experience we have hid of his mode of exploration&mdash;a
mode that exposed him to a taunt by no means flattering to one
who would defend on rashness&mdash;has taught us that Leichhardt
would, whilst unchanging in purpose; as to his main design, never
neglect the chances which nature threw in-his way; and that he
was too fond of furnishing his companions with such comparatively
good things as no desert could, promise, to go boldly and without
apparent object, where they are not to be found.</p>
<p>The whole of the little squabbles that occasionally took place
in his expedition to Port Essington arose from the complaints of
the party respecting their supply of food; and I am certain that
it was the urgency of commissariat claims which would have made
him skirt the desert, and that only within gunshot of a daily
supply.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory is a much bolder explorer than Leichhardt ever
was, but he is not, though in many, in all things, a more prudent
one, and in his brilliant dash along the shores of Carpentaria,
he found it necessary, on account of "deficiency of grass and
water," to keep on the safe side, though he, too, as well as
Leichhardt, desired to define the limits of the desert. Under
this impression it is that I urge a further search between the
144th and 147th meridians and between the 25th and 18th
parallels, a tract of country of which the greater part is
scarcely known, and by which, whilst geography would be advanced
in the tracing out of the continuation and general features of
the Cordillera or Great Dividing Ranges, between the head of the
Victoria and the head of the Burdekin River, the hiatus on the
charts of Eastern Australia would be filled in; the limits of the
desert would be defined, and the value of unexplored territory
belonging to this colony, with the chance of a direct route to
the Gulf of Carpentaria would be determined.</p>

referred to him. The one expedition was that of Mr. Hely in 1852,
and the other that of Mr. Gregory in 1858.</p>
<p>Mr. Hely found two camps 150 miles from Mount Abundance, each
of them marked with the cypher XV. A., enclosed within a rude
border of bent lines that bore some resemblance to a letter L.,
and which he interprets as indicating "Leichhardt, April 15." He
also heard from the natives of the neighbourhood that Leichhardt
was murdered at that very place.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory found remains that he concluded to be those of
Leichhardt 80 to 100 miles farther towards the interior than
Hely's camps, and, as such, to refute the report of his previous
death at the latter place. The remains consisted of an L cut upon
a tree by a camp; of the marks of sharp axes; of some saplings
that had been cut with them; and of two horses running wild.</p>
<p>The object of Mr. Clarke is to show that neither the
discoveries of Mr. Hely nor those of Mr. Gregory have any
reference to the camps or fate of Leichhardt. <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 88}</span></p>
<p>In the first place, he argues that Leichhardt could not have
reached Hely camp on the 15th of August. The rate of his previous
journeyings, and that of other travellers in the same country, as
Mitchell, Kennedy, and even Gregory, make it highly improbable
that 150 miles of direct distance could have been accomplished by
him in 11 days.</p>
<p>Again, the country north-east of Mount Abundance had been
visited as far back as 1847, by many persons on the look out for
cattle runs, and the trees were known to bear marks of an M and
also of an H, and Leichhardt himself speaks of having found an Ii
on the Balonne. The axe marks are to be accounted for by the fact
of Kennedy having given axes to the natives thereabouts; and, if
the saplings had not been cut by Kennedy himself, it is to be
remembered that, according to Mitchell, the natives of those
parts use saplings for the construction of their own huts. The
loose horses found by Gregory in Cooper Creek are ascribed by Mr.
Clarke to Captain Sturt's expedition. That explorer relates that
he turned out a roan horse that was unfit for further work "in
pity" at this very spot, and also that, 145 miles farther on,
another horse stole away from his party (as the same animal had
often done before), and Mr. Clarke thinks it must have tracked
its way back to the excellent pasturage where its roan companion
had been left behind.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* What were the colours of the horses seen by
Mr. Gregory?&mdash;F.G.]</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke considers it questionable whether Leichhardt went
to the Victoria at all. His method of travelling, which was
cautious, slow, and persevering, makes it likely enough that when
he actually came to the frightful desert he would have skirted
it, looking out for an opening, rather than have attempted to
cross it at once. Mr. Clarke concludes that it is somewhere
between the head of the Victoria and the head of the Clarke that
Leichhardt's tracks are to be looked for, not probably on
Mitchell's route, but to the westward of it, or else that, driven
in by drought, Leichhardt may have taken a course on the 148th
meridian, without crossing the Maranoa.</p>
<blockquote><span class="u">Captain Byron Drury, r.n.,
f.r.g.s</span>.&mdash;Upon this subject perhaps I may be
permitted to say that I happened to be present when we took
possession of the whole of that part of the coast of North
Australia. We found it was one of the finest districts in
Australia; and I must say that I think Port Essington, with the
exception of Port Jackson, the finest harbour in Australia. I was
there during eighteen months, and we never had the slightest
disease or illness inour two ships' companies. I have heard that
port cried down, I am sorry to say, by my late friend Captain
Stanley and others; but from what I have seen of it, I perfectly
agree with the late Sir Gordon Bremer, that there is not a place
on the north coast of Australia better adapted for Europeans, in
<span class="pagenum">{Page 89}</span> addition to the advantage
of possessing a perfect harbour, with a peninsula, the neck of
which is only eight miles in width. Why we have not retained
possession of that coast is to me extraordinary. I entirely agree
with my friend Sir Charles Nicholson about Cape York; and,
putting the Gulf of Carpentaria on one side, I must say I think
Port Essington the best site along the whole coast. It is well
watered for Australia. Had we not been there in 1838 two French
frigates would probably have taken possession of it. They arrived
two months after us. We held it for twelve years, and then
abandoned it. The proved advantage of Cape York as a place of
refuge for the frequent wrecks among the Barrier Reefs and Torres
Straits is, among other considerations, of great importance.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Rear-admiral Fitzroy, f.r.g.s</span>.&mdash;May I
venture to remark that this seems to be one of those great
questions that might fairly be taken up by the Government. I
apprehend that the exploration of Australia has never yet been
undertaken in a thoroughly efficient manner. There has been the
utmost daring, energy, perseverance, and good management on the
part of those engaged, but the undertakings have been in detail
rather than comprehensive, and by comparatively private
expeditions.<br>
<br>
How strange it would appear to an Arabian or an African if we
were to ask him to undertake an excursion across the vast deserts
of Africa with ponies or horses, or even bullocks! How is it that
we have never taken the camel&mdash;"the ship of the
desert"&mdash;from those countries where it is indigenous, and
transported it to those of our colonies which are in such want of
it? We have in Australia an enormous extent of country which in
all probability is a comparative desert. There may be steppes,
there may be a great inland sea&mdash;perhaps fresh, perhaps
salt&mdash;who can say with certainty? The probability is that
there are no very high ranges of mountains, and no very great
rivers, but a great extent of barren and unfertile country, with
perhaps an extent of inland water. No desert has yet been found
in any part of the world in which there is not an oasis. There
may be such a space in the interior of Australia&mdash;not only a
fertile and valuable district, but one in which there may be
tribes who have never yet seen the white man. When we consider
that we have hundreds of thousands of our countrymen spread round
the borders of that continent (for such it is), surely it is
worth urging the Government to undertake an expedition into the
interior upon a scale worthy of this great country.<br>
<br>
It may be naturally asked, how should it be done? One very simple
course occurs to me&mdash;somewhat military it may be&mdash;that
of first establishing a base of operations as far within the
country as one can yet go with security, and making there a
temporary settlement, perhaps for two or three years; and then
from that basis working inwards.<br>
<br>
One expedition might be set on foot from the eastern coast,
another from the south, another from the west, and another from
the north&mdash;all carried out under Government, by experienced
colonists, with such aids as I have alluded to, particularly the
camel&mdash;emphatically, I repeat, "the ship of the desert."
Apologising for this interruption, I conclude by earnestly
pressing for the introduction of the camel to Australia.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Lord A. Churchill, f.r.g.s.</span>&mdash;I would
venture to make one or two observations with regard to the great
importance which would result to this country, and to the whole
of the Australian continent, from the formation of a succession
of settlements on the north-east coast. I believe the region in
question would be found very favourable for the production of the
cotton-plant. I am told it has been known to flourish there, and
can be produced in sufficient quantities to supply the English
market, and from its peculiar nature likely to bear a high value.
It must, therefore, be a matter of the highest concern to this
country to be enabled by means of these settlements to secure the
production of cotton for ourselves, and thus in some <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 90}</span> measure render us independent of the
United States. There are other articles natural to a tropical
climate which might be cultivated to great advantage in these
provinces; and the climate moreover is well adapted to European
constitutions. Therefore I think it is a question which ought to
be taken up by the Imperial Government.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Dr. Hodgkin, f.r.g.s</span>.&mdash;I do not
expect to add anything to the interesting remarks made by
gentlemen who have been upon the spot, but I cannot allow the
opportunity to pass without calling attention to one point. I
have been informed by a friend, who spent some time on the
northern coast of Australia, in the vicinity of Cape York, that
many wrecks occur in that neighbourhood; and his statements have
been corroborated this evening by Captain Drury. Considering the
number and value of the shipping in that sea, independently of
the productions to be obtained from the land, it must be highly
important to take advantage of the natural harbours to be found
on that part of the coast, where vessels and their crews might be
saved in case of injury or distress.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Mr. J. Crawfurd, f.r.g.s</span>.&mdash;I believe
I can with confidence assert, that the alleged fertility at Cape
York, or at any place in its neighbourhood, is an
impossibility&mdash;for this reason: there is no range of
mountains, and hence no fall of rain, and consequently no
adequate means of irrigation. Irrigation, or an abundant supply
of water within ten or twelve degrees of the equator, is
indispensable to fertility: the most fertile land is unproductive
without water, and water for perennial irrigation does not exist
about Cape York. Horned cattle may be reared on the shores of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, but there is no market for them. Sheep could
not thrive there, and they would produce hair, or something like
it, instead of wool, and that would be unsaleable. Besides, where
are the labourers to cultivate the soil? No European constitution
could stand the heat so near the equator; and as to the Chinese,
they have too much good sense to go there as long as they can get
to the gold-fields. As to Port Essington, that was abandoned
eight or nine years ago on account of its insalubrity. The
harbour may be good, but the climate is so unhealthy that no
European could live there; and such being the result of long
experience, the settlement was abandoned by the Government.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Captain Byron Drury.</span>&mdash;I do not know
where Mr. Crawfurd obtained his information, but I lived at Port
Essington eighteen months, and I can say that we grew every
tropical production in the greatest luxuriance. We had ponds of
water about there; and during an excursion of ten days into the
interior we found water wherever we went. I do not mean to say
that water is as abundant as in New Zealand, but we found
continuous streams; and as to fertility, we raised enough to
supply us in two months after we arrived there. I will give
another instance of the productiveness of the country. When Sir
Stamford Raffles left this settlement, Captain Barker turned out
some cattle. In 1838, when we went there, and a party of us
penetrated thirty miles into the country, we found a quantity of
oxen wallowing in swamps; and now there are wild horses. How
could they live without water?&mdash;and yet there they were
living and prospering, especially the cattle.<br>
<br>
<span class="u">Mr. Trelawny Saunders</span>.&mdash;I think the
best answer to Mr. Crawfurd is the statement of Flinders, who,
when he explored the Gulf of Carpentaria, expressed his surprise
at finding an abundance of surface water at the end of the dry
season. Leichhardt also stated that during his long journey
around the Gulf, his cattle, far from being generally in want of
water or vegetation, fattened as they went along the road. A
recent traveller has told us that the country presented a dismal
appearance, covered as it was with long dry grass, burnt here and
there by the natives. The gentleman must have forgotten that the
dried grass was once green, and that its growth had been fostered
in the proper season by sufficient moisture. Against the evidence
of Flinders, Leichhardt, and Stokes, I think Mr. Crawfurd's
opinions must give way. I <span class="pagenum">{Page 91}</span>
went away from a former meeting grieved to think that Mr.
Gregory's report would tend to hinder the settlement of Northern
Australia. This paper of Mr. Clarke's has revived my hopes as to
the early colonisation of the country round the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Let it he recollected that the two expeditions sent
out to connect the northernmost bend of the Barcu River with the
bottom of the Gulf of Carpentaria failed, not from the
difficulties of the country, but from the failure of provisions;
for Sir Thomas Mitchell describes the country to the northward of
the Barcu as the finest he had seen in the whole of
Australia.<br>
<br>
The <span class="u">President</span>.&mdash;The discussion has
somewhat diverged from the point at which we started&mdash;the
expedition in search of the remains of Leichhardt. I rejoice,
however, that it has taken this turn, because it has brought
forward my friend Mr. Crawfurd, who, upon certain subjects
connected with North Australia, may be called our
"objector-general." His objections are indeed always of great
use, and on this occasion they have elicited from gentlemen who
have lived upon the spot, that this very region, which my friend
stigmatises as unfertile, and not fitted for the maintenance of
sheep and the growth of wool, is in the highest degree
productive, well-watered, and adapted for the sustenance of sheep
as well as cattle. I regret that Sir John Pakington, one of Her
Majesty's Ministers most interested in this discussion, so far as
it regards the establishment of a great naval depot in the
northern part of Australia, should have left the room just as we
were beginning to debate that point. To me indeed it is not a new
subject. In the years 1844 and 1845, when I was your President, I
argued earnestly for the establishment of a great naval entrepôt
upon that coast; and I supported with all the energy in my power
the enlightened views of Admiral Sir Gordon Bremer, a most
experienced navigator in those seas. I have long thought that
Great Britain ought not to hold three sides of the great
continent of Australia without having on its northern frontier
any one settlement. Provided only a port be established, it is
unimportant to me whether it be at Cape York or Port Essington;
though, if I were consulted, I should like to see a settlement
established also in Cambridge Gulf, which is well watered by the
Victoria River, navigable for some distance, where our men were
encamped for eight months, enjoying perfect health, and where the
wool of the sheep did not deteriorate; these animals having been
pastured up to their knees in grass. Judging from the experience
of Gregory's expedition, I feel certain that Englishmen could
live there to their own advantage, as well as to that of the
mother country. I rejoice indeed that gentlemen who have resided
in Australia are ready to enforce the necessity of establishing
some great entrepôts, particularly as ports of refuge, to provide
against the possibility of these seas being swept by a hostile
fleet; for with the knowledge that the French have now occupied
and settled New Caledonia, with its splendid natural bays and
harbours, which were discovered and named by our own Cook, it is
absolutely essential that we should be better
prepared.</blockquote>

Station, on the Nogoa, to that of his arrival at the Albert

<p class="quote" align="center"><span class="a">Edited by the
Assistant-Secretary.</span></p>
<br>
<p>On the 15<i>th Sept</i>., [1861] left Mr. Macintosh's station
on a reek flowing into the Nogoa, which I crossed on the 19th,
and then went to the north to hit Poma, which tributary of the
Claude takes its rise at my pass over the main range; this is a
great detour, but by this means I avoided the dense brigalow
scrub which intervenes between the Nogoa River and Salvator Lake
and the pass. On the 20th we reached the beautiful Emerald Downs,
on Poma Creek, camped there the 21st, and arrived at the foot of
the pass and my old camp on the 23rd; the grass had caught fire
from my camp, and was now a fine sward. We camped on the Nivelle
the 25th. My first marked tree is on Emerald Downs, as that was
new ground to me. The 26th we pushed down to the Nive, about 5
miles above my old No. 11 camp. The next day, 27th, crossed over
to the Victoria, and camped (No. 6) below my No. 29 tree. On the
28th, 29th, and 30th, pushed down the Victoria by fair stages,
and on the morning of the 7th October found Camp 10 was in long.
146° 1' E., lat. 24° 34' S. Whilst camped here we searched for
the L tree seen by Gregory; but as we had seen his 22nd (XXII.)
tree on the north bank, we searched on the same for the L tree
and it was not until the 5th Jingle and Mr. Haughton found it on
the south bank. In the meanwhile I had found another L tree 2
miles below our camp on north side, and 7 below the tree seen by
Gregory. I looked for an open road N.N.W., but was checked by a
dense, almost impenetrable scrub of acacia. Mitchell calls this
acacia "brigalow," but that is incorrect, for it differs much
from it, and I have seen but two or three real brigalow since we
crossed the ridge dividing the Nive watershed from that of the
Victoria. The blacks call this acacia "gurrt." Brigalow they call
"noorwool." A little below the second L tree, I found I could
pass round the termination of this scrub. I surmise that
Leichhardt intended leaving the Victoria at the tree seen by
Gregory; was stopped in his N.N.W. course by the same barrier
encountered by me, and turned back to camp at the tree found by
me, subsequently clearing the scrub where I rounded it. His
track, if he had dry weather, would, on this basaltic soil, be
soon obliterated.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 7.&mdash;There was much difficulty in catching
the horses this morning, owing to their having improved so much
during the last few days' spell. Passed by Leichhardt's second L
tree; thence over a succession of downs and plains, intersected
by narrow and <span class="pagenum">{Page 134}</span> open scrub
of the acacia the blacks call "gurrt." Rain at night. Distance,
17 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 8.&mdash;Course still N.N.W. Crossed a sandy creek
with large bed, but no water; it was here running through
sand-hills, but lower down I could see it opened on the downs and
plains we had been traversing all morning. One mile beyond this
we killed an emeu. Passed another creek, with a pool of water,
luckily for the horses. We now ascended a high downs ridge,
surmounted by a belt of scrub. Still N.N.W. We had reached the
division of waters betwixt the Alice and Victoria. The first
creek crossed to-day was no doubt that crossed by Sir Thomas
Mitchell, arid which he marks on his map as a deep rocky channel.
Last 5¾ miles was through sandy box country, clothed with a grass
like knitting-needles. Camped without water at dusk. Distance,
20½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 9.&mdash;Shortly after starting we found a pool of
muddy or rather milky-looking water; the horses indulged in a
good drink, and we filled two of our excellent
water-bags&mdash;last night we found the benefit of them. I now
turned to my course again N.N.W., which we followed till I
discerned symptoms of a watercourse trending N. by E. 10°. A very
short distance showed I was right, and I followed it through a
scrub to where it joined a larger creek, which flowed W.N.W. This
creek I followed to camp (No. 13), at a place sufficiently open
and well grassed for my purpose. This creek had, after we came on
it, received two tributaries from the north-east, and had now
abundance of water, possibly, but not certainly, permanent.
Except the last 6 miles, the ground was the same sandy box
country, with the same grass, as yesterday
evening.&mdash;Distance, 16 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 10.&mdash;To-day travelled over a tableland of
sandy ground, with the same needle-like grass as yesterday. Then
descended into a broad sandy creek, with reeds, and which bad not
long ceased running; I called this the Patrick, after one of my
old comrades (aboriginal). The Patrick now ran N.N.W. 30°, and
then N.N.W. 25°; I therefore followed it till it turned N.W. 45°;
but I still followed it, for the heavy sandy ground and an
oppressively hot day I saw was distressing to the horses; at the
end of another 2 miles it turned N.N.W. 25°, when a half-mile's
ride brought us to a long reach of water, at which I camped, as
the day's work was too much broken into. Camp No. 14 is about 9
miles from the Alice. When I left the Victoria, I laid down in
pencil, on Mitchell's map, what I supposed to be the probable
course of the Alice, also a tributary which exactly answers to
the creek we were on last night, and which I have now called the
Macalister. The Patrick I fell in with 3 miles sooner than I
anticipated, but its northerly course <span class="pagenum">{Page
135}</span> makes up for that. I hope to fall in on the other
side of the Alice with a tributary coming from the N.N.W.,
possibly from the north. The advance party to-day saw very old
tracks of horses, and apparently mules, going down the Patrick. I
much regret not having seen them, as they must have been
Leichhardt's. Distance, 11 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 11.&mdash;Started Mr. Macalister, with
instructions to travel N.N.W. by compass. I pulled him up at a
beautiful camp, on a small creek, with excellent grass. The
country, after the first 4 miles, was all plains and downs,
intersected by small belts of the gurrt (acacia) scrub. The last
5 miles were over very fine downs, clothed with that excellent
grass I call rye (because it always grows near barley-grass).
From these downs I saw the range, about 25 miles to the east.
Distance, 9 miles (presumed).</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 12.&mdash;To-day we rode N.N.W. by compass, over
fine very high downs; crossed two small creeks flowing from them
N. by W., and camped at the head of a third. The range now lay
about 20 miles east, and betwixt us and it there was a fine downy
valley, evidently well watered. Day cool and pleasant, and horses
doing well on the excellent feed. Latitude by observation of Camp
16, 23° 17' S. Night cool; thermometer at daylight, 50°.
Distance, 15 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 13.&mdash;Our course N.N.W. by compass, took us
down the creek we had camped on, until it joined another water in
several places. We crossed this creek, and at the end of 7½ miles
from our camp we crossed a creek full of water, with an anabranch
flowing to the south-west. This I take to be the Alice. Hitherto
we have been on fine downs all day; within half a mile farther we
crossed a tributary coming from the north, and then another
tributary. By keeping our course N.N.W. we again crossed the
first creek, and camped on a fine reach of water. In the first
tributary we saw the finest reach of water I have seen this side
of the range, and at it was more than one black's camp. About 1
mile lower down than where we crossed the Alice, was a range on
the right bank, which I named Mount Rodney, after one of my
Murray men. As all three creeks meet there, I expect there must
be a large quantity of water at the foot of it. The two
tributaries both flow through acacia (gurrt) scrub for the last 5
miles; but where we have camped the country is more open, with
promise of improvement. It will be observed that we have seen
very little permanent water; but by following down the
watercourses into the valley which lay to our right the last two
days, I would expect to find abundance. Distance (direct) 11
miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 14.&mdash;The country at first was more thickly
covered with acacia than suited me; and as we now had hit the
creek again, I crossed it, and travelled parallel to it for a
short distance 60° W. of <span class="pagenum">{Page 136}</span>
N. by compass. The country now opened, and I resumed my N.N.W.
compass course, which in about an hour and a quarter brought us
to the summit of the downs ridge which separates the watershed of
the Alice from that of the Thomson. Some low ranges were seen to
the east, about 5 or 6 miles off, and a small one on the downs to
the west, about 3 miles, is probably where the two creeks we have
left take their rise. We now made 10 miles more over the downs,
and as we descended stony plains came to a beautiful river,
running W. by N. This, which is no doubt a tributary of the
Thomson, I have called the Coreenda. Mr. Gregory, when he left
the Thomson, says that river is formed by the small watercourses
emanating from the sandstone ridges; had I thought that, I would
not have ventured where I am now. This is splendid sheep country.
I have no doubt that many of the holes in the Coreenda are
permanent; but it is not possible to tell which, as that river
has not long since ceased running. It floods occasionally about a
quarter of a mile on each side, except where the downs approach
the bank. The gum-trees look as if drought were a complete
stranger to them, so fresh and healthy-looking are they.
Distance, 14 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 15. At Camp 18.&mdash;This day was one of
disappointment, for the boy Jemmy Cargara returned in the
afternoon without three of the horses, which he had been seeking
since daylight. This is the first time he has failed. I now sent
out three men on horseback, and they returned with the horses at
three. Shortly after I had unsaddled the remainder, Coreen Jemmy
and Patrick reported having seen the tracks of a considerable
number of horses. I sent a party to examine them; they returned
and reported there was no doubt of the tracks; that they were
very old, and had been there near a fine lagoon, about 2 miles
above my camp, and in wet weather. Aneroid, 29.5.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 16.&mdash;The early part of to-day's journey was
over plains covered with gurrt, at times rather too close; thence
past a watercourse and two lagoons, to sandstone ridges, with
needle-grass&mdash;very uncomfortable travelling. Four miles from
the lagoons we crossed the well-marked tracks of a very large
party going a little N. of W. These tracks were very old, and had
been made in wet weather. They will be visible probably for years
to come, whereas mine, made in dry weather, will be obliterated
the first rainy season. We then came on to the opposite declivity
of the sandstone ridges, and from thence saw a high peak which I
have called Mount Macalister, being 5° N. of W. by compass; and
another bluff mount, which I have called Mount Horsefeldt. I now
perceived why Leichhardt's tracks had been going west. He
probably camped on the Coreenda, above where my men saw the
horse-tracks; thence travelled parallel to my course, and, being
higher up the ridges, saw <span class="pagenum">{Page 137}</span>
the peak sooner than I did, and turned off towards it. I now saw
I was getting too intimate with the dividing range, and altered
my course to north-west by compass. One mile brought me to a
small watercourse, with many small pools of temporary water,
arid, as there was a sufficiency of good grass, I camped. How is
it that the blacks here have iron tomahawks? One has evidently a
broad axe. The blacks on the Nive, who are much nearer the
settlements, have only stone tomahawks, some very fine ones.
Distance, 25 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 17.&mdash;Started early on a north-west course,
when, having crossed a high ridge, we came on a river running to
the S. of W. This I believe to be the principal head of the
Thomson. Here were seen the old tracks of horses (Leichhardt's
camp was probably lower down on this river). We proceeded on the
same course, passing betwixt two basalt ridges. I now for a short
distance diverged to W.N.W., to get on a plain, when I resumed
the north-west course, over two basalt ridges. The basalt was
injuring our horses' feet, and I turned again W.N.W. to get on
the plains. We next crossed a creek followed by a ridge. I was
now able to resume the north-west course, and we hit a nice
lagoon, and another head of the Thomson running south-west
betwixt these two, and going N.N.W. were again the well-defined
tracks of Leichhardt's party (he must have had a considerable
quantity of wet weather). He had, no doubt, from Macalister's
Peak perceived he was on the verge of the desert, and turned
again to his old N.N.W. course. I now turned 25° N. of W. to go
to a peak rising off the downs. From this peak I saw displayed
before me an awful waste of endless plains. My man Patrick, who
ascended the peak with me, and who is accustomed to the immense
plains of the Edward and Murrumbidgee, was struck with
consternation, and he remarked to me, "There is no father side
this country." Upon leaving this solitary peak, which I have
called the Sentinel, I had to turn 10° W. of N. by compass. We
passed betwixt two terminations of spurs, over one ridge, to a
gum-creek, running by N. We searched in vain for water, and had
to push on over the next ridge, reaching another creek with
sufficient water for a day or two. Distance, 25½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 18. Spelled at Camp 20.&mdash;I took a ride for 3
miles down the creek, which runs W.N.W. through the plains. I
found another long pool of water, but fast drying up. We went to
the top of the next ridge to get a good view of the range. Found
I must still keep 10° W. of N. by compass. I observed a high
mountain in that direction, with a remarkable gap in it. I expect
to cross Leichhardt's track again to-morrow: of course whether we
see it will depend upon whether he was still travelling in a rain
season or not. The ground dries up here very quick. The
thermometer, <span class="pagenum">{Page 138}</span> from 12 to 2
P.M. was 96° in the shade; the aneroid is 29.4. By observations
taken from two different stars this morning, our latitude is 21°
50', 20 miles more north than my dead reckoning, which previously
never differed from the observations more than 3 miles. We have
travelled over some very good downs since leaving the sandstone.
Near the ranges the grass is sufficiently thick, but as they
slope down to the plain it gets thinner and thinner.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 19.&mdash;Good travelling all day. We crossed some
fine downs. At the end of the first 4 miles we crossed a creek
running W.S.W., and shortly afterwards another running
south-west; then came to a third which ran S.S.W.; 3 miles
beyond, pulled up the last of the waters of the Thomson
watershed. This one was running south. We were now rising fast,
and we travelled 2 miles upon a plateau of downs. Seeing the gap
I have spoken of a little on my right, I altered my course from
10° W. of N. by compass to north, and on the same plateau reached
it. I now turned down the opposite fall 10° W. of N. by compass,
and struck a large creek running in three and sometimes more
channels. This creek runs W.N.W., and is evidently the beginning
of a large river. Some very high mountains are now close to us to
the north. The aneroid is now 29.2, or 23.19. The gap we have
crossed could have been very little under the height of the main
range: where we crossed it, the aneroid stood at 28.9. Distance,
21½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 20.&mdash;Thermometer at daylight, 66°. I steered
N.N.W. by compass, over fine very high basaltic downs, but thinly
grassed in some places; we passed a tributary of the creek or
river we camped on last night, and camped on a much larger head
of the same river, which I have called the Haughton. We
unfortunately disturbed three blacks, and thus failed in having
an interview. They left very much worn iron tomahawks in this
camp, and I have added three new ones to it. The hole here,
though of great size and depth, is nearly dry. There do not
appear to have been any of the heavy rains here which fell on the
Victoria, as well as on the coast, in July and August. There is
no appearance of spring; the carrots, instead of being green,
like what they were on the Alice waters, have for the last few
days been quite brown and brittle. A very high mountain, E.N.E.
from the camp (No. 22), I have named Mount Gilbee, after Dr.
Gilbee, who moved the resolution that I should lead this
party.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 21.&mdash;Started 30° W. of N., till we crossed a
tributary of the Haughton; thence to the top of a scrubby spur of
the range, on which Patrick shot a turkey. I had now to turn
north by compass to get out on to a plain, then N. by W. by
compass, and crossed another tributary of the Haughton. Here
three of the men in vain looked for water, and we had to push on
over a ridge for 2½ miles. I ran down a creek W.N.W. for 4 miles,
and then W. by N. <span class="pagenum">{Page 139}</span> for 4
miles more, being enticed on from point to point by the
appearance of the gum-trees, and the hope of finding water to
bring my mare on to it. I saw it was of no use, and turned to the
top of a gap in a mountain I have called Pollux; another to the
east I called Castor. I had now a fine view of the country to the
north, and with my glass saw gum-trees across a plain about 5
miles off. We went down the slope of the downs, and reached some
splendid reaches of water, evidently the back-water of a large
river. We had, however, to leave four more horses on the downs,
and it was dark before we got our saddles off. The horses,
parched with thirst, having bad no water during a fearfully hot
day, rushed into the water, packs and all; luckily no damage was
done. Distance, 24½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 22.&mdash;A day's spell, as a matter of course, at
Camp 23, Jingle, in collecting the horses to-day, saw the river,
which he says is as big as the Dawson: we shall cross it
to-morrow, and likewise another, which I think comes round a peak
I saw from Mount Pollux, bearing by compass 12° E. of N. The
downs here are well grassed, and if the climate is not too hot,
this is as good sheep country as any in Australia. I have no
doubt that permanent water is to be found near this, but that at
our camp would not stand more than seven or eight months.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 23.&mdash;Went N.N.W. by compass, crossing the
river, which is a sandy dry channel, 90 yards wide: this is an
immense width, considering bow high we are, the aneroid standing
at 29.15. In about an hour, on the same course, we crossed a
large tributary, two-thirds of the width of the main river, which
I have named the Barkly, after the Governor of Victoria. A short
distance from this brought us to the tip of a basalt ridge; and
as a range was now in our way, I turned 32° W. of N. to the top
of another ridge, having crossed a small channel. I now turned
55° W. of N., and then due west to a small creek with two
temporary water-holes and good grass. As I must cross the range,
which I take to be a spur of the main range, I camped, not
wishing to attempt more to-day. I hoped to cross Leichhardt's
track, but we have seen no signs of it. As the Barkly is running
north-west, I think it probable he followed it as long as it kept
that course. I suppose this river, which I expect receives large
tributaries from the north, is a principal feeder of Stuart's
great lake, and that Eyre's Creek flows into it; if so, Burke
must have struck it. The thermometer this morning at daylight was
64°; this evening at sundown 86°. The aneroid 29.15. Night
squally, and aneroid rose to 29.25. Distance, 11½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 24.&mdash;When I got to the top of the range this
morning, I found I was on an extensive basaltic tableland. The
aneroid stood at 28.9. The range, with a peak which I saw from
Mount Pollux, stood in the midst of this tableland. Two very high
<span class="pagenum">{Page 140}</span> mountains were seen about
18 miles off; one 10° E. of N., and the other 20° E. of N. The
basalt was distressing to the horses, and we could not average 2
miles an hour. We were pulled up by a deep ravine with a large
creek at the bottom, and lined with cliffs of basalt columns; and
it was with some difficulty we found a slope of debris not too
steep for our descent; and then great care had to be taken. On
reaching the foot of the cliffs we ran down the creek W. by N. to
a fine pool, where we camped, having been five hours doing
(Distance) 6½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 25.&mdash;Made a fair start at 7.45 A.M. I
followed down Jingle Creek, as I wished to clear the basaltic
ranges if possible: 11½ miles in a general westerly direction,
now brought us to the Barkly River, leaving which we ascended to
a bit of downs. I now saw that a spur of the same basaltic ranges
must make the Barkly run W.S.W.; and, as there was no help for
it, I steered in that direction, crossing the river and camping
at a fine pool of water, with good grass and open
country&mdash;the 'beau ideal' of a camp. The large tributary
which I have called the Macadam, must have joined the Barkly at
the back of a spur I see from here, bearing 30° S. of E. I had a
view of both of them from the tableland, and then a plain
separated them. We have had lots of pigeons at this camp; a
lagoon about half a mile from here is reported to be permanent; I
shall probably see it to-morrow. The day has been very hot, and
yet not oppressively so, owing to a breeze which, although
blowing from the W.S.W., was, strange to say, cool. We have
generally had cool breezes from the east hitherto, at night
especially. After sundown the thermometer was 100°; aneroid,
29.2. Distance, 14½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 26.&mdash;I overtook the advance party, and found
them in vain endeavouring to get a parley with some gins who were
crouching in the long grass on the bank of the river. I gave them
some tomahawks, which gave them more confidence. One old lady who
spoke a language of which Jemmy Cargara understood a little,
stated that she had seen men like me many years ago down the
river; pointing W.S.W., she said another river joined it from the
south-east; this must be the Haughton. She also, in pointing
W.S.W., repeated the words "Caree Garee" several times. I now
turned north-west by compass, but the basalt again made us turn
S. by W. 10°, to a fine reach of water and fine feed for the
horses. I determined to spell here a day before attempting the
basalt, which, <i>coûte qui coûte</i>, I must surmount if I wish
to get to the north. Jingle having seen a little black boy near
this, Mr. Haughton went to the camp with three of my men, and
where he fell in with three black men: they had with them one of
the gins to whom I had given the tomahawks; this insured a
friendly reception and them returned to my camp with Mr.
Haughton. They <span class="pagenum">{Page 141}</span> gave us to
understand by signs, and by as much of their language as Jemmy
Cargara could comprehend, that this river flowed W.S.W. by
compass into Careegaree; that it was joined by another large
river from the north-east. If we went north-west by compass,
after crossing that river, we would go over a range and then come
to a river which ran north-west into Careegaree, by which we
conclude they mean the Gulf of Carpentaria; the other must be
Stuart's great lake. These blacks have superior spears, thrown by
a womera. One of grass-tree jointed was of immense length;
another, not quite so long, had three prongs, one of which was
barbed with a bit of bone fastened on with gum. Thermometer 86°
at sundown; at 12 to-day it was 88°, and 100° at 2 and 3 P.M.
Aneroid 29.21. Distance, 13 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 27.&mdash;Spelled (it being Sunday) at Camp 27.
The thermometer at 1 A.M. was at 68°; the aneroid rose to 29.25,
and subsequently to 29.32, but after 12 it went down to 29.19.
Yesterday evening Mr. Haughton and I ascended the range, at foot
of which is this camp. We found that it was still the same
tableland of basalt we have been skirting: however, by rounding
this point, we get, north-west, a short piece of good ground, and
then must encounter the basalt again. Day very hot. Thermometer
in shade 102° at 2 P.M.; 98° at 3; at sundown, 89°. The water at
this camp no doubt stands a long time, but as at present it is
only 5 feet deep, it cannot be deemed permanent, notwithstanding
its great length. Jingle yesterday saw some large lagoons of
permanent, or, as he terms it, old water, on the south side of
the river; and as there is a chain of such lagoons all along on
that side under the downs, no doubt many are permanent: on this
or the north side there are water-holes similar to that at this
camp whenever the spurs of the basalt tableland approach the
river. Jemmy Cargara, in looking for the horses this morning fell
in with the blacks again, and among them was now an old man who
spoke some words of his language. He said he doubted whether we
should find water for the horses in the first river we had to
cross. There is therefore more than one yet running into the
Barkly across our course. He told Jemmy, that after crossing a
river we should cross a range which came from Jemmy's country,
meaning, of course, the main range. Lat. 20° 46'. 1½' diff. from
dead reckoning.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 28.&mdash;Made an excellent 7 o'clock start. After
rounding the spur at No. 27, we had 1½ hour's fair riding,
north-west, until we reached the top of the basalt; then over
this spur, the descent and a ravine in it being so broken as to
cause me to fear some accident to the horses; luckily none took
place, and 2½ hours' fast riding north-west, over good undulating
downs, brought us to the first river, which I have called the
Dutton, after my friend Mr. Charles B. Dutton. The old black's
doubts as to the water proved <span class="pagenum">{Page
142}</span> correct, and as Rodney, by digging, found some within
a few inches of the surface, I determined to camp and make a pool
for the horses. To supply forty-eight horses was no light
undertaking, but all hands worked with a will, and before sundown
the horses were all satisfied, and had plenty to return to during
the night. The small black ants here are such a nuisance that no
one can sleep. Distance, 16 miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 29.&mdash;Pulled up very early at two nice pools
of temporary water, with good grass, as I do not deem it prudent
to pass water after the warning we have received. Distance 5
miles.</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 30.&mdash;Went 30° W. of N. to a gap on a downs
ridge; from thence saw a range ahead of us, and reached the
summit in 7 miles, same course, having crossed two large creeks.
We now travelled over this range, which was of red sandstone (of
course clothed with spinifex grass), north-west, and this brought
us to a fine channel of a river, where we disturbed a black
digging for water. We ran this river, which I have called the
Stawell, a short distance W. by N. by compass, where Rodney found
a beautiful spring water-hole, where we camped. The feed for the
horses is also excellent.* Thunder at night, and a few drops of
rain. Distance, 14 miles.</p>
<p class="foot">[* We had hardly unsaddled our horses, when the
voices of blacks were heard. Jingle, Paddy, and Jemmy Cargara
went down the river towards them, when, to their surprise, they
were addressed in Yarrinaakoo, the language spoken by the blacks
on the Comet, and told in angry terms to be off and not to come
there. My men resented this treatment, but fearing my disapproval
should they fire on them, as they wished to do, they came back
and reported to me that these blacks were "coola." We now heard
them shouting in all directions, very evidently collecting the
others who were hunting. In the meanwhile we had our dinner.
Shortly after they had collected what they deemed sufficient for
their purpose, and we heard one party coming up the river, and
another answering their calls from over the ridge near our camp.
It was time now for us to be doing, so I directed Mr. Macalister,
Mr. Haughton, Jingle, Paddy, and Coreen Jemmy to take steady
horses and face the river mob, whilst Jack and Rodney, and Jemmy
Cargara stopped with me to protect the camp and meet the hill
party. The mounted party met about thirty men, painted and loaded
with arms, and they charged them at once. Now was shown the
benefit of breech-loaders, for such a continued steady fire was
kept up by this small party that the enemy never was able to
throw one of their formidable spears. Twelve men were killed, and
few if any escaped unwounded. The hill mob probably got alarmed
at the sound of the heavy firing, and did not consider it
convenient to come to the scratch. The gins and children bad been
left camped on the river, and, as there was no water there, our
possession cf the spring was no doubt the <i>casus belli</i>.
They might have shared it with us had they chosen to do so. This
unavoidable skirmish ensured us a safe night, otherwise I think
there would have been some casualty in my party before morning,
as they can throw their spears 150 yards.]</p>
<p><i>Oct</i>. 31.&mdash;The question now was, what water were we
on, and had we crossed the main range or not? The river below our
camp turned a little S. of W. We went 11½ miles west by compass,
over very good downs, with a skirt of scrub on our right, and the
river trees visible a long way on our left. I now turned. W.S.W.
by compass, for the sake of getting water, and came upon, not the
Stawell, <span class="pagenum">{Page 143}</span> but a river
coming from the north-east. Thunder at night, and a little rain.
Distance (direct) 16½ miles.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 1.&mdash;Spelled at Camp 31. The grass is very
good here, and as we have now abundance of water we spell here
to-day; to-morrow we must make another try for the main range.
Yesterday evening I hit the Stawell below the junction of this,
which my men have called the Woolgar River. The Stawell now runs
south-west, and is evidently a large contributor to the Barkly.
There must, I think, be water somewhere near this, for we saw
three ducks pass in the night, and the cockatoos are numerous.
The bed of the Woolgar River I measured, 111 yards from the foot
of one bank to the other.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 2.&mdash;Spelled.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 3.&mdash;Spelled. At 3 P.M. thermometer 97°.
Spring found down the river, latitude 20° 16'. Cool night.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 4.&mdash;Still at Camp 31. Men all day in vain
searching for tracks of lost mare. Saw large pools of permanent
water in the Stawell.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 5.&mdash;Started an advance party N.N.W., and did
not get away in pursuit of it till afternoon, and so missed it.
It was dusk when we reached a tributary of the Stawell; Mr.
Haughton had not, however, stopped here, and, as we could no more
see the tracks, we searched for a spot to dig for water, as he
had all the water-bags with him. The place we tried gave every
symptom, but nothing beyond mud. There was no help for it, so
having tied up the horses we tried to sleep. The night was quite
cold. <i>Distance (out camp)</i>, 18 <i>miles</i>.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 6.&mdash;Reached Camp 32, and stopped remainder of
day. Mr. Haughton had got water in another tributary by digging.
Some blacks had been encountered near the camp, who had attacked
Paddy and Rodney, who were looking for water; one was killed by a
shot from Paddy. Thermometer 104° in the shade at 3 P.M., but a
cool breeze from south-west. Distance (from Camp 31), 26
miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 7.&mdash;Went N.N.W. by compass, over a tableland
of red sandstone, after having crossed some downs near Patience
Creek. I observed that rain had fallen not long ago, and the
grass was green; but it made me feel very grateful when I found a
small creek with abundance of good water, and fine feed for the
horses. Barometer 29.11. Distance, 11 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 8.&mdash;Notwithstanding the great heat, we
managed to do 16 miles N.N.W. and 3 W. by N. down a creek, but no
water. At first we tried to dig where we camped, but as the water
came too slow, went half a mile further down, and there found a
spring, which, being dug out, made a capital water-hole. Very
good burnt grass <span class="pagenum">{Page 144}</span> here. Is
this not a tributary of the Flinders? Ground very heavy all day.
Aneroid 29.25. Distance, 19 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 9.&mdash;So great was the heat and so heavy the
ground, that the horses were much distressed, and it was a great
comfort to find some bulrushes, good springs of water, and grass,
at the end of 10 miles. Our course has been, on an average, 32°
N. of W., and we had crossed over to a large creek still running
W.N.W.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 10.&mdash;Great delay in collecting the horses,
and did not start until 10; the consequence was, that the heat
and heavy ground, the latter worse than ever, nearly brought us
to a standstill. My course for first 2½ hours was N.W. by
compass. I then turned 32° N. of W., when I reached a large
river, with a fine pool of water 6 feet in depth. Short as the
day's stage was, we were obliged to camp. (No. 36.) Distance, 10½
miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 11&mdash;Started early down the river, and reached
another fine pool 14 feet deep, before the heat of the day. The
ground is also harder. An anabranch turned me N.W. by compass,
and hit the river again about 9 miles beyond. If the ground
opens, instead of being the brushy sandy country we have
encountered hitherto on these waters, I intend taking advantage
of the moonlight nights. Distance, 24 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 12.&mdash;Ground dreadfully heavy all day. This
day, I find from Mr. Haughton's report, as well as my own
experience, has knocked our horses out of time altogether, so I
must spell here a couple of days. Distance, 15 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 13.&mdash;Spelled. The thermometer at 109° at 5
P.M. in the shade; aneroid as high as 29.51.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 14.&mdash;Spelled. Upon looking at the horses, no
one would suppose they were so completely done up, for none are
in bad condition; but the dreadfully heavy ground, with the heat,
brings them to a stand-still at the end of 8 miles. This is a
melancholy, good-for-nothing country. Aneroid, 29.50. What does
this mean; for the sky is very clear, and there is a cool breeze?
The nights are still delightfully cool. There are flocks of
bronze-winged pigeons at this hole. Thermometer at 3 P.M., 103°
in shade; at sundown, 91°; Friday morning at daybreak, 61°.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 15.&mdash;We started at 5.30 P.M., and had a
pleasant ride at first over hard ground W. by S. 10°, and then
W.N.W.; this brought me to a pool of water, and I camped, for
although we have a splendid moon the brush is too thick to travel
by night. Distance, 7 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 16.&mdash;To-day reached what I supposed to be the
real river, the last two camps having been, as I suspected, on an
anabranch. The river turned us 32° N. of W. by compass; then a
course of W.S.W. brought us to a pool where it was deemed prudent
to camp. <span class="pagenum">{Page 145}</span> Aneroid, 29.64;
thermometer at 2 P.M., 105° in shade. Distance, 8 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 17.&mdash;To-day has been more encouraging; we got
an early start, and passed W. by N. over ground which was rapidly
improving and getting more sound. I now turned W. by S., and was
delighted to see some box-trees. The ground now is quite hard
along what I take to be an anabranch; this turned us W.N.W.
first, and then 6° S. of W., till the watercourse was no longer
visible; still keeping the same course we crossed over to another
branch. This is still too small for the main river, but my men
are inclined to think it is so notwithstanding. If so, this is
not the Flinders, but merely a tributary; it now turned W.N.W.
and then N.N.W., which brought us to a small pool of temporary
water, at which we camped. As we had a gentle breeze blowing from
the gulf, the day was not unpleasantly hot. At this camp (41) is
a remarkable oval ring, planted all round with tall thin saplings
placed about a foot apart; none of my men understand the meaning
of it. Distance, 20 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 18.&mdash;Managed to make camp before the heat of
the day, when we found a pool of water, and as Jingle could find
none within two or three miles lower, we camped. The morning was
made pleasant by the cool breeze from north-west. The river
to-day has averaged a course of 48° W. of N. by compass; it has a
better defined channel, and we passed one lagoon only just dried
up; after all it is a mere apology for a river. The ground still
continues hard, and is nearly all closed with spinifex; Jingle
saw large plains when looking for water lower clown; thermometer
at 3 P.M., 104°; aneroid, 29.82. The pigeons, both at the last
camp and at this, have been in large flocks; I was unwilling to
expend powder, of which I have only three canisters left, but as
I thought a change of diet beneficial, I allowed the men to shoot
at this camp, and the result was we had twenty-seven pigeons.
Distance, 12 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 19.&mdash;Fell in to-day with some gins, who could
give no information of white men, but gave us the pleasing
intelligence that henceforth there was plenty of water. The
country to-day is much more open, but there were no plains.
Aneroid, 29.83; thermometer at 3 P.M., 103° in shade. The river
is more respectable; it was joined by a creek from south-east 4
miles below Camp 42, where is an excellent pool with fish, and
good burnt feed. Distance, 19½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 20.&mdash;For the first 6 miles travelled 30° W,
of N. by compass; then N.N.W. for 2 miles, when we crossed the
river, having to-day been on the right bank. It now for 1 mile
kept the same course, N.N.W., and a plain extended along the
south bank; but now it turned north by east for 3 miles, and then
N.N.E. for 1 mile, <span class="pagenum">{Page 146}</span> when
we came to a deep permanent water-hole, and five blacks with gins
and children at it. A friendly intercourse was established, and I
gave 'them some tomahawks. They were subsequently joined by ten
or twelve more men. We camped here: the blacks on one side of the
water, we on the other. As this north-east turn of the river was
perplexing, an endeavour was made to ascertain which way it now
went. The blacks made us understand clearly enough that this
river now ran N.W. by N. by compass; we understood, but not so
clearly, that it joined another running more to the westward.
They told us to follow this watercourse, and we should at short
intervals find plenty of holes like this one. Large plains lay to
the north-west, and, strange to say, they used for this the word
"coonical," the same as Weerageree and Coreen Jemmy's language.
They said we must avoid going west, as the country was no good,
like what we had seen if we came down this river. They had heard
of no white fellows being to the N.W. or W.N.W. I now suspect
that what Mr. Gregory called the eastern end of the Gilbert, is
the real Flinders; and this I believe to be the tributary. The
country is now good, but a large proportion is subject to
inundation. It is a great relief to have done with the heavy
sandy country&mdash;with spinifex and brush of melaleuca, and
other rubbish. Aneroid, 29.85; thermometer, at 2.30, 108° in the
shade. The north-west breeze was cool this morning, but after 12
it now and then brought a hot blast from off the plains, which
are visible from the back of this camp (No. 44). Distance, 13
miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 21. I went the course directed by the blacks, N.W.
by N., but as this brought me, after passing the flooded plains,
to heavy sand, I turned off north, and found a chain of good
water-holes in the river, with good grass, and there camped. My
men got a few fish here, about half a pound weight each.
Thermometer in shade, 108° at 3 P.M.; aneroid, 29.84. Distance,
9½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 22.&mdash;To-day I followed the course of the
river, merely cutting off the bends. Great doubts are entertained
as to what river this is, for if it is the Flinders, I am 20
miles out in my longitude, and the way the blacks point, it ought
to take me by my map to the camp of 11th of September of Gregory;
but how this can be is a puzzle, considering the width of the
inundations and the abundance of permanent water. How does this
correspond with Gregory's dry irregular channels? Camped at one
of the finest sheets of water I have seen for many a day. Our
latitude, both by observation and dead reckoning, is 18° 18', and
this corresponds with Gregory's 11th September camp, and so does
my longitude. Distance, 17 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 23.&mdash;We went the first hour north-west, and
then north of west brought us round the end of a magnificent
reach of water to some small pools to camp. In the afternoon I
rode out to reconnoitre. <span class="pagenum">{Page 147}</span>
I saw the river was now going a little east of north, and was
again in long reaches. I struck out to the west, and came on some
box-flats, and on my return to camp passed a lagoon, which I had
no doubt was that which Gregory passed on his way from 10th
September camp to that of 11th September. My map is right after
all, and this I suppose is the river marked on the maps as Bynoe.
Distance uncertain.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 24.&mdash;I went out a little to the N. of W. by
N., and camped on the creek on which Gregory camped 10th
September. Distance, 5 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 25.&mdash;This eventful day, on a course W. by S.
5°, by compass, brought us to the Flinders River. We found it a
beautiful large river, with high banks, and a delicious cool
breeze blowing up it. We got a good many ducks, which were very
acceptable, for our meat was finished yesterday. At this camp,
latitude 18° 7', were found the well-defined trail of either
three or four camels, and one horse: they had come down the
Flinders. This night we had a tremendous thunder-storm; the first
heavy rain we have had since starting from Bauhinian Downs.
Distance, 16 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 26.&mdash;I had to go up the river 8 miles before
I could get a crossing-place, and last night's rain had made the
ground so heavy that the horses were much distressed. I therefore
camped as soon as we had crossed. This morning Jemmy Cargara, in
collecting the horses, found Burke's trail returning across the
plain, and going S.S.E. Grateful Creek, at Camp 33, and the three
large creeks crossed upon leaving it, are evidently the heads of
the Flinders, but the southerly trend which the main one took
caused me to cross it. The tableland is therefore the dividing
range. Distance, 8½ miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 27.&mdash;We went west by compass, crossing
Gregory's 8th September creek half-way. We have had plains all
day, but I can see low sandstone ranges not far on our left.
Night oppressive. Aneroid fell to 29.96 from 29.84. Distance, 18
miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 28.&mdash;Started W. by N. At first we passed over
plains so full of holes as to be distressing to the horses, who
were constantly stumbling. We now crossed a creek with deep
holes, but now dry. Higher up, where I saw many calares and a
clump of trees, I think there is water. We now began to rise, and
crossed over a spur of red sandstone ranges. Crossed two dry
channels, then a ridge of good downs, and finally reached one
head of Morning Inlet, and camped on some lagoons. This is very
good pastoral country, but I fear too hot for sheep. There is
much thunder hanging about, and some storms appear to have again
fallen on the Flinders, but none have reached us. A cool N.N.W.
breeze rendered the afternoon very pleasant, but the forenoon was
very oppressive. The <span class="pagenum">{Page 148}</span>
immense plains which stretch away to the north and north-west, I
suppose are the same mentioned by Captain Stokes. Sent a rocket
up at night. Distance, 15 miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 29.&mdash;Expected a storm, but it passed over.
Reached the main head of Morning Inlet, on a course west by
north. After rising from the creek at last camp, we rode over red
sandstone all day until we descended to box-flats, near the main
creek: the first part box-trees, broad-leaved and good grass; and
the latter portion melaleuca, nearly no grass, and with
innumerable cones, some 6 feet high, made by the ants. On the
banks of Morning Inlet was again, where the sandstone abutted on
the creek, the hateful spinifex grass. The plains are visible
north of this camp (53). Cool breeze from north-west. Night very
oppressive and sultry. Mosquitoes triumphant. Distance, 9
miles.</p>
<p><i>Nov</i>. 30.&mdash;After having crossed, not far from camp,
three creeks, or branches of a creek, we cleared the sandstone,
and rode across a fine plain, with a small creek in the centre,
and found on the west side a large creek, with two anabranches,
and a fine lagoon. We now crossed a sandstone ridge, with good
grass and box-trees, and reached a plain, on leaving which we had
to pass over downs and stony plains, of an excellent description
for pastoral purposes, to a hole in a good downs creek. I was
very glad to water the horses. Another mile brought me to where
Mr. Macalister had judiciously decided on camping on a creek
evidently flowing into the Leichhardt, which cannot be much more
than 2 miles ahead of us; indeed, I think I can see the trees of
it. Distance, 17 miles.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 1.&mdash;To-day has been an annoying day. I
first went W. by N. to some sandstone cliffs, descended from them
W.S.W. to a saltwater creek, which we had to run up E.S.E. for
nearly 4 miles, and the last corner took us east to complete the
4 miles, so that we have come back parallel to our course. We now
found some small holes of fresh water; having crossed this, we
went W. by N. and W.N.W., when we at last got to the Leichhardt
River&mdash;the water as salt as brine. We ran it up S.S.E. by
compass for 8 miles, passed by a black fishing at what looked
like a ford, just above the junction with a creek, which I take
to be that of Gregory's camp, 3rd September. The black never saw
us. There was now a good crossing place, but as Jingle signalized
there was fresh water in a creek at the back of a plain close at
hand, I went to it and camped. My men shot two ducks in the
river, and a couple of blacks were watching them a little lower
down the river. After dinner, or a make-shift for one, my men
went over towards the river in hopes of getting some ducks; but
as they were crossing the plain they saw two mobs of blacks
approaching. As their <span class="pagenum">{Page 149}</span>
appearance looked hostile, they returned to camp. Presently it
was reported that they were stretching out in a half moon, in
three parties. This move, which my men term "stockyarding," is
peculiar to blacks throwing spears with a woomera, the object
being to concentrate a shower of spears. It was one long familiar
to me, and I charged their left wing. The result was that the
circular line doubled up, the blacks turned and fled. Their right
wing, which was the strongest, got over the river and were off;
but the centre and left wing suffered a heavy loss. Distance
uncertain.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 2.&mdash;Rodney found in a black's camp a sailor's
jumper and an empty cognac bottle. The men (black) have all gone
to the river to shoot ducks, for I cannot cross over until low
water, which will be about 2 P.M. After crossing I made for
Gregory's Creek, of 3rd September, and there camped, reaching it
in four hours. Distance not given.</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 3.&mdash;Went W.N.W. to the Albert River; found
plenty of grass and the water fresh, but with a suspicion of
salt; more decided when the tide rose. We had crossed an
alternate succession of plains and flooded, box-flats with small
watercourses. Gun heard down the river at 8.7 P.M. Distance, 22
miles.</p>
<p>[It now appeared that Camp 57 was 8 miles only from Victoria
Depôt, but having started to reconnoitre with a single attendant,
Mr. Walker fell in with hostile natives, from whom he narrowly
escaped, and had to camp out. The second in command had meanwhile
been ordered to camp higher up, as it was not known the night
before that the depôt was so near. Next morning, 5th December,
they arrived safe at camp.&mdash;Ed.]</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 5.&mdash;Mr. Macalister had found Gregory's marked
tree, and also a bottle under ground, near a tree, marked by
Captain Norman, with directions to dig. The bottle contained a
note, stating the depôt of the <i>Victoria</i> was about 12 miles
lower down on the left bank. We now having saddled up, went up
the creek until we could cross it, just above where I had slept
last night. We then went N.W. by W. to Beame's Brook. Some delay
took place, owing to the creek being boggy, and I was glad to
camp as soon as we had crossed, for I was unwell from yesterday's
anxiety and fatigue; and as Captain Norman's note is dated 29th
November, there is now good hope of our meeting to-morrow.
[Distance uncertain.]</p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 6.&mdash;Proceeded E.N.E., but had to camp, in
order to make all safe for a storm. Night dismal, but the sound
of a cannon within two or three miles was a comfort, and produced
loud cheers. Distance, 16 miles. <span class="pagenum">{Page
150}</span></p>
<p><i>Dec</i>. 7.&mdash;In 2 miles, through a pelting hurricane
of rain, reached the depôt, and I had the pleasure of shaking
hands with Captain Norman.</p>

<p align="center">1. <i>Mr. D. Mclntyre's Journey across
Australia, from Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
discovery of supposed traces of Leichhardt</i>.<br>
<br>
<small>(Communicated by Dr. F. Mueller of Melbourne.)</small></p>
<p><span class="a">Dr. F. Mueller</span> has forwarded to us
various documents relating to the journey of Mr. Duncan McIntyre
across Australia, the result of which has been the revival of
projects for the search of Leichhardt and his party, in which Dr.
Mueller is taking a very active part. The movement set on foot by
Dr. Mueller has been already mentioned in the President's
Anniversary Address ('Proceedings,' vol. ix, p. 231).</p>
<p>A writer in the 'Riverine Herald,' who has had access to the
journals of Mr. <span class="pagenum">{Page 301}</span> McIntyre,
gives the following outline of his proceedings:&mdash;Mr. D.
McIntyre and his brother left Victoria about two years since,
with sheep, cattle, and horses, and a splendid outfit, intending
to proceed to the Gulf of Carpentaria. On their arrival on the
banks of the Darling, they found the river flooded, and were
unable to cross with their sheep. Mr. Duncan McIntyre then
proceeded northwards with a small party, in the endeavour to find
a good route to Cooper's Creek. In his first journey thither he
reached the waters, discovering several new creeks and lakes on
the road, and ascertained that no difficulty existed in taking
stock to that point. But on his return he learned, to his great
disappointment, that the Queensland Government had forbidden the
entrance of stock to their colony, either by land or sea, from
any of the other Australian colonies. Finding, therefore, that
they could not proceed towards the north, the party commenced
explorations of the country lying between the Darling and the
boundary of Queensland. Excellent country was found to the
westward of the Paroo, but no permanent water; and so greatly was
the party inconvenienced by the want of water, that they were
obliged to advance to the Queensland Rivers before they could
commence their return. On this journey better country was found,
some distance within the Queensland frontier, than had been seen
on the former trip. Pine rivers and lakes were discovered, and an
application was made to the Queensland Government for permission
to pass their boundary.</p>
<p>In the hope that this request would be eventually granted, Mr.
Duncan McIntyre, accompanied by Mr. Barnett, and taking with him
three natives and 25 horses, again proceeded towards the north,
with the view of ascertaining whether the Gulf country was
superior to what he had already seen. The party started with only
a small quantity of flour, rice, tea, and sugar, as provisions,
and did not take with them an ounce of meat. They had a good
supply of ammunition, expecting to find large numbers of ducks
and eggs on the route, as the season had been very favourable for
this description of game to the eastward. None of them, however,
were met with, as there had been no rain at all north of Cooper's
Creek; but the country was found to abound with opossums,
kangaroos, and emus. The last mentioned were in flocks of
hundreds in the neighbourhood of Cooper's Creek. A good many
bandicoots were also met with, and were found to be excellent
eating. Wild turkeys were seen everywhere, but were especially
numerous in the neighbourhood of the Gulf. Pigeons, too, were
found in thousands; altogether the party fared well on the game
shot by them, and had no reason to regret not having brought a
supply of meat. Fish, also, were caught in large numbers in all
the creeks, the party frequently taking more than could be eaten,
The tracks of a large animal of the kangaroo tribe, called by the
natives <i>Wongaroo</i>, were frequently seen, and a few of the
animals themselves; but they did not come within
shooting-distance. They are much larger than the kangaroo, and it
was calculated they would sometimes weigh 4 or 5 cwts.; some of
them were jet black, others brown with dark spots; they are less
swift than the kangaroo, but jump perpendicularly from one rock
to another, often to the height of 8 or 10 feet. They ascend a
mountain at a rate at which neither man nor dog can follow them.
A variety of new birds were seen, and Mr. Barnett collected a
large number of seeds. Mr. McIntyre speaks in high terms of
praise of his companion, who, although quite a young man, and
previously inexperienced in the bush, showed a surprising
aptitude for the work of exploring. It is known from Wills' diary
that Burke once killed a snake on his journey across the
continent, but no others were mentioned by him; and Landsborough
said he believed there were very few reptiles in the Gulf
country. Mr. McIntyre, however, states that he killed from five
to ten daily, in the tropical portion of his journey, and
sometimes two or three were found together. Many of them were
declared to be venomous by Mr. Barnett, who <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 302}</span> made a large collection of skins. The
natives of the party used the snakes that were killed as food,
and it was quite common to see them ride into camp in the evening
with a roll of some six or eight tied to their saddles.</p>
<p>The party left Dargonelly, River Paroo, on this expedition, on
the 21st of June, 1864, and reached Cooper's Creek twenty-two
days afterwards. They crossed the creek about 50 miles below the
junction of the Thompson. The course then taken was in the
direction of the new settlement in Northern Australia, with a
view of discovering how far a route for stock would be
practicable in that direction. This course was continued until
Burke's track was crossed, and so far no difficulty in conveying
stock was met with. The course was then changed for the
head-waters of the Albert River. In crossing the Northern Coast
Range, described by Burke as giving such terrible work to the
camels that they groaned and bled, the horses' feet got so much
worn down by the rocks and stones, that it became necessary to
follow a fall of water to the north, and afterwards to the
north-east, in order to get down to the low country. The Flinders
was struck on the 18th of August, a little south of Donor's
Hills, and the river followed from that point to the sea; the
journey from Cooper's Creek to the sea having occupied
thirty-four days, being a little more than half the time taken by
either Burke or McKinlay. Mr. McIntyre states that he was within
a mile of the coast, but having got in between two deep salt
mangrove creeks, he was hemmed in by a large number of blacks
whom he was obliged to charge at, in order to get out. He happily
succeeded in scaring them so much, that he had no occasion to
fire on them; but he was deprived by the circumstance of getting
sight of the ocean, which he could have done only by showing
fight, and shooting a number of them. He considered, however,
that this gratification would have been too dearly bought with
such a sacrifice of human life. On several occasions during the
journey across, large numbers of natives were met with, and once
an exchange was made with them for fish, some hawks shot by the
party being given in exchange. Neither in the coast-range, nor on
the journey out and back, was a single native shot Once or twice
an encounter seemed inevitable, but, by showing a firm front, and
seeming to disregard their presence, the necessity was
avoided.</p>
<p>The country to the north-west of the point where Cooper's
Creek was crossed was very indifferent for a day or two, and
waterless. It gradually got better on reaching a water-system in
which four new rivers were found, the first of which was named by
Mr. McIntyre the <i>Docker</i>. It then improved daily, and
splendid sheep-country was crossed in that part where the Stony
Desert of Sturt is laid down. The ground in places was, however,
covered with fragments of stones, and in some places "paved", as
described by Sturt, for a few miles. On the whole it was found to
be a good grazing country, and Mr. McIntyre considers that it is
particularly well adapted for sheep. A hundred miles or so to the
south of the tropic, the country assumes a high, undulating
character. The stones had for some distance previously entirely
disappeared, and the party now found themselves on beautiful
smooth downs. The country was magnificent the whole way from this
to the coast-range. Bald hills were met with at intervals, and at
short distances five gum-lined creeks were crossed, in some of
which there was an abundance of excellent water; but, owing to
the dryness of the season, none of them were found running, as
they were by Burke. In crossing the coast-range, great difficulty
was experienced both on the south and north side in obtaining
water, which was only to be met with in the gorges in rocky
basins. Nearly a week was occupied in getting over this
formidable barrier, and the horses suffered dreadfully from want
of feed, having sometimes to stand on perfectly bare rocks for
the whole night. In returning, the dividing range was crossed
without much difficulty, the heights between the two fells of
water, north and south, consisting only of high undulating downs
without any stones. No mountains or lulls were visible to
<span class="pagenum">{Page 303}</span> the west, but some lofty
peaks were seen at a great distance to the east. In fact, from
the Gulf to the banks of the Darling at Mount Murchison, a
splendid road could be made, along which a buggy might be driven
without a single impediment. A railway might be run across at a
very light expense, there being no engineering difficulties in
the way, with the exception of crossing the rivers. The route
also is the most direct from Mount Murchison to the Gulf. The
Flinders is now peopled by squatters from its head to within 280
miles of the sea. One station, however, is even 130 miles lower
down. From what could be learned of the squatters they had lost
about 30 per cent, of their sheep from the poison-bush, in coming
over the ranges from Queensland. The sheep generally looked
healthy but poor, although there was plenty of grass. Great
losses had occurred also among the cattle from the poison-bush of
the mountains, and at least 50 per cent, had been lost from
pleuro-pneumonia. A very large percentage of horses had died from
snake-bites. The average lambing on the Flinders was not expected
to be more than 15 per cent. From the description of the Flinders
given by Mr. Landsborough, it would be inferred that it was a
finely-watered river. He states that, when he left it, it was 120
yards wide, with a stream flowing along its bed. Twenty miles
from the sea, Mr. McIntyre crossed it dry; higher up, it was
often dry for 10 miles at a stretch, and the general width was
found to be from 30 to 40 yards. The party called at the Bowen
Downs Station, at the head of the Thompson. The cattle there were
all clean and in splendid condition, notwithstanding the dryness
of the season. From that point to Cooper's Creek the country was
well watered, but unstocked. The whole of the country between the
Darling and Cooper's Creek has been minutely examined by Mr.
McIntyre, who states that, even in the driest season, the route
is perfectly practicable for stock, there being three permanent
rivers between the Paroo and Cooper's Creek. A journal and
field-book, on an excellent system, were kept throughout the
journey; and the position of all the rivers and important points
ascertained by astronomical observations, and the magnetic
variations carefully notched. Not a single shower of rain fell
during the trip across to the Gulf and back.</p>
<p>With regard to the supposed traces of Leichhardt discovered by
Mr. McIntyre, these consist of certain marked trees in the
neighbourhood of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and two old strayed
horses, which the traveller brought back with him. The trees were
each marked with a single L, cut evidently by a skilled hand. One
of the letters was cut in the bark, and was 32 inches long, by
about 12 inches in width. The other was marked deeply in the
wood, the bark having been removed for the purpose. This latter
was 5½ inches long, and cut evidently with an inch-and-a-half
tomahawk. These marked trees were close together, showing that a
camp had been established between them, and unquestionably during
a dry season, as they stand on flooded ground. As to the horses
found by Mr. McIntyre, it is remarked that no horses have ever
been lost, in the neighbourhood of the locality in which they
were found, by any known explorer. Both of them were old horses.
Mr. McIntyre says that he had horses in his troop fifteen or
sixteen years of age, which performed the whole journey well,
while those picked up by him were knocked up in a very short
time. This is advanced as a proof of their being of great age,
for, when found, they were "rolling fat". There were illegible
brands on both of them, and there was a blotched brand on the
same part of the back of each. One of them was a bay, and the
other a black.</p>
<p>Further details of these discoveries of Mr. McIntyre were
given in a letter to the Editor of the 'Age' by Dr. D. Wilkie and
Dr. F. Mueller; the most important were as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>"On a new principal tributary of the Flinders River, Mr.
McIntyre passed to the main stream of the Flinders, observing in
about 20° 40' S., and about one degree westward of Burke and
Wills' track, two old horses, an event to <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 304}</span> which too much importance cannot be
attached, when it is remembered that neither the Victorian
explorers, nor Landsborough, nor A. Gregory, nor Leichhardt, in
his first glorious expedition, abandoned any horses in any
adjacent locality, Mr. Walker's horses being left about 300 miles
to the east. A still more important discovery rewarded Mr.
McIntyre's exertions after having reached, on the Flinders line,
the Gulf of Carpentaria; for, on his return journey, whilst
following up the main east branch of the Flinders River, he
noticed on its western bank, in approximate latitude 20° S., two
trees, each bearing a large L, no number attached, marking, as we
with McIntyre feel convinced, a Leichhardtian camp. These L's are
clearly distinct from any marks of Landsborough's camps, who in
that latitude kept to the eastern bank of the Flinders, and who,
moreover, attached a consecutive number to his marked camp-trees.
If further proofs of distinction were wanting, we might add that
the bark had encroached to the extent of four or five inches on
the incision of the letters, whereby a much greater age is
established than that of Landsborough's camps; and still further,
we have the evidence of one of the natives who served in both
Landsborough's and McIntyre's expeditions, who declares that the
camp did not belong to the expedition of Landsborough. The
position of these momentous trees being in flooded ground, it
would have been vain to search for further camp traces."</p>
<p>An account of the agitation, set on foot at Melbourne, for a
new expedition in search of Leichhardt, or further traces of him,
is given in the following extracts of letters from Dr. Mueller to
Sir Roderick Murchison. The first letter is dated 24th January,
1865. "By the enclosed documents you will perceive that the
account of Leichhardt's massacre on the Baroo is entirely
disproved by Mr. McIntyre's expedition. As a fellow-labourer with
Leichhardt in the field of the Natural Sciences in this country,
I feel I owe it to him not to cease in my exertions for the
revelation of his fate, especially now that our knowledge of his
movements has passed into a new phasis. Within a few days I
contemplate lecturing publicly on the subject, to endeavour to
arouse sympathy for the forsaken travellers, and to call upon the
ladies of all Australia to gather the means of sending forth a
new searching party. What a triumph if the Ladies' Expedition
should disclose Leichhardt's fate! If you would extend your
sympathy to the poor forsaken men, your weight of authority would
exercise a most favourable influence on the new enterprise,
which, even if it fail to solve the Leichhardt mystery, would not
fail to reveal many an interesting feature of the Australian
interior." On the 24th of February Dr. Mueller again
writes;&mdash;"It was a bold step on my part to call forth a
Ladies' Committee, as we have no precedent for such an
organization; but it has proved successful, and I believe that in
future we may rely upon the ladies for assisting in many other
philanthropic objects in a similar manner. Should a spirited
leader be found for the expedition, and a sufficient fund, I have
no doubt that the enterprise will be afterwards carried on by
successive private contributions and occasional Government
subsidies, until Leichhardt's fate is fully known, and therewith
the greater part of the yet unknown western interior
explored."</p>
<p>The last communication from Dr. Mueller, dated the 22nd of
April last, announces the successful progress of his scheme. He
says, "The Leichhardt movement is fully secure; it is merely a
question whether the Ladies' Search Expedition takes the field
six months earlier or later. The 'Brisbane Courier' says, 'Never
can we allow the Victorian ladies to do this work of charity and
humanity alone; Leichhardt dead or Leichhardt alive, we have no
business to remain for seventeen years in uncertainty about it!
The ladies have written to Her Majesty, the Princess of Wales,
and the Empress of France, and I have advised them to address
also the Princess Royal of Prussia. Although the 3000<i>l</i>.
for the first two years' search will be unquestionably
gathered&mdash;if not <span class="pagenum">{Page 305}</span>
here alone, at least by the aid of the generous and wealthy of
the globe&mdash;it may be found necessary to have the search
continued for several years more. Under any circumstances the
Ladies' Expedition is likely to accomplish what Leichhardt
intended, namely, to open up the great western half of the
continent, an object, next to the exploration of Central Africa,
the most important in the whole domain of Geography. If once the
Ladies' Expedition is fairly started, and despatches of interest
and hope are received, it will then need only about 300<i>l</i>.
annually from each of the Governments of South-Eastern Australia
to maintain it in the field."</p>
<p>The following letter from Mr. Edward Wilson, of the 'Melbourne
Argus,' to Sir Roderick Murchison, relates to the same
subject:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<span class="a">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>"You showed such an intelligent interest in our friend
Mueller's new movement in search of the unfortunate Leichhardt,
that I think it right to forward you a passage from his last
letter, and also an article from the recent Melbourne papers.</p>
<p>"Although I am well aware of the difficulty you point out of
arousing effective assistance in such a case, this seems a very
peculiar one, and presents features which really deserve the
attention of your great Society.</p>
<p>"Although these poor men have been lost for seventeen years,
the annals of Australian discovery present remarkable instances,
which should prevent us from looking upon any enterprise in
searching for them as hopeless. You will remember the astonishing
case of Buckley, who was found by the first settlers at
Melbourne, after <i>thirty-three</i> years' residence among the
blacks, and that case of the sailor Morrill, discovered in
Moreton Bay after a residence amongst the blacks of twenty years.
A very possible condition of affairs is that which would ensue
from the death of Leichhardt,&mdash;himself dead, no one else of
the party capable of conducting the expedition, and the survivors
or some of them being still amongst the blacks. In any event the
contingency pointed out by Dr. Mueller seems very probable that
this research, if properly supported, will open out the western
portion of the interior of the continent.</p>
<p>"Permit me to say. Sir, that the functions of your valuable
Society seem scarcely to exhaust themselves in the reception of
great discoveries and the publication and recording of them, and
that a very large amount of sympathy must always be felt for
those who fail indeed in these gigantic enterprises, but more
still for those of whose fate we are left in doubt.</p>
<p>"The vast prestige attaching to your Society, and to the
formation of which you have yourself so greatly contributed,
would render any amount of recognition upon its part of immense
value to an enterprise of this kind, even if no pecuniary
assistance could be rendered; and as it seems likely that this
scheme may grow into a sustained and prolonged effort, it is very
important that we should give it all the influence that we can
secure for it, from whatever source.</p>

<p>"<span class="a">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to report that the Queensland Parliament has
voted 1000<i>l</i>. in aid of an expedition in search of the
long-lost German explorer Dr. Leichhardt; that the Parliaments of
Victoria and South Australia, following the example of
Queensland, have voted each 500<i>l</i>. for the same object;
that private contributions to the amount of about 1500<i>l</i>.
have also been collected in Australia (chiefly in Victoria and
Queensland), and that the sums realised from these various
sources being sufficient to maintain the proposed expedition
during two years, it has started on its journey.</p>
<p>"I may probably be expected to recapitulate briefly the
salient points of this case. Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, a native of
Prussia, studied medicine and natural science at the University
of Berlin. He emigrated to Australia in 1842, while still a very
young man, and soon distinguished himself by his valuable
botanical and mineralogical researches and collections in various
parts of the interior, and especially in the districts now
forming the colony of Queensland. In 1844 he undertook the
leadership of an expedition which was equipped for the purpose of
discovering an overland route between Moreton Bay on the eastern
and Port Essington on the northern coasts. The Imperial
Government at that period maintained a post (since abandoned) at
Port Essington; and Leichhardt reached it after a journey of
fifteen months, during which his party traversed upwards of 3000
miles of country, which, for the most part, had been previously
unexplored. They returned to Sydney by sea, and were received
with public manifestations of joy, as it had been supposed that
they had all perished. Rewards were voted to Leichhardt and his
comrades by the Colonial Legislature; and, after some delay and
one unsuccessful start, another expedition was equipped, with
which he determined to attempt to cross the Australian Continent
from east to west&mdash;from Brisbane to Perth. Leichhardt
started on his final expedition from Moreton Bay at the beginning
of 1848, and the last account received from him was contained in
a letter which he wrote in April of that year from the banks of
the River Cogoon, in what is now the Maranoa district of
Queensland. The mystery connected with his fate still remains to
be cleared up after a lapse of 17 years. As it was understood
that his journey would occupy at least two years, no special
anxiety began to be felt for his safety until towards the close
of 1851, when the Government of New South Wales sent out a party
in search of him under the command of Mr. Hovenden Hely. Starting
from Brisbane thus party proceeded to the Maranoa district,
whence Leichhardt's last letter had been despatched. Mr. Hely was
there informed by some natives that the white men, with their
horses and cattle, had been all killed by the blacks at a point
about 200 miles to the west of Mount Abundance.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hely's discouraging report received general credence for
some time; but of late years discoveries have been made which
tend to invalidate it. Mr. Augustus Gregory, in his expedition of
1858, found what are believed by many persons to be traces of
Leichhardt's encampments on the river Barcoo, far to the
north-west of the spot where he was said to have been massacred
by the aborigines. Again, Mr. Frederick Walker, when searching in
1861 for Messrs. Burke and Wills, found traces still further to
the north, near the junction of the rivers Alice and Barcoo.
Lastly, a few months ago, Mr. Duncan M'Intyre, a pioneer squatter
of Queensland, came upon trees marked with the initials of
Leichhardt's name on the banks of the River Flinders, which flows
into the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Mr. M'Intyre also found
two aged horses in the same locality; and their discovery in
close proximity to the marked trees is thought to render it
probable that they belonged to Leichhardt's expedition. Here
there were traces of the lost explorer more than <span class=
"pagenum">{Page 60}</span> 300 miles beyond the spot were he was
reported to have fallen a victim to the hostility of the
aborigines.</p>
<p>"Dr. Mueller, the Director of the Botanical Gardens at
Melbourne, a friend and countryman of Dr. Leichhardt, has never
ceased to urge the probability that the gallant leader, or some
of his little band of explorers, may still be alive in some
remote wilderness; and that a well-organised expedition might be
the means of rescuing them from a long and dreadful exile among
the savages of the interior. It will be recollected that in 1835,
an Englishman, named Buckley, was restored to liberty and
civilisation after a captivity of above 30 years among the native
tribes which then roamed over the site of what is now the great
city of Melbourne. Among several similar examples we may also
mention the case of the shipwrecked sailor James Marrill, who, in
1863, was rescued by our frontier settlers after a captivity of
17 years among the blacks of Northern Queensland. Moreover, the
question of a renewed search for the missing expedition was
warmly taken up by Mr. Landsborough and by other distinguished
Australian explorers, and by several leading members of the
medical profession (to which Dr. Leichhardt had belonged), who
lately published an earnest appeal in his behalf.</p>
<p>"Dr. Mueller further conceived the idea of enlisting in this
cause the sympathies, more especially, of the ladies of
Australia. He succeeded in forming at Melbourne a committee of
ladies, who undertook to collect subscriptions, and to press the
question on the favourable consideration of the Governments and
Parliaments of the several colonies. They addressed an earnest
appeal to Lady Bowen to procure the aid of the ladies of
Queensland, on the ground that this colony owes most to Dr.
Leichhardt, having, been to a large extent explored by him. In
compliance with this appeal, Lady Bowen convened at Brisbane a
public meeting of the ladies of Queensland, and the leading
gentlemen of all parties attended. The President of the
Legislative Council (Colonel O'Connell) occupied the chair, and
made an eloquent and interesting speech, which will well repay
perusal. I transmit a copy of the proceedings, as reported in the
local journals, and also of the letter of the Victorian Ladies'
Committee, tendering their acknowledgments for Lady Bowen's
assistance. Her social influence and that of the other principal
ladies of Queensland has since been exercised so successfully
that the Colonial Parliament (as I have already said) has voted a
liberal grant in aid.</p>
<p>"It need scarcely be added, however, without detracting from
the merits of these ladies, that the shrewd, practical men who
form the Government and Parliament of Queensland would not have
sanctioned any expenditure of public money in a fit of
enthusiasm, or without the certainty of tangible results. As the
scene of the operations of the new "Leichhardt Search Expedition"
will be principally within the bounds of this colony, it is felt
that, whatever may be the success of the expedition in other
respects, it cannot fail to add largely to our knowledge of the
remoter portions of our territory, and so to assist materially in
the development of our resources in various ways, and to an
extent which will be cheaply purchased by a contribution of
1000<i>l</i>. from the public funds.</p>
<p>"Mr. Duncan M'Intyre has himself undertaken the leadership of
the expedition, which set out from Victoria a few weeks ago, and
is to be finally organised in Queensland during the present
month. It will consist of from 8 to 12 carefully-selected
"bushmen", with 14 camels, and about 40 horses. Supplies of all
kinds will be provided for a consumption of two years. The
expedition will proceed in the first instance to the spot on the
banks of the Flinders, where the last traces of Leichhardt were
observed by Mr. M'Intyre. Thence It will continue the search
towards the interior of the Australian Continent in whatever
direction the discovery of further traces, or information derived
from the aborigines, may seem to render most advisable.
<span class="pagenum">{Page 61}</span></p>
<p>"Now that this enterprise has been actually started, no effort
will be wanting on my part, or that of the Government, to afford
it assistance. The explorers will be able to procure from time to
time fresh supplies at Burketown, the new settlement recently
established on my recommendation at the head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>
<p align="right">"<span class="a">G. F.
Bowen</span>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be seen by passages in the above communication, that
the promoters of the Search Expedition believe other results will
flow from the exploration, even should it fail in recovering any
surviving member, or obtaining further traces of Leichhardt's
party. Our geographical knowledge of the interior of the
continent cannot fail to be greatly increased by an expedition so
well-equipped, and commanded by so able a leader as Mr. Duncan
M'Intyre. On this aspect of the question Dr. Mueller thus writes,
in a letter dated July 21, 1865, to Sir Charles Darling, Governor
of Victoria:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Independently of our fulfilling the dictates of gratitude and
humanity, incalculable advantages for colonization, industry, and
commerce would accrue from a further exploration of this great
and solely British continent, over which, unhindered by the
native population, the stream of settlement may spread. I see
that the thousands perishing annually by cold and famine in
overpopulated spots of the mother country, if brought to the
unoccupied and everywhere salubrious Australian territory of the
British Crown, might live in health and prosperity. I maintain
that it has become a point of honour to the million and a half of
civilised inhabitants, occupying as yet but little beyond the
coast tracts of Australia, to throw open by exploration and by
scientific research, for occupation, for industry, and for
settled homes, the whole interior of this continent. I perceive
that we cannot fix even the lines of the telegraph, which most
advantageously are to unite us with the northern hemisphere, and
indeed with the world, until we have withdrawn, as Leichhardt
intended to have done, the veil from the still so extensively
unknown interior. I cannot but contemplate, that of the real
wealth of Australia in treasures of copper and gold we cannot
form even an approximate estimate, until in many paths the space
from coast to coast shall have been traversed."</p>

<p align="center">6. <i>Last Letter of</i> <span class="a">Mr.
Duncan McIntyre</span>, <i>Leader of the Leichhardt Search
Expedition, and an Account of his Death</i>.<br>
<br>
<small>(Communicated by the <span class="a">Colonial
Office</span>.)</small></p>
<p><span class="a">Subjoined</span> is an extract from the last
despatch of Mr. McIntyre to his uncle, D. Campbell, Esq., and
also a despatch from the second in command:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right">"Gregory River, 2nd May,
1866.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I wrote you about five weeks ago from the Gilliot River,
sending a lot of accounts and other papers connected with the
expedition. The dromedaries, horses, and men needed rest for a
few weeks. I got another man, named McLeod, and two of the black
boys Donald [McIntyre, the explorer's brother], brought over with
the cattle and seven horses. On the 2nd April I started in search
of further traces of Leichhardt, and also to call at the port to
get some more rations.</p>
<p>"Nothing of any consequence happened during the first week. We
passed over splendid country all the way, until we entered the
watershed of the Leichhardt River; the country there became rough
and stony. It took us nearly a week, going straight west, before
we got to the main branch, which we crossed and kept west for one
day more. The country then was all but impassable; our horses not
being shod could not stand it, so we had to turn eastward again
to the main channel of the Leichhardt, which we followed down in
three days, when we reached the settled, districts, Kennedy and
McDonald being the farthest out on the Leichhardt. We still kept
the river imtil we passed the next station, 40 miles lower down;
we then left it, and struck out north-west, and in about 50 miles
arrived at T.G. McDonald's station on the Gregory. Here we were
informed of the unhealthiness of the <span class="pagenum">{Page
43}</span></p>
<p>climate, a man having died a few days before our arrival; his
grave was quite close to the bit of a shed they called a hut.
There being only two on the station, the survivor was unable to
carry his unfortunate companion to any distance. We kept on down
the river, and in due time arrived at what is called the township
[Burketown] or port. The population was about sixty, forty-five
or fifty being bad with the fever; in fact people were sick
everywhere. I could not count ten able to do anything in the
shape of work. I camped at a lagoon about a mile from the town
[Burketown], thinking that I was away from all the sickness.
There were two tents near us. Next morning one of the men in the
tents was dead; and, on going up to the township to get the
stores away, I was told two more had died that morning. I got my
stores and started up here, 16 miles higher up. While putting
them into order for packing on the horses, one of the black boys
got the fever, and this morning McLeod has it. The black boy, I
think, will get over it; but McLeod thinks it is all over with
him. I am all ready, only waiting for the men to get well. I hope
in a few days they will get better; it does not last long, in a
week one is either in one's grave or well again.</p>
<p>"Before I came here there were about eighty in the town,
sixty-six of whom were bad with fever. I am told that twenty-five
are all that have died in the town, and they are making up
coffins for two more, who are past recovery. I hope I shall get
away all right; people are leaving by sea and land, as fast as
they can. There are two stores; flour, tea, and sugar in
abundance, but of very bad quality&mdash;the flour we can hardly
eat, as it is quite sour; and there are two public-houses. The
present site of the town is on a plain only a few feet above the
level of the sea.</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is something unusual in the atmosphere this
season; but the natives of the country appear to be all
right.</p>
<p>"We have met with no positive trace of Leichhardt yet; but we
have ascertained beyond a doubt that whites are now, or have
been, among the blacks within the last ten years. There is a boy
and a girl, from ten to twelve years of age, almost white, with
light blue eyes and red hair; and in another tribe, a girl about
fifteen years of age; and in another a full-grown woman, perhaps
eighteen years of age; and there is a rumour of a white man being
within a day's ride of this, among a strong tribe of about two
hundred; they are very fierce; none of the settlers have come to
any terms with them yet. They will come out on the open plain,
and fight to the last. I have been after this supposed white man
already. I was accompanied by the officer in charge of the native
police here; he had two troopers with him, I had also a black
boy. We saw between thirty and forty blacks; but there was no
sign of white men among them. We had to make prisoners of them
all before they would allow us to see them properly. In order to
have an interpreter, we took a young fellow with us to the police
camp. He is now quite at home; in three or four months he will be
able to speak a little English, when, if not before, we shall
learn all about how the half-castes came among the blacks.</p>
<p>"The blacks are now all collected near the sea-coast between
the Albert and Leichhardt rivers, with the white man or
half-caste among them. They are said to be well armed, and give
chase to all the whites that approach there. This, of course, I
do not believe.</p>
<p>"I know they are mostly very bold, and stout able fellows. One
of them nearly took the carbine from the officer, when we were
out the other day. They have no fear whatever of fire-arms. As
soon an I can get away tomorrow, or next day, perhaps, I intend
going to where the blacks are, and camp somewhere there, until I
find out all about who the white man is, or whether he is only a
half-caste; but I am sure there is something in it. However, I
shall learn about it in a few days. I think the officer and
native police will go with me, as there is only myself and one
black boy able to do <span class="pagenum">{Page 44}</span>
anything, and two are not enough to surround one hundred or more
blacks, and disarm them, whereas five or six can do so without
shooting any.</p>
<p>"We were camped for nearly two months among 600 blacks at
Cooper's Creek. They were at times very troublesome, but we never
had to shoot any, although they richly deserved it sometimes. We
saw no blacks until we reached the tropics. We had no trouble
with them. On this expedition we saw a good many, and traces of
large tribes every day, especially at the head of the Leichhardt.
We could get no information from any we saw, and had great
trouble in getting near them; but once up to them they always
considered themselves prisoners; I suppose from some custom among
themselves. They are canibals here and all the way up the east
coast. I have seen no positive proof of their eating one another,
but they have the same habits as those that are further eastward.
I have had no time to examine many camps yet; those which I have
searched contained nothing but what all wild blacks have: no sign
of iron or any metal in any shape. The head of the Leichhardt,
and also the western branches of the Flinders River, are a great
harbour for blacks. They contain so many mountain passes, that a
few natives could defend them against a regiment of soldiers.
Mountains perpendicular for 600 and 800 feet, in some places
narrower above than below [the mountain passes]. Except in the
beds of the watercourses the country is quite impassable for
anything; but a man without boots or shoes might, like a black
fellow, get up one ravine and down another.</p>
<p>"It requires one to be very cautious in travelling through a
country of this description, to avoid being surprised by natives
or having one's retreat cut off: one great advantage, however,
[exists] in the abundance of permanent water everywhere, but feed
is often scarce. Since leaving the depot camp on the Gilliot we
have explored about 500 miles of new country, mostly along the
northern face of the coast mountains. We passed over what, I have
no doubt, will prove to be a rich gold field before long. We did
not find any gold; but from, the character of the country I have
not the least doubt of its existence: should the search in this
neighbourhood be unsuccessful we shall cross the coast range
immediately, and continue the search on the southern or inland
waters about south-west towards Swan River.</p>

<p>"<span class="a">Ladies</span>,</p>
<p>"It is with feelings of the deepest sorrow that I beg to
communicate to you the melancholy intelligence of the death of
our leader, Mr. Duncan M'Intyre, which occurred on the morning of
the 4th inst., at his brother's camp on the River Gilliot.</p>
<p>"I will endeavour, as clearly as I can, to narrate the
circumstances immediately preceding and attending his death,
feeling convinced that they will be of the most painful
interest.</p>
<p>"Mr. M'Intyre, accompanied by Archibald M'Leod and two black
boys, left this camp on the 3rd April, and proceeded in a
direction slightly to the northward of west to the River
Leichhardt. As he has since informed me, after perfectly
convincing himself that Leichhardt could not by any possible
chance <span class="pagenum">{Page 45}</span> have taken his
party over the country he saw there, he travelled generally in a
north direction, following the river down to 18° 56' S. lat. Here
he left the Leichhardt and struck across for the Gregory on his
way to the township on the Albert River, where he purposed buying
horses and rations. He arrived at Mr. J.G. M'Donald's station on
the Gregory on the 18th April. The next day, while following the
river down, M'Leod, who was leading the horse which carried the
rations, unluckily missed Mr. M'Intyre's track, and he and the
black boys were in consequence without food of any sort excepting
one iguana until they arrived at the Landsborough River Company's
station on Beau's Brook on the evening of the 20th. Near this
station he camped till the 4th May, making such visits to the
Albert River township, distant 16 miles, as business required. At
this time a disease generally known there as "the fever" was
raging in the township, and M'Leod and M'Loughlin, who entered
the service of the expedition there, as well as the two black
boys (one of whom has since died from its effects), were attacked
by it. Mr. M'Intyre apparently escaped; but he afterwards, on the
13th May, told me that on one occasion he had feared he had
caught it, but was determined to, and did, shake it off. On the
20th May we (I had in the mean time joined the party) arrived at
the River Dugald, where Mr. M'Intyre resolved to leave us while
he and one black boy proceeded to the Gilliot, distant 50 miles
east from the former river, to bring the other portion of the
expedition to us. Up to this time he had been by far the
strongest man amongst us. Next morning he felt unwell, and
attributed it to his having lain in the smoke which arose from a
hollow damp log on the fire during the night. Next day he was
still unwell; but on Wednesday, 23rd May, he started for the
Gilliot, intending to be back in about a week. I did not again
see him alive.</p>
<p>"The dromedaries, &amp;c., arrived at the camp on the Dugald
on the 29th May; and by that opportunity Mr. M'Intyre forwarded
me a note of instructions, informing me therein that owing to
extreme weakness he had been unable to reach the Gilliot on the
same day he left us, but that he arrived there the next morning
in a very exhausted state. He also said then (26th May) that he
felt better, and hoped to rejoin us in a few days.</p>
<p>Late in the evening of the 2nd June, I received a note from
Mr. Donald M'Intyre, stating that his brother was very ill: and
as he would not, in all probability, be able to start with the
expedition for some weeks, I was instructed to return with the
entire party to the Gilliot.</p>
<p>"The 3rd June was occupied in mustering the horses and
preparing for a start out, which we made the next morning.</p>
<p>"On the 5th June, when about 26 miles from the Gilliot, I was
met by a messenger bearing the sad tidings that our leader was no
more. I of course, immediately pushed forward, arrived at the
camp in the evening, and learnt that during the last two days of
his life he had been speechless and without the slightest power
of motion. Occasionally he suffered very severe pain, while at
other times he was in comparative ease. At six o'clock on the
morning of the 4th he gently breathed his last. He had expressed
a wish, some days previous to his death, that I should read the
funeral service over his remains; and I need hardly assure you
his desire was religiously respected. We buried him on the
morning of the 6th June.</p>
<p>"How severe was his disappointment at not being permitted to
finish the great task he had undertaken few can imagine. Rumours
which, although utterly groundless, had been widely spread, to
the effect that he had accepted the post of leader of this
expedition simply with a view to benefit himself and not to
achieve its grand object, had reached his ears and had grieved
him exceedingly. He had every confidence, however, that he would
thoroughly succeed in the performance of his duty, and thus
practically refute so base a scandal. On several occasions he
mentioned this subject to me, and once added, 'It's no use
<span class="pagenum">{Page 46}</span> <i>telling</i> them
they're wrong; I'll <i>show</i> them.' But this he has not been
allowed to do. In his last letter of instructions to myself,
which he had dictated to his brother, he said, 'all those who
have travelled with me will be able to give evidence if I adhered
to the terms of the agreement to really search for Leichhardt
while a horse or a camel remained of the expedition.' That he did
so, and would have continued to do so, none who knew him can
doubt.</p>

<h3><span class="a">9. Finding the Gun Nameplate</span></h3>
<p>About 1900, a burnt firearm with a nameplate marked
"<span class="a">ludwig leichhardt 1848</span>" was discovered by
an Aboriginal man, known as 'Jackie', who was working for an
outback drover and prospector named Charles Harding. The
Leichhardt nameplate, now believed to be genuine, is a piece of
