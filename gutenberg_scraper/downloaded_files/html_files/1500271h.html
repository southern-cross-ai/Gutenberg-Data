  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; BED ROCK AND UNDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE sheriff's right leg swung a leisurely arc over the
  wild-rose pattern stamped on the cantle of his saddle and dropped to the iron
  stirrup that dangled stiffly below the level of his horse's belly. The
  sheriff was a tall man, with wide shoulders and narrow hips, and blue eyes
  that sparkled rather startlingly in his leather-brown face. As his boot
  clicked into place, the horse moved forward, following the other riders and
  the herd, but the sheriff reined him back to the youth who stood leaning
  against the corral post, staring with expressionless face after the
  retreating group.</p>

  <p>"Got any plans, Cole?" Then he hesitated. Sympathy is often a more
  ticklish sentiment to handle than is blame, and the sheriff found himself
  groping for words. "You don't want to take it to heart, kid; about the
  propitty, I mean. I'm goin' to get all I can outa the stock, and what's left
  over and above the debts, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To hell with the stock!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, well, that's all right too. But it don't get yuh nowhere, kid. What
  I was goin' to say is, if you should want a job, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I want a job I'll get it away from here."</p>

  <p>The sheriff carefully selected a cigarette from the carton they were sold
  in; a "tailor-made," because rolling your own takes time when a man may not
  have it to spare from his business. While he drew his thumb nail across a
  match he eyed the young man covertly from under bushy eyebrows. The kid was
  taking it hard&mdash;which was to be expected&mdash;but it was a hardness
  that might lead him into trouble. The right word&mdash;but who can say just
  what is the right word to speak when youth stands in dazed, impotent fury
  while his world crashes around him?</p>

  <p>"Look here, Cole. Don't get the idea that bad luck is a disgrace you've
  got to run away from. Your dad's layin' under-ground because he made that
  blunder and there wasn't nobody there to stop him. What if the market did go
  down just when he figured it would go up, and he loaded up with stock there
  wasn't no sale for? Hell, any man's liable to guess wrong! What if the banks
  did close in on him? He ain't the first feller that's been crowded to the
  wall. Most of 'em, kid, are able to start right at bed rock and make a
  comeback they can brag about afterwards. I ain't sayin' a word against your
  dad. He was a fine man, and what he done was on the spur of the moment before
  he had time to think it over. But don't <i>you</i> go and let your
  pride&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pride!" Cole looked up at him then and grinned with his teeth clamped
  together and that same impotent fury in his eyes. "I've got a lot to be proud
  of, I must say! Don't you worry none about my <i>pride</i>, Mr. Carroll.
  That's been tramped into the ground for keeps! My pride&mdash;oh, damn the
  world and everything in it! All I ask of it is to leave me alone."</p>

  <p>"And that's meant for me, I reckon. Well, have it your own way&mdash;you
  will anyhow. As I was saying, I'll get all I can outa the stock, and turn
  over what's left to you. And if you want a job you better get it with some of
  the outfits where you're known. You'll get a better break here than you will
  among strangers, kid. You never had to work for wages, and it's liable to
  come hard till you get used to it. You've got quite a little string of horses
  of your own&mdash;want to sell any of 'em, Cole?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, they ain't a vast herd, but it's better than being down to your bed
  roll and that wore out. Better come along in with me till I see what I can
  save outa the wreck for yuh."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, no. I'm heading in the other direction."</p>

  <p>"Any idee where?"</p>

  <p>"To the devil, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Wel-l, they say he works his men pretty hard, and he's damn poor pay. But
  I wish yuh luck, kid, and I hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whatever he hoped, the sheriff thought better of mentioning it and tilted
  his spurs against the smooth coat of the sorrel as a signal to be moving. He
  flung up a hand in wordless adieu and rode off after his men without once
  looking back. For when all was said that could be said, Cole Lawson, Junior,
  would have to live his life in his own way and solve his problems for
  himself.</p>

  <p>With his teeth still clamped together so hard that afterward he found his
  jaws aching, Cole watched the receding dust cloud that hid the last of the
  Lawson herds. The cattle had gone on foreclosure of the bank when the ranch
  mortgage fell due, and that was the day before Cole Lawson, Senior, had taken
  the muzzle of his six-shooter between his teeth and pulled the trigger.
  Pride, the sheriff had called that impulse. Maybe it was; who knows?</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord Mother died before everything went to hell," Cole found
  himself saying aloud, and bit his underlip painfully when he realized where
  that thought would lead him. At any rate it was better than having to see her
  suffer for his father's last, mad impulse. An upward tilt of the old
  six-shooter, a crook of the trigger finger&mdash;so slight an effort as that,
  and the brain that had planned and schemed and loved and hated became
  scattered, spongy stuff.</p>

  <p>And one was life, and that other, ugly thing was death! And the wealth
  that had been his&mdash;what was that, save words written upon paper?
  Thousands of cattle branded with the C Bar L&mdash;that had been wealth for
  Cole Lawson and his son and sole heir. Well, the cattle had not died; they
  still fed contentedly on the range that had always been their home, but they
  were not Lawson cattle now. Certain words written on a sheet of foolscap had
  changed all that, just as certain words on another piece of paper had taken
  the Lawson lands and given them to a bank.</p>

  <p>"Bed rock and under!" Cole said to himself with a bitter twist of his
  lips. "They think I'm licked. They&mdash;hell, the whole darn bunch is
  <i>sorry</i> for me! Heir of the C Bar L&mdash;son of a suicide and heir to
  the disgrace of a quitter!"</p>

  <p>He pulled his hot, rebellious stare away from the dust cloud now shrinking
  to the level of the ridge over which the last of the Lawson stock had been
  driven, and turned a long, calculating look upon the rambling old house where
  he had been born. The place looked as strange and unfamiliar to him now as
  though he had never seen it before in his life. Empty; a mere thing of boards
  and glass, half hidden under vines that were trying to conceal the stark
  desolation of the place. And that was the result of words written on a sheet
  of paper, and of a lump of lead no bigger than the end of his finger. His
  eyes narrowed appraisingly as he stared and wondered why it was that he felt
  so much a stranger here now, when a few days ago the place had been so deeply
  embedded in his thoughts and his plans that he had never dreamed of living
  his life apart from the C Bar L. Why, even a week ago he had taken it for
  granted that they were rich, and that his father would grow old in the
  customary activities of a prosperous cattleman. Boxed and buried in
  commiserating silence&mdash;even now Cole could not quite sense the enormity
  of the catastrophe that had come to his father.</p>

  <p>A reckless impulse seized him to mount his horse and ride away with the
  clothes he stood in and what loose silver was in his pocket, but his
  practical common sense forbade that gesture of childish defiance of fate.
  Instead he walked deliberately to the empty house, entered rooms that had
  never before echoed so hollowly to his tread, and began to pack his most
  cherished&mdash;and portable&mdash;possessions. A stranger might have smiled
  at some of the things Cole considered of value: a quilt which his mother had
  pieced together from scraps of her own dresses and aprons, each one of which
  Cole remembered poignantly, though many of them had been worn years ago when
  he was a little boy who loved to sit in her lap and be rocked; a guitar,
  small and cheap but nevertheless prized because it was her gift, proudly
  presented to him on his twelfth birthday; a few books which she had also
  given him, and finally a buckskin bag of gold coins.</p>

  <p>This, too, was the gift of his mother. A bag with his initials worked in
  beads on one side. On his fifteenth birthday it had been laid beside his
  plate at breakfast, with a ten-dollar gold piece inside, stamped with the
  year of his birth. She had laughed and said that it was the beginning of a
  nest egg which she expected him to save. The idea had pleased Cole, and he
  had declared that he would save a piece of gold money for every year of his
  life, and have the dates to match. Well, he had stuck to that notion closer
  than he had to some others, and while his mother lived she had helped and
  encouraged him in making the collection complete. Now he weighed the bag in
  his hands and thought of the gold as money that could be spent if ever he
  were pushed to that desperate point. A tragic awakening for the son of Lawson
  the cattle king, who was reputed to be well on his way to a quarter of a
  million in horses, cattle and land!</p>

  <p>These things he packed in a weather-proof, sole-leather bag made to order
  after the pattern of a mail sack that could be strapped around the top and
  padlocked. He left the house then and carried the bag to the corral, where he
  saddled Johnnie, his own pet saddle horse. He considered that he was entitled
  to a roll of bedding, a small tepee tent and what food he would need for his
  journey into the unknown world where lay his future, and these things he
  assembled quickly, in haste to be gone from the place before sundown.</p>

  <p>Such was the precision of his movements that the sheriff and his men had
  not driven the last of the C Bar L horse herd five miles down the trail
  before Cole himself was mounted and taking the less used trail to the
  eastward, two lightly packed saddle horses and the three-year-old colt, Hawk,
  following trustfully behind Johnnie. Cole did not know where he was going nor
  what he would do when he got there. He did not care. All he wanted was to put
  the C Bar L and its tragic downfall behind him, to outride the sympathy of
  those who had witnessed the crash, and to find some isolated neighborhood
  where he could look into men's eyes and read there no compassionate knowledge
  of his hurt.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; TO OUTRIDE TROUBLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MANY a man has attempted to outride his troubles, and few
  have ever succeeded; but who has ever yet been able to outstrip his own
  thoughts and the ruthless memory that calls others trooping up to harry the
  fugitive?</p>

  <p>In those first few days of flight Cole Lawson would have been no more
  miserable had he stayed on the ranch or ridden in with the sheriff, as he had
  been invited to do. He was trying, for one thing, to outride the memory of
  that horrible minute when he had stood aghast beside the still quivering body
  of his father. Cole had loved his dad in an inarticulate, shy way that never
  found open expression. He had never suspected him of being in any deep
  trouble, and he could not account for the instant chill of apprehension which
  flashed over him when he had heard the shot in the room his father had used
  for an office. Gunshots were not so infrequent on the ranch, where target
  shooting was a popular sport and there were always hawks sailing up in the
  hope of pouncing upon a chicken and making off undetected. His father always
  had an eye out for these pests and never failed to send a shot after any hawk
  he discovered within range. Yet this particular report had sent Cole racing
  to the house with his heart pounding heavily in his throat, and so he would
  carry a gruesome picture indelibly painted in his mind; and ride as he would
  it flashed before him at unexpected moments when he thought he was thinking
  of something altogether different.</p>

  <p>He rode out of the Black Rim country by way of Thunder Pass which sloped
  steeply up between Gospel Peak and Sheepeater Mountain, and so came down the
  steep trail into Burroback Valley which seemed remote, sufficient unto
  itself, a world apart from the range land across the mountains. Cole had
  heard rumors of Burroback country. It was said to be tough. But then, Black
  Rim county was no saints' rest, so far as that went, and the toughness did
  not trouble him in the least, save that it put him a bit on guard.</p>

  <p>Burroback Valley was long and deep, with a creek running the entire length
  of it and many little gulches and canyons twisting back into the hills so
  that a map of it in detail would somewhat resemble the back and ribs of a
  great fish. The nearest railroad was miles away, and it seemed to Cole that
  he might safely ride up to some ranch and ask for work.</p>

  <p>The place he chanced upon first was the Muleshoe, a bachelor establishment
  which lay just down the valley from Thunder Pass and seemed to hug close to
  the ribbed side of Gospel Mountain. A secluded looking ranch which looked as
  though it held itself purposely aloof from the rest of the world; sinister
  too, if a man were old enough and experienced enough to read the signs. But
  Cole was neither, and the entire absence of normal activity around the
  squalid ranch buildings served only to impress him further with the idea that
  here would be a sanctuary from his tragic past. Folks wouldn't know anything
  about what happened outside the valley, and would care less.</p>

  <p>A hard-faced, shifty-eyed man with a high beak of a nose came forward to
  the gate, as Cole rode up, and leaned over it with his arms folded upon the
  top rail, one hand drooping significantly toward his left side where the
  brown butt of a .45 stood loosely in its holster. Afterward, Cole heard the
  owner of the Muleshoe called Bart Nelson, but now in the soft light of the
  afterglow he never dreamed that so unsavory a character as Bart Nelson
  confronted him. He had not lived his life among killers, and the sag of
  Bart's right hand went unnoticed, and he thought the man was squinting
  against the light of the western sky and so looked at him innocently through
  half-closed lids.</p>

  <p>Cole asked for work bluntly, without preface, because he did not know how
  to go about it and wanted the distasteful question out and done with.</p>

  <p>Bart Nelson studied him, studied the four horses&mdash;good-looking mounts
  they were too&mdash;and spat tobacco juice expertly at a white rock near
  by.</p>

  <p>"What you doin' over in Burroback?" he asked in a flat, grating voice.
  "You're Cole Lawson's kid, I bet. Heard he went broke and blowed his brains
  out. Tryin' to sneak some horses out away from the sheriff?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you go to hell! That's none of your damned business!" Cole retorted
  with quiet viciousness, and turned Johnnie away from that gate, the other
  horses swinging to follow him with the docility which tells of days on the
  trail together.</p>

  <p>Bart Nelson straightened his shoulders and fingered his .45. No man had
  ever slapped back at him in that fashion and turned his back and ridden off
  without answer of sharp words or shots. Other Muleshoe men mysteriously
  appeared and stared after the boy, who never once deigned to look back.</p>

  <p>"Now, what d'yuh think of that for gall?" Bart Nelson inquired of no one
  in particular. "Somethin' behind that play, I betcha." He watched Cole out of
  sight, his narrowed eyes vigilant.</p>

  <p>When nothing developed, the Muleshoe men shook their heads and decided
  that the kid had been sent to spy around, in hope of not being recognized,
  but had discovered that they were not such fools after all, and so gave up
  his plan, whatever it had been. Four C Bar L horses and a look like old Cole
  Lawson, and he thought he could pass unrecognized! The darned fool; did he
  think they were blind? They all agreed with Bart that there must be something
  behind it, and they were all especially wary for several days thereafter.</p>

  <p>As we all know, their uneasiness was without cause, for Cole had none of
  that boldness which his manner indicated. He rode away sick at heart over the
  unexpected jab at his wound just when he had believed he had out-ridden all
  knowledge of it. If his retort to Bart had been brutally direct, he had never
  been taught to set a guard over his tongue, but had been permitted to say
  what he thought when he thought it. The men of the C Bar L had always liked
  him and humored him from the time he could string words together into a
  sentence, and Cole did not dream that he had spoken to Bart Nelson in a
  manner that might well have started gun play. The chief thing was that he had
  been recognized.</p>

  <p>Of course it was the brand on his horses that had given him away at the
  ranch back there. There was nothing about himself or his outfit that would
  give any one a clue to his identity, and as for his name, he had meant to
  tell folks it was Colman, and let it go at that. No, it was the C Bar L, and
  he was a fool for not thinking of that brand as a dead give-away. The C Bar L
  must be known all over the country, and gossip rides fast, even in this big
  empty country. Well, he would have to do something about it, he supposed.</p>

  <p>As he rode on down the valley, Cole cast frequent dissatisfied glances
  back at his horses. The pick of the C Bar L horses they were, most of them
  given to him when they were yearlings, all of them pets which he had broken
  and taught. One was a two-year-old colt, round-hipped, straight-limbed,
  giving promise of speed and strength and wind, and a gentle thing with a
  disposition for nuzzling confidence. Cole thought fleetingly of selling them
  here in the valley; but that would be useless, and besides, horses weren't
  worth much nowadays. They were worth so little, in fact, that Cole had turned
  in a small bunch of horses which he might justly have claimed as his own, to
  help swell the number for the sale and make certain that the herd would bring
  enough to cover the debts which had driven his father to take the six-gun
  route out of the muddle. It was because these four were particular pets that
  he had kept them. He couldn't sell them now. There was another way.</p>

  <p>That night, in a secluded little meadow ringed round with thick bushes and
  quaking aspen thickets, Cole took that other way of removing the last clue to
  his past. He built a little fire, heated a cinch ring in the manner he had
  heard described by his father's punchers, when they spun tales of the range
  on winter evenings, and proceeded to wipe out the last clue to his past. One
  by one he roped and tied down his horses and with the white-hot ring held
  firmly in the fork of two green willow sticks he marked out the C Bar L with
  crisscross burns set deep with unconscious savageness. What he wanted was to
  make that brand forever undecipherable, and he succeeded so well that one
  would need to skin a horse and look on the wrong side of the hide to tell
  what the original brand had been.</p>

  <p>Several days elapsed before he could bring himself to the ordeal of riding
  out again to face the world he hated with all the fierceness of unhappy
  youth. The little glade seemed remote from the business of the valley and his
  horses fed contentedly there, switching at the flies which buzzed
  tormentingly around the fresh burns. Cole fished a little, but most of the
  time he spent lying on the ground under a tree with his hat pulled low over
  his eyes, thinking round and round in circles which always brought him to the
  central fact that he was alone in the world and that his life must start from
  that secluded little meadow.</p>

  <p>It would be life on the range, because he had never learned to do hard
  manual labor and he had refused to spend the years in school which were
  necessary if he would get an education; so he was not fitted for the
  competitive life of the towns, either as an office man or even as a common
  laborer. He had sense enough to know that, and he had pride enough to want to
  live where he could hold his own with the best of them. He could
  ride&mdash;the C Bar L maintained that Cole could ride anything that wore
  hair; he could bounce tin cans off the ground with bullets while he galloped
  past and shot as he rode, and he had an uncanny skill with a rope. Also, he
  had four good horses and a deep-rooted love of freedom and the outdoors.</p>

  <p>The range, then&mdash;or what little of it was left&mdash;was his natural
  field of achievement. As he lay there, he sometimes dreamed of owning a
  ranch&mdash;and you could bet he'd never go in debt for a dime's worth of
  anything! There was still government land to be taken up, and he was of age.
  He'd call himself Colman, which was his mother's maiden name, and forget the
  Lawson. He could file on a homestead and work part of the time, say during
  round-up, and gradually get together a little bunch of stock. By the time he
  was thirty or so, he ought to be fairly independent.</p>

  <p>It was the foundation upon which many a ragged lad has built castles in
  the air, and in the summer tranquillity of that small meadow Cole sometimes
  forgot his bitterness long enough to fence and cultivate an imaginary
  homestead, build cabin and corrals and a stable or two, and watch his small
  herd of cattle grow to sizable proportions.</p>

  <p>But the time came when the bacon and flour ran alarmingly low and Cole
  could not swallow another trout, especially when he had nothing to fry it in.
  The blotted brands had reached the stage of scabbing, and would not, he
  hoped, attract too much attention. So one morning Cole broke camp and moved
  reluctantly out to the road again, to face the world of which he secretly
  felt a bit afraid. As the three loose horses took last mouthfuls of grass and
  trotted after him, Cole twisted his body in the saddle and looked back. The
  little meadow was sunlit and peaceful. He knew the shape of every tree and
  bush that rimmed the grassland; the gurgling murmur of the brook had made
  words for him as he lay staring down at it where it curled and twisted among
  the stones. Even the clouds that floated lazily across the opening seemed
  friendly and familiar. There were the pressed places in the grass where the
  horses had lain down to sleep, the trampled nook where he had made his camp,
  the ashes of his small fires.</p>

  <p>He hated to leave that meadow which seemed saturated with his thoughts,
  made homey with his days and nights of eating and sleeping there. But the
  grass was cropped short and his food pack swung nearly empty&mdash;man and
  horses must eat.</p>

  <p>Cole heaved a long sigh and faced about to ride where the trail led him
  and to meet whatever lay upon it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; COLE FINDS A JOB</a></h2>

  <p class="first">COLE heard one of his horses snort and looked up from
  turning bacon in the frying pan to see two men seated upon quiet horses in
  the shadow of the broken ledge of lava beside which he had made camp for the
  night. Cole lifted the frying pan off the fire to a flat rock close by and
  stood up, his thumbs hooked inside his belt in the fashion he had learned
  from certain of the C Bar L riders whom he especially admired for a certain
  quality of potential deadliness which appealed to him. The men eyed him, eyed
  the horses with a curious interest, muttered to each other and then started
  toward him slowly, with an air of caution which might be flattering or
  menacing, as one chose to interpret their manner.</p>

  <p>"I guess there ain't anything much over this way you want," Cole said,
  when they had ridden ten feet nearer.</p>

  <p>The two stopped, and the older of the two ostentatiously clasped his hands
  over the saddle horn; though that would not have slowed his reach for the gun
  stuck inside his chap belt on the left of the lacing, should he feel the need
  of his gun. He had a long upper lip, and when he smiled his mouth drew down
  into a pucker which might give one the impression of a dry humor, half
  reluctant to betray itself just then.</p>

  <p>"Don't want to intrude on any one's privacy," he said gently. "We was just
  ridin' by and seen your smoke. No harm in swingin' this way on the chance of
  bein' invited to supper&mdash;in case it was some friend of ours camped
  here." He paused to clear his throat with a slight rasping sound, and then
  added apologetically, "Folks that are shy of meetin' anybody generally pick
  drier wood for their fire. Got any coffee to spare?"</p>

  <p>Cole was on the point of snapping out "No!" But these two looked friendly,
  and it had been overlong since he had held any friendly conversation with
  men; talking to your horses will do for a while, but the time comes when one
  wants to hear new thoughts put into speech. Cole relaxed, stooped and
  replaced the frying pan on the fire.</p>

  <p>"Guess I can split the grub three ways," he said gruffly, and lifted the
  coffeepot to see how heavy it was. "You live around here?" He looked up from
  adding more water and more coffee, and his cool glance went flicking over the
  two, by no means off his guard because of one humorously suppressed
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Wel-l, hereabouts," the tall man drawled, swinging down from his horse.
  "You're a stranger in these parts, I guess. Where from?"</p>

  <p>"Points west," Cole said briefly. "You'll have to eat with your fingers;
  I'm travelin' light."</p>

  <p>"Fingers was made before forks," the stranger tritely replied, and seated
  himself with his back to the ledge. His companion got down and eased into
  place beside him. "We're travelin' kinda light ourselves."</p>

  <p>Cole looked at the two, aware of a certain significance in the remark; but
  the other met his eyes with that same humorous smile drawn into a pucker of
  the lips. The younger man was staring furtively at Cole's horses, turning his
  eyes while his face did not move.</p>

  <p>"Out huntin' stock, and we didn't expect to get up this far," the man
  further explained. "These draws and canyons are sure a fright for huntin'
  strayed stock in."</p>

  <p>It was the old excuse, time-honored and always good because it could
  seldom be refuted. Stock did stray, and men did ride out to find them.
  Hunting stray horses was a plausible reason for appearing anywhere on the
  range at any time of the day or night. Cole knew that well enough and he
  wondered if it happened to be the truth this time; but there was nothing he
  could say to it, except to agree that the country sure was a fright. He had
  three cups&mdash;or more particularly he had two tin cups and a can&mdash;and
  he filled these with coffee, speared bacon from the frying pan and laid it
  across thick pieces of pan-baked bread, and told the two that supper was
  ready. They moved up and sat on their boot heels, eating and drinking with
  appetite.</p>

  <p>"You don't happen to need another man, do you?" Cole asked at last,
  speaking to the older man with a carefully indifferent manner and tone.</p>

  <p>"Well, I could use one&mdash;the right kind. Ever hear of John Roper?" He
  eyed Cole over his cup.</p>

  <p>"No. Don't know anybody around here. Just travelin' through; but I
  wouldn't mind working for a while&mdash;right kind of a job."</p>

  <p>The other chewed his bannock meditatively, watching the bay horse Johnnie,
  as he came nosing up for attention from his master. Cole had baked plenty of
  bannock because it was his habit to feed bits to his horses while he ate; now
  the horses all came poking along toward the camp fire, snatching at tufts of
  grass as they walked. Their freshly blotted brands would have caught the
  attention of the most ignorant tenderfoot. John Roper studied them, turned
  his eyes speculatively upon Cole.</p>

  <p>"Them your horses, the hull four?"</p>

  <p>"They're supposed to be," Cole snubbed his inquisitiveness.</p>

  <p>Both men grinned involuntarily and sobered again, save that the humorous
  pucker remained in John Roper's lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, I could use a man with a string of saddle horses like them. Seem to
  be gentle enough; fast too, by the looks of them legs. You can rope, I
  s'pose&mdash;how about shootin'? They's a pretty tough bunch rangin' in these
  canyons; we all go heeled and ready for a scrap. No use hirin' anybody that's
  gun-shy or that can't ride."</p>

  <p>"I'll chance coming out all right," Cole said grimly and looked over his
  shoulder at the horses. "I'll guarantee these four to go anywhere a goat can,
  and finish at the head of the parade. That," he added for good measure, "is
  why I've got 'em."</p>

  <p>Roper studied him again, peering squint-eyed through the firelight.
  Perhaps he saw the settled look of misery in the boy's face and mistook it
  for something less innocent; perhaps he read the moody set of the lips as
  something evil and hard. At any rate, he glanced sidelong at his companion,
  who gave a slight nod of approval, and cleared his throat with that dry,
  rasping sound which was not much more than a whisper of a cough and seemed to
  be a little mannerism of which he was unconscious; an habitual preliminary to
  speaking his decision.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll give yuh a job. For a while, anyway, till we finish up a kinda
  ticklish job we got on hand." He shot a keen glance at Cole who was staring
  moodily into the fire while he smoked. "Ticklish, because we're dealin' with
  a tough bunch and we want to handle it quiet as we kin. Got away with a bunch
  of horses I own, and I got reason to believe the brands has been worked and
  they're keepin' the horses right in this country. Me an' Pete has been
  scoutin' around to see what we could find out about it. What I want is to get
  'em back on the quiet, without them knowin' just where they went to.
  Sabe?"</p>

  <p>"I guess so. You're leaving the sheriff out of the deal?"</p>

  <p>"Got to, when the sheriff's in cahoots with the gang. No, I want my horses
  back. May have to steal 'em, but I'll get 'em, if they're still in the
  country. You game for a little hard ridin' and mebby a little gun play? I
  don't look for no great trouble; still&mdash;standin' in with the sheriff and
  all, they're purty damn' bold and they might have the gall to fight it out
  with us; if they git wise to what we're up to, that is. If we work it right,
  though, we can run off the hull herd right under their noses and not a grain
  of powder burned. What d'yuh say, Kid?"</p>

  <p>Cole got up and gave Johnnie the last piece of bannock before he shooed
  the horse back to tell the others there was nothing doing in the way of
  hand-outs to-night. He wanted a little time to think over this matter of the
  "ticklish" job, and he was too boyishly proud of his courage to let it be
  seen that he hesitated to accept. There was something about it which did not
  sound right&mdash;and it was not the element of risk, either. Perhaps it was
  the bald assertion that the sheriff of this county was conniving with the
  horse thieves; that did not jibe with all Cole knew of sheriffs, but then he
  had never known any save the big, bluff, kindly soul who had tried to comfort
  him when all the world was black. Of course, there were not many like big Ed
  Yates; dishonest sheriffs did exist, and he had always heard this section
  spoken of as a black spot on the range. He had ridden this way because it
  seemed the farthest removed in point of contact&mdash;farther than twice the
  number of miles in any other direction&mdash;and because the very toughness
  of Burroback men held them aloof from the rest of the world and so from
  gossip. His reasoning had been logical enough, but he had not taken into
  consideration the fact that the character of these people would be reflected
  in the work he hoped to find. Still, there was no use in being finicky, and
  getting stock away from horse thieves promised diversion, at least. And
  surely it was honest to get your own stock back.</p>

  <p>"I'll try it out," he said, turning back to the fire. "It ain't just what
  I had in mind, but it's all right till I can pick up a steady job of
  riding&mdash;if I decide to stay in this part of the country. But if I use my
  own horses, I'll want extra pay, and a six-gun job is worth a lot more than
  straight riding." He turned upon Roper a steady, impersonal stare which made
  him seem older and more experienced than he was. "So you may as well
  understand right now that if I take this job it'll be for the money there is
  in it, and that I don't give a darn for the risk."</p>

  <p>"Suits me," Roper told him dryly. "Money's what we're all after, I guess.
  Any p'ticular name you want us to call yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's Colman, and you can call me Cole if you want to. How much do I
  get extra for furnishing my own mounts? They're dandies, and I'll guarantee
  them to do all any four horses can do."</p>

  <p>"Anything but show a clean brand," the silent Pete spoke up, with an
  abrupt laugh that carried more meaning than Cole quite realized.</p>

  <p>"Say, that brand suits <i>me</i> all right."</p>

  <p>"You're the one to be suited," Roper pacified, giving Pete a warning
  glance. "Well, how'd a hundred dollars suit yuh, for this one job? May last a
  week, maybe longer; won't be more 'n a month at the outside. We've got to lay
  our lines careful and watch our chance; no use gettin' in too big a hurry and
  ballin' it up. Call it a month."</p>

  <p>Stifling any surprise he may have felt, Cole said he would take it. The
  two got up and went to their horses, hovered there talking together in low
  tones, then Roper turned back for a last word.</p>

  <p>"Better break camp and come along with us now," he said, glancing around
  him. "Might as well git yourself organized with us before anybody else runs
  across yuh. This is once when it don't pay to advertise. We're goin' on home
  and you might as well go along."</p>

  <p>A reasonable request, thought Cole, and began getting his meager outfit
  together. He had taken his time that day and the horses were not tired, nor
  were they especially hungry, since he had camped early and they had been
  feeding industriously ever since. No, there was no reason why he should not
  go with Roper; yet reluctance nagged at him, made him potter over the
  packing. It was as if he were trying to remember something important which
  had slipped treacherously from his mental grasp; as if there were some very
  good reason why he should not go with Roper and Pete, if only he could think
  what it was.</p>

  <p>At the last Pete came up to help him with the pack lashing, his attitude
  one of impatience. Roper himself seemed uneasy, in a hurry to start.</p>

  <p>"We got a long way to go, young feller," he explained his haste. "They's a
  late moon and we oughta catch it just right fer a bad stretch of trail. These
  horses of yours&mdash;they sure-footed, you say?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I said," Cole retorted, disliking the other's persistent way
  of returning always to the subject of the horses.</p>

  <p>"Well, they need to be; we got rough goin', gettin' in from this side the
  Sinks. Ever been through the Sinks?"</p>

  <p>"No. I told you I'm a stranger here."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, so you did. Well, it's goin' to be hard work drivin' your loose
  horses over the trail we'll take. I dunno&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't drive them anywhere. They'll follow where I ride." Cole mounted,
  and the horses came up and stood grouped around him, waiting for the
  signal.</p>

  <p>Roper eyed the bunch, grunted something under his breath and swung in
  beside Pete. They started down along the ledge to where a broken crevice gave
  precarious foothold to the top, turned into the fissure and went scrambling
  up. Loose stones rattled down among the bowlders so that Cole was kept busy
  dodging them, and Johnnie snorted and would have turned back had there been
  room enough. But somehow he gained the top and saw where Roper and Pete had
  swung off sharply to the right and were picking their way single file along
  the brow of the cliff, their vague forms sometimes lost to sight among the
  stunted junipers which grew courageously among the rocks, their roots thrust
  deep within the narrow cracks in the ledge.</p>

  <p>All day Cole had kept to the floor of the valley, these broken cliffs and
  ledges hemming him in and shutting him off from a view of the country beyond.
  Now the starlight dimly revealed to him a vast broken area that seemed a
  madman's conception of hell frozen over. Stark black peaks thrust up against
  the sky to the eastward, but before them lay a tortured land that told of the
  world's age-long travail of creation, when fire and flood, slow-creeping
  fields of glacial ice and sudden blasts of subterranean fires gouged and
  twisted and thrust forth strange conformations of rock and soil. He wondered
  if the trail led down into that nightmare country, and while he was
  speculating upon it his guides turned into a tilted crevasse and went
  slipping and sliding to the bottom.</p>

  <p>Cole spoke encouragingly to Johnnie, glanced back at the three loose
  horses, mentally measured the width of the pack on Mick's capable back, and
  followed down that fearful incline. With some secret relief he reached the
  bottom without mishap, listened a moment for the click of hoofs to the front
  and went on, for the most part letting Johnnie choose his own path. Once he
  heard the mumble of voices ahead; again, he caught sight of a man's head and
  shoulders silhouetted against the sky line as he rode up over a billowy ridge
  of sandstone. A moment later he heard Roper's voice calling back to ask if he
  were making it.</p>

  <p>"Fine and dandy," Cole replied, and heard Roper's slight laugh much closer
  than he had expected. Another minute and he saw that the trail doubled
  sharply back upon itself and that Roper had ridden almost abreast of him and
  a little above. Cole pulled up sharply and waited. He did not want any rocks
  rolling down and crippling Johnnie.</p>

  <p>"What yuh stoppin' for?" Roper taunted. "Thought you could ride where a
  goat can go!"</p>

  <p>"Quit kicking rocks down here, then. What you riding, anyway? A snowplow?
  That skate of yours must be digging his way through this hill!"</p>

  <p>Roper did not say anything to that. Evidently he had gone on, for the
  small avalanche of sand and small rocks ceased. Cole went on, made the turn
  and went up cautiously, one eye on the loose horses coming along the lower
  trail. A dangerous place, he decided, and halted the loose horses with a
  word, making them stand still and wait until he had completed the switchback.
  Then he waited until they made the turn safely, and went on angling down the
  ridge after Roper.</p>

  <p>After that Cole lost all sense of direction and all sound of his guides,
  trusting mainly to the keen instinct of his horse to keep him on the
  trail&mdash;if trail there was. The foot of the ridge stood in deep, muffling
  sand; other ridges closed in like the crooked fingers of some Gargantuan
  image of stone, and there was no sign of Roper or Pete to tell which way they
  had gone. He could have shouted for them, but he would not give them that
  satisfaction after Roper's taunt. If they wanted him to follow them, they
  could do the shouting themselves, he thought perversely, and waited in a
  triangular niche where Johnnie had stopped for the simple reason that he
  could go no farther forward and had received from his master no hint that he
  should turn back.</p>

  <p>Cole dismounted and felt along the sheer wall with his hands, making sure
  that there was no outlet save the way he had come. It was dark as a pocket in
  here among the ledges. Surely Roper must know that a stranger would be
  utterly confused in such a place. He would come back, of course, when he
  discovered that Cole was not following him. There was nothing to do but wait,
  and Cole felt his way past the three trustful animals that had crowded in
  after Johnnie, reached the sharp turn of the cliff and leaned against it,
  waiting for some signal from Roper.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE SINKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"HE never come this far, I tell yuh. He was over on the
  switchback when I dropped him, and he musta kep' on round the ridge."</p>

  <p>In the act of licking a cigarette into shape Cole stopped and listened,
  instinctively wary as a hunted animal. Coming stealthily out of the deep
  silence as they did, the words carried a certain sinister quality, though of
  themselves they seemed innocent enough; Roper and Pete, coming back to look
  for him, just as he had been expecting for the last ten minutes.</p>

  <p>"Hell of a note if we miss 'im," Pete's voice growled in a guarded
  undertone. "Yuh sure he climbed the switchback? You coulda popped 'im
  then."</p>

  <p>"On that cattle trail? Might as well'v done it back there at the camp
  fire. No, the deeper we git 'im in the Sinks, the better. Hell, I thought you
  was keepin' cases back there! Didn't I motion yuh to wait till he passed an'
  then foller 'im? Git 'im between us, that way. Now, you come moggin' along
  and yuh don't know where he is!"</p>

  <p>"You was closer to 'im than I was, John. You had every chance in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"That's all you know. Better go back and holler for 'im, I guess. This is
  no place to do it."</p>

  <p>Flattened against the rock, Cole held his breath while he listened. The
  two voices sounded close behind him, but that could not be, since he had been
  riding along a rock wall for some little distance until Johnnie, still
  keeping alongside the cliff, had turned into the niche and stopped. Yet he
  plainly heard the clink of an iron-bound stirrup striking against the rock,
  and the sigh of a horse as he moved away. Not a dozen feet away it seemed,
  and Cole slid his hand along the ledge, half expecting to find another corner
  around which the two might ride in a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Instead, his fingers dropped into a narrow crevice through which a cool
  breeze came drifting. Cole felt farther, found the solid rock again, and saw
  at once what had happened. Through some freak of chance&mdash;or perhaps it
  was destiny that guided Johnnie's steps that night&mdash;he had come down
  along one side of a narrow upthrust of rock while the two he had tried to
  follow rode down the other side. How they had happened to stop and talk
  beside that crack in the rock, only God could explain. But they did stand at
  that point to discuss with bloodcurdling matter-of-factness the details of
  their plan, and Cole was there to hear. Things happen that way sometimes,
  when there is no other human means of protecting a man.</p>

  <p>Cole at that moment did not feel the protection. All his mind could grasp
  was the fact that Roper and Pete had tricked him into coming down into the
  Sinks with them so they could kill him without fear of interruption or
  discovery. Moreover, it was much easier to get him down in here with the
  promise of a job than it would have been to carry his dead body away without
  leaving a clue. He had camped too close to the road, and he had been too much
  on his guard. He remembered now that he had kept the fire between himself and
  them. They would have been obliged to shoot him, and they evidently feared
  that some one might be riding that way who would investigate. Down
  here&mdash;if they got him far enough into this ungodly country&mdash;no one
  would hear a shot; or perhaps they hoped to kill him quietly; Pete had
  mentioned a rock, Cole remembered.</p>

  <p>It was the horses they were after, of course. They had been very much
  interested in the horses. Probably his clothes and his camp outfit appealed
  to them also, and the hope of finding money. Cole trembled a little with the
  excitement of it, but he did not feel afraid now that he knew just what to
  expect from them. He would be prepared, and he would shoot first.</p>

  <p>But there his nerves rebelled. Too lately had he seen just how a dead man
  looked. No, he could not bring himself to face the thought of killing,
  however much they deserved it; yet it might come to that, if he wanted to go
  on living.</p>

  <p>"And they had the gall to talk about a tough gang in this valley!" Cole's
  anger grew apace as he recalled the specious talk of Roper at the camp fire.
  He had heard the C Bar L riders tell of such human wolves as these, but he
  had never quite believed that men would kill for the sake of a horse or two,
  or perhaps a few dollars in money they could carry away and spend. That had
  always sounded unreal and overdrawn, as if the boys were just yarning for the
  effect upon him. Now he was prepared to believe anything he heard about
  cold-blooded killers.</p>

  <p>Standing there beside the crack in the rock wall, Cole considered what he
  must do to outwit them. In the darkness he could not do much of anything; but
  then, in the darkness they would not be likely to discover him, either. The
  trail, he decided, must run along the other side of this outcropping; how far
  he could not even guess. By daybreak they would probably be able to track him
  in this loose sand, so whatever he did must be done as soon as possible. And
  that, he was forced to admit, was nothing at all, save watching and listening
  for their approach. At least the horses were safe for the present, penned in
  that niche as they were, and the thought brought Cole some comfort.</p>

  <p>How long he stood there Cole could not tell, for he dared not strike a
  match to look at his watch. He dared not smoke or move about, since sounds
  carried plainly through that crack and the two might come on up the trail at
  any moment. Fervently he hoped that the moon would forget to rise that night;
  and after a long while, when the east began to lighten a bit, he saw that the
  sky was becoming overcast with clouds that scudded obliquely across the
  whitened patch just over a peak. Wind came, but no moon; a slow, sweeping
  wind that blew strongly and steadily without any violent gusts; such a wind
  as would have delighted a sailor aboard an old windjammer on the homeward
  voyage. It delighted Cole no less, for he felt the sand creeping past his
  legs and knew that it was drifting and would blur his tracks even if it did
  not obliterate them entirely; so that would give him a fighting chance of
  escape.</p>

  <p>Twice he thought he heard a faint halloo back in the direction from which
  he had come, but with the wind whistling among the interstices in the ledge
  he could not be sure. When his legs wearied of standing, he withdrew around
  the corner of the niche and sat down with his back against the rock. Hawk,
  the two-year-old, came up and nosed him wistfully, and Cole drew the sleek
  head down where he could rub the satiny nose and smooth the long forelock,
  running his fingers absently through the hair to smooth out each tangle. But
  though the colt's companionship was gratefully received, he did not forget to
  listen with strained attention for the approach of Roper and Pete.</p>

  <p>Dawn came gray and cloudy, with a high wind which whipped up the sand into
  stinging swirls that piled small drifts here and there against the rocks. In
  the open it gouged deep furrows in fantastic patterns and the whooping of the
  gale made an eerie song among the thin sharp ridges that went twisting this
  way and that in labyrinthine windings through this particular portion of that
  strange, forbidding waste land locally called the Sinks.</p>

  <p>When daylight was full upon him, Cole saw that the niche into which
  Johnnie had led him might more properly be called a triangular cleft in the
  rocks. The horses stood huddled at the far end of it, where the narrowing
  walls sheltered them from the wind; a circumstance which pleased him so much
  that he got his rope off the saddle and stretched it across the twenty-foot
  space, penning them there well out of sight except from the opening itself.
  Had he been searching for a hiding place this spot would have appealed to him
  as almost ideal, he thought, as he surveyed the horses contentedly standing
  in their little corral, Mick with his chin resting on Johnnie's neck, Hawk
  crowded in between Eagle and Johnnie, his big dark eyes fixed inquiringly
  upon Cole. Get those horses? Roper and Pete would have to take them over his
  dead body, Cole thought rather melodramatically, and took out his six-shooter
  to examine it and make sure that it was in perfect working condition.</p>

  <p>With the horses safe for the present, Cole turned his attention to the
  wall itself. It struck him that Roper and Pete would be looking for the
  horses and would never think of watching the top of the ledges, so he pulled
  off his boots and began climbing the wall on the side next the crack which
  had proven so useful last night. The rough, splintered face of the rock gave
  many handholds and as he neared the top the other side of the cleft tilted
  inward and offered its solid surface as a brace, so that presently he found
  it very much like climbing up inside an ill-shaped chimney. If it came to a
  fight, this would be a splendid point from which to defend himself and his
  horses, he thought, as he stopped to breathe and look down at them. There was
  one danger to be guarded against, he remembered. If he got out of sight they
  would probably whinny after him; certainly Johnnie would lift up his anxious
  voice, and probably set them all neighing. Eagle in particular had a
  terrifically high, shrill call. He must bear that in mind and not go too far,
  lest their very love for him should betray them all.</p>

  <p>As it happened, Cole discovered that the ledge narrowed like the peak of a
  wind-chopped wave and that he could stand waist-deep on a broken splinter of
  rock within the cleft and look down to the blowing sand on either side.</p>

  <p>Eyes watering in the wind, he gazed out over an intricate jumble of narrow
  winding lanes hemmed in with barren broken hills which seemed to extend in an
  uneven line to the black peaks in the distance. There must be open stretches,
  wide spaces here and there, but Cole could see nothing of the sort close by;
  nothing save the thin ledges thrusting up from the sand, with here and there
  piles of loose bowlders where some portion of wall had fallen in a
  heap&mdash;shaken down in an earthquake, perhaps.</p>

  <p>To find him in that maze would be almost impossible, he decided. Roper and
  Pete would have no clue to his whereabouts, now that the wind had come and
  swept out his tracks. They must hunt for him at random, and from where he
  stood he would see them coming long before they could possibly discover
  him.</p>

  <p>So far was luck on his side. But if they could not discover his hiding
  place, neither did he know the way back out of the Sinks. Without water, he
  could stay hidden only so long before his sanctuary became a trap. He had
  food, but there was nothing for the horses to eat and he would be obliged to
  chew his bacon raw or do without; a thirst-provoking repast which did not
  tempt him at all.</p>

  <p>He shifted his position to where he could sit on a narrow shelf which
  projected on the lip of the crack, his legs dangling into the cleft and his
  back against a slanting slab of stone. There he perched bareheaded in the
  wind and smoked while he watched the desolate terrain spread raggedly before
  him. Black rock and yellow, drifting sand with here and there a deformed
  juniper bush&mdash;not an enlivening scene under happier conditions than
  these; certainly holding no cheer for him now.</p>

  <p>Toward noon ragged rifts tore through the mottled gray blanket of clouds
  and let a dazzling shaft of sunlight through. The gale still whistled around
  the rocks it could not shake; the sand still drifted before it and built
  little furrows and ridges that perhaps would be scooped up bodily and tossed
  into the air in a cloud with the next erratic gust.</p>

  <p>Up on the perch he had chosen above the cleft Cole nodded in spite of
  himself. Nothing had moved within his range of visions save a flock of
  buffeted cedar birds that flew over his head, making for the farther hills.
  Insensibly his vigilance relaxed and he dozed fitfully, his shoulders sagged
  into a depression of the rock at his back. The whoo-oo of the wind merged
  into a droning chant, faded to silence as his mind dropped deeper into the
  velvet darkness of sleep; swelled up again to sound that took the form of
  words, at first mumbled and meaningless, then clearer and carrying a meaning
  that tugged at Cole's consciousness until he opened his eyes and blinked
  guiltily as if he would deny even to himself that he had been asleep.</p>

  <p>Roper and Pete were riding down along the wall toward him, side by side
  with stirrups almost touching, as they swung to the plodding of the tired
  horses through the sand. Pete was talking, and it was his growling voice that
  had seemed a part of the wind's monotonous drone.</p>

  <p>"You'd oughta got 'im on the switchback. That was a cinch an' you let it
  slip by," he was saying crabbedly but without any greater animus than the
  impulse to pass the blame along to the other fellow. "Now we got t' hunt 'im
  outa here like a rabbit in a rock pile. This damn' wind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jim's picked him up with the glasses, maybe. Once we git 'im located, the
  rest 'll be easy. Quit yer bellyachin', or I'll send yuh on home."</p>

  <p>A mirthless grin twisted Cole's lips as he listened. Had these two been
  quarreling over his disappearance ever since last night? They weren't getting
  anywhere with the argument, that was certain. Pete must be a privileged
  character, he thought. As the two rode nearer, and passed so close he could
  have flipped a pebble on to their hat brims, Cole thought what an easy shot
  it would be to drop them both off their horses. An Indian or some harder
  natured man might have done just that; certainly they would have considered
  this a heaven-sent opportunity to shoot him down, had their positions been
  reversed, and Cole scowled at his own softness because he could not kill them
  for the human wolves their own mouths proclaimed them to be.</p>

  <p>Instead he stiffened to the immobility of the rock behind him, just as old
  Billy Parrish, his father's foreman, had long ago taught him to do on the
  hunting trails when game stepped out in plain sight. Not even the horses,
  walking with drooped heads swinging to each stride they took, flipped an ear
  his way to show that they suspected his presence. Cole was thankful now that
  he had taught his own horses to be quiet on hunting trips. They probably
  believed he was watching for deer; at least, they made no sound, even though
  they must have heard the voices of the men.</p>

  <p>For the matter of that, he wondered at their apparent carelessness in
  talking when they did not know how close he might be to them. But when they
  had passed and he ventured to examine that rock lane more closely, he saw
  that no hiding place presented itself, as far as he could look in either
  direction. His guess that they would never dream he would climb to the top of
  the rock was evidently correct. They were searching for some sign of him with
  the horses, and they knew they were alone in that particular passageway.</p>

  <p>The thought of Jim perched on some height with field glasses watching for
  him was to say the least disquieting. It must mean that in the night either
  Pete or Roper himself had ridden to headquarters, wherever that was, and had
  brought out the rest of the gang. How many that would be, Cole of course
  could not know, but from all he had heard of outlaw gangs, he believed there
  would be several riders poking through this area of primal eruptions. Or was
  it a great rock field shattered long ago and worn down with water in past
  ages? He was not geologist enough to know, and mentally he dubbed this
  "badlands" and let it go that way. Surely it was bad enough from any point of
  view; bad enough to make him almost despair of ever escaping from the
  trap.</p>

  <p>The only thing he could do was stay where he was on the lip of the niche's
  end and watch, motionless, for some further sign of his hunters. It was what
  a wild animal would do in covert as safe as his, and for the time being he
  was little better off than a hunted animal; their cunning must be his
  cunning, their caution his best defense.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; COLE SHOOTS AS HE RIDES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH the fading light of a cloudy sunset, Cole scrambled
  down into the cleft among his patient horses that greeted his arrival with
  little nickers of anticipation, expecting to be fed and watered after all
  these empty hours of inaction. Their eager faith in him hurt Cole beyond
  words, and added much to his bitterness against Roper and his gang. How long
  the search for him would continue he had no means of knowing, but it would
  perhaps be longer than he could endure the thought of hiding here and
  watching his horses suffer.</p>

  <p>For the first time since he left home, Cole wished that he had some of the
  boys here to advise him. Billy Parrish had fought Indians; he would know what
  was the best thing to do in such an emergency as this. Gene and Art and
  Red&mdash;if they were here, they could ride out boldly and give the Roper
  bunch something to think about!</p>

  <p>Johnnie reached out his nose and bunted Cole gently in the ribs, dumbly
  urging him to remember that this was supper time. Hawk pushed up and nosed
  him reproachfully; Mick and Eagle begged him for attention. With the imminent
  expectation of having to make a hurried flight from that retreat, he had left
  saddle and pack in place, and now his conscience smote him for putting that
  discomfort as a climax to the hunger and thirst of his mounts.</p>

  <p>Sliding his palm along Eagle's smooth barrel to the rump as he walked, he
  ducked under the rope barrier and went to the corner of the rock wall,
  listened for a minute and peered out into the twisting alleyway. Nothing
  moved save the sand blown before the whooping wind; nothing save the
  whistling of the gale did he hear. From the swiftness with which dusk was
  falling in that dismal place it would soon be dark. The unknown Jim would
  have to postpone his spying for a time, and Roper's riders would be searching
  at random.</p>

  <p>Billy Parrish had always taken advantage of night to steal out of whatever
  tight place he found himself in by day and make his escape, even when Indians
  lay watching for such a move. Cole hesitated, glancing back to where four
  sleek necks were stretched over the rope as four pairs of brown eyes watched
  him with hungry interest. He bit his lip as their silent pleading struck
  home, and went back to rub each satiny nose in helpless misery.</p>

  <p>"All I'm afraid of is that you might get shot if any of them sees us," he
  whispered. "Far as I'm concerned, I don't care a damn; but I've got you to
  think about&mdash;and I'd rather see yuh dead than mauled around by them
  coyotes. I dunno; it's takin' a long chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell!" he revolted suddenly against all caution. "I can't set here
  and watch yuh starve to death, either. I guess I can hold my own against 'em,
  if it comes to a showdown, so we'll go, hosses. You know where there's a
  creek full of water and grass growin' along the bank, and it's up to you boys
  to find the way back."</p>

  <p>He felt better after that decision and moved briskly to Mick's side,
  digging into the pack for the extra cartridges he had tucked into the top of
  a kyack. Then with his rope once more coiled and tied to the saddle, he
  mounted and rode quietly out of the niche and down along the ledge.</p>

  <p>Once headed back along the way they had come, he looped the reins over the
  saddle horn and let Johnnie take his own course. For himself, he rode with
  his hunting carbine in his hands and his eyes turning this way and that,
  straining through the growing darkness to watch for any movement, any glimpse
  of men on guard.</p>

  <p>Left to himself, Johnnie stepped out briskly in the running walk that made
  these four horses famous for covering the trails with little effort; an easy
  pace that carried them down through the winding aisles and up to the ridge
  where they had lost Roper, before Cole had expected to cover half the
  distance. At least, the danger of suddenly meeting one of the enemy around
  some sharp turn was past, and Cole breathed freer as they swung into the
  faintly defined trail up the side of the ridge that led to the
  well-remembered switchback farther along. Certainly Johnnie knew where he was
  headed for, and meant to lose no time in reaching the spot.</p>

  <p>Somewhat to Cole's surprise the switchback trail was left unguarded.
  Johnnie went down it almost at a trot, the loose horses crowding close to his
  heels and kicking rocks upon the lower trail in their reckless haste. Cole
  watched anxiously the trail behind him, though it was now too dark to see
  much beyond the tail of the hindmost horse, fully expecting some pursuit. But
  nothing appeared to be abroad in the Sinks that evening, and the boy's
  spirits rose to a jubilant mood that he had so neatly tricked that
  traitorously smiling man who had offered him a job, merely for the sake of
  coaxing him down in here where murder would be perfectly safe and easy of
  accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Now they were passing over the great billowy ridges which Cole vividly
  recalled. He felt safe now, for he was sure he could have made his way back
  without trusting to the sure instinct of his horse. He wondered if Johnnie
  was as thirsty as he was; he certainly was not letting any grass grow under
  his feet, for now that the trail was fairly easy, he broke into a lope that
  gradually increased in speed until he flew over those ridges almost at a run.
  Cole laughed aloud as he listened to the clatter of those galloping hoofs
  over the gravelly sandstone and wondered if Roper's men would realize who was
  riding that trail in such a hurry.</p>

  <p>Now they were at the steep incline of the long crevasse which led up out
  of the Sinks to the higher ridge that bordered the valley. Johnnie slowed to
  a walk and went scrambling up over the rocks like a mountain sheep, taking
  his time because he must, yet wasting no seconds either. If a bowlder lay in
  his path he would pause just long enough to lower his head and give the
  obstacle an inquiring sniff, and then up he would go, the three others
  following slavishly where he led.</p>

  <p>Cole had put away his rifle in its scabbard beneath his leg, and now he
  rode with his hand on the butt of his six-shooter. He did not expect to need
  it now; he had left all danger behind him in the Sinks, he was telling
  himself, when without any warning he rode out of the cleft and came face to
  face with three riders who bulked vaguely before him in the trail very much
  as if they had heard him coming and were waiting for him there.</p>

  <p>Instinctively Cole's heels swung inward and Johnnie leaped forward,
  straight at the nearest horseman whose horse backed and sidled from the
  threatened collision.</p>

  <p>"Hey, wait a minute!" another called sharply. "What's your hurry?"</p>

  <p>"None of your business. Get outa the way!" Cole yelled, and fired a shot
  more or less at random, as he charged them.</p>

  <p>"Git 'im, boys!" some one shouted, as Cole and his horses went thundering
  up the ridge.</p>

  <p>They whirled and came after him, shooting as they rode. Cole sat twisted
  in his saddle, firing back at them, obliged to aim high because of his horses
  coming behind. Then Eagle gave a lunge and went clattering past Johnnie, the
  pack horse racing after him. Cole had the sense to pull out of the trail and
  let the frightened animals in ahead of him, shooting now with deadly intent
  at the dim figures that seemed to hesitate at coming in too close.</p>

  <p>After all, it was a running fight that was quickly over; a rapid
  succession of shots, and then Cole was around a sharp curve in the trail, out
  of sight of the three. He waited a minute, but they must have expected him to
  do that, for they did not come on and Cole began to suspect that they meant
  to come at him from some other direction which he did not know, being a
  stranger to that particular ridge. He gave Johnnie his head and went
  galloping away after his horses that were making for the creek and their last
  camp ground under the lee of the ledge.</p>

  <p>Cole would like to have stopped there but it seemed too risky, so he took
  the lead again when the horses stopped to slake their thirst at the creek,
  and went on down the winding road which led away from the Sinks. It did not
  seem likely that Roper's gang would follow him along the highway, deserted
  though it was. Still, he did not feel in the mood for further
  fighting&mdash;chiefly because of a bullet wound in his wrist which pained
  considerably and helped to impress upon him the risk he had run of being
  killed. No, decidedly he wanted no more encounters with Roper's men.</p>

  <p>As best he could while he rode along, he bound up his wound with his
  handkerchief, thankful that the bullet had missed a bone; but it had passed
  clean through the flesh and there was a good deal of blood, and altogether
  Cole was in no happy frame of mind as he loped along through the windy dark
  on a trail he did not know; and when, far in the distance behind him he heard
  Eagle's high, shrill call and suddenly discovered that only two horses were
  following him, Cole Lawson, Junior, was closer to panic than he had ever been
  in his life.</p>

  <p>Hawk answered with an anxious whinny as Cole pulled up and peered into the
  dark behind him. Roper's gang, he thought, must have ridden after him and
  managed to rope Eagle&mdash;and yet they could scarcely have done that
  without his hearing them, even if they would attempt such a thing without
  taking a shot at him. But something must be holding Eagle back against his
  will, for the horses always kept close together; whatever it was Cole could
  not go on until he had investigated, had got his little band together
  again.</p>

  <p>To ride back up the trail in the dark would have taxed the courage of a
  more seasoned soul than Cole Lawson, faint with hunger and the pain of his
  wound, his nerves suffering from the strain of those long hours in the Sinks.
  But he went, guiding Johnnie with his knees, the reins wrapped around the
  saddle horn and his gun held ready in his uninjured hand. The revulsion of
  finding Eagle alone in the trail turned him so dizzy that when he dismounted
  and walked up to the horse he staggered and almost fell. The other horses
  were nosing around inquisitively, giving no hint of any strange presence in
  that vicinity. Reassured, Cole pulled himself together and gave Eagle a
  reproachful slap on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>The horse flinched violently from the touch. With a heavy sense of
  premonition, Cole felt more gently the place and found it sticky and wet. He
  risked lighting a match to see what was wrong, and before a gust of wind blew
  it out he saw the ragged wound and groaned an oath of commiseration. Shot in
  the shoulder, the horse had gamely traveled these miles and kept pace with
  the others until the stiffening muscles and loss of blood had forced him to
  give up.</p>

  <p>Cole sent a despairing glance around him in the starlight. He could not go
  on and leave the horse there, nor could he make camp so close to the road;
  for sooner or later he must sleep, and there was no telling when some of
  Roper's gang might ride that way. He led the horse slowly away toward a small
  butte dimly seen against the stars. Off there should be the creek he had
  crossed some miles back, and it was vital that he should find it. Where water
  flowed there should be grass, and Eagle would need food within easy reach.
  With himself and one horse crippled, he must do some careful planning, but
  Cole's brain did not seem to function easily in the face of this fresh
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>He felt that he should leave the horses there and scout ahead a little,
  but he was afraid that Hawk and Mick would follow him&mdash;indeed, they were
  certain to do that&mdash;and that would set Eagle to whinnying again; Cole
  had a nervous dread of that. So he went forward slowly, stopping every few
  yards to rest and encourage the horse. He must trust to luck for a feasible
  place to camp.</p>

  <p>They were descending a slope, and he hoped that he was keeping out of
  sight of the road. A ridge seemed to rise this side of the butte, and as he
  approached nearer he could discern the faint outline of huge bowlders the
  size of a house, scattered here and there. These promised concealment, at
  least, though it was slow, painful work getting Eagle that far.</p>

  <p>Finally he stopped, simply because he hadn't the heart to force the horse
  to further effort, and managed to get the saddle off Johnnie and the pack off
  Mick. Working awkwardly with one hand, he unrolled his bed and lay down, too
  worn out and wholly miserable to care whether he ever got up again or not,
  yet anxious for daylight so he could find water and dress Eagle's wound and
  his own; though his own injury seemed less important in spite of the pain,
  which would have occupied the attention of any man.</p>

  <p>But as he lay there, his gloomy thoughts insensibly merged into the
  inconsequent fabric of dreams that mingled with the whoo-oo of the wind. Sunk
  deep in the reaction from the strain of the past thirty-six hours, he slept
  heavily and long, while the disabled Eagle stood drooping near by and the
  other horses foraged hungrily for grass amongst the sage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; ENTER MUTT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TWENTY-ONE more or less care-free years leave a good deal of
  boy in a man, and the boyish quality of youth is resilient beyond belief.
  After more than two weeks of moody isolation and a bitterness greater even
  than that despair which had driven his father to suicide, Cole was due for a
  reaction of some sort.</p>

  <p>A weaker nature might have slipped over the edge of normalcy and gone bad,
  turning another twisted mentality loose upon the world to wreak what havoc it
  would until the law stepped in with the strong hand of restraint; or, on the
  other hand, he might have given up the fight as his father had done.</p>

  <p>But there was in Cole Lawson a good deal of his mother, and she was brave
  enough to laugh down the heartaches that came her way and to find a whimsical
  angle to any problem life gave her to solve. Cole Lawson, Senior, would hide
  his troubles from the world, but he would not laugh at them; instead he
  brooded in secret&mdash;and ended with a bullet crashing through his tired
  brain. Cole's mother had gone out smiling, racked with pain and game to the
  last breath. Something of each had gone to the making of Cole's nature, and
  it was his father's side that had sent him away, hating the world that had
  dealt him hard blows without explaining why. Perhaps he would have gone on
  hating the world and his fellow men, and turned out altogether spoiled and
  useless to life and himself, if the Mutt had not chosen to make friends that
  morning.</p>

  <p>The Mutt was lonesome too, and life had dealt him some bitter blows which
  he did not in the least deserve and which he never would understand, being a
  dog with a vague past and no talent for introspection. Tragedy had stalked
  the Mutt's trail and kept him busy dodging, but it had not quenched the
  indomitable optimism within him which rose valiantly with a quizzical lift of
  one eyebrow and a hopeful tilt of the head in the very face of disaster.</p>

  <p>That optimism held him all aquiver this morning, and the reason for it was
  a boy with a bandaged wrist lying asleep in the dooryard that had been a
  dismal, empty place for so long that all the man tracks were faint and had no
  smell; and all the tin cans were red with rust and had only shreds of faded
  labels to say what had once been their contents; and a pair of old, cast-off
  shoes lying beside the wind-swept woodpile were curled like dried potato
  parings, with all the nails pulled loose from the soles and showing like
  small teeth. It spoke well for the fidelity of the Mutt that he still slept
  under the corner of the cabin next the doorstep where his vanished master had
  thrown down two old sacks for a bed when the Mutt was a yapping puppy.</p>

  <p>How long the little rusty red waif had carried on alone he could not
  remember; long enough to have almost forgotten the taste and smell of bacon
  and to learn a good many of the coyote's tricks in hunting; long enough to
  become very self-assured and capable, but not long enough to lose the
  lonesome look in his eyes or the hunger for human companionship.</p>

  <p>The Mutt had been off hunting rabbits and he had not come home until dawn.
  His first yelp of surprise at finding visitors there having produced no
  definite effect, he had circled and barked for a while, sniffing
  investigatively between spasms. But the horses continued their feeding and
  gave him scant attention; and the young man lying covered with a blanket to
  his boots, which thrust boldly out into the soft glow of sunrise, might have
  been dead for all the movement he made. The Mutt's barking diminished and
  finally ceased. Full fed, occasionally licking the chops that were whiskered
  like a little old Irishman, he sat down to consider these unexpected
  arrivals. Especially did the long figure covered with the gray blanket
  interest him. Curiosity pulled him nearer; he sniffed the tanned young face
  with its scowl of pain and loneliness and bewildered sorrow, he sniffed the
  blood-stiffened bandage on the wrist.</p>

  <p>Cole's well arm thrashed out, fell upon the blanket, lay there slack. The
  Mutt stood looking it over, smelt the friendly man smell which he had missed
  out of his life, edged forward, and began licking the fingers with growing
  affection and enthusiasm. The hand drew away, lifted to the boy's face, fell
  across the closed lids, lifted again and dropped to the blankets, tensing to
  support the weight of arm and shoulder as Cole raised himself up and stared
  blinking all around him. His eyes turned toward the dog, sitting very
  straight upon a stub of tail that vainly tried to wag. He stared
  uncomprehendingly into wistful brown eyes that held the light of expectancy
  emphasized by the sidewise tilt of the dog's head, the quizzical arch of one
  eyebrow with a black spot the size of a dime.</p>

  <p>"Hello, you Mutt!" said Cole, and grinned for the first time in two
  weeks.</p>

  <p>"Woo-oh!" answered Mutt, and rose straight up on his stubby tail, his
  capable paws folded across his brindle belly like a ground squirrel.</p>

  <p>The two sat looking at each other measuringly. Cole snapped thumb and
  finger, and the dog exploded into wriggling, fawning ecstasy. Forequarters
  laid to the ground, he yelped and sprang. He was in Cole's arms, licking,
  whimpering inarticulate endearments, smelling rapturously.</p>

  <p>"You Mutt, you!" Cole struggled up, holding his face away from that
  whipping, eager pink tongue. "Quit slobbering, darn yuh! Say, where'd you
  come from, I'd like to know?"</p>

  <p>This was the first time the rusty red, small dog of no particular breed
  had ever been addressed as Mutt, but he seemed to like the name better than
  he had liked anything in a long while, even jack rabbit carried straight home
  and eaten warm under the cabin, or devoured on the spot where he made the
  kill, if he were hungry as he had been to-night; he had taken his rabbits as
  he found them, thankfully but without fuss; certainly not with the joyful
  contortions, the yelps, the frenzied lickings with which he attested his joy
  over this new adventure.</p>

  <p>Cole got up and stood looking about him. What he had thought were huge
  square bowlders, such as abounded in that valley, were in reality a cabin and
  a ramshackle shed with a rusty barbed-wire fence straggling around it. Half
  the posts were down or leaning crazily to the pull of the sagged wires and
  the shed roof seemed about to fall in at one corner. A deserted place, by
  every sordid sign save the dog.</p>

  <p>Watchful, Cole walked over to the cabin and looked in through the open
  doorway. Many whooping gales such as this last one had been must have swung
  the door off its hinges, for it lay tilted against the table. In the corner
  at the back a pole bunk held a rat's nest, little sticks piled up in a
  rounded heap. Two rats scurried out, jumped to the dirt floor and dodged out
  past Cole as he leaned, looking in.</p>

  <p>"Sic' 'em, Mutt! Go git 'em&mdash;atta boy!"</p>

  <p>With all the zest of youth, Cole watched the brief, zigzag race, slapped
  his thigh in approval when the Mutt darted in ahead and caught the hindmost
  rat, shaking it viciously before he let it drop limp.</p>

  <p>"Atta boy&mdash;nabbed 'im, didn't yuh? Some dog, ain't yuh?"</p>

  <p>But catching rats could not divert him long from the business in hand,
  which was to find water and give Eagle's wound such dressing as was possible.
  He thought there must be a spring somewhere near, or the creek within easy
  distance, and presently he discovered an old trail worn into the gravel with
  weeds growing up in it wherever the soil offered any sustenance for
  vegetation. As he started along it, the Mutt slipped past him and trotted
  sophisticatedly ahead, lifting his knees high like a spirited horse.</p>

  <p>Cole laughed at the impudence of the gait, and that in itself was
  sufficient justification for the Mutt's existence. Cole had needed something
  to make him laugh as a boy would laugh.</p>

  <p>Mutt and the dim old pathway led him to a choked spring where the water
  lay yellow in a grassy bowl, slim-bodied insects darting across its surface.
  No stock, Cole decided, ever watered there; which argued that the creek was
  not far off and that this dilapidated camp was probably never visited by any
  one. Certainly the place bore no sign of having been disturbed for months.
  The stagnant water did not appeal to Cole, but the trickle from a finger-wide
  crack in the rock above was clear and cold to his lips. Cole held his
  throbbing, bandaged wrist under the thin stream until the cloth was soaked,
  and returned to Eagle.</p>

  <p>Mutt, with that same brisk, high-stepping gait, trotted before him,
  frisking as he had almost forgotten to frisk&mdash;one needed human friends
  for audience when one did that&mdash;and deporting himself generally after
  the manner of a nondescript, rusty red dog with an enormous capacity for
  affection that has been starved and thwarted until all at once it finds
  expression in strange and pestiferous ways. All the while Cole was
  ministering to the wounded horse, the Mutt&mdash;or plain Mutt he had
  become&mdash;barked and played and cavorted madly among the bushes. He jumped
  clear off the ground, tongue out for a passing lick at Cole's face. He
  pounced and gnawed and worried Cole's boots, flying back to growling attack
  when Cole pushed him off. Tiring of that, he went off and barked at Johnnie
  and his mates, busily grazing around the roots of the bushes for the tender
  grass roots which grew there. He was all dog, obtrusive, irrepressible,
  forcing attention; a Mutt, a mental tonic for Cole who, having laughed at him
  once, laughed often that day.</p>

  <p>That evening, having pitched his tepee tent beyond the cabin near the
  spring, where it would not easily be seen by any chance rider who came that
  way, Cole sat on his bed roll with the dog in the crook of his arms and
  carried on quite a conversation. His horses grazed near by, the wind was down
  and the sky a gemmed glory of stars. Eagle stood beside the spring where he
  could drink without having to stir from his tracks, and leisurely munched dry
  grass which Cole had patiently gathered, squaw-fashion, in an old burlap
  sack. Up on the ridge behind him an owl hooted in measured accents to his
  mate, and on the high slope of the little butte a coyote yammered at the
  world.</p>

  <p>For the first time since he rode away from the C Bar L, Cole's eyes were
  unshadowed, the deep crease was smoothed from between his eyebrows. He could
  look about him with a sigh almost of content; for scant comforts it is true
  and for small mercies perhaps, but content nevertheless. He had needed a
  friend and he had found one that did not know his tragic secret, that would
  not question him about his past, that would never care who or what he had
  been before to-day. For Mutt it was enough to snuggle there in Cole's arms,
  full fed with man-cooked food, no longer forlorn.</p>

  <p>"You're a great old Mutt, ain't yuh?" Cole whispered, bending low to speak
  into one lifted ear. "Guess he was lonesome here all by himself; guess it's
  pretty lucky I happened along&mdash;hunh?"</p>

  <p>And Mutt, whimpering endearments, reached up and licked the boy adoringly
  on the neck in eloquent response.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; ALSO THE WOP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HURTS deeper and more lasting than gunshot wounds healed
  there in that lonely hollow in the month that followed. For a time Cole's
  activities were confined to little necessary tasks which he could perform
  one-handed while his wrist healed. It kept him fairly busy, for he must spend
  hours each day pulling grass for Eagle, whose shoulder must have perfect rest
  until the torn muscles renewed themselves with fresh tissue.</p>

  <p>Cole could not understand that long, ragged wound, until he decided that
  it must have been made by a bullet that had flattened against a rock and
  ricochetted at a tangent, finding Eagle's shoulder in its path and tearing a
  way through the muscles; an ugly wound which would have cost a veterinarian
  some anxious thought.</p>

  <p>At first, Cole kept the horses close under cover of the ridge in daylight,
  turning them loose at night to graze. Hourly he waited for discovery, grimly
  determined to shoot at sight. "Shoot first and ask questions
  afterwards&mdash;eh, Mutt?" But when day after quiet day slid behind him and
  no one came to the hollow where the deserted camp stood forlornly in a welter
  of high sagebrush, Cole insensibly relaxed his vigilance and wandered afoot
  beyond the ridge and found the creek, just as he had expected, flowing
  quietly along through a rocky little ravine into which the horses picked
  their careful way to drink.</p>

  <p>"Say, a fellow could build a dam across this narrow neck, and run ditches
  and raise hay down below there. Wonder why nobody ever thought of that
  before? Mutt, how'd you like to turn nester?" It was an idle thought, no more
  than the recognition of a natural opportunity going to waste, but it gave
  evidence of a healthier state of mind. Cole was beginning to interest himself
  in his surroundings, to forget the cataclysm from which he had fled.</p>

  <p>He wondered what had happened to the fellow who had built the cabin, had
  dug post holes and stretched wire and fashioned that crude shed for his
  horses. Some one who had meant to start a ranch, he guessed; some one who had
  left unexpectedly, who had not just moved out in accordance with some change
  of plan. For while the cabin had been gutted it had been done hastily, and
  many things had been left which the owner would have wanted to take with him.
  Books, half a sack of weevily flour, a box of dried fruit, wormy beans.</p>

  <p>It looked to Cole as if something must have happened to the man who lived
  there; as if he might have been robbed&mdash;killed, perhaps. It would not be
  surprising in a country that held John Roper, he thought. Perhaps this was
  why the place was left so completely to itself; why Mutt, in all the months
  he must have lived here by himself, had found no human companionship until
  Cole wandered into the hollow that night. Whatever the reason for its
  complete desertion, the place offered sanctuary now, when Cole most needed
  it, and if there was reason why the place should be deliberately shunned, so
  much the better for him. Eagle's wound was slow to heal and Cole could not
  move on until the horse was in condition to travel.</p>

  <p>After a while, when no one came near and the dilapidation of the cabin and
  corral began to get on his nerves, Cole set to work making repairs. He
  cleaned out the cabin, mended the door, removed a rat's nest. When he had
  moved in he fixed the corral fence, straightening the posts and nailing the
  wire back in place. There were tools enough in the shed, and the work served
  to pass away the time. He was glad now that he had bought plenty of supplies
  at that little store and post-office down below the Muleshoe ranch. He would
  not go hungry if he spent another month in the hills.</p>

  <p>Then one morning here came Mutt from one of his hunting trips, and with
  him came the Wop&mdash;named in the first startled sentence when Cole set
  eyes upon him. The Wop was a pot-bellied old burro with limp ears that spoke
  of deep-seated melancholy and a disposition which leaned toward unexpected
  nippings and small heels lifted with amazing suddenness against whatever
  chanced to annoy him.</p>

  <p>Stepping high, Mutt led him triumphantly to the very door of the cabin
  where Cole stood grinning at the pair. Cole was so unwise as to offer the
  burro a piece of bannock and a bacon rind, and that settled it. The lonely
  little camp came under the rule of the Wop, and nothing short of shooting
  would have eliminated him.</p>

  <p>That day Cole was obliged to take Eagle by slow, hobbling degrees to the
  corral and shut him inside, reinforcing the wire fence with sagebrush to keep
  the Wop outside. That day, too, he scoured out an old zinc washtub and placed
  it in the corral for a watering trough, because the Wop and Eagle had
  developed a feud at first sight and a horse with only one good front leg
  can't kick the paunch off a burro, however much he may want to do so.</p>

  <p>"I oughta brain you, Mutt, for bringing that moth-eaten monstrosity home
  with you!" Cole grumbled, while he wiped the sweat of toil from his face
  after hacking sagebrush with a dull ax and carrying it to build the barricade
  between Eagle and his enemy. "You wait till Eagle gets well! I bet the Wop
  will hit for the hills again and keep on going. The place for that bird is
  the Sinks."</p>

  <p>Still, the Wop stayed and Cole in his friendlier moments doled out crusts
  of bannock and laughed at the pestiferous little beast; which made the Wop's
  presence worth while, whether Cole realised it or not.</p>

  <p>One night, after he had sat for a long while on the doorstep with Mutt
  curled between his feet and his guitar pressed against him while he stared
  down over the quiet starlit valley and plucked wistful thrumming melodies
  from the instrument, Cole had a dream&mdash;a vivid, colorful dream which
  stayed with him all the next day and for days thereafter, dragging him back
  to his misery and adding the burden of loneliness to the homesickness it
  bred.</p>

  <p>He had dreamed of the C Bar L boys; of Billy Parrish and Gene and Red. He
  had been riding with them on round-up, hazing cattle out of the brushy draws,
  talking and laughing with them. Later he had been at camp, eating supper and
  lazily spinning his rope in a circle around him, hopping in and out while the
  boys lay around on the ground, smoking as they watched him. It was very real;
  too real. In some subtle way the secluded little valley with the old cabin
  set back in the hollow against the ridge had changed overnight. He had gone
  to bed thinking that he would like to make a ranch of this place, wondering
  if it were government land open to settlement. He got up realizing how empty
  the place was, remembering how long it had been since he had exchanged
  laughing words with any man.</p>

  <p>He wished now&mdash;for a matter of minutes&mdash;that he had not repulsed
  the friendship and sympathy of the C Bar L boys. They had tried to treat him
  like a brother and he had turned his back on them, snarled at them, told them
  to leave him alone. Well, they had done it, that last day. They had ridden
  off to town and left him there, eyeing him askance with hurt reproach. The
  sheriff had tried, and he too had gone off half angry, willing to let Cole go
  his own gait.</p>

  <p>Now Cole was dimly aware of a great loss which he had thus far ignored.
  Loss of his father, loss of the ranch, the cattle, the horses&mdash;yes,
  there was that. But the loss of friends, of young fellows to ride out with
  him on the trail of adventure; fellows to joke with him, argue with him,
  wrestle and work with him&mdash;he had lost all this too, thrown it away from
  him foolishly, childishly, just because trouble had come and he had hated the
  thought of their knowing!</p>

  <p>Not all of this did Cole realize perhaps, for he was not much given to
  analysis. But he knew that he missed the boys terribly and that this was a
  lonesome hole and there was no use in living like a hermit. Just as soon as
  Eagle could travel he would get out and find a job with some decent outfit,
  and have fellows to talk with. The whole country couldn't be filled with men
  like Roper and his gang, who would kill a man for four horses.</p>

  <p>He could make friends&mdash;he always had been able to make friends, and
  he didn't believe it was because folks thought his father was rich, either.
  He could go back right now and find plenty of friends; but he wouldn't,
  because they would be sorry for him and he did not want sympathy. No, even
  now he was determined that he would make his way among strangers. If he ever
  went back, it would be when he had money, cattle, land, was a successful
  stockman who had made every dollar on his own hook, without any friendly
  boosting.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE FIGHTING COWGIRL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">COLE was in the corral, trying to make himself believe that
  Eagle was fit for the trail again in spite of the fact that the horse moved
  stiffly when he moved at all and seemed to prefer standing in the shade of
  the shed, dozing and switching his tail apathetically at the droning flies.
  He did not care now whether the other horses were near him or not. He was
  content to eat the grass Cole brought him, to sip a little water from the old
  tub, to nod and blink the hours away. He was getting lazy, said Cole; he
  needed exercise in those shoulder muscles. He needn't think Cole meant to
  spend the rest of his life rustling grass for him in a gunny sack, just to
  save him the trouble of finding it himself. But in spite of Cole's coaxing
  and upbraidings, in spite of morsels of bannock held out enticingly while
  Cole backed slowly away from him, Eagle did not show any enthusiasm for
  walking. The torn muscles in his shoulder were still stiff and painful and he
  had learned the foolishness of useless effort. Even cold bannock did not seem
  to him worth that price.</p>

  <p>But in the midst of his apathy he threw up his head and stared past Cole
  at something beyond. There was a muffled pounding of galloping hoofs sweeping
  down into the hollow. Cole whirled and looked that way, then ran for the
  gate.</p>

  <p>Down through a depressed place in the ridge came a dozen horses running
  straight for the cabin, or perhaps straight for the opposite side of the
  basin, which would take them past the cabin. Fifteen or twenty, Cole
  estimated them at a glance, with several colts running alongside their
  mothers. Behind them, swinging a rope and shouting, a single rider
  galloped.</p>

  <p>Cole stopped outside the gate and stood watching the little herd wistfully
  as it clattered past. Some cowboy bringing in horses for the fall round-up,
  he guessed. There must be a ranch, then, farther down the creek. It did
  strike him as unusual that only one man was driving the bunch, but there was
  always the chance that the riders had become separated and would meet farther
  along. A nice little bunch of mixed stock&mdash;and then he gave a shout and
  started running.</p>

  <p>Very cleverly the rider had swung the herd toward Cole's horses, feeding
  down toward the creek. The horses had gone tearing in among them, swept them
  along with heads and tails up, stepping high as if they thought it a great
  adventure.</p>

  <p>Instantly Cole thought of Roper. Had they discovered his retreat here
  under the ridge and taken this seemingly innocent way of getting his horses?
  It did not seem likely that they would risk the attempt with only one man,
  but then there might be others hiding behind the ridge, waiting to see what
  would happen and ready to take a hand in the foray if necessary. That would
  be like Roper, who apparently planned always to make a sure thing of his
  stealings.</p>

  <p>No matter. Cole pulled his gun and fired two shots after the rider as he
  ran. It was simpler than shooting tin cans as he galloped past them, and he
  would probably have made a hit if the range had been shorter. Even at that
  distance he had the satisfaction of seeing the rider's hat go sailing to the
  ground, and he went down on one knee, meaning to take a more careful aim next
  time, when the rider swerved and came galloping back, waving a six-shooter.
  It was not that flourishing of a gun instead of shooting that made Cole give
  a grunt of dismay and get upon his feet. It was the long, tawny braid
  whipping out behind the rider's bare head.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands! What the devil do you mean, shooting at me? Do you
  want me to kill you?" She had ridden close and pulled up her horse before
  Cole, glaring down at him while she pointed the gun more or less in his
  direction.</p>

  <p>"What are you running off with my horses for?" Cole retorted angrily. "Why
  wouldn't I shoot? There was no way of knowing you are a girl&mdash;in that
  outfit!"</p>

  <p>That outfit happened to be a pair of bib overalls, and the girl looked
  ready to murder him.</p>

  <p>"You'd have shot anyway," she told him unfairly, her eyes blazing. "What
  are you doing on our land, anyway? You've no business here with your horses.
  Go get my hat! Go on, before I take a shot at you!"</p>

  <p>Cole looked at her, looked at his gun which he was still holding in spite
  of her command that he put up his hands. He gave a snort and slid the gun
  into its holster.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;you could shoot a man and it would be fine and dandy, but
  you know darn well I couldn't shoot a woman."</p>

  <p>"Sure, you couldn't. Give me that gun!"</p>

  <p>"You go to&mdash;thunder!"</p>

  <p>"Give&mdash;me&mdash;that <i>gun</i>!" Had she been on the ground, the
  girl would undoubtedly have stamped her foot at him.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see you take it off me!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you think I couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"I give you leave to try it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't need it, or I would. I can kill you with this one, quick
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure!"</p>

  <p>"Will you pick up that hat?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" Cole was mad, and he did not intend that she should get away
  with his horses, but there was no reason why he should not get her hat for
  her. He wanted to see just where he had hit it.</p>

  <p>As he walked down to where the hat lay brim up on the sand, the girl rode
  after him, her horse held firmly to a pace that kept his nose within nipping
  reach of Cole's shoulder. Indeed, a blob of bit slobber landed moistly
  against Cole's ear and that young man started at the unexpectedness of the
  contact.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you aren't shot&mdash;yet," the girl maliciously assured him, and
  Cole hated her for the implication that he had jumped because he was
  afraid.</p>

  <p>"Glad you told me," he sneered, and stooped for the hat. As he picked it
  up and saw the brown hole in the crown alarmingly close to the band, saw too
  the cut where the other bullet had clipped the brim, his heart gave a thud of
  dismay; a close call, that.</p>

  <p>"What rotten shooting!" said the girl, seeing how his cheeks had paled and
  probably understanding why.</p>

  <p>"Not so good," he admitted perversely, looking her fairly in the eyes as
  he gave her the hat. "I need practice."</p>

  <p>"I don't." The girl dropped the reins over the saddle horn, took her hat
  and settled it expertly with one motion on her head. But she did not tuck up
  the tawny braid under the crown, because to do that she would need both hands
  and she would not put away the gun. "I couldn't miss that way if I tried.
  When I shoot, I&mdash;mean business."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about my horses? When you drive off a man's horses, do you
  mean business too?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't drive off your horses. They went along with my bunch because
  they wanted to. They don't belong here, anyway. You have no business on our
  land. I advise you to get off it."</p>

  <p>"And I advise you to bring back my horses."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you do!" She seemed to consider, eyeing him with a lurking imp in her
  eyes. Cole would have called it a devil.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't want your horses mixed up with mine, I can tell you that.
  And I'm certainly not going to hold a round-up all by myself to please you.
  If you want your horses, you can hike along to the ranch after them. It's
  only seven or eight miles."</p>

  <p>Cole knew where he wanted to tell her to go, but he could not bring
  himself to say it. According to his simple code, one did not swear at girls.
  One took them to dances and danced with them and made sly love when the other
  fellow was watching with murderous eyes, and&mdash;when one was that
  particular kind of a saphead&mdash;one fell in love and married and settled
  down. But no fellow with any manners or any self-respect ever swore at a
  girl.</p>

  <p>"What's that horse doing in that corral? Why don't you ride him after your
  horses?" She had turned and was looking back at Eagle; now she turned a
  suspicious glance toward Cole.</p>

  <p>"He's laid up. I can't ride him."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>"Shot&mdash;er&mdash;cut with barb wire. He's lame. You'll have to bring
  my horses back, I tell you. I certainly am not going after them afoot," he
  told her with stubborn eyes and compressed lips.</p>

  <p>"Say, I don't <i>have</i> to do <i>anything</i>!" Supreme scorn vibrated
  in her voice as with a twitch of the reins she rode back to the corral.
  "We'll see about this horse shot with barbed wire. Sounds like a lie, to
  me."</p>

  <p>Cole did not reply to that but contented himself with wishing furiously
  that she was a man. While she sat on her horse and stared over the
  brush-woven wire fence at Eagle, who stared back rather apathetically, Cole
  got his rope. Whatever this damnable girl did or said, he meant to have his
  horses back and he did not mean to walk seven or eight miles after them,
  either. Just how he was going to recover them without walking after them, he
  had probably not decided, but his actions indicated that he expected her to
  drive the bunch back where he could rope out his own animals. At any rate, he
  started off toward the creek with his rope looped over his arm, walking
  unhurriedly and carefully refraining from looking behind him. Mutt came
  loping down off the ridge to join him, yelping joyously that his master was
  actually going for a walk. Even the Wop came loitering out from among some
  high bushes, stopped to waggle his great ears in deep cogitation and then
  made up his mind that whatever was in the wind he meant to share.</p>

  <p>The girl, however, did not overtake Cole until he was across the creek and
  following the dust cloud kicked up by the horses as they trotted away down
  the valley which he had thought would make a good hay meadow. Then she came
  loping behind him, settling her horse to a walk when she had overtaken
  him.</p>

  <p>"I must say you've been making yourself at home," she remarked, after a
  dozen paces during which Cole refused to recognize her presence. "Can't say
  I'd want to sleep in a bunk a man had lain dead in for a month, but some
  folks are not very particular."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd go haze those horses back here," Cole said in a throttled
  voice, after another five minutes of silence. "You had no business driving
  them off in the first place."</p>

  <p>"If I rode on ahead, you'd probably use me for a target again. You said
  you needed practice."</p>

  <p>"Oh, hell!" said Cole, but he said it into his shirt collar.</p>

  <p>"And blazes," said the girl calmly. "Besides, I didn't drive them off.
  They went because they wanted to. I've got enough to do without wrangling
  horses for hide-outs." With that she touched her horse lightly with the quirt
  and rode on away from him, sitting her horse with the easy grace of a slim
  young cowboy; of Cole himself, for instance, since he was slim and young and
  rode like a Centaur.</p>

  <p>At this moment he walked stiffly, like a man going up to challenge a bully
  to an old-fashioned fight. Whenever his toe struck against a stone he gave it
  a kick that sent it spinning. The girl looked back and caught him doing that
  once, and he could hear her laugh as she rode on.</p>

  <p>"Lucky thing for her she ain't a man!" gritted Cole, the veins standing
  out on his forehead with the beating blood of his impotent wrath. Of course
  he couldn't take a shot at her now, knowing her for a woman; but he wanted
  to, badly enough&mdash;or at least, he thought he did. To trail her down that
  valley afoot was the most humiliating thing Cole had ever done in his life,
  but he had to go. A girl like that&mdash;with a tongue like that&mdash;never
  in this world would she drive back his horses. No, she gloried too much in
  making him walk after them. Trying to get back at him for shooting at her, he
  supposed. Well, how was he to know the difference?</p>

  <p>"If she wants to wear breeches like a man, she can take her chance of
  being shot like one!" He dismissed that incident, glaring after her with hot,
  angry eyes. "Hide-out! Oh, damn her, anyway!" After that he damned Johnnie
  and Hawk and Mick for stampeding with her galloping herd. They ought to know
  better; they did know better, but horses will be horses, however carefully
  they have been brought up; however well trained they may be, there is always
  the element of mob psychology to reckon with. Cole walked half a mile while
  he invented new and vividly profane ways of threatening to beat the tar out
  of those three runaways when he got his hands on them, but in his heart he
  knew that they were forgiven before they were caught, and that he was merely
  venting a little of his anger on them because there were such well-defined
  limits to what he could say of a girl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; COLE MAKES A FRIEND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FARTHER down the creek where the butte thrust out a rocky
  toe as if to wall in the valley and permit only the little willow-fringed
  stream to go creeping past, the girl reined in sharply behind the steeply
  sloping barrier and dismounted, leading her horse behind a high rock out of
  sight and anchoring the reins by the simple method of laying a loose rock
  upon the ends. Then, picking her way back to the end of the bold projection,
  she settled herself to watch Cole's unwilling and somewhat toilsome
  approach.</p>

  <p>Not more than a long rifle shot away down the creek, the little herd that
  had, with its clattering rush, stampeded Cole's horses was now taking time
  from its homeward journey to make squealing acquaintance with the three
  strangers in their midst. Where the butte had again drawn back and left a
  small, sage-covered flat beside the creek, the horses were circling and
  playing, lifting heels in pretended dislike, nipping necks, tossing heads and
  uttering shrill, hypocritical squeals as they touched noses with the
  newcomers in momentary how-de-do.</p>

  <p>Glancing that way to make sure that there was no real trouble brewing, and
  that the horses were only playing like unmannerly children, the girl turned
  back to her real object in stopping there; which was watching Cole through a
  pair of field glasses much the worse for hard usage on horseback. Certain
  nicks in the lenses did not add much to their efficiency, but the girl was
  used to making allowances for what she saw. At any rate she could see that
  Cole's stride was still truculent and his face still scowling and that he
  looked as if he were on the trail of his worst enemy and fully intended to
  commit murder when he got his hands on the victim. There was nothing in
  Cole's look or manner to excite mirth, yet the girl giggled as she watched
  him. Or perhaps she was laughing at Mutt, trotting alongside Cole with that
  high, prancing gait and an arrogant tilt to his head; or at the Wop, trailing
  dismally along in the rear, the picture of shaggy, pot-bellied woe that could
  only manifest itself by the dejected droop of the great, limp ears and the
  melancholy sag of the lower lip.</p>

  <p>When Cole drew near to the rocky point where she was hidden, the girl
  lowered the glasses and feasted her impish eyes on the picture of throttled
  rage which he made. Then he spied the sportive herd not far beyond and his
  face lighted eloquently in anticipation of getting back his own. The girl's
  hand went over her mouth to suppress her laughter when she saw how eagerly he
  took down his rope and widened a loop, how meticulously he arranged the coil
  so that it would cast out freely with no hitch or tangle.</p>

  <p>"You, Johnnie! Thus-and-so your blink-blink ornery hide; get outa that
  bunch before I bounce a rock off your back, you tra-la-la
  and-I-wish-you-may-die so-and-so et cetera!" Cole's voice would have carried
  farther than a bullet had he shot while he spoke, for all his pent wrath was
  in the words&mdash;freely translated here, you understand.</p>

  <p>The girl gave a gasp of horrified delight and ducked back to where her
  horse was hidden. Another rod and Cole must have discovered her hiding there,
  but as it was she jumped her horse out before his astonished eyes and
  galloped away to the herd, yelling and swinging her rope-end with a whooping
  sound that sent the horses wheeling into full flight with a great kicking of
  dust and a tossing of heads as they scampered toward home, Johnnie of the
  blackened reputation, Hawk and Mick galloping rapturously in their midst.</p>

  <p>Once more Cole bitterly regretted her sex that held him absolutely
  helpless, his gun standing uselessly in its holster, even his fluent speech
  halting paralyzed upon his tongue. In utter silence he recoiled his rope and
  went on doggedly tramping through the thin dust haze which floated like a
  gray veil behind the vanishing herd.</p>

  <p>By the way that gray veil hung suspended over the creek bank a mile
  farther on, Cole knew that the herd had halted again, perhaps to drink and
  splash water in the ford, while the girl held back and waited for him to come
  up. He hated the thought of playing up to her expectations, but there was no
  way out for him. If he must follow her forty miles, he must follow her forty
  miles; that was all there was to be said about it, for he meant to have his
  horses back. A man who was not a thief might have relented and let him catch
  his own horses out of the herd. That was the unwritten law of the range, and
  the breaking of it willfully was merely an invitation to fight. But with a
  girl like this one all rules were suspended and there was no law. She would
  do as she pleased, and it looked very much as if she pleased to tantalize
  Cole with that herd and force him to walk as far as possible for his
  horses.</p>

  <p>Which is exactly what she did do.</p>

  <p>She was an expert hand at driving a herd, Cole was forced to admit that
  much to himself. She knew just when to loiter along and let the horses settle
  down to graze and play, so that Cole would have time to come up almost near
  enough to have some hope of getting back his own; maddeningly near, but never
  quite so close that Johnnie would feel the necessity of obeying the note of
  authority in Cole's voice. She knew just how and when to start them moving
  onward&mdash;Cole would never believe that her whirlwind descent into the
  hollow and the carrying off of his own horses in the rush was the accident
  she had proclaimed it to be. She had planned to stampede them; he would
  always think that, no matter what she said.</p>

  <p>With that skill in driving, she managed to arrive at the ranch corral with
  Cole and Mutt so close behind her that they seemed one friendly party, man
  and dog walking while the lady rode horseback. A damnable lie to put upon the
  appearance of things, Cole stormed within himself as he came up.</p>

  <p>A little, plump woman of middle age and a lovable, sweet face set down two
  full milk buckets and hurried to open the corral gate, and the horses trooped
  in as the girl dismounted beside the stable and started to unsaddle. The
  older woman closed the gate upon the milling herd and turned an inquiring
  gaze upon Cole.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," she greeted him with a pleasant little note of welcome
  which overrode her surprise. "You haven't had an accident, I hope? Did your
  horse throw you?"</p>

  <p>"His stock got mixed with my bunch, Mom so he came along after them," the
  girl informed her mother equably, as if it were the most commonplace incident
  in the world.</p>

  <p>"Your saddle horse and all? Too bad! But now you're here, you must have
  supper with us, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cole. Not Mr. anything&mdash;just Cole." He did not know why he said
  that. The words had come out of their own accord. Later, he thought he must
  have wanted her to call him Cole from the beginning, because her voice and
  her ways reminded him so much of his mother.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Cole, come right on up to the house and have supper with us
  before you bother about your horses. They're safe in the corral, and I just
  put hay in the mangers so they won't go hungry. Dorthy, I wish you'd bring
  the eggs out of the loft when you come in. I haven't had time to gather them.
  You won't object to bacon and eggs for supper, will you&mdash;Cole?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;thank you, but I can't stop. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you can. You wouldn't insult an old lady who thinks well of her
  cooking! Besides, we must do what we can to make amends for getting our
  horses mixed with yours and putting you to all this trouble of coming after
  them afoot. Of course you'll have supper with us."</p>

  <p>With that gentle ultimatum she turned and picked up the two buckets of
  milk. The act, unconscious as it was from long custom, jarred Cole out of his
  angry aloofness. A little woman like that packing two heavy buckets of milk?
  Not while he was around!</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;never mind. I'm used to it&mdash;I don't think anything of
  it," she protested, flushing a little with a pretty flutter of confusion when
  Cole would have taken them from her.</p>

  <p>"My mother never had to do the milking, or pack two buckets of anything!"
  Cole blurted almost roughly, his own tanned cheeks flushing oddly as he
  looked into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your mother missed something, then." But she released her hold on the
  handles and walked beside Cole up the path to the house. "I really don't mind
  doing the milking; it has to be done, and I'm glad I've got the health and
  strength to do it. Dorthy has enough to do without having the chores on her
  shoulders."</p>

  <p>Cole had nothing to say to that.</p>

  <p>"Did you have to walk far? You look pretty hot and tired. A cowboy does
  hate to be set afoot! I should think Dorothy could have ridden into the bunch
  and roped out your saddle horse. Why didn't she?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know she could rope," Cole said lamely. Inwardly he was furious
  because he must defend the girl to save the mother's feelings. She would be
  terribly shocked to know how her precious "Dorthy" had acted, he thought.</p>

  <p>"You didn't? Why, Dorthy is one of the best hands with a rope there is in
  this country! Even if you didn't know it, I don't see why she didn't catch
  out your horse for you. She shouldn't have let you walk all this&mdash;how
  far did you walk?"</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;not very far. It was easier to come on to the corral. I
  didn't mind the hike." But the lie was for her, not for the girl, he wanted
  to add.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right, then. She wanted you to come for supper, I guess.
  Dorthy does get pretty lonesome; young folks need some one to talk to, more
  than older folks do. When you get along toward sundown you have plenty to
  think about and you don't feel there's so much to say."</p>

  <p>"You aren't anywhere near sundown!" Cole warmly protested, setting down
  the milk buckets inside the spring house where she had led him. He turned now
  and smiled down into her eyes, pushing back his hat with the boyish gesture
  his mother had loved; certain girls of the Black Rim too, if the truth were
  known.</p>

  <p>She laughed, happily and with an adorable shyness which made Cole want to
  hug her. Funny, he thought, how she could be the mother of an impossible
  creature like Dorthy. Maybe she was only a stepmother. Surely there couldn't
  be any blood relationship between those two.</p>

  <p>"Just for that you shall have a cup of new milk," she chuckled. "I'd like
  to know your mother and tell her what a nice boy she has. Do you live
  anywhere&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She's dead," Cole said bluntly to head off inconvenient questions. "No,
  I'm a stranger here. Just riding through."</p>

  <p>"Too bad." Here voice was instantly remorseful. "Seems to me you're pretty
  young to be off among strangers, but boys grow up before we know it and want
  to go riding off to see the world for themselves. You can't be much older
  than my Dorothy. She's twenty."</p>

  <p>"That so?" Then in spite of himself, "I'm twenty-one. Let me strain the
  milk. Those buckets are heavy. Say, you've got a wonderful milk house here,
  haven't you? You must milk lots of cows."</p>

  <p>She told him all about how the stone milk house had grown from the first
  primitive brush shelter over the spring, and how her husband&mdash;"Dorothy's
  father," she called him, thus unconsciously answering one of Cole's mental
  questions&mdash;had built the house and the milk house and the whole ranch,
  bit by bit, in odd times between working for their richer neighbors.</p>

  <p>"Just like the coral builders, I used to tell him," she laughed, as if it
  were all a joke. "We came here with nothing but a couple of cows and one work
  team and a saddle horse; yes, and an old hen with thirteen chicks that my
  mother gave me when I was married. At first we lived in a tent, right where
  this house stands. Then Dorthy's father managed to get this kitchen part
  built, for us to winter in. Dorthy was born right in this room! We cooked and
  lived and slept right here for two years before we got another room built on.
  By that time the tent was just about whipped into ribbons, so we just had to
  have more shelter. Young folks don't know what it's like to rough it,
  nowadays.</p>

  <p>"Our two sons are buried back up here on the hill. Dorthy's father had a
  boy by his first marriage, and when we got the big room built on, he went and
  got him from his wife's folks&mdash;she died when the boy was born&mdash;and
  we raised him from then on. His father thought he'd be a help on the place as
  he got older."</p>

  <p>A faint inflection of regret in her voice gave Cole the impression that
  she did not consider her stepson such a help as they had hoped he would be,
  but the shadow passed and she was smiling again and taking a hatful of eggs
  from the girl who came into the kitchen at that moment and stooped to give
  her mother a kiss.</p>

  <p>"Steve didn't get back yet, Mom?" The girl paused in the doorway of
  another room, completely ignoring Cole's presence in the room.</p>

  <p>"No, Dorthy. Didn't you see anything of him?" Her mother's glance and tone
  were anxious.</p>

  <p>"I was back in the hills, toward Black Butte. I didn't see anybody at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Nobody at all? Where did you meet this young man, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;he was camped at Looey's cabin. I brought the horses down
  through there. What you got for supper, Mommy? I'm half starved."</p>

  <p>"Looey's cabin? Why, that must be nine miles! Why in the
  world&mdash;&mdash;" There was no use in finishing the question, for Dorothy
  had gone in and closed the door behind her. Cole was surprised that she did
  not slam it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Harris (Cole learned the name later that evening) looked at Cole in
  shocked enlightenment, but it spoke well for her absolute loyalty to her own
  that she made no comment upon the fact that he had walked nine miles simply
  because her daughter would not rope his horse out of the loose bunch. She
  seemed to realize too that there had been trouble of some sort; that
  relations were strained between this well-mannered young man and her
  daughter. She looked at him keenly, saw nothing there to arouse
  distrust&mdash;though he did look rather sullen&mdash;and hurried her
  preparations for supper.</p>

  <p>It was when she went to set the chairs to the table that she caught sight
  of the bullet hole in her daughter's hat, which Dorothy had flung down as she
  came in. Mrs. Harris picked up the hat and twirled it slowly upon a
  forefinger while she examined the telltale marks. Having lived in that rough
  country all those years, she must know a good deal about bullet holes, Cole
  thought. She did not say anything, but her eyes went to Cole's face and
  remained there, holding his glance with remorseless questioning.</p>

  <p>"I did that&mdash;by mistake. I thought she was a man stealing my horses,
  and I took a shot at her before I&mdash;saw. Her hair came down before I took
  aim again. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So <i>that's</i> why you walked in!" A lurking gleam, somewhat like the
  devil in her daughter's eyes, lighted her glance for an instant and was gone.
  Her breath hissed gently out between her teeth as she turned and hung the hat
  on a nail beside a window.</p>

  <p>"Well, supper's ready," she announced briskly, dismissing the matter as if
  with the sweep of invisible hands. "Dorthy, are you ready for your supper?"
  Then, quite unexpectedly, she came over and dropped a hand lightly upon
  Cole's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Son, you're a good shot," she said shortly. "It's a dangerous
  accomplishment sometimes&mdash;if you shoot before you're sure."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; "BULLETS AND BLOTCHED
     BRANDS&mdash;&mdash;"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DOROTHY came out of the other room so changed that Cole
  would not have recognized her if she had kept that devilish gleam from her
  eyes when she flicked a sidelong glance in his direction. She was dressed in
  soft, dull blue with a white lace collar which even Cole could see was
  handmade. She was slim and straight and not very tall, and her hair was done
  low and parted on the left side and waved down in nature's own original idea
  of a Marcel wave, with little loose tendrils curling around her ears. But
  Cole did not think she was pretty, for all that. He hated her and scorned to
  see any good in her whatever. Only the sweetness of her mother&mdash;yes, and
  the delectable odor of bacon and eggs and coffee&mdash;prevented him from
  stalking out of the house when she entered the room. He did rise and stand
  beside his chair until she was seated (Not all range men are ignorant of
  social usage, in spite of what is told and pictured of them), but he set his
  teeth together while he did so, and would not look at her.</p>

  <p>"I know you must both be starved, so start right in while I pour your
  coffee. Cole, do you take cream and sugar?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Mrs. Harris. I prefer mine black, if you please." Cole
  smiled his best social smile at her while his eyes turned for a venomous
  glance at the girl, who he felt was watching him.</p>

  <p>"You're wasting a chance at this thick cream," sighed Mrs. Harris, as she
  handed Cole his cup. "I forgot to ask you how you liked your eggs, Cole, so
  just help yourself to the ones you like. There's hard and soft both.</p>

  <p>"Dorthy, I didn't get any wood cut for the bathtub, yet. I thought maybe
  Steve would be back and I could get him to drag up some brush from the creek.
  I didn't like to use that good wood&mdash;I wanted to save it for baking; and
  brush heats the bathtub just as well."</p>

  <p>Cole's swift, under-the-eyebrows glance caught a flush of embarrassment on
  Dorothy's cheeks, but her voice remained matter of fact.</p>

  <p>"I'll drag up some brush after supper, Mom."</p>

  <p>"I'll be glad to get you some wood, Mrs. Harris. My horse Johnnie will
  haul as much as a team&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dorothy choked on a hastily swallowed bit of bread, and had to leave the
  table. A cold sweat appeared on the brow of the young man, who abruptly
  recalled certain blistering phrases shouted at Johnnie. She did hear, then! A
  red tide of shame swept from Cole's collar up to his thick brown hair and
  receded, leaving his face slightly pale and set. Well, damn it, it served her
  right for caching herself there where she could eavesdrop! But the defiant
  thought held scant comfort, since Cole's memory of that particular anathema
  was excellent; full-flavored round-up talk is not for the ears of women.</p>

  <p>"Dorthy's father fixed us a bathhouse down below the spring, just the
  summer before he died," Mrs. Harris explained, to cover the confusion of her
  daughter's hurried retreat. "He always tried to save us steps, and packing
  water in here and heating it in the wash boiler made a lot of work&mdash;and
  water can't be piped into the house, because it's higher than the spring and
  we never have been able to afford a pump and tank. We put the house here on
  account of the shade. We couldn't move the spring, and we couldn't move the
  grove, so we just had to take our choice and make the best of it.</p>

  <p>"But since we've got the bathhouse fixed, it's real handy; only we haven't
  any way of heating the water yet, except building a fire under the tub. And
  we try and keep brush dragged up from the creek for it, but Dorothy has so
  <i>much</i> to do, riding and keeping up the fences, and looking after the
  stock and delivering butter to the ranches where we've got steady customers,
  that sometimes it's nip and tuck, whether we have wood for our bathtub, or
  whether we don't."</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;haven't you a man, Mrs. Harris? This
  Steve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steve," she told him constrainedly, "is my stepson; Dorothy's father's
  boy by his first marriage. He don't seem to take after his father a bit. He
  ain't much help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mother, why don't you tell the truth and be done with it?" Dorothy had
  returned, watery-eyed and with a huskiness in her voice, but with her
  disposition unimpaired, it seemed.</p>

  <p>"Steve's worse than nobody at all. If he didn't hang around we'd hire
  somebody and be done with it. As it is, we're always kidding ourselves along
  with the hope that Steve will come home sober, and will do a day's work maybe
  before he leaves again. He went off a week ago to get some part for the mower
  so he could cut the oats, and he isn't back yet and won't be back. I've got
  the team up, and I'll start in to-morrow on the oats, if I can make the mower
  work at all. They can't stand any longer, or they'll be too ripe for hay. If
  it was wheat," she added rather plaintively, "we could let them ripen and the
  chickens would have scratch feed all winter. But oats&mdash;and we need that
  hay. Steve knows all that just as well as we do."</p>

  <p>"You can't stack them, Dorthy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can too, if you'll drive the team and load."</p>

  <p>Cole lifted his cup, took a swallow of coffee too hot for him and blinked
  as he set down the cup.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you with the oats, Mrs. Harris. I'm not doing anything&mdash;I
  was going to look for a job just as soon as my horse gets well&mdash;that's
  why I was staying at that camp. One of my horses got hurt and couldn't
  travel. I&mdash;I'll be glad to help you out." He did not look toward Dorothy
  at all. He did not want to think about her if he could help it. It was for
  the mother he was doing it&mdash;because she was sweet and reminded him of
  his own mother. In spite of the girl he would help the mother, and he hoped
  she would never know the effort it had cost him to make the offer.</p>

  <p>"We couldn't pay any kind of wages, son." Impulsively Mrs. Harris reached
  out and laid her hand over Cole's fingers where they rested beside his coffee
  cup. "We'd have had a man hired long ago if we could afford it.
  But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If Steve would let a man stay on the place, you mean," Dorothy
  interrupted her mother with angry impatience. "You know why we can't have a
  man, Mom. Steve would come home and raise Cain about it, and fire him, and
  storm and bully you about the expense, and then saddle his horse and go
  again. A man can't stay on the ranch, is why we don't have one."</p>

  <p>"But we couldn't pay wages, Dorthy; you know we couldn't. With cattle so
  low this year we can't sell any, and we couldn't pay a man wages out of the
  butter money, and that's about all we'll have to run on. I know Steve is real
  mean about our having any one around, but there's other reasons. So we thank
  you just the same, Cole, but we couldn't let you work here."</p>

  <p>"I don't want wages, Mrs. Harris. I've been camping on your
  land&mdash;&mdash;" Cole gulped down his pride and stared hard at his
  plate.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's all right! We don't care the least bit how long you stay. If
  Looey's camp is any use to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, the time drags terribly with nothing to do. While my horse is
  getting well enough to travel, I could ride over mornings and help get the
  oats up&mdash;I'd like to do it, just for&mdash;just for pastime
  and&mdash;and to help you out." Cole looked at her shyly now, but he
  carefully refrained from looking at Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"I appreciate&mdash;no, I don't believe we could let you do it, Cole. It's
  fine of you to want to, and Dorthy and I are just as grateful as we can be.
  But you see, Steve may be home any minute, and he expects to put up the hay.
  He wouldn't like it&mdash;he'd take it as a hint we don't want him here, if
  he should come home and find we'd got somebody in his place. We'll try and
  get the oats cut ourselves&mdash;if the mower will run. I don't believe it
  will, till Steve brings back whatever he took to get fixed."</p>

  <p>"Steve took the sickle bar," Dorothy informed her mother with a savage
  quality of calm; or as if a savage mood lay just beneath the calm. "I saw him
  ride off with it. I know why too&mdash;but I didn't like to say anything to
  worry you, Mom. There wasn't anything wrong with the sickle, except that it
  needed sharpening. He took it so the oats would spoil on the ground. I know
  it, now that he has stayed this long away. Before, I just suspected it, but
  now I know. Mommie, Steve wants to make us give up the ranch; you know that.
  He has been after you to leave him in charge, ever since Poppy died."</p>

  <p>"I can't give up this place," Mrs. Harris said firmly. "Your father and I
  took it up as a homestead when we were first married. It's my home. I helped
  him clear it, burning the brush while he grubbed out the sage roots. I've
  seen it come out of wilderness foot by foot, almost. You were born in this
  room, Dorthy. Your father died in there in the bedroom. I&mdash;why, I've
  heard every hammer blow that has ever been struck on this ranch, building one
  thing after another! Give it up to Steve? Indeed I sha'n't!"</p>

  <p>"He'll starve us out if he can, Mom. He wants the ranch, and he doesn't
  want us here, and if we won't go he'll try and force us out. I'll cut those
  darned oats," she added fiercely, "if I have to do it with the shears! I'll
  show Steve!"</p>

  <p>She would too, Cole thought to himself, as he remembered her inflexible
  temper where he himself was concerned. A girl that would make a fellow walk
  nine miles just because he had mistaken her for a horse thief, and would
  devil him all the way into the bargain, would certainly be capable of
  starting in on a field of oats with a pair of shears. Cole was human enough
  to grin, in spite of his intense dislike of her.</p>

  <p>"Well, I would!" she reiterated, looking at him for the first time since
  their arrival.</p>

  <p>"I bet you would," he assured her as briefly.</p>

  <p>"Try some of this cream on your gingerbread, Cole," Mrs. Harris
  interposed, as if she feared an argument. "I want you to have some, because I
  know you don't get it in camp and I never saw the boy that didn't like cream.
  I'll let you drag up some brush, after supper, if you will, but I don't feel
  as if I ought to ask you to help put up the hay. We can manage. Steve isn't
  quite as bad as Dorthy thinks. They don't get along together at all, and you
  can't expect her to see his virtues&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"His what, Mom?"</p>

  <p>"There now, Dorthy, we won't argue about it. He's your own father's boy
  and as such he's got a home here as long as he wants it. Your father would do
  as much for mine, if I had a son and left him behind. I do draw the line at
  giving up the place to him entirely&mdash;your father would rise up in his
  grave if I should think of such a thing as giving up our home that we made
  together and lived on all these years. But we won't aggravate Steve any more
  than we can help, and I'm sure he's welcome whenever he rides in. It's his
  home as well as ours. We mustn't overlook that, Dorthy."</p>

  <p>Dorothy did not reply to that, and a little silence ensued which Mrs.
  Harris finally broke with innocently unwelcome questions concerning Cole's
  family and home; questions which he parried as well as he could, though he
  did talk a little of his mother because that subject seemed to bring him
  closer to the sweet woman who was so like her.</p>

  <p>After supper Cole borrowed a saddle (it had belonged to Dorothy's father,
  Mrs. Harris told him with pathetic earnestness) and dragged dead wood up from
  the thicket along the creek. The much-prized bathhouse, he discovered, was a
  patched affair of board ends and canvas, which looked as if it might be the
  frazzled remnants of the original tent in which Mrs. Harris had spent her
  honeymoon. Water from the spring was piped to what suspiciously resembled a
  six-foot, galvanized iron watering trough with an outlet hole in one corner
  now plugged with a whittled block of wood. The place smelled of smoke, and
  the piece of canvas laid down for a rug was littered with ashes that had
  blown out from under the tub since the last firing.</p>

  <p>Cole shook the canvas strip and spread it smoothly again upon the dirt
  floor, laid the wood ready for a match blaze and went out, futilely wishing
  that this sweet-faced mother might have the deserted bathroom at the C Bar L.
  As to Dorothy, he considered that this crude makeshift was good enough for
  her; served her right, was his silent comment on the primitive arrangement as
  it concerned her.</p>

  <p>"I'll come over in the morning and bring the saddle back, Mrs. Harris, and
  thank you for the supper," Cole said, looking down at her as she stood by the
  corral gate, her face shining palely in the dusk.</p>

  <p>He did not say good night to Dorothy, who was walking away to the house as
  if the closing of the corral gate after his horses finished whatever business
  she had with him and she had no further interest in his existence.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the girl stopped inside the yard fence and watched him go,
  Johnnie setting the pace at a swift gallop, Mick and Hawk and Mutt loping
  along behind him, and the Wop trailing disgustedly after the party, his
  shaggy paunch swaying as he walked.</p>

  <p>"He's a real nice boy, Dorthy," said Mrs. Harris coming up to where the
  girl stood staring into the dusk. "Why in the world you wanted to make him
  walk all the way over here beats me! But I'm real glad he came. It did him
  good to have a regular meal of victuals. He misses his mother, I guess."</p>

  <p>"His horses have all got blotched brands," Dorothy pointed out with
  pitiless meaning. "And you notice he didn't tell you where he's from. I
  wouldn't put myself out too much for him, Mom, if I were you. He's on the
  dodge, I'll bet on that."</p>

  <p>"I don't care if he is," her mother retorted spiritedly. "He's been real
  well brought up, you can see that. And he spoke so nice about his
  mother."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, Mom! Jesse James had a mother, I suppose&mdash;and the
  chances are he loved her too. Did you notice his clothes, Mommy? <i>He's</i>
  no forty-dollar-a-month man, wearing those simple expensive things. You want
  to look out, I tell you. I know more about him than you do. If I'd been a
  man, he'd have killed me in cold blood! He's bad."</p>

  <p>"I know better. No boy of his age with eyes like that and the upbringing
  he's had, can be so awful bad. He's no killer, if that's what you mean, nor a
  horse thief either. He's as nice, well-behaved a boy as I ever saw; nice
  inside, too. You can't fool me, Dorthy. I looked right down into his eyes and
  saw what's behind them. I know."</p>

  <p>"And I," said Dorothy flippantly, as she moved toward the house, "looked
  right down into his six-shooter and heard the bullet go through my hat. And I
  also heard words come out of that sweet boyish mouth that would shock you to
  death. You're so good yourself, Mom, anybody can fool you." She threw her arm
  around her mother's shoulders and the two walked up the path together.</p>

  <p>"He's got Looey's cabin neat as wax," she added irrelevantly, "and his bed
  was made as smooth as a woman could do it, with the blankets all tucked in at
  the edges and the pillow plumped up&mdash;a white pillowslip, Mom&mdash;and
  <i>clean</i>. And he's got a guitar and some books. 'The Lays of Ancient
  Rome' was open on the bed, where he'd been reading it, and he had a Bible and
  'Two Years Before the Mast,' and 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Little Men,' and
  'Ivanhoe.'&mdash;and blotched brands and he's ready to shoot on sight."</p>

  <p>"It all goes to prove that he comes from a good home," Mrs. Harris
  contended. "He's a nice boy, and I always will say so."</p>

  <p>"It all goes to prove," said Dorothy, "that you can't most always tell.
  Bullets and blotched brands; they speak louder than books. You can think what
  you please, Mom, but I'm going to keep an eye on this new pet of yours. I
  wouldn't trust him out of my sight!"</p>

  <p>All of which proves that Cole was nearly right; that you never can count
  on women, because they make their own laws.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; "IT'S FUN, MOWING."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MOM'S new pet spent a restless night and was up at the first
  hint of dawn, with his breakfast eaten and his horse saddled, ready to fill a
  sack with grass gleaned down along the creek where it flowed out across the
  flat. He worked fast, pulling up everything that looked eatable for a horse,
  and so had the sack stuffed full and was galloping back to the corral before
  the upper edge of the sun had crept up into the warm blush of clouds over the
  hills to the east. He carried water and filled the zinc tub splashily, and he
  packed his more treasured belongings in the leather bag and hid it among the
  rocks above the spring, just in case some one else came meddling around the
  place while he was gone.</p>

  <p>He was on his way to the Harris homestead before the sun had quite lost
  its deep orange glow. He had to return that saddle, remember; furthermore, he
  was worried about those oats. Steve, he had long ago decided, was a skunk.
  Worse than the girl, who was plain ornery. But at least she did treat her
  mother fairly well, and seemed willing to do what she could to hold things
  together.</p>

  <p>"A woman like Mrs. Harris has got no business working in a hayfield," Cole
  told himself more than once, to justify his interest in the work. "She'd have
  it to do, too. That darned girl couldn't fix a mower if she tried."</p>

  <p>Riding as if fiends were after him, Cole covered the nine miles before the
  freshness was gone from the morning breeze. Mutt, galloping his best with the
  glare of determination in his eyes and his tongue hanging dry over his
  grinning teeth, was all of a mile behind when Cole swung off the sweating
  Johnnie at the corral gate and began uncinching the borrowed saddle on
  Mick.</p>

  <p>As he carried it to its place on a peg at the far end of the stable, he
  saw that the work team was harnessed. Either Steve was back and ready to
  start work with the mower, or Dorothy was more hopeful of making repairs.
  Cole stopped outside the stable and looked around, trying to discover some
  clue to the motive behind that stabled team eating grain for their breakfast.
  Nothing was changed, no new saddle hung anywhere in sight to show that the
  stepson had arrived. Cole guessed it was hope, and went over to the mower
  that stood with up-ended tongue beside the blacksmith shop.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that Cole's knowledge of farm machinery was sketchy
  and gleaned mostly from watching the ranch hands at work, but boys have a
  knack for picking up information, even at play. Cole had spent a good deal of
  time around the blacksmith shop at home, and he knew pretty well what he
  wanted now. That was a sickle bar with all its teeth sharpened ready to bite
  into the oat field; he did not really expect to find one, but he started in
  hunting as if he did. And such was his luck that in the blacksmith shop,
  standing in a corner behind the bench, he found an old sickle. Some of the
  teeth were gone, however, and what remained were dull and rusty. It did not
  look very promising but it was the best in sight and he laid it out on the
  work bench and went rummaging amongst the clutter of bolts, old clevises,
  nuts and all the odds and ends that any ranch may be expected to accumulate
  in twenty years of pinching economy. When he found a box with a dozen new
  sickle teeth and rivets, he was as pleased as a boy over a nest of young
  mice; so pleased that he began to whistle as he laid them out on the bench
  and undertook the task of fitting them into place on the bar.</p>

  <p>"Well! I thought Mom told you she didn't want any hired man!" Dorothy,
  attracted by the whistling, was standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"She hasn't got any hired man," Cole interrupted his whistling long enough
  to retort, and went on with his work.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked at him, glanced back at the mower, looked again at Cole and
  walked away to the house.</p>

  <p>"Mom, your Billy the Kid is here and has staked himself to the job of
  toggling up a sickle bar to mow the oats," she announced without preface.
  "That being the case, I may as well take the butter over to Miller's. That
  is, if you're going to be chicken-hearted and let him go to work when he
  knows we can't afford him."</p>

  <p>"Why, he's just doing it as a favor, Dorothy! It's real kind of him; I
  wonder if he's had breakfast. Did you ask him?"</p>

  <p>"Mom, do you realize what will happen if Steve comes and catches that
  fellow here?"</p>

  <p>A sparkle came into the kindly eyes that sometimes looked a bit faded. Now
  they darkened until they were almost the color of Dorothy's, and hers were a
  deep, greenish hazel.</p>

  <p>"What will happen will be that Steve will behave himself and mind his own
  business," her mother said tartly. "If this young man has a mind to help get
  the hay up, that lays between him and me and it's <i>nobody's</i> business.
  I'm running this ranch yet; at least, I think I am!"</p>

  <p>"All right, but you better keep the shotgun handy to enforce your
  authority when Steve comes home," Dorothy grimly advised her.</p>

  <p>"I thought you said Steve intends to spoil the hay crop," her mother
  reminded her shrewdly. "He ain't likely to come boiling back in time to do
  the work, if that's the game. You go right on and take the butter now, and
  I'll attend to Steve's case, Dorothy."</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked as if she had some doubt of that, but she saddled her horse
  and presently rode away with ten pounds of butter nicely packed in white
  cloths wrung out of cold spring water, the whole tied in a sack behind the
  cantle. And Cole, watching her departure from under his hat brim, heaved a
  sigh of relief and went off to the house for more explicit information
  regarding the oat field he had undertaken to harvest.</p>

  <p>Mutt arrived and drank wearily from the spring creek, where a flock of
  tame ducks waddled and quacked, and afterwards flopped down in the shade
  where he could keep an eye on his master while he rested. There were no yelps
  or prancing left in Mutt this morning. He did not even get up to bark at the
  team and mower when Cole drove past him, but cocked one eyebrow in sardonic
  questioning and let them go. Cole, he observed in offended silence, did not
  even seem to know or care that he had come.</p>

  <p>For the first time since the tragedy that had sent him drifting out into a
  world he distrusted, Cole Lawson was happy for a day. With his hat on the
  back of his head and his fine riding boots braced against the iron foot rest,
  he drove a rattly old mower round and round that five-acre field of oats and
  forgot the past from which he had fled. If the swaths he cut were scallopy at
  first and left thin strips of grain stalks standing, that was a blemish soon
  erased from the work. Somehow he knew that the song of the old sickle made
  pleasant music for the sweet little old lady who hummed old-fashioned tunes
  as she worked in the house. Somehow he felt that here was work worth while,
  work he never would regret doing.</p>

  <p>In mid-forenoon, when the mown grain lay drying in the sun and sending up
  a fragrance of harvest time, the little lady for whom he toiled came bringing
  him fresh buttermilk and gingerbread. Cole's grin was the kind the C Bar L
  had known.</p>

  <p>"And I'm going to have fried chicken and doughnuts for dinner, and custard
  pie for supper," she told him smilingly. "You're making a real good job of
  it, Cole, and you don't know how thankful I am."</p>

  <p>Cole swallowed the last of the gingerbread and brushed crumbs off his
  smile.</p>

  <p>"It's fun, mowing. Beats setting around camp doing nothing. I wish there
  was more of this stuff to cut. I'm getting through too quick, is all I don't
  like about it."</p>

  <p>"That sickle's pretty dull," she remarked. "Better bring it in with you at
  noon and we'll grind it. You know how, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Y-yes&mdash;or at least I can learn. I've watched 'em ground, anyway. But
  I never hung around Dad's hay crew much. I was always out with the boys,
  riding." It slipped out unguardedly. He bit his lip, hoping she would not
  notice.</p>

  <p>If she did she gave no sign, and presently she went away and left him to
  his work. But now the sickle sang of long, hot afternoons at the C Bar L,
  when four mowers went steadily round and round the great Lawson meadows, one
  behind the other, making a strident chorus, while farther afield the patent
  stacker lifted a great load of timothy and clover high in air and tilted it
  down upon the stack, where men with forks plunged at the fragrant mass,
  shaping it, working furiously to be ready for the next load. Of wagons
  lumbering up, drawn by sleek giants of horses with arched necks and big, soft
  eyes. Of trooping groups of "hay diggers" coming in to dinner; strangers who
  drifted in to the ranch for work when haying began, sweated and toiled in the
  hayfields, straggled up to Cole Lawson's office at the house to get their
  pay, shouldered their strapped blanket rolls and caught a ride to town,
  drifting out again to no one knows where until the next haying season.</p>

  <p>He raised haunted eyes from the nodding grain that seemed to march up and
  trip suddenly upon the shuttling sickle knives, to lie prone and wilting in
  the sun. Here was no great, level expanse of hay to be garnered in long,
  loaf-shaped stacks, food for hundreds of hungry mouths. Here was a small,
  uneven patch of half-ripened grain, hemmed in by gravelly, sage-grown hills
  on one side, sloping down to the deep green of alfalfa in the flat where the
  creek could spread and water it. Twenty years in the growing, and the ranch
  no bigger now than the main line-camp of the C Bar L. A few horses, a few
  cattle, a few acres of uneven land, and two women to care for it and call it
  home! If his father, with hundreds of acres of hay and thousands of cattle,
  had failed and lost heart so that he could not face life any longer, what
  chance had these two women?</p>

  <p>Cole turned back when he reached the edge of the field and drove an
  erratic course over the morning's mowing, gleaning the thin strips of grain
  he had missed between the swathes. After that, he was careful to drive
  straighter, to cut the last oat stalk that stood on the edge of the sown
  ground, anxious that not one grain should be wasted. As he thought of the
  long, cold winter that would come, he wondered how many head of stock must be
  fed and tried to estimate how many tons of hay the crop would yield. If it
  were only a matter of riding or roping or trail drives, he would know better
  how to judge. He wished now that he had paid more attention to the ranch
  work. He could have learned a lot from Nels Peters, the ranch foreman.
  Instead of that he had looked upon Billy Parrish as the walking encyclopedia,
  and Billy Parrish had never tried to conceal his scorn for anything that
  required manual labor. Cole had not even known the names of the "hay
  diggers"; his interest in the work had consisted in riding down to watch the
  stacking crew now and then, or to galloping somewhere to deliver a message to
  some one.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you've turned grindstone times enough," Mrs. Harris bantered him
  when, after a most satisfying chicken dinner, she led him down toward the
  spring where the grindstone stood spraddled in the shade of a great
  cottonwood.</p>

  <p>"Why, no. I guess the men did that with their feet. Yes, I know they did,
  now. I've watched them, but not often." Cole was too full fed and contented
  to be on his guard.</p>

  <p>"Your father had quite a large ranch, I s'pose."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;pretty large, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't you remember?" She was looking at him now, but Cole busied
  himself with the sickle, avoiding her gaze.</p>

  <p>"No. Too small. Kids forget."</p>

  <p>Silence lay between them after that. Cole had lied to her and she knew it
  and was hurt. At first he resented the uneasy consciousness that he need not
  have lied; after a while he remembered how he had told her that morning that
  he had spent most of his time out on the range, riding. She would remember
  that, of course. She knew he had lied, that he was covering up his past from
  her friendly interest.</p>

  <p>He had an impulse to tell her what it was he was hiding, but the stubborn
  streak that had sent him away from his friends held his tongue in leash. No.
  He had started out to bury the past and he would not dig it up now; not even
  for her. She would be just as kind if she knew, even kinder perhaps. But he
  did not want to see in her eyes that she was thinking of it.</p>

  <p>Somehow they got the sickle ground and Cole watered the horses and went
  back to work, and all through the rest of the cutting the sickle told him he
  lied, he lied, he lied.</p>

  <p>Oh, well&mdash;it didn't amount to anything, anyway. She was an awfully
  nice woman, but she didn't have to know all his past life. Old ladies had no
  business to be so inquisitive, he told himself over and over. What difference
  did it make how big his father's ranch was? But in his heart he knew that the
  difference lay in the fact that he had lied, and that was all the difference
  in the world.</p>

  <p>He did not stay for supper, but saddled Mick and went racing back to camp,
  Johnnie and Hawk galloping like wild horses behind him and Mutt straining
  every muscle to keep up. The reason he gave to himself for not staying for
  supper was because the girl was home and he did not want to see her or have
  anything to do with her. But that was not the real reason and he knew it just
  as well as Mrs. Harris knew why he would not stay.</p>

  <p>The next day he did not go over there, but he watched the weather, afraid
  that it would rain on the hay. On the day after that he rode over, found
  Dorothy in the field raking, and after an undecided five minutes while he sat
  on his horse and watched, unseen from the house because of the grove, he
  turned and rode back again. He was not needed, he said. But his spirits were
  heavy and he did not play the guitar that day or romp with Mutt, who watched
  him solicitously with wise, sad eyes and his head cocked sideways.</p>

  <p>Once more Cole Lawson felt himself exiled from all he cared for in the
  world, an outcast who had himself closed the gate and could not go back. Once
  more he had no friends save his horses and the dog. The hand of fate was
  raised against him and there were none to care what became of him.</p>

  <p>A morbid mood, probably caused by indigestion from eating too many warm
  doughnuts at a sitting&mdash;for Cole had managed to devour four that day of
  the mowing. But whatever created the mood, it was just as real to Cole as if
  the Harris door had been slammed in his face.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; MOTHER HARRIS ASSERTS HERSELF</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"IT'S going to storm, Mommie, and we'll have to get that hay
  in, whether Billy the Kid ever shows up again or not; or Steve, either. Never
  mind the dishes, Mom, but get into some overalls and come drive the wagon for
  me. The churning will have to wait too. I wouldn't trust this weather
  overnight." Dorothy in her bib overalls reached for her bullet-scarred hat
  while she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Cole must be sick," her mother said worriedly, getting up from
  the table and reaching for the butter and cream which must be carried into
  the milk house whether anything else were done or not. "I can't think what
  else would have kept him from coming to finish the hay."</p>

  <p>"Sick nothing! Had to beat it out of the country, most likely, with some
  sheriff on his trail. I do wish you wouldn't try to mother everybody that
  comes within a mile of you, Mom. That's just what ails Steve; you've been so
  darned good to him, he thinks he owns you body and soul. You never get any
  thanks for spreading your wings over everything you see. You know half the
  time you're hovering door knobs. Concentrate on your loving daughter, Mom. I
  sure will need a lot of hovering, if I pitch all that hay on to the wagon
  before it storms."</p>

  <p>"I don't know as there's a pair of overalls that I can get into, Dorothy."
  Mrs. Harris plainly was accustomed to being lectured for her kindness of
  heart; at any rate she paid no attention to it now. "Steve wore that pair I
  bought for myself. They were hanging up in the stairway, and I guess he
  thought they belonged to him."</p>

  <p>"As if he cared who they belonged to! Well, scare up something to put on.
  I don't want to worry about you tangled up in skirts on a load of hay, Mom.
  I'll go hitch up. And do leave the dishes alone and get ready! The house'll
  wait, but the hay won't."</p>

  <p>That final admonition had the desired effect. Mrs. Harris went to the door
  and looked out at the brassy sky fringed on the western sky line with puffy
  white clouds, and decided that the hay was more important than the breakfast
  dishes, that day. She was ready when Dorothy hooked the last tug and gathered
  up the lines.</p>

  <p>"Good glory, Mom! Don't stoop over quick, or you'll pop your seams!" was
  her respectful greeting, when her mother came up and stood trying to decide
  where would be the easiest place to mount the hayrack. "Don't go in behind
  old Joe, Mom! He tried to lam me in the stable, just now. He's on the peck
  about something or other. Here, put that box down behind the rack, and I'll
  pull you up. Glory, Mom, but you're getting fat!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up and mind your own business!" snapped her mother. "I guess I've
  got a right to what few pounds I own&mdash;there won't nobody try to steal
  'em off me, anyway! I could just about skin Steve for taking them overalls!
  He must look like the old Harry in 'em. I got them overalls to fit
  <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>"Those overalls, Mom. Glory, but you're getting careless. Fat and
  lazy&mdash;shame on you, old lady!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up and give me <i>them</i> lines, before I slap you!"</p>

  <p>"Say, you can't bully me, Mom&mdash;not in that outfit. You look exactly
  like a gingerbread man, Mommie. Where did you pick 'em?"</p>

  <p>"None of your business. Give me them lines. If I'm going to drive, I'm
  going to <i>drive</i>."</p>

  <p>"Joe's got one of his mean spells, Mom. Better let me drive till he
  settles down, anyway. You can't trust a pinto when he rolls his eyes like
  that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Teach your grandmother to skim milk! I drove horses&mdash;<i>pinto</i>
  horses, my lady&mdash;before you were born!" And Mommie, roused to that pitch
  of defiance which only a woman can attain who knows that she looks
  ridiculous, seized the lines and gave her daughter an elbow jab which set
  that young lady violently down upon the cracked plank which was built up over
  a rear wheel.</p>

  <p>The plank creaked ominously and a pitchfork bounced and rang its tines as
  Mrs. Harris gathered up the slack in the lines and clucked to the team. Old
  Joe, the temperamental pinto with one "glass" eye and the tricky white
  eyelashes that went with it, reared straight up and gave a lunge forward. The
  driver gritted her teeth and thrust out her jaw to a fighting angle.</p>

  <p>"You Joe! Behave yourself, now!" She swung the rein ends smartly down upon
  Joe's rump. "You'll get a good dressing down if you aren't careful! Joe! You
  mind what I tell you, now!"</p>

  <p>Joe minded so much that he ducked to one side and forward, smashing a
  corner of the hayrack into the post as the team went tearing through the
  gate. Braced with her feet far apart and her eyes aglitter, Mrs. Harris swung
  the lines again and sawed against the bits. Team and wagon went larruping up
  past the house, the wheels bouncing over rocks and hummocks in a way that set
  the pitchforks dancing on the rack.</p>

  <p>"Ma! You're ripping!" screamed Dorothy, hanging on grimly with both
  hands.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if I am! I'll take the starch out of this
  da-mned&mdash;old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something shot by her, halting the unseasonable epithet at her clenched
  teeth. The pinto swung away, forcing old Bonnie into a grassy ditch that set
  the wagon perilously atilt. Then Cole's right hand had grasped Joe's bridle
  and he pulled them back. The wagon lurched back to level, Johnnie galloping
  alongside the recalcitrant pinto horse. A remorseless drag at his head, a
  stiff-legged jump or two, and the team stopped.</p>

  <p>"Good morning! Old Joe's feeling his oats to-day, I guess. We thought we'd
  get the hay hauled in before the weather changes. It looks like rain, don't
  you think, Cole?"</p>

  <p>"Liable to storm, all right. I rode over to help. I'll be ready soon as I
  pull the saddle and shut these horses in the corral." Not for a thousand
  dollars would Cole have betrayed any doubt of her ability to handle old Joe.
  He turned and rode back toward the corral, and Mrs. Harris never suspected
  that he withdrew out of sight to watch her further progress toward the
  hayfield without embarrassment to her.</p>

  <p>"Now, I call that manners!" she declared triumphantly to Dorothy as she
  drove on, Joe contenting himself with little prancing steps and an occasional
  baring of teeth to old Bonnie.</p>

  <p>"Good thing you didn't turn your back to him, Mom. You better let me drive
  and load, now your pet outlaw is here to do the pitching. You'll have to cook
  dinner for him, I suppose&mdash;and Mom, you're all ripped up the back."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stay till he comes," her mother stubbornly decided. "I guess
  it won't be the first time he's seen torn overalls. I ain't going to trust
  you with this team while Joe's acting up. He'd run away with you and smash
  the wagon, like as not, and the hay would spoil while it was being
  fixed."</p>

  <p>Dorothy laughed, and that settled it. The little old lady stuck to the job
  until dinner time, salving her pride though her vanity suffered.</p>

  <p>But Cole saw only her courage and patience&mdash;her gameness, he called
  it to himself&mdash;and it never occurred to him that she made a ludicrous
  figure as she drove the wagon from haycock to haycock, expertly giving him
  the advantage of what little wind there was and never stopping too close or
  too far away. Cole needed all the advantages she could give him; he had never
  pitched hay before in his life.</p>

  <p>Load by load the field was swept bare to the stubble. The light breeze
  died to infrequent puffs of heated air as if a furnace door was suddenly
  thrown open. On the ground, Cole lifted great forkfuls of crisp oat hay,
  poised the heavy mass, heaved it up on the load where the girl caught it
  deftly with a fork, pushed it back with a spreading motion and waited,
  leaning on the pitchfork handle, while Cole raked the scattered wisps
  together into a pile and thrust in the fork. The load complete, Cole handed
  up his fork to Mrs. Harris, who knelt to reach the handle, then climbed up at
  the front of the rack&mdash;stepping behind Bonnie to do so&mdash;and lay
  panting and fanning himself with his big sombrero while she drove to the
  stack in the hay corral.</p>

  <p>During these short trips Dorothy remained out of sight at the rear of the
  load where she need not speak to Cole nor he to her; tacit acknowledgment
  that the feud still flourished. When Mrs. Harris pulled in close alongside
  the stack, Dorothy would rise and throw her fork lancelike into the loose
  hay, following it with a sliding jump. Then Cole would pitch the hay off to
  her, it being supposed that this was harder work than stacking, though
  secretly he suspected that she was perhaps better qualified to shape a stack
  than he.</p>

  <p>They lunched hastily off bread and milk and returned to the work, low
  mutterings in the west speeding their efforts to save the hay from a
  premature wetting. No one talked much&mdash;the labor was too arduous, their
  muscles too little accustomed to the strain put upon them. Intervals of rest
  became shorter, for along toward the last the horses were urged into a
  straight-backed trot between field and hay corral.</p>

  <p>The stack grew higher than the load of hay, and Mrs. Harris advised
  topping it off, even though some hay was left in the field. Dorothy did not
  think it was necessary, but the mother's judgment dominated after brief
  argument.</p>

  <p>"You don't know weather like I do, Dorothy," she added to the decision,
  for good measure. "What hay is left over we can put in a pile and feed it out
  before it spoils; but I ain't going to have the whole stack soaked, and it
  will be if we fool around much longer."</p>

  <p>Cole was glad. It seemed as though his back would snap in two if he had to
  pitch the hay an inch higher to meet Dorothy's poised and waiting fork, and
  to miss it, to fall short, would be an admission of failure he could not bear
  the thought of facing. No wonder patent stackers had been invented! He wished
  he had one now, and he felt a new and belated respect for the "hay diggers"
  he had passed by so casually at home. Nels Peters would have told him how
  awkwardly he pitched and would have shown him how much easier it could be
  done; but the women did not know he was doubling his labor, and Cole went on
  lifting and heaving while the blisters broke on his palms and wore the flesh
  raw against his riding gloves, and the muttering grew louder and nearer and
  more ominous as the thunderheads rolled up from the west.</p>

  <p>Under the older woman's direction the stack drew in at the top, tapering
  to a peak from both sides. She had miscalculated, it seemed, both the amount
  of hay left in the field and the imminence of the storm, for the peak went
  higher and higher until Dorothy had scant room to work and Cole stood on his
  toes and jumped to send each forkful farther, and still the thunder held
  itself down to an aloof grumbling.</p>

  <p>They were working to get the last load on the stack and put the weighted
  pole in place to hold it down. Cole was doing his weary best, savagely
  determined that the taunting look on Dorothy's face when she looked down at
  him should have no reason to express itself in words. So far he had sent
  every forkful within her reach&mdash;she would have to admit that much, at
  least.</p>

  <p>There was one more, and she was waiting for it, crouched on one knee, the
  sarcastic smile he hated on her lips. Cole raked the hay together on the
  floor of the rack, thrust his fork deep, braced himself and lifted, the cords
  standing out red on his neck with the exertion. He wondered if he could make
  it, and his back stiffened at the doubt. Higher and higher he elevated it,
  gathered all his strength for the final heave and went up on his toes just as
  a blast of wind caught the hay and twisted it, fork and all, from his
  grasp.</p>

  <p>Cole had been caught off his balance with his muscles straining for that
  final heaving motion. He went down with the hay. When he got up it was
  slowly, by painful degrees, with his head tilted sidewise because it was
  excruciatingly painful to move it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; JOHN ROPER AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">COLE could not remember how he came to be in the house,
  lying on a bed with the pungent odor of liniment pervading the air. He heard
  the patter of rain against a window, the steady beat of a storm that has
  passed its first fury and is now calmly drenching the land. This was strange,
  because he had a clear recollection of the sudden gust of wind that caught
  the forkful of hay, and he recalled the twisting pain when he went down with
  his burden. But he also remembered getting up&mdash;or starting to get up.
  There seemed to be a distinct break in events from there on. It was like a
  dream which fails to preserve the continuity of events; he crawled to his
  knees on the hayrack&mdash;and found himself lying on a bed in the house with
  rain and twilight and the smell of liniment.</p>

  <p>He tried to get up and discovered that he could not move; a burning
  sensation in his shoulder and the excruciating pain of wrenched muscles
  brought beads of sweat to his forehead when he made the attempt. He was aware
  of some one in the room, and Mrs. Harris bent over him solicitously.</p>

  <p>"Now, you lay right still," she commanded him. "It isn't anything but a
  wrenched back, or maybe it's up in the cords of your neck and shoulder. The
  same thing happened to Dorthy's father once, and laid him up for a few days,
  so I knew right away what had happened to you. I'll fix a poultice of hops
  and vinegar, and that will take out the soreness right away. And after a
  while, when you feel a little more like being mauled around, I'll massage it
  for you; maybe I can hit the spot that's kinked, and straighten it out all
  right."</p>

  <p>Cole bit his lip, ashamed of the mishap. He did not want her to wait on
  him and he was sure that in a little while he could get up and go saddle his
  horse and ride to camp. He couldn't leave Eagle shut up in the corral over
  there without water or feed; he'd go, if he had to crawl. Of course, women
  liked to fuss over a fellow&mdash;his mother had always been like that; but
  he was a man now, and he wasn't going to be babied.</p>

  <p>For the present, however, he let her fuss, since she insisted upon it. She
  brought him toast and tea to begin with, then hops and vinegar in a poultice
  so hot she could scarcely hold it, and finally, when the poultice had
  subsided a bit so that he could bear the heat of it without wanting to yell,
  she helped him turn over on his side and set to work massaging; a
  "by-guess-and-by-gosh" manipulation inspired by the hope of hitting the spot
  where lay the mischief. Cole gritted his teeth and endured it silently, and
  afterwards was advised to sleep if he could.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he did sleep, though he had intended to make another attempt to
  get up and go home. At any rate, he roused himself after another hazy period
  of time and saw that the room was dark and that the rain had subsided to an
  intermittent drip, drip, which lulled his senses to a drowsy quiescence
  bordering on dreams.</p>

  <p>Now he was aware of a man's voice in the next room; the kitchen, he
  guessed it to be, since the smell of coffee seeped in through the space under
  the closed door where lamplight glowed yellow on the floor. Steve had come
  home, then. There would be a row, he supposed, when Steve discovered a
  strange man in the house. Then, without wanting to listen, he heard Mrs.
  Harris speak in a sharp, worried tone.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how in the world Steve expects me to raise any fifty dollars
  for him. If he don't want it bad enough to come after it&mdash;and anyway, I
  haven't got that much."</p>

  <p>"As I said, Steve can't come himself or he would. He's laid up in the
  hospital and he sure needs the money bad, Mis' Harris. When a man's shot
  through and through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shot? You didn't tell me he was shot! What was it?&mdash;Some drunken
  brawl or other, I suppose."</p>

  <p>There was a slight rasping sound, the whispery clearing of a man's throat.
  Cole's nerves tingled with recognition; Roper, beyond a doubt, here in the
  house of this sweet old lady; apparently on friendly terms with her at
  that.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Steve wasn't drinking at all, Mis' Harris. It happened on the
  trail, in the dark; the trail over to Catrock. Him and a couple of the boys
  was ridin' along and they met a fellow that started in shootin' the minute he
  seen 'em. No provocation&mdash;he just shot on sight, b'fore they suspicioned
  what he was up to."</p>

  <p>"For pity sake! They must have known who he was; must have been some old
  trouble Steve's been into."</p>

  <p>"No, nothin' like that at all. Course, it was dark and they couldn't see
  his face, but from the description it was a feller that has been hidin' out
  somewheres in the country. Wanted for somethin' on the outside and come up in
  here on the dodge. Saw 'im m'self, couple of days before he got Steve.
  Travelin' with four horses&mdash;four good-lookin' bays. Every one of 'em has
  got blotched brands. Stole 'em somewhere, uh course.</p>

  <p>"So, Steve bein' shot and in the hospital, he thought mebby you might
  strain a point and let 'im have a little money till he gits on his feet
  again. I let 'im have all I could spare, but with cattle a drug on the market
  and horses worth just nothin' at all, I got about all I can do to keep my
  head above water, m'self. <i>Ahem-m.</i> He thought he could git by with
  fifty dollars, mebby. Bein' flat on his back is purty tough this time of
  year. Shuts 'im outa gittin' a job on round-up, and Steve's been plannin' on
  a job, to help you folks out."</p>

  <p>"If he'd been helping us out at home here, where he's needed," spoke up
  Dorothy's clear, uncompromising voice, "he wouldn't have been shot."</p>

  <p>"Now, now, there ain't no tellin'. Feller like that loose in the country,
  a man ain't safe in his own dooryard. Steve never brought it on 'imself, and
  I don't see how anybody can blame 'im."</p>

  <p>"It don't sound logical to me," Mrs. Harris objected. "Steve must have
  done something."</p>

  <p>"Not a thing more 'n to be ridin' along the trail. A feller that's wanted
  for murder, say, ain't goin' to ask no questions. He thought it was a possy,
  most likely; three men together like that made him think they was closin' in
  on 'im. Started right in shootin', first thing. The boys was goin' to take in
  after him, but Steve fell off his horse and they had to look after him first,
  so the outlaw got away. You folks want to be on the lookout, and don't take
  no chances. Now, about that money&mdash;Steve sure needs help right now, and
  he needs it bad. Hospitals cost money, and the boys 've chipped in all they
  can stand right now."</p>

  <p>"I've got to buy hay to winter on," Mrs. Harris worriedly explained. "We
  couldn't get in enough last spring to see us through, and Steve hasn't been
  any help at all. I'm sorry he's hurt, and I'd be glad to do anything I could;
  but if you can't, you can't, and that's all there is to it. I've got to go in
  debt for hay to feed my milch cows through till grass grows in the spring. I
  depend on my cows for a living, while stock is so low. You tell Steve I've
  let him have all the money I can, and from now on he'll have to look after
  himself. I'm sorry, but Dorthy and I have got pretty hard scratching
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>Apparently that was the final word, though Cole's turbulent thoughts
  effectually closed his ears to comprehension of what followed. He wanted to
  go out there and tell Roper to his face what he thought of him, and denounce
  the man to these women who spoke to him as to a friend, even though his plea
  for Steve must prove a failure. Certainly they did not question the truth of
  Roper's statements. They accepted the fact of Steve's injury and the
  circumstances under which he had received it, even though they could not fail
  to recognize Roper's description of the man who did it. But he was powerless
  to move or to defend himself from Roper, and common sense bade him hold his
  tongue for the present. He had no proof to bring forward to substantiate his
  accusations; whereas Roper could point to Cole's horses and say that here was
  evidence that he told the truth.</p>

  <p>Well, the brands were blotched; Cole could not deny that fact, even if he
  wanted to. They were his horses and he had a right to blotch their brands if
  he wanted to, though now he was forced to admit to himself that it was an
  unusual thing to do and that his right might be questioned. But above the
  spirit of self-justification which rose up in his defense, cold rage against
  this Judas of the range flowed strong and with a driving urge toward action
  of some sort. He did not know what kind of action; all he knew was that he
  couldn't and wouldn't let Roper get away with the lie.</p>

  <p>For the time being at least, mind dominated matter and Cole rose up from
  the bed and stood in the dark of the room, trying to decide what would be the
  better course; walk in there and call Roper the liar and thief he was, or
  wait for him outside. At first his impulse was to walk into the kitchen and
  have the thing over with, but then he thought of the two women and the scene
  which must follow his appearance. It would be too stagey; also it might be
  more before they were through with each other, and he was in no condition for
  a fight just now.</p>

  <p>He reached up a hand and felt of his neck, which still had a kink in it
  that prevented the straightening of his head. The breath-taking pain between
  his shoulders had subsided to a soreness, however, and he felt that he could
  walk well enough if he were careful not to bend or thrust his arms forward
  suddenly. No, he certainly was in no condition for a fight, but he could not
  stay cooped in that room doing nothing. He would get outside and wait for
  Roper, and&mdash;he did not know what he would do then, but he made sure of
  his gun, which he had tucked inside his waistband that morning when he
  prepared to pitch hay. At any rate, it was his left shoulder that was
  sprained, the left side of his neck that was drawn and stiff.</p>

  <p>All this he thought while he was feeling his way carefully along the foot
  of the bed toward the window. He remembered a door in that corner of the
  room, and now he wondered if it had squeaky hinges. He hoped not, and in
  another minute he had put his hope to the test and had it fulfilled. Of
  course, the women would not tolerate a squeaky door, he reflected, as he
  turned the knob slowly and pulled the door open.</p>

  <p>Outside the night air was fresh and cool, with a breeze that rustled the
  damp leaves of the cotton woods and flung cool drops of water into his face.
  They fell gratefully on his hot skin and the refreshing shock of their impact
  helped to clear his mind of fevered impulses toward inconsidered action. He
  made his way slowly down the path to the milk house, since he had emerged
  from the side of the house and the path led that way. He thought he would
  wait there until Roper came out and then&mdash;confront him and make him
  admit he lied, and force him to go back and tell Mrs. Harris so? He might
  better have walked out into the kitchen, if that were his intention.</p>

  <p>No, he did not know what he meant to do or what he could do. Cole was not
  the stuff of which killers are made and he had no thought of shooting Roper,
  as some men might have done.</p>

  <p>As it happened, the restrictions of his sprained shoulder saved him from
  headlong action that would have been foolish in the extreme. The kitchen door
  opened and John Roper stepped out to stand on the doorstep for a last word or
  two, with Mrs. Harris framed in the yellow light which shone from the room
  behind her. The light shone full on Roper's face, showing the long upper lip
  and the humorous pucker of his lips. And while her face was in the shadow,
  Cole got the impression of worry beyond anything he had seen her indulge in
  before; perhaps it was her voice that held it.</p>

  <p>"Well, you tell Steve I'm sorry, but I can't do a thing. I haven't got
  that much money to my name, right now. The County will take care of him till
  he's out of the hospital, I suppose&mdash;I don't know of any other way. I
  hate to think it's come to that, but there isn't anything I can do." Her hand
  was on the door, slowly pushing it shut as if she were anxious to terminate
  an unpleasant conversation.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell him what you said, Mis' Harris. He'll be more worried
  about you than about himself, I guess. Well&mdash;good evening." Roper
  stepped down and walked away.</p>

  <p>The door closed with a definite little bang as Roper went past the milk
  house, clearing his throat with that little rasping sound Cole had come to
  know so well.</p>

  <p>Cole stepped forward, his mouth open to call Roper's name, but the
  careless movement of his body brought instant and painful reminder of his
  hurt. A man with a stiff neck tilted sidewise like a meditative crow cannot
  take issue with his enemy without knowing all the odds to his foe, as Cole
  was forced to realize while he waited for the pain to subside. When he was
  finally able to go on, walking slowly to lessen the jar that went stabbing
  along his nerves, Roper was mounting his horse. Cole reached the gate just in
  time to see him ride off, a blurred figure that presently merged with the
  shadows behind the stable. Suffering, almost desperate, he could only watch
  in silence, hiding there because of his hurt.</p>

  <p>Even a man with long years of experience behind him would have found the
  situation intolerable; to Cole it was unthinkable that Roper should ride away
  and leave those lies behind him to rankle in the minds of the women; to go
  back and accept the further shelter and kindness of those who thought him a
  thief and a murderer was even worse, and Cole set his teeth and started for
  the corral. In spite of the pain, he meant to ride back to camp that night.
  He would not explain or argue or apologize. He would let them think what they
  pleased about him. The world was big and there was a lot of it he had yet to
  see; too much to make it necessary for him to stay here, where they had
  listened to Roper and had spoken no word in his defense.</p>

  <p>That to speak in his favor would merely acknowledge the fact that he had
  been there at the ranch and perhaps would furnish a clue to Roper, did not
  occur to Cole in his frenzy of outraged pride at the slander. He did not feel
  the need of protection from Roper, except that he had not thought it wise to
  challenge the man openly while he was helpless to wreak the vengeance Roper
  deserved. And the fact that he had shot Steve Harris that night did not weigh
  very heavily upon his conscience, though he now saw that the three men had
  probably known nothing whatever of Roper's sinister purpose. They had tried
  to stop him, and he had been one against three. As he saw it then, his
  mistake had been natural and justifiable. He was sorry he had shot Steve, but
  he did not see how any reasonable person could blame him.</p>

  <p>Like a wounded wolf, he wanted now to crawl off to his own camp and lie
  there until he was able to hold his own against Roper and his gang. Eagle,
  too, must be watered and fed; he could not be left shut up in that small
  corral. He would manage somehow to get to camp, and folks had better leave
  him alone until he was on his feet again. Then he would fight it out with
  them. If they were bound to give him the name of an outlaw, maybe he would
  take the game too. He surely wouldn't back down from anybody, from now
  on.</p>

  <p>He was fumbling with the gate, trying to lift it free of the ground and
  swing it open, when quick, determined footsteps came down the path from the
  house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; COLE AN OUTLAW?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"HERE! I thought you were laid out and couldn't walk!"
  Dorothy exclaimed petulantly as she came up and, reaching past him, calmly
  pushed the gate shut again and fastened it. "Mom is boss of this ranch, and
  she says you are not going anywhere to-night except to bed. What in the world
  ails you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose?" Cole was not breathing evenly because of the pain,
  and the words had a jerky, desperate sound. "You folks can believe all that
  devil tells you, if you like. He lied, and I could have proved it if you had
  come a little sooner. Your precious Steve was waiting down here for him to
  bring the money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're crazy!" Which from Dorothy meant merely that she was much
  surprised.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right. Get away&mdash;from that gate! I'm&mdash;going&mdash;to
  camp."</p>

  <p>"You're going to bed. How are you going to throw a saddle on your
  horse?"</p>

  <p>"I'll ride&mdash;bareback. Walk&mdash;crawl&mdash;&mdash;" Any one who has
  ever suffered from a sprained shoulder will understand why Cole broke off
  suddenly in his declaration of independence. He had forgotten and made the
  wrong kind of movement, that awakened the devil of pain again. A groan
  slipped out between his clenched teeth before he could stop it. He stood with
  eyes tightly shut and waited until the paroxysm passed, and so did not
  realize that the girl had left him until he heard her coming back with her
  mother, the two talking together in hurried, disjointed sentences. And he had
  wanted to slip away quietly without any wordy explanations, any attempt to
  justify himself in their eyes! They would not have it so.</p>

  <p>"For pity's sake, Cole, don't be silly! You can't ride, with that crick in
  your back, and you know it as well as I do. You couldn't get on your horse,
  let alone stand the jolting. You come right back to bed, young man. John's
  gone, and there won't anybody come looking for you&mdash;to-night, anyway.
  Why, I wouldn't think of letting you go back to camp to-night! I wouldn't
  treat a lame dog that way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>An unfortunate speech, which she realized too late. Cole turned&mdash;not
  quickly or easily, but with stiff, mechanical movement of body and head
  together, like a wooden doll. His words poured forth in a torrent of
  resentment.</p>

  <p>"That's why I won't stay here. You'd doctor me like a sick dog. You think
  I'm dodging the sheriff, just because that old horse thief told you so. You
  take his word for everything without even waiting to find out whether it's
  true or not. You think, because I marked out the brand on my horses, I must
  have stole them. You seem to think I'm going because I'm scared! If I was
  able to take the trail, I'd be after that horse thief and murderer of a John
  Roper and have it out with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, Cole, John Roper ain't any horse thief; he's got a ranch over beyond
  Catrock. He's related by marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care who he's related to!" Cole hotly interrupted her. "He hired
  me to work for him and then schemed to kill me so he could get my horses and
  outfit. If that don't make him out a horse thief and murderer, what does? He
  didn't get away with it, but that sure wasn't his fault. And then I heard him
  tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There, now, never mind what he told me. You come right on back to the
  house where you belong." Mother Harris laid a hand on his arm, gently
  impelling him toward the gate of the yard.</p>

  <p>"No, I can say all I've got to say right here! You may think he's an
  honest rancher, but I happen to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" Dorothy flung up a hand for silence.</p>

  <p>Down in the pasture below the corral there sounded the trampling of hoofs,
  as of horses running in sudden alarm. The noise grew louder and nearer,
  receded and for a moment ceased altogether. Then came a splashing in the
  creek, muffled thuds as the horses struck the sand on the farther bank, and
  afterwards silence.</p>

  <p>"Stole your horses, I'll bet," Cole grimly declared.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! John Roper has been here plenty of times and nothing was lost,"
  Mrs. Harris tartly rebuked him. "Something scared 'em, I guess; a coyote,
  maybe. You come on up to the house, Cole. In the morning, if you're well
  enough to ride, you can go; but not tonight. I wouldn't think of letting you
  tackle it. Anyway, you don't want to go off without your hat and coat, I
  guess. They're in the kitchen, and nobody's going to pack 'em down here to
  you."</p>

  <p>Reluctant, a bit sullen over her tacit acceptance of his guilt and the
  humiliation of being unable to disprove Roper's story, Cole walked slowly up
  the path with the two women. After all, she was right in one respect at
  least; he was in no condition to attempt the nine-mile journey to camp that
  night.</p>

  <p>"Now," Mrs. Harris began with gentle firmness, when she had helped him
  ease down into a chair in the kitchen, "let's get the straight of this thing
  and have it over with. Cole, did you shoot Steve?" She saw him hesitate and a
  shadow passed over her face. "We might just as well have a thorough
  understanding of how things are," she added gravely. "You needn't be afraid
  of us, Cole. Dorthy and I appreciate your kindness about the hay and we'll do
  whatever we can to help you, short of breaking the law ourselves. I wish
  you'd just tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Baffled and defiant, Cole looked up at her; obliquely, because he could
  not move his head.</p>

  <p>"What's the use? You take it for granted I'm all John Roper says I am. You
  think I'm hiding out from the law, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care so much about that, Cole. But John described you and your
  horses, and he says you shot Steve over on the trail to Catrock. Did you do
  that?"</p>

  <p>Cole stared down at the floor, hesitating over his reply. A guilty man
  might have looked as he did, and he felt it and added that detail to the sum
  total of his resentment against the situation Roper had placed him in.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I was coming out of the Sinks, getting away from Roper. I
  knew he was after me and had his men out looking for me, and when I thought I
  was about safe, three fellows came riding down the ridge, and they tried to
  stop me. I wasn't stoppable, that's all. I fired a few shots, and so did
  they, but I didn't know I hit anybody till I heard Roper telling you about
  it. They shot my horse, Eagle, in the shoulder. That's why I had to lay up at
  that deserted camp&mdash;because Eagle couldn't travel. They got me in the
  wrist too, but it didn't amount to much; just went through the edge and never
  hit a bone." Awkwardly, because of his restricted movements, he turned back
  the cuff of his sleeve and showed her the new scar.</p>

  <p>"So you think maybe you did shoot Steve?" Mother Harris sat down in an old
  cane rocker and began to rock gently, watching Cole with the commiserating
  interest of one who learns of the wrongdoing of a friend and is sorry.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I thought he was one of the Roper gang and was trying to
  get me." In spite of himself, Cole found that he was making excuses and
  trying to explain&mdash;which he had firmly decided he would not do.</p>

  <p>"John Roper hasn't any gang," she gently corrected him. "I can't
  understand your saying he's a horse thief and wanted to kill you. There's
  some mistake about that, Cole. John Roper's all right, far as I ever heard,
  and I've been in the country longer than he has. I don't believe you could
  get any one to agree with you, so I wouldn't tell that if I were you,
  Cole."</p>

  <p>"It's the truth, whether anybody believes it or not," Cole stubbornly
  replied. "Some day you'll find it out for yourself; maybe in the morning,
  from the sounds down in the pasture. If I could ride, I'd go see if your
  horses are all right. I <i>know</i> Roper's a horse thief. He was after my
  horses&mdash;but he lost out, that time." He glanced sidelong at Dorothy.
  "She better saddle up and go see if the horses are all right," he added
  gruffly. "She can use my horse, Johnnie; the one I ride most of the time.
  He's gentle."</p>

  <p>"Does he think I can't ride anything but crowbaits?" Dorothy demanded,
  ignoring Cole as pointedly as he had avoided speaking directly to her. "John
  Roper would know better than to run our horses off, even if he wanted to and
  was that kind of a man. I'm surely not going to blunder around in the dark on
  any wild-goose chase."</p>

  <p>"If you knew Roper as well as I know him, you wouldn't take a chance,"
  Cole retorted, looking toward Mother Harris. "It's none of my business, but I
  hate to see anybody swallow the smooth kinda talk that guy hands out. He's
  sure a Judas if there ever was one."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't steal from us, even if he was that kind of a man, as Dorthy
  says. Cole, I want to know the truth. Are you on the dodge for something
  you've done or are accused of doing? I ain't asking to be
  inquisitive&mdash;it's best to know the truth, so we'll be prepared in case
  somebody comes here looking for you."</p>

  <p>"That ain't likely to happen," Cole replied. "Anyway, I won't be here. I
  don't stay where my word is doubted."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Harris made a little clucking sound as if she felt her helplessness
  before his evasions.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell me where you're from, and what made you leave
  home."</p>

  <p>Cole could not shake his head, but he closed his lips in stubborn silence.
  Tell why he left home, and have Dorothy's sharp tongue make a bitter mock of
  his trouble? Not if his life depended on it! He much preferred to let her
  believe him a dangerous outlaw; at least, she would fear to crowd his temper
  too far, he thought. She would know that he was not to be trifled with; the
  way he had sent that bullet through her hat would prove that he was a man who
  could and would make war on any one who showed himself an enemy, and though
  she might hate him she could not despise him&mdash;as she would be sure to do
  if she knew the sordid facts.</p>

  <p>And as if she had read a part of the thoughts shuttling through his mind,
  Dorothy straightway demonstrated how little she feared him.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he won't tell you why he left home. You shouldn't expect that,
  Mom. I suppose he thinks we're afraid of him, with that murderous scowl on
  his face. But nobody cares how many notches he has on his gun, or who he's
  planning to bump off next."</p>

  <p>"Dorthy! Shame on you, deviling the boy when he's hurt and can't fight
  back!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can fight back, any time I want to," Cole glowered. "I haven't so
  many notches on my gun but what there's room for one more, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Meaning me?" Dorothy looked straight at him, and the imp of mischief was
  in her eyes. "I thought you said once you couldn't shoot a woman."</p>

  <p>"A fellow can always change his mind," Cole retorted. "But it happens that
  I meant Roper."</p>

  <p>"My conscience, I wish you two would stop wrangling! Cole, you better go
  to bed and let me rub your shoulder again with Three H. You can't expect to
  do anything very bloodthirsty while you're going around with a kinked neck,
  so the sooner you get over it, the quicker you can start in being bad."</p>

  <p>Cole sent her a suspicious, sidelong glance. The ironical note in her
  voice seemed to imply that she did not after all consider him altogether
  inimical to the peace and well-being of his fellow men, but her eyes met his
  innocently enough. Then she laughed a little, and Cole's mouth relaxed to a
  sheepish grin.</p>

  <p>"I'm not bloodthirsty and I'm not bad when I'm left alone," he blurted
  impulsively, instantly disarmed by her silent acceptance of his sincerity. "I
  marked out the brands on my horses because I wanted to, but they're mine just
  the same. If I shot anybody, I sure didn't know it, but I wasn't going to let
  Roper get hold of me if I could help it, and I don't see what I could do but
  fight back. I don't back down an inch from Roper or anybody else, but as you
  say, a fellow with a kinked neck hasn't any business to go on the
  warpath."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll let things stand that way," Mother Harris agreed, with a sigh
  of relief. "I can't hardly believe you're an outlaw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With that dimple in his chin? Well, hardly!"</p>

  <p>"Dorthy, you stop pestering him! No matter who you are or what you've done
  or ain't done, Cole, you're going right straight to bed, and let me give that
  neck and shoulder another good rubbing with liniment."</p>

  <p>And Cole, because she had a look and a way that reminded him of his
  mother, did as he was told.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; STEVE HARRIS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR days the kitchen and little side bedroom were odorous of
  liniment, and Cole Lawson of the tarnished reputation moved as if he were
  strapped to a board. His eyeballs were sore from rolling unnaturally so that
  he could look up under his brows or obliquely to one side or the other, and
  his face wore a permanent scowl. Had he broken a leg or been shot through the
  middle he could not have been more uncomfortable, and he would have felt that
  at least his injury was one to command respect, but a crick in the neck
  merely gave him the ludicrous appearance of a wise old crow perched somewhere
  with a speculative eye upon a cornfield. He tried to dismiss the ailment as a
  matter of no moment, but it would not be ignored; and though he reeked of
  liniment and hops steeped in vinegar, the strained tendons remained obdurate,
  protesting against movement with agonizing, white-hot streaks of pain that
  gave him long moments of nausea. As for riding that was simply out of the
  question.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Cole, it'll quit just as sudden as it started in," Mother
  Harris reiterated comfortingly, but she neglected to set any time for the
  miracle of recovery and Cole was not cheered.</p>

  <p>"We had a horse with a kinked neck once," Dorothy volunteered for his
  information. "Glory, he was like a comic valentine! Don't you remember, Mom?
  We turned him out to pasture and he was that way all summer. He had to kneel
  down to eat grass, and just as the kink began to ease up so he could move his
  head a little, he up and died of starvation or something. He was so skinny
  the coyotes wouldn't look at him. They thought he was a last year's
  carcass."</p>

  <p>"Dorthy! What makes you act so? You know better than that. Old Jerry died
  of something else."</p>

  <p>"Well, Billy the Kid isn't likely to starve, at any rate; not unless he
  gets a crick in his elbow."</p>

  <p>She called him that to his face now, and wordy wars waged fiercely over
  Mother Harris' head, in spite of her expostulations that were more than half
  sincere.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to take Dorthy at her word, Cole," she told him, after
  three days of mental and physical torment. "She just does it to tease, more
  'n anything else. You been worrying about your sick horse over at Looey's
  camp, and she'd die, I expect, before she'd tell you she's been riding over
  there every day and packing hay to him. She says he's pickin' up real fast
  too, on them oats, and to-day she's going to try and get him over here for a
  su'prise when you're able to ride. But don't let on I told you, Cole. Just
  let her think you don't suspicion a thing about it. She'd be awful mad if she
  found out I'd put you next&mdash;but girls don't realize how a young fellow
  feels about his horses. Like a cat with a mouse; they don't mean nothing much
  by it, but it hurts just the same."</p>

  <p>Naturally, that helped Cole considerably in his feelings toward Dorothy,
  but his manner did not change and her bullying continued without respite.
  Cole used to sit with the hop poultices bound on the back of his neck and the
  vinegar trickling down his spine, and ponder over Dorothy's briary manner
  toward him. Not that it mattered in the least; but no girl had ever treated
  him like that, and he wondered why she held the grudge so inflexibly against
  him. Surely, he thought again and again, she had paid him off that first day
  for the mistake he had made in trying to shoot her. She knew he thought she
  was trying to steal his horses, and she must know he had every reason for
  thinking so.</p>

  <p>Did she treat him so because she believed him an outlaw&mdash;because he
  had inadvertently wounded her stepbrother? Cole did not quite believe that.
  Dorothy had not shown any love for Steve, and she did not betray any great
  sympathy for him now. She had remarked to her mother, in Cole's hearing, that
  Steve had it coming to him&mdash;but whether she referred to the shooting or
  to the financial embarrassment, Cole did not know. And why, if she really
  felt a deep and lasting contempt for Cole as an outlaw, did she openly gibe
  at him and call him Billy the Kid? Outlaws weren't bantered in that way. At
  least Cole had never heard of one that was.</p>

  <p>He was sitting in the kitchen staring intently at a knot in the floor
  while Mother Harris varied her poultice treatment with a liniment massage,
  when the door opened and a man walked in without ceremony. Cole could not
  lift his head, but he saw the fellow's run-over boots and the big-roweled
  spurs with worn straps stamped with a horse's head. The rowels were clotted
  with blood and hair, and Cole's gorge rose at the telltale sign. No
  cowpuncher on the C Bar L would have lasted long on the payroll after spurs
  in that condition were seen on his heels. They reminded Cole of a certain
  rider who had been given his time and a thrashing for good measure for
  showing spurs less stained than these.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;hello, Steve!" Mother Harris's fingers tightened unconsciously
  on Cole's neck in a way that brought a grunt of pain. She never noticed it.
  That, to Cole, meant more than tears.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I thought you was sick in the hospital," she wavered, after a
  two-second silence. "John Roper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, and a hell of a lot you cared whether I died or not! I coulda
  rotted, for all you. I was broke and sick and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You got well mighty fast, seems to me," Mother Harris said pointedly,
  gathering her courage together. "There, I guess that'll do now, Cole. You
  better go back and lie down a while and let the liniment soak in before I put
  on another poultice."</p>

  <p>Cole knew he was dismissed from what promised to be a family row. He went,
  because he was useless as a protector&mdash;granted she needed protection
  from her own stepson&mdash;and his presence could only mean
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil's that?" Steve demanded, before Cole had the bedroom door
  closed. "Cole, eh? Fellow that put a bullet through me, I'll bet! And you're
  harborin' him, eh? And you wouldn't send me a red cent when I needed it,
  you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, Steve, look here! Don't you go callin' names, or I'll tell you a few
  things you won't like to hear. You sent word out here you wanted fifty
  dollars and you had to have it, and I sent word back that I didn't have it.
  You know I didn't, and <i>you know why</i>. I didn't have it, because you
  took every cent I had in the house when you went off with the sickle
  bar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never took what you got buried! You think I ain't wise to
  you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I've got buried!" Her voice rose with the bitterness welling up
  within her at the charge. "What I've got buried is a husband and a son, Steve
  Harris, that would kick you off this ranch for the way you've acted since
  your father died. What I've got buried! I wish to God I <i>could</i> call
  them back!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;you can ying-yang about the son that's dead, and let the one
  that's livin' lay and starve, for all you care! You can harbor that damn
  skunk that shot me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He couldn't have shot you very bad, Steve, the way you hit for home the
  minute you found out you wouldn't get any money out of me. John said you was
  flat on your back in the hospital and was going to have an operation. That
  was four days ago, and here you are, looking just as hearty and strong as if
  you'd never been sick! I don't believe you was so much as scratched! You just
  put up a pitiful story to try and get more money outa me!"</p>

  <p>"There! What do yuh call that, then?" Steve twitched his neckerchief loose
  and showed a purplish red scar on the fleshy side of his neck.</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm! Laid you out, did it? Maybe it did for a minute or two, but it
  never put you in the hospital overnight. You can't pull the wool over my eyes
  that way, Steve Harris. I knew there was a false ring to John Roper's talk,
  and I'm su'prised that he should come here and lie for you."</p>

  <p>"He didn't lie. I need fifty dollars, and I'm goin' to have it too."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know how you're going to get it, Steve, after robbing me of
  what I had saved up to buy hay for winter. You went off with over
  seventy-five dollars of my money. I ain't told Dorthy yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't you? It was my money, same as this ranch is mine. I got
  the same right here that you have. You claim the hull works&mdash;the ranch,
  and every damn thing on it. I'm here to tell yuh I ain't goin' to stand for
  much more. I'm goin' to get mad some of these days, and then you'll see the
  fur fly!"</p>

  <p>"Something else is goin' to fly before then, Steve Harris, and that's you.
  I never thought the day would come when I'd turn against one of Dorthy's
  father's flesh and blood, but if he was standin' here in this kitchen right
  this minute, he'd say it for me, and back up his words with a gun, if
  necessary. You leave this house and this ranch, Steve Harris, and don't you
  ever darken my door again!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, to hell with you and your door!" Before her righteous wrath Steve
  quailed, nevertheless, and went out and slammed the door with such savage
  violence that the whole house shook.</p>

  <p>She stood at the window and watched him go, her vision blurred with tears
  at the tragedy of having to drive from the house her beloved mate's own son,
  for whom he had planned and worked in the full hope that Steve would be a
  comfort in their old age. A comfort! She wiped her eyes and turned away to
  fix the poultice for Cole's neck, and saw him standing in the doorway,
  looking at her with big, somber eyes that at last had lost their veil of
  aloofness and distrust.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry about the money, or Steve either," he said, as he
  shuffled over to lay a comforting arm across her shoulder. "I've got some you
  can use to buy hay with. I wanted to do it anyway, for the way you've
  doctored me and fussed over me. And I'll help you with the work, just as soon
  as this darn kink gets straightened out of my neck. Let Steve go, and forget
  about him. We'll make out all right&mdash;and you needn't worry about the
  wages, either. I haven't got a soul in the world but myself and my horses to
  look after&mdash;and Mutt, if he sticks with me&mdash;and I'd be tickled to
  death to help you get ready for winter."</p>

  <p>Mother Harris looked up at him, blinked and tried to smile&mdash;and all
  at once she found herself crying with her face against Cole's well shoulder
  and Cole's hand patting her on the back.</p>

  <p>They were standing so when Dorothy walked into the kitchen, with her quirt
  dangling on her wrist and her big sombrero swinging by its rubber band.
  Dorothy stopped and stared.</p>

  <p>"Well! Shoot the daughter and make love to the old lady!" she commented
  dryly, after her first gasp of astonishment. "Billy the Kid, you sure do go
  some. What's the matter, Mom? Is it Steve again? I saw him riding off as I
  came up."</p>

  <p>"It's Steve&mdash;never no more," Cole answered her because Mother Harris
  could not speak. "I'm adopted and I'm going to call her Mother after this,
  and you better stop calling me Billy the Kid. Mother wants me treated with
  all due respect and some little kindness, if possible."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that so!" A weak retort which proved a whirling brain.</p>

  <p>"I've forbid Steve&mdash;the house," Mother Harris explained between
  sobs.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's about time," Dorothy made brief comment.</p>

  <p>"It was the last&mdash;straw&mdash;the way he&mdash;talked to me. Your
  father would&mdash;have&mdash;turned in his grave to hear it.
  And&mdash;Cole&mdash;has offered to stay and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I hope you never start in trying to trade horses for a living, Mom,"
  Dorothy observed with seeming irrelevance. "Well, I guess you fixed Steve
  aplenty. He went off talking to himself, and he wouldn't speak to me when I
  met him in the trail. Better hide Billy the Kid's six-gun, Mom, and hobble
  him to the table leg, meal times, so I'll dare stay on the same ranch with
  him."</p>

  <p>Cole astonished himself by laughing aloud, and after a surprised look at
  him Dorothy laughed also, with a little, impudent grimace to which Cole
  retaliated with one lower eyelid. So a truce was silently declared over Mom's
  shoulder that had borne the brunt of their bickerings, and Cole began to
  think that maybe the world was not so sordid and unfriendly a place, after
  all.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; TRAPPED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LIFE began to assume a normal, kindly aspect for Cole who
  had believed himself thoroughly embittered against it. He found himself
  speaking to Dorothy almost as freely as he talked with her mother, and could
  take her gibes in the spirit she gave them, without resentment, but flinging
  back a retort in kind; like two pups flying suddenly at each other's throats
  and making a great pretense of savage battle, or boys who clinch and go down
  in a tangle of straining arms and legs in a friendly wrestling match. Dorothy
  still called him Billy the Kid, but Cole no longer minded the sinister title.
  He dubbed her Cactus Carrie instead, and made it plain Cack for short and to
  further infuriate her.</p>

  <p>Even Mutt approved of the new domicile and foreswore his long nocturnal
  hunting expeditions, putting meat on his ribs while he lay in the shade of
  the cottonwoods and cracked bones in his teeth; a lazy life for Mutt, these
  days; a life of full-fed idleness, his most arduous task the driving of
  marauding leghorns out of the tomato patch.</p>

  <p>Eagle arrived on the third day after Steve's short visit, and with him
  came all of Cole's belongings which Dorothy declared were being devoured by
  rats. So Cole was installed in Steve's room, and Steve's things were packed
  and put in the storeroom, ready to be delivered on short notice to any
  messenger Steve might send.</p>

  <p>"He won't come after 'em himself," Mother Harris grimly predicted. "I
  guess I settled him, once and for all." And after that she went away and
  cried over the sorrow and disappointment he had caused her.</p>

  <p>The one thing that did not seem to right itself was Cole's kinked neck,
  and that defied the homely remedies applied by Mother Harris. The shoulder
  muscles improved somewhat, however, and Cole could walk to the corral and
  back without suffering tortures afterward. But as for working, that was out
  of the question; for the time being, Cole remained what Billy Parrish would
  have called a star boarder. His offer to help was as yet an empty
  promise.</p>

  <p>That irked him. It left too much time for thinking, and his thoughts, in
  spite of the friendly atmosphere which surrounded him, were not always
  pleasant. For one thing, he felt as if he ought to tell Mrs. Harris the truth
  about himself. He knew she must wonder why he didn't; he wondered himself,
  the times he was left alone while she and Dorothy were busy with the chores,
  doing a man's tasks while he sat idle with his back against a hop-stained
  pillow.</p>

  <p>He ought to tell the whole story; about his mother, the C Bar L, his
  father's mysteriously unfortunate business entanglements, his sudden crash
  from apparent wealth to bankruptcy&mdash;and then the tragic end of it all.
  They had believed him, these two, when he said he was no thief; they must
  have believed him, or they would not be so willing to let him stay and help
  with the heavy work. After that night of Roper's visit they had avoided the
  subject, save when Dorothy teased him with the name of outlaw&mdash;and
  thereby proved how little she thought him one&mdash;but he knew that the
  mystery of him must nag at their minds. Mother Harris at least was entitled
  to know.</p>

  <p>At night, when he lay awake and thought of all that had happened in the
  last month, and of the goodness of Mrs. Harris&mdash;yes, and of Dorothy
  since the truce&mdash;he would promise himself that in the morning he would
  tell her, perhaps while Dorothy was driving the cows back to pasture. It
  wouldn't take long. He even composed the sentences he meant to speak. He knew
  just how long it would take. He would say:</p>

  <p>"Mother Harris, I'm going to tell you who I am. The reason I haven't told
  you before is because I can't stand having it talked about, but there's
  nothing I've done to put me here among strangers. I blotted the brands on my
  horses because I didn't want any one to know I'm from the C Bar L. My name is
  Cole Lawson, and my father&mdash;&mdash;" Yes, he would tell her the whole
  truth, but it would not be easy from there on.</p>

  <p>It was so hard that for days he procrastinated. He would wait until after
  breakfast, because he didn't want to have her look at him across the table
  with the story fresh in her mind and her pity for him shining in her eyes.
  No, he would wait until she was rubbing his neck. She would be standing
  behind him then, and he would not see her face at all. No, she was talking
  about all the work there was to be done before cold weather; how the cow
  stable must be banked higher on the north and west sides, and more dirt piled
  on the roof, because the cows would fall off in their milk if they were not
  warm enough; how the winter's wood must be hauled down out of the canyon; how
  the hay must be bought and hauled from Miller's place, because it cost three
  dollars more a ton if they delivered it; how a dozen things must be done.</p>

  <p>Another day it was the same. The hours slipped away while he held the
  first sentence behind his lips, ready for speech but waiting upon his
  aversion for the subject. It would not be the same, after he had told. They
  would know he had been accustomed all his life to better things than they
  could afford&mdash;Dorothy had already flung at him some gibe for the clothes
  he wore&mdash;and they would be conscious of their poverty. They would think
  about it, maybe speak of it unthinkingly. They accepted him now, and they
  could do no more if they knew. It would sound as if he were making a bid for
  their pity, and that was the last thing he wanted.</p>

  <p>So he did not tell. Like the subject of Steve, which they left alone by
  common consent after his room had been emptied of his belongings, Roper's
  story lay in the background of their minds. They did not accept his statement
  that Roper was a villain; they had known Roper too long for that. But they
  did not attempt to argue about it, and Cole found it easier and easier to let
  things remain as they were, tacitly taboo.</p>

  <p>Later he wondered whether he had been wise to keep silence.</p>

  <p>It was on the sixth day, with a haze in the air that sent the far hills
  swimming in elusive lights and shadows, and with a languorous hint of coming
  autumn in the warm breeze that blew up from the southwest in little vagrant
  gusts that fanned one pleasantly upon the face and passed on. Cole had walked
  slowly and deliberately down to the corral to see how Eagle was coming along.
  The other horses were in the pasture and Mutt was asleep somewhere. Dorothy
  had ridden over to Miller's with the ten pounds of butter delivered every
  week, and Mother Harris was churning in the milk house; a task which Cole had
  attempted to perform and couldn't because of the jar of the dasher which felt
  like a hot hammer pounding upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>A couple of horsemen came riding quietly up the trail from Catrock, and
  when they saw Cole standing beside the corral they separated, one coming up
  on either side of him. It was Eagle that warned him of their approach, and he
  turned just in time to see Steve Harris nod and point, and the other man pull
  a gun.</p>

  <p>"That's him," said Steve, pulling up his horse and glowering at Cole.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Cole, with his head tilted to one side and his neck
  bandaged, was not a formidable looking foe, and he knew it and lifted his lip
  in a sneer.</p>

  <p>"You. I'm a deputy sheriff, and you're wanted for shootin' with intent to
  kill; murderous assault on Steve Harris. Don't yuh try any tricks&mdash;I
  know all about yuh and I won't take any chances. Put up your hands&mdash;and
  Steve, you better see if he's packin' a gun."</p>

  <p>Even then Cole's predicament did not impinge itself upon his senses. Steve
  was not hurt; the bullet had no more than scratched deeply the side of his
  neck, according to Mother Harris, who had seen the scar. That he would ever
  have to face more than Steve's personal animosity had never occurred to Cole,
  for in his experience the law was not called upon unless men's quarrels were
  more serious than this.</p>

  <p>It flashed across his mind that this was not a bona fide officer making a
  legal arrest, but some crony of Steve's who was playing the part for some
  sinister purpose of their own; to get him away from the ranch without
  interference, most likely, for Steve must know that the two women were
  capable of making him trouble if he roused them sufficiently. Steve would not
  dare start trouble with Cole at the ranch. He would not want Mother Harris to
  know about it.</p>

  <p>"You can't run any bluff on me," Cole said contemptuously. "If you're an
  officer and want me, you must have a warrant."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I've got a warrant! You can see it when we get that gun you're so
  damn free with. Take it off him, Steve. If he makes a crooked move, I'll lay
  him out."</p>

  <p>They had all the best of it, for it happened that Cole's gun was at the
  house. Steve came up and made certain he was unarmed, and the deputy
  thereupon produced the warrant and gave it to Cole. He read it with a growing
  sense of incredulous fury. He had never before seen a warrant of arrest, but
  there was no mistaking the authenticity of this document. He was named as
  John Doe, but for the rest it was terribly explicit.</p>

  <p>Cole was appalled, stunned by the unexpectedness of it.</p>

  <p>He was trapped; there was no choice for him, unless he could fight, and if
  he even attempted that he would be killed for resisting arrest.</p>

  <p>Steve was already carrying his saddle over from the shed, in haste to be
  gone before the women came to upbraid him.</p>

  <p>"Better take him down the trail, Joe," he growled, and glanced uneasily at
  the house. "I'll bring his horse."</p>

  <p>So, because he was at their mercy, Cole walked down the trail ahead of the
  deputy and his gun. Handcuffs gripped his wrists&mdash;they had seen to that
  without any delay. As Joe had observed, they were taking no chances.
  Presently Steve rode down to overtake them, leading Eagle by the bridle
  reins. They waited grimly while Cole mounted, and they herded him between
  them as if he were some dangerous criminal.</p>

  <p>With his manacled hands clasped over the saddle horn and every hoofbeat
  marking time to the agony that racked his body, Cole rode away in that sleepy
  sunlight. He was poignantly aware of Mother Harris in the milk house humming
  an old-fashioned love song while she sent the dasher up and down, up and down
  with a muffled plop when it struck the rich cream in the stone churn; of
  Mutt, lying asleep in the shade near the spring, where the ground was moist
  and cool and he had scratched a comfortable hollow for himself; of the ducks
  waddling in and out of the spring creek just above the stable, flirting their
  wings and gossiping among themselves; of the horses down in the pasture; of
  Dorothy galloping home from Miller's&mdash;but not along this trail&mdash;and
  of the mystery, perhaps the worry of his unaccountable absence. What would
  they think of him?</p>

  <p>And then the sickening answer that struck him like a blow. They would
  think that he had lied about himself, and that he had taken sudden alarm and
  gone hurrying away to escape capture for some crime that dogged his
  footsteps. They would think that he had not dared take the time to get the
  other horses, but had saddled Eagle and fled from whatever it was that
  threatened him.</p>

  <p>They would assume then that he had lied about Roper also; that he had
  wormed himself into their confidence for sake of the security of that lonely
  little ranch tucked back against the hills. How could they know or suspect
  the truth? If Steve had watched the place, he could not have selected a
  better time for taking Cole secretly away. He remembered now that they had
  held their voices down; Steve must have known Mother Harris was churning,
  that Dorothy had ridden away from the ranch. He must have waited until he saw
  Cole walk down to the corral.</p>

  <p>They rode swiftly, as if they feared some awkward meeting on the trail.
  They did not speak, and Cole was thankful for that. He did not want them to
  guess that he was riding with his teeth clenched, holding back any expression
  of the agony of that ride. And there was Eagle with his newly healed
  shoulder&mdash;he must be suffering too, thought Cole. Eagle was gamely
  keeping up with the other horses, but Cole could feel the effort it cost him
  and he added that item to the black list against Steve and Roper (who was
  probably cognizant of this particular exploit) and the town where they were
  taking him.</p>

  <p>So once again Cole felt himself slipping back into the darkness of a
  smoldering fury against circumstances that seemed malignly intent upon
  destroying him body and soul. He steeled himself against whatever might lie
  ahead of him, and set himself the hard task of endurance. It was all that he
  could do.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; "THAT WORD'S GUILTY"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, young fella, I see you've been getting yourself into
  a little trouble. No business of mine&mdash;my job is to keep you safe and
  sound till the judge has his say. But maybe I can give you a little advice
  that will help out. I've had a good many men put in my care, and every one of
  'em could tell you I stood ready to help where I could."</p>

  <p>This was the sheriff speaking. He reminded Cole a little of big Ed Carroll
  of the Black Rim; twinkling blue eyes that seemed to miss nothing, a
  passionless, imperturbable face that masked whatever emotions filled his
  soul, and a big body capable of putting forth considerable brute strength
  when occasion demanded. He had brought a weekly paper and a package of
  cigarettes and apparently these were meant to pave the way to acquaintance
  with his new prisoner. At least Cole suspected it and refused to meet the
  friendly overtures.</p>

  <p>"You run against a mean proposition when you tackled Steve Harris," the
  sheriff went on, after a pause spent in picking his teeth and sizing up Cole
  through half-closed lids. "He's goin' to put you over the road if he can.
  What's the matter? Boil on your neck?"</p>

  <p>"Sprained it," Cole answered him shortly.</p>

  <p>"When? Last night?"</p>

  <p>"No. Week or so ago. Wind caught me with a pitchfork of hay in the
  air."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Thought maybe Steve had something to do with it. I'll have a
  doctor take a look at it. You look bad, and that's a fact. What happened to
  your wrist?"</p>

  <p>"Bullet went through the flesh." There was no use in trying to hide the
  puckered scar, and Cole slipped back his sleeve for a better view.</p>

  <p>"Steve?"</p>

  <p>"Steve or one of the others. There were three of them."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Steve has got two witnesses in town ready to take the stand and
  swear you rode up and shot Steve without cause or provocation."</p>

  <p>"That's a damned lie," grated Cole. "They were trying to stop me. Pulled
  up in the trail, and one of them hollered at me to stop."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Them was the Griswold boys, Ben and Tike. Know 'em?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know anybody around here. I'm a stranger."</p>

  <p>"Where from?"</p>

  <p>Silence. Then, "Points west," said Cole shortly, as he had done once
  before.</p>

  <p>"Never was there, but I've heard of the place," said the sheriff, and
  Cole's quick glance from under his eyebrows could not determine whether the
  sheriff was joking or in earnest. "What was the rush?" He went on with his
  quizzing. "That night, I mean."</p>

  <p>"I was getting away from Roper."</p>

  <p>"John Roper?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." This was getting close to something Cole had not meant to tell, but
  the sheriff had a mild way of waiting for his answers which seemed to pull
  them forth from Cole's lips almost as if the sheriff dragged them out with a
  string. It was, too, like starting down a steep incline and not being able to
  stop. Cole did not know where the terrifically simple questions would lead
  him. He felt as if the sheriff read the truth before it was uttered; as if
  his words merely confirmed what the sheriff already knew. Cole had never, you
  see, been questioned by one who is accustomed to dragging the truth from
  criminals, and the method was new to him.</p>

  <p>"What had Roper done to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. It was what he was trying to do."</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cole with measured calm, "I heard him talking about bumping
  me off. He said those were four good horses I had."</p>

  <p>"Where was that?"</p>

  <p>"That was down in what he called the Sinks?"</p>

  <p>"What were <i>you</i> doing in the Sinks?"</p>

  <p>"I was going with Roper and Pete. Roper hired me to help him get back a
  bunch of horses he said were stole from him. He said it was ticklish work and
  he might have trouble. He said he couldn't go to law about it, because the
  sheriff was in cahoots. He would pay me a hundred dollars, he said, and it
  wouldn't last longer than a month."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. When did you hear this talk about bumping you?"</p>

  <p>"In the Sinks. It was dark and my horse took up the wrong side of one of
  those edges of rock that stick up narrow and high like chicken combs all
  over, every which way."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. That's the Sinks, all right. You say your horse took the wrong
  side?"</p>

  <p>"They went up one way and my horse took up along the rock on the other
  side. I missed them and was waiting to see if they would come along, and I
  heard them talking. There was a wide crack in the rocks there and the sound
  came through plain. They were going back to look for me. Roper said the
  farther they got me in the Sinks the better."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I waited all night and all the next day. The wind was blowing so hard my
  tracks were covered, and the horses were in a niche out of sight. At dusk I
  took a chance, and my horse Johnnie led me out."</p>

  <p>"That's when you run across Steve and the Griswold boys?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was up on top of the ledge that day, and Pete and Roper came along
  past. I guess their side of the rock was the trail home. I heard them again.
  Roper said Jim would see me with the glasses&mdash;that's why I waited till
  it was too dark for him."</p>

  <p>"You thought Steve's bunch was some of Roper's men?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They swung across the road. One of them did. I commenced to shoot
  and ride straight for them. They got one of my horses in the shoulder and me
  in the wrist, but I made it away from there all right."</p>

  <p>"You think now that you made a mistake, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Cole after a minute, "I do. But Roper and Steve are pretty
  thick, just the same. He sent Roper to Mrs. Harris for money, and Roper lied.
  He told her Steve was in the hospital and needed an operation. He said Steve
  was shot through the body."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. But you don't think Steve was after you that night."</p>

  <p>"No-o&mdash;I think he was just riding along and I happened to meet him
  and the rest."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. That's what I think too, kid. But Steve is sore at you. Know
  why?" He put the toothpick away in his vest pocket and made a final polishing
  of his teeth with his tongue. "Beyond that little furrow in his neck, which
  don't amount to much, what other reason has he got for being down on
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Unless it was because he found me there when he went home.
  He had trouble with Mrs. Harris and she turned him out; told him to beat it.
  And," Cole added with dangerous frankness, "Roper told him I was an outlaw, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because my horses have all got blotted brands. I don't know any other
  reason."</p>

  <p>"All of them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I marked out the brands myself. I had a right to. They're my
  horses."</p>

  <p>"What was wrong with their brands?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I got tired of looking at them, is all."</p>

  <p>"Steve says he's goin' to put you in the pen. If not for the shootin',
  then he'll bring a charge of horse stealin'."</p>

  <p>"How? They're my horses, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"How, ain't my job, kid." The sheriff got out his pipe and knocked the
  dottle free against a bar of the door. "No, that ain't my job, but keepin'
  the country free of criminals is&mdash;as far as my power goes.</p>

  <p>"Now, take your case here. You ain't got a ghost of a show before a jury.
  Steve grew up in the country, and he's got friends&mdash;naturally. The
  Griswold boys are pretty wild, but they're all right, so far as takin' their
  word in court goes. You admit you rode up out of the Sinks, met them three in
  the trail and wouldn't stop when they called. Maybe they thought they knew
  you. They can say they did, and who's goin' to read their minds? Now, say
  they do testify to that. You start shootin'. You've got four horses with yuh,
  and they've all got blotched brands. How's that goin' ta look to a jury?</p>

  <p>"Now, say you get five years in the pen. Old Judge Bailey don't hardly
  ever give less 'n that. You <i>could</i> get <i>ten</i>&mdash;all depends on
  what the charge is and how black they paint yuh. You go up there and herd
  with criminals. You're&mdash;twenty? twenty-one?&mdash;just a kid. You ain't
  old enough to be hard, but you will be when you git out. You'll come out on
  the fight, if I know your stripe. You'll blame the law and you'll be an enemy
  of the law from the first jump. In all probability, you'll have it in your
  head to get the one that put you in jail. I've seen it work out time and
  again; I've been a peace officer for over fifteen years, and I've yet to see
  the kid that come back better than when he went in. If a fella ain't a
  criminal when he goes, you can gamble almost that he'll be one when he comes
  out. If he thinks he didn't get a square deal, he's almost sure to come back
  ready to break the law."</p>

  <p>"I haven't broken any laws so far," Cole said sullenly. "A man's got a
  right to defend his own life and property."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Sure he has. I'm talkin' about what will get before a jury, and
  what the jury'll say and the judge'll say. Your case goes to a jury; you
  ain't got a Chinaman's chance of getting an acquittal."</p>

  <p>"I can't help that, can I?"</p>

  <p>"Now that's just what I'm comin' to, kid. You can help it in this way, and
  it's the <i>only</i> way. You can plead guilty to this charge of shootin'
  with intent to do bodily injury. That'll get you a light sentence right here
  in the county jail, and it'll head off anything in the nature of a frame-up
  to send you up for five or ten years. See the difference?</p>

  <p>"You'll be savin' the county money too. You plead not guilty and stand
  trial, and the county's got to spend money to prosecute the case. That won't
  get you anything but a longer sentence in a darn sight worse jail. It'll get
  in the papers, and if you've got friends over at Points West, they're liable
  to hear about it. You better plead guilty, kid, and take the easy job and be
  done with it." He puffed at his pipe, got up and walked to the barred door
  which he had locked behind him, and looked out as if he were expecting some
  one. But perhaps he was only giving Cole time to think. For in a minute or
  two he turned and came back to the iron cot where Cole sat staring gloomily
  at the stone floor.</p>

  <p>"Does Roper know you heard him talkin' about you, that time in the
  Sinks?"</p>

  <p>"No. If he'd known I was anywhere around there I wouldn't have lasted
  long."</p>

  <p>"The boys don't know why you started shootin' at 'em, then?"</p>

  <p>"No-o, I guess not. I don't see how they could, except that they tried to
  stop me."</p>

  <p>"That'd look as if you was on the dodge and takin' no chance with
  strangers. Who all have you told? About Roper, I mean."</p>

  <p>"I told Mrs. Harris and her daughter. They didn't believe it."</p>

  <p>"Think they'll repeat it to anybody?"</p>

  <p>Cole did not know, but he was inclined to the belief that they would not
  discuss him any more than was necessary. They would be afraid of doing him a
  harm.</p>

  <p>"I guess they don't gossip," he said. "They think Roper is all right."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Well, they ain't alone in that, so you'd best not tell anybody
  else what you told me. Don't tell <i>nobody</i>. Keep all that behind your
  teeth, no matter what happens, till I give you the word to talk. I won't,
  while this Steve case is up for settlement. You could only hurt yourself, and
  do nobody else any harm. You get that? Leave Roper out of it. <i>Don't
  talk.</i></p>

  <p>"Now, when you go before Judge May for your preliminary hearing, plead
  guilty. I'll do what I can for yuh, kid&mdash;get you off with a light
  sentence. You didn't do much damage to Steve, so you won't get much. Just
  plead guilty and keep your face closed about everything. Will you do
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Cole, after a minute of rapid thought. "I don't know why
  you've gone to all this trouble about it, but I can see where you may be
  right, at that."</p>

  <p>"I am right," said the sheriff softly. "I'm righter than you know. I ain't
  been sheriff for fifteen years without havin' my wisdom teeth cut. You don't
  know all the ins and outs of this case, you see. All you've got is your own
  personal angle of it.</p>

  <p>"Now, look upon me as your friend, kid, but don't act like I am. When you
  go to court, I mean. One word is all I want you to say, and that word's
  <i>guilty</i>. Get that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes-s&mdash;" But Cole hesitated, turning his body slantwise so that he
  could look up at the other towering above him. "Roper didn't give you a very
  good recommend, so I guess you're all right. Anyway, I'm up against it. Yes,
  I never denied shooting Steve, so I'll plead guilty."</p>

  <p>"What I don't want," said the sheriff, leaning over him to whisper it, "is
  for you to start explainin' <i>why</i> you done it. They can't go back of
  that plea, to drag anything out of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You sure have," Cole suddenly charged him. "I wasn't going to talk to
  you, either&mdash;but I did."</p>

  <p>The sheriff chuckled so that his sides shook, but a man outside the barred
  door would not have heard him laughing.</p>

  <p>"Sure, you talked. But don't yuh talk to anybody else that way. Now, I'm
  going to bring a doctor over to look at that neck. You won't have your
  hearing before this afternoon."</p>

  <p>He went away, and Cole somehow felt comforted in spite of the stone walls
  and iron bars that shut him in.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; NINETY DAYS AND DESPAIR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, you got off pretty lucky, after all. Ninety days
  beats five years considerable." Sheriff Saunders unlocked the jail door and
  signed Cole to enter first.</p>

  <p>Cole stopped in the doorway and cast one long glance behind him at the
  wooded hills which rose beyond the town of Crater. The sun was shining warmly
  down into the narrow valley, the breeze carried the faint odor of hemlock and
  spruce and pine. Somewhere back in a narrow lane that led to the hills a
  burro set up a raucous braying that reminded him of the Wop's lugubrious
  plaint. Ninety days, and the snow would be falling into those purple canyons
  up there; ninety days&mdash;and the Harris stable not banked to the eaves,
  the wood not hauled down for the winter, nothing done save what two pairs of
  woman hands could perform; ninety days of cooped inaction like a coyote in a
  cage; ninety eternities! Cole stepped over the doorsill and started down the
  short, narrow corridor, past the place where heavy leg irons, with chains
  running up to an iron belt, hung on the wall beside other appurtenances that
  smacked of old horrors but were manifestly intended for use in quelling
  recalcitrant prisoners. Ninety days of it&mdash;for Cole Lawson, a month ago
  the young autocrat of the C Bar L!</p>

  <p>"Not that way, kid. You go in here, right next the office, where I can
  keep an eye on you."</p>

  <p>Cole turned obediently, dully indifferent to his quarters, and walked into
  a cell such as he had read about but had never before seen; not so bad a
  place unless one were locked into it, he thought, as he gave an apathetic
  glance at the meager furnishings. Saunders locked the door and stood looking
  speculatively in at him through the bars, studying Cole's face with a curious
  intentness for a man who has seen prisoners of all sorts and sizes and
  condition come and go for fifteen years and longer.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, Cole. Somebody's comin' you'll maybe be glad to see. Be here
  to-night, maybe. How's your neck?"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;better, anyway." Cole walked over and sat down heavily on
  the cot, his face going into his two palms in the posture of complete
  dejection. "I don't want to see anybody," he added without looking up. "All I
  want is to be left alone."</p>

  <p>"You'll get over that," was the sheriff's philosophical remark as he
  walked away.</p>

  <p>Cole lay down on the bed and tried not to think. Thoughts came trooping
  up, whirling from this subject to that subject with a maddening irrelevance
  that somehow fitted into a sequence of such utter wretchedness that his very
  body seemed to feel the weight of despair.</p>

  <p>Who was coming?&mdash;Not Mother Harris&mdash;Dorothy wouldn't
  come&mdash;couldn't leave the ranch long enough&mdash;He wouldn't see them if
  they did come. Behind the bars&mdash;that was the ultimate
  disgrace&mdash;Mother always spoke those words solemnly. Steve and the
  Griswold boys had looked cheated. Roper&mdash;what was Roper doing
  there?&mdash;Pete too&mdash;ready to testify against him. Who was coming
  to-night?&mdash;Nobody he knew. He wouldn't see any one. They'd peek in
  through the bars. Why did the sheriff want to keep an eye on him?&mdash;Gene
  had gone to jail once&mdash;some fight or other. Ninety days&mdash;thank God
  the folks he knew wouldn't hear about it. And this was the way he was making
  his own way in the world! Fine start&mdash;ninety days in jail. What made the
  sheriff talk like that? Want to keep him out of the pen. Maybe he was a
  friend of Steve&mdash;no, he'd have&mdash;Who was coming? What did they want?
  What would become of his horses? He didn't want Mother Harris to feed them.
  How was Eagle? Maybe the sheriff would look after him. What would happen, now
  he was in jail? Would those blotched brands make his horses&mdash;would some
  one just take them and claim them? Roper wanted them. Who was coming? Nobody
  he wanted to see&mdash;maybe Billy Parrish. Yes, he'd like to tell Billy
  about it&mdash;Billy would know what to do. What a damned mess he'd made of
  things! Couldn't be Billy&mdash;nobody knew where he had gone. Just dropped
  out of the Black Rim. No way of tracing him&mdash;nobody would take the
  trouble, anyway. Who was coming to see him?</p>

  <p>Hour after hour, that question nagged at him, slipped into the front of
  his mind and pushed back other thoughts. Maybe it was Roper. But no, the
  sheriff had said it was some one he'd be glad to see. Cole could not think of
  any one on earth he wanted to see in that cell. He wanted to drop out of
  sight and out of memory until the ninety days were up, and then&mdash;well,
  then he did not know what he would do. He could not seem to look past the
  next three months. They stood before him a black wall that shut out the
  future, almost as final as the thing that had come to his father that day in
  the office room at the C Bar L; only, he could go on thinking, and his
  father's tired brain slept&mdash;he hoped.</p>

  <p>After a while some one began to sing a ribald ballad off key. Cole had not
  known there were other prisoners in the jail, and this evidence of
  companionship struck him unpleasantly. He would rather be alone. He dreaded
  even the return of the sheriff. Where was Joe, the surly deputy who had
  brought him here?</p>

  <p>Gloom deepened to black dark, and then a light snapped on in the corridor.
  It painted a checkered shadow on the floor of his cell, and Cole absently
  counted the squares. A blot slid across them, stopped and he heard the bar of
  his door lift and clang. It was his supper, but he did not want it. He wanted
  to be left alone. His jailer&mdash;not the sheriff, but a stranger&mdash;set
  a tray on the floor and slammed the door shut. The bar dropped, and presently
  he walked past whistling, with another tray held in one hand.</p>

  <p>"Here y' are, ole socks!" Cole heard him call good-naturedly to some one
  beyond. "And here's the magazine I was tellin' you about. Couldn't get hold
  of the one that had the first part of that story, but it's all explained so
  you can get the hang of it. How you fixed for the makin's? Huh? New feller?
  Oh, he got ninety days or a fine, and he wouldn't pay the
  fine&mdash;couldn't, maybe&mdash;so he's layin' it out. Steve was sore as
  hell; he wanted to send him up for a stretch. Kid beat him to it. Saunders
  put him in One, I guess, because he ain't right sure how he'll act.&mdash;I
  know, but he looks like a mean umbry. Wait till we size him up, and then
  maybe you can bunk in together."</p>

  <p>Back he came, whistling; looked in and saw Cole's tray untouched and stood
  irresolute.</p>

  <p>"Hey, your grub's gettin' cold," he cried buoyantly. "What the hell do you
  think I bring it hot for? Better throw it into yuh&mdash;I've got to take the
  dishes back in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Cole did not answer, and the fellow went on, resuming the whistled tune
  where he had left off.</p>

  <p>Silence. The checkered shadow on the floor. A dull throbbing at the base
  of his neck, where the doctor's fingers had probed mercilessly and with a
  final twinge of pain that had somehow relieved the stiffness. Who was coming?
  Maybe the sheriff just said that to give him hope. Maybe the sheriff was not
  so friendly as he had seemed. It might be Steve who was coming; or no one at
  all.</p>

  <p>Ages of that, with his thoughts ranging round and round the circumscribed
  bounds of his misfortunes. What had he done, that this thing should come upon
  him? No great wrong, surely. Nothing for which he should be punished like a
  malefactor.</p>

  <p>With his eyes mechanically tracing the squares of light on the floor, he
  retraced step by step his actions of the past month. He had started out to
  make his life over, among strangers; nothing in that to bring disaster upon
  him. That was one square. He had asked for work and been twitted about his
  dad&mdash;square two, and nothing there for which he could blame himself. So
  he went on to the blotting of the brands, to Roper and the ride into the
  Sinks, the long hours there and the ride out again. Any man would have done
  as he did, it seemed to him. And yet something must be wrong somewhere. Deep
  within his soul he sensed the inexorable law of cause and effect. The great
  law of compensation. It was there, it must be there&mdash;the cause. Somehow
  he had set in motion the law, and it had brought him here to this cell in the
  county jail of Crater.</p>

  <p>Round and round went his thoughts, seeking the answer to the puzzle. And
  then, quite suddenly, it came; or if it did not, at least the thought that
  struck him was illuminating and he sat dismayed before it.</p>

  <p>He had tried to dodge, to shirk consequences, back there at the C Bar L.
  He had not wanted to face his friends and live down the look in their eyes,
  hear the note of sympathy in their voices. He had run away from that. What if
  he had stayed, had gone on to town with Carroll, had taken his place with
  Billy Parrish and the rest of the boys, and made the best of things? He had
  thought he was doing the proud, independent, brave thing when he rode away
  from it all, but now he saw that he had done the weak, cowardly thing
  instead. And when he marked out the brands, that too had been an attempt to
  dodge the issue.</p>

  <p>Until that evening Cole Lawson had been able to think well of himself,
  however he might criticize and condemn those around him. He had been able
  always to justify his actions to himself; it was the other fellow who had
  blundered. But now he faced his own weakness and knew it for just that; his
  vanity&mdash;he could no longer call it pride. It made a difference. Cole
  Lawson began to appear rather contemptible in his eyes; not the fine,
  high-spirited young man who asked no man for sympathy or pity or help, but a
  swell-headed youth who wasn't willing to stand up and take a few hard blows.
  Yes, it surely did make a difference.</p>

  <p>So, having dodged and run away from what Life had placed before him, he
  was here because this was the trail he had taken. You couldn't run away from
  things and find any good fortune along the path of your flight. You had to
  take what came your way, and make the best you could of it. You couldn't
  dodge&mdash;Life wouldn't let you; if you refused your lesson in one form,
  you got it in another.</p>

  <p>It was his mother's teaching, unheeded until now when it all came back to
  shed a little light in the darkness. Cole raised his head and looked around
  him, at the bare walls, the door that let in the light in squares. His supper
  sat cold on its tray, just where the cheerful attendant had placed it; not
  much of a supper, but food of a sort. He went over and lifted the tray, sat
  down with it upon his knees. The big mug of coffee was cold, the beef stew
  was cold; but that was his own fault. They had been hot enough when the man
  brought them, and he had let them cool while he sulked.</p>

  <p>Cole drank the cold coffee, but the stew was too much for him, so he ate
  the bread that came with it and put the tray back by the door. He stood up
  and peered out into the corridor, his mind curiously at ease now that he had
  reached what seemed to him a solution of the puzzle his life had become. If
  all this was the result of dodging issues, then hereafter he would meet
  whatever came his way. He would do the best he could with it and let it go.
  Even these ninety days he would meet somehow without that sullen resentment
  which he now saw had dominated him during the past month.</p>

  <p>Though he did not know it, youth dropped away from Cole on that evening
  and left the man; a little hard around the mouth, a little somber in the
  eyes, but a man who would give the trail to none, come good luck or bad; a
  man who would drive straight to his purpose, who was done with subterfuges
  and evasions.</p>

  <p>Restless after the long, silent hours of tense thought and no muscular
  action, he made a smoke and began pacing slowly back and forth the short
  length of his cell. He was waiting now with a more normal curiosity for the
  arrival of the sheriff and his mysterious visitor. He still had no idea who
  it could be, but now it did not seem to matter much. He had neither defiance
  nor dread, but only an expectant mood of waiting to try his new-found
  strength of soul and purpose, to turn his face toward his world and put his
  philosophy to the test.</p>

  <p>He had finished that cigarette and was starting another, turning toward
  the barred light in the corridor so that he could see to sift the tobacco
  into the little paper trough in his fingers. A shadow fell upon the floor,
  blotting out the black squares; the shadow of a man wearing the high-crowned
  range hat which was the fashion among those he knew. Though he had not heard
  any one approach&mdash;they went cat-footed on rubber heels in that jail, it
  seemed&mdash;he knew that it must be the visitor, for the silhouette did not
  resemble the sheriff, somehow.</p>

  <p>Cole stared at it for a minute, raised his head and looked up into the
  twinkling blue eyes of big Ed Carroll, the sheriff whom he had last seen
  riding away from the C Bar L horse corral.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; COLE RECEIVES A SHOCK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YEAH, he's the sheriff of Points West," chuckled Saunders,
  when the three were settled in the jail office with the door closed. There
  had been a decided air of secrecy about the trip from cell to office, and
  among other puzzling things Cole wondered why; but since it did not seem to
  be his party, he waited until he was spoken to. "I kinda thought you'd
  recognize him. Glad to see him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not sorry, that I know of. How are you, Mr. Carroll? You didn't
  come clear over to Crater on my account, I hope&mdash;and how'd you know I
  was here?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't, till Saunders wired me. Lookin' kinda peaked, ain't yuh, Cole?
  Told you the devil was a poor boss to work for, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you did. But you never came away over here to crow about that. What
  have I done in your county that I shouldn't?" Two hours ago Cole could not
  have talked in that vein to save his life, but now he seemed to have dropped
  a weight of some kind, and the sight of Carroll stimulated him, cheered him
  even. All the boys had liked Sheriff Carroll. Even in these circumstances he
  was a friend from home and it was amazing how Cole warmed to his
  presence.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except leave it. Bill Saunders here has been telling me you got
  yourself in a little trouble, Cole. How about that story you told him about
  John Roper? I'd like to hear the particulars."</p>

  <p>Cole looked at Saunders, who was leaning back awkwardly in his desk chair,
  picking his teeth and staring at Cole with a ruminative expression that hid
  whatever might have been passing through his mind. Stupid, Cole thought him;
  stupid, but good-natured and probably honest.</p>

  <p>"Why, I guess Mr. Saunders told you all there is to tell," he answered,
  after a minute. "I rode with Roper to take a job helping him get some horses,
  and I overheard him mourning because he hadn't killed me while he had the
  chance. He wanted my four horses. I gave him the slip all right, but it was
  while I was doing it that I bumped into the trouble that landed me here in
  jail. You know my Eagle horse? Well, he got shot pretty bad in the shoulder.
  He's the one they made me ride in, and now you're here, Mr. Carroll, I wish
  you'd see if he's all right."</p>

  <p>"I'm lookin' after the horse," Saunders grunted. "Got him in the stable
  with my own."</p>

  <p>"What made you blot the brands, Cole?" Carroll was studying him more
  intently than even Cole's predicament seemed to warrant.</p>

  <p>"Well, I wanted to cut loose from everything, and the brand advertised
  where I was from. I did it after I'd stopped at a ranch up under the Pass and
  asked for work. Fellow there knew who I was, just by the brand on the horses.
  He threw it at me&mdash;and I turned and rode off, and after that I marked
  out the brands. I didn't want everybody asking about&mdash;things that was
  none of their business." He shot a sidelong glance at Saunders, wondering if
  he knew.</p>

  <p>Saunders let his chair tilt forward and snapped the toothpick between his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"That the Muleshoe, where you stopped?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;yes, I guess it was. I saw some cattle ranging near
  there with a muleshoe brand; or anyway, it could be called that."</p>

  <p>"And you blotted the brands <i>after</i> that, and&mdash;when was it you
  met Roper?"</p>

  <p>"Four or five days afterward. Five. I camped four days by a creek, in a
  little meadow, and then I rode in to a place&mdash;Little Lost was the sign
  over the gate&mdash;and bought some grub. It was that night at supper when
  Roper and a fellow he called Pete rode into camp. They asked themselves to
  supper, and they kept eyeing the horses, I noticed; but I didn't think
  anything much of it at the time&mdash;folks always do look them over; they're
  horses that would take any man's eye."</p>

  <p>Saunders looked at Carroll, who pursed his lips in thought.</p>

  <p>"There's the connection I been lookin' for," said Saunders softly. "I knew
  there was one somewhere. What do yuh think, Ed?"</p>

  <p>"Looks that way," Carroll admitted. "Four days&mdash;that would give 'em
  plenty of time to send word around."</p>

  <p>"Send what word around where?" Cole's eyes widened. "They didn't think I
  stole the horses. The man at the Muleshoe knew I was Cole Lawson, and he knew
  the brand was the Lawson brand. He asked me straight out if I wasn't Cole
  Lawson's son."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. And what did you tell him?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I told him to go to hell, or words to that effect."</p>

  <p>"Thought it was funny Roper would try to pull off a murder just to get the
  horses," Saunders mused, groping in his pocket for another toothpick. "Well,
  I guess we got the connection, all right. Hunh! Little thing like
  that&mdash;but it's the little things that leads to big ones. Ain't that
  right, Ed?"</p>

  <p>Carroll was still staring at Cole with a look as if Cole were transparent
  and he could see through him and beyond to something not visible to the
  others.</p>

  <p>"Funny the kid should be the one&mdash;and yet maybe things don't just
  happen, either. Well, Bill, looks like we got something to go on now. I
  suppose this bunch here is kinda on the anxious seat about Cole."</p>

  <p>"Wisht you coulda been at the p'rliminary, Ed. You'd have seen some sour
  looks thrown at the kid. Muleshoe, huh? Muleshoe and Roper. Pretty slick. Too
  slick to foller him themselves, or make a play at the ranch. Uh-huh." Again
  he ruminated. "That horse you was riding that night, Cole&mdash;he's got an
  extra feed of oats comin' to him!"</p>

  <p>They were talking in riddles, treating Cole like a child who has
  innocently given grownups some valuable information but is not considered old
  enough to be told what the excitement is all about. Had they told Cole to
  "Run along and play now," they would have been acting consistently. He
  resented that.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd quit treating me like a ten-year-old kid," he said sharply.
  "I've got three months on my hands, with nothing to do but think. I'm not
  going to put in the time wondering what the devil you two are talking about,
  and I'm not going to have any chance to tell all I know. You may as well give
  me the straight of this thing. Why would the Muleshoe men send word on to
  Roper, and why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you that," Saunders cut in, breaking the second toothpick and
  leaning forward in his chair. "Bart Nelson had his own reasons for getting
  scarey when he seen you ride up, coming straight from the C Bar L right after
  your father was killed. I've been kinda puzzled over Bart and his outfit, and
  never could pin a thing on to 'em. Now, I can see the connection. You came
  straight over there and asked for work. I can see now that Bart would think
  you suspicioned something, and thought maybe you could snoop around and find
  out a few things. Course, he didn't have no work for yuh!" Saunders looked at
  Ed Carroll, who nodded his confirmation of the deduction.</p>

  <p>"He was scared to tackle you, though; probably he thought you had somebody
  with you, and was just sent ahead to scout around. No, he wouldn't dare do a
  thing but let yuh go; and send word around to look out for yuh, and get yuh
  if possible." He chuckled, that silent shaking of his big body in throes of
  mirth that made no sound. "I bet the Muleshoe stepped soft, for a while," he
  added. "Huh, Ed? Lookin' for more C Bar L men to come trailin' the kid."</p>

  <p>"Billy Parrish and Red Billings come pretty near doing it," Carroll
  volunteered. "I got to 'em in time and talked 'em out of it. Made 'em see
  that it would do the kid good to get away by himself for a while. Pretty much
  of a shock, the way&mdash;things happened. Looked like his dad had committed
  suicide, and all the property&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Looked</i> like it!" Stark white, Cole was on his feet, glaring at the
  sheriff of Black Rim County. "Didn't he? Was he&mdash;was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, Cole, take it easy. I been studying you, and I made up my mind you
  could stand the gaff now. But if you're going to&mdash;hell, man, <i>sit
  down</i>!"</p>

  <p>Cole sat down, drawing a long breath as he pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"All right. I'm not a kid any longer, Ed. Shoot the works. I can stand
  it&mdash;anything but being left in the dark, guessing at things."</p>

  <p>"Well, guessing's about as good as any of us can do for a while, Cole,"
  Carroll said moodily. "Saunders and I, we're just puttin' two and two
  together. We couldn't take any of this into court, mind you. We're just
  piecing the evidence together, and it's you that has furnished us some mighty
  important pieces." He looked at Saunders inquiringly. "I guess we might as
  well tell Cole all we know about it, hadn't we? Seems to me he's about as
  interested a party as any of us."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh, if you say so. You've known him longer than I have. It's a
  ticklish proposition right now, but&mdash;for ninety days he ain't going to
  make any foolish moves, and by that time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll stand good for Cole's brains, and it seems to me he ought to know
  what we know. It's like this, Cole: When I said it <i>looked</i> like your
  father shot himself, that's about as far as I can go, right now. I will say
  this much, though, that I ain't at all certain it was suicide. Looked that
  way, because the bank had foreclosed on him all of a sudden, when the bottom
  dropped out of the beef market, and cattle went down to where it didn't pay
  to ship. Caught your dad where the hair was short&mdash;everybody knows
  that&mdash;but didn't it strike you as mighty funny, Cole, that he should
  take the six-gun route before he'd even found out how bad he was going to be
  off when the banks got through? Course, a man does go crazy enough to do a
  thing like that, sometimes; but there's a few points I'd like to clear up
  before I'd say he fired the shot himself."</p>

  <p>"The men on the ranch were all in the bunk house," Cole said slowly, his
  black eyebrows pulled together, while he recalled that scene which he had
  been trying for a month to forget. "We'd had a big argument at supper over a
  certain saddle in a catalogue, and we all went to the bunk house to settle
  it. It was just about dusk&mdash;a little late for shooting hawks&mdash;I
  guess that's why I ran up to the house when I heard&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped
  a moment to moisten his lips. "The boys were all in the bunk house," he
  repeated dully, and stared unseeingly at the floor.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I know. You sure you heard just one shot? You sure it wasn't two
  shots right close together?"</p>

  <p>Cole looked up at him, startled out of his gruesome meditation.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;I thought it was one. All the boys were laughing and guying
  Gene about what he'd said, and there was a good deal of noise, but I thought
  it was one shot. Afterwards, I thought it was funny I should run to
  see&mdash;Dad was always taking a shot at hawks that came down off the hill
  after the chickens."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Carroll dryly, "but you knew it was kinda late in the day
  for hawks. The chickens had all gone to roost, hadn't they?"</p>

  <p>"I guess they had. I never thought about that&mdash;afterwards. But I
  wasn't more than a minute or two getting to the house."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't expect you was. And it wouldn't take more 'n a minute for a
  man to get into the brush back of the house. How long would it take you to
  duck out of that room and into the gully behind the house?"</p>

  <p>"About ten seconds," Cole made quick calculation.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, about that. Would anybody at the bunk house or the corrals be
  liable to see yuh?"</p>

  <p>"No, they wouldn't. Not unless they were watching the door. From the bunk
  house you can't see the door, anyway. Dad used that room for an office,
  because the windows were just right for his desk, and the room has got that
  outside door. But he couldn't see what was going on around the corrals,
  unless he came to the door and looked out." He stopped abruptly, swallowing
  the lump that rose in his throat. How often had his dad appeared in the
  doorway, looking to see what mischief he was up to!</p>

  <p>"Well, it's mostly guesswork. But there's the tracks of high-heel boots
  going down into that gully, and whoever made 'em was running. They don't show
  at the house, because the gravel walk is wide there and beyond the gravel is
  a strip of grass. But beyond the grass, dipping down into the gully, is where
  the tracks show plain. Anybody you know of been running down there, right
  around close to that day?" Carroll was making it as easy as he could for
  Cole. "Did you, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"No. There wasn't any reason for any one to go down there. Dad left that
  hill wild, and the gully too, because&mdash;because Mother liked it just as
  nature made it. That's why our yard wasn't fussed up much with flower beds.
  She loved the wild growth. Her room looked down into that gully and up the
  hill beyond. We all liked that view. Dad wouldn't even put a fence where it
  would show on that hill."</p>

  <p>"So if any fresh tracks showed, runnin' into that gully, it's safe to say
  nobody on the ranch made 'em; that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>Cole took time to study the matter. He could see now what Carroll was
  driving at, and he knew he must not make a mistake.</p>

  <p>"No matter how many are living around a place," he said, after a minute's
  thought, "there are always certain spots they don't bother. That gully's one
  of them. There just wasn't any reason to go down there, is all. I don't
  suppose any one went into it once in six months; not since I grew up, anyway.
  I used to play Injun down in there, and hide from Mother or Dad when they got
  after me for something. But that's all it's good for. Even the chickens range
  off the other way, toward the creek."</p>

  <p>"That's what Billy Parrish told me. I ain't talked with the rest of the
  boys about it. But there's tracks in there, just the same. Whoever come and
  went that way, done it more than once. They could go up the gully to the top
  of the hill, crawl through the fence and ride off across the pasture without
  any one seeing them. That right?"</p>

  <p>"It could be done, yes. It could be, but it wasn't; not by any one at the
  C Bar L. It would be too much out of the way, getting anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Not for some," Carroll remarked, with grim meaning. "Well, I got to
  prowling around and run across them tracks, and that's what started me
  thinkin'. Since then there's been other things to bear out the theory that
  somebody was there that evening to see your dad. He was used to staying in
  that office a lot, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Since Mother died, he was. He liked to be left alone a good deal. When he
  was in the house he always stayed in his office, except mealtimes and when he
  went to bed."</p>

  <p>"You didn't stay with him&mdash;set in there with him?"</p>

  <p>"No." Cole caught his breath, suddenly struck with the utter loneliness of
  his father. "I never thought he wanted me there. He never talked; he read a
  lot, I guess, and worked over his books and smoked. I was always with the
  boys in the bunk house or riding around. The house was lonesome&mdash;after
  Mother died. I slept there, is all. Sometimes I ate with Dad, and sometimes
  with the boys. I guess&mdash;" he glanced up at Carroll and away
  again&mdash;"I wasn't much company for Dad. I&mdash;wish I had been."</p>

  <p>"No fault of yours, Cole. He wanted it that way or he wouldn't have had it
  that way. When a man puts money-makin' before everything else, he ain't much
  company for a kid. What's the matter?" He broke off to lean and stare at
  Cole, who had turned white again.</p>

  <p>Cole bit his lip, looked away, caught Saunders staring at him and closed
  his eyes tightly for a minute. When he opened them again they were not the
  eyes of a boy. They gleamed with a new bitterness and they met Carroll's look
  without flinching.</p>

  <p>"The way it happened," he said with forced calm. "Could a man&mdash;shoot
  another one&mdash;that way?"</p>

  <p>Carroll exhaled a long breath and sat back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Would a man lay down on the floor and blow his own brains out with a
  gun?" he countered slowly. "Both are possible, but neither one is common. I
  believe the killer knocked your dad down and then shot him&mdash;with the gun
  in his mouth. I found where the bullet went into the wall, <i>under a
  chair</i>. Nobody knows that but me and Billy Parrish. Your dad wasn't in the
  habit of packing a gun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, but he kept it handy. On the table in the office, mostly."</p>

  <p>"It ain't a pleasant subject to talk about, Cole, but there's one other
  point. You got to him first. Remember where the gun laid when you went
  in?"</p>

  <p>"It was right by his hand. His fingers almost touched it; like this." Cole
  went down on one knee and spread his right hand open on the floor to show
  them. "The gun lay right there, as if&mdash;why, good Lord, Carroll! I never
  thought at the time, but it ought to have been by the other one! Dad was
  left-handed in his shooting!" He got up and stood looking a bit wildly from
  one to the other.</p>

  <p>"Now I know Ham Fat was right. He said he heard somebody talking to
  Dad&mdash;remember? We all thought Dad was maybe talking to himself. He did,
  sometimes, when he was alone and upset over something. Ham Fat said he heard
  talking, and he heard a bump, but we didn't pay any attention to him. We
  couldn't see how any one could be with Dad when we were all in the bunk
  house. Now it fits."</p>

  <p>"Who's Ham Fat?" Saunders wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Chinaman cook. He took care of the house. He went and hid when he found
  out what had happened. That wasn't his name&mdash;it was Wong Fat, or
  something, but we called him Ham Fat just for a josh. Good old chink,
  too."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't him," said Carroll, answering Saunders' look. "Well, you see
  how it lays, kid. It looked like suicide, all right, and coming right when it
  did, on top of all them foreclosures, it seemed reasonable enough. And as you
  say, the way it happened would show it was suicide. But afterwards Billy
  Parrish asked me on the quiet what I thought of that right-handed shooting
  for a man that's always shot left-handed, and that started me to prowling
  around. That's how I happened to run on to the tracks going into the gully.
  Somebody had left a horse tied to the outside of the fence, up over the hill;
  more'n once, by the looks of things. It's bushy up there, if you remember,
  Cole."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"It was right in that young pine thicket up there. Ain't more 'n half a
  mile from the house, but I don't suppose anybody'd go there once a year,
  unless it was to look after the fence. Gully runs from there on down to the
  foot of the hill, and brush all the way. What more 'd a man want?"</p>

  <p>No one spoke for a minute, and then Cole swore a sudden oath under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"And for three months I've got to sit in here doing nothing!" he said
  bitterly. "Mr. Saunders, you argued me into it, and now if I break jail you
  needn't blame anybody but yourself. I'll tear the damn joint down, but what
  I'll get out!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; COLE PLANS HIS CAMPAIGN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">COLE got up restlessly and began pacing back and forth
  across the office, his hands in his pockets, and his sunken eyes bent in
  haggard misery upon the floor. Murder, not suicide, had taken his life and
  smashed it with wanton brutality. About the property he did not care so much,
  perhaps because he had never known the pinch of poverty and so could not
  visualize all its sordid details. But to think that his father had been
  murdered and made to seem a coward in death! With all the men on the ranch,
  men who loved him enough to fight for him, his father had suffered that
  ignominy, and the murderer had been able to sneak away unsuspected. Without
  in the least knowing what he did, Cole pulled one fist from his trousers'
  pocket and shook it at the wall.</p>

  <p>"I'll get the&mdash;&mdash;!" he said between his teeth. "Who was it?" He
  whirled upon big Ed Carroll, who watched him. "Do you know? Was it Roper? Was
  it some one at the Muleshoe? What did they have against Dad? Mr. Saunders, I
  can't stay in here for three months; I <i>won't</i> stay. You've got to let
  me out so I can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, now, hold on a minute!" Carroll restrained him with an uplifted
  hand. "You can maybe do more good right where you are now, Cole. This is
  something we've been workin' on for close to two years. It's more than just
  your father. That's only one angle of it&mdash;no, don't take me wrong, kid;
  I ain't belittling what happened to him. But the thing goes farther. Saunders
  and I have been tryin' to get a line on an organized gang of rustlers and
  hold-up men that's been operatin' all up through this country, and even into
  Montana and Washington and Oregon. Seemed like one link of the chain was over
  this way, but Saunders couldn't pin anything to any one.</p>

  <p>"Now, I've got reasons to believe your dad knew something. He did a lot of
  outside buying, you know; little bunch of stock for sale, he'd go grab it.
  Worked on money he borrowed from the bank, last few years, and branched out
  more 'n was safe. But anyway, he must have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you say he was working with a gang like that, Ed Carroll, I'll kill
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, sit down! I never said he was, nor never meant it. I do say he must
  have found out something. Maybe he was the goat, on some deal they put over
  on him. I don't know&mdash;but it looks now as if there was something brewing
  at the C Bar L, something the gang was worried about.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Saunders, working over at this end, gets word from me to look out
  for you, Cole, because you've hit out for yourself and are headed this way.
  Nothin' to that, only I wanted you should have somebody over here in case you
  needed a friend. Ain't long till he hears about you shootin' a fellow on the
  run. At least, he thinks it's you, from what he heard."</p>

  <p>"Griswold boys described you," Saunders explained, "and then Pete Brown,
  that's working for Roper said he'd seen you before that, and that you had
  some stolen horses and was a hard-lookin' guy that acted like you was on the
  dodge."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, well, when this fellow swore out a complaint&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steve Harris," Saunders supplied.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Bill saw there was a lot more feeling displayed than the crime
  called for, so he wired me to come over. Then he got your story, and the
  thing looked a darn sight bigger than at the start."</p>

  <p>Back and forth, back and forth went Cole, like a tiger in a cage. Now he
  stopped and eyed the two with sharp questioning. They looked quickly at each
  other, looked away again. Probably they had seen men driven to desperation
  before and knew the signs. Carroll got up quietly and dropped a hand on
  Cole's shoulder; the sprained one, for the lad winced.</p>

  <p>"Easy, boy. We're counting on your help, but right now you can do more
  good by staying here in jail, where they think you're safe and they're safe.
  If it's like we think it is, somebody over on this side the mountains knows
  more about what happened that night in your house than you do. But it wasn't
  Bart Nelson, or he wouldn't have throwed it up to you about your dad. Maybe
  it was Roper and maybe it wasn't. We don't know. You can't go hellin' up and
  down Burroback, askin' every man you meet if he killed your dad; you've got
  to go at it sly and easy&mdash;and maybe slow, to what you'd like to do. You
  throwed a scare into the bunch when you come riding down Thunder Pass like
  you meant to stay, and I'd stake a good deal on my guess that Bart Nelson
  sent out the word that you're in the country and to look out. Probably Roper
  was hunting you, and them blotched brands gave him another jolt. It showed
  you didn't want it known where you was from. All he could think of was to get
  you off down in the Sinks and see to it you disappeared&mdash;and the chances
  are your horses would have gone with you!</p>

  <p>"But what can we <i>prove</i>? You say you heard them talking. The two of
  them can say you lied. Roper's an honest rancher on the face of it, and Pete
  Brown's his hired man&mdash;on the face of it. Now, if they don't know you
  heard 'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They don't. How could they? Unless Mrs. Harris or Dorothy tells." Cole
  had quieted, but it was the quiet of a leashed bloodhound quivering for the
  hunt.</p>

  <p>"They won't tell," said Saunders.</p>

  <p>"So the gang thinks you're out of the way, in jail here, and they're safe.
  They'd have liked it better if you'd gone to the pen, but anyway, you're safe
  for ninety days. Don't you see it, Cole? While they're thinking about you
  here, we'll be following the lead you've furnished us."</p>

  <p>Cole gave an impatient snort and sat down, leaning forward with his elbows
  on his knees. Carroll had never seen his jaw so square and stubborn, his eyes
  so hard. He looked years older, more like his father.</p>

  <p>"You two are old hands at this, and I'm green," he said tensely, "but
  there's something you've overlooked. Look here, Carroll, would I be apt to
  come off over here on a clue of some kind, and nobody else at the ranch know
  a thing about it? If you're right about the Muleshoe and Roper and all, you
  can bet your sweet life they're watching for the next move. If that trick to
  make Dad look like a suicide didn't get by with me, how would it get by with
  anybody else? I don't know about the Muleshoe outfit, but Roper's no fool. I
  can see why he'd want to get me out of the way; they'd found out by that time
  that I was alone, I suppose. But don't you ever think they feel safe and are
  going to tip their hands!</p>

  <p>"The one thing we've got the edge on them about is the fact that they
  don't know I was wise to them that night. They never knew I heard them
  talking about me, so Roper probably thinks I just got lost and wandered
  around till I found the way out. He thinks he's jake with me, and if I was to
  meet him in the road he'd probably offer to hire me again. He thinks I was
  stampeded by them three I met, but he doesn't know I thought they were his
  men. How could he? The last he saw or heard of me, I was trailing along,
  expecting to go to work for him!"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Saunders admitted.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet they're watching over Black Rim way, a heap closer than you're
  watching over this way. They just thought they'd put me away while they had
  the chance, but don't ever think they believe the danger stopped with me. For
  one thing, they never tried to find me. They just let me go. I don't believe
  they thought I was so darn important, after all. Roper told Mrs. Harris I was
  an outlaw, on the dodge with stolen horses. I don't see
  why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh, sure he'd tell some such story," Saunders cut in. "John Roper's
  an honest rancher, you want to remember. He wouldn't make any open move
  against you. That night in the Sinks, it just looked too good a chance to
  pass up, I guess."</p>

  <p>"What you got on your mind, Cole?" Carroll had been watching him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that to find out anything worth while, you've got to get
  right in and work with him and for him. I know every word Bart Nelson at the
  Muleshoe said, and every word I said, and what's to prove I didn't ride off
  mad because I'd stolen those four horses of mine? He don't <i>know</i> I'm
  Cole Lawson. You spread around the report that Cole Lawson is somewhere else,
  Carroll, and I'll go to Roper and bone him for that job he offered me. I'll
  be an outlaw on' the dodge, far as they're concerned."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't make it stick," Carroll objected. "Besides, it's too
  risky."</p>

  <p>"I could get away with it all right, if you'll help plant me somewhere
  else. Say, I'll write a letter to Billy Parrish, and tell him how somebody
  stole my horses, and how I had to walk to the railroad, and caught a train
  somewhere. Seattle's a good place. I'll say I'm headed for Alaska. The boys
  all know I've been crazy to go there, and they'll fall for it. You can work
  it, can't you?" Cole looked from one to the other, an eager light in his
  eyes. "If I was a sheriff I could work it," he hinted. "I'd work it if I had
  to make the trip to Seattle myself to mail the letter. Anybody you think is
  in touch with these fellows over here, make darn sure he sees the letter or
  hears about it, anyway. Get the boys to talk a lot about me going to
  Alaska.</p>

  <p>"Then, when I come out of here, I'll go strike Roper for a
  job&mdash;<i>and hold it</i>! Hell, I can be as tough as they are&mdash;if it
  will help find the fellow that&mdash;&mdash;" He did not finish that
  sentence. There was no need.</p>

  <p>Saunders was industriously wearing another toothpick ragged and watching
  Cole stupidly. Now he snapped the tiny stick in two and cast the pieces from
  him, leaning forward with his hands clasped across his middle and his thumbs
  rolling swiftly over each other; a sign, by the way, that big Bill Saunders
  was very much awake to the situation.</p>

  <p>"I can get you all the dope on ships sailing north," he said, in his lazy
  drawl. "You'll want plenty of local color that can be checked. Not havin'
  much money with you, probably you aim to work your passage. I'll find that
  out too. I'll have a Cole Lawson stopping at a cheap rooming house down on
  Second Avenue&mdash;I know the place&mdash;and I'll have Cole Lawson start
  for Alaska on any ship we want. Got a friend there&mdash;deputy
  sheriff&mdash;he'll fix it up. Mail all the letters you want to write. Better
  say good-by to all your friends&mdash;got a girl over at Points
  West&mdash;you better send her some little beaded dew-dad they sell to
  tourists on the Coast." He drew a long breath and looked at Carroll
  mildly.</p>

  <p>"Idea's fine, if we can put it over. It'll take a little time, but then,
  time's plenty around here. We been workin' two years to land our men, and I
  guess another month or two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ninety days," Cole gloomily corrected him. "Eighty-nine, I mean, if your
  clock's right."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. Ten minutes to one. Well, I ain't in the habit of havin' jail
  breaks, but if a prisoner should get away from me, I'd have deputies out
  after him, you bet&mdash;&mdash;" One fat eyelid went down in leisurely
  fashion and lifted again.</p>

  <p>Cole stared, glanced sidelong at Carroll who was studying him with
  expressionless intentness, looked at Saunders again and grinned.</p>

  <p>"I'd sure give them a run for their money," he boldly declared. "Say, I'm
  the toughest guy that ever stole a horse! Jails can't hold
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This one will for a while yet," Saunders dryly interrupted his boasting.
  "Think he's tough enough, Ed?"</p>

  <p>"Cole's all right," Carroll answered gruffly. "He'd go through with
  anything he started, but it's too damn risky. We better not let him tackle
  it."</p>

  <p>"I want it risky!" Cole cried eagerly. "I can see the whole play now. If
  Mr. Saunders means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean you're going back to your apartment, young feller, and stay there
  and keep your mouth shut. Ed and I'll have to do a pile of thinkin' and
  schemin' on this proposition. We make a fluke of it, and our goose is cooked
  at next election. Keep this all behind your teeth, and
  maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn ticklish," Carroll grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Look here! I <i>know</i> I can put it over. They gave me the name, and I
  sure can play the game. All I want is a chance. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come on, and keep your trap closed. I got a feller down at the end of the
  hall that's kinda tough himself. Stole a rifle and watch from the blacksmith,
  and he's layin' out a sixty-day sentence. Used to ride for John Roper." He
  paused to let that sink in. "Maybe in a day or two I'll put you in with him;
  see how tough yuh are. And by the way, Dick, that looks after the boarders,
  is a mouthy cuss that turns whichever way the wind blows. Good-hearted, but
  what goes into his head comes out on his tongue. You couldn't keep his mouth
  shut with copper rivets. Comes in handy for me&mdash;I sure know what the
  prisoners look and feel&mdash;and <i>talk</i>."</p>

  <p>"I get you."</p>

  <p>"Don't ever be misled by his seemin' friendly," Saunders warned him
  further. "If you're goin' to put this thing over at all, you got to be a
  horse thief waking and sleeping, young feller. You dassen't let up at no
  time, except in this office with me. And if I act harsh, you take it like a
  horse thief and a bad egg generally."</p>

  <p>"I understand, Mr. Saunders. Don't think I'll fall down on the job. How
  could I? It's for&mdash;Dad."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. But the C Bar L is no friend of yours from now on, remember."</p>

  <p>"Too damn dangerous," Ed Carroll protested for the third time. "They'd cut
  his throat quick as they'd stick a pig."</p>

  <p>"And I'd see them hang and never turn a hair," Cole said with an
  implacable kind of calm. "I want you to know, both of you, that my business
  from now on is to find the men that killed my father and made it look as if
  he shot himself because he was too big a coward to face a little hard luck.
  That's why I left in the first place. I couldn't stand the thought of folks
  knowing my father sneaked out of life the way he did. If I can prove to
  people that he didn't&mdash;that he was murdered and his&mdash;his good name
  tramped in the mud&mdash;don't you suppose I'll go the limit? You needn't
  worry, either of you. I'm not going to make any slip-up."</p>

  <p>"No, I guess you won't. Well, we'll see. Go quiet, kid." Saunders opened
  the door and waited for Cole. The two went out so silently that even Carroll,
  who was listening in the office, heard no sound in the corridor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; COLE PLAYS THE GAME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TWO days later, a sullen youth slouched into the large cell
  at the end of the corridor, his entrance accelerated noticeably by a push
  from behind. The door clanged shut behind him with a spiteful definiteness,
  and Saunders met the impotent snarl with a scowl of disfavor.</p>

  <p>"You keep up that midnight cussing," he said sourly, "and Shorty, here,
  will kick your ribs in. I've had about enough outa you. Little more and
  you'll go in the cage, on bread and water diet for a while. Don't take any
  lip from him, Shorty. He's got a lame shoulder, and I guess you can handle
  him if it comes to a showdown. Kept me awake two nights now, so I'm turning
  him in for you to tame him."</p>

  <p>Shorty McGuire, the brief possessor of a rifle and watch he had not
  earned, licked a thumb and began mechanically slipping off three cards from
  his worn deck while he eyed his new cell mate.</p>

  <p>"Aw, he'll be all right, Sheriff. Goes kinda tough when a feller's left
  all by himself like that. I cussed considerable, myself, first week or so in
  here; all the difference is, I was off down here at the end, where you
  couldn't hear me. Say, I swore m'self hoarse!" His rather close-set eyes of
  commonplace blue turned measuringly upon Cole, and he swept up his layout of
  solitaire with a sigh of anticipation. "How about a little game of coon-can
  or something, stranger? Solitary sure gets monotonous after a while. Couldn't
  we have a table in here, Sheriff?"</p>

  <p>Sheriff Saunders gave a grunt and walked back up the corridor, and Shorty
  listened with his head cocked sidewise until he was certain the office door
  had closed. Then he looked at Cole and grinned.</p>

  <p>"You don't wanta mind <i>him</i>," he said in a tone meant to be
  reassuring. "His bark's worse 'n his bite, any day. I bet he don't put a guy
  in the cage once in six months; not unless they're crazy or the like of that.
  He Just makes threats. My name's Shorty McGuire, what's yours?"</p>

  <p>"I've been calling myself Cole. Kinda like the sound of it too. Better use
  it," Cole said, in none too friendly a tone. He took a turn up and down the
  cell, which was double the size of his own and could at a pinch accommodate
  four prisoners. "Damn this town!" he abruptly explained. "I meant to make it
  up into Montana before cold weather."</p>

  <p>"Aw, fergit it!" Shorty urged sympathetically. "I ain't hangin' around
  because I'm in love with the life, m'self." He was shuffling the cards
  slowly, evidently waiting for his invitation to be accepted.</p>

  <p>Cole halted beneath the barred window which was set into the stone wall
  six feet from the floor. He stood looking up at it, his eyes narrowed. After
  a minute of perfect quiet he reached up with his well arm and felt the bars
  one by one, gripping each and giving it a tentative shake. Shorty laughed
  unmirthfully as he watched.</p>

  <p>"Nope, they don't rattle in the wind," he dryly observed. "Not enough to
  keep yuh awake nights, anyway. I made sure of that long ago."</p>

  <p>Cole turned and looked at him morosely.</p>

  <p>"How long you been in?" he asked sourly.</p>

  <p>"Me? Four weeks tomorra. She's the lonesomest damn' jail I ever seen. Too
  dead to stink, this town is. All this room in here, and nobody canned once a
  month. Come on and let's start a series. Twenty-one games&mdash;and the
  loser&mdash;got any money on you?"</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose, after that damn pot-belly went through me?" growled
  Cole.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, same here. Afraid we might git extravagant." Shorty pulled down the
  corners of his mouth in a sardonic grin. "Well, we'll keep tabs with matches,
  till Dick comes, and then maybe we can talk him outa some dry beans. Low
  deals&mdash;come on, cut." And when Cole did not move toward him, "Aw, what's
  the use of fightin' your head about it?" he remonstrated. "Don't make the
  time go no quicker. I know, buhlieve me! I tried it."</p>

  <p>"It's the feeling that I had to go and slip up on a bad break in the
  dark," Cole said, as if the thought literally forced itself into speech.
  "I've managed to steer away from the jug, when&mdash;&mdash;And to get caught
  up on a blunder like that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I know that side of it too," sympathized Shorty. "Why, look at me!
  Had to go and swipe a darn 30.30 I didn't really need&mdash;found out
  afterwards the rifling was all wore out, at that!&mdash;and a watch that lost
  twenty minutes a day! And get nabbed! Darn that lousy Swede, it makes me sore
  every time I think of it. But then," he added by way of extenuation, "I was
  pickled to the ears or I'd 'a' knowed better. Come on, cut for deal."</p>

  <p>Apathetically Cole cut the cards to a ten spot. Shorty cut a trey, licked
  his thumb and dealt the cards swiftly, ten to each. They began the silent
  game, making the spreads on the space of lumpy mattress between them on the
  cot they used for seats and table as well. Cole had last played coon-can with
  Red Billings at the C Bar L, and a wave of homesickness swept over him; but
  he shut the memory sternly from his mind and calmly picked up the queen of
  clubs, spread it with jack and king and discarded the trey of diamonds which
  Shorty promptly seized, making a spread of treys.</p>

  <p>Twice during the day Cole went carefully over the room, examining walls,
  floor, the ceiling which he could not reach, of course, and giving especial
  attention to the window. Shorty watched him and thumbed his prized deck of
  cards.</p>

  <p>"You ain't used to bein' cooped," he remarked, when Cole was making his
  third attempt to shake a window bar.</p>

  <p>"And I ain't going to get used to it, either. You can bank your sweet life
  on that," Cole retorted. "Let me up on your shoulders, Shorty. I want to take
  a look outside."</p>

  <p>Shorty obligingly complied.</p>

  <p>"She backs up against some old sheds and then comes the hill. On a dark
  night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sss!" hissed Shorty, and eased Cole down to the floor. "Wish we had some
  beans," he said cheerfully, pulling Cole back to the cot and pushing him down
  with the flat of his palm. "I'd try you a whirl at poker, old-timer. Sky
  limit and the joker runnin' wild. Your deal." He sent a stealthy glance over
  his shoulder to the door.</p>

  <p>"Four tabs&mdash;I need 'em in my business and I'm goin' after 'em right
  now."</p>

  <p>He was talking for an eavesdropper, but his caution was apparently wasted,
  for the sound in the corridor ceased. Shorty strolled over to the door and
  peered out, listening.</p>

  <p>"You never know what that damned mealy-mouthed Dick is up to," he made
  pettish comment, as he resumed the only pastime they had save reading. "Don't
  go shakin' them bars all the time, Cole. There ain't a chance in the world of
  loosening 'em."</p>

  <p>Cole did not reply to that, but the gleam in his eyes as he glanced up
  from his hand caused Shorty to overlook a king when he was making a spread of
  kings; which was unusual, for Shorty seldom overlooked anything that was to
  his advantage.</p>

  <p>Day followed dull day, and the two struck up a certain degree of
  friendship, natural to companions in solitude. As became the role he was
  playing, Cole cursed his ill luck with consistent venom and spent hours in
  pacing the roomy cell and devising wild plans of escape which Shorty
  discouraged. They talked of many things, but never of the Muleshoe or the
  Black Rim country or John Roper, because Shorty mentioned none of these and
  Cole was afraid to take the initiative.</p>

  <p>He studied Shorty&mdash;and sometimes he felt an uncomfortable conviction
  that Shorty was likewise studying him; that he was watching and weighing him
  and only partly believing in him; that behind that careless manner of being
  willing to take what came and make the best of it lay Shorty's real self,
  with many things of which he did not speak. A strange, intent look came
  sometimes into his eyes. What it signified Cole was not able to decide, but
  he did know that right here in the very beginning of his grim rle he was
  forced to play to a critical audience of one, and he was not at all certain
  that he would not hear a catcall of disdain for his poor acting, before the
  first act was over. He did not put it in exactly that form. He told himself
  that he didn't know whether he got over with Shorty, and that he would have
  to get over now or give up the crazy scheme altogether; because Shorty was
  not the fool he sometimes appeared to be.</p>

  <p>Inaction was maddening. There were times when Cole doubted whether
  Saunders and Carroll were not making a fool of him. There were days when he
  lay on his cot with his face hidden on his folded arms and gave himself up to
  black despair while he pretended to be asleep. Those times, Shorty read wild
  west stories and cursed fluently their glaring inaccuracies, or played
  solitaire with endless patience while he hummed vile paraphrases of popular
  songs.</p>

  <p>Saunders never came near. Dick, the cheerful guard, brought food twice a
  day and joked with Shorty and doled out matches and cigarettes to both and
  went his way again, whistling down the corridor and out into the sunny world
  that to Cole seemed shut away forever, a mythical world of rolling hills and
  wind-swept levels and sun and moon and stars. He could not see that he was
  accomplishing anything at all, except that in spite of themselves the days
  did drag past to where they could be checked off in his mind as that much
  gone from his sentence. But three months of it&mdash;<i>three months</i>,
  while his father's murderer roamed free!</p>

  <p>But one thing was accomplished which should have gratified him. His
  sprained shoulder was recovering its full strength in that time of forced
  quiet, and he forgot all about the stiffness and pain in his neck.</p>

  <p>He was lying so, with his face hidden, when voices came down the corridor;
  Saunders' voice, and another that tingled his nerves so that a prickly chill
  went from his scalp to his toes and left him with a surge of hot blood and
  then a chill that seemed to center somewhere in his throat.</p>

  <p>"Calls himself Cole, eh? That's gall, taking a man's horses and his name
  too. Think he'll talk? Young Lawson'll be tickled to death if I get his
  horses back for him. He had some money too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>How plainly Billy Parrish's voice came down the corridor! It was to warn
  him, of course, and prepare him for the visit. They were afraid he might
  betray himself to Shorty McGuire. Not that it would matter a great deal,
  except that Shorty's sentence expired before Cole's, and when he was released
  he would probably talk&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hey, wake up, Cole," Shorty was saying in his ear. "You got company."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em to go to hell," mumbled Cole, and twitched away from Shorty's
  fingers. "Lemme alone. I'm sleepy."</p>

  <p>Why hadn't they waited until it was darker in there? But when he moved his
  head so that one eye could look out into the room, he saw that the hours had
  dragged themselves broken-backed to late afternoon, and the cell was almost
  dusky. He wanted it so. He did not want Billy Parrish to see his face too
  plainly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; THE DEPUTY FROM BLACK RIM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEETING Billy Parrish without look or word of recognition
  was one of the most difficult experiences Cole had ever known, but he
  accomplished it somehow. A flicker of Billy's eyes, a twitching of his lips,
  and he was stiff, uncompromising, hostile. But big Bill Saunders inexorably
  pushed to the front of the conversation, chewing his inevitable toothpick and
  darting quick glances around the cell as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"This is a deputy sheriff from Black Rim County, Cole," he announced in
  his rumbling drawl. "He says you stole four horses over that way and brought
  'em into Crater County. Says you took 'em from young Lawson; C Bar L
  horses."</p>

  <p>"That's news to me," grunted Cole, turning away because he could not bear
  to face Billy Parrish in that guise.</p>

  <p>"Young Cole Lawson wrote back from Seattle and told about it, and
  described you to a T. Parrish here can identify the horses."</p>

  <p>"Let him, then!"</p>

  <p>"You tell where the other three are, and mebbe there won't be any charge
  brought against you. What he wants now is to get the kid's horses back."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing to me," Cole said shortly, backing away to sit down on his
  cot.</p>

  <p>"Ain't, huh? Well, I guess you better come on out to the office where we
  can have a little talk with yuh." Saunders' tone was grim as he unlocked the
  door. "I guess you'll find out it's quite a lot to yuh. Come on outa
  there!"</p>

  <p>He looked so bulky and capable a representative of that dread thing, the
  Law, that Cole's shoulders drooped a little as he glared at the two without
  moving. It was not until Saunders took a threatening step into the room that
  Cole got up and went out sullenly. Even Shorty must see that he had no choice
  in the matter, he thought, as he glanced back over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My God, Cole, you're looking thin! What you been doing to yourself?"
  Billy Parrish muttered solicitously as Cole brushed by him. "I never saw yuh
  look&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Cole warned him under his breath. "That fellow in there'll hear
  you."</p>

  <p>Billy glanced over his shoulder to where Shorty stood watching them go,
  and turned toward Saunders who was coming behind. Whatever he had to say must
  wait until they were safely shut into the office, he remembered.</p>

  <p>It must have been a good deal, for it was a full hour before Saunders
  brought Cole back to the cell. Shorty was sitting with his elbows on his
  knees and his hands loosely clasped between them, staring abstractedly at the
  floor. He looked up under his eyebrows as Cole came in, his eyes lingering
  inquiringly on Cole's sullen face.</p>

  <p>"Well, did you cough up the information?" Shorty's voice was tinged with
  mockery. It was like the expression Cole sometimes saw in his eyes; the look
  that made Cole wonder if he were quite convincing in his rle of bad man.</p>

  <p>"They know already where one horse is." Cole pulled himself together and
  with a long breath of weariness slipped on the mask. "I rode him into town.
  That&mdash;damn' deputy identified him as a C Bar L horse."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? That makes it look kinda bad for you, don't it?"</p>

  <p>Cole started to roll a cigarette with fingers that shook. For answer he
  shrugged his shoulders as if words were unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"C Bar L&mdash;that's the outfit that went broke, ain't it? Old man shot
  himself; blowed his brains out. Was you there?"</p>

  <p>Cole was moistening the edge of paper with his tongue, and he stared at
  Shorty over his two hands, his eyes black and shining in the half light of
  the room.</p>

  <p>"I didn't have to be," he said evenly while he shaped the little tube.
  "Young Lawson started off this way with his horses. I&mdash;met him the other
  side of Thunder Pass."</p>

  <p>"You sure took a chance," was Shorty's comment. "Gosh, it was lonesome
  while you was gone! Thought maybe that&mdash;deputy from Black Rim was goin'
  to glom you and take you away from here."</p>

  <p>"Nothing like that. They tried to get me to tell 'em where the other three
  horses are."</p>

  <p>"Did yuh?"</p>

  <p>"No." Cole sat down and smoked moodily. Shorty got up and began walking up
  and down, up and down, head bent and shoulders sagged forward. At first Cole
  paid no attention to him; but the clocklike regularity with which Shorty's
  booted feet passed within Cole's range of vision finally registered a
  mechanical kind of attention on Cole's mind, and pulled his thoughts slowly
  away from a heartsick dwelling upon the Black Rim country and the grisly
  tragedy of the C Bar L. The fact forced itself upon his mind that Shorty was
  upset about something.</p>

  <p>Did Shorty possess any guilty knowledge of the operation of this Crater
  County gang? It did not seem so, and Saunders had not been surprised when
  Cole reported that he had gleaned nothing whatever from his cell mate. He had
  merely remarked that Shorty could probably do a lot for Cole after he got out
  of jail; knowing Roper as Shorty must, from having worked for him, his word
  would go a long way toward convincing Roper that Cole was an outlaw from some
  other section of the range. Cole had told Billy and Saunders that Shorty was
  too easy-going a type to be mixed up in anything outside the law, and that he
  lacked the quick wit which one of Roper's gang must have.</p>

  <p>Now, Cole's abstraction was broken by Shorty's restless pacing to and fro.
  Three steps on the floor, and Shorty's feet went past. Another step and a
  turn; here came the feet again. Small feet&mdash;the smallest Cole had ever
  seen on a man so tall. Shorty must be close to six feet in his boots. Three
  steps, a turn, three steps back, and the boots going by; left heel run over
  on the outside, right heel worn on the inside edge&mdash;Shorty did that by
  always standing "hip-shot," his weight resting almost entirely on his left
  leg&mdash;shiny streak on the counters where his spurs had rubbed, bootlegs
  stitched in red thread, an oblong scroll pattern such as Cole had written
  over and over in his copy books at school during the half-hour writing
  lesson.</p>

  <p>He wished he dared talk frankly with Shorty, and tell him just what was
  the problem that faced him. Knowing John Roper, Shorty might be able to give
  him good advice. He had even suggested to Saunders that he confide in Shorty,
  because he felt that Shorty liked him and half suspected that he was not so
  black as he painted himself. Shorty was a good-natured, harmless sort, like
  nine tenths of the riders on the range. He had probably worked for Roper and
  never dreamed that the ranch was a blind and that Roper's real business lay
  deeper and far more hidden than Crater County knew.</p>

  <p>Back and forth, and the feet crossing rhythmically the square of stone
  floor directly before Cole, who finished his cigarette and sat erect. Almost
  as if that were a signal, Shorty stopped and faced him, his lips parted in a
  half smile.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, that throwed a scare into me, havin' you gone so long," he said,
  when Cole looked up at him inquiringly. "Had the blue willies ever since.
  Sure they ain't plannin' on takin' you outa here?"</p>

  <p>"I guess they couldn't do that till my ninety days are up," Cole said,
  after a moment of hesitation. "That's a long time from now. I'll maybe get a
  chance to beat it before then."</p>

  <p>"Sh-sh," warned Shorty, whose keen ears had detected a sound in the
  corridor. "Dick's takin' his time to-night, but I guess that's our
  supper."</p>

  <p>His guess was correct. They ate in silence, each busy with his own
  thoughts. But afterwards Shorty threw off his moodiness and wanted to talk
  about the only incident that had broken into the monotony of their cloisteral
  days.</p>

  <p>"If you didn't open up this time and tell 'em," he began abruptly,
  "they're liable to haul you out there again and try to make yuh come through,
  don't yuh think?"</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't get any more than they've got now."</p>

  <p>"Didn't they say anything about you thinkin' it over and maybe decidin' to
  tell 'em to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"No. I got the impression that Black Rim deputy is leaving town in the
  morning. The sheriff said something about going along."</p>

  <p>This, it happened, was the truth. Billy and Saunders were planning to
  visit the Harris ranch and have a long, confidential talk with Mrs. Harris
  and Dorothy. Cole's earnest assurance that they were his friends and could be
  trusted with the true story&mdash;which he secretly wanted them to hear, now
  that he knew the truth about his father&mdash;had done much to influence the
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>Billy Parrish had enthusiastically suggested that the women be permitted
  to visit the jail and smuggle a hack-saw blade in to Cole, perhaps in a
  watermelon or something. He had argued that a woman hates to see any man she
  likes in jail, and even Roper's gang would accept their coming as perfectly
  natural. But Cole had talked against that plan. He did not want Dorothy to
  see him behind the bars.</p>

  <p>"Say, didn't that deputy recognize you, Cole? He sure had a funny look on
  his face when you went to the door."</p>

  <p>"He thought I'd been passing myself off for young Lawson, and he wanted to
  see if I could get away with it, I guess."</p>

  <p>"I know, I heard what he said, comin' down the hall. Say, what's he goin'
  to leave town for, if you didn't tell him where the horses is?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell, but they cross-questioned me and got enough so they think
  they can find 'em, all right. They're going to look."</p>

  <p>"Where's that?"</p>

  <p>"That's out at Harris' place." There was no reason why Shorty should not
  know, Cole reflected. It would furnish the reason why Mrs. Harris or Dorothy
  should come to visit him. "I was there, and they know I had the horses
  there." He sighed, more than half sincerely. "I wish I coulda got word out to
  Mrs. Harris," he added.</p>

  <p>"Why not the girl?" Shorty slyly hinted.</p>

  <p>"Or Dorothy. They're good friends of mine. They'd help me. Maybe they
  will, anyway," he forced himself to add hopefully. "I asked the sheriff to
  bring in my war bag so I'll have a change of clothes;
  maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You sure they're going out to-morrow?" Shorty insisted.</p>

  <p>"Well, they said so. If they do, maybe the women will think of some
  way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Shorty came over and sat down beside Cole, laying a hand on his shoulder
  with an impressive gesture.</p>

  <p>"I got a scheme that beats settin' here maybein'," he said, speaking in a
  guarded undertone. "You've been talkin' about bustin' outa here till I've got
  the itch myself to go."</p>

  <p>He got up and went to the door, looked out and listened, and came back
  again.</p>

  <p>"How?" Cole looked up at him, startled. It was the first time Shorty had
  ever shown any great interest in the idea of escape.</p>

  <p>Shorty hesitated, looking down at him. He shook his head as he seated
  himself again on the cot.</p>

  <p>"How, I ain't tellin' yet," he grinned. "You been wantin' to go so bad,
  when I do let yuh in on it, I expect you to play right up. You've got every
  reason for gettin' outa here; me, I'm all right, but I wouldn't want to stay
  here alone after you went. This afternoon showed me how I've got used to you
  around. Why, I felt like bellerin', like a cow that's lost her calf!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I didn't know I was that important."</p>

  <p>"Well, I like yuh, dawg-gone it. You're a damn' good coon-can player, and
  besides&mdash;Now, how have you been figurin' on gettin' away, once you got
  outa here? Being a stranger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd maybe find John Roper's place, and ask him for that job he
  offered me," Cole said deliberately. "I know he's no friends of Saunders, for
  he told me so. He said the sheriff stands in with a bunch of thieves that got
  away with some horses of his. I don't know anything about that&mdash;maybe I
  believed it and maybe I didn't. But whichever way it is, Roper and Saunders
  don't hit it off so good. I guess he'd kinda keep me outa sight for a while,
  don't yuh think?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I know Roper like a book. Rode for him, two round-ups. Know how to
  find his place?"</p>

  <p>Cole admitted that he did not, and Shorty grinned again.</p>

  <p>"I guess you need me in your business, kid," he dryly commented, as he got
  out his cards and seated himself cross-legged on the floor where the light
  was strongest. "Want a game?"</p>

  <p>Cole was in no mood for cards, and said so; whereupon Shorty resigned
  himself to the monotony of solitaire, spreading his cards on the floor and
  whistling absently to himself as he played endlessly, humped forward like a
  decrepit range version of Buddha, letting chances go by as the cards slip,
  slip, slipped under his thumb. Shorty's wits, too, were wool-gathering that
  night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; SHORTY SPRINGS A SURPRISE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a while Cole watched him listlessly, his thoughts
  wandering here and there over his immediate past and the ominous haze of the
  future, but occupying themselves mostly with Billy Parrish and the things he
  had said. It had been like jabbing an old bruise to see Billy, but it was
  good to hear all the news about the boys, and to know just what had been done
  to establish Cole firmly in his alibi at Seattle.</p>

  <p>Cole had written to Billy (Saunders had mysteriously furnished him with
  stationery from a cheap hotel near the water front as a convincing detail)
  and had sent various messages to the boys and a beaded watch fob for Billy
  himself. So now, having received the letter and passed it around in the Lava
  pool hall, where range men were wont to fore-gather, Black Rim was firmly
  convinced that young Cole Lawson was on his way to Alaska on board the old
  <i>City of Seattle</i>, and that he had been held up ten miles from the
  railroad and robbed of his horses and camp outfit, but had continued his
  journey nevertheless. He had not wanted Black Rim to have the laugh on him,
  he had said. He had beaten his way through on a freight train to save his
  money, and he was going to ship as a deck hand for the same reason. He darned
  the climate of Seattle just as any sagebrusher would, and had declared he was
  not coming back until he had made a stake and could buy back the old home
  ranch. He had given a very good description of the horse thief&mdash;which
  tallied closely with Cole himself&mdash;and he had begged Billy to have Ed
  Carroll get on the fellow's trail.</p>

  <p>It was a peach of a letter, Billy had declared, and now half the boys had
  the Klondike fever, and it looked as if Red and Gene might go; only they were
  debating over working through fall round-up first. Musing on the triumph of
  that epistolary hoax, Cole felt a boyish thrill of pride in his
  handiwork.</p>

  <p>Then Billy had told of a stranger rider who had appeared in Lava and
  seemed to be looking for work, though not with any great anxiety to find it.
  Since strangers were persons of especial interest to Carroll, he had quietly
  investigated this one and found that until very lately he had been a Muleshoe
  man. He had shown a suspicious interest in Black Rim affairs, Billy said, and
  although none of the boys knew there was any doubt cast up on the C Bar L
  suicide, they did not like Dirk Tracey and gave him the cold shoulder. Billy
  had described him to Cole, but without learning anything new, since Cole had
  not seen him. To Cole's instant suspicion that Tracey might be the murderer,
  Billy had replied that Carroll had established an alibi that evening for the
  fellow. He had been seen in Lava too late in the afternoon to have had any
  possible hand in the killing.</p>

  <p>"But I believe I saw the man that did it," Billy continued. "You remember
  I was riding over beyond the butte, that afternoon. As I was coming home,
  swinging around to the Lava road, I met a fellow cutting across country
  toward the butte, coming from over this way. He rode up out of a hollow and
  crossed the trail in front of me. I didn't think anything of it at the
  time&mdash;in fact, I forgot all about him till I got to working with
  Carroll. Now, after all I've heard about the layout over here, I believe he's
  the one we want. He was riding an AJ horse, and that's Roper's brand,
  according to Mr. Saunders here. The AJ had been vented, but the new brand
  wasn't clear enough for me to tell what it was, just glancing at it that way.
  It was on the left shoulder. The horse was a chestnut sorrel with a white
  nose and a white stocking on the left hind leg. When you get out, Cole, keep
  an eye open for that horse and if you see him, let Mr. Saunders know as quick
  as you can&mdash;if I ain't around. I believe that was the murderer I saw
  that day. He could ride up over the end of the butte to our fence, tie his
  horse in the bushes and come down the gulley to the back of the
  house&mdash;and not a man on the ranch know a thing about it; unless he was
  in the office," he added with dropped voice.</p>

  <p>Now, as he sat abstractedly watching the fall of the cards, Cole became
  aware of a growing temptation to ask Shorty if he knew of such a horse. There
  could be no harm in it. Cole felt fairly secure now in the part he was
  playing, and Shorty could not possibly fathom the reason for his interest. He
  might think Cole had seen and coveted the animal, or that he had seen the
  rider and was curious about him. He might think anything except the
  truth.</p>

  <p>Cole shifted his position and sighed. Should he take a chance and ask
  Shorty? Saunders had warned him to be careful, to confide in no man until he
  was given permission. But this wasn't confiding, Cole reflected. It was
  simply asking a question which any range man might plausibly ask another. He
  would say that he had seen the horse in Burroback Valley, or down beyond the
  Sinks, toward the Harris place. But perhaps he had better wait awhile. There
  was nothing to be gained now, even if Shorty could name the man for him; he
  would still be obliged to wait until Saunders came back.</p>

  <p>So he took the matter to bed and slept on the question. He milled it over
  during a long and gloomy forenoon, and decided that he would say nothing to
  Shorty about it until they were in the open&mdash;if they ever got out, which
  Cole was beginning to doubt when the time dragged so intolerably. With that,
  he picked up a magazine and tried to interest himself in a story. But between
  his eyes and the page rode the mysterious horseman on the chestnut sorrel,
  and words held no meaning whatever.</p>

  <p>"What's on your mind, Cole?" Shorty looked up from his endless game of
  solitaire. "You're full of talk as a clam, to-day."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing." Cole flung the magazine against the wall and sat up,
  reaching for his smoking material. "You know this country pretty well, don't
  you, Shorty?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Shorty countered, an ace poised in his fingers while he looked at
  Cole.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing much&mdash;only I thought you might know who rides a chestnut
  sorrel horse with a white nose, white stocking on the left hind leg, vented
  AJ brand and another one blurred."</p>

  <p>Shorty laid down the ace of clubs, picked up the deuce from one of the
  long rows before him, placed that upon the ace, releasing the trey of
  diamonds which he placed on top of its deuce; looked the layout over
  carefully for other chances to build to his aces, glanced at the deck in his
  hand, licked his thumb and slipped off three cards, then three more, and got
  the trey of clubs for his deuce.</p>

  <p>"What's that again?" he asked, glancing up at Cole. "A chestnut sorrel
  with white nose and&mdash;" he snapped a thumb and finger vexedly. "Dammit, I
  let the four of diamonds go by me; that's another one for old Sol. Gimme that
  description again, will yuh, Cole?" He swept the cards together and began to
  shuffle them idly, his eyes upon Cole's brooding face.</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;I ain't sure," he said doubtfully, when Cole had repeated the
  description. "When we make our get-away, though, I can prob'ly find out and
  let yuh know. What about it? Got your eye on that particular horse?"</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to know who rides him!"</p>

  <p>"Oh. It's the man instead of the horse you want to know about the worst.
  Well, I'll try and let yuh know. Looks like you don't get any calls to-day.
  They musta beat it outa town, all right." Shorty's voice carried a note of
  suppressed eagerness.</p>

  <p>"I guess they did. Don't you remember seeing that horse over in this
  country, Shorty?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno&mdash;what fer gaited horse? What's his build and weight?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Cole was obliged to confess, and Shorty gave a grunt and
  went back to his game.</p>

  <p>Hours passed leadenly. It grew too dark for Shorty to play, and he sat on
  the edge of his cot and smoked, just as Cole sat on the edge of his own cot
  and smoked; two silent, somber men, weary of inaction and their own thoughts,
  lacking that perfect confidence which would have permitted unguarded
  conversation. Silence and brooding thought.</p>

  <p>The light in the corridor snapped on, and Dick came whistling down past
  the empty cells on either side. Now he was looking in, their supper borne on
  one arm. Shorty got up, walked lazily forward as Dick unlocked the door, and
  pulled it open.</p>

  <p>"Welcome as the flowers in May!" drawled Shorty, yawning and stretching
  his arms upward as Dick came in.</p>

  <p>Dick grinned, stooped a little, setting down his burden, and Shorty's
  right fist came down with stunning force against Dick's ear. The coffee
  tilted perilously as Dick crumpled at the knees, but Shorty saved it from
  spilling more than a few spoonfuls. As the guard rolled over on the floor,
  Shorty bent and pulled the gun from its holster on Dick's belt.</p>

  <p>"Hand me your handkerchief, Cole. I oughta blow the son of a gun's brains
  out&mdash;but the sound might carry." Shorty's voice was cool, unhurried as
  if he were vocally debating the wisdom of using a certain card. He stood up,
  looking at Cole. "Well, the way's open," he said quizzically. "You've been
  belly-achin' to git outa here; now come on!"</p>

  <p>"I never wanted to go out that way, by half killing a man when he wasn't
  looking." Nevertheless, Cole gave Shorty his big silk handkerchief, and stood
  looking down at the limp and apparently lifeless Dick.</p>

  <p>"You won't go out no other way, till you're let out," Shorty replied
  grimly. "Jail doors don't blow open with the wind, far as I ever heard." He
  was tying Dick's wrists together behind his back and including a leg of the
  stationary cot in the bond. Dick's own handkerchief served for a gag, and
  Dick's gun belt fitted very nicely around Shorty's middle. Now he hurriedly
  filled his pocket with bread, gulped down a few swallows of coffee and looked
  at Cole.</p>

  <p>"Well, if Saunders don't meet us walkin' out, we'll be in the clear before
  yuh know it," he said calmly. "Get your hat and coat, wherever they are, and
  come on. You don't need a gun; we're goin' among friends."</p>

  <p>Cole hesitated, looking down at the unconscious man on the floor. A vivid
  recollection of that other terrible figure lying at his feet not so long ago
  turned him white and sick. The brutality of the thing repelled him, made him
  almost hate Shorty who stood there in the door waiting for him.</p>

  <p>The feeling passed. There was work for him outside, and as Shorty had
  said, the way was open. But he wanted a gun&mdash;Shorty did not know how
  terribly important it might be for Cole to have a weapon. He followed Shorty
  out of the cell and down the corridor, turned aside into the office and armed
  himself. A minute later the two walked boldly out of the front door, stopped
  to light cigarettes in the dusk&mdash;their eyes glancing this way and that
  along the street as they did so&mdash;and went their way along the trail that
  led to the sheriff's stable. If they were observed it was without suspicion,
  and if Shorty was recognized, no one questioned his right to be abroad. But
  at that hour the little town of Crater was eating its various suppers and the
  street was nearly empty. Afterward no one remembered even seeing them
  leave.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; "I GOT HIM IN A CELL&mdash;&mdash;"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOUR quiet-mannered, hard-faced men followed Ed Carroll down
  the steps of the midnight train from the East when it stopped at Crater for
  water. One by one, four sacked saddles followed the limp mail sack to the
  station platform. Up the track in the starlight the big engine gasped and
  drank thirstily for its climb over the mountains, and stared with its one
  brilliant eye down the track toward the stockyards. Down in the little town a
  dog barked in a shrill, tireless monotone, but otherwise the seat of Crater
  County's government gave no sign of life or betrayed any interest whatever in
  through trains. The night operator came out with the train orders whipping in
  his fingers, distributed the thin sheets of paper to engineer and conductor,
  picked up the mail sack and went in where it was warmer&mdash;for even in
  late summer the nights can be nippy in that high altitude, and the wind that
  crept down off High Trail was keen and searching.</p>

  <p>"I guess Saunders didn't get my wire," Carroll remarked to the man nearest
  him, and peered all up and down the platform. "We better go right on over, I
  guess&mdash;unless you boys 'd rather go to the hotel. I guess that's what we
  better do; get four or five hours' sleep, anyway, and have a good long day
  before us to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"What'll we do with our saddles?" one thin man perfunctorily inquired.
  "Leave 'em here, or take 'em with us?"</p>

  <p>"Better take 'em along," another advised, as he selected one and
  shouldered it. "Me, I like to keep my ridin' gear right where I can get at
  it."</p>

  <p>"Punchers coming in to work on round-up," the night operator mentally
  identified the group that straggled off down the street into town. "Wish I
  was one of them; this inside work&mdash;&mdash;" He watched them enviously,
  for they walked in a glow of swift-moving adventure conjured in panoramas by
  his own longing. He saw them galloping far and free over the hills, or
  scurrying here and there in the valleys, "working" herds of cattle driven
  down from the high summer grazing grounds. He saw them laughing around camp
  fires, sleeping rolled in their blankets, their faces to the stars.</p>

  <p>He saw them as they were not, but that is the way with men who carry the
  tang of romance in their blood. The night operator had spent one summer on a
  cattle ranch and hurt his side so that he had to give up the life and go back
  to brass-pounding; and a range hat and high-heeled boots would always spell
  round-ups to him.</p>

  <p>The five whom he envied clumped into the hotel where a dim light shone in
  the office. They did not talk of round-ups; they did not talk of anything but
  beds and early breakfasts, and when they trailed after the sleepy landlord to
  their rooms they went wearily, with nothing whatever to say, except:</p>

  <p>"Well, see yuh in the morning," from Carroll, as he turned in a
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;call me if I don't show up," from the man who wanted his
  saddle handy.</p>

  <p>If the others spoke at all no one heard them. And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>The man who wanted his saddle was an ex-ranger from Texas, as was the
  other one with black eyes and hair, who drawled in his speech. The short man
  with a pudgy nose and small, pinched-in mouth had a record as long as his arm
  in Montana, and the little fellow with face like a hawk was Carroll's star
  trailer and sic'em deputy. At least, Carroll called Frost his sic'em deputy.
  The night operator who loafed up in the station and dreamed of round-ups
  would have thrilled to his toes had he known who those nocturnal travelers in
  the high-heeled boots really were.</p>

  <p>They rose at dawn and trailed Carroll silently to a restaurant which
  catered to early birds like themselves, and they drank black coffee with more
  than a plenty of sugar, ate ham and eggs and hot biscuits and syrup, and had
  nothing whatever to say. The day thus begun as it should be, with plenty of
  fuel for their energies which might be needed almost any time, they followed
  Carroll across the street to the county jail, where Bill Saunders slept in a
  meager room adjoining the office.</p>

  <p>His eyes bloodshot from loss of sleep and riding in the wind, Bill
  Saunders stood in the middle of the office and stared in bovine calm from one
  to the other of his early visitors. Frost he knew. Tex Allen he had seen in a
  courtroom. The other two were briefly introduced, and his eyes said that he
  had heard of them.</p>

  <p>"Parrish is in bed yet, I guess," he volunteered in his rumbling voice,
  looking at Carroll. "Made a little trip yesterday, and didn't get in till
  about two this morning. He's stopping over at the hotel. Want me
  to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll go get him," the little hawk-faced man offered, and was gone.</p>

  <p>If Saunders was curious, he did not say so. He had the air of waiting for
  court to open; but he didn't wait long, for Billy came, unwashed and
  uncombed, and hitching up his belt as he walked. He, too, was curious, but
  unlike Saunders he looked it.</p>

  <p>"Now, I guess we're all set. You didn't get my wire, Bill?"</p>

  <p>Saunders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No matter. I didn't say anything, except that I was coming. Well, these
  men, Tex and Charley Couch, have been workin' on the case off and on for a
  year. I told you, Bill, I had men out. Frosty and Nathe have been on it since
  Lawson was killed, and Parrish I deputized and sent up here to look after the
  kid while we got ready to spring the trap." Carroll paused, apparently
  wanting to condense his information as much as possible and finding it
  difficult with such a wealth of interesting details in his mind.</p>

  <p>"We've got the connection, all right, between Roper's gang and Lawson.
  Roper is just the local head over here&mdash;the real boss lives in Kansas
  City, and the officers back there are pullin' in the slack on him, so all
  we've got to clear up is our own end of it. Well, it's a jumbled-up mess of
  stolen stock shipped out with the C Bar L beef, and other stock that Lawson
  had bought&mdash;all told I guess they got into old Cole pretty deep before
  he caught on. After that, it seems they tried to blackmail him in a quiet
  kinda way. There was considerable arguin' back and forth, and it looks like
  old Cole had visitors in his office more 'n once that the C Bar L didn't know
  anything about. But that's neither here nor there. What we're workin' on now
  is that last caller he had."</p>

  <p>"You get him, yet?" Billy Parrish was showing impatience.</p>

  <p>"We expect to get him. Dirk Tracey has been trailed to the Muleshoe and
  from there to Roper's place&mdash;a spy in camp comes in handy sometimes. We
  also," he added slowly, "know who it was you met that day, Billy, riding that
  AJ horse. We know his name and we've got his description and we know he's a
  Roper man. We came over to pick him up before he gets outa the country, and
  we came in a bunch, because we want the rest of the gang too."</p>

  <p>"Count me in," said Billy, and Carroll nodded.</p>

  <p>"The way we've got it doped, this fellow didn't go over there expecting to
  kill Lawson. If he had, he'd have been a little more careful not to meet
  anybody on the way, and he would have had a knife, most likely&mdash;if he
  was crazy enough to kill a man in his own house with men on the ranch that
  was liable to come in any minute almost. He probably went over with some
  message from Roper, asking for something, most likely. You know old Cole,
  Billy. Get him pushed just about so far, and he'd out-balk a government
  mule.</p>

  <p>"Must have been something like that took place that night, and this fellow
  lost his temper. I figure that he struck Cole and knocked him down. Then,
  either he was scared of what old Cole would do when he got up, or the gang
  wanted him outa the way anyhow and he thought this was a good chance&mdash;he
  grabbed Lawson's gun and shot him in the mouth. He knew it would pass for
  suicide; or he had every reason in the world to think it would. Here was that
  mortgage foreclosed&mdash;it was the first thing any one would think of.
  Things had come to a show-down, it looks like.</p>

  <p>"But the fellow slipped up on one thing; he didn't know old Cole was
  left-handed, and he didn't have time to stop and figure out where the bullet
  would land. So we nailed the suicide idea right there, and when I got to
  prowling around I found out some other things. That fellow you met on the AJ
  horse, Billy&mdash;did you notice the size of his feet?"</p>

  <p>"No-o, I don't believe I did, Ed."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess you wouldn't, just meeting him on horseback that way. Don't
  matter&mdash;I've got the horse checked, and I know who owns him. First, I
  took particular notice of the tracks into the gulley and on up to the fence.
  A tall man made 'em, by the length of his steps, and I bet I could pretty
  near guess the size of his boots too."</p>

  <p>"He over in this county, Ed?" Saunders had come to life and was watching
  Carroll's face unblinkingly.</p>

  <p>"He's over in this county somewhere, or he should be. We know he left the
  Black Rim country the night of the murder, and was riding this way, and that
  he belongs here. He oughta be here yet, because it's never got out that we
  know Lawson didn't commit suicide. He's a tall man, five foot ten, anyway. By
  the size of his tracks, I'd say he wears about a number five boot. Unless
  he's left the country&mdash;he might have got scared out, thinking the kid
  was on some kind of a clue&mdash;he ought to be easy to locate. Know anybody
  over here, Bill, named Shorty McGuire?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nathe, here, heard something that led him to believe the man's name is
  Shorty McGuire. Is he tall and got little feet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sheriff Saunders got out of his chair as if he had been stung.</p>

  <p>"You don't need any posse to catch <i>him</i>, Ed. I don't know the horse,
  but Shorty's back here in a cell, servin' a sixty-day sentence for petty
  larceny."</p>

  <p>"How long has he been in? Was he at large when Lawson was killed?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh&mdash;no alibi there. I made the arrest on the sixteenth of
  June."</p>

  <p>"Lawson was killed on the twelfth. He didn't know that Cole was over in
  this country, probably."</p>

  <p>"Guess not. He was here in Crater, drinkin' and gamblin' and havin' a good
  time, and he stole a rifle and watch from the blacksmith down the road. Too
  drunk to get outa town with the stuff&mdash;picked him up in a saloon with
  the watch in his pocket. Cheap watch, and the rifle wasn't much account
  either, so sixty days is all he got. Used to ride for Roper, but I don't know
  what he's been doing the last few months; never saw him around much till
  lately, when he got into trouble."</p>

  <p>Billy Parrish swore a sudden oath and caught Saunders by the arm.</p>

  <p>"He that fellow you've got in there with Cole?" Billy's voice was harsh
  with dismay.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I ain't no mind reader&mdash;how was I to know? Time Shorty was
  taken in, I didn't even know Lawson was murdered." Saunders turned at the
  office door and faced them. "I don't know as I'd tell the kid, for a while
  yet," he said slowly. "I'll go get Shorty and you can question him, Ed. If
  he's the one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's the one, all right," Carroll snapped. "Nathe has checked his moves.
  I'm ready to make the arrest any time."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh," Saunders assented, and started down the corridor. Billy Parrish
  followed him, wanting to see Cole. Carroll and his men stayed where they
  were, quietly waiting until they were needed; they did not waste their
  energies, those seasoned hunters of men.</p>

  <p>But they did look up with some interest when Saunders came striding in,
  half dragging Dick, still bound and with the gag hanging around his neck.</p>

  <p>"Guess you'll want your possy after all, Ed," puffed Saunders. "Shorty
  laid Dick out last night and got away. He must have found out something. Dick
  says it was Shorty that knocked him out&mdash;and Cole's gone with him!"</p>

  <p>The four quiet men who had nothing to say rose and looked at big Ed
  Carroll while they hitched up their belts. Now at last they were interested,
  for here was work for them to do and they were ready to start.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; AN HONEST RANCHER IS ROPER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">COLE lifted his head and gazed long at the sky, taking
  great, lingering breaths of the night air that felt cool on his face as water
  drawn from a deep well in summer, and as refreshing, after the stale air of
  indoors. Never had the evening star seemed so bright, nor red Mars following
  so close. He had almost forgotten how the Big Dipper looked, and the Milky
  Way he was sure had grown broader and longer since last he saw it. Freedom
  sang in his blood like old wine, and the shadowy heights of the mountain at
  his right were like brooding giants standing on guard to give him safe
  conduct through the night. Even the keen impatience of Eagle for a mad run
  along the sandy road thrilled him, made him want to whoop and swing his hat
  high over his head and go racing away down the valley.</p>

  <p>But Shorty, riding rather grimly beside him, set the pace at an easy lope;
  so, however much Eagle might toss his head and rattle the bit in his teeth,
  Cole must hold him in. He had no idea how far they would have to ride that
  night; but after what happened to Dick in the cell Cole thought that Shorty
  would ride until he was safe&mdash;especially since he had the sheriff's
  extra horse between his knees. Once Cole turned his head and looked at
  Shorty, and thought that he did not seem highly elated over his escape. Cole
  suspected that Shorty had made that reckless break for liberty not so much
  for his own sake as for Cole's.</p>

  <p>In that, of course, Cole was right; though he did not dream of the
  sinister purpose behind Shorty's bold performance.</p>

  <p>"We turn off here and take to open country," Shorty said, after they had
  ridden a mile or two beyond town. "Don't want to meet the sheriff comin'
  home, and this is the trail he'll probably take."</p>

  <p>Cole did not so much mind meeting the sheriff, but he could not tell
  Shorty that. And, of course, there was Shorty to protect&mdash;Cole had to
  think of that, too. But after this job was done and the Roper gang was safe
  in jail, he hoped Saunders would be grateful enough to let Shorty down easy.
  Cole did not want to see him get in any trouble over this night's work; he
  had come to like Shorty, and he did not believe he was one of the gang or
  ever had been.</p>

  <p>What Shorty thought on that long, silent ride, no man can say.</p>

  <p>Where they went or how many miles they rode, Cole never knew. Shorty was
  taking the lead, and Shorty knew the way; Cole's mind was taken up with other
  things&mdash;with the millions of stars that were like old friends from whom
  he had long been parted, and the pleasure of being safe in the saddle once
  more. But when the first intoxication of his sudden liberty had passed, Cole
  began to think more soberly of what lay before him, and what he should say
  and do when he came face to face with Roper and Pete.</p>

  <p>Ed Carroll and Saunders had entrusted him with a very important bit of
  detective work, and he was anxious to make no blunder and to overlook no
  clue, however slight. He wished that he dared confide in Shorty, who would
  probably be able to tell him a lot that he needed to know; but until he was
  absolutely certain of Shorty he must be careful. Carroll had tried hard to
  impress upon him the salient truth that silence seldom does any one any harm,
  but careless speech had plunged nations into war before now; though that is
  not exactly the manner in which Carroll expressed himself. Cole was recalling
  that warning when Shorty spoke out of a long silence.</p>

  <p>"That AJ sorrel&mdash;what was it you want to know about him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd like to know who owns him and rides him."</p>

  <p>"S'posin' I know 'im&mdash;or think I do. S'posin' he's a friend of mine.
  Any reason why I oughta tell? It's nothing that's liable to git him into
  trouble, is it?"</p>

  <p>Cole lied, but he waited too long before he could bring himself to it. He
  might as well have said yes instead of no, for all the conviction the denial
  carried.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know for, then?"</p>

  <p>"Curiosity, I guess." It was a lame reply, but Cole could think of nothing
  better to say.</p>

  <p>"Curiosity killed the cat," Shorty reminded him with slow irony.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to see him and have a talk with him, then." Cole felt as if
  he were being pushed into a corner. "He knows something I want to find out;
  or, at least, I was told that he does. If I could see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who told yuh? That Black Rim deputy?" Shorty's face was turned toward
  him, but in the darkness Cole could not read its expression. "If you want to
  get anything outa me, old-timer, you might as well come clean. Was it that
  deputy?"</p>

  <p>"Something he said, yes." Cole was forced to choose his words carefully
  now. "He thought I knew something I didn't know. I guess he thought he'd get
  a lot outa me that he didn't get. And while he was talking and beating around
  the bush he mentioned this fellow on the AJ horse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did, huh?" Shorty commented softly. "What did he say, kid?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. Just enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, get to the point. Is he tryin' to locate the fellow?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. No, I guess not. He'd just met him, is all, somewhere that
  he thought I'd been. I wasn't there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where was that? Over in the Black Rim country? Over at the C Bar L,
  say?"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think I meant&mdash;over there? I never
  said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was C Bar L horses you stole, wasn't it? Or that he thinks you stole,
  we'll say. He's a Black Rim man&mdash;you said so, and Saunders said so. Why
  wouldn't I think it was over there he saw him?"</p>

  <p>Cole shook his head in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Looks like you're the one that wants to find out something," he charged
  boldly. "If I was to start in and tell you all I know, you'd be as wise as I
  am, Shorty&mdash;and I might find myself in the middle of a damn' bad fix.
  Maybe you know the man I want to locate and maybe you don't, but I sure ain't
  going to trade information, sight unseen. I've got too much at stake."</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way&mdash;you will, anyhow," Shorty yielded
  indifferently. "We go single file from here on, and you want to stick close
  behind my horse, or you're liable to get lost."</p>

  <p>This reminded Cole sharply of one other time not so long ago when he had
  followed a man in the dark, and the comparison struck him unpleasantly. So
  far as he could see in the starlight, they were descending a rough slope into
  a dry river bed, but whether this was another part of the Sinks he did not
  know and he would not ask. He had not liked Shorty's tone and manner when the
  AJ horse was being discussed, and he began to feel that he had told too much,
  perhaps. After all, Shorty had been a Roper man&mdash;and the fellow Billy
  Parrish had met must have been another. Very likely Shorty had told the plain
  truth when he hinted that the man was a friend of his.</p>

  <p>Still, Cole did not suspect the truth, though he was put upon his guard
  and gave more attention to the route they were following. It did not help him
  much, for they merely crossed the river bed and climbed the farther bank, and
  after that they plunged into a labyrinth of gulches and rocky defiles quite
  as puzzling as had been that maze of rock ledges in the Sinks. They seemed to
  be climbing slowly, for now and then they rode out upon narrow ridges which
  gave Cole a vague impression of wide vistas and of mountains in the
  distance.</p>

  <p>Nothing is so baffling perhaps as night riding in strange country. Cole
  was so certain that they had penetrated deeply into almost inaccessible
  country that he was astonished when dawn came and showed him wide, wooded
  pasture land all about him, and in the middle distance a snug cluster of
  stables and corrals set close up against a low ridge, with trees and a
  fair-sized pond and a grassy meadow just beyond. They were riding out from
  among low hills, he saw, when he looked back, but before him all was open and
  innocent looking and only moderately prosperous. More like the Harris ranch
  than the C Bar L, for instance; more like the place one would expect John
  Roper to own, if one heard and believed what he had said to Mother
  Harris.</p>

  <p>"Well, here we are, kid," said Shorty, and kicked the sheriff's horse into
  a lope. "Hope breakfast's ready, but I don't see no smoke&mdash;maybe John's
  away somewhere." He turned his head and his mild blue eyes met Cole's
  questioning look with perfect frankness and the friendly air which had first
  won Cole to liking him.</p>

  <p>"What yuh so big-eyed about?" he grinned. "You been here before, ain't
  yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Not right to the ranch," Cole admitted. "Is this Roper's place?"</p>

  <p>"Well," drawled Shorty, "I guess he pays taxes on it, anyway. Don't see
  any stir around&mdash;there's the dogs, though."</p>

  <p>Deep-baying hounds of some powerful cross breed came charging down upon
  them, four great brutes that looked capable of dragging down a full-grown
  bull. Shorty forced his horse forward and rode to meet them, calling them by
  name and cursing them affectionately for the noise they made, and presently
  they were leaping playfully about him, paying no attention to Cole.</p>

  <p>"You ride up here alone and you wouldn't get very close," Shorty threw
  over his shoulder. "You'd have to shoot all the dogs first. But they're all
  right when they know yuh. Git down and pull your saddle. Ma Roper ain't up
  yet, I guess, and John and the boys are gone; but that's all
  right&mdash;we'll git our own breakfast."</p>

  <p>While they were unsaddling at the corral nearest the stable, Cole stared
  furtively around him, feeling slightly crestfallen, if the truth were told.
  It was not the kind of place he expected to see, in spite of Mother Harris'
  assurance that John Roper was an honest rancher. Saunders too had told him
  the same thing, and now the ranch itself gave evidence of the truth of it. On
  the surface, at least, Roper was as thrifty and hard-working and law-abiding
  a man as any in Idaho. Barring the dogs, there was nothing whatever out of
  the ordinary. There was even a Mrs. Roper to further emphasize the air of
  respectability of the home.</p>

  <p>"That you, Shorty?" she called now from an upstairs window, as they were
  walking up to the kitchen. "Start a fire and put on the teakettle, and I'll
  be right down. John went to town, and I don't know where the boys are, but
  they'll be back some time to-day."</p>

  <p>The head disappeared, and Cole followed Shorty into the summer kitchen,
  wondering whether he had made a fool of himself after all. He could not
  associate John Roper, as he believed him to be, with a gray-haired wife and a
  house that stood wide open to any chance rider who strayed that way.</p>

  <p>He continued to wonder, all through the preparation of breakfast, which
  Shorty helped to cook. He sat watching the thin and energetic Ma Roper
  bestirring herself to set the table for three, while Shorty sliced
  cold-boiled potatoes into one frying pan and broke fresh-laid eggs into
  another where bacon was frying. Stealing and killing did not seem to jibe
  with this homely life. He wished Billy Parrish were there with him; he seemed
  to want Billy's opinion and advice more than he had ever wanted them before
  in his life.</p>

  <p>If Ma Roper knew that Shorty had been in jail and should, by the mandate
  of the court, be there still, she did not mention the fact or express any
  surprise or curiosity over his sudden appearance. If she wondered who Cole
  was and what was his business there, she kept her speculations to herself.
  She wanted to know all the gossip of Crater, however, and manifested a lively
  interest in the affairs of her neighbors. She seemed a garrulous old lady,
  and her bread was sour. Beyond that, Cole felt, when the meal was done, that
  he knew very little about Ma Roper and that he cared less. She was not in the
  least like Mother Harris, at any rate. He carried away from the house with
  him the impression that she bore no very good will toward the world in
  general and that she had no sympathy for the troubles of other folk, but how
  he got that impression he could not have told.</p>

  <p>"We might as well bunk down and get some sleep," Shorty suggested when
  they had left the house. "The dogs'll likely wake us up if anybody comes.
  Stake yourself to a bed in there, Cole. This tent looks purty good to
  me."</p>

  <p>Cole nodded and entered a cabin with three beds, and laid himself down on
  the cleanest, suddenly realizing that he was tired and sleepy, and that he
  was glad Roper was not at home. He wanted to think things out before he went
  any further, because he could see that the task he had set himself would not
  be so simple, after all.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; SHORTY WANTS THE TRUTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HOURS after that, Cole awoke, for the simple reason that a
  fly sat down upon his nose to whet its legs and wash its face&mdash;or
  whatever it is that flies do when they begin to prink and preen themselves. A
  swipe of his hand settled that performance and the fly decided to adjourn to
  the open air. On its way out, it met Shorty who was up and had come quietly
  to the doorway to make certain observations of his own.</p>

  <p>"You 'sleep, Cole?" he asked cheerfully, seeing Cole lying there upon his
  side with one arm thrown over his face.</p>

  <p>Cole was not, but he expected to be in about three minutes, and he did not
  want the interval prolonged by Shorty or any one else, so he gave no sign
  whatever that he heard. The ruse was successful. In a minute he heard Shorty
  walking away, and after a time of diminishing footsteps he heard the screen
  door slam, so he knew that Shorty had gone up to the house.</p>

  <p>Cole lay still for a moment longer, trying to woo back the dream which the
  fly had interrupted. Instead, it seemed to him that the walls of the jail
  were closing inexorably around him; he felt stifled, shut in away from the
  outside world, trapped, somehow; and the next thing he knew he was sitting up
  on the edge of the bed, feeling for the gun he had taken from the sheriff's
  room.</p>

  <p>Full consciousness came with the feel of the checked and embossed grip of
  the weapon, but reassurance failed to come with it. He still felt as if he
  were in a trap, and that if he meant to get out before the jaws closed upon
  him with a final snap, he had better be quick about it; a hang-over from his
  late captivity, no doubt, but the feeling was strong enough to send him to
  the window that looked down toward the stables.</p>

  <p>No one was in sight anywhere. Eagle and the sheriff's horse dozed in the
  corral, and a white hen was walking up the ridge of a haystack just beyond.
  Cole watched her for a minute. Then he straddled out over the window sill and
  went down there. Just why he should keep the cabin between himself and the
  house he did not explain, but since he had no definite suspicion of Shorty,
  he probably wanted merely to make sure of being left to himself. He was not
  sleepy after all, he discovered, but he still wanted to be left alone so that
  he could think.</p>

  <p>The haystack offered itself to him as a most attractive retreat, and he
  made for it directly, without even the dogs' interference. The white hen had
  settled herself in some deep nest on the peak and he did not even disturb her
  as he climbed up to where one end of the stack had been cut down to feed the
  stabled horses when Roper and his men were at home. The platform thus left at
  the end farthest from the house was perhaps six feet from the ground, and it
  was in the shade, moreover. Cole sank into a pile of loose hay with a deep
  sigh of content. Here, at least, he need not be on his guard, nor need he
  fear interruption to his thoughts.</p>

  <p>But if he thought he was going to meditate deeply and wisely on the
  subject of John Roper he was mistaken, for straightway he began to think of
  that day when he pitched hay for Mother Harris; from there he began to think
  of Dorothy, and thinking of her he fell asleep again, while pleasantly
  engaged in painting mental pictures among the clouds that drifted lazily
  overhead. So the youth of him dominated once more over the man of him, and
  the meaning hidden deep in the eyes of a girl held his thoughts from dwelling
  just then upon the trail of a murderer.</p>

  <p>To a casual mind it may seem that Cole Lawson did a great deal of
  eavesdropping at one time or another during this period of his life. But even
  in the range land men do talk together when they meet, and&mdash;because
  their work is such that they must do most of their talking in the open air
  and frequently amidst the noise of the herds&mdash;their voices gain a
  carrying quality not found among city men, who speak more often in the
  immediate neighborhood of strangers. At any rate, Cole had unthinkingly
  planted himself in an excellent position for eavesdropping when Roper rode
  home and began to unsaddle his horse; which he did, after Cole had spent an
  hour or so asleep in the hay.</p>

  <p>Shorty had evidently seen him approach and came down to meet him, or had
  been warned by the clamor of the dogs, for Cole heard voices and the barking
  of dogs almost simultaneously. Roper swore at the dogs and they shut up at
  once. It was this which brought Cole to his senses and reminded him of the
  fact that he would be called upon now to use all the brains God had given him
  and all the courage as well. But before he made himself known to Roper he
  wanted to hear what these two would have to say to each other when no one
  else was by. He listened deliberately.</p>

  <p>Roper was naturally astonished to see Shorty, and Shorty made short work
  of his escape. That part did not greatly interest Cole, though the next
  sentence did.</p>

  <p>"I brought along the fellow that shot Steve," said Shorty. "No, listen,
  John. He's in the cabin poundin' his ear, and I want to talk to you. There's
  some damn' funny work goin' on, up there at Crater, and I hit off down here
  to put you wise."</p>

  <p>"And put Saunders on your trail down here," Roper said nastily. "If he
  comes here after yuh, Shorty, I'll turn yuh over to him. I ain't goin' to get
  in bad with the sheriff's office, for you or no one else."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, maybe you'll change your mind about that, John, when I tell
  yuh. A C Bar L man come over to Crater day before yesterday, claimin' to be a
  deputy sheriff. Maybe he is. He come to claim them horses Cole's got, or did
  have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know all about that, and all the how and whyfor," Roper again
  interrupted. "Dirk's just come back from over there. Seems young Lawson had
  them horses stole from him. He's in Seattle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like hell he's in Seattle! This feller I got with me is him. I knew it,
  the minute that C Bar L man stepped up to the door and looked at him. Went
  off down the hall together, thick as thieves. They're cookin' up something,
  John. They're wise."</p>

  <p>"Wise to what?" Roper's tone was a challenge. "If they're wise to
  anything, I know who to thank for it, Shorty. You put your foot it in when
  you done what you done&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hell, blame <i>me</i>, will yuh?" Defiance and contempt vibrated in the
  voice of Shorty McGuire. "You sent me over there to shut old Lawson's mouth,
  and I <i>shut</i> it, damn yuh! Now, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, you should have stayed right there in jail. It was the safest place
  in the country for yuh."</p>

  <p>"Oh, was it? Not with that fellow I met that day, over here hobnobbin'
  with Saunders&mdash;and not with this damn' kid bonin' me about the horse I
  rode over there. They're cookin' up somethin', I tell yuh."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I aim to find out," said Shorty with cold malevolence.</p>

  <p>"Think this kid knows anything about it? Looks to me, Shorty, as if you
  kinda went off half-cocked. Dirk read the letter young Lawson wrote back from
  Seattle, describin' this feller over here. Dirk knows the Coast, and he said
  it's a dead cinch this feller stole young Lawson's horses and outfit and put
  off over here. If they sent a man over here after 'em, that only bears out
  what Dirk says. He read the letter, mind yuh, and the description. He knows
  what boat young Lawson was takin' north. You can ask him if yuh like, soon as
  he comes up from the Sinks. Bart had it all wrong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Shorty grimly, "it's about time I come and put yuh
  all wise. It's a frame-up, I tell yuh. Hell, I've been watchin' this kid, and
  I <i>know</i>. Why, he described my horse to the last hair in his tail.
  Dirk's a damn' fool, that's all."</p>

  <p>"If you mean that sorrel horse you got off me, you've rode him
  considerable, Shorty. Black Rim ain't the only place you rode him&mdash;but
  that was one place, you damn' fool, where you should've rode a horse that
  wouldn't be spotted as yours first thing. You got the jumps, looks to me."
  Roper gave a laugh that was in itself an affront to any self-respecting man.
  "We had this kid lined up wrong. He stole them horses off young Cole Lawson,
  I tell yuh. His showin' up at the Muleshoe was just a bad break&mdash;or else
  he aimed to let on like he was Lawson, an' got cold feet afterwards. Bart put
  me on the wrong trail. Now, here you come, like a&mdash;damn' fool, gettin'
  us all in bad with Saunders. Or yuh would, if I'd let yuh. What you better
  do, Shorty, is go on back to jail and take the kid with yuh."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will&mdash;<i>not</i>! I tell yuh, he's Cole Lawson! Gimme half an
  hour with 'im, and I'll prove it to yuh."</p>

  <p>This apparently impressed Roper, for there was a pause before he answered.
  Cole was afraid to look, lest he rattle the hay and betray his position, but
  he listened, holding his breath that he might not lose a word.</p>

  <p>"How d' you expect to prove it, Shorty?" Roper asked at last.</p>

  <p>"I'll string the damn' traitor up by the thumbs and make him come clean,"
  Shorty said, a hideous expectance in his tone. "What 'n hell d' yuh think I
  brought him along for? I couldn't go at him in jail, could I? I'll get it all
  out of him, or I'll skin 'im as I would a coyote."</p>

  <p>"If he ain't young Lawson&mdash;&mdash;" Roper was cautious, weighing all
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>"If he ain't," Shorty impatiently pointed out, "nobody's goin' to miss
  him; a horse thief that's broke jail is better off dead, anyhow. If he
  is&mdash;and I know damn' well he is&mdash;I'll kill the&mdash;for tryin' to
  run a rannigan on me."</p>

  <p>"You'll pull the roof down on your head, Shorty. There's times for that,
  and other times&mdash;like old Cole, now. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I what?"</p>

  <p>"You took a risk you wasn't justified in takin'. Dirk says there ain't a
  whisper of doubt; but there might've been. Dirk says we're all in the clear
  over there, and we can just as well ferget it and go on about our own
  business. <i>You're</i> the one that's liable to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cut out the compliments, John. I'm the one that <i>knows</i>. And while
  we're on the subject, John, don't get the idea that I'm goin' to give you a
  chance to bump <i>me</i> off. I thought that all over on the way down here. I
  don't trust yuh a damned inch, if you want to know how I feel. But this is
  your funeral as much as it's mine, you want to remember. You goin' along to
  help me git the truth outa that kid, or ain't yuh?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">XXVII. &mdash; COLE SETTLES IT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU don't need any help! Put up your hands, both of you!"
  Suddenly exploding into a fury that startled even himself, Cole came off the
  stack and faced them, gun in hand and finger trembling on the trigger. "I'm
  Cole Lawson, all right, if that's what's worrying you, Shorty. You&mdash;you
  snake!"</p>

  <p>This, because Shorty's hand had darted toward the gun hanging in its
  holster. Cole fired, and the hand jerked upward, scattering red drops that
  became a small stream.</p>

  <p>"You too, Roper. Get your hands up, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Roper's hands went up, but he whistled and the dogs came bounding down
  from the house, barking and yelping with what sounded to Cole like savage
  anticipation. Shorty was reaching for his gun with his left hand. Cole
  stopped that with grim completeness and snatched the gun from its holster as
  the foremost dog came up.</p>

  <p>"Call off your dogs, Roper, or I'll have to kill 'em," he yelled. "I don't
  want to&mdash;they're more human than you are. Quick!"</p>

  <p>Roper gave him one evil glance, looked at Shorty who was staggering away
  with one shattered hand and a broken arm, and hesitated. Already the leader
  of the pack was standing ready, teeth bared and hair lifted on neck and
  shoulders, waiting to leap. A dog more or less&mdash;what did it matter? It
  would give him a chance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Git 'im, Wolf!" snarled Roper, and the dog sprang.</p>

  <p>So did Cole, for that matter, and dodged the impact of the big brute's
  body as he fired point-blank at Roper, who already had his gun out. Roper
  took two jerky steps backward and went down; the sheriff's guns were good
  ones, thought Cole, as he whirled to defend himself from the pack.</p>

  <p>It was not pretty work, that. Cole loved dogs. But these were savage
  beasts, taught to kill when their master commanded, and now that master was
  down and frenziedly urging them on&mdash;to their death, as he must have
  known; for it was Cole's life or the dogs'.</p>

  <p>More than once he felt their hot breath in his face as they leaped for his
  throat and fell back. More than once their fangs sliced into his flesh and
  came away with fragments of cloth which they flung aside.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you ought to be shot, yourself!" blazed Cole, with tears of
  excitement and rage in his voice, when it was over and Roper was left cursing
  impotently on the ground. "You could've stopped them! You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For pity's sake, what <i>is</i> this&mdash;a slaughter yard? Why, Cole!"
  Mother Harris and Dorothy, having started for Crater that morning early,
  decided to stop at John Roper's ranch on the way, and see if they could learn
  anything about Steve and what he was doing; or perhaps they might even be
  able to pick up a little information of use to Sheriff Saunders, who had told
  them a most amazing story about Cole.</p>

  <p>They had driven up in the midst of the tumult of howling and barking and
  worrying, with men's voices shouting unintelligible curses, punctuated by the
  vicious crack of gun shots. Just as soon as Dorothy could tie old Joe, who
  would not "stand," they had come running around the end of the stable to see
  what dreadful things were happening.</p>

  <p>They saw Cole standing threateningly beside Roper, who was half lying on
  the ground and looking sick. Dogs seemed to be lying about promiscuously, and
  Cole's shirt was half torn off him and his arms were all bloody, and his face
  was convulsed with rage and pain. He turned his head and stared at them as if
  he had never seen them before in his life.</p>

  <p>"Where's Shorty? See anything of Shorty McGuire? I can't let <i>him</i>
  get away, the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, are you thinking of killing him, too?" Dorothy had recovered her
  voice, while her mother was still gasping in speechless astonishment.</p>

  <p>Her voice brought Cole to his senses. He started toward them, walking
  groggily, his gun hanging loosely in his hand and breathing faint wisps of
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"Shorty&mdash;I've got to find Shorty&mdash;&mdash;" He halted, looking
  dully around him and swaying a little as he stood. "He&mdash;he mustn't get
  to the rest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mustn't get to John Roper's men, you mean?" Dorothy was walking slowly
  toward him, her hands out as if she feared he would fall and she must catch
  him. "Some riders were coming down off the hill as we drove up. I guess it's
  the AJ boys, all right."</p>

  <p>"Then get back, outa the way!" Cole straightened, looked around him, and
  as if he had chosen his position, began to back toward the haystack. "Get
  away from here!" he exclaimed, waving the two women off. "There'll be bullets
  bouncin' around here when they come!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that so! If that's the case, I guess I can bounce a few myself!
  Come on, Mom, you've got dad's gun&mdash;I know, 'cause I saw you slip it
  into your coat pocket. Billy the Kid's going to need help, from the looks of
  things around here." Dorothy, walking wide of Roper and the dogs, planted
  herself beside Cole. "You certainly got yourself well chewed up, didn't you?"
  she observed, glancing hastily at Cole. "You look almost as if you'd been in
  a fight!"</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, how can you pester the poor boy that way?" her mother sharply
  reproved her, and ranged herself belligerently alongside Cole. "Here the poor
  boy's been fightin' for his very life, and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Mom. They're coming," was the unfilial retort, as hoof beats
  were heard galloping up to the stable.</p>

  <p>"You two beat it!" Cole implored. "This is going to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, hush!" Dorothy hissed. "They won't shoot us if they can help it. What
  do you think they are, anyway?"</p>

  <p>Cole did not say, for at that moment Sheriff Saunders himself walked
  around the corner of the stable, followed closely by Billy Parrish. They
  stared, and Billy came on to Cole. Dorothy gave a hysterical little laugh.
  Mother Harris looked suddenly wilted and as if she were going to cry.</p>

  <p>"You want to look out, Mr. Saunders," Cole cried, his voice showing the
  strain he had borne. "Shorty's somewhere&mdash;gone to stir up the gang, I
  guess. He can't shoot&mdash;I put him on the bum; but he can walk, all right,
  and he'll have the gang here if he can find them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, kid," Saunders rumbled equably. "I want the gang here;
  save goin' after 'em."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, that's all right! I got men enough to take care of 'em; don't you
  worry a minute. Well, Mr. Roper, I guess you and Cole's been havin' a little
  trouble here. Where yuh seem to be hurt?"</p>

  <p>As easily as that, the storm of killing hate subsided. The two women and
  Billy Parrish led Cole off to the well where first aid could be most
  conveniently applied. He was terribly bitten on arms and legs, and Mother
  Harris had visions of hydrophobia which she would not have admitted for the
  world.</p>

  <p>Ed Carroll and his men, Billy explained later on, were stationed where
  they could pick up Roper's men when they rode in, and some one had found
  Shorty half a mile down the trail to the Sinks and had brought him back
  before he could give any harmful warning to the rest.</p>

  <p>"Cole better go right on up to Crater with us," Mother Harris declared,
  "and take the train to Salt Lake or somewhere, where he can have these bites
  Pasteurized. Don't you think so, Mr. Saunders?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Saunders did, and so did Carroll and Billy, when they heard the plan.
  There was no knowing, they said, how long they might be delayed there waiting
  for Roper's men to come in, and Cole had better go on and have his wounds
  attended to before they gave him trouble.</p>

  <p>Billy went along and drove the team, which gave Cole and Dorothy a chance
  to get really acquainted in the back seat together; though Cole was not in
  the mood for much talk. Still, certain matters of interest to them both
  progressed very favorably and they parted friends at the depot.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>You may think that Cole returned to the Black Rim when his hurts were
  healed&mdash;or before&mdash;and resumed his place among those friends who
  had known him all his life. That was what Billy Parrish expected and blandly
  took for granted, especially when it developed that some money was left after
  the Lawson debts were paid from the sheriff's sale. But Cole had different
  plans, and at Crater he balked and would not take his horses and go on home
  with Billy.</p>

  <p>"Saunders has got things fixed so I don't have to go back to jail, but I
  can't go home yet. I've got some stuff out at the Harris place," Cole
  explained. "I'll have to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, cut it out, Cole. Saunders had your stuff brought in here; you know
  darn well the women hauled it in the day you had your big setting with Roper
  and his dogs. And your horses are here, and your saddle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've got a dog out there I'd hate to leave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, the world's full of dogs, Cole. You surely ain't going to be pestered
  with a dog? Anyway, there's an ornery yella curb-setter that followed
  Saunders and me in, when we brought the horses. Mrs. Harris said he was
  yours, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, Billy, I've got to go out there anyway. I promised Mommie I'd help
  her run the ranch. And if there's any money coming to me, Bill, right there's
  where it's going to be used. I've got my eye on a dandy piece of ground right
  on a creek&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, come off!" Billy disgustedly implored. "You got your eye on the girl,
  that's what."</p>

  <p>Cole's ears turned a sudden and vivid scarlet, but he stood his
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Well, and who's business would that be?" he demanded truculently.</p>

  <p>"Why, nobody's, Cole, and I wish you luck. Only, don't lie to <i>me</i>,
  darn yuh!"</p>
