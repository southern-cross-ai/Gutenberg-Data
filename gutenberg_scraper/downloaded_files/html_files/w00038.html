<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_2">I</a></h3>

<p>An hour ago, under the marvelous canopy of the blue northern sky,
David Carrigan, Sergeant in His Most Excellent Majesty's Royal Northwest
Mounted Police, had hummed softly to himself, and had thanked God that he
was alive. He had blessed McVane, superintendent of "N" Division at
Athabasca Landing, for detailing him to the mission on which he was bent.
He was glad that he was traveling alone, and in the deep forest, and that
for many weeks his adventure would carry him deeper and deeper into his
beloved north. Making his noonday tea over a fire at the edge of the
river, with the green forest crowding like an inundation on three sides
of him, he had come to the conclusion&mdash;for the hundredth time,
perhaps&mdash;that it was a nice thing to be alone in the world, for he
was on what his comrades at the Landing called a "bad assignment."</p>

<p>"If anything happens to me," Carrigan had said to McVane, "there isn't
anybody in particular to notify. I lost out in the matter of family a
long time ago."</p>

<p>He was not a man who talked much about himself, even to the
superintendent of "N" Division, yet there were a thousand who loved Dave
Carrigan, and many who placed their confidences in him. Superintendent Me
Vane had one story which he might have told, but he kept it to himself,
instinctively sensing the sacredness of it. Even Carrigan did not know
that the one thing which never passed his lips was known to McVane.</p>

<p>Of that, too, he had been thinking an hour ago. It was the thing
which, first of all, had driven him into the north. And though it had
twisted and disrupted the earth under his feet for a time, it had brought
its compensation. For he had come to love the north with a passionate
devotion. It was, in a way, his God. It seemed to him that the time had
never been when he had lived any other life than this under the open
skies. He was thirty-seven now. A bit of a philosopher, as philosophy
comes to one in a sun-cleaned and unpolluted air, A good-humored brother
of humanity, even when he put manacles on other men's wrists; graying a
little over the temples&mdash;and a lover of life. Above all else he was
that. A lover of life. A worshiper at the shrine of God's Country.</p>

<p>So he sat, that hour ago, deep in the wilderness eighty miles north of
Athabasca Landing, congratulating himself on the present conditions of
his existence. A hundred and eighty miles farther on was Fort McMurray,
and another two hundred beyond that was Chipewyan, and still beyond that
the Mackenzie and its fifteen- hundred-mile trail to the northern sea. He
was glad there was no end to this world of his. He was glad there were
few people in it. But these people he loved. That hour ago he had looked
out on the river as two York boats had forged up against the stream,
craft like the long, slim galleys of old, brought over through the
Churchill and Clearwater countries from Hudson's Bay. There were eight
rowers in each boat. They were singing. Their voices rolled between the
walls of the forests. Their naked arms and shoulders glistened in the
sun. They rowed like Vikings, and to him they were symbols of the freedom
of the world. He had watched them until they were gone up-stream, but it
was a long time before the chanting of their voices had died away. And
then he had risen from beside his tiny fire, and had stretched himself
until his muscles cracked. It was good to feel the blood running red and
strong in one's veins at the age of thirty-seven. For Carrigan felt the
thrill of these days when strong men were coming out of the north
&mdash;days when the glory of June hung over the land, when out of the
deep wilderness threaded by the Three Rivers came romance and courage and
red-blooded men and women of an almost forgotten people to laugh and sing
and barter for a time with the outpost guardians of a younger and more
progressive world. It was north of Fifty-Four, and the waters of a
continent flowed toward the Arctic Sea. Yet soon would the strawberries
be crushing red underfoot; the forest road was in bloom, scarlet
fire-flowers reddened the trail, wild hyacinths and golden-freckled
violets played hide- and-seek with the forget-me-nots in the meadows, and
the sky was a great splash of velvety blue. It was the north
triumphant&mdash;at the edge of civilization; the north triumphant, and
yet paying its tribute. For at the other end were waiting the royal Upper
Ten Thousand and the smart Four Hundred with all the beau monde behind
them, coveting and demanding that tribute to their sex&mdash;the silken
furs of a far country, the life's blood and labor of a land infinitely
beyond the pale of drawing-rooms and the whims of fashion.</p>

<p>Carrigan had thought of these things that hour ago, as he sat at the
edge of the first of the Three Rivers, the great Athabasca. From down the
other two, the Slave and the Mackenzie, the fur fleets of the unmapped
country had been toiling since the first breakups of ice. Steadily, week
after week, the north had been emptying itself of its picturesque tide of
life and voice, of muscle and brawn, of laughter and song&mdash;and
wealth. Through, long months of deep winter, in ten thousand shacks and
tepees and cabins, the story of this June had been written as fate had
written it each winter for a hundred years or more. A story of the
triumph of the fittest. A story of tears, of happiness here and there, of
hunger and plenty, of new life and quick death; a story of strong men and
strong women, living in the faith of their forefathers, with the best
blood of old England and France still surviving in their veins.</p>

<p>Through those same months of winter, the great captains of trade in
the city of Edmonton had been preparing for the coming of the river
brigades. The hundred and fifty miles of trail between that last city
outpost of civilization and Athabasca Landing, the door that opened into
the North, were packed hard by team and dog- sledge and packer bringing
up the freight that for another year was to last the forest people of the
Three River country&mdash;a domain reaching from the Landing to the
Arctic Ocean. In competition fought the drivers of Revillon Brothers and
Hudson's Bay, of free trader and independent adventurer. Freight that
grew more precious with each mile it advanced must reach the beginning of
the waterway. It started with the early snows. The tide was at full by
midwinter. In temperature that nipped men's lungs it did not cease. There
was no let-up in the whip-hands of the masters of trade at Edmonton,
Winnipeg, Montreal, and London across the sea. It was not a work of
philanthropy. These men cared not whether Jean and Jacqueline and Pierre
and Marie were well-fed or hungry, whether they lived or died, so far as
humanity was concerned. But Paris, Vienna, London, and the great capitals
of the earth must have their furs&mdash;and unless that freight went
north, there would be no velvety offerings for the white shoulders of the
world. Christmas windows two years hence would be bare. A feminine wail
of grief would rise to the skies. For woman must have her furs, and in
return for those furs Jean and Jacqueline and Pierre and Marie must have
their freight. So the pendulum swung, as it had swung for a century or
two, touching, on the one side, luxury, warmth, wealth, and beauty; on
the other, cold and hardship, deep snows and open skies&mdash;with that
precious freight the thing between.</p>

<p>And now, in this year before rail and steamboat, the glory of early
summer was at hand, and the wilderness people were coming up to meet the
freight. The Three Rivers&mdash;the Athabasca, the Slave, and the
Mackenzie, all joining in one great two-thousand-mile waterway to the
northern sea&mdash;were athrill with the wild impulse and beat of life as
the forest people lived it. The Great Father had sent in his treaty
money, and Cree song and Chipewyan chant joined the age-old melodies of
French and half-breed. Countless canoes drove past the slower and
mightier scow brigades; huge York boats with two rows of oars heaved up
and down like the ancient galleys of Rome; tightly woven cribs of timber,
and giant rafts made tip of many cribs were ready for their long drift
into a timberless country. On this two-thousand-mile waterway a world had
gathered. It was the Nile of the northland, and each post and gathering
place along its length was turned into a metropolis, half savage,
archaic, splendid with the strength of red blood, clear eyes, and souls
that read the word of God in wind and tree.</p>

<p>And up and down this mighty waterway of wilderness trade ran the
whispering spirit of song, like the voice of a mighty god heard under the
stars and in the winds.</p>

<p>But it was an hour ago that David Carrigan had vividly pictured these
things to himself close to the big river, and many things may happen in
the sixty minutes that follow any given minute in a man's life. That hour
ago his one great purpose had been to bring in Black Roger Audemard,
alive or dead&mdash;Black Roger, the forest fiend who had destroyed half
a dozen lives in a blind passion of vengeance nearly fifteen years ago.
For ten of those fifteen years it had been thought that Black Roger was
dead. But mysterious rumors had lately come out of the North. He was
alive. People had seen him. Fact followed rumor. His existence became
certainty. The Law took up once more his hazardous trail, and David
Carrigan was the messenger it sent.</p>

<p>"Bring him back, alive or dead," were Superintendent McVane's last
words.</p>

<p>And now, thinking of that parting injunction, Carrigan grinned, even
as the sweat of death dampened his face in the heat of the afternoon sun.
For at the end of those sixty minutes that had passed since his midday
pot of tea, the grimly, atrociously unexpected had happened, like a
thunderbolt out of the azure of the sky.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_3">II</a></h3>

<p>Huddled behind a rock which was scarcely larger than his body,
groveling in the white, soft sand like a turtle making a nest for its
eggs, Carrigan told himself this without any reservation. He was, as he
kept repeating to himself for the comfort of his soul, in a deuce of a
fix. His head was bare&mdash;simply because a bullet had taken his hat
away. His blond hair was filled with sand. His face was sweating. But his
blue eyes were alight with a grim sort of humor, though he knew that
unless the other fellow's ammunition ran out he was going to die.</p>

<p>For the twentieth time in as many minutes he looked about him. He was
in the center of a flat area of sand. Fifty feet from him the river
murmured gently over yellow bars and a carpet of pebbles. Fifty feet on
the opposite side of him was the cool, green wall of the forest. The
sunshine playing in it seemed like laughter to him now, a whimsical sort
of merriment roused by the sheer effrontery of the joke which fate had
inflicted upon him.</p>

<p>Between the river and the balsam and spruce was only the rock behind
which he was cringing like a rabbit afraid to take to the open. And his
rock was a mere up-jutting of the solid floor of shale that was under
him. The wash sand that covered it like a carpet was not more than four
or five inches deep. He could not dig in. There was not enough of it
within reach to scrape up as a protection. And his enemy, a hundred yards
or so away, was a determined wretch&mdash;and the deadliest shot he had
ever known.</p>

<p>Three times Carrigan had made experiments to prove this, for he had in
mind a sudden rush to the shelter of the timber. Three times he had
raised the crown of his hat slightly above the top of the rock, and three
times the marksmanship of the other had perforated it with neatness and
dispatch. The third bullet had carried his hat a dozen feet away.
Whenever he showed a patch of his clothing, a bullet replied with
unerring precision. Twice they had drawn blood. And the humor faded out
of Carrigan's eyes.</p>

<p>Not long ago he had exulted in the bigness and glory of this country
of his, where strong men met hand to hand and eye to eye. There were the
other kind in it, the sort that made his profession of manhunting a thing
of reality and danger, but he expected these&mdash;forgot them&mdash;when
the wilderness itself filled his vision. But his present situation was
something unlike anything that had ever happened in his previous
experience with the outlawed. He had faced dangers. He had fought. There
were times when he had almost died. Fanchet, the half-breed who had
robbed a dozen wilderness mail sledges, had come nearest to trapping him
and putting him out of business. Fanchet was a desperate man and had few
scruples. But even Fanchet&mdash;before he was caught&mdash;would not
have cornered a man with such bloodthirsty unfairness as Carrigan found
himself cornered now. He no longer had a doubt as to what was in the
other's mind. It was not to wound and make merely helpless. It was to
kill. It was not difficult to prove this. Careful not to expose a part of
his arm or shoulder, he drew a white handkerchief from his pocket,
fastened it to the end of his rifle, and held the flag of surrender three
feet above the rock. And then, with equal caution, he slowly thrust up a
flat piece of shale, which at a distance of a hundred yards might appear
as his shoulder or even his head. Scarcely was it four inches above the
top of the rock before there came the report of a rifle, and the shale
was splintered into a hundred bits.</p>

<p>Carrigan lowered his flag and gathered himself in tighter. The
accuracy of the other's marksmanship was appalling. He knew that if he
exposed himself for an instant to use his own rifle or the heavy
automatic in his holster, he would be a dead man before he could press a
trigger. And that time, he felt equally sure, would come sooner or later.
His muscles were growing cramped. He could not forever double himself up
like a four-bladed jackknife behind the altogether inefficient shelter of
the rock.</p>

<p>His executioner was hidden in the edge of the timber, not directly
opposite him, but nearly a hundred yards down stream. Twenty times he had
wondered why the fiend with the rifle did not creep up through that
timber and take a good, open pot-shot at him from the vantage point which
lay at the end of a straight line between his rock and the nearest spruce
and balsam. From that angle he could not completely shelter himself. But
the man a hundred yards below had not moved a foot from his ambush since
he had fired his first shot. That had come when Carrigan was crossing the
open space of soft, white sand. It had left a burning sensation at his
temple&mdash; half an inch to the right and it would have killed him.
Swift as the shot itself, he dropped behind the one protection at hand,
the up-jutting shoulder of shale.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour he had been making efforts to wriggle himself
free from his bulky shoulder-pack without exposing himself to a
coup-de-grace. At last he had the thing off. It was a tremendous relief
when he thrust it out beside the rock, almost doubling the size of his
shelter. Instantly there came the crash of a bullet in it, and then
another. He heard the rattle of pans, and wondered if his skillet would
be any good after today.</p>

<p>For the first time he could wipe the sweat from his face and stretch
himself. And also he could think. Carrigan possessed an unalterable faith
in the infallibility of the mind. "You can do anything with the mind,"
was his code. "It is better than a good gun."</p>

<p>Now that he was physically more at ease, he began reassembling his
scattered mental faculties. Who was this stranger who was pot- shotting
at him with such deadly animosity from the ambush below? Who&mdash;</p>

<p>Another crash of lead in tinware and steel put an unpleasant emphasis
to the question. It was so close to his head that it made him wince, and
now&mdash;with a wide area within reach about him&mdash;he began scraping
up the sand for an added protection. There came a long silence after that
third clatter of distress from his cooking utensils. To David Carrigan,
even in his hour of deadly peril, there was something about it that for
an instant brought back the glow of humor in his eyes. It was hot,
swelteringly hot, in that packet of sand with the unclouded sun almost
straight overhead. He could have tossed a pebble to where a bright-eyed
sandpiper was cocking itself backward and forward, its jerky movements
accompanied by friendly little tittering noises. Everything about him
seemed friendly. The river rippled and murmured in cooling song just
beyond the sandpiper. On the other side the still cooler forest was a
paradise of shade and contentment, astir with subdued and hidden life. It
was nesting season. He heard the twitter of birds. A tiny, brown wood
warbler fluttered out to the end of a silvery birch limb, and it seemed
to David that its throat must surely burst with the burden of its song.
The little fellow's brown body, scarcely larger than a butternut, was
swelling up like a round ball in his effort to vanquish all other
song.</p>

<p>"Go to it, old man," chuckled Carrigan. "Go to it!"</p>

<p>The little warbler, that he might have crushed between thumb and
forefinger, gave him a lot of courage.</p>

<p>Then the tiny chorister stopped for breath. In that interval Carrigan
listened to the wrangling of two vivid-colored Canada jays deeper in the
timber. Chronic scolds they were, never without a grouch. They were like
some people Carrigan had known, born pessimists, always finding something
to complain about, even in their love days.</p>

<p>And these were love days. That was the odd thought that came to
Carrigan as he lay half on his face, his fingers slowly and cautiously
working a loophole between his shoulder-pack and the rock. They were love
days all up and down the big rivers, where men and women sang for joy,
and children played, forgetful of the long, hard days of winter. And in
forest, plain, and swamp was this spirit of love also triumphant over the
land. It was the mating season of all feathered things. In countless
nests were the peeps and twitters of new life; mothers of first-born were
teaching their children to swim and fly; from end to end of the forest
world the little children of the silent places, furred and feathered,
clawed and hoofed, were learning the ways of life. Nature's yearly
birthday was half-way gone, and the doors of nature's school wide open.
And the tiny brown songster at the end of his birch twig proclaimed the
joy of it again, and challenged all the world to beat him in his
adulation.</p>

<p>Carrigan found that he could peer between his pack and the rock to
where the other warbler was singing&mdash;and where his enemy lay
watching for the opportunity to kill. It was taking a chance. If a
movement betrayed his loophole, his minutes were numbered. But he had
worked cautiously, an inch at a time, and was confident that the
beginning of his effort to fight back was, up to the present moment,
undiscovered. He believed that he knew about where the ambushed man was
concealed. In the edge of a low-hanging mass of balsam was a fallen
cedar. From behind the butt of that cedar he was sure the shots had
come.</p>

<p>And now, even more cautiously than he had made the tiny opening, he
began to work the muzzle of his rifle through the loophole. As he did
this he was thinking of Black Roger Audemard. And yet, almost as quickly
as suspicion leaped into his mind, he told himself that the thing was
impossible. It could not be Black Roger, or one of Black Roger's friends,
behind the cedar log. The idea was inconceivable, when he considered how
carefully the secret of his mission had been kept at the Landing. He had
not even said goodby to his best friends. And because Black Roger had won
through all the preceding years, Carrigan was stalking his prey out of
uniform. There had been nothing to betray him. Besides, Black Roger
Audemard must be at least a thousand miles north, unless something had
tempted him to come up the rivers with the spring brigades. If he used
logic at all, there was but one conclusion for him to arrive at. The man
in ambush was some rascally half-breed who coveted his outfit and
whatever valuables he might have about his person.</p>

<p>A fourth smashing eruption among his comestibles and culinary
possessions came to drive home the fact that even that analysis of the
situation was absurd. Whoever was behind the rifle fire had small respect
for the contents of his pack, and he was surely not in grievous need of a
good gun or ammunition. A sticky mess of condensed cream was running over
Carrigan's hand. He doubted if there was a whole tin in his kit.</p>

<p>For a few moments he lay quietly on his face after the fourth shot.
His eyes were turned toward the river, and on the far side, a quarter of
a mile away, three canoes were moving swiftly up the slow current of the
stream. The sunlight flashed on their wet sides. The gleam of dripping
paddles was like the flutter of silvery birds' wings, and across the
water came an unintelligible shout in response to the rifle shot. It
occurred to David that he might make a trumpet of his hands and shout
back, but the distance was too great for his voice to carry its message
for help. Besides, now that he had the added protection of the pack, he
felt a certain sense of humiliation at the thought of showing the white
feather. A few minutes more, if all went well, and he would settle for
the man behind the log.</p>

<p>He continued again the slow operation of worming his rifle barrel
between the pack and the rock. The near-sighted little sandpiper had
discovered him and seemed interested in the operation. It had come a
dozen feet nearer, and was perking its head and seesawing on its long
legs as it watched with inquisitive inspection the unusual manifestation
of life behind the rock. Its twittering note had changed to an occasional
sharp and querulous cry. Carrigan wanted to wring its neck. That cry told
the other fellow that he was still alive and moving.</p>

<p>It seemed an age before his rifle was through, and every moment he
expected another shot. He flattened himself out, Indian fashion, and
sighted along the barrel. He was positive that his enemy was watching,
yet he could make out nothing that looked like a head anywhere along the
log. At one end was a clump of deeper foliage. He was sure he saw a
sudden slight movement there, and in the thrill of the moment was tempted
to send a bullet into the heart of it. But he saved his cartridge. He
felt the mighty importance of certainty. If he fired once&mdash;and
missed&mdash;the advantage of his unsuspected loophole would be gone. It
would be transformed into a deadly menace. Even as it was, if his enemy's
next bullet should enter that way&mdash;</p>

<p>He felt the discomfort of the thought, and in spite of himself a
tremor of apprehension ran up his spine. He felt an even greater desire
to wring the neck of the inquisitive little sandpiper. The creature had
circled round squarely in front of him and stood there tilting its tail
and bobbing its head as if its one insane desire was to look down the
length of his rifle barrel. The bird was giving him away. If the other
fellow was only half as clever as his marksmanship was good&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly every nerve in Carrigan's body tightened. He was positive
that he had caught the outline of a human head and shoulders in the
foliage. His finger pressed gently against the trigger of his Winchester.
Before he breathed again he would have fired. But a shot from the foliage
beat him out by the fraction of a second. In that precious time lost, his
enemy's bullet entered the edge of his kit&mdash;and came through. He
felt the shock of it, and in the infinitesimal space between the physical
impact and the mental effect of shock his brain told him the horrible
thing had happened. It was his head&mdash;his face. It was as if he had
plunged them suddenly into hot water, and what was left of his skull was
filled with the rushing and roaring of a flood. He staggered up,
clutching his face with both hands. The world about him was twisted and
black, a dizzily revolving thing&mdash;yet his still fighting mental
vision pictured clearly for him a monstrous, bulging-eyed sandpiper as
big as a house. Then he toppled back on the white sand, his arms flung
out limply, his face turned to the ambush wherein his murderer lay.</p>

<p>His body was clear of the rock and the pack, but there came no other
shot from the thick clump of balsam. Nor, for a time, was there movement.
The wood warbler was cheeping inquiringly at this sudden change in the
deportment of his friend behind the shoulder of shale. The sandpiper, a
bit startled, had gone back to the edge of the river and was running a
race with himself along the wet sand. And the two quarrelsome jays had
brought their family squabble to the edge of the timber.</p>

<p>It was their wrangling that roused Carrigan to the fact that he was
not dead. It was a thrilling discovery&mdash;that and the fact that he
made out clearly a patch of sunlight in the sand. He did not move, but
opened his eyes wider. He could see the timber. On a straight line with
his vision was the thick clump of balsam. And as he looked, the boughs
parted and a figure came out. Carrigan drew a deep breath. He found that
it did not hurt him. He gripped the fingers of the hand that was under
his body, and they closed on the butt of his service automatic. He would
win yet, if God gave him life a few minutes longer.</p>

<p>His enemy advanced. As he drew nearer, Carrigan closed his eyes more
and more. They must be shut, and he must appear as if dead, when the
other came up. Then, when the scoundrel put down his gun, as he naturally
would&mdash;his chance would be at hand. If a quiver of his eyes betrayed
him&mdash;</p>

<p>He closed them tight. Dizziness began to creep over him, and the fire
in his brain grew hot again. He heard footsteps, and they stopped in the
sand close beside him. Then he heard a human voice. It did not speak in
words, but gave utterance to a strange and unnatural cry. With a mighty
effort Carrigan assembled his last strength. It seemed to him that he
brought himself up quickly, but his movement was slow, painful&mdash;the
effort of a man who might be dying. The automatic hung limply in his
hand, its muzzle pointing to the sand. He looked up, trying to swing into
action that mighty weight of his weapon. And then from his own lips, even
in his utter physical impotence, fell a cry of wonder and amazement.</p>

<p>His enemy stood there in the sunlight, staring down at him with big,
dark eyes that were filled with horror. They were not the eyes of a man.
David Carrigan, in this most astounding moment of his life, found himself
looking up into the face of a woman.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_4">III</a></h3>

<p>For a matter of twenty seconds&mdash;even longer it seemed to Carrigan
&mdash;the life of these two was expressed in a vivid and unforgettable
tableau. One half of it David saw&mdash;the blue sky, the dazzling sun,
the girl in between. The pistol dropped from his limp hand, and the
weight of his body tottered on the crook of his under-elbow. Mentally and
physically he was on the point of collapse, and yet in those few moments
every detail of the picture was painted with a brush of fire in his
brain. The girl was bareheaded. Her face was as white as any face he had
ever seen, living or dead; her eyes were like pools that had caught the
reflection of fire; he saw the sheen of her hair, the poise of her
slender body&mdash;its shock, stupefaction, horror. He sensed these
things even as his brain wobbled dizzily, and the larger part of the
picture began to fade out of his vision. But her face remained to the
last. It grew clearer, like a cameo framed in an iris&mdash;a beautiful,
staring, horrified face with shimmering tresses of jet-black hair blowing
about it like a veil. He noticed the hair, that was partly undone as if
she had been in a struggle of some sort, or had been running fast against
the breeze that came up the river.</p>

<p>He fought with himself to hold that picture of her, to utter some
word, make some movement. But the power to see and to live died out of
him. He sank back with a queer sound in his throat. He did not hear the
answering cry from the girl as she flung herself, with a quick little
prayer for help, on her knees in the soft, white sand beside him. He felt
no movement when she raised his head in her arm and with her bare hand
brushed back his sand- littered hair, revealing where the bullet had
struck him. He did not know when she ran back to the river.</p>

<p>His first sensation was of a cool and comforting something trickling
over his burning temples and his face. It was water. Subconsciously he
knew that, and in the same way he began to think. But it was hard to pull
his thoughts together. They persisted in hopping about, like a lot of
sand-fleas in a dance, and just as he got hold of one and reached for
another, the first would slip away from him. He began to get the best of
them after a time, and he had an uncontrollable desire to say something.
But his eyes and his lips were sealed tight, and to open them, a little
army of gnomes came out of the darkness in the back of his head, each of
them armed with a lever, and began prying with all their might. After
that came the beginning of light and a flash of consciousness.</p>

<p>The girl was working over him. He could feel her and hear her
movement. Water was trickling over his face. Then he heard a voice, close
over him, saying something in a sobbing monotone which he could not
understand.</p>

<p>With a mighty effort he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank LE BON DIEU, you live, m'sieu," he heard the voice say, as if
coming from a long distance away. "You live, you live&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tryin' to," he mumbled thickly, feeling suddenly a sense of great
elation. "Tryin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>He wanted to curse the gnomes for deserting him, for as soon as they
were gone with their levers, his eyes and his lips shut tight again, or
at least he thought they did. But he began to sense things in a curious
sort of way. Some one was dragging him. He could feel the grind of sand
under his body. There were intervals when the dragging operation paused.
And then, after a long time, he seemed to hear more than one voice. There
were two&mdash;sometimes a murmur of them. And odd visions came to him.
He seemed to see the girl with shining black hair and dark eyes, and then
swiftly she would change into a girl with hair like blazing gold. This
was a different girl. She was not like Pretty Eyes, as his twisted mind
called the other. This second vision that he saw was like a radiant bit
of the sun, her hair all aflame with the fire of it and her face a
different sort of face. He was always glad when she went away and Pretty
Eyes came back.</p>

<p>To David Carrigan this interesting experience in his life might have
covered an hour, a day, or a month. Or a year for that matter, for he
seemed to have had an indefinite association with Pretty Eyes. He had
known her for a long time and very intimately, it seemed. Yet he had no
memory of the long fight in the hot sun, or of the river, or of the
singing warblers, or of the inquisitive sandpiper that had marked out the
line which his enemy's last bullet had traveled. He had entered into a
new world in which everything was vague and unreal except that vision of
dark hair, dark eyes, and pale, beautiful face. Several times he saw it
with marvelous clearness, and each time he drifted away into darkness
again with the sound of a voice growing fainter and fainter in his
ears.</p>

<p>Then came a time of utter chaos and soundless gloom. He was in a pit,
where even his subconscious self was almost dead under a crushing
oppression. At last a star began to glimmer in this pit, a star pale and
indistinct and a vast distance away. But it crept steadily up through the
eternity of darkness, and the nearer it came, the less there was of the
blackness of night. From a star it grew into a sun, and with the sun came
dawn. In that dawn he heard the singing of a bird, and the bird was just
over his head. When Carrigan opened his eyes, and understanding came to
him, he found himself under the silver birch that belonged to the wood
warbler.</p>

<p>For a space he did not ask himself how he had come there. He was
looking at the river and the white strip of sand. Out there were the rock
and his dunnage pack. Also his rifle. Instinctively his eyes turned to
the balsam ambush farther down. That, too, was in a blaze of sunlight
now. But where he lay, or sat, or stood&mdash;he was not sure what he was
doing at that moment&mdash;it was shady and deliciously cool. The green
of the cedar and spruce and balsam was close about him, inset with the
silver and gold of the thickly- leaved birch. He discovered that he was
bolstered up partly against the trunk of this birch and partly against a
spruce sapling. Between these two, where his head rested, was a pile of
soft moss freshly torn from the earth. And within reach of him was his
own kit pail filled with water.</p>

<p>He moved himself cautiously and raised a hand to his head. His fingers
came in contact with a bandage.</p>

<p>For a minute or two after that he sat without moving while his amazed
senses seized upon the significance of it all. In the first place he was
alive. But even this fact of living was less remarkable than the other
things that had happened. He remembered the final moments of the unequal
duel. His enemy had got him. And that enemy was a woman! Moreover, after
she had blown away a part of his head and had him helpless in the sand,
she had&mdash;in place of finishing him there&mdash;dragged him to this
cool nook and tied up his wound. It was hard for him to believe, but the
pail of water, the moss behind his shoulders, the bandage, and certain
visions that were reforming themselves in his brain convinced him. A
woman had shot him. She had worked like the very devil to kill him. And
afterward she had saved him! He grinned. It was final proof that his mind
hadn't been playing tricks on him. No one but a woman would have been
quite so unreasonable. A man would have completed the job.</p>

<p>He began to look for her up and down the white strip of sand. And in
looking he saw the gray and silver flash of the hard-working sandpiper.
He chuckled, for he was exceedingly comfortable, and also exhilaratingly
happy to know that the thing was over and he was not dead. If the
sandpiper had been a man, he would have called him up to shake hands with
him. For if it hadn't been for the bird getting squarely in front of him
and giving him away, there might have been a more horrible end to it all.
He shuddered as he thought of the mighty effort he had made to fire a
shot into the heart of the balsam ambush&mdash;and perhaps into the heart
of a woman!</p>

<p>He reached for the pail and drank deeply of the water in it. He felt
no pain. His dizziness was gone. His mind had grown suddenly clear and
alert. The warmth of the water told him almost instantly that it had been
taken from the river some time ago. He observed the change in sun and
shadows. With the instinct of a man trained to note details, he pulled
out his watch. It was almost six o'clock. More than three hours had
passed since the sandpiper had got in front of his gun. He did not
attempt to rise to his feet, but scanned with slower and more careful
scrutiny the edge of the forest and the river. He had been mystified
while cringing for his life behind the rock, but he was infinitely more
so now. Greater desire he had never had than this which thrilled him in
these present minutes of his readjustment&mdash;desire to look upon the
woman again. And then, all at once, there came back to him a mental flash
of the other. He remembered, as if something was coming back to him out
of a dream, how the whimsical twistings of his sick brain had made him
see two faces instead of one. Yet he knew that the first picture of his
mysterious assailant, the picture painted in his brain when he had tried
to raise his pistol, was the right one. He had seen her dark eyes aglow;
he had seen the sunlit sheen of her black hair rippling in the wind; he
had seen the white pallor in her face, the slimness of her as she stood
over him in horror&mdash;he remembered even the clutch of her white hand
at her throat. A moment before she had tried to kill him. And then he had
looked up and had seen her like that! It must have been some
unaccountable trick in his brain that had flooded her hair with golden
fire at times.</p>

<p>His eyes followed a furrow in the white sand which led from where he
sat bolstered against the tree down to his pack and the rock. It was the
trail made by his body when she had dragged him up to the shelter and
coolness of the timber. One of his laws of physical care was to keep
himself trained down to a hundred and sixty, but he wondered how she had
dragged up even so much as that of dead weight. It had taken a great deal
of effort. He could see distinctly three different places in the sand
where she had stopped to rest.</p>

<p>Carrigan had earned a reputation as the expert analyst of "N"
Division. In delicate matters it was seldom that McVane did not take him
into consultation. He possessed an almost uncanny grip on the working
processes of a criminal mind, and the first rule he had set down for
himself was to regard the acts of omission rather than the one
outstanding act of commission. But when he proved to himself that the
chief actor in a drama possessed a normal rather than a criminal mind, he
found himself in the position of checkmate. It was a thrilling game. And
he was frankly puzzled now, until&mdash;one after another&mdash;he added
up the sum total of what had been omitted in this instance of his own
personal adventure. Hidden in her ambush, the woman who had shot him had
been in both purpose and act an assassin. Her determination had been to
kill him. She had disregarded the white flag with which he had pleaded
for mercy. Her marksmanship was of fiendish cleverness. Up to her last
shot she had been, to all intent and purpose, a murderess.</p>

<p>The change had come when she looked down upon him, bleeding and
helpless, in the sand. Undoubtedly she had thought he was dying. But why,
when she saw his eyes open a little later, had she cried out her
gratitude to God? What had worked the sudden transformation in her? Why
had she labored to save the life she had so atrociously coveted a minute
before?</p>

<p>If his assailant had been a man, Carrigan would have found an answer.
For he was not robbed, and therefore robbery was not a motif. "A case of
mistaken identity," he would have told himself. "An error in visual
judgment."</p>

<p>But the fact that in his analysis he was dealing with a woman made his
answer only partly satisfying. He could not disassociate himself from her
eyes&mdash;their beauty, their horror, the way they had looked at him. It
was as if a sudden revulsion had come over her; as if, looking down upon
her bleeding handiwork, the woman's soul in her had revolted, and with
that revulsion had come repentance&mdash;repentance and pity.</p>

<p>"That," thought Carrigan, "would be just like a woman&mdash;and
especially a woman with eyes like hers."</p>

<p>This left him but two conclusions to choose from. Either there had
been a mistake, and the woman had shown both horror and desire to amend
when she discovered it, or a too tender-hearted agent of Black Roger
Audemard had waylaid him in the heart of the white strip of sand.</p>

<p>The sun was another hour lower in the sky when Carrigan assured
himself in a series of cautious experiments that he was not in a
condition to stand upon his feet. In his pack were a number of things he
wanted&mdash;his blankets, for instance, a steel mirror, and the
thermometer in his medical kit. He was beginning to feel a bit anxious
about himself. There were sharp pains back of his eyes. His face was hot,
and he was developing an unhealthy appetite for water. It was fever and
he knew what fever meant in this sort of thing, when one was alone. He
had given up hope of the woman's return. It was not reasonable to expect
her to come back after her furious attempt to kill him. She had bandaged
him, bolstered him up, placed water beside him, and had then left him to
work out the rest of his salvation alone. But why the deuce hadn't she
brought up his pack?</p>

<p>On his hands and knees he began to work himself toward it slowly. He
found that the movement caused him pain, and that with this pain, if he
persisted in movement, there was a synchronous rise of nausea. The two
seemed to work in a sort of unity. But his medicine case was important
now, and his blankets, and his rifle if he hoped to signal help that
might chance to pass on the river. A foot at a time, a yard at a time, he
made his way down into the sand. His fingers dug into the footprints of
the mysterious gun- woman. He approved of their size. They were small and
narrow, scarcely longer than the palm and fingers of his hand&mdash;and
they were made by shoes instead of moccasins.</p>

<p>It seemed an interminable time to him before he reached his pack. When
he got there, a pendulum seemed swinging back and forth inside his head,
beating against his skull. He lay down with his pack for a pillow,
intending to rest for a spell. But the minutes added themselves one on
top of another. The sun slipped behind clouds banking in the west. It
grew cooler, while within him he was consumed by a burning thirst. He
could hear the ripple of running water, the laughter of it among pebbles
a few yards away. And the river itself became even more desirable than
his medicine case, or his blankets, or his rifle. The song of it,
inviting and tempting him, blotted thought of the other things out of his
mind. And he continued his journey, the swing of the pendulum in his head
becoming harder, but the sound of the river growing nearer. At last he
came to the wet sand, and fell on his face, and drank.</p>

<p>After this he had no great desire to go back. He rolled himself over,
so that his face was turned up to the sky. Under him the wet sand was
soft, and it was comfortingly cool. The fire in his head died out. He
could hear new sounds in the edge of the forest evening sounds. Only weak
little twitters came from the wood warblers, driven to silence by
thickening gloom in the densely canopied balsams and cedars, and
frightened by the first low hoots of the owls. There was a crash not far
distant, probably a porcupine waddling through brush on his way for a
drink; or perhaps it was a thirsty deer, or a bear coming out in the hope
of finding a dead fish. Carrigan loved that sort of sound, even when a
pendulum was beating back and forth in his head. It was like medicine to
him, and he lay with wide-open eyes, his ears picking up one after
another the voices that marked the change from day to night. He heard the
cry of a loon, its softer, chuckling note of honeymoon days. From across
the river came a cry that was half howl, half bark. Carrigan knew that it
was coyote, and not wolf, a coyote whose breed had wandered hundreds of
miles north of the prairie country.</p>

<p>The gloom gathered in, and yet it was not darkness as the darkness of
night is known a thousand miles south. It was the dusky twilight of day
where the sun rises at three o'clock in the morning and still throws its
ruddy light in the western sky at nine o'clock at night; where the poplar
buds unfold themselves into leaf before one's very eyes; where
strawberries are green in the morning and red in the afternoon; where, a
little later, one could read newspaper print until midnight by the glow
of the sun&mdash; and between the rising and the setting of that sun
there would be from eighteen to twenty hours of day. It was evening time
in the wonderland of the north, a wonderland hard and frozen and ridden
by pain and death in winter, but a paradise upon earth in this month of
June.</p>

<p>The beauty of it filled Carrigan's soul, even as he lay on his back in
the damp sand. Far south of him steam and steel were coming, and the
world would soon know that it was easy to grow wheat at the Arctic
Circle, that cucumbers grew to half the size of a man's arm, that flowers
smothered the land and berries turned it scarlet and black. He had
dreaded these days&mdash;days of what he called "the great
discovery"&mdash;the time when a crowded civilization would at last
understand how the fruits of the earth leaped up to the call of twenty
hours of sun each day, even though that earth itself was eternally frozen
if one went down under its surface four feet with a pick and shovel.</p>

<p>Tonight the gloom came earlier because of the clouds in the west. It
was very still. Even the breeze had ceased to come from up the river. And
as Carrigan listened, exulting in the thought that the coolness of the
wet sand was drawing the fever from him, he heard another sound. At first
he thought it was the splashing of a fish. But after that it came again,
and still again, and he knew that it was the steady and rhythmic dip of
paddles.</p>

<p>A thrill shot through him, and he raised himself to his elbow. Dusk
covered the river, and he could not see. But he heard low voices as the
paddles dipped. And after a little he knew that one of these was the
voice of a woman.</p>

<p>His heart gave a big jump. "She is coming back," he whispered to
himself. "She is coming back!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_5">IV</a></h3>

<p>Carrigan's first impulse, sudden as the thrill that leaped through
him, was to cry out to the occupants of the unseen canoe. Words were on
his lips, but he forced them back. They could not miss him, could not get
beyond the reach of his voice&mdash;and he waited. After all, there might
be profit in a reasonable degree of caution. He crept back toward his
rifle, sensing the fact that movement no longer gave him very great
distress. At the same time he lost no sound from the river. The voices
were silent, and the dip, dip, dip of paddles was approaching softly and
with extreme caution. At last he could barely hear the trickle of them,
yet he knew the canoe was coming steadily nearer. There was a suspicious
secretiveness in its approach. Perhaps the lady with the beautiful eyes
and the glistening hair had changed her mind again and was returning to
put an end to him.</p>

<p>The thought sharpened his vision. He saw a thin shadow a little darker
than the gloom of the river; it grew into shape; something grated lightly
upon sand and pebbles, and then he heard the guarded plash of feet in
shallow water and saw some one pulling the canoe up higher. A second
figure joined the first. They advanced a few paces and stopped. In a
moment a voice called softly,</p>

<p>"M'sieu! M'sieu Carrigan!"</p>

<p>There was an anxious note in the voice, but Carrigan held his tongue.
And then he heard the woman say,</p>

<p>"It was here, Bateese! I am sure of it!"</p>

<p>There was more than anxiety in her voice now. Her words trembled with
distress. "Bateese&mdash;if he is dead&mdash;he is up there close to the
trees."</p>

<p>"But he isn't dead," said Carrigan, raising himself a little. "He is
here, behind the rock again!"</p>

<p>In a moment she had run to where he was lying, his hand clutching the
cold barrel of the pistol which he had found in the sand, his white face
looking up at her. Again he found himself staring into the glow of her
eyes, and in that pale light which precedes the coming of stars and moon
the fancy struck him that she was lovelier than in the full radiance of
the sun. He heard a throbbing note in her throat. And then she was down
on her knees at his side, leaning close over him, her hands groping at
his shoulders, her quick breath betraying how swiftly her heart was
beating.</p>

<p>"You are not hurt&mdash;badly?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied David. "You made a perfect shot. I think a
part of my head is gone. At least you've shot away my balance, because I
can't stand on my feet!"</p>

<p>Her hand touched his face, remaining there for an instant, and the
palm of it pressed his forehead. It was like the touch of cool velvet, he
thought. Then she called to the man named Bateese. He made Carrigan think
of a huge chimpanzee as he came near, because of the shortness of his
body and the length of his arms. In the half light he might have been a
huge animal, a hulking creature of some sort walking upright. Carrigan's
fingers closed more tightly on the butt of his automatic. The woman began
to talk swiftly in a patois of French and Cree. David caught the gist of
it. She was telling Bateese to carry him to the canoe, and to be very
careful, because m'sieu was badly hurt. It was his head, she emphasized.
Bateese must be careful of his head.</p>

<p>David slipped his pistol into its holster as Bateese bent over him. He
tried to smile at the woman to thank her for her solicitude&mdash;after
having nearly killed him. There was an increasing glow in the night, and
he began to see her more plainly. Out on the middle of the river was a
silvery bar of light. The moon was coming up, a little pale as yet, but
triumphant in the fact that clouds had blotted out the sun an hour before
his time. Between this bar of light and himself he saw the head of
Bateese. It was a wild, savage-looking head, bound pirate- fashion round
the forehead with a huge Hudson's Bay kerchief. Bateese might have been
old Jack Ketch himself bending over to give the final twist to a victim's
neck. His long arms slipped under David. Gently and without effort he
raised him to his feet. And then, as easily as he might have lifted a
child, he trundled him up in his arms and walked off with him over the
sand.</p>

<p>Carrigan had not expected this. He was a little shocked and felt also
the impropriety of the thing. The idea of being lugged off like a baby
was embarrassing, even in the presence of the one who had deliberately
put him in his present condition. Bateese did the thing with such beastly
ease. It was as if he was no more than a small boy, a runt with no weight
whatever, and Bateese was a man. He would have preferred to stagger along
on his own feet or creep on his hands and knees, and he grunted as much
to Bateese on the way to the canoe. He felt, at the same time, that the
situation owed him something more of discussion and explanation. Even
now, after half killing him, the woman was taking a rather high-handed
advantage of him. She might at least have assured him that she had made a
mistake and was sorry. But she did not speak to him again. She said
nothing more to Bateese, and when the half-breed deposited him in the
midship part of the canoe, facing the bow, she stood back in silence.
Then Bateese brought his pack and rifle, and wedged the pack in behind
him so that he could sit upright. After that, without pausing to ask
permission, he picked up the woman and carried her through the shallow
water to the bow, saving her the wetting of her feet.</p>

<p>As she turned to find her paddle her face was toward David, and for a
moment she was looking at him.</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me who you are, and where we are going?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I am Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain," she said. "My brigade is down the
river, M'sieu Carrigan."</p>

<p>He was amazed at the promptness of her confession, for as one of the
working factors of the long arm of the police he accepted it as that. He
had scarcely expected her to divulge her name after the cold-blooded way
in which she had attempted to kill him. And she had spoken quite calmly
of "my brigade." He had heard of the Boulain Brigade. It was a name
associated with Chipewyan, as he remembered it&mdash;or Fort McMurray. He
was not sure just where the Boulain scows had traded freight with the
upper-river craft. Until this year he was positive they had not come as
far south as Athabasca Landing. Boulain&mdash;Boulain&mdash;The name
repeated itself over and over in his mind. Bateese shoved off the canoe,
and the woman's paddle dipped in and out of the water beginning to
shimmer in moonlight. But he could not, for a time, get himself beyond
the pounding of that name in his brain. It was not merely that he had
heard the name before. There was something significant about it.
Something that made him grope back in his memory of things. Boulain! He
whispered it to himself, his eyes on the slender figure of the woman
ahead of him, swaying gently to the steady sweep of the paddle in her
hands. Yet he could think of nothing. A feeling of irritation swept over
him, disgust at his own mental impotency. And the dizzying sickness was
brewing in his head again.</p>

<p>"I have heard that name&mdash;somewhere&mdash;before," he said. There
was a space of only five or six feet between them, and he spoke with
studied distinctness.</p>

<p>"Possibly you have, m'sieu."</p>

<p>Her voice was exquisite, clear as the note of a bird, yet so soft and
low that she seemed scarcely to have spoken. And it was, Carrigan
thought, criminally evasive&mdash;under the circumstances. He wanted her
to turn round and say something. He wanted, first of all, to ask her why
she had tried to kill him. It was his right to demand an explanation. And
it was his duty to get her back to the Landing, where the law would ask
an accounting of her. She must know that. There was only one way in which
she could have learned his name, and that was by prying into his
identification papers while he was unconscious. Therefore she not only
knew his name, but also that he was Sergeant Carrigan of the Royal
Northwest Mounted Police. In spite of all this she was apparently not
very deeply concerned. She was not frightened, and she did not appear to
be even slightly excited.</p>

<p>He leaned nearer to her, the movement sending a sharp pain between his
eyes. It almost drew a cry from him, but he forced himself to speak
without betraying it.</p>

<p>"You tried to murder me&mdash;and almost succeeded. Haven't you
anything to say?"</p>

<p>"Not now, m'sieu&mdash;except that it was a mistake. and I am sorry.
But you must not talk. You must remain quiet. I am afraid your skull is
fractured."</p>

<p>Afraid his skull was fractured! And she expressed her fear in the
casual way she might have spoken of a toothache. He leaned back against
his dunnage sack and closed his eyes. Probably she was right. These fits
of dizziness and nausea were suspicious. They made him top-heavy and
filled him with a desire to crumple up somewhere. He was clear-mindedly
conscious of this and of his fight against the weakness. But in those
moments when he felt better and his head was clear of pain, he had not
seriously thought of a fractured skull. If she believed it, why did she
not treat him a bit more considerately? Bateese, with that strength of an
ox in his arms, had no use for her assistance with the paddle. She might
at least have sat facing him, even if she refused to explain matters more
definitely.</p>

<p>A mistake, she called it. And she was sorry for him! She had made
those statements in a matter-of-fact way, but with a voice that was like
music. She had spoken perfect English, but in her words were the
inflection and velvety softness of the French blood which must be running
red in her veins. And her name was Jeanne Marie- Anne Boulain!</p>

<p>With eyes closed, Carrigan called himself an idiot for thinking of
these things at the present time. Primarily he was a man-hunter out on
important duty, and here was duty right at hand, a thousand miles south
of Black Roger Audemard, the wholesale murderer he was after. He would
have sworn on his life that Black Roger had never gone at a killing more
deliberately than this same Jeanne Marie- Anne Boulain had gone after him
behind the rock!</p>

<p>Now that it was all over, and he was alive, she was taking him
somewhere as coolly and as unexcitedly as though they were returning from
a picnic. Carrigan shut his eyes tighter and wondered if he was thinking
straight. He believed he was badly hurt, but he was as strongly convinced
that his mind was clear. And he lay quietly with his head against the
pack, his eyes closed, waiting for the coolness of the river to drive his
nausea away again.</p>

<p>He sensed rather than felt the swift movement of the canoe. There was
no perceptible tremor to its progress. The current and a perfect
craftsmanship with the paddles were carrying it along at six or seven
miles an hour. He heard the rippling of water that at times was almost
like the tinkling of tiny bells, and more and more bell-like became that
sound as he listened to it. It struck a certain note for him. And to that
note another added itself, until in the purling rhythm of the river he
caught the murmuring monotone of a name
Boulain&mdash;Boulain&mdash;Boulain. The name became an obsession. It
meant something. And he knew what it meant&mdash;if he could only whip
his memory back into harness again. But that was impossible now. When he
tried to concentrate his mental faculties, his head ached
terrifically.</p>

<p>He dipped his hand into the water and held it over his eyes. For half
an hour after that he did not raise his head. In that time not a word was
spoken by Bateese or Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain. For the forest people it
was not an hour in which to talk. The moon had risen swiftly, and the
stars were out. Where there had been gloom, the world was now a flood of
gold and silver light. At first Carrigan allowed this to filter between
his fingers; then he opened his eyes. He felt more evenly balanced
again.</p>

<p>Straight in front of him was Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain. The curtain of
dusk had risen from between them, and she was full in the radiance of the
moon. She was no longer paddling, but was looking straight ahead. To
Cardigan her figure was exquisitely girlish as he saw it now. She was
bareheaded, as he had seen tier first, and her hair hung down her back
like a shimmering mass of velvety sable in the star-and-moon glow.
Something told Carrigan she was going to turn her face in his direction,
and he dropped his hand over his eyes again, leaving a space between the
fingers. He was right in his guess. She fronted the moon, looking at him
closely&mdash;rather anxiously, he thought. She even leaned a little
toward him that she might see more clearly. Then she turned and resumed
her paddling.</p>

<p>Carrigan was a bit elated. Probably she had looked at him a number of
times like that during the past half-hour. And she was disturbed. She was
worrying about him. The thought of being a murderess was beginning to
frighten her. In spite of the beauty of her eyes and hair and the slim
witchery of her body he had no sympathy for her. He told himself that he
would give a year of his life to have her down at Barracks this minute.
He would never forget that three-quarters of an hour behind the rock, not
if he lived to be a hundred. And if he did live, she was going to pay,
even if she was lovelier than Venus and all the Graces combined. He felt
irritated with himself that he should have observed in such a silly way
the sable glow of her hair in the moonlight. And her eyes. What the deuce
did prettiness matter in the present situation? The sister of Fanchet,
the mail robber, was beautiful, but her beauty had failed to save
Fanchet. The Law had taken him in spite of the tears in Carmin Fanchet's
big black eyes, and in that particular instance he was the Law. And
Carmin Fanchet was pretty&mdash;deucedly pretty. Even the Old Man's heart
had been stirred by her loveliness.</p>

<p>"A shame!" he had said to Carrigan. "A shame!" But the rascally
Fanchet was hung by the neck until he was dead.</p>

<p>Carrigan drew himself up slowly until he was sitting erect. He
wondered what Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain would say if he told her about
Carmin. But there was a big gulf between the names Fanchet and Boulain.
The Fanchets had come from the dance halls of Alaska. They were bad, both
of them. At least, so they had judged Carmin Fanchet&mdash;along with her
brother. And Boulain&mdash;</p>

<p>His hand, in dropping to his side, fell upon the butt of his pistol.
Neither Bateese nor the girl had thought of disarming him. It was
careless of them, unless Bateese was keeping a good eye on him from
behind.</p>

<p>A new sort of thrill crept into Carrigan's blood. He began to see
where he had made a huge error in not playing his part more cleverly. It
was this girl Jeanne who had shot him. It was Jeanne who had stood over
him in that last moment when he had made an effort to use his pistol. It
was she who had tried to murder him and who had turned faint-hearted when
it came to finishing the job. But his knowledge of these things he should
have kept from her. Then, when the proper moment came, he would have been
in a position to act. Even now it might be possible to cover his blunder.
He leaned toward her again, determined to make the effort.</p>

<p>"I want to ask your pardon," he said. "May I?"</p>

<p>His voice startled her. It was as if the stinging tip of a whip- lash
had touched her bare neck. He was smiling when she turned. In her face
and eyes was a relief which she made no effort to repress.</p>

<p>"You thought I might be dead," he laughed softly. "I'm not, Miss
Jeanne. I'm very much alive again. It was that accursed fever&mdash;and I
want to ask your pardon! I think&mdash;I know&mdash;that I accused you of
shooting me. It's impossible. I couldn't think of it&mdash;In my clear
mind. I am quite sure that I know the rascally half-breed who pot-
shotted me like that. And it was you who came in time, and frightened him
away, and saved my life. Will you forgive me&mdash;and accept my
gratitude?"</p>

<p>There came into the glowing eyes of the girl a reflection of his own
smile. It seemed to him that he saw the corners of her mouth tremble a
little before she answered him.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are feeling better, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"And you will forgive me for&mdash;for saying such beastly things to
you?"</p>

<p>She was lovely when she smiled, and she was smiling at him now. "If
you want to be forgiven for lying, yes," she said. "I forgive you that,
because it is sometimes your business to lie. It was I who tried to kill
you, m'sieu. And you know it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must not talk, m'sieu. It is not good for you: Bateese, will you
tell m'sieu not to talk?"</p>

<p>Carrigan heard a movement behind him.</p>

<p>"M'sieu, you will stop ze talk or I brak hees head wit' ze paddle in
my han'!" came the voice of Bateese close to his shoulder. "Do I mak' ze
word plain so m'sieu compren'?"</p>

<p>"I get you, old man," grunted Carrigan. "I get you&mdash;both!"</p>

<p>And he leaned back against his dunnage-sack, staring again at the
witching slimness of the lovely Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain as she calmly
resumed her paddling in the bow of the canoe.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_6">V</a></h3>

<p>In the few minutes following the efficient and unexpected warning of
Bateese an entirely new element of interest entered into the situation
for David Carrigan. He had more than once assured himself that he had
made a success of his profession of man- hunting not because he was
brighter than the other fellow, but largely because he possessed a sense
of humor and no vanities to prick. He was in the game because he loved
the adventure of it. He was loyal to his duty, but he was not a
worshipper of the law, nor did he covet the small monthly stipend of
dollars and cents that came of his allegiance to it. As a member of the
Scarlet Police, and especially of "N" Division, he felt the pulse and
thrill of life as he loved to live it. And the greatest of all thrills
came when he was after a man as clever as himself, or cleverer.</p>

<p>This time it was a woman&mdash;or a girl! He had not yet made up his
mind which she was. Her voice, low and musical, her poise, and the
tranquil and unexcitable loveliness of her face had made him, at first,
register her as a woman. Yet as he looked at the slim girlishness of her
figure in the bow of the canoe, accentuated by the soft sheen of her
partly unbraided hair, he wondered if she were eighteen or thirty. It
would take the clear light of day to tell him. But whether a girl or a
woman, she had handled him so cleverly that the unpleasantness of his
earlier experience began to give way slowly to an admiration for her
capability.</p>

<p>He wondered what the superintendent of "N" Division would say if he
could see Black Roger Audemard's latest trailer propped up here in the
center of the canoe, the prisoner of a velvety-haired but dangerously
efficient bit of feminine loveliness&mdash;and a bull- necked,
chimpanzee-armed half-breed!</p>

<p>Bateese had confirmed the suspicion that he was a prisoner, even
though this mysterious pair were bent on saving his life. Why it was
their desire to keep life in him when only a few hours ago one of them
had tried to kill him was a. question which only the future could answer.
He did not bother himself with that problem now. The present was
altogether too interesting, and there was but little doubt that other
developments equally important were close at hand. The attitude of both
Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain and her piratical-looking henchman was
sufficient evidence of that. Bateese had threatened to knock his head
off, and he could have sworn that the girl&mdash;or woman&mdash;had
smiled her approbation of the threat. Yet he held no grudge against
Bateese. An odd sort of liking for the man began to possess him, just as
he found himself powerless to resist an ingrowing admiration for
Marie-Anne. The existence of Black Roger Audemard became with him a sort
of indefinite reality. Black Roger was a long way off. Marie-Anne and
Bateese were very near. He began thinking of her as Marie-Anne. He liked
the name. It was the Boulain part of it that worked in him with an
irritating insistence.</p>

<p>For the first time since the canoe journey had begun, he looked beyond
the darkly glowing head and the slender figure in the bow. It was a
splendid night. Ahead of him the river was like a rippling sheet of
molten silver. On both sides, a quarter of a mile apart, rose the walls
of the forest, like low-hung, oriental tapestries. The sky seemed near,
loaded with stars, and the moon, rising with almost perceptible movement
toward the zenith, had changed from red to a mellow gold. Carrigan's soul
always rose to this glory of the northern light. Youth and vigor, he told
himself, must always exist under those unpolluted lights of the upper
worlds, the unspeaking things which had told him more than he had ever
learned from the mouths of other men. They stood for his religion, his
faith, his belief in the existence of things greater than the
insignificant spark which animated his own body. He appreciated them most
when there was stillness. And tonight it was still. It was so quiet that
the trickling of the paddles was like subdued music. From the forest
there came no sound. Yet he knew there was life there, wide-eyed,
questing life, life that moved on velvety wing and padded foot, just as
he and Marie-Anne and the half-breed Bateese were moving in the canoe. To
have called out in this hour would have taken an effort, for a supreme
and invisible Hand seemed to have commanded stillness upon the earth.</p>

<p>And then there came droning upon his ears a break in the stillness,
and as he listened, the shores closed slowly in, narrowing the channel
until he saw giant masses of gray rock replacing the thick verdure of
balsam, spruce, and cedar. The moaning grew louder, and the rocks climbed
skyward until they hung in great cliffs. There could be but one meaning
to this sudden change. They were close to LE SAINT-ESPRIT
RAPIDE&mdash;the Holy Ghost Rapids. Carrigan was astonished. That day at
noon he had believed the Holy Ghost to be twenty or thirty miles below
him. Now they were at its mouth, and he saw that Bateese and Jeanne
Marie-Anne Boulain were quietly and unexcitedly preparing to run that
vicious stretch of water. Unconsciously he gripped the gunwales of the
canoe with both hands as the sound of the rapids grew into low and sullen
thunder. In the moonlight ahead he could see the rock walls closing in
until the channel was crushed between two precipitous ramparts, and the
moon and stars, sending their glow between those walls, lighted up a
frothing path of water that made Carrigan hold his breath. He would have
portaged this place even in broad day.</p>

<p>He looked at the girl in the bow. The slender figure Was a little more
erect, the glowing head held a little higher. In those moments he would
have liked to see her face, the wonderful something that must be in her
eyes as she rode fearlessly into the teeth of the menace ahead. For he
could see that she was not afraid, that she was facing this thing with a
sort of exultation, that there was something about it which thrilled her
until every drop of blood in her body was racing with the impetus of the
stream itself. Eddies of wind puffing out from between the chasm walls
tossed her loose hair about her back in a glistening veil. He saw a long
strand of it trailing over the edge of the canoe into the water. It made
him shiver, and he wanted to cry out to Bateese that he was a fool for
risking her life like this. He forgot that he was the one helpless
individual in the canoe, and that an upset would mean the end for him,
while Bateese and his companion might still fight on. His thought and his
vision were focused on the girl&mdash;and what lay straight ahead. A mass
of froth, like a windrow of snow, rose up before them, and the canoe
plunged into it with the swiftness of a shot. It spattered in his face,
and blinded him for an instant. Then they were out of it, and he fancied
he heard a note of laughter from the girl in the bow. In the next breath
he called himself a fool for imagining that. For the run was dead ahead,
and the girl became vibrant with life, her paddle flashing in and out,
while from her lips came sharp, clear cries which brought from Eateese
frog-like bellows of response. The walls shot past; inundations rose and
plunged under them; black rocks whipped with caps of foam raced up-stream
with the speed of living things; the roar became a drowning voice, and
then&mdash;as if outreached by the wings of a swifter thing&mdash;dropped
suddenly behind them. Smoother water lay ahead. The channel broadened.
Moonlight filled it with a clearer radiance, and Carrigan saw the girl's
hair glistening wet, and her arms dripping.</p>

<p>For the first time he turned about and faced Bateese. The half- breed
was grinning like a Cheshire cat!</p>

<p>"You're a confoundedly queer pair!" grunted Carrigan, and he turned
about again to find Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain as unconcerned as though
running the Holy Ghost Rapids in the glow of the moon was nothing more
than a matter of play.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to keep his heart from beating a little
faster as he watched her, even though he was trying to regard her in a
most professional sort of way. He reminded himself that she was an
iniquitous little Jezebel who had almost murdered him. Carmin Fanchet had
been like her, an AME DAMNEE&mdash;a fallen angel&mdash; but his business
was not sympathy in such matters as these. At the same time he could not
resist the lure of both her audacity and her courage, and he found
himself all at once asking himself the amazing question as to what her
relationship might be to Bateese. It occurred to him rather unpleasantly
that there had been something distinctly proprietary in the way the
half-breed had picked her up on the sand, and that Bateese had shown no
hesitation a little later in threatening to knock his head off unless he
stopped talking to her. He wondered if Bateese was a Boulain.</p>

<p>The two or three minutes of excitement in the boiling waters of the
Holy Ghost had acted like medicine on Carrigan. It seemed to him that
something had given way in his head, relieving him of an oppression that
had been like an iron hoop drawn tightly about his skull. He did not want
Bateese to suspect this change in him, and he slouched lower against the
dunnage-pack with his eyes still on the girl. He was finding it
increasingly difficult to keep from looking at her. She had resumed her
paddling, and Bateese was putting mighty efforts in his strokes now, so
that the narrow, birchbark canoe shot like an arrow with the
down-sweeping current of the river. A few hundred yards below was a twist
in the channel, and as the canoe rounded this, taking the shoreward curve
with dizzying swiftness, a wide, still straight-water lay ahead. And far
down this Carrigan saw the glow of fires.</p>

<p>The forest had drawn back from the river, leaving in its place a
broken tundra of rock and shale and a wide strip of black sand along the
edge of the stream itself. Carrigan knew what it was&mdash;an upheaval of
the tar-sand country so common still farther north, the beginning of that
treasure of the earth which would some day make the top of the American
continent one of the Eldorados of the world. The fires drew nearer, and
suddenly the still night was broken by the wild chanting of men. David
heard behind him a choking note in the throat of Bateese. A soft word
came from the lips of the girl, and it seemed to Carrigan that her head
was held higher in the moon glow. The chant increased in volume, a
rhythmic, throbbing, savage music that for a hundred and fifty years had
come from the throats of men along the Three Rivers. It thrilled Carrigan
as they bore down upon it. It was not song as civilization would have
counted song. It was like an explosion, an exultation of human voice
unchained, ebullient with the love of life, savage in its good-humor. It
was LE GAITE DE COEUR of the rivermen, who thought and sang as their
forefathers did in the days of Radisson and good Prince Rupert; it was
their merriment, their exhilaration, their freedom and optimism, reaching
up to the farthest stars. In that song men were straining their vocal
muscles, shouting to beat out their nearest neighbor, bellowing like
bulls in a frenzy of sudden fun. And then, as suddenly as it had risen in
the night, the clamor of voices died away. A single shout came up the
river. Carrigan thought he heard a low rumble of laughter. A tin pan
banged against another. A dog howled. The flat of an oar played a tattoo
for a moment on the bottom of a boat. Then one last yell from a single
throat&mdash;and the night was silent again.</p>

<p>And that was the Boulain Brigade&mdash;singing at this hour of the
night, when men should have been sleeping if they expected to be up with
the sun. Carrigan stared ahead. Shortly his adventure would take a new
twist. Something was bound to happen when they got ashore. The peculiar
glow of the fires had puzzled him. Now he began to understand. Jeanne
Marie-Anne Boulain's men were camped in the edge of the tar-sands and had
lighted a number of natural gas-jets that came up out of the earth. Many
times he had seen fires like these burning up and down the Three Rivers.
He had lighted fires of his own; he had cooked over them and had
afterward had the fun and excitement of extinguishing them with pails of
water. But he had never seen anything quite like this that was unfolding
itself before his eyes now. There were seven of the fires over an area of
half an acre&mdash;spouts of yellowish flame burning like giant torches
ten or fifteen feet in the air. And between them he very soon made out
great bustle and activity. Many figures were moving about. They looked
like dwarfs at first, gnomes at play in a little world made out of
witchcraft. But Bateese was sending the canoe nearer with powerful
strokes, and the figures grew taller, and the spouts of flame higher.
Then he knew what was happening. The Boulain men were taking advantage of
the cool hours of the night and were tarring up.</p>

<p>He could smell the tar, and he could see the big York boats drawn up
in the circle of yellowish light. There were half a dozen of them, and
men stripped to the waist were smearing the bottoms of the boats with
boiling tar and pitch. In the center was a big, black cauldron steaming
over a gas-jet, and between this cauldron and the boats men were running
back and forth with pails. Still nearer to the huge kettle other men were
filling a row of kegs with the precious black GOUDRON that oozed up from
the bowels of the earth, forming here and there jet-black pools that
Carrigan could see glistening in the flare of the gas-lamps. He figured
there were thirty men at work. Six big York boats were turned keel up in
the black sand. Close inshore, just outside the circle of light, was a
single scow.</p>

<p>Toward this scow Bateese sent the canoe. And as they drew nearer,
until the laboring men ashore were scarcely a stone's throw away, the
weirdness of the scene impressed itself more upon Carrigan. Never had he
seen such a crew. There were no Indians among them. Lithe, quick-moving,
bare-headed, their naked arms and shoulders gleaming in the ghostly
illumination, they were racing against time with the boiling tar and
pitch in the cauldron. They did not see the approach of the canoe, and
Bateese did not draw their attention to it. Quietly he drove the
birchbark under the shadow of the big bateau. Hands were waiting to seize
and steady it. Carrigan caught but a glimpse of the faces. In another
instant the girl was aboard the scow, and Bateese was bending over him. A
second time he was picked up like a child in the chimpanzee-like arms of
the half-breed. The moonlight showed him a scow bigger than he had ever
seen on the upper river, and two-thirds of it seemed to be cabin. Into
this cabin Bateese carried him, and in darkness laid him upon what
Carrigan thought must be a cot built against the wall. He made no sound,
but let himself fall limply upon it. He listened to Bateese as he moved
about, and closed his eyes when Bateese struck a match. A moment later he
heard the door of the cabin close behind the half-breed. Not until then
did he open his eyes and sit up.</p>

<p>He was alone. And what he saw in the next few moments drew an
exclamation of amazement from him. Never had he seen a cabin like this on
the Three Rivers. It was thirty feet long if an inch, and at least eight
feet wide. The walls and ceiling were of polished cedar; the floor was of
cedar closely matched. It was the exquisite finish and craftsmanship of
the woodwork that caught his eyes first. Then his astonished senses
seized upon the other things. Under his feet was a soft rug of dark green
velvet. Two magnificent white bearskins lay between him and the end of
the room. The walls were hung with pictures, and at the four windows were
curtains of ivory lace draped with damask. The lamp which Bateese had
lighted was fastened to the wall close to him. It was of polished silver
and threw a brilliant light softened by a shade of old gold. There were
three other lamps like this, unlighted. The far end of the room was in
deep shadow, but Carrigan made out the thing he was staring at&mdash;a
piano. He rose to his feet, disbelieving his eyes, and made his way
toward it. He passed between chairs. Near the piano was another door, and
a wide divan of the same soft, green upholstery. Looking back, he saw
that what he had been lying upon was another divan. And dose to this were
book-shelves, and a table on which were magazines and papers and a
woman's workbasket, and in the workbasket&mdash;sound asleep&mdash;a
cat!</p>

<p>And then, over the table and the sleeping cat, his eyes rested upon a
triangular banner fastened to the wall. In white against a background of
black was a mighty polar bear holding at bay a horde of Arctic wolves.
And suddenly the thing he had been fighting to recall came to
Carrigan&mdash;the great bear&mdash;the fighting wolves&mdash;the crest
of St. Pierre Boulain!</p>

<p>He took a quick step toward the table&mdash;then caught at the back of
a chair. Confound his head! Or was it the big bateau rocking under his
feet? The cat seemed to be turning round in its basket. There were half a
dozen banners instead of one; the lamp was shaking in its bracket; the
floor was tilting, everything was becoming hideously contorted and out of
place. A shroud of darkness gathered about him, and through that darkness
Carrigan staggered blindly toward the divan. He reached it just in time
to fall upon it like a dead man.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_7">VI</a></h3>

<p>For what seemed to be an interminable time after the final breakdown
of his physical strength David Carrigan lived in a black world where a
horde of unseen little devils were shooting red-hot arrows into his
brain. He did not sense the fact of human presence; nor that the divan
had been changed into a bed and the four lamps lighted, and that
wrinkled, brown hands with talon-like fingers were performing a miracle
of wilderness surgery upon him. He did not see the age-old face of
Nepapinas&mdash;"The Wandering Bolt of Lightning"&mdash;as the bent and
tottering Cree called upon all his eighty years of experience to bring
him back to life. And he did not see Bateese, stolid-faced, silent, nor
the dead-white face and wide-open, staring eyes of Jeanne Marie-Anne
Boulain as her slim, white fingers worked with the old medicine man's. He
was in a gulf of blackness that writhed with the spirits of torment. He
fought them and cried out against them, and his fighting and his cries
brought the look of death itself into the eyes of the girl who was over
him. He did not hear her voice nor feel the soothing of her hands, nor
the powerful grip of Bateese as he held him when the critical moments
came. And Nepapinas, like a machine that had looked upon death a thousand
times, gave no rest to his claw-like fingers until the work was
done&mdash;and it was then that something came to drive the
arrow-shooting devils out of the darkness that was smothering
Carrigan.</p>

<p>After that Carrigan lived through an eternity of unrest, a life in
which he seemed powerless and yet was always struggling for supremacy
over things that were holding him down. There were lapses in it, like the
hours of oblivion that come with sleep, and there were other times when
he seemed keenly alive, yet unable to move or act. The darkness gave way
to flashes of light, and in these flashes he began to see things,
curiously twisted, fleeting, and yet fighting themselves insistently upon
his senses. He was back in the hot sand again, and this time he heard the
voices of Jeanne Marie-Anne and Golden-Hair, and Golden-Hair flaunted a
banner in his face, a triangular pennon of black on which a huge bear was
fighting white Arctic wolves, and then she would run away from him,
crying out&mdash;"St. Pierre Boulain&mdash;St. Pierre Boulain&mdash;" and
the last he could see of her was her hair flaming like fire in the sun.
But it was always the other&mdash;the dark hair and dark eyes &mdash;that
came to him when the little devils returned to assault him with their
arrows. From somewhere she would come out of darkness and frighten them
away. He could hear her voice like a whisper in his ears, and the touch
of her hands comforted him and quieted his pain. After a time he grew to
be afraid when the darkness swallowed her up, and in that darkness he
would call for her, and always he heard her voice in answer.</p>

<p>Then came a long oblivion. He floated through cool space away from the
imps of torment; his bed was of downy clouds, and on these clouds he
drifted with a great shining river under him; and at last the cloud he
was in began to shape itself into walls and on these walls were pictures,
and a window through which the sun was shining, and a black
pennon&mdash;and he heard a soft, wonderful music that seemed to come to
him faintly from another world. Other creatures were at work in his brain
now. They were building up and putting together the loose ends of things.
Carrigan became one of them, working so hard that frequently a pair of
dark eyes came out of the dawning of things to stop him, and quieting
hands and a voice soothed him to rest. The hands and the voice became
very intimate. He missed them when they were not near, especially the
hands, and he was always groping for them to make sure they had not gone
away.</p>

<p>Only once after the floating cloud transformed itself into the walls
of the bateau cabin did the chaotic darkness of the sands fully possess
him again. In that darkness he heard a voice. It was not the voice of
Golden-Hair, or of Bateese, or of Jeanne Marie- Anne. It was close to his
ears. And in that darkness that smothered him there was something
terrible about it as it droned slowly the
words&mdash;"HAS-ANY-ONE-SEEN-BLACK-ROGER-AUDEMARD?" He tried to answer,
to call back to it, and the voice came again, repeating the words,
emotionless, hollow, as if echoing up out of a grave. And still harder he
struggled to reply to it, to say that he was David Carrigan, and that he
was out on the trail of Black Roger Audemard, and that Black Roger was
far north. And suddenly it seemed to him that the voice changed into the
flesh and blood of Black Roger himself, though he could not see in the
darkness&mdash; and he reached out, gripping fiercely at the warm
substance of flesh, until he heard another voice, the voice of Jeanne
Marie- Anne Boulain, entreating him to let his victim go. It was this
time that his eyes shot open, wide and seeing, and straight over him was
the face of Jeanne Marie-Anne, nearer him than it had been even in the
visionings of his feverish mind. His fingers were clutching her
shoulders, gripping like steel hooks.</p>

<p>"M'sieu&mdash;M'sieu David!" she was crying.</p>

<p>For a moment he stared; then his hands and fingers relaxed, and his
arms dropped limply. "Pardon&mdash;I&mdash;I was dreaming," he struggled
weakly. "I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had seen the pain in her face. Now, changing swiftly, it lighted up
with relief and gladness. His vision, cleared by long darkness, saw the
change come in an instant like a flash of sunshine. And then&mdash;so
near that he could have touched her&mdash;she was smiling down into his
eyes. He smiled back. It took an effort, for his face felt stiff and
unnatural.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming&mdash;of a man&mdash;named Roger Audemard," he
continued to apologize. "Did I&mdash;hurt you?"</p>

<p>The smile on her lips was gone as swiftly as it had come. "A little,
m'sieu. I am glad you are better. You have been very sick."</p>

<p>He raised a hand to his face. The bandage was there, and also a
stubble of beard on his cheeks. He was puzzled. This morning he had
fastened his steel mirror to the side of a tree and shaved.</p>

<p>"It was three days ago you were hurt," she said quietly. "This is the
afternoon of the third day. You have been in a great fever. Nepapinas, my
Indian doctor, saved your life. You must lie quietly now. You have been
talking a great deal."</p>

<p>"About&mdash;Black Roger?" he said.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Golden&mdash;Hair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of Golden&mdash;Hair."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;some one else&mdash;with dark hair&mdash;and dark
eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It may be, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"And of little devils with bows and arrows, and of polar bears, and
white wolves, and of a great lord of the north who calls himself St.
Pierre Boulain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of all those."</p>

<p>"Then I haven't anything more to tell you," grunted David. "I guess
I've told you all I know. You shot me, back there. And here I am. What
are you going to do next?"</p>

<p>"Call Bateese," she answered promptly, and she rose swiftly from
beside him and moved toward the door.</p>

<p>He made no effort to call her back. His wits were working slowly,
readjusting themselves after a carnival in chaos, and he scarcely sensed
that she was gone until the cabin door closed behind her. Then again he
raised a hand to his face and felt his beard. Three days! He turned his
head so that he could take in the length of the cabin. It was filled with
subdued sunlight now, a western sun that glowed softly, giving depth and
richness to the colors on the floor and walls, lighting up the piano
keys, suffusing the pictures with a warmth of life. David's eyes traveled
slowly to his own feet. The divan had been opened and transformed into a
bed. He was undressed. He had on somebody's white nightgown. And there
was a big bunch of wild roses on the table where three days ago the cat
had been sleeping in the work-basket. His head cleared swiftly, and he
raised himself a little on one elbow, with extreme caution, and listened.
The big bateau was not moving. It was still tied up, but he could hear no
voices out where the tar-sands were.</p>

<p>He dropped back on his pillow, and his eyes rested on the black
pennon. His blood stirred again as he looked at the white bear and the
fighting wolves. Wherever men rode the waters of the Three Rivers that
pennon was known. Yet it was not common. Seldom was it seen, and never
had it come south of Chipewyan. Many things came to Carrigan now, things
that he had heard at the Landing and up and down the rivers. Once he had
read the tail-end of a report the Superintendent of "N" Division had sent
in to headquarters.</p>

<p>"We do not know this St. Pierre. Few men have seen him out of his own
country, the far headwaters of the Yellowknife, where he rules like a
great overlord. Both the Yellowknives and the Dog Ribs call him KICHEOO
KIMOW, or King, and the same rumors say there is never starvation or
plague in his regions; and it is fact that neither the Hudson's Bay nor
Revillon Brothers in their cleverest generalship and trade have been able
to uproot his almost dynastic jurisdiction. The Police have had no reason
to investigate or interfere."</p>

<p>At least that was the gist of what Carrigan had read in McVane's
report. But he had never associated it with the name of Boulain. It was
of St. Pierre that he had heard stories, St. Pierre and his black pennon
with its white bear and fighting wolves. And so&mdash;it was St. Pierre
BOULAIN!</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and thought of the long winter weeks he had passed
at Hay River Post, watching for Fanchet, the mail robber. It was there he
had heard most about this St. Pierre, and yet no one he had talked with
had ever seen him; no one knew whether he was old or young, a pigmy or a
giant. Some stories said that he was strong, that he could twist a
gun-barrel double in his hands; others said that he was old, very old, so
that he never set forth with his brigades that brought down each year a
treasure of furs to be exchanged for freight. And never did a Dog Rib or
a Yellowknife open his mouth about KICHEOO KIMOW St. Pierre, the master
of their unmapped domains. In that great country north and west of the
Great Slave he remained an enigma and a sphinx. If he ever came out with
his brigades, he did not disclose his identity, so that if one saw a
fleet of boats or canoes with the St. Pierre pennon, one had to make his
own guess whether St. Pierre himself was there or not. But these things
were known&mdash;that the keenest, quickest, and strongest men in the
northland ran the St. Pierre brigades, that they brought out the richest
cargoes of furs, and that they carried back with them into the secret
fastnesses of their wilderness the greatest cargoes of freight that
treasure could buy. So much the name St. Pierre dragged out of Carrigan's
memory. It came to him now why the name "Boulain" had pounded so
insistently in his brain. He had seen this pennon with its white bear and
fighting wolves only once before, and that had been over a Boulain scow
at Chipewyan. But his memory had lost its grip on that incident while
retaining vividly its hold on the stories and rumors of the mystery-man,
St. Pierre.</p>

<p>Carrigan pulled himself a little higher on his pillow and with a new
interest scanned the cabin. He had never heard of Boulain women. Yet here
was the proof of their existence and of the greatness that ran in the red
blood of their veins. The history of the great northland, hidden in the
dust-dry tomes and guarded documents of the great company, had always
been of absorbing interest to him. He wondered why it was that the
outside world knew so little about it and believed so little of what it
heard. A long time ago he had penned an article telling briefly the story
of this half of a great continent in which for two hundred years romance
and tragedy and strife for mastery had gone on in a way to thrill the
hearts of men. He had told of huge forts with thirty- foot stone
bastions, of fierce wars, of great warships that had fired their
broadsides in battle in the ice-filled waters of Hudson's Bay. He had
described the coming into this northern world of thousands and tens of
thousands of the bravest and best-blooded men of England and France, and
how these thousands had continued to come, bringing with them the names
of kings, of princes, and of great lords, until out of the savagery of
the north rose an aristocracy of race built up of the strongest men of
the earth. And these men of later days he had called Lords of the
North&mdash;men who had held power of life and death in the hollow of
their hands until the great company yielded up its suzerainty to the
Government of the Dominion in 1870; men who were kings in their domains,
whose word was law, who were more powerful in their wilderness castles
than their mistress over the sea, the Queen of Britain.</p>

<p>And Carrigan, after writing of these things, had stuffed his
manuscript away in the bottom of his chest at barracks, for he believed
that it was not in his power to do justice to the people of this
wilderness world that he loved. The powerful old lords were gone. Like
dethroned monarchs, stripped to the level of other men, they lived in the
memories of what had been. Their might now lay in trade. No more could
they set out to wage war upon their rivals with powder and ball. Keen
wit, swift dogs, and the politics of barter had taken the place of
deadlier things. LE FACTEUR could no longer slay or command that others
be slain. A mightier hand than his now ruled the destinies of the
northern people&mdash;the hand of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police.</p>

<p>It was this thought, the thought that Law and one of the powerful
forces of the wilderness had met in this cabin of the big bateau, that
came to Carrigan as he drew himself still higher against his pillow. A
greater thrill possessed him than the thrill of his hunt for Black Roger
Audemard. Black Roger was a murderer, a wholesale murderer and a fiend, a
Moloch for whom there could be no pity. Of all men the Law wanted Black
Roger most, and he, David Carrigan, was the chosen one to consummate its
desire. Yet in spite of that he felt upon him the strange unrest of a
greater adventure than the quest for Black Roger. It was like an
impending thing that could not be seen, urging him, rousing his faculties
from the slough into which they had fallen because of his wound and
sickness. It was, after all, the most vital of all things, a matter of
his own life. Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain had tried to kill him
deliberately, with malice and intent. That she had saved him afterward
only added to the necessity of an explanation, and he was determined that
he would have that explanation and settle the present matter before he
allowed another thought of Black Roger to enter his head.</p>

<p>This resolution reiterated itself in his mind as the machine-like
voice of duty. He was not thinking of the Law, and yet the consciousness
of his accountability to that Law kept repeating itself. In the very face
of it Carrigan knew that something besides the moral obligation of the
thing was urging him, something that was becoming deeply and dangerously
personal. At least&mdash;he tried to think of it as dangerous. And that
danger was his unbecoming interest in the girl herself. It was an
interest distinctly removed from any ethical code that might have
governed him in his experience with Carmin Fanchet, for instance.
Comparatively, if they had stood together, Carmin would have been the
lovelier. But he would have looked longer at Jeanne Marie-Anne
Boulain.</p>

<p>He conceded the point, smiling a bit grimly as he continued to study
that part of the cabin which he could see from his pillow. He had lost
interest&mdash;temporarily at least&mdash;in Black Roger Audemard. Not
long ago the one question to which, above all others, he had desired an
answer was, why had Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain worked so desperately to
kill him and so hard to save him afterward? Now, as he looked about him,
the question which repeated itself insistently was, what relationship did
she bear to this mysterious lord of the north, St. Pierre?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly she was his daughter, for whom St. Pierre had built this
luxurious barge of state. A fierce-blooded offspring, he thought, one
like Cleopatra herself, not afraid to kill&mdash;and equally quick to
make amends when there was a mistake.</p>

<p>There came the quiet opening of the cabin door to break in upon his
thought. He hoped it was Jeanne Marie-Anne returning to him. It was
Nepapinas. The old Indian stood over him for a moment and put a cold,
claw-like hand to his forehead. He grunted and nodded his head, his
little sunken eyes gleaming with satisfaction. Then he put his hands
under David's arms and lifted him until he was sitting upright, with
three or four pillows at his back.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Carrigan. "That makes me feel better. And&mdash;if you
don't mind&mdash;my last lunch was three days ago, boiled prunes and a
piece of bannock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have brought you something to eat, M'sieu David," broke in a soft
voice behind him.</p>

<p>Nepapinas slipped away, and Jeanne Marie-Anne stood in his place.
David stared up at her, speechless. He heard the door close behind the
old Indian. Then Jeanne Marie-Anne drew up a chair, so that for the first
time he could see her clear eyes with the light of day full upon her.</p>

<p>He forgot that a few days ago she had been his deadliest enemy. He
forgot the existence of a man named Black Roger Audemard. Her slimness
was as it had pictured itself to him in the hot sands. Her hair was as he
had seen it there. It was coiled upon her head like ropes of spun silk,
jet-black, glowing softly. But it was her eyes he stared at, and so fixed
was his look that the red lips trembled a bit on the verge of a smile.
She was not embarrassed. There was no color in the clear whiteness of her
skin, except that redness of her lips.</p>

<p>"I thought you had black eyes," he said bluntly. "I'm glad you
haven't. I don't like them. Yours are as brown as&mdash;as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, m'sieu," she interrupted him, sitting down close beside him.
"Will you eat&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>A spoon was at his mouth, and he was forced to take it in or have its
contents spilled over him. The spoon continued to move quickly between
the bowl and his mouth. He was robbed of speech. And the girl's eyes, as
surely as he was alive, were beginning to laugh at him. They were a
wonderful brown, with little, golden specks in them, like the freckles he
had seen in wood-violets. Her lips parted. Between their bewitching
redness he saw the gleam of her white teeth. In a crowd, with her
glorious hair covered and her eyes looking straight ahead, one would not
have picked her out. But close, like this, with her eyes smiling at him,
she was adorable.</p>

<p>Something of Carrigan's thoughts must have shown in his face, for
suddenly the girl's lips tightened a little, and the warmth went out of
her eyes, leaving them cold and distant. He finished the soup, and she
rose again to her feet.</p>

<p>"Please don't go," he said. "If you do, I think I shall get up and
follow. I am quite sure I am entitled to a little something more than
soup."</p>

<p>"Nepapinas says that you may have a bit of boiled fish for supper,"
she assured him.</p>

<p>"You know I don't mean that. I want to know why you shot me, and what
you think you are going to do with me."</p>

<p>"I shot you by mistake&mdash;and&mdash;I don't know just what to do
with you," she said, looking at him tranquilly, but with what he thought
was a growing shadow of perplexity in her eyes. "Bateese says to fasten a
big stone to your neck and throw you in the river. But Bateese doesn't
always mean what he says. I don't think he is quite as
bloodthirsty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;As the young lady who tried to murder me behind the rock,"
Carrigan interjected.</p>

<p>"Exactly, m'sieu. I don't think he would throw you into the river
&mdash;unless I told him to. And I don't believe I am going to ask him to
do that," she added, the soft glow flashing back into her eyes for an
instant. "Not after the splendid work Nepapinas has done on your head.
St. Pierre must see that. And then, if St. Pierre wishes to finish you,
why&mdash;" She shrugged her slim shoulders and made a little gesture
with her hands.</p>

<p>In that same moment there came over her a change as sudden as the
passing of light itself. It was as if a thing she was hiding had broken
beyond her control for an instant and had betrayed her. The gesture died.
The glow went out of her eyes, and in its place came a light that was
almost fear&mdash;or pain. She came nearer to Carrigan again, and
somehow, looking up at her, he thought of the little brush warbler
singing at the end of its birch twig to give him courage. It must have
been because of her throat, white and soft, which he saw pulsing like a
beating heart before she spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I have made a terrible mistake, m'sieu David," she said, her voice
barely rising above a whisper. "I'm sorry I hurt you. I thought it was
some one else behind the rock. But I can not tell you more than
that&mdash;ever. And I know it is impossible for us to be friends." She
paused, one of her hands creeping to her bare throat, as if to cover the
throbbing he had seen there.</p>

<p>"Why is it impossible?" he demanded, leaning away from his pillows so
that he might bring himself nearer to her.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;you are of the police, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"The police, yes," he said, his heart thrumming inside his breast. "I
am Sergeant Carrigan. I am out after Roger Audemard, a murderer. But my
commission has nothing to do with the daughter of St. Pierre Boulain.
Please&mdash;let's be friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held out his hand; and in that moment David Carrigan placed another
thing higher than duty&mdash;and in his eyes was the confession of it,
like the glow of a subdued fire. The girl's fingers drew more closely at
her throat, and she made no movement to accept his hand.</p>

<p>"Friends," he repeated. "Friends&mdash;in spite of the police."</p>

<p>Slowly the girl's eyes had widened, as if she saw that new-born thing
riding over all other things in his swiftly beating heart. And afraid of
it, she drew a step away from him.</p>

<p>"I am not St. Pierre Boulain's daughter," she said, forcing the words
out one by one. "I am&mdash;his wife."</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_8">VII</a></h3>

<p>Afterward Carrigan wondered to what depths he had fallen in the first
moments of his disillusionment. Something like shock, perhaps even more
than that, must have betrayed itself in his face. He did not speak.
Slowly his outstretched arm dropped to the white counterpane. Later he
called himself a fool for allowing it to happen, for it was as if he had
measured his proffered friendship by what its future might hold for him.
In a low, quiet voice Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain was saying again that she
was St. Pierre's wife. She was not excited, yet he understood now why it
was he had thought her eyes were very dark. They had changed swiftly. The
violet freckles in them were like little flecks of gold. They were almost
liquid in their glow, neither brown nor black now, and with that threat
of gathering lightning in them. For the first time he saw the slightest
flush of color in her cheeks. It deepened even as he held out his hand
again. He knew that it was not embarrassment. It was the heat of the fire
back of her eyes. "It's&mdash;funny," he said, making an effort to redeem
himself with a lie and smiling. "You rather amaze me. You see, I have
been told this St. Pierre is an old, old man&mdash;so old that he can't
stand on his feet or go with his brigades, and if that is the truth, it
is hard for me to picture you as his wife. But that isn't a reason why we
should not be friends. Is it?"</p>

<p>He felt that he was himself again, except for the three days' growth
of beard on his face. He tried to laugh, but it was rather a poor
attempt. And St. Pierre's wife did not seem to hear him. She was looking
at him, looking into and through him with those wide-open glowing eyes.
Then she sat down, out of reach of the hand which he had held toward
her.</p>

<p>"You are a sergeant of the police," she said, the softness gone
suddenly out of her voice. "You are an honorable man, m'sieu. Your hand
is against all wrong. Is it not so?" It was the voice of an inquisitor.
She was demanding an answer of him.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes, it is so."</p>

<p>The fire in her eyes deepened. "And yet you say you want to be the
friend of a stranger who has tried to kill you. WHY, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>He was cornered. He sensed the humiliation of it, the impossibility of
confessing to her the wild impulse that had moved him before he knew she
was St. Pierre's wife. And she did not wait for him to answer.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this Roger Audemard&mdash;if you catch him&mdash;what will
you do with him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He will be hanged," said David. "He is a murderer."</p>

<p>"And one who tries to kill&mdash;who almost succeeds&mdash;what is the
penalty for that?" She leaned toward him, waiting. Her hands were clasped
tightly in her lap, the spots were brighter in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"From ten to twenty years," he acknowledged. "But, of course, there
may be circumstances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If so, you do not know them," she interrupted him. "You say Roger
Audemard is a murderer. You know I tried to kill you. Then why is it you
would be my friend and Roger Audemard's enemy? Why, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>Carrigan shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. "I shouldn't," he
confessed. "I guess you are proving I was wrong in what I said. I ought
to arrest you and take you back to the Landing as soon as I can. But, you
see, it strikes me there is a big personal element in this. I was the man
almost killed. There was a mistake,&mdash;must have been, for as soon as
you put me out of business you began nursing me back to life again.
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that doesn't change it," insisted St. Pierre's wife. "If there
had been no mistake, there would have been a murder. Do you understand,
m'sieu? If it had been some one else behind that rock, I am quite certain
he would have died. The Law, at least, would have called it murder. If
Roger Audemard is a criminal, then I also am a criminal. And an honorable
man would not make a distinction because one of them is a woman!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Black Roger was a fiend. He deserves no mercy.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, m'sieu!"</p>

<p>She was on her feet, her eyes flaming down upon him. In that moment
her beauty was like the beauty of Carmin Fanchet. The poise of her
slender body, her glowing cheeks, her lustrous hair, her gold-flecked
eyes with the light of diamonds in them, held him speechless.</p>

<p>"I was sorry and went back for you," she said. "I wanted you to live,
after I saw you like that on the sand. Bateese says I was indiscreet,
that I should have left you there to die. Perhaps he is right. And
yet&mdash;even Roger Audemard might have had that pity for you."</p>

<p>She turned quickly, and he heard her moving away from him. Then, from
the door, she said,</p>

<p>"Bateese will make you comfortable, m'sieu."</p>

<p>The door opened and closed. She was gone. And he was alone in the
cabin again.</p>

<p>The swiftness of the change in her amazed him. It was as if he had
suddenly touched fire to an explosive. There had been the flare, but no
violence. She had not raised her voice, yet he heard in it the tremble of
an emotion that was consuming her. He had seen the flame of it in her
face and eyes. Something he had said, or had done, had tremendously upset
her, changing in an instant her attitude toward him. The thought that
came to him made his face burn under its scrub of beard. Did she think he
was a scoundrel? The dropping of his hand, the shock that must have
betrayed itself in his face when she said she was St. Pierre's
wife&mdash;had those things warned her against him? The heat went slowly
out of his face. It was impossible. She could not think that of him. It
must have been a sudden giving way under terrific strain. She had
compared herself to Roger Audemard, and she was beginning to realize her
peril&mdash;that Bateese was right&mdash;that she should have left him to
die in the sand!</p>

<p>The thought pressed itself heavily upon Carrigan. It brought him
suddenly back to a realization of how small a part he had played in this
last half hour in the cabin. He had offered to Pierre's wife a friendship
which he had no right to offer and which she knew he had no right to
offer. He was the Law. And she, like Roger Audemard, was a criminal. Her
quick woman's instinct had told her there could be no distinction between
them, unless there was a reason. And now Carrigan confessed to himself
that there had been a reason. That reason had come to him with the first
glimpse of her as he lay in the hot sand. He had fought against it in the
canoe; it had mastered him in those thrilling moments when he had beheld
this slim, beautiful creature riding fearlessly into the boiling waters
of the Holy Ghost. Her eyes, her hair, the sweet, low voice that had been
with him in his fever, had become a definite and unalterable part of him.
And this must have shown in his eyes and face when he dropped his
hand&mdash;when she told him she was St. Pierre's wife.</p>

<p>And now she was afraid of him! She was regretting that she had not
left him to die. She had misunderstood what she had seen betraying itself
during those few seconds of his proffered friendship. She saw only a man
whom she had nearly killed, a man who represented the Law, a man whose
power held her in the hollow of his hand. And she had stepped back from
him, startled, and had told him that she was not St. Pierre's daughter,
but his wife!</p>

<p>In the science of criminal analysis Carrigan always placed himself in
the position of the other man. And he was beginning to see the present
situation from the view-point of Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain. He was
satisfied that she had made a desperate mistake and that until the last
moment she had believed it was another man behind the rock. Yet she had
shown no inclination to explain away her error. She had definitely
refused to make an explanation. And it was simply a matter of common
sense to concede that there must be a powerful motive for her refusal.
There was but one conclusion for him to arrive at&mdash;the error which
St. Pierre's wife had made in shooting the wrong man was less important
to her than keeping the secret of why she had wanted to kill some other
man.</p>

<p>David was not unconscious of the breach in his own armor. He had
weakened, just as the Superintendent of "N" Division had weakened that
day four years ago when they had almost quarreled over Carmin
Fanchet.</p>

<p>"I'll swear to Heaven she isn't bad, no matter what her brother has
been," McVane had said. "I'll gamble my life on that, Carrigan!"</p>

<p>And because the Chief of Division with sixty years of experience
behind him, had believed that, Carmin Fanchet had not been held as an
accomplice in her brother's evildoing, but had gone back into her
wilderness uncrucified by the law that had demanded the life of her
brother. He would never forget the last time he had seen Carmin Fanchet's
eyes&mdash;great, black, glorious pools of gratitude as they looked at
grizzled old McVane; blazing fires of venomous hatred when they turned on
him. And he had said to McVane,</p>

<p>"The man pays, the woman goes&mdash;justice indeed is blind!"</p>

<p>McVane, not being a stickler on regulations when it came to Carrigan,
had made no answer.</p>

<p>The incident came back vividly to David as he waited for the promised
coming of Bateese. He began to appreciate McVane's point of view, and it
was comforting, because he realized that his own logic was assailable. If
McVane had been comparing the two women now, he knew what his argument
would be. There had been no absolute proof of crime against Carmin
Fanchet, unless to fight desperately for the life of her brother was a
crime. In the case of Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain there was proof. She had
tried to kill. Therefore, of the two, Carmin Fanchet would have been the
better woman in the eyes of McVane.</p>

<p>In spite of the legal force of the argument which he was bringing
against himself, David felt unconvinced. Carmin Fanchet, had she been in
the place of St. Pierre's wife, would have finished him there in the
sand. She would have realized the menace of letting him live and would
probably have commanded Bateese to dump him in the river. St. Pierre's
wife had gone to the other extreme. She was not only repentant, but was
making restitution, for her mistake, and in making that restitution had
crossed far beyond the dead-line of caution. She had frankly told him who
she was; she had brought him into the privacy of what was undeniably her
own home; in her desire to undo what she had done she had hopelessly
enmeshed herself in the net of the Law&mdash;if that Law saw fit to act.
She had done these things with courage and conviction. And of such a
woman, Carrigan thought, St. Pierre must be very proud.</p>

<p>He looked slowly about the cabin again and each thing that he saw was
a living voice breaking up a dream for him. These voices told him that he
was in a temple built because of a man's worship for a woman&mdash;and
that man was St. Pierre. Through the two western windows came the last
glow of the western sun, like a golden benediction finding its way into a
sacred place. Here there was&mdash; or had been&mdash;a great happiness,
for only a great pride and a great happiness could have made it as it
was. Nothing that wealth and toil could drag up out of a civilization a
thousand miles away had been too good for St. Pierre's wife. And about
him, looking more closely, David saw the undisturbed evidences of a
woman's contentment. On the table were embroidery materials with which
she had been working, and a lamp-shade half finished. A woman's magazine
printed in a city four thousand miles away lay open at the fashion
plates. There were other magazines, and many books, and open music above
the white keyboard of the piano, and vases glowing red and yellow with
wild-flowers and silver birch leaves. He could smell the faint perfume of
the fireglow blossoms, red as blood. In a pool of sunlight on one of the
big white bear rugs lay the sleeping cat. And then, at the far end of the
cabin, an ivory- white Cross of Christ glowed for a few moments in a last
homage of the sinking sun.</p>

<p>Uneasiness stole upon him. This was the woman's holy ground, her
sanctuary and her home, and for three days his presence had driven her
from it. There was no other room. In making restitution she had given up
to him her most sacred of all things. And again there rose up in him that
new-born thing which had set strange fires stirring in his heart, and
which from this hour on he knew he must fight until it was dead.</p>

<p>For an hour after the last of the sun was obirterated by the western
mountains he lay in the gloom of coming darkness. Only the lapping of
water under the bateau broke the strange stillness of the evening. He
heard no sound of life, no voice, no tread of feet, and he wondered where
the woman and her men had gone and if the scow was still tied up at the
edge of the tar-sands. And for the first time he asked himself another
question, Where was the man, St. Pierref</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_9">VIII</a></h3>

<p>It was utterly dark in the cabin, when the stillness was broken by low
voices outside. The door opened, and some one came in. A moment later a
match flared up, and in the shifting glow of it Carrigan saw the dark
face of Bateese, the half-breed. One after another he lighted the four
lamps. Not until he had finished did he turn toward the bed. It was then
that David had his first good impression of the man. He was not tall, but
built with the strength of a giant. His arms were long. His shoulders
were stooped. His head was like the head of a stone gargoyle come to
life. Wide-eyed, heavy-lipped, with the high cheek-bones of an Indian and
uncut black hair bound with the knotted red MOUCHOIR, he looked more than
ever like a pirate and a cutthroat to David. Such a man, he thought,
might make play out of the business of murder. And yet, in spite of his
ugliness, David felt again the mysterious inclination to like the
man.</p>

<p>Bateese grinned. It was a huge grin, for his mouth was big. "You ver'
lucky fellow," he announced. "You sleep lak that in nice sof bed an' not
back on san'-bar, dead lak ze feesh I bring you, m'sieu. That ees wan
beeg mistake. Bateese say, 'Tie ze stone roun' hees neck an' mak' heem
wan ANGE DE MER. Chuck heem in ze river, MA BELLE Jeanne!' An' she say
no, mak heem well, an' feed heem feesh. So I bring ze feesh which she
promise, an' when you have eat, I tell you somet'ing!"</p>

<p>He returned to the door and brought back with him a wicker basket.
Then he drew up the table beside Carrigan and proceeded to lay out before
him the boiled fish which St. Pierre's wife had promised him. With it was
bread and an earthen pot of hot tea.</p>

<p>"She say that ees all you have because of ze fever. Bateese say,
'Stuff heem wit' much so that he die queek!'"</p>

<p>"You want to see me dead. Is that it, Bateese?"</p>

<p>"OUI. You mak' wan ver' good dead man, m'sieu!" Bateese was no longer
grinning. He stood back and pointed at the food. "You eat&mdash; queek.
An' when you have finish' I tell you somet'ing!"</p>

<p>Now that he saw the luscious bit of whitefish before him, Carrigan was
possessed of the hungering emptiness of three days and nights. As he ate,
he observed that Bateese was performing curious duties. He straightened a
couple of rugs, ran fresh water into the flower vases, picked up half a
dozen scattered magazines, and then, to David's increasing interest,
produced a dust-cloth from somewhere and began to dust. David finished
his fish, the one slice of bread, and his cup of tea. He felt
tremendously good. The hot tea was like a trickle of new life through
every vein in his body, and he had the desire to get up and try out his
legs. Suddenly Bateese discovered that his patient was laughing at
him.</p>

<p>"QUE DIABLE!" he demanded, coming up ferociously with the cloth in his
great hand. "You see somet'ing ver' fonny, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing funny, Bateese," grinned Carrigan. "I was just thinking
what a handsome chambermaid you make. You are so gentle, so nice to look
at, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"DIABLE!" exploded Bateese, dropping his dust cloth and bringing his
huge hands down upon the table with a smash that almost wrecked the
dishes. "You have eat, an' now you lissen. You have never hear' before of
Concombre Bateese. An' zat ees me. See! Wit' these two hands I have
choke' ze polar bear to deat'. I am strongest man w'at ees in all nort'
countree. I pack four hundre' pound ovair portage. I crack ze caribou
bones wit' my teeth, lak a dog. I run sixt' or hundre' miles wit'out stop
for rest. I pull down trees w'at oder man cut wit' axe. I am not 'fraid
of not'ing. You lissen? You hear w'at I say?"</p>

<p>"I hear you."</p>

<p>"BIEN! Then I tell you w'at Concombre Bateese ees goin' do wit' you,
M'sieu Sergent de Police! MA BELLE Jeanne she mak' wan gran' meestake.
She too much leetle bird heart, too much pity for want you to die.
Bateese say, 'Keel him, so no wan know w'at happen t'ree day ago behin'
ze rock.' But MA BELLE Jeanne, she say, 'No, Bateese, he ees meestake for
oder man, an' we mus' let heem live.' An' then she tell me to come an'
bring you feesh, an' tell you w'at is goin' happen if you try go away
from thees bateau. You COMPREN'? If you try run away, Bateese ees goin'
keel you! See&mdash; wit' thees han's I br'ak your neck an' t'row you in
river. MA BELLE Jeanne say do zat, an' she tell oder mans-twent', thirt',
almos' hundre' GARCONS&mdash;to keel you if you try run away. She tell me
bring zat word to you wit' ze feesh. You listen hard w'at I say?"</p>

<p>If ever a worker of iniquity lived on earth, Carrigan might have
judged Bateese as that man in these moments. The half-breed had worked
himself up to a ferocious pitch. His eyes rolled. His wide mouth snarled
in the virulence of its speech. His thick neck grew corded, and his huge
hands clenched menacingly upon the table. Yet David had no fear. He
wanted to laugh, but he knew laughter would be the deadliest of insults
to Bateese just now. He remembered that the half-breed, fierce as a
pirate, had a touch as gentle as a woman's. This man, who could choke an
ox with his monstrous hands, had a moment before petted a cat,
straightened out rugs, watered the woman's flowers, and had dusted. He
was harmless&mdash;now. And yet in the same breath David sensed the fact
that a single word from St. Pierre's wife would be sufficient to fire his
brute strength into a blazing volcano of action. Such a henchman was
priceless&mdash;under certain conditions! And he had brought a warning
straight from the woman.</p>

<p>"I think I understand what you mean, Bateese," he said. "She says that
I am to make no effort to leave this bateau&mdash;that I am to be killed
if I try to escape? Are you sure she said that?"</p>

<p>"PAR LES MILLE CORNES DU DIABLE, you t'ink Bateese lie, m'sieu?
Concombre Bateese, who choke ze w'ite bear wit' hees two ban', who pull
down ze tree&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't think you lie. But I am wondering why she didn't tell
me that when she was here."</p>

<p>"Becaus' she have too much leetle bird heart, zat ees w'y. She say:
'Bateese, you tell heem he mus' wait for St. Pierre. An' you tell heem
good an' hard, lak you choke ze w'ite bear an' lak you pull down ze tree,
so he mak' no meestake an' try get away.' An' she tell zat before all ze
BATELIERS&mdash;all ze St. Pierre mans gathered 'bout a beeg
fire&mdash;an' they shout up lak wan gargon that they watch an' keel you
if you try get away."</p>

<p>Carrigan reached out a hand. "Let's shake, Bateese. I'll give you my
word that I won't try to escape&mdash;not until you and I have a good
stand-up fight with the earth under our feet, and I've whipped you. Is it
a go?"</p>

<p>Bateese stared for a moment, and then his face broke into a wide grin.
"You lak ze fight, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I love a scrap with a good man like you."</p>

<p>One of Bateese's huge hands crawled slowly over the table and engulfed
David's. Joy shone on his face.</p>

<p>"An' you promise give me zat fight, w'en you are strong?"</p>

<p>"If I don't, I'll let you tie a stone around my neck and drop me into
the river."</p>

<p>"You are brave GARCON," cried the delighted Bateese. "Up an' down ze
rivers ees no man w'at can whip Concombre Bateese!" Suddenly his face
grew clouded. "But ze head, m'sieu?" he added anxiously.</p>

<p>"It will get well quickly if you will help me, Bateese. Right now I
want to get up. I want to stretch my legs. Was my head bad?"</p>

<p>"NON. Ze bullet scrape ze ha'r off&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;an' turn ze
brain seek. I t'ink you be good fighting man in week!"</p>

<p>"And you will help me up?"</p>

<p>Bateese was a changed man. Again David felt that mighty but gentle
strength of his arms as he helped him to his feet. He was a trifle
unsteady for a moment. Then, with the half-breed close at his side, ready
to catch him if his legs gave way, he walked to one of the windows and
looked out. Across the river, fully half a mile away, he saw the glow of
fires.</p>

<p>"Her camp?" he asked.</p>

<p>"OUI, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"We have moved from the tar-sands?"</p>

<p>"Yes, two days down ze river."</p>

<p>"Why are they not camping over here with us?"</p>

<p>Bateese gave a disgusted grunt. "Becaus' MA BELLE Jeanne have such
leetle bird heart, m'sieu. She say you mus' not have noise near, lak ze
talk an' laugh an' ZE CHANSONS. She say it disturb, an' zat it rnak you
worse wit' ze fever. She ees mak you lak de baby, Bateese say to her. But
she on'y laugh at zat an' snap her leetle w'ite finger. Wait St. Pierre
come! He brak yo'r head wit' hees two fists. I hope we have ze fight
before then, m'sieu!"</p>

<p>"We'll have it anyway, Bateese. Where is St. Pierre, and when shall we
see him?"</p>

<p>Bateese shrugged his shoulders. "Mebby week, mebby more. He long way
off."</p>

<p>"Is he an old man?"</p>

<p>Slowly Bateese turned David about until he was facing him. "You ask
not'ing more about St. Pierre," he warned. "No mans talk 'bout St.
Pierre. Only wan&mdash;MA BELLE Jeanne. You ask her, an' she tell you
shut up. W'en you don't shut up she call Bateese to brak your head."</p>

<p>"You're a&mdash;a sort of all-round head-breaker, as I understand it,"
grunted David, walking slowly back to his bed. "Will you bring me my pack
and clothes in the morning? I want to shave and dress."</p>

<p>Bateese was ahead of him, smoothing the pillows and straightening out
the rumpled bed-clothes. His huge hands were quick and capable as a
woman's, and David could not keep himself from chuckling at this feminine
ingeniousness of the powerful half-breed. Once in the crush of those
gorilla-like arms that were working over his bed now, he thought, and it
would be all over with the strongest man in "N" Division. Bateese heard
the chuckle and looked up.</p>

<p>"Somet'ing ver' funny once more, is eet&mdash;w'at?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, Bateese&mdash;what will happen to me if you get me in
those arms when we fight? But it isn't going to happen. I fight with my
fists, and I'm going to batter you up so badly that nobody will recognize
you for a long time."</p>

<p>"You wait!" exploded Bateese, making a horrible grimace. "I choke you
lak w'ite bear, I t'row you ovair my should'r, I mash you lak leetle
strawberr', I&mdash;" He paused in his task to advance with a formidable
gesture.</p>

<p>"Not now," warned Carrigan. "I'm still a bit groggy, Bateese." He
pointed down at the bed. "I'm driving HER from that," he said. "I don't
like it. Is she sleepin' over there&mdash;in the camp?"</p>

<p>"Mebby&mdash;an' mebby not, m'sieu," growled Bateese. "You mak' guess,
eh?"</p>

<p>He began extinguishing the lights, until only the one nearest the door
was left burning. He did not turn toward Carrigan or speak to him again.
When he Went out, David heard the click of a lock in the door. Bateese
had not exaggerated. It was the intention of St. Pierre's wife that he
should consider himself a prisoner&mdash;at least for tonight.</p>

<p>He had no desire to lie down again. There was an unsteadiness in his
legs, but outside of that the evil of his sickness no longer oppressed
him. The staff doctor at the Landing would probably have called him a
fool for not convalescing in the usual prescribed way, but Carrigan was
already beginning to feel the demand for action. In spite of what
physical effort he had made, his head did not hurt him, and his mind was
keenly alive. He returned to the window through which he could see the
fires on the western shore, and found no difficulty in opening it. A
strong screen netting kept him from thrusting out his head and shoulders.
Through it came the cool night breeze of the river. It seemed good to
fill his lungs with it again and smell the fresh aroma of the forest. It
was very dark, and the fires across the river were brighter because of
the deep gloom. There was no promise of the moon in the sky. He could not
see a star. From far in the west he caught the low intonation of
thunder.</p>

<p>Carrigan turned from the window to the end of the cabin in which the
piano stood. Here, too, was the second divan, and he saw the meaning now
of two close-tied curtains, one at each side of the cabin. Drawn together
on a taut wire stretched two inches under the ceiling, they shut off this
end of the bateau and turned at least a third of the cabin into the
privacy of the woman's bedroom. With growing uneasiness David saw the
evidences that this had been her sleeping apartment. At each side of the
piano was a small door, and he opened one of these just enough to
discover that it was a wardrobe closet. A third door opened on the shore
side of the bateau, but this was locked. Shut out from the view of the
lower end of the cabin by a Japanese screen were a small dresser and a
mirror. In the dim illumination that came from the distant lamp David
bent over the open sheet of music on the piano. It was Mascagni's AVE
MARIA.</p>

<p>His blood tingled. His brain was stirred by a new emotion, a growing
thing that made him uneasy and filled him with a strange restlessness. He
felt as though he had come suddenly to the edge of a great danger;
somewhere within him an intelligence seized upon it and understood. Yet
it was not physical enough for him to fight. It was a danger which crept
up and about him, something which he could not see or touch and yet which
made his heart beat faster and the blood come into his face. It drew him,
triumphed over him, dragged his hand forth until his fingers closed upon
a lacy, crumpled bit of a handkerchief that lay on the edge of the piano
keys. It was the woman's handkerchief, and like a thief he raised it
slowly. It smelled faintly of crushed violets; it was as if she were
bending over him in his sickness again, and it was her breath that came
to him. He was not thinking of her as St. Pierre's wife. And then sharply
he caught himself and placed the handkerchief back on the piano keys. He
tried to laugh at himself, but there was an emptiness where a moment
before there had been that thrill of which he was now ashamed.</p>

<p>He turned back to the window. The thunder had come nearer. It was
coming up fast out of the west, and with it a darkness that was like the
blackness of a pit. A dead stillness was preceding it now, and in that
stillness it seemed to Carrigan that he could hear the soapy, slitting
sound of the streaming flashes of electrical fire that blazoned the
advance of the storm. The camp- fires across the river were dying down.
One of them went out as he looked at it, and he stared into the darkness
as if trying to pierce distance and gloom to see what sort of a shelter
it was that St. Pierre's wife had over there. And there came over him in
these moments a desire that was almost cowardly. It was the desire to
escape, to leave behind him the memory of the rock and of St. Pierre's
wife, and to pursue once more his own great adventure, the quest of Black
Roger Audemard.</p>

<p>He heard the rain coming. At first the sound of it was like the
pattering of ten million tiny feet in dry leaves; then, suddenly, it was
like the roar of an avalanche. It was an inundation, and with it came
crash after crash of thunder, and the black skies were illumined by an
almost uninterrupted glare of lightning. It had been a long time since
Carrigan had felt the shock of such a storm. He closed the window to keep
the rain out, and after that stood with his face flattened against the
glass, staring over the river. The camp-fires were all gone now, blotted
out like so many candles snuffed between thumb and forefinger, and he
shuddered. No canvas ever made would keep that deluge out. And now there
was growing up a wind with it. The tents on the other side would be
beaten down like pegged sheets of paper, ripped up and torn to pieces. He
imagined St. Pierre's wife in that tumult and distress &mdash;the breath
blown out of her, half drowned, blinded by deluge and lightning, broken
and beaten because of him. Thought of her companions did not ease his
mind. Human hands were entirely inadequate to cope with a storm like this
that was rocking the earth about him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he went to the door, determined that if Bateese was outside
he would get some satisfaction out of him or challenge him to a fight
right there. He beat against it, first with one fist and then with both.
He shouted. There was no response. Then he exerted his strength and his
weight against the door. It was solid.</p>

<p>He was half turned when his eyes discovered, in a corner where the
lamplight struck dimly, his pack and clothes. In thirty seconds he had
his pipe and tobacco. After that for half an hour he paced up and down
the cabin, while the storm crashed and thundered sif bent upon destroying
all life off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Comforted by the company of his pipe, Carrigan did not beat at the
door again. He waited, and at the end of another half-hour the storm had
softened down into a steady patter of rain. The thunder had traveled
east, and the lightning had gone with it. David opened the window again.
The air that came in was rain-sweet, soft, and warm. He puffed out a
cloud of smoke and smiled. His pipe always brought his good humor to the
surface, even in the worst places. St. Pierre's wife had certainly had a
good soaking. And in a way the whole thing was a bit funny. He was
thinking now of a poor little golden-plumaged partridge, soaked to the
skin, with its tail-feathers dragging pathetically. Grinning, he told
himself that it was an insult to think of her and a half-drowned
partridge in the same breath. But the simile still remained, and he
chuckled. Probably she was wringing out her clothes now, and the men were
cursing under their breath while trying to light a fire. He watched for
the fire. It failed to appear. Probably she was hating him for bringing
all this discomfort and humiliation upon her. It was not impossible that
tomorrow she would give Bateese permission to brain him. And St. Pierre?
What would this man, her husband, think and do if he knew that his wife
had given up her bedroom to this stranger? What complications might arise
IF HE KNEW!</p>

<p>It was late&mdash;past midnight&mdash;when Carrigan went to bed. Even
then he did not sleep for a long time. The patter of the rain grew less
and less on the roof of the bateau, and as the sound of it droned itself
off into nothingness, slumber came. David was conscious of the moment
when the rain ceased entirely. Then he slept. At least he must have been
very close to sleep, or had been asleep and was returning for a moment
close to consciousness, when he heard a voice. It came several times
before he was roused enough to realize that it was a voice. And then,
suddenly, piercing his slowly wakening brain almost with the shock of one
of the thunder crashes, it came to him so distinctly that he found
himself sitting up straight, his hands clenched, eyes staring in the
darkness, waiting for it to come again.</p>

<p>Somewhere very near him, in his room, within the reach of his hands, a
strange and indescribable voice had cried out in the darkness the words
which twice before had beat themselves mysteriously into David Carrigan's
brain&mdash;"HAS ANY ONE SEEN BLACK ROGER AUDEMARD? HAS ANY ONE SEEN
BLACK ROGER AUDEMARD?"</p>

<p>And David, holding his breath, listened for the sound of another
breath which he knew was in that room.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_10">IX</a></h3>

<p>For perhaps a minute Carrigan made no sound that could have been heard
three feet away from him. It was not fear that held him quiet. It was
something which he could not explain afterward, the sensation, perhaps,
of one who feels himself confronted for a moment by a presence more
potent than that of flesh and blood. BLACK ROGER AUDEMARD! Three times,
twice in his sickness, some one had cried out that name in his ears since
the hour when St. Pierre's wife had ambushed him on the white carpet of
sand. And the voice was now in his room!</p>

<p>Was it Bateese, inspired by some sort of malformed humor? Carrigan
listened. Another minute passed. He reached out a hand and groped about
him, very careful not to make a sound, urged by the feeling that some one
was almost within reach of him. He flung back his blanket and stood out
in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>Still he heard no movement, no soft footfalls of retreat or advance.
He lighted a match and held it high above his head. In its yellow
illumination he could see nothing alive. He lighted a lamp. The cabin was
empty. He drew a deep breath and went to the window. It was still open.
The voice had undoubtedly come to him through that window, and he fancied
he could see where the screen netting was crushed a bit inward, as though
a face had pressed heavily against it. Outside the night was beautifully
calm. The sky, washed by storm, was bright with stars. But there was not
a ripple of movement that he could hear.</p>

<p>After that he looked at his watch. He must have been sleeping for some
time when the voice roused him, for it was nearly three o'clock. In spite
of the stars, dawn was close at hand. When he looked out of the window
again they were paler and more distant. He had no intention of going back
to bed. He was restless and felt himself surrendering more and more to
the grip of presentiment.</p>

<p>It was still early, not later than six o'clock, when Bateese came in
with his breakfast. He was surprised, as he had heard no movement or
sound of voices to give evidence of life anywhere near the bateau.
Instantly he made up his mind that it was not Bateese who had uttered the
mysterious words of a few hours ago, for the half-breed had evidently
experienced a most uncomfortable night. He was like a rat recently pulled
out of water. His clothes hung upon him sodden and heavy, his head
kerchief dripped, and his lank hair was wet. He slammed the breakfast
things down on the table and went out again without so much as nodding at
his prisoner.</p>

<p>Again a sense of discomfort and shame swept over David, as he sat down
to breakfast. Here he was comfortably, even luxuriously, housed, while
out there somewhere St. Pierre's lovely wife was drenched and even more
miserable than Bateese. And the breakfast amazed him. It was not so much
the caribou tenderloin, rich in its own red juice, or the potato, or the
pot of coffee that was filling the cabin with its aroma, that roused his
wonder, but the hot, brown muffins that accompanied the other things.
Muffins! And after a deluge that had drowned every square inch of the
earth! How had Bateese turned the trick?</p>

<p>Bateese did not return immediately for the dishes, and for half an
hour after he had finished breakfast Carrigan smoked his pipe and watched
the blue haze of fires on the far side of the river. The world was a
blaze of sunlit glory. His imagination carried him across the river.
Somewhere over there, in an open spot where the sun was blazing, Jeanne
Marie-Anne was probably drying herself after the night of storm. There
was but little doubt in his mind that she was already heaping the
ignominy of blame upon him. That was the woman of it.</p>

<p>A knock at his door drew him about. It was a light, quick TAP, TAP,
TAP&mdash;not like the fist of either Bateese or Nepapinas. In another
moment the door swung open, and in the flood of sunlight that poured into
the cabin stood St. Pierre's wife!</p>

<p>It was not her presence, but the beauty of her, that held him
spellbound. It was a sort of shock after the vivid imaginings of his mind
in which he had seen her beaten and tortured by storm. Her hair, glowing
in the sun and piled up in shining coils on the crown of her head, was
not wet. She was not the rain-beaten little partridge that had passed in
tragic bedragglement through his mind. Storm had not touched her. Her
cheeks were soft with the warm flush of long hours of sleep. When she
came in, her lips greeting him with a little smile, all that he had built
up for himself in the hours of the night crumbled away in dust. Again he
forgot for a moment that she was St. Pierre's wife. She was woman, and as
he looked upon her now, the most adorable woman in all the world.</p>

<p>"You are better this morning," she said. Real pleasure shone in her
eyes. She had left the door open, so that the sun filled the room. "I
think the storm helped you. Wasn't it splendid?"</p>

<p>David swallowed hard. "Quite splendid," he managed to say. "Have you
seen Bateese this morning?"</p>

<p>A little note of laughter came into her throat. "Yes. I don't think he
liked it. He doesn't understand why I love storms. Did you sleep well,
M'sieu Carrigan?"</p>

<p>"An hour or two, I think. I was worrying about you. I didn't like the
thought that I had turned you out into the storm. But it doesn't seem to
have touched you."</p>

<p>"No. I was there&mdash;quite comfortable." She nodded to the forward
bulkhead of the cabin, beyond the wardrobe closets and the piano. "There
is a little dining-room and kitchenette ahead," she explained. "Didn't
Bateese tell you that?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't. I asked him where you were, and I think he told me to
shut up."</p>

<p>"Bateese is very odd," said St. Pierre's wife. "He is exceedingly
jealous of me, M'sieu David. Even when I was a baby and he carried me
about in his arms, he was just that way. Bateese, you know, is older than
he appears. He is fifty-one."</p>

<p>She was moving about, quite as if his presence was in no way going to
disturb her usual duties of the day. She rearranged the damask curtains
which he had crumpled with his hands, placed two or three chairs in their
usual places, and moved from this to that with the air of a housewife who
is in the habit of brushing up a bit in the morning.</p>

<p>She seemed not at all embarrassed because he was her prisoner, nor
uncomfortably restrained because of the message she had sent to him by
Bateese. She was warmly and gloriously human. In her apparent unconcern
at his presence he found himself sweating inwardly. A bit nervously he
struck a match to light his pipe, then extinguished it.</p>

<p>She noticed what he had done. "You may smoke," she said, with that
little note in her throat which he loved to hear, like the faintest
melody of laughter that did not quite reach her lips. "St. Pierre smokes
a great deal, and I like it."</p>

<p>She opened a drawer in the dressing-table and came to him with a box
half filled with cigars.</p>

<p>"St. Pierre prefers these&mdash;on occasions," she said, "Do you?"</p>

<p>His fingers seemed all thumbs as he took a cigar from the proffered
box. He cursed himself because his tongue felt thick. Perhaps it was his
silence, betraying something of his mental clumsiness, that brought a
faint flush of color into her cheeks. He noted that; and also that the
top of her shining head came just about to his chin, and that her mouth
and throat, looking down on them, were bewitchingly soft and sweet.</p>

<p>And what she said, when her eyes opened wide and beautiful on him
again, was like a knife cutting suddenly into the heart of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"In the evening I love to sit at St. Pierre's feet and watch him
smoke," she said. "I am glad it doesn't annoy you, because&mdash;I like
to smoke," he replied lamely.</p>

<p>She placed the box on the little reading table and looked at his
breakfast things. "You like muffins, too. I was up early this morning,
making them for you!"</p>

<p>"You made them?" he demanded, as if her words were a most amazing
revelation to him.</p>

<p>"Surely, M'sieu David. I make them every morning for St. Pierre. He is
very fond of them. He says the third nicest thing about me is my
muffins!"</p>

<p>"And the other two?" asked David.</p>

<p>"Are St. Pierre's little secrets, m'sieu," she laughed softly, the
color deepening in her cheeks. "It wouldn't be fair to tell you, would
it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it wouldn't," he said slowly. "But there are one or two other
things, Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Boulain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may call me Jeanne, or Marie-Anne, if you care to," she
interrupted him. "It will be quite all right."</p>

<p>She was picking up the breakfast dishes, not at all perturbed by the
fact that she was offering him a privilege which had the effect of
quickening his pulse for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I don't mind telling you it is going to be
difficult for me to do that&mdash;because&mdash;well, this is a most
unusual situation, isn't it? In spite of all your kindness, including
what was probably your good-intentioned endeavor to put an end to my
earthly miseries behind the rock, I believe it is necessary for you to
give me some kind of explanation. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't Bateese explain to you last night?" she asked, facing him.</p>

<p>"He brought a message from you to the effect that I was a prisoner,
that I must make no attempt to escape, and that if I did try to escape,
you had given your men instructions to kill me."</p>

<p>She nodded, quite seriously. "That is right, M'sieu David."</p>

<p>His face flamed. "Then I am a prisoner? You threaten me with
death?"</p>

<p>"I shall treat you very nicely if you make no attempt to escape,
M'sieu David. Isn't that fair?"</p>

<p>"Fair!" he cried, choking back an explosion that would have vented
itself on a man. "Don't you realize what has happened? Don't you know
that according to every law of God and man I should arrest you and give
you over to the Law? Is it possible that you don't comprehend my own
duty? What I must do?"</p>

<p>If he had noticed, he would have seen that there was no longer the
flush of color in her cheeks. But her eyes, looking straight at him, were
tranquil and unexcited. She nodded.</p>

<p>"That is why you must remain a prisoner, M'sieu David, It is because I
do realize, I shall not tell you why that happened behind the rock, and
if you ask me, I shall refuse to talk to you. If I let you go now, you
would probably have me arrested and put in jail. So I must keep you until
St. Pierre comes. I don't know what to do&mdash;except to keep you, and
not let you escape until then. What would you do?"</p>

<p>The question was so honest, so like a question that might have been
asked by a puzzled child, that his argument for the Law was struck dead.
He stared into the pale face, the beautiful, waiting eyes, saw the
pathetic intertwining of her slim fingers, and suddenly he was grinning
in that big, honest way which made people love Dave Carrigan.</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;doing&mdash;absolutely&mdash;right," he said.</p>

<p>A swift change came in her face. Her cheeks flushed. Her eyes filled
with a sudden glow that made the little violet-freckles in them dance
like tiny flecks of gold.</p>

<p>"From your point of view you are right," he repeated, "and I shall
make no attempt to escape until I have talked with St. Pierre. But I
can't quite see&mdash;just now&mdash;how he is going to help the
situation."</p>

<p>"He will," she assured him confidently.</p>

<p>"You seem to have an unlimited faith in St. Pierre," he replied a
little grimly.</p>

<p>"Yes, M'sieu David. He is the most wonderful man in the world. And he
will know what to do."</p>

<p>David shrugged his shoulders. "Perhaps, in some nice, quiet place, he
will follow the advice Bateese gave you&mdash;tie a stone round my neck
and sink me to the bottom of the river."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I don't think he will do that I should object to
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you would!"</p>

<p>"Yes. St. Pierre is big and strong, afraid of nothing in the world,
but he will do anything for me. I don't think he would kill you if I
asked him not to." She turned to resume her task of cleaning up the
breakfast things.</p>

<p>With a sudden movement David swung one of the' big chairs close to
her. "Please sit down," he commanded. "I can talk to you better that way.
As an officer of the law it is my duty to ask you a few questions. It
rests in your power to answer all of them or none of them. I have given
you my word not to act until I have seen St. Pierre, and I shall keep
that promise. But when we do meet I shall act largely on the strength of
what you tell me during the next tea minutes. Please sit down!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_11">X</a></h3>

<p>In that big, deep chair which must have been St. Pierre's own,
Marie-Anne sat facing Carrigan. Between its great arms her slim little
figure seemed diminutive and out of place. Her brown eyes were level and
clear, waiting. They were not warm or nervous, but so coolly and calmly
beautiful that they disturbed Carrigan. She raised her hands, her slim
fingers crumpling for a moment in the soft, thick coils of her hair. That
little movement, the unconscious feminism of it, the way she folded her
hands in her lap afterward, disturbed Carrigan even more. What a glory on
earth it must be to possess a woman like that! The thought made him
uneasy. And she sat waiting, a vivid, softly-breathing question- mark
against the warm coloring of the upholstered chair.</p>

<p>"When you shot me," he began, "I saw you, first, standing over me. I
thought you had come to finish me. It was then that I saw something in
your face&mdash;horror, amazement, as though you had done something you
did not know you were doing. You see, I want to be charitable. I want to
understand. I want to excuse you if I can. Won't you tell me why you shot
me, and why that change came over you when you saw me lying there?"</p>

<p>"No, M'sieu David, I shall not tell." She was not antagonistic or
defiant. Her voice was not raised, nor did it betray an unusual emotion.
It was simply decisive, and the unflinching steadiness of her eyes and
the way in which she sat with her hands folded gave to it an unqualified
definiteness.</p>

<p>"You mean that I must make my own guess?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Or get it out of St. Pierre?"</p>

<p>"If St. Pierre wishes to tell you, yes."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" He leaned a little toward her. "After that you dragged
me up into the shade, dressed my wound and made me comfortable. In a hazy
sort of way I knew what was going on. And a curious thing happened. At
times&mdash;" he leaned still a little nearer to her&mdash;"at
times&mdash;there seemed to be two of you!"</p>

<p>He was not looking at her hands, or he would have seen her fingers
slowly tighten in her lap.</p>

<p>"You were badly hurt," she said. "It is not strange that you should
have imagined things, M'sieu David."</p>

<p>"And I seemed to hear two voices," he went on.</p>

<p>She made no answer, but continued to look at him steadily.</p>

<p>"And the other had hair that was like copper and gold fire in the sun.
I would see your face and then hers, again and again&mdash;and&mdash;
since then&mdash;I have thought I was a heavy load for your hands to drag
up through that sand to the shade alone."</p>

<p>She held up her two hands, looking at them. "They are strong," she
said.</p>

<p>"They are small," he insisted, "and I doubt if they could drag me
across this floor."</p>

<p>For the first time the quiet of her eyes gave way to a warm fire. "It
was hard work," she said, and the note in her voice gave him warning that
he was approaching the dead-line again. "Bateese says I was a fool for
doing it. And if you saw two of me, or three or four, it doesn't matter.
Are you through questioning me, M'sieu David? If so, I have a number of
things to do."</p>

<p>He made a gesture of despair. "No, I am not through. But why ask you
questions if you won't answer them?"</p>

<p>"I simply can not. You must wait."</p>

<p>"For your husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for St. Pierre."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then said, "I raved about a number of
things when I was sick, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"You did, and especially about what you thought happened in the sand.
You called this&mdash;this other person&mdash;the Fire Goddess. You were
so near dying that of course it wasn't amusing. Otherwise it would have
been. You see MY hair is black, almost!" Again, in a quick movement, her
fingers were crumpling the lustrous coils on the crown of her head.</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'almost'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because St. Pierre has often told me that when I am in the sun there
are red fires in it. And the sun was very bright that afternoon in the
sand, M'sieu David."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he nodded. "And I'm rather glad, too. I like
to know that it was you who dragged me up into the shade after trying to
kill me. It proves you aren't quite so savage as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Carmin Fanchet," she interrupted him softly. "You talked about her in
your sickness, M'sieu David. It made me terribly afraid of you&mdash;so
much so that at times I almost wondered if Bateese wasn't right. It made
me understand what would happen to me if I should let you go. What
terrible thing did she do to you? What could she have done more terrible
than I have done?"</p>

<p>"Is that why you have given your men orders to kill me if I try to
escape?" he asked. "Because I talked about this woman, Carmin
Fanchet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is because of Carmin Fanchet that I am keeping you for St.
Pierre," she acknowledged. "If you had no mercy for her, you could have
none for me. What terrible thing did she do to you, M'sieu?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;to me," he said, feeling that she was putting him where
the earth was unsteady under his feet again. "But her brother was a
criminal of the worst sort. And I was convinced then, and am convinced
now, that his sister was a partner in his crimes. She was very beautiful.
And that, I think, was what saved her."</p>

<p>He was fingering his unlighted cigar as he spoke. When he looked up,
he was surprised at the swift change that had come into the face of St.
Pierre's wife. Her cheeks were flaming, and there were burning fires
screened behind the long lashes of her eyes. But her voice was unchanged.
It was without a quiver that betrayed the emotion which had sent the hot
flush into her face.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you judged her without absolute knowledge of fact? You
judged her&mdash;as you hinted in your fever&mdash;because she fought so
desperately to save a brother who had gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"I believe she was bad."</p>

<p>The long lashes fell lower, like fringes of velvet closing over the
fires in her eyes. "But you didn't know!"</p>

<p>"Not absolutely," he conceded. "But investigations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Might have shown her to be one of the most wonderful women that ever
lived, M'sieu David. It is not hard to fight for a good brother&mdash;but
if he is bad, it may take an angel to do it!"</p>

<p>He stared, thoughts tangling themselves in his head. A slow shame
crept over him. She had cornered him. She had convicted him of unfairness
to the one creature on earth his strength and his manhood were bound to
protect&mdash;a woman. She had convicted him of judging without fact. And
in his head a voice seemed to cry out to him, "What did Carmin Fanchet
ever do to you?"</p>

<p>He rose suddenly to his feet and stood at the back of his chair, his
hands gripping the top of it. "Maybe you are right," he said. "Maybe I
was wrong. I remember now that when I got Fanchet I manacled him, and she
sat beside him all through that first night. I didn't intend to sleep,
but I was tired&mdash;and did. I must have slept for an hour, and SHE
roused me&mdash;trying to get the key to the handcuffs. She had the
opportunity then&mdash;to kill me."</p>

<p>Triumph swept over the face that was looking up at him. "Yes, she
could have killed you&mdash;while you slept. But she didn't. WHY?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps she had the idea of getting the key and letting
her brother do the job. Two or three days later I am convinced she would
not have hesitated. I caught her twice trying to steal my gun. And a
third time, late at night, when we were within a day or two of Athabasca
Landing, she almost got me with a club. So I concede that she never did
anything very terrible to me. But I am sure that she tried, especially
toward the last."</p>

<p>"And because she failed, she hated you; and because she hated you,
something was warped inside you, and you made up your mind she should be
punished along with her brother. You didn't look at it from a woman's
viewpoint. A woman will fight, and kill, to save one she loves. She
tried, perhaps, and failed. The result was that her brother was killed by
the Law. Was not that enough? Was it fair or honest to destroy her simply
because you thought she might be a partner in her brother's crimes?"</p>

<p>"It is rather strange," he replied, a moment of indecision in his
voice. "McVane, the superintendent, asked me that same question. I
thought he was touched by her beauty. And I'm sorry&mdash;very
sorry&mdash; that I talked about her when I was sick. I don't want you to
think I am a bad sort&mdash;that way. I'm going to think about it. I'm
going over the whole thing again, from the time I manacled Fanchet, and
if I find that I was wrong&mdash;and I ever meet Carmin Fanchet
again&mdash; I shall not be ashamed to get down on my knees and ask her
pardon, Marie-Anne!"</p>

<p>For the first time he spoke the name which she had given him
permission to use. And she noticed it. He could not help seeing
that&mdash;a flashing instant in which the indefinable confession of it
was in her face, as though his use of it had surprised her, or pleased
her, or both. Then it was gone.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but rose from the big chair, and went to the
window, and stood with her back toward him, looking out over the river.
And then, suddenly, they heard a voice. It was the voice he had heard
twice in his sickness, the voice that had roused him from his sleep last
night, crying out in his room for Black Roger Audemard. It came to him
distinctly through the open door in a low and moaning monotone. He had
not taken his eyes from the slim figure of St. Pierre's wife, and he saw
a little tremor pass through her now.</p>

<p>"I heard that voice&mdash;again&mdash;last night," said David. "It was
in this cabin, asking for Black Roger Audemard."</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him, and he also turned so that he was
looking at the open door of the cabin.</p>

<p>The sun, pouring through in a golden flood, was all at once darkened,
and in the doorway&mdash;framed vividly against the day&mdash;was the
figure of a man. A tense breath came to Carrigan's lips. At first he felt
a shock, then an overwhelming sense of curiosity and of pity. The man was
terribly deformed. His back and massive shoulders were so twisted and
bent that he stood no higher than a twelve-year-old boy; yet standing
straight, he would have been six feet tall if an inch, and splendidly
proportioned. And in that same breath with which shock and pity came to
him, David knew that it was accident and not birth that had malformed the
great body that stood like a crouching animal in the open door. At first
he saw only the grotesqueness of it&mdash;the long arms that almost
touched the floor, the broken back, the twisted shoulders&mdash;and then,
with a deeper thrill, he saw nothing of these things but only the face
and the head of the man. There was something god- like about them,
fastened there between the crippled shoulders. It was not beauty, but
strength&mdash;the strength of rock, of carven granite, as if each
feature had been chiseled out of something imperishable and everlasting,
yet lacking strangely and mysteriously the warm illumination that comes
from a living soul. The man was not old, nor was he young. And he did not
seem to see Carrigan, who stood nearest to him. He was looking at St.
Pierre's wife.</p>

<p>The look which David saw in her face was infinitely tender. She was
smiling at the misshapen hulk in the door as she might have smiled at a
little child. And David, looking back at the wide, deep-set eyes of the
man, saw the slumbering fire of a dog-like worship in them. They shifted
slowly, taking in the cabin, questing, seeking, searching for something
which they could not find. The lips moved, and again he heard that weird
and mysterious monotone, as if the plaintive voice of a child were coming
out of the huge frame of the man, crying out as it had cried last night,
"HAS-ANY-ONE-SEEN-BLACK-ROGER-AUDEMARD?"</p>

<p>In another moment St. Pierre's wife was at the deformed giant's side.
She seemed tall beside him. She put her hands to his head and brushed
back the grizzled black hair, laughing softly into his upturned face, her
eyes shining and a strange glow in her cheeks. Carrigan, looking at them,
felt his heart stand still. WAS THIS MAN ST. PIERRE? The thought came
like a lightning flash&mdash;and went as quickly; it was impossible and
inconceivable. And yet there was something more than pity in the voice of
the woman who was speaking now.</p>

<p>"No, no, we have not seen him, Andre&mdash;we have not seen Black
Roger Audemard. If he comes, I will call you. I promise, Michiwan. I will
call you!"</p>

<p>She was stroking his bearded cheek, and then she put an arm about his
twisted shoulders, and slowly she turned so that in a moment or two they
were facing the sun&mdash;and it seemed to Carrigan that she was talking
and sobbing and laughing in the same breath, as that great, broken hulk
of a man moved out slowly from under the caress of her arm and went on
his way. For a space she looked after him. Then in a swift movement she
closed the door and faced Carrigan. She did not speak, but waited. Her
head was high. She was breathing quickly. The tenderness that a moment
before had filled her face was gone, and in her eyes was the blaze of
fighting fires as she waited for him to speak&mdash;to give voice to what
she knew was passing in his mind.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_12">XI</a></h3>

<p>For a space there was silence between Carrigan and St. Pierre's wife.
He knew what she was thinking as she stood with her back to the door,
waiting half defiantly, her cheeks still flushed, her eyes bright with
the anticipation of battle. She was ready to fight for the broken
creature on the other side of the door. She expected him to give no
quarter in his questioning of her, to corner her if he could, to demand
of her why the deformed giant had spoken the name of the man he was
after, Black Roger Audemard. The truth hammered in David's brain. It had
not been a delusion of his fevered mind after all; it was not a possible
deception of the half-breed's, as he had thought last night. Chance had
brought him face to face with the mystery of Black Roger. St. Pierre's
wife, waiting for him to speak, was in some way associated with that
mystery, and the cripple was asking for the man McVane had told him to
bring in dead or alive! Yet he did not question her. He turned to the
window and looked out from where Marie-Anne had stood a few moments
before.</p>

<p>The day was glorious. On the far shore he saw life where last night's
camp had been. Men were moving about close to the water, and a York boat
was putting out slowly into the stream. Close under the window moved a
canoe with a single occupant. It was Andre, the Broken Man. With powerful
strokes he was paddling across the river. His deformity was scarcely
noticeable in the canoe. His bare head and black beard shone in the sun,
and between his great shoulders his head looked more than ever to
Carrigan like the head of a carven god. And this man, like a mighty tree
stricken by lightning, his mind gone, was yet a thing that was more than
mere flesh and blood to Marie-Anne Boulain!</p>

<p>David turned toward her. Her attitude was changed. It was no longer
one of proud defiance. She had expected to defend herself from something,
and he had given her no occasion for defense. She did not try to hide the
fact from him, and he nodded toward the window.</p>

<p>"He is going away in a canoe. I am afraid you didn't want me to see
him, and I am sorry I happened to be here when he came."</p>

<p>"I made no effort to keep him away, M'sieu David. Perhaps I wanted you
to see him. And I thought, when you did&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>

<p>"You expected me to crucify you, if necessary, to learn the truth of
what he knows about Roger Audemard," he said. "And you were ready to
fight back. But I am not going to question you unless you give me
permission."</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said in a low voice. "I am beginning to have faith in
you, M'sieu David. You have promised not to try to escape, and I believe
you. Will you also promise not to ask me questions, which I can not
answer&mdash;until St. Pierre comes?"</p>

<p>"I will try."</p>

<p>She came up to him slowly and stood facing him, so near that she could
have reached out and put her hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"St. Pierre has told me a great deal about the Scarlet Police," she
said, looking at him quietly and steadily. "He says that the men who wear
the red jackets never play low tricks, and that they come after a man
squarely and openly. He says they are men, and many times he has told me
wonderful stories of the things they have done. He calls it 'playing the
game.' And I'm going to ask you, M'sieu David, will you play square with
me? If I give you the freedom of the bateau, of the boats, even of the
shore, will you wait for St. Pierre and play the rest of the game out
with him, man to man?"</p>

<p>Carrigan bowed his head slightly. "Yes, I will wait and finish the
game with St. Pierre."</p>

<p>He saw a quick throb come and go in her white throat, and with a
sudden, impulsive movement she held out her hand to him. For a moment he
held it close. Her little fingers tightened about his own, and the warm
thrill of them set his blood leaping with the thing he was fighting down.
She was so near that he could feel the throb of her body. For an instant
she bowed her head, and the sweet perfume of her hair was in his
nostrils, the lustrous beauty of it close under his lips.</p>

<p>Gently she withdrew her hand and stood back from him. To Carrigan she
was like a young girl now. It was the loveliness of girlhood he saw in
the flush of her face and in the gladness that was flaming unashamed in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not frightened any more," she exclaimed, her voice trembling a
bit. "When St. Pierre comes, I shall tell him everything. And then you
may ask the questions, and he will answer. And he will not cheat! He will
play square. You will love St. Pierre, and you will forgive me for what
happened behind the rock!"</p>

<p>She made a little gesture toward the door. "Everything is free to you
out there now," she added. "I shall tell Bateese and the others. When we
are tied up, you may go ashore. And we will forget all that has happened,
M'sieu David. We will forget until St. Pierre comes."</p>

<p>"St. Pierre!" he groaned. "If there were no St. Pierre!"</p>

<p>"I should be lost," she broke in quickly. "I should want to die!"</p>

<p>Through the open window came the sound of a voice. It was the weird
monotone of Andre, the Broken Man. Marie-Anne went to the window. And
David, following her, looked over her head, again so near that his lips
almost touched her hair. Andre had come back. He was watching two York
boats that were heading for the bateau.</p>

<p>"You heard him asking for Black Roger Audemard," she said. "It is
strange. I know how it must have shocked you when he stood like that in
the door. His mind, like his body, is a wreck, M'sieu David. Years ago,
after a great storm, St. Pierre found him in the forest. A tree had
fallen on him. St. Pierre carried him in on his shoulders. He lived, but
he has always been like that. St. Pierre loves him, and poor Andre
worships St. Pierre and follows him about like a dog. His brain is gone.
He does not know what his name is, and we call him Andre. And always, day
and night, he is asking that same question, 'Has any one seen Black Roger
Audemard?' Sometime&mdash;if you will, M'sieu David&mdash;I should like
to have you tell me what it is so terrible that you know about Roger
Audemard."</p>

<p>The York boats were half-way across the river, and from them came a
sudden burst of wild song. David could make out six men in each boat,
their oars flashing in the morning sun to the rhythm of their chant.
Marie-Anne looked up at him suddenly, and in her face and eyes he saw
what the starry gloom of evening had half hidden from him in those
thrilling moments when they shot through the rapids of the Holy Ghost.
She was girl now. He did not think of her as woman. He did not think of
her as St. Pierre's wife. In that upward glance of her eyes was something
that thrilled him to the depth of his soul. She seemed, for a moment, to
have dropped a curtain from between herself and him.</p>

<p>Her red lips trembled, she smiled at him, and then she faced the river
again, and he leaned a little forward, so that a breath of wind floated a
shimmering tress of her hair against his cheek. An irresistible impulse
seized upon him. He leaned still nearer to her, holding his breath, until
his lips softly touched one of the velvety coils of her hair. And then he
stepped back. Shame swept over him. His heart rose and choked him, and
his fists were clenched at his side. She had not noticed what he had
done, and she seemed to him like a bird yearning to fly out through the
window, throbbing with the desire to answer the chanting song that came
over the water. And then she was smiling up again into his face hardened
with the struggle which he was making with himself.</p>

<p>"My people are happy," she cried. "Even in storm they laugh and sing.
Listen, m'sieu. They are singing La Derniere Domaine. That is our song.
It is what we call our home, away up there in the lost wilderness where
people never come&mdash;the Last Domain. Their wives and sweethearts and
families are up there, and they are happy in knowing that today we shall
travel a few miles nearer to them. They are not like your people in
Montreal and Ottawa and Quebec, M'sieu David. They are like children. And
yet they are glorious children!"</p>

<p>She ran to the wall and took down the banner of St. Pierre Boulain.
"St. Pierre is behind us," she explained. "He is coming down with a raft
of timber such as we can not get in our country, and we are waiting for
him. But each day we must float down with the stream a few miles nearer
the homes of my people. It makes them happier, even though it is but a
few miles. They are coming now for my bateau. We shall travel slowly, and
it will be wonderful on a day like this. It will do you good to come
outside, M'sieu David&mdash;with me. Would you care for that? Or would
you rather be alone?"</p>

<p>In her face there was no longer the old restraint. On her lips was the
witchery of a half-smile; in her eyes a glow that flamed the blood in his
veins. It was not a flash of coquetry. It was something deeper and warmer
than that, something real&mdash;a new Marie-Anne Boulain telling him
plainly that she wanted him to come. He did not know that his hands were
still clenched at his side. Perhaps she knew. But her eyes did not leave
his face, eyes that were repeating the invitation of her lips, openly
asking him not to refuse.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to come," he said.</p>

<p>The words fell out of him numbly. He scarcely heard them or knew what
he was saying, yet he was conscious of the unnatural note in his voice.
He did not know he was betraying himself beyond that, did not see the
deepening of the wild-rose flush in the cheeks of St. Pierre's wife. He
picked up his pipe from the table and moved to accompany her.</p>

<p>"You must wait a little while," she said, and her hand rested for an
instant upon his arm. Its touch was as light as the touch of his lips had
been against her shining hair, but he felt it in every nerve of his body.
"Nepapinas is making a special lotion for your hurt. I will send him in,
and then you may come."</p>

<p>The wild chant of the rivermen was near as she turned to the door.
From it she looked back at him swiftly.</p>

<p>"They are happy, M'sieu David," she repeated softly. "And I, too, am
happy. I am no longer afraid. And the world is beautiful again. Can you
guess why? It is because you have given me your promise, M'sieu David,
and because I believe you!"</p>

<p>And then she was gone.</p>

<p>For many minutes he did not move. The chanting of the rivermen, a
sudden wilder shout, the voices of men, and after that the grating of
something alongside the bateau came to him like sounds from another
world. Within himself there was a crash greater than that of physical
things. It was the truth breaking upon him, truth surging over him like
the waves of a sea, breaking down the barriers he had set up, inundating
him with a force that was mightier than his own will. A voice in his soul
was crying out the truth&mdash;that above all else in the world he wanted
to reach out his arms to this glorious creature who was the wife of St.
Pierre, this woman who had tried to kill him and was sorry. He knew that
it was not desire for beauty. It was the worship which St. Pierre himself
must have for this woman who was his wife. And the shock of it was like a
conflagration sweeping through him, leaving him dead and shriven, like
the crucified trees standing in the wake of a fire. A breath that was
almost a cry came from him, and his fists knotted until they were purple.
She was St. Pierre's wife! And he, David Carrigan, proud of his honor,
proud of the strength that made him man, had dared covet her in this hour
when her husband was gone! He stared at the closed door, beginning to cry
out against himself, and over him there swept slowly and terribly another
thing&mdash;the shame of his weakness, the hopelessness of the thing that
for a space had eaten into him and consumed him.</p>

<p>And as he stared, the door opened, and Nepapinas came in.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_13">XII</a></h3>

<p>During the next quarter of an hour David was as silent as the old
Indian doctor. He was conscious of no pain when Nepapinas took off his
bandage and bathed his head in the lotion he had brought. Before a fresh
bandage was put on, he looked at himself for a moment in the mirror. It
was the first time he had seen his wound, and he expected to find himself
marked with a disfiguring scar. To his surprise there was no sign of his
hurt except a slightly inflamed spot above his temple. He stared at
Nepapinas, and there was no need of the question that was in his
mind.</p>

<p>The old Indian understood, and his dried-up face cracked and crinkled
in a grin. "Bullet hit a piece of rock, an' rock, not bullet, hit um
head," he explained. "Make skull almost break&mdash;bend um in&mdash;but
Nepapinas straighten again with fingers, so-so." He shrugged his thin
shoulders with a cackling laugh of pride as he worked his claw-like
fingers to show how the operation had been done.</p>

<p>David shook hands with him in silence; then Nepapinas put on the fresh
bandage, and after that went out, chuckling again in his weird way, as
though he had played a great joke on the white man whom his wizardry had
snatched out of the jaws of death.</p>

<p>For some time there had been a subdued activity outside. The singing
of the boatmen had ceased, a low voice was giving commands, and looking
through the window, David saw that the bateau was slowly swinging away
from the shore. He turned from the window to the table and lighted the
cigar St. Pierre's wife had given him.</p>

<p>In spite of the mental struggle he had made during the presence of
Nepapinas, he had failed to get a grip on himself. For a time he had
ceased to be David Carrigan, the man-hunter. A few days ago his blood had
run to that almost savage thrill of the great game of one against one,
the game in which Law sat on one side of the board and Lawlessness on the
other, with the cards between. It was the great gamble. The cards meant
life or death; there was never a checkmate&mdash;one or the other had to
lose. Had some one told him then that soon he would meet the broken and
twisted hulk of a man who had known Black Roger Audemard, every nerve in
him would have thrilled in anticipation of that hour. He realized this as
he paced back and forth over the thick rugs of the bateau floor. And he
knew, even as he struggled to bring them back, that the old thrill and
the old desire were gone. It was impossible to lie to himself. St.
Pierre, in this moment, was of more importance to him than Roger
Audemard. And St. Pierre's wife, Marie-Anne&mdash;</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the crumpled handkerchief on the piano keys. Again he
was crushing it in the palm of his hand, and again the flood of
humiliation and shame swept over him. He dropped the handkerchief, and
the great law of his own life seemed to rise up in his face and taunt
him. He was clean. That had been his greatest pride. He hated the man who
was unclean. It was his instinct to kill the man who desecrated another
man's home. And here, in the sacredness of St. Pierre's paradise, he
found himself at last face to face with that greatest fight of all the
ages.</p>

<p>He faced the door. He threw back his shoulders until they snapped, and
he laughed, as if at the thing that had risen up to point its finger at
him. After all, it did not hurt a man to go through a bit of
fire&mdash;if he came out of it unburned. And deep in his heart he knew
it was not a sin to love, even as he loved, if he kept that love to
himself. What he had done when Marie-Anne stood at the window he could
not undo. St. Pierre would probably have killed him for touching her hair
with his lips, and he would not have blamed St. Pierre. But she had not
felt that stolen caress. No one knew&mdash;but himself. And he was
happier because of it. It was a sort of sacred thing, even though it
brought the heat of shame into his face.</p>

<p>He went to the door, opened it, and stood out in the sunshine. It was
good to feel the warmth of the sun in his face again and the sweet air of
the open day in his lungs. The bateau was free of the shore and drifting
steadily towards midstream. Bateese was at the great birchwood rudder
sweep, and to David's surprise he nodded in a friendly way, and his wide
mouth broke into a grin.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is coming soon, that fight of ours, little coq de bruyere!" he
chuckled gloatingly. "An' ze fight will be jus' lak that,
m'sieu&mdash;you ze little fool-hen's rooster, ze partridge, an' I,
Concombre Bateese, ze eagle!"</p>

<p>The anticipation in the half-breed's eyes reflected itself for an
instant in David's. He turned back into the cabin, bent over his pack,
and found among his clothes two pairs of boxing gloves. He fondled them
with the loving touch of a brother and comrade, and their velvety
smoothness was more soothing to his nerves than the cigar he was smoking.
His one passion above all others was boxing, and wherever he went, either
on pleasure or adventure, the gloves went with him. In many a cabin and
shack of the far hinterland he had taught white men and Indians how to
use them, so that he might have the pleasure of feeling the thrill of
them on his hands. And now here was Concombre Bateese inviting him on,
waiting for him to get well!</p>

<p>He went out and dangled the clumsy-looking mittens under the half-
breed's nose.</p>

<p>Bateese looked at them curiously. "Mitaines," he nodded. "Does ze
little partridge rooster keep his claws warm in those in ze winter? They
are clumsy, m'sieu. I can make a better mitten of caribou skin." Putting
on one of the gloves, David doubled up his fist. "Do you see that,
Concombre Bateese?" he asked. "Well, I will tell you this, that they are
not mittens to keep your hands warm. I am going to fight you in them when
our time comes. With these mittens I will fight you and your naked fists.
Why? Because I do not want to hurt you too badly, friend Bateese! I do
not want to break your face all to pieces, which I would surely do if I
did not put on these soft mittens. Then, when you have really learned to
fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bull neck of Concombre Bateese looked as if it were about to
burst. His eyes seemed ready to pop out of their sockets, and suddenly he
let out a roar. "What!&mdash;You dare talk lak that to Concombre Bateese,
w'at is great'st fightin' man on all T'ree River? You talk lak that to
me, Concombre Bateese, who will kill ze bear wit' hees ban's, who pull
down ze tree, who&mdash;who&mdash;"</p>

<p>The word-flood of his outraged dignity sprang to his lips; emotion
choked him, and then, looking suddenly over Carrigan's shoulder&mdash; he
stopped. Something in his look made David turn. Three paces behind him
stood Marie-Anne, and he knew that from the corner of the cabin she had
heard what had passed between them. She was biting her lips, and behind
the flash of her eyes he saw laughter.</p>

<p>"You must not quarrel, children," she said. "Bateese, you are steering
badly."</p>

<p>She reached out her hands, and without a word David gave her the
gloves. With her palm and fingers she caressed them softly, yet David saw
little lines of doubt come into her white forehead.</p>

<p>"They are pretty&mdash;and soft, M'sieu David. Surely they can not
hurt much! Some day when St. Pierre comes, will you teach me how to use
them?"</p>

<p>"Always it is 'When St. Pierre comes,'" he replied. "Shall we be
waiting long?"</p>

<p>"Two or three days, perhaps a little longer. Are you coming with me to
the proue, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>She did not wait for his answer, but went ahead of him, dangling the
two pairs of gloves at her side. David caught a last glimpse of the
half-breed's face as he followed Marie-Anne around the end of the cabin.
Bateese was making a frightful grimace and shaking his huge fist, but
scarcely were they out of sight on the narrow footway that ran between
the cabin and the outer timbers of the scow when a huge roar of laughter
followed them. Bateese had not done laughing when they reached the proue,
or bow-nest, a deck fully ten feet in length by eight in width, sheltered
above by an awning, and comfortably arranged with chairs, several rugs, a
small table, and, to David's amazement, a hammock. He had never seen
anything like this on the Three Rivers, nor had he ever heard of a scow
so large or so luxuriously appointed. Over his head, at the tip of a
flagstaff attached to the forward end of the cabin, floated the black and
white pennant of St. Pierre Boulain. And under this staff was a screened
door which undoubtedly opened into the kitchenette which Marie-Anne had
told him about. He made no effort to hide his surprise. But St. Pierre's
wife seemed not to notice it. The puckery little lines were still in her
forehead, and the laughter had faded out of her eyes. The tiny lines
deepened as there came another wild roar of laughter from Bateese in the
stern.</p>

<p>"Is it true that you have given your word to fight Bateese?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"It is true, Marie-Anne. And I feel that Bateese is looking ahead
joyously to the occasion."</p>

<p>"He is," she affirmed. "Last night he spread the news among all my
people. Those who left to join St. Pierre this morning have taken the
news with them, and there is a great deal of excitement and much betting.
I am afraid you have made a bad promise. No man has offered to fight
Bateese in three years&mdash;not even my great St. Pierre, who says that
Concombre is more than a match for him."</p>

<p>"And yet they must have a little doubt, as there is betting, and it
takes two to make a bet," chuckled David.</p>

<p>The lines went out of Marie-Anne's forehead, and a half-smile trembled
on her red lips. "Yes, there is betting. But those who are for you are
offering next autumn's muskrat skins and frozen fish against lynx and
fisher and marten. The odds are about thirty to one against you, M'sieu
David!"</p>

<p>The look of pity which was clearly in her eyes brought a rush of blood
to David's face. "If only I had something to wager!" he groaned.</p>

<p>"You must not fight. I shall forbid it!"</p>

<p>"Then Bateese and I will steal off into the forest and have it out by
ourselves."</p>

<p>"He will hurt you badly. He is terrible, like a great beast, when he
fights. He loves to fight and is always asking if there is not some one
who will stand up to him. I think he would desert even me for a good
fight. But you, M'sieu David&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I also love a fight," he admitted, unashamed.</p>

<p>St. Pierre's wife studied him thoughtfully for a moment. "With these?"
she asked then, holding up the gloves.</p>

<p>"Yes, with those. Bateese may use his fists, but I shall use those, so
that I shall not disfigure him permanently. His face is none too handsome
as it is."</p>

<p>For another flash her lips trembled on the edge of a smile. Then she
gave him the gloves, a bit troubled, and nodded to a chair with a deep,
cushioned seat and wide arms. "Please make yourself comfortable, M'sieu
David. I have something to do in the cabin and will return in a little
while."</p>

<p>He wondered if she had gone back to settle the matter with Bateese at
once, for it was clear that she did not regard with favor the promised
bout between himself and the half-breed. It was on the spur of a careless
moment that he had promised to fight Bateese, and with little thought
that it was likely to be carried out or that it would become a matter of
importance with all of St. Pierre's brigade. He was evidently in for it,
he told himself, and as a fighting man it looked as though Concombre
Bateese was at least the equal of his braggadocio. He was glad of that.
He grinned as he watched the bending backs of St. Pierre's men. So they
were betting thirty to one against him! Even St. Pierre might be induced
to bet&mdash;with HIM. And if he did&mdash;</p>

<p>The hot blood leaped for a moment in Carrigan's veins. The thrill went
to the tips of his fingers. He stared out over the river, unseeing, as
the possibilities of the thing that had come into his mind made him for a
moment oblivious of the world. He possessed one thing against which St.
Pierre and St. Pierre's wife would wager a half of all they owned in the
world! And if he should gamble that one thing, which had come to him like
an inspiration, and should whip Bateese&mdash;</p>

<p>He began to pace back and forth over the narrow deck, no longer
watching the rowers or the shore. The thought grew, and his mind was
consumed by it. Thus far, from the moment the first shot was fired at him
from the ambush, he had been playing with adventure in the dark. But fate
had at last dealt him a trump card. That something which he possessed was
more precious than furs or gold to St. Pierre, and St. Pierre would not
refuse the wager when it was offered. He would not dare refuse. More than
that, he would accept eagerly, strong in the faith that Bateese would
whip him as he had whipped all other fighters who had come up against him
along the Three Rivers. And when Marie-Anne knew what that wager was to
be, she, too, would pray for the gods of chance to be with Concombre
Bateese!</p>

<p>He did not hear the light footsteps behind him, and when he turned
suddenly in his pacing, he found himself facing Marie-Anne, who carried
in her hands the little basket he had seen on the cabin table. She seated
herself in the hammock and took from the basket a bit of lace work. For a
moment he watched her fingers flashing in and out with the needles.</p>

<p>Perhaps his thought went to her. He was almost frightened as he saw
her cheeks coloring under the long, dark lashes. He faced the rivermen
again, and while he gripped at his own weakness, he tried to count the
flashings of their oars. And behind him, the beautiful eyes of St.
Pierre's wife were looking at him with a strange glow in their
depths.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, speaking slowly and still looking toward the
flashing of the oars, "something tells me that unexpected things are
going to happen when St. Pierre returns. I am going to make a bet with
him that I can whip Bateese. He will not refuse. He will accept. And St.
Pierre will lose, because I shall whip Bateese. It is then that these
unexpected things will begin to happen. And I am wondering&mdash;after
they do happen&mdash;if you will care so very much?"</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. And then, "I don't want you to fight
Bateese," she said.</p>

<p>The needles were working swiftly when he turned toward her again, and
a second time the long lashes shadowed what a moment before he might have
seen in her eyes.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_14">XIII</a></h3>

<p>The morning passed like a dream to Carrigan. He permitted himself to
live and breathe it as one who finds himself for a space in the heart of
a golden mirage. He was sitting so near Marie-Anne that now and then the
faint perfume of her came to him like the delicate scent of a flower. It
was a breath of crushed violets, sweet as the air he was breathing,
violets gathered in the deep cool of the forest, a whisper of sweetness
about her, as if on her bosom she wore always the living flowers. He
fancied her gathering them last bloom-time, a year ago, alone, her feet
seeking out the damp mosses, her little fingers plucking the smiling and
laughing faces of the violet flowers to be treasured away in fragrant
sachets, as gentle as the wood-thrush's note, compared with the bottled
aromas fifteen hundred miles south. It seemed to be a physical part of
her, a thing born of the glow in her cheeks, a living exhalation of her
soft red lips&mdash;and yet only when he was near, very near, did the
life of it reach him.</p>

<p>She did not know he was thinking these things. There was nothing in
his voice, he thought, to betray him. He was sure she was unconscious of
the fight he was making. Her eyes smiled and laughed with him, she
counted her stitches, her fingers worked, and she talked to him as she
might have talked to a friend of St. Pierre's. She told him how St.
Pierre had made the barge, the largest that had ever been on the river,
and that he had built it entirely of dry cedar, so that it floated like a
feather wherever there was water enough to run a York boat. She told him
how St. Pierre had brought the piano down from Edmonton, and how he had
saved it from pitching in the river by carrying the full weight of it on
his shoulders when they met with an accident in running through a
dangerous rapids bringing it down. St. Pierre was a very strong man, she
said, a note of pride in her voice. And then she added,</p>

<p>"Sometimes, when he picks me up in his arms, I feel that he is going
to squeeze the life out of me!"</p>

<p>Her words were like a sharp thrust into his heart. For an instant they
painted a vision for him, a picture of that slim and adorable creature
crushed close in the great arms of St. Pierre, so close that she could
not breathe. In that mad moment of his hurt it was almost a living,
breathing reality for him there on the golden fore-deck of the scow. He
turned his face toward the far shore, where the wilderness seemed to
reach off into eternity. What a glory it was&mdash;the green seas of
spruce and cedar and balsam, the ridges of poplar and birch rising like
silvery spume above the darker billows, and afar off, mellowed in the
sun-mists, the guardian crests of Trout Mountains sentineling the country
beyond! Into that mystery-land on the farther side of the Wabiskaw
waterways Carrigan would have loved to set his foot four days ago. It was
that mystery of the unpeopled places that he most desired, their silence,
the comradeship of spaces untrod by the feet of man. And now, what a fool
he was! Through vast distances the forests he loved seemed to whisper it
to him, and ahead of him the river seemed to look back, nodding over its
shoulder, beckoning to him, telling him the word of the forests was true.
It streamed on lazily, half a mile wide, as if resting for the splashing
and roaring rush it would make among the rocks of the next rapids, and in
its indolence it sang the low and everlasting song of deep and slowly
passing water. In that song David heard the same whisper, that he was a
fool! And the lure of the wilderness shores crept in on him and gripped
him as of old. He looked at the rowers in the two York boats, and then
his eyes came back to the end of the barge and to St. Pierre's wife.</p>

<p>Her little toes were tapping the floor of the deck. She, too, was
looking out over the wilderness. And again it seemed to him that she was
like a bird that wanted to fly.</p>

<p>"I should like to go into those hills," she said, without looking at
him. "Away off yonder!"</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;I should like to go with you."</p>

<p>"You love all that, m'sieu?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame!"</p>

<p>"Why 'madame,' when I have given you permission to call me 'Marie-
Anne'?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Because you call me 'm'sieu'."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you have not given me permission&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I do now," he interrupted quickly.</p>

<p>"Merci! I have wondered why you did not return the courtesy," she
laughed softly. "I do not like the m'sieu. I shall call you 'David'!"</p>

<p>She rose out of the hammock suddenly and dropped her needles and lace
work into the little basket. "I have forgotten something. It is for you
to eat when it comes dinner-time, m'sieu&mdash;I mean David. So I must
turn fille de cuisine for a little while. That is what St. Pierre
sometimes calls me, because I love to play at cooking. I am going to bake
a pie!"</p>

<p>The dark-screened door of the kitchenette closed behind her, and
Carrigan walked out from under the awning, so that the sun beat down upon
him. There was no longer a doubt in his mind. He was more than fool. He
envied St. Pierre, and he coveted that which St. Pierre possessed. And
yet, before he would take what did not belong to him, he knew he would
put a pistol to his head and blow his life out. He was confident of
himself there. Yet he had fallen, and out of the mire into which he had
sunk he knew also that he must drag himself, and quickly, or be
everlastingly lowered in his own esteem. He stripped himself naked and
did not lie to that other and greater thing of life that was in him.</p>

<p>He was not only a fool, but a coward. Only a coward would have touched
the hair of St. Pierre's wife with his lips; only a coward would have let
live the thoughts that burned in his brain. She was St. Pierre's
wife&mdash;and he was anxious now for the quick homecoming of the chief
of the Boulains. After that everything would happen quickly. He thanked
God that the inspiration of the wager had come to him. After the fight,
after he had won, then once more would he be the old Dave Carrigan,
holding the trump hand in a thrilling game.</p>

<p>Loud voices from the York boats ahead and answering cries from Bateese
in the stern drew him to the open deck. The bateau was close to shore,
and the half-breed was working the long stern sweep as if the power of a
steam-engine was in his mighty arms. The York boats had shortened their
towline and were pulling at right angles within a few yards of a gravelly
beach. A few strokes more, and men who were bare to the knees jumped out
into shallow water and began tugging at the tow rope with their hands.
David looked at his watch. It was ten o'clock. Never in his life had time
passed so swiftly as that morning on the forward deck of the barge. And
now they were tying up, after a drop of six or eight miles down the
river, and he wondered how swiftly St. Pierre was overtaking them with
his raft.</p>

<p>He was filled with the desire to feel the soft crush of the earth
under his feet again, and not waiting for the long plank that Bateese was
already swinging from the scow to the shore, he made a leap that put him
on the sandy beach, St. Pierre's wife had given him this permission, and
he looked to see what effect his act had on the half-breed. The face of
Concombre Bateese was like sullen stone. Not a sound came from his thick
lips, but in his eyes was a deep and dangerous fire as he looked at
Carrigan. There was no need for words. In them were suspicion, warning,
the deadly threat of what would happen if he did not come back when it
was time to return. David nodded. He understood. Even though St. Pierre's
wife had faith in him, Bateese had not. He passed between the men, and to
a man their faces turned on him, and in their quiet and watchful eyes he
saw again that warning and suspicion, the unspoken threat of what would
happen if he forgot his promise to Marie-Anne Boulain. Never, in a single
outfit, had he seen such splendid men. They were not a mongrel assortment
of the lower country. Slim, tall, clean-cut, sinewy&mdash;they were stock
of the old voyageurs of a hundred years ago, and all of them were young.
The older men had gone to St. Pierre. The reason for this dawned upon
Carrigan. Not one of these twelve but could beat him in a race through
the forest; not one that could not outrun him and cut him off though he
had hours the start!</p>

<p>Passing beyond them, he paused and looked back at the bateau. On the
forward deck stood Marie-Anne, and she, too, was looking at him now. Even
at that distance he saw that her face was quiet and troubled with
anxiety. She did not smile when he lifted his hat to her, but gave only a
little nod. Then he turned and buried himself in the green balsams that
grew within fifty paces of the river. The old joy of life leaped into him
as his feet crushed in the soft moss of the shaded places where the sun
did not break through. He went on, passing through a vast and silent
cathedral of spruce and cedar so dense that the sky was hidden, and came
then to higher ground, where the evergreen was sprinkled with birch and
poplar. About him was an invisible choir of voices, the low twittering of
timid little gray-backs, the song of hidden&mdash; warblers, the scolding
of distant jays. Big-eyed moose-birds stared at him as he passed,
fluttering so close to his face that they almost touched his shoulders in
their foolish inquisitiveness. A porcupine crashed within a dozen feet of
his trail. And then he came to a beaten path, and other paths worn deep
in the cool, damp earth by the hoofs of moose and caribou. Half a mile
from the bateau he sat down on a rotting log and filled his pipe with
fresh tobacco, while he listened to catch the subdued voice of the life
in this land that he loved.</p>

<p>It was then that the curious feeling came over him that he was not
alone, that other eyes than those of beast and bird were watching him. It
was an impression that grew on him. He seemed to feel their stare,
seeking him out from the darkest coverts, waiting for him to shove on,
dogging him like a ghost. Within him the hound- like instincts of the
man-hunter rose swiftly to the suspicion of invisible presence.</p>

<p>He began to note the changes in the cries of certain birds. A hundred
yards on his right a jay, most talkative of all the forest things, was
screeching with a new note in its voice. On the other side of him, in a
dense pocket of poplar and spruce, a warbler suddenly brought its song to
a jerky end. He heard the excited Pe- wee&mdash;Pe-wee&mdash;Pe-wee of a
startled little gray-back giving warning of an unwelcome intruder near
its nest. And he rose to his feet, laughing softly as he thumbed down the
tobacco in his pipe. Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain might believe in him, but
Bateese and her wary henchmen had ways of their own of strengthening
their faith.</p>

<p>It was close to noon when he turned back, and he did not return by the
moose path. Deliberately he struck out a hundred yards on either side of
it, traveling where the moss grew thick and the earth was damp and soft.
And five times he found the moccasin- prints of men.</p>

<p>Bateese, with his sleeves up, was scrubbing the deck of the bateau
when David came over the plank.</p>

<p>"There are moose and caribou in there, but I fear I disturbed your
hunters," said Carrigan, grinning at the half-breed. "They are too clumsy
to hunt well, so clumsy that even the birds give them away. I am afraid
we shall go without fresh meat tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Concombre Bateese stared as if some one had stunned him with a blow,
and he spoke no word as David went on to the forward deck. Marie-Anne had
come out under the awning. She gave a little cry of relief and
pleasure.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come back, M'sieu David!"</p>

<p>"So am I, madame," he replied. "I think the woods are unhealthful to
travel in!"</p>

<p>Out of the earth he felt that a part of the old strength had returned
to him. Alone they sat at dinner, and Marie-Anne waited on him and called
him David again&mdash;and he found it easier now to call her Marie-Anne
and look into her eyes without fear that he was betraying himself. A part
of the afternoon he spent in her company, and it was not difficult for
him to tell her something of his adventuring in the north, and how, body
and soul, the northland had claimed him, and that he hoped to die in it
when his time came. Her eyes glowed at that. She told him of two years
she had spent in Montreal and Quebec, of her homesickness, her joy when
she returned to her forests. It seemed, for a time, that they had
forgotten St. Pierre. They did not speak of him. Twice they saw Andre,
the Broken Man, but the name of Roger Audemard was not spoken. And a
little at a time she told him of the hidden paradise of the Boulains away
up in the unmapped wildernesses of the Yellowknife beyond the Great Bear,
and of the great log chateau that was her home.</p>

<p>A part of the afternoon he spent on shore. He filled a moosehide bag
full of sand and suspended it from the limb of a tree, and for
three-quarters of an hour pommeled it with his fists, much to the
curiosity and amusement of St. Pierre's men, who could see nothing of
man-fighting in these antics. But the exercise assured David that he had
lost but little of his strength and that he would be in form to meet
Bateese when the time came. Toward evening Marie- Anne joined him, and
they walked for half an hour up and down the beach. It was Bateese who
got supper. And after that Carrigan sat with Marie-Anne on the foredeck
of the barge and smoked another of St. Pierre's cigars.</p>

<p>The camp of the rivermen was two hundred yards below the bateau,
screened between by a finger of hardwood, so that except when they broke
into a chorus of laughter or strengthened their throats with snatches of
song, there was no sound of their voices. But Bateese was in the stern,
and Nepapinas was forever flitting in and out among the shadows on the
shore, like a shadow himself, and Andre, the Broken Man, hovered near as
night came on. At last he sat down in the edge of the white sand of the
beach, and there he remained, a silent and lonely figure, as the twilight
deepened. Over the world hovered a sleepy quiet. Out of the forest came
the droning of the wood-crickets, the last twitterings of the day birds,
and the beginning of night sounds. A great shadow floated out over the
river close to the bateau, the first of the questing, blood- seeking owls
adventuring out like pirates from their hiding-places of the day. One
after another, as the darkness thickened, the different tribes of the
people of the night answered the summons of the first stars. A mile down
the river a loon gave its harsh love-cry; far out of the west came the
faint trail-song of a wolf; in the river the night-feeding trout splashed
like the tails of beaver; over the roof of the wilderness came the
coughing, moaning challenge of a bull moose that yearned for battle. And
over these same forest tops rose the moon, the stars grew thicker and
brighter, and through the finger of hardwood glowed the fire of St.
Pierre Boulain's men&mdash;while close beside him, silent in these hours
of silence, David felt growing nearer and still nearer to him the
presence of St. Pierre's wife.</p>

<p>On the strip of sand Andre, the Broken Man, rose and stood like the
stub of a misshapen tree. And then slowly he moved on and was swallowed
up in the mellow glow of the night.</p>

<p>"It is at night that he seeks," said St. Pierre's wife, for it was as
if David had spoken the thought that was in his mind.</p>

<p>David, for a moment, was silent. And then he said, "You asked me to
tell you about Black Roger Audemard. I will, if you care to have me. Do
you?"</p>

<p>He saw the nodding of her head, though the moon and star-mist veiled
her face.</p>

<p>"Yes. What do the Police say about Roger Audemard?"</p>

<p>He told her. And not once in the telling of the story did she speak or
move. It was a terrible story at best, he thought, but he did not weaken
it by smoothing over the details. This was his opportunity. He wanted her
to know why he must possess the body of Roger Audemard, if not alive,
then dead, and he wanted her to understand how important it was that he
learn more about Andre, the Broken Man.</p>

<p>"He was a fiend, this Roger Audemard," he began. "A devil in man
shape, afterward called 'Black Roger' because of the color of his
soul."</p>

<p>Then he went on. He described Hatchet River Post, where the tragedy
had happened; then told of the fight that came about one day between
Roger Audemard and the factor of the post and his two sons. It was an
unfair fight; he conceded that&mdash;three to one was cowardly in a
fight. But it could not excuse what happened afterward. Audemard was
beaten. He crept off into the forest, almost dead. Then he came back one
stormy night in the winter with three strange friends. Who the friends
were the Police never learned. There was a fight, but all through the
fight Black Roger Audemard cried out not to kill the factor and his sons.
In spite of that one of the sons was killed. Then the terrible thing
happened. The father and his remaining son were bound hand and foot and
fastened in the ancient dungeon room under the Post building. Then Black
Roger set the building on fire, and stood outside in the storm and
laughed like a madman at the dying shrieks of his victims. It was the
season when the trappers were on their lines, and there were but few
people at the post. The company clerk and one other attempted to
interfere, and Black Roger killed them with his own hands. Five deaths
that night&mdash;two of them horrible beyond description!</p>

<p>Resting for a moment, Carrigan went on to tell of the long years of
unavailing search made by the Police after that; how Black Roger was
caught once and killed his captor. Then came the rumor that he was dead,
and rumor grew into official belief, and the Police no longer hunted for
his trails. Then, not long ago, came the discovery that Black Roger was
still living, and he, Dave Carrigan, was after him.</p>

<p>For a time there was silence after he had finished. Then St. Pierre's
wife rose to her feet. "I wonder," she said in a low voice, "what Roger
Audemard's own story might be if he were here to tell it?"</p>

<p>She stepped out from under the awning, and in the full radiance of the
moon he saw the pale beauty of her face and the crowning luster of her
hair.</p>

<p>"Good night!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Good night!" said David.</p>

<p>He listened until her retreating footsteps died away, and for hours
after that he had no thought of sleep. He had insisted that she take
possession of her cabin again, and Bateese had brought out a bundle of
blankets. These he spread under the awning, and when he drowsed off, it
was to dream of the lovely face he had seen last in the glow of the
moon.</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon of the fourth day that two things
happened&mdash;one that he had prepared himself for, and another so
unexpected that for a space it sent his world crashing out of its orbit.
With St. Pierre's wife he had gone again to the ridge-line for flowers,
half a mile back from the river. Returning a new way, they came to a
shallow stream, and Marie-Anne stood at the edge of it, and there was
laughter in her shining eyes as she looked to the other side of it. She
had twined flowers into her hair. Her cheeks were rich with color. Her
slim figure was exquisite in its wild pulse of life.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned on him, her red lips smiling their witchery in his
face. "You must carry me across," she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer. He was a-tremble as he drew near her. She raised
her arms a little, waiting. And then he picked her up. She was against
his breast. Her two hands went to his shoulders as he waded into the
stream; he slipped, and they clung a little tighter. The soft note of
laughter was in her throat when the current came to his knees out in the
middle of the stream. He held her tighter; and then stupidly, he slipped
again, and the movement brought her lower in his arms, so that for a
space her head was against his breast and his face was crushed in the
soft masses of her hair. He came with her that way to the opposite shore
and stood her on her feet again, standing back quickly so that she would
not hear the pounding of his heart. Her face was radiantly beautiful, and
she did not look at David, but away from him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, they heard running feet behind them, and in
another moment one of the brigade men came dashing through the stream. At
the same time there came from the river a quarter of a mile away a
thunderous burst of voice. It was not the voice of a dozen men, but of
half a hundred, and Marie-Anne grew tense, listening, her eyes on fire
even before the messenger could get the words out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"It is St. Pierre!" he cried then. "He has come with the great raft,
and you must hurry if you would reach the bateau before he lands!"</p>

<p>In that moment it seemed to David that Marie-Anne forgot he was alive.
A little cry came to her lips, and then she left him, running swiftly,
saying no word to him, flying with the speed of a fawn to St. Pierre
Boulain! And when David turned to the man who had come up behind them,
there was a strange smile on the lips of the lithe-limbed forest-runner
as his eyes followed the hurrying figure of St. Pierre's wife.</p>

<p>Until she was out of sight he stood in silence and then he said:</p>

<p>"Come, m'sieu. We, also, must meet St. Pierre!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_15">XIV</a></h3>

<p>David moved slowly behind the brigade man. He had no desire to hurry.
He did not wish to see what happened when Marie-Anne met St. Pierre
Boulain. Only a moment ago she had been in his arms; her hair had
smothered his face; her hands had clung to his shoulders; her flushed
cheeks and long lashes had for an instant lain close against his breast.
And now, swiftly, without a word of apology, she was running away from
him to meet her husband.</p>

<p>He almost spoke that word aloud as he saw the last of her slim figure
among the silver birches. She was going to the man to whom she belonged,
and there was no hesitation in the manner of her going. She was glad. And
she was entirely forgetful of him, Dave Carrigan, in that gladness.</p>

<p>He quickened his steps, narrowing the distance between him and the
hurrying brigade man. Only the diseased thoughts in his brain had made
the happening in the creek anything but an accident. It was all an
accident, he told himself. Marie-Anne had asked him to carry her across
just as she would have asked any one of her rivermen. It was his fault,
and not hers, that he had slipped in mid-stream, and that his arms had
closed tighter about her, and that her hair had brushed his face. He
remembered she had laughed, when it seemed for a moment that they were
going to fall into the stream together. Probably she would tell St.
Pierre all about it. Surely she would never guess it had been nearer
tragedy than comedy for him.</p>

<p>Once more he was convinced he had proved himself a weakling and a
fool. His business now was with St. Pierre, and the hour was at hand when
the game had ceased to be a woman's game. He had looked ahead to this
hour. He had prepared himself for it and had promised himself action that
would be both quick and decisive. And yet, as he went on, his heart was
still thumping unsteadily, and in his arms and against his face remained
still the sweet, warm thrill of his contact with Marie-Anne. He could not
drive that from him. It would never completely go. As long as he lived,
what had happened in the creek would live with him. He did not deny that
crying voice inside him. It was easy for his mouth to make words. He
could call himself a fool and a weakling, but those words were purely
mechanical, hollow, meaningless. The truth remained. It was a blazing
fire in his breast, a conflagration that might easily get the best of
him, a thing which he must fight and triumph over for his own salvation.
He did not think of danger for Marie-Anne, for such a thought was
inconceivable. The tragedy was one-sided. It was his own folly, his own
danger. For just as he loved Marie-Anne, so did she love her husband, St.
Pierre.</p>

<p>He came to the low ridge close to the river and climbed up through the
thick birches and poplars. At the top was a bald knob of sandstone, over
which the riverman had already passed. David paused there and looked down
on the broad sweep of the Athabasca.</p>

<p>What he saw was like a picture spread out on the great breast of the
river and the white strip of shoreline. Still a quarter of a mile
upstream, floating down slowly with the current, was a mighty raft, and
for a space his eyes took in nothing else. On the Mackenzie, the
Athabasca, the Saskatchewan, and the Peace he had seen many rafts, but
never a raft like this of St. Pierre Boulain. It was a hundred feet in
width and twice and a half times as long, and with the sun blazing down
upon it from out of a cloudless sky it looked to him like a little city
swept up from out of some archaic and savage desert land to be
transplanted to the river. It was dotted with tents and canvas shelters.
Some of these were gray, and some were white, and two or three were
striped with broad bands of yellow and red. Behind all these was a cabin,
and over this there rose a slender staff from which floated the black and
white pennant of St. Pierre. The raft was alive. Men were running between
the tents. The long rudder sweeps were flashing in the sun. Rowers with
naked arms and shoulders were straining their muscles in four York boats
that were pulling like ants at the giant mass of timber. And to David's
ears came a deep monotone of human voices, the chanting of the men as
they worked.</p>

<p>Nearer to him a louder response suddenly made answer to it. A dozen
steps carried him round a projecting thumb of brush, and he could see the
open shore where the bateau was tied. Marie-Anne had crossed the strip of
sand, and Bateese was helping her into a waiting York boat. Then Bateese
shoved it off, and the four men in it began to row. Two canoes were
already half-way to the raft, and David recognized the occupant of one of
them as Andre, the Broken Man. Then he saw Marie-Anne rise in the York
boat and wave something white in her hand.</p>

<p>He looked again toward the raft. The current and the sweeps and the
tugging boats were drawing it steadily nearer. Standing at the very edge
of it he saw now a solitary figure, and in the clear sunlight the man
stood out clean-cut as a carven statue. He was a giant in size. His head
and arms were bare, and he was looking steadily toward the bateau and the
approaching York boat. He raised an arm, and a moment later the movement
was followed by a voice that rose above all other voices. It boomed over
the river like the rumble of a gun. In response to it Marie-Anne waved
the white thing in her hand, and David thought he heard her voice in an
answering cry. He stared again at the solitary figure of the man, seeing
nothing else, hearing no other sound but the booming of the deep cry that
came again over the river. His heart was thumping. In his eyes was a
gathering fire. His body grew tense. For he knew that at last he was
looking at St. Pierre, chief of the Boulains, and husband of the woman he
loved.</p>

<p>As the significance of the situation grew upon him, a flash of his old
humor returned. It was the same grim humor that had possessed him behind
the rock, when he had thought he was going to die. Fate had played him a
dishonest turn then, and it was doing the same thing by him now. Unless
he deliberately turned his face away, he was going to see the reunion of
Marie-Anne and St. Pierre.</p>

<p>Yesterday he had strapped his binoculars to his belt. Today Marie-
Anne had looked through them a dozen times. They had been a source of
pleasure and thrill to her. Now, David thought, they would be good
medicine for him. He would see the whole thing through, and at close
range. He would leave himself no room for doubt. He had laughed behind
the rock, when bullets were zipping close to his head, and the same grim
smile came to his lips now as he focused his glasses on the solitary
figure at the head of the raft.</p>

<p>The smile died away when he saw St. Pierre. It was as if he could
reach out and touch him with his hand. And never, he thought, had he seen
such a man. A moment before, a flashing vision had come to him from out
of an Arabian desert; the multitude of colored tents, the half-naked men,
the great raft floating almost without perceptible motion on the placid
breast of the river had stirred his imagination until he saw a strange
picture. But there was nothing Arabic, nothing desert-like, in this man
his binoculars brought within a few feet of his eyes. He was more like a
viking pirate who had roved the sea a few centuries ago. One great, bare
arm was raised as David looked, and his booming voice was rolling over
the river again. His hair was shaggy, and untrimmed, and red; he wore a
short beard that glistened in the sun&mdash;he was laughing as he waved
and shouted to Marie-Anne&mdash;a joyous, splendid giant of a man who
seemed almost on the point of leaping into the water in his eagerness to
clasp in his naked arms the woman who was coming to him.</p>

<p>David drew a deep breath, and there came an unconscious tightening at
his heart as he turned his glasses upon Marie-Anne. She was still
standing in the bow of the York boat, and her back was toward him. He
could see the glisten of the sun in her hair. She was waving her
handkerchief, and the poise of her slim body told him that in her
eagerness she would have darted from the bow of the boat had she
possessed wings.</p>

<p>Again he looked at St. Pierre. And this was the man who was no match
for Concombre Bateese! It was inconceivable. Yet he heard Marie-Anne's
voice repeating those very words in his ear. But she had surely been
joking with him. She had been storing up this little surprise for him.
She had wanted him to discover with his own eyes what a splendid man was
this chief of the Boulains. And yet, as David stared, there came to him
an unpleasant thought of the incongruity of this thing he was looking
upon. It struck upon him like a clashing discord, the fact of matehood
between these two&mdash;a condition inconsistent and out of tune with the
beautiful things he had built up in his mind about the woman. In his soul
he had enshrined her as a lovely wildflower, easily crushed, easily
destroyed, a sweet treasure to be guarded from all that was rough and
savage, a little violet-goddess as fragile as she was brave and loyal.
And St. Pierre, standing there at the edge of his raft, looked as if he
had come up out of the caves of a million years ago! There was something
barbaric about him. He needed only a club and a shield and the skin of a
beast about his loins to transform him into prehistoric man. At least
these were his first impressions&mdash;impressions roused by thought of
Marie-Anne's slim, beautiful body crushed close in the embrace of that
laughing, powerful-lunged giant. Then the reaction swept over him. St.
Pierre was not a monster, even though his disturbed mind unconsciously
made an effort to conceive him as such. There were gladness and laughter
in his face. There was the contagion of joy and good cheer in the voice
that boomed over the water. Laughter and shouts answered it from the
shore. The rowers in Marie-Anne's York boat burst into a wild and
exultant snatch of song and made their oars fairly crack. There came a
solitary yell from Andre, the Broken Man, who was close to the head of
the raft now. And from the raft itself came a slowly swelling volume of
sound, the urge and voice and exultation of red-blooded men a-thrill with
the glory of this day and the wild freedom of their world. The truth came
to David. St. Pierre Boulain was the beloved Big Brother of his
people.</p>

<p>He waited, his muscles tense, his jaws set tight. Good medicine, he
called it again, a righteous sort of punishment set upon him for the
moral cowardice he had betrayed in falling down in worship at the feet of
another man's wife. The York boat was very close to the head of the raft
now. He saw Marie-Anne herself fling a rope to St. Pierre. Then the boat
swung alongside. In another moment St. Pierre had leaned over, and
Marie-Anne was with him on the raft. For a space everything else in the
world was obliterated for David. He saw St. Pierre's arms gather the slim
form into their embrace. He saw Marie-Anne's hands go up fondly to the
bearded face. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>Carrigan cut the picture there. He turned his shoulder to the raft and
snapped the binoculars in the case at his belt. Some one was coming in
his direction from the bateau. It was the riverman who had brought to
Marie-Anne the news of St. Pierre's arrival. David went down to meet him.
From the foot of the ridge he again turned his eyes in the direction of
the raft. St. Pierre and Marie-Anne were just about to enter the little
cabin built in the center of the drifting mass of timber.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_16">XV</a></h3>

<p>It was easy for Carrigan to guess why the riverman had turned back for
him. Men were busy about the bateau, and Concombre Bateese stood in the
stern, a long pole in his hands, giving commands to the others. The
bateau was beginning to swing out into the stream when he leaped aboard.
A wide grin spread over the half-breed's face. He eyed David keenly and
laughed in his deep chest, an unmistakable suggestiveness in the note of
it.</p>

<p>"You look seek, m'sieu," he said in an undertone, for David's ears
alone, "You look ver' unhappy, an' pale lak leetle boy! Wat happen w'en
you look t'rough ze glass up there, eh? Or ees it zat you grow frighten
because ver' soon you stan' up an' fight Concombre Bateese? Eh, coq de
bruyere? Ees it zat?"</p>

<p>A quick thought came to David. "Is it true that St. Pierre can not
whip you, Bateese?"</p>

<p>Bateese threw out his chest with a mighty intake of breath. Then he
exploded: "No man on all T'ree River can w'ip Concombre Bateese."</p>

<p>"And St. Pierre is a powerful man," mused David, letting his eyes
travel slowly from the half-breed's moccasined feet to the top of his
head. "I measured him well through the glasses, Bateese. It will be a
great fight. But I shall whip you!"</p>

<p>He did not wait for the half-breed to reply, but went into the cabin
and closed the door behind him. He did not like the taunting note of
suggestiveness in the other's words. Was it possible that Bateese
suspected the true state of his mind, that he was in love with the wife
of St. Pierre, and that his heart was sick because of what he had seen
aboard the raft? He flushed hotly. It made him uncomfortable to feel that
even the half-breed might have guessed his humiliation.</p>

<p>David looked through the window toward the raft. The bateau was
drifting downstream, possibly a hundred feet from the shore, but it was
quite evident that Concombre Bateese was making no effort to bring it
close to the floating mass of timber, which had made no change in its
course down the river. David's mind painted swiftly what was happening in
the cabin into which Marie-Anne and St. Pierre had disappeared. At this
moment Marie-Anne was telling of him, of the adventure in the hot patch
of sand. He fancied the suppressed excitement in her voice as she
unburdened herself. He saw St. Pierre's face darken, his muscles
tighten&mdash;and crouching in silence, he seemed to see the misshapen
hulk of Andre, the Broken Man, listening to what was passing between the
other two. And he heard again the mad monotone of Andre's voice, crying
plaintively, "HAS ANY ONE SEEN BLACK ROGER AUDEMARD?"</p>

<p>His blood ran a little faster, and his old craft was a dominantly
living thing within him once more. Love had dulled both his ingenuity and
his desire. For a space a thing had risen before him that was mightier
than the majesty of the Law, and he had TRIED to miss the
bull's-eye&mdash;because of his love for the wife of St. Pierre Boulain.
Now he shot squarely for it, and the bell rang in his brain. Two times
two again made four. Facts assembled themselves like arguments in flesh
and blood. Those facts would have convinced Superintendent McVane, and
they now convinced David. He had set out to get Black Roger Audemard,
alive or dead. And Black Roger, wholesale murderer, a monster who had
painted the blackest page of crime known in the history of Canadian law,
was closely and vitally associated with Marie-Anne and St. Pierre
Boulain!</p>

<p>The thing was a shock, but Carrigan no longer tried to evade the
point. His business was no longer with a man supposed to be a thousand or
fifteen hundred miles farther north. It was with Marie-Anne, St. Pierre,
and Andre, the Broken Man. And also with Concombre Bateese.</p>

<p>He smiled a little grimly as he thought of his approaching battle with
the half-breed. St. Pierre would be astounded at the proposition he had
in store for him. But he was sure that St. Pierre would accept. And then,
if he won the fight with Bateese&mdash;</p>

<p>The smile faded from his lips. His face grew older as he looked slowly
about the bateau cabin, with its sweet and lingering whispers of a
woman's presence. It was a part of her. It breathed of her fragrance and
her beauty; it seemed to be waiting for her, crying softly for her
return. Yet once had there been another woman even lovelier than the wife
of St. Pierre. He had not hesitated then. Without great effort he had
triumphed over the loveliness of Carmin Fanchet and had sent her brother
to the hangman. And now, as he recalled those days, the truth came to him
that even in the darkest hour Carmin Fanchet had made not the slightest
effort to buy him off with her beauty. She had not tried to lure him. She
had fought proudly and defiantly. And had Marie- Anne done that? His
fingers clenched slowly, and a thickening came in his throat. Would she
tell St. Pierre of the many hours they had spent together? Would she
confess to him the secret of that precious moment when she had lain close
against his breast, her arms about him, her face pressed to his? Would
she speak to him of secret hours, of warm flushes that had come to her
face, of glowing fires that at times had burned in her eyes when he had
been very near to her? Would she reveal EVERYTHING to St. Pierre&mdash;
her husband? He was powerless to combat the voice that told him no.
Carmin Fanchet had fought him openly as an enemy and had not employed her
beauty as a weapon. Marie-Anne had put in his way a great temptation.
What he was thinking seemed to him like a sacrilege, yet he knew there
could be no discriminating distinctions between weapons, now that he was
determined to play the game to the end, for the Law.</p>

<p>When Carrigan went out on deck, the half-breed was sweating from his
exertion at the stern sweep. He looked at the agent de police who was
going to fight him, perhaps tomorrow or the next day. There was a change
in Carrigan. He was not the same man who had gone into the cabin an hour
before, and the fact impressed itself upon Bateese. There was something
in his appearance that held back the loose talk at the end of Concombre's
tongue. And so it was Carrigan himself who spoke first.</p>

<p>"When will this man St. Pierre come to see me?" he demanded. "If he
doesn't come soon, I shall go to him."</p>

<p>For an instant Concombre's face darkened. Then, as he bent over the
sweep with his great back to David, he chuckled audibly, and said:</p>

<p>"Would you go, m'sieu? Ah&mdash;it is le malade d'amour over there in
the cabin. Surely you would not break in upon their love-making?"</p>

<p>Bateese did not look over his shoulder, and so he did not see the hot
flush that gathered in David's face. But David was sure he knew it was
there and that Concombre had guessed the truth of matters. There was a
sly note in his voice, as if he could not quite keep to himself his
exultation that beauty and bright eyes had played a clever trick on this
man who, if his own judgment had been followed, would now be resting
peacefully at the bottom of the river. It was the final stab to Carrigan.
His muscles tensed. For the first time he felt the desire to shoot a
naked fist into the grinning mouth of Concombre Bateese. He laid a hand
on the half-breed's shoulder, and Bateese turned about slowly. He saw
what was in the other's eyes.</p>

<p>"Until this moment I have not known what a great pleasure it will be
to fight you, Bateese," said David quietly. "Make it tomorrow&mdash; in
the morning, if you wish. Take word to St. Pierre that I will make him a
great wager that I win, a gamble so large that I think he will be afraid
to cover it. For I don't think much of this St. Pierre of yours, Bateese.
I believe him to be a big-winded bluff, like yourself. And also a coward.
Mark my word, he will be so much afraid that he will not accept my
wager!"</p>

<p>Bateese did not answer. He was looking over David's shoulder. He
seemed not to have heard what the other had said, yet there had come a
sudden gleam of exultation in his eyes, and he replied, still gazing
toward the raft,</p>

<p>"Diantre, m'sieu coq de bruyere may keep ze beeg word in hees mout'!
See!&mdash;St. Pierre, he ees comin' to answer for himself. Mon Dieu, I
hope he does not wring ze leetle rooster's neck, for zat would spoil wan
great, gran' fight tomorrow!"</p>

<p>David turned toward the big raft. At the distance which separated them
he could make out the giant figure of St. Pierre Boulain getting into a
canoe. The humped-up form already in that canoe he knew was the Broken
Man. He could not see Marie-Anne.</p>

<p>Very lightly Bateese touched his arm. "M'sieu will go into ze cabin,"
he suggested softly. "If somet'ing happens, it ees bes' too many eyes do
not see it. You understan', m'sieu agent de police?"</p>

<p>Carrigan nodded. "I understand," he said.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_17">XVI</a></h3>

<p>In the cabin David waited. He did not look through the window to watch
St. Pierre's approach. He sat down and picked up a magazine from the
table upon which Marie-Anne's work-basket lay. He was cool as ice now.
His blood flowed evenly and his pulse beat unhurriedly. Never had he felt
himself more his own master, more like grappling with a situation. St.
Pierre was coming to fight. He had no doubt of that. Perhaps not
physically, at first. But, one way or another, something dynamic was
bound to happen in the bateau cabin within the next half-hour. Now that
the impending drama was close at hand, Carrigan's scheme of luring St.
Pierre into the making of a stupendous wager seemed to him rather
ridiculous. With calculating coldness he was forced to concede that St.
Pierre would be somewhat of a fool to accept the wager he had in mind,
when he was so completely in St. Pierre's power. For Marie-Anne and the
chief of the Boulains, the bottom of the river would undoubtedly be the
best and easiest solution, and the half- breed's suggestion might be
acted upon after all.</p>

<p>As his mind charged itself for the approaching struggle, David found
himself staring at a double page in the magazine, given up entirely to
impossibly slim young creatures exhibiting certain bits of illusive and
mysterious feminine apparel. Marie-Anne had expressed her approbation in
the form of pencil notes under several of them. Under a cobwebby affair
that wreathed one of the slim figures he read, "St. Pierre will love
this!" There were two exclamation points after that particular
notation!</p>

<p>David replaced the magazine on the table and looked toward the door.
No, St. Pierre would not hesitate to put him at the bottom of the river,
for her. Not if he, Dave Carrigan, made the solution of the matter a
necessity. There were times, he told himself, when it was confoundedly
embarrassing to force the letter of the law. And this was one of them. He
was not afraid of the river bottom. He was thinking again of
Marie-Anne.</p>

<p>The scraping of a canoe against the side of the bateau recalled him
suddenly to the moment at hand. He heard low voices, and one of them, he
knew, was St. Pierre's. For an interval the voices continued, frequently
so low that he could not distinguish them at all. For ten minutes he
waited impatiently. Then the door swung open, and St. Pierre came in.</p>

<p>Slowly and coolly David rose to meet him, and at the same moment the
chief of the Boulains closed the door behind him. There was no greeting
in Carrigan's manner. He was the Law, waiting, unexcited, sure of
himself, impassive as a thing of steel. He was ready to fight. He
expected to fight. It only remained for St. Pierre to show what sort of
fight it was to be. And he was amazed at St. Pierre, without betraying
that amazement. In the vivid light that shot through the western windows
the chief of the Boulains stood looking at David. He wore a gray flannel
shirt open at the throat, and it was a splendid throat David saw, and a
splendid head above it, with its reddish beard and hair. But what he saw
chiefly were St. Pierre's eyes. They were the sort of eyes he disliked to
find in an enemy&mdash;a grayish, steely blue that reflected sunlight
like polished flint. But there was no flash of battle-glow in them now.
St. Pierre was neither excited nor in a bad humor. Nor did Carrigan's
attitude appear to disturb him in the least. He was smiling; his eyes
glowed with almost boyish curiosity as he stared appraisingly at
David&mdash;and then, slowly, a low chuckle of laughter rose in his deep
chest, and he advanced with an outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I am St. Pierre Boulain," he said. "I have heard a great deal about
you, Sergeant Carrigan. You have had an unfortunate time!"</p>

<p>Had the man advanced menacingly, David would have felt more
comfortable. It was disturbing to have this giant come to him with an
extended hand of apparent friendship when he had anticipated an entirely
different sort of meeting. And St. Pierre was laughing at him! There was
no doubt of that. And he had the colossal nerve to tell him that he had
been unfortunate, as though being shot up by somebody's wife was a fairly
decent joke!</p>

<p>Carrigan's attitude did not change. He did not reach out a hand to
meet the other. There was no responsive glimmer of humor in his eyes or
on his lips. And seeing these things, St. Pierre turned his extended hand
to the open box of cigars, so that he stood for a moment with his back
toward him.</p>

<p>"It's funny," he said, as if speaking to himself, and with only a
drawling note of the French patois in his voice. "I come home, find my
Jeanne in a terrible mix-up, a stranger in her room&mdash;and the
stranger refuses to let me laugh or shake hands with him. Tonnerre, I say
it is funny! And my Jeanne saved his life, and made him muffins, and gave
him my own bed, and walked with him in the forest! Ah, the ungrateful
cochon!"</p>

<p>He turned, laughing openly, so that his deep voice filled the cabin.
"Vous aves de la corde de pendu, m'sieu&mdash;yes, you are a lucky dog!
For only one other man in the world would my Jeanne have done that. You
are lucky because you were not ended behind the rock; you are lucky
because you are not at the bottom of the river; you are lucky&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shrugged his big shoulders hopelessly. "And now, after all our
kindness and your good luck, you wait for me like an enemy, m'sieu.
Diable, I can not understand!"</p>

<p>For the life of him Carrigan could not, in these few moments, measure
up his man. He had said nothing. He had let St. Pierre talk. And now St.
Pierre stood there, one of the finest men he had ever looked upon, as if
honestly overcome by a great wonder. And yet behind that apparent
incredulity in his voice and manner David sensed the deep underflow of
another thing. St. Pierre was all that Marie-Anne had claimed for him,
and more. She had given him assurance of her unlimited confidence that
her husband could adjust any situation in the world, and Carrigan
conceded that St. Pierre measured up splendidly to that particular type
of man. The smile had not left his face; the good humor was still in his
eyes.</p>

<p>David smiled back at him coldly. He recognized the cleverness of the
other's play. St. Pierre was a man who would smile like that even as he
fought, and Carrigan loved a smiling fighter, even when he had to slip
steel bracelets over his wrists.</p>

<p>"I am Sergeant Carrigan, of 'N' Division, Royal Northwest Mounted
Police," he said, repeating the formula of the law. "Sit down, St.
Pierre, and I will tell you a few things that have happened. And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Non, non, it is not necessary, m'sieu. I have already listened for an
hour, and I do not like to hear a story twice. You are of the Police. I
love the Police. They are brave men, and brave men are my brothers. You
are out after Roger Audemard, the rascal! Is it not so? And you were shot
at behind the rock back there. You were almost killed. Ma foi, and it was
my Jeanne who did the shooting! Yes, she thought you were another man."
The chuckling, drum-like note of laughter came again out of St. Pierre's
great chest. "It was bad shooting. I have taught her better, but the sun
was blinding there in the hot, white sand. And after that&mdash;I know
everything that has happened. Bateese was wrong. I shall scold him for
wanting to put you at the bottom of the river&mdash;perhaps. Oui, ce que
femme veut, Dieu le veut&mdash;that is it. A woman must have her way, and
my Jeanne's gentle heart was touched because you were a brave and
handsome man, M'sieu Carrigan. But I am not jealous. Jealousy is a worm
that does not make friendship! And we shall be friends. Only as a friend
could I take you to the Chateau Boulain, far up on the Yellowknife. And
we are going there."</p>

<p>In spite of what might have been the entirely proper thing to do at
this particular moment, Carrigan's face broke into a smile as he drew a
second chair up close to the table. He was swift to readjust himself. It
came suddenly back to him how he had grinned behind the rock, when death
seemed close at hand. And St. Pierre was like that now. David measured
him again as the chief of the Boulains sat down opposite him. Such a man
could not be afraid of anything on the face of the earth, even of the
Law. The gleam that lay in his eyes told David that as they met his own
over the table. "We are smiling now because it happens to please us,"
David read in them. "But in a moment, if it is necessary, we shall
fight."</p>

<p>Carrigan leaned a little over the table. "You know we are not going to
the Chateau Boulain, St. Pierre," he said. "We are going to stop at Fort
McMurray, and there you and your wife must answer for a number of things
that have happened. There is one way out&mdash; possibly. That is largely
up to you. Why did your wife try to kill me behind the rock? And what did
you know about Black Roger Audemard?"</p>

<p>St. Pierre's eyes did not for an instant leave Carrigan's face. Slowly
a change came into them; the smile faded, the blue went out, and up from
behind seemed to come another pair of eyes that were hard as steel and
cold as ice. Yet they were not eyes that threatened, nor eyes that
betrayed excitement or passion. And St. Pierre's voice, when he spoke,
lacked the deep and vibrant note that had been in it. It was as if he had
placed upon it the force of a mighty will, chaining it back, just as
something hidden and terrible lay chained behind his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why play like little children, M'sieu Carrigan?" he asked. "Why not
come out squarely, honestly, like men? I know what has happened. Mon
Dieu, it was bad! You were almost killed, and you heard that poor wreck,
Andre, call for Roger Audemard. My Jeanne has told you about
that&mdash;how I found him in the forest with his broken mind and body.
And about my Jeanne&mdash;" St. Pierre's fists grew into knotted lumps on
the table. "Non, I will die&mdash;I will kill you&mdash;before I will
tell you why she shot at you behind the rock! We are men, both of us. We
are not afraid. And you&mdash;in my place&mdash;what would YOU do,
m'sieu?"</p>

<p>In the moment's silence each man looked steadily at the other.</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;fight," said David slowly. "If it was for her, I am
pretty sure I would fight."</p>

<p>He believed that he was drawing the net in now, that it would catch
St. Pierre. He leaned a little farther over the table.</p>

<p>"And I, too, must fight," he added. "You know our law, St. Pierre. We
don't go back without our man&mdash;unless we happen to die. And I would
be stupid if I did not understand the situation here. It would be quite
easy for you to get rid of me. But I don't believe you are a murderer,
even if your Jeanne tried to be." A flicker of a smile crossed his lips.
"And Marie-Anne&mdash;I beg pardon!&mdash;your wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>St. Pierre interrupted him. "It will please me to have you call her
Marie-Anne. And it will please her also, m'sieu. Dieu, if we only had
eyes that could see what is in a woman's heart! Life is funny, m'sieu. It
is a great joke, I swear it on my soul!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, smiling again straight into David's eyes.
"See what has happened! You set out for a murderer. My Jeanne makes a
great mistake and shoots you. Then she pities you, saves your life,
brings you here, and&mdash;ma foi! it is true&mdash;learns to care for
you more than she should! But that does not make me want to kill you.
Non, her happiness is mine. Dead men tell no tales, m'sieu, but there are
times when living men also keep tales to themselves. And that is what you
are going to do, M'sieu Carrigan. You are going to keep to yourself the
thing that happened behind the rock. You are going to keep to yourself
the mumblings of our poor mad Andre. Never will they pass your lips. I
know. I swear it. I stake my life on it!" St. Pierre was talking slowly
and unexcitedly. There was an immeasurable confidence in his deep voice.
It did not imply a threat or a warning. He was sure of himself. And his
eyes had deepened into blue again and were almost friendly.</p>

<p>"You would stake your life?" repeated Carrigan questioningly. "You
would do that?"</p>

<p>St. Pierre rose to his feet and looked about the cabin with a shining
light in his eyes that was both pride and exaltation. He moved toward the
end of the room, where the piano stood, and for a moment his big fingers
touched the keys; then, seeing the lacy bit of handkerchief that lay
there, he picked it up&mdash;and placed it back again. Carrigan did not
urge his question, but waited. In spite of his effort to fight it down he
found himself in the grip of a mysterious and growing thrill as he
watched St. Pierre. Never had the presence of another man had the same
effect upon him, and strangely the thought came to him that he was
matched&mdash;even overmatched. It was as if St. Pierre had brought with
him into the cabin something more than the splendid strength of his body,
a thing that reached out in the interval of silence between them, warning
Carrigan that all the law in the world would not swerve the chief of the
Boulains from what was already in his mind. For a moment the thought
passed from David that fate had placed him up against the hazard of
enmity with St. Pierre. His vision centered in the man alone. And as he,
too, rose to his feet, an unconscious smile came to his lips as he
recalled the boastings of Bateese.</p>

<p>"I ask you," said he, "if you would really stake your life in a matter
such as that? Of course, if your words were merely accidental, and meant
nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I had a dozen lives, I would stake them, one on top of the other,
as I have said," interrupted St. Pierre. Suddenly his laugh boomed out
and his voice became louder. "M'sieu Carrigan, I have come to offer you
just that test! Oui, I could kill you now. I could put you at the bottom
of the river, as Bateese thinks is right. Mon Dieu, how completely I
could make you disappear! And then my Jeanne would be safe. She would not
go behind prison bars. She would go on living, and laughing, and singing
in the big forests, where she belongs. And Black Roger Audemard, the
rascal, would be safe for a time! But that would be like destroying a
little child. You are so helpless now. So you are going on to the Chateau
Boulain with us, and if at the end of the second month from today you do
not willingly say I have won my wager&mdash;why&mdash; m'sieu&mdash;I
will go with you into the forest, and you may shoot out of me the life
which is my end of the gamble. Is that not fair? Can you suggest a better
way&mdash;between men like you and me?"</p>

<p>"I can at least suggest a way that has the virtue of saving time,"
replied David. "First, however, I must understand my position here. I am,
I take it, a prisoner."</p>

<p>"A guest, with certain restrictions placed upon you, m'sieu,"
corrected St. Pierre.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met on a dead level.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning I am going to fight Bateese," said David. "It is a
little sporting event we have fixed up between us for the amusement
of&mdash;your men. I have heard that Bateese is the best fighting man
along the Three Rivers. And I&mdash;I do not like to have any other man
claim that distinction when I am around."</p>

<p>For the first time St. Pierre's placidity seemed to leave him. His
brow became clouded, a moment's frown grew in his face, and there was a
certain disconsolate hopelessness in the shrug of his shoulders. It was
as if Carrigan's words had suddenly robbed the day of all its sunshine
for the chief of the Boulains. His voice, too, carried an unhappy and
disappointed note as he made a gesture toward the window.</p>

<p>"M'sieu, on that raft out there are many of my men, and they have
scarcely rested or slept since word was brought to them that a stranger
was to fight Concombre Bateese. Tonnerre, they have gambled without ever
seeing you until the clothes on their backs are in the hazard, and they
have cracked their muscles in labor to overtake you! They have prayed
away their very souls that it would be a good fight, and that Bateese
would not eat you up too quickly. It has been a long time since we have
seen a good fight, a long time since the last man dared to stand up
against the half- breed. Ugh, it tears out my heart to tell you that the
fight can not be!"</p>

<p>St. Pierre made no effort to suppress his emotion. He was like a huge,
disappointed boy. He walked to the window, peered forth at the raft, and
as he shrugged his big shoulders again something like a groan came from
him.</p>

<p>The thrill of approaching triumph swept through David's blood. The
flame of it was in his eyes when St. Pierre turned from the window.</p>

<p>"And you are disappointed, St. Pierre? You would like to see that
fight!"</p>

<p>The blue steel in St. Pierre's eyes flashed back. "If the price were a
year of my life, I would give it&mdash;if Bateese did not eat you up too
quickly. I love to look upon a good fight, where there is no venom of
hatred in the blows!"</p>

<p>"Then you shall see a good fight, St. Pierre."</p>

<p>"Bateese would kill you, m'sieu. You are not big. You are not his
match."</p>

<p>"I shall whip him, St. Pierre&mdash;whip him until he avows me his
master."</p>

<p>"You do not know the half-breed, m'sieu. Twice I have tried him in
friendly combat myself and have been beaten."</p>

<p>"But I shall whip him," repeated Carrigan. "I will wager you
anything&mdash;anything in the world&mdash;even life against
life&mdash;that I whip him!"</p>

<p>The gloom had faded from the face of St. Pierre Boulain. But in a
moment it clouded again.</p>

<p>"My Jeanne has made me promise that I will stop the fight," he
said.</p>

<p>"And why&mdash;why should she insist in a matter such as this, which
properly should be settled among men?" asked David.</p>

<p>Again St. Pierre laughed; with an effort, it seemed, "She is
gentle-hearted, m'sieu. She laughed and thought it quite a joke when
Bateese humbled me. 'What! My great St. Pierre, with the blood of old
France in his veins, beaten by a man who has been named after a
vegetable!' she cried. I tell you she was merry over it, m'sieu! She
laughed until the tears came into her eyes. But with you it is different.
She was white when she entreated me not to let you fight Bateese. Yes,
she is afraid you will be badly hurt. And she does not want to see you
hurt again. But I tell you that I am not jealous, m'sieu! She does not
try to hide things from me. She tells me everything, like a little child.
And so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going to fight Bateese," said David. He wondered if St. Pierre
could hear the thumping of his heart, or if his face gave betrayal of the
hot flood it was pumping through his body. "Bateese and I have pledged
ourselves. We shall fight, unless you tie one of us hand and foot. And as
for a wager&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what have you to wager?" demanded St. Pierre eagerly.</p>

<p>"You know the odds are great," temporized Carrigan.</p>

<p>"That I concede, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"But a fight without a wager would be like a pipe without tobacco, St.
Pierre."</p>

<p>"You speak truly, m'sieu."</p>

<p>David came nearer and laid a hand on the other's arm. "St. Pierre, I
hope you&mdash;and your Jeanne&mdash;will understand what I am about to
offer. It is this. If Bateese whips me, I will disappear into the
forests, and no word shall ever pass my lips of what has passed since
that hour behind the rock&mdash;and this. No whisper of it will ever
reach the Law. I will forget the attempted murder and the suspicious
mumblings of your Broken Man. You will be safe. Your Jeanne will be
safe&mdash;if Bateese whips me."</p>

<p>He paused, and waited. St. Pierre made no answer, but amazement came
into his face, and after that a slow and burning fire in his eyes which
told how deeply and vitally Carrigan's words had struck into his
soul.</p>

<p>"And if I should happen to win," continued David, turning a bit
carelessly toward the window, "why, I should expect as large a payment
from you. If I win, your fulfillment of the wager will be to tell me in
every detail why your wife tried to kill me behind the rock, and you will
also tell me all that you know about the man I am after, Black Roger
Audemard. That is all. I am asking for no odds, though you concede the
handicap is great."</p>

<p>He did not look at St. Pierre. Behind him he heard the other's deep
breathing. For a space neither spoke. Outside they could hear the soft
swish of water, the low voices of men in the stern, and a shout and the
barking of a dog coming from the raft far out on the river. For David the
moment was one of suspense. He turned again, a bit carelessly, as if his
proposition were a matter of but little significance to him. St. Pierre
was not looking at him. He was staring toward the door, as if through it
he could see the powerful form of Bateese bending over the stern sweep.
And Carrigan could see that his face was flaming with a great desire, and
that the blood in his body was pounding to the mighty urge of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he faced Carrigan.</p>

<p>"M'sieu, listen to me," he said. "You are a brave man. You are a man
of honor, and I know you will bury sacredly in your heart what I am going
to tell you now, and never let a word of it escape&mdash; even to my
Jeanne. I do not blame you for loving her. Non! You could not help that.
You have fought well to keep it within yourself, and for that I honor
you. How do I know? Mon Dieu, she has told me! A woman's heart
understands, and a woman's ears are quick to hear, m'sieu. When you were
sick, and your mind was wandering, you told her again and again that you
loved her&mdash;and when she brought you back to life, her eyes saw more
than once the truth of what your lips had betrayed, though you tried to
keep it to yourself. Even more, m'sieu&mdash;she felt the touch of your
lips on her hair that day. She understands. She has told me everything,
openly, innocently&mdash;yet her heart thrills with that sympathy of a
woman who knows she is loved. M'sieu, if you could have seen the light in
her eyes and the glow in her cheeks as she told me these secrets. But I
am not jealous! Non! It is only because you are a brave man, and one of
honor, that I tell you all this. She would die of shame did she know I
had betrayed her confidence. Yet it is necessary that I tell you, because
if we make the big wager we must drop my Jeanne from the gamble. Do you
comprehend me, m'sieu?</p>

<p>"We are two men, strong men, fighting men. I&mdash;Pierre
Boulain&mdash;can not feel the shame of jealousy where a woman's heart is
pure and sweet, and where a man has fought against love with honor as you
have fought. And you, m'sieu&mdash;David Carrigan, of the
Police&mdash;can not strike with your hard man's hand that tender heart,
that is like a flower, and which this moment is beating faster than it
should with the fear that some harm is going to befall you. Is it not so,
m'sieu? We will make the wager, yes. But if you whip Bateese&mdash;and
you can not do that in a hundred years of fighting&mdash;I will not tell
you why my Jeanne shot at you behind the rock. Non, never! Yet I swear I
will tell you the other. If you win, I will tell you all I know about
Roger Audemard, and that is considerable, m'sieu. Do you agree?"</p>

<p>Slowly David held out a hand. St. Pierre's gripped it. The fingers of
the two men met like bands of steel.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow you will fight," said St. Pierre. "You will fight and be
beaten so terribly that you may always show the marks of it. I am sorry.
Such a man as you I would rather have as a brother than an enemy. And she
will never forgive me. She will always remember it. The thought will
never die out of her heart that I was a beast to let you fight Bateese.
But it is best for all. And my men? Ah! Diable, but it will be great
sport for them, m'sieu!"</p>

<p>His hand unclasped. He turned to the door. A moment later it closed
behind him, and David was alone. He had not spoken. He had not replied to
the engulfing truths that had fallen quietly and without a betrayal of
passion from St. Pierre's lips. Inwardly he was crushed. Yet his face was
like stone, hiding his shame. And then, suddenly, there came a sound from
outside that sent the blood through his cold veins again. It was
laughter, the great, booming laughter of St. Pierre! It was not the
merriment of a man whose heart was bleeding, or into whose life had come
an unexpected pain or grief. It was wild and free, and filled with the
joy of the sun-filled day.</p>

<p>And David, listening to it, felt something that was more than
admiration for this man growing within him. And unconsciously his lips
repeated St. Pierre's words.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow&mdash;you will fight."</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_18">XVII</a></h3>

<p>For many minutes David stood at the bateau window and watched the
canoe that carried St. Pierre Boulain and the Broken Man back to the
raft. It moved slowly, as if St. Pierre was loitering with a purpose and
was thinking deeply of what had passed. Carrigan's fingers tightened, and
his face grew tense, as he gazed out into the glow of the western sun.
Now that the stress of nerve-breaking moments in the cabin was over, he
no longer made an effort to preserve the veneer of coolness and decision
with which he had encountered the chief of the Boulains. Deep in his soul
he was crushed and humiliated. Every nerve in his body was bleeding.</p>

<p>He had heard St. Pierre's big laugh a moment before, but it must have
been the laugh of a man who was stabbed to the heart. And he was going
back to Marie-Anne like that&mdash;drifting scarcely faster than the
current that he might steal time to strengthen himself before he looked
into her eyes again. David could see him, motionless, his giant shoulders
hunched forward a little, his head bowed, and in the stern the Broken Man
paddled listlessly, his eyes on the face of his master. Without voice
David cursed himself. In his egoism he had told himself that he had made
a splendid fight in resisting the temptation of a great love for the wife
of St. Pierre. But what was his own struggle compared with this tragedy
which St. Pierre was now facing?</p>

<p>He turned from the window and looked about the cabin room again&mdash;
the woman's room and St. Pierre's&mdash;and his face burned in its silent
accusation. Like a living thing it painted another picture for him. For a
space he lost his own identity. He saw himself in the place of St.
Pierre. He was the husband of Marie-Anne, worshipping her even as St.
Pierre must worship her, and he came, as St. Pierre had come, to find a
stranger in his home, a stranger who had lain in his bed, a stranger whom
his wife had nursed back to life, a stranger who had fallen in love with
his most inviolable possession, who had told her of his love, who had
kissed her, who had held her close, in his arms, whose presence had
brought a warmer flush and a brighter glow into eyes and cheeks that
until this stranger's coming had belonged only to him. And he heard her,
as St. Pierre had heard her, pleading with him to keep this man from
harm; he heard her soft voice, telling of the things that had passed
between them, and he saw in her eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>With almost a cry he swept the thought and the picture from him. It
was an atrocious thing to conceive, impossible of reality. And yet the
truth would not go. What would he have done in St. Pierre's place?</p>

<p>He went to the window again. Yes, St. Pierre was a bigger man than he.
For St. Pierre had come quietly and calmly, offering a hand of
friendship, generous, smiling, keeping his hurt to himself, while he,
Dave Carrigan, would have come with the murder of man in his heart.</p>

<p>His eyes passed from the canoe to the raft, and from the big raft to
the hazy billows of green and golden forest that melted off into
interminable miles of distance beyond the river. He knew that on the
other side of him lay that same distance, north, east, south, and west,
vast spaces in an unpeopled world, the same green and golden forests, ten
thousand plains and rivers and lakes, a million hiding-places where
romance and tragedy might remain forever undisturbed. The thought came to
him that it would not be difficult to slip out into that world and
disappear. He almost owed it to St. Pierre. It was the voice of Bateese
in a snatch of wild and discordant song that brought him back into grim
reality. There was, after all, that embarrassing matter of
justice&mdash;and the accursed Law!</p>

<p>After a little he observed that the canoe was moving faster, and that
Andre's paddle was working steadily and with force. St. Pierre no longer
sat hunched in the bow. His head was erect, and he was waving a hand in
the direction of the raft. A figure had come from the cabin on the huge
mass of floating timber. David caught the shimmer of a woman's dress,
something white fluttering over her head, waving back at St. Pierre. It
was Marie-Anne, and he moved away from the window.</p>

<p>He wondered what was passing between St. Pierre and his wife in the
hour that followed. The bateau kept abreast of the raft, moving neither
faster nor slower than it did, and twice he surrendered to the desire to
scan the deck of the floating timbers through his binoculars. But the
cabin held St. Pierre and Marie- Anne, and he saw neither of them again
until the sun was setting. Then St. Pierre came out&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Even at that distance over the broad river he heard the booming voice
of the chief of the Boulains. Life sprang up where there had been the
drowse of inactivity aboard the raft. A dozen more of the great sweeps
were swiftly manned by men who appeared suddenly from the shaded places
of canvas shelters and striped tents. A murmur of voices rose over the
water, and then the murmur was broken by howls and shouts as the rivermen
ran to their places at the command of St. Pierre's voice, and as the
sweeps began to flash in the setting sun, it gave way entirely to the
evening chant of the Paddling Song.</p>

<p>David gripped himself as he listened and watched the slowly drifting
glory of the world that came down to the shores of the river. He could
see St. Pierre clearly, for the bateau had worked its way nearer. He
could see the bare heads and naked arms of the rivermen at the sweeps.
The sweet breath of the forests filled his lungs, as that picture lay
before him, and there came into his soul a covetousness and a yearning
where before there had been humiliation and the grim urge of duty. He
could breathe the air of that world, he could look at its beauty, he
could worship it&mdash;and yet he knew that he was not a part of it as
those others were a part of it. He envied the men at the sweeps; he felt
his heart swelling at the exultation and joy in their song. They were
going home&mdash;home down the big rivers, home to the heart of God's
Country, where wives and sweethearts and happiness were waiting for them,
and their visions were his visions as he stared wide- eyed and motionless
over the river. And yet he was irrevocably an alien. He was more than
that&mdash;an enemy, a man-hound sent out on a trail to destroy, an agent
of a powerful and merciless force that carried with it punishment and
death.</p>

<p>The crew of the bateau had joined in the evening song of the rivermen
on the raft, and over the ridges and hollows of the forest tops, red and
green and gold in the last warm glory of the sun, echoed that chanting
voice of men. David understood now what St. Pierre's command had been.
The huge raft with its tented city of life was preparing to tie up for
the night. A quarter of a mile ahead the river widened, so that on the
far side was a low, clean shore toward which the efforts of the men at
the sweeps were slowly edging the raft. York boats shot out on the shore
side and dropped anchors that helped drag the big craft in. Two others
tugged at tow-lines fastened to the shoreside bow, and within twenty
minutes the first men were plunging up out of the water on the white
strip of beach and were whipping the tie-lines about the nearest trees.
David unconsciously was smiling in the thrill and triumph of these last
moments, and not until they were over did he sense the fact that Bateese
and his crew were bringing the bateau in to the opposite shore. Before
the sun was quite down, both raft and house-boat were anchored for the
night.</p>

<p>As the shadows of the distant forests deepened, Carrigan felt
impending about him an oppression of emptiness and loneliness which he
had not experienced before. He was disappointed that the bateau had not
tied up with the raft. Already he could see men building fires. Spirals
of smoke began to rise from the shore, and he knew that the riverman's
happiest of all hours, supper time, was close at hand. He looked at his
watch. It was after seven o'clock. Then he watched the fading away of the
sun until only the red glow of it remained in the west, and against the
still thicker shadows the fires of the rivermen threw up yellow flames.
On his own side, Bateese and the bateau crew were preparing their meal.
It was eight o'clock when a man he had not seen before brought in his
supper. He ate, scarcely sensing the taste of his food, and half an hour
later the man reappeared for the dishes.</p>

<p>It was not quite dark when he returned to his window, but the far
shore was only an indistinct blur of gloom. The fires were brighter. One
of them, built solely because of the rivermen's inherent love of light
and cheer, threw the blaze of its flaming logs twenty feet into the
air.</p>

<p>He wondered what Marie-Anne was doing in this hour. Last night they
had been together. He had marveled at the witchery of the moonlight in
her hair and eyes, he had told her of the beauty of it, she had smiled,
she had laughed softly with him&mdash;for hours they had sat in the spell
of the golden night and the glory of the river. And
tonight&mdash;now&mdash;was she with St. Pierre, waiting as they had
waited last night for the rising of the moon? Had she forgotten? COULD
she forget? Or was she, as he thought St. Pierre had painfully tried to
make him believe, innocent of all the thoughts and desires that had come
to him, as he sat worshipping her in their stolen hours? He could think
of them only as stolen, for he did not believe Marie-Anne had revealed to
her husband all she might have told him.</p>

<p>He was sure he would never see her again as he had seen her then, and
something of bitterness rose in him as he thought of that. St. Pierre,
could he have seen her face and eyes when he told her that her hair in
the moonlight was lovelier than anything he had ever seen, would have
throttled him with his naked hands in that meeting in the cabin. For St.
Pierre's code would not have had her eyes droop under their long lashes
or her cheeks flush so warmly at the words of another man&mdash;and he
could not take vengeance on the woman herself. No, she had not told St.
Pierre all she might have told! There were things which she must have
kept to herself, which she dared not reveal even to this great-hearted
man who was her husband. Shame, if nothing more, had kept her silent.</p>

<p>Did she feel that shame as he was feeling it? It was inconceivable to
think otherwise. And for that reason, more than all others, he knew that
she would not meet him face to face again&mdash;unless he forced that
meeting. And there was little chance of that, for his pledge with St.
Pierre had eliminated her from the aftermath of tomorrow's drama, his
fight with Bateese. Only when St. Pierre might stand in a court of law
would there be a possibility of her eyes meeting his own again, and then
they would flame with the hatred that at another time had been in the
eyes of Carmin Fanchet.</p>

<p>With the dull stab of a thing that of late had been growing inside
him, he wondered what had happened to Carmin Fanchet in the years that
had gone since he had brought about the hanging of her brother. Last
night and the night before, strange dreams of her had come to him in
restless slumber. It was disturbing to him that he should wake up in the
middle of the night dreaming of her, when he had gone to his bed with a
mind filled to overflowing with the sweet presence of Marie-Anne Boulain.
And now his mind reached out poignantly into mysterious darkness and
doubt, even as the darkness of night spread itself in a thickening canopy
over the river.</p>

<p>Gray clouds had followed the sun of a faultless day, and the stars
were veiled overhead. When David turned from the window, it was so dark
in the cabin that he could not see. He did not light the lamps, but made
his way to St. Pierre's couch and sat down in the silence and gloom.</p>

<p>Through the open windows came to him the cadence of the river and the
forests. There was silence of human voice ashore, but under him he heard
the lapping murmur of water as it rustled under the stern and side of the
bateau, and from the deep timber came the never-ceasing whisper of the
spruce and cedar tops, and the subdued voice of creatures whose hours of
activity had come with the dying out of the sun.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat in this darkness. And then there came to him a
sound that was different than the other sounds&mdash;a low monotone of
voices, the dipping of a paddle&mdash;and a canoe passed close under his
windows and up the shore. He paid small attention to it until, a little
later, the canoe returned, and its occupants boarded the bateau. It would
have roused little interest in him then had he not heard a voice that was
thrillingly like the voice of a woman.</p>

<p>He drew his hunched shoulders erect and stared through the darkness
toward the door. A moment more and there was no doubt. It was almost
shock that sent the blood leaping suddenly through his veins. The
inconceivable had happened. It was Marie-Anne out there, talking in a low
voice to Bateese!</p>

<p>Then there came a heavy knock at his door, and he heard the door open.
Through it he saw the grayer gloom of the outside night partly shut out a
heavy shadow.</p>

<p>"M'sieu!" called the voice of Bateese.</p>

<p>"I am here," said David.</p>

<p>"You have not gone to bed, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The heavy shadow seemed to fade away, and yet there still remained a
shadow there. David's heart thumped as he noted the slenderness of it.
For a space there was silence. And then,</p>

<p>"Will you light the lamps, M'sieu David?" a soft voice came to him. "I
want to come in, and I am afraid of this terrible darkness!"</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, fumbling in his pocket for matches.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_19">XVIII</a></h3>

<p>He did not turn toward Marie-Anne when he had lighted the first of the
great brass lamps hanging at the side of the bateau. He went to the
second, and struck another match, and flooded the cabin with light.</p>

<p>She still stood silhouetted against the darkness beyond the cabin door
when he faced her. She was watching him, her eyes intent, her face a
little pale, he thought. Then he smiled and nodded. He could not see a
great change in her since this afternoon, except that there seemed to be
a little more fire in the glow of her eyes. They were looking at him
steadily as she smiled and nodded, wide, beautiful eyes in which there
was surely no revelation of shame or regret, and no very clear evidence
of unhappiness. David stared, and his tongue clove to the roof of his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Why is it that you sit in darkness?" she asked, stepping within and
closing the door. "Did you not expect me to return and apologize for
leaving you so suddenly this afternoon? It was impolite. Afterward I was
ashamed. But I was excited, M'sieu David. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," he hurried to interrupt her. "I understand. St. Pierre is
a lucky man. I congratulate you&mdash;as well as him. He is splendid, a
man in whom you can place great faith and confidence."</p>

<p>"He scolded me for running away from you as I did, M'sieu David. He
said I should have shown better courtesy than to leave like that one who
was a guest in our&mdash;home. So I have returned, like a good child, to
make amends."</p>

<p>"It was not necessary."</p>

<p>"But you were lonesome and in darkness!"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes."</p>

<p>"And besides," she added, so quietly and calmly that he was amazed,
"you know my sleeping apartment is also on the bateau. And St. Pierre
made me promise to say good night to you."</p>

<p>"It is an imposition," cried David, the blood rushing to his face.
"You have given up all this to me! Why not let me go into that little
room forward, or sleep on the raft and you and St. Pierre&mdash; "</p>

<p>"St. Pierre would not leave the raft," replied Marie-Anne, turning
from him toward the table on which were the books and magazines and her
work-basket. "And I like my little room forward."</p>

<p>"St. Pierre&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped himself. He could see a sudden color deepening in the cheek
of St. Pierre's wife as she made pretense of looking for something in her
basket. He felt that if he went on he would blunder, if he had not
already blundered. He was uncomfortable, for he believed he had guessed
the truth. It was not quite reasonable to expect that Marie-Anne would
come to him like this on the first night of St. Pierre's homecoming.
Something had happened over in the little cabin on the raft, he told
himself. Perhaps there had been a quarrel&mdash;at least ironical
implications on St. Pierre's part. And his sympathy was with St.
Pierre.</p>

<p>He caught suddenly a little tremble at the corner of Marie-Anne's
mouth as her face was turned partly from him, and he stepped to the
opposite side of the table so he could look at her fairly. If there had
been unpleasantness in the cabin on the raft, St. Pierre's wife in no way
gave evidence of it. The color had deepened to almost a blush in her
cheeks, but it was not on account of embarrassment, for one who is
embarrassed is not usually amused, and as she looked up at him her eyes
were filled with the flash of laughter which he had caught her lips
struggling to restrain. Then, finding a bit of lace work with the needles
meshed in it, she seated herself, and again he was looking down on the
droop of her long lashes and the seductive glow of her lustrous hair.
Yesterday, in a moment of irresistible impulse, he had told her how
lovely it was as she had dressed it, a bewitching crown of interwoven
coils, not drawn tightly, but crumpled and soft, as if the mass of
tresses were openly rebelling at closer confinement. She had told him the
effect was entirely accidental, largely due to carelessness and haste in
dressing it. Accidental or otherwise, it was the same tonight, and in the
heart of it were the drooping red petals of a flower she had gathered
with him early that afternoon.</p>

<p>"St. Pierre brought me over," she said in a calmly matter-of-fact
voice, as though she had expected David to know that from the beginning.
"He is ashore talking over important matters with Bateese. I am sure he
will drop in and say good night before he returns to the raft. He asked
me to wait for him&mdash;here." She raised her eyes, so clear and
untroubled, so quietly unembarrassed under his gaze, that he would have
staked his life she had no suspicion of the confessions which St. Pierre
had revealed to him.</p>

<p>"Do you care? Would you rather put out the lights and go to bed?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No. I am glad. I was beastly lonesome. I had an
idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was on the point of blundering again when he caught himself. The
effect of her so near him was more than ever disturbing, in spite of St.
Pierre. Her eyes, clear and steady, yet soft as velvet when they looked
at him, made his tongue and his thoughts dangerously uncertain.</p>

<p>"You had an idea, M'sieu David?"</p>

<p>"That you would have no desire to see me again after my talk with St.
Pierre," he said. "Did he tell you about it?"</p>

<p>"He said you were very fine, M'sieu David&mdash;and that he liked
you."</p>

<p>"And he told you it is determined that I shall fight Bateese in the
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The one word was spoken with a quiet lack of excitement, even of
interest&mdash;it seemed to belie some of the things St. Pierre had told
him, and he could scarcely believe, looking at her now, that she had
entreated her husband to prevent the encounter, or that she had betrayed
any unusual emotion in the matter at all.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would object," he could not keep from saying. "It
does not seem nice to pull off such a thing as that, when there is a lady
about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or LADIES." She caught him up quickly, and he saw a sudden little
tightening of her pretty mouth as she turned her eyes to the bit of lace
work again. "But I do not object, because what St. Pierre says is
right&mdash;must be right."</p>

<p>And the softness, he thought, went altogether out of the curve of her
lips for an instant. In a flash their momentary betrayal of vexation was
gone, and St. Pierre's wife had replaced the work- basket on the table
and was on her feet, smiling at him. There was something of wild daring
in her eyes, something that made him think of the glory of adventure he
had seen flaming in her face the night they had run the rapids of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow will be very unpleasant, M'sieu David," she cried softly.
"Bateese will beat you&mdash;terribly. Tonight we must think of things
more agreeable."</p>

<p>He had never seen her more radiant than when she turned toward the
piano. What the deuce did it mean? Had St. Pierre been making a fool of
him? She actually appeared unable to restrain her elation at the thought
that Bateese would surely beat him up! He stood without moving and made
no effort to answer her. Just before they had started on that thrilling
adventure into the forest, which had ended with his carrying her in his
arms, she had gone to the piano and had played for him. Now her fingers
touched softly the same notes. A little humming trill came in her throat,
and it seemed to David that she was deliberately recalling his thoughts
to the things that had happened before the coming of St. Pierre. He had
not lighted the lamp over the piano, and for a flash her dark eyes smiled
at him out of the half shadow. After a moment she began to sing.</p>

<p>Her voice was low and without effort, untrained, and subdued as if
conscious and afraid of its limitations, yet so exquisitely sweet that to
David it was a new and still more wonderful revelation of St. Pierre's
wife. He drew nearer, until he stood close at her side, the dark luster
of her hair almost touching his arm, her partly upturned face a
bewitching profile in the shadows.</p>

<p>Her voice grew lower, almost a whisper in its melody, as if meant for
him alone. Many times he had heard the Canadian Boat Song, but never as
its words came now from the lips of Marie-Anne Boulain.</p>

<p>"Faintly as tolls the evening chime,<br>
 Our voices keep tune, and our oars keep time.<br>
 Soon as the woods on shore look dim,<br>
 We'll sing at St. Ann's our parting hymn;<br>
 Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,<br>
 The rapids are near, and the daylight's past."</p>

<p>She paused. And David, staring down at her shining head, did not
speak. Her fingers trembled over the keys, he could see dimly the shadow
of her long lashes, and the spirit-like scent of crushed violets rose to
him from the soft lace about her throat and her hair.</p>

<p>"It is your music," he whispered. "I have never heard the Boat Song
like that!"</p>

<p>He tried to drag his eyes from her face and hair, sensing that he was
a near-criminal, fighting a mighty impulse. The notes under her fingers
changed, and again&mdash;by chance or design&mdash;she was stabbing at
him; bringing him face to face with the weakness of his flesh, the
iniquity of his desire to reach out his arms and crumple her in them. Yet
she did not look up, she did not see him, as she began to sing "Ave
Maria."</p>

<p>"Ave, Maria, hear my cry!<br>
 O, guide my path where no harm, no harm is nigh&mdash;"</p>

<p>As she went on, he knew she had forgotten to think of him. With the
reverence of a prayer the holy words came from her lips, slowly, softly,
trembling with a pathos and sweetness that told David they came not alone
from the lips, but from the very soul of St, Pierre's wife. And
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, hear me where thou art,<br>
 And guard and guide my aching heart, my aching heart!"</p>

<p>The last words drifted away into a whisper, and David was glad that he
was not looking into the face of St. Pierre's wife, for there must have
been something there now which it would have been sacrilege for him to
stare at, as he was staring at her hair.</p>

<p>No sound of opening door had come from behind them. Yet St. Pierre had
opened it and stood there, watching them with a curious humor in eyes
that seemed still to hold a glitter of the fire that had leaped from the
half-breed's flaming birch logs. His voice was a shock to Carrigan.</p>

<p>"PESTE, but you are a gloomy pair!" he boomed. "Why no light over
there in the corner, and why sing that death-song to chase away the devil
when there is no devil near?"</p>

<p>Guilt was in David's heart, but there was no sting of venom in St.
Pierre's words, and he was laughing at them now, as though what he saw
were a pretty joke and amused him.</p>

<p>"Late hours and shady bowers! I say it should be a love song or
something livelier," he cried, closing the door behind him and coming
toward them. "Why not En Roulant ma Boule, my sweet Jeanne? You know that
is my favorite."</p>

<p>He suddenly interrupted himself, and his voice rolled out in a wild
chant that rocked the cabin.</p>

<p>"The wind is fresh, the wind is free,<br>
 En roulant ma boule!<br>
 The wind is fresh&mdash;my love waits me,<br>
 Rouli, roulant, ma boule roulant!<br>
 Behind our house a spring you see,<br>
 In it three ducks swim merrily,<br>
 And hunting, the Prince's son went he,<br>
 With a silver gun right fair to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>David was conscious that St. Pierre's wife had risen to her feet, and
now she came out of shadow into light, and he was amazed to see that she
was laughing back at St. Pierre, and that her two fore-fingers were
thrust in her ears to keep out the bellow of her husband's voice. She was
not at all discomfited by his unexpected appearance, but rather seemed to
join in the humor of the thing with St. Pierre, though he fancied he
could see something in her face that was forced and uneasy. He believed
that under the surface of her composure she was suffering a distress
which she did not reveal.</p>

<p>St. Pierre advanced and carelessly patted her shoulder with one of his
big hands, while he spoke to David.</p>

<p>"Has she not the sweetest voice in the world, m'sieu? Did you ever
hear a sweeter or as sweet? I say it is enough to get down into the soul
of a man, unless he is already half dead! That voice&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught Marie-Anne's eyes. Her cheeks were flaming. Her look, for an
instant, flashed lightning as she halted him.</p>

<p>"Ma foi, I speak it from the heart," he persisted, with a shrug of his
shoulders. "Am I not right, M'sieu Carrigan? Did you ever hear a sweeter
voice?"</p>

<p>"It is wonderful," agreed David, wondering if he was hazarding too
much.</p>

<p>"Good! It fills me with happiness to know I am right. And now, cherie,
good-night! I must return to the raft."</p>

<p>A shadow of vexation crossed Marie-Anne's face. "You seem in great
haste."</p>

<p>"Plagues and pests! You are right, Pretty Voice! I am most anxious to
get back to my troubles there, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will also bid M'sieu Carrigan good-night," she quickly interrupted
him. "You will at least see me to my room, St. Pierre, and safely put
away for the night."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to David. There was not a tremor in it as it lay
for an instant soft and warm in his own. She made no effort to withdraw
it quickly, nor did her eyes hide their softness as they looked into his
own.</p>

<p>Mutely David stood as they went out. He heard St. Pierre's loud voice
rumbling about the darkness of the night. He heard them pass along the
side of the bateau forward, and half a minute later he knew that St.
Pierre was getting into his canoe. The dip of a paddle came to him.</p>

<p>For a space there was silence, and then, from far out in the black
shadow of the river, rolled back the great voice of St. Pierre Boulain
singing the wild river chant, "En Roulant ma Boule."</p>

<p>At the open window he listened. It seemed to him that from far over
the river, where the giant raft lay, there came a faint answer to the
words of the song,</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_20">XIX</a></h3>

<p>With the slow approach of the storm which was advancing over the
wilderness, Carrigan felt more poignantly the growing unrest that was in
him. He heard the last of St. Pierre's voice, and after that the fires on
the distant shore died out slowly, giving way to utter blackness. Faintly
there came to him the far-away rumbling of thunder. The air grew heavy
and thick, and there was no sound of night-bird over the breast of the
river, and out of the thick cedar and spruce and balsam there came no cry
or whisper of the nocturnal life waiting in silence for the storm to
break. In that stillness David put out the lights in the cabin and sat
close to the window in darkness.</p>

<p>He was more than sleepless. Every nerve in his body demanded action,
and his brain was fired by strange thoughts until their vividness seemed
to bring him face to face with a reality that set his blood stirring with
an irresistible thrill. He believed he had made a discovery, that St.
Pierre had betrayed himself. What he had visioned, the conclusion he had
arrived at, seemed inconceivable, yet what his own eyes had seen and his
ears had heard pointed to the truth of it all. The least he could say was
that St. Pierre's love for Marie-Anne Boulain was a strange sort of love.
His attitude toward her seemed more like that of a man in the presence of
a child of whom he was fond in a fatherly sort of way. His affection, as
he had expressed it, was parental and careless. Not for an instant had
there been in it a betrayal of the lover, no suggestion of the husband
who cared deeply or who might be made jealous by another man.</p>

<p>Sitting in darkness thickening with the nearer approach of storm,
David recalled the stab of pain mingled with humiliation that had come
into the eyes of St. Pierre's wife when she had stood facing her husband.
He heard again, with a new understanding, the low note of pathos in her
voice as in song she had called upon the Mother of Christ to hear
her&mdash;and help her. He had not guessed at the tragedy of it then. Now
he knew, and he thought of her lying awake in the gloom beyond the
bulkhead, her eyes were with tears. And St. Pierre had gone back to his
raft, singing in the night! Where before there had been sympathy for him,
there rose a sincere revulsion. There had been a reason for St. Pierre's
masterly possession of himself, and it had not been, as he had thought,
because of his bigness of soul. It was because he had not cared. He was a
splendid hypocrite, playing his game well at the beginning, but betraying
the lie at the end. He did not love Marie-Anne as he, Dave Carrigan,
loved her. He had spoken of her as a child, and he had treated her as a
child, and was serenely dispassionate in the face of a situation which
would have roused the spirit in most men. And suddenly, recalling that
thrilling hour in the white strip of sand and all that had happened
since, it flashed upon David that St. Pierre was using his wife as the
vital moving force in a game of his own&mdash;that under the masquerade
of his apparent faith and bigness of character he was sacrificing her to
achieve a certain mysterious something it the scheme of his own
affairs.</p>

<p>Yet he could not forget the infinite faith Marie-Anne Boulain had
expressed in her husband. There had been no hypocrisy in her waiting and
her watching for him, or in her belief that he would straighten out the
tangles of the dilemma in which she had become involved. Nor had there
been make-believe in the manner she had left him that day in her
eagerness to go to St. Pierre. Adding these facts as he had added the
others, he fancied he saw the truth staring at him out of the darkness of
his cabin room. Marie- Anne loved her husband. And St. Pierre was merely
the possessor, careless and indifferent, almost brutally dispassionate in
his consideration of her.</p>

<p>A heavy crash of thunder brought Carrigan back to a realization of the
impending storm. He rose to his feet in the chaotic gloom, facing the
bulkhead beyond which he was certain St. Pierre's wife lay wide awake. He
tried to laugh. It was inexcusable, he told himself, to let his thoughts
become involved in the family affairs of St. Pierre and Marie-Anne. That
was not his business. Marie- Anne, in the final analysis, did not appear
to be especially abused, and her mind was not a child's mind. Probably
she would not thank him for his interest in the matter. She would tell
him, like any other woman with pride, that it was none of his business
and that he was presuming upon forbidden ground.</p>

<p>He went to the window. There was scarcely a breath of air, and
unfastening the screen, he thrust out his head and shoulders into the
night. It was so black that he could not see the shadow of the water
almost within reach of his hands, but through the chaos of gloom that lay
between him and the opposite shore he made out a single point of yellow
light. He was positive the light was in the cabin on the raft. And St.
Pierre was probably in that cabin.</p>

<p>A huge drop of rain splashed on his hand, and behind him he heard
sweeping over the forest tops the quickening march of the deluge. There
was no crash of thunder or flash of lightning when it broke. Straight
down, in an inundation, it came out of a sky thick enough to slit with a
knife. Carrigan drew in his head and shoulders and sniffed the sweet
freshness of it. He tried again to make out the light on the raft, but it
was obliterated.</p>

<p>Mechanically he began taking off his clothes, and in a few moments he
stood again at the window, naked. Thunder and lightning had caught up
with the rain, and in the flashes of fire Carrigan's ghost-white face
stared in the direction of the raft. In his veins was at work an
insistent and impelling desire. Over there was St. Pierre, he was
undoubtedly in the cabin, and something might happen if he, Dave
Carrigan, took advantage of storm and gloom to go to the raft.</p>

<p>It was almost a presentiment that drew his bare head and shoulders out
through the window, and every hunting instinct in him urged him to the
adventure. The stygian darkness was torn again by a flash of fire. In it
he saw the river and the vivid silhouette of the distant shore. It would
not be a difficult swim, and it would be good training for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Like a badger worming his way out of a hole a bit too small for him,
Carrigan drew himself through the window. A lightning flash caught him at
the edge of the bateau, and he slunk back quickly against the cabin, with
the thought that other eyes might be staring out into that same darkness.
In the pitch gloom that followed he lowered himself quietly into the
river, thrust himself under water, and struck out for the opposite
shore.</p>

<p>When he came to the surface again it was in the glare of another
lightning flash. He flung the water from his face, chose a point several
hundred yards above the raft, and with quick, powerful strokes set out in
its direction. For ten minutes he quartered the current without raising
his head. Then he paused, floating unresistingly with the slow sweep of
the river, and waited for another illumination. When it came, he made out
the tented raft scarcely a hundred yards away and a little below him. In
the next darkness he found the edge of it and dragged himself up on the
mass of timbers.</p>

<p>The thunder had been rolling steadily westward, and David crouched
low, hoping for one more flash to illumine the raft. It came at last from
a mass of inky cloud far to the west, so indistinct that it made only dim
shadows out of the tents and shelters, but it was sufficient to give him
direction. Before its faint glare died out, he saw the deeper shadow of
the cabin forward.</p>

<p>For many minutes he lay where he had dragged himself, without making a
movement in its direction. Nowhere about him could he see a sign of
light, nor could he hear any sound of life. St. Pierre's people were
evidently deep in slumber.</p>

<p>Carrigan had no very definite idea of the next step in his adventure.
He had swum from the bateau largely under impulse, with no preconceived
scheme of action, urged chiefly by the hope that he would find St. Pierre
in the cabin and that something might come of it. As for knocking at the
door and rousing the chief of the Boulains from sleep&mdash;he had at the
present moment no very good excuse for that. No sooner had the thought
and its objection come to him than a broad shaft of light shot with
startling suddenness athwart the blackness of the raft, darkened in
another instant by an obscuring shadow. Swift as the light itself David's
eyes turned to the source of the unexpected illumination. The door of St.
Pierre's cabin was wide open. The interior was flooded with lampglow, and
in the doorway stood St. Pierre himself.</p>

<p>The chief of the Boulains seemed to be measuring the weather
possibilities of the night. His subdued voice reached David, chuckling
with satisfaction, as he spoke to some one who was behind him in the
cabin.</p>

<p>"Pitch and brimstone, but it's black!" he cried. "You could carve it
with a knife, and stand it on end, AMANTE. But it's going west. In a few
hours the stars will be out."</p>

<p>He drew back into the cabin, and the door closed. David held his
breath in amazement, staring at the blackness where a moment before the
light had been. Who was it St. Pierre had called sweetheart? AMANTE! He
could not have been mistaken. The word had come to him clearly, and there
was but one guess to make. Marie- Anne was not on the bateau. She had
played him for a fool, had completely hoodwinked him in her plot with St.
Pierre. They were cleverer than he had supposed, and in darkness she had
rejoined her husband on the raft! But why that senseless play of
falsehood? What could be their object in wanting him to believe she was
still aboard the bateau?</p>

<p>He stood up on his feet and mopped the warm rain from his face, while
the gloom hid the grim smile that came slowly to his lips. Close upon the
thrill of his astonishment he felt a new stir in his blood which added
impetus to his determination and his action. He was not disgusted with
himself, nor was he embittered by what he had thought of a moment ago as
the lying hypocrisy of his captors. To be beaten in his game of
man-hunting was sometimes to be expected, and Carrigan always gave proper
credit to the winners. It was also "good medicine" to know that
Marie-Anne, instead of being an unhappy and neglected wife, had blinded
him with an exquisitely clever simulation. Just why she had done it, and
why St. Pierre had played his masquerade, it was his duty now to find
out.</p>

<p>An hour ago he would have cut off a hand before spying upon St.
Pierre's wife or eavesdropping under her window. Now he felt no
uneasiness of conscience as he approached the cabin, for Marie- Anne
herself had destroyed all reason for any delicate discrimination on his
part.</p>

<p>The rain had almost stopped, and in one of the near tents he heard a
sleepy voice. But he had no fear of chance discovery. The night would
remain dark for a long time, and in his bare feet he made no sound the
sharpest ears of a dog ten feet away might have heard. Close to the cabin
door, yet in such a way that the sudden opening of it would not reveal
him, he paused and listened.</p>

<p>Distinctly he heard St. Pierre's voice, but not the words. A moment
later came the soft, joyous laughter of a woman, and for an instant a
hand seemed to grip David's heart, filling it with pain. There was no
unhappiness in that laughter. It seemed, instead, to tremble in an
exultation of gladness.</p>

<p>Suddenly St. Pierre came nearer the door, and his voice was more
distinct. "Chere-coeur, I tell you it is the greatest joke of my life,"
he heard him say. "We are safe. If it should come to the worst, we can
settle the matter in another way. I can not but sing and laugh, even in
the face of it all. And she, in that very innocence which amuses me so,
has no suspicion&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned, and vainly David keyed his ears to catch the final words.
The voices in the cabin grew lower. Twice he heard the soft laughter of
the woman. St. Pierre's voice, when he spoke, was unintelligible.</p>

<p>The thought that his random adventure was bringing him to an important
discovery possessed Carrigan. St. Pierre, he believed, had been on the
very edge of disclosing something which he would have given a great deal
to know. Surely in this cabin there must be a window, and the window
would be open&mdash;</p>

<p>Quietly he felt his way through the darkness to the shore side of the
cabin. A narrow bar of light at least partly confirmed his judgment.
There was a window. But it was almost entirely curtained, and it was
closed. Had the curtain been drawn two inches lower, the thin stream of
light would have been shut entirely out from the night.</p>

<p>Under this window David crouched for several minutes, hoping that in
the calm which was succeeding the storm it might be opened. The voices
were still more indistinct inside. He scarcely heard St. Pierre, but
twice again he heard the low and musical laughter of the woman. She had
laughed differently with HIM&mdash;and the grim smile settled on his lips
as he looked up at the narrow slit of light over his head. He had an
overwhelming desire to look in. After all, it was a matter of
professional business&mdash;and his duty.</p>

<p>He was glad the curtain was drawn so low. From experiments of his own
he knew there was small chance of those inside seeing him through the
two-inch slit, and he raised himself boldly until his eyes were on a
level with the aperture.</p>

<p>Directly in the line of his vision was St. Pierre's wife. She was
seated, and her back was toward him, so he could not see her face. She
was partly disrobed, and her hair was streaming loose about her. Once, he
remembered, she had spoken of fiery lights that came into her hair under
certain illumination. He had seen them in the sun, but never as they
revealed themselves now in that cabin lamp glow. He scarcely looked at
St. Pierre, who was on his feet, looking down upon her&mdash;not until
St. Pierre reached out and crumpled the smothering mass of glowing
tresses in his big hands, and laughed. It was a laugh filled with the
unutterable joy of possession. The woman rose to her feet. Up through her
hair went her two white, bare arms, encircling St. Pierre's neck. The
giant drew her close. Her slim form seemed to melt in his, and their lips
met.</p>

<p>And then the woman threw back her head, laughing, so that her glory of
hair fell straight down, and she was out of reach of St. Pierre's lips.
They turned. Her face fronted the window, and out in the night Carrigan
stifled a cry that almost broke from his lips. For a flash he was looking
straight into her eyes. Her parted lips seemed smiling at him; her white
throat and bosom were bared to him. He dropped down, his heart choking
him as he stumbled through the darkness to the edge of the raft. There,
with the lap of the water at his feet, he paused. It was hard for him to
get Breath. He stared through the gloom in the direction of the bateau.
Marie-Anne Boulain, the woman he loved, was there! In her little cabin,
alone, on the bateau, was St. Pierre's wife, her heart crushed.</p>

<p>And in this cabin on the raft, forgetful of her degradation and her
grief, was the vilest wretch he had ever known&mdash;St. Pierre Boulain.
And with him, giving herself into his arms, caressing him with her lips
and hair, was the sister of the man he had helped to hang&mdash;CARMIN
FANCHET!</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_21">XX</a></h3>

<p>The shock of the amazing discovery which Carrigan had made was as
complete as it was unexpected. His eyes had looked upon the last thing in
the world he might have guessed at or anticipated when they beheld
through the window of St. Pierre's cabin the beautiful face and partly
disrobed figure of Carmin Fanchet. The first effect of that shock had
been to drive him away. His action had been involuntary, almost without
the benefit of reason, as if Carmin had been Marie-Anne herself receiving
the caresses which were rightfully hers, and upon which it was both
insult and dishonor for him to spy. He realized now that he had made a
mistake in leaving the window too quickly.</p>

<p>But he did not move back through the gloom, for there was something
too revolting in what he had seen, and with the revulsion of it a swift
understanding of the truth which made his hands clench as he sat down on
the edge of the raft with his feet and legs submerged in the slow-moving
current of the river. The thing was not uncommon. It was the same
monstrous story, as old as the river itself, but in this instance it
filled him with a sickening sort of horror which gripped him at first
even more than the strangeness of the fact that Carmin Fanchet was the
other woman. His vision and his soul were reaching out to the bateau
lying in darkness on the far side of the river, where St. Pierre's wife
was alone in her unhappiness. His first impulse was to fling himself in
the river and race to her&mdash;his second, to go back to St. Pierre,
even in his nakedness, and call him forth to a reckoning. In his
profession of man-hunting he had never had the misfortune to kill, but he
could kill St. Pierre&mdash;now. His fingers dug into the slippery wood
of the log under him, his blood ran hot, and in his eyes blazed the fury
of an animal as he stared into the wall of gloom between him and
Marie-Anne Boulain.</p>

<p>How much did she know? That was the first question which pounded in
his brain. He suddenly recalled his reference to the fight, his apology
to Marie-Anne that it should happen so near to her presence, and he saw
again the queer little twist of her mouth as she let slip the hint that
she was not the only one of her sex who would know of tomorrow's fight.
He had not noticed the significance of it then. But now it struck home.
Marie-Anne was surely aware of Carmin Fanchet's presence on the raft.</p>

<p>But did she know more than that? Did she know the truth, or was her
heart filled only with suspicion and fear, aggravated by St. Pierre's
neglect and his too-apparent haste to return to the raft that night?
Again David's mind flashed back, recalling her defense of Carmin Fanchet
when he had first told her his story of the woman whose brother he had
brought to the hangman's justice. There could be but one conclusion.
Marie-Anne knew Carmin Fanchet, and she also knew she was on the raft
with St. Pierre.</p>

<p>As cooler judgment returned to him, Carrigan refused to concede more
than that. For any one of a dozen reasons Carmin Fanchet might be on the
raft going down the river, and it was also quite within reason that
Marie-Anne might have some apprehension of a woman as beautiful as
Carmin, and possibly intuition had begun to impinge upon her a disturbing
fear of a something that might happen. But until tonight he was confident
she had fought against this suspicion, and had overridden it, even though
she knew a woman more beautiful than herself was slowly drifting down the
stream with her husband. She had betrayed no anxiety to him in the days
that had passed; she had waited eagerly for St. Pierre; like a bird she
had gone to him when at last he came, and he had seen her crushed close
in St. Pierre's arms in their meeting. It was this night, with its gloom
and its storm, that had made the shadowings of her unrest a torturing
reality. For St. Pierre had brought her back to the bateau and had played
a pitiably weak part in concealing his desire to return to the raft.</p>

<p>So he told himself Marie-Anne did not know the truth, not as he had
seen it through the window of St. Pierre's cabin. She had been hurt, for
he had seen the sting of it, and in that same instant he had seen her
soul rise up and triumph. He saw again the sudden fire that came into her
eyes when St. Pierre urged the necessity of his haste, he saw her slim
body grow tense, her red lips curve in a flash of pride and disdain. And
as Carrigan thought of her in that way his muscles grew tighter, and he
cursed St. Pierre. Marie-Anne might be hurt, she might guess that her
husband's eyes and thoughts were too frequently upon another's
face&mdash;but in the glory of her womanhood it was impossible for her to
conceive of a crime such as he had witnessed through the cabin window. Of
that he was sure.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, like a blinding sheet of lightning out of a dark
sky, came back to him all that St. Pierre had said about Marie-Anne. He
had pitied St. Pierre then; he had pitied this great cool-eyed giant of a
man who was fighting gloriously, he had thought, in the face of a
situation that would have excited most men. Frankly St. Pierre had told
him Marie-Anne cared more for him than she should. With equal frankness
he had revealed his wife's confessions to him, that she knew of his love
for her, of his kiss upon her hair.</p>

<p>In the blackness Carrigan's face burned hot. If he had in him the
desire to kill St. Pierre now, might not St. Pierre have had an equally
just desire to kill him? For he had known, even as he kissed her hair,
and as his arms held her close to his breast in crossing the creek, that
she was the wife of St. Pierre. And Marie-Anne&mdash;</p>

<p>His muscles relaxed. Slowly he lowered himself into the cool wash of
the river, and struck out toward the bateau. He did not breast the
current with the same fierce determination with which he had crossed
through the storm to the raft, but drifted with it and reached the
opposite shore a quarter of a mile below the bateau. Here he waited for a
time, while the thickness of the clouds broke, and a gray light came
through them, revealing dimly the narrow path of pebbly wash along the
shore. Silently, a stark naked shadow in the night, he came back to the
bateau and crawled through his window.</p>

<p>He lighted a lamp, and turned it very low, and in the dim glow of it
rubbed his muscles until they burned. He was fit for tomorrow, and the
knowledge of that fitness filled him with a savage elation. A
good-humored love of sport had induced him to fling his first
half-bantering challenge into the face of Concombre Bateese, but that
sentiment was gone. The approaching fight was no longer an incident, a
foolish error into which he had unwittingly plunged himself. In this hour
it was the biggest physical thing that had ever loomed up in his life,
and he yearned for the dawn with the eagerness of a beast that waits for
the kill which comes with the break of day. But it was not the
half-breed's face he saw under the hammering of his blows. He could not
hate the half-breed. He could not even dislike him now. He forced himself
to bed, and later he slept. In the dream that came to him it was not
Bateese who faced him in battle, but St. Pierre Boulain.</p>

<p>He awoke with that dream a thing of fire in his brain. The sun was not
yet up, but the flush of it was painting the east, and he dressed quietly
and carefully, listening for some sound of awakening beyond the bulkhead.
If Marie-Anne was awake, she was very still. There was noise ashore.
Across the river he could hear the singing of men, and through his window
saw the white smoke of early fires rising above the tree-tops. It was the
Indian who unlocked the door and brought in his breakfast, and it was the
Indian who returned for the dishes half an hour later.</p>

<p>After that Carrigan waited, tense with the desire for action to begin.
He sensed no premonition of evil about to befall him. Every nerve and
sinew in his body was alive for the combat. He thrilled with an
overwhelming confidence, a conviction of his ability to win, an almost
dangerous, self-conviction of approaching triumph in spite of the odds in
weight and brute strength which were pitted against him. A dozen times he
listened at the bulkhead between him and Marie-Anne, and still he heard
no movement on the other side.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock when one of the bateau men appeared at the door
and asked if he was ready. Quickly David joined him. He forgot his taunts
to Concombre Bateese, forgot the softly padded gloves in his pack with
which he had promised to pommel the half- breed into oblivion. He was
thinking only of naked fists.</p>

<p>Into a canoe he followed the bateau man, who turned his craft swiftly
in the direction of the opposite shore. And as they went, David was sure
he caught the slight movement of a curtain at the little window of
Marie-Anne's forward cabin. He smiled back and raised his hand, and at
that the curtain was drawn back entirely, and he knew that St. Pierre's
wife was watching him as he went to the fight.</p>

<p>The raft was deserted, but a little below it, on a wide strip of beach
made hard and smooth by flood water, had gathered a crowd of men. It
seemed odd to David they should remain so quiet, when he knew the natural
instinct of the riverman was to voice his emotion at the top of his
lungs. He spoke of this to the bateau man, who shrugged his shoulders and
grinned.</p>

<p>"Eet ees ze command of St. Pierre," he explained. "St. Pierre say no
man make beeg noise at&mdash;what you call heem&mdash;funeral? An' theese
goin' to be wan gran' fun-e-RAL, m'sieu!"</p>

<p>"I see," David nodded. He did not grin back at the other's humor.</p>

<p>He was looking at the crowd. A giant figure had appeared out of the
center of it and was coming slowly down to the river. It was St. Pierre.
Scarcely had the prow of the canoe touched shore when David leaped out
and hurried to meet him. Behind St. Pierre came Bateese, the half-breed.
He was stripped to the waist and naked from the knees down. His
gorilla-like arms hung huge and loose at his sides, and the muscles of
his hulking body stood out like carven mahogany in the glisten of the
morning sun. He was like a grizzly, a human beast of monstrous power,
something to look at, to back away from, to fear.</p>

<p>Yet, David scarcely noticed him. He met St. Pierre, faced him, and
stopped&mdash;and he had gone swiftly to this meeting, so that the chief
of the Boulains was within earshot of all his men.</p>

<p>St. Pierre was smiling. He held out his hand as he had held it out
once before in the bateau cabin, and his big voice boomed out a
greeting.</p>

<p>Carrigan did not answer, nor did he look at the extended hand. For an
instant the eyes of the two men met, and then, swift as lightning,
Carrigan's arm shot out, and with the flat of his hand he struck St.
Pierre a terrific blow squarely on the cheek. The sound of the blow was
like the smash of a paddle on smooth water. Not a riverman but heard it,
and as St. Pierre staggered back, flung almost from his feet by its
force, a subdued cry of amazement broke from the waiting men. Concombre
Bateese stood like one stupefied. And then, in another flash, St. Pierre
had caught himself and whirled like a wild beast. Every muscle in his
body was drawn for a gigantic, overwhelming leap; his eyes blazed; the
fury of a beast was in his face. Before all his people he had suffered
the deadliest insult that could be offered a man of the Three River
Country&mdash;a blow struck with the flat of another's hand. Anything
else one might forgive, but not that. Such a blow, if not avenged, was a
brand that passed down into the second and third generations, and even
children would call out "Yellow-Back&mdash; Yellow-Back," to the one who
was coward enough to receive it without resentment. A rumbling growl rose
in the throat of Concombre Bateese in that moment when it seemed as
though St. Pierre Boulain was about to kill the man who had struck him.
He saw the promise of his own fight gone in a flash. For no man in all
the northland could now fight David Carrigan ahead of St. Pierre.</p>

<p>David waited, prepared to meet the rush of a madman. And then, for a
second time, he saw a mighty struggle in the soul of St. Pierre. The
giant held himself back. The fury died out of his face, but his great
hands remained clenched as he said, for David alone,</p>

<p>"That was a playful blow, m'sieu? It was&mdash;a joke?"</p>

<p>"It was for you, St. Pierre," replied Carrigan, "You are a coward
&mdash;and a skunk. I swam to the raft last night, looked through your
window, and saw what happened there. You are not fit for a decent man to
fight, yet I will fight you, if you are not too great a coward&mdash;and
dare to let our wagers stand as they were made."</p>

<p>St. Pierre's eyes widened, and for a breath or two he stared at
Carrigan, as if looking into him and not at him. His big hands relaxed,
and slowly the panther-like readiness went out of his body. Those who
looked beheld the transformation in amazement, for of all who waited only
St. Pierre and the half-breed had heard Carrigan's words, though they had
seen and heard the blow of insult.</p>

<p>"You swam to the raft," repeated St. Pierre in a low voice, as if
doubting what he had heard. "You looked through the window&mdash;and
saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>David nodded. He could not cover the sneering poison in his voice, his
contempt for the man who stood before him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I looked through the window. And I saw you, and the lowest woman
on the Three Rivers&mdash;the sister of a man I helped to hang,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"STOP!"</p>

<p>St. Pierre's voice broke out of him like the sudden crash of thunder.
He came a step nearer, his face livid, his eyes shooting flame. With a
mighty effort he controlled himself again. And then, as if he saw
something which David could not see, he tried to smile, and in that same
instant David caught a grin cutting a great slash across the face of
Concombre Bateese. The change that came over St. Pierre now was swift as
sunlight coming out from shadowing cloud. A rumble grew in his great
chest. It broke in a low note of laughter from his lips, and he faced the
bateau across the river.</p>

<p>"M'sieu, you are sorry for HER. Is that it? You would
fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the cleanest, finest little girl who ever lived&mdash;your
wife!"</p>

<p>"It is funny," said St. Pierre, as if speaking to himself, and still
looking at the bateau. "Yes, it is very funny, ma belle Marie-Anne! He
has told you he loves you, and he has kissed your hair and held you in
his arms&mdash;yet he wants to fight me because he thinks I am steeped in
sin, and to make me fight in place of Bateese he has called my Carmin a
low woman! So what else can I do? I must fight. I must whip him until he
can not walk. And then I will send him back for you to nurse, cherie, and
for that blessing I think he will willingly take my punishment! Is it not
so, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>He was smiling and no longer excited when he turned to David.</p>

<p>"M'sieu, I will fight you. And the wagers shall stand. And in this
hour let us be honest, like men, and make confession. You love ma belle
Jeanne&mdash;Marie-Anne? Is it not so? And I&mdash;I love my Carmin,
whose brother you hanged, as I love no other woman in the world. Now, if
you will have it so, let us fight!"</p>

<p>He began stripping off his shirt, and with a bellow in his throat
Concombre Bateese slouched away like a beaten gorilla to explain to St.
Pierre's people the change in the plan of battle. And as that news spread
like fire in the fir-tops, there came but a single cry in
response&mdash;shrill and terrible&mdash;and that was from the throat of
Andre, the Broken Man.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_22">XXI</a></h3>

<p>As Carrigan stripped off his shirt, he knew that at least in one way
he had met more than his match in St. Pierre Boulain. In the splendid
service of which he was a part he had known many men of iron and steel,
men whose nerve and coolness not even death could very greatly disturb.
Yet St. Pierre, he conceded, was their master&mdash;and his own. For a
flash he had transformed the chief of the Boulains into a volcano which
had threatened to break in savage fury, yet neither the crash nor
destruction had come. And now St. Pierre was smiling again, as Carrigan
faced him, stripped to the waist. He betrayed no sign of the tempest of
passion that had swept him a few minutes before. His cool, steely eyes
had in them a look that was positively friendly, as Concombre Bateese
marked in the hard sand the line of the circle within which no man might
come. And as he did this and St. Pierre's people crowded close about it,
St. Pierre himself spoke in a low voice to David.</p>

<p>"M'sieu, it seems a shame that we should fight. I like you. I have
always loved a man who would fight to protect a woman, and I shall be
careful not to hurt you more than is necessary to make you see
reason&mdash;and to win the wagers. So you need not be afraid of my
killing you, as Bateese might have done. And I promise not to destroy
your beauty, for the sake of&mdash;the lady in the bateau. My Carmin, if
she knew you spied through her window last night, would say kill you with
as little loss of time as possible, for as regards you her sweet
disposition was spoiled when you hung her brother, m'sieu. Yet to me she
is an angel!"</p>

<p>Contempt for the man who spoke of his wife and the infamous Carmin
Fanchet in the same breath drew a sneer to Carrigan's lips. He nodded
toward the waiting circle of men.</p>

<p>"They are ready for the show, St. Pierre. You talk big. Now let us see
if you can fight."</p>

<p>For another moment St. Pierre hesitated. "I am so sorry,
m'sieu&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you ready, St. Pierre?"</p>

<p>"It is not fair, and she will never forgive me. You are no match for
me. I am half again as heavy."</p>

<p>"And as big a coward as you are a scoundrel, St. Pierre."</p>

<p>"It is like a man fighting a boy."</p>

<p>"Yet it is less dishonorable than betraying the woman who is your wife
for another who should have been hanged along with her brother, St.
Pierre."</p>

<p>Boulain's face darkened. He drew back half a dozen steps and cried out
a word to Bateese. Instantly the circle of waiting men grew tense as the
half-breed jerked the big handkerchief from his head and held it out at
arm's length. Yet, with that eagerness for the fight there was something
else which Carrigan was swift to sense. The attitude of the watchers was
not one of uncertainty or of very great expectation, in spite of the
staring faces and the muscular tightening of the line. He knew what was
passing in their minds and in the low whispers from lip to lip. They were
pitying him. Now that he stood stripped, with only a few paces between
him and the giant figure of St. Pierre, the unfairness of the fight
struck home even to Concombre Bateese. Only Carrigan himself knew how
like tempered steel the sinews of his body were built. But to the eye, in
size alone, he stood like a boy before St. Pierre. And St. Pierre's
people, their voices stilled by the deadly inequality of it, were waiting
for a slaughter and not a fight.</p>

<p>A smile came to Carrigan's lips as he saw Bateese hesitating to drop
the handkerchief, and with the swiftness of the trained fighter he made
his first plan for the battle before the cloth fell from the half-breed's
fingers, As the handkerchief fluttered to the ground, he faced St.
Pierre, the smile gone.</p>

<p>"Never smile when you fight," the greatest of all masters of the ring
had told him. "Never show anger, Don't betray any emotion at all if you
can help it."</p>

<p>Carrigan wondered what the old ring-master would say could he see him
now, backing away slowly from St. Pierre as the giant advanced upon him,
for he knew his face was betraying to St. Pierre and his people the
deadliest of all sins&mdash;anxiety and indecision. Very closely, yet
with eyes that seemed to shift uneasily, he watched the effect of his
trick on Boulain. Twice the huge riverman followed him about the ring of
sand, and the steely glitter in his eyes changed to laughter, and the
tense faces of the men about them relaxed. A subdued ripple of merriment
rose where there had been silence. A third time David maneuvered his
retreat, and his eyes shot furtively to Concombre Bateese and the men at
his back. They were grinning. The half-breed's mouth was wide open, and
his grotesque body hung limp and astonished. This was not a fight! It was
a comedy&mdash;like a rooster following a sparrow around a barnyard! And
then a still funnier thing happened, for David began to trot in a circle
around St. Pierre, dodging and feinting, and keeping always at a safe
distance. A howl of laughter came from Bateese and broke in a roar from
the men. St. Pierre stopped in his tracks, a grin on his face, his big
arms and shoulders limp and unprepared as Carrigan dodged in close and
out again. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>A howl broke in the middle of the half-breed's throat. Where there had
been laughter, there came a sudden shutting off of sound, a great gasp,
as if made by choking men. Swifter than anything they had ever seen in
human action Carrigan had leaped in. They saw him strike. They heard the
blow. They saw St. Pierre's great head rock back, as if struck from his
shoulders by a club, and they saw and heard another blow, and a
third&mdash;like so many flashes of lightning&mdash;and St. Pierre went
down as if shot. The man they had laughed at was no longer like a hopping
sparrow. He was waiting, bent a little forward, every muscle in his body
ready for action. They watched for him to leap upon his fallen enemy,
kicking and gouging and choking in the riverman way. But David waited,
and St. Pierre staggered to his feet. His mouth was bleeding and choked
with sand, and a great lump was beginning to swell over his eye. A deadly
fire blazed in his face, as he rushed like a mad bull at the
insignificant opponent who had tricked and humiliated him. This time
Carrigan did not retreat, but held his ground, and a yell of joy went up
from Bateese as the mighty bulk of the giant descended upon his victim.
It was an avalanche of brute-force, crushing in its destructiveness, and
Carrigan seemed to reach for it as it came upon him. Then his head went
down, swifter than a diving grebe, and as St. Pierre's arm swung like an
oaken beam over his shoulder, his own shot in straight for the pit of the
other's stomach. It was a bull's-eye blow with the force of a pile-driver
behind it, and the groan that forced its way out of St. Pierre's vitals
was heard by every ear in the cordon of watchers. His weight stopped, his
arms opened, and through that opening Carrigan's fist went a second time
to the other's jaw, and a second time the great St. Pierre Boulain
sprawled out upon the sand. And there he lay, and made no effort to
rise.</p>

<p>Concombre Bateese, with his great mouth agape, stood for an instant as
if the blow had stunned him in place of his master. Then, suddenly he
came to life, and leaped to David's side.</p>

<p>"Diable! Tonnerre! You have not fight Concombre Bateese yet!" he
howled. "Non, you have cheat me, you have lie, you have run lak cat from
Concombre Bateese, ze stronges' man on all T'ree River! You are wan'
gran' coward, wan poltroon, an' you 'fraid to fight ME, who ees greates'
fightin' man in all dees countree! Sapristi! Why you no hit Concombre
Bateese, m'sieu? Why you no hit ze greates' fightin' man w'at
ees&mdash;"</p>

<p>David did not hear the rest. The opportunity was too tempting. He
swung, and with a huge grunt the gorilla-like body of Concombre Bateese
rolled over that of the chief of the Boulains. This time Carrigan did not
wait, but followed up so closely that the half- breed had scarcely
gathered the crook out of his knees when another blow on the jaw sent him
into the sand again. Three times he tried the experiment of regaining his
feet, and three times he was knocked down. After the last blow he raised
himself groggily to a sitting posture, and there he remained, blinking
like a stunned pig, with his big hands clutching in the sand. He stared
up unseeingly at Carrigan, who waited over him, and then stupidly at the
transfixed cordon of men, whose eyes were bulging and who were holding
their breath in the astonishment of this miracle which had descended upon
them. They heard Bateese muttering something incoherent as his head
wobbled, and St. Pierre himself seemed to hear it, for he stirred and
raised himself slowly, until he also was sitting in the sand, staring at
Bateese.</p>

<p>Carrigan picked up his shirt, and the riverman who had brought him
from the bateau returned with him to the canoe. There was no
demonstration behind them. To David himself the whole thing had been an
amazing surprise, and he was not at all reluctant to leave as quickly as
his dignity would permit, before some other of St. Pierre's people
offered to put a further test upon his prowess. He wanted to laugh. He
wanted to thank God at the top of his voice for the absurd run of luck
that had made his triumph not only easy but utterly complete. He had
expected to win, but he had also expected a terrific fight before the
last blow was struck. And there had been no fight! He was returning to
the bateau without a scratch, his hair scarcely ruffled, and he had
defeated not only St, Pierre, but the giant half-breed as well! It was
inconceivable&mdash;and yet it had happened; a veritable burlesque, an
opera-bouffe affair that might turn quickly into a tragedy if either St.
Pierre or Concombre Bateese guessed the truth of it. For in that event he
might have to face them again, with the god of luck playing fairly, and
he was honest enough with himself to confess that the idea no longer held
either thrill or desire for him. Now that he had seen both St. Pierre and
Bateese stripped for battle, he had no further appetite for fistic
discussion with them. After all, there was a merit in caution, and he had
several lucky stars to bless just at the present moment!</p>

<p>Inwardly he was a bit suspicious of the ultimate ending of the affair.
St. Pierre had almost no cause for complaint, for it was his own
carelessness, coupled with his opponent's luck, that had been his
undoing&mdash;and luck and carelessness are legitimate factors of every
fight, Carrigan told himself. But with Bateese it was different. He had
held up his big jaw, uncovered and tempting, entreating some one to hit
him, and Carrigan had yielded to that temptation. The blow would have
stunned an ox. Three others like it had left the huge half-breed sitting
weak-mindedly in the sand, and no one of those three blows were exactly
according to the rules of the game. They had been mightily efficacious,
but the half-breed might demand a rehearing when he came fully into his
senses.</p>

<p>Not until they were half-way to the bateau did Carrigan dare to glance
back over his shoulder at the man who was paddling, to see what effect
the fistic travesty had left on him. He was a big- mouthed, clear-eyed,
powerfully-muscled fellow, and he was grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Well, what did you think of it, comrade?"</p>

<p>The other gave his shoulders a joyous shrug.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! Have you heard of wan garcon named Joe Clamart, m'sieu?
Non? Well, I am Joe Clamart what was once great fightin' man. Bateese
hav' whip' me five times, m'sieu&mdash;so I say it was wan gr- r-r-a-n'
fight! Many years ago I have seen ze same t'ing in Montreal&mdash;ze
boxeur de profession. Oui, an' Rene Babin pays me fifteen prime martin
against which I put up three scrubby red fox that you would win. They
were bad, or I would not have gambled, m'sieu. It ees fonny!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is funny," agreed David. "I think it is a bit too funny. It
is a pity they did not stand up on their legs a little longer!" Suddenly
an inspiration hit him. "Joe, what do you say&mdash;shall you and I
return and put up a REAL fight for them?"</p>

<p>Like a sprung trap Joe Clamart's grinning mouth dosed. "Non, non,
non," he grunted. "Dere has been plenty fight, an' Joe Clamart mus' save
hees face tor Antoinette Roland, who hate ze sign of fight lak she hate
ze devil, m'sieu! Non, non!"</p>

<p>His paddle dug deeper into the water, and David's heart felt lighter.
If Joe was an average barometer, and he was a husky and fearless-looking
chap, it was probable that neither St. Pierre nor Bateese would demand
another chance at him, and St. Pierre would pay his wager.</p>

<p>He could see no one aboard the bateau when he climbed from the canoe.
Looking back, he saw that two other canoes had started from the opposite
shore. Then he went to his cabin door, opened it, and entered, Scarcely
had the door closed behind him when he stopped, staring toward the window
that opened on the river.</p>

<p>Standing full in the morning glow of it was Marie-Anne Boulain. She
was facing him. Her cheeks were flushed. Her red lips were parted. Her
eyes were aglow with a fire which she made no effort to hide from him. In
her hand she still held the binoculars he had left on the cabin table. He
guessed the truth. Through the glasses she had watched the whole
miserable fiasco.</p>

<p>He felt creeping over him a sickening shame, and his eyes fell slowly
from her to the table. What he saw there caught his breath in the middle.
It was the entire surgical outfit of Nepapinas, the old Indian doctor.
And there were basins of water, and white strips of linen ready for use,
and a pile of medicated cotton, and all sorts of odds and ends that one
might apply to ease the agonies of a dying man, And beyond the table,
huddled in so small a heap that he was almost hidden by it, was Nepapinas
himself, disappointment writ in his mummy-like face as his beady eyes
rested on David.</p>

<p>The evidence could not be mistaken. They had expected him to come back
more nearly dead than alive, and St. Pierre's wife had prepared for the
thing she had thought inevitable. Even his bed was nicely turned down,
its fresh white sheets inviting an occupant!</p>

<p>And David, looking at St. Pierre's wife again, felt his heart beating
hard in his breast at the look which was in her eyes. It was not the
scintillation of laughter, and the flame in her cheeks was not
embarrassment. She was not amused. The ludicrousness of her mislaid plans
had not struck her as they had struck him. She had placed the binoculars
on the table, and slowly she came to him. Her hands reached out, and her
fingers rested like the touch of velvet on his arms.</p>

<p>"It was splendid!" she said softly, "It was splendid!"</p>

<p>She was very near, her breast almost touching him, her hands creeping
up until the tips of her fingers rested on his shoulders, her scarlet
mouth so close he could feel the soft breath of it in his face.</p>

<p>"It was splendid!" she whispered again.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, she rose up on her tiptoes and kissed him. So
swiftly was it done that she was gone before he sensed that wild touch of
her lips against his own. Like a swallow she was at the door, and the
door opened and closed behind her, and for a moment he heard the quick
running of her feet. Then he looked at the old Indian, and the Indian,
too, was staring at the door through which St. Pierre's wife had
flown.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_23">XXII</a></h3>

<p>For many seconds that seemed like minutes David stood where she had
left him, while Nepapinas rose gruntingly to his feet, and gathered up
his belongings, and hobbled sullenly to the bateau door and out. He was
scarcely conscious of the Indian's movement, for his soul was aflame with
a red-hot fire. Deliberately&mdash;with that ravishing glory of something
in her eyes&mdash;St. Pierre's wife had kissed him! On her tiptoes, her
cheeks like crimson flowers, she had given her still redder lips to him!
And his own lips burned, and his heart pounded hard, and he stared for a
time like one struck dumb at the spot where she had stood by the window.
Then suddenly, he turned to the door and flung it wide open, and on his
lips was the reckless cry of Marie-Anne's name. But St. Pierre's wife was
gone, and Nepapinas was gone, and at the tail of the big sweep sat only
Joe Clamart, guarding watchfully.</p>

<p>The two canoes were drawing near, and in one of them were two men, and
in the other three, and David knew that&mdash;like Joe Clamart&mdash;
they were watchers set over him by St. Pierre. Then a fourth canoe left
the far shore, and when it had reached mid-stream, he recognized the
figure in the stern as that of Andre, the Broken Man. The other, he
thought, must be St. Pierre.</p>

<p>He went back into the cabin and stood where Marie-Anne had
stood&mdash; at the window. Nepapinas had not taken away the basins of
water, and the bandages were still there, and the pile of medicated
cotton, and the suspiciously made-up bed. After all, he was losing
something by not occupying the bed&mdash;and yet if St. Pierre or Bateese
had messed him up badly, and a couple of fellows had lugged him in
between them, it was probable that Marie-Anne would not have kissed him.
And that kiss of St. Pierre's wife would remain with him until the day he
died!</p>

<p>He was thinking of it, the swift, warm thrill of her velvety lips, red
as strawberries and twice as sweet, when the door opened and St. Pierre
came in. The sight of him, in this richest moment of his life, gave David
no sense of humiliation or shame. Between him and St. Pierre rose swiftly
what he had seen last night&mdash;Carmin Fanchet in all the lure of her
disheveled beauty, crushed close in the arms of the man whose wife only a
moment before had pressed her lips close to his; and as the eyes of the
two met, there came over him a desire to tell the other what had
happened, that he might see him writhe with the sting of the two-edged
thing with which he was playing. Then he saw that even that would not
hurt St. Pierre, for the chief of the Boulains, standing there with the
big lump over his eye, had caught sight of the things on the table and
the nicely turned down bed, and his one good eye lit up with sudden
laughter, and his white teeth flashed in an understanding smile.</p>

<p>"TONNERRE, I said she would nurse you with gentle hands," he rumbled.
"See what you have missed, M'sieu Carrigan!"</p>

<p>"I received something which I shall remember longer than a fine
nursing," retorted David. "And yet right now I have a greater interest in
knowing what you think of the fight, St. Pierre&mdash;and if you have
come to pay your wager."</p>

<p>St. Pierre was chuckling mysteriously in his throat. "It was
splendid&mdash;splendid," he said, repeating Marie-Anne's words. "And Joe
Clamart says she ran out, blushing like a red rose in August, and that
she said no word, but flew like a bird into the white- birch ashore!"</p>

<p>"She was dismayed because I beat you, St. Pierre."</p>

<p>"Non, non&mdash;she was like a lark filled with joy."</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes rested on the binoculars.</p>

<p>David nodded. "Yes, she saw it all through the glasses."</p>

<p>St. Pierre seated himself at the table and heaved out a groan as he
took one of the bandage strips between his fingers. "She saw my disgrace.
And she didn't wait to bandage ME up, did she?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she thought Carmin Fanchet would do that, St. Pierre."</p>

<p>"And I am ashamed to go to Carmin&mdash;with this great lump over my
eye, m'sieu. And on top of that disgrace&mdash;you insist that I pay the
wager?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>St. Pierre's face hardened.</p>

<p>"OUI, I am to pay. I am to tell you all I know about that BETE
NOIR&mdash;Black Roger Audemard. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"That is the wager."</p>

<p>"But after I have told you&mdash;what then? Do you recall that I gave
you any other guarantee, M'sieu Carrigan? Did I say I would let you go?
Did I promise I would not kill you and sink your body to the bottom of
the river? If I did, I can not remember."</p>

<p>"Are you a beast, St. Pierre&mdash;a murderer as well as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Do not tell me again what you saw through the window, for it
has nothing to do with this. I am not a beast, but a man. Had I been a
beast, I should have killed you the first day I saw you in this cabin. I
am not threatening to kill you, and yet it may be necessary if you insist
that I pay the wager. You understand, m'sieu. To refuse to pay a wager is
a greater crime among my people than the killing of a man, if there is a
good reason for the killing. I am helpless. I must pay, if you insist.
Before I pay it is fair that I give you warning."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean nothing, as yet. I can not say what it will be necessary for
me to do, after you have heard what I know about Roger Audemard. I am
quite settled on a plan just now, m'sieu, but the plan might change at
any moment. I am only warning you that it is a great hazard, and that you
are playing with a fire of which you know nothing, because it has not
burned you yet."</p>

<p>Carrigan seated himself slowly in a chair opposite St. Pierre, with
the table between them.</p>

<p>"You are wasting time in attempting to frighten me," he said. "I shall
insist on the payment of the wager, St Pierre."</p>

<p>For a moment St. Pierre was clearly troubled. Then his lips tightened,
and he smiled grimly over the table at David.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, M'sieu David. I like you. You are a fighting man and no
coward, and I should like to travel shoulder to shoulder with you in many
things. And such a thing might be, for you do not understand. I tell you
it would have been many times better for you had I whipped you out there,
and it had been you&mdash;and not me&mdash; to pay the wager!"</p>

<p>"It is Roger Audemard I am interested in, St. Pierre. Why do you
hesitate?"</p>

<p>"I? Hesitate? I am not hesitating, m'sieu. I am giving you a chance."
He leaned forward, his great arms bent on the table. "And you insist,
M'sieu David?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I insist."</p>

<p>Slowly the fingers of St. Pierre's hands closed into knotted fists,
and he said in a low voice, "Then I will pay, m'sieu. <i>I</i> AM ROGER
AUDEMARD!"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_24">XXIII</a></h3>

<p>The astounding statement of the man who sat opposite him held David
speechless. He had guessed at some mysterious relationship between St.
Pierre and the criminal he was after, but not this, and Roger Audemard,
with his hands unclenching and a slow humor beginning to play about his
mouth, waited coolly for him to recover from his amazement. In those
moments, when his heart seemed to have stopped beating, Carrigan was
staring at the other, but his mind had shot beyond him&mdash;to the woman
who was his wife. Marie-Anne AUDEMARD&mdash;the wife of Black Roger! He
wanted to cry out against the possibility of such a fact, yet he sat like
one struck dumb, as the monstrous truth took possession of his brain and
a whirlwind of understanding swept upon him. He was thinking quickly, and
with a terrific lack of sentiment now. Opposite him sat Black Roger, the
wholesale murderer. Marie-Anne was his wife. Carmin Fanchet, sister of a
murderer, was simply one of his kind. And Bateese, the man-gorilla, and
the Broken Man, and all the dark-skinned pack about them were of Black
Roger's breed and kind. Love for a woman had blinded him to the facts
which crowded upon him now. Like a lamb he had fallen among wolves, and
he had tried to believe in them. No wonder Bateese and the man he had
known as St. Pierre had betrayed such merriment at times!</p>

<p>A fighting coolness possessed him as he spoke to Black Roger.</p>

<p>"I will admit this is a surprise. And yet you have cleared up a number
of things very quickly. It proves to me again that comedy is not very far
removed from tragedy at times."</p>

<p>"I am glad you see the humor of it, M'sieu David." Black Roger was
smiling as pleasantly as his swollen eye would permit. "We must not be
too serious when we die. If I were to die a-hanging, I would sing as the
rope choked me, just to show the world one need not be unhappy because
his life is coming to an end."</p>

<p>"I suppose you understand that ultimately I am going to give you that
opportunity," said David.</p>

<p>Almost eagerly Black Roger leaned toward him over the table. "You
believe you are going to hang me?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"And you are willing to wager the point, M'sieu David?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible to gamble with a condemned man."</p>

<p>Black Roger chuckled, rubbing his big hands together until they made a
rasping sound, and his one good eye glowed at Carrigan.</p>

<p>"Then I will make a wager with myself, M'sieu David. MA FOI, I swear
that before the leaves fall from the trees, you will be pleading for the
friendship of Black Roger Audemard, and you will be as much in love with
Carmin Fanchet as I am! And as for Marie- Anne&mdash;"</p>

<p>He thrust back his chair and rose to his feet, the old note of subdued
laughter rumbling in his chest. "And because I make this wager with
myself, I cannot kill you, M'sieu David&mdash;though that might be the
best thing to do. I am going to take you to the Chateau Boulain, which is
in the forests of the Yellowknife, beyond the Great Slave. Nothing will
happen to you if you make no effort to escape. If you do that, you will
surely die. And that would hurt me, M'sieu David, because I love you like
a brother, and in the end I know you are going to grip the hand of Black
Roger Audemard, and get down on your knees to Carmin Fanchet. And as for
Marie-Anne&mdash;" Again he interrupted himself, and went out of the
cabin, laughing. And there was no mistake in the metallic click of the
lock outside the door.</p>

<p>For a time David did not move from his seat near the table. He had not
let Roger Audemard see how completely the confession had upset his inner
balance, but he made no pretense of concealing the thing from himself
now. He was in the power of a cut-throat, who in turn had an army of
cut-throats at his back, and both Marie-Anne and Carmin Fanchet were a
part of this ring. And he was not only a prisoner. It was probable, under
the circumstances, that Black Roger would make an end of him when a
convenient moment came. It was even more than a probability. It was a
grim necessity. To let him live and escape would be fatal to Black
Roger.</p>

<p>From back of these convictions, riding over them as if to demoralize
any coherence and logic that might go with the evidence he was building
up, came question after question, pounding at him one after the other,
until his mind became more than ever a whirling chaos of uncertainty. If
St. Pierre was Black Roger, why would he confess to that fact simply to
pay a wager? What reason could he have for letting him live at all? Why
had not Bateese killed him? Why had Marie-Anne nursed him back to life?
His mind shot to the white strip of sand in which he had nearly died.
That, at least, was convincing. Learning in some way that he was after
Black Roger, they had attempted to do away with him there. But if that
were so, why was it Bateese and Black Roger's wife and the Indian
Nepapinas had risked so much to make him live, when if they had left him
where he had fallen he would have died and caused them no trouble?</p>

<p>There was something exasperatingly uncertain and illogical about it
all. Was it possible that St. Pierre Boulain was playing a huge joke on
him? Even that was inconceivable. For there was Carmin Fanchet, a fitting
companion for a man like Black Roger, and there was Marie-Anne, who, if
it had been a joke, would not have played her part so well.</p>

<p>Suddenly his mind was filled only with her. Had she been his friend,
using all her influence to protect him, because her heart was sick of the
environment of which she was a part? His own heart jumped at the thought.
It was easy to believe. In Marie-Anne he had faith, and that faith
refused to be destroyed, but persisted&mdash; even clearer and stronger
as he thought again of Carmin Fanchet and Black Roger. In his heart grew
the conviction it was sacrilege to believe the kiss she had given him
that morning was a lie. It was something else&mdash;a spontaneous
gladness, a joyous exultation that he had returned unharmed, a thing
unplanned in the soul of the woman, leaping from her before she could
stop it. Then had come shame, and she had run away from him so swiftly he
had not seen her face again after the touch of her lips. If it had been a
subterfuge, a lie, she would not have done that.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and paced restlessly back and forth as he tried to
bring together a few tangled bits of the puzzle. He heard voices outside,
and very soon felt the movement of the bateau under his feet, and through
one of the shoreward windows he saw trees and sandy beach slowly drifting
away. On that shore, as far as his eyes could travel up and down, he saw
no sign of Marie- Anne, but there remained a canoe, and near the canoe
stood Black Roger Audemard, and beyond him, huddled like a charred stump
in the sand, was Andre, the Broken Man. On the opposite shore the raft
was getting under way.</p>

<p>During the next half-hour several things happened which told him there
was no longer a sugar-coating to his imprisonment. On each side of the
bateau two men worked at his windows, and when they had finished, no one
of them could be opened more than a few inches. Then came the rattle of
the lock at the door, the grating of a key, and somewhat to Carrigan's
surprise it was Bateese who came in. The half-reed bore no facial
evidence of the paralyzing blows which had knocked him out a short time
before. His jaw, on which they had landed, was as aggressive as ever, yet
in his face and his attitude, as he stared curiously at Carrigan, there
was no sign of resentment or unfriendliness. Nor did he seem to be
ashamed. He merely stared, with the curious and rather puzzled eyes of a
small boy gazing at an inexplicable oddity. Carrigan, standing before
him, knew what was passing in the other's mind, and the humor of it
brought a smile to his lips.</p>

<p>Instantly Concombre's face split into a wide grin. "MON DIEU, w'at if
you was on'y brother to Concombre Bateese, m'sieu. T'ink of
zat&mdash;you&mdash;me&mdash;FRERE D'ARMES! VENTRE SAINT GRIS, but we
mak' all fightin' men in nort' countree run lak rabbits ahead of ze fox!
OUI, we mak' gr-r-r-eat pair, m'sieu&mdash;you, w'at knock down
Bateese&mdash;an' Bateese, w'at keel polar bear wit hees naked hands,
w'at pull down trees, w'at chew flint w'en hees tobacco gone."</p>

<p>His voice had risen, and suddenly there came a laugh from outside the
door, and Concombre cut himself short and his mouth closed with a snap.
It was Joe Clamart who had laughed.</p>

<p>"I w'ip heem five time, an' now I w'ip heem seex!" hissed Bateese in
an undertone. "Two time each year I w'ip zat gargon Joe Clamart so he
understan' w'at good fightin' man ees. An' you will w'ip heem, eh,
m'sieu? Oui? An' I will breeng odder good fightin' mans for you to
w'ip&mdash;all w'at Concombre Bateese has w'ipped&mdash;ten, dozen,
forty&mdash;an' you w'ip se gran' bunch, m'sieu. Eh, shall we mak' ze
bargain?"</p>

<p>"You are planning a pleasant time for me, Bateese," said Carrigan,
"but I am afraid it will be impossible. You see, this captain of yours,
Black Roger Audemard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"W'at!" Bateese jumped as if stung. "W'at you say, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>"I said that Roger Audemard, Black Roger, the man I thought was St.
Pierre Boulain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carrigan said no more. What he had started to say was unimportant
compared with the effect of Roger Audernard's name on Concombre Bateese.
A deadly light glittered in the half-breed's eyes, and for the first time
David realized that in the grotesque head of the riverman was a brain
quick to grip at the significance of things. The fact was evident that
Black Roger had not confided in Bateese as to the price of the wager and
the confession of his identity, and for a moment after the repetition of
Audemard's name came from David's lips the half-breed stood as if
something had stunned him. Then slowly, as if forcing the words in the
face of a terrific desire that had transformed his body into a hulk of
quivering steel, he said:</p>

<p>"M'sieu&mdash;I come with message&mdash;from St. Pierre. You see
windows&mdash; closed. Outside door&mdash;she locked. On bot' sides de
bateau, all de time, we watch. You try get away, an' we keel you. Zat ees
all. We shoot. We five mans on ze bateau, all ze day, TOUTE LA NUIT. You
unnerstan'?"</p>

<p>He turned sullenly, waiting for no reply, and the door opened and
closed after him&mdash;and again came the snap of the lock outside.</p>

<p>Steadily the bateau swept down the big river that day. There was no
let-up in the steady creaking of the long sweep. Even in the swifter
currents David could hear the working of it, and he knew he had seen the
last of the more slowly moving raft. Near one of the partly open windows
he heard two men talking just before the bateau shot into the Brule Point
rapids. They were strange voices. He learned that Audemard's huge raft
was made up of thirty-five cribs, seven abreast, and that nine times
between the Point Brule and the Yellowknife the raft would be split up,
so that each crib could be run through dangerous rapids by itself.</p>

<p>That would be a big job, David assured himself. It would be slow work
as well as hazardous, and as his own life was in no immediate jeopardy,
he would have ample time in which to formulate some plan of action for
himself. At the present moment, it seemed, the one thing for him to do
was to wait&mdash;and behave himself, according to the half-breed's
instructions. There was, when he came to think about it, a saving element
of humor about it all. He had always wanted to make a trip down the Three
Rivers in a bateau. And now&mdash; he was making it!</p>

<p>At noon a guard brought in his dinner. He could not recall that he had
ever seen this man before, a tall, lithe fellow built to run like a
hound, and who wore a murderous-looking knife at his belt. As the door
opened, David caught a glimpse of two others. They were business-like
looking individuals, with muscles built for work or fight; one sitting
cross-legged on the bateau deck with a rifle over his knees, and the
other standing with a rifle in his hand. The man who brought his dinner
wasted no time or words. He merely nodded, murmured a curt bonjour, and
went out. And Carrigan, as he began to eat, did not have to tell himself
twice that Audemard had been particular in his selection of the bateau's
crew, and that the eyes of the men he had seen could be as keen as a
hawk's when leveled over the tip of a rifle barrel. They meant business,
and he felt no desire to smile in the face of them, as he had smiled at
Concombre Bateese.</p>

<p>It was another man, and a stranger, who brought in his supper. And for
two hours after that, until the sun went down and gloom began to fall,
the bateau sped down the river. It had made forty miles that day, he
figured.</p>

<p>It was still light when the bateau was run ashore and tied up, but
tonight there were no singing voices or wild laughter of men whose hours
of play-time and rest had come. To Carrigan, looking through his window,
there was an oppressive menace about it all. The shadowy figures ashore
were more like a death-watch than a guard, and to dispel the gloom of it
he lighted two of the lamps in the cabin, whistled, drummed a simple
chord he knew on the piano, and finally settled down to smoking his pipe.
He would have welcomed the company of Bateese, or Joe Clamart, or one of
the guards, and as his loneliness grew upon him there was something of
companionship even in the subdued voices he heard occasionally outside.
He tried to read, but the printed words jumbled themselves and meant
nothing.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock, and clouds had darkened the night, when through
his open windows he heard a shout coming from the river. Twice it came
before it was answered from the bateau, and the second time Carrigan
recognized it as the voice of Roger Audemard. A brief interval passed
between that and the scraping of a canoe alongside, and then there was a
low conversation in which even Audemard's great voice was subdued, and
after that the grating of a key in the lock, and the opening of the door,
and Black Roger came in, bearing an Indian reed basket under his arm.
Carrigan did not rise to meet him. It was not like the coming of the old
St. Pierre, and on Black Roger's lips there was no twist of a smile, nor
in his eyes the flash of good-natured greeting. His face was darkly
stern, as if he had traveled far and hard on an unpleasant mission, but
in it there was no shadow of menace, as there had been in that of
Concombre Bateese. It was rather the face of a tired man, and yet David
knew what he saw was not physical exhaustion. Black Roger guessed
something of his thought, and his mouth for an instant repressed a
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been having a rough time," he nodded, "This is for
you!"</p>

<p>He placed the basket on the table. It held half a bushel, and was
filled to the curve of the handle. What lay in it was hidden under a
cloth securely tied about it.</p>

<p>"And you are responsible," he added, stretching himself in a chair
with a gesture of weariness. "I should kill you, Carrigan. And instead of
that I bring you good things to eat! Half the day she has been fussing
with the things in the basket, and then insisted that I bring them to
you. And I have brought them simply to tell you another thing. I am sorry
for her. I think, M'sieu Carrigan, you will find as many tears in the
basket as anything else, for her heart is crushed and sick because of the
humiliation she brought upon herself this morning."</p>

<p>He was twisting his big, rough hands, and David's own heart went sick
as he saw the furrowed lines that had deepened in the other's face. Black
Roger did not look at him as he went on.</p>

<p>"Of course, she told me. She tells me everything. And if she knew I
was telling you this, I think she would kill herself. But I want you to
understand. She is not what you might think she is. That kiss came from
the lips of the best woman God ever made, M'sieu Carrigan!"</p>

<p>David, with the blood in him running like fire, heard himself
answering, "I know it. She was excited, glad you had not stained your
hands with my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time Audemard smiled, but it was the smile of a man ten years
older than he had appeared yesterday. "Don't try to answer, m'sieu. I
only want you to know she is as pure as the stars. It was unfortunate,
but to follow the impulse of one's heart can not be a sin. Everything has
been unfortunate since you came. But I blame no one, except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Carmin Fanchet?"</p>

<p>Audemard nodded. "Yes. I have sent her away. Marie-Anne is in the
cabin on the raft now. But even Carmin I can not blame very greatly,
m'sieu, for it is impossible to hold anything against one you love. Tell
me if I am right? You must know. You love my Marie- Anne. Do you hold
anything against her?"</p>

<p>"It is unfair," protested David. "She is your wife, Audemard, is it
possible you don't love her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love her."</p>

<p>"And Carmin Fanchet?"</p>

<p>"I love her, too. They are so different. Yet I love them both. Is it
not possible for a big heart like mine to do that, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>With almost a snort David rose to his feet and stared through one of
the windows into the darkness of the river. "Black Roger," he said
without turning his head, "the evidence at Headquarters condemns you as
one of the blackest-hearted murderers that ever lived. But that crime, to
me, is less atrocious than the one you are committing against your own
wife. I am not ashamed to confess I love her, because to deny it would be
a lie. I love her so much that I would sacrifice myself&mdash;soul and
body&mdash;if that sacrifice could give you back to her, clean and
undefiled and with your hand unstained by the crime for which you must
hang!"</p>

<p>He did not hear Roger Audemard as he rose from his chair. For a moment
the riverman stared at the back of David's head, and in that moment he
was fighting to keep back what wanted to come from his lips in words. He
turned before David faced him again, and did not pause until he stood at
the cabin door with his hand at the latch. There he was partly in
shadow.</p>

<p>"I shall not see you again until you reach the Yellowknife," he said.
"Not until then will you know&mdash;or will I know&mdash;what is going to
happen. I think you will understand strange things then, but that is for
the hour to tell. Bateese has explained to you that you must not make an
effort to escape. You would regret it, and so would I. If you have red
blood in you, m'sieu&mdash;if you would understand all that you cannot
understand now&mdash;wait as patiently as you can. Bonne nuit, M'sieu
Carrigan!"</p>

<p>"Good night!" nodded David.</p>

<p>In the pale shadows he thought a mysterious light of gladness
illumined Black Roger's face before the door opened and closed, leaving
him alone again.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_25">XXIV</a></h3>

<p>With the going of Black Roger also went the oppressive loneliness
which had gripped Carrigan, and as he stood listening to the low voices
outside, the undeniable truth came to him that he did not hate this man
as he wanted to hate him. He was a murderer, and a scoundrel in another
way, but he felt irresistibly the impulse to like him and to feel sorry
for him. He made an effort to shake off the feeling, but a small voice
which he could not quiet persisted in telling him that more than one good
man had committed what the law called murder, and that perhaps he didn't
fully understand what he had seen through the cabin window on the raft.
And yet, when unstirred by this impulse, he knew the evidence was
damning.</p>

<p>But his loneliness was gone. With Audemard's visit had come an
unexpected thrill, the revival of an almost feverish anticipation, the
promise of impending things that stirred his blood as he thought of them.
"You will understand strange things then," Roger Audemard had said, and
something in his voice had been like a key unlocking mysterious doors for
the first time. And then, "Wait, as patiently as you can!" Out of the
basket on the table seemed to come to him a whispering echo of that same
word&mdash;wait! He laid his hands upon it, and a pulse of life came with
the imagined whispering. It was from Marie-Anne. It seemed as though the
warmth of her hands were still there, and as he removed the cloth the
sweet breath of her came to him. And then, in the next instant, he was
trying to laugh at himself and trying equally hard to call himself a
fool, for it was the breath of newly-baked things which her fingers had
made.</p>

<p>Yet never had he felt the warmth of her presence more strangely in his
heart. He did not try to explain to himself why Roger Audemard's visit
had broken down things which had seemed insurmountable an hour ago.
Analysis was impossible, because he knew the transformation within
himself was without a shred of reason. But it had come, and with it his
imprisonment took on another form. Where before there had been thought of
escape and a scheming to jail Black Roger, there filled him now an
intense desire to reach the Yellowknife and the Chateau Boulain.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when he went to bed, and he was up with the
early dawn. With the first break of day the bateau men were preparing
their breakfast. David was glad. He was eager for the day's work to
begin, and in that eagerness he pounded on the door and called out to Joe
Clamart that he was ready for his breakfast with the rest of them, but
that he wanted only hot coffee to go with what Black Roger had brought to
him in the basket.</p>

<p>That afternoon the bateau passed Fort McMurray, and before the sun was
well down in the west Carrigan saw the green slopes of Thickwood Hills
and the rising peaks of Birch Mountains. He laughed outright as he
thought of Corporal Anderson and Constable Frazer at Fort McMurray, whose
chief duty was to watch the big waterway. How their eyes would pop if
they could see through the padlocked door of his prison! But he had no
inclination to be discovered now. He wanted to go on, and with a growing
exultation he saw there was no intention on the part of the bateau's crew
to loiter on the way. There was no stop at noon, and the tie-up did not
come until the last glow of day was darkening into the gloom of night in
the sky. For sixteen hours the bateau had traveled steadily, and it could
not have made less than sixty miles as the river ran. The raft, David
figured, had not traveled a third of the distance.</p>

<p>The fact that the bateau's progress would bring him to Chateau Boulain
many days, and perhaps weeks, before Black Roger and Marie-Anne could
arrive on the raft did not check his enthusiasm. It was this interval
between their arrivals which held a great speculative promise for him. In
that time, if his efficiency had not entirely deserted him, he would
surely make discoveries of importance.</p>

<p>Day after day the journey continued without rest. On the fourth day
after leaving Fort McMurray it was Joe Clamart who brought in David's
supper, and he grunted a protest at his long hours of muscle-breaking
labor at the sweeps. When David questioned him he shrugged his shoulders,
and his mouth closed tight as a clam. On the fifth, the bateau crossed
the narrow western neck of Lake Athabasca, slipping past Chipewyan in the
night, and on the sixth it entered the Slave River. It was the fourteenth
day when the bateau entered Great Slave Lake, and the second night after
that, as dusk gathered thickly between the forest walls of the
Yellowknife, David knew that at last they had reached the mouth of the
dark and mysterious stream which led to the still more mysterious domain
of Black Roger Audemard.</p>

<p>That night the rejoicing of the bateau men ashore was that of men who
had come out from under a strain and were throwing off its tension for
the first time in many days. A great fire was built, and the men sang and
laughed and shouted as they piled wood upon it. In the flare of this fire
a smaller one was built, and kettles and pans were soon bubbling and
sizzling over it, and a great coffee pot that held two gallons sent out
its steam laden with an aroma that mingled joyously with the balsam and
cedar smells in the air. David could see the whole thing from his window,
and when Joe Clamart came in with supper, he found the meat they were
cooking over the fire was fresh moose steak. As there had been no trading
or firing of guns coming down, he was puzzled and when he asked where the
meat had come from Joe Clamart only shrugged his shoulders and winked an
eye, and went out singing about the allouette bird that had everything
plucked from it, one by one. But David noticed there were never more than
four men ashore at the same time. At least one was always aboard the
bateau, watching his door and windows.</p>

<p>And he, too, felt the thrill of an excitement working subtly within
him, and this thrill pounded in swifter running blood when he saw the men
about the fire jump to their feet suddenly and go to meet new and shadowy
figures that came up indistinctly just in the edge of the forest gloom.
There they mingled and were lost in. identity for a long time, and David
wondered if the newcomers were of the people of Chateau Boulain. After
that, Bateese and Joe Clamart and two others stamped out the fires and
came over the plank to the bateau to sleep. David followed their example
and went to bed.</p>

<p>The cook fires were burning again before the gray dawn was broken by a
tint of the sun, and when the voices of many men roused David, he went to
his window and saw a dozen figures where last night there had been only
four. When it grew lighter he recognized none of them. All were
strangers. Then he realized the significance of their presence. The
bateau had been traveling north, but downstream. Now it would still
travel north, but the water of the Yellow-knife flowed south into Great
Slave Lake, and the bateau must be towed. He caught a glimpse of the two
big York boats a little later, and six rowers to a boat, and after that
the bateau set out slowly but steadily upstream.</p>

<p>For hours David was at one window or the other, with something of awe
working inside him as he saw what they were passing through&mdash; and
between. He fancied the water trail was like an entrance into a forbidden
land, a region of vast and unbroken mystery, a country of enchantment,
possibly of death, shut out from the world he had known. For the stream
narrowed, and the forest along the shores was so dense he could not see
into it. The tree-tops hung in a tangled canopy overhead, and a gloom of
twilight filled the channel below, so that where the sun shot through, it
was like filtered moonlight shining on black oil. There was no sound
except the dull, steady beat of the rowers' oars, and the ripple of water
along the sides of the bateau. The men did not sing or laugh, and if they
talked it must have been in whispers. There was no cry of birds from
ashore. And once David saw Joe Clamart's face as he passed the window,
and it was set and hard and filled with the superstition of a man who was
passing through a devil-country.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the end of it came. A flood of sunlight burst in at
the windows, and all at once voices came from ahead, a laugh, a shout,
and a yell of rejoicing from the bateau, and Joe Clamart started again
the everlasting song of the allouette bird that was plucked of everything
it had. Carrigan found himself grinning. They were a queer people, these
bred-in-the-blood northerners&mdash; still moved by the superstitions of
children. Yet he conceded that the awesome deadness of the forest passage
had put strange thoughts into his own heart.</p>

<p>Before nightfall Bateese and Joe Clamart came in and tied his arms
behind him, and he was taken ashore with the rumble of a waterfall in his
ears. For two hours he watched the labors of the men as they beached the
bateau on long rollers of smooth birch and rolled it foot by foot over a
cleared trail until it was launched again above the waterfall. Then he
was led back into the cabin and his arms freed. That night he went to
sleep with the music of the waterfall in his ears.</p>

<p>The second day the Yellowknife seemed to be no longer a river, but a
narrow lake, and the third day the rowers came into the Nine Lake country
at noon, and until another dusk the bateau threaded its way through
twisting channels and impenetrable forests, and beached at last at the
edge of a great open where the timber had been cut. There was more
excitement here, but it was too dark for David to understand the meaning
of it. There were many voices; dogs barked. Then voices were at his door,
a key rattled in the lock, and it opened. David saw Bateese and Joe
Clamart first. And then, to his amazement, Black Roger Audemard stood
there, smiling at him and nodding good-evening.</p>

<p>It was impossible for David to repress his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Chateau Boulain," greeted Black Roger. "You are surprised?
Well, I beat you out by half a dozen hours&mdash;in a canoe, m'sieu. It
is only courtesy that I should be here to give you welcome!"</p>

<p>Behind him Bateese and Joe Clamart were grinning widely, and then both
came in, and Joe Clamart picked up his dunnage-sack and threw it over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"If you will come with us, m'sieu&mdash;"</p>

<p>David followed, and when he stepped ashore there were Bateese, and Joe
Clamart and one other behind him, and three or four shadowy figures
ahead, with Black Roger walking at his side. There were no more voices,
and the dog had ceased barking. Ahead was a wall of darkness, which was
the deep black forest beyond the clearing, and into it led a trail which
they followed. It was a path worn smooth by the travel of many feet, and
for a mile not a star broke through the tree-tops overhead, nor did a
flash of light break the utter chaos of the way but once, when Joe
Clamart lighted his pipe. No one spoke. Even Black Roger was silent, and
David found no word to say.</p>

<p>At the end of the mile the trees began to open above their heads, and
they soon came to the edge of the timber. In the darkness David caught
his breath. Dead ahead, not a rifle shot away, was the Chateau Boulain.
He knew it before Black Roger had said a word. He guessed it by the
lighted windows, full a score of them, without a curtain drawn to shut
out their illumination from the night. He could see nothing but these
lights, yet they measured off a mighty place to be built of logs in the
heart of a wilderness, and at his side he heard Black Roger chuckling in
low exultation.</p>

<p>"Our home, m'sieu," he said. "Tomorrow, when you see it in the light
of day, you will say it is the finest chateau in the north&mdash; all
built of sweet cedar where birch is not used, so that even in the deep
snows it gives us the perfume of springtime and flowers."</p>

<p>David did not answer, and in a moment Audemard said:</p>

<p>"Only on Christmas and New Year and at birthdays and wedding feasts is
it lighted up like that. Tonight it is in your honor, M'sieu David."
Again he laughed softly, and under his breath he added, "And there is
some one waiting for you there whom you will be surprised to see!"</p>

<p>David's heart gave a jump. There was meaning in Black Roger's words
and no double twist to what he meant. Marie-Anne had come ahead with her
husband!</p>

<p>Now, as they passed on to the brilliantly lighted chateau, David made
out the indistinct outlines of other buildings almost hidden in the
out-creeping shadows of the forest-edges, with now and then a ray of
light to show people were in them. But there was a brooding silence over
it all which made him wonder, for there was no voice, no bark of dog, not
even the opening or closing of a door. As they drew nearer, he saw a
great veranda reaching the length of the chateau, with screening to keep
out the summer pests of mosquitoes and flies and the night prowling
insects attracted by light. Into this they went, up wide birch steps, and
ahead of them was a door so heavy it looked like the postern gate of a
castle. Black Roger opened it, and in a moment David stood beside him in
a dimly lighted hall where the mounted heads of wild beasts looked down
like startled things from the gloom of the walls. And then David heard
the low, sweet notes of a piano coming to them very faintly.</p>

<p>He looked at Black Roger. A smile was on the lips of the chateau
master; his head was up, and his eyes glowed with pride and joy as the
music came to him. He spoke no word, but laid a hand on David's arm and
led him toward it, while Bateese and Joe Clamart remained standing at the
entrance to the hall. David's feet trod in thick rugs of fur; he saw the
dim luster of polished birch and cedar in the walls, and over his head
the ceiling was rich and matched, as in the bateau cabin. They drew
nearer to the music and came to a closed door. This Black Roger opened
very quietly, as if anxious not to disturb the one who was playing.</p>

<p>They entered, and David held his breath. It was a great room he stood
in, thirty feet or more from end to end, and scarcely less in
width&mdash;a room brilliant with light, sumptuous in its comfort, sweet
with the perfume of wild-flowers, and with a great black fireplace at the
end of it, from over which there stared at him the glass eyes of a
monster moose. Then he saw the figure at the piano, and something rose up
quickly and choked him when his eyes told him it was not Marie-Anne. It
was a slim, beautiful figure in a soft and shimmering white gown, and its
head was glowing gold in the lamplight.</p>

<p>Roger Audemard spoke, "Carmin!"</p>

<p>The woman at the piano turned about, a little startled at the
unexpectedness of the voice, and then rose quickly to her feet&mdash; and
David Carrigan found himself looking into the eyes of Carmin Fanchet!</p>

<p>Never had he seen her more beautiful than in this moment, like an
angel in her shimmering dress of white, her hair a radiant glory, her
eyes wide and glowing&mdash;and, as she looked at him, a smile coming to
her red lips. Yes, SHE WAS SMILING AT HIM&mdash;this woman whose brother
he had brought to the hangman, this woman who had stolen Black Roger from
another! She knew him&mdash;he was sure of that; she knew him as the man
who had believed her a criminal along with her brother, and who had
fought to the last against her freedom. Yet from her lips and her eyes
and her face the old hatred was gone. She was coming toward him slowly;
she was reaching out her hand, and half blindly his own went out, and he
felt the warmth of her fingers for a moment, and he heard her voice
saying softly,</p>

<p>"Welcome to Chateau Boulain, M'sieu Carrigan."</p>

<p>He bowed and mumbled something, and Black Roger gently pressed his
arm, drawing him back to the door. As he went he saw again that Carmin
Fanchet was very beautiful as she stood there, and that her lips were
very red&mdash;but her face was white, whiter than he had ever seen the
face of a woman before.</p>

<p>As they went up a winding stair to the second floor, Roger Audemard
said, "I am proud of my Carmin, M'sieu David. Would any other woman in
the world have given her hand like that to the man who had helped to kill
her brother?"</p>

<p>They stopped at another door. Black Roger opened it. There were lights
within, and David knew it was to be his room. Audemard did not follow him
inside, but there was a flashing humor in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I say, is there another woman like her in the world, m'sieu?"</p>

<p>"What have you done to Marie-Anne&mdash;your wife?" asked David.</p>

<p>It was hard for him to get the words out. A terrible thing was
gripping at his throat, and the clutch of it grew tighter as he saw the
wild light in Black Roger's eyes.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow you will know, m'sieu. But not to-night. You must wait until
tomorrow,"</p>

<p>He nodded and stepped back, and the door closed&mdash;and in the same
instant came the harsh grating of a key in the lock.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_26">XXV</a></h3>

<p>Carrigan turned slowly and looked about his room. There was no other
door except one opening into a closet, and but two windows. Curtains were
drawn at these windows, and he raised them. A grim smile came to his lips
when he saw the white bars of tough birch nailed across each of them,
outside the glass. He could see the birch had been freshly stripped of
bark and had probably been nailed there that day. Carmin Fanchet and
Black Roger had welcomed him to Chateau Boulain, but they were evidently
taking no chances with their prisoner. And where was Marie-Anne?</p>

<p>The question was insistent, and with it remained that cold grip of
something in his heart that had come with the sight of Carmin Fanchet
below. Was it possible that Carmin's hatred still lived, deadlier than
ever, and that with Black Roger she had plotted to bring him here so that
her vengeance might be more complete&mdash;and a greater torture to him?
Were they smiling and offering him their hands, even as they knew he was
about to die? And if that was conceivable, what had they done with
Marie-Anne?</p>

<p>He looked about the room. It was singularly bare, in an unusual sort
of way, he thought. There were rich rugs on the floor&mdash;three
magnificent black bearskins, and two wolf. The heads of two bucks and a
splendid caribou hung against the walls. He could see, from marks on the
floor, where a bed had stood, but this bed was now replaced by a couch
made up comfortably for one inclined to sleep. The significance of the
thing was clear&mdash;nowhere in the room could he lay his hand upon an
object that might be used as a weapon!</p>

<p>His eyes again sought the white-birch bars of his prison, and he
raised the two windows so that the cool, sweet breath of the forests
reached in to him. It was then that he noticed the mosquito-proof
screening nailed outside the bars. It was rather odd, this thinking of
his comfort even as they planned to kill him!</p>

<p>If there was truth to this new suspicion that Black Roger and his
mistress were plotting both vengeance and murder, their plans must also
involve Marie-Anne. Suddenly his mind shot back to the raft. Had Black
Roger turned a clever coup by leaving his wife there, while he came on
ahead of the bateau with Carmin Fanchet? It would be several weeks before
the raft reached the Yellowknife, and in that time many things might
happen. The thought worried him. He was not afraid for himself. Danger,
the combating of physical forces, was his business. His fear was for
Marie-Anne. He had seen enough to know that Black Roger was hopelessly
infatuated with Carmin Fanchet. And several things might happen aboard
the raft, planned by agents as black-souled as himself. If they killed
Marie-Anne&mdash;</p>

<p>His hand gripped the knob of the door, and for a moment he was filled
with the impulse to shout for Black Roger and face him with what was in
his mind. And as he stood there, every muscle in his body ready to fight,
there came to him faintly the sound of music. He heard the piano first,
and then a woman's voice singing. Soon a man's voice joined the woman's,
and he knew it was Black Roger, singing with Carmin Fanchet.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mad impulse in his heart went out, and he leaned his head
nearer to the crack of the door, and strained his ears to hear. He could
make out no word of the song, yet the singing came to him with a thrill
that set his lips apart and brought a staring wonder into his eyes. In
the room below him, fifteen hundred miles from civilization, Black Roger
and Carmin Fanchet were singing "Home, Sweet Home!"</p>

<p>An hour later David looked through one of the barred windows upon a
world lighted by a splendid moon. He could see the dark edge of the
distant forest that rimmed in the chateau, and about him seemed to be a
level meadow, with here and there the shadow of a building in which the
lights were out. Stars were thick in the sky, and a strange quietness
hovered over the world he looked upon. From below him floated up now and
then a perfume of tobacco smoke. The guard under his window was awake,
but he made no sound.</p>

<p>A little later he undressed, put out the two lights in his room, and
stretched himself between the cool, white sheets on the couch. After a
time he slept, but it was a restless slumber filled with troubled dreams.
Twice he was half awake, and the second time it seemed to him his
nostrils sensed a sharper tang of smoke than that of burning tobacco, yet
he did not fully rouse himself, and the hours passed, and new sounds and
smells that rose in the night impinged themselves upon him only as a part
of the troublous fabric of his dreams. But at last there came a shock,
something which beat over these things which chained him, and seized upon
his consciousness, demanding that he rouse himself, open his eyes, and
get up.</p>

<p>He obeyed the command, and before he was fully awake, found himself on
his feet. It was still dark, but he heard voices, voices no longer
subdued, but filled with a wild note of excitement and command. And what
he smelled was not the smell of tobacco smoke! It was heavy in his room.
It filled his lungs. His eyes were smarting with the sting of it.</p>

<p>Then came vision, and with a startled cry he leaped to a window. To
the north and east he looked out upon a flaming world!</p>

<p>With his fist he rubbed his smarting eyes. The moon was gone. The gray
he saw outside must be the coming of dawn, ghostly with that mist of
smoke that had come into his room. He could see shadowy figures of men
running swiftly in and out and disappearing, and he could hear the voices
of women and children, and from beyond the edge of the forest to the west
came the howling of many dogs. One voice rose above the others. It was
Black Roger's, and at its commands little groups of figures shot out into
the gray smoke- gloom and did not appear again.</p>

<p>North and east the sky was flaming sullen red, and a breath of air
blowing gently in David's face told him the direction of the wind. The
chateau lay almost in the center of the growing line of
conflagration.</p>

<p>He dressed himself and went again to the window. Quite distinctly now,
he could make out Joe Clamart under his window, running toward the edge
of the forest at the head of half a dozen men and boys who carried axes
and cross-cut saws over their shoulders. It was the last of Black Roger's
people that he saw for some time in the open meadow, but from the front
of the chateau he could hear many voices, chiefly of women and children,
and guessed it was from there that the final operations against the fire
were being directed. The wind was blowing stronger in his face. With it
came a sharper tang of smoke, and the widening light of day was fighting
to hold its own against the deepening pall of flame-lit gloom advancing
with the wind.</p>

<p>There seemed to come a low and distant sound with that wind, so
indistinct that to David's ears it was like a murmur a thousand miles
away. He strained his ears to hear, and as he listened, there came
another sound&mdash;a moaning, sobbing voice below his window! It was
grief he heard now, something that went to his heart and held him cold
and still. The voice was sobbing like that of a child, yet he knew it was
not a child's. Nor was it a woman's. A figure came out slowly in his
view, humped over, twisted in its shape, and he recognized Andre, the
Broken Man. David could see that he was crying like a child, and he was
facing the flaming forests, with his arms reaching out to them in his
moaning. Then, of a sudden, he gave a strange cry, as if defiance had
taken the place of grief, and he hurried across the meadow and
disappeared into the timber where a great lightning-riven spruce gleamed
dully white through the settling veil of smoke-mist.</p>

<p>For a space David looked after him, a strange beating in his heart. It
was as if he had seen a little child going into the face of a deadly
peril, and at last he shouted out for some one to bring back the Broken
Man. But there was no answer from under his window. The guard was gone.
Nothing lay between him and escape&mdash;if he could force the white
birch bars from the window.</p>

<p>He thrust himself against them, using his shoulder as a battering-
ram. Not the thousandth part of an inch could he feel them give, yet he
worked until his shoulder was sore. Then he paused and studied the bars
more carefully. Only one thing would avail him, and that was some object
which he might use as a lever.</p>

<p>He looked about him, and not a thing was there in the room to answer
the purpose. Then his eyes fell on the splendid horns of the caribou
head. Black Roger's discretion had failed him there, and eagerly David
pulled the head down from the wall. He knew the woodsman's trick of
breaking off a horn from the skull, yet in this room, without log or root
to help him, the task was difficult, and it was a quarter of an hour
after he had last seen the Broken Man before he stood again at the window
with the caribou horn in his hands. He no longer had to hold his breath
to hear the low moaning in the wind, and where there had been smoke-
gloom before there were now black clouds rolling and twisting up over the
tops of the north and eastern forests, as if mighty breaths were playing
with them from behind.</p>

<p>David thrust the big end of the caribou horn between two of the
white-birch bars, but before he had put his weight to the lever he heard
a great voice coming round the end of the chateau, and it was calling for
Andre, the Broken Man. In a moment it was followed by Black Roger
Audemard, who ran under the window and faced the lightning-struck spruce
as he shouted Andre's name again.</p>

<p>Suddenly David called down to him, and Black Roger turned and looked
up through the smoke-gloom, his head bare, his arms naked, and his eyes
gleaming wildly as he listened.</p>

<p>"He went that way twenty minutes ago," David shouted. "He disappeared
into the forest where you see the dead spruce yonder. And he was crying,
Black Roger&mdash;he was crying like a child."</p>

<p>If there had been other words to finish, Black Roger would not have
heard them. He was running toward the old spruce, and David saw him
disappear where the Broken Man had gone. Then he put his weight on the
horn, and one of the tough birch bars gave way slowly, and after that a
second was wrenched loose, and a third, until the lower half of the
window was free of them entirely. He thrust out his head and found no one
within the range of his vision. Then he worked his way through the
window, feet first, and hanging the length of arms and body from the
lower sill, dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>Instantly he faced the direction taken by Roger Audemard, it was HIS
turn now, and he felt a savage thrill in his blood. For an instant he
hesitated, held by the impulse to rush to Carmin Fanchet and with his
fingers at her throat, demand what she and her paramour had done with
Marie-Anne. But the mighty determination to settle it all with Black
Roger himself overwhelmed that impulse like an inundation. Black Roger
had gone into the forest. He was separated from his people, and the
opportunity was at hand.</p>

<p>Positive that Marie-Anne had been left with the raft, the thought that
the Chateau Boulain might be devoured by the onrushing conflagration did
not appal David. The chateau held little interest for him now. It was
Black Roger he wanted. As he ran toward the old spruce, he picked up a
club that lay in the path.</p>

<p>This path was a faintly-worn trail where it entered the forest beyond
the spruce, very narrow, and with brush hanging close to the sides of it,
so that David knew it was not in general use and that but few feet had
ever used it. He followed swiftly, and in five minutes came suddenly out
into a great open thick with smoke, and here he saw why Chateau Boulain
would not burn. The break in the forest was a clearing a rifle-shot in
width, free of brush and grass, and partly tilled; and it ran in a
semi-circle as far as he could see through the smoke in both directions.
Thus had Black Roger safeguarded his wilderness castle, while providing
tillable fields for his people; and as David followed the faintly beaten
path, he saw green stuffs growing on both sides of him, and through the
center of the clearing a long strip of wheat, green and very thick. Up
and down through the fog of smoke he could hear voices, and he knew it
was this great, circular fire-clearing the people of Chateau Boulain were
watching and guarding.</p>

<p>But he saw no one as he trailed across the open. In soft patches of
the earth he found footprints deeply made and wide apart, the footprints
of hurrying men, telling him Black Roger and the Broken Man were both
ahead of him, and that Black Roger was running when he crossed the
clearing.</p>

<p>The footprints led him to a still more indistinct trail in the farther
forest, a trail which went straight into the face of the fire ahead. He
followed it. The distant murmur had grown into a low moaning over the
tree-tops, and with it the wind was coming stronger, and the smoke
thicker. For a mile he continued along the path, and then he stopped,
knowing he had come to the dead-line. Over him was a swirling chaos. The
fire-wind had grown into a roar before which the tree-tops bent as if
struck by a gale, and in the air he breathed he could feel a swiftly
growing heat. For a space he stood there, breathing quickly in the face
of a mighty peril. Where had Black Roger and the Broken Man gone? What
mad impulse could it be that dragged them still farther into the path of
death? Or had they struck aside from the trail? Was he alone in
danger?</p>

<p>As if in answer to the questions there came from far ahead of him a
loud cry. It was Black Roger's voice, and as he listened, it called over
and over again the Broken Man's name,</p>

<p>"Andre&mdash;Andre&mdash;Andre&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something in the cry held Carrigan. There was a note of terror in it,
a wild entreaty that was almost drowned in the trembling wind and the
moaning that was in the air. David was ready to turn back. He had already
approached too near to the red line of death, yet that cry of Black Roger
urged him on like the lash of a whip. He plunged ahead into the chaos of
smoke, no longer able to distinguish a trail under his feet. Twice again
in as many minutes he heard Black Roger's voice, and ran straight toward
it. The blood of the hunter rushed over all other things in his veins.
The man he wanted was ahead of him and the moment had passed when danger
or fear of death could drive him back. Where Black Roger lived, he could
live, and he gripped his club and ran through the low brush that whipped
in stinging lashes against his face and hands.</p>

<p>He came to the foot of a ridge, and from the top of this he knew Black
Roger had called. It was a huge hog's-back, rising a hundred feet up out
of the forest, and when he reached the top of it, he was panting for
breath. It was as if he had come suddenly within the blast of a hot
furnace. North and east the forest lay under him, and only the smoke
obstructed his vision. But through this smoke he could make out a thing
that made him rub his eyes in a fierce desire to see more clearly. A mile
away, perhaps two, the conflagration seemed to be splitting itself
against the tip of a mighty wedge. He could hear the roar of it to the
right of him and to the left, but dead ahead there was only a moaning
whirlpool of fire-heated wind and smoke. And out of this, as he looked,
came again the cry,</p>

<p>"Andre&mdash;Andre&mdash;Andre!"</p>

<p>Again he stared north and south through the smoke-gloom. Mountains of
resinous clouds, black as ink, were swirling skyward along the two sides
of the giant wedge. Under that death-pall the flames were sweeping
through the spruce and cedar tops like race-horses, hidden from his eyes.
If they closed in there could be no escape; in fifteen minutes they would
inundate him, and it would take him half an hour to reach the safety of
the clearing.</p>

<p>His heart thumped against his ribs as he hurried down the ridge in the
direction of Black Roger's voice. The giant wedge of the forest was not
burning&mdash;yet, and Audemard was hurrying like mad toward the tip of
that wedge, crying out now and then the name of the Broken Man. And
always he kept ahead, until at last&mdash;a mile from the
ridge&mdash;David came to the edge of a wide stream and saw what it was
that made the wedge of forest. For under his eyes the stream split, and
two arms of it widened out, and along each shore of the two streams was a
wide fire-clearing made by the axes of Black Roger's people, who had
foreseen this day when fire might sweep their world.</p>

<p>Carrigan dashed water into his eyes, and it was warm. Then he looked
across. The fire had passed, the pall of smoke was clearing away, and
what he saw was the black corpse of a world that had been green. It was
smoldering; the deep mold was afire. Little tongues of flame still licked
at ten thousand stubs charred by the fire-death&mdash;and there was no
wind here, and only the whisper of a distant moaning sweeping farther and
farther away.</p>

<p>And then, out of that waste across the river, David heard a terrible
cry. It was Black Roger, still calling&mdash;even in that place of
hopeless death&mdash;for Andre, the Broken Man!</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_27">XXVI</a></h3>

<p>Into the stream Carrigan plunged and found it only waist-deep in
crossing. He saw where Black Roger had come out of the water and where
his feet had plowed deep in the ash and char and smoldering debris ahead.
This trail he followed. The air he breathed was hot and filled with
stifling clouds of ash and char-dust and smoke. His feet struck red-hot
embers under the ash, and he smelled burning leather. A forest of spruce
and cedar skeletons still crackled and snapped and burst out into sudden
tongues of flame about him, and the air he breathed grew hotter, and his
face burned, and into his eyes came a smarting pain&mdash;when ahead of
him he saw Black Roger. He was no longer calling out the Broken Man's
name, but was crashing through the smoking chaos like a great beast that
had gone both blind and mad. Twice David turned aside where Black Roger
had rushed through burning debris, and a third time, following where
Audemard had gone, his feet felt the sudden stab of living coals. In
another moment he would have shouted Black Roger's name, but even as the
words were on his lips, mingled with a gasp of pain, the giant river-man
stopped where the forest seemed suddenly to end in a ghostly,
smoke-filled space, and when David came up behind him, he was standing at
the black edge of a cliff which leaped off into a smoldering valley
below.</p>

<p>Out of this narrow valley between two ridges, an hour ago choked with
living spruce and cedar, rose up a swirling, terrifying heat. Down into
this pit of death Black Roger stood looking, and David heard a strange
moaning coming in his breath. His great, bare arms were black and scarred
with heat; his hair was burned; his shirt was torn from his shoulders.
When David spoke&mdash;and Black Roger turned at the sound&mdash;his eyes
glared wildly out of a face that was like a black mask. And when he saw
it was David who had spoken, his great body seemed to sag, and with an
unintelligible cry he pointed down.</p>

<p>David, staring, saw nothing with his half-blind eyes, but under his
feet he felt a sudden giving way, and the fire-eaten tangle of earth and
roots broke off like a rotten ledge, and with it both he and Black Roger
went crashing into the depths below, smothered in an avalanche of ash and
sizzling earth. At the bottom David lay for a moment, partly stunned.
Then his fingers clutched a bit of living fire, and with a savage cry he
staggered to his feet and looked to see Black Roger. For a space his eyes
were blinded, and when at last he could see, he made out Black Roger,
fifty feet away, dragging himself on his hands and knees through the
blistering muck of the fire. And then, as he stared, the stricken giant
came to the charred remnant of a stump and crumpled over it with a great
cry, moaning again that name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Andre&mdash;Andre&mdash;"</p>

<p>David hurried to him, and as he put his hands under Black Roger's arms
to help him to his feet, he saw that the charred stump was not a stump,
but the fire-shriveled corpse of Andre, the Broken Man!</p>

<p>Horror choked back speech on his own lips. Black Roger looked up at
him, and a great breath came in a sob out of his body. Then, suddenly, he
seemed to get grip of himself, and his burned and bleeding fingers closed
about David's hand at his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I knew he was coming here," he said, the words forcing themselves
with an effort through his swollen lips. "He came home&mdash;to die."</p>

<p>"Home&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His mother and father were buried here nearly thirty years ago,
and he worshiped them. Look at him, Carrigan. Look at him closely. For he
is the man you have wanted all these years, the finest man God ever made,
Roger Audemard! When he saw the fire, he came to shield their graves from
the flames. And now he is dead!"</p>

<p>A moan came to his lips, and the weight of his body grew so heavy that
David had to exert his strength to keep him from falling.</p>

<p>"And YOU?" he cried. "For God's sake, Audemard&mdash;tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I, m'sieu? Why, I am only St. Pierre Audemard, his brother."</p>

<p>And with that his head dropped heavily, and he was like a dead man in
David's arms.</p>

<p>How at last David came to the edge of the stream again, with the
weight of St. Pierre Audemard on his shoulders, was a torturing nightmare
which would never be quite clear in his brain. The details were
obliterated in the vast agony of the thing. He knew that he fought as he
had never fought before; that he stumbled again and again in the
fire-muck; that he was burned, and blinded, and his brain was sick. But
he held to St. Pierre, with his twisted, broken leg, knowing that he
would die if he dropped him into the flesh-devouring heat of the
smoldering debris under his feet. Toward the end he was conscious of St.
Pierre's moaning, and then of his voice speaking to him. After that he
came to the water and fell down in the edge of it with St. Pierre, and
inside his head everything went as black as the world over which the fire
had swept.</p>

<p>He did not know how terribly he was hurt. He did not feel pain after
the darkness came. Yet he sensed certain things. He knew that over him
St. Pierre was shouting. For days, it seemed, he could hear nothing but
that great voice bellowing away in the interminable distance. And then
came other voices, now near and now far, and after that he seemed to rise
up and float among the clouds, and for a long time he heard no other
sound and felt no movement, but was like one dead.</p>

<p>Something soft and gentle and comforting roused him out of darkness.
He did not move, he did not open his eyes for a time, while reason came
to him. He heard a voice, and it was a woman's voice, speaking softly,
and another voice replied to it. Then he heard gentle movement, and some
one went away from him, and he heard the almost noiseless opening and
closing of a door. A very little he began to see. He was in a room, with
a patch of sunlight on the wall. Also, he was in a bed. And that gentle,
comforting hand was still stroking his forehead and hair, light as
thistledown. He opened his eyes wider and looked up. His heart gave a
great throb. Over him was a glorious, tender face smiling like an angel
into his widening eyes. And it was the face of Carmin Fanchet!</p>

<p>He made an effort, as if to speak.</p>

<p>"Hush," she whispered, and he saw something shining in her eyes, and
something wet fell upon his face. "She is returning&mdash;and I will go.
For three days and nights she has not slept, and she must be the first to
see you open your eyes."</p>

<p>She bent over him. Her soft lips touched his forehead, and he heard
her sobbing breath.</p>

<p>"God bless you, David Carrigan!"</p>

<p>Then she was going to the door, and his eyes dropped shut again. He
began to experience pain now, a hot, consuming pain all over him, and he
remembered the fight through the path of the fire. Then the door opened
very softly once more, and some one came in, and knelt down at his side,
and was so quiet that she scarcely seemed to breathe. He wanted to open
his eyes, to cry out a name, but he waited, and lips soft as velvet
touched his own. They lay there for a moment, then moved to his closed
eyes, his forehead, his hair&mdash;and after that something rested gently
against him.</p>

<p>His eyes shot open. It was Marie-Anne, with her head nestled in the
crook of his arm as she knelt there beside him on the floor. He could see
only a bit of her face, but her hair was very near, crumpled gloriously
on his breast, and he could see the tips of her long lashes as she
remained very still, seeming not to breathe. She did not know he had
roused from his sleep&mdash;the first sleep of those three days of
torture which he could not remember now; and he, looking at her, made no
movement to tell her he was awake. One of his hands lay over the edge of
the bed, and so lightly he could scarce feel the weight of her fingers
she laid one of her own upon it, and a little at a time drew it to her,
until the bandaged thing was against her lips. It was strange she did not
hear his heart, which seemed all at once to beat like a drum inside
him!</p>

<p>Suddenly he sensed the fact that his other hand was not bandaged. He
was lying on his side, with his right arm partly under him, and against
that hand he felt the softness of Marie-Anne's cheek, the velvety crush
of her hair!</p>

<p>And then he whispered, "Marie-Anne&mdash;"</p>

<p>She still lay, for a moment, utterly motionless. Then, slowly, as if
believing he had spoken her name in his sleep, she raised her head and
looked into his wide-open eyes. There was no word between them in that
breath or two. His bandaged hand and his well hand went to her face and
hair, and then a sobbing cry came from Marie- Anne, and swiftly she
crushed her face down to his, holding him close with both her arms for a
moment. And after that, as on that other day when she kissed him after
the fight, she was up and gone so quickly that her name had scarcely left
his lips when the door closed behind her, and he heard her running down
the hall.</p>

<p>He called after her, "Marie-Anne! Marie-Anne!"</p>

<p>He heard another door, and voices, and quick footsteps again, coming
his way, and he was waiting eagerly, half on his elbow, when into his
room came Nepapinas and Carmin Fanchet. And again he saw the glory of
something in the woman's face.</p>

<p>His eyes must have burned strangely as he stared at her, but it did
not change that light in her own, and her hands were wonderfully gentle
as she helped Nepapinas raise him so that he was sitting up straight,
with pillows at his back.</p>

<p>"It doesn't hurt so much now, does it?" she asked, her voice low with
a mothering tenderness.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No. What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"You were burned&mdash;terribly. For two days and nights you were in
great pain, but for many hours you have been sleeping, and Nepapinas says
the burns will not hurt any more. If it had not been for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She bent over him. Her hand touched his face, and now he began to
understand the meaning of that glory shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for you&mdash;he would have died!"</p>

<p>She drew back, turning to the door. "He is coming to see you&mdash;
alone," she said, a little broken note in her throat. "And I pray God you
will see with clear understanding, David Carrigan&mdash;and forgive
me&mdash;as I have forgiven you&mdash;for a thing that happened long
ago."</p>

<p>He waited. His head was in a jumble, and his thoughts were tumbling
over one another in an effort to evolve some sort of coherence out of
things amazing and unexpected. One thing was impressed upon him&mdash;he
had saved St. Pierre's life, and because he had done this Carmin Fanchet
was very tender to him. She had kissed him, and Marie-Anne had kissed
him, and&mdash;</p>

<p>A strange dawning was coming to him, thrilling him to his finger-
tips. He listened. A new sound was approaching from the hall. His door
was opened, and a wheel-chair was rolled in by old Nepapinas. In the
chair was St. Pierre Audemard. Feet and hands and arms were wrapped in
bandages, but his face was uncovered and wreathed in smiling happiness
when he saw David propped up against his pillows. Nepapinas rolled him
close to the bed and then shuffled out, and as he closed the door, David
was sure he heard the subdued whispering of feminine voices down the
hall.</p>

<p>"How are you, David?" asked St. Pierre.</p>

<p>"Fine," nodded Carrigan. "And you?"</p>

<p>"A bit scorched, and a broken leg." He held up his padded hands.
"Would be dead if you hadn't carried me to the river. Carmin says she
owes you her life for having saved mine."</p>

<p>"And Marie-Anne?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've come to tell you about," said St. Pierre. "The
instant they knew you were able to listen, both Carmin and Marie- Anne
insisted that I come and tell you things. But if you don't feel well
enough to hear me now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on!" almost threatened David.</p>

<p>The look of cheer which had illumined St. Pierre's face faded away,
and David saw in its place the lines of sorrow which had settled there.
He turned his gaze toward a window through which the afternoon sun was
coming, and nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"You saw&mdash;out there. He's dead. They buried him in a casket made
of sweet cedar. He loved the smell of that. He was like a little child.
And once&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;he was a splendid man, a greater and
better man than St. Pierre, his brother, will ever be. What he did was
right and just, M'sieu David. He was the oldest&mdash;sixteen&mdash; when
the thing happened. I was only nine, and didn't fully understand. But he
saw it all&mdash;the death of our father because a powerful factor wanted
my mother. And after that he knew how and why our mother died, but not a
word of it did he tell us until years later&mdash;after the day of
vengeance was past.</p>

<p>"You understand, David? He didn't want me in that. He did it alone,
with good friends from the upper north. He killed the murderers of our
mother and father, and then he buried himself deeper into the forests
with us, and we took our mother's family names which was Boulain, and
settled here on the Yellowknife. Roger&mdash;Black Roger, as you know
him&mdash;brought the bones of our father and mother and buried them over
in the edge of that plain where he died and where our first cabin stood.
Five years ago a falling tree crushed him out of shape, and his mind went
at the same time, so that he has been like a little child, and was always
seeking for Roger Audemard&mdash;the man he once was. That was the man
your law wanted. Roger Audemard. Our brother,"</p>

<p>"OUR brother," cried David. "Who is the other?"</p>

<p>"My sister."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Marie-Anne."</p>

<p>"Good God!" choked David. "St. Pierre, do you lie? Is this another bit
of trickery?"</p>

<p>"It is the truth," said St. Pierre. "Marie-Anne is my sister, and
Carmin&mdash;whom you saw in my arms through the cabin window&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, smiling into David's staring eyes, taking full measure of
recompense in the other's heart-breaking attitude as he waited.
"&mdash;Is my wife, M'sieu David."</p>

<p>A great gasp of breath came out of Carrigan.</p>

<p>"Yes, my wife, and the greatest-hearted woman that ever lived, without
one exception in all the world!" cried St. Pierre, a fierce pride in his
voice. "It was she, and not Marie-Anne, who shot you on that strip of
sand, David Carrigan! Mon Dieu, I tell you not one woman in a million
would have done what she did&mdash;let you live! Why? Listen, m'sieu, and
you will understand at last. She had a brother, years younger than she,
and to that brother she was mother, sister, everything, because they had
no parents almost from babyhood. She worshiped him. And he was bad. Yet
the worse he became, the more she loved him and prayed for him. Years ago
she became my wife, and I fought with her to save the brother. But he
belonged to the devil hand and foot, and at last he left us and went
south, and became what he was when you were sent out to get him, Sergeant
Carrigan. It was then that my wife went down to make a last fight to save
him, to bring him back, and you know how she made that fight,
m'sieu&mdash;until the day you hanged him!"</p>

<p>St. Pierre was leaning from his chair, his face ablaze. "Tell me, did
she not fight?" he cried. "And YOU, until the last&mdash;did you not
fight to have her put behind prison bars with her brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is so," murmured Carrigan.</p>

<p>"She hated you," went on St. Pierre. "You hanged her brother, who was
almost a part of her flesh and body. He was bad, but he had been hers
from babyhood, and a mother will love her son if he is a devil. And
then&mdash;I won't take long to tell the rest of it! Through friends she
learned that you, who had hanged her brother, were on your way to run
down Roger Audemard. And Roger Audemard, mind you, was the same as
myself, for I had sworn to take my brother's place if it became
necessary. She was on the bateau with Marie-Anne when the messenger came.
She had but one desire&mdash;to save me&mdash;to kill you. If it had been
some other man, but it was you, who had hanged her brother! She
disappeared from the bateau that day with a rifle. You know, M'sieu
David, what happened. Marie-Anne heard the shooting and
came&mdash;alone&mdash;just as you rolled out in the sand as if dead. It
was she who ran out to you first, while my Carmin crouched there with her
rifle, ready to send another bullet into you if you moved. It was
Marie-Anne you saw standing over you, it was she who knelt down at your
side, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>St. Pierre paused, and he smiled, and then grimaced as he tried to rub
his two bandaged hands together. "David, fate mixes things up in a funny
way. My Carmin came out and stood over you, hating you; and Marie-Anne
knelt down there at your side, loving you. Yes, it is true. And over you
they fought for life or death, and love won, because it is always
stronger than hate. Besides, as you lay there bleeding and helpless, you
looked different to my Carmin than as you did when you hanged her
brother. So they dragged you up under a tree, and after that they plotted
together and planned, while I was away up the river on the raft. The
feminine mind works strangely, M'sieu David, and perhaps it was that
thing we call intuition which made them do what they did. Marie-Anne knew
it would never do for you to see and recognize my Carmin, so in their
scheming of things she insisted on passing herself off as my wife, while
my Carmin came back in a canoe to meet me. They were frightened, and when
I came, the whole thing had gone too far for me to mend, and I knew the
false game must be played out to the end. When I saw what was
happening&mdash;that you loved Marie-Anne so well that you were willing
to fight for her honor even when you thought she was my wife&mdash;I was
sure it would all end well. But I could take no chances until I knew. And
so there were bars at your windows, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>St. Pierre shrugged his shoulders, and the lines of grief came into
his face again, and in his voice was a little break as he continued: "If
Roger had not gone out there to fight back the flames from the graves of
his dead, I had planned to tell you as much as I dared, M'sieu David, and
I had faith that your love for our sister would win. I did not tell you
on the river because I wanted you to see with your own eyes our paradise
up here, and I knew you would not destroy it once you were a part of it.
And so I could not tell you Carmin was my wife, for that would have
betrayed us&mdash;and&mdash;besides&mdash;that fight of yours against a
love which you thought was dishonest interested me very much, for I saw
in it a wonderful test of the man who might become my brother if he chose
wisely between love and what he thought was duty. I loved you for it,
even when you sat me there on the sand like a silly loon. And now, even
my Carmin loves you for bringing me out of the fire&mdash;But you are not
listening!"</p>

<p>David was looking past him toward the door, and St. Pierre smiled when
he saw the look that was in his face.</p>

<p>"Nepapinas!" he called loudly. "Nepapinas!"</p>

<p>In a moment there was shuffling of feet outside, and Nepapinas came
in. St. Pierre held out his two great, bandaged hands, and David met them
with his own, one bandaged and one free. Not a word was spoken between
them, but their eyes were the eyes of men between whom had suddenly come
the faith and understanding of a brotherhood as strong as life
itself.</p>

<p>Then Nepapinas wheeled St. Pierre from the room and David straightened
himself against his pillows, and waited, and listened, until it seemed
two hearts were thumping inside him in the place of one.</p>

<p>It was an interminable time, he thought, before Marie-Anne stood in
the doorway. For a breath she paused there, looking at him as he
stretched out his bandaged arm to her, moved by every yearning impulse in
her soul to come in, yet ready as a bird to fly away. And then, as he
called her name, she ran to him and dropped upon her knees at his side,
and his arms went about her, insensible to their hurt&mdash;and her hot
face was against his neck, and his lips crushed in the smothering
sweetness of her hair. He made no effort to speak, beyond that first
calling of her name. He could feel her heart throbbing against him, and
her hands tightened at his shoulders, and at last she raised her glorious
face so near that the breath of it was on his lips. Then, seeing what was
in his eyes, her soft mouth quivered in a little smile, and with a broken
throb in her throat she whispered,</p>

<p>"Has it all ended&mdash;right&mdash;David?"</p>

<p>He drew the red mouth to his own, and with a glad cry which was no
word in itself he buried his face in the lustrous tresses he loved.
Afterward he could not remember all it was that he said, but at the end
Marie-Anne had drawn a little away so that she was looking at him, her
eyes shining gloriously and her cheeks beautiful as the petals of a wild
rose. And he could see the throbbing in her white throat, like the
beating of a tiny heart.</p>

<p>"And you'll take me with you?" she whispered joyously.</p>

<p>"Yes; and when I show you to the old man&mdash;Superintendent Me Vane,
you know&mdash;and tell him you're my wife, he can't go back on his
promise. He said if I settled this Roger Audemard affair, I could have
anything I might ask for. And I'll ask for my discharge, I ought to have
it in September, and that will give us time to return before the snow
flies. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held out his arms again. "You see," he cried, his face smothered in
her hair again, "I've found the place of my dreams up here, and I want to
stay&mdash;always. Are you a little glad, Marie- Anne?"</p>

<p>In a great room at the end of the hall, with windows opening in three
directions upon the wilderness, St. Pierre waited in his wheel-chair,
grunting uneasily now and then at the long time it was taking Carmin to
discover certain things out in the hall. Finally he heard her coming,
tiptoeing very quietly from the direction of David Carrigan's door, and
St. Pierre chuckled and tried to rub his bandaged hands when she came in,
her face pink and her eyes shining with the greatest thrill that can stir
a feminine heart.</p>

<p>"If we'd only known," he tried to whisper, "I would have had the
keyhole made larger, Cherie! He deserves it for having spied on us at the
cabin window. But&mdash;tell me!&mdash;Could you see? Did you hear?
What&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carmin's soft hand went over his mouth. "In another moment you'll be
shouting," she warned. "Maybe I didn't see, and maybe I didn't hear, Big
Bear&mdash;but I know there are four very happy people in Chateau
Boulain. And now, if you want to guess who is the happiest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am, chere-coeur."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you insist&mdash;YOU are."</p>

<p>"Yes. And the next?"</p>

<p>St. Pierre chuckled. "David Carrigan," he said.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! If you mean that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;always&mdash;that I am second, unless you will ever let
me be first," corrected St. Pierre, kissing the hand that was gently
stroking his cheek.</p>

<p>And then he leaned his great head back against her where she stood
behind him, and Carmin's fingers ran where his hair was crisp with the
singe of fire, and for a long time they said no other word, but let their
eyes rest upon the dim length of the hall at the far end of which was
David Carrigan's room.</p>
