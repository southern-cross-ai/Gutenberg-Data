  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="note">Commenting upon one of my earlier novels, in respect of which
  I had claimed to have been careful to adhere to common probabilities and to
  have made use only of really practicable methods of investigation, a critic
  remarked that this was of no consequence whatever, so long as the story was
  amusing.</p>

  <p class="note">Few people, I imagine, will agree with him. To most readers,
  and certainly to the kind of reader for whom an author is willing to take
  trouble, complete realism in respect of incidents and methods is an essential
  factor in maintaining the interest of a detective story. Hence it may be
  worth while to mention that Thorndyke's method of producing the track chart,
  described in Chapters II and III, has been actually used in practice. It is a
  modification of one devised by me many years ago when I was crossing Ashanti
  to the city of Bontuku, the whereabouts of which in the far interior was then
  only vaguely known. My instructions were to fix the positions of all towns,
  villages, rivers and mountains as accurately as possible; but finding
  ordinary methods of surveying impracticable in the dense forest which covers
  the whole region, I adopted this simple and apparently rude method, checking
  the distances whenever possible by astronomical observation.</p>

  <p class="note">The resulting route-map was surprisingly accurate, as shown
  by the agreement of the outward and homeward tracks, It was published by the
  Royal Geographical Society, and incorporated in the map of this region
  compiled by the Intelligence Branch of the War Office, and it formed the
  basis of the map which accompanied my volume of <i>Travels in Ashanti and
  Jaman</i>. So that Thorndyke's plan must be taken as quite a practicable
  one.</p>

  <p class="note">New Inn, the background of this story, and one of the last
  surviving inns of Chancery, has recently passed away after upwards of four
  centuries of newness. Even now, however, a few of the old, dismantled houses
  (including perhaps, the mysterious 31) may be seen from the Strand peeping
  over the iron roof of the skating rink which has displaced the picturesque
  hall, the pension-room and the garden. The postern gate, too, in Houghton
  Street still remains, though the arch is bricked up inside. Passing it
  lately, I made the rough sketch which appears on next page, and which shows
  all that is left of this pleasant old London backwater.</p>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE MYSTERIOUS PATIENT</h2>

  <p class="first">AS I look back through the years of my association with John
  Thorndyke, I am able to recall a wealth of adventures and strange experiences
  such as falls to the lot of very few men who pass their lives within hearing
  of Big Ben. Many of these experiences I have already placed on record; but it
  now occurs to me that I have hitherto left unrecorded one that is, perhaps,
  the most astonishing and incredible of the whole series; an adventure, too,
  that has for me the added interest that it inaugurated my permanent
  association with my learned and talented friend, and marked the close of a
  rather unhappy and unprosperous period of my life.</p>

  <p>Memory, retracing the journey through the passing years to the
  starting-point of those strange events, lands me in a shabby little
  ground-floor room in a house near the Walworth end of Lower Kennington Lane.
  A couple of framed diplomas on the wall, a card of Snellen's test-types and a
  stethoscope lying on the writing-table, proclaim it a doctor's
  consulting-room; and my own position in the round-backed chair at the said
  table, proclaims me the practitioner in charge.</p>

  <p>It was nearly nine o'clock. The noisy little clock on the mantelpiece
  announced the fact, and, by its frantic ticking, seemed as anxious as I to
  get the consultation hours over. I glanced wistfully at my mud-splashed boots
  and wondered if I might yet venture to assume the slippers that peeped coyly
  from under the shabby sofa. I even allowed my thoughts to wander to the pipe
  that reposed in my coat pocket. Another minute and I could turn down the
  surgery gas and shut the outer door. The fussy little clock gave a sort of
  preliminary cough or hiccup, as if it should say: "Ahem! ladies and
  gentlemen, I am about to strike." And at that moment, the bottle-boy opened
  the door and, thrusting in his <a name="note-word"
     id="note-word"><!--Note Anchor word--></a>head, uttered the one word:
     "Gentleman."</p>

  <p>Extreme economy of words is apt to result in ambiguity. But I understood.
  In Kennington Lane, the race of mere men and women appeared to be extinct.
  They were all gentlemen&mdash;unless they were ladies or children&mdash;even
  as the Liberian army was said to consist entirely of generals. Sweeps,
  labourers, milkmen, costermongers&mdash;all were impartially invested by the
  democratic bottle-boy with the rank and title of <i>armigeri</i>. The present
  nobleman appeared to favour the aristocratic recreation of driving a cab or
  job-master's carriage, and, as he entered the room, he touched his hat,
  closed the door somewhat carefully, and then, without remark, handed me a
  note which bore the superscription "Dr. Stillbury."</p>

  <p>"You understand," I said, as I prepared to open the envelope, "that I am
  not Dr. Stillbury. He is away at present and I am looking after his
  patients."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't signify," the man replied. "You'll do as well."</p>

  <p>On this, I opened the envelope and read the note, which was quite brief,
  and, at first sight, in no way remarkable.</p>

  <p>"DEAR SIR," it ran, "Would you kindly come and see a friend of mine who is
  staying with me? The bearer of this will give you further particulars and
  convey you to the house. Yours truly, H. WEISS."</p>

  <p>There was no address on the paper and no date, and the writer was unknown
  to me.</p>

  <p>"This note," I said, "refers to some further particulars. What are
  they?"</p>

  <p>The messenger passed his hand over his hair with a gesture of
  embarrassment. "It's a ridicklus affair," he said, with a contemptuous laugh.
  "If I had been Mr. Weiss, I wouldn't have had nothing to do with it. The sick
  gentleman, Mr. Graves, is one of them people what can't abear doctors. He's
  been ailing now for a week or two, but nothing would induce him to see a
  doctor. Mr. Weiss did everything he could to persuade him, but it was no go.
  He wouldn't. However, it seems Mr. Weiss threatened to send for a medical man
  on his own account, because, you see, he was getting a bit nervous; and then
  Mr. Graves gave way. But only on one condition. He said the doctor was to
  come from a distance and was not to be told who he was or where he lived or
  anything about him; and he made Mr. Weiss promise to keep to that condition
  before he'd let him send. So Mr. Weiss promised, and, of course, he's got to
  keep his word."</p>

  <p>"But," I said, with a smile, "you've just told me his name&mdash;if his
  name really is Graves."</p>

  <p>"You can form your own opinion on that," said the coachman.</p>

  <p>"And," I added, "as to not being told where he lives, I can see that for
  myself. I'm not blind, you know."</p>

  <p>"We'll take the risk of what you see," the man replied. "The question is,
  will you take the job on?"</p>

  <p>Yes; that was the question, and I considered it for some time before
  replying. We medical men are pretty familiar with the kind of person who
  "can't abear doctors," and we like to have as little to do with him as
  possible. He is a thankless and unsatisfactory patient. Intercourse with him
  is unpleasant, he gives a great deal of trouble and responds badly to
  treatment. If this had been my own practice, I should have declined the case
  off-hand. But it was not my practice. I was only a deputy. I could not
  lightly refuse work which would yield a profit to my principal, unpleasant
  though it might be.</p>

  <p>As I turned the matter over in my mind, I half unconsciously scrutinized
  my visitor&mdash;somewhat to his embarrassment&mdash;and I liked his
  appearance as little as I liked his mission. He kept his station near the
  door, where the light was dim&mdash;for the illumination was concentrated on
  the table and the patient's chair&mdash;but I could see that he had a
  somewhat sly, unprepossessing face and a greasy, red moustache that seemed
  out of character with his rather perfunctory livery; though this was mere
  prejudice. He wore a wig, too&mdash;not that there was anything discreditable
  in that&mdash;and the thumb-nail of the hand that held his hat bore
  disfiguring traces of some injury&mdash;which, again, though unsightly, in no
  wise reflected on his moral character. Lastly, he watched me keenly with a
  mixture of anxiety and sly complacency that I found distinctly unpleasant. In
  a general way, he impressed me disagreeably. I did not like the look of him
  at all; but nevertheless I decided to undertake the case.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," I answered, at length, "it is no affair of mine who the
  patient is or where he lives. But how do you propose to manage the business?
  Am I to be led to the house blindfolded, like the visitor to the bandit's
  cave?"</p>

  <p>The man grinned slightly and looked very decidedly relieved.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he answered; "we ain't going to blindfold you. I've got a
  carriage outside. I don't think you'll see much out of that."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I rejoined, opening the door to let him out, "I'll be with
  you in a minute. I suppose you can't give me any idea as to what is the
  matter with the patient?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I can't," he replied; and he went out to see to the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>I slipped into a bag an assortment of emergency drugs and a few diagnostic
  instruments, turned down the gas and passed out through the surgery. The
  carriage was standing at the kerb, guarded by the coachman and watched with
  deep interest by the bottle-boy. I viewed it with mingled curiosity and
  disfavour. It was a kind of large brougham, such as is used by some
  commercial travellers, the usual glass windows being replaced by wooden
  shutters intended to conceal the piles of sample-boxes, and the doors capable
  of being locked from outside with a railway key.</p>

  <p>As I emerged from the house, the coachman unlocked the door and held it
  open.</p>

  <p>"How long will the journey take?" I asked, pausing with my foot on the
  step.</p>

  <p>The coachman considered a moment or two and replied:</p>

  <p>"It took me, I should say, nigh upon half an hour to get here."</p>

  <p>This was pleasant hearing. A half an hour each way and a half an hour at
  the patient's house. At that rate it would be half-past ten before I was home
  again, and then it was quite probable that I should find some other untimely
  messenger waiting on the doorstep. With a muttered anathema on the unknown
  Mr. Graves and the unrestful life of a locum tenens, I stepped into the
  uninviting vehicle. Instantly the coachman slammed the door and turned the
  key, leaving me in total darkness.</p>

  <p>One comfort was left to me; my pipe was in my pocket. I made shift to load
  it in the dark, and, having lit it with a wax match, took the opportunity to
  inspect the interior of my prison. It was a shabby affair. The moth-eaten
  state of the blue cloth cushions seemed to suggest that it had been long out
  of regular use; the oil-cloth floor-covering was worn into holes; ordinary
  internal fittings there were none. But the appearances suggested that the
  crazy vehicle had been prepared with considerable forethought for its present
  use. The inside handles of the doors had apparently been removed; the wooden
  shutters were permanently fixed in their places; and a paper label, stuck on
  the transom below each window, had a suspicious appearance of having been put
  there to cover the painted name and address of the job-master or
  livery-stable keeper who had originally owned the carriage.</p>

  <p>These observations gave me abundant food for reflection. This Mr. Weiss
  must be an excessively conscientious man if he had considered that his
  promise to Mr. Graves committed him to such extraordinary precautions.
  Evidently no mere following of the letter of the law was enough to satisfy
  his sensitive conscience. Unless he had reasons for sharing Mr. Graves's
  unreasonable desire for secrecy&mdash;for one could not suppose that these
  measures of concealment had been taken by the patient himself.</p>

  <p>The further suggestions that evolved themselves from this consideration
  were a little disquieting. Whither was I being carried and for what purpose?
  The idea that I was bound for some den of thieves where I might be robbed and
  possibly murdered, I dismissed with a smile. Thieves do not make elaborately
  concerted plans to rob poor devils like me. Poverty has its compensations in
  that respect. But there were other possibilities. Imagination backed by
  experience had no difficulty in conjuring up a number of situations in which
  a medical man might be called upon, with or without coercion, either to
  witness or actively to participate in the commission of some unlawful
  act.</p>

  <p>Reflections of this kind occupied me pretty actively if not very agreeably
  during this strange journey. And the monotony was relieved, too, by other
  distractions. I was, for example, greatly interested to notice how, when one
  sense is in abeyance, the other senses rouse into a compensating intensity of
  perception. I sat smoking my pipe in darkness which was absolute save for the
  dim glow from the smouldering tobacco in the bowl, and seemed to be cut off
  from all knowledge of the world without. But yet I was not. The vibrations of
  the carriage, with its hard springs and iron-tired wheels, registered
  accurately and plainly the character of the roadway. The harsh rattle of
  granite setts, the soft bumpiness of macadam, the smooth rumble of
  wood-pavement, the jarring and swerving of crossed tram-lines; all were
  easily recognizable and together sketched the general features of the
  neighbourhood through which I was passing. And the sense of hearing filled in
  the details. Now the hoot of a tug's whistle told of proximity to the river.
  A sudden and brief hollow reverberation announced the passage under a railway
  arch (which, by the way, happened several times during the journey); and,
  when I heard the familiar whistle of a railway-guard followed by the quick
  snorts of a skidding locomotive, I had as clear a picture of a heavy
  passenger-train moving out of a station as if I had seen it in broad
  daylight.</p>

  <p>I had just finished my pipe and knocked out the ashes on the heel of my
  boot, when the carriage slowed down and entered a covered way&mdash;as I
  could tell by the hollow echoes. Then I distinguished the clang of heavy
  wooden gates closed behind me, and a moment or two later the carriage door
  was unlocked and opened. I stepped out blinking into a covered passage paved
  with cobbles and apparently leading down to a mews; but it was all in
  darkness, and I had no time to make any detailed observations, as the
  carriage had drawn up opposite a side door which was open and in which stood
  a woman holding a lighted candle.</p>

  <p>"Is that the doctor?" she asked, speaking with a rather pronounced German
  accent and shading the candle with her hand as she peered at me.</p>

  <p>I answered in the affirmative, and she then exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come. Mr. Weiss will be so relieved. Come in,
  please."</p>

  <p>I followed her across a dark passage into a dark room, where she set the
  candle down on a chest of drawers and turned to depart. At the door, however,
  she paused and looked back.</p>

  <p>"It is not a very nice room to ask you into," she said. "We are very
  untidy just now, but you must excuse us. We have had so much anxiety about
  poor Mr. Graves."</p>

  <p>"He has been ill some time, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Some little time. At intervals, you know. Sometimes better,
  sometimes not so well."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she gradually backed out into the passage but did not go
  away at once. I accordingly pursued my inquiries.</p>

  <p>"He has not been seen by any doctor, has he?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, "he has always refused to see a doctor. That has been
  a great trouble to us. Mr. Weiss has been very anxious about him. He will be
  so glad to hear that you have come. I had better go and tell him. Perhaps you
  will kindly sit down until he is able to come to you," and with this she
  departed on her mission.</p>

  <p>It struck me as a little odd that, considering his anxiety and the
  apparent urgency of the case, Mr. Weiss should not have been waiting to
  receive me. And when several minutes elapsed without his appearing, the
  oddness of the circumstance impressed me still more. Having no desire, after
  the journey in the carriage, to sit down, I whiled away the time by an
  inspection of the room. And a very curious room it was; bare, dirty,
  neglected and, apparently, unused. A faded carpet had been flung untidily on
  the floor. A small, shabby table stood in the middle of the room; and beyond
  this, three horsehair-covered chairs and a chest of drawers formed the entire
  set of furniture. No pictures hung on the mouldy walls, no curtains covered
  the shuttered windows, and the dark drapery of cobwebs that hung from the
  ceiling to commemorate a long and illustrious dynasty of spiders hinted at
  months of neglect and disuse.</p>

  <p>The chest of drawers&mdash;an incongruous article of furniture for what
  seemed to be a dining-room&mdash;as being the nearest and best lighted object
  received most of my attention. It was a fine old chest of nearly black
  mahogany, very battered and in the last stage of decay, but originally a
  piece of some pretensions. Regretful of its fallen estate, I looked it over
  with some interest and had just observed on its lower corner a little label
  bearing the printed inscription "Lot 201" when I heard footsteps descending
  the stairs. A moment later the door opened and a shadowy figure appeared
  standing close by the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, doctor," said the stranger, in a deep, quiet voice and with
  a distinct, though not strong, German accent. "I must apologize for keeping
  you waiting."</p>

  <p>I acknowledged the apology somewhat stiffly and asked: "You are Mr. Weiss,
  I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am Mr. Weiss. It is very good of you to come so far and so late at
  night and to make no objection to the absurd conditions that my poor friend
  has imposed."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I replied. "It is my business to go when and where I am
  wanted, and it is not my business to inquire into the private affairs of my
  patients."</p>

  <p>"That is very true, sir," he agreed cordially, "and I am much obliged to
  you for taking that very proper view of the case. I pointed that out to my
  friend, but he is not a very reasonable man. He is very secretive and rather
  suspicious by nature."</p>

  <p>"So I inferred. And as to his condition; is he seriously ill?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Mr. Weiss, "that is what I want you to tell me. I am very much
  puzzled about him."</p>

  <p>"But what is the nature of his illness? What does he complain of?"</p>

  <p>"He makes very few complaints of any kind although he is obviously ill.
  But the fact is that he is hardly ever more than half awake. He lies in a
  kind of dreamy stupor from morning to night."</p>

  <p>This struck me as excessively strange and by no means in agreement with
  the patient's energetic refusal to see a doctor.</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "does he never rouse completely?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Mr. Weiss answered quickly; "he rouses from time to time and is
  then quite rational, and, as you may have gathered, rather obstinate. That is
  the peculiar and puzzling feature in the case; this alternation between a
  state of stupor and an almost normal and healthy condition. But perhaps you
  had better see him and judge for yourself. He had a rather severe attack just
  now. Follow me, please. The stairs are rather dark."</p>

  <p>The stairs were very dark, and I noticed that they were without any
  covering of carpet, or even oil-cloth, so that our footsteps resounded
  dismally as if we were in an empty house. I stumbled up after my guide,
  feeling my way by the hand-rail, and on the first floor followed him into a
  room similar in size to the one below and very barely furnished, though less
  squalid than the other. A single candle at the farther end threw its feeble
  light on a figure in the bed, leaving the rest of the room in a dim
  twilight.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Weiss tiptoed into the chamber, a woman&mdash;the one who had
  spoken to me below&mdash;rose from a chair by the bedside and quietly left
  the room by a second door. My conductor halted, and looking fixedly at the
  figure in the bed, called out:</p>

  <p>"Philip! Philip! Here is the doctor come to see you."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment or two, and, receiving no answer, said: "He seems
  to be dozing as usual. Will you go and see what you can make of him?"</p>

  <p>I stepped forward to the bedside, leaving Mr. Weiss at the end of the room
  near the door by which we had entered, where he remained, slowly and
  noiselessly pacing backwards and forwards in the semi-obscurity. By the light
  of the candle I saw an elderly man with good features and a refined,
  intelligent and even attractive face, but dreadfully emaciated, bloodless and
  sallow. He lay quite motionless except for the scarcely perceptible rise and
  fall of his chest; his eyes were nearly closed, his features relaxed, and,
  though he was not actually asleep, he seemed to be in a dreamy, somnolent,
  lethargic state, as if under the influence of some narcotic.</p>

  <p>I watched him for a minute or so, timing his slow breathing by my watch,
  and then suddenly and sharply addressed him by name; but the only response
  was a slight lifting of the eyelids, which, after a brief, drowsy glance at
  me, slowly subsided to their former position.</p>

  <p>I now proceeded to make a physical examination. First, I felt his pulse,
  grasping his wrist with intentional brusqueness in the hope of rousing him
  from his stupor. The beats were slow, feeble and slightly irregular, giving
  clear evidence, if any were needed, of his generally lowered vitality. I
  listened carefully to his heart, the sounds of which were very distinct
  through the thin walls of his emaciated chest, but found nothing abnormal
  beyond the feebleness and uncertainty of its action. Then I turned my
  attention to his eyes, which I examined closely with the aid of the candle
  and my ophthalmoscope lens, raising the lids somewhat roughly so as to expose
  the whole of the irides. He submitted without resistance to my rather
  ungentle handling of these sensitive structures, and showed no signs of
  discomfort even when I brought the candle-flame to within a couple of inches
  of his eyes.</p>

  <p>But this extraordinary tolerance of light was easily explained by closer
  examination; for the pupils were contracted to such an extreme degree that
  only the very minutest point of black was visible at the centre of the grey
  iris. Nor was this the only abnormal peculiarity of the sick man's eyes. As
  he lay on his back, the right iris sagged down slightly towards its centre,
  showing a distinctly concave surface; and, when I contrived to produce a
  slight but quick movement of the eyeball, a perceptible undulatory movement
  could be detected. The patient had, in fact, what is known as a tremulous
  iris, a condition that is seen in cases where the crystalline lens has been
  extracted for the cure of cataract, or where it has become accidentally
  displaced, leaving the iris unsupported. In the present case, the complete
  condition of the iris made it clear that the ordinary extraction operation
  had not been performed, nor was I able, on the closest inspection with the
  aid of my lens, to find any trace of the less common "needle operation." The
  inference was that the patient had suffered from the accident known as
  "dislocation of the lens"; and this led to the further inference that he was
  almost or completely blind in the right eye.</p>

  <p>This conclusion was, indeed, to some extent negatived by a deep
  indentation on the bridge of the nose, evidently produced by spectacles, and
  by marks which I looked for and found behind the ears, corresponding to the
  hooks or "curl sides" of the glasses. For those spectacles which are fitted
  with curl sides to hook over the ears are usually intended to be worn
  habitually, and this agreed with the indentation on the nose; which was
  deeper than would have been accounted for by the merely occasional use of
  spectacles for reading. But if only one eye was useful, a single eye-glass
  would have answered the purpose; not that there was any weight in this
  objection, for a single eye-glass worn constantly would be much less
  convenient than a pair of hook-sided spectacles.</p>

  <p>As to the nature of the patient's illness, only one opinion seemed
  possible. It was a clear and typical case of opium or morphine poisoning. To
  this conclusion all his symptoms seemed to point with absolute certainty. The
  coated tongue, which he protruded slowly and tremulously in response to a
  command bawled in his ear; his yellow skin and ghastly expression; his
  contracted pupils and the stupor from which he could hardly be roused by the
  roughest handling and which yet did not amount to actual insensibility; all
  these formed a distinct and coherent group of symptoms, not only pointing
  plainly to the nature of the drug, but also suggesting a very formidable
  dose.</p>

  <p>But this conclusion in its turn raised a very awkward and difficult
  question. If a large&mdash;a poisonous&mdash;dose of the drug had been taken,
  how, and by whom had that dose been administered? The closest scrutiny of the
  patient's arms and legs failed to reveal a single mark such as would be made
  by a hypodermic needle. This man was clearly no common morphinomaniac; and in
  the absence of the usual sprinkling of needlemarks, there was nothing to show
  or suggest whether the drug had been taken voluntarily by the patient himself
  or administered by someone else.</p>

  <p>And then there remained the possibility that I might, after all, be
  mistaken in my diagnosis. I felt pretty confident. But the wise man always
  holds a doubt in reserve. And, in the present case, having regard to the
  obviously serious condition of the patient, such a doubt was eminently
  disturbing. Indeed, as I pocketed my stethoscope and took a last look at the
  motionless, silent figure, I realized that my position was one of
  extraordinary difficulty and perplexity. On the one hand my
  suspicions&mdash;aroused, naturally enough, by the very unusual circumstances
  that surrounded my visit&mdash;inclined me to extreme reticence; while, on
  the other, it was evidently my duty to give any information that might prove
  serviceable to the patient.</p>

  <p>As I turned away from the bed Mr. Weiss stopped his slow pacing to and fro
  and faced me. The feeble light of the candle now fell on him, and I saw him
  distinctly for the first time. He did not impress me favourably. He was a
  thick-set, round-shouldered man, a typical fair German with tow-coloured
  hair, greased and brushed down smoothly, a large, ragged, sandy beard and
  coarse, sketchy features. His nose was large and thick with a bulbous end,
  and inclined to a reddish purple, a tint which extended to the adjacent parts
  of his face as if the colour had run. His eyebrows were large and beetling,
  overhanging deep-set eyes, and he wore a pair of spectacles which gave him a
  somewhat owlish expression. His exterior was unprepossessing, and I was in a
  state of mind that rendered me easily receptive of an unfavourable
  impression.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "what do you make of him?" I hesitated, still perplexed
  by the conflicting necessities of caution and frankness, but at length
  replied:</p>

  <p>"I think rather badly of him, Mr. Weiss. He is in a very low state."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can see that. But have you come to any decision as to the nature
  of his illness?"</p>

  <p>There was a tone of anxiety and suppressed eagerness in the question
  which, while it was natural enough in the circumstances, by no means allayed
  my suspicions, but rather influenced me on the side of caution.</p>

  <p>"I cannot give a very definite opinion at present," I replied guardedly.
  "The symptoms are rather obscure and might very well indicate several
  different conditions. They might be due to congestion of the brain, and, if
  no other explanation were possible, I should incline to that view. The
  alternative is some narcotic poison, such as opium or morphia."</p>

  <p>"But that is quite impossible. There is no such drug in the house, and as
  he never leaves his room now, he could not get any from outside."</p>

  <p>"What about the servants?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There are no servants excepting my housekeeper, and she is absolutely
  trustworthy."</p>

  <p>"He might have some store of the drug that you are not aware of. Is he
  left alone much?"</p>

  <p>"Very seldom indeed. I spend as much time with him as I can, and when I am
  not able to be in the room, Mrs Schallibaum, my housekeeper, sits with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Is he often as drowsy as he is now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, very often; in fact, I should say that is his usual condition. He
  rouses up now and again, and then he is quite lucid and natural for, perhaps,
  an hour or so; but presently he becomes drowsy again and doses off, and
  remains asleep, or half asleep, for hours on end. Do you know of any disease
  that takes people in that way?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "The symptoms are not exactly like those of any disease
  that is known to me. But they are much very like those of opium
  poisoning."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear sir," Mr. Weiss retorted impatiently, "since it is clearly
  impossible that it can be opium poisoning, it must be something else. Now,
  what else can it be? You were speaking of congestion of the brain."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the objection to that is the very complete recovery that seems
  to take place in the intervals."</p>

  <p>"I would not say very complete," said Mr. Weiss. "The recovery is rather
  comparative. He is lucid and fairly natural in his manner, but he is still
  dull and lethargic. He does not, for instance, show any desire to go out, or
  even to leave his room."</p>

  <p>I pondered uncomfortably on these rather contradictory statements. Clearly
  Mr. Weiss did not mean to entertain the theory of opium poisoning; which was
  natural enough if he had no knowledge of the drug having been used. But
  still&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Mr. Weiss, "you have experience of sleeping
  sickness?"</p>

  <p>The suggestion startled me. I had not. Very few people had. At that time
  practically nothing was known about the disease. It was a mere pathological
  curiosity, almost unheard of excepting by a few practitioners in remote parts
  of Africa, and hardly referred to in the text-books. Its connection with the
  trypanosome-bearing insects was as yet unsuspected, and, to me, its symptoms
  were absolutely unknown.</p>

  <p>"No, I have not," I replied. "The disease is nothing more than a name to
  me. But why do you ask? Has Mr. Graves been abroad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He has been travelling for the last three or four years, and I know
  that he spent some time recently in West Africa, where this disease occurs.
  In fact, it was from him that I first heard about it."</p>

  <p>This was a new fact. It shook my confidence in my diagnosis very
  considerably, and inclined me to reconsider my suspicions. If Mr. Weiss was
  lying to me, he now had me at a decided disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" he asked. "Is it possible that this can be sleeping
  sickness?"</p>

  <p>"I should not like to say that it is impossible," I replied. "The disease
  is practically unknown to me. I have never practised out of England and have
  had no occasion to study it. Until I have looked the subject up, I should not
  be in a position to give an opinion. Of course, if I could see Mr. Graves in
  one of what we may call his 'lucid intervals' I should be able to form a
  better idea. Do you think that could be managed?"</p>

  <p>"It might. I see the importance of it and will certainly do my best; but
  he is a difficult man; a very difficult man. I sincerely hope it is not
  sleeping sickness."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;as I understood from him&mdash;that disease is invariably
  fatal, sooner or later. There seem to be no cure. Do you think you will be
  able to decide when you see him again?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," I replied. "I shall look up the authorities and see exactly
  what the symptoms are&mdash;that is, so far as they are known; but my
  impression is that there is very little information available."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime?"</p>

  <p>"We will give him some medicine and attend to his general condition, and
  you had better let me see him again as soon as possible." I was about to say
  that the effect of the medicine itself might throw some light on the
  patient's condition, but, as I proposed to treat him for morphine poisoning,
  I thought it wiser to keep this item of information to myself. Accordingly, I
  confined myself to a few general directions as to the care of the patient, to
  which Mr. Weiss listened attentively. "And," I concluded, "we must not lose
  sight of the opium question. You had better search the room carefully and
  keep a close watch on the patient, especially during his intervals of
  wakefulness."</p>

  <p>"Very well, doctor," Mr. Weiss replied, "I will do all that you tell me
  and I will send for you again as soon as possible, if you do not object to
  poor Graves's ridiculous conditions. And now, if you will allow me to pay
  your fee, I will go and order the carriage while you are writing the
  prescription."</p>

  <p>"There is no need for a prescription," I said. "I will make up some
  medicine and give it to the coachman."</p>

  <p>Mr. Weiss seemed inclined to demur to this arrangement, but I had my own
  reasons for insisting on it. Modern prescriptions are not difficult to read,
  and I did not wish Mr. Weiss to know what treatment the patient was
  having.</p>

  <p>As soon as I was left alone, I returned to the bedside and once more
  looked down at the impassive figure. And as I looked, my suspicions revived.
  It was very like morphine poisoning; and, if it was morphine, it was no
  common, medicinal dose that had been given. I opened my bag and took out my
  hypodermic case from which I extracted a little tube of atropine tabloids.
  Shaking out into my hand a couple of the tiny discs, I drew down the
  patient's under-lip and slipped the little tablets under his tongue. Then I
  quickly replaced the tube and dropped the case into my bag; and I had hardly
  done so when the door opened softly and the housekeeper entered the room.</p>

  <p>"How do you find Mr. Graves?" she asked in what I thought a very
  unnecessarily low tone, considering the patient's lethargic state.</p>

  <p>"He seems to be very ill," I answered.</p>

  <p>"So!" she rejoined, and added: "I am sorry to hear that. We have been
  anxious about him."</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the chair by the bedside, and, shading the candle
  from the patient's face&mdash;and her own, too&mdash;produced from a bag that
  hung from her waist a half-finished stocking and began to knit silently and
  with the skill characteristic of the German housewife. I looked at her
  attentively (though she was so much in the shadow that I could see her but
  indistinctly) and somehow her appearance prepossessed me as little as did
  that of the other members of the household. Yet she was not an ill-looking
  woman. She had an excellent figure, and the air of a person of good social
  position; her features were good enough and her colouring, although a little
  unusual, was not unpleasant. Like Mr. Weiss, she had very fair hair, greased,
  parted in the middle and brushed down as smoothly as the painted hair of a
  Dutch doll. She appeared to have no eyebrows at all&mdash;owing, no doubt, to
  the light colour of the hair&mdash;and the doll-like character was emphasized
  by her eyes, which were either brown or dark grey, I could not see which. A
  further peculiarity consisted in a "habit spasm," such as one often sees in
  nervous children; a periodical quick jerk of the head, as if a cap-string or
  dangling lock were being shaken off the cheek. Her age I judged to be about
  thirty-five.</p>

  <p>The carriage, which one might have expected to be waiting, seemed to take
  some time in getting ready. I sat, with growing impatience, listening to the
  sick man's soft breathing and the click of the housekeeper's
  knitting-needles. I wanted to get home, not only for my own sake; the
  patient's condition made it highly desirable that the remedies should be
  given as quickly as possible. But the minutes dragged on, and I was on the
  point of expostulating when a bell rang on the landing.</p>

  <p>"The carriage is ready," said Mrs. Schallibaum. "Let me light you down the
  stairs."</p>

  <p>She rose, and, taking the candle, preceded me to the head of the stairs,
  where she stood holding the light over the baluster-rail as I descended and
  crossed the passage to the open side door. The carriage was drawn up in the
  covered way as I could see by the faint glimmer of the distant candle; which
  also enabled me dimly to discern the coachman standing close by in the
  shadow. I looked round, rather expecting to see Mr. Weiss, but, as he made no
  appearance, I entered the carriage. The door was immediately banged to and
  locked, and I then heard the heavy bolts of the gates withdrawn and the loud
  creaking of hinges. The carriage moved out slowly and stopped; the gates
  slammed to behind me; I felt the lurch as the coachman climbed to his seat
  and we started forward.</p>

  <p>My reflections during the return journey were the reverse of agreeable. I
  could not rid myself of the conviction that I was being involved in some very
  suspicious proceedings. It was possible, of course, that this feeling was due
  to the strange secrecy that surrounded my connection with this case; that,
  had I made my visit under ordinary conditions, I might have found in the
  patient's symptoms nothing to excite suspicion or alarm. It might be so, but
  that consideration did not comfort me.</p>

  <p>Then, my diagnosis might be wrong. It might be that this was, in reality,
  a case of some brain affection accompanied by compression, such as slow
  haemorrhage, abscess, tumour or simple congestion. These cases were very
  difficult at times. But the appearances in this one did not consistently
  agree with the symptoms accompanying any of these conditions. As to sleeping
  sickness, it was, perhaps a more hopeful suggestion, but I could not decide
  for or against it until I had more knowledge; and against this view was the
  weighty fact that the symptoms did exactly agree with the theory of morphine
  poisoning.</p>

  <p>But even so, there was no conclusive evidence of any criminal act. The
  patient might be a confirmed opium-eater, and the symptoms heightened by
  deliberate deception. The cunning of these unfortunates is proverbial and is
  only equalled by their secretiveness and mendacity. It would be quite
  possible for this man to feign profound stupor so long as he was watched, and
  then, when left alone for a few minutes, to nip out of bed and help himself
  from some secret store of the drug. This would be quite in character with his
  objection to seeing a doctor and his desire for secrecy. But still, I did not
  believe it to be the true explanation. In spite of all the various
  alternative possibilities, my suspicions came back to Mr. Weiss and the
  strange, taciturn woman, and refused to budge.</p>

  <p>For all the circumstances of the case were suspicious. The elaborate
  preparations implied by the state of the carriage in which I was travelling;
  the make-shift appearance of the house; the absence of ordinary domestic
  servants, although a coachman was kept; the evident desire of Mr. Weiss and
  the woman to avoid thorough inspection of their persons; and, above all, the
  fact that the former had told me a deliberate lie. For he had lied, beyond
  all doubt. His statement as to the almost continuous stupor was absolutely
  irreconcilable with his other statement as to the patient's wilfulness and
  obstinacy and even more irreconcilable with the deep and comparatively fresh
  marks of the spectacles on the patient's nose. That man had certainly worn
  spectacles within twenty-four hours, which he would hardly have done if he
  had been in a state bordering on coma.</p>

  <p>My reflections were interrupted by the stopping of the carriage. The door
  was unlocked and thrown open, and I emerged from my dark and stuffy prison
  opposite my own house.</p>

  <p>"I will let you have the medicine in a minute or two," I said to the
  coachman; and, as I let myself in with my latch-key, my mind came back
  swiftly from the general circumstances of the case to the very critical
  condition of the patient. Already I was regretting that I had not taken more
  energetic measures to rouse him and restore his flagging vitality; for it
  would be a terrible thing if he should take a turn for the worse and die
  before the coachman returned with the remedies. Spurred on by this alarming
  thought, I made up the medicines quickly and carried the hastily wrapped
  bottles out to the man, whom I found standing by the horse's head.</p>

  <p>"Get back as quickly as you can," I said, "and tell Mr. Weiss to lose no
  time in giving the patient the draught in the small bottle. The directions
  are on the labels."</p>

  <p>The coachman took the packages from me without reply, climbed to his seat,
  touched the horse with his whip and drove off at a rapid pace towards
  Newington Butts.</p>

  <p>The little clock in the consulting-room showed that it was close on
  eleven; time for a tired G.P. to be thinking of bed. But I was not sleepy.
  Over my frugal supper I found myself taking up anew the thread of my
  meditations, and afterwards, as I smoked my last pipe by the expiring surgery
  fire, the strange and sinister features of the case continued to obtrude
  themselves on my notice. I looked up Stillbury's little reference library for
  information on the subject of sleeping sickness, but learned no more than
  that it was "a rare and obscure disease of which very little was known at
  present." I read up morphine poisoning and was only further confirmed in the
  belief that my diagnosis was correct; which would have been more satisfactory
  if the circumstances had been different.</p>

  <p>For the interest of the case was not merely academic. I was in a position
  of great difficulty and responsibility and had to decide on a course of
  action. What ought I to do? Should I maintain the professional secrecy to
  which I was tacitly committed, or ought I to convey a hint to the police?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, and with a singular feeling of relief, I bethought myself of my
  old friend and fellow-student, John Thorndyke, now an eminent authority on
  Medical Jurisprudence. I had been associated with him temporarily in one case
  as his assistant, and had then been deeply impressed by his versatile
  learning, his acuteness and his marvellous resourcefulness. Thorndyke was a
  barrister in extensive practice, and so would be able to tell me at once what
  was my duty from a legal point of view; and, as he was also a doctor of
  medicine, he would understand the exigencies of medical practice. If I could
  find time to call at the Temple and lay the case before him, all my doubts
  and difficulties would be resolved.</p>

  <p>Anxiously, I opened my visiting-list to see what kind of day's work was in
  store for me on the morrow. It was not a heavy day, even allowing for one or
  two extra calls in the morning, but yet I was doubtful whether it would allow
  of my going so far from my district, until my eye caught, near the foot of
  the page, the name of Burton. Now Mr. Burton lived in one of the old houses
  on the east side of Bouverie Street, less than five minutes' walk from
  Thorndyke's chambers in King's Bench Walk; and he was, moreover, a "chronic"
  who could safely be left for the last. When I had done with Mr. Burton I
  could look in on my friend with a very good chance of catching him on his
  return from the hospital. I could allow myself time for quite a long chat
  with him, and, by taking a hansom, still get back in good time for the
  evening's work.</p>

  <p>This was a great comfort. At the prospect of sharing my responsibilities
  with a friend on whose judgment I could so entirely rely, my embarrassments
  seemed to drop from me in a moment. Having entered the engagement in my
  visiting-list, I rose, in greatly improved spirits, and knocked out my pipe
  just as the little clock banged out impatiently the hour of midnight.</p>

  <h2>II. &mdash; THORNDYKE DEVISES A SCHEME</h2>

  <p class="first">AS I entered the Temple by the Tudor Street gate the aspect
  of the place smote my senses with an air of agreeable familiarity. Here had I
  spent many a delightful hour when working with Thorndyke at the remarkable
  Hornby case, which the newspapers had called "The Case of the Red Thumb
  Mark"; and here had I met the romance of my life, the story whereof is told
  elsewhere. The place was thus endeared to me by pleasant recollections of a
  happy past, and its associations suggested hopes of happiness yet to come and
  in the not too far distant future.</p>

  <p>My brisk tattoo on the little brass knocker brought to the door no less a
  person than Thorndyke himself; and the warmth of his greeting made me at once
  proud and ashamed. For I had not only been an absentee; I had been a very
  poor correspondent.</p>

  <p>"The prodigal has returned, Polton," he exclaimed, looking into the room.
  "Here is Dr. Jervis."</p>

  <p>I followed him into the room and found Polton&mdash;his confidential
  servant, laboratory assistant, artificer and general "familiar"&mdash;setting
  out the tea-tray on a small table. The little man shook hands cordially with
  me, and his face crinkled up into the sort of smile that one might expect to
  see on a benevolent walnut.</p>

  <p>"We've often talked about you, sir," said he. "The doctor was wondering
  only yesterday when you were coming back to us."</p>

  <p>As I was not "coming back to them" quite in the sense intended I felt a
  little guilty, but reserved my confidences for Thorndyke's ear and replied in
  polite generalities. Then Polton fetched the tea-pot from the laboratory,
  made up the fire and departed, and Thorndyke and I subsided, as of old, into
  our respective arm-chairs.</p>

  <p>"And whence do you spring from in this unexpected fashion?" my colleague
  asked. "You look as if you had been making professional visits."</p>

  <p>"I have. The base of operations is in Lower Kennington Lane."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Then you are 'back once more on the old trail'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, with a laugh, "'the old trail, the long trail, the
  trail that is always new.'"</p>

  <p>"And leads nowhere," Thorndyke added grimly.</p>

  <p>I laughed again; not very heartily, for there was an uncomfortable element
  of truth in my friend's remark, to which my own experience bore only too
  complete testimony. The medical practitioner whose lack of means forces him
  to subsist by taking temporary charge of other men's practices is apt to find
  that the passing years bring him little but grey hairs and a wealth of
  disagreeable experience.</p>

  <p>"You will have to drop it, Jervis; you will, indeed," Thorndyke resumed
  after a pause. "This casual employment is preposterous for a man of your
  class and professional attainments. Besides, are you not engaged to be
  married and to a most charming girl?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. I have been a fool. But I will really amend my ways. If
  necessary, I will pocket my pride and let Juliet advance the money to buy a
  practice."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "is a very proper resolution. Pride and reserve
  between people who are going to be husband and wife, is an absurdity. But why
  buy a practice? Have you forgotten my proposal?"</p>

  <p>"I should be an ungrateful brute if I had."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I repeat it now. Come to me as my junior, read for the Bar and
  work with me, and, with your abilities, you will have a chance of something
  like a career. I want you, Jervis," he added, earnestly. "I must have a
  junior, with my increasing practice, and you are the junior I want. We are
  old and tried friends; we have worked together; we like and trust one
  another, and you are the best man for the job that I know. Come; I am not
  going to take a refusal. This is an ultimatum."</p>

  <p>"And what is the alternative?" I asked with a smile at his eagerness.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any. You are going to say yes."</p>

  <p>"I believe I am," I answered, not without emotion; "and I am more rejoiced
  at your offer and more grateful than I can tell you. But we must leave the
  final arrangements for our next meeting&mdash;in a week or so, I
  hope&mdash;for I have to be back in an hour, and I want to consult you on a
  matter of some importance."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "we will leave the formal agreement for
  consideration at our next meeting. What is it that you want my opinion
  on?"</p>

  <p>"The fact is," I said, "I am in a rather awkward dilemma, and I want you
  to tell me what you think I ought to do."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke paused in the act of refilling my cup and glanced at me with
  unmistakable anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of an unpleasant nature, I hope," said he.</p>

  <p>"No, no; nothing of that kind," I answered with a smile as I interpreted
  the euphemism; for "something unpleasant," in the case of a young and
  reasonably presentable medical man is ordinarily the equivalent of trouble
  with the female of his species. "It is nothing that concerns me personally at
  all," I continued; "it is a question of professional responsibility. But I
  had better give you an account of the affair in a complete narrative, as I
  know that you like to have your data in a regular and consecutive order."</p>

  <p>Thereupon I proceeded to relate the history of my visit to the mysterious
  Mr. Graves, not omitting any single circumstance or detail that I could
  recollect.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke listened from the very beginning of my story with the closest
  attention. His face was the most impassive that I have ever seen; ordinarily
  as inscrutable as a bronze mask; but to me, who knew him intimately, there
  was a certain something&mdash;a change of colour, perhaps, or an additional
  sparkle of the eye&mdash;that told me when his curious passion for
  investigation was fully aroused. And now, as I told him of that weird journey
  and the strange, secret house to which it had brought me, I could see that it
  offered a problem after his very heart. During the whole of my narration he
  sat as motionless as a statue, evidently committing the whole story to
  memory, detail by detail; and even when I had finished he remained for an
  appreciable time without moving or speaking.</p>

  <p>At length he looked up at me. "This is a very extraordinary affair,
  Jervis," he said.</p>

  <p>"Very," I agreed; "and the question that is agitating me is, what is to be
  done?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, meditatively, "that is the question; and an uncommonly
  difficult question it is. It really involves the settlement of the antecedent
  question: What is it that is happening at that house?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think is happening at that house?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"We must go slow, Jervis," he replied. "We must carefully separate the
  legal tissues from the medical, and avoid confusing what we know with what we
  suspect. Now, with reference to the medical aspects of the case. The first
  question that confronts us is that of sleeping sickness, or negro-lethargy as
  it is sometimes called; and here we are in a difficulty. We have not enough
  knowledge. Neither of us, I take it, has ever seen a case, and the extant
  descriptions are inadequate. From what I know of the disease, its symptoms
  agree with those in your case in respect of the alleged moroseness and in the
  gradually increasing periods of lethargy alternating with periods of apparent
  recovery. On the other hand, the disease is said to be confined to negroes;
  but that probably means only that negroes alone have hitherto been exposed to
  the conditions that produce it. A more important fact is that, as far as I
  know, extreme contraction of the pupils is not a symptom of sleeping
  sickness. To sum up, the probabilities are against sleeping sickness, but
  with our insufficient knowledge, we cannot definitely exclude it."</p>

  <p>"You think that it may really be sleeping sickness?"</p>

  <p>"No; personally I do not entertain that theory for a moment. But I am
  considering the evidence apart from our opinions on the subject. We have to
  accept it as a conceivable hypothesis that it may be sleeping sickness
  because we cannot positively prove that it is not. That is all. But when we
  come to the hypothesis of morphine poisoning, the case is different. The
  symptoms agree with those of morphine poisoning in every respect. There is no
  exception or disagreement whatever. The common sense of the matter is
  therefore that we adopt morphine poisoning as our working diagnosis; which is
  what you seem to have done."</p>

  <p>"Yes. For purposes of treatment."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. For medical purposes you adopted the more probable view and
  dismissed the less probable. That was the reasonable thing to do. But for
  legal purposes you must entertain both possibilities; for the hypothesis of
  poisoning involves serious legal issues, whereas the hypothesis of disease
  involves no legal issues at all."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't sound very helpful," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"It indicates the necessity for caution," he retorted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that. But what is your own opinion of the case?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "let us consider the facts in order. Here is a man who,
  we assume, is under the influence of a poisonous dose of morphine. The
  question is, did he take that dose himself or was it administered to him by
  some other person? If he took it himself, with what object did he take it?
  The history that was given to you seems completely to exclude the idea of
  suicide. But the patient's condition seems equally to exclude the idea of
  morphinomania. Your opium-eater does not reduce himself to a state of coma.
  He usually keeps well within the limits of the tolerance that has been
  established. The conclusion that emerges is, I think, that the drug was
  administered by some other person; and the most likely person seems to be Mr.
  Weiss."</p>

  <p>"Isn't morphine a very unusual poison?"</p>

  <p>"Very; and most inconvenient except in a single, fatal dose, by reason of
  the rapidity with which tolerance of the drug is established. But we must not
  forget that slow morphine poisoning might be eminently suitable in certain
  cases. The manner in which it enfeebles the will, confuses the judgment and
  debilitates the body might make it very useful to a poisoner whose aim was to
  get some instrument or document executed, such as a will, deed or assignment.
  And death could be produced afterwards by other means. You see the important
  bearing of this?"</p>

  <p>"You mean in respect of a death certificate?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Suppose Mr. Weiss to have given a large dose of morphine. He then
  sends for you and throws out a suggestion of sleeping sickness. If you accept
  the suggestion he is pretty safe. He can repeat the process until he kills
  his victim and then get a certificate from you which will cover the murder.
  It was quite an ingenious scheme&mdash;which, by the way, is characteristic
  of intricate crimes; your subtle criminal often plans his crime like a
  genius, but he generally executes it like a fool&mdash;as this man seems to
  have done, if we are not doing him an injustice."</p>

  <p>"How has he acted like a fool?"</p>

  <p>"In several respects. In the first place, he should have chosen his
  doctor. A good, brisk, confident man who 'knows his own mind' is the sort of
  person who would have suited him; a man who would have jumped at a diagnosis
  and stuck to it; or else an ignorant weakling of alcoholic tendencies. It was
  shockingly bad luck to run against a cautious scientific practitioner like my
  learned friend. Then, of course, all this secrecy was sheer tomfoolery,
  exactly calculated to put a careful man on his guard; as it has actually
  done. If Mr. Weiss is really a criminal, he has mismanaged his affairs
  badly."</p>

  <p>"And you apparently think that he is a criminal?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect him deeply. But I should like to ask you one or two questions
  about him. You say he spoke with a German accent. What command of English had
  he? Was his vocabulary good? Did he use any German idioms?"</p>

  <p>"No. I should say that his English was perfect, and I noticed that his
  phrases were quite well chosen even for an Englishman."</p>

  <p>"Did he seem to you 'made up' in any way; disguised, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't say. The light was so very feeble."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't see the colour of his eyes, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"No. I think they were grey, but I couldn't be sure."</p>

  <p>"And as to the coachman. He wore a wig, you said. Could you see the colour
  of his eyes? Or any peculiarity by which you could recognize him?"</p>

  <p>"He had a malformed thumb-nail on his right hand. That is all I can say
  about him."</p>

  <p>"He didn't strike you as resembling Weiss in any way; in voice or
  features?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all; and he spoke, as I told you, with a distinct Scotch
  accent."</p>

  <p>"The reason I ask is that if Weiss is attempting to poison this man, the
  coachman is almost certain to be a confederate and might be a relative. You
  had better examine him closely if you get another chance."</p>

  <p>"I will. And that brings me back to the question, What am I to do? Ought I
  to report the case to the police?"</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to think not. You have hardly enough facts. Of course, if
  Mr. Weiss has administered poison 'unlawfully and maliciously' he has
  committed a felony, and is liable under the Consolidation Acts of 1861 to ten
  years' penal servitude. But I do not see how you could swear an information.
  You don't know that he administered the poison&mdash;if poison has really
  been administered&mdash;and you cannot give any reliable name or any address
  whatever. Then there is the question of sleeping sickness. You reject it for
  medical purposes, but you could not swear, in a court of law, that this is
  not a case of sleeping sickness."</p>

  <p>"No," I admitted, "I could not."</p>

  <p>"Then I think the police would decline to move in the matter, and you
  might find that you had raised a scandal in Dr. Stillbury's practice to no
  purpose."</p>

  <p>"So you think I had better do nothing in the matter?"</p>

  <p>"For the present. It is, of course, a medical man's duty to assist justice
  in any way that is possible. But a doctor is not a detective; he should not
  go out of his way to assume police functions. He should keep his eyes and
  ears open, and, though, in general, he should keep his own counsel, it is his
  duty to note very carefully anything that seems to him likely to bear on any
  important legal issues. It is not his business officiously to initiate
  criminal inquiries, but it is emphatically his business to be ready, if
  called upon, to assist justice with information that his special knowledge
  and opportunities have rendered accessible to him. You see the bearing of
  this?"</p>

  <p>"You mean that I should note down what I have seen and heard and say
  nothing about it until I am asked."</p>

  <p>"Yes; if nothing further happens. But if you should be sent for again, I
  think it is your duty to make further observations with a view, if necessary,
  to informing the police. It may be, for instance, of vital importance to
  identify the house, and it is your duty to secure the means of doing so."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Thorndyke," I expostulated, "I have told you how I was
  conveyed to the house. Now, will you kindly explain to me how a man, boxed up
  in a pitch-dark carriage, is going to identify any place to which he may be
  carried?"</p>

  <p>"The problem doesn't appear to me to present any serious difficulties," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it?" said I. "To me it looks like a pretty solid impossibility.
  But what do you suggest? Should I break out of the house and run away up the
  street? Or should I bore a hole through the shutter of the carriage and peep
  out?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. "The methods proposed by my learned friend
  display a certain crudity inappropriate to the character of a man of science;
  to say nothing of the disadvantage of letting the enemy into our counsels.
  No, no, Jervis; we can do something better than that. Just excuse me for a
  minute while I run up to the laboratory."</p>

  <p>He hurried away to Polton's sanctum on the upper floor, leaving me to
  speculate on the method by which he proposed that a man should be enabled, as
  Sam Weller would express it, "to see through a flight of stairs and a deal
  door"; or, what was equally opaque, the wooden shutters of a closed
  carriage.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, when he returned a couple of minutes later with a small,
  paper-covered notebook in his hand, "I have set Polton to work on a little
  appliance that will, I think, solve our difficulty, and I will show you how I
  propose that you should make your observations. First of all, we have to rule
  the pages of this book into columns."</p>

  <p>He sat down at the table and began methodically to rule the pages each
  into three columns, two quite narrow and one broad. The process occupied some
  time, during which I sat and watched with impatient curiosity the unhurried,
  precise movements of Thorndyke's pencil, all agog to hear the promised
  explanation. He was just finishing the last page when there came a gentle tap
  at the door, and Polton entered with a satisfied smile on his dry,
  shrewd-looking face and a small board in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Will this do, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>As he spoke he handed the little board to Thorndyke, who looked at it and
  passed it to me.</p>

  <p>"The very thing, Polton," my friend replied. "Where did you find it? It's
  of no use for you to pretend that you've made it in about two minutes and a
  half."</p>

  <p>Polton smiled one of his queer crinkly smiles, and remarking that "it
  didn't take much making," departed much gratified by the compliment.</p>

  <p>"What a wonderful old fellow that is, Jervis," Thorndyke observed as his
  factotum retired. "He took in the idea instantly and seems to have produced
  the finished article by magic, as the conjurers bring forth rabbits and bowls
  of goldfish at a moment's notice. I suppose you see what your <i>modus
  operandi</i> is to be?"</p>

  <p>I had gathered a clue from the little appliance&mdash;a plate of white
  fret-wood about seven inches by five, to one corner of which a pocket-compass
  had been fixed with shellac&mdash;but was not quite clear as to the details
  of the method.</p>

  <p>"You can read a compass pretty quickly, I think?" Thorndyke said.</p>

  <p>"Of course I can. Used we not to sail a yacht together when we were
  students?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure we did; and we will again before we die. And now as to your
  method of locating this house. Here is a pocket reading-lamp which you can
  hook on the carriage lining. This notebook can be fixed to the board with an
  india-rubber band&mdash;thus. You observe that the thoughtful Polton has
  stuck a piece of thread on the glass of the compass to serve as a lubber's
  line. This is how you will proceed. As soon as you are locked in the
  carriage, light your lamp&mdash;better have a book with you in case the light
  is noticed&mdash;take out your watch and put the board on your knee, keeping
  its long side exactly in a line with the axis of the carriage. Then enter in
  one narrow column of your notebook the time, in the other the direction shown
  by the compass, and in the broad column any particulars, including the number
  of steps the horse makes in a minute. Like this."</p>

  <p>He took a loose sheet of paper and made one or two sample entries on it in
  pencil, thus&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "9.40. S.E. Start from home.<br>
    9.41 S.W. Granite setts.<br>
    9.43. S.W. Wood pavement. Hoofs 104.<br>
    9.47. W. by S Granite crossing. Macadam&mdash;
  </blockquote>

  <p>and so on. Note every change of direction, with the time; and whenever you
  hear or feel anything from outside, note it, with the time and direction; and
  don't forget to note any variations in the horse's pace. You follow the
  process?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. But do you think the method is accurate enough to fix the
  position of a house? Remember, this is only a pocket-compass with no dial,
  and it will jump frightfully. And the mode of estimating distance is very
  rough."</p>

  <p>"That is all perfectly true," Thorndyke answered. "But you are overlooking
  certain important facts The track-chart that you will produce can be checked
  by other data. The house, for instance, has a covered way by which you could
  identify it if you knew approximately where to look for it. Then you must
  remember that your carriage is not travelling over a featureless plain. It is
  passing through streets which have a determined position and direction and
  which are accurately represented on the ordnance map. I think, Jervis, that,
  in spite of the apparent roughness of the method, if you make your
  observations carefully, we shall have no trouble in narrowing down the
  inquiry to a quite small area. If we get the chance, that is to say."</p>

  <p>"Yes, if we do. I am doubtful whether Mr. Weiss will require my services
  again, but I sincerely hope he will. It would be rare sport to locate his
  secret burrow, all unsuspected. But now I must really be off."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, then," said Thorndyke, slipping a well-sharpened pencil through
  the rubber band that fixed the notebook to the board. "Let me know how the
  adventure progresses&mdash;if it progresses at all&mdash;and remember, I hold
  your promise to come and see me again quite soon in any case."</p>

  <p>He handed me the board and the lamp, and, when I had slipped them into my
  pocket, we shook hands and I hurried away, a little uneasy at having left my
  charge so long.</p>

        id="CH3"></a>

  <h2>III. &mdash; "A CHIEL'S AMANG YE TAKIN' NOTES"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE attitude of the suspicious man tends to generate in
  others the kind of conduct that seems to justify his suspicions. In most of
  us there lurks a certain strain of mischief which trustfulness disarms but
  distrust encourages. The inexperienced kitten which approaches us confidingly
  with arched back and upright tail, soliciting caresses, generally receives
  the gentle treatment that it expects; whereas the worldly-wise tom-cat, who,
  in response to friendly advances, scampers away and grins at us suspiciously
  from the fancied security of an adjacent wall, impels us to accelerate his
  retreat with a well-directed clod.</p>

  <p>Now the proceedings of Mr. H. Weiss resembled those of the tom-cat
  aforesaid and invited an analogous reply. To a responsible professional man
  his extraordinary precautions were at once an affront and a challenge. Apart
  from graver considerations, I found myself dwelling with unholy pleasure on
  the prospect of locating the secret hiding-place from which he seemed to grin
  at me with such complacent defiance; and I lost no time and spared no trouble
  in preparing myself for the adventure. The very hansom which bore me from the
  Temple to Kennington Lane was utilized for a preliminary test of Thorndyke's
  little apparatus. During the whole of that brief journey I watched the
  compass closely, noted the feel and sound of the road-material and timed the
  trotting of the horse. And the result was quite encouraging. It is true that
  the compass-needle oscillated wildly to the vibration of the cab, but still
  its oscillations took place around a definite point which was the average
  direction, and it was evident to me that the data it furnished were very
  fairly reliable. I felt very little doubt, after the preliminary trial, as to
  my being able to produce a moderately intelligible track-chart if only I
  should get an opportunity to exercise my skill.</p>

  <p>But it looked as if I should not. Mr. Weiss's promise to send for me again
  soon was not fulfilled. Three days passed and still he made no sign. I began
  to fear that I had been too outspoken; that the shuttered carriage had gone
  forth to seek some more confiding and easy-going practitioner, and that our
  elaborate preparations had been made in vain. When the fourth day drew
  towards a close and still no summons had come, I was disposed reluctantly to
  write the case off as a lost opportunity.</p>

  <p>And at that moment, in the midst of my regrets, the bottle-boy thrust an
  uncomely head in at the door. His voice was coarse, his accent was hideous,
  and his grammatical construction beneath contempt; but I forgave him all when
  I gathered the import of his message.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Weiss's carriage is waiting, and he says will you come as quickly as
  you can because he's took very bad to-night."</p>

  <p>I sprang from my chair and hastily collected the necessaries for the
  journey. The little board and the lamp I put in my overcoat pocket; I
  overhauled the emergency bag and added to its usual contents a bottle of
  permanganate of potassium which I thought I might require. Then I tucked the
  evening paper under my arm and went out.</p>

  <p>The coachman, who was standing at the horse's head as I emerged, touched
  his hat and came forward to open the door.</p>

  <p>"I have fortified myself for the long drive, you see," I remarked,
  exhibiting the newspaper as I stepped into the carriage.</p>

  <p>"But you can't read in the dark," said he.</p>

  <p>"No, but I have provided myself with a lamp," I replied, producing it and
  striking a match.</p>

  <p>He watched me as I lit the lamp and hooked it on the back cushion, and
  observed:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you found it rather a dull ride last time. It's a longish way.
  They might have fitted the carriage with an inside lamp. But we shall have to
  make it a quicker passage to-night. Governor says Mr. Graves is uncommon
  bad."</p>

  <p>With this he slammed the door and locked it. I drew the board from my
  pocket, laid it on my knee, glanced at my watch, and, as the coachman climbed
  to his seat, I made the first entry in the little book.</p>

  <p>"8.58. W. by S. Start from home. Horse 13 hands."</p>

  <p>The first move of the carriage on starting was to turn round as if heading
  for Newington Butts, and the second entry accordingly read:</p>

  <p>"8.58.30. E. by N."</p>

  <p>But this direction was not maintained long. Very soon we turned south and
  then west and then south again. I sat with my eyes riveted on the compass,
  following with some difficulty its rapid changes. The needle swung to and fro
  incessantly but always within a definite arc, the centre of which was the
  true direction. But this direction varied from minute to minute in the most
  astonishing manner. West, south, east, north, the carriage turned, "boxing"
  the compass until I lost all count of direction. It was an amazing
  performance. Considering that the man was driving against time on a mission
  of life and death urgency, his carelessness as to direction was astounding.
  The tortuousness of the route must have made the journey twice as long as it
  need have been with a little more careful selection. At least so it appeared
  to me, though, naturally, I was not in a position to offer an authoritative
  criticism.</p>

  <p>As far as I could judge, we followed the same route as before. Once I
  heard a tug's whistle and knew that we were near the river, and we passed the
  railway station, apparently at the same time as on the previous occasion, for
  I heard a passenger train start and assumed that it was the same train. We
  crossed quite a number of thoroughfares with tram-lines&mdash;I had no idea
  there were so many&mdash;and it was a revelation to me to find how numerous
  the railway arches were in this part of London and how continually the nature
  of the road-metal varied.</p>

  <p>It was by no means a dull journey this time. The incessant changes of
  direction and variations in the character of the road kept me most uncommonly
  busy; for I had hardly time to scribble down one entry before the
  compass-needle would swing round sharply, showing that we had once more
  turned a corner; and I was quite taken by surprise when the carriage slowed
  down and turned into the covered way. Very hastily I scribbled down the final
  entry ("9.24. S.E. In covered way"), and having closed the book and slipped
  it and the board into my pocket, had just opened out the newspaper when the
  carriage door was unlocked and opened, whereupon I unhooked and blew out the
  lamp and pocketed that too, reflecting that it might be useful later.</p>

  <p>As on the last occasion, Mrs. Schallibaum stood in the open doorway with a
  lighted candle. But she was a good deal less self-possessed this time. In
  fact she looked rather wild and terrified. Even by the candle-light I could
  see that she was very pale and she seemed unable to keep still. As she gave
  me the few necessary words of explanation, she fidgeted incessantly and her
  hands and feet were in constant movement.</p>

  <p>"You had better come up with me at once," she said. "Mr. Graves is much
  worse to-night. We will wait not for Mr. Weiss."</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply she quickly ascended the stairs and I
  followed. The room was in much the same condition as before. But the patient
  was not. As soon as I entered the room, a soft, rhythmical gurgle from the
  bed gave me a very clear warning of danger. I stepped forward quickly and
  looked down at the prostrate figure, and the warning gathered emphasis. The
  sick man's ghastly face was yet more ghastly; his eyes were more sunken, his
  skin more livid; "his nose was as sharp as a pen," and if he did not "babble
  of green fields" it was because he seemed to be beyond even that. If it had
  been a case of disease, I should have said at once that he was dying. He had
  all the appearance of a man <i>in articulo mortis</i>. Even as it was,
  feeling convinced that the case was one of morphine poisoning, I was far from
  confident that I should be able to draw him back from the extreme edge of
  vitality on which he trembled so insecurely.</p>

  <p>"He is very ill? He is dying?"</p>

  <p>It was Mrs. Schallibaum's voice; very low, but eager and intense. I
  turned, with my finger on the patient's wrist, and looked into the face of
  the most thoroughly scared woman I have ever seen. She made no attempt now to
  avoid the light, but looked me squarely in the face, and I noticed,
  half-unconsciously, that her eyes were brown and had a curious strained
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "he is very ill. He is in great danger."</p>

  <p>She still stared at me fixedly for some seconds. And then a very odd thing
  occurred. Suddenly she squinted&mdash;squinted horribly; not with the
  familiar convergent squint which burlesque artists imitate, but with external
  or divergent squint of extreme near sight or unequal vision. The effect was
  quite startling. One moment both her eyes were looking straight into mine;
  the next, one of them rolled round until it looked out of the uttermost
  corner, leaving the other gazing steadily forward.</p>

  <p>She was evidently conscious of the change, for she turned her head away
  quickly and reddened somewhat. But it was no time for thoughts of personal
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"You can save him, doctor! You will not let him die! He must not be
  allowed to die!"</p>

  <p>She spoke with as much passion as if he had been the dearest friend that
  she had in the world, which I suspected was far from being the case. But her
  manifest terror had its uses.</p>

  <p>"If anything is to be done to save him," I said, "it must be done quickly.
  I will give him some medicine at once, and meanwhile you must make some
  strong coffee."</p>

  <p>"Coffee!" she exclaimed. "But we have none in the house. Will not tea do,
  if I make it very strong?"</p>

  <p>"No, it will not. I must have coffee; and I must have it quickly."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose I must go and get some. But it is late. The shops will be
  shut. And I don't like leaving Mr. Graves."</p>

  <p>"Can't you send the coachman?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head impatiently. "No, that is no use. I must wait until Mr.
  Weiss comes."</p>

  <p>"That won't do," I said, sharply. "He will slip through our fingers while
  you are waiting. You must go and get that coffee at once and bring it to me
  as soon as it is ready. And I want a tumbler and some water."</p>

  <p>She brought me a water-bottle and glass from the wash-stand and then, with
  a groan of despair, hurried from the room.</p>

  <p>I lost no time in applying the remedies that I had to hand. Shaking out
  into the tumbler a few crystals of potassium permanganate, I filled it up
  with water and approached the patient. His stupor was profound. I shook him
  as roughly as was safe in his depressed condition, but elicited no resistance
  or responsive movement. As it seemed very doubtful whether he was capable of
  swallowing, I dared not take the risk of pouring the liquid into his mouth
  for fear of suffocating him. A stomach-tube would have solved the difficulty,
  but, of course, I had not one with me. I had, however, a mouth-speculum which
  also acted as a gag, and, having propped the patient's mouth open with this,
  I hastily slipped off one of the rubber tubes from my stethoscope and
  inserted into one end of it a vulcanite ear-speculum to serve as a funnel.
  Then, introducing the other end of the tube into the gullet as far as its
  length would permit, I cautiously poured a small quantity of the permanganate
  solution into the extemporized funnel. To my great relief a movement of the
  throat showed that the swallowing reflex still existed, and, thus encouraged,
  I poured down the tube as much of the fluid as I thought it wise to
  administer at one time.</p>

  <p>The dose of permanganate that I had given was enough to neutralize any
  reasonable quantity of the poison that might yet remain in the stomach. I had
  next to deal with that portion of the drug which had already been absorbed
  and was exercising its poisonous effects. Taking my hypodermic case from my
  bag, I prepared in the syringe a full dose of atropine sulphate, which I
  injected forthwith into the unconscious man's arm. And that was all that I
  could do, so far as remedies were concerned, until the coffee arrived.</p>

  <p>I cleaned and put away the syringe, washed the tube, and then, returning
  to the bedside, endeavoured to rouse the patient from his profound lethargy.
  But great care was necessary. A little injudicious roughness of handling, and
  that thready, flickering pulse might stop for ever; and yet it was almost
  certain that if he were not speedily aroused, his stupor would gradually
  deepen until it shaded off imperceptibly into death. I went to work very
  cautiously, moving his limbs about, flicking his face and chest with the
  corner of a wet towel, tickling the soles of his feet, and otherwise applying
  stimuli that were strong without being violent.</p>

  <p>So occupied was I with my efforts to resuscitate my mysterious patient
  that I did not notice the opening of the door, and it was with something of a
  start that, happening to glance round, I perceived at the farther end of the
  room the shadowy figure of a man relieved by two spots of light reflected
  from his spectacles. How long he had been watching me I cannot say, but, when
  he saw that I had observed him, he came forward&mdash;though not very
  far&mdash;and I saw that he was Mr. Weiss.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that you do not find my friend so well
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"So well!" I exclaimed. "I don't find him well at all. I am exceedingly
  anxious about him."</p>

  <p>"You don't&mdash;er&mdash;anticipate anything of a&mdash;er&mdash;anything
  serious, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need to anticipate," said I. "It is already about as serious
  as it can be. I think he might die at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he gasped. "You horrify me!"</p>

  <p>He was not exaggerating. In his agitation, he stepped forward into the
  lighter part of the room, and I could see that his face was pale to
  ghastliness&mdash;except his nose and the adjacent red patches on his cheeks,
  which stood out in grotesquely hideous contrast. Presently, however, he
  recovered a little and said:</p>

  <p>"I really think&mdash;at least I hope&mdash;that you take an unnecessarily
  serious view of his condition. He has been like this before, you know."</p>

  <p>I felt pretty certain that he had not, but there was no use in discussing
  the question. I therefore replied, as I continued my efforts to rouse the
  patient:</p>

  <p>"That may or may not be. But in any case there comes a last time; and it
  may have come now."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," he said; "although I understand that these cases always end
  fatally sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"What cases?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I was referring to sleeping sickness; but perhaps you have formed some
  other opinion as to the nature of this dreadful complaint."</p>

  <p>I hesitated for a moment, and he continued: "As to your suggestion that
  his symptoms might be due to drugs, I think we may consider that as disposed
  of. He has been watched, practically without cessation since you came last,
  and, moreover, I have myself turned out the room and examined the bed and
  have not found a trace of any drug. Have you gone into the question of
  sleeping sickness?"</p>

  <p>I looked at the man narrowly before answering, and distrusted him more
  than ever. But this was no time for reticence. My concern was with the
  patient and his present needs. After all, I was, as Thorndyke had said, a
  doctor, not a detective, and the circumstances called for straightforward
  speech and action on my part.</p>

  <p>"I have considered that question," I said, "and have come to a perfectly
  definite conclusion. His symptoms are not those of sleeping sickness. They
  are in my opinion undoubtedly due to morphine poisoning."</p>

  <p>"But my dear sir!" he exclaimed, "the thing is impossible! Haven't I just
  told you that he has been watched continuously?"</p>

  <p>"I can only judge by the appearances that I find," I answered; and, seeing
  that he was about to offer fresh objections, I continued: "Don't let us waste
  precious time in discussion, or Mr. Graves may be dead before we have reached
  a conclusion. If you will hurry them up about the coffee that I asked for
  some time ago, I will take the other necessary measures, and perhaps we may
  manage to pull him round."</p>

  <p>The rather brutal decision of my manner evidently daunted him. It must
  have been plain to him that I was not prepared to accept any explanation of
  the unconscious man's condition other than that of morphine poisoning; whence
  the inference was pretty plain that the alternatives were recovery or an
  inquest. Replying stiffly that I "must do as I thought best," he hurried from
  the room, leaving me to continue my efforts without further interruption.</p>

  <p>For some time these efforts seemed to make no impression. The man lay as
  still and impassive as a corpse excepting for the slow, shallow and rather
  irregular breathing with its ominous accompanying rattle. But presently, by
  imperceptible degrees, signs of returning life began to make their
  appearance. A sharp slap on the cheek with the wet towel produced a sensible
  flicker of the eyelids; a similar slap on the chest was followed by a slight
  gasp. A pencil, drawn over the sole of the foot, occasioned a visible
  shrinking movement, and, on looking once more at the eyes, I detected a
  slight change that told me that the atropine was beginning to take
  effect.</p>

  <p>This was very encouraging, and, so far, quite satisfactory, though it
  would have been premature to rejoice. I kept the patient carefully covered
  and maintained the process of gentle irritation, moving his limbs and
  shoulders, brushing his hair and generally bombarding his deadened senses
  with small but repeated stimuli. And under this treatment, the improvement
  continued so far that on my bawling a question into his ear he actually
  opened his eyes for an instant, though in another moment, the lids had sunk
  back into their former position.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, Mr. Weiss re-entered the room, followed by Mrs.
  Schallibaum, who carried a small tray, on which were a jug of coffee, a jug
  of milk, a cup and saucer and a sugar basin.</p>

  <p>"How do you find him now?" Mr. Weiss asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to say that there is a distinct improvement," I replied. "But
  we must persevere. He is by no means out of the wood yet."</p>

  <p>I examined the coffee, which looked black and strong and had a very
  reassuring smell, and, pouring out half a cupful, approached the bed.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Graves," I shouted, "we want you to drink some of this."</p>

  <p>The flaccid eyelids lifted for an instant but there was no other response.
  I gently opened the unresisting mouth and ladled in a couple of spoonfuls of
  coffee, which were immediately swallowed; whereupon I repeated the proceeding
  and continued at short intervals until the cup was empty. The effect of the
  new remedy soon became apparent. He began to mumble and mutter obscurely in
  response to the questions that I bellowed at him, and once or twice he opened
  his eyes and looked dreamily into my face. Then I sat him up and made him
  drink some coffee from the cup, and, all the time, kept up a running fire of
  questions, which made up in volume of sound for what they lacked of
  relevancy.</p>

  <p>Of these proceedings Mr. Weiss and his housekeeper were highly interested
  spectators, and the former, contrary to his usual practice, came quite close
  up to the bed, to get a better view.</p>

  <p>"It is really a most remarkable thing," he said, "but it almost looks as
  if you were right, after all. He is certainly much better. But tell me, would
  this treatment produce a similar improvement if the symptoms were due to
  disease?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered, "it certainly would not."</p>

  <p>"Then that seems to settle it. But it is a most mysterious affair. Can you
  suggest any way in which he can have concealed a store of the drug?"</p>

  <p>I stood up and looked him straight in the face; it was the first chance I
  had had of inspecting him by any but the feeblest light, and I looked at him
  very attentively. Now, it is a curious fact&mdash;though one that most
  persons must have observed&mdash;that there sometimes occurs a considerable
  interval between the reception of a visual impression and its complete
  transfer to the consciousness. A thing may be seen, as it were,
  unconsciously, and the impression consigned, apparently, to instant oblivion;
  and yet the picture may be subsequently revived by memory with such
  completeness that its details can be studied as though the object were still
  actually visible.</p>

  <p>Something of this kind must have happened to me now. Preoccupied as I was,
  by the condition of the patient, the professional habit of rapid and close
  observation caused me to direct a searching glance at the man before me. It
  was only a brief glance&mdash;for Mr. Weiss, perhaps embarrassed by my keen
  regard of him, almost immediately withdrew into the shadow&mdash;and my
  attention seemed principally to be occupied by the odd contrast between the
  pallor of his face and the redness of his nose and by the peculiar stiff,
  bristly character of his eyebrows. But there was another fact, and a very
  curious one, that was observed by me subconsciously and instantly forgotten,
  to be revived later when I reflected on the events of the night. It was
  this:</p>

  <p>As Mr. Weiss stood, with his head slightly turned, I was able to look
  through one glass of his spectacles at the wall beyond. On the wall was a
  framed print; and the edge of the frame, seen through the spectacle-glass,
  appeared quite unaltered and free from distortion, magnification or
  reduction, as if seen through plain window-glass; and yet the reflections of
  the candle-flame in the spectacles showed the flame upside down, proving
  conclusively that the glasses were concave on one surface at least. The
  strange phenomenon was visible only for a moment or two, and as it passed out
  of my sight it passed also out of my mind.</p>

  <p>"No," I said, replying to the last question; "I can think of no way in
  which he could have effectually hidden a store of morphine. Judging by the
  symptoms, he has taken a large dose, and, if he has been in the habit of
  consuming large quantities, his stock would be pretty bulky. I can offer no
  suggestion whatever."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you consider him quite out of danger now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all. I think we can pull him round if we persevere, but he
  must not be allowed to sink back into a state of coma. We must keep him on
  the move until the effects of the drug have really passed off. If you will
  put him into his dressing-gown we will walk him up and down the room for a
  while."</p>

  <p>"But is that safe?" Mr. Weiss asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Quite safe," I answered. "I will watch his pulse carefully. The danger is
  in the possibility, or rather certainty, of a relapse if he is not kept
  moving."</p>

  <p>With obvious unwillingness and disapproval, Mr. Weiss produced a
  dressing-gown and together we invested the patient in it. Then we dragged
  him, very limp, but not entirely unresisting, out of bed and stood him on his
  feet. He opened his eyes and blinked owlishly first at one and then at the
  other of us, and mumbled a few unintelligible words of protest; regardless of
  which, we thrust his feet into slippers and endeavoured to make him walk. At
  first he seemed unable to stand, and we had to support him by his arms as we
  urged him forward; but presently his trailing legs began to make definite
  walking movements, and, after one or two turns up and down the room, he was
  not only able partly to support his weight, but showed evidence of reviving
  consciousness in more energetic protests.</p>

  <p>At this point Mr. Weiss astonished me by transferring the arm that he held
  to the housekeeper.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me, doctor," said he, "I will go now and attend to
  some rather important business that I have had to leave unfinished. Mrs.
  Schallibaum will be able to give you all the assistance that you require, and
  will order the carriage when you think it safe to leave the patient. In case
  I should not see you again I will say 'good night.' I hope you won't think me
  very unceremonious."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with me and went out of the room, leaving me, as I have
  said, profoundly astonished that he should consider any business of more
  moment than the condition of his friend, whose life, even now, was but
  hanging by a thread. However, it was really no concern of mine. I could do
  without him, and the resuscitation of this unfortunate half-dead man gave me
  occupation enough to engross my whole attention.</p>

  <p>The melancholy progress up and down the room re-commenced, and with it the
  mumbled protests from the patient. As we walked, and especially as we turned,
  I caught frequent glimpses of the housekeeper's face. But it was nearly
  always in profile. She appeared to avoid looking me in the face, though she
  did so once or twice; and on each of these occasions her eyes were directed
  at me in a normal manner without any sign of a squint. Nevertheless, I had
  the impression that when her face was turned away from me she squinted. The
  "swivel eye"&mdash;the left&mdash;was towards me as she held the patient's
  right arm, and it was almost continuously turned in my direction, whereas I
  felt convinced that she was really looking straight before her, though, of
  course, her right eye was invisible to me. It struck me, even at the time, as
  an odd affair, but I was too much concerned about my charge to give it much
  consideration.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the patient continued to revive apace. And the more he revived,
  the more energetically did he protest against this wearisome perambulation.
  But he was evidently a polite gentleman, for, muddled as his faculties were,
  he managed to clothe his objections in courteous and even gracious forms of
  speech singularly out of agreement with the character that Mr. Weiss had
  given him.</p>

  <p>"I thangyou," he mumbled thickly. "Ver' good take s'much trouble. Think I
  will lie down now." He looked wistfully at the bed, but I wheeled him about
  and marched him once more down the room. He submitted unresistingly, but as
  we again approached the bed he reopened the matter.</p>

  <p>"S'quite s'fficient, thang you. Gebback to bed now. Much 'bliged frall
  your kindness"&mdash;here I turned him round&mdash;"no, really; m'feeling
  rather tired. Sh'like to lie down now, f'you'd be s'good."</p>

  <p>"You must walk about a little longer, Mr. Graves," I said. "It would be
  very bad for you to go to sleep again."</p>

  <p>He looked at me with a curious, dull surprise, and reflected awhile as if
  in some perplexity. Then he looked at me again and said:</p>

  <p>"Thing, sir, you are mistake&mdash;mistaken me&mdash;mist&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Mrs. Schallibaum interrupted sharply:</p>

  <p>"The doctor thinks it's good for you to walk about. You've been sleeping
  too much. He doesn't want you to sleep any more just now."</p>

  <p>"Don't wanter sleep; wanter lie down," said the patient.</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't lie down for a little while. You must walk about for a
  few minutes more. And you'd better not talk. Just walk up and down."</p>

  <p>"There's no harm in his talking," said I; "in fact it's good for him. It
  will help to keep him awake."</p>

  <p>"I should think it would tire him," said Mrs. Schallibaum; "and it worries
  me to hear him asking to lie down when we can't let him."</p>

  <p>She spoke sharply and in an unnecessarily high tone so that the patient
  could not fail to hear. Apparently he took in the very broad hint contained
  in the concluding sentence, for he trudged wearily and unsteadily up and down
  the room for some time without speaking, though he continued to look at me
  from time to time as if something in my appearance puzzled him exceedingly.
  At length his intolerable longing for repose overcame his politeness and he
  returned to the attack.</p>

  <p>"Surely v' walked enough now. Feeling very tired. Am really. Would you be
  s'kind 's t'let me lie down few minutes?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think he might lie down for a little while?" Mrs. Schallibaum
  asked.</p>

  <p>I felt his pulse, and decided that he was really becoming fatigued, and
  that it would be wiser not to overdo the exercise while he was so weak.
  Accordingly, I consented to his returning to bed, and turned him round in
  that direction; whereupon he tottered gleefully towards his resting-place
  like a tired horse heading for its stable.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was tucked in, I gave him a full cup of coffee, which he
  drank with some avidity as if thirsty. Then I sat down by the bedside, and,
  with a view to keeping him awake, began once more to ply him with
  questions.</p>

  <p>"Does your head ache, Mr. Graves?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The doctor says 'does your head ache?'" Mrs. Schallibaum squalled, so
  loudly that the patient started perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"I heard him, m'dear girl," he answered with a faint smile. "Not deaf you
  know. Yes. Head aches a good deal. But I thing this gennleman
  mistakes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He says you are to keep awake. You mustn't go to sleep again, and you are
  not to close your eyes."</p>

  <p>"All ri' Pol'n. Keep'm open," and he proceeded forthwith to shut them with
  an air of infinite peacefulness. I grasped his hand and shook it gently, on
  which he opened his eyes and looked at me sleepily. The housekeeper stroked
  his head, keeping her face half-turned from me&mdash;as she had done almost
  constantly, to conceal the squinting eye, as I assumed&mdash;and said:</p>

  <p>"Need we keep you any longer, doctor? It is getting very late and you have
  a long way to go."</p>

  <p>I looked doubtfully at the patient. I was loath to leave him, distrusting
  these people as I did. But I had my work to do on the morrow, with, perhaps,
  a night call or two in the interval, and the endurance even of a general
  practitioner has its linits.</p>

  <p>"I think I heard the carriage some time ago," Mrs. Schallibaum added.</p>

  <p>I rose hesitatingly and looked at my watch. It had turned half-past
  eleven.</p>

  <p>"You understand," I said in a low voice, "that the danger is not over? If
  he is left now he will fall asleep, and in all human probability will never
  wake. You clearly understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite clearly. I promise you he shall not be allowed to fall asleep
  again."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she looked me full in the face for a few moments, and I
  noted that her eyes had a perfectly normal appearance, without any trace
  whatever of a squint.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said. "On that understanding I will go now; and I shall
  hope to find our friend quite recovered at my next visit."</p>

  <p>I turned to the patient, who was already dozing, and shook his hand
  heartily.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Mr. Graves!" I said. "I am sorry to have to disturb your repose
  so much; but you must keep awake, you know. Won't do to go to sleep."</p>

  <p>"Ver' well," he replied drowsily. "Sorry t' give you all this trouble. L'
  keep awake. But I think you're mistak'n&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He says it's very important that you shouldn't go to sleep, and that I am
  to see that you don't. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I un'stan'. But why does this gennlem'n&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Now it's of no use for you to ask a lot of questions," Mrs. Schallibaum
  said playfully; "we'll talk to you to-morrow. Good night, doctor. I'll light
  you down the stairs, but I won't come down with you, or the patient will be
  falling asleep again."</p>

  <p>Taking this definite dismissal, I retired, followed by a dreamily
  surprised glance from the sick man. The housekeeper held the candle over the
  balusters until I reached the bottom of the stairs, when I perceived through
  the open door along the passage a glimmer of light from the carriage lamps.
  The coachman was standing just outside, faintly illuminated by the very dim
  lamplight, and as I stepped into the carriage he remarked in his Scotch
  dialect that I "seemed to have been makin' a nicht of it." He did not wait
  for any reply&mdash;none being in fact needed&mdash;but shut the door and
  locked it.</p>

  <p>I lit my little pocket-lamp and hung it on the back cushion. I even drew
  the board and notebook from my pocket. But it seemed rather unnecessary to
  take a fresh set of notes, and, to tell the truth, I rather shirked the
  labour, tired as I was after my late exertions; besides, I wanted to think
  over the events of the evening, while they were fresh in my memory.
  Accordingly I put away the notebook, filled and lighted my pipe, and settled
  myself to review the incidents attending my second visit to this rather
  uncanny house.</p>

  <p>Considered in leisurely retrospect, that visit offered quite a number of
  problems that called for elucidation. There was the patient's condition, for
  instance. Any doubt as to the cause of his symptoms was set at rest by the
  effect of the antidotes. Mr. Graves was certainly under the influence of
  morphine, and the only doubtful question was how he had become so. That he
  had taken the poison himself was incredible. No morphinomaniac would take
  such a knock-down dose. It was practically certain that the poison had been
  administered by someone else, and, on Mr. Weiss's own showing, there was no
  one but himself and the housekeeper who could have administered it. And to
  this conclusion all the other very queer circumstances pointed.</p>

  <p>What were these circumstances? They were, as I have said, numerous, though
  many of them seemed trivial. To begin with, Mr. Weiss's habit of appearing
  some time after my arrival and disappearing some time before my departure was
  decidedly odd. But still more odd was his sudden departure this evening on
  what looked like a mere pretext. That departure coincided in time with the
  sick man's recovery of the power of speech. Could it be that Mr. Weiss was
  afraid that the half-conscious man might say something compromising to him in
  my presence? It looked rather like it. And yet he had gone away and left me
  with the patient and the housekeeper.</p>

  <p>But when I came to think about it I remembered that Mrs. Schallibaum had
  shown some anxiety to prevent the patient from talking. She had interrupted
  him more than once, and had on two occasions broken in when he seemed to be
  about to ask me some question. I was "mistaken" about something. What was
  that something that he wanted to tell me?</p>

  <p>It had struck me as singular that there should be no coffee in the house,
  but a sufficiency of tea. Germans are not usually tea-drinkers and they do
  take coffee. But perhaps there was nothing in this. Rather more remarkable
  was the invisibility of the coachman. Why could he not be sent to fetch the
  coffee, and why did not he, rather than the housekeeper, come to take the
  place of Mr. Weiss when the latter had to go away.</p>

  <p>There were other points, too. I recalled the word that sounded like
  "Pol'n," which Mr. Graves had used in speaking to the housekeeper. Apparently
  it was a Christian name of some kind; but why did Mr. Graves call the woman
  by her Christian name when Mr. Weiss addressed her formally as Mrs.
  Schallibaum? And, as to the woman herself: what was the meaning of that
  curious disappearing squint? Physically it presented no mystery. The woman
  had an ordinary divergent squint, and, like many people, who suffer from this
  displacement, could, by a strong muscular effort, bring the eyes temporarily
  into their normal parallel position. I had detected the displacement when she
  had tried to maintain the effort too long, and the muscular control had given
  way. But why had she done it? Was it only feminine vanity&mdash;mere
  sensitiveness respecting a slight personal disfigurement? It might be so; or
  there might be some further motive. It was impossible to say.</p>

  <p>Turning this question over, I suddenly remembered the peculiarity of Mr.
  Weiss's spectacles. And here I met with a real poser. I had certainly seen
  through those spectacles as clearly as if they had been plain window-glass;
  and they had certainly given an inverted reflection of the candle-flame like
  that thrown from the surface of a concave lens. Now they obviously could not
  be both flat and concave; but yet they had the properties peculiar to both
  flatness and concavity. And there was a further difficulty. If I could see
  objects unaltered through them, so could Mr. Weiss. But the function of
  spectacles is to alter the appearances of objects, by magnification,
  reduction or compensating distortion. If they leave the appearances unchanged
  they are useless. I could make nothing of it. After puzzling over it for
  quite a long time, I had to give it up; which I did the less unwillingly
  inasmuch as the construction of Mr. Weiss's spectacles had no apparent
  bearing on the case.</p>

  <p>On arriving home, I looked anxiously at the message-book, and was relieved
  to find that there were no further visits to be made. Having made up a
  mixture for Mr. Graves and handed it to the coachman, I raked the ashes of
  the surgery fire together and sat down to smoke a final pipe while I
  reflected once more on the singular and suspicious case in which I had become
  involved. But fatigue soon put an end to my meditations; and having come to
  the conclusion that the circumstances demanded a further consultation with
  Thorndyke, I turned down the gas to a microscopic blue spark and betook
  myself to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>IV. &mdash; THE OFFICIAL VIEW</h2>

  <p class="first">I ROSE on the following morning still possessed by the
  determination to make some oportunity during the day to call on Thorndyke and
  take his advice on the now urgent question as to what I was to do. I use the
  word "urgent" advisedly; for the incidents of the preceding evening had left
  me with the firm conviction that poison was being administered for some
  purpose to my mysterious patient, and that no time must be lost if his life
  was to be saved. Last night he had escaped only by the narrowest
  margin&mdash;assuming him to be still alive&mdash;and it was only my
  unexpectedly firm attitude that had compelled Mr. Weiss to agree to
  restorative measures.</p>

  <p>That I should be sent for again I had not the slightest expectation. If
  what I so strongly suspected was true, Weiss would call in some other doctor,
  in the hope of better luck, and it was imperative that he should be stopped
  before it was too late. This was my view, but I meant to have Thorndyke's
  opinion, and act under his direction, but</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The best laid plans of mice and men<br>
    Gang aft agley."
  </blockquote>

  <p>When I came downstairs and took a preliminary glance at the rough
  memorandum-book, kept by the bottle-boy, or, in his absence, by the
  housemaid, I stood aghast. The morning's entries looked already like a sample
  page of the Post Office directory. The new calls alone were more than equal
  to an ordinary day's work, and the routine visits remained to be added.
  Gloomily wondering whether the Black Death had made a sudden reappearance in
  England, I hurried to the dining-room and made a hasty breakfast, interrupted
  at intervals by the apparition of the bottle-boy to announce new
  messages.</p>

  <p>The first two or three visits solved the mystery. An epidemic of influenza
  had descended on the neighbourhood, and I was getting not only our own normal
  work but a certain amount of overflow from other practices. Further, it
  appeared that a strike in the building trade had been followed immediately by
  a widespread failure of health among the bricklayers who were members of a
  certain benefit club; which accounted for the remarkable suddenness of the
  outbreak.</p>

  <p>Of course, my contemplated visit to Thorndyke was out of the question. I
  should have to act on my own responsibility. But in the hurry and rush and
  anxiety of the work&mdash;for some of the cases were severe and even
  critical&mdash;I had no opportunity to consider any course of action, nor
  time to carry it out. Even with the aid of a hansom which I chartered, as
  Stillbury kept no carriage, I had not finished my last visit until near on
  midnight, and was then so spent with fatigue that I fell asleep over my
  postponed supper.</p>

  <p>As the next day opened with a further increase of work, I sent a telegram
  to Dr. Stillbury at Hastings, whither he had gone, like a wise man, to
  recruit after a slight illness. I asked for authority to engage an assistant,
  but the reply informed me that Stillbury himself was on his way to town; and
  to my relief, when I dropped in at the surgery for a cup of tea, I found him
  rubbing his hands over the open day-book.</p>

  <p>"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good," he remarked cheerfully as we
  shook hands. "This will pay the expenses of my holiday, including you. By the
  way, you are not anxious to be off, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, I was; for I had decided to accept Thorndyke's offer,
  and was now eager to take up my duties with him. But it would have been
  shabby to leave Stillbury to battle alone with this rush of work or to seek
  the services of a strange assistant.</p>

  <p>"I should like to get off as soon as you can spare me," I replied, "but
  I'm not going to leave you in the lurch."</p>

  <p>"That's a good fellow," said Stillbury. "I knew you wouldn't. Let us have
  some tea and divide up the work. Anything of interest going?"</p>

  <p>There were one or two unusual cases on the list, and, as we marked off our
  respective patients, I gave him the histories in brief synopsis. And then I
  opened the subject of my mysterious experiences at the house of Mr.
  Weiss.</p>

  <p>"There's another affair that I want to tell you about; rather an
  unpleasant business."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Stillbury. He put down his cup and regarded me with
  quite painful anxiety.</p>

  <p>"It looks to me like an undoubted case of criminal poisoning," I
  continued.</p>

  <p>Stillbury's face cleared instantly. "Oh, I'm glad it's nothing more than
  that," he said with an air of relief. "I was afraid, it was some confounded
  woman. There's always that danger, you know, when a locum is young and
  happens&mdash;if I may say so, Jervis&mdash;to be a good-looking fellow. Let
  us hear about this case."</p>

  <p>I gave him a condensed narrative of my connection with the mysterious
  patient, omitting any reference to Thorndyke, and passing lightly over my
  efforts to fix the position of the house, and wound up with the remark that
  the facts ought certainly to be communicated to the police.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted reluctantly, "I suppose you're right. Deuced unpleasant
  though. Police cases don't do a practice any good. They waste a lot of time,
  too; keep you hanging about to give evidence. Still, you are quite right. We
  can't stand by and see the poor devil poisoned without making some effort.
  But I don't believe the police will do anything in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Don't you really?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. They like to have things pretty well cut and dried before
  they act. A prosecution is an expensive affair, so they don't care to
  prosecute unless they are fairly sure of a conviction. If they fail they get
  hauled over the coals."</p>

  <p>"But don't you think they would get a conviction in this case?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your evidence, Jervis. They might pick up something fresh, but, if
  they didn't they would fail. You haven't got enough hard-baked facts to upset
  a capable defence. Still, that isn't our affair. You want to put the
  responsibility on the police and I entirely agree with you."</p>

  <p>"There ought not to be any delay," said I.</p>

  <p>"There needn't be. I shall look in on Mrs. Wackford and you have to see
  the Rummel children; we shall pass the station on our way. Why shouldn't we
  drop in and see the inspector or superintendent?"</p>

  <p>The suggestion met my views exactly. As soon as we had finished tea, we
  set forth, and in about ten minutes found ourselves in the bare and
  forbidding office attached to the station.</p>

  <p>The presiding officer descended from a high stool, and, carefully laying
  down his pen, shook hands cordially.</p>

  <p>"And what can I do for you gentlemen?" he asked, with an affable
  smile.</p>

  <p>Stillbury proceeded to open our business.</p>

  <p>"My friend here, Dr. Jervis, who has very kindly been looking after my
  work for a week or two, has had a most remarkable experience, and he wants to
  tell you about it."</p>

  <p>"Something in my line of business?" the officer inquired.</p>

  <p>"That," said I, "is for you to judge. I think it is, but you may think
  otherwise"; and hereupon, without further preamble, I plunged into the
  history of the case, giving him a condensed statement similar to that which I
  had already made to Stillbury.</p>

  <p>He listened with close attention, jotting down from time to time a brief
  note on a sheet of paper; and, when I had finished, he wrote out in a
  black-covered notebook a short prcis of my statement.</p>

  <p>"I have written down here," he said, "the substance of what you have told
  me. I will read the deposition over to you, and, if it is correct, I will ask
  you to sign it."</p>

  <p>He did so, and, when I had signed the document, I asked him what was
  likely to be done in the matter.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he replied, "that we can't take any active measures. You
  have put us on our guard and we shall keep our eyes open. But I think that is
  all we can do, unless we hear something further."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "don't you think that it is a very suspicious
  affair?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he replied. "A very fishy business indeed, and you were quite
  right to come and tell us about it."</p>

  <p>"It seems a pity not to take some measures," I said. "While you are
  waiting to hear something further, they may give the poor wretch a fresh dose
  and kill him."</p>

  <p>"In which case we should hear something further, unless some fool of a
  doctor were to give a death certificate."</p>

  <p>"But that is very unsatisfactory. The man ought not to be allowed to
  die."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you, sir. But we've no evidence that he is going to
  die. His friends sent for you, and you treated him skilfully and left him in
  a fair way to recovery. That's all that we really know about it. Yes, I
  know," the officer continued as I made signs of disagreement, "you think that
  a crime is possibly going to be committed and that we ought to prevent it.
  But you overrate our powers. We can only act on evidence that a crime has
  actually been committed or is actually being attempted. Now we have no such
  evidence. Look at your statement, and tell me what you can swear to."</p>

  <p>"I think I could swear that Mr. Graves had taken a poisonous dose of
  morphine."</p>

  <p>"And who gave him that poisonous dose?"</p>

  <p>"I very strongly suspect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's no good, sir," interrupted the officer. "Suspicion isn't evidence.
  We should want you to swear an information and give us enough facts to make
  out a <i>prim facie</i> case against some definite person. And you couldn't
  do it. Your information amounts to this: that a certain person has taken a
  poisonous dose of morphine and apparently recovered. That's all. You can't
  swear that the names given to you are real names, and you can't give us any
  address or even any locality."</p>

  <p>"I took some compass bearings in the carriage," I said. "You could locate
  the house, I think, without much difficulty."</p>

  <p>The officer smiled faintly and fixed an abstracted gaze on the clock.</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> could, sir," he replied. "I have no doubt whatever that
  <i>you</i> could. <i>I</i> couldn't. But, in any case, we haven't enough to
  go upon. If you learn anything fresh, I hope you will let me know; and I am
  very much obliged to you for taking so much trouble in the matter. Good
  evening sir. Good evening, Dr. Stillbury."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with us both genially, and, accepting perforce this very
  polite but unmistakable dismissal, we took our departure.</p>

  <p>Outside the station, Stillbury heaved a comfortable sigh. He was evidently
  relieved to find that no upheavals were to take place in his domain.</p>

  <p>"I thought that would be their attitude," he said, "and they are quite
  right, you know. The function of law is to prevent crime, it is true; but
  prophylaxis in the sense in which we understand it is not possible in legal
  practice."</p>

  <p>I assented without enthusiasm. It was disappointing to find that no
  precautionary measures were to be taken. However, I had done all that I could
  in the matter. No further responsibility lay upon me, and, as it was
  practically certain that I had seen and heard the last of Mr. Graves and his
  mysterious household, I dismissed the case from my mind. At the next corner
  Stillbury and I parted to go our respective ways; and my attention was soon
  transferred from the romance of crime to the realities of epidemic
  influenza.</p>

  <p>The plethora of work in Dr. Stillbury's practice continued longer than I
  had bargained for. Day after day went by and still found me tramping the
  dingy streets of Kennington or scrambling up and down narrow stairways;
  turning in at night dead tired, or turning out half awake to the hideous
  jangle of the night bell.</p>

  <p>It was very provoking. For months I had resisted Thorndyke's persuasion to
  give up general practice and join him. Not from lack of inclination, but from
  a deep suspicion that he was thinking of my wants rather than his own; that
  his was a charitable rather than a business proposal. Now that I knew this
  not to be the case, I was impatient to join him; and, as I trudged through
  the dreary thoroughfares of this superannuated suburb, with its once rustic
  villas and its faded gardens, my thoughts would turn enviously to the quiet
  dignity of the Temple and my friend's chambers in King's Bench Walk.</p>

  <p>The closed carriage appeared no more; nor did any whisper either of good
  or evil reach me in connection with the mysterious house from which it had
  come. Mr. Graves had apparently gone out of my life for ever.</p>

  <p>But if he had gone out of my life, he had not gone out of my memory.
  Often, as I walked my rounds, would the picture of that dimly-lit room rise
  unbidden. Often would I find myself looking once more into that ghastly face,
  so worn, so wasted and haggard, and yet so far from repellent. All the
  incidents of that last night would reconstitute themselves with a vividness
  that showed the intensity of the impression that they had made at the time. I
  would have gladly forgotten the whole affair, for every incident of it was
  fraught with discomfort. But it clung to my memory; it haunted me; and ever
  as it returned it bore with it the disquieting questions: Was Mr. Graves
  still alive? And, if he was not, was there really nothing which could have
  been done to save him?</p>

  <p>Nearly a month passed before the practice began to show signs of returning
  to its normal condition. Then the daily lists became more and more contracted
  and the day's work proportionately shorter. And thus the term of my servitude
  came to an end. One evening, as we were writing up the day-book, Stillbury
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"I almost think, Jervis, I could manage by myself now. I know you are only
  staying on for my sake."</p>

  <p>"I am staying on to finish my engagement, but I shan't be sorry to clear
  out if you can do without me."</p>

  <p>"I think I can. When would you like to be off?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as possible. Say to-morrow morning, after I have made a few
  visits and transferred the patients to you."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Stillbury. "Then I will give you your cheque and settle
  up everything to-night, so that you shall be free to go off when you like
  to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>Thus ended my connection with Kennington Lane. On the following day at
  about noon, I found myself strolling across Waterloo Bridge with the
  sensations of a newly liberated convict and a cheque for twenty-five guineas
  in my pocket. My luggage was to follow when I sent for it. Now, unhampered
  even by a hand-bag, I joyfully descended the steps at the north end of the
  bridge and headed for King's Bench Walk by way of the Embankment and Middle
  Temple Lane.</p>

  <h2>V. &mdash; JEFFREY BLACKMORE'S WILL</h2>

  <p class="first">MY arrival at Thorndyke's chambers was not unexpected,
  having been heralded by a premonitory post-card. The "oak" was open and an
  application of the little brass knocker of the inner door immediately
  produced my colleague himself and a very hearty welcome.</p>

  <p>"At last," said Thorndyke, "you have come forth from the house of bondage.
  I began to think that you had taken up your abode in Kennington for
  good."</p>

  <p>"I was beginning, myself, to wonder when I should escape. But here I am;
  and I may say at once that I am ready to shake the dust of general practice
  off my feet for ever&mdash;that is, if you are still willing to have me as
  your assistant."</p>

  <p>"Willing!" exclaimed Thorndyke, "Barkis himself was not more willing than
  I. You will be invaluable to me. Let us settle the terms of our comradeship
  forthwith, and to-morrow we will take measures to enter you as a student of
  the Inner Temple. Shall we have our talk in the open air and the spring
  sunshine?"</p>

  <p>I agreed readily to this proposal, for it was a bright, sunny day and warm
  for the time of year&mdash;the beginning of April. We descended to the Walk
  and thence slowly made our way to the quiet court behind the church, where
  poor old Oliver Goldsmith lies, as he would surely have wished to lie, in the
  midst of all that had been dear to him in his chequered life. I need not
  record the matter of our conversation. To Thorndyke's proposals I had no
  objections to offer but my own unworthiness and his excessive liberality. A
  few minutes saw our covenants fully agreed upon, and when Thorndyke had noted
  the points on a slip of paper, signed and dated it and handed it to me, the
  business was at an end.</p>

  <p>"There," my colleague said with a smile as he put away his pocket-book,
  "if people would only settle their affairs in that way, a good part of the
  occupation of lawyers would be gone. Brevity is the soul of wit; and the fear
  of simplicity is the beginning of litigation."</p>

  <p>"And now," I said, "I propose that we go and feed. I will invite you to
  lunch to celebrate our contract."</p>

  <p>"My learned junior is premature," he replied. "I had already arranged a
  little festivity&mdash;or rather had modified one that was already arranged.
  You remember Mr. Marchmont, the solicitor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He called this morning to ask me to lunch with him and a new client at
  the 'Cheshire Cheese.' I accepted and notified him that I should bring
  you."</p>

  <p>"Why the 'Cheshire Cheese'?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Marchmont's reasons for the selection were, first, that his
  client has never seen an old-fashioned London tavern, and second, that this
  is Wednesday and he, Marchmont, has a gluttonous affection for a really fine
  beef-steak pudding. You don't object, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all. In fact, now that you mention it, my own sensations
  incline me to sympathize with Marchmont. I breakfasted rather early."</p>

  <p>"Then come," said Thorndyke. "The assignation is for one o'clock, and, if
  we walk slowly, we shall just hit it off."</p>

  <p>We sauntered up Inner Temple Lane, and, crossing Fleet Street, headed
  sedately for the tavern. As we entered the quaint old-world dining-room,
  Thorndyke looked round and a gentleman, who was seated with a companion at a
  table in one of the little boxes or compartments, rose and saluted us.</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce you to my friend Mr. Stephen Blackmore," he said as we
  approached. Then, turning to his companion, he introduced us by our
  respective names.</p>

  <p>"I engaged this box," he continued, "so that we might be private if we
  wished to have a little preliminary chat; not that beef-steak pudding is a
  great help to conversation. But when people have a certain business in view,
  their talk is sure to drift towards it, sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke and I sat down opposite the lawyer and his client, and we
  mutually inspected one another. Marchmont I already knew; an elderly,
  professional-looking man, a typical solicitor of the old school; fresh-faced,
  precise, rather irascible, and conveying a not unpleasant impression of
  taking a reasonable interest in his diet. The other man was quite young, not
  more than five-and-twenty, and was a fine athletic-looking fellow with a
  healthy, out-of-door complexion and an intelligent and highly prepossessing
  face. I took a liking to him at the first glance, and so, I saw, did
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"You two gentlemen," said Blackmore, addressing us, "seem to be quite old
  acquaintances. I have heard so much about you from my friend, Reuben
  Hornby."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Marchmont, "that was a queer case&mdash;'The Case of the
  Red Thumb Mark,' as the papers called it. It was an eye-opener to
  old-fashioned lawyers like myself. We've had scientific witnesses
  before&mdash;and bullied 'em properly, by Jove! when they wouldn't give the
  evidence that we wanted. But the scientific lawyer is something new. His
  appearance in court made us all sit up, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>"I hope we shall make you sit up again," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"You won't this time," said Marchmont. "The issues in this case of my
  friend Blackmore's are purely legal; or rather, there are no issues at all.
  There is nothing in dispute. I tried to prevent Blackmore from consulting
  you, but he wouldn't listen to reason. Here! Waiter! How much longer are we
  to be waiters? We shall die of old age before we get our victuals!"</p>

  <p>The waiter smiled apologetically. "Yessir!" said he. "Coming now, sir."
  And at this very moment there was borne into the room a Gargantuan pudding in
  a great bucket of a basin, which being placed on a three-legged stool was
  forthwith attacked ferociously by the white-clothed, white-capped carver. We
  watched the process&mdash;as did every one present&mdash;with an interest not
  entirely gluttonous, for it added a pleasant touch to the picturesque old
  room, with its sanded floor, its homely, pew-like boxes, its high-backed
  settles and the friendly portrait of the "great lexicographer" that beamed
  down on us from the wall.</p>

  <p>"This is a very different affair from your great, glittering modern
  restaurant," Mr. Marchmont remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is indeed," said Blackmore, "and if this is the way in which our
  ancestors lived, it would seem that they had a better idea of comfort than we
  have."</p>

  <p>There was a short pause, during which Mr. Marchmont glared hungrily at the
  pudding; then Thorndyke said:</p>

  <p>"So you refused to listen to reason, Mr. Blackmore?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see, Mr. Marchmont and his partner had gone into the matter and
  decided that there was nothing to be done. Then I happened to mention the
  affair to Reuben Hornby, and he urged me to ask your advice on the case."</p>

  <p>"Like his impudence," growled Marchmont, "to meddle with my client."</p>

  <p>"On which," continued Blackmore, "I spoke to Mr. Marchmont and he agreed
  that it was worth while to take your opinion on the case, though he warned me
  to cherish no hopes, as the affair was not really within your specialty."</p>

  <p>"So you understand," said Marchmont, "that we expect nothing. This is
  quite a forlorn hope. We are taking your opinion as a mere formality, to be
  able to say that we have left nothing untried."</p>

  <p>"That is an encouraging start," Thorndyke remarked. "It leaves me
  unembarrassed by the possibility of failure. But meanwhile you are arousing
  in me a devouring curiosity as to the nature of the case. Is it highly
  confidential? Because if not, I would mention that Jervis has now joined me
  as my permanent colleague."</p>

  <p>"It isn't confidential at all," said Marchmont. "The public are in full
  possession of the facts, and we should be only too happy to put them in still
  fuller possession, through the medium of the Probate Court, if we could find
  a reasonable pretext. But we can't."</p>

  <p>Here the waiter charged our table with the fussy rapidity of the
  overdue.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. Rather early, sir. Wouldn't like it
  underdone, sir."</p>

  <p>Marchmont inspected his plate critically and remarked:</p>

  <p>"I sometimes suspect these oysters of being mussels; and I'll swear the
  larks are sparrows."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope so," said Thorndyke. "The lark is better employed 'at
  Heaven's gate singing' than garnishing a beef-steak pudding. But you were
  telling us about your case."</p>

  <p>"So I was. Well it's just a matter of&mdash;ale or claret? Oh, claret, I
  know. You despise the good old British John Barleycorn."</p>

  <p>"He that drinks beer thinks beer," retorted Thorndyke. "But you were
  saying that it is just a matter of&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"A matter of a perverse testator and an ill-drawn will. A peculiarly
  irritating case, too, because the defective will replaces a perfectly sound
  one, and the intentions of the testator
  were&mdash;er&mdash;were&mdash;excellent ale, this. A little heady, perhaps,
  but sound. Better than your sour French wine,
  Thorndyke&mdash;were&mdash;er&mdash;were quite obvious. What he evidently
  desired was&mdash;mustard? Better have some mustard. No? Well, well! Even a
  Frenchman would take mustard. You can have no appreciation of flavour,
  Thorndyke, if you take your victuals in that crude, unseasoned state. And,
  talking of flavour, do you suppose that there is really any difference
  between that of a lark and that of a sparrow?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled grimly. "I should suppose," said he, "that they were
  indistinguishable; but the question could easily be put to the test of
  experiment."</p>

  <p>"That is true," agreed Marchmont, "and it would really be worth trying,
  for, as you say, sparrows are more easily obtainable than larks. But, about
  this will. I was saying&mdash;er&mdash;now, what was I saying?"</p>

  <p>"I understood you to say," replied Thorndyke, "that the intentions of the
  testator were in some way connected with mustard. Isn't that so, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"That was what I gathered," said I.</p>

  <p>Marchmont gazed at us for a moment with a surprised expression and then,
  laughing good-humouredly, fortified himself with a draught of ale.</p>

  <p>"The moral of which is," Thorndyke added, "that testamentary dispositions
  should not be mixed up with beef-steak pudding."</p>

  <p>"I believe you're right, Thorndyke," said the unabashed solicitor.
  "Business is business and eating is eating. We had better talk over our case
  in my office or your chambers after lunch."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "come over to the Temple with me and I will give
  you a cup of coffee to clear your brain. Are there any documents?"</p>

  <p>"I have all the papers here in my bag," replied Marchmont; and the
  conversation&mdash;such conversation as is possible "when beards wag all"
  over the festive board&mdash;drifted into other channels.</p>

  <p>As soon as the meal was finished and the reckoning paid, we trooped out of
  Wine Office Court, and, insinuating ourselves through the line of empty
  hansoms that, in those days, crawled in a continuous procession on either
  side of Fleet Street, betook ourselves by way of Mitre Court to King's Bench
  Walk. There, when the coffee had been requisitioned and our chairs drawn up
  around the fire, Mr. Marchmont unloaded from his bag a portentous bundle of
  papers, and we addressed ourselves to the business in hand.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Marchmont, "let me repeat what I said before. Legally
  speaking, we have no case&mdash;not the ghost of one. But my client wished to
  take your opinion, and I agreed on the bare chance that you might detect some
  point that we had overlooked. I don't think you will, for we have gone into
  the case very thoroughly, but still, there is the infinitesimal chance and we
  may as well take it. Would you like to read the two wills, or shall I first
  explain the circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "a narrative of the events in the order of
  their occurrence would be most helpful. I should like to know as much as
  possible about the testator before I examine the documents."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Marchmont. "Then I will begin with a recital of the
  circumstances, which, briefly stated, are these: My client, Stephen
  Blackmore, is the son of Mr. Edward Blackmore, deceased. Edward Blackmore had
  two brothers who survived him, John, the elder, and Jeffrey, the younger.
  Jeffrey is the testator in this case.</p>

  <p>"Some two years ago, Jeffrey Blackmore executed a will by which he made
  his nephew Stephen his executor and sole legatee; and a few months later he
  added a codicil giving two hundred and fifty pounds to his brother John."</p>

  <p>"What was the value of the estate?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"About three thousand five hundred pounds, all invested in Consols. The
  testator had a pension from the Foreign Office, on which he lived, leaving
  his capital untouched. Soon after having made his will, he left the rooms in
  Jermyn Street, where he had lived for some years, stored his furniture and
  went to Florence. From thence he moved on to Rome and then to Venice and
  other places in Italy, and so continued to travel about until the end of last
  September, when it appears that he returned to England, for at the beginning
  of October he took a set of chambers in New Inn, which he furnished with some
  of the things from his old rooms. As far as we can make out, he never
  communicated with any of his friends, excepting his brother, and the fact of
  his being in residence at New Inn or of his being in England at all became
  known to them only when he died."</p>

  <p>"Was this quite in accordance with his ordinary habits?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I should say not quite," Blackmore answered. "My uncle was a studious,
  solitary man, but he was not formerly a recluse. He was not much of a
  correspondent but he kept up some sort of communication with his friends. He
  used, for instance, to write to me sometimes, and, when I came down from
  Cambridge for the vacations, he had me to stay with him at his rooms."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything known that accounts for the change in his habits?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is," replied Marchmont. "We shall come to that presently. To
  proceed with the narrative: On the fifteenth of last March he was found dead
  in his chambers, and a more recent will was then discovered, dated the
  twelfth of November of last year. Now no change had taken place in the
  circumstances of the testator to account for the new will, nor was there any
  appreciable alteration in the disposition of the property. As far as we can
  make out, the new will was drawn with the idea of stating the intentions of
  the testator with greater exactness and for the sake of doing away with the
  codicil. The entire property, with the exception of two hundred and fifty
  pounds, was, as before, bequeathed to Stephen, but the separate items were
  specified, and the testator's brother, John Blackmore, was named as the
  executor and residuary legatee."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Thorndyke. "So that your client's interest in the will would
  appear to be practically unaffected by the change."</p>

  <p>"Yes. There it is," exclaimed the lawyer, slapping the table to add
  emphasis to his words. "That is the pity of it! If people who have no
  knowledge of law would only refrain from tinkering at their wills, what a
  world of trouble would be saved!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come!" said Thorndyke. "It is not for a lawyer to say that."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," Marchmont agreed. "Only, you see, we like the muddle
  to be made by the other side. But, in this case, the muddle is on our side.
  The change, as you say, seems to leave our friend Stephen's interests
  unaffected. That is, of course, what poor Jeffrey Blackmore thought. But he
  was mistaken. The effect of the change is absolutely disastrous."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. As I have said, no alteration in the testator's circumstances had
  taken place at the time the new will was executed. <i>But</i> only two days
  before his death, his sister, Mrs. Edmund Wilson, died; and on her will being
  proved it appeared that she had bequeathed to him her entire personalty,
  estimated at about thirty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Heigho!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "What an unfortunate affair!"</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Mr. Marchmont; "it was a disaster. By the original
  will this great sum would have accrued to our friend Mr. Stephen, whereas
  now, of course, it goes to the residuary legatee, Mr. John Blackmore. And
  what makes it even more exasperating is the fact that this is obviously not
  in accordance with the wishes and intentions of Mr. Jeffrey, who clearly
  desired his nephew to inherit his property."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; "I think you are justified in assuming that. But do
  you know whether Mr. Jeffrey was aware of his sister's intentions?"</p>

  <p>"We think not. Her will was executed as recently as the third of September
  last, and it seems that there had been no communication between her and Mr.
  Jeffrey since that date. Besides, if you consider Mr. Jeffrey's actions, you
  will see that they suggest no knowledge or expectation of this very important
  bequest. A man does not make elaborate dispositions in regard to three
  thousand pounds and then leave a sum of thirty thousand to be disposed of
  casually as the residue of the estate."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "And, as you have said, the manifest intention of
  the testator was to leave the bulk of his property to Mr. Stephen. So we may
  take it as virtually certain that Mr. Jeffrey had no knowledge of the fact
  that he was a beneficiary under his sister's will."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Marchmont, "I think we may take that as nearly
  certain."</p>

  <p>"With reference to the second will," said Thorndyke, "I suppose there is
  no need to ask whether the document itself has been examined; I mean as to
  its being a genuine document and perfectly regular?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Marchmont shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I am sorry to say that there can be no possible doubt as
  to the authenticity and regularity of the document. The circumstances under
  which it was executed establish its genuineness beyond any question."</p>

  <p>"What were those circumstances?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"They were these: On the morning of the twelfth of November last, Mr.
  Jeffrey came to the porter's lodge with a document in his hand. 'This,' he
  said, 'is my will. I want you to witness my signature. Would you mind doing
  so, and can you find another respectable person to act as the second
  witness?' Now it happened that a nephew of the porter's, a painter by trade,
  was at work in the Inn. The porter went out and fetched him into the lodge
  and the two men agreed to witness the signature. 'You had better read the
  will,' said Mr. Jeffrey. 'It is not actually necessary, but it is an
  additional safeguard and there is nothing of a private nature in the
  document.' The two men accordingly read the document, and, when Mr. Jeffrey
  had signed it in their presence, they affixed their signatures; and I may add
  that the painter left the recognizable impressions of three greasy
  fingers."</p>

  <p>"And these witnesses have been examined?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They have both sworn to the document and to their own signatures,
  and the painter recognized his finger-marks."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "seems to dispose pretty effectually of any
  question as to the genuineness of the will; and if, as I gather, Mr. Jeffrey
  came to the lodge alone, the question of undue influence is disposed of
  too."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Marchmont. "I think we must pass the will as absolutely
  flawless."</p>

  <p>"It strikes me as rather odd," said Thorndyke, "that Jeffrey should have
  known so little about his sister's intentions. Can you explain it, Mr.
  Blackmore?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that it is very remarkable," Stephen replied. "I knew very
  little of my aunt's affairs and I don't think my uncle Jeffrey knew much
  more, for he was under the impression that she had only a life interest in
  her husband's property. And he may have been right. It is not clear what
  money this was that she left to my uncle. She was a very taciturn woman and
  made few confidences to anyone."</p>

  <p>"So that it is possible," said Thorndyke, "that she, herself, may have
  acquired this money recently by some bequest?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible," Stephen answered.</p>

  <p>"She died, I understand," said Thorndyke, glancing at the notes that he
  had jotted down, "two days before Mr. Jeffrey. What date would that be?"</p>

  <p>"Jeffrey died on the fourteenth of March," said Marchmont.</p>

  <p>"So that Mrs. Wilson died on the twelfth of March?"</p>

  <p>"That is so," Marchmont replied; and Thorndyke then asked:</p>

  <p>"Did she die suddenly?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Stephen; "she died of cancer. I understand that it was
  cancer of the stomach."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know," Thorndyke asked, "what sort of relations existed
  between Jeffrey and his brother John?"</p>

  <p>"At one time," said Stephen, "I know they were not very cordial; but the
  breach may have been made up later, though I don't know that it actually
  was."</p>

  <p>"I ask the question," said Thorndyke, "because, as I dare say you have
  noticed, there is, in the first will, some hint of improved relations. As it
  was originally drawn that will makes Mr. Stephen the sole legatee. Then, a
  little later, a codicil is added in favour of John, showing that Jeffrey had
  felt the necessity of making some recognition of his brother. This seems to
  point to some change in the relations, and the question arises: if such a
  change did actually occur, was it the beginning of a new and further
  improving state of feeling between the two brothers? Have you any facts
  bearing on that question?"</p>

  <p>Marchmont pursed up his lips with the air of a man considering an
  unwelcome suggestion, and, after a few moments of reflection, answered:</p>

  <p>"I think we must say 'yes' to that. There is the undeniable fact that, of
  all Jeffrey's friends, John Blackmore was the only one who knew that he was
  living in New Inn."</p>

  <p>"Oh, John knew that, did he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he certainly did; for it came out in the evidence that he had called
  on Jeffrey at his chambers more than once. There is no denying that. But,
  mark you!" Mr. Marchmont added emphatically, "that does not cover the
  inconsistency of the will. There is nothing in the second will to suggest
  that Jeffrey intended materially to increase the bequest to his brother."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you, Marchmont. I think that is a perfectly sound
  position. You have, I suppose, fully considered the question as to whether it
  would be possible to set aside the second will on the ground that it fails to
  carry out the evident wishes and intentions of the testator?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. My partner, Winwood, and I went into that question very carefully,
  and we also took counsel's opinion&mdash;Sir Horace Barnaby&mdash;and he was
  of the same opinion as ourselves; that the court would certainly uphold the
  will."</p>

  <p>"I think that would be my own view," said Thorndyke, "especially after
  what you have told me. Do I understand that John Blackmore was the only
  person who knew that Jeffrey was in residence at New Inn?"</p>

  <p>"The only one of his private friends. His bankers knew and so did the
  officials from whom he drew his pension."</p>

  <p>"Of course he would have to notify his bankers of his change of
  address."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. And  propos of the bank, I may mention that the manager
  tells me that, of late, they had noticed a slight change in the character of
  Jeffrey's signature&mdash;I think you will see the reason of the change when
  you hear the rest of his story. It was very trifling; not more than commonly
  occurs when a man begins to grow old, especially if there is some failure of
  eyesight."</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Jeffrey's eyesight failing?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was, undoubtedly," said Stephen. "He was practically blind in one
  eye and, in the very last letter that I ever had from him, he mentioned that
  there were signs of commencing cataract in the other."</p>

  <p>"You spoke of his pension. He continued to draw that regularly?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he drew his allowance every month, or rather, his bankers drew it
  for him. They had been accustomed to do so when he was abroad, and the
  authorities seem to have allowed the practice to continue."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected a while, running his eye over the notes on the slips
  of paper in his hand, and Marchmont surveyed him with a malicious smile.
  Presently the latter remarked:</p>

  <p>"Methinks the learned counsel is floored."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed. "It seems to me," he retorted, "that your proceedings
  are rather like those of the amiable individual who offered the bear a flint
  pebble, that he might crack it and extract the kernel. Your confounded will
  seems to offer no soft spot on which one could commence an attack. But we
  won't give up. We seem to have sucked the will dry. Let us now have a few
  facts respecting the parties concerned in it; and, as Jeffrey is the central
  figure, let us begin with him and the tragedy at New Inn that formed the
  starting-point of all this trouble."</p>

  <h2>VI. &mdash; JEFFREY BLACKMORE, DECEASED</h2>

  <p class="first">HAVING made the above proposition, Thorndyke placed a fresh
  slip of paper on the blotting pad on his knee and looked inquiringly at Mr.
  Marchmont; who, in his turn, sighed and looked at the bundle of documents on
  the table.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know?" he asked a little wearily.</p>

  <p>"Everything," replied Thorndyke. "You have hinted at circumstances that
  would account for a change in Jeffrey's habits and that would explain an
  alteration in the character of his signature. Let us have those
  circumstances. And, if I might venture on a suggestion, it would be that we
  take the events in the order in which they occurred or in which they became
  known."</p>

  <p>"That's the worst of you, Thorndyke," Marchmont grumbled. "When a case has
  been squeezed out to the last drop, in a legal sense, you want to begin all
  over again with the family history of every one concerned and a list of his
  effects and household furniture. But I suppose you will have to be humoured;
  and I imagine that the best way in which to give you the information you want
  will be to recite the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey
  Blackmore. Will that suit you?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Thorndyke; and thereupon Marchmont began:</p>

  <p>"The death of Jeffrey Blackmore was discovered at about eleven o'clock in
  the morning of the fifteenth of March. It seems that a builder's man was
  ascending a ladder to examine a gutter on number 31, New Inn, when, on
  passing a second-floor window that was open at the top, he looked in and
  perceived a gentleman lying on a bed. The gentleman was fully clothed and had
  apparently lain down on the bed to rest; at least so the builder thought at
  the time, for he was merely passing the window on his way up, and, very
  properly, did not make a minute examination. But when, some ten minutes
  later, he came down and saw that the gentleman was still in the same
  position, he looked at him more attentively; and this is what he
  noticed&mdash;but perhaps we had better have it in his own words as he told
  the story at the inquest.</p>

  <p>"'When I came to look at the gentleman a bit more closely, it struck me
  that he looked rather queer. His face looked very white, or rather pale
  yellow, like parchment, and his mouth was open. He did not seem to be
  breathing. On the bed by his side was a brass object of some kind&mdash;I
  could not make out what it was&mdash;and he seemed to be holding some small
  metal object in his hand. I thought it rather a queer affair, so, when I came
  down I went across to the lodge and told the porter about it. The porter came
  out across the square with me and I showed him the window. Then he told me to
  go up the stairs to Mr. Blackmore's chambers on the second pair and knock and
  keep on knocking until I got an answer. I went up and knocked and kept on
  knocking as loud as I could, but, though I fetched everybody out of all the
  other chambers in the house, I couldn't get any answer from Mr. Blackmore. So
  I went downstairs again and then Mr. Walker, the porter, sent me for a
  policeman.</p>

  <p>"'I went out and met a policeman just by Dane's Inn and told him about the
  affair, and he came back with me. He and the porter consulted together, and
  then they told me to go up the ladder and get in at the window and open the
  door of the chambers from the inside. So I went up; and as soon as I got in
  at the window I saw that the gentleman was dead. I went through the other
  room and opened the outer door and let in the porter and the policeman.'</p>

  <p>"That," said Mr. Marchmont, laying down the paper containing the
  depositions, "is the way in which poor Jeffrey Blackmore's death came to be
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"The constable reported to his inspector and the inspector sent for the
  divisional surgeon, whom he accompanied to New Inn. I need not go into the
  evidence given by the police officers, as the surgeon saw all that they saw
  and his statement covers everything that is known about Jeffrey's death. This
  is what he says, after describing how he was sent for and arrived at the
  Inn:</p>

  <p>"'In the bedroom I found the body of a man between fifty and sixty years
  of age, which has since been identified in my presence as that of Mr. Jeffrey
  Blackmore. It was fully dressed and wore boots on which was a moderate amount
  of dry mud. It was lying on its back on the bed, which did not appear to have
  been slept in, and showed no sign of any struggle or disturbance. The right
  hand loosely grasped a hypodermic syringe containing a few drops of clear
  liquid which I have since analysed and found to be a concentrated solution of
  strophanthin.</p>

  <p>"'On the bed, close to the left side of the body, was a brass opium-pipe
  of a pattern which I believe is made in China. The bowl of the pipe contained
  a small quantity of charcoal, and a fragment of opium together with some ash,
  and there was on the bed a little ash which appeared to have dropped from the
  bowl when the pipe fell or was laid down. On the mantelshelf in the bedroom I
  found a small glass-stoppered jar containing about an ounce of solid opium,
  and another, larger jar containing wood charcoal broken up into small
  fragments. Also a bowl containing a quantity of ash with fragments of
  half-burned charcoal and a few minute particles of charred opium. By the side
  of the bowl were a knife, a kind of awl or pricker and a very small pair of
  tongs, which I believe to have been used for carrying a piece of lighted
  charcoal to the pipe.</p>

  <p>"'On the dressing-table were two glass tubes labelled "Hypodermic
  Tabloids: Strophanthin 1/500 grain," and a minute glass mortar and pestle, of
  which the former contained a few crystals which have since been analysed by
  me and found to be strophanthin.</p>

  <p>"'On examining the body, I found that it had been dead about twelve hours.
  There were no marks of violence or any abnormal condition excepting a single
  puncture in the right thigh, apparently made by the needle of the hypodermic
  syringe. The puncture was deep and vertical in direction as if the needle had
  been driven in through the clothing.</p>

  <p>"'I made a post-mortem examination of the body and found that death was
  due to poisoning by strophanthin, which appeared to have been injected into
  the thigh. The two tubes which I found on the dressing-table would each have
  contained, if full, twenty tabloids, each tabloid representing one
  five-hundredth of a grain of strophanthin. Assuming that the whole of this
  quantity was injected the amount taken would be forty five-hundredths, or
  about one twelfth of a grain. The ordinary medicinal dose of strophanthin is
  one five-hundredth of a grain.</p>

  <p>"'I also found in the body appreciable traces of morphine&mdash;the
  principal alkaloid of opium&mdash;from which I infer that the deceased was a
  confirmed opium-smoker. This inference was supported by the general condition
  of the body, which was ill-nourished and emaciated and presented all the
  appearances usually met with in the bodies of persons addicted to the
  habitual use of opium.'</p>

  <p>"That is the evidence of the surgeon. He was recalled later, as we shall
  see, but, meanwhile, I think you will agree with me that the facts testified
  to by him fully account, not only for the change in Jeffrey's
  habits&mdash;his solitary and secretive mode of life&mdash;but also for the
  alteration in his handwriting."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke, "that seems to be so. By the way, what did the
  change in the handwriting amount to?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," replied Marchmont. "It was hardly perceptible. Just a
  slight loss of firmness and distinctness; such a trifling change as you would
  expect to find in the handwriting of a man who had taken to drink or drugs,
  or anything that might impair the steadiness of his hand. I should not have
  noticed it, myself, but, of course, the people at the bank are experts,
  constantly scrutinizing signatures and scrutinizing them with a very critical
  eye."</p>

  <p>"Is there any other evidence that bears on the case?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>Marchmont turned over the bundle of papers and smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Thorndyke," he said, "none of this evidence has the slightest
  bearing on the case. It is all perfectly irrelevant as far as the will is
  concerned. But I know your little peculiarities and I am indulging you, as
  you see, to the top of your bent. The next evidence is that of the chief
  porter, a very worthy and intelligent man named Walker. This is what he says,
  after the usual preliminaries.</p>

  <p>"'I have viewed the body which forms the subject of this inquiry. It is
  that of Mr. Jeffrey Blackmore, the tenant of a set of chambers on the second
  floor of number thirty-one, New Inn. I have known the deceased nearly six
  months, and during that time have seen and conversed with him frequently. He
  took the chambers on the second of last October and came into residence at
  once. Tenants at New Inn have to furnish two references. The references that
  the deceased gave were his bankers and his brother, Mr. John Blackmore. I may
  say that the deceased was very well known to me. He was a quiet,
  pleasant-mannered gentleman, and it was his habit to drop in occasionally at
  the lodge and have a chat with me. I went into his chambers with him once or
  twice on some small matters of business and I noticed that there were always
  a number of books and papers on the table. I understood from him that he
  spent most of his time indoors engaged in study and writing. I know very
  little about his way of living. He had no laundress to look after his rooms,
  so I suppose he did his own house-work and cooking; but he told me that he
  took most of his meals outside, at restaurants or his club.</p>

  <p>"'Deceased impressed me as a rather melancholy, low-spirited gentleman. He
  was very much troubled about his eyesight and mentioned the matter to me on
  several occasions. He told me that he was practically blind in one eye and
  that the sight of the other was failing rapidly. He said that this afflicted
  him greatly, because his only pleasure in life was in the reading of books,
  and that if he could not read he should not wish to live. On another occasion
  he said that "to a blind man life was not worth living."</p>

  <p>"'On the twelfth of last November he came to the lodge with a paper in his
  hand which he said was his will'&mdash;But I needn't read that," said
  Marchmont, turning over the leaf, "I've told you how the will was signed and
  witnessed. We will pass on to the day of poor Jeffrey's death.</p>

  <p>"'On the fourteenth of March,' the porter says, 'at about half-past six in
  the evening, the deceased came to the Inn in a four-wheeled cab. That was the
  day of the great fog. I do not know if there was anyone in the cab with the
  deceased, but I think not, because he came to the lodge just before eight
  o'clock and had a little talk with me. He said that he had been overtaken by
  the fog and could not see at all. He was quite blind and had been obliged to
  ask a stranger to call a cab for him as he could not find his way through the
  streets. He then gave me a cheque for the rent. I reminded him that the rent
  was not due until the twenty-fifth, but he said he wished to pay it now. He
  also gave me some money to pay one or two small bills that were owing to some
  of the tradespeople&mdash;a milk-man, a baker and a stationer.</p>

  <p>"'This struck me as very strange, because he had always managed his
  business and paid the tradespeople himself. He told me that the fog had
  irritated his eye so that he could hardly read, and he was afraid he should
  soon be quite blind. He was very depressed; so much so that I felt quite
  uneasy about him. When he left the lodge, he went back across the square as
  if returning to his chambers. There was then no gate open excepting the main
  gate where the lodge is situated. That was the last time that I saw the
  deceased alive.'"</p>

  <p>Mr. Marchmont laid the paper on the table. "That is the porter's evidence.
  The remaining depositions are those of Noble, the night porter, John
  Blackmore and our friend here, Mr. Stephen. The night porter had not much to
  tell. This is the substance of his evidence:</p>

  <p>"'I have viewed the body of the deceased and identify it as that of Mr.
  Jeffrey Blackmore. I knew the deceased well by sight and occasionally had a
  few words with him. I know nothing of his habits excepting that he used to
  sit up rather late. It is one of my duties to go round the Inn at night and
  call out the hours until one o'clock in the morning. When calling out "one
  o'clock" I often saw a light in the sitting-room of the deceased's chambers.
  On the night of the fourteenth instant, the light was burning until past one
  o'clock, but it was in the bedroom. The light in the sitting-room was out by
  ten o'clock.'</p>

  <p>"We now come to John Blackmore's evidence. He says:</p>

  <p>"'I have viewed the body of the deceased and recognize it as that of my
  brother Jeffrey. I last saw him alive on the twenty-third of February, when I
  called at his chambers. He then seemed in a very despondent state of mind and
  told me that his eyesight was fast failing. I was aware that he occasionally
  smoked opium, but I did not know that it was a confirmed habit. I urged him,
  on several occasions, to abandon the practice. I have no reason to believe
  that his affairs were in any way embarrassed or that he had any reason for
  making away with himself other than his failing eyesight; but, having regard
  to his state of mind when I last saw him, I am not surprised at what has
  happened.'</p>

  <p>"That is the substance of John Blackmore's evidence, and, as to Mr.
  Stephen, his statement merely sets forth the fact that he had identified the
  body as that of his uncle Jeffrey. And now I think you have all the facts. Is
  there anything more that you want to ask me before I go, for I must really
  run away now?"</p>

  <p>"I should like," said Thorndyke, "to know a little more about the parties
  concerned in this affair. But perhaps Mr. Stephen can give me the
  information."</p>

  <p>"I expect he can," said Marchmont; "at any rate, he knows more about them
  than I do; so I will be off. If you should happen to think of any way," he
  continued, with a sly smile, "of upsetting that will, just let me know, and I
  will lose no time in entering a caveat. Good-bye! Don't trouble to let me
  out."</p>

  <p>As soon as he was gone, Thorndyke turned to Stephen Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"I am going," he said, "to ask you a few questions which may appear rather
  trifling, but you must remember that my methods of inquiry concern themselves
  with persons and things rather than with documents. For instance, I have not
  gathered very completely what sort of person your uncle Jeffrey was. Could
  you tell me a little more about him?"</p>

  <p>"What shall I tell you?" Stephen asked with a slightly embarrassed
  air.</p>

  <p>"Well, begin with his personal appearance."</p>

  <p>"That is rather difficult to describe," said Stephen. "He was a
  medium-sized man and about five feet seven&mdash;fair, slightly grey,
  clean-shaved, rather spare and slight, had grey eyes, wore spectacles and
  stooped a little as he walked. He was quiet and gentle in manner, rather
  yielding and irresolute in character, and his health was not at all robust
  though he had no infirmity or disease excepting his bad eyesight. His age was
  about fifty-five."</p>

  <p>"How came he to be a civil-service pensioner at fifty-five?" asked
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was through an accident. He had a nasty fall from a horse, and,
  being a rather nervous man, the shock was very severe. For some time after he
  was a complete wreck. But the failure of his eyesight was the actual cause of
  his retirement. It seems that the fall damaged his eyes in some way; in fact
  he practically lost the sight of one&mdash;the right&mdash;from that moment;
  and, as that had been his good eye, the accident left his vision very much
  impaired. So that he was at first given sick leave and then allowed to retire
  on a pension."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke noted these particulars and then said:</p>

  <p>"Your uncle has been more than once referred to as a man of studious
  habits. Does that mean that he pursued any particular branch of
  learning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was an enthusiastic Oriental scholar. His official duties had
  taken him at one time to Yokohama and Tokio and at another to Bagdad, and
  while at those places he gave a good deal of attention to the languages,
  literature and arts of the countries. He was also greatly interested in
  Babylonian and Assyrian archaeology, and I believe he assisted for some time
  in the excavations at Birs Nimroud."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Thorndyke. "This is very interesting. I had no idea that he
  was a man of such considerable attainments. The facts mentioned by Mr.
  Marchmont would hardly have led one to think of him as what he seems to have
  been: a scholar of some distinction."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that Mr. Marchmont realized the fact himself," said Stephen;
  "or that he would have considered it of any moment if he had. Nor, as far as
  that goes, do I. But, of course, I have no experience of legal matters."</p>

  <p>"You can never tell beforehand," said Thorndyke, "what facts may turn out
  to be of moment, so that it is best to collect all you can get. By the way,
  were you aware that your uncle was an opium-smoker?"</p>

  <p>"No, I was not. I knew that he had an opium-pipe which he brought with him
  when he came home from Japan; but I thought it was only a curio. I remember
  him telling me that he once tried a few puffs at an opium-pipe and found it
  rather pleasant, though it gave him a headache. But I had no idea he had
  contracted the habit; in fact, I may say that I was utterly astonished when
  the fact came out at the inquest."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made a note of this answer, too, and said:</p>

  <p>"I think that is all I have to ask you about your uncle Jeffrey. And now
  as to Mr. John Blackmore. What sort of man is he?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't tell you very much about him. Until I saw him at the
  inquest, I had not met him since I was a boy. But he is a very different kind
  of man from Uncle Jeffrey; different in appearance and different in
  character."</p>

  <p>"You would say that the two brothers were physically quite unlike,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Stephen, "I don't know that I ought to say that. Perhaps I am
  exaggerating the difference. I am thinking of Uncle Jeffrey as he was when I
  saw him last and of uncle John as he appeared at the inquest. They were very
  different then. Jeffrey was thin, pale, clean shaven, wore spectacles and
  walked with a stoop. John is a shade taller, a shade greyer, has good
  eyesight, a healthy, florid complexion, a brisk, upright carriage, is
  distinctly stout and wears a beard and moustache which are black and only
  very slightly streaked with grey. To me they looked as unlike as two men
  could, though their features were really of the same type; indeed, I have
  heard it said that, as young men, they were rather alike, and they both
  resembled their mother. But there is no doubt as to their difference in
  character. Jeffrey was quiet, serious and studious, whereas John rather
  inclined to what is called a fast life; he used to frequent race meetings,
  and, I think, gambled a good deal at times."</p>

  <p>"What is his profession?"</p>

  <p>"That would be difficult to tell; he has so many; he is so very versatile.
  I believe he began life as an articled pupil in the laboratory of a large
  brewery, but he soon left that and went on the stage. He seems to have
  remained in 'the profession' for some years, touring about this country and
  making occasional visits to America. The life seemed to suit him and I
  believe he was decidedly successful as an actor. But suddenly he left the
  stage and blossomed out in connection with a bucket-shop in London."</p>

  <p>"And what is he doing now?"</p>

  <p>"At the inquest he described himself as a stockbroker, so I presume he is
  still connected with the bucket-shop."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke rose, and taking down from the reference shelves a list of
  members of the Stock Exchange, turned over the leaves.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, replacing the volume, "he must be an outside broker. His
  name is not in the list of members of 'the House.' From what you tell me, it
  is easy to understand that there should have been no great intimacy between
  the two brothers, without assuming any kind of ill-feeling. They simply had
  very little in common. Do you know of anything more?"</p>

  <p>"No. I have never heard of any actual quarrel or disagreement. My
  impression that they did not get on very well may have been, I think, due to
  the terms of the will, especially the first will. And they certainly did not
  seek one another's society."</p>

  <p>"That is not very conclusive," said Thorndyke. "As to the will, a thrifty
  man is not usually much inclined to bequeath his savings to a gentleman who
  may probably employ them in a merry little flutter on the turf or the Stock
  Exchange. And then there was yourself; clearly a more suitable subject for a
  legacy, as your life is all before you. But this is mere speculation and the
  matter is not of much importance, as far as we can see. And now, tell me what
  John Blackmore's relations were with Mrs. Wilson. I gather that she left the
  bulk of her property to Jeffrey, her younger brother. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She left nothing to John. The fact is that they were hardly on
  speaking terms. I believe John had treated her rather badly, or, at any rate,
  she thought he had. Mr. Wilson, her late husband, dropped some money over an
  investment in connection with the bucket-shop that I spoke of, and I think
  she suspected John of having let him in. She may have been mistaken, but you
  know what ladies are when they get an idea into their heads."</p>

  <p>"Did you know your aunt well?"</p>

  <p>"No; very slightly. She lived down in Devonshire and saw very little of
  any of us. She was a taciturn, strong-minded woman; quite unlike her
  brothers. She seems to have resembled her father's family."</p>

  <p>"You might give me her full name."</p>

  <p>"Julia Elizabeth Wilson. Her husband's name was Edmund Wilson."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. There is just one more point. What has happened to your
  uncle's chambers in New Inn since his death?"</p>

  <p>"They have remained shut up. As all his effects were left to me, I have
  taken over the tenancy for the present to avoid having them disturbed. I
  thought of keeping them for my own use, but I don't think I could live in
  them after what I have seen."</p>

  <p>"You have inspected them, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I have just looked through them. I went there on the day of the
  inquest."</p>

  <p>"Now tell me: as you looked through those rooms, what kind of impression
  did they convey to you as to your uncle's habits and mode of life?"</p>

  <p>Stephen smiled apologetically. "I am afraid," said he, "that they did not
  convey any particular impression in that respect. I looked into the
  sitting-room and saw all his old familiar household gods, and then I went
  into the bedroom and saw the impression on the bed where his corpse had lain;
  and that gave me such a sensation of horror that I came away at once."</p>

  <p>"But the appearance of the rooms must have conveyed something to your
  mind," Thorndyke urged.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it did not. You see, I have not your analytical eye. But
  perhaps you would like to look through them yourself? If you would, pray do
  so. They are my chambers now."</p>

  <p>"I think I should like to glance round them," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Stephen. "I will give you my card now, and I will look
  in at the lodge presently and tell the porter to hand you the key whenever
  you like to look over the rooms."</p>

  <p>He took a card from his case, and, having written a few lines on it,
  handed it to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you," he said, "to take so much trouble. Like Mr.
  Marchmont, I have no expectation of any result from your efforts, but I am
  very grateful to you, all the same, for going into the case so thoroughly. I
  suppose you don't see any possibility of upsetting that will&mdash;if I may
  ask the question?"</p>

  <p>"At present," replied Thorndyke, "I do not. But until I have carefully
  weighed every fact connected with the case&mdash;whether it seems to have any
  bearing or not&mdash;I shall refrain from expressing, or even entertaining,
  an opinion either way."</p>

  <p>Stephen Blackmore now took his leave; and Thorndyke, having collected the
  papers containing his notes, neatly punched a couple of holes in their
  margins and inserted them into a small file, which he slipped into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"That," said he, "is the nucleus of the body of data on which our
  investigations must be based; and I very much fear that it will not receive
  any great additions. What do you think, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"The case looks about as hopeless as a case could look," I replied.</p>

  <p>"That is what I think," said he; "and for that reason I am more than
  ordinarily keen on making something of it. I have not much more hope than
  Marchmont has; but I shall squeeze the case as dry as a bone before I let go.
  What are you going to do? I have to attend a meeting of the board of
  directors of the Griffin Life Office."</p>

  <p>"Shall I walk down with you?"</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you to offer, Jervis, but I think I will go alone. I
  want to run over these notes and get the facts of the case arranged in my
  mind. When I have done that, I shall be ready to pick up new matter.
  Knowledge is of no use unless it is actually in your mind, so that it can be
  produced at a moment's notice. So you had better get a book and your pipe and
  spend a quiet hour by the fire while I assimilate the miscellaneous mental
  feast that we have just enjoyed. And you might do a little rumination
  yourself."</p>

  <p>With this, Thorndyke took his departure; and I, adopting his advice, drew
  my chair closer to the fire and filled my pipe. But I did not discover any
  inclination to read. The curious history that I had just heard, and
  Thorndyke's evident determination to elucidate it further, disposed me to
  meditation. Moreover, as his subordinate, it was my business to occupy myself
  with his affairs. Wherefore, having stirred the fire and got my pipe well
  alight, I abandoned myself to the renewed consideration of the facts relating
  to Jeffrey Blackmore's will.</p>

  <h2>VII. &mdash; THE CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTION</h2>

  <p class="first">THE surprise which Thorndyke's proceedings usually
  occasioned, especially to lawyers, was principally due, I think, to my
  friend's habit of viewing occurrences from an unusual standpoint. He did not
  look at things quite as other men looked at them. He had no prejudices and he
  knew no conventions. When other men were cocksure, Thorndyke was doubtful.
  When other men despaired, he entertained hopes; and thus it happened that he
  would often undertake cases that had been rejected contemptuously by
  experienced lawyers, and, what is more, would bring them to a successful
  issue.</p>

  <p>Thus it had been in the only other case in which I had been personally
  associated with him&mdash;the so-called "Red Thumb Mark" case. There he was
  presented with an apparent impossibility; but he had given it careful
  consideration. Then, from the category of the impossible he had brought it to
  that of the possible; from the merely possible to the actually probable; from
  the probable to the certain; and in the end had won the case
  triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Was it conceivable that he could make anything of the present case? He had
  not declined it. He had certainly entertained it and was probably thinking it
  over at this moment. Yet could anything be more impossible? Here was the case
  of a man making his own will, probably writing it out himself, bringing it
  voluntarily to a certain place and executing it in the presence of competent
  witnesses. There was no suggestion of any compulsion or even influence or
  persuasion. The testator was admittedly sane and responsible; and if the will
  did not give effect to his wishes&mdash;which, however, could not be
  proved&mdash;that was due to his own carelessness in drafting the will and
  not to any unusual circumstances. And the problem&mdash;which Thorndyke
  seemed to be considering&mdash;was how to set aside that will.</p>

  <p>I reviewed the statements that I had heard, but turn them about as I
  would, I could get nothing out of them but confirmation of Mr. Marchmont's
  estimate of the case. One fact that I had noted with some curiosity I again
  considered; that was Thorndyke's evident desire to inspect Jeffrey
  Blackmore's chambers. He had, it is true, shown no eagerness, but I had seen
  at the time that the questions which he put to Stephen were put, not with any
  expectation of eliciting information but for the purpose of getting an
  opportunity to look over the rooms himself.</p>

  <p>I was still cogitating on the subject when my colleague returned, followed
  by the watchful Polton with the tea-tray, and I attacked him forthwith.</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," I said, "I have been thinking about this Blackmore case
  while you have been gadding about."</p>

  <p>"And may I take it that the problem is solved?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm hanged if you may. I can make nothing of it."</p>

  <p>"Then you are in much the same position as I am."</p>

  <p>"But, if you can make nothing of it, why did you undertake it?"</p>

  <p>"I only undertook to think about it," said Thorndyke. "I never reject a
  case off-hand unless it is obviously fishy. It is surprising how
  difficulties, and even impossibilities, dwindle if you look at them
  attentively. My experience has taught me that the most unlikely case is, at
  least, worth thinking over."</p>

  <p>"By the way, why do you want to look over Jeffrey's chambers? What do you
  expect to find there?"</p>

  <p>"I have no expectations at all. I am simply looking for stray facts."</p>

  <p>"And all those questions that you asked Stephen Blackmore; had you nothing
  in your mind&mdash;no definite purpose?"</p>

  <p>"No purpose beyond getting to know as much about the case as I can."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "do you mean that you are going to examine those rooms
  without any definite object at all?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," replied Thorndyke. "This is a legal case. Let me
  put an analogous medical case as being more within your present sphere.
  Supposing that a man should consult you, say, about a progressive loss of
  weight. He can give no explanation. He has no pain, no discomfort, no
  symptoms of any kind; in short, he feels perfectly well in every respect;
  <i>but</i> he is losing weight continuously. What would you do?"</p>

  <p>"I should overhaul him thoroughly," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Why? What would you expect to find?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I should start by expecting to find anything in
  particular. But I should overhaul him organ by organ and function by
  function, and if I could find nothing abnormal I should have to give it
  up."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "And that is just my position and my line of
  action. Here is a case which is perfectly regular and straightforward
  excepting in one respect. It has a single abnormal feature. And for that
  abnormality there is nothing to account.</p>

  <p>"Jeffrey Blackmore made a will. It was a well-drawn will and it apparently
  gave full effect to his intentions. Then he revoked that will and made
  another. No change had occurred in his circumstances or in his intentions.
  The provisions of the new will were believed by him to be identical with
  those of the old one. The new will differed from the old one only in having a
  defect in the drafting from which the first will was free, and of which he
  must have been unaware. Now why did he revoke the first will and replace it
  with another which he believed to be identical in its provisions? There is no
  answer to that question. It is an abnormal feature in the case. There must be
  some explanation of that abnormality and it is my business to discover it.
  But the facts in my possession yield no such explanation. Therefore it is my
  purpose to search for new facts which may give me a starting-point for an
  investigation."</p>

  <p>This exposition of Thorndyke's proposed conduct of the case, reasonable as
  it was, did not impress me as very convincing. I found myself coming back to
  Marchmont's position, that there was really nothing in dispute. But other
  matters claimed our attention at the moment, and it was not until after
  dinner that my colleague reverted to the subject.</p>

  <p>"How should you like to take a turn round to New Inn this evening?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought," said I, "that it would be better to go by
  daylight. Those old chambers are not usually very well illuminated."</p>

  <p>"That is well thought of," said Thorndyke. "We had better take a lamp with
  us. Let us go up to the laboratory and get one from Polton."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to do that," said I. "The pocket-lamp that you lent me
  is in my overcoat pocket. I put it there to return it to you."</p>

  <p>"Did you have occasion to use it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I paid another visit to the mysterious house and carried out your
  plan. I must tell you about it later."</p>

  <p>"Do. I shall be keenly interested to hear all about your adventures. Is
  there plenty of candle left in the lamp?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. I only used it for about an hour."</p>

  <p>"Then let us be off," said Thorndyke; and we accordingly set forth on our
  quest; and, as we went, I reflected once more on the apparent vagueness of
  our proceedings. Presently I reopened the subject with Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine," said I, "that you have absolutely nothing in view. That
  you are going to this place with no defined purpose whatever."</p>

  <p>"I did not say exactly that," replied Thorndyke. "I said that I was not
  going to look for any particular thing or fact. I am going in the hope that I
  may observe something that may start a new train of speculation. But that is
  not all. You know that an investigation follows a certain logical course. It
  begins with the observation of the conspicuous facts. We have done that. The
  facts were supplied by Marchmont. The next stage is to propose to oneself one
  or more provisional explanations or hypotheses. We have done that,
  too&mdash;or, at least I have, and I suppose you have."</p>

  <p>"I haven't," said I. "There is Jeffrey's will, but why he should have made
  the change I cannot form the foggiest idea. But I should like to hear your
  provisional theories on the subject."</p>

  <p>"You won't hear them at present. They are mere wild conjectures. But to
  resume: what do we do next?"</p>

  <p>"Go to New Inn and rake over the deceased gentleman's apartments."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smilingly ignored my answer and continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We examine each explanation in turn and see what follows from it; whether
  it agrees with all the facts and leads to the discovery of new ones, or, on
  the other hand, disagrees with some facts or leads us to an absurdity. Let us
  take a simple example.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we find scattered over a field a number of largish masses of
  stone, which are entirely different in character from the rocks found in the
  neighbourhood. The question arises, how did those stones get into that field?
  Three explanations are proposed. One: that they are the products of former
  volcanic action; two: that they were brought from a distance by human agency;
  three: that they were carried thither from some distant country by icebergs.
  Now each of those explanations involves certain consequences. If the stones
  are volcanic, then they were once in a state of fusion. But we find that they
  are unaltered limestone and contain fossils. Then they are not volcanic. If
  they were borne by icebergs, then they were once part of a glacier and some
  of them will probably show the flat surfaces with parallel scratches which
  are found on glacier-borne stones. We examine them and find the
  characteristic scratched surfaces. Then they have probably been brought to
  this place by icebergs. But this does not exclude human agency, for they
  might have been brought by men to this place from some other where the
  icebergs had deposited them. A further comparison with other facts would be
  needed.</p>

  <p>"So we proceed in cases like this present one. Of the facts that are known
  to us we invent certain explanations. From each of those explanations we
  deduce consequences; and if those consequences agree with new facts, they
  confirm the explanation, whereas if they disagree they tend to disprove it.
  But here we are at our destination."</p>

  <p>We turned out of Wych Street into the arched passage leading into New Inn,
  and, halting at the half-door of the lodge, perceived a stout, purple-faced
  man crouching over the fire, coughing violently. He held up his hand to
  intimate that he was fully occupied for the moment, and we accordingly waited
  for his paroxysm to subside. At length he turned towards us, wiping his eyes,
  and inquired our business.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stephen Blackmore," said Thorndyke, "has given me permission to look
  over his chambers. He said that he would mention the matter to you."</p>

  <p>"So he has, sir," said the porter; "but he has just taken the key himself
  to go to the chambers. If you walk across the Inn you'll find him there; it's
  on the farther side; number thirty-one, second floor."</p>

  <p>We made our way across to the house indicated, the ground floor of which
  was occupied by a solicitor's offices and was distinguished by a good-sized
  brass plate. Although it had now been dark some time there was no light on
  the lower stairs, but we encountered on the first-floor landing a man who had
  just lit the lamp there. Thorndyke halted to address him.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me who occupies the chambers on the third floor?"</p>

  <p>"The third floor has been empty about three months," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"We are going up to look at the chambers on the second floor," said
  Thorndyke. "Are they pretty quiet?"</p>

  <p>"Quiet!" exclaimed the man. "Lord bless you the place is like a cemetery
  for the deaf and dumb. There's the solicitors on the ground floor and the
  architects on the first floor. They both clear out about six, and when
  they're gone the house is as empty as a blown hegg. I don't wonder poor Mr.
  Blackmore made away with his-self. Livin' up there all alone, it must have
  been like Robinson Crusoe without no man Friday and not even a blooming goat
  to talk to. Quiet! It's quiet enough, if that's what you want. Wouldn't be no
  good to <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>With a contemptuous shake of the head, he turned and retired down the next
  flight, and, as the echoes of his footsteps died away we resumed our
  ascent.</p>

  <p>"So it would appear," Thorndyke commented, "that when Jeffrey Blackmore
  came home that last evening, the house was empty."</p>

  <p>Arrived on the second-floor landing, we were confronted by a solid-looking
  door on the lintel of which the deceased man's name was painted in white
  lettering which still looked new and fresh. Thorndyke knocked at the door,
  which was at once opened by Stephen Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"I haven't wasted any time before taking advantage of your permission, you
  see," my colleague said as we entered.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," said Stephen; "you are very prompt. I have been rather
  wondering what kind of information you expect to gather from an inspection of
  these rooms."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled genially, amused, no doubt, by the similarity of
  Stephen's remarks to those of mine which he had so recently criticized.</p>

  <p>"A man of science, Mr. Blackmore," he said, "expects nothing. He collects
  facts and keeps an open mind. As to me, I am a mere legal Autolycus, a
  snapper-up of unconsidered trifles of evidence. When I have accumulated a few
  facts, I arrange them, compare them and think about them. Sometimes the
  comparison yields new matter and sometimes it doesn't; but in any case,
  believe me, it is a capital error to decide beforehand what data are to be
  sought for."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose that is so," said Stephen; "though, to me, it almost looks
  as if Mr. Marchmont was right; that there is nothing to investigate."</p>

  <p>"You should have thought of that before you consulted me," laughed
  Thorndyke. "As it is, I am engaged to look into the case and I shall do so;
  and, as I have said, I shall keep an open mind until I have all the facts in
  my possession."</p>

  <p>He glanced round the sitting-room, which we had now entered, and
  continued:</p>

  <p>"These are fine, dignified old rooms. It seems a sin to have covered up
  all this oak panelling and that carved cornice and mantel with paint. Think
  what it must have been like when the beautiful figured wood was exposed."</p>

  <p>"It would be very dark," Stephen observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "and I suppose we care more for light and less
  for beauty than our ancestors did. But now, tell me; looking round these
  rooms, do they convey to you a similar impression to that which the old rooms
  did? Have they the same general character?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite, I think. Of course the rooms in Jermyn Street were in a
  different kind of house, but beyond that, I seem to feel a certain
  difference; which is rather odd, seeing that the furniture is the same. But
  the old rooms were more cosy, more homelike. I find something rather bare and
  cheerless, I was almost going to say squalid, in the look of these
  chambers."</p>

  <p>"That is rather what I should have expected," said Thorndyke. "The opium
  habit alters a man's character profoundly; and, somehow, apart from the mere
  furnishing, a room reflects in some subtle way, but very distinctly, the
  personality of its occupant, especially when that occupant lives a solitary
  life. Do you see any evidences of the activities that used to occupy your
  uncle?"</p>

  <p>"Not very much," replied Stephen. "But the place may not be quite as he
  left it. I found one or two of his books on the table and put them back in
  the shelves, but I found no manuscript or notes such as he used to make. I
  noticed, too, that his ink-slab which he used to keep so scrupulously clean
  is covered with dry smears and that the stick of ink is all cracked at the
  end, as if he had not used it for months. It seems to point to a great change
  in his habits."</p>

  <p>"What used he to do with Chinese ink?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"He corresponded with some of his native friends in Japan, and he used to
  write in the Japanese character even if they understood English. That was
  what he chiefly used the Chinese ink for. But he also used to copy the
  inscriptions from these things." Here Stephen lifted from the mantelpiece
  what looked like a fossil Bath bun, but was actually a clay tablet covered
  with minute indented writing.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle could read the cuneiform character, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he was something of an expert. These tablets are, I believe, leases
  and other legal documents from Eridu and other Babylonian cities. He used to
  copy the inscriptions in the cuneiform writing and then translate them into
  English. But I mustn't stay here any longer as I have an engagement for this
  evening. I just dropped in to get these two volumes&mdash;<i>Thornton's
  History of Babylonia</i>, which he once advised me to read. Shall I give you
  the key? You'd better have it and leave it with the porter as you go
  out."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with us and we walked out with him to the landing and stood
  watching him as he ran down the stairs. Glancing at Thorndyke by the light of
  the gas lamp on the landing, I thought I detected in his impassive face that
  almost imperceptible change of expression to which I have already alluded as
  indicating pleasure or satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"You are looking quite pleased with yourself," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am not displeased," he replied calmly. "Autolycus has picked up a few
  crumbs; very small ones, but still crumbs. No doubt his learned junior has
  picked up a few likewise?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head&mdash;and inwardly suspected it of being rather a thick
  head.</p>

  <p>"I did not perceive anything in the least degree significant in what
  Stephen was telling you," said I. "It was all very interesting, but it did
  not seem to have any bearing on his uncle's will."</p>

  <p>"I was not referring only to what Stephen has told us, although that was,
  as you say, very interesting. While he was talking I was looking about the
  room, and I have seen a very strange thing. Let me show it to you."</p>

  <p>He linked his arm in mine and, walking me back into the room, halted
  opposite the fire-place.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, "look at that. It is a most remarkable object."</p>

<p class="caption">The Inverted Inscription.</p>
</div>
<br>

  <p>I followed the direction of his gaze and saw an oblong frame enclosing a
  large photograph of an inscription in the weird and cabalistic arrow-head
  character. I looked at it in silence for some seconds and then, somewhat
  disappointed, remarked:</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything very remarkable in it, under the circumstances. In
  any ordinary room it would be, I admit; but Stephen has just told us that his
  uncle was something of an expert in cuneiform writing."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke. "That is my point. That is what makes it so
  remarkable."</p>

  <p>"I don't follow you at all," said I. "That a man should hang upon his wall
  an inscription that is legible to him does not seem to me at all out of the
  way. It would be much more singular if he should hang up an inscription that
  he could <i>not</i> read."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," replied Thorndyke. "But you will agree with me that it would
  be still more singular if a man should hang upon his wall an inscription that
  he <i>could</i> read&mdash;and hang it upside down."</p>

  <p>I stared at Thorndyke in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me," I exclaimed, "that that photograph is really
  upside down?"</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," he replied.</p>

  <p>"But how do you know? Have we here yet another Oriental scholar?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "Some fool," he replied, "has said that 'a little
  knowledge is a dangerous thing.' Compared with much knowledge, it may be; but
  it is a vast deal better than no knowledge. Here is a case in point. I have
  read with very keen interest the wonderful history of the decipherment of the
  cuneiform writing, and I happen to recollect one or two of the main facts
  that seemed to me to be worth remembering. This particular inscription is in
  the Persian cuneiform, a much more simple and open form of the script than
  the Babylonian or Assyrian; in fact, I suspect that this is the famous
  inscription from the gateway at Persepolis&mdash;the first to be deciphered;
  which would account for its presence here in a frame. Now this script
  consists, as you see, of two kinds of characters; the small, solid, acutely
  pointed characters which are known as wedges, and the larger, more obtuse
  characters, somewhat like our government broad arrows, and called
  arrow-heads. The names are rather unfortunate, as both forms are wedge-like
  and both resemble arrow-heads. The script reads from left to right, like our
  own writing, and unlike that of the Semitic peoples and the primitive Greeks;
  and the rule for the placing of the characters is that all the 'wedges' point
  to the right or downwards and the arrow-head forms are open towards the
  right. But if you look at this photograph you will see that all the wedges
  point upwards to the left and that the arrow-head characters are open towards
  the left. Obviously the photograph is upside down."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "this is really most mysterious. What do you suppose
  can be the explanation?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "that we may perhaps get a suggestion from
  the back of the frame. Let us see."</p>

  <p>He disengaged the frame from the two nails on which it hung, and, turning
  it round, glanced at the back; which he then presented for my inspection. A
  label on the backing paper bore the words, "J. Budge, Frame-maker and Gilder,
  16, Gt. Anne Street, W.C."</p>

  <p>"Well?" I said, when I had read the label without gathering from it
  anything fresh.</p>

  <p>"The label, you observe, is the right way up as it hangs on the wall."</p>

  <p>"So it is," I rejoined hastily, a little annoyed that I had not been
  quicker to observe so obvious a fact. "I see your point. You mean that the
  frame-maker hung the thing upside down and Jeffrey never noticed the
  mistake?"</p>

  <p>"That is a perfectly sound explanation," said Thorndyke. "But I think
  there is something more. You will notice that the label is an old one; it
  must have been on some years, to judge by its dingy appearance, whereas the
  two mirror-plates look to me comparatively new. But we can soon put that
  matter to the test, for the label was evidently stuck on when the frame was
  new, and if the plates were screwed on at the same time, the wood that they
  cover will be clean and new-looking."</p>

  <p>He drew from his pocket a "combination" knife containing, among other
  implements, a screw-driver, with which he carefully extracted the screws from
  one of the little brass plates by which the frame had been suspended from the
  nails.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, when he had removed the plate and carried the
  photograph over to the gasjet, "the wood covered by the plate is as dirty and
  time-stained as the rest of the frame. The plates have been put on
  recently."</p>

  <p>"And what are we to infer from that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, since there are no other marks of plates or rings upon the frame,
  we may safely infer that the photograph was never hung up until it came to
  these rooms."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose we may. But what then? What inference does that lead
  to?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected for a few moments and I continued:</p>

  <p>"It is evident that this photograph suggests more to you than it does to
  me. I should like to hear your exposition of its bearing on the case, if it
  has any."</p>

  <p>"Whether or no it has any real bearing on the case," Thorndyke answered,
  "it is impossible for me to say at this stage. I told you that I had proposed
  to myself one or two hypotheses to account for and explain Jeffrey
  Blackmore's will, and I may say that the curious misplacement of this
  photograph fits more than one of them. I won't say more than that, because I
  think it would be profitable to you to work at this case independently. You
  have all the facts that I have and you shall have a copy of my notes of
  Marchmont's statement of the case. With this material you ought to be able to
  reach some conclusion. Of course neither of us may be able to make anything
  of the case&mdash;it doesn't look very hopeful at present&mdash;but whatever
  happens, we can compare notes after the event and you will be the richer by
  so much experience of actual investigation. But I will start you off with one
  hint, which is this: that neither you nor Marchmont seem to appreciate in the
  least the very extraordinary nature of the facts that he communicated to
  us."</p>

  <p>"I thought Marchmont seemed pretty much alive to the fact that it was a
  very queer will."</p>

  <p>"So he did," agreed Thorndyke. "But that is not quite what I mean. The
  whole set of circumstances, taken together and in relation to one another,
  impressed me as most remarkable; and that is why I am giving so much
  attention to what looks at first sight like such a very unpromising case.
  Copy out my notes, Jervis, and examine the facts critically. I think you will
  see what I mean. And now let us proceed."</p>

  <p>He replaced the brass plate and having reinserted the screws, hung up the
  frame, and proceeded to browse slowly round the room, stopping now and again
  to inspect the Japanese colour-prints and framed photographs of buildings and
  other objects of archaeological interest that formed the only attempts at
  wall-decoration. To one of the former he drew my attention.</p>

  <p>"These things are of some value," he remarked. "Here is one by
  Utamaro&mdash;that little circle with the mark over it is his
  signature&mdash;and you notice that the paper is becoming spotted in places
  with mildew. The fact is worth noting in more than one connection."</p>

  <p>I accordingly made a mental note and the perambulation continued.</p>

  <p>"You observe that Jeffrey used a gas-stove, instead of a coal fire, no
  doubt to economize work, but perhaps for other reasons. Presumably he cooked
  by gas, too; let us see."</p>

  <p>We wandered into the little cupboard-like kitchen and glanced round. A
  ring-burner on a shelf, a kettle, a frying-pan and a few pieces of crockery
  were its sole appointments. Apparently the porter was correct in his
  statement as to Jeffrey's habits.</p>

  <p>Returning to the sitting-room, Thorndyke resumed his inspection, pulling
  out the table drawers, peering inquisitively into cupboards and bestowing a
  passing glance on each of the comparatively few objects that the comfortless
  room contained.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen a more characterless apartment," was his final comment.
  "There is nothing that seems to suggest any kind of habitual activity on the
  part of the occupant. Let us look at the bedroom."</p>

  <p>We passed through into the chamber of tragic memories, and, when Thorndyke
  had lit the gas, we stood awhile looking about us in silence. It was a bare,
  comfortless room, dirty, neglected and squalid. The bed appeared not to have
  been remade since the catastrophe, for an indentation still marked the place
  where the corpse had lain, and even a slight powdering of ash could still be
  seen on the shabby counterpane. It looked to me a typical opium-smoker's
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Well," Thorndyke remarked at length, "there is character enough
  here&mdash;of a kind. Jeffrey Blackmore would seem to have been a man of few
  needs. One could hardly imagine a bedroom in which less attention seemed to
  have been given to the comfort of the occupant."</p>

  <p>He looked about him keenly and continued: "The syringe and the rest of the
  lethal appliances and material have been taken away, I see. Probably the
  analyst did not return them. But there are the opium-pipe and the jar and the
  ash-bowl, and I presume those are the clothes that the undertakers removed
  from the body. Shall we look them over?"</p>

  <p>He took up the clothes which lay, roughly folded, on a chair and held them
  up, garment by garment.</p>

  <p>"These are evidently the trousers," he remarked, spreading them out on the
  bed. "Here is a little white spot on the middle of the thigh which looks like
  a patch of small crystals from a drop of the solution. Just light the lamp,
  Jervis, and let us examine it with a lens."</p>

  <p>I lit the lamp, and when we had examined the spot minutely and identified
  it as a mass of minute crystals, Thorndyke asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you make of those creases? You see there is one on each leg."</p>

  <p>"It looks as if the trousers had been turned up. But if they have been
  they must have been turned up about seven inches. Poor Jeffrey couldn't have
  had much regard for appearances, for they would have been right above his
  socks. But perhaps the creases were made in undressing the body."</p>

  <p>"That is possible," said Thorndyke: "though I don't quite see how it would
  have happened. I notice that his pockets seem to have been emptied&mdash;no,
  wait; here is something in the waistcoat pocket."</p>

  <p>He drew out a shabby, pigskin card-case and a stump of lead pencil, at
  which latter he looked with what seemed to me much more interest than was
  deserved by so commonplace an object.</p>

  <p>"The cards, you observe," said he, "are printed from type, not from a
  plate. I would note that fact. And tell me what you make of that."</p>

  <p>He handed me the pencil, which I examined with concentrated attention,
  helping myself even with the lamp and my pocket lens. But even with these
  aids I failed to discover anything unusual in its appearance. Thorndyke
  watched me with a mischievous smile, and, when I had finished, inquired:</p>

  <p>"Well; what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Confound you!" I exclaimed. "It's a pencil. Any fool can see that, and
  this particular fool can't see any more. It's a wretched stump of a pencil,
  villainously cut to an abominably bad point. It is coloured dark red on the
  outside and was stamped with some name that began with
  C&mdash;O&mdash;Co-operative Stores, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear Jervis," Thorndyke protested, "don't begin by confusing
  speculation with fact. The letters which remain are C&mdash;O. Note that fact
  and find out what pencils there are which have inscriptions beginning with
  those letters. I am not going to help you, because you can easily do this for
  yourself. And it will be good discipline even if the fact turns out to mean
  nothing."</p>

  <p>At this moment he stepped back suddenly, and, looking down at the floor,
  said:</p>

  <p>"Give me the lamp, Jervis, I've trodden on something that felt like
  glass."</p>

  <p>I brought the lamp to the place where he had been standing, close by the
  bed, and we both knelt on the floor, throwing the light of the lamp on the
  bare and dusty boards. Under the bed, just within reach of the foot of a
  person standing close by, was a little patch of fragments of glass. Thorndyke
  produced a piece of paper from his pocket and delicately swept the little
  fragments on to it, remarking:</p>

  <p>"By the look of things, I am not the first person who has trodden on that
  object, whatever it is. Do you mind holding the lamp while I inspect the
  remains?"</p>

  <p>I took the lamp and held it over the paper while he examined the little
  heap of glass through his lens.</p>

  <p>"Well," I asked. "What have you found?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I am asking myself," he replied. "As far as I can judge by
  the appearance of these fragments, they appear to be portions of a small
  watch-glass. I wish there were some larger pieces."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there are," said I. "Let us look about the floor under the
  bed."</p>

  <p>We resumed our groping about the dirty floor, throwing the light of the
  lamp on one spot after another. Presently, as we moved the lamp about, its
  light fell on a small glass bead, which I instantly picked up and exhibited
  to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Is this of any interest to you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took the bead and examined it curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly," he said, "a very odd thing to find in the bedroom of an
  old bachelor like Jeffrey, especially as we know that he employed no woman to
  look after his rooms. Of course, it may be a relic of the last tenant. Let us
  see if there are any more."</p>

  <p>We renewed our search, crawling under the bed and throwing the light of
  the lamp in all directions over the floor. The result was the discovery of
  three more beads, one entire bugle and the crushed remains of another, which
  had apparently been trodden on. All of these, including the fragments of the
  bugle that had been crushed, Thorndyke placed carefully on the paper, which
  he laid on the dressing-table the more conveniently to examine our find.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said he, "that there are no more fragments of the
  watch-glass, or whatever it was. The broken pieces were evidently picked up,
  with the exception of the one that I trod on, which was an isolated fragment
  that had been overlooked. As to the beads, judging by their number and the
  position in which we found some of them&mdash;that crushed bugle, for
  instance&mdash;they must have been dropped during Jeffrey's tenancy and
  probably quite recently."</p>

  <p>"What sort of garment do you suppose they came from?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They may have been part of a beaded veil or the trimming of a dress, but
  the grouping rather suggests to me a tag of bead fringe. The colour is rather
  unusual."</p>

  <p>"I thought they looked like black beads."</p>

  <p>"So they do by this light, but I think that by daylight we shall find them
  to be a dark, reddish-brown. You can see the colour now if you look at the
  smaller fragments of the one that is crushed."</p>

  <p>He handed me his lens, and, when I had verified his statement, he produced
  from his pocket a small tin box with a closely-fitting lid in which he
  deposited the paper, having first folded it up into a small parcel.</p>

  <p>"We will put the pencil in too," said he; and, as he returned the box to
  his pocket he added: "you had better get one of these little boxes from
  Polton. If is often useful to have a safe receptacle for small and fragile
  articles."</p>

  <p>He folded up and replaced the dead man's clothes as we had found them.
  Then, observing a pair of shoes standing by the wall, he picked them up and
  looked them over thoughtfully, paying special attention to the backs of the
  soles and the fronts of the heels.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we may take it," said he, "that these are the shoes that poor
  Jeffrey wore on the night of his death. At any rate there seem to be no
  others. He seems to have been a fairly clean walker. The streets were
  shockingly dirty that day, as I remember most distinctly. Do you see any
  slippers? I haven't noticed any."</p>

  <p>He opened and peeped into a cupboard in which an overcoat surmounted by a
  felt hat hung from a peg like an attenuated suicide; he looked in all the
  corners and into the sitting-room, but no slippers were to be seen.</p>

  <p>"Our friend seems to have had surprisingly little regard for comfort,"
  Thorndyke remarked. "Think of spending the winter evenings in damp boots by a
  gas fire!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the opium-pipe compensated," said I; "or he may have gone to bed
  early."</p>

  <p>"But he did not. The night porter used to see the light in his rooms at
  one o'clock in the morning. In the sitting-room, too, you remember. But he
  seems to have been in the habit of reading in bed&mdash;or perhaps
  smoking&mdash;for here is a candlestick with the remains of a whole dynasty
  of candles in it. As there is gas in the room, he couldn't have wanted the
  candle to undress by. He used stearine candles, too; not the common paraffin
  variety. I wonder why he went to that expense."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the smell of the paraffin candle spoiled the aroma of the opium,"
  I suggested; to which Thorndyke made no reply but continued his inspection of
  the room, pulling out the drawer of the washstand&mdash;which contained a
  single, worn-out nail-brush&mdash;and even picking up and examining the dry
  and cracked cake of soap in the dish.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have had a fair amount of clothing," said Thorndyke, who was
  now going through the chest of drawers, "though, by the look of it, he didn't
  change very often, and the shirts have a rather yellow and faded appearance.
  I wonder how he managed about his washing. Why, here are a couple of pairs of
  boots in the drawer with his clothes! And here is his stock of candles. Quite
  a large box&mdash;though nearly empty now&mdash;of stearine candles, six to
  the pound."</p>

  <p>He closed the drawer and cast another inquiring look round the room.</p>

  <p>"I think we have seen all now, Jervis," he said, "unless there is anything
  more that you would like to look into?"</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "I have seen all that I wanted to see and more than I am
  able to attach any meaning to. So we may as well go."</p>

  <p>I blew out the lamp and put it in my overcoat pocket, and, when we had
  turned out the gas in both rooms, we took our departure.</p>

  <p>As we approached the lodge, we found our stout friend in the act of
  retiring in favour of the night porter. Thorndyke handed him the key of the
  chambers, and, after a few sympathetic inquiries, about his
  health&mdash;which was obviously very indifferent&mdash;said:</p>

  <p>"Let me see; you were one of the witnesses to Mr. Blackmore's will, I
  think?"</p>

  <p>"I was, sir," replied the porter.</p>

  <p>"And I believe you read the document through before you witnessed the
  signature?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did you read it aloud?"</p>

  <p>"Aloud, sir! Lor' bless you, no, sir! Why should I? The other witness read
  it, and, of course, Mr. Blackmore knew what was in it, seeing that it was in
  his own handwriting. What should I want to read it aloud for?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course you wouldn't want to. By the way, I have been wondering how
  Mr. Blackmore managed about his washing."</p>

  <p>The porter evidently regarded this question with some disfavour, for he
  replied only with an interrogative grunt. It was, in fact, rather an odd
  question.</p>

  <p>"Did you get it done for him," Thorndyke pursued.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not, sir. He got it done for himself. The laundry people
  used to deliver the basket here at the lodge, and Mr. Blackmore used to take
  it in with him when he happened to be passing."</p>

  <p>"It was not delivered at his chambers, then?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Mr. Blackmore was a very studious gentleman and he didn't like
  to be disturbed. A studious gentleman would naturally not like to be
  disturbed."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke cordially agreed with these very proper sentiments and finally
  wished the porter "good night." We passed out through the gateway into Wych
  Street, and, turning our faces eastward towards the Temple, set forth in
  silence, each thinking his own thoughts. What Thorndyke's were I cannot tell,
  though I have no doubt that he was busily engaged in piecing together all
  that he had seen and heard and considering its possible application to the
  case in hand.</p>

  <p>As to me, my mind was in a whirl of confusion. All this searching and
  examining seemed to be the mere flogging of a dead horse. The will was
  obviously a perfectly valid and regular will and there was an end of the
  matter. At least, so it seemed to me. But clearly that was not Thorndyke's
  view. His investigations were certainly not purposeless; and, as I walked by
  his side trying to conceive some purpose in his actions, I only became more
  and more mystified as I recalled them one by one, and perhaps most of all by
  the cryptic questions that I had just heard him address to the equally
  mystified porter.</p>

  <h2>VIII. &mdash; THE TRACK CHART</h2>

  <p class="first">AS Thorndyke and I arrived at the main gateway of the Temple
  and he swung round into the narrow lane, it was suddenly borne in on me that
  I had made no arrangements for the night. Events had followed one another so
  continuously and each had been so engrossing that I had lost sight of what I
  may call my domestic affairs.</p>

  <p>"We seem to be heading for your chambers, Thorndyke," I ventured to
  remark. "It is a little late to think of it, but I have not yet settled where
  I am to put up to-night."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he replied, "you are going to put up in your own bedroom
  which has been waiting in readiness for you ever since you left it. Polton
  went up and inspected it as soon as you arrived. I take it that you will
  consider my chambers yours until such time as you may join the benedictine
  majority and set up a home for yourself."</p>

  <p>"That is very handsome of you," said I. "You didn't mention that the
  billet you offered was a resident appointment."</p>

  <p>"Rooms and commons included," said Thorndyke; and when I protested that I
  should at least contribute to the costs of living he impatiently waved the
  suggestion away. We were still arguing the question when we reached our
  chambers&mdash;as I will now call them&mdash;and a diversion was occasioned
  by my taking the lamp from my pocket and placing it on the table.</p>

  <p>"Ah," my colleague remarked, "that is a little reminder. We will put it on
  the mantelpiece for Polton to collect and you shall give me a full account of
  your further adventures in the wilds of Kennington. That was a very odd
  affair. I have often wondered how it ended."</p>

  <p>He drew our two arm-chairs up to the fire, put on some more coal, placed
  the tobacco jar on the table exactly equidistant from the two chairs, and
  settled himself with the air of a man who is anticipating an agreeable
  entertainment.</p>

  <p>I filled my pipe, and, taking up the thread of the story where I had
  broken off on the last occasion, began to outline my later experiences. But
  he brought me up short.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sketchy, Jervis. To be sketchy is to be vague. Detail, my child,
  detail is the soul of induction. Let us have all the facts. We can sort them
  out afterwards."</p>

  <p>I began afresh in a vein of the extremest circumstantiality. With
  deliberate malice I loaded a prolix narrative with every triviality that a
  fairly retentive memory could rake out of the half-forgotten past. I
  cudgelled my brains for irrelevant incidents. I described with the minutest
  accuracy things that had not the faintest significance. I drew a vivid
  picture of the carriage inside and out; I painted a lifelike portrait of the
  horse, even going into particulars of the harness&mdash;which I was surprised
  to find that I had noticed. I described the furniture of the dining-room and
  the cobwebs that had hung from the ceiling; the auction-ticket on the chest
  of drawers, the rickety table and the melancholy chairs. I gave the number
  per minute of the patient's respirations and the exact quantity of coffee
  consumed on each occasion, with an exhaustive description of the cup from
  which it was taken; and I left no personal details unconsidered, from the
  patient's finger-nails to the roseate pimples on Mr. Weiss's nose.</p>

  <p>But my tactics of studied prolixity were a complete failure. The attempt
  to fatigue Thorndyke's brain with superabundant detail was like trying to
  surfeit a pelican with whitebait. He consumed it all with calm enjoyment and
  asked for more; and when, at last, I did really begin to think that I had
  bored him a little, he staggered me by reading over his notes and starting a
  brisk cross-examination to elicit fresh facts! And the most surprising thing
  of all was that when I had finished I seemed to know a great deal more about
  the case than I had ever known before.</p>

  <p>"It was a very remarkable affair," he observed, when the cross-examination
  was over&mdash;leaving me somewhat in the condition of a cider-apple that has
  just been removed from a hydraulic press&mdash;"a very suspicious affair with
  a highly unsatisfactory end. I am not sure that I entirely agree with your
  police officer. Nor do I fancy that some of my acquaintances at Scotland Yard
  would have agreed with him."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I ought to have taken any further measures?" I asked
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"No; I don't see how you could. You did all that was possible under the
  circumstances. You gave information, which is all that a private individual
  can do, especially if he is an overworked general practitioner. But still, an
  actual crime is the affair of every good citizen. I think we ought to take
  some action."</p>

  <p>"You think there really was a crime, then?"</p>

  <p>"What else can one think? What do you think about it yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I don't like to think about it at all. The recollection of that
  corpse-like figure in that gloomy bedroom has haunted me ever since I left
  the house. What do you suppose has happened?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke did not answer for a few seconds. At length he said gravely:</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Jervis, that the answer to that question can be given in one
  word."</p>

  <p>"Murder?" I asked with a slight shudder.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and we were both silent for a while.</p>

  <p>"The probability," he resumed after a pause, "that Mr. Graves is alive at
  this moment seems to me infinitesimal. There was evidently a conspiracy to
  murder him, and the deliberate, persistent manner in which that object was
  being pursued points to a very strong and definite motive. Then the tactics
  adopted point to considerable forethought and judgment. They are not the
  tactics of a fool or an ignoramus. We may criticize the closed carriage as a
  tactical mistake, calculated to arouse suspicion, but we have to weigh it
  against its alternative."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, consider the circumstances. Suppose Weiss had called you in in the
  ordinary way. You would still have detected the use of poison. But now you
  could have located your man and made inquiries about him in the
  neighbourhood. You would probably have given the police a hint and they would
  almost certainly have taken action, as they would have had the means of
  identifying the parties. The result would have been fatal to Weiss. The
  closed carriage invited suspicion, but it was a great safeguard. Weiss's
  method's were not so unsound after all. He is a cautious man, but cunning and
  very persistent. And he could be bold on occasion. The use of the blinded
  carriage was a decidedly audacious proceeding. I should put him down as a
  gambler of a very discreet, courageous and resourceful type."</p>

  <p>"Which all leads to the probability that he has pursued his scheme and
  brought it to a successful issue."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it does. But&mdash;have you got your notes of the
  compass-bearings?"</p>

  <p>"The book is in my overcoat pocket with the board. I will fetch them."</p>

  <p>I went into the office, where our coats hung, and brought back the
  notebook with the little board to which it was still attached by the rubber
  band. Thorndyke took them from me, and, opening the book, ran his eye quickly
  down one page after another. Suddenly he glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"It is a little late to begin," said he, "but these notes look rather
  alluring. I am inclined to plot them out at once. I fancy, from their
  appearance, that they will enable us to locate the house without much
  difficulty. But don't let me keep you up if you are tired. I can work them
  out by myself."</p>

  <p>"You won't do anything of the kind," I exclaimed. "I am as keen on
  plotting them as you are, and, besides, I want to see how it is done. It
  seems to be a rather useful accomplishment."</p>

  <p>"It is," said Thorndyke. "In our work, the ability to make a rough but
  reliable sketch survey is often of great value. Have you ever looked over
  these notes?"</p>

  <p>"No. I put the book away when I came in and have never looked at it
  since."</p>

  <p>"It is a quaint document. You seem to be rich in railway bridges in those
  parts, and the route was certainly none of the most direct, as you noticed at
  the time. However, we will plot it out and then we shall see exactly what it
  looks like and whither it leads us."</p>

  <p>He retired to the laboratory and presently returned with a T-square, a
  military protractor, a pair of dividers and a large drawing-board on which
  was pinned a sheet of cartridge paper.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, seating himself at the table with the board before him,
  "as to the method. You started from a known position and you arrived at a
  place the position of which is at present unknown. We shall fix the position
  of that spot by applying two factors, the distance that you travelled and the
  direction in which you were moving. The direction is given by the compass;
  and, as the horse seems to have kept up a remarkably even pace, we can take
  time as representing distance. You seem to have been travelling at about
  eight miles an hour, that is, roughly, a seventh of a mile in one minute. So
  if, on our chart, we take one inch as representing one minute, we shall be
  working with a scale of about seven inches to the mile."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't sound very exact as to distance," I objected.</p>

  <p>"It isn't. But that doesn't matter much. We have certain landmarks, such
  as these railway arches that you have noted, by which the actual distance can
  be settled after the route is plotted. You had better read out the entries,
  and, opposite each, write a number for reference, so that we need not confuse
  the chart by writing details on it. I shall start near the middle of the
  board, as neither you nor I seem to have the slightest notion what your
  general direction was."</p>

  <p>I laid the open notebook before me and read out the first entry:</p>

  <p>"'Eight fifty-eight. West by South. Start from home. Horse thirteen
  hands.'"</p>

  <p>"You turned round at once, I understand," said Thorndyke, "so we draw no
  line in that direction. The next is&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"'Eight fifty-eight minutes, thirty seconds, East by North'; and the next
  is 'Eight fifty-nine, North-east.'"</p>

  <p>"Then you travelled east by north about a fifteenth of a mile and we shall
  put down half an inch on the chart. Then you turned north-east. How long did
  you go on?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly a minute. The next entry is 'Nine. West north-west.'"</p>

  <p>"Then you travelled about the seventh of a mile in a north-easterly
  direction and we draw a line an inch long at an angle of forty-five degrees
  to the right of the north and south line. From the end of that we carry a
  line at an angle of fifty-six and a quarter degrees to the left of the north
  and south line, and so on. The method is perfectly simple, you see."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly; I quite understand it now."</p>

  <p>I went back to my chair and continued to read out the entries from the
  notebook while Thorndyke laid off the lines of direction with the protractor,
  taking out the distances with the dividers from a scale of equal parts on the
  back of the instrument. As the work proceeded, I noticed, from time to time,
  a smile of quiet amusement spread over my colleague's keen, attentive face,
  and at each new reference to a railway bridge he chuckled softly.</p>

  <p>"What, again!" he laughed, as I recorded the passage of the fifth or sixth
  bridge. "It's like a game of croquet. Go on. What is the next?"</p>

  <p>I went on reading out the notes until I came to the final one:</p>

  <p>"'Nine twenty-four. South-east. In covered way. Stop. Wooden gates
  closed.'"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke ruled off the last line, remarking: "Then your covered way is on
  the south side of a street which bears north-east. So we complete our chart.
  Just look at your route, Jervis."</p>

  <p>He held up the board with a quizzical smile and I stared in astonishment
  at the chart. The single line, which represented the route of the carriage,
  zigzagged in the most amazing manner, turning, re-turning and crossing itself
  repeatedly, evidently passing more than once down the same thoroughfares and
  terminating at a comparatively short distance from its commencement.</p>

  <p>"Why!" I exclaimed, the "rascal must have lived quite near to Stillbury's
  house!"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke measured with the dividers the distance between the starting and
  arriving points of the route and took it off from the scale.</p>

  <p>"Five-eighths of a mile, roughly," he said. "You could have walked it in
  less than ten minutes. And now let us get out the ordnance map and see if we
  can give to each of those marvellously erratic lines 'a local habitation and
  a name.'"</p>

  <p>He spread the map out on the table and placed our chart by its side.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "you started from Lower Kennington Lane?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, from this point," I replied, indicating the spot with a pencil.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "if we swing the chart round twenty degrees to
  correct the deviation of the compass, we can compare it with the ordnance
  map."</p>

  <p>He set off with the protractor an angle of twenty degrees from the north
  and south line and turned the chart round to that extent. After closely
  scrutinizing the map and the chart and comparing the one with the other, he
  said:</p>

  <p>"By mere inspection it seems fairly easy to identify the thoroughfares
  that correspond to the lines of the chart. Take the part that is near your
  destination. At nine twenty-one you passed under a bridge, going westward.
  That would seem to be Glasshouse Street. Then you turned south, apparently
  along the Albert Embankment, where you heard the tug's whistle. Then you
  heard a passenger train start on your left; that would be Vauxhall Station.
  Next you turned round due east and passed under a large railway bridge, which
  suggests the bridge that carries the Station over Upper Kennington Lane. If
  that is so, your house should be on the south side of Upper Kennington Lane,
  some three hundred yards from the bridge. But we may as well test our
  inferences by one or two measurements."</p>

  <p>"How can you do that if you don't know the exact scale of the chart?"</p>

  <p>"I will show you," said Thorndyke. "We shall establish the true scale and
  that will form part of the proof."</p>

  <p>He rapidly constructed on the upper blank part of the paper, a
  proportional diagram consisting of two intersecting lines with a single
  cross-line.</p>

  <p>"This long line," he explained, "is the distance from Stillbury's house to
  the Vauxhall railway bridge as it appears on the chart; the shorter
  cross-line is the same distance taken from the ordnance map. If our inference
  is correct and the chart is reasonably accurate, all the other distances will
  show a similar proportion. Let us try some of them. Take the distance from
  Vauxhall bridge to the Glasshouse Street bridge."</p>

  </p>
<br>

  <p>He made the two measurements carefully, and, as the point of the dividers
  came down almost precisely in the correct place on the diagram, he looked up
  at me.</p>

  <p>"Considering the roughness of the method by which the chart was made, I
  think that is pretty conclusive, though, if you look at the various arches
  that you passed under and see how nearly they appear to follow the position
  of the South-Western Railway line, you hardly need further proof. But I will
  take a few more proportional measurements for the satisfaction of proving the
  case by scientific methods before we proceed to verify our conclusions by a
  visit to the spot."</p>

  <p>He took off one or two more distances, and on comparing them with the
  proportional distances on the ordnance map, found them in every case as
  nearly correct as could be expected.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, laying down the dividers, "I think we have narrowed
  down the locality of Mr. Weiss's house to a few yards in a known street. We
  shall get further help from your note of nine twenty-three thirty, when
  records a patch of newly laid macadam extending up to the house."</p>

  <p>"That new macadam will be pretty well smoothed down by now," I
  objected.</p>

  <p>"Not so very completely," answered Thorndyke. "It is only a little over a
  month ago, and there has been very little wet weather since. It may be
  smooth, but it will be easily distinguishable from the old."</p>

  <p>"And do I understand that you propose to go and explore the
  neighbourhood?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly I do. That is to say, I intend to convert the locality of
  this house into a definite address; which, I think, will now be perfectly
  easy, unless we should have the bad luck to find more than one covered way.
  Even then, the difficulty would be trifling."</p>

  <p>"And when you have ascertained where Mr. Weiss lives? What then?"</p>

  <p>"That will depend on circumstances. I think we shall probably call at
  Scotland Yard and have a little talk with our friend Mr. Superintendent
  Miller; unless, for any reason, it seems better to look into the case
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"When is this voyage of exploration to take place?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke considered this question, and, taking out his pocket-book,
  glanced through his engagements.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that to-morrow is a fairly free day. We could
  take the morning without neglecting other business. I suggest that we start
  immediately after breakfast. How will that suit my learned friend?"</p>

  <p>"My time is yours," I replied; "and if you choose to waste it on matters
  that don't concern you, that's your affair."</p>

  <p>"Then we will consider the arrangement to stand for to-morrow morning, or
  rather, for this morning, as I see that it is past twelve."</p>

  <p>With this Thorndyke gathered up the chart and instruments and we separated
  for the night.</p>

  <h2>IX. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY</h2>

  <p class="first">HALF-PAST nine on the following morning found us spinning
  along the Albert Embankment in a hansom to the pleasant tinkle of the horse's
  bell. Thorndyke appeared to be in high spirits, though the full enjoyment of
  the matutinal pipe precluded fluent conversation. As a precaution, he had put
  my notebook in his pocket before starting, and once or twice he took it out
  and looked over its pages; but he made no reference to the object of our
  quest, and the few remarks that he uttered would have indicated that his
  thoughts were occupied with other matters.</p>

  <p>Arrived at Vauxhall Station, we alighted and forthwith made our way to the
  bridge that spans Upper Kennington Lane near its junction with Harleyford
  Road.</p>

  <p>"Here is our starting point," said Thorndyke. "From this place to the
  house is about three hundred yards&mdash;say four hundred and twenty
  paces&mdash;and at about two hundred paces we ought to reach our patch of new
  road-metal. Now, are you ready? If we keep step we shall average our
  stride."</p>

  <p>We started together at a good pace, stepping out with military regularity
  and counting aloud as we went. As we told out the hundred and ninety-fourth
  pace I observed Thorndyke nod towards the roadway a little ahead, and,
  looking at it attentively as we approached, it was easy to see by the
  regularity of surface and lighter colour, that it had recently been
  re-metalled.</p>

  <p>Having counted out the four hundred and twenty paces, we halted, and
  Thorndyke turned to me with a smile of triumph.</p>

  <p>"Not a bad estimate, Jervis," said he. "That will be your house if I am
  not much mistaken. There is no other mews or private roadway in sight."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a narrow turning some dozen yards ahead, apparently the
  entrance to a mews or yard and closed by a pair of massive wooden gates.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "there can be no doubt that this is the place; but, by
  Jove!" I added, as we drew nearer, "the nest is empty! Do you see?"</p>

  <p>I pointed to a bill that was stuck on the gate, bearing, as I could see at
  this distance, the inscription "To Let."</p>

  <p>"Here is a new and startling, if not altogether unexpected, development,"
  said Thorndyke, as we stood gazing at the bill; which set forth that "these
  premises, including stabling and workshops," were "to be let on lease or
  otherwise," and referred inquiries to Messrs. Ryebody Brothers, house-agents
  and valuers, Upper Kennington Lane. "The question is, should we make a few
  inquiries of the agent, or should we get the keys and have a look at the
  inside of the house? I am inclined to do both, and the latter first, if
  Messrs. Ryebody Brothers will trust us with the keys."</p>

  <p>We proceeded up the lane to the address given, and, entering the office,
  Thorndyke made his request&mdash;somewhat to the surprise of the clerk; for
  Thorndyke was not quite the kind of person whom one naturally associates with
  stabling and workshops. However, there was no difficulty, but as the clerk
  sorted out the keys from a bunch hanging from a hook, he remarked:</p>

  <p>"I expect you will find the place in a rather dirty and neglected
  condition. The house has not been cleaned yet; it is just as it was left when
  the brokers took away the furniture."</p>

  <p>"Was the last tenant sold up, then?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. He had to leave rather unexpectedly to take up some business in
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"I hope he paid his rent," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Trust us for that. But I should say that Mr. Weiss&mdash;that
  was his name&mdash;was a man of some means. He seemed to have plenty of
  money, though he always paid in notes. I don't fancy he had a banking account
  in this country. He hadn't been here more than about six or seven months and
  I imagine he didn't know many people in England, as he paid us a cash deposit
  in lieu of references when he first came."</p>

  <p>"I think you said his name was Weiss. It wouldn't be H. Weiss by any
  chance?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it was. But I can soon tell you." He opened a drawer and
  consulted what looked like a book of receipt forms. "Yes; H Weiss. Do you
  know him, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I knew a Mr. H. Weiss some years ago. He came from Bremen, I
  remember."</p>

  <p>"This Mr. Weiss has gone back to Hamburg," the clerk observed.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Thorndyke, "then it would seem not to be the same. My
  acquaintance was a fair man with a beard and a decidedly red nose and he wore
  spectacles."</p>

  <p>"That's the man. You've described him exactly," said the clerk, who was
  apparently rather easily satisfied in the matter of description.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," said Thorndyke; "what a small world it is. Do you happen to
  have a note of his address in Hamburg?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't," the clerk replied. "You see we've done with him, having got
  the rent, though the house is not actually surrendered yet. Mr Weiss's
  housekeeper still has the front-door key. She doesn't start for Hamburg for a
  week or so, and meanwhile she keeps the key so that she can call every day
  and see if there are any letters."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Thorndyke. "I wonder if he still has the same
  housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"This lady is a German," replied the clerk, "with a regular jaw-twisting
  name. Sounded like Shallybang."</p>

  <p>"Schallibaum. That is the lady. A fair woman with hardly any eyebrows and
  a pronounced cast in the left eye."</p>

  <p>"Now that's very curious, sir," said the clerk. "It's the same name, and
  this is a fair woman with remarkably thin eyebrows, I remember, now that you
  mention it But it can't be the same person. I have only seen her a few times
  and then only just for a minute or so; but I'm quite certain she had no cast
  in her eye. So, you see, sir, she can't be the same person. You can dye your
  hair or you can wear a wig or you can paint your face; but a squint is a
  squint. There's no faking a swivel eye."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed softly. "I suppose not; unless, perhaps, some one might
  invent an adjustable glass eye. Are these the keys?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. The large one belongs to the wicket in the front gate. The
  other is the latch-key belonging to the side door. Mrs. Shallybang has the
  key of the front door."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke. He took the keys, to which a wooden label was
  attached, and we made our way back towards the house of mystery, discussing
  the clerk's statements as we went.</p>

  <p>"A very communicable young gentleman, that," Thorndyke remarked. "He
  seemed quite pleased to relieve the monotony of office work with a little
  conversation. And I am sure I was very delighted to indulge him."</p>

  <p>"He hadn't much to tell, all the same," said I.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me in surprise. "I don't know what you would have,
  Jervis, unless you expect casual strangers to present you with a ready-made
  body of evidence, fully classified, with all the inferences and implications
  stated. It seemed to me that he was a highly instructive young man."</p>

  <p>"What did you learn from him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, Jervis," he protested; "is that a fair question, under our
  present arrangement? However, I will mention a few points. We learn that
  about six or seven months ago, Mr. H. Weiss dropped from the clouds into
  Kennington Lane and that he has now ascended from Kennington Lane into the
  clouds. That is a useful piece of information. Then we learn that Mrs.
  Schallibaum has remained in England; which might be of little importance if
  it were not for a very interesting corollary that it suggests."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"I must leave you to consider the facts at your leisure; but you will have
  noticed the ostensible reason for her remaining behind. She is engaged in
  puttying up the one gaping joint in their armour. One of them has been
  indiscreet enough to give this address to some correspondent&mdash;probably a
  foreign correspondent. Now, as they obviously wish to leave no tracks, they
  cannot give their new address to the Post Office to have their letters
  forwarded, and, on the other hand, a letter left in the box might establish
  such a connection as would enable them to be traced. Moreover, the letter
  might be of a kind that they would not wish to fall into the wrong hands.
  They would not have given this address excepting under some peculiar
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"No, I should think not, if they took this house for the express purpose
  of committing a crime in it."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And then there is one other fact that you may have gathered from
  our young friend's remarks."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"That a controllable squint is a very valuable asset to a person who
  wishes to avoid identification."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did note that. The fellow seemed to think that it was absolutely
  conclusive."</p>

  <p>"And so would most people; especially in the case of a squint of that
  kind. We can all squint towards our noses, but no normal person can turn his
  eyes away from one another. My impression is that the presence or absence, as
  the case might be, of a divergent squint would be accepted as absolute
  disproof of identity. But here we are."</p>

  <p>He inserted the key into the wicket of the large gate, and, when we had
  stepped through into the covered way, he locked it from the inside.</p>

  <p>"Why have you locked us in?" I asked, seeing that the wicket had a
  latch.</p>

  <p>"Because," he replied, "if we now hear any one on the premises we shall
  know who it is. Only one person besides ourselves has a key."</p>

  <p>His reply startled me somewhat. I stopped and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"That is a quaint situation, Thorndyke. I hadn't thought of it. Why she
  may actually come to the house while we are here; in fact, she may be in the
  house at this moment."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said he. "We don't particularly want Mr. Weiss to be put on
  his guard, for I take it, he is a pretty wide-awake gentleman under any
  circumstances. If she does come, we had better keep out of sight. I think we
  will look over the house first. That is of the most interest to us. If the
  lady does happen to come while we are here, she may stay to show us over the
  place and keep an eye on us. So we will leave the stables to the last."</p>

  <p>We walked down the entry to the side door at which I had been admitted by
  Mrs. Schallibaum on the occasion of my previous visits. Thorndyke inserted
  the latch-key, and, as soon as we were inside, shut the door and walked
  quickly through into the hall, whither I followed him. He made straight for
  the front door, where, having slipped up the catch of the lock, he began very
  attentively to examine the letter-box. It was a somewhat massive wooden box,
  fitted with a lock of good quality and furnished with a wire grille through
  which one could inspect the interior.</p>

  <p>"We are in luck, Jervis," Thorndyke remarked. "Our visit has been most
  happily timed. There is a letter in the box."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "we can't get it out; and if we could, it would be hardly
  justifiable."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he replied, "that I am prepared to assent off-hand to
  either of those propositions; but I would rather not tamper with another
  person's letter, even if that person should happen to be a murderer. Perhaps
  we can get the information we want from the outside of the envelope."</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket a little electric lamp fitted with a
  bull's-eye, and, pressing the button, threw a beam of light in through the
  grille. The letter was lying on the bottom of the box face upwards, so that
  the address could easily be read.</p>

  <p>"Herrn Dr. H. Weiss," Thorndyke read aloud. "German stamp, postmark
  apparently Darmstadt. You notice that the 'Herrn Dr.' is printed and the rest
  written. What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know. Do you think he is really a medical man?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we had better finish our investigation, in case we are disturbed,
  and discuss the bearings of the facts afterwards. The name of the sender may
  be on the flap of the envelope. If it is not, I shall pick the lock and take
  out the letter. Have you got a probe about you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; by force of habit I am still carrying my pocket case."</p>

  <p>I took the little case from my pocket and extracting from it a jointed
  probe of thickish silver wire, screwed the two halves together and handed the
  completed instrument to Thorndyke; who passed the slender rod through the
  grille and adroitly turned the letter over.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed with deep satisfaction, as the light fell on the
  reverse of the envelope, "we are saved from the necessity of theft&mdash;or
  rather, unauthorized borrowing&mdash;'Johann Schnitzler, Darmstadt.' That is
  all that we actually want. The German police can do the rest if
  necessary."</p>

  <p>He handed me back my probe, pocketed his lamp, released the catch of the
  lock on the door, and turned away along the dark, musty-smelling hall.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know the name of Johann Schnitzler?" he asked.</p>

  <p>I replied that I had no recollection of ever having heard the name
  before.</p>

  <p>"Neither have I," said he; "but I think we may form a pretty shrewd guess
  as to his avocation. As you saw, the words 'Herrn Dr.' were printed on the
  envelope, leaving the rest of the address to be written by hand. The plain
  inference is that he is a person who habitually addresses letters to medical
  men, and as the style of the envelope and the lettering&mdash;which is
  printed, not embossed&mdash;is commercial, we may assume that he is engaged
  in some sort of trade. Now, what is a likely trade?"</p>

  <p>"He might be an instrument maker or a drug manufacturer; more probably the
  latter, as there is an extensive drug and chemical industry in Germany, and
  as Mr. Weiss seemed to have more use for drugs than instruments."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you are right; but we will look him up when we get home. And
  now we had better take a glance at the bedroom; that is, if you can remember
  which room it was."</p>

  <p>"It was on the first floor," said I, "and the door by which I entered was
  just at the head of the stairs."</p>

  <p>We ascended the two flights, and, as we reached the landing, I halted.</p>

  <p>"This was the door," I said, and was about to turn the handle when
  Thorndyke caught me by the arm.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Jervis," said he. "What do you make of this?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to a spot near the bottom of the door where, on close
  inspection, four good-sized screw-holes were distinguishable. They had been
  neatly stopped with putty and covered with knotting, and were so nearly the
  colour of the grained and varnished woodwork as to be hardly visible.</p>

  <p>"Evidently," I answered, "there has been a bolt there, though it seems a
  queer place to fix one."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke. "If you look up you will see that there
  was another at the top of the door, and, as the lock is in the middle, they
  must have been highly effective. But there are one or two other points that
  strike one. First, you will notice that the bolts have been fixed on quite
  recently, for the paint that they covered is of the same grimy tint as that
  on the rest of the door. Next, they have been taken off, which, seeing that
  they could hardly have been worth the trouble of removal, seems to suggest
  that the person who fixed them considered that their presence might appear
  remarkable, while the screw-holes, which have been so skilfully and carefully
  stopped, would be less conspicuous.</p>

  <p>"Then, they are on the outside of the door&mdash;an unusual situation for
  bedroom bolts&mdash;and were of considerable size. They were long and
  thick."</p>

  <p>"I can see, by the position of the screw-holes, that they were long; but
  how do you arrive at their thickness?"</p>

  <p>"By the size of the counter-holes in the jamb of the door. These holes
  have been very carefully filled with wooden plugs covered with knotting; but
  you can make out their diameter, which is that of the bolts, and which is
  decidedly out of proportion for an ordinary bedroom door. Let me show you a
  light."</p>

  <p>He flashed his lamp into the dark corner, and I was able to see distinctly
  the portentously large holes into which the bolts had fitted, and also to
  note the remarkable neatness with which they had been plugged.</p>

  <p>"There was a second door, I remember," said I. "Let us see if that was
  guarded in a similar manner."</p>

  <p>We strode through the empty room, awakening dismal echoes as we trod the
  bare boards, and flung open the other door. At top and bottom, similar groups
  of screw-holes showed that this also had been made secure, and that these
  bolts had been of the same very substantial character as the others.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke turned away from the door with a slight frown.</p>

  <p>"If we had any doubts," said he, "as to what has been going on in this
  house, these traces of massive fastenings would be almost enough to settle
  them."</p>

  <p>"They might have been there before Weiss came," I suggested. "He only came
  about seven months ago and there is no date on the screw-holes."</p>

  <p>"That is quite true. But when, with their recent fixture, you couple the
  facts that they have been removed, that very careful measures have been taken
  to obliterate the traces of their presence, and that they would have been
  indispensable for the commission of the crime that we are almost certain was
  being committed here, it looks like an excess of caution to seek other
  explanations."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "if the man, Graves, was really imprisoned, could not
  he have smashed the window and called for help?"</p>

  <p>"The window looks out on the yard, as you see; but I expect it was secured
  too."</p>

  <p>He drew the massive, old-fashioned shutters out of their recess and closed
  them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, here we are." He pointed to four groups of screw-holes at the
  corners of the shutters, and, once more producing his lamp, narrowly examined
  the insides of the recesses into which the shutters folded.</p>

  <p>"The nature of the fastening is quite evident," said he. "An iron bar
  passed right across at the top and bottom and was secured by a staple and
  padlock. You can see the mark the bar made in the recess when the shutters
  were folded. When these bars were fixed and padlocked and the bolts were
  shot, this room was as secure, for a prisoner unprovided with tools, as a
  cell in Newgate."</p>

  <p>We looked at one another for awhile without speaking; and I fancy that if
  Mr. H. Weiss could have seen our faces he might have thought it desirable to
  seek some retreat even more remote than Hamburg.</p>

  <p>"It was a diabolical affair, Jervis," Thorndyke said at length, in an
  ominously quiet and even gentle tone. "A sordid, callous, cold-blooded crime
  of a type that is to me utterly unforgivable and incapable of extenuation. Of
  course, it may have failed. Mr. Graves may even now be alive. I shall make it
  my very especial business to ascertain whether he is or not. And if he is
  not, I shall take it to myself as a sacred duty to lay my hand on the man who
  has compassed his death."</p>

  <p>I looked at Thorndyke with something akin to awe. In the quiet unemotional
  tone of his voice, in his unruffled manner and the stony calm of his face,
  there was something much more impressive, more fateful, than there could have
  been in the fiercest threats or the most passionate denunciations. I felt
  that in those softly spoken words he had pronounced the doom of the fugitive
  villain.</p>

  <p>He turned away from the window and glanced round the empty room. It seemed
  that our discovery of the fastenings had exhausted the information that it
  had to offer.</p>

  <p>"It is a thousand pities," I remarked, "that we were unable to look round
  before they moved out the furniture. We might have found some clue to the
  scoundrel's identity."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke; "there isn't much information to be gathered
  here, I am afraid. I see they have swept up the small litter from the floor
  and poked it under the grate. We will turn that over, as there seems to be
  nothing else, and then look at the other rooms."</p>

  <p>He raked out the little heap of rubbish with his stick and spread it out
  on the hearth. It certainly looked unpromising enough, being just such a
  rubbish heap as may be swept up in any untidy room during a move. But
  Thorndyke went through it systematically, examining each item attentively,
  even to the local tradesmen's bills and empty paper bags, before laying them
  aside. Another rake of his stick scattered the bulky masses of crumpled paper
  and brought into view an object which he picked up with some eagerness. It
  was a portion of a pair of spectacles, which had apparently been trodden on,
  for the side-bar was twisted and bent and the glass was shattered into
  fragments.</p>

  <p>"This ought to give us a hint," said he. "It will probably have belonged
  either to Weiss or Graves, as Mrs. Schallibaum apparently did not wear
  glasses. Let us see if we can find the remainder."</p>

  <p>We both groped carefully with our sticks amongst the rubbish, spreading it
  out on the hearth and removing the numerous pieces of crumpled paper. Our
  search was rewarded by the discovery of the second eye-picce of the
  spectacles, of which the glass was badly cracked but less shattered than the
  other. I also picked up two tiny sticks at which Thorndyke looked with deep
  interest before laying them on the mantelshelf.</p>

  <p>"We will consider them presently," said he. "Let us finish with the
  spectacles first. You see that the left eye-glass is a concave cylindrical
  lens of some sort. We can make out that much from the fragments that remain,
  and we can measure the curvature when we get them home, although that will be
  easier if we can collect some more fragments and stick them together. The
  right eye is plain glass; that is quite evident. Then these will have
  belonged to your patient, Jervis. You said that the tremulous iris was in the
  right eye, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "These will be his spectacles, without doubt."</p>

  <p>"They are peculiar frames," he continued. "If they were made in this
  country, we might be able to discover the maker. But we must collect as many
  fragments of glass as we can."</p>

  <p>Once more we searched amongst the rubbish and succeeded, eventually, in
  recovering some seven or eight small fragments of the broken
  spectacle-glasses, which Thorndyke laid on the mantelshelf beside the little
  sticks.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Thorndyke," I said, taking up the latter to examine them
  afresh, "what are these things? Can you make anything of them?"</p>

  <p>He looked at them thoughtfully for a few moments and then replied:</p>

  <p>"I don't think I will tell you what they are. You should find that out for
  yourself, and it will be well worth your while to do so. They are rather
  suggestive objects under the circumstances. But notice their peculiarities
  carefully. Both are portions of some smooth, stout reed. There is a long,
  thin stick&mdash;about six inches long&mdash;and a thicker piece only three
  inches in length. The longer piece has a little scrap of red paper stuck on
  at the end; apparently a portion of a label of some kind with an ornamental
  border. The other end of the stick has been broken off. The shorter, stouter
  stick has had its central cavity artificially enlarged so that it fits over
  the other to form a cap or sheath. Make a careful note of those facts and try
  to think what they probably mean; what would be the most likely use for an
  object of this kind. When you have ascertained that, you will have learned
  something new about this case. And now, to resume our investigations. Here is
  a very suggestive thing." He picked up a small, wide-mouthed bottle and,
  holding it up for my inspection, continued: "Observe the fly sticking to the
  inside, and the name on the label, 'Fox, Russell Street, Covent Garden.'"</p>

  <p>"I don't know Mr. Fox."</p>

  <p>"Then I will inform you that he is a dealer in the materials for
  'make-up,' theatrical or otherwise, and will leave you to consider the
  bearing of this bottle on our present investigation. There doesn't seem to be
  anything else of interest in this El Dorado excepting that screw, which you
  notice is about the size of those with which the bolts were fastened on the
  doors. I don't think it is worth while to unstop any of the holes to try it;
  we should learn nothing fresh."</p>

  <p>He rose, and, having kicked the discarded rubbish back under the grate,
  gathered up his gleanings from the mantelpiece, carefully bestowing the
  spectacles and the fragments of glass in the tin box that he appeared always
  to carry in his pocket, and wrapping the larger objects in his
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"A poor collection," was his comment, as he returned the box and
  handkerchief to his pocket, "and yet not so poor as I had feared. Perhaps, if
  we question them closely enough, these unconsidered trifles may be made to
  tell us something worth learning after all. Shall we go into the other
  room?"</p>

  <p>We passed out on to the landing and into the front room, where, guided by
  experience, we made straight for the fire-place. But the little heap of
  rubbish there contained nothing that even Thorndyke's inquisitive eye could
  view with interest. We wandered disconsolately round the room, peering into
  the empty cupboards and scanning the floor and the corners by the skirting,
  without discovering a single object or relic of the late occupants. In the
  course of my perambulations I halted by the window and was looking down into
  the street when Thorndyke called to me sharply:</p>

  <p>"Come away from the window, Jervis! Have you forgotten that Mrs.
  Schallibaum may be in the neighbourhood at this moment?"</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact I had entirely forgotten the matter, nor did it now
  strike me as anything but the remotest of possibilities. I replied to that
  effect.</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you," Thorndyke rejoined. "We have heard that she
  comes here to look for letters. Probably she comes every day, or even
  oftener. There is a good deal at stake, remember, and they cannot feel quite
  as secure as they would wish. Weiss must have seen what view you took of the
  case and must have had some uneasy moments thinking of what you might do. In
  fact, we may take it that the fear of you drove them out of the
  neighbourhood, and that they are mighty anxious to get that letter and cut
  the last link that binds them to this house."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is so," I agreed; "and if the lady should happen to pass
  this way and should see me at the window and recognize me, she would
  certainly smell a rat."</p>

  <p>"A rat!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "She would smell a whole pack of foxes, and
  Mr. H. Weiss would be more on his guard than ever. Let us have a look at the
  other rooms; there is nothing here."</p>

  <p>We went up to the next floor and found traces of recent occupation in one
  room only. The garrets had evidently been unused, and the kitchen and
  ground-floor rooms offered nothing that appeared to Thorndyke worth noting.
  Then we went out by the side door and down the covered way into the yard at
  the back. The workshops were fastened with rusty padlocks that looked as if
  they had not been disturbed for months. The stables were empty and had been
  tentatively cleaned out, the coach-house was vacant, and presented no traces
  of recent use excepting a half-bald spoke-brush. We returned up the covered
  way and I was about to close the side door, which Thorndyke had left ajar,
  when he stopped me.</p>

  <p>"We'll have another look at the hall before we go," said he; and, walking
  softly before me, he made his way to the front door, where, producing his
  lamp, he threw a beam of light into the letter-box.</p>

  <p>"Any more letters?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Any more!" he repeated. "Look for yourself."</p>

  <p>I stooped and peered through the grille into the lighted interior; and
  then I uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>The box was empty.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded me with a grim smile. "We have been caught on the hop,
  Jervis, I suspect," said he.</p>

  <p>"It is queer," I replied. "I didn't hear any sound of the opening or
  closing of the door; did you?"</p>

  <p>"No; I didn't hear any sound; which makes me suspect that she did. She
  would have heard our voices and she is probably keeping a sharp look-out at
  this very moment. I wonder if she saw you at the window. But whether she did
  or not, we must go very warily. Neither of us must return to the Temple
  direct, and we had better separate when we have returned the keys and I will
  watch you out of sight and see if anyone is following you. What are you going
  to do?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't want me, I shall run over to Kensington and drop in to lunch
  at the Hornbys'. I said I would call as soon as I had an hour or so
  free."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Do so; and keep a look-out in case you are followed. I have to
  go down to Guildford this afternoon. Under the circumstances, I shall not go
  back home, but send Polton a telegram and take a train at Vauxhall and change
  at some small station where I can watch the platform. Be as careful as you
  can. Remember that what you have to avoid is being followed to any place
  where you are known, and, above all, revealing your connection with number
  Five A, King's Bench Walk."</p>

  <p>Having thus considered our immediate movements, we emerged together from
  the wicket, and locking it behind us, walked quickly to the house-agents',
  where an opportune office-boy received the keys without remark. As we came
  out of the office, I halted irresolutely and we both looked up and down the
  lane.</p>

  <p>"There is no suspicious looking person in sight at present," Thorndyke
  said, and then asked: "Which way do you think of going?"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," I replied, "that my best plan would be to take a cab or
  an omnibus so as to get out of the neighbourhood as quickly as possible. If I
  go through Ravensden Street into Kennington Park Road, I can pick up an
  omnibus that will take me to the Mansion House, where I can change for
  Kensington. I shall go on the top so that I can keep a look-out for any other
  omnibus or cab that may be following."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that seems a good plan. I will walk with you and
  see that you get a fair start."</p>

  <p>We walked briskly along the lane and through Ravensden Street to the
  Kennington Park Road. An omnibus was approaching from the south at a steady
  jog-trot and we halted at the corner to wait for it. Several people passed us
  in different directions, but none seemed to take any particular notice of us,
  though we observed them rather narrowly, especially the women. Then the
  omnibus crawled up. I sprang on the foot-board and ascended to the roof,
  where I seated myself and surveyed the prospect to the rear. No one else got
  on the omnibus&mdash;which had not stopped&mdash;and no cab or other
  passenger vehicle was in sight. I continued to watch Thorndyke as he stood
  sentinel at the corner, and noted that no one appeared to be making any
  effort to overtake the omnibus. Presently my colleague waved his hand to me
  and turned back towards Vauxhall, and I, having satisfied myself once more
  that no pursuing cab or hurrying foot-passenger was in sight, decided that
  our precautions had been unnecessary and settled myself in a rather more
  comfortable position.</p>
  <hr>

        id="CH10"></a>

  <h2>X. &mdash; THE HUNTER HUNTED</h2>

  <p class="first">THE omnibus of those days was a leisurely vehicle. Its
  ordinary pace was a rather sluggish trot, and in a thickly populated
  thoroughfare its speed was further reduced by frequent stoppages. Bearing
  these facts in mind, I gave an occasional backward glance as we jogged
  northward, though my attention soon began to wander from the rather remote
  possibility of pursuit to the incidents of our late exploration.</p>

  <p>It had not been difficult to see that Thorndyke was very well pleased with
  the results of our search, but excepting the letter&mdash;which undoubtedly
  opened up a channel for further inquiry and possible identification&mdash;I
  could not perceive that any of the traces that we had found justified his
  satisfaction. There were the spectacles, for instance. They were almost
  certainly the pair worn by Mr. Graves. But what then? It was exceedingly
  improbable that we should be able to discover the maker of them, and if we
  were, it was still more improbable that he would be able to give us any
  information that would help us. Spectacle-makers are not usually on
  confidential terms with their customers.</p>

  <p>As to the other objects, I could make nothing of them. The little sticks
  of reed evidently had some use that was known to Thorndyke and furnished, by
  inference, some kind of information about Weiss, Graves, or Mrs. Schallibaum.
  But I had never seen anything like them before and they conveyed nothing
  whatever to me. Then the bottle that had seemed so significant to Thorndyke
  was to me quite uninforming. It did, indeed, suggest that some member of the
  household might be connected with the stage, but it gave no hint as to which
  one. Certainly that person was not Mr. Weiss, whose appearance was as remote
  from that of an actor as could well be imagined. At any rate, the bottle and
  its label gave me no more useful hint than it might be worth while to call on
  Mr. Fox and make inquiries; and something told me very emphatically that this
  was not what it had conveyed to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>These reflections occupied me until the omnibus, having rumbled over
  London Bridge and up King William Street, joined the converging streams of
  traffic at the Mansion House. Here I got down and changed to an omnibus bound
  for Kensington; on which I travelled westward pleasantly enough, looking down
  into the teeming streets and whiling away the time by meditating upon the
  very agreeable afternoon that I promised myself, and considering how far my
  new arrangement with Thorndyke would justify me in entering into certain
  domestic engagements of a highly interesting kind.</p>

  <p>What might have happened under other circumstances it is impossible to
  tell and useless to speculate; the fact is that my journey ended in a
  disappointment. I arrived, all agog, at the familiar house in Endsley Gardens
  only to be told by a sympathetic housemaid that the family was out; that Mrs.
  Hornby had gone into the country and would not be home until night,
  and&mdash;which mattered a good deal more to me&mdash;that her niece, Miss
  Juliet Gibson, had accompanied her.</p>

  <p>Now a man who drops into lunch without announcing his intention or
  previously ascertaining those of his friends has no right to quarrel with
  fate if he finds an empty house. Thus philosophically I reflected as I turned
  away from the house in profound discontent, demanding of the universe in
  general why Mrs. Hornby need have perversely chosen my first free day to go
  gadding into the country, and above all, why she must needs spirit away the
  fair Juliet. This was the crowning misfortune (for I could have endured the
  absence of the elder lady with commendable fortitude), and since I could not
  immediately return to the Temple it left me a mere waif and stray for the
  time being.</p>

  <p>Instinct&mdash;of the kind that manifests itself especially about one
  o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;impelled me in the direction of Brompton Road,
  and finally landed me at a table in a large restaurant apparently adjusted to
  the needs of ladies who had come from a distance to engage in the feminine
  sport of shopping. Here, while waiting for my lunch, I sat idly scanning the
  morning paper and wondering what I should do with the rest of the day; and
  presently it chanced that my eye caught the announcement of a matine at the
  theatre in Sloane Square. It was quite a long time since I had been at a
  theatre, and, as the play&mdash;light comedy&mdash;seemed likely to satisfy
  my not very critical taste, I decided to devote the afternoon to reviving my
  acquaintance with the drama. Accordingly as soon as my lunch was finished, I
  walked down the Brompton Road, stepped on to an omnibus, and was duly
  deposited at the door of the theatre. A couple of minutes later I found
  myself occupying an excellent seat in the second row of the pit, oblivious
  alike of my recent disappointment and of Thorndyke's words of warning.</p>

  <p>I am not an enthusiastic play-goer. To dramatic performances I am disposed
  to assign nothing further than the modest function of furnishing
  entertainment. I do not go to a theatre to be instructed or to have my moral
  outlook elevated. But, by way of compensation, I am not difficult to please.
  To a simple play, adjusted to my primitive taste, I can bring a certain
  bucolic appreciation that enables me to extract from the performance the
  maximum of enjoyment; and when, on this occasion, the final curtain fell and
  the audience rose, I rescued my hat from its insecure resting-place and
  turned to go with the feeling that I had spent a highly agreeable
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>Emerging from the theatre, borne on the outgoing stream, I presently found
  myself opposite the door of a tea-shop. Instinct&mdash;the five o'clock
  instinct this time&mdash;guided me in; for we are creatures of habit,
  especially of the tea habit. The unoccupied table to which I drifted was in a
  shady corner not very far from the pay-desk; and here I had been seated less
  than a minute when a lady passed me on her way to the farther table. The
  glimpse that I caught of her as she approached&mdash;it was but a glimpse,
  since she passed behind me&mdash;showed that she was dressed in black, that
  she wore a beaded veil and hat, and in addition to the glass of milk and the
  bun that she carried, she was encumbered by an umbrella and a small basket,
  apparently containing some kind of needlework. I must confess that I gave her
  very little attention at the time, being occupied in anxious speculation as
  to how long it would be before the fact of my presence would impinge on the
  consciousness of the waitress.</p>

  <p>The exact time by the clock on the wall was three minutes and a quarter,
  at the expiration of which an anaemic young woman sauntered up to the table
  and bestowed on me a glance of sullen interrogation, as if mutely demanding
  what the devil I wanted. I humbly requested that I might be provided with a
  pot of tea; whereupon she turned on her heel (which was a good deal worn down
  on the offside) and reported my conduct to a lady behind a marble-topped
  counter.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the counter lady took a lenient view of the case, for in
  less than four minutes the waitress returned and gloomily deposited on the
  table before me a tea-pot, a milk-jug, a cup and saucer, a jug of hot water,
  and a small pool of milk. Then she once more departed in dudgeon.</p>

  <p>I had just given the tea in the pot a preliminary stir and was about to
  pour out the first cup when I felt some one bump lightly against my chair and
  heard something rattle on the floor. I turned quickly and perceived the lady,
  whom I had seen enter, stooping just behind my chair. It seemed that having
  finished her frugal meal she was on her way out when she had dropped the
  little basket that I had noticed hanging from her wrist; which basket had
  promptly disgorged its entire contents on the floor.</p>

  <p>Now every one must have noticed the demon of agility that seems to enter
  into an inanimate object when it is dropped, and the apparently intelligent
  malice with which it discovers, and rolls into, the most inaccessible places.
  Here was a case in point. This particular basket had contained materials for
  Oriental bead-work; and no sooner had it reached the floor than each item of
  its contents appeared to become possessed of a separate and particular devil
  impelling it to travel at headlong speed to some remote and unapproachable
  corner as distant as possible from its fellows.</p>

  <p>As the only man&mdash;and almost the only person&mdash;near, the duty of
  salvage-agent manifestly devolved upon me; and down I went, accordingly, on
  my hands and knees, regardless of a nearly new pair of trousers, to grope
  under tables, chairs and settles in reach of the scattered treasure. A ball
  of the thick thread or twine I recovered from a dark and dirty corner after a
  brief interview with the sharp corner of a settle, and a multitude of the
  large beads with which this infernal industry is carried on I gathered from
  all parts of the compass, coming forth at length (quadrupedally) with a
  double handful of the treasure-trove and a very lively appreciation of the
  resistant qualities of a cast-iron table-stand when applied to the human
  cranium.</p>

  <p>The owner of the lost and found property was greatly distressed by the
  accident and the trouble it had caused me; in fact she was quite needlessly
  agitated about it. The hand which held the basket into which I poured the
  rescued trash trembled visibly, and the brief glance that I bestowed on her
  as she murmured her thanks and apologies&mdash;with a very slight foreign
  accent&mdash;showed me that she was excessively pale. That much I could see
  plainly in spite of the rather dim light in this part of the shop and the
  beaded veil that covered her face; and I could also see that she was a rather
  remarkable looking woman, with a great mass of harsh, black hair and very
  broad black eyebrows that nearly met above her nose and contrasted strikingly
  with the dead white of her skin. But, of course, I did not look at her
  intently. Having returned her property and received her acknowledgments, I
  resumed my seat and left her to go on her way.</p>

  <p>I had once more grasped the handle of the tea-pot when I made a rather
  curious discovery. At the bottom of the tea-cup lay a single lump of sugar.
  To the majority of persons it would have meant nothing. They would have
  assumed that they had dropped it in and forgotten it and would have proceeded
  to pour out the tea. But it happened that, at this time, I did not take sugar
  in my tea; whence it followed that the lump had not been put in by me.
  Assuming, therefore, that it had been carelessly dropped in by the waitress,
  I turned it out on the table, filled the cup, added the milk, and took a
  tentative draught to test the temperature.</p>

  <p>The cup was yet at my lips when I chanced to look into the mirror that
  faced my table. Of course it reflected the part of the shop that was behind
  me, including the cashier's desk; at which the owner of the basket now stood
  paying for her refreshment. Between her and me was a gas chandelier which
  cast its light on my back but full on her face; and her veil notwithstanding,
  I could see that she was looking at me steadily; was, in fact, watching me
  intently and with a very curious expression&mdash;an expression of expectancy
  mingled with alarm. But this was not all. As I returned her intent
  look&mdash;which I could do unobserved, since my face, reflected in the
  mirror, was in deep shadow&mdash;I suddenly perceived that that steady gaze
  engaged her right eye only; the other eye was looking sharply towards her
  left shoulder. In short, she had a divergent squint of the left eye.</p>

  <p>I put down my cup with a thrill of amazement and a sudden surging up of
  suspicion and alarm. An instant's reflection reminded me that when she had
  spoken to me a few moments before, both her eyes had looked into mine without
  the slightest trace of a squint. My thoughts flew back to the lump of sugar,
  to the unguarded milk-jug and the draught of tea that I had already
  swallowed; and, hardly knowing what I intended, I started to my feet and
  turned to confront her. But as I rose, she snatched up her change and darted
  from the shop. Through the glass door, I saw her spring on to the foot-board
  of a passing hansom and give the driver some direction. I saw the man whip up
  his horse, and, by the time I reached the door, the cab was moving off
  swiftly towards Sloane Street.</p>

  <p>I stood irresolute. I had not paid and could not run out of the shop
  without making a fuss, and my hat and stick were still on the rail opposite
  my seat. The woman ought to be followed, but I had no fancy for the task. If
  the tea that I had swallowed was innocuous, no harm was done and I was rid of
  my pursuer. So far as I was concerned, the incident was closed. I went back
  to my seat, and picking up the lump of sugar which still lay on the table
  where I had dropped it, put it carefully in my pocket. But my appetite for
  tea was satisfied for the present. Moreover it was hardly advisable to stay
  in the shop lest some fresh spy should come to see how I fared. Accordingly I
  obtained my check, handed it in at the cashier's desk and took my
  departure.</p>

  <p>All this time, it will be observed, I had been taking it for granted that
  the lady in black had followed me from Kensington to this shop; that, in
  fact, she was none other than Mrs. Schallibaum. And, indeed, the
  circumstances had rendered the conclusion inevitable. In the very instant
  when I had perceived the displacement of the left eye, complete recognition
  had come upon me. When I had stood facing the woman, the brief glance at her
  face had conveyed to me something dimly reminiscent of which I had been but
  half conscious and had instantly forgotten. But the sight of that
  characteristic squint had at once revived and explained it. That the woman
  was Mrs. Schallibaum I now felt no doubt whatever.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the whole affair was profoundly mysterious. As to the change
  in the woman's appearance, there was little in that. The coarse, black hair
  might be her own, dyed, or it might be a wig. The eyebrows were made-up; it
  was a simple enough proceeding and made still more simple by the beaded veil.
  But how did she come to be there at all? How did she happen to be made-up in
  this fashion at this particular time? And, above all, how came she to be
  provided with a lump of what I had little doubt was poisoned sugar?</p>

  <p>I turned over the events of the day, and the more I considered them the
  less comprehensible they appeared. No one had followed the omnibus either on
  foot or in a vehicle, as far as I could see; and I had kept a careful
  look-out, not only at starting but for some considerable time after. Yet, all
  the time, Mrs. Schallibaum must have been following. But how? If she had
  known that I was intending to travel by the omnibus she might have gone to
  meet it and entered before I did. But she could not have known: and moreover
  she did not meet the omnibus, for we watched its approach from some
  considerable distance. I considered whether she might not have been concealed
  in the house and overheard me mention my destination to Thorndyke. But this
  failed to explain the mystery, since I had mentioned no address beyond
  "Kensington." I had, indeed, mentioned the name of Mrs. Hornby, but the
  supposition that my friends might be known by name to Mrs. Schallibaum, or
  even that she might have looked the name up in the directory, presented a
  probability too remote to be worth entertaining.</p>

  <p>But, if I reached no satisfactory conclusion, my cogitations had one
  useful effect; they occupied my mind to the exclusion of that unfortunate
  draught of tea. Not that I had been seriously uneasy after the first shock.
  The quantity that I had swallowed was not large&mdash;the tea being hotter
  than I cared for&mdash;and I remembered that, when I had thrown out the lump
  of sugar, I had turned the cup upside down on the table; so there could have
  been nothing solid left in it. And the lump of sugar was in itself
  reassuring, for it certainly would not have been used in conjunction with any
  less conspicuous but more incriminating form of poison. That lump of sugar
  was now in my pocket, reserved for careful examination at my leisure; and I
  reflected with a faint grin that it would be a little disconcerting if it
  should turn out to contain nothing but sugar after all.</p>

  <p>On leaving the tea-shop, I walked up Sloane Street with the intention of
  doing what I ought to have done earlier in the day. I was going to make
  perfectly sure that no spy was dogging my footsteps. But for my ridiculous
  confidence I could have done so quite easily before going to Endsley Gardens;
  and now, made wiser by a startling experience, I proceeded with systematic
  care. It was still broad daylight&mdash;for the lamps in the tea-shop had
  been rendered necessary only by the faulty construction of the premises and
  the dullness of the afternoon&mdash;and in an open space I could see far
  enough for complete safety. Arriving at the top of Sloane Street, I crossed
  Knightsbridge, and, entering Hyde Park, struck out towards the Serpentine.
  Passing along the eastern shore, I entered one of the long paths that lead
  towards the Marble Arch and strode along it at such a pace as would make it
  necessary for any pursuer to hurry in order to keep me in sight. Half-way
  across the great stretch of turf, I halted for a few moments and noted the
  few people who were coming in my direction. Then I turned sharply to the left
  and headed straight for the Victoria Gate, but again, half-way, I turned off
  among a clump of trees, and, standing behind the trunk of one of them, took a
  fresh survey of the people who were moving along the paths. All were at a
  considerable distance and none appeared to be coming my way.</p>

  <p>I now moved cautiously from one tree to another and passed through the
  wooded region to the south, crossed the Serpentine bridge at a rapid walk and
  hurrying along the south shore left the Park by Apsley House. From hence I
  walked at the same rapid pace along Piccadilly, insinuating myself among the
  crowd with the skill born of long acquaintance with the London streets,
  crossed amidst the seething traffic at the Circus, darted up Windmill Street
  and began to zigzag amongst the narrow streets and courts of Soho. Crossing
  the Seven Dials and Drury Lane I passed through the multitudinous
  back-streets and alleys that then filled the area south of Lincoln's Inn,
  came out by Newcastle Street, Holywell Street and Half-Moon Alley into the
  Strand, which I crossed immediately, ultimately entering the Temple by
  Devereux Court.</p>

  <p>Even then I did not relax my precautions. From one court to another I
  passed quickly, loitering in those dark entries and unexpected passages that
  are known to so few but the regular Templars, and coming out into the open
  only at the last where the wide passage of King's Bench Walk admits of no
  evasion. Half-way up the stairs, I stood for some time in the shadow,
  watching the approaches from the staircase window; and when, at length, I
  felt satisfied that I had taken every precaution that was possible, I
  inserted my key and let myself into our chambers.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke had already arrived, and, as I entered, he rose to greet me with
  an expression of evident relief.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you, Jervis," he said. "I have been rather anxious about
  you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For several reasons. One is that you are the sole danger that threatens
  these people&mdash;as far as they know. Another is that we made a most
  ridiculous mistake. We overlooked a fact that ought to have struck us
  instantly. But how have you fared?"</p>

  <p>"Better than I deserved. That good lady stuck to me like a burr&mdash;at
  least I believe she did."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt she did. We have been caught napping finely, Jervis."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"We'll go into that presently. Let us hear about your adventures
  first."</p>

  <p>I gave him a full account of my movements from the time when we parted to
  that of my arrival home, omitting no incident that I was able to remember
  and, as far as I could, reconstituting my exceedingly devious homeward
  route.</p>

  <p>"Your retreat was masterly," he remarked with a broad smile. "I should
  think that it would have utterly defeated any pursuer; and the only pity is
  that it was probably wasted on the desert air. Your pursuer had by that time
  become a fugitive. But you were wise to take these precautions, for, of
  course, Weiss might have followed you."</p>

  <p>"But I thought he was in Hamburg?"</p>

  <p>"Did you? You are a very confiding young gentleman, for a budding medical
  jurist. Of course we don't know that he is not; but the fact that he has
  given Hamburg as his present whereabouts establishes a strong presumption
  that he is somewhere else. I only hope that he has not located you, and, from
  what you tell me of your later methods, I fancy that you would have shaken
  him off even if he had started to follow you from the tea-shop."</p>

  <p>"I hope so too. But how did that woman manage to stick to me in that way?
  What was the mistake we made?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed grimly. "It was a perfectly asinine mistake, Jervis. You
  started up Kennington Park Road on a leisurely, jog-trotting omnibus, and
  neither you nor I remembered what there is underneath Kennington Park
  Road."</p>

  <p>"Underneath!" I exclaimed, completely puzzled for the moment. Then,
  suddenly realizing what he meant, "Of course!" I exclaimed. "Idiot that I am!
  You mean the electric railway?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. That explains everything. Mrs. Schallibaum must have watched us from
  some shop and quietly followed us up the lane. There were a good many women
  about and several were walking in our direction. There was nothing to
  distinguish her from the others unless you had recognized her, which you
  would hardly have been able to do if she had worn a veil and kept at a fair
  distance. At least I think not."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "I certainly should not. I had only seen her in a
  half-dark room. In outdoor clothes and with a veil, I should never have been
  able to identify her without very close inspection. Besides there was the
  disguise or make-up."</p>

  <p>"Not at that time. She would hardly come disguised to her own house, for
  it might have led to her being challenged and asked who she was. I think we
  may take it that there was no actual disguise, although she would probably
  wear a shady hat and a veil; which would have prevented either of us from
  picking her out from the other women in the street."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think happened next?"</p>

  <p>"I think that she simply walked past us&mdash;probably on the other side
  of the road&mdash;as we stood waiting for the omnibus, and turned up
  Kennington Park Road. She probably guessed that we were waiting for the
  omnibus and walked up the road in the direction in which it was going.
  Presently the omnibus would pass her, and there were you in full view on top
  keeping a vigilant look-out in the wrong direction. Then she would quicken
  her pace a little and in a minute or two would arrive at the Kennington
  Station of the South London Railway. In a minute or two more she would be in
  one of the electric trains whirling along under the street on which your
  omnibus was crawling. She would get out at the Borough Station, or she might
  take a more risky chance and go on to the Monument; but in any case she would
  wait for your omnibus, hail it and get inside. I suppose you took up some
  passengers on the way?"</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, yes. We were stopping every two or three minutes to take up or
  set down passengers; and most of them were women."</p>

  <p>"Very well; then we may take it that when you arrived at the Mansion
  House, Mrs. Schallibaum was one of your inside passengers. It was a rather
  quaint situation, I think."</p>

  <p>"Yes, confound her! What a couple of noodles she must have thought
  us!"</p>

  <p>"No doubt. And that is the one consoling feature in the case. She will
  have taken us for a pair of absolute greenhorns. But to continue. Of course
  she travelled in your omnibus to Kensington&mdash;you ought to have gone
  inside on both occasions, so that you could see every one who entered and
  examine the inside passengers; she will have followed you to Endsley Gardens
  and probably noted the house you went to. Thence she will have followed you
  to the restaurant and may even have lunched there."</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible," said I. "There were two rooms and they were filled
  principally with women."</p>

  <p>"Then she will have followed you to Sloane Street, and, as you persisted
  in riding outside, she could easily take an inside place in your omnibus. As
  to the theatre, she must have taken it as a veritable gift of the gods; an
  arrangement made by you for her special convenience."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow! consider. She had only to follow you in and see you
  safely into your seat and there you were, left till called for. She could
  then go home, make up for her part; draw out a plan of action, with the help,
  perhaps, of Mr. Weiss, provide herself with the necessary means and
  appliances and, at the appointed time, call and collect you."</p>

  <p>"That is assuming a good deal," I objected. "It is assuming, for instance,
  that she lives within a moderate distance of Sloane Square. Otherwise it
  would have been impossible."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. That is why I assume it. You don't suppose that she goes about
  habitually with lumps of prepared sugar in her pocket. And if not, then she
  must have got that lump from somewhere. Then the beads suggest a carefully
  prepared plan, and, as I said just now, she can hardly have been made-up when
  she met us in Kennington Lane. From all of which it seems likely that her
  present abode is not very far from Sloane Square."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said I, "it was taking a considerable risk. I might have
  left the theatre before she came back."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed. "But it is like a woman to take chances. A man
  would probably have stuck to you when once he had got you off your guard. But
  she was ready to take chances. She chanced the railway, and it came off; she
  chanced your remaining in the theatre, and that came off too. She calculated
  on the probability of your getting tea when you came out, and she hit it off
  again. And then she took one chance too many; she assumed that you probably
  took sugar in your tea, and she was wrong."</p>

  <p>"We are taking it for granted that the sugar was prepared," I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Our explanation is entirely hypothetical and may be entirely wrong.
  But it all hangs together, and if we find any poisonous matter in the sugar,
  it will be reasonable to assume that we are right. The sugar is the
  Experimentum Crucis. If you will hand it over to me, we will go up to the
  laboratory and make a preliminary test or two."</p>

  <p>I took the lump of sugar from my pocket and gave it to him, and he carried
  it to the gas-burner, by the light of which he examined it with a lens.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any foreign crystals on the surface," said he; "but we had
  better make a solution and go to work systematically. If it contains any
  poison we may assume that it will be some alkaloid, though I will test for
  arsenic too. But a man of Weiss's type would almost certainly use an
  alkaloid, on account of its smaller bulk and more ready solubility. You ought
  not to have carried this loose in your pocket. For legal purposes that would
  seriously interfere with its value as evidence. Bodies that are suspected of
  containing poison should be carefully isolated and preserved from contact
  with anything that might lead to doubt in the analysis. It doesn't matter
  much to us, as this analysis is only for our own information and we can
  satisfy ourselves as to the state of your pocket. But bear the rule in mind
  another time."</p>

  <p>We now ascended to the laboratory, where Thorndyke proceeded at once to
  dissolve the lump of sugar in a measured quantity of distilled water by the
  aid of gentle heat.</p>

  <p>"Before we add any acid," said he, "or introduce any fresh matter, we will
  adopt the simple preliminary measure of tasting the solution. The sugar is a
  disturbing factor, but some of the alkaloids and most mineral poisons
  excepting arsenic have a very characteristic taste."</p>

  <p>He dipped a glass rod in the warm solution and applied it gingerly to his
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, as he carefully wiped his mouth with his handkerchief,
  "simple methods are often very valuable. There isn't much doubt as to what is
  in that sugar. Let me recommend my learned brother to try the flavour. But be
  careful. A little of this will go a long way."</p>

  <p>He took a fresh rod from the rack, and, dipping it in the solution, handed
  it to me. I cautiously applied it to the tip of my tongue and was immediately
  aware of a peculiar tingling sensation accompanied by a feeling of
  numbness.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke; "what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Aconite," I replied without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed; "aconite it is, or more probably aconitine. And that, I
  think, gives us all the information we want. We need not trouble now to make
  a complete analysis, though I shall have a quantitative examination made
  later. You note the intensity of the taste and you see what the strength of
  the solution is. Evidently that lump of sugar contained a very large dose of
  the poison. If the sugar had been dissolved in your tea, the quantity that
  you drank would have contained enough aconitine to lay you out within a few
  minutes; which would account for Mrs. Schallibaum's anxiety to get clear of
  the premises. She saw you drink from the cup, but I imagine she had not seen
  you turn the sugar out."</p>

  <p>"No, I should say not, to judge by her expression. She looked terrified.
  She is not as hardened as her rascally companion."</p>

  <p>"Which is fortunate for you, Jervis. If she had not been in such a
  fluster, she would have waited until you had poured out your tea, which was
  what she probably meant to do, or have dropped the sugar into the milk-jug.
  In either case you would have got a poisonous dose before you noticed
  anything amiss."</p>

  <p>"They are a pretty pair, Thorndyke," I exclaimed. "A human life seems to
  be no more to them than the life of a fly or a beetle."</p>

  <p>"No; that is so. They are typical poisoners of the worst kind; of the
  intelligent, cautious, resourceful kind. They are a standing menace to
  society. As long as they are at large, human lives are in danger, and it is
  our business to see that they do not remain at large a moment longer than is
  unavoidable. And that brings us to another point. You had better keep indoors
  for the next few days."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense," I protested. "I can take care of myself."</p>

  <p>"I won't dispute that," said Thorndyke, "although I might. But the matter
  is of vital importance and we can't be too careful. Yours is the only
  evidence that could convict these people. They know that and will stick at
  nothing to get rid of you&mdash;for by this time they will almost certainly
  have ascertained that the tea-shop plan has failed. Now your life is of some
  value to you and to another person whom I could mention; but apart from that,
  you are the indispensable instrument for ridding society of these dangerous
  vermin. Moreover, if you were seen abroad and connected with these chambers,
  they would get the information that their case was really being investigated
  in a businesslike manner. If Weiss has not already left the country he would
  do so immediately, and if he has, Mrs. Schallibaum would join him at once,
  and we might never be able to lay hands on them. You must stay indoors, out
  of sight, and you had better write to Miss Gibson and ask her to warn the
  servants to give no information about you to anyone."</p>

  <p>"And how long," I asked, "am I to be held on parole?"</p>

  <p>"Not long, I think. We have a very promising start. If I have any luck, I
  shall be able to collect all the evidence I want in about a week. But there
  is an element of chance in some of it which prevents me from giving a date.
  And it is just possible that I may have started on a false track. But that I
  shall be able to tell you better in a day or two."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose," I said gloomily, "I shall be out of the hunt
  altogether?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he replied. "You have got the Blackmore case to attend to. I
  shall hand you over all the documents and get you to make an orderly digest
  of the evidence. You will then have all the facts and can work out the case
  for yourself. Also I shall ask you to help Polton in some little operations
  which are designed to throw light into dark places and which you will find
  both entertaining and instructive."</p>

  <p>"Supposing Mrs. Hornby should propose to call and take tea with us in the
  gardens?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"And bring Miss Gibson with her?" Thorndyke added dryly. "No, Jervis, it
  would never do. You must make that quite clear to her. It is more probable
  than not that Mrs. Schallibaum made a careful note of the house in Endsley
  Gardens, and as that would be the one place actually known to her, she and
  Weiss&mdash;if he is in England&mdash;would almost certainly keep a watch on
  it. If they should succeed in connecting that house with these chambers, a
  few inquiries would show them the exact state of the case. No; we must keep
  them in the dark if we possibly can. We have shown too much of our hand
  already. It is hard on you, but it cannot be helped."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't think I am complaining," I exclaimed. "If it is a matter of
  business, I am as keen as you are. I thought at first that you were merely
  considering the safety of my vile body. When shall I start on my job?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning. I shall give you my notes on the Blackmore case and
  the copies of the will and the depositions, from which you had better draw up
  a digest of the evidence with remarks as to the conclusions that it suggests.
  Then there are our gleanings from New Inn to be looked over and considered;
  and with regard to this case, we have the fragments of a pair of spectacles
  which had better be put together into a rather more intelligible form in case
  we have to produce them in evidence. That will keep you occupied for a day or
  two, together with some work appertaining to other cases. And now let us
  dismiss professional topics. You have not dined and neither have I, but I
  dare say Polton has made arrangements for some sort of meal. We will go down
  and see."</p>

  <p>We descended to the lower floor, where Thorndyke's anticipations were
  justified by a neatly laid table to which Polton was giving the finishing
  touches.</p>

  <h2>XI. &mdash; THE BLACKMORE CASE REVIEWED</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE of the conditions of medical practice is the capability
  of transferring one's attention at a moment's notice from one set of
  circumstances to another equally important but entirely unrelated. At each
  visit on his round, the practitioner finds himself concerned with a
  particular, self-contained group of phenomena which he must consider at the
  moment with the utmost concentration, but which he must instantly dismiss
  from his mind as he moves on to the next case. It is a difficult habit to
  acquire; for an important, distressing or obscure case is apt to take
  possession of the consciousness and hinder the exercise of attention that
  succeeding cases demand; but experience shows the faculty to be
  indispensable, and the practitioner learns in time to forget everything but
  the patient with whose condition he is occupied at the moment.</p>

  <p>My first morning's work on the Blackmore case showed me that the same
  faculty is demanded in legal practice; and it also showed me that I had yet
  to acquire it. For, as I looked over the depositions and the copy of the
  will, memories of the mysterious house in Kennington Lane continually
  intruded into my reflections, and the figure of Mrs. Schallibaum,
  white-faced, terrified, expectant, haunted me continually.</p>

  <p>In truth, my interest in the Blackmore case was little more than academic,
  whereas in the Kennington case I was one of the parties and was personally
  concerned. To me, John Blackmore was but a name, Jeffrey but a shadowy figure
  to which I could assign no definite personality, and Stephen himself but a
  casual stranger. Mr. Graves, on the other hand, was a real person. I had seen
  him amidst the tragic circumstances that had probably heralded his death, and
  had brought away with me, not only a lively recollection of him, but a
  feeling of profound pity and concern as to his fate. The villain Weiss, too,
  and the terrible woman who aided, abetted and, perhaps, even directed him,
  lived in my memory as vivid and dreadful realities. Although I had uttered no
  hint to Thorndyke, I lamented inwardly that I had not been given some
  work&mdash;if there was any to do&mdash;connected with this case, in which I
  was so deeply interested, rather than with the dry, purely legal and utterly
  bewildering case of Jeffrey Blackmore's will.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I stuck loyally to my task. I read through the depositions
  and the will&mdash;without getting a single glimmer of fresh light on the
  case&mdash;and I made a careful digest of all the facts. I compared my digest
  with Thorndyke's notes&mdash;of which I also made a copy&mdash;and found
  that, brief as they were, they contained several matters that I had
  overlooked. I also drew up a brief account of our visit to New Inn, with a
  list of the objects that we had observed or collected. And then I addressed
  myself to the second part of my task, the statement of my conclusions from
  the facts set forth.</p>

  <p>It was only when I came to make the attempt that I realized how completely
  I was at sea. In spite of Thorndyke's recommendation to study Marchmont's
  statement as it was summarized in those notes which I had copied, and of his
  hint that I should find in that statement something highly significant, I was
  borne irresistibly to one conclusion, and one only&mdash;and the wrong one at
  that, as I suspected: that Jeffrey Blackmore's will was a perfectly regular,
  sound and valid document.</p>

  <p>I tried to attack the validity of the will from various directions, and
  failed every time. As to its genuineness, that was obviously not in question.
  There seemed to me only two conceivable respects in which any objection could
  be raised, viz. the competency of Jeffrey to execute a will and the
  possibility of undue influence having been brought to bear on him.</p>

  <p>With reference to the first, there was the undoubted fact that Jeffrey was
  addicted to the opium habit, and this might, under some circumstances,
  interfere with a testator's competency to make a will. But had any such
  circumstances existed in this case? Had the drug habit produced such mental
  changes in the deceased as would destroy or weaken his judgment? There was
  not a particle of evidence in favour of any such belief. Up to the very end
  he had managed his own affairs, and, if his habits of life had undergone a
  change, they were still the habits of a perfectly sane and responsible
  man.</p>

  <p>The question of undue influence was more difficult. If it applied to any
  person in particular, that person could be none other than John Blackmore.
  Now it was an undoubted fact that, of all Jeffrey's acquaintance, his brother
  John was the only one who knew that he was in residence at New Inn. Moreover
  John had visited him there more than once. It was therefore possible that
  influence might have been brought to bear on the deceased. But there was no
  evidence that it had. The fact that the deceased man's only brother should be
  the one person who knew where he was living was not a remarkable one, and it
  had been satisfactorily explained by the necessity of Jeffrey's finding a
  reference on applying for the chambers. And against the theory of undue
  influence was the fact that the testator had voluntarily brought his will to
  the lodge and executed it in the presence of entirely disinterested
  witnesses.</p>

  <p>In the end I had to give up the problem in despair, and, abandoning the
  documents, turned my attention to the facts elicited by our visit to New
  Inn.</p>

  <p>What had we learned from our exploration? It was clear that Thorndyke had
  picked up some facts that had appeared to him important. But important in
  what respect? The only possible issue that could be raised was the validity
  or otherwise of Jeffrey Blackmore's will; and since the validity of that will
  was supported by positive evidence of the most incontestable kind, it seemed
  that nothing that we had observed could have any real bearing on the case at
  all.</p>

  <p>But this, of course, could not be. Thorndyke was no dreamer nor was he
  addicted to wild speculation. If the facts observed by us seemed to him to be
  relevant to the case, I was prepared to assume that they were relevant,
  although I could not see their connection with it. And, on this assumption, I
  proceeded to examine them afresh.</p>

  <p>Now, whatever Thorndyke might have observed on his own account, I had
  brought away from the dead man's chambers only a single fact; and a very
  extraordinary fact it was. The cuneiform inscription was upside down. That
  was the sum of the evidence that I had collected; and the question was, What
  did it prove? To Thorndyke it conveyed some deep significance. What could
  that significance be?</p>

  <p>The inverted position was not a mere temporary accident, as it might have
  been if the frame had been stood on a shelf or support. It was hung on the
  wall, and the plates screwed on the frame showed that its position was
  permanent and that it had never hung in any other. That it could have been
  hung up by Jeffrey himself was clearly inconceivable. But allowing that it
  had been fixed in its present position by some workman when the new tenant
  moved in, the fact remained that there it had hung, presumably for months,
  and that Jeffrey Blackmore, with his expert knowledge of the cuneiform
  character, had never noticed that it was upside down; or, if he had noticed
  it, that he had never taken the trouble to have it altered.</p>

  <p>What could this mean? If he had noticed the error but had not troubled to
  correct it, that would point to a very singular state of mind, an inertness
  and indifference remarkable even in an opium-smoker. But assuming such a
  state of mind, I could not see that it had any bearing on the will, excepting
  that it was rather inconsistent with the tendency to make fussy and needless
  alterations which the testator had actually shown. On the other hand, if he
  had not noticed the inverted position of the photograph he must have been
  nearly blind or quite idiotic; for the photograph was over two feet long and
  the characters large enough to be read easily by a person of ordinary
  eyesight at a distance of forty or fifty feet. Now he obviously was not in a
  state of dementia, whereas his eyesight was admittedly bad; and it seemed to
  me that the only conclusion deducible from the photograph was that it
  furnished a measure of the badness of the deceased man's vision&mdash;that it
  proved him to have been verging on total blindness.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing startling new in this. He had, himself, declared
  that he was fast losing his sight. And again, what was the bearing of his
  partial blindness on the will? A totally blind man cannot draw up his will at
  all. But if he has eyesight sufficient to enable him to write out and sign a
  will, mere defective vision will not lead him to muddle the provisions. Yet
  something of this kind seemed to be in Thorndyke's mind, for now I recalled
  the question that he had put to the porter: "When you read the will over in
  Mr. Blackmore's presence, did you read it aloud?" That question could have
  but one significance. It implied a doubt as to whether the testator was fully
  aware of the exact nature of the document that he was signing. Yet, if he was
  able to write and sign it, surely he was able also to read it through, to say
  nothing of the fact that, unless he was demented, he must have remembered
  what he had written.</p>

  <p>Thus, once more, my reasoning only led me into a blind alley at the end of
  which was the will, regular and valid and fulfilling all the requirements
  that the law imposed. Once again I had to confess myself beaten and in full
  agreement with Mr. Marchmont that "there was no case"; that "there was
  nothing in dispute." Nevertheless, I carefully fixed in the pocket file that
  Thorndyke had given me the copy that I had made of his notes, together with
  the notes on our visit to New Inn, and the few and unsatisfactory conclusions
  at which I had arrived; and this brought me to the end of my first morning in
  my new capacity.</p>

  <p>"And how," Thorndyke asked as we sat at lunch, "has my learned friend
  progressed? Does he propose that we advise Mr. Marchmont to enter a
  caveat?"</p>

  <p>"I've read all the documents and boiled all the evidence down to a stiff
  jelly; and I am in a worse fog than ever."</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a slight mixture of metaphors in my learned friend's
  remarks. But never mind the fog, Jervis. There is a certain virtue in fog. It
  serves, like a picture frame, to surround the essential with a neutral zone
  that separates it from the irrelevant."</p>

  <p>"That is a very profound observation, Thorndyke," I remarked
  ironically.</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking so myself," he rejoined.</p>

  <p>"And if you could contrive to explain what it means&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but that is unreasonable. When one throws off a subtly philosophic
  obiter dictum one looks to the discerning critic to supply the meaning. By
  the way, I am going to introduce you to the gentle art of photography this
  afternoon. I am getting the loan of all the cheques that were drawn by
  Jeffrey Blackmore during his residence at New Inn&mdash;there are only
  twenty-three of them, all told&mdash;and I am going to photograph them."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have thought the bank people would have let them go out of
  their possession."</p>

  <p>"They are not going to. One of the partners, a Mr. Britton, is bringing
  them here himself and will be present while the photographs are being taken;
  so they will not go out of his custody. But, all the same, it is a great
  concession, and I should not have obtained it but for the fact that I have
  done a good deal of work for the bank and that Mr. Britton is more or less a
  personal friend."</p>

  <p>"By the way, how comes it that the cheques are at the bank? Why were they
  not returned to Jeffrey with the pass-book in the usual way?"</p>

  <p>"I understand from Britton," replied Thorndyke, "that all Jeffrey's
  cheques were retained by the bank at his request. When he was travelling he
  used to leave his investment securities and other valuable documents in his
  bankers' custody, and, as he has never applied to have them returned, the
  bankers still have them and are retaining them until the will is proved, when
  they will, of course, hand over everything to the executors."</p>

  <p>"What is the object of photographing these cheques?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There are several objects. First, since a good photograph is practically
  as good as the original, when we have the photographs we practically have the
  cheques for reference. Then, since a photograph can be duplicated
  indefinitely, it is possible to perform experiments on it which involve its
  destruction; which would, of course, be impossible in the case of original
  cheques."</p>

  <p>"But the ultimate object, I mean. What are you going to prove?"</p>

  <p>"You are incorrigible, Jervis," he exclaimed. "How should I know what I am
  going to prove? This is an investigation. If I knew the result beforehand, I
  shouldn't want to perform the experiment."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch, and, as we rose from the table, he said:</p>

  <p>"If we have finished, we had better go up to the laboratory and see that
  the apparatus is ready. Mr. Britton is a busy man, and, as he is doing us a
  great service, we mustn't keep him waiting when he comes."</p>

  <p>We ascended to the laboratory, where Polton was already busy inspecting
  the massively built copying camera which&mdash;with the long, steel guides on
  which the easel or copy-holder travelled&mdash;took up the whole length of
  the room on the side opposite to that occupied by the chemical bench. As I
  was to be inducted into the photographic art, I looked at it with more
  attention than I had ever done before.</p>

  <p>"We've made some improvements since you were here last, sir," said Polton,
  who was delicately lubricating the steel guides. "We've fitted these steel
  runners instead of the blackleaded wooden ones that we used to have. And
  we've made two scales instead of one. Hallo! That's the downstairs bell.
  Shall I go sir?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better," said Thorndyke. "It may not be Mr. Britton, and I
  don't want to be caught and delayed just now."</p>

  <p>However, it was Mr. Britton; a breezy alert-looking middle-aged man, who
  came in escorted by Polton and shook our hands cordially, having been
  previously warned of my presence. He carried a small but solid hand-bag, to
  which he clung tenaciously up to the very moment when its contents were
  required for use.</p>

  <p>"So that is the camera," said he, running an inquisitive eye over the
  instrument. "Very fine one, too; I am a bit of a photographer myself. What is
  that graduation on the side-bar?"</p>

  <p>"Those are the scales," replied Thorndyke, "that shows the degree of
  magnification or reduction. The pointer is fixed to the easel and travels
  with it, of course, showing the exact size of the photograph. When the
  pointer is opposite o the photograph will be identical in size with the
  object photographed; when it points to, say,  6, the photograph will be six
  times as long as the object, or magnified thirty-six times superficially,
  whereas if the pointer is at  6, the photograph will be a sixth of the
  length of the object, or one thirty-sixth superficial."</p>

  <p>"Why are there two scales?" Mr. Britton asked.</p>

  <p>"There is a separate scale for each of the two lenses that we principally
  use. For great magnification or reduction a lens of comparatively short focus
  must be used, but, as a long-focus lens gives a more perfect image, we use
  one of very long focus&mdash;thirty-six inches&mdash;for copying the same
  size or for slight magnification or reduction."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to magnify these cheques?" Mr. Britton asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in the first place," replied Thorndyke. "For convenience and speed I
  am going to photograph them half-size, so that six cheques will go on one
  whole plate. Afterwards we can enlarge from the negatives as much as we like.
  But we should probably enlarge only the signatures in any case."</p>

  <p>The precious bag was now opened and the twenty-three cheques brought out
  and laid on the bench in a consecutive series in the order of their dates.
  They were then fixed by tapes&mdash;to avoid making pin-holes in
  them&mdash;in batches of six to small drawing boards, each batch being so
  arranged that the signatures were towards the middle. The first board was
  clamped to the easel, the latter was slid along its guides until the pointer
  stood at  2 on the long-focus scale and Thorndyke proceeded to focus the
  camera with the aid of a little microscope that Polton had made for the
  purpose. When Mr. Britton and I had inspected the exquisitely sharp image on
  the focusing-screen through the microscope, Polton introduced the plate and
  made the first exposure, carrying the dark-slide off to develop the plate
  while the next batch of cheques was being fixed in position.</p>

  <p>In his photographic technique, as in everything else, Polton followed as
  closely as he could the methods of his principal and instructor; methods
  characterized by that unhurried precision that leads to perfect
  accomplishment. When the first negative was brought forth, dripping, from the
  dark-room, it was without spot or stain, scratch or pin-hole; uniform in
  colour and of exactly the required density. The six cheques shown on
  it&mdash;ridiculously small in appearance, though only reduced to
  half-length&mdash;looked as clear and sharp as fine etchings; though, to be
  sure, my opportunity for examining them was rather limited, for Polton was
  uncommonly careful to keep the wet plate out of reach and so safe from
  injury.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Britton, when, at the end of the sance, he returned his
  treasures to the bag, "you have now got twenty-three of our cheques, to all
  intents and purposes. I hope you are not going to make any unlawful use of
  them&mdash;must tell our cashiers to keep a bright look-out; and"&mdash;here
  he lowered his voice impressively and addressed himself to me and
  Polton&mdash;"you understand that this is a private matter between Dr.
  Thorndyke and me. Of course, as Mr. Blackmore is dead, there is no reason why
  his cheques should not be photographed for legal purposes; but we don't want
  it talked about; nor, I think, does Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Thorndyke agreed emphatically; "but you need not be
  uneasy, Mr. Britton. We are very uncommunicative people in this
  establishment."</p>

  <p>As my colleague and I escorted our visitor down the stairs, he returned to
  the subject of the cheques.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you want them for," he remarked. "There is no
  question turning on signatures in the case of Blackmore deceased, is
  there?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not," Thorndyke replied rather evasively.</p>

  <p>"I should say very decidedly not," said Mr. Britton, "if I understood
  Marchmont aright. And, even if there were, let me tell you, these signatures
  that you have got wouldn't help you. I have looked them over very
  closely&mdash;and I have seen a few signatures in my time, you know.
  Marchmont asked me to glance over them as a matter of form, but I don't
  believe in matters of form; I examined them very carefully. There is an
  appreciable amount of variation; a very appreciable amount. <i>But</i> under
  the variation one can trace the personal character (which is what matters);
  the subtle, indescribable quality that makes it recognizable to the expert
  eye as Jeffrey Blackmore's writing. You understand me. There is such a
  quality, which remains when the coarser characteristics vary; just as a man
  may grow old, or fat, or bald, or may take to drink, and become quite
  changed; and yet, through it all, he preserves a certain something which
  makes him recognizable as a member of a particular family. Well, I find that
  quality in all those signatures, and so will you, if you have had enough
  experience of handwriting. I thought it best to mention it in case you might
  be giving yourself unnecessary trouble."</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you," said Thorndyke, "and I need not say that the
  information is of great value, coming from such a highly expert source. As a
  matter of fact, your hint will be of great value to me."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with Mr. Britton, and, as the latter disappeared down the
  stairs, he turned into the sitting-room and remarked:</p>

  <p>"There is a very weighty and significant observation, Jervis. I advise you
  to consider it attentively in all its bearings."</p>

  <p>"You mean the fact that these signatures are undoubtedly genuine?"</p>

  <p>"I meant, rather, the very interesting general truth that is contained in
  Britton's statement; that physiognomy is not a mere matter of facial
  character. A man carries his personal trademark, not in his face only, but in
  his nervous system and muscles&mdash;giving rise to characteristic movements
  and gait; in his larynx&mdash;producing an individual voice; and even in his
  mouth, as shown by individual peculiarities of speech and accent. And the
  individual nervous system, by means of these characteristic movements,
  transfers its peculiarities to inanimate objects that are the products of
  such movements; as we see in pictures, in carving, in musical execution and
  in handwriting. No one has ever painted quite like Reynolds or Romney; no one
  has ever played exactly like Liszt or Paganini; the pictures or the sounds
  produced by them, were, so to speak, an extension of the physiognomy of the
  artist. And so with handwriting. A particular specimen is the product of a
  particular set of motor centres in an individual brain."</p>

  <p>"These are very interesting considerations, Thorndyke," I remarked; "but I
  don't quite see their present application. Do you mean them to bear in any
  special way on the Blackmore case?"</p>

  <p>"I think they do bear on it very directly. I thought so while Mr. Britton
  was making his very illuminating remarks."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how. In fact I cannot see why you are going into the question
  of the signatures at all. The signature on the will is admittedly genuine,
  and that seems to me to dispose of the whole affair."</p>

  <p>"My dear Jervis," said he, "you and Marchmont are allowing yourselves to
  be obsessed by a particular fact&mdash;a very striking and weighty fact, I
  will admit, but still, only an isolated fact. Jeffrey Blackmore executed his
  will in a regular manner, complying with all the necessary formalities and
  conditions. In the face of that single circumstance you and Marchmont would
  'chuck up the sponge,' as the old pugilists expressed it. Now that is a great
  mistake. You should never allow yourself to be bullied and browbeaten by a
  single fact."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Thorndyke!" I protested, "this fact seems to be final. It
  covers all possibilities&mdash;-unless you can suggest any other that would
  cancel it."</p>

  <p>"I could suggest a dozen," he replied. "Let us take an instance. Supposing
  Jeffrey executed this will for a wager; that he immediately revoked it and
  made a fresh will, that he placed the latter in the custody of some person
  and that that person has suppressed it."</p>

  <p>"Surely you do not make this suggestion seriously!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do not," he replied with a smile. "I merely give it as an
  instance to show that your final and absolute fact is really only conditional
  on there being no other fact that cancels it."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he might have made a third will?"</p>

  <p>"It is obviously possible. A man who makes two wills may make three or
  more; but I may say that I see no present reason for assuming the existence
  of another will. What I want to impress on you is the necessity of
  considering all the facts instead of bumping heavily against the most
  conspicuous one and forgetting all the rest. By the way, here is a little
  problem for you. What was the object of which these are the parts?"</p>

  <p>He pushed across the table a little cardboard box, having first removed
  the lid. In it were a number of very small pieces of broken glass, some of
  which had been cemented together by their edges.</p>

  <p>"These, I suppose," said I, looking with considerable curiosity at the
  little collection, "are the pieces of glass that we picked up in poor
  Blackmore's bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see that Polton has been endeavouring to reconstitute the
  object, whatever it was; but he has not been very successful, for the
  fragments were too small and irregular and the collection too incomplete.
  However, here is a specimen, built up of six small pieces, which exhibits the
  general character of the object fairly well."</p>

  <p>He picked out the little irregularly shaped object and handed it to me;
  and I could not but admire the neatness with which Polton had joined the tiny
  fragments together.</p>

  <p>I took the little "restoration," and, holding it up before my eyes, moved
  it to and fro as I looked through it at the window.</p>

  <p>"It was not a lens," I pronounced eventually.</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed, "it was not a lens."</p>

  <p>"And so cannot have been a spectacle-glass. But the surface was
  curved&mdash;one side convex and the other concave&mdash;and the little piece
  that remains of the original edge seems to have been ground to fit a bezel or
  frame. I should say that these are portions of a watch-glass."</p>

  <p>"That is Polton's opinion," said Thorndyke, "and I think you are both
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"What do you say to the glass of a miniature or locket?"</p>

  <p>"That is rather more probable, but it is not my view."</p>

  <p>"What do you think it is?" I asked. But Thorndyke was not to be drawn.</p>

  <p>"I am submitting the problem for solution by my learned friend," he
  replied with an exasperating smile, and then added: "I don't say that you and
  Polton are wrong; only that I don't agree with you. Perhaps you had better
  make a note of the properties of this object, and consider it at your leisure
  when you are ruminating on the other data referring to the Blackmore
  case."</p>

  <p>"My ruminations," I said, "always lead me back to the same point."</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't let them," he replied. "Shuffle your data about. Invent
  hypotheses. Never mind if they seem rather wild. Don't put them aside on that
  account. Take the first hypothesis that you can invent and test it thoroughly
  with your facts. You will probably have to reject it, but you will be certain
  to have learned something new. Then try again with a fresh one. You remember
  what I told you of my methods when I began this branch of practice and had
  plenty of time on my hands?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I do."</p>

  <p>"Well, I used to occupy my leisure in constructing imaginary cases, mostly
  criminal, for the purpose of study and for the acquirement of experience. For
  instance, I would devise an ingenious fraud and would plan it in detail,
  taking every precaution that I could think of against failure or detection,
  considering, and elaborately providing for, every imaginable contingency. For
  the time being, my entire attention was concentrated on it, making it as
  perfect and secure and undetectable as I could with the knowledge and
  ingenuity at my command. I behaved exactly as if I were proposing actually to
  carry it out, and my life or liberty depended on its success&mdash;excepting
  that I made full notes of every detail of the scheme. Then when my plans were
  as complete as I could make them, and I could think of no way in which to
  improve them, I changed sides and considered the case from the standpoint of
  detection. I analysed the case, I picked out its inherent and unavoidable
  weaknesses, and, especially, I noted the respects in which a fraudulent
  proceeding of a particular kind differed from the <i>bona fide</i> proceeding
  that it simulated. The exercise was invaluable to me. I acquired as much
  experience from those imaginary cases as I should from real ones, and in
  addition, I learned a method which is the one that I practise to this
  day."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you still invent imaginary cases as mental
  exercises?"</p>

  <p>"No; I mean that, when I have a problem of any intricacy, I invent a case
  which fits the facts and the assumed motives of one of the parties. Then I
  work at that case until I find whether it leads to elucidation or to some
  fundamental disagreement. In the latter case I reject it and begin the
  process over again."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't that method sometimes involve a good deal of wasted time and
  energy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No; because each time that you fail to establish a given case, you
  exclude a particular explanation of the facts and narrow down the field of
  inquiry. By repeating the process, you are bound, in the end, to arrive at an
  imaginary case which fits all the facts. Then your imaginary case is the real
  case and the problem is solved. Let me recommend you to give the method a
  trial."</p>

  <p>I promised to do so, though with no very lively expectations as to the
  result, and with this, the subject was allowed, for the present, to drop.</p>

  <h2>XII. &mdash; THE PORTRAIT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE state of mind which Thorndyke had advised me to
  cultivate was one that did not come easily. However much I endeavoured to
  shuffle the facts of the Blackmore case, there was one which inevitably
  turned up on the top of the pack. The circumstances surrounding the execution
  of Jeffrey Blackmore's will intruded into all my cogitations on the subject
  with hopeless persistency. That scene in the porter's lodge was to me what
  King Charles's head was to poor Mr. Dick. In the midst of my praiseworthy
  efforts to construct some intelligible scheme of the case, it would make its
  appearance and reduce my mind to instant chaos.</p>

  <p>For the next few days, Thorndyke was very much occupied with one or two
  civil cases, which kept him in court during the whole of the sitting; and
  when he came home, he seemed indisposed to talk on professional topics.
  Meanwhile, Polton worked steadily at the photographs of the signatures, and,
  with a view to gaining experience, I assisted him and watched his
  methods.</p>

  <p>In the present case, the signatures were enlarged from their original
  dimensions&mdash;rather less than an inch and a half in length&mdash;to a
  length of four and a half inches; which rendered all the little peculiarities
  of the handwriting surprisingly distinct and conspicuous. Each signature was
  eventually mounted on a slip of card bearing a number and the date of the
  cheque from which it was taken, so that it was possible to place any two
  signatures together for comparison. I looked over the whole series and very
  carefully compared those which showed any differences, but without
  discovering anything more than might have been expected in view of Mr.
  Britton's statement. There were some trifling variations, but they were all
  very much alike, and no one could doubt, on looking at them, that they were
  all written by the same hand.</p>

  <p>As this, however, was apparently not in dispute, it furnished no new
  information. Thorndyke's object&mdash;for I felt certain that he had
  something definite in his mind&mdash;must be to test something apart from the
  genuineness of the signatures. But what could that something be? I dared not
  ask him, for questions of that kind were anathema, so there was nothing for
  it but to lie low and see what he would do with the photographs.</p>

  <p>The whole series was finished on the fourth morning after my adventure at
  Sloane Square, and the pack of cards was duly delivered by Polton when he
  brought in the breakfast tray. Thorndyke took up the pack somewhat with the
  air of a whist player, and, as he ran through them, I noticed that the number
  had increased from twenty-three to twenty-four.</p>

  <p>"The additional one," Thorndyke explained, "is the signature to the first
  will, which was in Marchmont's possession. I have added it to the collection
  as it carries us back to an earlier date. The signature of the second will
  presumably resembles those of the cheques drawn about the same date. But that
  is not material, or, if it should become so, we could claim to examine the
  second will."</p>

  <p>He laid the cards out on the table in the order of their dates and slowly
  ran his eye down the series. I watched him closely and ventured presently to
  ask:</p>

  <p>"Do you agree with Mr. Britton as to the general identity of character in
  the whole set of signatures?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "I should certainly have put them down as being all the
  signatures of one person. The variations are very slight. The later
  signatures are a little stiffer, a little more shaky and indistinct, and the
  B's and k's are both appreciably different from those in the earlier ones.
  But there is another fact which emerges when the whole series is seen
  together, and it is so striking and significant a fact, that I am astonished
  at its not having been remarked on by Mr. Britton."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said I, stooping to examine the photographs with fresh interest;
  "what is that?"</p>

  <p>"It is a very simple fact and very obvious, but yet, as I have said, very
  significant. Look carefully at number one, which is the signature of the
  first will, dated three years ago, and compare it with number three, dated
  the eighteenth of September last year."</p>

  <p>"They look to me identical," said I, after a careful comparison.</p>

  <p>"So they do to me," said Thorndyke. "Neither of them shows the change that
  occurred later. But if you look at number two, dated the sixteenth of
  September, you will see that it is in the later style. So is number four,
  dated the twenty-third of September; but numbers five and six, both at the
  beginning of October, are in the earlier style, like the signature of the
  will. Thereafter all the signatures are in the new style; but, if you compare
  number two, dated the sixteenth of September with number twenty-four, dated
  the fourteenth of March of this year&mdash;the day of Jeffrey's
  death&mdash;you see that they exhibit no difference. Both are in the 'later
  style,' but the last shows no greater change than the first. Don't you
  consider these facts very striking and significant?"</p>

  <p>I reflected a few moments, trying to make out the deep significance to
  which Thorndyke was directing my attention&mdash;and not succeeding very
  triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"You mean," I said, "that the occasional reversions to the earlier form
  convey some material suggestion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but more than that. What we learn from an inspection of this series
  is this: that there was a change in the character of the signature; a very
  slight change, but quite recognizable. Now that change was not gradual or
  insidious nor was it progressive. It occurred at a certain definite time. At
  first there were one or two reversions to the earlier form, but after number
  six the new style continued to the end; and you notice that it continued
  without any increase in the change and without any variation. There are no
  intermediate forms. Some of the signatures are in the 'old style' and some in
  the 'new,' but there are none that are half and half. So that, to repeat: We
  have here two types of signature, very much alike, but distinguishable. They
  alternate, but do not merge into one another to produce intermediate forms.
  The change occurs abruptly, but shows no tendency to increase as time goes
  on; it is not a progressive change. What do you make of that, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"It is very remarkable," I said, poring over the cards to verify
  Thorndyke's statements. "I don't quite know what to make of it. If the
  circumstances admitted of the idea of forgery, one would suspect the
  genuineness of some of the signatures. But they don't&mdash;at any rate, in
  the case of the later will, to say nothing of Mr. Britton's opinion on the
  signatures."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Thorndyke, "there must be some explanation of the change in
  the character of the signatures, and that explanation cannot be the failing
  eyesight of the writer; for that is a gradually progressive and continuous
  condition, whereas the change in the writing is abrupt and intermittent."</p>

  <p>I considered Thorndyke's remark for a few moments; and then a
  light&mdash;though not a very brilliant one&mdash;seemed to break on me.</p>

  <p>"I think I see what you are driving at," said I. "You mean that the change
  in the writing must be associated with some new condition affecting the
  writer, and that that condition existed intermittently?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded approvingly, and I continued:</p>

  <p>"The only intermittent condition that we know of is the effect of opium.
  So that we might consider the clearer signatures to have been made when
  Jeffrey was in his normal state, and the less distinct ones after a bout of
  opium-smoking."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly sound reasoning," said Thorndyke. "What further
  conclusion does it lead to?"</p>

  <p>"It suggests that the opium habit had been only recently acquired, since
  the change was noticed only about the time he went to live at New Inn; and,
  since the change in the writing is at first intermittent and then continuous,
  we may infer that the opium-smoking was at first occasional and later became
  a a confirmed habit."</p>

  <p>"Quite a reasonable conclusion and very clearly stated," said Thorndyke.
  "I don't say that I entirely agree with you, or that you have exhausted the
  information that these signatures offer. But you have started in the right
  direction."</p>

  <p>"I may be on the right road," I said gloomily; "but I am stuck fast in one
  place and I see no chance of getting any farther."</p>

  <p>"But you have a quantity of data," said Thorndyke. "You have all the facts
  that I had to start with, from which I constructed the hypothesis that I am
  now busily engaged in verifying. I have a few more data now, for 'as money
  makes money' so knowledge begets knowledge, and I put my original capital out
  to interest. Shall we tabulate the facts that are in our joint possession and
  see what they suggest?"</p>

  <p>I grasped eagerly at the offer, though I had conned over my notes again
  and again.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced a slip of paper from a drawer, and, uncapping his
  fountain-pen, proceeded to write down the leading facts, reading each aloud
  as soon as it was written.</p>

  <p>"1. The second will was unnecessary since it contained no new matter,
  expressed no new intentions and met no new conditions, and the first will was
  quite clear and efficient.</p>

  <p>"2. The evident intention of the testator was to leave the bulk of his
  property to Stephen Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"3. The second will did not, under existing circumstances, give effect to
  this intention, whereas the first will did.</p>

  <p>"4. The signature of the second will differs slightly from that of the
  first, and also from what had hitherto been the testator's ordinary
  signature.</p>

  <p>"And now we come to a very curious group of dates, which I will advise you
  to consider with great attention.</p>

  <p>"5. Mrs. Wilson made her will at the beginning of September last year,
  without acquainting Jeffrey Blackmore, who seems to have been unaware of the
  existence of this will.</p>

  <p>"6. His own second will was dated the twelfth of November of last
  year.</p>

  <p>"7. Mrs. Wilson died of cancer on the twelfth of March this present
  year.</p>

  <p>"8. Jeffrey Blackmore was last seen alive on the fourteenth of March.</p>

  <p>"9. His body was discovered on the fifteenth of March.</p>

  <p>"10. The change in the character of his signature began about September
  last year and became permanent after the middle of October.</p>

  <p>"You will find that collection of facts repay careful study, Jervis,
  especially when considered in relation to the further data:</p>

  <p>"11. That we found in Blackmore's chambers a framed inscription of large
  size, hung upside down, together with what appeared to be the remains of a
  watch-glass and a box of stearine candles and some other objects."</p>

  <p>He passed the paper to me and I pored over it intently, focusing my
  attention on the various items with all the power of my will. But, struggle
  as I would, no general conclusion could be made to emerge from the mass of
  apparently disconnected facts.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Thorndyke said presently, after watching with grave interest my
  unavailing efforts; "what do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" I exclaimed desperately, slapping the paper down on the table.
  "Of course, I can see that there are some queer coincidences. But how do they
  bear on the case? I understand that you want to upset this will; which we
  know to have been signed without compulsion or even suggestion in the
  presence of two respectable men, who have sworn to the identity of the
  document. That is your object, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is."</p>

  <p>"Then I am hanged if I see how you are going to do it. Not, I should say,
  by offering a group of vague coincidences that would muddle any brain but
  your own."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled softly but pursued the subject no farther.</p>

  <p>"Put that paper in your file with your other notes," he said, "and think
  it over at your leisure. And now I want a little help from you. Have you a
  good memory for faces?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly good, I think. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have a photograph of a man whom I think you may have met. Just
  look at it and tell me if you remember the face."</p>

  <p>He drew a cabinet size photograph from an envelope that had come by the
  morning's post and handed it to me.</p>

  <p>"I have certainly seen this face somewhere," said I, taking the portrait
  over to the window to examine it more thoroughly, "but I can't, at the
  moment, remember where."</p>

  <p>"Try," said Thorndyke. "If you have seen the face before, you should be
  able to recall the person."</p>

  <p>I looked intently at the photograph, and the more I looked, the more
  familiar did the face appear. Suddenly the identity of the man flashed into
  my mind and I exclaimed in astonishment:</p>

  <p>"It can't be that poor creature at Kennington, Mr. Graves?"</p>

  <p>"I think it can," replied Thorndyke, "and I think it is. But could you
  swear to the identity in a court of law?"</p>

  <p>"It is my firm conviction that the photograph is that of Mr. Graves. I
  would swear to that."</p>

  <p>"No man ought to swear to more," said Thorndyke. "Identification is always
  a matter of opinion or belief. The man who will swear unconditionally to
  identity from memory only is a man whose evidence should be discredited. I
  think your sworn testimony would be sufficient."</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that the production of this photograph filled me
  with amazement and curiosity as to how Thorndyke had obtained it. But, as he
  replaced it impassively in its envelope without volunteering any explanation,
  I felt that I could not question him directly. Nevertheless, I ventured to
  approach the subject in an indirect manner.</p>

  <p>"Did you get any information from those Darmstadt people?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Schnitzler? Yes. I learned, through the medium of an official
  acquaintance, that Dr. H. Weiss was a stranger to them; that they knew
  nothing about him excepting that he had ordered from them, and been supplied
  with, a hundred grammes of pure hydrochlorate of morphine."</p>

  <p>"All at once?"</p>

  <p>"No. In separate parcels of twenty-five grammes each."</p>

  <p>"Is that all you know about Weiss?"</p>

  <p>"It is all that I actually know; but it is not all that I suspect&mdash;on
  very substantial grounds. By the way, what did you think of the
  coachman?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I thought very much about him. Why?"</p>

  <p>"You never suspected that he and Weiss were one and the same person?"</p>

  <p>"No. How could they be? They weren't in the least alike. And one was a
  Scotchman and the other a German. But perhaps you know that they were the
  same?"</p>

  <p>"I only know what you have told me. But considering that you never saw
  them together, that the coachman was never available for messages or
  assistance when Weiss was with you; that Weiss always made his appearance
  some time after you arrived, and disappeared some time before you left; it
  has seemed to me that they might have been the same person."</p>

  <p>"I should say it was impossible. They were so very different in
  appearance. But supposing that they were the same; would the fact be of any
  importance?"</p>

  <p>"It would mean that we could save ourselves the trouble of looking for the
  coachman. And it would suggest some inferences, which will occur to you if
  you think the matter over. But being only a speculative opinion, at present,
  it would not be safe to infer very much from it."</p>

  <p>"You have rather taken me by surprise," I remarked. "It seems that you
  have been working at this Kennington case, and working pretty actively I
  imagine, whereas I supposed that your entire attention was taken up by the
  Blackmore affair."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't do," he replied, "to allow one's entire attention to be taken
  up by any one case. I have half a dozen others&mdash;minor cases,
  mostly&mdash;to which I am attending at this moment. Did you think I was
  proposing to keep you under lock and key indefinitely?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no. But I thought the Kennington case would have to wait its turn.
  And I had no idea that you were in possession of enough facts to enable you
  to get any farther with it."</p>

  <p>"But you knew all the very striking facts of the case, and you saw the
  further evidence that we extracted from the empty house."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean those things that we picked out from the rubbish under the
  grate?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You saw those curious little pieces of reed and the pair of
  spectacles. They are lying in the top drawer of that cabinet at this moment,
  and I should recommend you to have another look at them. To me they are most
  instructive. The pieces of reed offered an extremely valuable suggestion, and
  the spectacles enabled me to test that suggestion and turn it into actual
  information."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," said I, "the pieces of reed convey nothing to me. I don't
  know what they are or of what they have formed a part."</p>

  <p>"I think," he replied, "that if you examine them with due consideration,
  you will find their use pretty obvious. Have a good look at them and the
  spectacles too. Think over all that you know of that mysterious group of
  people who lived in that house, and see if you cannot form some coherent
  theory of their actions. Think, also, if we have not some information in our
  possession by which we might be able to identify some of them, and infer the
  identity of the others. You will have a quiet day, as I shall not be home
  until the evening; set yourself this task. I assure you that you have the
  material for identifying&mdash;or rather for testing the identity of&mdash;at
  least one of those persons. Go over your material systematically, and let me
  know in the evening what further investigations you would propose."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said I. "It shall be done according to your word. I will
  addle my brain afresh with the affair of Mr. Weiss and his patient, and let
  the Blackmore case rip."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to do that. You have a whole day before you. An hour's
  really close consideration of the Kennington case ought to show you what your
  next move should be, and then you could devote yourself to the consideration
  of Jeffrey Blackmore's will."</p>

  <p>With this final piece of advice, Thorndyke collected the papers for his
  day's work, and, having deposited them in his brief bag, took his departure,
  leaving me to my meditations.</p>

  <h2>XIII. &mdash; THE STATEMENT OF SAMUEL WILKINS</h2>

  <p class="first">AS soon as I was alone, I commenced my investigations with a
  rather desperate hope of eliciting some startling and unsuspected facts. I
  opened the drawer and taking from it the two pieces of reed and the shattered
  remains of the spectacles, laid them on the table. The repairs that Thorndyke
  had contemplated in the case of the spectacles, had not been made. Apparently
  they had not been necessary. The battered wreck that lay before me, just as
  we had found it, had evidently furnished the necessary information; for,
  since Thorndyke was in possession of a portrait of Mr. Graves, it was clear
  that he had succeeded in identifying him so far as to get into communication
  with some one who had known him intimately.</p>

  <p>The circumstance should have been encouraging. But somehow it was not.
  What was possible to Thorndyke was, theoretically, possible to me&mdash;or to
  anyone else. But the possibility did not realize itself in practice. There
  was the personal equation. Thorndyke's brain was not an ordinary brain. Facts
  of which his mind instantly perceived the relation remained to other people
  unconnected and without meaning. His powers of observation and rapid
  inference were almost incredible, as I had noticed again and again, and
  always with undiminished wonder. He seemed to take in everything at a single
  glance and in an instant to appreciate the meaning of everything that he had
  seen.</p>

  <p>Here was a case in point. I had myself seen all that he had seen, and,
  indeed, much more; for I had looked on the very people and witnessed their
  actions, whereas he had never set eyes on any of them. I had examined the
  little handful of rubbish that he had gathered up so carefully, and would
  have flung it back under the grate without a qualm. Not a glimmer of light
  had I perceived in the cloud of mystery, nor even a hint of the direction in
  which to seek enlightenment. And yet Thorndyke had, in some incomprehensible
  manner, contrived to piece together facts that I had probably not even
  observed, and that so completely that he had already, in these few days,
  narrowed down the field of inquiry to quite a small area.</p>

  <p>From these reflections I returned to the objects on the table. The
  spectacles, as things of which I had some expert knowledge, were not so
  profound a mystery to me. A pair of spectacles might easily afford good
  evidence for identification; that I perceived clearly enough. Not a
  ready-made pair, picked up casually at a shop, but a pair constructed by a
  skilled optician to remedy a particular defect of vision and to fit a
  particular face. And such were the spectacles before me. The build of the
  frames was peculiar; the existence of a cylindrical lens&mdash;which I could
  easily make out from the remaining fragments&mdash;showed that one glass had
  been cut to a prescribed shape and almost certainly ground to a particular
  formula, and also that the distance between centres must have been carefully
  secured. Hence these spectacles had an individual character. But it was
  manifestly impossible to inquire of all the spectacle-makers in
  Europe&mdash;for the glasses were not necessarily made in England. As
  confirmation the spectacles might be valuable; as a starting-point they were
  of no use at all.</p>

  <p>From the spectacles I turned to the pieces of reed. These were what had
  given Thorndyke his start. Would they give me a leading hint too? I looked at
  them and wondered what it was that they had told Thorndyke. The little
  fragment of the red paper label had a dark-brown or thin black border
  ornamented with a fret-pattern, and on it I detected a couple of tiny points
  of gold like the dust from leaf-gilding. But I learned nothing from that.
  Then the shorter piece of reed was artificially hollowed to fit on the longer
  piece. Apparently it formed a protective sheath or cap. But what did it
  protect? Presumably a point or edge of some kind. Could this be a
  pocket-knife of any sort, such as a small stencil-knife? No; the material was
  too fragile for a knife-handle. It could not be an etching-needle for the
  same reason; and it was not a surgical appliance&mdash;at least it was not
  like any surgical instrument that was known to me.</p>

  <p>I turned it over and over and cudgelled my brains; and then I had a
  brilliant idea. Was it a reed pen of which the point had been broken off? I
  knew that reed pens were still in use by draughtsmen of decorative leanings
  with an affection for the "fat line." Could any of our friends be
  draughtsmen? This seemed the most probable solution of the difficulty, and
  the more I thought about it the more likely it seemed. Draughtsmen usually
  sign their work intelligibly, and even when they use a device instead of a
  signature their identity is easily traceable. Could it be that Mr. Graves,
  for instance, was an illustrator, and that Thorndyke had established his
  identity by looking through the works of all the well-known thick-line
  draughtsmen?</p>

  <p>This problem occupied me for the rest of the day. My explanation did not
  seem quite to fit Thorndyke's description of his methods; but I could think
  of no other. I turned it over during my solitary lunch; I meditated on it
  with the aid of several pipes in the afternoon; and having refreshed my brain
  with a cup of tea, I went forth to walk in the Temple gardens&mdash;which I
  was permitted to do without breaking my parole&mdash;to think it out
  afresh.</p>

  <p>The result was disappointing. I was basing my reasoning on the assumption
  that the pieces of reed were parts of a particular appliance, appertaining to
  a particular craft; whereas they might be the remains of something quite
  different, appertaining to a totally different craft or to no craft at all.
  And in no case did they point to any known individual or indicate any but the
  vaguest kind of search. After pacing the pleasant walks for upwards of two
  hours, I at length turned back towards our chambers, where I arrived as the
  lamp-lighter was just finishing his round.</p>

  <p>My fruitless speculations had left me somewhat irritable. The lighted
  windows that I had noticed as I approached had given me the impression that
  Thorndyke had returned. I had intended to press him for a little further
  information. When, therefore, I let myself into our chambers and found,
  instead of my colleague, a total stranger&mdash;and only a back view at
  that&mdash;I was disappointed and annoyed.</p>

  <p>The stranger was seated by the table, reading a large document that looked
  like a lease. He made no movement when I entered, but when I crossed the room
  and wished him "Good evening," he half rose and bowed silently. It was then
  that I first saw his face, and a mighty start he gave me. For one moment I
  actually thought he was Mr. Weiss, so close was the resemblance, but
  immediately I perceived that he was a much smaller man.</p>

  <p>I sat down nearly opposite and stole an occasional furtive glance at him.
  The resemblance to Weiss was really remarkable. The same flaxen hair, the
  same ragged beard and a similar red nose, with the patches of <i>acne
  rosacea</i> spreading to the adjacent cheeks. He wore spectacles, too,
  through which he took a quick glance at me now and again, returning
  immediately to his document.</p>

  <p>After some moments of rather embarrassing silence, I ventured to remark
  that it was a mild evening; to which he assented with a sort of Scotch
  "Hm&mdash;hm" and nodded slowly. Then came another interval of silence,
  during which I speculated on the possibility of his being a relative of Mr.
  Weiss and wondered what the deuce he was doing in our chambers.</p>

  <p>"Have you an appointment with Dr. Thorndyke?" I asked, at length.</p>

  <p>He bowed solemnly, and by way of reply&mdash;in the affirmative, as I
  assumed&mdash;emitted another "hm&mdash;hm."</p>

  <p>I looked at him sharply, a little nettled by his lack of manners;
  whereupon he opened out the lease so that it screened his face, and as I
  glanced at the back of the document, I was astonished to observe that it was
  shaking rapidly.</p>

  <p>The fellow was actually laughing! What he found in my simple question to
  cause him so much amusement I was totally unable to imagine. But there it
  was. The tremulous movements of the document left me in no possible doubt
  that he was for some reason convulsed with laughter.</p>

  <p>It was extremely mysterious. Also, it was rather embarrassing. I took out
  my pocket file and began to look over my notes. Then the document was lowered
  and I was able to get another look at the stranger's face. He was really
  extraordinarily like Weiss. The shaggy eyebrows, throwing the eye-sockets
  into shadow, gave him, in conjunction with the spectacles, the same owlish,
  solemn expression that I had noticed in my Kennington acquaintance; and
  which, by the way, was singularly out of character with the frivolous
  behaviour that I had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>From time to time as I looked at him, he caught my eye and instantly
  averted his own, turning rather red. Apparently he was a shy, nervous man,
  which might account for his giggling; for I have noticed that shy or nervous
  people have a habit of smiling inopportunely and even giggling when
  embarrassed by meeting an over-steady eye. And it seemed my own eye had this
  disconcerting quality, for even as I looked at him, the document suddenly
  went up again and began to shake violently.</p>

  <p>I stood it for a minute or two, but, finding the situation intolerably
  embarrassing, I rose, and brusquely excusing myself, went up to the
  laboratory to look for Polton and inquire at what time Thorndyke was expected
  home. To my surprise, however, on entering, I discovered Thorndyke himself
  just finishing the mounting of a microscopical specimen.</p>

  <p>"Did you know that there is some one below waiting to see you?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Is it anyone you know?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "It is a red-nosed, sniggering fool in spectacles. He
  has got a lease or a deed or some other sort of document which he has been
  using to play a sort of idiotic game of Peep-Bo! I couldn't stand him, so I
  came up here."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed heartily at my description of his client.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing at?" I asked sourly; at which he laughed yet more
  heartily and added to the aggravation by wiping his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Our friend seems to have put you out," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"He put me out literally. If I had stayed much longer I should have
  punched his head."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Thorndyke, "I am glad you didn't stay. But come down
  and let me introduce you."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. I've had enough of him for the present."</p>

  <p>"But I have a very special reason for wishing to introduce you. I think
  you will get some information from him that will interest you very much; and
  you needn't quarrel with a man for being of a cheerful disposition."</p>

  <p>"Cheerful be hanged!" I exclaimed. "I don't call a man cheerful because he
  behaves like a gibbering idiot."</p>

  <p>To this Thorndyke made no reply but a broad and appreciative smile, and we
  descended to the lower floor. As we entered the room, the stranger rose, and,
  glancing in an embarrassed way from one of us to the other, suddenly broke
  out into an undeniable snigger. I looked at him sternly, and Thorndyke, quite
  unmoved by his indecorous behaviour, said in a grave voice:</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce you, Jervis; though I think you have met this gentleman
  before."</p>

  <p>"I think not," I said stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, you have, sir," interposed the stranger; and, as he spoke, I
  started; for the voice was uncommonly like the familiar voice of Polton.</p>

  <p>I looked at the speaker with sudden suspicion. And now I could see that
  the flaxen hair was a wig; that the beard had a decidedly artificial look,
  and that the eyes that beamed through the spectacles were remarkably like the
  eyes of our factotum. But the blotchy face, the bulbous nose and the shaggy,
  overhanging eyebrows were alien features that I could not reconcile with the
  personality of our refined and aristocratic-looking little assistant.</p>

  <p>"Is this a practical joke?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke; "it is a demonstration. When we were talking this
  morning it appeared to me that you did not realize the extent to which it is
  possible to conceal identity under suitable conditions of light. So I
  arranged, with Polton's rather reluctant assistance, to give you ocular
  evidence. The conditions are not favourable&mdash;which makes the
  demonstration more convincing. This is a very well-lighted room and Polton is
  a very poor actor; in spite of which it has been possible for you to sit
  opposite him for several minutes and look at him, I have no doubt, very
  attentively, without discovering his identity. If the room had been lighted
  only with a candle, and Polton had been equal to the task of supporting his
  make-up with an appropriate voice and manner, the deception would have been
  perfect."</p>

  <p>"I can see that he has a wig on, quite plainly," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but you would not in a dimly lighted room. On the other hand, if
  Polton were to walk down Fleet Street at mid-day in this condition, the
  make-up would be conspicuously evident to any moderately observant passer-by.
  The secret of making up consists in a careful adjustment to the conditions of
  light and distance in which the make-up is to be seen. That in use on the
  stage would look ridiculous in an ordinary room; that which would serve in an
  artificially lighted room would look ridiculous out of doors by
  daylight."</p>

  <p>"Is any effective make-up possible out of doors in ordinary daylight?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," replied Thorndyke. "But it must be on a totally different scale
  from that of the stage. A wig, and especially a beard or moustache, must be
  joined up at the edges with hair actually stuck on the skin with transparent
  cement and carefully trimmed with scissors. The same applies to eyebrows; and
  alterations in the colour of the skin must be carried out much more subtly.
  Polton's nose has been built up with a small covering of toupe-paste, the
  pimples on the cheeks produced with little particles of the same material;
  and the general tinting has been done with grease-paint with a very light
  scumble of powder colour to take off some of the shine. This would be
  possible in outdoor make-up, but it would have to be done with the greatest
  care and delicacy; in fact, with what the art-critics call 'reticence.' A
  very little make-up is sufficient and too much is fatal. You would be
  surprised to see how little paste is required to alter the shape of the nose
  and the entire character of the face."</p>

  <p>At this moment there came a loud knock at the door; a single, solid dab of
  the knocker which Polton seemed to recognize, for he ejaculated:</p>

  <p>"Good lord, sir! That'll be Wilkins, the cabman! I'd forgotten all about
  him. Whatever's to be done?"</p>

  <p>He stared at us in ludicrous horror for a moment or two, and then,
  snatching off his wig, beard and spectacles, poked them into a cupboard. But
  his appearance was now too much even for Thorndyke&mdash;who hastily got
  behind him&mdash;for he had now resumed his ordinary personality&mdash;but
  with a very material difference.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's nothing to laugh at, sir," he exclaimed indignantly as I crammed
  my handkerchief into my mouth. "Somebody's got to let him in, or he'll go
  away."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and that won't do," said Thorndyke. "But don't worry, Polton. You
  can step into the office. I'll open the door."</p>

  <p>Polton's presence of mind, however, seemed to have entirely forsaken him,
  for he only hovered irresolutely in the wake of his principal. As the door
  opened, a thick and husky voice inquired:</p>

  <p>"Gent of the name of Polton live here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite right," said Thorndyke. "Come in. Your name is Wilkins, I
  think?"</p>

  <p>"That's me, sir," said the voice; and in response to Thorndyke's
  invitation, a typical "growler" cabman of the old school, complete even to
  imbricated cape and dangling badge, stalked into the room, and glancing round
  with a mixture of embarrassment and defiance, suddenly fixed on Polton's nose
  a look of devouring curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, then," Polton remarked nervously.</p>

  <p>"Yus," replied the cabman in a slightly hostile tone. "Here I am. What am
  I wanted to do? And where's this here Mr. Polton?"</p>

  <p>"I am Mr. Polton," replied our abashed assistant.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's the other Mr. Polton what I want," said the cabman, with his
  eyes still riveted on the olfactory prominence.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any other Mr. Polton," our subordinate replied irritably. "I
  am the&mdash;er&mdash;person who spoke to you in the shelter."</p>

  <p>"Are you though?" said the manifestly incredulous cabby. "I shouldn't have
  thought it; but you ought to know. What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"We want you," said Thorndyke, "to answer one or two questions. And the
  first one is, Are you a teetotaller?"</p>

  <p>The question being illustrated by the production of a decanter, the
  cabman's dignity relaxed somewhat.</p>

  <p>"I ain't bigoted," said he.</p>

  <p>"Then sit down and mix yourself a glass of grog. Soda or plain water?"</p>

  <p>"May as well have all the extries," replied the cabman, sitting down and
  grasping the decanter with the air of a man who means business. "Per'aps you
  wouldn't mind squirtin' out the soda, sir, bein' more used to it."</p>

  <p>While these preliminaries were being arranged, Polton silently slipped out
  of the room, and when our visitor had fortified himself with a gulp of the
  uncommonly stiff mixture, the examination began.</p>

  <p>"Your name, I think, is Wilkins?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"That's me, sir. Samuel Wilkins is my name."</p>

  <p>"And your occupation?"</p>

  <p>"Is a very tryin' one and not paid for as it deserves. I drives a cab,
  sir; a four-wheeled cab is what I drives; and a very poor job it is."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to remember a very foggy day about a month ago?"</p>

  <p>"Do I not, sir! A regler sneezer that was! Wednesday, the fourteenth of
  March. I remember the date because my benefit society came down on me for
  arrears that morning."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us what happened to you between six and seven in the
  evening of that day?"</p>

  <p>"I will, sir," replied the cabman, emptying his tumbler by way of bracing
  himself up for the effort. "A little before six I was waiting on the arrival
  side of the Great Northern Station, King's Cross, when I see a gentleman and
  a lady coming out. The gentleman he looks up and down and then he sees me and
  walks up to the cab and opens the door and helps the lady in. Then he says to
  me: 'Do you know New Inn?' he says. That's what he says to me what was born
  and brought up in White Horse Alley, Drury Lane.</p>

  <p>"'Get inside,' says I.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' says he, 'you drive in through the gate in Wych Street,' he says,
  as if he expected me to go in by Houghton Street and down the steps, 'and
  then,' he says, 'you drive nearly to the end and you'll see a house with a
  large brass plate at the corner of the doorway. That's where we want to be
  set down,' he says, and with that he nips in and pulls up the windows and off
  we goes.</p>

  <p>"It took us a full half-hour to get to New Inn through the fog, for I had
  to get down and lead the horse part of the way. As I drove in under the
  archway, I saw it was half-past six by the clock in the porter's lodge. I
  drove down nearly to the end of the inn and drew up opposite a house where
  there was a big brass plate by the doorway. It was number thirty-one. Then
  the gent crawls out and hands me five bob&mdash;two 'arf-crowns&mdash;and
  then he helps the lady out, and away they waddles to the doorway and I see
  them start up the stairs very slow&mdash;regler Pilgrim's Progress. And that
  was the last I see of 'em."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke wrote down the cabman's statement verbatim together with his own
  questions, and then asked:</p>

  <p>"Can you give us any description of the gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"The gent," said Wilkins, was a very respectable-looking gent, though he
  did look as if he'd had a drop of something short, and small blame to him on
  a day like that. But he was all there, and he knew what was the proper fare
  for a foggy evening, which is more than some of 'em do. He was a elderly
  gent, about sixty, and he wore spectacles, but he didn't seem to be able to
  see much through 'em. He was a funny 'un to look at; as round in the back as
  a turtle and he walked with his head stuck forward like a goose."</p>

  <p>"What made you think he had been drinking?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he wasn't as steady as he might have been on his pins. But he
  wasn't drunk, you know. Only a bit wobbly on the plates."</p>

  <p>"And the lady; what was she like?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't see much of her because her head was wrapped up in a sort of
  woollen veil. But I should say she wasn't a chicken. Might have been about
  the same age as the gent, but I couldn't swear to that. She seemed a trifle
  rickety on the pins too; in fact they were a rum-looking couple. I watched
  'em tottering across the pavement and up the stairs, hanging on to each
  other, him peering through his blinkers and she trying to see through her
  veil, and I thought it was a jolly good job they'd got a nice sound cab and a
  steady driver to bring 'em safe home."</p>

  <p>"How was the lady dressed?"</p>

  <p>"Can't rightly say, not being a hexpert. Her head was done up in this here
  veil like a pudden in a cloth and she had a small hat on. She had a dark
  brown mantle with a fringe of beads round it and a black dress; and I noticed
  when she got into the cab at the station that one of her stockings looked
  like the bellows of a concertina. That's all I can tell you."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke wrote down the last answer, and, having read the entire
  statement aloud, handed the pen to our visitor.</p>

  <p>"If that is all correct," he said, "I will ask you to sign your name at
  the bottom."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to swear a affidavy that it's all true?" asked
  Wilkins.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," replied Thorndyke. "We may have to call you to give
  evidence in court, and then you'll be sworn; and you'll also be paid for your
  attendance. For the present I want you to keep your own counsel and say
  nothing to anybody about having been here. We have to make some other
  inquiries and we don't want the affair talked about."</p>

  <p>"I see, sir," said Wilkins, as he laboriously traced his signature at the
  foot of the statement; "you don't want the other parties for to ogle your
  lay. All right, sir; you can depend on me. I'm fly, I am."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Wilkins," said Thorndyke. "And now what are we to give you for
  your trouble in coming here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll leave the fare to you, sir. You know what the information's worth;
  but I should think 'arf a thick-un wouldn't hurt you."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laid on the table a couple of sovereigns, at the sight of which
  the cabman's eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>"We have your address, Wilkins," said he. "If we want you as a witness we
  shall let you know, and if not, there will be another two pounds for you at
  the end of a fortnight, provided you have not let this little interview leak
  out."</p>

  <p>Wilkins gathered up the spoils gleefully. "You can trust me, sir," said
  he, "for to keep my mouth shut. I knows which side my bread's buttered. Good
  night, gentlemen all."</p>

  <p>With this comprehensive salute he moved towards the door and let himself
  out.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jervis; what do you think of it?" Thorndyke asked, as the cabman's
  footsteps faded away in a creaky diminuendo.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think. This woman is a new factor in the case and I
  don't know how to place her."</p>

  <p>"Not entirely new," said Thorndyke. "You have not forgotten those beads
  that we found in Jeffrey's bedroom, have you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I had not forgotten them, but I did not see that they told us much
  excepting that some woman had apparently been in his bedroom at some
  time."</p>

  <p>"That, I think, is all that they did tell us. But now they tell us that a
  particular woman was in his bedroom at a particular time, which is a good
  deal more significant."</p>

  <p>"Yes. It almost looks as if she must have been there when he made away
  with himself."</p>

  <p>"It does, very much."</p>

  <p>"By the way, you were right about the colours of those beads, and also
  about the way they were used."</p>

  <p>"As to their use, that was a mere guess; but it has turned out to be
  correct. It was well that we found the beads, for, small as is the amount of
  information they give, it is still enough to carry us a stage further."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that the cabman's evidence tells us only that this woman entered
  the house. The beads tell us that she was in the bedroom; which, as you say,
  seems to connect her to some extent with Jeffrey's death. Not necessarily, of
  course. It is only a suggestion; but a rather strong suggestion under the
  peculiar circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Even so," said I, "this new fact seems to me so far from clearing up the
  mystery, only to add to it a fresh element of still deeper mystery. The
  porter's evidence at the inquest could leave no doubt that Jeffrey
  contemplated suicide, and his preparations pointedly suggest this particular
  night as the time selected by him for doing away with himself. Is not that
  so?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. The porter's evidence was very clear on that point."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't see where this woman comes in. It is obvious that her
  presence at the inn, and especially in the bedroom, on this occasion and in
  these strange, secret circumstances, has a rather sinister look; but yet I do
  not see in what way she could have been connected with the tragedy. Perhaps,
  after all, she has nothing to do with it. You remember that Jeffrey went to
  the lodge about eight o'clock, to pay his rent, and chatted for some time
  with the porter. That looks as if the lady had already left."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke. "But, on the other hand, Jeffrey's remarks to the
  porter with reference to the cab do not quite agree with the account that we
  have just heard from Wilkins. Which suggests&mdash;as does Wilkins's account
  generally&mdash;some secrecy as to the lady's visit to his chambers."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who the woman was?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know," he replied. "I have a rather strong suspicion that I
  can identify her, but I am waiting for some further facts."</p>

  <p>"Is your suspicion founded on some new matter that you have discovered, or
  is it deducible from facts that are known to me?"</p>

  <p>"I think," he replied, "that you know practically all that I know,
  although I have, in one instance, turned a very strong suspicion into a
  certainty by further inquiries. But I think you ought to be able to form some
  idea as to who this lady probably was."</p>

  <p>"But no woman has been mentioned in the case at all."</p>

  <p>"No; but I think you should be able to give this lady a name,
  notwithstanding."</p>

  <p>"Should I? Then I begin to suspect that I am not cut out for medico-legal
  practice, for I don't see the faintest glimmer of a suggestion."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled benevolently. "Don't be discouraged, Jervis," said he. "I
  expect that when you first began to go round the wards, you doubted whether
  you were cut out for medical practice. I did. For special work one needs
  special knowledge and an acquired faculty for making use of it. What does a
  second year's student make of a small thoracic aneurysm? He knows the anatomy
  of the chest; he begins to know the normal heart sounds and areas of
  dullness; but he cannot yet fit his various items of knowledge together. Then
  comes the experienced physician and perhaps makes a complete diagnosis
  without any examination at all, merely from hearing the patient speak or
  cough. He has the same facts as the student, but he has acquired the faculty
  of instantly connecting an abnormality of function with its correleated
  anatomical change. It is a matter of experience. And, with your previous
  training, you will soon acquire the faculty. Try to observe everything. Let
  nothing escape you. And try constantly to find some connection between facts
  and events that seem to be unconnected. That is my advice to you; and with
  that we will put away the Blackmore case for the present and consider our
  day's work at an end."</p>

  <h2>XIV. &mdash; THORNDYKE LAYS THE MINE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE information supplied by Mr. Samuel Wilkins, so far from
  dispelling the cloud of mystery that hung over the Blackmore case, only
  enveloped it in deeper obscurity, so far as I was concerned. The new problem
  that Thorndyke offered for solution was a tougher one than any of the others.
  He proposed that I should identify and give a name to this mysterious woman.
  But how could I? No woman, excepting Mrs. Wilson, had been mentioned in
  connection with the case. This new <i>dramatis persona</i> had appeared
  suddenly from nowhere and straightway vanished without leaving a trace,
  excepting the two or three beads that we had picked up in Jeffrey's room.</p>

  <p>Nor was it in the least clear what part, if any, she had played in the
  tragedy. The facts still pointed as plainly to suicide as before her
  appearance. Jeffrey's repeated hints as to his intentions, and the very
  significant preparations that he had made, were enough to negative any idea
  of foul play. And yet the woman's presence in the chambers at that time, the
  secret manner of her arrival and her precautions against recognition,
  strongly suggested some kind of complicity in the dreadful event that
  followed.</p>

  <p>But what complicity is possible in the case of suicide? The woman might
  have furnished him with the syringe and the poison, but it would not have
  been necessary for her to go to his chambers for that purpose. Vague ideas of
  persuasion and hypnotic suggestion floated through my brain; but the
  explanations did not fit the case and the hypnotic suggestion of crime is not
  very convincing to the medical mind. Then I thought of blackmail in
  connection with some disgraceful secret; but though this was a more hopeful
  suggestion, it was not very probable, considering Jeffrey's age and
  character.</p>

  <p>And all these speculations failed to throw the faintest light on the main
  question: "Who was this woman?"</p>

  <p>A couple of days passed, during which Thorndyke made no further reference
  to the case. He was, most of the time, away from home, though how he was
  engaged I had no idea. What was rather more unusual was that Polton seemed to
  have deserted the laboratory and taken to outdoor pursuits. I assumed that he
  had seized the opportunity of leaving me in charge, and I dimly surmised that
  he was acting as Thorndyke's private inquiry agent, as he seemed to have done
  in the case of Samuel Wilkins.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the second day Thorndyke came home in obviously good
  spirits, and his first proceedings aroused my expectant curiosity. He went to
  a cupboard and brought forth a box of Trichinopoly cheroots. Now the
  Trichinopoly cheroot was Thorndyke's one dissipation, to be enjoyed only on
  rare and specially festive occasions; which, in practice, meant those
  occasions on which he had scored some important point or solved some
  unusually tough problem. Wherefore I watched him with lively interest.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that the 'Trichy' is such a poisonous beast," he remarked,
  taking up one of the cheroots and sniffing at it delicately. "There is no
  other cigar like it, to a really abandoned smoker." He laid the cigar back in
  the box and continued: "I think I shall treat myself to one after dinner to
  celebrate the occasion."</p>

  <p>"What occasion?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The completion of the Blackmore case. I am just going to write to
  Marchmont advising him to enter a caveat."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that you have discovered a flaw in the will, after
  all?"</p>

  <p>"A flaw!" he exclaimed. "My dear Jervis, that second will is a
  forgery."</p>

  <p>I stared at him in amazement; for his assertion sounded like nothing more
  or less than arrant nonsense.</p>

  <p>"But the thing is impossible, Thorndyke," I said. "Not only did the
  witnesses recognize their own signatures and the painter's greasy
  finger-marks, but they had both read the will and remembered its
  contents."</p>

  <p>"Yes; that is the interesting feature in the case. It is a very pretty
  problem. I shall give you a last chance to solve it. To-morrow evening we
  shall have to give a full explanation, so you have another twenty-four hours
  in which to think it over. And, meanwhile, I am going to take you to my club
  to dine. I think we shall be pretty safe there from Mrs. Schallibaum."</p>

  <p>He sat down and wrote a letter, which was apparently quite a short one,
  and having addressed and stamped it, prepared to go out.</p>

  <p>"Come," said he, "let us away to 'the gay and festive scenes and halls of
  dazzling light.' We will lay the mine in the Fleet Street pillar box. I
  should like to be in Marchmont's office when it explodes."</p>

  <p>"I expect, for that matter," said I, "that the explosion will be felt
  pretty distinctly in these chambers."</p>

  <p>"I expect so, too," replied Thorndyke; "and that reminds me that I shall
  be out all day to-morrow, so, if Marchmont calls, you must do all that you
  can to persuade him to come round after dinner and bring Stephen Blackmore,
  if possible. I am anxious to have Stephen here, as he will be able to give us
  some further information and confirm certain matters of fact."</p>

  <p>I promised to exercise my utmost powers of persuasion on Mr. Marchmont
  which I should certainly have done on my own account, being now on the very
  tiptoe of curiosity to hear Thorndyke's explanation of the unthinkable
  conclusion at which he had arrived&mdash;and the subject dropped completely;
  nor could I, during the rest of the evening, induce my colleague to reopen it
  even in the most indirect or allusive manner.</p>

  <p>Our explanations in respect of Mr. Marchmont were fully realized; for, on
  the following morning, within an hour of Thorndyke's departure from our
  chambers, the knocker was plied with more than usual emphasis, and, on my
  opening the door, I discovered the solicitor in company with a somewhat older
  gentleman. Mr. Marchmont appeared somewhat out of humour, while his companion
  was obviously in a state of extreme irritation.</p>

  <p>"How d'you do, Dr. Jervis?" said Marchmont as he entered at my invitation.
  "Your friend, I suppose, is not in just now?"</p>

  <p>"No; and he will not be returning until the evening."</p>

  <p>"Hm; I'm sorry. We wished to see him rather particularly. This is my
  partner, Mr. Winwood."</p>

  <p>The latter gentleman bowed stiffly and Marchmont continued:</p>

  <p>"We have had a letter from Dr. Thorndyke, and it is, I may say, a rather
  curious letter; in fact, a very singular letter indeed."</p>

  <p>"It is the letter of a madman!" growled Mr. Winwood.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Winwood; nothing of the kind. Control yourself, I beg you. But
  really, the letter is rather incomprehensible. It relates to the will of the
  late Jeffrey Blackmore&mdash;you know the main facts of the case; and we
  cannot reconcile it with those facts."</p>

  <p>"This is the letter," exclaimed Mr. Winwood, dragging the document from
  his wallet and slapping it down on the table. "If you are acquainted with the
  case, sir, just read that, and let us hear what <i>you</i> think."</p>

  <p>I took up the letter and read aloud:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"JEFFREY BLACKMORE, DECD.</p>

    <p>"DEAR MR. MARCHMONT,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I have gone into this case with great care and have now no doubt that
    the second will is a forgery. Criminal proceedings will, I think, be
    inevitable, but meanwhile it would be wise to enter a caveat.</p>

    <p>"If you could look in at my chambers to-morrow evening we could talk the
    case over; and I should be glad if you could bring Mr. Stephen Blackmore;
    whose personal knowledge of the events and the parties concerned would be
    of great assistance in clearing up obscure details.</p>

    <p>"I am,</p>

    <p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>"JOHN EVELYN THORNDYKE</p>

    <p>"C.F. MARCHMONT, ESQ."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Well!" exclaimed Mr. Winwood, glaring ferociously at me, "what do you
  think of the learned counsel's opinion?"</p>

  <p>"I knew that Thorndyke was writing to you to this effect," I replied, "but
  I must frankly confess that I can make nothing of it. Have you acted on his
  advice?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" shouted the irascible lawyer. "Do you suppose that we
  wish to make ourselves the laughing-stock of the courts? The thing is
  impossible&mdash;ridiculously impossible!"</p>

  <p>"It can't be that, you know," I said, a little stiffly, for I was somewhat
  nettled by Mr. Winwood's manner, "or Thorndyke would not have written this
  letter. The conclusion looks as impossible to me as it does to you; but I
  have complete confidence in Thorndyke. If he says that the will is a forgery,
  I have no doubt that it is a forgery."</p>

  <p>"But how the deuce can it be?" roared Winwood. "You know the circumstances
  under which the will was executed."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but so does Thorndyke. And he is not a man who overlooks important
  facts. It is useless to argue with me. I am in a complete fog about the case
  myself. You had better come in this evening and talk it over with him as he
  suggests."</p>

  <p>"It is very inconvenient," grumbled Mr. Winwood. "We shall have to dine in
  town."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marchmont, "but it is the only thing to be done. As Dr. Jervis
  says, we must take it that Thorndyke has something solid to base his opinion
  on. He doesn't make elementary mistakes. And, of course, if what he says is
  correct, Mr. Stephen's position is totally changed."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" exclaimed Winwood, "he has found a mare's nest, I tell you. Still,
  I agree that the explanation should be worth hearing."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't mind Winwood," said Marchmont, in an apologetic undertone;
  "he's a peppery old fellow with a rough tongue, but he doesn't mean any
  harm." Which statement Winwood assented to&mdash;or dissented from; for it
  was impossible to say which&mdash;by a prolonged growl.</p>

  <p>"We shall expect you then," I said, "about eight to-night, and you will
  try to bring Mr. Stephen with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Marchmont; "I think we can promise that he shall come with
  us. I have sent him a telegram asking him to attend."</p>

  <p>With this the two lawyers took their departure, leaving me to meditate
  upon my colleague's astonishing statement; which I did, considerably to the
  prejudice of other employment. That Thorndyke would be able to justify the
  opinion that he had given, I had no doubt whatever; but yet there was no
  denying that his proposition was what Mr. Dick Swiveller would call "a
  staggerer."</p>

  <p>When Thorndyke returned, I informed him of the visit of our two friends,
  and acquainted him with the sentiments that they had expressed; whereat he
  smiled with quiet amusement.</p>

  <p>"I thought," he remarked, "that letter would bring Marchmont to our door
  before long. As to Winwood, I have never met him, but I gather that he is one
  of those people whom you 'mustn't mind.' In a general way, I object to people
  who tacitly claim exemption from the ordinary rules of conduct that are held
  to be binding on their fellows. But, as he promises to give us what the
  variety artists call 'an extra turn,' we will make the best of him and give
  him a run for his money."</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke smiled mischievously&mdash;I understood the meaning of that
  smile later in the evening&mdash;and asked: "What do you think of the affair
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I have given it up," I answered. "To my paralysed brain, the Blackmore
  case is like an endless algebraical problem propounded by an insane
  mathematician."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed at my comparison, which I flatter myself was a rather
  apt one.</p>

  <p>"Come and dine," said he, "and let us crack a bottle, that our hearts may
  not turn to water under the frown of the disdainful Winwood. I think the old
  'Bell' in Holborn will meet our present requirements better than the club.
  There is something jovial and roystering about an ancient tavern; but we must
  keep a sharp lookout for Mrs. Schallibaum."</p>

  <p>Thereupon we set forth; and, after a week's close imprisonment, I once
  more looked upon the friendly London streets, the cheerfully lighted shop
  windows and the multitudes of companionable strangers who moved unceasingly
  along the pavements.</p>
  <hr>

        id="CH15"></a>

  <h2>XV. &mdash; THORNDYKE EXPLODES THE MINE</h2>

  <p class="first">WE had not been back in our chambers more than a few minutes
  when the little brass knocker on the inner door rattled out its summons.
  Thorndyke himself opened the door, and, finding our three expected visitors
  on the threshold, he admitted them and closed the "oak."</p>

  <p>"We have accepted your invitation, you see," said Marchmont, whose manner
  was now a little flurried and uneasy. "This is my partner, Mr. Winwood; you
  haven't met before, I think. Well, we thought we should like to hear some
  further particulars from you, as we could not quite understand your
  letter."</p>

  <p>"My conclusion, I suppose," said Thorndyke, "was a little unexpected?"</p>

  <p>"It was more than that, sir," exclaimed Winwood. "It was absolutely
  irreconcilable either with the facts of the case or with common physical
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"At the first glance," Thorndyke agreed, "it would probably have that
  appearance."</p>

  <p>"It has that appearance still to me." said Winwood, growing suddenly red
  and wrathful, "and I may say that I speak as a solicitor who was practising
  in the law when you were an infant in arms. You tell us, sir, that this will
  is a forgery; this will, which was executed in broad daylight in the presence
  of two unimpeachable witnesses who have sworn, not only to their signatures
  and the contents of the document, but to their very finger-marks on the
  paper. Are those finger-marks forgeries, too? Have you examined and tested
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," replied Thorndyke. "The fact is they are of no interest to
  me, as I am not disputing the witnesses' signatures."</p>

  <p>At this, Mr. Winwood fairly danced with irritation.</p>

  <p>"Marchmont!" he exclaimed fiercely, "you know this good gentleman, I
  believe. Tell me, is he addicted to practical jokes?"</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear Winwood," groaned Marchmont, "I pray you&mdash;I beg you to
  control yourself. No doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But confound it!" roared Winwood, "you have, yourself, heard him say that
  the will is a forgery, but that he doesn't dispute the signatures; which,"
  concluded Winwood, banging his fist down on the table, "is damned
  nonsense."</p>

  <p>"May I suggest," interposed Stephen Blackmore, "that we came here to
  receive Dr. Thorndyke's explanation of his letter. Perhaps it would be better
  to postpone any comments until we have heard it."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly, undoubtedly," said Marchmont. "Let me entreat you, Winwood,
  to listen patiently and refrain from interruption until we have heard our
  learned friend's exposition of the case."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," Winwood replied sulkily; "I'll say no more."</p>

  <p>He sank into a chair with the manner of a man who shuts himself up and
  turns the key; and so remained&mdash;excepting when the internal pressure
  approached bursting-point&mdash;throughout the subsequent proceedings,
  silent, stony and impassive, like a seated statue of Obstinacy.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said Marchmont, "that you have some new facts that are not in
  our possession?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke; "we have some new facts, and we have made some
  new use of the old ones. But how shall I lay the case before you? Shall I
  state my theory of the sequence of events and furnish the verification
  afterwards? Or shall I retrace the actual course of my investigations and
  give you the facts in the order in which I obtained them myself, with the
  inferences from them?"</p>

  <p>"I almost think," said Mr. Marchmont, "that it would be better if you
  would put us in possession of the new facts. Then, if the conclusions that
  follow from them are not sufficiently obvious, we could hear the argument.
  What do you say, Winwood?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Winwood roused himself for an instant, barked out the one word
  "Facts," and shut himself up again with a snap.</p>

  <p>"You would like to have the new facts by themselves?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"If you please. The facts only, in the first place, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; and here I caught his eye with a mischievous
  twinkle in it that I understood perfectly; for I had most of the facts myself
  and realized how much these two lawyers were likely to extract from them.
  Winwood was going to "have a run for his money," as Thorndyke had
  promised.</p>

  <p>My colleague, having placed on the table by his side a small cardboard box
  and the sheets of notes from his file, glanced quickly at Mr. Winwood and
  began:</p>

  <p>"The first important new facts came into my possession on the day on which
  you introduced the case to me. In the evening, after you left, I availed
  myself of Mr. Stephen's kind invitation to look over his uncle's chambers in
  New Inn. I wished to do so in order to ascertain, if possible, what had been
  the habits of the deceased during his residence there. When I arrived with
  Dr. Jervis, Mr. Stephen was in the chambers, and I learned from him that his
  uncle was an Oriental scholar of some position and that he had a very
  thorough acquaintance with the cuneiform writing. Now, while I was talking
  with Mr. Stephen I made a very curious discovery. On the wall over the
  fire-place hung a large framed photograph of an ancient Persian inscription
  in the cuneiform character; and that photograph was upside down."</p>

  <p>"Upside down!" exclaimed Stephen. "But that is really very odd."</p>

  <p>"Very odd indeed," agreed Thorndyke, "and very suggestive. The way in
  which it came to be inverted is pretty obvious and also rather suggestive.
  The photograph had evidently been in the frame some years but had apparently
  never been hung up before."</p>

  <p>"It had not," said Stephen, "though I don't know how you arrived at the
  fact. It used to stand on the mantelpiece in his old rooms in Jermyn
  Street."</p>

  <p>"Well," continued Thorndyke, "the frame-maker had pasted his label on the
  back of the frame, and as this label hung the right way up, it appeared as if
  the person who fixed the photograph on the wall had adopted it as a
  guide."</p>

  <p>"It is very extraordinary," said Stephen. "I should have thought the
  person who hung it would have asked Uncle Jeffrey which was the right way up;
  and I can't imagine how on earth it could have hung all those months without
  his noticing it. He must have been practically blind."</p>

  <p>Here Marchmont, who had been thinking hard, with knitted brows, suddenly
  brightened up.</p>

  <p>"I see your point," said he. "You mean that if Jeffrey was as blind as
  that, it would have been possible for some person to substitute a false will,
  which he might sign without noticing the substitution."</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't make the will a forgery," growled Winwood. "If Jeffrey
  signed it, it was Jeffrey's will. You could contest it if you could prove the
  fraud. But he said: 'This is my will,' and the two witnesses read it and have
  identified it."</p>

  <p>"Did they read it aloud?" asked Stephen.</p>

  <p>"No, they did not," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Can you prove substitution?" asked Marchmont.</p>

  <p>"I haven't asserted it," answered Thorndyke, "My position is that the will
  is a forgery."</p>

  <p>"But it is not," said Winwood.</p>

  <p>"We won't argue it now," said Thorndyke. "I ask you to note the fact that
  the inscription was upside down. I also observed on the walls of the chambers
  some valuable Japanese colour-prints on which were recent damp-spots. I noted
  that the sitting-room had a gas-stove and that the kitchen contained
  practically no stores or remains of food and hardly any traces of even the
  simplest cooking. In the bedroom I found a large box that had contained a
  considerable stock of hard stearine candles, six to the pound, and that was
  now nearly empty. I examined the clothing of the deceased. On the soles of
  the boots I observed dried mud, which was unlike that on my own and Jervis's
  boots, from the gravelly square of the inn. I noted a crease on each leg of
  the deceased man's trousers as if they had been turned up half-way to the
  knee; and in the waistcoat pocket I found the stump of a 'Contango' pencil.
  On the floor of the bedroom, I found a portion of an oval glass somewhat like
  that of a watch or locket, but ground at the edge to a double bevel. Dr.
  Jervis and I also found one or two beads and a bugle, all of dark brown
  glass."</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke paused, and Marchmont, who had been gazing at him with
  growing amazement, said nervously:</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;yes. Very interesting. These observations of
  yours&mdash;er&mdash;are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are all the observations that I made at New Inn."</p>

  <p>The two lawyers looked at one another and Stephen Blackmore stared fixedly
  at a spot on the hearth-rug. Then Mr. Winwood's face contorted itself into a
  sour, lopsided smile.</p>

  <p>"You might have observed a good many other things, sir," said he, "if you
  had looked. If you had examined the doors, you would have noted that they had
  hinges and were covered with paint; and, if you had looked up the chimney you
  might have noted that it was black inside."</p>

  <p>"Now, now, Winwood," protested Marchmont in an agony of uneasiness as to
  what his partner might say next, "I must really beg you&mdash;er&mdash;to
  refrain from&mdash;what Mr. Winwood means, Dr. Thorndyke, is
  that&mdash;er&mdash;we do not quite perceive the relevancy of
  these&mdash;ah&mdash;observations of yours."</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said Thorndyke, "but you will perceive their relevancy
  later. For the present, I will ask you to note the facts and bear them in
  mind, so that you may be able to follow the argument when we come to
  that.</p>

  <p>"The next set of data I acquired on the same evening, when Dr. Jervis gave
  me a detailed account of a very strange adventure that befell him. I need not
  burden you with all the details, but I will give you the substance of his
  story."</p>

  <p>He then proceeded to recount the incidents connected with my visits to Mr.
  Graves, dwelling on the personal peculiarities of the parties concerned and
  especially of the patient, and not even forgetting the very singular
  spectacles worn by Mr. Weiss. He also explained briefly the construction of
  the chart, presenting the latter for the inspection of his hearers. To this
  recital our three visitors listened in utter bewilderment, as, indeed did I
  also; for I could not conceive in what way my adventures could possibly be
  related to the affairs of the late Mr. Blackmore. This was manifestly the
  view taken by Mr. Marchmont, for, during a pause in which the chart was
  handed to him, he remarked somewhat stiffly:</p>

  <p>"I am assuming, Dr. Thorndyke, that the curious story you are telling us
  has some relevance to the matter in which we are interested."</p>

  <p>"You are quite correct in your assumption," replied Thorndyke. "The story
  is very relevant indeed, as you will presently be convinced."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Marchmont, sinking back once more into his chair with a
  sigh of resignation.</p>

  <p>"A few days ago," pursued Thorndyke, "Dr. Jervis and I located, with the
  aid of this chart, the house to which he had been called. We found that the
  late tenant had left somewhat hurriedly and that the house was to let; and,
  as no other kind of investigation was possible, we obtained the keys and made
  an exploration of the premises."</p>

  <p>Here he gave a brief account of our visit and the conditions that we
  observed, and was proceeding to furnish a list of the articles that we had
  found under the grate, when Mr. Winwood started from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Really, sir!" he exclaimed, "this is too much! Have I come here, at great
  personal inconvenience, to hear you read the inventory of a dust-heap?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled benevolently and caught my eye, once more, with a gleam
  of amusement.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Winwood," he said quietly. "You came here to learn the
  facts of the case, and I am giving them to you. Please don't interrupt
  needlessly and waste time."</p>

  <p>Winwood stared at him ferociously for several seconds; then, somewhat
  disconcerted by the unruffled calm of his manner, he uttered a snort of
  defiance, sat down heavily and shut himself up again.</p>

  <p>"We will now," Thorndyke continued, with unmoved serenity, "consider these
  relics in more detail, and we will begin with this pair of spectacles. They
  belonged to a person who was near-sighted and astigmatic in the left eye and
  almost certainly blind in the right. Such a description agrees entirely with
  Dr. Jervis's account of the sick man."</p>

  <p>He paused for the moment, and then, as no one made any comment,
  proceeded:</p>

  <p>"We next come to these little pieces of reed, which you, Mr. Stephen, will
  probably recognize as the remains of a Japanese brush, such as is used for
  writing in Chinese ink or for making small drawings."</p>

  <p>Again he paused, as though expecting some remark from his listeners; but
  no one spoke, and he continued:</p>

  <p>"Then there is this bottle with the theatrical wig-maker's label on it,
  which once contained cement such as is used for fixing on false beards,
  moustaches or eyebrows."</p>

  <p>He paused once more and looked round expectantly at his audience, none of
  whom, however, volunteered any remark.</p>

  <p>"Do none of these objects that I have described and shown you, seem to
  have any significance for us?" he asked, in a tone of some surprise.</p>

  <p>"They convey nothing to me," said Mr. Marchmont, glancing at his partner,
  who shook his head like a restive horse.</p>

  <p>"Nor to you, Mr. Stephen?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Stephen. "Under the existing circumstances they convey no
  reasonable suggestion to me."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke hesitated as if he were half inclined to say something more;
  then, with a slight shrug, he turned over his notes and resumed:</p>

  <p>"The next group of new facts is concerned with the signatures of the
  recent cheques. We have photographed them and placed them together for the
  purpose of comparison and analysis."</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to question the signatures." said Winwood. "We have had
  a highly expert opinion, which would override ours in a court of law even if
  we differed from it; which I think we do not."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marchmont; "that is so. I think we must accept the signatures,
  especially as that of the will has been proved, beyond any question" to be
  authentic."</p>

  <p>"Very well," agreed Thorndyke; "we will pass over the signatures. Then we
  have some further evidence in regard to the spectacles, which serves to
  verify our conclusions respecting them."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Marchmont, "we might pass over that, too, as we do not
  seem to have reached any conclusions."</p>

  <p>"As you please," said Thorndyke. "It is important, but we can reserve it
  for verification. The next item will interest you more, I think. It is the
  signed and witnessed statement of Samuel Wilkins, the driver of the cab in
  which the deceased came home to the inn on the evening of his death."</p>

  <p>My colleague was right. An actual document, signed by a tangible witness,
  who could be put in the box and sworn, brought both lawyers to a state of
  attention; and when Thorndyke read out the cabman's evidence, their attention
  soon quickened into undisguised astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But this is a most mysterious affair," exclaimed Marchmont. "Who could
  this woman have been, and what could she have been doing in Jeffrey's
  chambers at this time? Can you throw any light on it, Mr. Stephen?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed I can't," replied Stephen. "It is a complete mystery to me. My
  uncle Jeffrey was a confirmed old bachelor, and, although he did not dislike
  women, he was far from partial to their society, wrapped up as he was in his
  favourite studies. To the best of my belief, he had not a single female
  friend. He was not on intimate terms even with his sister, Mrs. Wilson."</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable," mused Marchmont; "most remarkable. But, perhaps, you
  can tell us, Dr. Thorndyke, who this woman was?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "that the next item of evidence will enable
  you to form an opinion for yourselves. I only obtained it yesterday, and, as
  it made my case quite complete, I wrote off to you immediately. It is the
  statement of Joseph Ridley, another cabman, and unfortunately, a rather dull,
  unobservant fellow, unlike Wilkins. He has not much to tell us, but what
  little he has is highly instructive. Here is the statement, signed by the
  deponent and witnessed by me:</p>

  <p>"'My name is Joseph Ridley. I am the driver of a four-wheeled cab. On the
  fourteenth of March, the day of the great fog, I was waiting at Vauxhall
  Station, where I had just set down a fare. About five o'clock a lady came and
  told me to drive over to Upper Kennington Lane to take up a passenger. She
  was a middle-sized woman. I could not tell what her age was, or what she was
  like, because her head was wrapped up in a sort of knitted, woollen veil to
  keep out the fog. I did not notice how she was dressed. She got into the cab
  and I led the horse over to Upper Kennington Lane and a little way up the
  lane, until the lady tapped at the front, window for me to stop.</p>

  <p>"'She got out of the cab and told me to wait. Then she went away and
  disappeared in the fog. Presently a lady and gentleman came from the
  direction in which she had gone. The lady looked like the same lady, but I
  won't answer to that. Her head was wrapped up in the same kind of veil or
  shawl, and I noticed that she had on a dark coloured mantle with bead fringe
  on it.</p>

  <p>"'The gentleman was clean shaved and wore spectacles, and he stooped a
  good deal. I can't say whether his sight was good or bad. He helped the lady
  into the cab and told me to drive to the Great Northern Station, King's
  Cross. Then he got in himself and I drove off. I got to the station about a
  quarter to six and the lady and gentleman got out. The gentleman paid my fare
  and they both went into the station. I did not notice anything unusual about
  either of them. Directly after they had gone, I got a fresh fare and drove
  away.'</p>

  <p>"That," Thorndyke concluded, "is Joseph Ridley's statement; and I think it
  will enable you to give a meaning to the other facts that I have offered for
  your consideration."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure about that," said Marchmont. "It is all exceedingly
  mysterious. Your suggestion is, of course, that the woman who came to New Inn
  in the cab was Mrs. Schallibaum!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke. "My suggestion is that the woman was
  Jeffrey Blackmore."</p>

  <p>There was deathly silence for a few moments. We were all absolutely
  thunderstruck, and sat gaping at Thorndyke in speechless-astonishment.
  Then&mdash;Mr. Winwood fairly bounced out of his chair.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;my&mdash;good&mdash;sir!" he screeched. "Jeffrey Blackmore was
  with her at the time!"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," replied Thorndyke, "my suggestion implies that the person who
  was with her was not Jeffrey Blackmore."</p>

  <p>"But he was!" bawled Winwood. "The porter saw him!"</p>

  <p>"The porter saw a person whom he believed to be Jeffrey Blackmore. I
  suggest that the porter's belief was erroneous."</p>

  <p>"Well," snapped Winwood, "perhaps you can prove that it was. I don't see
  how you are going to; but perhaps you can."</p>

  <p>He subsided once more into his chair and glared defiantly at
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"You seemed," said Stephen, "to suggest some connection between the sick
  man, Graves, and my uncle. I noted it at the time, but put it aside as
  impossible. Was I right. Did you mean to suggest any connection?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest something more than a connection. I suggest identity. My
  position is that the sick man, Graves, was your uncle."</p>

  <p>"From Dr. Jervis's description," said Stephen, "this man must have been
  very like my uncle. Both were blind in the right eye and had very poor vision
  with the left; and my uncle certainly used brushes of the kind that you have
  shown us, when writing in the Japanese character, for I have watched him and
  admired his skill; but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But," said Marchmont, "there is the insuperable objection that, at the
  very time when this man was lying sick in Kennington Lane, Mr. Jeffrey was
  living at New Inn."</p>

  <p>"What evidence is there of that?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Evidence!" Marchmont exclaimed impatiently. "Why, my dear sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused suddenly, and, leaning forward, regarded Thorndyke with a new
  and rather startled expression.</p>

  <p>"You mean to suggest&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that Jeffrey Blackmore never lived at New Inn at all."</p>

  <p>For the moment, Marchmont seemed absolutely paralysed by astonishment.</p>

  <p>"This is an amazing proposition!" he exclaimed, at length. "Yet the thing
  is certainly not impossible, for, now that you recall the fact, I realize
  that no one who had known him previously&mdash;excepting his brother,
  John&mdash;ever saw him at the inn. The question of identity was never
  raised."</p>

  <p>"Excepting," said Mr. Winwood, "in regard to the body; which was certainly
  that of Jeffrey Blackmore."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. Of course," said Marchmont. "I had forgotten that for the
  moment. The body was identified beyond doubt. You don't dispute the identity
  of the body, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Winwood grasped his hair with both hands and stuck his elbows on
  his knees, while Marchmont drew forth a large handkerchief and mopped his
  forehead. Stephen Blackmore looked from one to the other expectantly, and
  finally said:</p>

  <p>"If I might make a suggestion, it would be that, as Dr. Thorndyke has
  shown us the pieces now of the puzzle, he should be so kind as to put them
  together for our information."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Marchmont, "that will be the best plan. Let us have the
  argument, Doctor, and any additional evidence that you possess."</p>

  <p>"The argument," said Thorndyke, "will be a rather long one, as the data
  are so numerous, and there are some points in verification on which I shall
  have to dwell in some detail. We will have some coffee to clear our brains,
  and then I will bespeak your patience for what may seem like a rather prolix
  demonstration."</p>

  <h2>XVI. &mdash; AN EXPOSITION AND A TRAGEDY</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU may have wondered," Thorndyke commenced, when he had
  poured out the coffee and handed round the cups, "what induced me to
  undertake the minute investigation of so apparently simple and
  straightforward a case. Perhaps I had better explain that first and let you
  see what was the real starting-point of the inquiry.</p>

  <p>"When you, Mr. Marchmont and Mr. Stephen, introduced the case to me, I
  made a very brief prcis of the facts as you presented them, and of these
  there were one or two which immediately attracted my attention. In the first
  place, there was the will. It was a very strange will. It was perfectly
  unnecessary. It contained no new matter; it expressed no changed intentions;
  it met no new circumstances, as known to the testator. In short it was not
  really a new will at all, but merely a repetition of the first one, drafted
  in different and less suitable language. It differed only in introducing a
  certain ambiguity from which the original was free. It created the
  possibility that, in certain circumstances, not known to or anticipated by
  the testator, John Blackmore might become the principal beneficiary, contrary
  to the obvious wishes of the testator.</p>

  <p>"The next point that impressed me was the manner of Mrs. Wilson's death.
  She died of cancer. Now people do not die suddenly and unexpectedly of
  cancer. This terrible disease stands almost alone in that it marks out its
  victim months in advance. A person who has an incurable cancer is a person
  whose death may be predicted with certainty and its date fixed within
  comparatively narrow limits.</p>

  <p>"And now observe the remarkable series of coincidences that are brought
  into light when we consider this peculiarity of the disease. Mrs. Wilson died
  on the twelfth of March of this present year. Mr. Jeffrey's second will was
  signed on the twelfth of November of last year; at a time, that is to say,
  when the existence of cancer must have been known to Mrs. Wilson's doctor,
  and might have been known to any of her relatives who chose to inquire after
  her.</p>

  <p>"Then you will observe that the remarkable change in Mr. Jeffrey's habits
  coincides in the most singular way with the same events. The cancer must have
  been detectable as early as September of last year; about the time, in fact,
  at which Mrs. Wilson made her will. Mr. Jeffrey went to the inn at the
  beginning of October. From that time his habits were totally changed, and I
  can demonstrate to you that a change&mdash;not a gradual, but an abrupt
  change&mdash;took place in the character of his signature.</p>

  <p>"In short, the whole of this peculiar set of curcumstances&mdash;the
  change in Jeffrey's habits, the change in his signature, and the execution of
  his strange will&mdash;came into existence about the time when Mrs. Wilson
  was first known to be suffering from cancer.</p>

  <p>"This struck me as a very suggestive fact.</p>

  <p>"Then there is the extraordinarily opportune date of Mr. Jeffrey's death.
  Mrs. Wilson died on the twelfth of March. Mr. Jeffrey was found dead on the
  fifteenth of March, having apparently died on the fourteenth, on which day he
  was seen alive. If he had died only three days sooner, he would have
  predeceased Mrs. Wilson, and her property would never have devolved on him at
  all; while, if he had lived only a day or two longer, he would have learned
  of her death and would certainly have made a new will or codicil in his
  nephew's favour.</p>

  <p>"Circumstances, therefore, conspired in the most singular manner in favour
  of John Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"But there is yet another coincidence. Jeffrey's body was found, by the
  merest chance, the day after his death. But it might have remained
  undiscovered for weeks, or even months; and if it had, it would have been
  impossible to fix the date of his death. Then Mrs. Wilson's next of kin would
  certainly have contested John Blackmore's claim&mdash;and probably with
  success&mdash;on the ground that Jeffrey died before Mrs. Wilson. But all
  this uncertainty is provided for by the circumstance that Mr. Jeffrey paid
  his rent personally&mdash;and prematurely&mdash;to the porter on the
  fourteenth of March, thus establishing beyond question the fact that he was
  alive on that date; and yet further, in case the porter's memory should be
  untrustworthy or his statement doubted, Jeffrey furnished a signed and dated
  document&mdash;the cheque&mdash;which could be produced in a court to furnish
  incontestable proof of survival.</p>

  <p>"To sum up this part of the evidence. Here was a will which enabled John
  Blackmore to inherit the fortune of a man who, almost certainly, had no
  intention of bequeathing it to him. The wording of that will seemed to be
  adjusted to the peculiarities of Mrs. Wilson's disease; and the death of the
  testator occurred under a peculiar set of circumstances which seemed to be
  exactly adjusted to the wording of the will. Or, to put it in another way:
  the wording of the will and the time, the manner and the circumstances of the
  testator's death, all seemed to be precisely adjusted to the fact that the
  approximate date of Mrs. Wilson's death was known some months before it
  occurred.</p>

  <p>"Now you must admit that this compound group of coincidences, all
  conspiring to a single end&mdash;the enrichment of John Blackmore&mdash;has a
  very singular appearance. Coincidences are common enough in real life; but we
  cannot accept too many at a time. My feeling was that there were too many in
  this case and that I could not accept them without searching inquiry."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke paused, and Mr. Marchmont, who had listened with close
  attention, nodded, as he glanced at his silent partner.</p>

  <p>"You have stated the case with remarkable clearness," he said; "and I am
  free to confess that some of the points that you have raised had escaped my
  notice."</p>

  <p>"My first idea," Thorndyke resumed, "was that John Blackmore, taking
  advantage of the mental enfeeblement produced by the opium habit, had
  dictated this will to Jeffrey, It was then that I sought permission to
  inspect Jeffrey's chambers; to learn what I could about him and to see for
  myself whether they presented the dirty and disorderly appearance
  characteristic of the regular opium-smoker's den. But when, during a walk
  into the City, I thought over the case, it seemed to me that this explanation
  hardly met the facts. Then I endeavoured to think of some other explanation;
  and looking over my notes I observed two points that seemed worth
  considering. One was that neither of the witnesses to the will was really
  acquainted with Jeffrey Blackmore; both being strangers who had accepted his
  identity on his own statement. The other was that no one who had previously
  known him, with the single exception of his brother John, had ever seen
  Jeffrey at the inn.</p>

  <p>"What was the import of these two facts? Probably they had none. But still
  they suggested the desirability of considering the question: Was the person
  who signed the will really Jeffrey Blackmore? The contrary
  supposition&mdash;that some one had personated Jeffrey and forged his
  signature to a false will&mdash;seemed wildly improbable, especially in view
  of the identification of the body; but it involved no actual impossibility;
  and it offered a complete explanation of the, otherwise inexplicable,
  coincidences that I have mentioned.</p>

  <p>"I did not, however, for a moment, think that this was the true
  explanation, but I resolved to bear it in mind, to test it when the
  opportunity arose, and consider it by the light of any fresh facts that I
  might acquire.</p>

  <p>"The new facts came sooner than I had expected. That same evening I went
  with Dr. Jervis to New Inn and found Mr. Stephen in the chambers. By him I
  was informed that Jeffrey was a learned Orientalist, with a quite expert
  knowledge of the cuneiform writing; and even as he was telling me this, I
  looked over his shoulder and saw a cuneiform inscription hanging on the wall
  upside down.</p>

  <p>"Now, of this there could be only one reasonable explanation. Disregarding
  the fact that no one would screw the suspension plates on a frame without
  ascertaining which was the right way up, and assuming it to be hung up
  inverted, it was impossible that the misplacement could have been overlooked
  by Jeffrey. He was not blind, though his sight was defective. The frame was
  thirty inches long and the individual characters nearly an inch in
  length&mdash;about the size of the D 18 letters of Snellen's test-types,
  which can be read by a person of ordinary sight at a distance of fifty-five
  feet. There was, I repeat, only one reasonable explanation; which was that
  the person who had inhabited those chambers was not Jeffrey Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"This conclusion received considerable support from a fact which I
  observed later, but mention in this place. On examining the soles of the
  shoes taken from the dead man's feet, I found only the ordinary mud of the
  streets. There was no trace of the peculiar gravelly mud that adhered to my
  own boots and Jervis's, and which came from the square of the inn. Yet the
  porter distinctly stated that the deceased, after paying the rent, walked
  back towards his chambers across the square; the mud of which should,
  therefore, have been conspicuous on his shoes.</p>

  <p>"Thus, in a moment, a wildly speculative hypothesis had assumed a high
  degree of probability.</p>

  <p>"When Mr. Stephen was gone, Jervis and I looked over the chambers
  thoroughly; and then another curious fact came to light. On the wall were a
  number of fine Japanese colour-prints, all of which showed recent damp-spots.
  Now, apart from the consideration that Jeffrey, who had been at the trouble
  and expense of collecting these valuable prints, would hardly have allowed
  them to rot on his walls, there arose the question: How came they to be damp?
  There was a gas stove in the room, and a gas stove has at least the virtue of
  preserving a dry atmosphere. It was winter weather, when the stove would
  naturally be pretty constantly alight. How came the walls to be so damp? The
  answer seemed to be that the stove had not been constantly alight, but had
  been lighted only occasionally. This suggestion was borne out by a further
  examination of the rooms. In the kitchen there were practically no stores and
  hardly any arrangements even for simple bachelor cooking; the bedroom offered
  the same suggestion; the soap in the wash-stand was shrivelled and cracked;
  there was no cast-off linen, and the shirts in the drawers, though clean, had
  the peculiar yellowish, faded appearance that linen acquires when long out of
  use. In short, the rooms had the appearance of not having been lived in at
  all, but only visited at intervals.</p>

  <p>"Against this view, however, was the statement of the night porter that he
  had often seen a light in Jeffrey's sitting-room at one o'clock in the
  morning, with the apparent implication that it was then turned out. Now a
  light may be left in an empty room, but its extinction implies the presence
  of some person to extinguish it; unless some automatic device be adopted for
  putting it out at a given time. Such a device&mdash;the alarm movement of a
  clock, for instance, with a suitable attachment&mdash;is a simple enough
  matter, but my search of the rooms failed to discover anything of the kind.
  However, when looking over the drawers in the bedroom, I came upon a large
  box that had held a considerable quantity of hard stearine candles. There
  were only a few left, but a flat candlestick with numerous wick-ends in its
  socket accounted for the remainder.</p>

  <p>"These candles seemed to dispose of the difficulty. They were not
  necessary for ordinary lighting, since gas was laid on in all three rooms.
  For what purpose, then, were they used, and in such considerable quantities?
  I subsequently obtained some of the same brand&mdash;Price's stearine
  candles, six to the pound&mdash;and experimented with them. Each candle was
  seven and a quarter inches in length, not counting the cone at the top, and I
  found that they burned in still air at the rate of a fraction over one inch
  in an hour. We may say that one of these candles would burn in still air a
  little over six hours. It would thus be possible for the person who inhabited
  these rooms to go away at seven o'clock in the evening and leave a light
  which would burn until past one in the morning and then extinguish itself.
  This, of course, was only surmise, but it destroyed the significance of the
  night porter's statement.</p>

  <p>"But, if the person who inhabited these chambers was not Jeffrey, who was
  he?</p>

  <p>"The answer to that question seemed plain enough. There was only one
  person who had a strong motive for perpetrating a fraud of this kind, and
  there was only one person to whom it was possible. If this person was not
  Jeffrey, he must have been very like Jeffrey; sufficiently like for the body
  of the one to be mistaken for the body of the other. For the production of
  Jeffrey's body was an essential part of the plan and must have been
  contemplated from the first. But the only person who fulfills the conditions
  is John Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"We have learned from Mr. Stephen that John and Jeffrey, though very
  different in appearance in later years, were much alike as young men. But
  when two brothers who are much alike as young men, become unlike in later
  life, we shall find that the unlikeness is produced by superficial
  differences and that the essential likeness remains. Thus, in the present
  case, Jeffrey was clean shaved, had bad eyesight, wore spectacles and stooped
  as he walked; John wore a beard and moustache, had good eyesight, did not
  wear spectacles and had a brisk gait and upright carriage. But supposing John
  to shave off his beard and moustache, to put on spectacles and to stoop in
  his walk, these conspicuous but superficial differences would vanish and the
  original likeness reappear.</p>

  <p>"There is another consideration. John had been an actor and was an actor
  of some experience. Now, any person can, with some care and practice, make up
  a disguise; the great difficulty is to support that disguise by a suitable
  manner and voice. But to an experienced actor this difficulty does not exist.
  To him, personation is easy; and, moreover, an actor is precisely the person
  to whom the idea of disguise and impersonation would occur.</p>

  <p>"There is a small item bearing on this point, so small as to be hardly
  worth calling evidence, but just worth noting. In the pocket of the waistcoat
  taken from the body of Jeffrey I found the stump of a 'Contango' pencil; a
  pencil that is sold for the use of stock dealers and brokers. Now John was an
  outside broker and might very probably have used such a pencil, whereas
  Jeffrey had no connection with the stock markets and there is no reason why
  he should have possessed a pencil of this kind. But the fact is merely
  suggestive; it has no evidential value.</p>

  <p>"A more important inference is to be drawn from the collected signatures.
  I have remarked that the change in the signature occurred abruptly, with one
  or two alterations of manner, last September, and that there are two distinct
  forms with no intermediate varieties. This is, in itself, remarkable and
  suspicious. But a remark made by Mr. Britton furnishes a really valuable
  piece of evidence on the point we are now considering. He admitted that the
  character of the signature had undergone a change, but observed that the
  change did not affect the individual or personal character of the writing.
  This is very important; for handwriting is, as it were, an extension of the
  personality of the writer. And just as a man to some extent snares his
  personality with his near blood-relations in the form of family resemblances,
  so his handwriting often shows a subtle likeness to that of his near
  relatives. You must have noticed, as I have, how commonly the handwriting of
  one brother resembles that of another, and in just this peculiar and subtle
  way. The inference, then, from Mr. Britton's statement is, that if the
  signature of the will was forged, it was probably forged by a relative of the
  deceased. But the only relative in question is his brother John.</p>

  <p>"All the facts, therefore, pointed to John Blackmore as the person who
  occupied these chambers, and I accordingly adopted that view as a working
  hypothesis."</p>

  <p>"But this was all pure speculation," objected Mr. Winwood.</p>

  <p>"Not speculation," said Thorndyke. "Hypothesis. It was ordinary inductive
  reasoning such as we employ in scientific research. I started with the purely
  tentative hypothesis that the person who signed the will was not Jeffrey
  Blackmore. I assumed this; and I may say that I did not believe it at the
  time, but merely adopted it as a proposition that was worth testing. I
  accordingly tested it, 'Yes?' or 'No?' with each new fact; but as each new
  fact said 'Yes,' and no fact said definitely 'No,' its probability increased
  rapidly by a sort of geometrical progression. The probabilities multiplied
  into one another. It is a perfectly sound method, for one knows that if a
  hypothesis be true, it will lead one, sooner or later, to a crucial fact by
  which its truth can be demonstrated.</p>

  <p>"To resume our argument. We have now set up the proposition that John
  Blackmore was the tenant of New Inn and that he was personating Jeffrey. Let
  us reason from this and see what it leads to.</p>

  <p>"If the tenant of New Inn was John, then Jeffrey must be elsewhere, since
  his concealment at the inn was clearly impossible. But he could not have been
  far away, for he had to be producible at short notice whenever the death of
  Mrs. Wilson should make the production of his body necessary. But if he was
  producible, his person must have been in the possession or control of John.
  He could not have been at large, for that would have involved the danger of
  his being seen and recognized. He could not have been in any institution or
  place where he would be in contact with strangers. Then he must be in some
  sort of confinement. But it is difficult to keep an adult in confinement in
  an ordinary house. Such a proceeding would involve great risk of discovery
  and the use of violence which would leave traces on the body, to be observed
  and commented on at the inquest. What alternative method could be
  suggested?</p>

  <p>"The most obvious method is that of keeping the prisoner in such a state
  of debility as would confine him to his bed. But such debility could be
  produced by only starvation, unsuitable food, or chronic poisoning. Of these
  alternatives, poisoning is much more exact, more calculable in its effect and
  more under control. The probabilities, then, were in favour of chronic
  poisoning.</p>

  <p>"Having reached this stage, I recalled a singular case which Jervis had
  mentioned to me and which seemed to illustrate this method. On our return
  home I asked him for further particulars, and he then gave me a very detailed
  description of the patient and the circumstances. The upshot was rather
  startling. I had looked on his case as merely illustrative, and wished to
  study it for the sake of the suggestions that it might offer. But when I had
  heard his account, I began to suspect that there was something more than mere
  parallelism of method. It began to look as if his patient, Mr. Graves, might
  actually be Jeffrey Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"The coincidences were remarkable. The general appearance of the patient
  tallied completely with Mr. Stephen's description of his uncle Jeffrey. The
  patient had a tremulous iris in his right eye and had clearly suffered from
  dislocation of the crystalline lens. But from Mr. Stephen's account of his
  uncle's sudden loss of sight in the right eye after a fall, I judged that
  Jeffrey had also suffered from dislocation of the lens and therefore had a
  tremulous iris in the right eye. The patient, Graves, evidently had defective
  vision in his left eye, as proved by the marks made behind his ears by the
  hooked side-bars of his spectacles; for it is only on spectacles that are
  intended for constant use that we find hooked side-bars. But Jeffrey had
  defective vision in his left eye and wore spectacles constantly. Lastly, the
  patient Graves was suffering from chronic morphine poisoning, and morphine
  was found in the body of Jeffrey.</p>

  <p>"Once more, it appeared to me that there were too many coincidences.</p>

  <p>"The question as to whether Graves and Jeffrey were identical admitted of
  fairly easy disproof; for if Graves was still alive, he could not be Jeffrey.
  It was an important question and I resolved to test it without delay. That
  night, Jervis and I plotted out the chart, and on the following morning we
  located the house. But it was empty and to let. The birds had flown, and we
  failed to discover whither they had gone.</p>

  <p>"However, we entered the house and explored. I have told you about the
  massive bolts and fastenings that we found on the bedroom doors and window,
  showing that the room had been used as a prison. I have told you of the
  objects that we picked out of the dust-heap under the grate. Of the obvious
  suggestion offered by the Japanese brush and the bottle of 'spirit gum' or
  cement, I need not speak now; but I must trouble you with some details
  concerning the broken spectacles. For here we had come upon the crucial fact
  to which, as I have said, all sound inductive reasoning brings one sooner or
  later.</p>

  <p>"The spectacles were of a rather peculiar pattern. The frames were of the
  type invented by Mr. Stopford of Moorfields and known by his name. The right
  eye-piece was fitted with plain glass, as is usual in the case of a blind, or
  useless, eye. It was very much shattered, but its character was obvious. The
  glass of the left eye was much thicker and fortunately less damaged, so that
  I was able accurately to test its refraction.</p>

  <p>"When I reached home, I laid the pieces of the spectacles together,
  measured the frames very carefully, tested the left eye-glass, and wrote down
  a full description such as would have been given by the surgeon to the
  spectacle-maker. Here it is, and I will ask you to note it carefully.</p>

  <p>"'Spectacles for constant use. Steel frame, Stopford's pattern, curl
  sides, broad bridge with gold lining. Distance between centres, 6.2
  centimetres; extreme length of side-bars, 13.3 centimetres.</p>

  <p>"'Right eye plain glass.</p>

  <table summary="eyeglass prescription">
    <tr>
      <td>"'Left eye</td>

      <td>-<u>5.75 D. spherical</u></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td></td>

      <td>-3.25 D. cylindrical, axis 35.'</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>"The spectacles, you see, were of a very distinctive character and seemed
  to offer a good chance of identification. Stopford's frames are, I believe,
  made by only one firm of opticians in London, Parry &amp; Cuxton of Regent
  Street. I therefore wrote to Mr. Cuxton, who knows me, asking him if he had
  supplied spectacles to the late Jeffrey Blackmore, Esq.&mdash;here is a copy
  of my letter&mdash;and if so, whether he would mind letting me have a full
  description of them, together with the name of the oculist who prescribed
  them.</p>

  <p>"He replied in this letter, which is pinned to the copy of mine, that,
  about four years ago, he supplied a pair of glasses to Mr. Jeffrey Blackmore,
  and described them thus: 'The spectacles were for constant use and had steel

  <p>"'The spectacles were prescribed by Mr. Hindley of Wimpole Street.'</p>

  <p>"You see that Mr. Cuxton's description is identical with mine. However,
  for further confirmation, I wrote to Mr. Hindley, asking certain questions,
  to which he replied thus:</p>

  <p>"'You are quite right. Mr. Jeffrey Blackmore had a tremulous iris in his
  right eye (which was practically blind), due to dislocation of the lens. The
  pupils were rather large; certainly not contracted.'</p>

  <p>"Here, then, we have three important facts. One is that the spectacles
  found by us at Kennington Lane were undoubtedly Jeffrey's; for it is as
  unlikely that there exists another pair of spectacles exactly identical with
  those as that there exists another face exactly like Jeffrey's face. The
  second fact is that the description of Jeffrey tallies completely with that
  of the sick man, Graves, as given by Dr. Jervis; and the third is that when
  Jeffrey was seen by Mr. Hindley, there was no sign of his being addicted to
  the taking of morphine. The first and second facts, you will agree,
  constitute complete identification."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marchmont; "I think we must admit the identification as being
  quite conclusive, though the evidence is of a kind that is more striking to
  the medical than to the legal mind."</p>

  <p>"You will not have that complaint to make against the next item of
  evidence," said Thorndyke. "It is after the lawyer's own heart, as you shall
  hear. A few days ago I wrote to Mr. Stephen asking him if he possessed a
  recent photograph of his uncle Jeffrey. He had one, and he sent it to me by
  return. This portrait I showed to Dr. Jervis and asked him if he had ever
  seen the person it represented. After examining it attentively, without any
  hint whatever from me, he identified it as the portrait of the sick man,
  Graves."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Marchmont. "This is most important. Are you prepared
  to swear to the identity, Dr. Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"I have not the slightest doubt," I replied, "that the portrait is that of
  Mr. Graves."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" said Marchmont, rubbing his hands gleefully; "this will be
  much more convincing to a jury. Pray go on, Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "completes the first part of my investigation. We
  had now reached a definite, demonstrable fact; and that fact, as you see,
  disposed at once of the main question&mdash;the genuineness of the will. For
  if the man at Kennington Lane was Jeffrey Blackmore, then the man at New Inn
  was not. But it was the latter who had signed the will. Therefore the will
  was not signed by Jeffrey Blackmore; that is to say, it was a forgery. The
  case was complete for the purposes of the civil proceedings; the rest of my
  investigations had reference to the criminal prosecution that was inevitable.
  Shall I proceed, or is your interest confined to the will?"</p>

  <p>"Hang the will!" exclaimed Stephen. "I want to hear how you propose to lay
  hands on the villain who murdered poor old uncle Jeffrey&mdash;for I suppose
  he did murder him?"</p>

  <p>"I think there is no doubt of it," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Marchmont, "we will hear the rest of the argument, if you
  please."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "As the evidence stands, we have proved that
  Jeffrey Blackmore was a prisoner in the house in Kennington Lane and that
  some one was personating him at New Inn. That some one, we have seen, was, in
  all probability, John Blackmore. We now have to consider the man Weiss. Who
  was he? and can we connect him in any way with New Inn?</p>

  <p>"We may note in passing that Weiss and the coachman were apparently one
  and the same person. They were never seen together. When Weiss was present,
  the coachman was not available even for so urgent a service as the obtaining
  of an antidote to the poison. Weiss always appeared some time after Jervis's
  arrival and disappeared some time before his departure, in each case
  sufficiently long to allow of a change of disguise. But we need not labour
  the point, as it is not of primary importance.</p>

  <p>"To return to Weiss. He was clearly heavily disguised, as we see by his
  unwillingness to show himself even by the light of a candle. But there is an
  item of positive evidence on this point which is important from having other
  bearings. It is furnished by the spectacles worn by Weiss, of which you have
  heard Jervis's description. These spectacles had very peculiar optical
  properties. When you looked <i>through</i> them they had the properties of
  plain glass; when you looked <i>at</i> them they had the appearance of
  lenses. But only one kind of glass possesses these properties; namely, that
  which, like an ordinary watch-glass, has curved, parallel surfaces. But for
  what purpose could a person wear 'watch-glass' spectacles? Clearly, not to
  assist his vision. The only alternative is disguise.</p>

  <p>"The properties of these spectacles introduce a very curious and
  interesting feature into the case. To the majority of persons, the wearing of
  spectacles for the purpose of disguise or personation, seems a perfectly
  simple and easy proceeding. But, to a person of normal eyesight, it is
  nothing of the kind. For, if he wears spectacles suited for long sight he
  cannot see distinctly through them at all; while, if he wears concave, or
  near sight, glasses, the effort to see through them produces such strain and
  fatigue that his eyes become disabled altogether. On the stage the difficulty
  is met by using spectacles of plain window-glass, but in real life this would
  hardly do; the 'property' spectacles would be detected at once and give rise
  to suspicion.</p>

  <p>"The personator is therefore in this dilemma: if he wears actual
  spectacles, he cannot see through them; if he wears sham spectacles of plain
  glass, his disguise will probably be detected. There is only one way out of
  the difficulty, and that not a very satisfactory one; but Mr. Weiss seems to
  have adopted it in lieu of a better. It is that of using watch-glass
  spectacles such as I have described.</p>

  <p>"Now, what do we learn from these very peculiar glasses? In the first
  place they confirm our opinion that Weiss was wearing a disguise. But, for
  use in a room so very dimly lighted, the ordinary stage spectacles would have
  answered quite well. The second inference is, then, that these spectacles
  were prepared to be worn under more trying conditions of light&mdash;out of
  doors, for instance. The third inference is that Weiss was a man with normal
  eyesight; for otherwise he could have worn real spectacles suited to the
  state of his vision.</p>

  <p>"These are inferences by the way, to which we may return. But these
  glasses furnish a much more important suggestion. On the floor of the bedroom
  at New Inn I found some fragments of glass which had been trodden on. By
  joining one or two of them together, we have been able to make out the
  general character of the object of which they formed parts. My
  assistant&mdash;who was formerly a watch-maker&mdash;judged that object to be
  the thin crystal glass of a lady's watch, and this, I think, was Jervis's
  opinion. But the small part which remains of the original edge furnishes
  proof in two respects that this was not a watch-glass. In the first place, on
  taking a careful tracing of this piece of the edge, I found that its curve
  was part of an ellipse; but watch-glasses, nowadays, are invariably circular.
  In the second place, watch-glasses are ground on the edge to a single bevel
  to snap into the bezel or frame; but the edge of this object was ground to a
  double bevel, like the edge of a spectacle-glass, which fits into a groove in
  the frame and is held by the side-bar screw. The inevitable inference was
  that this was a spectacle-glass. But, if so, it was part of a pair of
  spectacles identical in properties with those worn by Mr. Weiss.</p>

  <p>"The importance of this conclusion emerges when we consider the
  exceptional character of Mr. Weiss's spectacles. They were not merely
  peculiar or remarkable; they were probably unique. It is exceedingly likely
  that there is not in the entire world another similar pair of spectacles.
  Whence the finding of these fragments of glass in the bedroom establishes a
  considerable probability that Mr. Weiss was, at some time, in the chambers at
  New Inn.</p>

  <p>"And now let us gather up the threads of this part of the argument. We are
  inquiring into the identity of the man Weiss. Who was he?</p>

  <p>"In the first place, we find him committing a secret crime from which John
  Blackmore alone will benefit. This suggests the <i>prima-facie</i>
  probability that he was John Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"Then we find that he was a man of normal eyesight who was wearing
  spectacles for the purpose of disguise. But the tenant of New Inn, whom we
  have seen to be, almost certainly, John Blackmore&mdash;and whom we will, for
  the present, assume to have been John Blackmore&mdash;was a man with normal
  eyesight who wore spectacles for disguise.</p>

  <p>"John Blackmore did not reside at New Inn, but at some place within easy
  reach of it. But Weiss resided at a place within easy reach of New Inn.</p>

  <p>"John Blackmore must have had possession and control of the person of
  Jeffrey. But Weiss had possession and control of the person of Jeffrey.</p>

  <p>"Weiss wore spectacles of a certain peculiar and probably unique
  character. But portions of such spectacles were found in the chambers at New
  Inn.</p>

  <p>"The overwhelming probability, therefore, is that Weiss and the tenant of
  New Inn were one and the same person; and that that person was John
  Blackmore."</p>

  <p>"That," said Mr. Winwood, "is a very plausible argument. But, you observe,
  sir, that it contains an undistributed middle term."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled genially. I think he forgave Winwood everything for that
  remark.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, sir," he said. "It does. And, for that reason, the
  demonstration is not absolute. But we must not forget, what logicians seem
  occasionally to overlook: that the 'undistributed middle,' while it
  interferes with absolute proof, may be quite consistent with a degree of
  probability that approaches very near to certainty. Both the Bertillon system
  and the English fingerprint system involve a process of reasoning in which
  the middle term is undistributed. But the great probabilities are accepted in
  practice as equivalent to certainties."</p>

  <p>Mr. Winwood grunted a grudging assent, and Thorndyke resumed:</p>

  <p>"We have now furnished fairly conclusive evidence on three heads: we have
  proved that the sick man, Graves, was Jeffrey Blackmore; that the tenant of
  New Inn was John Blackmore; and that the man Weiss was also John Blackmore.
  We now have to prove that John and Jeffrey were together in the chambers at
  New Inn on the night of Jeffrey's death.</p>

  <p>"We know that two persons, and two persons only, came from Kennington Lane
  to New Inn. But one of those persons was the tenant of New Inn&mdash;that is,
  John Blackmore. Who was the other? Jeffrey is known by us to have been at
  Kennington Lane. His body was found on the following morning in the room at
  New Inn. No third person is known to have come from Kennington Lane; no third
  person is known to have arrived at New Inn. The inference, by exclusion, is
  that the second person&mdash;the woman&mdash;was Jeffrey.</p>

  <p>"Again; Jeffrey had to be brought from Kennington to the inn by John. But
  John was personating Jeffrey and was made up to resemble him very closely. If
  Jeffrey were undisguised the two men would be almost exactly alike; which
  would be very noticeable in any case and suspicious after the death of one of
  them. Therefore Jeffrey would have to be disguised in some way; and what
  disguise could be simpler and more effective than the one that I suggest was
  used?</p>

  <p>"Again; it was unavoidable that some one&mdash;the cabman&mdash;should
  know that Jeffrey was not alone when he came to the inn that night. If the
  fact had leaked out and it had become known that a man had accompanied him to
  his chambers, some suspicion might have arisen, and that suspicion would have
  pointed to John, who was directly interested in his brother's death. But if
  it had transpired that Jeffrey was accompanied by a woman, there would have
  been less suspicion, and that suspicion would not have pointed to John
  Blackmore.</p>

  <p>"Thus all the general probabilities are in favour of the hypothesis that
  this woman was Jeffrey Blackmore. There is, however, an item of positive
  evidence that strongly supports this view. When I examined the clothing of
  the deceased, I found on the trousers a horizontal crease on each leg as if
  the trousers had been turned up half-way to the knees. This appearance is
  quite understandable if we suppose that the trousers were worn under a skirt
  and were turned up so that they should not be accidentally seen. Otherwise it
  is quite incomprehensible."</p>

  <p>"Is it not rather strange," said Marchmont, "that Jeffrey should have
  allowed himself to be dressed up in this remarkable manner?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," replied Thorndyke. "There is no reason to suppose that he
  knew how he was dressed. You have heard Jervis's description of his
  condition; that of a mere automaton. You know that without his spectacles he
  was practically blind, and that he could not have worn them since we found
  them at the house in Kennington Lane. Probably his head was wrapped up in the
  veil, and the skirt and mantle put on afterwards; but, in any case, his
  condition rendered him practically devoid of will power. That is all the
  evidence I have to prove that the unknown woman was Jeffrey. It is not
  conclusive but it is convincing enough for our purpose, seeing that the case
  against John Blackmore does not depend upon it."</p>

  <p>"Your case against him is on the charge of murder, I presume?" said
  Stephen.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. And you will notice that the statements made by the supposed
  Jeffrey to the porter, hinting at suicide, are now important evidence. By the
  light of what we know, the announcement of intended suicide becomes the
  announcement of intended murder. It conclusively disproves what it was
  intended to prove; that Jeffrey died by his own hand."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," said Stephen, and then after a pause he asked: "Did you
  identify Mrs. Schallibaum? You have told us nothing about her."</p>

  <p>"I have considered her as being outside the case as far as I am
  concerned," replied Thorndyke. "She was an accessory; my business was with
  the principal. But, of course, she will be swept up in the net. The evidence
  that convicts John Blackmore will convict her. I have not troubled about her
  identity. If John Blackmore is married, she is probably his wife. Do you
  happen to know if he is married?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but Mrs. John Blackmore is not much like Mrs. Schallibaum, excepting
  that she has a cast in the left eye. She is a dark woman with very heavy
  eyebrows."</p>

  <p>"That is to say that she differs from Mrs. Schallibaum in those
  peculiarities that can be artificially changed and resembles her in the one
  feature that is unchangeable. Do you know if her Christian name happens to be
  Pauline?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. She was a Miss Pauline Hagenbeck, a member of an American
  theatrical company. What made you ask?"</p>

  <p>"The name which Jervis heard poor Jeffrey struggling to pronounce seemed
  to me to resemble Pauline more than any other name."</p>

  <p>"There is one little point that strikes me," said Marchmont. "Is it not
  rather remarkable that the porter should have noticed no difference between
  the body of Jeffrey and the living man whom he knew by sight, and who must,
  after all, have been distinctly different in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"I am glad you raised that question," Thorndyke replied, "for that very
  difficulty presented itself to me at the beginning of the case. But on
  thinking it over, I decided that it was an imaginary difficulty, assuming, as
  we do, that there was a good deal of resemblance between the two men. Put
  yourself in the porter's place and follow his mental processes. He is
  informed that a dead man is lying on the bed in Mr. Blackmore's rooms.
  Naturally, he assumes that the dead man is Mr. Blackmore&mdash;who, by the
  way, had hinted at suicide only the night before. With this idea he enters
  the chambers and sees a man a good deal like Mr. Blackmore and wearing Mr.
  Blackmore's clothes, lying on Mr. Blackmore's bed. The idea that the body
  could be that of some other person has never entered his mind. If he notes
  any difference of appearance he will put that down to the effects of death;
  for every one knows that a man dead looks somewhat different from the same
  man alive. I take it as evidence of great acuteness on the part of John
  Blackmore that he should have calculated so cleverly, not only the mental
  process of the porter, but the erroneous reasoning which every one would base
  on the porter's conclusions. For, since the body was actually Jeffrey's, and
  was identified by the porter as that of his tenant, it has been assumed by
  every one that no question was possible as to the identity of Jeffrey
  Blackmore and the tenant of New Inn."</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence, and then Marchmont asked:</p>

  <p>"May we take it that we have now heard all the evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "That is my case."</p>

  <p>"Have you given information to the police?" Stephen asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. As soon as I had obtained the statement of the cabman, Ridley, and
  felt that I had enough evidence to secure a conviction, I called at Scotland
  Yard and had an interview with the Assistant Commissioner. The case is in the
  hands of Superintendent Miller of the Criminal Investigation Department, a
  most acute and energetic officer. I have been expecting to hear that the
  warrant has been executed, for Mr. Miller is usually very punctilious in
  keeping me informed of the progress of the cases to which I introduce him. We
  shall hear to-morrow, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"And, for the present," said Marchmont, "the case seems to have passed out
  of our hands."</p>

  <p>"I shall enter a caveat, all the same," said Mr. Winwood.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem very necessary," Marchmont objected. "The evidence that
  we have heard is amply sufficient to ensure a conviction and there will be
  plenty more when the police go into the case. And a conviction on the charges
  of forgery and murder would, of course, invalidate the second will."</p>

  <p>"I shall enter a caveat, all the same," repeated Mr. Winwood.</p>

  <p>As the two partners showed a disposition to become heated over this
  question, Thorndyke suggested that they might discuss it at leisure by the
  light of subsequent events. Acting on this hint&mdash;for it was now close
  upon midnight&mdash;our visitors prepared to depart; and were, in fact, just
  making their way towards the door when the bell rang. Thorndyke flung open
  the door, and, as he recognized his visitor, greeted him with evident
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Mr. Miller; we were just speaking of you. These gentlemen are Mr.
  Stephen Blackmore and his solicitors, Mr. Marchmont and Mr. Winwood. You know
  Dr. Jervis, I think."</p>

  <p>The officer bowed to our friends and remarked:</p>

  <p>"I am just in time, it seems. A few minutes more and I should have missed
  these gentlemen. I don't know what you'll think of my news."</p>

  <p>"You haven't let that villain escape, I hope," Stephen exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Superintendent, "he is out of my hands and yours too; and
  so is the woman. Perhaps I had better tell you what has happened."</p>

  <p>"If you would be so kind," said Thorndyke, motioning the officer to a
  chair.</p>

  <p>The superintendent seated himself with the manner of a man who has had a
  long and strenuous day, and forthwith began his story.</p>

  <p>"As soon as we had your information, we procured a warrant for the arrest
  of both parties, and then I went straight to their flat with Inspector Badger
  and a sergeant. There we learned from the attendant that they were away from
  home and were not expected back until to-day about noon. We kept a watch on
  the premises, and this morning, about the time appointed, a man and a woman,
  answering to the description, arrived at the flat. We followed them in and
  saw them enter the lift, and we were going to get into the lift too, when the
  man pulled the rope, and away they went. There was nothing for us to do but
  run up the stairs, which we did as fast as we could race; but they got to
  their landing first, and we were only just in time to see them nip in and
  shut the door. However, it seemed that we had them safe enough, for there was
  no dropping out of the windows at that height; so we sent the sergeant to get
  a locksmith to pick the lock or force the door, while we kept on ringing the
  bell.</p>

  <p>"About three minutes after the sergeant left, I happened to look out of
  the landing window and saw a hansom pull up opposite the flats. I put my head
  out of the window, and, hang me if I didn't see our two friends getting into
  the cab. It seems that there was a small lift inside the flat communicating
  with the kitchen, and they had slipped down it one at a time.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, we raced down the stairs like acrobats, but by the time
  we got to the bottom the cab was off with a fine start. We ran out into
  Victoria Street, and there we could see it half-way down the street and going
  like a chariot race. We managed to pick up another hansom and told the cabby
  to keep the other one in sight, and away we went like the very deuce; along
  Victoria Street and Broad Sanctuary, across Parliament Square, over
  Westminster Bridge and along York Road; we kept the other beggar in sight,
  but we couldn't gain an inch on him. Then we turned into Waterloo Station,
  and, as we were driving up the slope we met another hansom coming down; and
  when the cabby kissed his hand and smiled at us, we guessed that he was the
  sportsman we had been following.</p>

  <p>"But there was no time to ask questions. It is an awkward station with a
  lot of different exits, and it looked a good deal as if our quarry had got
  away. However, I took a chance. I remembered that the Southampton express was
  due to start about this time, and I took a short cut across the lines and
  made for the platform that it starts from. Just as Badger and I got to the
  end, about thirty yards from the rear of the train, we saw a man and a woman
  running in front of us. Then the guard blew his whistle and the train began
  to move. The man and the woman managed to scramble into one of the rear
  compartments and Badger and I raced up the platform like mad. A porter tried
  to head us off, but Badger capsized him and we both sprinted harder than
  ever, and just hopped on the foot-board of the guard's van as the train began
  to get up speed. The guard couldn't risk putting us off, so he had to let us
  into his van, which suited us exactly, as we could watch the train on both
  sides from the look-out. And we did watch, I can tell you; for our friend in
  front had seen us. His head was out of the window as we climbed on to the
  foot-board.</p>

  <p>"However, nothing happened until we stopped at Southampton West. There, I
  need not say, we lost no time in hopping out, for we naturally expected our
  friends to make a rush for the exit. But they didn't. Badger watched the
  platform, and I kept a look-out to see that they didn't slip away across the
  line from the off-side. But still there was no sign of them. Then I walked up
  the train to the compartment which I had seen them enter. And there they
  were, apparently fast asleep in the corner by the off-side window, the man
  leaning back with his mouth open and the woman resting against him with her
  head on his shoulder. She gave me quite a turn when I went in to look at
  them, for she had her eyes half-closed and seemed to be looking round at me
  with a most horrible expression; but I found afterwards that the peculiar
  appearance of looking round was due to the cast in her eye."</p>

  <p>"They were dead, I suppose?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Stone dead; and I found these on the floor of the
  carriage."</p>

  <p>He held up two tiny yellow glass tubes, each labelled "Hypodermic
  tabloids. Aconitine Nitrate gr. 1/640."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Thorndyke, "this fellow was well up in alkaloidal poisons,
  it seems; and they appear to have gone about prepared for emergencies. These
  tubes each contained twenty tabloids, a thirty-second of a grain altogether,
  so we may assume that about twelve times the medicinal dose was swallowed.
  Death must have occurred in a few minutes, and a merciful death too."</p>

  <p>"A more merciful death than they deserved," exclaimed Stephen, "when one
  thinks of the misery and suffering that they inflicted on poor old uncle
  Jeffrey. I would sooner have had them hanged."</p>

  <p>"It's better as it is, sir," said Miller. "There is no need, now, to raise
  any questions in detail at the inquest. The publicity of a trial for murder
  would have been very unpleasant for you. I wish Dr. Jervis had given the tip
  to me instead of to that confounded, over-cautious&mdash;but there, I mustn't
  run down my brother officers: and it's easy to be wise after the event.</p>

  <p>"Good night, gentlemen. I suppose this accident disposes of your business
  as far as the will is concerned?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does," agreed Mr. Winwood. "But I shall enter a caveat, all
  the same."</p>
