<h2>I.</h2>

<p>The four children were lying on the grass.</p>

<p>"...and the Prince went further and further into the forest,"
said the elder girl, "till he came to a beautiful glade&mdash;a
glade, you know, is a place in the forest that is open and green
and lovely. And there he saw a lady, a beautiful lady, in a long
white dress that hung down to her ankles, with a golden belt and a
golden crown. She was lying on the sward&mdash;a sward, you know,
is grass as smooth as velvet, just like green velvet&mdash;and the
Prince saw the marks of travel on her garments. The bottom of the
lovely silk dress was all dirty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wondrous Fair, if you don't mind you'll make that sheet dirty,
too," said Pin.</p>

<p>"Shut up, will you!" answered her sister who, carried away by
her narrative, had approached her boots to some linen that was
bleaching.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you know Sarah'll be awfly cross if she has to wash it
again," said Pin, who was practical.</p>

<p>"You'll put me out altogether," cried Laura angrily. "Well, as I
said, the edge of her robe was all muddy&mdash;no, I don't think I
will say that; it sounds prettier if it's clean. So it hung in
long, straight beautiful folds to her ankles, and the Prince saw
two little feet in golden sandals peeping out from under the hem of
the silken gown, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what about the marks of travel?" asked Leppie.</p>

<p>"Donkey! haven't I said they weren't there? If I say they
weren't, then they weren't. She hadn't travelled at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, parrakeets!" cried little Frank.</p>

<p>Four pairs of eyes went up to the bright green flock that was
passing over the garden.</p>

<p>"Now you've all interrupted, and I shan't tell any more," said
Laura in a proud voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, please do, Wondrous Fair! Tell what happened next,"
begged Pin and Leppie.</p>

<p>"No, not another word. You can only think of sheets and
parrakeets."</p>

<p>"Please, Wondrous Fair," begged little Frank.</p>

<p>"No, I can't now. Another thing: I don't mind if you call me
Laura to-day, as it's the last day."</p>

<p>She lay back on the grass, her hands clasped under her head. A
voice was heard, loud, imperative.</p>

<p>"Laura, I want you. Come here."</p>

<p>"That's mother calling," said Pin.</p>

<p>Laura kicked her heels. The two little boys laughed
approval.</p>

<p>"Go on, Laura," coaxed Pin. "Mother'll be angry. I'll come,
too."</p>

<p>Laura raised herself with a grumble. "It's to try on that horrid
dress."</p>

<p>In very fact Mother was standing, already somewhat impatient,
with the dress in her hand. Laura wriggled out of the one she had
on, and stood stiffly and ungraciously, with her arms held like
pokers from her sides, while Mother on her knees arranged the
length.</p>

<p>"Don't put on a face like that, miss!" she said sharply on
seeing Laura's air. "Do you think I'm making it for my own
pleasure?" She had sewn at it all day, and was hot and tired.</p>

<p>"It's too short," said Laura, looking down.</p>

<p>"It's nothing of the kind," said Mother, with her mouth full of
pins.</p>

<p>"It is, it's much too short."</p>

<p>Mother gave her a slight shake. "Don't you contradict <i>me</i>!
Do you want to tell me I don't know what length you're to wear your
dresses?"</p>

<p>"I won't wear it at all if you don't make it longer," said Laura
defiantly.</p>

<p>Pin's chubby, featureless little face lengthened with
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Do let her have it just a tiny bit longer, mother dear, dear!"
she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Now, Pin, what have you got to do with it I'd like to know!"
said Mother, on the verge of losing her temper over the back folds,
which <i>would</i> not hang.</p>

<p>"I'm going to school to-morrow, and it's a shame," said Laura in
the low, passionate tone that never failed to exasperate Mother, so
different was it from her own hearty fashion of venting
displeasure. Pin began to sniff, in sheer nervous anxiety.</p>

<p>"Very well then, I won't do another stitch to it!" and Mother,
now angry in earnest, got up and bounced out of the room.</p>

<p>"Laura, how can you?" said Pin, dissolving. "It's only you who
make her so cross."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Laura rebelliously, though she was not far
off tears herself. "It <i>is</i> a shame. All the other girls will
have dresses down to the tops of their boots, and they'll laugh at
me, and call me a baby;" and touched by the thought of what lay
before her, she, too, began to sniffle. She did not fail, however,
to roll the dress up and to throw it unto a corner of the room. She
also kicked the ewer, which fell over and flooded the floor. Pin
cried more loudly, and ran to fetch Sarah.</p>

<p>Laura returned to the garden. The two little boys came up to
her; but she waved them back.</p>

<p>"Let me alone, children. I want to think."</p>

<p>She stood in a becoming attitude by the garden-gate, her
brothers hovering in the background. Then Mother called once
more.</p>

<p>"Laura, where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here, mother. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Did you knock this jug over or did Pin?"</p>

<p>"I did, mother."</p>

<p>"Did you do it on purpose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Come here to me."</p>

<p>She went, with lagging steps. But Mother's anger had passed: she
was at work on the dress again, and by squinting her eyes Laura
could see that a piece was being added to the skirt. She was
penitent at once; and when Mother in a sorry voice said: "I'm
ashamed of you, Laura. And on your last day, too," her throat grew
narrow.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it, mother."</p>

<p>"If only you would ask properly for things, you would get
them."</p>

<p>Laura knew this; knew indeed that, did she coax, Mother could
refuse her nothing. But coaxing came hard to her; something within
her forbade it. Sarah called her "high-stomached", to the delight
of the other children and her own indignation; she had explained to
them again and again what Sarah really meant.</p>

<p>On leaving the house she went straight to the flower-beds: she
would give Mother, who liked flowers very well but had no time to
gather them, a bouquet the size of a cabbage. Pin and the boys were
summoned to help her, and when their hands were full, Laura led the
way to a secluded part of the garden on the farther side of the
detached brick kitchen. In this strip, which was filled with
greenery, little sun fell: two thick fir trees and a monstrous
blue-gum stood there; high bushes screened the fence; jessamine
climbed the wall of the house and encircled the bedroom windows;
and on the damp and shady ground only violets grew. Yet, with the
love children bear to the limited and compact, the four had chosen
their own little plots here rather than in the big garden at the
back of the house; and many were the times they had all begun anew
to dig and to rake. But if Laura's energy did not fizzle out as
quickly as usual&mdash;she was the model for the rest&mdash;Mother
was sure to discover that it was too cramped and dark for them in
there, and send Sarah to drive them off.</p>

<p>Here, safely screened from sight, Laura sat on a bench and made
up her bouquet. When it was finished&mdash;red and white in the
centre with a darker border, the whole surrounded by a ring of
violet leaves&mdash;she looked about for something to tie it up
with. Sarah, applied to, was busy ironing, and had no string in the
kitchen, so Pin ran to get a reel of cotton. But while she was away
Laura had an idea. Bidding Leppie hold the flowers tight in both
his sticky little hands, she climbed in at her bedroom window, or
rather, by lying on the sill with her legs waving in the air, she
managed to grab, without losing her balance, a pair of scissors
from the chest of drawers. With these between her teeth she
emerged, to the excited interest of the boys who watched her
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Laura had dark curls, Pin fair, and both wore them flapping at
their backs, the only difference being that Laura, who was now
twelve years old, had for the past year been allowed to bind hers
together with a ribbon, while Pin's bobbed as they chose. Every
morning early, Mother brushed and twisted, with a kind of grim
pride, these silky ringlets round her finger. Although the five odd
minutes the curling occupied were durance vile to Laura, the child
was proud of her hair in her own way; and when in the street she
heard some one say: "Look&mdash;what pretty curls!" she would give
her head a toss and send them all a-rippling. In addition to this,
there was a crowning glory connected with them: one hot December
morning, when they had been tangled and Mother had kept her
standing too long, she had fainted, pulling the whole
dressing-table down about her ears; and ever since, she had been
marked off in some mysterious fashion from the other children.
Mother would not let her go out at midday in summer: Sarah would
say: "Let that be, can't you!" did she try to lift something that
was too heavy for her; and the younger children were to be quelled
by a threat to faint on the spot, if they did not do as she wished.
"Laura's faint" had become a byword in the family; and Laura
herself held it for so important a fact in her life that she had
more than once begun a friendship with the words: "Have you ever
fainted? I have."</p>

<p>From among these long, glossy curls, she now cut one of the
longest and most spiral, cut it off close to the root, and with it
bound the flowers together. Mother should see that she did know how
to give up something she cared for, and was not as selfish as she
was usually supposed to be.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h!" said both little boys in a breath, then
doubled up in noisy mirth. Laura was constantly doing something to
set their young blood in amazement: they looked upon her as the
personification of all that was startling and unexpected. But Pin,
returning with the reel of thread, opened her eyes in a different
way.</p>

<p>"Oh, Laura...!" she began, tearful at once.</p>

<p>"Now, res'vor!" retorted Laura scornfully&mdash;"res'vor" was
Sarah's name for Pin, on account of her perpetual wateriness. "Be a
cry-baby, do." But she was not damped, she was lost in the pleasure
of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Pin looked after her as she danced off, then moved submissively
in her wake to be near at hand should intercession be needed. Laura
was so unsuspecting, and Mother would be so cross. In her dim,
childish way Pin longed to see these, her two nearest, at peace;
she understood them both so well, and they had little or no
understanding for each other. So she crept to the house at her
sister's heels.</p>

<p>Laura did not go indoors; hiding against the wall of the flagged
verandah, she threw her bouquet in at the window, meaning it to
fall on Mother's lap.</p>

<p>But Mother had dropped her needle, and was just lifting her
face, flushed with stooping, when the flowers hit her a thwack on
the head. She groped again, impatiently, to find what had struck
her, recognised the peace-offering, and thought of the surprise
cake that was to go into Laura's box on the morrow. Then she saw
the curl, and her face darkened. Was there ever such a tiresome
child? What in all the world would she do next?</p>

<p>"Laura, come here, directly!"</p>

<p>Laura had moved away; she was not expecting recognition. If
Mother were pleased she would call Pin to put the flowers in water
for her, and that would be the end of it. The idea of a word of
thanks would have made Laura feel uncomfortable. Now, however, at
the tone of Mother's voice, her mouth set stubbornly. She went
indoors as bidden, but was already up in arms again.</p>

<p>"You're a very naughty girl indeed!" began Mother as soon she
appeared. "How dare you cut off your hair? Upon my word, if it
weren't your last night I'd send you to bed without any
supper!"&mdash;an unheard-of threat on the part of Mother, who
punished her children in any way but that of denying them their
food. "It's a very good thing you're leaving home to-morrow, for
you'd soon be setting the others at defiance, too, and I should
have four naughty children on my hands instead of one. But I'd be
ashamed to go to school such a fright if I were you. Turn round at
once and let me see you!"</p>

<p>Laura turned, with a sinking heart. Pin cried softly in a
corner.</p>

<p>"She thought it would please you, mother," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> not have you interfering, Pin, when I'm speaking
to Laura. She's old enough by now to know what I like and what I
don't," said Mother, who was vexed at the thought of the child
going among strangers thus disfigured. "And now get away, and don't
let me see you again. You're a perfect sight."</p>

<p>"Oh, Laura, you do look funny!" said Leppie and Frank in weak
chorus, as she passed them in the passage.</p>

<p>"Well, you 'ave made a guy of yourself this time, Miss Laura,
and no mistake!" said Sarah, who had heard the above.</p>

<p>Laura went into her own room and locked the door, a thing Mother
did not allow. Then she threw herself on the bed and cried. Mother
had not understood in the least; and she had made herself a sight
into the bargain. She refused to open the door, though one after
another rattled the handle, and Sarah threatened to turn the hose
in at the window. So they left her alone, and she spent the evening
in watery dudgeon on her pillow. But before she undressed for the
night she stealthily made a chink and took in the slice of cake Pin
had left on the door-mat. Her natural buoyancy of spirit was
beginning to reassert itself. By brushing her hair well to one side
she could cover up the gap, she found; and after all, there was
something rather pleasant in knowing that you were misunderstood.
It made you feel different from everyone else.</p>

<p>Mother&mdash;sewing hard after even the busy Sarah had
retired&mdash;Mother smiled a stern little smile of amusement to
herself; and before locking up for the night put the dark curl
safely away.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>Laura, sleeping flat on her stomach, was roused next morning by
Pin who said:</p>

<p>"Wake up, Wondrous Fair, mother wants to speak to you. She says
you can get into bed in my place, before you dress." Pin slept warm
and cosy at Mother's side.</p>

<p>Laura rose on her elbow and looked at her sister: Pin was
standing in the doorway holding her nightgown to her, in such a way
as to expose all of her thin little legs.</p>

<p>"Come on," urged Pin. "Sarah's going to give me my bath while
you're with mother."</p>

<p>"Go away, Pin," said Laura snappily. "I told you yesterday you
could say Laura, and...and you're more like a spider than
ever."</p>

<p>"Spider" was another nickname for Pin, owed to her rotund little
body and mere sticks of legs&mdash;she was "all belly" as Sarah put
it&mdash;and the mere mention of it made Pin fly; for she was very
touchy about her legs.</p>

<p>As soon as the door closed behind her, Laura sprang out of bed
and, waiting neither to wash herself nor to say her prayers, began
to pull on her clothes, confusing strings and buttons in her haste,
and quite forgetting that on this eventful morning she had meant to
dress herself with more than ordinary care. She was just lacing her
shoes when Sarah looked in.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Laura, don't you know your ma wants you?"</p>

<p>"It's too late. I'm dressed now," said Laura darkly.</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head. "Missis'll be fine an' angry. An' you
needn't 'ave 'ad a row on your last day."</p>

<p>Laura stole out of the door and ran down the garden to the
summer-house. This, the size of a goodly room, was formed of a
single dense, hairy-leafed tree, round the trunk of which a seat
was built. Here she cowered, her elbows on her knees, her chin in
her hands. Her face wore the stiff expression that went by the name
of "Laura's sulks," but her eyes were big, and as watchful as those
of a scared animal. If Sarah came to fetch her she would hold on to
the seat with both hands. But even if she had to yield to Sarah's
greater strength&mdash;well, at least she was up and dressed. Not
like the last time&mdash;about a week ago Mother had tried this
kind of thing. Then, she had been caught unawares. She had gone
into Pin's warm place, curious and unsuspecting, and thereupon
Mother had begun to talk seriously to her, and not with her usual
directness. She had reminded Laura that she was growing up apace
and would soon be a woman; had told her that she must now begin to
give up childish habits, and learn to behave in a modest and
womanly way&mdash;all disagreeable, disturbing things, which Laura
did not in the least want to hear. When it became clear to her what
it was about, she had thrown back the bedclothes and escaped from
the room. And since then she had been careful never to be long
alone with Mother.</p>

<p>But now half an hour went by and no one came to fetch her: her
grim little face relaxed. She felt very hungry, too, and when at
length she heard Pin calling, she jumped up and betrayed her
hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Laura! Laura, where are you? Mother says to come to breakfast
and not be silly. The coach'll be here in an hour."</p>

<p>Taking hands the sisters ran to the house.</p>

<p>In the passage, Sarah was busy roping a battered tin box. With
their own hands the little boys had been allowed to paste on this a
big sheet of notepaper, which bore, in Mother's writing, the
words:</p>

<blockquote>Miss Laura Tweedle Rambotham<br>
The Ladies' College<br>
Melbourne.</blockquote>

<p>Mother herself was standing at the breakfast-table cutting
sandwiches.</p>

<p>"Come and eat your breakfast, child," was all she said at the
moment. "The tea's quite cold."</p>

<p>Laura sat down and fell to with appetite, but also with a
side-glance at the generous pile of bread and meat growing under
Mother's hands.</p>

<p>"I shall never eat all that," she said ungraciously; it galled
her still to be considered a greedy child with an insatiable
stomach.</p>

<p>"I know better than you do what you'll eat," said Mother.
"You'll be hungry enough by this evening I can tell you, not
getting any dinner."</p>

<p>Pin's face fell at this prospect. "Oh, mother, won't she really
get any dinner?" she asked: and to her soft little heart going to
school began to seem one of the blackest experiences life held.</p>

<p>"Why, she'll be in the train, stupid, 'ow can she?" said Sarah.
"Do you think trains give you dinners?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, please cut ever such a lot!" begged Pin sniffing
valiantly.</p>

<p>Laura began to feel somewhat moved herself at this solicitude,
and choked down a lump in her throat with a gulp of tea. But when
Pin had gone with Sarah to pick some nectarines, Mother's face grew
stern, and Laura's emotion passed.</p>

<p>"I feel more troubled about you than I can say, Laura. I don't
know how you'll ever get on in life&mdash;you're so disobedient and
self-willed. It would serve you very well right, I'm sure, for not
coming this morning, if I didn't give you a penny of pocket-money
to take to school."</p>

<p>Laura had heard this threat before, and thought it wiser not to
reply. Gobbling up the rest of her breakfast she slipped away.</p>

<p>With the other children at her heels she made a round of the
garden, bidding good-bye to things and places. There were the two
summer-houses in which she had played house; in which she had
cooked and eaten and slept. There was the tall fir-tree with the
rung-like branches by which she had been accustomed to climb to the
very tree-top; there was the wilderness of bamboo and cane where
she had been Crusoe; the ancient, broadleaved cactus on which she
had scratched their names and drawn their portraits; here, the high
aloe that had such a mysterious charm for you, because you never
knew when the hundred years might expire and the aloe burst into
flower. Here again was the old fig tree with the rounded, polished
boughs, from which, seated as in a cradle, she had played Juliet to
Pin's Romeo, and vice versa&mdash;but oftenest Juliet: for though
Laura greatly preferred to be the ardent lover at the foot, Pin was
but a poor climber, and, as she clung trembling to her branch,
needed so much prompting in her lines&mdash;even then to repeat
them with such feeble emphasis&mdash;that Laura invariably lost
patience with her and the love-scene ended in a squabble. Passing
behind a wooden fence which was a tangle of passion-flower, she
opened the door of the fowl-house, and out strutted the mother-hen
followed by her pretty brood. Laura had given each of the chicks a
name, and she now took Napoleon and Garibaldi up in her hand and
laid her cheek against their downy breasts, the younger children
following her movements in respectful silence. Between the bars of
the rabbit hutch she thrust enough greenstuff to last the two
little occupants for days; and everywhere she went she was
accompanied by a legless magpie, which, in spite of its infirmity,
hopped cheerily and quickly on its stumps. Laura had rescued it and
reared it; it followed her like a dog; and she was only less
devoted to it than she had been to a native bear which died under
her hands.</p>

<p>"Now listen, children," she said as she rose from her knees
before the hutch. "If you don't look well after Maggy and the
bunnies, I don't know what I'll do. The chicks'll be all right.
Sarah'll take care of them, 'cause of the eggs. But Maggy and the
bunnies don't have eggs, and if they're not fed, or if Frank treads
on Maggy again, then they'll die. Now if you let them die, I don't
know what I'll do to you! Yes, I do: I'll send the devil to you at
night when the room's dark, before you go to sleep. So there!"</p>

<p>"How can you if you're not here?" asked Leppie.</p>

<p>Pin, however, who believed in ghosts and apparitions with all
her fearful little heart, promised tremulously never, never to
forget; but Laura was not satisfied until each of them in turn had
repeated, in a low voice, with the appropriate gestures, the sacred
secret, and forbidden formula:</p>

<blockquote>Is my finger wet?<br>
Is my finger dry?<br>
God'll strike me dead,<br>
If I tell a lie.</blockquote>

<p>Then Sarah's voice was heard calling, and the boys went out into
the road to watch for the coach. Laura's dressing proved a lengthy
business, and was accomplished amid bustle, and scolding, and
little peace-making words from Pin; for in her hurry that morning
Laura had forgotten to put on the clean linen Mother had laid
beside the bed, and consequently had now to strip to the skin.</p>

<p>The boys announced the coming of the coach with shrill cries,
and simultaneously the rumble of wheels was heard. Sarah came from
the kitchen drying her hands, and Pin began to cry.</p>

<p>"Now, shut up, res'vor!" said Sarah roughly: her own eyes were
moist. "You don't see Miss Laura be such a silly-billy. Anyone 'ud
think you was goin', not 'er."</p>

<p>The ramshackle old vehicle, one of Cobb's Royal Mail Coaches,
big-bodied, lumbering, scarlet, pulled by two stout horses, drew up
before the door, and the driver climbed down from his seat.</p>

<p>"Now good day to you, ma'am, good day, miss"&mdash;this to Sarah
who, picking up the box, handed it to him to be strapped on under
the apron. "Well, well, and so the little girl's goin' to school,
is she? My, but time flies! Well do I remember the day ma'am, when
I drove you all across for the first time. These children wasn't
big enough then to git up and down be thimselves. Now I warrant you
they can&mdash;just look at 'em, will you?&mdash;But my! Ain't you
ashamed of yourself"&mdash;he spoke to Pin&mdash;"pipin' your eye
like that? Why, you'll flood the road if you don't hould on. Yes,
yes, ma'am, bless you, I'll look after her, and put her inter the
train wid me own han's. Don't you be oneasy. The Lord he cares for
the widder and the orphun, and if He don't, why Patrick O'Donnell
does."</p>

<p>This was O'Donnell's standing joke; he uttered it with a loud
chuckle. While speaking he had let down the steps and helped the
three children up&mdash;they were to ride with Laura to the
outskirts of the township. The little boys giggled excitedly at his
assertion that the horses would not be equal to the weight. Only
Pin wept on, in undiminished grief.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Laura."</p>

<p>"Now, Laura. Good-bye, darling. And do try and be good. And be
sure you write once a week. And tell me everything. Whether you are
happy&mdash;and if you get enough to eat&mdash;and if you have
enough blankets on your bed. And remember always to change your
boots if you get your feet wet. And don't lean out of the window in
the train."</p>

<p>For some time past Laura had had need of all her self-control,
not to cry before the children. As the hour drew near it had grown
harder and harder; while dressing, she had resorted to counting the
number of times the profile of a Roman emperor appeared in the
flowers on the wallpaper. Now the worst moment of all was
come&mdash;the moment of good-bye. She did not look at Pin, but she
heard her tireless, snuffly weeping, and set her own lips
tight.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother...no, mother," she answered shortly, "I'll be all
right. Good-bye." She could not, however, restrain a kind of dry
sob, which jumped up her throat.</p>

<p>When she was in the coach Sarah, whom she had forgotten climbed
up to kiss her; and there was some joking between O'Donnell and the
servant while the steps were being folded and put away. Laura did
not smile; her thin little face was very pale. Mother's heart went
out to her in a pity which she did not know how to express.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your sandwiches. And when you're alone, feel in
the pocket of your ulster and you'll find something nice. Good-bye,
darling."</p>

<p>"Good-bye...good-bye."</p>

<p>The driver had mounted to his seat, he unwound the reins cried
"Get up!" to the two burly horses, the vehicle was set in motion
and trundled down the main street. Until it turned the corner by
the Shire Gardens, Laura let her handkerchief fly from the window.
Sarah waved hers; then wiped her eyes and lustily blew her nose.
Mother only sighed.</p>

<p>"It was all she could do to keep up," she said as much to
herself as to Sarah. "I do hope she'll be all right. She seems such
a child to be sending off like this. Yet what else could I do? To a
State School, I've always said it, my children shall never
go&mdash;not if I have to beg the money to send them
elsewhere."</p>

<p>But she sighed again, in spite of the energy of her words, and
stood gazing at the place where the coach had disappeared. She was
still a comparatively young woman, and straight of body; but
trouble, poverty and night-watches had scored many lines on her
forehead.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," said Sarah. "Miss Laura'll be all right.
She's just a bit too clever&mdash;brains for two, that's what it
is. An' children <i>will</i> grow up an' get big...an' change their
feathers." She spoke absently, drawing her metaphor from a brood of
chickens which had strayed across the road, and was now trying to
mount the wooden verandah&mdash;"Shooh! Get away with you!"</p>

<p>"I know that. But Laura&mdash;The other children have never
given me a moment's worry. But Laura's different. I seem to get
less and less able to manage her. If only her father had been alive
to help!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure no father livin' could do more than you for those
blessed children," said Sarah with impatience. "You think of
nothin' else. It 'ud be a great deal better if you took more care
o' yourself. You sit up nights an' don't get no proper sleep
slavin' away at that blessed embroid'ry an' stuff, so as Miss Laura
can get off to school an' to 'er books. An' then you want to worry
over 'er as well. She'll be all right. Miss Laura's like peas.
You've got to get 'em outer the pod&mdash;they're in there sure
enough. An' b'sides I guess school'll knock all the nonsense out of
'er."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope they won't be too hard on her," said Mother in quick
alarm. "Shut the side gate, will you. Those children have left it
open again. And, Sarah, I think we'll turn out the
drawing-room."</p>

<p>Sarah grunted to herself as she went to close the gate. This had
not entered into her scheme of work for the day, and her cooking
was still undone. But she did not gainsay her mistress, as she
otherwise would have made no scruple of doing; for she knew that
nothing was more helpful to the latter in a crisis than hard,
manual work. Besides, Sarah herself had a sneaking weakness for
what she called "dra'in'-room days". For the drawing-room was the
storehouse of what treasures had remained over from a past
prosperity. It was crowded with bric-a-brac and ornament; and as
her mistress took these objects up one by one, to dust and polish
them, she would, if she were in a good humour, tell Sarah where and
how they had been bought, or describe the places they had
originally come from: so that Sarah, pausing broom in hand to
listen, had with time gathered some vague ideas of a country like
"Inja", for example, whence came the little silver "pagody", and
the expressionless brass god who squatted vacantly and at ease.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>As long as the coach rolled down the main street Laura sat bolt
upright at the window. In fancy she heard people telling one
another that this was little Miss Rambotham going to school. She
was particularly glad that just as they went past the Commercial
Hotel, Miss Perrotet, the landlord's red-haired daughter, should
put her fuzzy head out of the window&mdash;for Miss Perrotet had
also been to boarding-school, and thought very highly of herself in
consequence, though it had only been for a year, to finish. At the
National Bank the manager's wife waved a friendly hand to the
children, and at the Royal Mail Hotel where they drew up for
passengers or commissions, Mrs. Paget, the stout landlady, came
out, smoothing down her black satin apron.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I wonder your ma likes sendin' you off so
alone."</p>

<p>The ride had comforted Pin a little; but when they had passed
the chief stores and the flour-mill, and were come to a part of the
road where the houses were fewer, her tears broke out afresh. The
very last house was left behind, the high machinery of the claims
came into view, the watery flats where Chinamen were for ever
rocking washdirt in cradles; and O'Donnell dismounted and opened
the door. He lifted the three out one by one, shaking his head in
humorous dismay at Pin, and as little Frank showed sighs of
beginning, too, by puckering up his face and doubling up his body,
the kindly man tried to make them laugh by asking if he had the
stomach-ache. Laura had one more glimpse of the children standing
hand in hand&mdash;even in her trouble Pin did not forget her
charges&mdash;then a sharp bend in the road hid them from her
sight.</p>

<p>She was alone in the capacious body of the coach, alone, and the
proud excitement of parting was over. The staunchly repressed tears
welled up with a gush, and flinging herself down across the seat
she cried bitterly. It was not a childishly irresponsible grief
like Pin's: it was more passionate, and went deeper; and her
overloaded feelings were soon relieved. But as she was not used to
crying, she missed the moment at which she might have checked
herself, and went on shedding tears after they had become a
luxury.</p>

<p>"Why, goodness gracious, what's this?" cried a loud, cheerful
and astonished voice, and a fat, rosy face beamed in on Laura.
"Why, here's a little girl in here, cryin' fit to break 'er heart.
Come, come, my dear, what's the matter? Don't cry like that, now
don't."</p>

<p>The coach had stopped, the door opened and a stout woman climbed
in, bearing a big basket, and followed by a young man with
straw-coloured whiskers. Laura sat up like a dart and pulled her
hat straight, crimson with mortification at being discovered in
such a plight. She had instantly curbed her tears, but she could
not disguise the fact that she had red eyes and a swollen
nose&mdash;that she was in short what Sarah called "all bunged up".
She made no reply to the newcomer's exclamations, but sat clutching
her handkerchief and staring out of the window. The woman's
good-natured curiosity, however, was not to be done.</p>

<p>"You poor little thing, you!" she persisted. "Wherever are you
goin', my dear, so alone?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to boarding-school," said Laura, and shot a glance at
the couple opposite.</p>

<p>"To boardin'-school? Peter! D'you hear?&mdash;Why, whatever's
your ma thinkin' of to send such a little chick as you to
boardin'-school?...and so alone, too."</p>

<p>Laura's face took on a curious air of dignity.</p>

<p>"I'm not so very little," she answered; and went on to explain,
in phrases which she had heard so often that she knew them by
heart: "Only small for my age. I was twelve in spring. And I have
to go to school, because I've learnt all I can at home."</p>

<p>This failed to impress the woman.</p>

<p>"Snakes alive!&mdash;that's young enough in all conscience. And
such a delicate little creature, too. Just like that one o' Sam
MacFarlane's that popped off last Christmas&mdash;isn't she,
Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter, who avoided looking at Laura, sheepishly mumbled
something about like enough she was.</p>

<p>"And who <i>is</i> your ma, my dear? What's your name?"
continued her interrogator.</p>

<p>Laura replied politely; but there was a reserve in her manner
which, together with the name she gave, told enough: the widow,
Laura's mother, had the reputation of being very "stuck-up", and of
bringing up her children in the same way.</p>

<p>The woman did not press Laura further; she whispered something
behind her hand to Peter, then searching in her basket found a
large, red apple, which she held out with an encouraging nod and
smile.</p>

<p>"Here, my dear. Here's something for you. Don't cry any more,
don't now. It'll be all right."</p>

<p>Laura, who was well aware that she had not shed a tear since the
couple entered the coach, coloured deeply, and made a movement,
half shy, half unwilling, to put her hands behind her.</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you," she said in extreme embarrassment, not
wishing to hurt the giver's feelings. "Mother doesn't care for us
to take things from strangers."</p>

<p>"Bless her soul!" cried the stout woman in amaze. "It's only an
apple! Now, my dear, just you take it, and make your mind easy.
Your ma wouldn't have nothin' against it to-day, I'm sure o'
that&mdash;goin' away so far and all so alone like this. It's sweet
and juicy."</p>

<p>"It's Melb'm you'll be boun' for I dessay?" said the
yellow-haired Peter so suddenly that Laura started.</p>

<p>She confirmed this, and let her solemn eyes rest on him
wondering why he was so red and fidgety and uncomfortable. The
woman said: "Tch, tch, tch!" at the length of the journey Laura was
undertaking, and Peter, growing still redder, volunteered another
remark.</p>

<p>"I was nigh to bein' in Melb'm once meself," he said.</p>

<p>"Aye, and he can't never forget it, the silly loon," threw in
the woman, but so good-naturedly that it was impossible, Laura
felt, for Peter to take offence.</p>

<p>She gazed at the pair, speculating upon the relation they stood
in to each other. She had obediently put out her hand for the
apple, and now sat holding it, without attempting to eat it. It had
not been Mother's precepts alone that had weighed with her in
declining it; she was mortified at the idea of being bribed, as it
were, to be good, just as though she were Pin or one of the little
boys. It was a punishment on her for having been so babyish as to
cry; had she not been caught in the act, the woman would never have
ventured to be so familiar. The very largeness and rosiness of the
fruit made it hateful to her, and she turned over in her mind how
she could get rid of it.</p>

<p>As the coach bumped along, her fellow-passengers sat back and
shut their eyes. The road was shadeless; beneath the horses' feet a
thick red dust rose like smoke. The grass by the wayside, under the
scattered gum trees or round the big black boulders that dotted the
hillocks, was burnt to straw. In time, Laura also grew drowsy, and
she was just falling into a doze when, with a jerk, the coach
pulled up at the "Halfway House." Here her companions alighted, and
there were more nods and smiles from the woman.</p>

<p>"You eat it, my dear. I'm sure your ma won't say nothin'," was
her last remark as she pushed the swing-door and vanished into the
house, followed by Peter.</p>

<p>Then the driver's pleasant face appeared at the window of the
coach. In one hand he held a glass, in the other a bottle of
lemonade.</p>

<p>"Here, little woman, have a drink. It's warm work ridin'."</p>

<p>Now this was quite different from the matter of the apple.
Laura's throat was parched with dust and tears. She accepted the
offer gratefully, thinking as she drank how envious Pin would be,
could she see her drinking bottle-lemonade.</p>

<p>Then the jolting and rumbling began anew. No one else got in,
and when they had passed the only two landmarks she knew&mdash;the
leprous Chinaman's hut and the market garden of Ah Chow, who twice
a week jaunted at a half-trot to the township with his hanging
baskets, to supply people with vegetables&mdash;when they had
passed these, Laura fell asleep. She wakened with a start to find
that the coach had halted to apply the brakes, at the top of the
precipitous hill that led down to the railway township. In a
two-wheeled buggy this was an exciting descent; but the coach
jammed on both its brakes, moved like a snail, and seemed hardly
able to crawl.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill the little town lay sluggish in the sun.
Although it was close on midday, but few people were astir in the
streets; for the place had long since ceased to be an important
mining centre: the chief claims were worked out; and the coming of
the railway had been powerless to give it the impetus to a new
life. It was always like this in these streets of low, verandahed,
red-brick houses, always dull and sleepy, and such animation as
there was, was invariably to be found before the doors of the many
public-houses.</p>

<p>At one of these the coach stopped and unloaded its goods, for an
interminable time. People came and looked in at the window at
Laura, and she was beginning to feel alarmed lest O'Donnell, who
had gone inside, had forgotten all about her having to catch the
train, when out he came, wiping his lips.</p>

<p>"Now for the livin' luggage!" he said with a wink, and Laura
drew back in confusion from the laughter of a group of larrikins
round the door.</p>

<p>It was indeed high time at the station; no sooner was her box
dislodged and her ticket taken than the train steamed in. O'Donnell
recommended her to the guard's care; she shook hands with him and
thanked him, and had just been locked into a carriage by herself
when he came running down the platform again, holding in his hand,
for everyone to see, the apple, which Laura believed she had safely
hidden under the cushions of the coach. Red to the roots of her
hair she had to receive it before a number of heads put out to see
what the matter was, and she was even forced to thank O'Donnell
into the bargain. Then the guard came along once more, and told her
he would let no one get in beside her: she need not be afraid.</p>

<p>"Yes. And will you please tell me when we come to
Melbourne."</p>

<p>Directly the train was clear of the station, she lowered a
window and, taking aim at a telegraph post, threw the apple from
her with all her might. Then she hung out of the window, as far out
as she could, till her hat was nearly carried off. This was the
first railway journey she had made by herself, and there was an
intoxicating sense of freedom in being locked in, alone, within the
narrow compass of the compartment. She was at liberty to do
everything that had previously been forbidden her: she walked up
and down the carriage, jumped from one seat to another, then lay
flat on her back singing to herself, and watching the telegraph
poles fly past the windows, and the wires mount and descend. But
now came a station and, though the train did not stop, she sat up,
in order that people might see she was travelling alone.</p>

<p>She grew hungry and attacked her lunch, and it turned out that
Mother had not provided too much after all. When she had finished,
had brushed herself clean of crumbs and handled, till her
finger-tips were sore, the pompous half-crown she had found in her
pocket, she fell to thinking of them at home, and of what they
would now be doing. It was between two and three o'clock: the sun
would be full on the flagstones of the back verandah; inch by inch
Pin and Leppie would be driven away to find a cooler spot for their
afternoon game, while little Frank slept, and Sarah splashed the
dinner-dishes in the brick-floored kitchen. Mother sat sewing, and
she would still be sitting there, still sewing, when the shadow of
the fir tree, which at noon was shrunken like a dwarf, had
stretched to giant size, and the children had opened the front gate
to play in the shade of the public footpath. At the thought of
these shadows, of all the familiar things she would not see again
for months to come, Laura's eyelids began to smart.</p>

<p>They had flashed through several stations; now they stopped; and
her mind was diverted by the noise and bustle. As the train swung
into motion again, she fell into a pleasanter line of thought. She
painted to herself, for the hundredth time, the new life towards
which she was journeying, and, as always, in the brightest
colours.</p>

<p>She had arrived at school, and in a spacious apartment, which
was a kind of glorified Mother's drawing-room, was being introduced
to a bevy of girls. They clustered round, urgent to make the
acquaintance of the newcomer, who gave her hand to each with an
easy grace and an appropriate word. They were too well-bred to cast
a glance at her clothes, which, however she might embellish them in
fancy, Laura knew were not what they ought to be: her ulster was
some years old, and so short that it did not cover the flounce of
her dress, and this dress, and her hat with it, were Mother's
taste, and consequently, Laura felt sure, nobody else's. But her
new companions saw that she wore these clothes with an elegance
that made up for their shortcomings; and she heard them whisper:
"Isn't she pretty? What black eyes! What lovely curls!" But she was
not proud, and by her ladylike manners soon made them feel at home
with her, even though they stood agape at her cleverness: none of
<i>them</i> could claim to have absorbed the knowledge of a whole
house. With one of her admirers she had soon formed a friendship
that was the wonder of all who saw it: in deep respect the others
drew back, forming a kind of <i>all&eacute;e</i>, down which, with
linked arms, the two friends sauntered, blind to everything but
themselves. And having embarked thus upon her sea of dreams, Laura
set sail and was speedily borne away.</p>

<p>"Next station you'll be there, little girl."</p>

<p>She sprang up and looked about her, with vacant eyes. This had
been the last stoppage, and the train was passing through the
flats. In less than two minutes she had collected her belongings,
tidied her hair and put on her gloves.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards they steamed in alongside a gravelled
platform, among the stones of which a few grass-blades grew. This
was Melbourne. At the nearer end of the platform stood two ladies,
one stout and elderly in bonnet and mantle, with glasses mounted on
a black stick, and shortsighted, peering eyes; the other stout and
comely, too, but young, with a fat, laughing face and rosy cheeks.
Laura descried them a long way off; and, as the carriage swept past
them, they also saw her, eager and prominent at her window. Both
stared at her, and the younger lady said something, and laughed.
Laura instantly connected the remark, and the amusement it caused
the speaker, with the showy red lining of her hat, at which she
believed their eyes had been directed. She also realised, when it
was too late, that her greeting had been childish, unnecessarily
effusive; for the ladies had responded only by nods. Here were two
thrusts to parry at once, and Laura's cheeks tingled. But she did
not cease to smile, and she was still wearing this weak little
smile, which did its best to seem easy and unconcerned, when she
alighted from the train.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<p>The elderly lady was Laura's godmother; she lived at Prahran,
and it was at her house that Laura would sometimes spend a monthly
holiday. Godmother was good to them all in a brusque, sharp-tongued
fashion; but Pin was her especial favourite and she made no secret
of it. Her companion on the platform was a cousin of Laura's, of at
least twice Laura's age, who invariably struck awe into the
children by her loud and ironic manner of speech. She was an
independent, manly person, in spite of her plump roundnesses; she
lived by herself in lodgings, and earned her own living as a clerk
in an office.</p>

<p>The first greetings over, Godmother's attention was entirely
taken up by Laura's box: after this had been picked out from among
the other luggage, grave doubts were expressed whether it could be
got on to the back seat of the pony-carriage, to which it was
conveyed by a porter and the boy. Laura stood shyly by and waited,
while Cousin Grace kept up the conversation by putting abrupt and
embarrassing questions.</p>

<p>"How's your ma?" she demanded rather than asked, in the slangy
and jocular tone she employed. "I guess she'll be thanking her
stars she's got rid of you;" at which Laura smiled uncertainly, not
being sure whether Cousin Grace spoke in jest or earnest.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think no end of yourself going to
boarding-school?" continued the latter.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not at all," protested Laura with due modesty; and as
both at question and answer Cousin Grace laughed boisterously,
Laura was glad to hear Godmother calling: "Come, jump in. The
ponies won't stand."</p>

<p>Godmother was driving herself&mdash;a low basket-carriage,
harnessed to two buff-coloured ponies. Laura sat with her back to
them. Godmother flapped the reins and said: "Get up!" but she was
still fretted about the box, which was being held on behind by the
boy. An inch larger, she asserted, and it would have had to be left
behind. Laura eyed its battered sides uneasily. Godmother might
remember, she thought, that it contained her whole wardrobe; and
she wondered how many of Godmother's own ample gowns could be
compressed into so small a space.</p>

<p>"All my clothes are inside," she explained; "that I shall need
for months."</p>

<p>"Ah, I expect your poor mother has sat up sewing herself to
death, that you may be as well dressed as the rest of them," said
Godmother, and heaved a doleful sigh. But Cousin Grace laughed the
wide laugh that displayed a mouthful of great healthy teeth.</p>

<p>"What? All your clothes in there?" she cried. "I say! You
couldn't be a queen if you hadn't more togs than that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," Laura hastened to reply, and grew very red.
"Queens need a lot more clothes than I've got."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said Godmother: she did not understand the allusion,
which referred to a former ambition of Laura's. "Don't talk such
nonsense to the child."</p>

<p>She drove very badly, and they went by quiet by-streets to
escape the main traffic: the pony-chaise wobbled at random from one
side of the road to the other, obstacles looming up only just in
time for Godmother to see them. The ponies shook and tossed their
heads at the constant sawing of the bits, and Laura had to be
continually ducking, to keep out of the way of the reins. She let
the unfamiliar streets go past her in a kind of dream; and there
was silence for a time, broken only by Godmother's expostulations
with the ponies, till Cousin Grace, growing tired of playing her
bright eyes first on this, then on that, brought them back to Laura
and studied her up and down.</p>

<p>"I say, who on earth trimmed your hat?" she asked almost at
once.</p>

<p>"Mother," answered Laura bravely, while the colour mounted to
her cheeks again.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess she made up her mind you shouldn't get lost as
long as you wore it," went on her cousin with disconcerting
candour. "It makes you look just like a great big red double
dahlia."</p>

<p>"Let the child be. She looks well enough," threw in Godmother in
her snappish way. But Laura was sure that she, too disapproved; and
felt more than she heard the muttered remark about "Jane always
having had a taste for something gay."</p>

<p>"Oh, I like the colour very much. I chose it myself," said
Laura, and looked straight at the two faces before her. But her
lips twitched. She would have liked to snatch the hat from her
head, to throw it in front of the ponies and hear them trample it
under their hoofs. She had never wanted the scarlet lining of the
big, upturned brim; in a dislike to being conspicuous which was
incomprehensible to Mother, she had implored the latter to "leave
it plain". But Mother had said: "Nonsense!" and "Hold your tongue!"
and "I know better,"&mdash;with this result.</p>

<p>Oh yes, she saw well enough how Godmother signed with her eyes
to Cousin Grace to say no more; but she pretended not to notice,
and for the remainder of the drive nobody spoke. They went past
long lines of grey houses, joined one to another and built exactly
alike; past large, fenced-in public parks where all kinds of odd,
unfamiliar trees grew, with branches that ran right down their
trunks, and bushy leaves. The broad streets were hilly; the wind,
coming in puffs, met them with clouds of gritty white dust. They
had just, with bent heads, their hands at their hats, passed
through one of these miniature whirlwinds, when turning a corner
they suddenly drew up, and the boy sprang to the ponies' heads.
Laura, who had not been expecting the end so soon, saw only a tall
wooden fence; but Cousin Grace looked higher, gave a stagey shudder
and cried: "Oh my eye Betty Martin! Aren't I glad it isn't me
that's going to school! It looks just like a prison."</p>

<p>It certainly was an imposing building viewed from within, when
the paling-gate had closed behind them. To Laura, who came from a
township of one-storied brick or weatherboard houses, it seemed
vast in its breadth and height, appalling in its sombre greyness.
Between Godmother and Cousin Grace she walked up an asphalted path,
and mounted the steps that led to a massive stone portico. The bell
Godmother rang made no answering sound, but after a very few
seconds the door swung back, and a slender maidservant in cap and
apron stood before them. She smiled at them pleasantly, as, in
Chinaman-fashion, they crossed the threshold; then, inclining her
head at a murmured word from Godmother, she vanished as lightly as
she had come, and they sat and looked about them. They were in a
plainly furnished but very lofty waiting-room. There were two large
windows. The venetian blinds had not been lowered, and the
afternoon sun, beating in, displayed a shabby patch on the carpet.
It showed up, too, a coating of dust that had gathered on the
desk-like, central table. There was the faint, distinctive smell of
strange furniture. But what impressed Laura most was the stillness.
No street noises pierced the massy walls, but neither did the
faintest echo of all that might be taking place in the great
building itself reach their ears: they sat aloof, shut off, as it
were, from the living world. And this feeling soon grew downright
oppressive: it must be like this to be dead, thought Laura to
herself; and inconsequently remembered a quarter of an hour she had
once spent in a dentist's ante-room: there as here the same
soundless vacancy, the same anguished expectancy. Now, as then, her
heart began to thump so furiously that she was afraid the others
would hear it. But they, too, were subdued; though Cousin Grace
tittered continually you heard only a gentle wheezing, and even
Godmother expressed the hope that they would not be kept waiting
long, under her breath. But minute after minute went by; there they
sat and nothing happened. It began to seem as if they might sit on
for ever.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, from out the spacious halls of which they had
caught a glimpse on arriving, brisk steps began to come towards
them over the oilcloth&mdash;at first as a mere tapping in the
distance, then rapidly gaining in weight and decision. Laura's
palpitations reached their extreme limit&mdash;another second and
they might have burst her chest. Cousin Grace ceased to giggle; the
door opened with a peculiar flourish; and all three rose to their
feet.</p>

<p>The person who entered was a very stately lady; she wore a cap
with black ribbons. With the door-handle still in her hand she made
a slight obeisance, in which her whole body joined, afterwards to
become more erect than before. Having introduced herself to
Godmother as Mrs. Gurley, the Lady Superintendent of the
institution, she drew up a chair, let herself down upon it, and
began to converse with an air of ineffable condescension.</p>

<p>While she talked Laura examined her, with a child's thirst for
detail. Mrs. Gurley was large and generous of form, and she carried
her head in such a haughty fashion that it made her look taller
than she really was. She had a high colour, her black hair was
touched with grey, her upper teeth were prominent. She wore gold
eyeglasses, many rings, a long gold chain, which hung from an
immense cameo brooch at her throat, and a black apron with white
flowers on it, one point of which was pinned to her ample bosom.
The fact that Laura had just such an apron in her box went only a
very little way towards reviving her spirits; for altogether Mrs.
Gurley was the most impressive person she had ever set eyes on.
Beside her, God mother was nothing but a plump, shortsighted
fidgety lady.</p>

<p>Particularly awe-inspiring was Mrs. Gurley when she listened to
another speaking. She held her head a little to one side, her teeth
met her underlip and her be-ringed hands toyed incessantly with the
long gold chain, in a manner which seemed to denote that she set
little value on what was being said. Awful, too, was the habit she
had of suddenly lowering her head and looking at you over the tops
of her glasses: when she did this, and when her teeth came down on
her lip, you would have liked to shrink to the size of a mouse.
Godmother, it was true, was not afraid of her; but Cousin Grace was
hushed at last and as for Laura herself, she consciously wore a
fixed little simper, which was meant to put it beyond doubt that
butter would not melt in her mouth.</p>

<p>Godmother now asked if she might say a few words in private, and
the two ladies left the room. As the door closed behind them Cousin
Grace began to be audible again.</p>

<p>"Oh, snakes!" she giggled, and her double chin spread itself
"There's a Tartar for you! Don't I thank my stars it's not me
that's being shunted off here! She'll give you what-for."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I think she's very nice," said Laura
staunchly, out of an instinct that made her chary of showing fear,
or pain, or grief. But her heart began to bound again, for the
moment in which she would be left alone.</p>

<p>"You see!" said Cousin Grace. "It'll be bread and water for a
week, if you can't do <i>amare</i> first go-off&mdash;not to
mention the deponents."</p>

<p>"What's <i>amare</i>?" asked Laura anxiously, and her eyes grew
so big that they seemed to fill her face.</p>

<p>But Cousin Grace only laughed till it seemed probable that she
would burst her bodice; and Laura blushed, aware that she had
compromised herself anew.</p>

<p>There followed a long and nervous pause.</p>

<p>"I bet Godmother's asking her not to wallop you too often," the
tease had just begun afresh, when the opening of the door forced
her to swallow her sentence in the middle.</p>

<p>Godmother would not sit down; so the dreaded moment had
come.</p>

<p>"Now, Laura. Be a good girl and learn well, and be a comfort to
your mother. Not that there's much need to urge her to her books,"
Godmother interrupted herself, turning to Mrs. Gurley. "The trouble
her dear mother has always had has been to keep her from them."</p>

<p>Laura glowed with pleasure. Now at least the awful personage
would know that she was clever, and loved to learn. But Mrs. Gurley
smiled the chilliest thinkable smile of acknowledgment, and did not
reply a word.</p>

<p>She escorted the other to the front door, and held it open for
them to pass out. Then, however, her pretence of affability faded
clean away: turning her head just so far that she could look down
her nose at her own shoulder, she said: "Follow me!"&mdash;in a
tone Mother would not have used even to Sarah. Feeling
inexpressibly small Laura was about to obey, when a painful thought
struck her.</p>

<p>"Oh please, I had a box&mdash;with my clothes in it!" she cried.
"Oh, I hope they haven't forgotten and taken it away again."</p>

<p>But she might as well have spoken to the hatstand: Mrs. Gurley
had sailed off, and was actually approaching a turn in the hall
before Laura made haste to follow her and to keep further anxiety
about her box to herself. They went past one staircase, round a
bend into shadows as black as if, outside, no sun were shining, and
began to ascend another flight of stairs, which was the widest
Laura had ever seen. The banisters were as thick as your arm, and
on each side of the stair-carpeting the space was broad enough for
two to walk abreast: what a splendid game of trains you could have
played there! On the other hand the landing windows were so high up
that only a giant could have seen out of them.</p>

<p>These things occurred to Laura mechanically. What really
occupied her, as she trudged behind, was how she could please this
hard-faced woman and make her like her, for the desire to please,
to be liked by all the world, was the strongest her young soul
knew. And there must be a way, for Godmother had found it without
difficulty.</p>

<p>She took two steps at once, to get nearer to the portly back in
front of her.</p>

<p>"What a <i>very</i> large place this is!" she said in an
insinuating voice.</p>

<p>She hoped the admiration, thus subtly expressed in the form of
surprise, would flatter Mrs. Gurley, as a kind of co-proprietor;
but it was evident that it did nothing of the sort: the latter
seemed to have gone deaf and dumb, and marched on up the stairs,
her hands clasped at her waist, her eyes fixed ahead, like a
walking stone-statue.</p>

<p>On the top floor she led the way to a room at the end of a long
passage. There were four beds in this room, a washhand-stand, a
chest of drawers, and a wall cupboard. But at first sight Laura had
eyes only for the familiar object that stood at the foot of one of
the beds.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>there's</i> my box!" she cried, "Someone must have
brought it up."</p>

<p>It was unroped; she had simply to hand over the key. Mrs. Gurley
went down on her knees before it, opened the lid, and began to pass
the contents to Laura, directing her where to lay and hang them.
Overawed by such complaisance, Laura moved nimbly about the room
shaking and unfolding, taking care to be back at the box to the
minute so as not to keep Mrs. Gurley waiting. And her promptness
was rewarded; the stern face seemed to relax. At the mere hint of
this, Laura grew warm through and through; and as she could neither
control her feelings nor keep them to herself, she rushed to an
extreme and overshot the mark.</p>

<p>"I've got an apron like that. I think they're so pretty," she
said cordially, pointing to the one Mrs. Gurley wore.</p>

<p>The latter abruptly stopped her work, and, resting her hands on
the sides of the box, gave Laura one of the dreaded looks over her
glasses, looked at her from top to toe, and as though she were only
now beginning to see her. There was a pause, a momentary suspension
of the breath, which Laura soon learned to expect before a
rebuke.</p>

<p>"Little gels," said Mrs. Gurley&mdash;and even in the midst of
her confusion Laura could not but be struck by the pronunciation of
this word. "Little gels&mdash;are required&mdash;to wear white
aprons when they come here!"&mdash;a break after each few words, as
well as an emphatic head-shake, accentuated their severity. "And I
should like to know, if your mother, has never taught you, that it
is very rude, to point, and also to remark, on what people
wear."</p>

<p>Laura went scarlet: if there was one thing she, Mother all of
them prided themselves on, it was the good manners that had been
instilled into them since their infancy. The rough reproof seemed
to scorch her.</p>

<p>She went to and fro more timidly than before. Then, however,
something happened which held a ray of hope.</p>

<p>"Why, what is this?" asked Mrs. Gurley freezingly, and held up
to view&mdash;with the tips of her fingers, Laura thought&mdash;a
small, black Prayer Book. "Pray, are you not a
dissenter?"&mdash;For the College was nonconformist.</p>

<p>"Well...no, I'm not," said Laura, in a tone of intense apology.
Here, at last, was her chance. "But it really doesn't matter a bit.
I can go to another church quite well. I even think I'd rather. For
a change. And the service isn't so long, at least so I've
heard&mdash;except the sermon," she added truthfully.</p>

<p>Had she denied religion altogether, the look Mrs. Gurley bent on
her could not have been more annihilating.</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;unfortunately!&mdash;no occasion, for you to do
anything of the kind," she retorted. "I myself, am an Episcopalian,
and I expect those gels, who belong to the Church of England, to
attend it, with me."</p>

<p>The unpacking at an end, Mrs. Gurley rose, smoothed down her
apron, and was just on the point of turning away, when on the bed
opposite Laura's she espied an under-garment, lying wantonly across
the counterpane. At this blot on the orderliness of the room she
seemed to swell like a turkey-cock, seemed literally to grow before
Laura's eyes as, striding to the door, she commanded an invisible
some one to send Lilith Gordon to her "<i>di</i>-rectly!"!</p>

<p>There was an awful pause; Laura did not dare to raise her head;
she even said a little prayer. Mrs. Gurley stood working at her
chain, and tapping her foot&mdash;like a beast waiting for its
prey, thought the child. And at last a hurried step was heard in
the corridor, the door opened and a girl came in, high-coloured and
scant of breath. Laura darted one glance at Mrs. Gurley's face,
then looked away and studied the pattern of a quilt, trying not to
hear what was said. Her throat swelled, grew hard and dry with pity
for the culprit. But Lilith Gordon&mdash;a girl with sandy
eyebrows, a turned-up nose, a thick plait of red-gold hair, and a
figure so fully developed that Laura mentally dubbed it a "lady's
figure", and put its owner down for years older than
herself&mdash;Lilith Gordon neither fell on her knees nor sank
through the floor. Her lashes were lowered, in a kind of dog-like
submission, and her face had gone very red when Laura ventured to
look at her again; but that was all. And Mrs. Gurley having swept
Jove-like from the room, this bold girl actually set her finger to
her nose and muttered: "Old Brimstone Beast!" As she passed Laura,
too, she put out her tongue and said: "Now then, goggle-eyes, what
have you got to stare at?"</p>

<p>Laura was deeply hurt: she had gazed at Lilith out of the purest
sympathy. And now, as she stood waiting for Mrs. Gurley, who seemed
to have forgotten her, the strangeness of things, and the general
unfriendliness of the people struck home with full force. The late
afternoon sun was shining in, in an unfamiliar way; outside were
strange streets, strange noises, a strange white dust, the expanse
of a big, strange city. She felt unspeakably far away now, from the
small, snug domain of home. Here, nobody wanted her...she was alone
among strangers, who did not even like her...she had already,
without meaning it, offended two of them.</p>

<p>Another second, and the shameful tears might have found their
way out. But at this moment there was a kind of preparatory boom in
the distance, and the next, a great bell clanged through the house,
pealing on and on, long after one's ears were rasped by the din. It
was followed by an exodus from the rooms round about; there was a
sound of voices and of feet. Mrs. Gurley ceased to give orders in
the passage, and returning, bade Laura put on a pinafore and follow
her.</p>

<p>They descended the broad staircase. At a door just at the foot,
Mrs. Gurley paused and smoothed her already faultless bands of
hair; then turned the handle and opened the door, with the majestic
swing Laura had that day once before observed.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<p>Fifty-five heads turned as if by clockwork, and fifty-five pairs
of eyes were levelled at the small girl in the white apron who
meekly followed Mrs. Gurley down the length of the dining-room.
Laura crimsoned under the unexpected ordeal, and tried to fix her
attention on the flouncing of Mrs. Gurley's dress. The room seemed
hundreds of feet long, and not a single person at the tea-tables
but took stock of her. The girls made no scruple of leaning
backwards and forwards, behind and before their neighbours, in
order to see her better, and even the governesses were not above
having a look. All were standing. On Mrs. Gurley assigning Laura a
place at her own right hand, Laura covered herself with confusion
by taking her seat at once, before grace had been said, and before
the fifty-five had drawn in their chairs with the noise of a
cavalry brigade on charge. She stood up again immediately, but it
was too late; an audible titter whizzed round the table: the new
girl had sat down. For minutes after, Laura was lost in the pattern
on her plate; and not till tongues were loosened and dishes being
passed, did she venture to steal a glance round.</p>

<p>There were four tables, with a governess at the head and foot of
each to pour out tea. It was more of a hall than a room and had
high, church-like windows down one side. At both ends were scores
of pigeon-holes. There was a piano in it and a fireplace; it had
pale blue walls, and only strips of carpet on the floor. At present
it was darkish, for the windows did not catch the sun.</p>

<p>Laura was roused by a voice at her side; turning, she found her
neighbour offering her a plate of bread.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said impulsively; for the bread was cut in
chunks, and did not look inviting.</p>

<p>But the girl nudged her on the sly. "You'd better take some,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>Laura then saw that there was nothing else. But she saw, too,
the smiles and signs that again flew round: the new girl had said
no.</p>

<p>Humbly she accepted the butter and the cup of tea which were
passed to her in turn, and as humbly ate the piece of rather stale
bread. She felt forlornly miserable under the fire of all these
unkind eyes, which took a delight in marking her slips: at the
smallest further mischance she might disgrace herself by bursting
out crying. Just at this moment, however, something impelled her to
look up. Her vis-a-vis, whom she had as yet scarcely noticed, was
staring hard. And now, to her great surprise, this girl winked at
her, winked slowly and deliberately with the right eye. Laura was
so discomposed that she looked away again at once, and some seconds
elapsed before she was brave enough to take another peep. The wink
was repeated.</p>

<p>It was a black-haired girl this time, a girl with small blue
eyes, a pale, freckled skin, and large white teeth. What most
impressed Laura, though, was her extraordinary gravity: she chewed
away with a face as solemn as a parson's; and then just when you
were least expecting it, came the wink. Laura was fascinated: she
lay in wait for it beforehand and was doubtful whether to feel
offended by it or to laugh at it. But at least it made her forget
her mishaps, and did away with the temptation to cry.</p>

<p>When, however, Mrs. Gurley had given the signal, and the
fifty-five had pushed back their chairs and set them to the table
again with the same racket as before, Laura's position was a
painful one. Everybody pushed, and talked, and laughed, in a hurry
to leave the hall, and no one took any notice of her except to
stare. After some indecision, she followed the rest through a door.
Here she found herself on a verandah facing the grounds of the
school. There was a long bench, on which several people were
sitting: she took a modest seat at one end. Two of the younger
governesses looked at her and laughed, and made a remark. She saw
her room-mate, Lilith Gordon, arm in arm with a couple of
companions. The winker of the tea-table turned out to be a girl of
her own age, but of a broader make; she had fat legs, which were
encased in thickly-ribbed black stockings. As she passed the bench
she left the friend she was with, to come up to Laura and dig her
in the ribs.</p>

<p>"<i>Didn't</i> she like her bread and butter, poor little
thing?" she said. Laura shrank from the dig, which was rough; but
she could not help smiling shyly at the girl, who looked
good-natured. If only she had stayed and talked to her! But she was
off and away, her arm round a comrade's neck.</p>

<p>Besides herself, there was now only an elderly governess left,
who was reading. She, Laura, in her solitude, was conspicuous to
every eye. But at this juncture up came two rather rollicking older
girls, one of whom was fair, with a red complexion. As soon as
their loud voices had driven the governess away, the smaller of the
two, who had a pronounced squint, turned to Laura.</p>

<p>"Hullo, you kid," she said, "what's <i>your</i> name?"</p>

<p>Laura artlessly replied. She was dumbfounded by the storm of
merriment that followed. Maria Morell, the fat girl, went purple,
and had to be thumped on the back by her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" she gasped, when she had got her breath. "Oh,
my...hold me, some one, or I shall split! Oh, golly!
Laura...Tweedle...Rambotham&mdash;Laura...Tweedle...Rambotham!..."
her voice tailed off again. "Gosh! Was there ever such a name?"</p>

<p>She laughed till she could laugh no more, rocking backwards and
forwards and from side to side; while her companion proceeded to
make further inquiries.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" the squint demanded of Laura, in a
business-like way.</p>

<p>Laura named the township, quaveringly. "What's your father?"</p>

<p>"He's dead," answered the child.</p>

<p>"Well, but I suppose he was alive once wasn't he, duffer? What
was he before he was dead?"</p>

<p>"A barrister."</p>

<p>"What did he die of?"</p>

<p>"Consumption."</p>

<p>"How many servants do you keep?"</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>"How much have you got a year?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twelve and a quarter."</p>

<p>"Who made your dress?"</p>

<p>"Mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, hang it, that's enough. Stop teasing the kid," said
Maria Morell, when the laughter caused by the last admission had
died away. But the squint spied a friend, ran to her, and there was
a great deal of whispering and sniggering. Presently the pair came
sauntering up and sat down; and after some artificial humming and
hawing the newcomer began to talk, in a loud and fussy manner,
about certain acquaintances of hers called Tweedledum and
Tweedledee. Both the fat girl and the squint "split" with laughter.
Laura sat with her hands locked one inside the other; there was no
escape for her, for she did not know where to go. But when the
third girl put the regulation question: "What's your name and
what's your father?" she turned on her, with the courage of
despair.</p>

<p>"What's yours?" she retorted hotly, at the same time not at all
sure how the big girl might revenge herself. To her relief, the
others burst out laughing at their friend's bafflement.</p>

<p>"That's one for you, Kate Horner," said Maria with a chuckle.
"Not bad for the kid. Come on, Kid, will you have a walk round the
garden?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, <i>please</i>," said Laura, reddening with pleasure;
and there she was, arm in arm with her fat saviour, promenading the
grounds like any other of the fifty-five.</p>

<p>She assumed, as well as she could, an air of feeling at her ease
even in the presence of the cold and curious looks that met her.
The fat girl was protective, and Laura felt too grateful to her to
take it amiss that every now and then she threw back her head and
laughed anew, at the remembrance of Laura's patronymics; or that
she still exchanged jokes about them with the other couple, when
they met.</p>

<p>But by this time half an hour had slipped away, and the girls
were fast disappearing. Maria Morell loitered till the last minute,
then said, she, too, must be off to 'stew'. Every one was hastening
across the verandah laden with books, and disappearing down a
corridor. Left alone, Laura made her way back to the dining-hall.
Here some of the very young boarders were preparing their lessons,
watched over by a junior governess. Laura lingered for a little, to
see if no order were forthcoming, then diffidently approached the
table and asked the governess if she would please tell her what to
do.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," answered that lady, disinclined for
responsibility. "You'd better ask Miss Chapman. Here, Maggie, show
her where the study is."</p>

<p>Laura followed the little girl over the verandah and down the
corridor. At the end, the child pointed to a door, and on opening
this Laura found herself in a very large brightly lighted room,
where the boarders sat at two long tables with their books before
them. Every head was raised at her entrance. In great
embarrassment, she threaded her way to the more
authoritative-looking of the governesses in charge, and proffered
her request. It was not understood, and she had to repeat it.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said Miss Day in her turn: she had
stiff, black, wavy hair, a vivid colour, and a big, thick nose
which made her profile resemble that of a horse. "Can't you twiddle
your thumbs for a bit?&mdash;Oh well, if you're so desperately
anxious for an occupation, you'd better ask Miss Chapman."</p>

<p>The girls in the immediate neighbourhood laughed noiselessly, in
a bounden-duty kind of way, at their superior's pleasantry, and
Laura, feeling as though she had been hit, crossed to the other
table. Miss Chapman, the head governess, was neither so
hard-looking nor so brilliant as Miss Day. She even eyed Laura
somewhat uneasily, meanwhile toying with a long gold chain, after
the manner of the Lady Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Didn't Mrs. Gurley tell you what to do?" she queried. "I should
think it likely she would. Oh well, if she didn't, I suppose you'd
better bring your things downstairs. Yes...and ask Miss Zielinski
to give you a shelf."</p>

<p>Miss Zielinski&mdash;she was the governess in the
dining-hall&mdash;said: "Oh, very well," in the rather whiny voice
that seemed natural to her, and went on reading.</p>

<p>"Please, I don't think I know my way," ventured Laura.</p>

<p>"Follow your nose and you'll find it!" said Miss Zielinski
without looking up, and was forthwith wrapt in her novel again.</p>

<p>Once more Laura climbed the wide staircase: it was but dimly
lighted, and the passages were in darkness. After a few false moves
she found her room, saw that her box had been taken away, her books
left lying on a chair. But instead of picking them up, she threw
herself on her bed and buried her face in the pillow. She did not
dare to cry, for fear of making her eyes red, but she hugged the
cool linen to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I hate them all," she said passionately, speaking aloud to
herself. "Oh, <i>how</i> I hate them!"&mdash;and wild schemes of
vengeance flashed through her young mind. She did not even halt at
poison or the knife: a big cake, sent by Mother, of which she
invited all alike to partake, and into which she inserted a fatal
poison, so that the whole school died like rabbits; or a nightly
stabbing, a creeping from bed to bed in the dark, her penknife open
in her hand...</p>

<p>But she had not lain thus for more than a very few minutes when
steps came along the passage; and she had only just time to spring
to her feet before one of the little girls appeared at the
door.</p>

<p>"You're to come down at once."</p>

<p>"Don't you know you're not <i>allowed</i> to stay upstairs?"
asked Miss Zielinski crossly. "What were you doing?" And as Laura
did not reply: "What was she doing, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the child. "She was just standing there."
And all the little girls laughed, after the manner of their
elders.</p>

<p>Before Laura had finished arranging her belongings on the
shelves that were assigned to her, some of the older girls began to
drop in from the study. One unceremoniously turned over her books,
which were lying on the table.</p>

<p>"Let's see what the kid's got."</p>

<p>Now Laura was proud of her collection: it really made a great
show; for a daughter of Godmother's had once attended the College,
and her equipment had been handed down to Laura.</p>

<p>"Why, you don't mean to say a kid like you's in the Second
Principia already?" said a big girl, and held up, incredulously,
Smith's black and red boards. "Wherever did <i>you</i> learn
Latin?"</p>

<p>In the reediest of voices Laura was forced to confess that she
had never learnt Latin at all.</p>

<p>The girl eyed her in dubious amaze, then burst out laughing.
"Oh, I say!" she called to a friend. "Here's a rum go. Here's this
kid brings the Second Principia with her and doesn't know the
First."</p>

<p>Several others crowded round; and all found this divergence from
the norm, from the traditional method of purchasing each book new
and as it was needed, highly ridiculous. Laura, on her knees before
her shelf, pretended to be busy; but she could not see what she was
doing, for the mist that gathered in her eyes.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, however, in marched Maria Morell. "Here, I
say, stop that!" she cried. "You're teasing that kid again. I won't
have it. Here, come on, Kid&mdash;Laura Tweedledum come and sit by
me for supper."</p>

<p>For the second time, Laura was thankful to the fat girl. But as
ill-luck would have it, Miss Chapman chanced to let her eyes stray
in their direction; and having fingered her chain indecisively for
a little, said: "It seems a pity, doesn't it, Miss Day, that that
nice little girl should get in with that vulgar set?"</p>

<p>Miss Chapman liked to have her opinions confirmed. But this was
a weakness Miss Day did not pamper; herself strong-minded, she
could afford to disregard Miss Chapman's foibles. So she went on
with her book, and ignored the question. But Miss Zielinski, who
lost no opportunity of making herself agreeable to those over her,
said with foreign emphasis: "Yes, indeed it does."</p>

<p>So Laura was summoned and made to sit down at the end of the
room, close to the governesses and beside the very big
girls&mdash;girls of eighteen and nineteen, who seemed older still
to her, with their figures, and waists, and skirts that touched the
ground.</p>

<p>Instinctively she felt that they resented her proximity. The
biggest of all, a pleasant-faced girl with a kind smile, said on
seeing her downcast air: "Poor little thing! Never mind." But when
they talked among themselves they lowered their voices and cast
stealthy glances at her, to see if she were listening.</p>

<p>Supper over, three chairs were set out in an exposed position;
the big bell in the passage was lightly touched; everyone fetched a
hymn-book, one with music in it being handed to Miss Chapman at the
piano. The door opened to admit first Mrs. Gurley, then the
Principal and his wife&mdash;a tall, fair gentleman in a long coat,
and a sweet-faced lady, who wore a rose in her velvet dress.</p>

<p>"Let us sing in the hundred and fifty-seventh hymn," said the
gentleman, who had a Grecian profile and a drooping, sandy
moustache; and when Miss Chapman had played through the tune, the
fifty-five, the governesses, the lady and gentleman rose to their
feet and sang, with halting emphasis, of the Redeemer and His
mercy, to Miss Chapman's accompaniment, which was as indecisive as
her manner, the left hand dragging lamely along after the
right.</p>

<p>"Let us read in the third chapter of the Second Epistle of Paul
to the Thessalonians."</p>

<p>Everyone laid her hymn-book on the table and sat down to listen
to Paul's words, which the sandy gentleman read to a continual
nervous movement of the left leg.</p>

<p>"Let us pray."</p>

<p>Obeying the word, the fifty-five rose, faced about, and knelt to
their chairs. It was an extempore prayer, and a long one, and Laura
did not hear much of it; for the two big girls on her right kept up
throughout a running conversation. Also, when it was about half
over she was startled to hear Miss Zielinski say, in a shrill
whisper: "Heavens! There's that mouse again," and audibly draw her
skirts round her. Even Miss Chapman, praying to her piano-chair
some distance off, had heard, and turned her head to frown
rebuke.</p>

<p>The prayer at an end, Mr. and Mrs. Strachey bowed vaguely in
several directions, shook hands with the governesses, and left the
room. This was the signal for two of the teachers to advance with
open Bibles.</p>

<p>"Here, little one, have you learned your verse?" whispered
Laura's pleasant neighbour.</p>

<p>Laura knew nothing of it; but the big girl lent her a Bible,
and, since it was not a hard verse and every girl repeated it, it
was quickly learned.</p>

<p><i>I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty
inventions.</i>
</p>

<p>Told off in batches, they filed up the stairs. On the first
landing stood Miss Day, watching with lynx-eyes to see that no
books or eatables were smuggled to the bedrooms. In a strident
voice she exhorted the noisy to silence, and the loiterers to
haste.</p>

<p>Laura sped to her room. She was fortunate enough to find it
still empty. Tossing off her clothes, she gabbled ardently through
her own prayers, drew the blankets up over her head, and pretended
to be asleep. Soon the lights were out and all was quiet. Then,
with her face burrowed deep, so that not a sound could escape, she
gave free play to her tears.</p>

<p>My dear mother</p>

<p>I sent you a postcard did you get it. I told you I got here all
right and liked it very much. I could not write a long letter
before I had no time and we are only allowed to write letters two
evenings a week Tuesday and Friday. When we have done our lessons
for next day we say please may I write now and Miss Chapman says
have you done everything and if we say we have she says yes and if
you sit at Miss Days table Miss Day says it. And sometimes we
havent but we say so. I sit up by Miss Chapman and she can see
everything I do and at tea and dinner and breakfast I sit beside
Mrs Gurley. Another girl in my class sits oposite and one sits
besides me and we would rather sit some where else. I dont care for
Mrs Gurley much she is very fat and never smiles and never listens
to what you say unless she scolds you and I think Miss Chapman is
afraid of her to. Miss Day is not afraid of anybody. I am in the
first class. I am in the College and under that is the school. Only
very little girls are in the school they go to bed at half past
eight and do their lessons in the dining hall. I do mine in the
study and go to bed with the big girls. They wear dresses down to
the ground. Lilith Gordon is a girl in my class she is in my room
to she is only as old as me and she wears stays and has a beautiful
figgure. All the girls wear stays. Please send me some I have no
waste. A governess sleeps in our room and she has no teeth. She
takes them out every night and puts them in water when the light is
out. Lilith Gordon and the other girl say good night to her after
she has taken them off then she cant talk propperly and we want to
hear her. I think she knows for she is very cross. I dont learn
latin yet till I go into the second class my sums are very hard.
For supper there is only bread and butter and water if we don't
have cake and jam of our own. Please send me some strawbery jam and
another cake. Tell Sarah there are three servants to wait at dinner
they have white aprons and a cap on their heads. They say will you
take beef miss</p>

<p>I remain</p>

<p>your loving daughter</p>

<p>Laura.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Dear Pin</p>

<p>I am very busy I will write you a letter. You would not like
being here I think you should always stop at home you will never
get as far as long division. Mrs Gurley is an awful old beast all
the girls call her that. You <i>would</i> be frightened of her. In
the afternoon after school we walk two and two and you ask a girl
to walk with you and if you dont you have to walk with Miss
Chapman. Miss Chapman and Miss Day walks behind and they watch to
see you dont laugh at boys. Some girls write letters to them and
say they will meet them up behind a tree in the corner of the
garden a paling is lose and the boys put letters in. I think boys
are silly but Maria Morell says they are tip top that means awfuly
jolly. She writes a letter to boys every week she takes it to
church and drops it coming out and he picks it up and puts an
answer through the fence. We put our letters on the mantlepiece in
the dining hall and Mrs Gurley or Miss Chapman read the adress to
see we dont write to boys. They are shut up she cant read the
inside. I hope you dont cry so much at school no one cries. Now
Miss Chapman says it is time to stop</p>

<p>I remain</p>

<p>your afectionate sister</p>

<p>Laura.</p>

<p>P. S. I took the red lining out of my hat.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Warrenega<br>
Sunday.<br>
My dear Laura</p>

<p>We were very glad to get your letters which came this morning.
Your postcard written the day after you arrived at the College told
us little or nothing. However Godmother was good enough to write us
an account of your arrival so that we were not quite without news
of you. I hope you remembered to thank her for driving in all that
way to meet you and take you to school which was very good of her.
I am glad to hear you are settling down and feeling happy and I
hope you will work hard and distinguish yourself so that I may be
proud of you. But there are several things in your letters I do not
like. Did you really think I shouldnt read what you wrote to Pin.
You are a very foolish girl if you did. Pin the silly child tried
to hide it away because she knew it would make me cross but I
insisted on her showing it to me and I am ashamed of you for
writing such nonsense to her. Maria Morell must be a very vulgar
minded girl to use the expressions she does. I hope my little girl
will try to only associate with nice minded girls. I didnt send you
to school to get nasty ideas put into your head but to learn your
lessons well and get on. If you write such vulgar silly things
again I shall complain to Mrs Gurley or Mr Strachey about the tone
of the College and what goes on behind their backs. I think it is
very rude of you too to call Mrs Gurley names. Also about the poor
governess who has to wear false teeth. Wait till all your own teeth
are gone and then see how you will like it. I do want you to have
nice feelings and not grow rough and rude. There is evidently a
very bad tone among some of the girls and you must be careful in
choosing your friends. I am sorry to hear you are only in the
lowest class. It would have pleased me better if you had got into
the second but I always told you you were lazy about your
sums&mdash;you can do them well enough if you like. You dont need
stays. I have never worn them myself and I dont intend you to
either. Your own muscles are quite strong enough to bear the weight
of your back. Bread and water is not much of a supper for you to go
to bed on. I will send you another cake soon and some jam and I
hope you will share it with the other girls. Now try and be
sensible and industrious and make nice friends and then I shant
have to scold you</p>

<p>your loving mother</p>

<p>J.T.R.</p>

<p>P. S. Another thing in your letter I dont like. You say you tell
your governess you have finished your lessons when you have not
done so. That is telling an untruth and I hope you are not going to
be led away by the examples of bad girls. I have always brought you
children up to be straightforward and I am astonished at you
beginning fibbing as soon as you get away from home. Fibbing soon
leads to something worse.</p>

<p>P. P. S. You must have written your letter in a great hurry for
your spelling is anything but perfect. You are a very naughty girl
to meddle with your hat. Pin has written a letter which I enclose
though her spelling is worse than ever.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Daer Laura</p>

<p>mother says you are a verry sily girl to rite such sily letters
I think you are sily to I shood be fritened of Mrs Girly I dont
want to go to Skool I wood rather stop with mother and be a cumfert
to her I think it is nauty to drop letters in Cherch and verry sily
to write to Boys boys are so sily Sarah sends her luv she says she
wood not ware a cap on her hed not for annything she says She wood
just as soon ware a ring thrugh her nose.</p>

<p>I remain</p>

<p>your luving sister</p>

<p>Pin.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Dear mother</p>

<p>please, please dont write to Mrs Gurley about the Tone in the
College or not to Mr Strachey either. I will never be so silly
again. I am sorry my letters were so silly I wont do it again.
Please dont write to them about it. I dont go much with Maria
Morell now I think she is vulger to. I know two nice girls now in
my own class their names are Inez and Bertha they are very nice and
not at all vulger. Maria Morell is fat and has a red face she is
much older than me and I dont care for her now. Please dont write
to Mrs Gurley I will never call her names again. I had to write my
letter quickly because when I have done my lessons it is nearly
time for supper. I am sorry my spelling was wrong I will take more
pains next time I will learn hard and get on and soon I will be in
the second class. I did not mean I said I had done my lessons when
I had not done them the other girls say it and I think it is very
wrong of them. Plese dont write to Mrs Gurley I will try and be
good and sensible and not do it again if you only wont write</p>

<p>I remain</p>

<p>your afectionate daughter</p>

<p>Laura.</p>

<p>P. S. I can do my sums better now.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Warrenega<br>
My dear Laura</p>

<p>My letter evidently gave you a good fright and I am not sorry to
hear it for I think you deserved it for being such a foolish girl.
I hope you will keep your promise and not do it again. Of course I
dont mean that you are not to tell me everything that happens at
school but I want you to only have nice thoughts and feelings and
grow into a wise and sensible girl. I am not going to write a long
letter today. This is only a line to comfort and let you know that
I shall not write to Mrs Gurley or Mr Strachey as long as I see
that you are being a good girl and getting on well with your
lessons. I do want you to remember that you are a lady though you
are poor and must behave in a ladylike way. You dont tell me what
the food at the College is like and whether you have blankets
enough on your bed at night. Do try and remember to answer the
questions I ask you. Sarah is busy washing today and the children
are helping her by sitting with their arms in the tubs. I am to
tell you from Pin that Maggy is moulting badly and has not eaten
much since you left which is just three weeks today</p>

<p>your loving</p>

<p>Mother.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Friday<br>
My dear mother</p>

<p>I was so glad to get your letter I am so glad you will not write
to Mrs Gurley this time and I will promise to be very good and try
to remember everything you tell me. I am sorry I forgot to answer
the questions I have four blankets on my bed and it is enough. The
food is very nice for dinner for tea we have to eat a lot of bread
and butter I dont care for bread much. Sometimes we have jam but we
are not allowed to eat butter and jam together. A lot of girls get
up at six and go down to practice they dont dress and have their
bath they just put on their dressing gowns on top of their night
gowns. I dont go down now till seven I make my own bed. We have
prayers in the morning and the evening and prayers again when the
day scholers come. I do my sums better now I think I shall soon be
in the second class. Pins spelling was dreadful and she is nearly
nine now and is such a baby the girls would laugh at her</p>

<p>I remain</p>

<p>your afectionate daughter</p>

<p>Laura.</p>

<p>P. S. I parsed a long sentence without any mistakes.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<p>The mornings were beginning to grow dark and chilly: fires were
laid overnight in the outer classrooms&mdash;and the junior
governess who was on early duty, having pealed the six-o'clock
bell, flitted like a grey wraith from room to room and from one
gas-jet to another, among stretched, sleeping forms. And the few
minutes' grace at an end, it was a cold, unwilling pack that threw
off coverlets and jumped out of bed, to tie on petticoats and
snuggle into dressing-gowns and shawls; for the first approach of
cooler weather was keenly felt, after the summer heat. The
governess blew on speedily chilblained fingers, in making her
rounds of the verandahs to see that each of the twenty pianos was
rightly occupied; and, as winter crept on, its chief outward sign
an occasional thin white spread of frost which vanished before the
mighty sun of ten o'clock, she sometimes took the occupancy for
granted, and skipped an exposed room.</p>

<p>At eight, the boarders assembled in the dining-hall for prayers
and breakfast. After this meal it was Mrs. Gurley's custom to drink
a glass of hot water. While she sipped, she gave audience, meting
out rebukes and crushing complaints&mdash;were any bold enough to
offer them&mdash;standing erect behind her chair at the head of the
table, supported by one or more of the staff. To suit the season
she was draped in a shawl of crimson wool, which reached to the
flounce of her skirt, and was borne by her portly shoulders with
the grace of a past day. Beneath the shawl, her dresses were built,
year in, year out, on the same plan: cut in one piece, buttoning
right down the front, they fitted her like an eelskin, rigidly
outlining her majestic proportions, and always short enough to show
a pair of surprisingly small, well-shod feet. Thus she stood,
sipping her water, and boring with her hard, unflagging eye every
girl that presented herself to it. Most shrank noiselessly away as
soon as breakfast was over; for, unless one was very firm indeed in
the conviction of one's own innocence, to be beneath this eye was
apt to induce a disagreeable sense of guilt. In the case of Mrs.
Gurley, familiarity had never been known to breed contempt. She was
possessed of what was little short of genius, for ruling through
fear; and no more fitting overseer could have been set at the head
of these half-hundred girls, of all ages and degrees: gentle and
common; ruly and unruly, children hardly out of the nursery, and
girls well over the brink of womanhood, whose ripe, bursting forms
told their own tale; the daughters of poor ministers at reduced
fees; and the spoilt heiresses of wealthy wool-brokers and
squatters, whose dowries would mount to many thousands of pounds.
Mrs. Gurley was equal to them all.</p>

<p>In a very short time, there was no more persistent shrinker from
the ice of this gaze than little Laura. In the presence of Mrs.
Gurley the child had a difficulty in getting her breath. Her first
week of school life had been one unbroken succession of snubs and
reprimands. For this, the undue familiarity of her manner was to
blame: she was all too slow to grasp&mdash;being of an impulsive
disposition and not naturally shy&mdash;that it was indecorous to
accost Mrs. Gurley off-hand, to treat her, indeed, in any way as if
she were an ordinary mortal. The climax had come one
morning&mdash;it still made Laura's cheeks burn to remember it. She
had not been able to master her French lesson for that day, and
seeing Mrs. Gurley chatting to a governess had gone thoughtlessly
up to her and tapped her on the arm.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gurley, please, do you think it would matter very much if
I only took half this verb today? It's <i>coudre</i>, and means to
sew, you know, and it's <i>so</i> hard. I don't seem to be able to
get it into my head."</p>

<p>Before the words were out of her mouth, she saw that she had
made a terrible mistake. Mrs. Gurley's face, which had been
smiling, froze to stone. She looked at her arm as though the hand
had bitten her, and Laura's sudden shrinking did not move her, to
whom seldom anyone addressed a word unbidden.</p>

<p>"How <i>dare</i> you interrupt me&mdash;when I am
speaking!"&mdash;she hissed, punctuating her words with the ominous
head-shakes and pauses. "The first thing, miss, for you to do, will
be, to take a course of lessons, in manners. Your present ones, may
have done well enough, in the outhouse, to which you have evidently
belonged. They will not do, here, in the company of your
betters."</p>

<p>Above the child's head the two ladies smiled significantly at
each other, assured that, after this, there would be no further
want of respect; but Laura did not see them. The iron of the thrust
went deep down into her soul: no one had ever yet cast a slur upon
her home. Retreating to a lavatory she cried herself nearly sick,
making her eyes so red that she was late for prayers in trying to
wash them white. Since that day, she had never of her own free will
approached Mrs. Gurley again, and even avoided those places where
she was likely to be found. This was why one morning, some three
weeks later, on discovering that she had forgotten one of her
lesson-books, she hesitated long before re-entering the
dining-hall. The governesses still clustered round their chief, and
the pupils were not expected to return. But it was past nine
o'clock; in a minute the public prayer-bell would ring, which
united boarders, several hundred day-scholars, resident and
visiting teachers in the largest class-room; and Laura did not know
her English lesson. So she stole in, cautiously dodging behind the
group, in a twitter lest the dreaded eyes should turn her way.</p>

<p>It was Miss Day who spied her and demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>"Such carelessness! You girls would forget your heads if they
weren't screwed on," retorted the governess, in the dry, violent
manner that made her universally disliked.</p>

<p>Thankful to escape with this, Laura picked out her book and
hurried from the room.</p>

<p>But the thoughts of the group had been drawn to her.</p>

<p>"The greatest little oddity we've had here for some time,"
pronounced Miss Day, pouting her full bust in decisive fashion.</p>

<p>"She is, indeed," agreed Miss Zielinski.</p>

<p>"I don't know what sort of a place she comes from, I'm sure,"
continued the former: "but it must be the end of creation. She's
utterly no idea of what's what, and as for her clothes they're fit
for a Punch and Judy show."</p>

<p>"She's had no training either&mdash;stupid, I call her," chimed
in one of the younger governesses, whose name was Miss Snodgrass.
"She doesn't know the simplest things, and her spelling is awful.
And yet, do you know, at history the other day, she wanted to hold
forth about how London looked in Elizabeth's reign&mdash;when she
didn't know a single one of the dates!"</p>

<p>"She can say some poetry," said Miss Zielinski. "And she's read
Scott."</p>

<p>One and all shook their heads at this, and Mrs. Gurley went on
shaking hers and smiling grimly. "Ah! the way gels are brought up
nowadays," she said. "There was no such thing in my time. We were
made to learn what would be of some use and help to us
afterwards."</p>

<p>Elderly Miss Chapman twiddled her chain. "I hope I did right
Mrs. Gurley. She had one week's early practice, but she looked so
white all day after it that I haven't put her down for it again. I
hope I did right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, we don't want to have them ill, you know," replied
Mrs. Gurley, in the rather irresponsive tone she adopted towards
Miss Chapman. "As long as it isn't mere laziness."</p>

<p>"I don't think she's lazy," said Miss Chapman. "At least she
takes great pains with her lessons at night."</p>

<p>This was true. Laura tried her utmost, with an industry born of
despair. For the comforting assurance of speedy promotion, which
she had given Mother, had no root in fact. These early weeks only
served to reduce, bit by bit, her belief in her own knowledge. How
slender this was, and of how little use to her in her new state,
she did not dare to confess even to herself. Her disillusionment
had begun the day after her arrival, when Dr Pughson, the
Headmaster, to whom she had gone to be examined in arithmetic,
flung up hands of comical dismay at her befogged attempts to solve
the mysteries of long division. An upper class was taking a lesson
in Euclid, and in the intervals between her mazy reckonings she had
stolen glances at the master. A tiny little nose was as if squashed
flat on his face, above a grotesquely expressive mouth, which
displayed every one of a splendid set of teeth. He had small,
short-sighted, red-rimmed eyes, and curly hair which did not stop
growing at his ears, but went on curling, closely cropped, down the
sides of his face. He taught at the top of his voice, thumped the
blackboard with a pointer, was biting at the expense of a pupil who
confused the angle BFC with the angle BFG, a moment later to volley
forth a broad Irish joke which convulsed the class. He bewitched
Laura; she forgot her sums in the delight of watching him; and this
made her learning seem a little scantier than it actually was; for
she had to wind up in a great hurry. He pounced down upon her; the
class laughed anew at his playful horror; and yet again at the
remark that it was evident she had never had many pennies to spend,
or she would know better what to do with the figures that
represented them. In these words Laura scented a reference to
Mother's small income, and grew as red as fire.</p>

<p>In the lowest class in the College she sat bottom, for a week or
more: what she did know, she knew in such an awkward form that she
might as well have known nothing. And after a few efforts to better
her condition she grew cautious, and hesitated discreetly before
returning one of those ingenuous answers which, in the beginning,
had made her the merry-andrew of the class. She could for instance,
read a French story-book without skipping very many words; but she
had never heard a syllable of the language spoken, and her first
attempts at pronunciation caused even Miss Zielinski to sit back in
her chair and laugh till the tears ran down her face. History Laura
knew in a vague, pictorial way: she and Pin had enacted many a
striking scene in the garden&mdash;such as "Not Angles but Angels,"
or, did the pump-drain overflow, Canute and his silly
courtiers&mdash;and she also had out-of-the-way scraps of
information about the characters of some of the monarchs, or, as
the governess had complained, about the state of London at a
certain period; but she had never troubled her head with dates. Now
they rose before her, a hard, dry, black line from 1066 on,
accompanied, not only by the kings who were the cause of them, but
by dull laws, and their duller repeals. Her lessons in English
alone gave her a mild pleasure; she enjoyed taking a sentence to
pieces to see how it was made. She was fond of words, too, for
their own sake, and once, when Miss Snodgrass had occasion to use
the term "eleemosynary", Laura was so enchanted by it that she
sought to share her enthusiasm with her neighbour. This girl, a fat
little Jewess, went crimson, from trying to stifle her
laughter.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter with you girls down there?" cried
Miss Snodgrass. "Carrie Isaacs, what are you laughing like that
for?"</p>

<p>"It's Laura Rambotham, Miss Snodgrass. She's so funny,"
spluttered the girl.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Laura?"</p>

<p>Laura did not answer. The girl spoke for her.</p>

<p>"She said&mdash;hee, hee!&mdash;she said it was blue."</p>

<p>"Blue? What's blue?" snapped Miss Snodgrass.</p>

<p>"That word. She said it was so beautiful...and that it was
blue."</p>

<p>"I didn't. Grey-blue, I said," murmured Laura her cheeks
aflame.</p>

<p>The class rocked; even Miss Snodgrass herself had to join in the
laugh while she hushed and reproved. And sometimes after this, when
a particularly long or odd word occurred in the lesson, she would
turn to Laura and say jocosely: "Now, Laura, come on, tell us what
colour that is. Red and yellow, don't you think?"</p>

<p>But these were "Tom Fool's colours"; and Laura kept a wise
silence.</p>

<p>One day at geography, the pupils were required to copy the
outline of the map of England. Laura, about to begin, found to her
dismay that she had lost her pencil. To confess the loss meant one
of the hard, public rebukes from which she shrank. And so, while
the others drew, heads and backs bent low over their desks, she
fidgeted and sought&mdash;on her lap, the bench, the floor.</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter?" asked her neighbour crossly; it
was the black-haired boarder who had winked at Laura the first
evening at tea; her name was Bertha Ramsey. "I can't draw a stroke
if you shake like that."</p>

<p>"I've lost my pencil."</p>

<p>The girl considered Laura for a moment, then pushed the lid from
a box of long, beautifully sharpened drawing-pencils. "Here, you
can have one of these."</p>

<p>Laura eyed the well-filled box admiringly, and modestly selected
the shortest pencil. Bertha Ramsay, having finished her map, leaned
back in her seat.</p>

<p>"And next time you feel inclined to boo-hoo at the tea-table,
hold on to your eyebrows and sing Rule Britannia. <i>Did</i> it
want its mummy, poor ickle sing?"</p>

<p>Here Bertha's chum, a girl called Inez, chimed in from the other
side.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you," she said to Bertha, in a deep,
slow voice. "You're a weekly boarder."</p>

<p>Laura had the wish to be very pleasant, in return for the
pencil. So she drew a sigh, and said, with over-emphasis: "How nice
for your mother to have you home every week!"</p>

<p>Bertha only laughed at this, in a teasing way: "Yes, isn't it?"
But Inez leaned across behind her and gave Laura a poke.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" she telegraphed.</p>

<p>"Who's talking down there?" came the governess's cry. "Here you,
the new girl, Laura what's&mdash;your-name, come up to the
map."</p>

<p>A huge map of England had been slung over an easel; Laura was
required to take the pointer and show where Stafford lay. With the
long stick in her hand, she stood stupid and confused. In this
exigency, it did not help her that she knew, from hear-say, just
how England looked; that she could see, in fancy, its ever-green
grass, thick hedges, and spreading trees; its never-dry rivers; its
hoary old cathedrals; its fogs, and sea-mists, and over-populous
cities. She stood face to face with the most puzzling map in the
world&mdash;a map seared and scored with boundary-lines, black and
bristling with names. She could not have laid her finger on London
at this moment, and as for Stafford, it might have been in the
moon.</p>

<p>While the class straggled along the verandah at the end of the
hour, Inez came up to Laura's side.</p>

<p>"I say, you shouldn't have said that about her mother." She
nodded mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Laura, and coloured at the thought that she had
again, without knowing it, been guilty of a <i>faux pas</i>.</p>

<p>Inez looked round to see that Bertha was not within hearing,
then put her lips to Laura's ear.</p>

<p>"She drinks."</p>

<p>Laura gaped incredulous at the girl, her young eyes full of
horror. From actual experience, she hardly knew what drunkenness
meant; she had hitherto associated it only with the lowest class of
Irish agricultural labourer, or with those dreadful white women who
lived, by choice, in Chinese Camps. That there could exist a mother
who drank was unthinkable...outside the bounds of nature.</p>

<p>"Oh, how awful!" she gasped, and turned pale with excitement.
Inez could not help giggling at the effect produced by her
words&mdash;the new girl was a 'rum stick' and no mistake&mdash;but
as Laura's consternation persisted, she veered about.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't know for certain if that's it. But there's
something awfully queer about her."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>how</i> do you know?" asked her breathless listener,
mastered by a morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>"I've been there&mdash;at Vaucluse&mdash;from a Saturday till
Monday. She came in to lunch, and she only talked to herself, not
to us. She tried to eat mustard with her pudding too, and her meat
was cut up in little pieces for her. I guess if she'd had a knife
she'd have cut our throats."</p>

<p>"Oh!" was all Laura could get out.</p>

<p>"I was so frightened my mother said I shouldn't go again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope she won't ask me. What shall I do if she does?"</p>

<p>"Look out, here she comes! Don't say a word. Bertha's awfully
ashamed of it," said Inez, and Laura had just time to give a hasty
promise.</p>

<p>"Hullo, you two, what are you gassing about?" cried Bertha, and
dealt out a couple of her rough and friendly punches. "I say, who's
on for a race up the garden?"</p>

<p>They raced, all three, with flying plaits and curls, much
kicking-up of long black legs, and a frank display of frills and
tuckers. Laura won; for Inez's wind gave out half way, and Bertha
was heavy of foot. Leaning against the palings Laura watched the
latter come puffing up to join her&mdash;Bertha with the shameful
secret in the background, of a mother who was not like other
mothers.</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<p>Laura had been, for some six weeks or more, a listless and
unsuccessful pupil, when one morning she received an invitation
from Godmother to spend the coming monthly holiday&mdash;from
Saturday till Monday&mdash;at Prahran. The month before, she had
been one of the few girls who had nowhere to go; she had been
forced to pretend that she liked staying in, did it in fact by
preference. Now her spirits rose.</p>

<p>Marina, Godmother's younger daughter, from whom Laura inherited
her school-books, was to call for her. By a little after nine
o'clock on Saturday morning, Laura had finished her weekly mending,
tidied her bedroom, and was ready dressed even to her gloves. It
was a cool, crisp day; and her heart beat high with
expectation.</p>

<p>From the dining-hall, it was not possible to hear the ringing of
the front-door bell; but each time either of the maids entered with
a summons, Laura half rose from her chair, sure that her turn had
come at last. But it was half-past nine, then ten, then half-past;
it struck eleven, the best of the day was passing, and still Marina
did not come. Only two girls besides herself remained. Then
respectively an aunt and a mother were announced, and these two
departed. Laura alone was left: she had to bear the disgrace of
Miss Day observing: "Well, it looks as if <i>your</i> friends had
forgotten all about you, Laura."</p>

<p>Humiliated beyond measure, Laura had thoughts of tearing off her
hat and jacket and declaring that she felt too ill to go out. But
at last, when she was almost sick with suspense, Mary put her tidy
head in once more.</p>

<p>"Miss Rambotham has been called for."</p>

<p>Laura was on her feet before the words were spoken. She sped to
the reception-room.</p>

<p>Marina, a short, sleek-haired, soberly dressed girl of about
twenty, had Godmother's brisk, matter-of-fact manner.</p>

<p>She offered Laura her cheek to kiss. "Well, I suppose you're
ready now?"</p>

<p>Laura forgave her the past two hours. "Yes, quite, thank you,"
she answered.</p>

<p>They went down the asphalted path and through the garden-gate,
and turned to walk townwards. For the first time since her arrival
Laura was free again&mdash;a prisoner at large. Round them
stretched the broad white streets of East Melbourne; at their side
was the thick, exotic greenery of the Fitzroy Gardens; on the brow
of the hill rose the massive proportions of the Roman Catholic
Cathedral. Laura could have danced, as she walked at Marina's
side.</p>

<p>After a few queries, however, as to how she liked school and how
she was getting on with her lessons, Marina fell to contemplating a
strip of paper that she held in her hand. Laura gathered that her
companion had combined the task of calling for her with a morning's
shopping, and that she had only worked half through her list of
commissions before arriving at the College. At the next corner they
got on to the outside car of a cable-tramway, and were carried into
town. Here Marina entered a co-operative grocery store, where she
was going to give an order for a quarter's supplies. She was her
mother's housekeeper, and had an incredible knowledge of groceries,
as well as a severely practical mind: she stuck her finger-nail
into butter, tasted cheeses off the blade of a knife, ran her hands
through currants, nibbled biscuits, discussed brands of burgundy
and desiccated soups&mdash;Laura meanwhile looking on, from a high,
uncomfortable chair, with a somewhat hungry envy. When everything,
down to pepper and salt, had been remembered, Marina filled in a
cheque, and was just about to turn away when she recollected an
affair of some empty cases, which she wished to send back. Another
ten minutes' parley ensued; she had to see the manager, and was
closeted with him in his office, so that by the time they emerged
into the street again a full hour had gone by.</p>

<p>"Getting hungry?" she inquired of Laura.</p>

<p>"A little. But I can wait," answered Laura politely.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Marina, off whose own appetite the edge had
no doubt been taken by her various nibblings. "Now there's only the
chemist."</p>

<p>They rode to another street, entered a druggist's, and the same
thing on a smaller scale was repeated, except that here Marina did
no tasting, but for a stray gelatine or jujube. By the time the
shop door closed behind them, Laura could almost have eaten
liquorice powder. It was two o'clock, and she was faint with
hunger.</p>

<p>"We'll be home in plenty of time," said Marina, consulting a
neat watch. "Dinner's not till three today, because of father."</p>

<p>Again a tramway jerked them forward. Some half mile from their
destination, Marina rose.</p>

<p>"We'll get out here. I have to call at the butcher's."</p>

<p>At a quarter to three, it was a very white-faced, exhausted
little girl that followed her companion into the house.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll have a fine healthy appetite for dinner,"
said Marina, as she showed her where to hang up her hat and wash
her hands.</p>

<p>Godmother was equally optimistic. From the sofa of the
morning-room, where she sat knitting, she said: "Well,
<i>you've</i> had a fine morning's gadding about I must say! How
are you? And how's your dear mother?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you."</p>

<p>Godmother scratched her head with a spare needle, and the
attention she had had for Laura evaporated. "I hope, Marina, you
told Graves about those empty jam-jars he didn't take back last
time?"</p>

<p>Marina, without lifting her eyes from a letter she was reading,
returned: "Indeed I didn't. He made such a rumpus about the
sugar-boxes that I thought I'd try to sell them to Petersen
instead."</p>

<p>Godmother grunted, but did not question Marina's decision. "And
what news have you from your dear mother?" she asked again, without
looking at Laura&mdash;just as she never looked at the stocking she
held, but always over the top of it.</p>

<p>Here, however, the dinner-bell rang, and Laura, spared the task
of giving more superfluous information, followed the two ladies to
the dining-room. The other members of the family were waiting at
the table. Godmother's husband&mdash;he was a lawyer&mdash;was a
morose, black-bearded man who, for the most part, kept his eyes
fixed on his plate. Laura had heard it said that he and Godmother
did not get on well together; she supposed this meant that they did
not care to talk to each other, for they never exchanged a direct
word: if they had to communicate, it was done by means of a third
person. There was the elder daughter, Georgina, dumpier and still
brusquer than Marina, the eldest son, a bank-clerk who was
something of a dandy and did not waste civility on little girls;
and lastly there were two boys, slightly younger than Laura,
black-haired, pug-nosed, pugnacious little creatures, who stood in
awe of their father, and were all the wilder when not under his
eye.</p>

<p>Godmother mumbled a blessing; and the soup was eaten in
silence.</p>

<p>During the meat course, the bank-clerk complained in extreme
displeasure of the way the laundress had of late dressed his
collars&mdash;these were so high that, as Laura was not slow to
notice, he had to look straight down the two sides of his nose to
see his plate&mdash;and announced that he would not be home for
tea, as he had an appointment to meet some 'chappies' at five, and
in the evening was going to take a lady friend to Brock's
Fireworks. These particulars were received without comment. As the
family plied its pudding-spoons, Georgina in her turn made a
statement.</p>

<p>"Joey's coming to take me driving at four."</p>

<p>It looked as if this remark, too, would founder on the general
indifference. Then Marina said warningly, as if recalling her
parent's thoughts: "Mother!"</p>

<p>Awakened, Godmother jerked out: "Indeed and I hope if you go
you'll take the boys with you!"</p>

<p>"Indeed and I don't see why we should!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, you'll stop at home. If Joey doesn't choose to
come to the point&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now hold your tongue, mother!"</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Crikey!" said the younger boy, Erwin, in a low voice. "Joey's
got to take us riding."</p>

<p>"If you and Joey can't get yourselves properly engaged," snapped
Godmother, "then you shan't go driving without the boys, and that's
the end of it."</p>

<p>Like dogs barking at one another, thought Laura, listening to
the loveless bandying of words&mdash;she was unused to the
snappishness of the Irish manner, which sounds so much worse than
it is meant to be: and she was chilled anew by it when, over the
telephone, she heard Georgy holding a heated conversation with
Joey.</p>

<p>He was a fat young man, with hanging cheeks, small eyes, and a
lazy, lopsided walk.</p>

<p>"Hello&mdash;here's a little girl! What's <i>her</i>
name?&mdash;Say, this kiddy can come along too."</p>

<p>As it had leaked out that Marina's afternoon would be spent
between the shelves of her storeroom, preparing for the incoming
goods, Laura gratefully accepted the offer.</p>

<p>They drove to Marlborough Tower. With their backs to the horse
sat the two boys, mercilessly alert for any display of fondness on
the part of the lovers; sat Laura, with her straight, inquisitive
black eyes. Hence Joey and Georgy were silent, since, except to
declare their feelings, they had nothing to say to each other.</p>

<p>The Tower reached, the mare was hitched up and the ascent of the
light wooden erection began. It was a blowy day.</p>

<p>"Boys first!" commanded Joey. "Cos o' the petticuts."&mdash;His
speech was as lazy as his walk.</p>

<p>He himself led the way, followed by Erwin and Marmaduke, and
Laura, at Georgy's bidding, went next. She clasped her bits of
skirts anxiously to her knees, for she was just as averse to the
frills and flounces that lay beneath being seen by Georgy, as by
any of the male members of the party. Georgy came last, and, though
no one was below her, so tightly wound about was she that she could
hardly advance her legs from one step to another. Joey looked
approval; but the boys sniggered, and kept it up till Georgy,
having gained the platform, threatened them with a "clout on the
head".</p>

<p>On the return journey a dispute arose between the lovers: it
related to the shortest road home, waxed hot, and was rapidly
taking on the dimensions of a quarrel, when the piebald mare shied
at a traction-engine and tried to bolt. Joey gripped the reins, and
passed his free arm round Georgy's waist.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, darling."</p>

<p>Though the low chaise rocked from side to side and there seemed
a likelihood of it capsizing, the two boys squirmed with laughter,
and dealt out sundry nudges, kicks and pokes, all of which were
received by Laura, sitting between them. She herself turned
red&mdash;with embarrassment. At the same time she wondered why
Joey should believe George was afraid; there was no sign of it in
Georgy's manner; she sat stolid and unmoved. Besides she, Laura,
was only a little girl, and felt no fear. She also asked herself
why Joey should suddenly grow concerned about Georgy, when, a
moment before, they had been so rude to each other. These were
interesting speculations, and, the chaise having ceased to sway,
Laura grew meditative.</p>

<p>In the evening Godmother had a visitor, and Laura sat in a low
chair, listening to the ladies' talk. It was dull work: for, much
as she liked to consider herself "almost grown up", she yet
detested the conversation of "real grown-ups" with a child's
heartiness. She was glad when nine o'clock struck and Marina,
lighting a candle, told her to go to bed.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. Between breakfast and church-time
yawned two long hours. Georgy went to a Bible-class; Marina was
busy with orders for the dinner.</p>

<p>It was a bookless house&mdash;like most Australian houses of its
kind: in Marina's bedroom alone stood a small bookcase containing
school and Sunday school prizes. Laura was very fond of reading,
and as she dressed that morning had cast longing looks at these
volumes, had evenly shyly fingered the glass doors. But they were
locked. Breakfast over, she approached Marina on the subject. The
latter produced the key, but only after some haggling, for her idea
of books was to keep the gilt on their covers untarnished.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate it must be a Sunday book," she said
ungraciously.</p>

<p>She drew out <i>The Giant Cities of Bashan and Syria's Holy
Places</i>, and with this Laura retired to the drawing-room, where
Godmother was already settled for the day, with a suitable
magazine. When the bells began to clang the young people, primly
hatted, their prayer-books in their hands, walked to the
neighbouring church. There Laura sat once more between the boys,
Marina and Georgy stationed like sentinels at the ends of the pew,
ready to pounce down on their brothers if necessary, to confiscate
animals and eatables, or to rap impish knuckles with a Bible. It
was a spacious church; the pew was in a side aisle; one could see
neither reading-desk nor pulpit; and the words of the sermon seemed
to come from a great way off.</p>

<p>After dinner, Laura and the boys were dispatched to the garden,
to stroll about in Sunday fashion. Here no elder person being
present, the natural feelings of the trio came out: the distaste of
a quiet little girl for rough boys and their pranks; the resentful
indignation of the boys at having their steps dogged by a sneak and
a tell-tale. As soon as they had rounded the tennis-court and were
out of sight of the house, Erwin and Marmaduke clambered over the
palings and dropped into the street, vowing a mysterious vengeance
on Laura if she went indoors without them. The child sat down on
the edge of the lawn under a mulberry tree and propped her chin on
her hands. She was too timid to return to the house and brave
things out; she was also afraid of some one coming into the garden
and finding her alone, and of her then being forced to "tell"; for
most of all she feared the boys, and their vague, rude threats. So
she sat and waited...and waited. The shadows on the grass changed
their shapes before her eyes; distant chapel-bells tinkled their
quarter of an hour and were still again; the blighting torpor of a
Sunday afternoon lay over the world. Would to-morrow ever come? She
counted on her fingers the hours that had still to crawl by before
she could get back to school&mdash;counted twice over to be sure of
them&mdash;and all but yawned her head off, with ennui. But time
passed, and passed, and nothing happened. She was on the verge of
tears, when two black heads bobbed up above the fence, the boys
scrambled over, red and breathless, and hurried her into tea.</p>

<p>She wakened next morning at daybreak, so eager was she to set
out. But Marina had a hundred and one odd jobs to do before she was
ready to start, and it struck half-past nine as the two of them
neared the College. Child-like, Laura felt no special gratitude for
the heavy pot of mulberry jam Marina bore on her arm; but at sight
of the stern, grey, stone building she could have danced with joy;
and on the front door swinging to behind her, she drew a deep sigh
of relief.</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>

<p>From this moment on&mdash;the moment when Mary the maid's
pleasant smile saluted her&mdash;Laura's opinion of life at school
suffered a change. She was glad to be back&mdash;that was the first
point: just as an adventurous sheep is glad to regain the cover of
the flock. Learning might be hard; the governesses mercilessly
secure in their own wisdom; but here she was at least a person of
some consequence, instead of as at Godmother's a mere negligible
null.</p>

<p>Of her unlucky essay at holiday-making she wrote home guardedly:
the most tell-tale sentence in her letter was that in which she
said she would rather not go to Godmother's again in the meantime.
But there was such a lack of warmth in her account of the visit
that mother made this, together with the above remark, the text for
a scolding.</p>

<blockquote>"You're a very ungrateful girl," she wrote, "to forget
all Godmother has done for you. If it hadn't been for her supplying
you with books and things I couldn't have sent you to school at
all. And I hope when you grow up you'll be as much of a help to me
as Marina is to her mother. I'd much rather have you good and
useful than clever and I think for a child of your age you see
things with very sharp unkind eyes. Try and only think nice things
about people and not be always spying out their faults. Then you'll
have plenty of friends and be liked wherever you go."</blockquote>

<p>Laura took the statement about the goodness and cleverness with
a grain of salt: she knew better. Mother thought it the proper
thing to say, and she would certainly have preferred the two
qualities combined; but, had she been forced to choose between
them, there was small doubt how her choice would have fallen out.
And if, for instance, Laura confessed that her teachers did not
regard her as even passably intelligent, there would be a nice
to-do. Mother's ambitions knew no bounds; and, wounded in these,
she was quite capable of writing post-haste to Mrs. Gurley or Mr.
Strachey, complaining of their want of insight, and bringing
forward a string of embarrassing proofs. So, leaving Mother to her
pleasing illusions, Laura settled down again to her role of dunce,
now, though, with more equanimity than before. School was really
not a bad place after all&mdash;this had for some time been her
growing conviction, and the visit to Godmother seemed to bring it
to a head.</p>

<p>About this time, too, a couple of pieces of good fortune came
her way.</p>

<p>The first: she was privileged to be third in the friendship
between Inez and Bertha&mdash;a favour of which she availed herself
eagerly, though the three were as different from one another as
three little girls could be. Bertha was a good-natured romp,
hard-fisted, thick of leg, and of a plodding but ineffectual
industry. Inez, on the other hand, was so pretty that Laura never
tired of looking at her: she had a pale skin, hazel eyes, brown
hair with a yellow light in it, and a Greek nose. Her mouth was
very small; her nostrils were mere tiny slits; and so lazy was she
that she seldom more than half opened her eyes. Both girls were
well over fourteen, and very fully developed: compared with them,
Laura was like nothing so much as a skinny young colt.</p>

<p>She was so grateful to them for tolerating her that she never
took up a stand of real equality with them: proud and sensitive,
she was always ready to draw back and admit their prior rights to
each other; hence the friendship did not advance to intimacy. But
such as it was, it was very comforting; she no longer needed to sit
alone in recess; she could link arms and walk the garden with
complacency; and many were the supercilious glances she now threw
at Maria Morell and that clique; for her new friends belonged
socially to the best set in the school.</p>

<p>In another way, too, their company made things easier for her:
neither of them aimed high; and both were well content with the
lowly places they occupied in the class. And so Laura, who was
still, in her young confusion, unequal to discovering what was
wanted of her, grew comforted by the presence and support of her
friends, and unmindful of higher opinion; and Miss Chapman, in
supervising evening lessons, remarked with genuine regret that
little Laura was growing perky and lazy.</p>

<p>Her second piece of good luck was of quite a different
nature.</p>

<p>Miss Hicks, the visiting governess for geography, had a gift for
saying biting things that really bit. She bore Inez a peculiar
grudge; for she believed that certain faculties slumbered behind
the Grecian profile, and that only the girl's ingrained sloth
prevented them.</p>

<p>One day she lost patience with this sluggish pupil.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Inez," she said; "you're blessed with
a real woman's brain: vague, slippery, inexact, interested only in
the personal aspect of a thing. You can't concentrate your
thoughts, and, worst of all, you've no curiosity&mdash;about
anything that really matters. You take all the great facts of
existence on trust&mdash;just as a hen does&mdash;and I've no doubt
you'll go on contentedly till the end of your days, without ever
knowing why the ocean has tides, and what causes the seasons. It
makes me ashamed to belong to the same sex."</p>

<p>Inez's classmates tittered furiously, let the sarcasm glide over
them, unhit by its truth. Inez herself, indeed, was inclined to
consider the governess's taunt a compliment, as proving that she
was incapable of a vulgar inquisitiveness. But Laura, though she
laughed docilely with the rest, could not forget the
incident&mdash;words in any case had a way of sticking to her
memory&mdash;and what Miss Hicks had said often came back to her,
in the days that followed. And then, all of a sudden, just as if an
invisible hand had opened the door to an inner chamber, a light
broke on her. Vague, slippery, inexact, interested only in the
personal&mdash;every word struck home. Had Miss Hicks set out to
describe <i>her</i>, in particular, she could not have done it more
accurately. It was but too true: until now, she, Laura, had been
satisfied to know things in a slipslop, razzle-dazzle way, to know
them anyhow, as it best suited herself. She had never set to work
to master a subject, to make it her own in every detail. Bits of
it, picturesque scraps, striking features&mdash;what Miss Hicks no
doubt meant by the personal&mdash;were all that had attracted her.
Oh, and she, too, had no intelligent curiosity. She could not say
that she had ever teased her brains with wondering why the earth
went round the sun and not the sun round the earth. Honestly
speaking, it made no difference to her that the globe was indented
like an orange, and not the perfect round you began by believing it
to be. But if this were so, if she were forced to make these
galling admissions, then it was clear that her vaunted cleverness
had never existed, except in Mother's imagination. Or, at any rate,
it had crumbled to pieces like a lump of earth, under the hard,
heavy hand of Miss Hicks. Laura felt humiliated, and could not
understand her companions treating the matter so airily. She did
not want to have a woman's brain, thank you; not one of that sort;
and she smarted for the whole class.</p>

<p>Straightway she set to work to sharpen her wits, to follow the
strait road. At first with some stumbling, of course, and frequent
backslidings. Intellectual curiosity could not, she discovered, be
awakened to order; and she often caught herself napping. Thus
though she speedily became one of the most troublesome askers-why,
her desire for information was apt to exhaust itself in putting the
question, and she would forget to listen to the answer. Besides,
for the life of her she could not drum up more interest in, say,
the course of the Gulf Stream, or the formation of a plateau, than
in the fact that, when Nelly Bristow spoke, little bubbles came out
of her mouth, and that she needed to swallow twice as often as
other people; or that when Miss Hicks grew angry her voice had a
way of failing, at the crucial moment, and flattening out to
nothing&mdash;just as if one struck tin after brass. No, it was
indeed difficult for Laura to invert the value of these things. In
another direction she did better. By dint of close attention, of
pondering both the questions asked by Miss Hicks, and the replies
made by the cleverest pupils, she began to see more clearly where
true knowledge lay. It was facts that were wanted of her; facts
that were the real test of learning; facts she was expected to
know. Stories, pictures of things, would not help her an inch along
the road. Thus, it was not the least use in the world to her to
have seen the snowy top of Mount Kosciusko stand out against a dark
blue evening sky, and to know its shape to a tittlekin. On the
other hand, it mattered tremendously that this mountain was 7308
and not 7309 feet high: that piece of information was valuable, was
of genuine use to you; for it was worth your place in the
class.</p>

<p>Thus did Laura apply herself to reach the school ideal, thus
force herself to drive hard nails of fact into her vagrant
thoughts. And with success. For she had, it turned out, a retentive
memory, and to her joy learning by heart came easy to her&mdash;as
easy as to the most brilliant scholars in the form. From now on she
gave this talent full play, memorising even pages of the history
book in her zeal; and before many weeks had passed, in all lessons
except those in arithmetic&mdash;you could not, alas! get sums by
rote&mdash;she was separated from Inez and Bertha by the width of
the class.</p>

<p>But neither her taste of friendship and its comforts, nor the
abrupt change for the better in her class-fortunes, could
counterbalance Laura's luckless knack of putting her foot in it.
This she continued to do, in season and out of season. And not with
the authorities alone.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, that unfortunate evening when she was
one of the batch of girls invited to Mrs. Strachey's drawingroom.
Laura, ignorant of what it meant to be blasee, had received her
note of invitation with a thrill, had even enjoyed writing, in her
best hand, the prescribed formula of acceptance. But she was alone
in this; by the majority of her companions these weekly parties
were frankly hated, the chief reason being that every guest was
expected to take a piece of music with her. Even the totally unfit
had to show what they could do. And the fact that cream-tarts were
served for supper was not held to square accounts.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you," grumbled Laura's room-mate, Lilith
Gordon, as she lathered her thick white arms and neck before
dressing. "You're a new girl; you probably won't be asked."</p>

<p>Laura did not give the matter a second thought: hastily
selecting a volume of music, she followed the rest of the white
dresses into the passage. The senior girl tapped at the drawingroom
door. It was opened by no other than the Principal himself.</p>

<p>In the girls' eyes, Mr. Strachey stood over six feet in his
stocking-soles. He had also a most arrogant way of looking down his
nose, and of tugging, intolerantly, at his long, drooping
moustache. There was little need for him to assume the frigid
contemptuousness of Mrs. Gurley's manner: his mere presence, the
very unseeingness of his gaze, inspired awe. Tales ran of his
wrath, were it roused; but few had experienced it. He quelled the
high spirits of these young colonials by his dignified air of
detachment.</p>

<p>Now, however, he stood there affable and smiling, endeavouring
to put a handful of awkward girls at their ease. But neither his
nor Mrs. Strachey's efforts availed. It was impossible for the
pupils to throw off, at will, the crippling fear that governed
their relations with the Principal. To them, his amiability
resembled the antics of an uncertain-tempered elephant, with which
you could never feel safe. Besides on this occasion it was a young
batch, and of particularly mixed stations. And so a dozen girls,
from twelve to fifteen years old, sat on the extreme edges of their
chairs, and replied to what was said to them, with dry throats.</p>

<p>Though the youngest of the party, Laura was the least
embarrassed: she had never known a nursery, but had mixed with her
elders since her babyhood. And she was not of a shy disposition;
indeed, she still had to be reminded daily that shyness was
expected of her. So she sat and looked about her. It was an
interesting room in which she found herself. Low bookshelves, three
shelves high, ran round the walls, and on the top shelf were many
outlandish objects. What an evening it would have been had Mr.
Strachey invited them to examine these ornaments, or to handle the
books, instead of having to pick up a title here and there by
chance. From the shelves, her eyes strayed to the pictures on the
walls; one, in particular struck her fancy. It hung over the
mantelpiece, and was a man's head seen in profile, with a long
hooked nose, and wearing a kind of peaked cap. But that was not
all: behind this head were other profiles of the same face, and
seeming to come out of clouds. Laura stared hard, but could make
nothing of it. And meanwhile her companions were rising with sickly
smiles, to seat themselves, red as turkey-cocks' combs, on the
piano stool, where with cold, stiff fingers they stumbled through
the movement of a sonata or sonatina.</p>

<p>It was Lilith Gordon who broke the chain by offering to sing.
The diversion was welcomed by Mrs. Strachey, and Lilith went to the
piano. But her nervousness was such that she broke down half-way in
the little prelude to the ballad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Strachey came to the rescue. "It's so difficult, is it not,
to accompany oneself?" she said kindly. "Perhaps one of the others
would play for you?"</p>

<p>No one moved.</p>

<p>"Do any of you know the song?"</p>

<p>Two or three ungraciously admitted the knowledge, but none
volunteered.</p>

<p>It was here Laura chimed in. "I could play it," she said; and
coloured at the sound of her own voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Strachey looked doubtfully at the thin little girl. "Do you
know it, dear? You're too young for singing, I think."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know it. But I could play it from sight. It's quite
easy."</p>

<p>Everyone looked disbelieving, especially the unhappy singer.</p>

<p>"I've played much harder things than that," continued Laura.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you might try," said Mrs. Strachey, with the
ingrained distrust of the unmusical.</p>

<p>Laura rose and went to the piano, where she conducted the song
to a successful ending.</p>

<p>Mrs. Strachey looked relieved. "Very nice indeed." And to Laura:
"Did you say you didn't know it, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, I never saw it before."</p>

<p>Again the lady looked doubtful. "Well, perhaps you would play us
something yourself now?"</p>

<p>Laura had no objection; she had played to people before her
fingers were long enough to cover the octave. She took the volume
of Thalberg she had brought with her, selected "Home, Sweet Home",
and pranced in.</p>

<p>Her audience kept utter silence; but, had she been a little
sharper, she would have grasped that it was the silence of
amazement. After the prim sonatinas that had gone before,
Thalberg's florid ornaments had a shameless sound. Her performance,
moreover, was a startling one; the forte pedal was held down
throughout; the big chords were crashed and banged with all the
strength a pair of twelve-year-old arms could put into them; and
wrong notes were freely scattered. Still, rhythm and melody were
well marked, and there was no mistaking the agility of the small
fingers.</p>

<p>Dead silence, too, greeted the conclusion of the piece Several
girls were very red, from trying not to laugh. The Principal tugged
at his moustache, in abstracted fashion.</p>

<p>Laura had reached her seat again before Mrs. Strachey said
undecidedly: "Thank you, dear. Did you...hm...learn that piece
here?"</p>

<p>Laura saw nothing wrong. "Oh, no, at home," she answered. "I
wouldn't care to play the things I learn here, to people. They're
so dull."</p>

<p>A girl emitted a faint squeak. But a half turn of Mrs.
Strachey's head subdued her. "Oh, I hope you will soon get to like
classical music also," said the lady gravely, and in all good
faith. "We prefer it, you know, to any other."</p>

<p>"Do you mean things like the <i>Air in G with Variations</i>?
I'm afraid I never shall. There's no tune in them."</p>

<p>Music was as fatal to Laura's equilibrium as wine would have
been. Finding herself next Mr. Strachey, she now turned to him and
said, with what she believed to be ease of manner: "Mr. Strachey,
will you please tell me what that picture is hanging over the
mantelpiece? I've been looking at it ever since I came in, but I
can't make it out. Are those ghosts, those things behind the man,
or what?"</p>

<p>It took Mr. Strachey a minute to recover from his astonishment.
He stroked hard, and the look he bent on Laura was not
encouraging.</p>

<p>"It seems to be all the same face," continued the child, her
eyes on the picture.</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. Strachey, with extreme deliberation: "that is
the portrait, by a great painter, of a great poet&mdash;Dante
Alighieri."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dante, is it?" said Laura showily&mdash;she had once heard
the name. "Oh, yes, of course, I know now. He wrote a book, didn't
he, called <i>Faust</i>? I saw it over there by the door. What
lovely books!"</p>

<p>But here Mr. Strachey abruptly changed his seat, and Laura's
thirst for information was left unquenched.</p>

<p>The evening passed, and she was in blessed ignorance of anything
being amiss, till the next morning after breakfast she was bidden
to Mrs. Gurley.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, on her emerging from that lady's
private sitting-room, her eyes were mere swollen slits in her face.
Instead, however, of sponging them in cold water and bravely
joining her friends, Laura was still foolish enough to hide and
have her cry out. So that when the bell rang, she was obliged to go
in to public prayers looking a prodigious fright, and thereby
advertising to the curious what had taken place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gurley had crushed and humiliated her. Laura learnt that
she had been guilty of a gross impertinence, in profaning the ears
of the Principal and Mrs. Strachey with Thalberg's music, and that
all the pieces she had brought with her from home would now be
taken from her. Secondly, Mr. Strachey had been so unpleasantly
impressed by the boldness of her behaviour, that she would not be
invited to the drawing-room again for some time to come.</p>

<p>The matter of the music touched Laura little: if they preferred
their dull old exercises to what she had offered them, so much the
worse for them. But the reproach cast on her manners stung her even
more deeply than it had done when she was still the raw little
newcomer: for she had been pluming herself of late that she was now
"quite the thing".</p>

<p>And yet, painful as was this fresh overthrow of her pride, it
was neither the worst nor the most lasting result of the incident.
That concerned her schoolfellows. By the following morning the tale
of her doings was known to everyone. It was circulated in the first
place, no doubt, by Lilith Gordon, who bore her a grudge for her
offer to accompany the song: had Laura not put herself forward in
this objectionable way, Lilith might have escaped singing
altogether. Lilith also resented her having shown that she could do
it&mdash;and this feeling was generally shared. It evidenced a want
of good-fellowship, and made you very glad the little prig had
afterwards come to grief: if you had abilities that others had not
you concealed them, instead of parading them under people's
noses.</p>

<p>In short, Laura had committed a twofold breach of school
etiquette. No one of course vouchsafed to explain this to her;
these things one did not put into words, things you were expected
to know without telling. Hence, she never more than half understood
what she had done. She only saw disapproval painted on faces that
had hitherto been neutral, and from one or two quarters got what
was unmistakably the cold shoulder. Her little beginnings at
popularity had somehow received a setback, and through her own
foolish behaviour.</p>

<h2>X.</h2>

<p>The lesson went home; Laura began to model herself more and more
on those around her; to grasp that the unpardonable sin is to vary
from the common mould.</p>

<p>In August, after the midwinter holidays, she was promoted to the
second class; she began Latin; and as a reward was allowed by
Mother to wear her dresses an inch below her knees. She became a
quick, adaptable pupil, with a parrot-like memory, and at the end
of the school year delighted Mother's heart with a couple of highly
gilt volumes, of negligible contents.</p>

<p>At home, during those first holidays, she gave her sister and
brothers cold creeps down their spines, with her stories of the
great doings that took place at school; and none of her class-mates
would have recognised in this arrant drawer-of-the-long-bow, the
unlucky little blunderbuss of the early days.</p>

<p>On her return, Laura's circle of friends was enlarged. The
morning after her arrival, on entering the dining-hall, she found a
new girl standing shy and awkward before the fireplace. This was
the daughter of a millionaire squatter named Macnamara; and the
report of her father's wealth had preceded her. Yet here she now
had to hang about, alone, unhappy, the target of all eyes. It might
be supposed that Laura would feel some sympathy for her, having so
recently undergone the same experience herself. But that was not
her way. She rejoiced, in barbarian fashion, that this girl, older
than she by about a year, and of a higher social standing, should
have to endure a like ordeal. Staring heartlessly, she accentuated
her part of old girl knowing all the ropes, and was so inclined to
show off that she let herself in for a snub from Miss
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Tilly Macnamara joined Laura's class, and the two were soon good
friends.</p>

<p>Tilly was a short, plump girl, with white teeth, rather boyish
hands, and the blue-grey eyes predominant in Australia. She was
usually dressed in silk, and she never wore an apron to protect the
front of her frock. Naturally, too, she had a bottomless supply of
pocket-money: if a subscription were raised, she gave ten shillings
where others gave one; and on the Saturday holidays she flung about
with half-crowns as Laura would have been afraid to do with
pennies.</p>

<p>For the latter with her tiny dole, which had to last so and so
long, since no more was forthcoming, it was a difficult task to
move gracefully among companions none of whom knew what it meant to
be really poor. Many trivial mortifications were the result; and
countless small subterfuges had to be resorted to, to prevent it
leaking out just how paltry her allowance was.</p>

<p>But the question of money was, after all, trifling, compared
with the infinitely more important one of dress.</p>

<p>With regard to dress, Laura's troubles were manifold. It was not
only that here, too, by reason of Mother's straitened means, she
was forced to remain an outsider: that, in itself, she would have
borne lightly; for, as little girls go, she was indifferent to
finery. Had she had a couple of new frocks a year, in which she
could have been neat and unremarkable, she would have been more
than content. But, from her babyhood on, Laura&mdash;and Pin with
her&mdash;had lamented the fact that children could not go about
clad in sacks, mercifully indistinguishable one from another. For
they were the daughters of an imaginative mother, and, balked in
other outlets, this imagination had wreaked itself on their
clothing. All her short life long, Laura had suffered under a
home-made, picturesque style of dress; and she had resented, with a
violence even Mother did not gauge, this use of her young body as a
peg on which to hang fantastic garments. After her tenth birthday
she was, she thanked goodness, considered too old for the quaint
shapes beneath which Pin still groaned; but there remained the
matter of colour for Mother to sin against, and in this she seemed
to grow more intemperate year by year. Herself dressed always in
the soberest browns and blacks, she liked to see her young flock
gay as Paradise birds, lighting up a drab world; and when Mother
liked a thing, she was not given to consulting the wishes of little
people. Those were awful times when she went, say, to Melbourne,
and bought as a bargain a whole roll of cloth of an impossible
colour, which had to be utilised to the last inch; or when she
unearthed, from an old trunk, some antiquated garment to be cut up
and reshaped&mdash;a Paisley shawl, a puce ball-dress, even an old
pair of green rep curtains.</p>

<p>It was thus a heavy blow to Laura to find, on going home, that
Mother had already bought her new spring dress. In one respect all
was well: it had been made by the local dressmaker, and
consequently had not the home-made cut that Laura abhorred. But the
colour! Her heart fell to the pit of her stomach the moment she set
eyes on it, and only with difficulty did she restrain her tears.
Mother had chosen a vivid purple, of a crude, old-fashioned
shade.</p>

<p>Now, quite apart from her personal feelings, Laura had come to
know very exactly, during the few months she had been at school,
the views held by her companions on the subject of colour. No
matter how sumptuous or how simple the material of which the dress
was made, it must be dark, or of a delicate tint. Brilliancy was a
sign of vulgarity, and put the wearer outside the better circles.
Hence, at this critical juncture, when Laura was striving to ape
her fellows in all vital matters, the unpropitious advent of the
purple threatened to undo her.</p>

<p>After her first dismayed inspection, she retreated to the bottom
of the garden to give vent to her feelings.</p>

<p>"I shall never be able to wear it," she moaned. "Oh, how
<i>could</i> she buy such a thing? And I needed a new dress so
awfully, awfully much."</p>

<p>"It isn't really so bad, Laura," pleaded Pin. "It'll look
darker, I'm sure, if you've got it on&mdash;and if you don't go out
in the sun."</p>

<p>"You haven't got to wear it. It was piggish of you, Pin,
perfectly piggish! You <i>might</i> have watched what she was
buying."</p>

<p>"I did, Laura!" asseverated Pin, on the brink of tears. "There
was a nice dark brown and I said take that, you would like it
better, and she said hold your tongue, and did I think she was
going to dress you as if you were your own grandmother."</p>

<p>This dress hung for weeks in the most private corner of Laura's
school wardrobe. Her companions had all returned with new outfits,
and on the first assemblage for church there was a great mustering
of one another, both by girls and teachers. Laura was the only one
to descend in the dress she had worn throughout the winter. Her
heart was sore with bitterness, and when the handful of
Episcopalians were marching to St Stephen's-on-the-Hill, she strove
to soothe her own wound.</p>

<p>"I can't think why my dress hasn't come," she said gratuitously,
out of this hurt, with an oblique glance to see how her partner
took the remark: it was the good-natured Maria Morell, who was
resplendent in velvet and feathers. "I expect that stupid
dressmaker couldn't get it done in time. I've waited for it all the
week."</p>

<p>"What a sell!" said Maria, but with mediocre interest; for she
had cocked her eye at a harmless-looking youth, who was doing his
best not to blush on passing the line of girls. "I say, do look at
that toff making eyes. Isn't he a nanny-goat."</p>

<p>On several subsequent Sundays, Laura fingered, in an agony of
indecision, the pleasing stuff of the dress, and ruefully
considered its modish cut. Once, no one being present, she even
took it out of the wardrobe. But the merciless spring sunshine
seemed to make the purple shoot fire, to let loose a host of other
colours it in as well, and, with a shudder, she re-hung it on its
peg.</p>

<p>But the evil day came. After a holiday at Godmother's, she
received a hot letter from Mother. Godmother had complained of her
looking "dowdy", and Mother was exceedingly cross. Laura was
ordered to spend the coming Saturday as well at Prahran, and in her
new dress, under penalty of a correspondence with Mrs. Gurley.
There was no going against an order of this kind, and with death at
her heart Laura prepared to obey. On the fatal morning she dawdled
as long as possible over her mending, thus postponing dressing to
go out till the others had vacated the bedroom; where, in order not
to be forced to see herself, she kept her eyes half shut, and
turned the looking-glass hind-before. Although it was a warm day,
she hung a cloak over her shoulders. But her arms peeped out of the
loose sleeves, and at least a foot of skirt was visible. As she
walked along the corridor and down the stairs, she seemed to smudge
the place with colour, and, directly she entered the dining-hall,
comet-like she drew all eyes upon her. Astonished titterings
followed in her wake; even the teachers goggled her, afterwards to
put their heads together. In the reception-room Marina remarked at
once: "Hullo!&mdash;is <i>this</i> the new dress your mother wrote
us about?"</p>

<p>Outside, things were no better; the very tram-conductors were
fascinated by it; and every passer-by was a fresh object of dread:
Laura waited, her heart a-thump, for the moment when he should
raise his eyes and, with a start of attention, become aware of the
screaming colour. At Godmother's all the faces disapproved:
Georgina said, "What a guy!" when she thought Laura was out of
earshot; but the boys stated their opinion openly as soon as they
had her to themselves.</p>

<p>"Oh, golly! Like a parrot&mdash;ain't she?"</p>

<p>"This way to the purple parrot&mdash;this way! Step up, ladies
and gentlemen! A penny the whole show!"</p>

<p>That evening, she tore the dress from her back and, hanging it
up inside the cloak, vowed that, come what might, she would never
put it on again. A day or two later, on unexpectedly entering her
bedroom, she found Lilith Gordon and another girl at her wardrobe.
They grew very red, and hurried giggling from the room, but Laura
had seen what they were looking at. After this, she tied the dress
up with string and brown paper and hid it in a drawer, under her
nightgowns. When she went home at Christmas it went with her, still
in the parcel, and then there was a stormy scene. But Laura was
stubborn: rather than wear the dress, she would not go back to the
College at all. Mother's heart had been softened by the prizes;
Laura seized the occasion, and extracted a promise that she should
be allowed in future to choose her own frocks. And so the purple
dress was passed on to Pin, who detested it with equal heartiness,
but, living under Mother's eye, had not the spirit to fight against
it.</p>

<p>"Got anything new in the way of clothes?" asked Lilith Gordon as
she and Laura undressed for bed a night or two after their
return.</p>

<p>"Yes, one," said Laura shortly. For she thought Lilith winked at
the third girl, a publican's daughter from Clunes.</p>

<p>"Another like the last? Or have you gone in for yellow ochre
this time?"</p>

<p>Laura flamed in silence.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, what a colour that was! Fit for an Easter
Fair&mdash;Miss Day said so."</p>

<p>"It wasn't mine," retorted Laura passionately. "It...it belonged
to a girl I knew who died&mdash;and her mother gave it to me as a
remembrance of her&mdash;but I didn't care for it."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you did. But I say, does your mother let you
wear other people's clothes? What a rummy thing to do!"</p>

<p>She went out of the room&mdash;no doubt to spread this piece of
gossip further. Laura looked daggers after her. She was angry
enough with Lilith for having goaded her to the lie, but much
angrier with herself for its blundering ineffectualness. It was not
likely she had been believed, and if she were, well, it made
matters worse instead of better: people would conclude that she
lived on charity. Always when unexpectedly required to stand on the
defensive, she said or did something foolish. That morning, for
instance, a similar thing had happened&mdash;it had rankled all day
in her mind. On looking through the washing, Miss Day had exclaimed
in horror at the way in which her stockings were mended.</p>

<p>"Whoever did it? They've been done since you left here. I would
never have passed such dams."</p>

<p>Laura crimsoned. "Those? Oh, an old nurse we've got at home.
We've had her for years and years&mdash;but her eyesight's going
now."</p>

<p>Miss Day sniffed audibly. "So I should think. To cobble like
that!"</p>

<p>They were Mother's dams, hastily made, late at night, and with
all Mother's genial impatience at useful sewing as opposed to
beautiful. Laura's intention had been to shield Mother from
criticism, as well as to spare Miss Day's feelings. But to have
done it so clumsily as this! To have had to wince under Miss Day's
scepticism! It was only a wonder the governess had not there and
then taxed her with the fib. For who believed in old nurses
nowadays? They were a stock property, borrowed on the spur of the
moment from readings in <i>The Family Herald</i>, from Tennyson's
<i>Lady Clare</i>. Why on earth had such a far-fetched excuse leapt
to her tongue? Why could she not have said Sarah, the servant, the
maid-of-all-work? Then Miss Day would have had no chance to sniff,
and she, Laura, could have believed herself believed, instead of
having to fret over her own stupidity. But what she would like more
than anything to know was, why the mending of the stockings at home
should <i>not</i> be Sarah's work? Why must it just be
Mother&mdash;her mother alone&mdash;who made herself so
disagreeably conspicuous, and not merely by darning the stockings,
but, what was a still greater grievance, by not even darning them
well?</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>

<p>It was an odd thing, all the same, how easy it was to be friends
with Lilith Gordon: though she did not belong to Laura's set though
Laura did not even like her, and though she had had ample proof
that Lilith was double-faced, not to be trusted. Yet, in the months
that followed the affair of the purple dress, Laura grew more
intimate with the plump, sandy-haired girl than with either Bertha,
or Inez, or Tilly. Or, to put it more exactly, she was continually
having lapses into intimacy, and repenting them when it was too
late. In one way Lilith was responsible for this: she could make
herself very pleasant when she chose, seem to be your friend
through thick and thin, thus luring you on to unbosom yourself; and
afterwards she would go away and laugh over what you had told her,
with other girls. And Laura was peculiarly helpless under such
circumstances: if it was done with tact, and with a certain assumed
warmth of manner, anyone could make a cat's-paw of her.</p>

<p>That Lilith and she undressed for bed together had also
something to do with their intimacy: this half-hour when one's hair
was unbound and replaited, and fat and thin arms wielded the brush,
was the time of all others for confidences. The governess who
occupied the fourth bed did not come upstairs till ten o'clock; the
publican's daughter, a lazy girl, was usually half asleep before
the other two had their clothes off.</p>

<p>It was in the course of one of these confidential chats that
Laura did a very foolish thing. In a moment of weakness, she
gratuitously gave away the secret that Mother supported her family
by the work of her hands.</p>

<p>The two girls were sitting on the side of Lilith's bed. Laura
had a day of mishaps behind her&mdash;that partly, no doubt,
accounted for her self-indulgence. But, in addition, her companion
had just told her, unasked, that she thought her "very pretty". It
was not in Laura's nature to let this pass: she was never at ease
under an obligation; she had to pay the coin back in kind.</p>

<p>"Embroidery? What sort? However does she do it?"&mdash;Lilith's
interest was on tiptoe at once&mdash;a false and slimy interest,
the victim afterwards told herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother's awfully clever. It's just lovely, too, what she
does&mdash;all in silk&mdash;and ever so many different colours.
She made a piano-cover once, and got fifty pounds for it."</p>

<p>"How perfectly splendid!"</p>

<p>"But that was only a lucky chance...that she got that to do. She
mostly does children's dresses and cloaks and things like
that."</p>

<p>"But she's not a dressmaker, is she?"</p>

<p>"A dressmaker? I should think not indeed! They're sent up, all
ready to work, from the biggest shops in town."</p>

<p>"I say!&mdash;she must be clever."</p>

<p>"She is; she can do anything. She makes the patterns up all out
of her own head. "&mdash;And filled with pride in Mother's
accomplishments and Lilith's appreciation of them, Laura fell
asleep that night without a qualm.</p>

<p>It was the next evening. Several of the boarders who had
finished preparing their lessons were loitering in the dining-hall,
Laura and Lilith among them. In the group was a girl called Lucy,
young but very saucy; for she lived at Toorak, and came of one of
the best families in Melbourne. She was not as old as Laura by two
years, but was already feared and respected for the fine scorn of
her opinions.</p>

<p>Lilith Gordon had bragged: "My uncle's promised me a gold watch
and chain when I pass matric."</p>

<p>Lucy of Toorak laughed: her nose came down, and her mouth went
up at the corners. "Do you think you ever will?"</p>

<p>"G. o. k. and He won't tell. But I'll probably get the watch all
the same."</p>

<p>"Where does your uncle hang out?"</p>

<p>"Brisbane."</p>

<p>"Sure he can afford to buy it?"</p>

<p>"Of course he can."</p>

<p>"What is he?"</p>

<p>Lilith was unlucky enough to hesitate, ever so slightly. "Oh,
he's got plenty of money," she asserted.</p>

<p>"She doesn't like to say what he is!"</p>

<p>"I don't care whether I say it or not."</p>

<p>"A butcher, p'raps, or an undertaker?"</p>

<p>"A butcher! He's got the biggest newspaper in Brisbane!"</p>

<p>"A newspaper! Great Scott! Her uncle keeps a newspaper!"</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter from those standing round.</p>

<p>Lilith was scarlet now. "It's nothing to be ashamed of," she
said angrily.</p>

<p>But Lucy of Toorak could not recover from her amusement. "An
uncle who keeps a newspaper! A newspaper! Well, I'm glad none of
<i>my</i> uncles are so rummy. I say, does he leave it at front
doors himself in the morning?"</p>

<p>Laura had at first looked passively on, well pleased to see
another than herself the butt of young Lucy's wit. But at this
stage of her existence she was too intent on currying favour, to
side with any but the stronger party. And so she joined in the
boisterous mirth Lilith's admission and Lucy's reception of it
excited, and flung her gibes with the rest.</p>

<p>She was pulled up short by a hissing in her ear. "If you say one
word more, I'll tell about the embroidery!"</p>

<p>Laura went pale with fright: she had been in good spirits that
day, and had quite forgotten her silly confidence of the night
before. Now, the jeer that was on the tip of her tongue hung fire.
She could not all at once obliterate her smile&mdash;that would
have been noticeable; but it grew weaker, stiffer and more
unnatural, then gradually faded away, leaving her with a very
solemn little face.</p>

<p>From this night on, Lilith Gordon represented a powder-mine,
which might explode at any minute. And she herself had laid the
train!</p>

<p>From the outset, Laura had been accepted, socially, by even the
most exclusive, as one of themselves; and this, in spite of her
niggardly allowance, her ridiculous clothes. For the child had race
in her: in a well-set head, in good hands and feet and ears. Her
nose, too, had a very pronounced droop, which could stand only for
blue blood, or a Hebraic ancestor&mdash;and Jews were not received
as boarders in the school. Now, loud as money made itself in this
young community, effectual as it was in cloaking shortcomings, it
did not go all the way: inherited instincts and traditions were not
so easily subdued. Just some of the wealthiest, too, were aware
that their antecedents would not stand a close scrutiny; and thus a
mighty respect was engendered in them for those who had nothing to
fear. Moreover, directly you got away from the vastly rich, class
distinctions were observed with an exactitude such as can only
obtain in an exceedingly mixed society. The three professions alone
were sacrosanct. The calling of architect, for example, or of civil
engineer, was, if a fortune had not been accumulated, utterly
without prestige; trade, any connection with trade&mdash;the merest
bowing acquaintance with buying and selling&mdash;was a taint that
nothing could remove; and those girls who were related to
shopkeepers, or, more awful still, to publicans, would rather have
bitten their tongues off than have owned to the disgrace.</p>

<p>Yet Laura knew very well that good birth and an aristocratic
appearance would not avail her, did the damaging fact leak out that
Mother worked for her living. Work in itself was bad
enough&mdash;how greatly to be envied were those whose fathers did
nothing more active than live on their money! But the additional
circumstance of Mother being a woman made things ten times worse:
ladies did not work; some one always left them enough to live on,
and if he didn't, well, then he, too, shared the ignominy. So Laura
went in fear and trembling lest the truth should come to
light&mdash;in that case, she would be a pariah indeed&mdash;went
in hourly dread of Lilith betraying her. Nothing, however,
happened&mdash;at least as far as she could discover&mdash;and she
sought to propitiate Lilith in every possible way. For the time
being, though, anxiety turned her into a porcupine, ready to erect
her quills at a touch. She was ever on the look-out for an allusion
to her mother's position, and for the slight that was bound to
accompany it.</p>

<p>Even the governesses noticed the change in her.</p>

<p>Three of them sat one evening round the fire in Mrs. Gurley's
sitting-room, with their feet on the fender. The girls had gone to
bed; it was Mrs. Gurley's night off, and as Miss Day was also on
leave, the three who were left could draw in more closely than
usual. Miss Snodgrass had made the bread into toast&mdash;in spite
of Miss Chapman's quakings lest Mrs. Gurley should notice the smell
when she came in&mdash;and, as they munched, Miss Snodgrass related
how she had just confiscated a book Laura Rambotham was trying to
smuggle upstairs, and how it had turned out that it belonged, not
to Laura herself, but to Lilith Gordon.</p>

<p>"She was like a little spitfire about it all the same. A most
objectionable child, I call her. It was only yesterday I wanted to
look at some embroidery on her apron&mdash;a rather pretty new
stitch&mdash;and do you think she'd let me see it? She jerked it
away and glared at me as if she would have liked to eat me. I could
have boxed her ears."</p>

<p>"I never have any trouble with Laura. I don't think you know how
to manage her," said Miss Chapman, and executed a little manoeuvre.
She had poor teeth; and, having awaited a moment when Miss
Snodgrass's sharp eyes were elsewhere engaged, she surreptitiously
dropped the crusts of the toast into her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I'd be sorry to treat her as you do," said Miss Snodgrass, and
yawned. "Girls need to be made to sit up nowadays."</p>

<p>She yawned again, and gazing round the room for fresh food for
talk, caught Miss Zielinski with her eye. "Hullo, Ziely, what are
you deep in?" She put her arm round the other's neck, and
unceremoniously laid hold of her book. "You naughty girl, you're at
Ouida again! Always got your nose stuck in some trashy novel."</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> let me alone," said Miss Zielinski pettishly, holding
fast to the book; but she did not raise her eyes, for they were
wet.</p>

<p>"You know you'll count the washing all wrong again to-morrow,
your head'll be so full of that stuff."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's time to go, girls; to-morrow's Saturday." And Miss
Chapman sighed; for, on a Saturday morning between six and eight
o'clock, fifty-five lots of washing had to be sorted out and
arranged in piles.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses, what a life!" ejaculated Miss Snodgrass, and yawned
again, in a kind of furious desperation. "I swear I'll marry the
first man that asks me, to get away from it. As long as he has
money enough to keep me decently."</p>

<p>"You would soon wish yourself back, if you had no more feeling
for him that that," reproved Miss Chapman.</p>

<p>"Catch me! Not even if he had a hump, or kept a mistress, or was
over eighty. Oh dear, oh dear!"&mdash;she stretched herself so
violently that her bones cracked; to resume, in a tone of ordinary
conversation: "I do wish I knew whether to put a brown wing or a
green one in that blessed hat of mine."</p>

<p>Miss Chapman's face straightened out from its shocked
expression. "Your hat? Why do you want to change it? It's very nice
as it is."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Chapman, it's at least six months out of date.
Ziely, you're crying!"</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Miss Zielinski weakly, caught in the act of
blowing her nose.</p>

<p>"How on earth can you cry over a book? As if it were true!"</p>

<p>"I thank God I haven't such a cold heart as you."</p>

<p>"And I thank God I'm not a romantic idiot. But your name's not
Thekla for nothing I suppose."</p>

<p>"My name's as good as yours. And I won't be looked down on
because my father was once a German."</p>

<p>"'Mr. Kayser, do you vant to buy a dawg?'" hummed Miss
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>"Girls, girls!" admonished Miss Chapman. "How you two do bicker.
There, that's Mrs. Gurley now! And it's long past ten."</p>

<p>At the creaking of the front door both juniors rose, gathered
their belongings together, and hurried from the room. But it was a
false alarm; and having picked up some crumbs and set the chairs in
order, Miss Chapman resumed her seat. As she waited, she looked
about her and wondered, with a sigh, whether it would ever be her
good fortune to call this cheery little room her own. It was only
at moments like the present that she could indulge such a dream.
Did Mrs. Gurley stand before her, majestic in bonnet and mantle, as
in a minute or two she would, or draped in her great shawl,
thoughts of this kind sank to their proper level, and Miss Chapman
knew them for what they were worth. But sitting alone by night, her
chin in her hand, her eyes on the dying fire, around her the eerie
stillness of the great house, her ambition did not seem wholly out
of reach; and, giving rein to her fancy, she could picture herself
sweeping through halls and rooms, issuing orders that it was the
business of others to fulfil, could even think out a few changes
that should be made, were she head of the staff.</p>

<p>But the insertion of Mrs. Gurley's key in the lock, the sound of
her foot on the oilcloth, was enough to waken a sense of guilt in
Miss Chapman, and make her start to her feet&mdash;the drab,
elderly, apologetic governess once more.</p>

<h2>XII.</h2>

<blockquote>Da regiert der Nachbar, da <i>wird</i> man Nachbar.<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>You might regulate your outward habit to the last button of what
you were expected to wear; you might conceal the tiny flaws and
shuffle over the big improprieties in your home life, which were
likely to damage your value in the eyes of your companions; you
might, in brief, march in the strictest order along the narrow road
laid down for you by these young lawgivers, keeping perfect step
and time with them: yet of what use were all your pains, if you
could not marshal your thoughts and feelings&mdash;the very realest
part of you&mdash;in rank and file as well?...if these persisted in
escaping control?&mdash;Such was the question which, about this
time, began to present itself to Laura's mind.</p>

<p>It first took form on the day Miss Blount, the secretary, popped
her head in at the door and announced: "At half-past three, Class
Two to Number One."</p>

<p>Class Two was taking a lesson in elocution: that is to say Mr.
Repton, the visiting-master for this branch of study, was reading
aloud, in a sonorous voice, a chapter of <i>Handy Andy</i>. He
underlined his points heavily, and his hearers, like the
self-conscious, emotionally shy young colonials they were, felt
half amused by, half-superior to the histrionic display. They
lounged in easy, ungraceful postures while he read, reclining one
against another, or sprawling forward over the desks, their heads
on their arms. It was the first hour after dinner, when one's
thoughts were sleepy and stupid, and Mr. Repton was not a pattern
disciplinarian; but the general abandonment of attitude had another
ground as well. It had to do with the shape of the master's legs.
These were the object of an enthusiastic admiration. They were
generally admitted to be the handsomest in the school, and those
girls were thought lucky who could get the best view of them
beneath the desk. Moreover, the rumour ran that Mr. Repton had once
been an actor&mdash;his very curly hair no doubt lent weight to the
report&mdash;and Class Two was fond of picturing the comely limbs
in the tights of a Hamlet or Othello. It also, of course, invented
for him a lurid life outside the College
walls&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that he and his sonsy wife sat
opposite the boarders in church every Sunday morning, the
embodiment of the virtuous commonplace; and whenever he looked at a
pupil, every time he singled one of them out for special notice, he
was believed to have an ulterior motive, his words were construed
into meaning something they should not mean: so that the poor man
was often genuinely puzzled by the reception of his friendly
overtures. Such was Class Two's youthful contribution to the
romance of school life.</p>

<p>On this particular day, however, the sudden, short snap of the
secretary's announcement that, instead of dispersing at half-past
three, the entire school was to reassemble, galvanised the class.
Glances of mingled apprehension and excitement flew round; eyes
telegraphed vigorous messages; and there was little attention left
for well-shaped members, or for the antics of Handy Andy under his
mother's bed.</p>

<p>But when the hour came, and all classes were moving in the same
direction, verandahs and corridors one seething mass of girls, it
was the excitement that prevailed. For any break was welcome in the
uniformity of the days; and the nervous tension now felt was no
more disagreeable, at bottom, than was the pleasant trepidation
experienced of old by those who went to be present at a
hanging.</p>

<p>In the course of the past weeks a number of petty thefts had
been committed. Day-scholars who left small sums of money in their
jacket pockets would find, on returning to the cloakrooms, that
these had been pilfered. For a time, the losses were borne in
silence, because of the reluctance inherent in young girls to
making a fuss. But when shillings began to vanish in the same
fashion, and once even half-a-crown was missing, it was recognised
that the thing must be put a stop to; and one bolder than the rest,
and with a stronger sense of public morality, lodged a complaint.
Investigations were made, a trap was set, and the thief discovered.
The school was now assembled to see justice done.</p>

<p>The great room was fuller even than at morning prayers; for then
there was always an unpunctual minority. A crowd of girls who had
not been able to find seats was massed together at the further end.
As at prayers, visiting and resident teachers stood in a line, with
their backs to the high windows; they were ranged in order of
precedence, topped by Dr Pughson, who stood next Mr. Strachey's
desk. All alike wore blank, stern faces.</p>

<p>In one of the rows of desks for two&mdash;blackened, ink-scored,
dusty desks, with eternally dry ink-wells&mdash;sat Laura and
Tilly, behind them Inez and Bertha. The cheeks of the four were
flushed. But, while the others only whispered and wondered, Laura
was on the tiptoe of expectation. She could not get her breath
properly, and her hands and feet were cold. Twisting her fingers,
in and out, she moistened her lips with her tongue. When, oh, when
would it begin?</p>

<p>These few foregoing minutes were the most trying of any. For
when, in an ominous hush, Mr. Strachey entered and strode to his
desk, Laura suddenly grew calm, and could take note of everything
that passed.</p>

<p>The Principal raised his hand, to enjoin a silence that was
already absolute.</p>

<p>"Will Miss Johns stand up!"</p>

<p>At these words, spoken in a low, impressive tone, Bertha burst
into tears and hid her face in her handkerchief. Hundreds of eyes
sought the unhappy culprit as she rose, then to be cast down and
remain glued to the floor.</p>

<p>The girl stood, pale and silly-looking, and stared at Mr.
Strachey much as a rabbit stares at the snake that is about to eat
it. She was a very ugly girl of fourteen, with a pasty face, and
lank hair that dangled to her shoulders. Her mouth had fallen half
open through fear, and she did not shut it all the time she was on
view.</p>

<p>Laura could not take her eyes off the scene: they travelled,
burning with curiosity, from Annie Johns to Mr. Strachey, and back
again to the miserable thief. When, after a few introductory
remarks on crime in general, the Principal passed on to the present
case, and described it in detail, Laura was fascinated by his
oratory, and gazed full at him. He made it all live vividly before
her; she hung on his lips, appreciating his points, the skilful way
in which he worked up his climaxes. But then, she herself knew what
it was to be poor&mdash;as Annie Johns had been. She understood
what it would mean to lack your tram-fare on a rainy
morning&mdash;according to Mr. Strachey this was the motor impulse
of the thefts&mdash;because a lolly shop had stretched out its
octopus arms after you. She could imagine, too, with a shiver, how
easy it would be, the loss of the first pennies having remained
undiscovered, to go on to threepenny-bits, and from these to
sixpences. More particularly since the money had been taken,
without exception, from pockets in which there was plenty. Not,
Laura felt sure, in order to avoid detection, as Mr. Strachey
supposed, but because to those who had so much a few odd coins
could not matter. She wondered if everyone else agreed with him on
this point. How did the teachers feel about it?&mdash;and she ran
her eyes over the row, to learn their opinions from their faces.
But these were as stolid as ever. Only good old Chapman, she
thought, looked a little sorry, and Miss Zielinski&mdash;yes, Miss
Zielinski was crying! This discovery thrilled Laura&mdash;just as,
at the play, the fact of one spectator being moved to tears
intensifies his neighbour's enjoyment. But when Mr. Strachey left
the field of personal narration and went on to the moral aspects of
the affair, Laura ceased to be gripped by him, and turned anew to
study the pale, dogged face of the accused, though she had to crane
her neck to do it. Before such a stony mask as this, she was driven
to imagine what must be going on behind it; and, while thus
engrossed, she felt her arm angrily tweaked. It was Tilly.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a beast to stare like that!"</p>

<p>"I'm not staring."</p>

<p>She turned her eyes away at once, more than half believing her
own words; and then, for some seconds, she tried to do what was
expected of her: to feel a decent unconcern. At her back, Bertha's
purry crying went steadily on. What on earth did she cry for? She
had certainly not heard a word Mr. Strachey said. Laura fidgeted in
her seat, and stole a sideglance at Tilly's profile. She could not,
really could not miss the last scene of all, when, in masterly
fashion, the Principal was gathering the threads together. And so,
feeling rather like "Peeping Tom", she cautiously raised her eyes
again, and this time managed to use them without turning her
head.</p>

<p>All other eyes were still charitably lowered. Several girls were
crying now, but without a sound. And, as the last, awful moments
drew near, even Bertha was hushed, and of all the odd hundreds of
throats not one dared to cough. Laura's heart began to palpitate,
for she felt the approach of the final climax, Mr. Strachey's
periods growing ever slower and more massive.</p>

<p>When, after a burst of eloquence which, the child felt, would
not have shamed a Bishop, the Principal drew himself up to his full
height, and, with uplifted arm, thundered forth: "Herewith, Miss
Annie Johns, I publicly expel you from the school! Leave it, now,
this moment, and never darken its doors again!"&mdash;when this
happened, Laura was shot through by an ecstatic quiver, such as she
had felt once only in her life before; and that was when a
beautiful, golden-haired Hamlet, who had held a Ballarat theatre
entranced for a whole evening, fell dead by Laertes' sword, to the
rousing plaudits of the house. Breathing unevenly, she watched,
lynx-eyed, every inch of Annie Johns' progress: watched her pick up
her books, edge out of her seat and sidle through the rows of
desks; watched her walk to the door with short jerky movements,
mount the two steps that led to it, fumble with the handle, turn
it, and vanish from sight; and when it was all over, and there was
nothing more to see, she fell back in her seat with an audible
sigh.</p>

<p>It was too late after this for the winding of the snaky line
about the streets and parks of East Melbourne, which constituted
the boarders' daily exercise. They were despatched to stretch their
legs in the garden. Here, as they walked round lawns and
tennis-courts, they discussed the main event of the afternoon, and
were a little more vociferous than usual, in an attempt to shake
off the remembrance of a very unpleasant half-hour.</p>

<p>"I bet you Sandy rather enjoyed kicking up that shindy."</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> you see Puggy's boots again? Girls, he <i>must</i>
take twelves!"</p>

<p>"And that old blubber of a Ziely's handkerchief! It was filthy.
I told you yesterday I was sure she never washed her neck."</p>

<p>Bertha, whose tears had dried as rapidly as sea-spray, gave
Laura a dig in the ribs. "What's up with you, old Tweedledum?
You're as glum as a lubra."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

<p>"It's my belief that Laura was sorry for that pig," threw in
Tilly.</p>

<p>"Indeed I wasn't!" said Laura indignantly.</p>

<p>"Sorry for a thief?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I <i>wasn't</i>!"&mdash;and this was true. Among the
divers feelings Laura had experienced that afternoon, pity had not
been included.</p>

<p>"If you want to be chums with such a mangy beast, you'd better
go to school in a lock-up."</p>

<p>"I don't know what my father'd say, if he knew I'd been in the
same class as a pickpocket," said the daughter of a minister from
Brisbane. "I guess he wouldn't have let me stop here a week."</p>

<p>Laura went one better. "My mother wouldn't have let me stop a
day."</p>

<p>Those standing by laughed, and a girl from the Riverina said:
"Oh, no, of course not!" in a tone that made Laura wince and regret
her readiness.</p>

<p>Before tea, she had to practise. The piano stood in an outside
classroom, where no one could hear whether she was diligent or
idle, and she soon gave up playing and went to the window. Here,
having dusted the gritty sill with her petticoat, she leaned her
chin on her two palms and stared out into the sunbaked garden. It
was empty now, and very still. The streets that lay behind the high
palings were deserted in the drowsy heat; the only sound to be
heard was a gentle tinkling to vespers in the neighbouring Catholic
Seminary. Leaning thus on her elbows, and balancing herself first
on her heels, then on her toes, Laura went on, in desultory
fashion, with the thoughts that had been set in motion during the
afternoon. She wondered where Annie Johns was now, and what she was
doing; wondered how she had faced her mother, and what her father
had said to her. All the rest of them had gone back at once to
their everyday life; Annie Johns alone was cut adrift. What would
happen to her? Would she perhaps be turned out of the house?...into
the streets?&mdash;and Laura had a lively vision of the guilty
creature, in rags and tatters, slinking along walls and sleeping
under bridges, eternally moved on by a ruthless London policeman
(her only knowledge of extreme destitution being derived from the
woeful tale of "Little Jo"). And to think that the beginning of it
all had been the want of a trumpery tram-fare. How safe the other
girls were! No wonder they could allow themselves to feel shocked
and outraged; none of <i>them</i> knew what it was not to have
threepence in your pocket. While she, Laura...Yes, and it must be
this same incriminating acquaintance with poverty that made her
feel differently about Annie Johns and what she had done. For her
feelings <i>had</i> been different&mdash;there was no denying that.
Did she now think back over the half-hour spent in Number One, and
act honest Injun with herself, she had to admit that her
companions' indignant and horrified aversion to the crime had not
been hers, let alone their decent indifference towards the
criminal. No, to be candid, she had been deeply interested in the
whole affair, had even managed to extract an unseemly amount of
entertainment from it. And that, of course, should not have been.
It was partly Mr. Strachey's fault, for making it so dramatic; but
none the less she genuinely despised herself, for having such a
queer inside.</p>

<p>"Pig&mdash;pig&mdash;pig!" she muttered under her breath, and
wrinkled her nose in a grimace.</p>

<p>The real reason of her pleasurable absorption was, she supposed,
that she had understood Annie Johns' motive better than anyone
else. Well, she had had no business to understand&mdash;that was
the long and the short of it: nice-minded girls found such a thing
impossible, and turned incuriously away. And her companions had
been quick to recognise her difference of attitude, or they would
never have dared to accuse her of sympathy with the thief, or to
doubt her chorusing assertion with a sneer. For them, the gap was
not very wide between understanding and doing likewise. And they
were certainly right. Oh! the last wish in the world she had was to
range herself on the side of the sinner; she longed to see eye to
eye with her comrades&mdash;if she had only known how to do it. For
there was no saying where it might lead you, if you persisted in
having odd and peculiar notions; you might even end by being wicked
yourself. Let her take a lesson in time from Annie's fate. For,
beginning perhaps with ideas that were no more unlike those of her
schoolfellows than were Laura's own, Annie was now a branded thief
and an outcast. And the child's feelings, as she stood at the
window, were not very far removed from prayer. Had they found
words, they would have taken the form of an entreaty that she might
be preserved from having thoughts that were different from other
people's; that she might be made to feel as she ought to feel, in a
proper, ladylike way&mdash;and especially did she see a companion
convicted of crime.</p>

<p>Below all this, in subconscious depths, a chord of fear seemed
to have been struck in her as well&mdash;the fear of stony faces,
drooped lids, and stretched, pointing fingers. For that night she
started up, with a cry, from dreaming that not Annie Johns but she
was being expelled; that an army of spear-like first fingers was
marching towards her, and that, try as she would, she could not get
her limp, heavy legs to bear her to the schoolroom door.</p>

<p>And this dream often returned.</p>

<h2>XIII.</h2>

<p>On her honourable promotion the following Christmas&mdash;she
mounted two forms this time&mdash;Laura was a thin, middle-sized
girl of thirteen, who still did not look her age. The curls had
vanished. In their place hung a long, dark plait, which she bound
by choice with a red ribbon.</p>

<p>Tilly was the only one of her intimates who skipped a class with
her; hence she was thrown more exclusively than before on Tilly's
companionship; for it was a melancholy fact: if you were not in the
same class as the girl who was your friend, your interests and hers
were soon fatally sundered. On their former companions, Tilly and
Laura, from their new perch, could not but look down: the two had
masters now for all subjects; Euclid loomed large; Latin was no
longer bounded by the First Principia; and they fussed
considerably, in the others' hearing, over the difficulties of the
little blue books that began: <i>Gallia est omnis divisa in partes
tres</i>.</p>

<p>In the beginning, they held very close together; for their new
fellows were inclined to stand on their dignity with the pair of
interlopers from Class Two. They were all older than Tilly and
Laura, and thought themselves wiser: here were girls of sixteen and
seventeen years of age, some of whom would progress no farther
along the high-road of education. As for the boarders who sat in
this form, they made up a jealous little clique, and it was some
time before the younger couple could discover the secret bond.</p>

<p>Then, one morning, the two were sitting with a few others on the
verandah bench, looking over their lessons for the day. Mrs. Gurley
had snatched a moment's rest there, on her way to the secretary's
office, and as long as she allowed her withering eye to play upon
things and people, the girls conned their pages with a great show
of industry. But no sooner had she sailed away than Kate Horner
leant forward and called to Maria Morell, who was at the other end
of the seat: "I say, Maria, Genesis LI, 32."&mdash;She held an open
Bible in her hand.</p>

<p>Maria Morell frowned caution. "Dash it, Kate, mind those
kids!"</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't savvy."</p>

<p>But Laura's eyes were saucers of curiosity, for Tilly, who kept
her long lashes lowered, had given her a furious nudge. With a wink
and a beck to each other, the bigger girls got up and went
away.</p>

<p>"I say, what did you poke me so hard for?" inquired Laura as she
and Tilly followed in their wake, at the clanging of the public
prayer-bell.</p>

<p>"You soft, didn't you hear what she said?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did"&mdash;and Laura repeated the reference.</p>

<p>"Let's look it up then." Under cover of the prayer Tilly sought
it out, and together they bent their heads over it.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Tilly was more knowing than Laura; but on this
alone; for when Laura once grasped what they were driving at, she
was as nimble-witted as any.</p>

<p>Only a day or two later it was she who, in face of Kate and
Maria, invited Tilly to turn up chapter and verse.</p>

<p>Both the elder girls burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"By dad!" cried Kate Horner, and smacked her thigh. "This kid
knows a thing or two."</p>

<p>"You bet! I told you she wasn't born yesterday."&mdash;And Maria
laid her arm round Laura's shoulders.</p>

<p>Thus was Laura encouraged, put on her mettle; and soon there was
no more audacious Bible-reader in the class than she.</p>

<p>The girls were thrown thus upon the Book of Books for their
contraband knowledge, since it was the only frankly outspoken piece
of literature allowed within the College walls: the classics
studied were rigidly expurgated; the school library was kept so
dull that no one over the age of ten much cared to borrow a volume
from it. And, by fair means or unfair, it was necessary to obtain
information on matters of sex; for girls most of whom were well
across the threshold of womanhood the subject had an invincible
fascination.</p>

<p>Such knowledge as they possessed was a strange jumble, picked up
at random: in one direction they were well primed; in another,
supremely ignorant. Thus, though they received lectures on what was
called "Physiology", and for these were required to commit to
memory the name of every bone and artery in the body, yet all that
related to a woman's special organs and chief natural function was
studiously ignored. The subject being thus chastely shrouded in
mystery, they were thrown back on guesswork and
speculation&mdash;with the quaintest results. The fancies woven by
quite big girls, for instance, round the physical feat of bringing
a child into the world, would have supplied material for a volume
of fairytales. On many a summer evening at this time, in a nook of
the garden, heads of all shades might have been seen pressed as
close together as a cluster of settled bees; and like the humming
of bees, too, were the busy whisperings and subdued buzzes of
laughter that accompanied this hot discussion of the "how"&mdash;as
a living answer to which, each of them would probably some day walk
the world. Innumerable theories were afloat, one more fantastic
than another; and the wilder the conjecture, the greater was the
respect and applause it gained.</p>

<p>On the other hand, of less profitable information they had
amassed a goodly store. Girls who came from up-country could tell a
lively tale of the artless habits of the blacks; others, who were
at home in mining towns, described the doings in Chinese
camps&mdash;those unavoidable concomitants of gold-grubbing
settlements; rhymes circulated that would have staggered a
back-blocker; while the governesses were without exception, young
and old, kindly and unkindly, laid under such flamboyant suspicions
as the poor ladies had, for certain, never heard
breathed&mdash;since their own impudent schooldays.</p>

<p>This dabbling in the illicit&mdash;it had little in common with
the opener grime of the ordinary schoolboy&mdash;did not even widen
the outlook of these girls. For it was something to hush up and
keep hidden away, to have qualms, even among themselves, about
knowing; and, like all knowledge that fungus-like shrinks from the
sun, it was stunted and unlovely. Their minds were warped by it,
their vision was distorted: viewed through its lens, the most
natural human relations appeared unnatural. Thus, not the primmest
patterns of family life could hope for mercy in their eyes; over
the family, too, man, as read by these young rigorists, was held to
leave his serpent's trail of desire.</p>

<p>For out of it all rose the vague, crude picture of woman as the
prey of man. Man was animal, a composite of lust and cruelty, with
no aim but that of brutally taking his pleasure: something
monstrous, yet to be adored; annihilating, yet to be sought after;
something to flee and, at the same time, to entice, with every art
at one's disposal.</p>

<p>As long as it was solely a question of clandestine knowledge and
ingenious surmisings, Laura went merrily with the rest: here no
barrier shut her off from her companions. Always a very inquisitive
little girl, she was now agog to learn new lore. Her mind, in this
direction, was like a clean but highly sensitised plate. And partly
because of her previous entire ignorance, partly because of her
extreme receptiveness, she soon outstripped her comrades, and
before long, was one of the most skilful improvisers of the group:
a dexterous theorist: a wicked little adept at innuendo.</p>

<p>But that was all; a step farther, and she ran her head against a
stone wall. For the invisible yeast that brought this ferment of
natural curiosity to pass, was the girls' intense interest in the
opposite sex: a penned-up interest that clamoured for an outlet; an
interest which, in the life of these prospective mothers, had
already usurped the main place. Laura, on the other hand, had so
far had scant experience of boys of a desirable age, nor any liking
for such as she had known; indeed she still held to her childish
opinion that they were "silly"&mdash;feckless creatures, in spite
of their greater strength and size&mdash;or downright disagreeable
and antagonistic, like Godmother's Erwin and Marmaduke. No breath
of their possible dangerous fascination had hitherto reached her.
Hence, an experience that came her way, at the beginning of the
autumn was of the nature of an awakening.</p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>

<p>"My cousin Bob's awfully gone on you."</p>

<p>Laura gaped at Tilly, in crimson disbelief. "But I've never
spoken to him!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't count. He's seen you in church."</p>

<p>"Go on!&mdash;you're stuffing."</p>

<p>"Word of honour!&mdash;And I've promised him to ask aunt if I
can bring you with me to lunch next Saturday."</p>

<p>Laura looked forward to this day with mixed feelings. She was
flattered at being invited to the big house in town where Tilly's
relatives lived; but she felt embarrassed at the prospect, and she
had not the least idea what a boy who was "gone" on you would
expect you to be or to do. Bob was a beautiful youth of seventeen,
tall, and dark, and slender, with milk-white teeth and Spanish
eyes; and Laura's mouth dried up when she thought of perhaps having
to be sprightly or coquettish with him.</p>

<p>On the eventful morning Tilly came to her room while she was
dressing, and eyed her critically.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, don't put on that brown hat...for mercy's sake! Bob
can't stand brown."</p>

<p>But the brown was Laura's best, and she demurred.</p>

<p>"Oh well, if you don't care to look nice, you know..."</p>

<p>Of course she did; she was burning to. She even accepted the
loan of a sash from her friend, because "Bob loves blue"; and went
out feeling odd and unlike herself, in her everyday hat and
borrowed plumes.</p>

<p>The Aunt, a pleasant, youthful-looking lady, called for them in
a white-hooded wagonette, and set them down at the house with a
playful warning.</p>

<p>"Now don't get up to any mischief, you two!"</p>

<p>"No fear!" was Tilly's genial response, as Aunt and cab drove
off.</p>

<p>They were going to "do the block", Tilly explained, and would
meet Bob there; but they must first make sure that the drive had
not disarranged their hair or the position of their hats; and she
led the way to her aunt's bedroom.</p>

<p>Laura, though she had her share of natural vanity, was too
impatient to do more than cast a perfunctory glance at her
reflected self. At this period of her life when a drive in a hired
cab was enough of a novelty to give her pleasure, a day such as the
one that lay before her filled her with unbounded anticipation.</p>

<p>She fidgeted from one leg to another while she waited. For Tilly
was in no hurry to be gone: she prinked and finicked, making lavish
use, after the little swing-glass at school, of the big mirror with
its movable wings; she examined her teeth, pulled down her
under-lids, combed her eyebrows, twisted her neck this way and
that, in an endeavour to view her person from every angle; she took
liberties with perfumes and brushes: was, in short, blind and deaf
to all but the perfecting of herself&mdash;this rather mannish
little self, which, despite a most womanly plumpness, affected a
boyish bonhomie, and emphasised the role by wearing a stiff white
collar and cuffs.</p>

<p>Laura was glad when she at last decided that she would "do", and
when they stepped out into the radiant autumn morning.</p>

<p>"What a perfectly scrumptious day!"</p>

<p>"Yes, bully. I say, <i>is</i> my waist all right?"</p>

<p>"Quite right. And ever so small."</p>

<p>"I know. I gave it an extra pull-in. Now if only we're lucky
enough to get hold of a man or two we know!"</p>

<p>The air, Australian air, met them like a prickling champagne: it
was incredibly crisp, pure, buoyant. From the top of the eastern
hill the spacious white street sloped speedily down, to run awhile
in a hollow, then mount again at the other end. Where the two girls
turned into it, it was quiet; but the farther they descended, the
fuller it grew&mdash;fuller of idlers like themselves, out to see
and to be seen.</p>

<p>Laura cocked her chin; she had not had a like sense of freedom
since being at school. And besides, was not a boy, a handsome boy,
waiting for her, and expecting her? This was the <i>clou</i> of the
day, the end for which everything was making; yet of such stuff was
Laura that she would have felt relieved, could the present moment
have been spun out indefinitely. The state of suspense was very
pleasant to her.</p>

<p>As for Tilly, that young lady was swinging the shoulders atop of
the little waist in a somewhat provocative fashion, only too
conscious of the grey-blueness of her fine eyes, and the modish cut
of her clothes. She had a knack which seemed to Laura both
desirable and unattainable: that of appearing to be engrossed in
glib chat with her companion, while in reality she did not hear a
word Laura said, and ogled everyone who passed, out of the tail of
her eye.</p>

<p>They reached the "block", that strip of Collins Street which
forms the fashionable promenade. Here the road was full of cabs and
carriages, and there was a great crowd on the pavement. The girls
progressed but slowly. People were meeting their friends, shopping,
changing books at the library, eating ices at the confectioner's,
fruit at the big fruit-shop round the corner. There were a large
number of high-collared young dudes, some Trinity and Ormond men
with coloured hatbands, ladies with little parcels dangling from
their wrists, and countless schoolgirls like themselves. Tilly grew
momentarily livelier; her big eyes pounced, hawk-like, on every
face she met, and her words to Laura became more disjointed than
before. Finally, her efforts were crowned with success: she
managed, by dint of glance and smile combined, to unhook a youth of
her acquaintance from a group at a doorway, and to attach him to
herself.</p>

<p>In high good humour now that her aim was accomplished, she set
about the real business of the morning&mdash;that of promenading up
and down. She had no longer even a feigned interest left for Laura,
and the latter walked beside the couple a lame and unnecessary
third. Though she kept a keen watch for Bob, she could not discover
him, and her time was spent for the most part in dodging people,
and in catching up with her companions for it was difficult to walk
three abreast in the crowd.</p>

<p>Then she saw him&mdash;and with what an unpleasant shock. If
only Tilly did not see him, too!</p>

<p>But no such luck was hers. "Look out, there's Bob," nudged Tilly
almost at once.</p>

<p>Alas! there was no question of his waiting longingly for her to
appear. He was walking with two ladies, and laughing and talking.
He raised his hat to his cousin and her friend, but did not
disengage himself, and passing them by disappeared in the
throng.</p>

<p>Behind her hand Tilly buzzed: "One of those Woodwards is awfully
sweet on him. I bet he can't get loose."</p>

<p>This was a drop of comfort. But as, at the next encounter, he
still did not offer to join them&mdash;could it, indeed, be
expected that he would prefer her company to that of the pretty,
grown-up girls he was with?&mdash;as he again sidled past, Tilly,
who had given him one of her most vivacious sparkles, turned and
shot a glance at Laura's face.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, look a little more amiable, or he won't come
at all."</p>

<p>Laura felt more like crying; her sunshine was intercepted, her
good spirits were quenched; had she had her will, she would have
turned tail and gone straight back to school. She had not wanted
Bob, had never asked him to be 'gone' on her, and if she had now to
fish for him, into the bargain...However there was no help for it;
the thing had to be gone through with; and, since Tilly seemed
disposed to lay the blame of his lukewarmness at her door, Laura
glued her mouth, the next time Bob hove in sight, into a feeble
smile.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards he came up to them. His cousin had an arch
greeting in readiness.</p>

<p>"Well, you've been doing a pretty mash, you have!" she cried,
and jogged him with her elbow. "No wonder you'd no eyes for poor
us. What price Miss Woodward's gloves this morning!"&mdash;at which
Bob laughed, looked sly, and tapped his breast pocket.</p>

<p>It was time to be moving homewards. Tilly and her beau led the
way. "For we know you two would rather be alone. Now, Bob, not too
many sheep's-eyes, please!"</p>

<p>Bob smiled, and let fly a wicked glance at Laura from under his
dark lashes. Dropping behind, they began to mount the hill. Now was
the moment, felt Laura, to say something very witty, or pert, or
clever; and a little pulse in her throat beat hard, as she
furiously racked her brains. Oh, for just a morsel of Tilly's
loose-tonguedness! One after the other she considered and
dismissed: the pleasant coolness of the morning, the crowded
condition of the street, even the fact of the next day being
Sunday&mdash;ears and cheeks on fire, meanwhile, at her own
slow-wittedness. And Bob smiled. She almost hated him for that
smile. It was so assured, and withal so disturbing. Seen close at
hand his teeth were whiter, his eyes browner than she had believed.
His upper lip, too, was quite dark; and he fingered it incessantly,
as he waited for her to make the onslaught.</p>

<p>But he waited in vain; and when they had walked a whole
street-block in this mute fashion, it was he who broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"Ripping girls, those Woodwards," he said, and seemed to be
remembering their charms.</p>

<p>"Yes, they looked very nice," said Laura in a small voice, and
was extremely conscious of her own thirteen years.</p>

<p>"Simply stunning! Though May's so slender&mdash;May's the pretty
one&mdash;and has such a jolly figure...I believe I could span her
waist with my two hands...her service is just A1&mdash;at tennis I
mean."</p>

<p>"Is it really?" said Laura wanly, and felt unutterably depressed
at the turn the conversation was taking. Her own waist was coarse,
her knowledge of tennis of the slightest.</p>

<p>"Ra-<i>ther</i>! Overhand, with a cut on it&mdash;she plays with
a 14-oz. racquet. And she has a back drive, too, by Jove,
that&mdash;you play, of course?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Laura spoke up manfully; but prayed that he would not
press his inquiries further. At this juncture his attention was
diverted by the passing of a fine tandem; and as soon as he brought
it back to her again, she said: 'You're at Trinity, aren't
you?'&mdash;which was finesse; for she knew he wasn't.</p>

<p>"Well, yes...all but," answered Bob well pleased. "I start in
this winter."</p>

<p>"How nice!"</p>

<p>There was another pause; then she blurted out: "We church girls
always wear Trinity colours at the boat-race."</p>

<p>She hoped from her heart, this might lead him to say that he
would look out for her there; but he did nothing of the kind. His
answer was to the effect that this year they jolly well expected to
knock Ormond into a cocked hat.</p>

<p>Lunch threatened to be formidable. To begin with, Laura, whose
natural, easy frankness had by this time all but been successfully
educated out of her, Laura was never shyer with strangers than at a
meal, where every word you said could be listened to by a tableful
of people. Then, too, her vis-a-vis was a small sharp child of five
or six, called Thumbby, or Thumbkin, who only removed her bead-like
eyes from Laura's face to be saucy to her father. And, what was
worse, the Uncle turned out to be a type that struck instant terror
into Laura: a full-fledged male tease. He was, besides, very hairy
of face, and preternaturally solemn.</p>

<p>No sooner had he drawn in his chair to the table than he began.
Lifting his head and thrusting out his chin, he sniffed the air in
all directions with a moving nose&mdash;just as a cat does.
Everyone looked at him in surprise. Tilly, who sat next him, went
pink.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" his wife at last inquired in a gentle voice;
for it was evident that he was not going to stop till asked why he
did it.</p>

<p>"Mos' extraor'nary smell!" he replied. "Mother, d'you know, I
could take my appledavy some one has been using my scent."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Tom."</p>

<p>"Silly pa!" said the little girl.</p>

<p>Ramming his knuckles into his eyes, he pretended to cry at his
daughter's rebuke; then bore down on Laura.</p>

<p>"D'you know, Miss Ra...Ra...Rambotham"&mdash;he made as if he
could not get her name out&mdash;"d'you know that I'm a great man
for scent? Fact. I take a bath in it every morning."</p>

<p>Laura smiled uncertainly, fixed always by the child.</p>

<p>"Fact, I assure you. Over the tummy, up to the chin. Now, who's
been at it? For it's my opinion I shan't have enough left to
shampoo my eyebrows. Bob, is it you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, pater."</p>

<p>"Cut me some bread, Bob, please," said Tilly hastily.</p>

<p>"Mos' extraor'nary thing!" persisted the Uncle. "Or&mdash;good
Lord, mother, can it be my monthly attack of D.T.'s beginning
already? They're not due, you know, till next week, Monday, five
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Dear, <i>don't</i> be so silly. Besides it's my scent, not
yours. And anyone is welcome to it."</p>

<p>"Well, well, let's call in the cats!&mdash;By the way, Miss
Ra...Ra...Rambotham, are you aware that this son of mine is a
professed lady-killer?"</p>

<p>Laura and Bob went different shades of crimson.</p>

<p>"Why has she got so red?" the child asked her mother, in an
audible whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>chuck</i> it, pater!" murmured Bob in disgust.</p>

<p>"Fact, I assure you. Put not your trust in Robert! He's always
on with the new love before he's off with the old. You ask him
whose glove he's still cherishing in the pocket next his
heart."</p>

<p>Bob pushed his plate from him and, for a moment, seemed about to
leave the table. Laura could not lift her eyes. Tilly chewed in
angry silence.</p>

<p>Here, however, the child made a diversion.</p>

<p>"You're a lady-kilda yourself, pa."</p>

<p>"Me, Thumbkin?&mdash;Mother, d'you hear that?&mdash;Then it's
the whiskers, Thumbby. Ladies love whiskers&mdash;or a fine
drooping moustache, like my son Bob's." He sang: "'Oh, oh, the
ladies loved him so!'"</p>

<p>"Tom, dear, <i>do</i> be quiet."</p>

<p>"Tom, Tom, the piper's son!" chirped Thumbby.</p>

<p>"Well, well, let's call in the cats!"&mdash;which appeared to be
his way of changing the subject.</p>

<p>It seemed, after this, as though the remainder of lunch might
pass off without further hitch. Then however and all of a sudden,
while he was peeling an apple, this dreadful man said, as though to
himself: "Ra...Ra...Rambotham. Now where have I heard that
name?"</p>

<p>"Wa...Wa...Wamboffam!" mocked Thumbkin.</p>

<p>"Monkey, if you're so sharp you'll cut yourself!&mdash;Young
lady, do you happen to come from Warrenega?" he asked Laura, when
Thumbkin's excited chirrup of: "I'll cut <i>you</i>, pa, into
little bits!" had died away.</p>

<p>Ready to sink through the floor, Laura replied that she did.</p>

<p>"Then I've the pleasure of knowing your mother. Tall dark woman,
isn't she?"</p>

<p>Under the table, Laura locked the palms of her hands and stemmed
her feet against the floor. Was here, now, before them all, and Bob
in particular, the shameful secret of the embroidery to come to
light? She could hardly force her lips to frame an answer.</p>

<p>Her confusion was too patent to be overlooked. Above her lowered
head, signs passed between husband and wife, and soon afterwards
the family rose from the table.</p>

<p>But Tilly was so obviously sulky that the tense could not let
her escape him thus.</p>

<p>He cried: "For God's sake, Tilly, stand still! What on earth
have you got on your back?"</p>

<p>Tilly came from up-country and her thoughts leapt fearfully to
scorpions and tarantulas. Affrighted, she tried to peer over her
shoulder, and gave a preliminary shriek. "Gracious!&mdash;whatever
is it?"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" He approached her with the tongs; the next moment to
ejaculate: "Begad, it's not a growth, it's a bustle!" and as he
spoke he tweaked the place where a bustle used to be worn.</p>

<p>Even Bob had to join in the ensuing boohoo, which went on and on
till Laura thought the Uncle would fall down in a fit. Then for the
third time he invited those present to join him in summoning the
cats, murmured something about "humping his bluey", and went out
into the hall, where they heard him swinging Thumbby "round the
world".</p>

<p>It was all the Aunt could do to mollify Tilly, who was enraged
to the point of tears. "I've never worn a bustle in my life!
Uncle's a perfect <i>fool</i>! I've never met such a fool as he
is!"</p>

<p>Still boiling, she disappeared to nurse her ruffled temper in
private; and she remained absent from the room for over half an
hour. During this time Laura and Bob were alone together. But even
less than before came of their intercourse: Bob, still smarting
from his father's banter, was inclined to be stand-offish, as
though afraid Laura might take liberties with him after having been
made to look so small; Laura, rendered thoroughly unsure to begin
with, by the jocular tone of the luncheon-table, had not recovered
from the shock of hearing her parentage so bluffly disclosed. And
since, at this time, her idea of the art of conversation was to
make jerky little remarks which led nowhere, or to put still more
jerky questions, Bob was soon stifling yawns, and not with the best
success. He infected Laura; and there the two of them sat, doing
their best to appear unconscious of the terrible spasms which,
every few seconds, distorted their faces. At last Bob could stand
it no longer and bolted from the room.</p>

<p>Laura was alone, and seemed to be forgotten The minutes ticked
by, and no one came&mdash;or no one but a little grey kitten, which
arrived as if from nowhere, with a hop and a skip. She coaxed the
creature to her lap, where it joined head to tail and went to
sleep. And there she sat, in the gloomy, overfilled drawing-room,
and stroked the kitten, which neither cracked stupid jokes nor
required her to strain her wits to make conversation.</p>

<p>When at length Tilly came back, she expressed a rather acid
surprise at Bob's absence, and went to look for him; Laura heard
them whispering and laughing in the passage. On their return to the
drawing-room it had been decided that the three of them should go
for a walk. As the sky was overcast and the girls had no umbrellas,
Bob carried a big one belonging to the Uncle. Tilly called this a
"family umbrella"; and the jokes that were extracted from the pair
of words lasted the walkers on the whole of their outward way;
lasted so long that Laura, who was speedily finished with her
contribution, grew quite stupefied with listening to the other
two.</p>

<p>Collins Street was now as empty as a bush road. The young people
went into Bourke Street, where, for want of something better to do,
they entered the Eastern Market and strolled about inside. The
noise that rose from the livestock, on ground floor and upper
storey, was ear-splitting: pigs grunted; cocks crowed, turkeys
gobbled, parrots shrieked; while rough human voices echoed and
re-echoed under the lofty roof. There was a smell, too, an
extraordinary smell, composed of all the individual smells of all
these living things: of fruit and vegetables, fresh and decayed; of
flowers, and butter, and grain; of meat, and fish, and strong
cheeses; of sawdust sprinkled with water, and freshly wet
pavements&mdash;one great complicated smell, the piquancy of which
made Laura sniff like a spaniel. But after a very few minutes
Tilly, whose temper was still short, called it a "vile stink" and
clapped her handkerchief to her nose, and so they hurried out, past
many enticing little side booths hidden in dark corners on the
ground floor, such as a woman without legs, a double-headed calf,
and the like.</p>

<p>Outside it had begun to rain; they turned into a Waxworks
Exhibition. This was a poor show, and they were merely killing time
when the announcement caught their eye that a certain room was open
to "Married People Only". The quips and jokes this gave rise to
again were as unending as those about the umbrella; and Laura grew
so tired of them, and of pretending to find them funny, that her
temper also began to give way; and she eased her feelings by making
the nippy mental note on her companions, that jokes were evidently
"in the blood".</p>

<p>When they emerged, it was time for the girls to return to
school. They took a hansom, Bob accompanying them. As they drove,
Laura sitting sandwiched between the other two, it came over her
with a rush what a miserable failure the day had been. A minute
before, her spirits had given a faint flicker, for Bob had laid his
arm along the back of the seat. Then she saw that he had done this
just to pull at the little curls that grew on Tilly's neck. She was
glad when the cab drew up, when Tilly ostentatiously took the fat
half-crown from her purse, and Bob left them at the gate with a:
"Well, so long, ladies!"</p>

<p>The boarders spent the evening in sewing garments for charity.
Laura had been at work for weeks on a coarse, red flannel
petticoat, and as a rule was under constant reprimand for her
idleness. On this night, having separated herself from Tilly, she
sat down beside a girl with a very long plait of hair and small,
narrow eyes, who went by the name of "Chinky". Chinky was always
making up to her, and could be relied on to cover her silence.
Laura sewed away, with bent head and pursed lips, and was so
engrossed that the sole rebuke she incurred had to do with her
diligence.</p>

<p>Miss Chapman exclaimed in horror at her stiffly outstretched
arm.</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you be so vulgar, Laura? To sew with a thread as
long as that!"</p>

<h2>XV.</h2>

<p>For days Laura avoided even thinking of this unlucky visit.
Privately, she informed herself that Tilly's wealthy relations were
a "rude, stupid lot"; and, stuffing her fingers in her ears,
memorised pages with a dispatch that deadened thought.</p>

<p>When, however, the first smart had passed and she was able to go
back on what had happened, a soreness at her own failure was the
abiding result: and this, though Tilly mercifully spared her the
"dull as ditchwater", that was Bob's final verdict. But the fact
that the invitation was not repeated told Laura enough.</p>

<p>Her hurt was not relieved by the knowledge that she had done
nothing to deserve it. For she had never asked for Bob's notice or
admiration, had never thought of him but as a handsome cousin of
Tilly's who sat in a distant pew at St Stephen's-on-the-Hill; and
the circumstance that, because he had singled her out approvingly,
she was expected to worm herself into his favour, seemed to her of
a monstrous injustice. But, all the same, had she possessed the
power to captivate him, she would cheerfully have put her pride in
her pocket. For, having once seen him close at hand, she knew how
desirable he was. Having been the object of glances from those
liquid eyes, of smiles from those blanched-almond teeth, she found
it hard to dismiss them from her mind. How the other girls would
have boasted of it, had they been chosen by such a one as
Bob!&mdash;they who, for the most part, were satisfied with
blotchy-faced, red-handed youths, whose lean wrists dangled from
their retreating sleeves. But then, too, they would have known how
to keep him. Oh, those lucky other girls!</p>

<p>"I say, Chinky, what do you do when a boy's gone on you?"</p>

<p>She would have shrunk from putting an open question of this kind
to her intimates; but Chinky, could be trusted. For she garnered
the few words Laura vouchsafed her, as gratefully as Lazarus his
crumbs; and a mark of confidence, such as this, would sustain her
for days.</p>

<p>But she had no information to give.</p>

<p>"Me?...why, nothing. Boys are dirty, horrid, conceited
creatures."</p>

<p>In her heart Laura was at one with this judgment; but it was not
to the point.</p>

<p>"Yes, but s'pose one was awfully sweet on you and you rather
liked him?"</p>

<p>"Catch me! If one came bothering round me, I'd do this" and she
set her ten outstretched fingers to her nose and waggled them.</p>

<p>And yet Chinky was rather pretty, in her way.</p>

<p>Maria Morell, cautiously tapped, threw back her head and roared
with laughter.</p>

<p>"Bless its little heart! Does it want to know?&mdash;say, Laura,
who's your mash?"</p>

<p>"No one," answered Laura stoutly. "I only asked. For I guess you
<i>know</i>, Maria."</p>

<p>"By gosh, you bet I do!" cried Maria, italicising the words in
her vehemence. "Well, look here, Kiddy, if a chap's sweet on me I
let him be sweet, my dear, and that's all&mdash;till he's run to
barley-sugar. What I don't let him savvy is, whether I care a
twopenny damn for him. Soon as you do that, it's all up. Just let
him hang round, and throw sheep's-eyes, till he's as soft as a
jellyfish, and when he's right down ripe, roaring mad, go off and
pretend to do a mash with some one else. That's the way to glue
him, chicken."</p>

<p>"But you don't have anything of him that way," objected
Laura.</p>

<p>Maria laughed herself red in the face. "What'n earth more d'you
want? Why, he'll pester you with letters, world without end, and
look as black as your shoe if you so much as wink at another boy.
As for a kiss, if he gets a chance of one he'll take it you can bet
your bottom dollar on that."</p>

<p>"But you never get to know him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it, Laura, but you <i>are</i> rich! What d'you think
one has a boy for, I'd like to know. To parlezvous about old
Shepherd's sermons? You loony, it's only for getting lollies, and
letters, and the whole dashed fun of the thing. If you go about too
much with one, you soon have to fake an interest in his rotten old
affairs. Or else just hold your tongue and let him blow. And that's
dull work. D'you think it ever comes up a fellow's back to talk to
you about your new Sunday hat! If it does, you can teach your
grandmother to suck eggs."</p>

<p>But, despite this wisdom, Laura could not determine how Maria
would have acted had she stood in her shoes.</p>

<p>And then, too, the elder girl had said nothing about another
side of the question, had not touched on the sighs and simpers, the
winged glances, and drooped, provocative lids&mdash;all the
thousand and one fooleries, in short, which Laura saw her and
others employ. There was a regular machinery of invitation and
encouragement to be set in motion: for, before it was safe to
ignore a wooer and let him dangle, as Maria advised, you had first
to make quite sure he wished to nibble your bait. And it was just
in this elementary science that Laura broke down.</p>

<p>Looking round her, she saw mainly experts. To take the example
nearest at hand: there was Monsieur Legros, the French master;
well, Maria could twist him round her little finger. She only
needed to pout her thick, red lips, or to give a coquettish twist
to her plump figure, or to ogle him with her fine, bold, blue eyes,
and the difficult questions in the lesson were sure to pass her by.
Once she had even got ten extra marks added to an examination
paper, in this easy fashion. Whereas, did she, Laura, try to
imitate Maria, venture to pout or to smirk, it was ten to one she
would be rebuked for impertinence. No, she got on best with the
women-teachers, to whom red lips and a full bust meant nothing;
while the most elderly masters could not be relied on to be wholly
impartial, where a pair of magnificent eyes was concerned. Even Mr.
Strachey, the unapproachable, had been known, on running full tilt
into a pretty girl's arms in an unlit passage, to be laughingly
confused.</p>

<p>Laura was not, of course, the sole outsider in these things;
sprinkled through the College were various others, older, too, than
she, who by reason of demureness of temperament, or immersion in
their work, stood aloof. But they were lost in the majority, and,
as it chanced, none of them belonged to Laura's circle. Except
Chinky&mdash;and Chinky did not count. So, half-fascinated,
half-repelled, Laura set to studying her friends with renewed zeal.
She could not help admiring their proficiency in the art of
pleasing, even though she felt a little abashed by the open pride
they took in their growing charms. There was Bertha, for instance,
Bertha who had one of the nicest minds of them all; and yet how
frankly gratified she was, by the visible rounding of her arms and
the curving of her bust. She spoke of it to Laura with a kind of
awe; and her voice seemed to give hints of a coming mystery. Tilly,
on the other hand, lived to reduce her waist-measure: she was
always sucking at lemons, and she put up with the pains of
indigestion as well as a red tip to her nose; for no success in
school meant as much to Tilly as the fact that she had managed to
compress herself a further quarter of an inch, no praise on the
part of her teachers equalled the compliments this earned her from
dressmaker and tailor. As for Inez, who had not only a pretty face
but was graceful and slender-limbed as a greyhound, Inez no longer
needed to worry over artificial charms, or to dwell
self-consciously on her development; serious admirers were not
lacking, and with one of these, a young man some eight years older
than herself, she had had for the past three months a sort of
understanding. For her, as for so many others, the time she had
still to spend at school was as purgatory before paradise. To top
all, one of the day-scholars in Laura's class was actually engaged
to be married; and in no boy-and-girl fashion, but to a doctor who
lived and practised in Emerald Hill: he might sometimes be seen,
from a peephole under the stairs, waiting to escort her home from
school. This fiancee was looked up to by the class with tremendous
reverence, as one set apart, oiled and anointed. You really could
not treat her as a comrade her, who had reached the goal. For this
<i>was</i> the goal; and the thoughts of all were fixed, with an
intentness that varied only in degree, on the great consummation
which, as planned in these young minds, should come to pass without
fail directly the college-doors closed behind them. And here again
Laura was a heretic. For she could not contemplate the future that
was to be hers when she had finished her education, but with a
feeling of awe: it was still so distant as to be one dense blue
haze; it was so vast, that thinking of it took your breath away:
there was room in it for the most wonderful miracles that had ever
happened; it might contain anything&mdash;from golden slippers to a
Jacob's ladder, by means of which you would scale the skies; and
with these marvellous perhapses awaiting you, it was impossible to
limit your hopes to one single event, which, though it saved you
from derision, would put an end, for ever, to all possible,
exciting contingencies.</p>

<p>These thoughts came and went. In the meantime, despite her
ape-like study of her companions, she remained where the other sex
was concerned a disheartening failure. A further incident drove
this home anew.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon, those boarders who had not been invited
out were taken to see a cricket-match. They were a mere handful,
eight or nine at most, and Miss Snodgrass alone was in charge. All
her friends being away that day, Laura had to bring up the rear
with the governess and one of the little girls. Though their walk
led them through pleasant parks, she was glad when it was over; for
she did not enjoy Miss Snodgrass's company. She was no match for
this crisply sarcastic governess, and had to be the whole time on
her guard. For Miss Snodgrass was not only a great talker, but had
also a very inquiring mind, and seemed always trying to ferret out
just those things you did not care to tell&mdash;such as the size
of your home, or the social position you occupied in the township
where you lived.</p>

<p>Arrived at the cricket ground, they climbed the Grand Stand and
sat down in one of the back rows, to the rear of the other
spectators. Before them sloped a steep bank of hats gaily-flowered
and ribbon-banded hats&mdash;of light and dark shoulders, of alert,
boyish profiles and pale, pretty faces&mdash;a representative
gathering of young Australia, bathed in the brilliant March
light.</p>

<p>Laura's seat was between her two companions, and it was here the
malheur occurred. During an interval in the game, one of the girls
asked the governess's leave to speak to her cousin; and thereupon a
shy lad was the target for twenty eyes. He was accompanied by a
friend, who, in waiting, sat down just behind Laura. This boy was
addressed by Miss Snodgrass; but he answered awkwardly, and after a
pause, Laura felt herself nudged.</p>

<p>"You can speak to him, Laura," whispered Miss Snodgrass. She
evidently thought Laura waited only for permission, to burst
in.</p>

<p>Laura had already fancied that the boy looked at her with
interest. This was not improbable; for she had her best hat on,
which made her eyes seem very dark&mdash;"like sloes," Chinky said,
though neither of them had any clear idea what a sloe was.</p>

<p>Still, a prompting to speech invariably tied her tongue. She
half turned, and stole an uneasy peep at the lad. He might be a
year older than herself; he had a frank, sunburnt face, blue eyes,
and almost white flaxen hair. She took heart of grace.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you often come here?" she ventured at last.</p>

<p>"You bet!" said the boy; but kept his eyes where they were on
the pitch.</p>

<p>"Cricket's a lovely game...don't you think so?"</p>

<p>Now he looked at her; but doubtfully, from the height of his
fourteen male years; and did not reply.</p>

<p>"Do you play?"</p>

<p>This was a false move, she felt it at once. Her question seemed
to offend him. "Should rather think I did!" he answered with a
haughty air.</p>

<p>Weakly she hastened to retract her words. "Oh, I meant
much&mdash;if you played much?"</p>

<p>"Comes to the same thing I guess," said the boy&mdash;he had not
yet reached the age of obligatory politeness.</p>

<p>"It must be splendid"&mdash;here she faltered&mdash;"fun."</p>

<p>But the boy's thoughts had wandered: he was making signs to a
friend down in the front of the Stand. Miss Snodgrass seemed to
repress a smile.</p>

<p>Here, however, the little girl at Laura's side chimed in. "I
think cricket's awful rot," she announced, in a cheepy voice.</p>

<p>Now what was it, Laura asked herself, in these words, or in the
tone in which they were said, that at once riveted the boy's
attention. For he laughed quite briskly as he asked; "What's a kid
like you know about it?"</p>

<p>"Jus' as much as I want to. An' my sister says so's well."</p>

<p>"Get along with you! Who's your sister?"</p>

<p>"Ooh!&mdash;wouldn't you like to know? You've never seen her in
Scots' Church on Sundays I s'pose&mdash;oh, no!"</p>

<p>"By jingo!&mdash;I should say I have. An' you, too. You're the
little sister of that daisy with the simply ripping hair."</p>

<p>The little girl actually made a grimace at him, screwing up her
nose. "Yes, you can be civil now, can't you?"</p>

<p>"My aunt, but she's a tip-topper&mdash;your sister!"</p>

<p>"You go to Scots' Church then, do you?" hazarded Laura, in an
attempt to re-enter the conversation.</p>

<p>"Think I could have seen her if I didn't?" retorted the boy, in
the tone of: "What a fool question!" He also seemed to have been on
the point of adding: "Goose," or "Sillybones."</p>

<p>The little girl giggled. "She's church"&mdash;by which she meant
episcopalian.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't care a bit which I go to," Laura hastened to
explain, fearful lest she should be accounted a snob by this
dissenter. The boy, however, was so faintly interested in her
theological wobblings that, even as she spoke, he had risen from
his seat; and the next moment without another word he went away.
This time Miss Snodgrass laughed outright.</p>

<p>Laura stared, with blurred eyes, at the white-clad forms that
began to dot the green again. Her lids smarted. She did not dare to
put up her fingers to squeeze the gathering tears away, and just as
she was wondering what she should do if one was inconsiderate
enough to roll down her cheek, she heard a voice behind her.</p>

<p>"I say, Laura...Laura!"&mdash;and there was Chinky, in her best
white hat.</p>

<p>"I'm sitting with my aunt just a few rows down; but I couldn't
make you look. Can I come in next to you for a minute?"</p>

<p>"If you like," said Laura and, because she had to sniff a
little, very coldly: Chinky had no doubt also been a witness of her
failure.</p>

<p>The girl squeezed past and shared her seat. "I don't take up
much room."</p>

<p>Laura feigned to be engrossed in the game. But presently she
felt her bare wrist touched, and Chinky said in her ear: "What
pretty hands you've got, Laura!"</p>

<p>She buried them in her dress, at this. She found it in the worst
possible taste of Chinky to try to console her.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to wear a ring on one of them?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Laura, in the same repellent way.</p>

<p>"Truly? I'd love to give you one."</p>

<p>"You? Where would <i>you</i> get it?"</p>

<p>"Would you wear it, if I did?"</p>

<p>"Let me see it first," was Laura's graceless reply, as she
returned to her stony contemplation of the great sunlit
expanse.</p>

<p>She was sure Miss Snodgrass, on getting home, would laugh with
the other governesses over what had occurred&mdash;if not with some
of the girls. The story would leak out and come to Tilly's ears;
and Tilly would despise her more than she did already. So would all
the rest. She was branded, as it was, for not having a single
string to her bow. Now, it had become plain to her that she could
never hope for one; for, when it came to holding a boy's attention
for five brief minutes, she could be put in the shade by a child of
eight years old.</p>

<h2>XVI.</h2>

<p>Since, however, it seemed that some one had to be loved if you
were to be able to hold up your head with the rest, then it was
easier, infinitely easier, to love the curate. With the curate, no
personal contact was necessary&mdash;and that was more than could
be said even of the music-masters. In regard to them, pressures of
the hand, as well as countless nothings, were expected and enacted,
in the bi-weekly reports you rendered to those of your friends who
followed the case. Whereas for the curate it was possible to
simulate immense ardour, without needing either to humble your
pride or call invention to your aid: the worship took place from
afar. The curate was, moreover, no unworthy object; indeed he was
quite attractive, in a lean, ascetic fashion, with his spiritual
blue eyes, and the plain gold cross that dangled from his black
watch-ribbon&mdash;though, it must be admitted, when he preached,
and grew greatly in earnest, his mouth had a way of opening as if
it meant to swallow the church&mdash;and Laura was by no means his
sole admirer. Several of her friends had a fancy for him,
especially as his wife, who was much older than he, was a thin,
elderly lady with a tired face.</p>

<p>And now, by her own experience, Laura was led to the following
discovery: that, if you imagine a thing with sufficient force, you
can induce your imagining to become reality. By dint of pretending
that it was so, she gradually worked herself up into an attack of
love, which was genuine enough to make her redden when Mr. Shepherd
was spoken of, and to enjoy being teased about him. And since, at
any rate when in church, she was a sincerely religious little girl,
and one to whom&mdash;notwithstanding her protested indifference to
forms of worship&mdash;such emotional accessories as flowers, and
music, and highly coloured vestments made a strong appeal, her
feelings for Mr. Shepherd were soon mystically jumbled up with her
piety: the eastward slant for the Creed, and the Salutation at the
Sacred Name, seemed not alone homage due to the Deity, but also a
kind of minor homage offered to and accepted by Mr. Shepherd; the
school-pew being so near the chancel that it was not difficult to
believe yourself the recipient of personal notice.</p>

<p>At home during the winter holidays, his name chanced to cross
her lips. Straightway it occurred to Mother that he was the nephew
of an old friend whom she had long lost sight of letters passed
between Warrenega and Melbourne, and shortly after her return to
the College Laura learnt that she was to spend the coming monthly
holiday at Mr. Shepherd's house.</p>

<p>In the agitated frame of mind this threw her into, she did not
know whether to be glad or sorry. Her feelings had, of late, got
into such a rapt and pious muddle that it seemed a little like
being asked out to meet God. On the other hand, she could not but
see that the circumstance would raise her standing at school,
immeasurably. And this it did. As soon as the first shock had
passed she communicated the fact freely, and was shrewd enough not
to relate how the invitation had come about, allowing it to be put
down, as her friends were but too ready to do, to the effect
produced on the minister by her silent adoration.</p>

<p>The Church girls were wild with envy. Laura was dragged up the
garden with an arm thrust through each of hers. Mr. Shepherd's holy
calling and spiritual appearance stood him in small stead here; and
the blackest interpretation was put on the matter of the visit.</p>

<p>"Nice things you'll be up to, the pair of you&mdash;oh, my
aunt!" ejaculated Maria.</p>

<p>"I think it's beastly risky her going at all," filled in Kate
Horner, gobbling a little; for her upper lip overhung the lower.
"These saints are oftenest bad 'uns."</p>

<p>"Yes, and with an Aunt Sally like that for a wife. Now look
here, Kiddy, just you watch you're not left alone with him in the
dark."</p>

<p>"And mind, you've got to tell us everything&mdash;every blessed
thing!"</p>

<p>Laura was called for, on Saturday morning, by the maiden sister
of her divinity. Miss Isabella Shepherd was a fair, short, pleasant
young woman, with a nervous, kindly smile, and a congenital
inability to look you in the face when speaking to you; so that the
impression she made was that of a perpetual friendliness, directed,
however, not at you, but at the inanimate objects around you. Laura
was so tickled by this peculiarity, which she spied the moment she
entered the waiting-room, that at first she could take in nothing
else. Afterwards, when the novelty had worn off, she subjected her
companion to a closer scrutiny, and from the height of thirteen
years had soon taxed her with being a frumpish old maid; the
valiant but feeble efforts Miss Isabella made to entertain her, as
they walked along, only strengthening her in this opinion.</p>

<p>Not very far from the College they entered a small, two-storied
stone house, which but for an iron railing and a shrub or two gave
right on the street.</p>

<p>"Will you come up to the study?" said Miss Isabella, smiling
warmly, and ogling the door-mat. "I'm sure Robby would like to see
you at once."</p>

<p>Robby? Her saint called Robby?&mdash;Laura blushed.</p>

<p>But at the head of the stairs they were brought up short by Mrs.
Shepherd, who, policeman-like, raised a warning hand.</p>

<p>"Hssh...ssh...sh!" she breathed, and simultaneously half-closed
her eyes, as if imitating slumber. "Robby has just lain down for a
few minutes. How are you, dear?"&mdash;in a whisper. "I'm so
pleased to see you."</p>

<p>She looked even more faded than in church. But she was very
kind, and in the bedroom insisted on getting out a clean towel for
Laura.</p>

<p>"Now we'll go down. It's only lunch to-day, for Robby has a
confirmation-class immediately afterwards, and doesn't care to eat
much."</p>

<p>They descended to the dining-room, but though the meal was
served, did not take their seats: they stood about, in a kind of
anxious silence. This lasted for several minutes; then, heavy
footsteps were heard trampling overhead: these persisted, but did
not seem to advance, and at length there was a loud, impatient
shout of: "Maisie!"</p>

<p>Both ladies were perceptibly flurried. "He can't find
something," said Miss Isabella in a stage-whisper; while Mrs.
Shepherd, taking the front of her dress in both hands, set out for
the stairs with the short, clumsy jerks which, in a woman, pass for
running.</p>

<p>A minute or two later the origin of the fluster came in,
looking, it must be confessed, not much more amiable than his voice
had been: he was extremely pale, too, his blue eyes had hollow
rings round them, and there were tired wrinkles on his forehead.
However he offered Laura a friendly hand which she took with her
soul in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, and so this is the young lady fresh from the halls of
learning, is it?" he asked, after a mumbled grace, as he carved a
rather naked mutton-bone: the knife caught in the bone; he wrenched
it free with an ill-natured tweak. "And what do they teach you at
college, miss, eh?" he went on. "French?...Greek?...Latin? How goes
it? <i>Infandum, Regina, jubes renovare dolorem</i>&mdash;isn't
that the way of it? And then...let me see! It's so long since I
went to school, you know."</p>

<p>"<i>Trojanas ut opes et lamentabile regnum eruerint danai</i>,"
said Laura, almost blind with pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" he exclaimed, in what seemed tremendous
surprise; but, even as she spoke, his thoughts were swept away; for
he had taken up a mustard-pot and found it empty. "Yes, yes, here
we are again! Not a scrap of mustard on the table."&mdash;His voice
was angrily resigned.</p>

<p>"With <i>mutton</i>, Robby dear?" ventured Mrs. Shepherd, with
the utmost humbleness.</p>

<p>"With mutton if I choose!" he retorted violently. "<i>Will</i>
you, Maisie, be kind enough to allow me to know my own tastes best,
and not dictate to me what I shall eat?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Shepherd, murmuring: "Oh dear! it's that dreadful
girl," had already made a timid spring at the bell.</p>

<p>"Poor Robby...so rushed again!" said Isabella in a reproachful
tone.</p>

<p>"And while she's here she may bring the water and the glasses as
well," snarled the master of the house, who had run a flaming eye
over the table.</p>

<p>"Tch, tch, tch!" said Mrs. Shepherd, with so little spirit that
Laura felt quite sorry for her.</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Maisie!" said Miss Isabella. "And when the poor
boy's so rushed, too."</p>

<p>This guerilla warfare continued throughout luncheon, and left
Laura wondering why, considering the dearth of time, and the
distress of the ladies at each fresh contretemps, they did not jump
up and fetch the missing articles themselves&mdash;as Mother would
have done&mdash;instead of each time ringing the bell and waiting
for the appearance of the saucy, unwilling servant. As it turned
out, however, their behaviour had a pedagogic basis. It seemed that
they hoped, by constantly summoning the maid, to sharpen her
memory. But Mrs. Shepherd was also implicated in the method; and
this was the reason why Isabella&mdash;as she afterwards explained
to Laura&mdash;never offered her a thimbleful of help.</p>

<p>"My sister-in-law is nothing of a manager," she said. "But we
still trust she will improve in time, if she always has her
attention drawn to her forgetfulness&mdash;at least Robby does; I'm
afraid I have rather given her up. But Robby's patience is
angelic." And Laura was of the same opinion, since the couple had
been married for more than seven years.</p>

<p>The moment the meal, which lasted a quarter of an hour, was
over, Mr. Shepherd clapped on his shovel-hat and started, with long
strides, for his class, Mrs. Shepherd, who had not been quite
ready, scuttling along a hundred yards behind him, with quick,
fussy steps, and bonnet an awry.</p>

<p>Laura and Isabella stood at the gate.</p>

<p>"I ought really to have gone, too," said Isabella, and smiled at
the gutter. "But as you are here, Robby said I had better stay at
home to-day. Now what would you like to do?"</p>

<p>This opened up a dazzling prospect, with the whole of Melbourne
before one. But Laura was too polite to pretend anything but
indifference.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you wouldn't mind staying in then? I want so much
to copy out Robby's sermon. I always do it, you know, for he can't
read his own writing. But he won't expect it to-day and he'll be so
pleased."</p>

<p>It was a cool, quiet little house, with the slightly unused
smell in the rooms that betokens a lack of children. Laura did not
dislike the quiet, and sat contentedly in the front parlour till
evening fell. Not, however, that she was really within hundreds of
miles of Melbourne; for the wonderful book that she held on her
knee was called <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>, and her eyes never
rose from the pages.</p>

<p>Supper, when it came, was as scrappy and as hurried as lunch had
been: a class of working-men was momently expected, and Robby had
just time to gulp down a cup of tea. Nor could he converse; for he
was obliged to spare his throat.</p>

<p>Afterwards the three of them sat listening to the loud talking
overhead. This came down distinctly through the thin ceiling, and
Mr. Shepherd's voice&mdash;it went on and on&mdash;sounded, at such
close quarters, both harsh and rasping. Mrs. Shepherd was mending a
stole; Isabella stooped over the sermon, which she was writing like
copperplate. Laura sat in a corner with her hands before her: she
had finished her book, but her eyes were still visionary. When any
of the three spoke, it was in a low tone.</p>

<p>Towards nine o'clock Mrs. Shepherd fetched a little saucepan,
filled it with milk, and set it on the hob; and after this she
hovered undecidedly between door and fireplace, like a distracted
moth.</p>

<p>"Now do try to get it right to-night, Maisie," admonished
Isabella; and, turning her face, if not her glance, to Laura, she
explained: "It must boil, but not have a scrap of skin on it, or
Robby won't look at it."</p>

<p>Presently the working-men were heard pounding down the stairs,
and thereupon Maisie vanished from the room.</p>

<p>The next day Laura attended morning and evening service at St
Stephen's-on-the-Hill, and in the afternoon made one of Isabella's
class at Sunday school.</p>

<p>That morning she had wakened, in what seemed to be the middle of
the night, to find Isabella dressing by the light of a single
candle.</p>

<p>"Don't you get up," said the latter. "We're all going to early
service, and I just want to make Robby some bread and milk
beforehand. He would rather communicate fasting, but he has to have
something, for he doesn't get home till dinner-time."</p>

<p>When midday came, Robby was very fractious. The
mutton-bone&mdash;no cooking was done&mdash;was harder than ever to
carve with decency; and poor Mrs. Shepherd, for sheer fidgetiness,
could hardly swallow a bite.</p>

<p>But at nine o'clock that evening, when the labours of the day
were behind him, he was persuaded to lie down on the sofa and drink
a glass of port. At his head sat Mrs. Shepherd, holding the wine
and some biscuits; at his feet Isabella, stroking his soles. The
stimulant revived him; he grew quite mellow, and presently, taking
his wife's hand, he held it in his&mdash;and Laura felt sure that
all his querulousness was forgiven him for the sake of this moment.
Then, finding a willing listener in the black-eyed little girl who
sat before him, he began to talk, to relate his travels, giving, in
particular, a vivid account of some months he had once spent in
Japan. Laura, who liked nothing better than travelling at second
hand&mdash;since any other way was out of the question&mdash;Laura
spent a delightful hour, and said so.</p>

<p>"Yes, Robby quite surpassed himself to-night, I thought," said
Isabella as she let down her hair. "I never heard anyone who could
talk as well as he does when he likes. Can you keep a secret,
Laura? We are sure, Maisie and I, that Robby will be a Bishop some
day. And he means to be, himself. But don't say a word about it; he
won't have it mentioned out of the house. And meanwhile he's
working as hard as he can, and we're saving every penny, to let him
take his next degree."</p>

<p>"I do hope you'll come again," she said the following morning,
as they walked back to the College. "I don't mind telling you now,
I felt quite nervous when Robby said we were to ask you. I've had
no experience of little girls. But you haven't been the least
trouble&mdash;not a bit. And I'm sure it was good for Robby having
something young about the house. So mind you write and tell us when
you have another holiday"&mdash;and Isabella's smile beamed out
once more, none the less kindly because it was caught, on its way
to Laura, by the gate they were passing through.</p>

<p>Laura, whose mind was set on a good, satisfying slab of cake,
promised to do this, although her feelings had suffered so great a
change that she was not sure whether she would keep her word. She
was pulled two ways: on the one side was the remembrance of Mr.
Shepherd hacking cantankerously at the bare mutton-bone; on the
other, the cherry-blossom and the mousm&eacute;s of Japan.</p>

<h2>XVII.</h2>

<blockquote>Ohnmacht zur L&uuml;ge ist lange noch nicht Liebe<br>
zur Wahrheit...Wer nicht L&uuml;gen kann,<br>
weiss nicht, was wahrheit ist.<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>A pantomime of knowing smiles and interrogatory grimaces greeted
her, when, having brushed the cake-crumbs from her mouth, she
joined her class. For the twinkling of an eye Laura hesitated,
being unprepared. Then, however, as little able as a comic actor to
resist pandering to the taste of the public, she yielded to this
hunger for spicy happenings, and did what was expected of her:
clapped her hands, one over the other, to her breast, and cast her
eyes heavenwards. Curiosity and anticipation reached a high pitch;
while Laura, by tragically shaking her head, gave it to be
understood that no signs could transmit what she had been through,
since seeing her friends last.</p>

<p>In the thick of this message she was, unluckily, caught by Dr
Pughson, who, after dealing her one of his butcherly gibes, bade
her to the blackboard, to grapple with the Seventh Proposition.</p>

<p>The remainder of the forenoon was a tussle with lessons not
glanced at since Friday night. Besides, Laura seldom forestalled
events by thinking over them, choosing rather to trust for
inspiration to the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>Morning school at an end, she was laid hands on and hurried off
to a retired corner of the garden. Here, four friends squatted
round, determined to extract her adventures from her&mdash;to the
last pip.</p>

<p>Laura was in a pretty pickle. Did she tell the plain truth,
state the pedestrian facts&mdash;and this she would have been
capable of doing with some address; for she had looked through her
hosts with a perspicacity uncommon in a girl of her age; had once
again put to good use those 'sharp, unkind eyes' which Mother
deplored. She had seen an overworked, underfed man, who nagged like
any woman, and made slaves of two weak, adoring ladies; and she
very well knew that, as often as her thoughts in future alighted on
Mr. Robby, she would think of him pinching and screwing, with a
hawk-like eye on a shadowy bishopric. Of her warm feelings for him,
genuine or imaginary, not a speck remained. The first touch of
reality had sunk them below her ken, just as a drop of cold water
sinks the floating grounds in a coffee-pot...But did she confess
this, confess also that, save for a handful of monosyllables, her
only exchange of words with him had been a line of Virgil; and,
still more humbling, that she had liked his wife and sister better
than himself: did this come to light, she would forfeit every sou
of the prestige the visit had lent and yet promised to lend her.
And, now that the possible moment for parting with this borrowed
support had come, she recognised how greatly she had built on
it.</p>

<p>These thoughts whizzed through her mind, as she darted a look at
the four predatory faces that hemmed her in. Tilly's was one of
them: the lightly mocking smile sat on it that Laura had come to
know so well, since her maladroit handling of Bob. She would kill
that smile&mdash;and if she had to die for it herself.</p>

<p>Still, she must be cautious, wary in picking her steps.
Especially as she had not the ghost of an idea how to begin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile cries of impatience buzzed round her.</p>

<p>"She doesn't want to tell."</p>

<p>"Mean brute!"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if it's too dashed shady."</p>

<p>"Didn't I <i>say</i> he was a bad 'un?"</p>

<p>"I bet you there's nothing to tell," said Tilly cockily, and
turned up her nose.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," flung out Laura, at once put on the defensive,
and as she spoke she coloured.</p>

<p>"Look at her! Look how red she's got!"</p>

<p>"And after she promised&mdash;the sneak!"</p>

<p>"I'm not a sneak. I <i>am</i> going to tell. But you're all in
such a blooming hurry."</p>

<p>"Oh, fire away, slow-coach!"</p>

<p>"Well, girls," began Laura gamely, breathing a little hard.
"But, mind, you must never utter a word of what I'm going to tell
you. It's a dead secret, and <i>if</i> you let on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S' help me God!"</p>

<p>"Ananias and Sapphira!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> hurry up."</p>

<p>"Well...well, he's just the most&mdash;oh, I don't know how to
say it, girls&mdash;the <i>most</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just scrumptious, I suppose, eh?"</p>

<p>"Just positively scrumptious, and..."</p>

<p>"And what'd he do?"</p>

<p>"And what about his old sketch of a wife?"</p>

<p>"Her? Oh"&mdash;and Laura squeezed herself desperately for the
details that <i>would</i> not come&mdash;"oh, why she's just a
perfect old...old cat. And twenty years older than him."</p>

<p>"What on earth did he marry her for?"</p>

<p>"Guess he's pretty sick of being tied to an old gin like
that?"</p>

<p>"I should say! Perfectly <i>miserable</i>. He can't think now
why he let himself be induced to marry her. He just despises
her."</p>

<p>"Well, why in the name of all that's holy did he take her?"</p>

<p>Laura cast a mysterious glance round, and lowered her voice.
"Well, you see, she had <i>lots</i> of money and he had none. He
was ever so poor. And she paid for him to be a clergyman."</p>

<p>"Go on! As poor as all that?"</p>

<p>"As poor as a church-mouse. But, oh," she hastened to add, at
the visible cooling-off of the four faces, "he comes of a
<i>most</i> distinguished family. His father was a lord or a
baronet or something like that, but he married a beautiful girl who
hadn't a penny against his father's will and so he cut him out of
his will."</p>

<p>"I say!"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind the father."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, now he feels under an awful obligation to her, and
all that sort of thing, you know."</p>

<p>"And she drives it home, I bet. She looks a nipper."</p>

<p>"Is always throwing it in his face."</p>

<p>"What a ghoul!"</p>

<p>"He'd do just <i>anything</i> to get rid of her,
but&mdash;Girls, it's a dead secret; you must swear you won't
tell."</p>

<p>Gestures of assurance were showered on her.</p>

<p>"Well, he's to be a Bishop some day. It's promised him."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!"</p>

<p>"And I suppose he can't divorce her, because of that?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. He'll have to drag her with him like
millstone round his neck."</p>

<p>"And he'd twigged right enough you were gone on him?"</p>

<p>Laura's coy smile hinted many things. "I should say so. Since
the very first day in church. He said&mdash;but I don't like to
tell you what he said."</p>

<p>"You must!"</p>

<p>"No. You'll only call me conceited."</p>

<p>"No fear, Kiddy. Out with it!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, he said he saw me as soon as he got in the pulpit,
and he wondered ever so much who the girl was with the eyes like
sloes, and the skin like...like cream."</p>

<p>"Snakes-alive-oh! He went it strong."</p>

<p>"And how often were you alone with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and if he had met me before he was married&mdash;but no, I
can't tell any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be such an ass!"</p>

<p>"No, I can't. Well, I'll whisper it then...but only to Maria,"
and leaning over Laura put her lips to Maria's ear.</p>

<p>The reason for this by-stroke she could not have told: the
detail she imparted did not differ substantially from those that
had gone before. But by now she was at the end of her tether.</p>

<p>Here, fortunately for Laura, the dinner-bell rang, and the girls
had to take to their heels in order to get their books put away
before grace. Throughout the meal, from their scattered seats, they
exchanged looks of understanding, and their cheeks were pink.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Laura was again called on to prove her mettle.
Her companion on the daily walk was Kate Horner. Kate had been one
of the four, and did not lose this chance of beating up fresh
particulars.</p>

<p>After those first few awkward moments, however, which had come
wellnigh being a fiasco, Laura had no more trouble with her story.
Indeed, the plunge once taken, it was astounding how easy it became
to make up things about the Shepherds; the difficulty was, to know
where to stop. Fictitious details crowded thick and fast upon
her&mdash;a regular hotchpotch; she had only to stretch out her
hand and seize what she needed. It was simpler than the five-times
multiplication-table, and did not need to be learnt. But all the
same she was not idle: she polished away at her flimflams, bringing
them nearer and nearer probability, never, thanks to her sound
memory, contradicting herself or making a slip, and always able to
begin again from the beginning.</p>

<p>Such initial scepticism as may have lurked in her hearers was
soon got the better of. For, crass realists though these young
colonials were, and bluntly as they faced facts, they were none the
less just as hungry for romance as the most insatiable
novel-reader. Romance in any guise was hailed by them, and
swallowed uncritically, though it was no more permitted to
interfere with the practical conduct of their lives than it is in
the case of just that novel-reader, who puts untruth and unreality
from him, when he lays his book aside. Another and weightier reason
was, their slower brains could not conceive the possibility of such
extraordinarily detailed lying as that to which Laura now subjected
them. Its very elaboration stood for its truth.</p>

<p>And the days passed, and Laura had the happiest ideas. A strange
thing about them was that they came to her quite unsought, dropping
on her like Aladdin's oranges on his turban. All she had to do was
to fit them into their niche in her fabrication.</p>

<p>At first, her tale had been chiefly concerned with the internal
rift in Mr. Shepherd's home-life, and only in a minor degree with
herself. But her public savoured the love-story most, and hence,
consulting its taste, as it is the tale-maker's bounden duty to do,
Laura was obliged to develop this side of her narrative at the
expense of the other. And the more the girls heard, the more they
wished to hear. She had early turned Miss Isabella into a staunch
ally of her own, in the dissension she had introduced into the
curate's household; and one day she arrived at a hasty kiss, stolen
in the vestry after evening service, while Mr. Shepherd was taking
off his surplice. The puzzle had been, to get herself into the
vestry; but, once there, she saw what followed as if it had
actually happened. She saw Mr. Shepherd's arm slipped with
diffident alacrity round her waist, and her own virtuous recoil;
saw Maisie and Isabella waiting, sheep-like, in their pew, till it
should please the couple to emerge; saw the form of the verger
moving about the darkening church, as he put the lights out, one by
one.</p>

<p>But the success this incident brought her turned Laura's head,
making her so foolhardy in her inventions that Maria, who for all
her boldness of speech was at heart a prude like the rest, grew
uneasy.</p>

<p>"You're not to go to that house again, Kiddy. If you do, I'll
peach to old Gurley."</p>

<p>Laura ran upstairs to dress for tea, taking two steps at a time.
On the top landing, beside the great clothes-baskets, she collided
with Chinky, who was coming primly down.</p>

<p>"O ki, John!" she greeted her, being in a vast good-humour.
"What do you look so black for?"</p>

<p>"Dunno. Why do you never walk with me nowadays, Laura? I say,
you know about that ring? You haven't forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Course not. When am I to get it? It never turns up." Her eyes
glittered as she asked, for she foresaw a further link in her
chain. "Soon, now?"</p>

<p>Chinky nodded mysteriously. "Pretty soon. And you promise
faithfully never to take it off?"</p>

<p>"But it must be a <i>nice</i> one...with a red stone in it. And
listen, Chink, no one must ever know it was you who gave it
me."</p>

<p>"All right, I swear. You're a darling to say you'll wear it,"
and putting her arm round Laura's shoulders, Chinky gave her a
hearty kiss.</p>

<p>This was more than Laura had bargained for;&mdash;she freed
herself, ungraciously. "Oh, don't!&mdash;now mind, a red stone, and
for the third finger of the left hand."</p>

<p>"Yes. And Laura, I've thought of something to put inside.
<i>Semper eadem</i>...do you like that, Laura?"</p>

<p>"It'll do. Look out, there's old Day!" and leaving Chinky
standing, she ran down the corridor to her room.</p>

<h2>XVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>Der Verbrecher ist ha&uuml;fig genug seiner. Tat nicht
gewachsen.<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>For a month or more, Laura fed like a honeybee on the sweets of
success. And throve&mdash;even to the blindest eye. What had
hitherto been lacking was now hers: the admiration and applause of
her circle. And never was a child so spurred and uplifted by praise
as Laura. Without it, her nature tended to be wary and
unproductive; and those in touch with her, had they wished to make
the most of her, would no more have stinted with the necessary
incentive, that one stints a delicate rose tree in aids to growth.
Laura could swallow praise in large doses, without becoming
over-sure. Under the present stimulus she sat top in a couple of
classes, grew slightly ruddier in face, and much less shrinking in
manner.</p>

<p>"Call her back at once and make her shut that door," cried Miss
Day thickly, from behind one of the long, dining-hall tables, on
which were ranged stacks and piles of clean linen. She had been on
early duty since six o'clock.</p>

<p>The pupil-teacher in attendance stepped obediently into the
passage; and Laura returned.</p>

<p>"Doors are made to be shut, Laura Rambotham, I'd have you
remember that!" fumed Miss Day in the same indistinct voice: she
was in the grip of a heavy cold, which had not been improved by the
draughts of the hall.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Miss Day. I thought I had. I was a little late."</p>

<p>"That's your own lookout," barked the governess. "Oh, there you
are at last, Miss Snodgrass. I'd begun to think you weren't going
to appear at all this morning. It's close on a quarter past
seven."</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Miss Snodgrass laconically. "My watch must be
losing. Well, I suppose I can begin by marking Laura Rambotham down
late. What on earth are you standing there holding the door
for?"</p>

<p>"Miss Day knows&mdash;I don't," sauced Laura, and made her
escape.</p>

<p>She did not let Miss Snodgrass's bad mark disturb her. No sooner
had she begun her practising than she fell to work again on the
theme that occupied all her leisure moments, and was threatening to
assume the bulk of an early Victorian novel. But she now built at
her top-heavy edifice for her own enjoyment; and the usual fate of
the robust liar had overtaken her: she was beginning to believe in
her own lies. Still she never ventured to relax her critical
alertness, her careful surveillance of detail. For, just a day or
two before, she had seen a quick flare-up of incredulity light
Tilly's face, and oddly enough this had happened when she tried her
audience with a fact, a simple little fact, an incident that had
really occurred. She had killed the doubt, instantly, by smothering
it with a fiction; but she could not forget that it had existed. It
has very perplexing; for otherwise her hearers did not shy at a
mortal thing; she could drive them where and how she chose.</p>

<p>At the present moment she was planning a great coup: nothing
more or less than a frustrated attempt on her virtue. It was almost
ready to be submitted to them&mdash;for she had read <i>Pamela</i>
with heartfelt interest during the holidays&mdash;and only a few
connecting links were missing, with which to complete her own
case.</p>

<p>Then, without the slightest warning, the blow fell.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday afternoon; the half-hour that preceded Sunday
school. Laura, in company with several others, was in the garden,
getting her Bible chapter by heart, when Maria called her.</p>

<p>"Laura! Come here. I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>Laura approached, her lips in busy motion. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"I say, chicken, your nose is going to be put out of joint."</p>

<p>"Mine? What do you mean?" queried Laura, and had a faint sense
of impending disaster.</p>

<p>"What I say. M. Pidwall's asked to the you-know-who's next
Saturday."</p>

<p>"No, she's not!" cried Laura vehemently, and clapped her Bible
to.</p>

<p>"S'help me God, she is," asserted Maria. "Look out, don't set
the place on fire."</p>

<p>"How do you know?...who told you?"</p>

<p>"M. P. herself&mdash;Gosh, but you are a jealous little cub. Oh,
go on, Kiddy, don't take it like that. I guess he won't give you
away."&mdash;For Laura was as pale as a moment before she had been
scarlet.</p>

<p>Alleging a violent headache, she mounted to her room, and sat
down on her bed. She felt stunned, and it took her some time to
recover her wits. Sitting on the extreme edge of the bedstead, she
stared at the objects in the room without seeing them. "M. P.'s
going there on Saturday...M. P.'s going there on Saturday," she
repeated stupidly, and, with her hands pressed on her hips, rocked
herself to and fro, after the fashion of an older woman in
pain.</p>

<p>The fact was too appalling to be faced; her mind postponed it.
Instead, she saw the fifty-five at Sunday school&mdash;where they
were at this minute&mdash;drawn up in a line round the walls of the
dining-hall. She saw them rise to wail out the hymn; saw Mr.
Strachey on his chair in the middle of the floor, perpetually
nimming with his left leg. And, as she pictured the familiar scene
to herself, she shivered with a sudden sense of isolation: behind
each well-known face lurked a possible enemy.</p>

<p>If it had only not been M. P.!&mdash;that was the first thought
that crystallised. Anyone else!...from any of the rest she might
have hoped for some mercy. But Mary Pidwall was one of those
people&mdash;there were plenty such&mdash;before whom a nature like
Laura's was inclined, at the best of times, to shrink away, keenly
aware of its own paltriness and ineffectualness. Mary was rectitude
in person: and it cannot be denied that, to Laura, this was
synonymous with hard, narrow, ungracious. Not quite a prig, though:
there was fun in Mary, and life in her; but it was neither fun nor
vivacity of a kind that Laura could feel at ease with. Such capers
as the elder girl cut were only skin-deep; they were on the surface
of her character, had no real roots in her: just as the pieces of
music she played on the piano were accidents of the moment, without
deeper significance. To Mary, life was already serious, full of
duties. She knew just what she wanted, too, where she wanted to go
and how to get there; her plans were cut and dried. She was clever,
very industrious, the head of several of her classes. Nor was she
ever in conflict with the authorities: she moved among the rules of
the school as safely as an egg-dancer among his eggs. For the
simple reasons that temptations seemed to pass her by. There was,
besides, a kind of manly exactness in her habit of thinking and
speaking; and it was this trait her companions tried to symbolise,
in calling her by the initial letters of her name.</p>

<p>She and Laura, though classmates, had never drawn together. It
is true, Mary was sixteen, and, at that time of life, a couple of
years dig a wide breach. But there was also another reason. Once,
in the innocence of her heart, Laura had let the cat out of the bag
that an uncle of hers lived in the up-country township to which
Mary belonged.</p>

<p>The girl had eyed her coldly, incredulously. "What? That
dreadful man your uncle?" she had exclaimed: she herself was the
daughter of a church dignitary. "I should say I did know
him&mdash;by reputation at least. And it's quite enough, thank
you."</p>

<p>Now Laura had understood that Uncle Tom&mdash;he needed but a
pair of gold earrings to pose as the model for a Spanish
Grandee&mdash;that Uncle Tom <i>was</i> odd, in this way: he
sometimes took more to drink than was good for him; but she had
never suspected him of being "dreadful", or a byword in
Wantabadgery. Colouring to the roots of her hair, she murmured
something about him of course not being recognised by the rest of
the family; but M. P., she was sure, had never looked on her with
the same eyes again.</p>

<p>Such was the rigid young moralist into whose hands her fate was
given.</p>

<p>She sat and meditated these things, in spiritless fashion. She
would have to confess to her fabrications&mdash;that was plain. M.
P.'s precise mind would bring back a precise account of how matters
stood in the Shepherd household: not by an iota would the truth be
swerved from. Why, oh why, had she not foreseen this possibility?
What evil spirit had prompted her and led her on?&mdash;But, before
her brain could contemplate the awful necessity of rising and
branding herself as a liar, it sought desperately for a means of
escape. For a wink, she even nursed the idea of dragging in a sham
man, under the pretence that Mr. Shepherd had been but a blind,
used by her to screen some one else. But this yarn, twist it as she
might, would not pass muster. Against it was the mass of her
accumulated detail.</p>

<p>She sat there, devising scheme after scheme. Not one of them
would do.</p>

<p>When, at tea-time, she rose to wash her face before going
downstairs, the sole point on which she had come to clearness was,
that just seven days lay between her and detection. Yet after all,
she reminded herself, seven days made a week, and a week was a good
long time. Perhaps something would happen between now and Saturday.
M. P. might have an accident and break her leg, and not be able to
go. Or thin, poorly-fed Mr. Shepherd fall ill from overwork. Oh,
how she would rejoice to hear of it!</p>

<p>And, if the worst came to the worst and she <i>had</i> to tell,
at least it should not be to-day. To-day was Sunday; and people's
thoughts were frightfully at liberty. To-morrow they would be
engaged again; and, by to-morrow, she herself would have grown more
accustomed to the idea. Besides, how foolish to have been in too
great a hurry, should something come to pass that rendered
confession needless.</p>

<p>On waking next morning, however, and accounting, with a throb,
for the leaden weight on her mind, she felt braver, and quite
determined to make a clean breast of her misdoings. Things could
not go on like this. But no sooner was she plunged into the routine
of the day than her decision slackened: it was impossible to find
just the right moment to begin. Early in the morning everyone was
busy looking over lessons, and would not thank you for the upset,
the dinner-hour was all too short; after school, on the walk, she
had a partner who knew nothing about the affair, and after tea she
practised. Hence, on Monday her purpose failed her.</p>

<p>On Tuesday it was the same; the right moment never presented
itself.</p>

<p>In bed that night she multiplied the remaining days into hours.
They made one hundred and twenty. That heartened her a little;
considered thus, the time seemed very much longer; and so she let
Wednesday slip by, without over-much worry.</p>

<p>On Thursday she not only failed to own up, but indulged
anew.</p>

<p>All the week, as if Mary Pidwall's coming visit worked upon
them, the girls had been very greedy for more love-story, and had
shown themselves decidedly nettled by Laura's refusal to continue;
for this was the week when the great revelation she had hinted at
should have been made. And one afternoon when the four were
twitting her, and things were looking very black, Laura was incited
by some devil to throw them, not, it is true, the savoury incident
their mouths watered for, but a fresh fiction&mdash;just as the
beset traveller throws whatever he has at hand, to the ravenous
wolves that press round the sledge. At the moment, the excitement
that accompanies inspiration kept her up; but afterwards she had a
stinging fit of remorse; and her self-reproaches were every whit as
bitter as those of the man who has again broken the moral law he
has vowed to respect, and who now sees that he is powerless against
recurring temptation.</p>

<p>When she remembered those four rapacious faces, Laura realised
that, come what might, she would never have the courage to confess.
To them, at least. That night in deep humility she laid her sin
bare to God, imploring Him, even though He could not pardon it, to
avert the consequences from her.</p>

<p>The last days were also darkened by her belief that M. P. had
got wind of her romancings: as, indeed, was quite likely; for the
girls' tongues were none too safe. Mary looked at her from time to
time with such a sternly suspicious eye that Laura's very stomach
quailed within her.</p>

<p>And meanwhile the generous hours had declined to less than
half.</p>

<p>"Twice more to get up, and twice to go to bed," she reckoned
aloud to herself on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>She was spending that week-end at Godmother's. It was as dull as
usual; she had ample leisure to brood over what lay before her. It
was now a certainty, fixed, immovable; for, by leaving school that
day without having spoken, she had burned her ships behind her.
When she went back on Monday M. P. would be there, and every
loophole closed. On Sunday evening she made an excuse and went down
into the garden. There was no moon; but, overhead, the indigo-blue
was a prodigal glitter of stars&mdash;myriads of silver eyes that
perforated the sky. They sparkled with a cold disregard of the
small girl standing under the mulberry tree; but Laura, too, was
only half-alive to their magnificence. Her thoughts ran on suicide,
on making an end of her blighted career. God was evidently not
going to be generous or long-suffering enough to come to her aid;
and in imagination she saw the fifty-five gaining on her like a
pack of howling hyaenas; saw Mrs. Gurley, Mr.
Strachey&mdash;Mother. Detection and exposure, she knew it now,
were the most awful things the world held. But she had nothing
handy: neither a rope, nor poison, nor was there a dam in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>That night she had the familiar dream that she was being "stood
up" and expelled, as Annie Johns had been: thousands of tongues
shouted her guilt; she was hunted like a wallaby. She wakened with
a scream, and Marina, her bedfellow, rose on one elbow and lighted
the candle. Crumpled and dishevelled, Laura lay outside the sheet
that should have covered her; and her pillow had slipped to the
floor.</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter? Dreaming? Then depend on it you've
eaten something that's disagreed with you."</p>

<p>How she dragged her legs back to school that morning, Laura
never knew. At the sight of the great stone building her inner
disturbance was such that she was nearly sick. Even the unobservant
Marina was forced to a remark.</p>

<p>"You do look a bit peaky. I'm sure your stomach's out of order.
Your should take a dose of castor-oil to-night, before you go to
bed."</p>

<p>Though it was a blazing November day, her fingers were cold as
she took off her hat and changed her white frock. "For the last
time," she murmured; by which she meant the last time in
untarnished honour. And she folded and hung up her clothes, with a
neatness that was foreign to her.</p>

<p>Classes were in full swing when she went downstairs; nothing
could happen now till the close of morning school. But Laura
signalised the beginning of her downfall, the end of her comet-like
flight, by losing her place in one form after another, the lessons
she had prepared on Friday evening having gone clean out of her
head.</p>

<p>Directly half-past twelve struck, she ran to the top of the
garden and hid herself under a tree. There she crouched, her
fingers in her ears, her heart thumping as if it would break. Till
the dinner-bell rang. Then she was forced to emerge&mdash;and no
tottering criminal, about to face the scaffold, has ever had more
need of Dutch courage than Laura in this moment. Peeping round the
corner of the path she saw the fateful group: M. P. the centre of
four gesticulating figures. She loitered till they had scattered
and disappeared; then with shaking legs crept to the house. At the
long tables the girls still stood, waiting for Mr. Strachey; and
the instant Laura set foot in the hall, five pairs of eyes caught
her, held her, pinned her down, as one pins a butterfly to a board.
She was much too far gone to think of tossing her head and braving
things out, now that the crisis had come. Pale, guilty, wretched,
she sidled to her seat. This was near Maria's, and, as she passed,
Maria leant back.</p>

<p>"You <i>vile</i> little liar!"</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>"How's that shy little mouse of a girl we had here a month or
two ago?" Mr. Shepherd had inquired. "Let me see&mdash;what was her
name again?"</p>

<p>To which Miss Isabella had replied: "Well, you know, Robby dear,
you really hardly saw her. You had so much to do, poor boy, just
when she was here. Her name was Laura&mdash;Laura Rambotham."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Shepherd gently: "Yes, a nice little girl. But very
young for her age. And <i>so</i> shy."</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>"You wretched little lying sneak!"</p>

<p>In vain Laura wept and protested.</p>

<p>"You made me do it. I should never have told a word, if it
hadn't been for you."</p>

<p>This point of view enraged them. "What? You want to put it on us
now, do you?...you dirty little skunk! To say <i>we</i> made you
tell that pack of lies?&mdash;Look here: as long as you stay in
this blooming shop, I'll never open my mouth to you again!"</p>

<p>"Someone ought to tell old Gurley and have her expelled. That's
all she's fit for. Spreading disgusting stories about people who've
been kind to her. They probably only asked her there out of
charity. She's as poor as dirt."</p>

<p>"Wants her bottom smacked&mdash;that's what I say!"</p>

<p>Thus Maria, and, with her, Kate Horner.</p>

<p>Tilly was cooler and bitterer. "I was a dashed fool ever to
believe a word. I might have known her little game. She? Why, when
I took her out to see my cousin Bob, she couldn't say bo to a
goose. He laughed about her afterwards like anything; said she
ought to have come in a perambulator, with a nurse. <i>You</i> make
anyone in love with you&mdash;you!" And Tilly spat, to show her
disdain.</p>

<p>"What have they been saying to you, Laura?" whispered Chinky,
pale and frightened. "Whatever is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Mind your own business and go away," sobbed Laura.</p>

<p>"I am, I'm going," said Chinky humbly. "Oh, Laura, I <i>wish</i>
you had that ring."</p>

<p>"Oh, blow you and your ring! I hate the very name of it," cried
Laura, maddened. And retreating to a lavatory, which was the only
private place in the school, she wept her full.</p>

<p>They all, every girl of them, understood white lies, and
practised them. They might also have forgiven her a lie of the
good, plain, straightforward, thumping order. What they could not
forgive, or get over, was the extraordinary circumstantiality of
the fictions which with she had gulled them: to be able to invent
lies with such proficiency meant that you had been born with a
criminal bent. And as a criminal she was accordingly treated.</p>

<p>Even the grown-up girls heard a garbled version of the
story.</p>

<p>"Whyever did you do it?" one of them asked Laura curiously; it
was a very pretty girl, called Evelyn, with twinkling brown
eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Laura abjectly; and this was almost
true.</p>

<p>"But I say!...nasty tarradiddles about people who'd been so nice
to you? What made you tell them?"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>know</i>. They just came."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes smiled. "Well, I never! Poor little Kiddy," she
said as she turned away.</p>

<p>But this was the only kind word Laura heard. For many and many a
night after, she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<h2>XIX.</h2>

<p>Thus Laura went to Coventry. Not that the social banishment she
now suffered was known by that name. To the majority of the girls
Coventry was just a word in the geography book, a place where
ribbons were said to be made, and where for a better-read few, some
one had hung with grooms and porters on a bridge; this detail, odd
to say, making a deeper impression on their young minds than the
story of Lady Godiva, which was looked upon merely as a naughty
anecdote.</p>

<p>But, by whatever name it was known, Laura's ostracism was
complete. She had been sampled, tested, put on one side. And not
the softest-hearted could find an excuse for her behaviour.</p>

<p>It was but another instance of how misfortune dogs him who is
down, that Chinky should choose this very moment to bring further
shame upon her.</p>

<p>On one of the miserable days that were now the rule, when Laura
would have liked best to be a rabbit, hid deep in its burrow; as
she was going upstairs one afternoon, she met Jacob, the
man-of-all-work, coming down. He had a trunk on his shoulder.
Throughout the day she had been aware of a subdued excitement among
the boarders; they had stood about in groups, talking in low
voices&mdash;talking about her, she believed, from the glances that
were thrown over shoulders at her as she passed. She made herself
as small as she could; but when tea-time came, and then supper, and
Chinky had not appeared at either meal, curiosity got the better of
her, and she tried to pump one of the younger girls.</p>

<p>Maria came up while she was speaking, and the child ran away;
for the little ones aped their elders in making Laura taboo.</p>

<p>"What, liar? You want to stuff us you don't know why she's
gone?" said Maria. "No, thank you, it's not good enough. You can't
bamboozle us this time."</p>

<p>"Sapphira up to her tricks again, is she?" threw in the
inseparable Kate, who had caught the last words. "No, by dad, we
don't tell liars what they know already. So put that in your pipe
and smoke it!"</p>

<p>Only bit by bit did Laura dig out their meaning: then, the
horrible truth lay bare. Chinky had been dismissed&mdash;privately
because she was a boarder&mdash;from the school. Her crime was: she
had taken half-a-sovereign from the purse of one of her room-mates.
When taxed with the theft, she wept that she had not taken it for
herself, but to buy a ring for Laura Rambotham; and, with this
admission on her lips, she passed out of their lives, leaving
Laura, her confederate, behind. Yes, confederate; for, in the minds
of most, liar and thief were synonymous.</p>

<p>Laura had not cared two straws for Chinky; she found what the
latter had done, "mean and disgusting", and said so, stormily; but
of course was not believed. Usually too proud to defend herself,
she here returned to the charge again and again; for the hint of
connivance had touched her on the raw. But she strove in vain to
prove her innocence: she could not get her enemies to grasp the
abysmal difference between merely making up a story about people,
and laying hands on others' property; if she could do the one, she
was capable of the other; and her companions remained convinced
that, if she had not actually had her fingers in some one's purse,
she had, by a love of jewellery, incited Chinky to the theft. And
so, after a time, Laura gave up the attempt and suffered in
silence; and it <i>was</i> suffering; for her schoolfellows were
cruel with that intolerance, that unimaginative dullness, which
makes a woman's cruelty so hard to bear. Laura had to accustom
herself to hear every word she said doubted; to hear some one
called to, before her face, to attest her statements; to see her
room-mates lock up their purses under her very nose.</p>

<p>However, only three weeks had still to run till the Christmas
holidays. She drew twenty-one strokes on a sheet of paper, which
she pinned to the wall above her bed; and each morning she ran her
pencil through a fresh line. She was quite resolved to beg Mother
not to send her back to school: if she said she was not getting
proper food, that would be enough to put Mother up in arms.</p>

<p>The boxes were being fetched from the lumber-rooms and
distributed among their owners, when a letter arrived from Mother
saying that the two little boys had sandy blight, and that Laura
would not be able to come home under two or three weeks, for fear
of infection. These weeks she was to spend, in company with Pin, at
a watering-place down the Bay, where one of her aunts had a
cottage.</p>

<p>The news was welcome to Laura: she had shrunk from the thought
of Mother's searching eye. And at the cottage there would be none
of her grown-up relatives to face; only an old housekeeper, who was
looking after a party of boys.</p>

<p>Hence, when speech day was over, instead of setting out on an
up-country railway journey, Laura, under the escort of Miss
Snodgrass, went on board one of the steamers that ploughed the
Bay.</p>

<p>"I should say sea-air'll do you good&mdash;brighten you up a
bit," said the governess affably as they drove: she was in great
good-humour at the prospect of losing sight for a time of the
fifty-five. "You seem to be always in the dumps nowadays."</p>

<p>Laura dutifully waved her handkerchief from the deck of the
<i>Silver Star</i>; and the paddles began to churn. As Miss
Snodgrass's back retreated down the pier, and the breach between
ship and land widened, she settled herself on her seat with a
feeling of immense relief. At last&mdash;at last she was off. The
morning had been a sore trial to her: in all the noisy and effusive
leave-taking, she was odd man out; no one had been sorry to part
from her; no one had extracted a promise that she would write. Her
sole valediction had been a minatory shaft from Maria: if she
valued her skin, to learn to stop telling crams before she showed
up there again. Now, she was free of them; she would not be
humiliated afresh, would not need to stand eye to eye with anyone
who knew of her disgrace, for weeks to come; perhaps never again,
if Mother agreed. Her heart grew momentarily lighter. And the
farther they left Melbourne behind them, the higher her spirits
rose.</p>

<p>But then, too, was it possible, on this radiant December day,
long to remain in what Miss Snodgrass had called "the
dumps"?&mdash;The sea was a blue-green mirror, on the surface of
which they swam. The sky was a stretched sheet of blue, in which
the sun hung a very ball of fire. But the steamer cooled the air as
it moved; and none of the white-clad people who, under the
stretched white awnings, thronged the deck, felt oppressed by the
great heat. In the middle of the deck, a brass band played popular
tunes.</p>

<p>At a pretty watering-place where they stopped, Laura rose and
crossed to the opposite railing. A number of passengers went
ashore, pushing and laughing, but almost as many more came on
board, all dressed in white, and with eager, animated faces. Then
the boat stood to sea again and sailed past high, grass-grown
cliffs, from which a few old cannons, pointing their noses at you,
watched over the safety of the Bay&mdash;in the event, say, of the
Japanese or the Russians entering the Heads past the pretty
township, and the beflagged bathing-enclosures on the beach below.
They neared the tall, granite lighthouse at the point, with the
flagstaff at its side where incoming steamers were signalled; and
as soon as they had rounded this corner they were in view of the
Heads themselves. From the distant cliffs there ran out, on either
side, brown reefs, which made the inrushing water dance and foam,
and the entrance to the Bay narrow and dangerous: on one side,
there projected the portion of a wreck which had lain there as long
as Laura had been in the world. Then, having made a sharp turn to
the left, the boat crossed to the opposite coast, and steamed past
barrack-like buildings lying asleep in the fierce sunshine of the
afternoon; and, in due course, it stopped at Laura's
destination.</p>

<p>Old Anne was waiting on the jetty, having hitched the horse to a
post: she had driven in, in the 'shandrydan', to meet Laura. For
the cottage was not on the front beach, with the hotels and
boarding-houses, the fenced-in baths and great gentle slope of
yellow sand: it stood in the bush, on the back beach, which gave to
the open sea.</p>

<p>Laura took her seat beside the old woman in her linen sunbonnet,
the body of the vehicle being packed full of groceries and other
stores; and the drive began. Directly they were clear of the
township the road as good as ceased, became a mere sandy track,
running through a scrub of ti-trees. And what sand! White, dry,
sliding sand, through which the horse shuffled and floundered, in
which the wheels sank and stuck. Had one of the many hillocks to be
taken, the two on the box-seat instinctively threw their weight
forward; old Anne, who had a stripped wattle-bough for a whip,
urged and cajoled; and more than once she handed Laura the reins
and got down, to give the horse a pull. They had always to be
ducking their heads, too, to let the low ti-tree branches sweep
over their backs.</p>

<p>About a couple of miles out, the old woman alighted and slipped
a rail; and having passed the only other house within cooee, they
drove through a paddock, but at a walking-pace, because of the
thousands of rabbit-burrows that perforated the ground. Another
slip-rail lowered, they drew up at the foot of a steepish hill,
beside a sandy little vegetable garden, a shed and a pump. The
house was perched on the top of the hill, and directly they sighted
it they also saw Pin flying down, her sunbonnet on her neck.</p>

<p>"Laura, Laura! Oh, I <i>am</i> glad you've come. What a time
you've been!"</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pin. Oh, I say, let me get out first."</p>

<p>"And pull up your bonnet, honey. D'you want to be after gettin'
sunstruck?"</p>

<p>Glad though Laura was to see her sister again, she did not
manage to infuse a very hearty tone into her greeting; for her
first glimpse of Pin had given her a disagreeable shock. It was
astonishing, the change the past half-year had worked in the child;
and as the two climbed the hill together, to the accompaniment of
Pin's bubbly talk, Laura stole look after look at her little
sister, in the hope of growing used to what she saw. Pin had never
been pretty, but now she was "downright hideous"&mdash;as Laura
phrased it to herself. Eleven years of age, she had at last begun
to grow in earnest: her legs were as of old mere spindleshanks, but
nearly twice as long; and her fat little body, perched above them,
made one think of a shrivelled-up old man who has run all to
paunch. Her face, too, had increased in shapelessness, the features
being blurred in the fat mass; her blue eyes were more slit-like
than before; and, to cap everything, her fine skin had absolutely
no chance, so bespattered was it with freckles. And none of your
pretty little sun-kisses; but large, black, irregular freckles that
disfigured like moles. Laura felt quite distressed; it outraged her
feelings that anyone belonging to her should be so ugly; and as
Pin, in happy ignorance of her sister's reflections, chattered on,
Laura turned over in her mind what she ought to do. She would have
to tell Pin about herself&mdash;that was plain: she must break the
news to her, in case others should do it, and more cruelly. It was
one consolation to know that Pin was not sensitive about her looks;
so long as you did not tease her about her legs, there was no limit
to what you might say to her: the grieving was all for the
onlooker. But not today: this was the first day; and there were
pleasanter things to think of. And so, when they had had
tea&mdash;with condensed milk in it, for the cow had gone dry, and
no milkman came out so far&mdash;when tea was over&mdash;and that
was all that could be undertaken in the way of refreshment after
the journey; washing your face and hands, for instance, was out of
the question; every drop of water had to be carried up the hill
from the pump, and old Anne purposely kept the ewers empty by day;
if you <i>would</i> wash, you must wash in the sea&mdash;as soon,
then, as tea was over, the two sisters made for the beach.</p>

<p>The four-roomed, weatherboard cottage, to which at a later date
a lean-to had been added, faced the bush: from the verandah there
was a wide view of the surrounding country. Between the back of the
house and the beach rose a huge sand-hill, sparsely grown with
rushes and coarse grass. It took you some twenty minutes to toil
over this, and boots and stockings were useless impedimenta; for
the sand was once more of that loose and shifting kind in which you
sank at times up to the knees, falling back one step for every two
you climbed. But then, sand was the prevailing note of this free
and easy life: it bestrewed verandah and floors; you carried it in
your clothes; the beds were full of it; it even got into the food;
and you were soon so accustomed to its presence that you missed the
grit of it under foot, or the prickling on your skin, did old Anne
happen to take a broom in her hand, or thoroughly re-make the beds.
When, however, on your way to the beach you had laboriously
attained the summit of the great dune, the sight that met you
almost took your breath away: as far as the eye could reach, the
bluest of skies melting into the bluest of seas, which broke its
foam-flecked edge against the flat, brown reefs that fringed the
shore. Then, downhill&mdash;with a trip and a flounder that sent
the sand man-high&mdash;and at last you were on what Laura and Pin
thought the most wonderful beach in the world. What a variety of
things was there! Whitest, purest sand, hot to the touch as a zinc
roof in summer; rocky caves, and sandy caves hung with crumbly
stalactites; at low tide, on the reef, lakes and ponds and rivers
deep enough to make it unnecessary for you to go near the
ever-angry surf at all; seaweeds that ran through the gamut of
colours: brown and green, pearl-pink and coral-pink, to vivid
scarlet and orange; shells, beginning with tiny grannies and
cowries, and ending with the monsters in which the breakers had
left their echo; the bones of cuttlefish, light as paper, and
shaped like javelins. And, what was best of all, this beach
belonged to them alone; they had not to share its treasures with
strangers; except the inhabitants of the cottage, never a soul set
foot upon it.</p>

<p>The chief business of the morning was to bathe. If the girls
were alone and the tide full, they threw off their clothes and ran
into a sandy, shallow pool, where the water never came above their
waists, and where it was safe to let the breakers dash over them.
But if the tide were low, the boys bathed, too, and then Pin and
Laura tied themselves up in old bathing-gowns that were too big for
them, and all went in a body to the "Half-Moon Hole". This pool,
which was about twenty feet long and ten to fifteen deep, lay far
out on the reef, and, at high tide, was hidden beneath surf and
foam; at low water, on the other hand, it was like a glass mirror
reflecting the sky, and so clear that you could see every weed that
waved at the bottom. Having cast off your shoes, you applied your
soles gingerly to the prickles of the rock; then plop!&mdash;and in
you went. Pin often needed a shove from behind, for nowhere, of
course, could you get a footing; but Laura swam with the best. Some
of the boys would dive to the bottom and bring up weeds and shells,
but Laura and Pin kept on the surface of the water; for they had
the imaginative dread common to children who know the sea
well&mdash;the dread of what may lurk beneath the thick, black
horrors of seaweed.</p>

<p>Then, after an hour or so in the water, home to dinner, hungry
as swagmen, though the bill of fare never varied: it was always
rabbit for dinner, crayfish for tea; for the butcher called only
once a week, and meat could not be kept an hour without getting
flyblown. The rabbits were skinned and in the stew-pot before they
were cold; the crayfish died an instant death: one that drove the
blood to Laura's head, and made Pin run away and cry, with her
fingers to her ears; for she believed the sizzling of the water, as
the fish were dropped in, to be the shriek of the creatures in
their death-agony.</p>

<p>Except in bathing, the girls saw little of the boys. Both were
afraid of guns, so did not go out on the expeditions which supplied
the dinner-table; and old Anne would not allow them to join the
crayfishing excursions. For these took place by night, off the end
of the reef, with nets and torches; and it sometimes happened, if
the surf were heavy, that one of the fishers was washed off the
rocks, and only hauled up again with considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>Laura took her last peep at the outside world, every evening, in
the brief span of time between sunset and dark. Running up to the
top of one of the hills, and letting her eyes range over sky and
sea, she would drink in the scents that were waking to life after
the burning heat of the day: salt water, warmed sand and seaweeds,
ti-scrub, sour-grass, and the sturdy berry-bushes, high as her
knee, through which she had ploughed her way. That was one of the
moments she liked best, that, and lying in bed at night listening
to the roar of the surf, which went on and on like a cannonade,
even though the hill lay between. It made her flesh crawl, too, in
delightful fashion, did she picture to herself how alone she and
Pin were, in their room: the boys slept in the lean-to on the other
side of the kitchen; old Anne at the back. For miles round, no
house broke the solitude of the bush; only a thin wooden partition
separated her from possible bushrangers, from the vastness and
desolation of the night, the eternal booming of the sea.</p>

<p>Such was the life into which Laura now threw herself heart and
soul, forgetting, in the sheer joy of living, her recent
tribulation.</p>

<p>But even the purest pleasures <i>will</i> pall; and after a
time, when the bloom had worn off and the newness and her mind was
more at leisure again, she made some disagreeable discoveries which
ruffled her tranquillity.</p>

<p>It was Pin, poor, fat, little well-meaning Pin, who did the
mischief</p>

<p>Pin was not only changed in looks; her character had changed,
too; and in so marked a way that before a week was out the sisters
were at loggerheads. Each day made it plainer to Laura that Pin was
developing a sturdy independence; she had ceased to look up to
Laura as a prodigy of wisdom, and had begun to hold opinions of her
own. She was, indeed, even disposed to be critical of her sister;
and criticism from this quarter was more than Laura could brook: it
was just as if a slave usurped his master's rights. At first
speechless with surprise, she ended by losing her temper; the more,
because Pin was prone to be mulish, and could not be got to budge,
either by derision or by scorn, from her espoused views. They were
those of the school at which for the past half-year she had been a
day-pupil, and seemed to her unassailable. Laura found them
ridiculous, as she did much else about Pin at this time: her
ugliness, her setting herself up as an authority: and she jeered
unkindly whenever Pin came out with them. A still more ludicrous
thing was that, despite her plainness, Pin actually had an admirer.
True, she did not say so outright; perhaps she was not even aware
of it; but Laura gathered from her talk that a boy at her school, a
boy some three years older than herself, had given her a silk
handkerchief and liked to help her with her sums. And to Laura this
was the most knockdown blow of all.</p>

<p>One day it came to an open quarrel between them.</p>

<p>They were lying on the beach after bathing, trying to protect
their bare and blistered legs from the sandflies. Laura, flat on
her back, had spread a towel over hers; Pin sat Turk&mdash;fashion
with her legs beneath her and fought the flies with her hands.
Having vainly endeavoured to draw from the reticent Laura some of
those school-tales of which, in former holidays, she had been so
prodigal, Pin was now chattering to her heart's content, about the
small doings of home. Laura listened to her with the impatient
toleration of one who has seen the world: she really could not be
expected to interest herself in such trifles; and she laughed in
her sleeve at Pin's simpleness. When, however, her little sister
began to enlarge anew on some wonderful orders Mother had lately
had, she could not refrain from saying crossly: "You've told me
that a dozen times already. And you needn't bawl it out for
everyone to hear."</p>

<p>"Oh, Laura! there isn't anyone anywhere near us...and even if
there were&mdash;why, I thought you'd be so pleased. Mother's going
to give you an extra shilling pocket-money, 'cause of it."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm pleased. Don't be so silly, Pin."</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>always</i> silly, Laura," protested Pin. "And I
don't believe you <i>are</i> glad, a bit. Old Anne was, though. She
said: 'Bless her dear heart!'"</p>

<p>"Old Anne? Well, I just wonder what next! It's none of her
dashed business."</p>

<p>"Oh, Laura!" began Pin, growing tearful both at words and tone.
"Why, Laura, you're not ashamed of it, are you?&mdash;that mother
does sewing?"&mdash;and Pin opened her lobelia-blue eyes to their
widest, showing what very big eyes they would be, were they not so
often swollen with crying.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Laura tartly. "But I'm blessed if I can
see what it's got to do with old Anne."</p>

<p>"But she asked me...what mother was working at&mdash;and if
she'd got any new customers. She just loves mother."</p>

<p>"Like her cheek!" snapped Laura. "Poking her ugly old nose into
what doesn't concern her. You should just have said you didn't
know."</p>

<p>"But that would have been a story, Laura!" cried Pin, horrified
"I did know&mdash;quite well."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, Pin, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've never told a story in my life," said Pin hotly. "And I'm
not going to either, for you or anyone. I think you ought to be
ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>"Hold your silly tongue!"</p>

<p>"I shan't, Laura. And I think you're very wicked. You're not a
bit like what you used to be. And it's all going to school that's
done it&mdash;Mother says it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be such a blooming ass!" and Laura, stung to the
quick, retaliated by taunting Pin with the change that had come to
pass in her appearance. To her surprise, she found Pin grown
inordinately touchy about her looks: at Laura's brutal statement of
the truth she cried bitterly.</p>

<p>"I'm not, no, I'm not! I haven't got a full moon for a face!
It's no fatter than yours. Sarah said last time you were home how
fat you were getting."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm not," said Laura, indignant in her turn.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are," sobbed Pin. "But you only think other people are
ugly, not yourself I'll tell mother what you've said as soon as
ever I get home. And I'll tell her, too, you want to make me tell
stories. And that I'm sure you've done something naughty at school,
'cause you won't ever talk about it. And how you're always saying
bad words like blooming and gosh and golly&mdash;yes, I will!"</p>

<p>"You were always a sneak and a tell-tale."</p>

<p>"And you were always a greedy, selfish, deceitful thing."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about me, you numbskull, you!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to! I know you're a bad, wicked girl."</p>

<p>After this exchange of home truths, they did not speak to each
other for two days: Pin had a temper that smouldered, and could not
easily forgive. So she stayed at old Anne's side, helping to bake
scones and leatherjackets; or trotted after the boys, who had
dropped into the way of saying: "Come on, little Pin!" as they
never said: "Come on, Laura!" and Laura retired in lonely dudgeon
to the beach.</p>

<p>She took the estrangement so much to heart that she eased her
feelings by abusing Pin in thought; Pin was a pig-headed little
ignoramus, as timid as ever of setting one foot before the other.
And the rest of them would be just the same&mdash;old stick-in-the
muds, unchanged by a hair, or, if they <i>had</i> changed, then
changed for the worse. Laura had somehow never foreseen the day on
which she would find herself out of tune with her home circle; with
unthinking assurance she had expected that Pin, for instance, would
always be eager to keep pace with her. Now, she saw that her little
sister would probably never catch up to her again. Such progress as
Pin might make&mdash;if she were not already glued firm to her
silly notions&mdash;would be in quite another direction. For the
quarrel had made one thing plain to Laura: with regard to her
troubles, she need not look to Pin for sympathy: if Pin talked such
gibberish at the hint of putting off an inquisitive old woman, what
would she&mdash;and not she alone&mdash;what would they all say to
the tissue of lies Laura had spun round Mr. Shepherd, a holy man, a
clergyman, and a personal friend of Mother's into the bargain? She
could not blink the fact that, did it come to their ears, they
would call her in earnest, what Pin had called her in her
temper&mdash;bad and wicked. Home was, alas! no longer the snug
nest in which she was safe from the slings and shanghais of the
world.</p>

<p>And then there was another thing: did she stay at home, she
would have to re-live herself into the thousand and one gimcrack
concerns, which now, as set forth by Pin, so bored her: the colic
Leppie had brought on by eating unripe fruit; the fact that another
of Sarah's teeth had dropped out without extraneous aid. It was all
very well for a week or two, but, at the idea of shutting herself
wholly up with such mopokes, of cutting herself off from her
present vital interests, Laura hastily reconsidered her decision to
leave school. No: badly as she had suffered at her companions'
hands, much as she dreaded returning, it was at school she
belonged. All her heart was there: in the doings of her equals, the
things that really mattered&mdash;who would be promoted, who
prefect, whose seat changed in the dining-hall. Besides, could one
who had experienced the iron rule of Mr. Strachey, or Mrs. Gurley,
ever be content to go back and just form one of a family of
children? She not, at any rate!</p>

<p>Thus she lay, all day long, her hands clasped under her neck, a
small white speck on the great wave-lapped beach. She watched the
surf break, watched the waves creep up and hide the reef, watched
the gulls vanish in the sun-saturated blue overhead. Sometimes she
rose to her elbow to follow a ship just inside the horizon; and it
pleased her to think that this great boat was sailing off, with a
load of lucky mortals, to some unknown, fairer world, while she, a
poor Cinderella, had to stop behind&mdash;even though she knew it
was only the English mail going on to Sydney. Of Pin she preferred
not to think; nor could she dwell with equanimity on her late
misfortunes at school and the trials that awaited her on her
reappearance; and since she <i>had</i> to think of something, she
fell into the habit of making up might-have-been, of narrating to
herself how things would have fallen out had her fictions been
fact, her ascetic hero the impetuous lover she had made of him. In
other words, lying prostrate on the sand, Laura went on with her
story.</p>

<p>When, towards the end of the third week, she and Pin were
summoned to spend some days with Godmother, she had acquired such a
gusto for this occupation, that she preferred to shirk reality, and
let Pin pay the visit alone.</p>

<h2>XX.</h2>

<blockquote>Wie sollte ein Strom nicht endlich den Weg<br>
zum Meere finden!<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>Sea, sun and air did their healing work, as did also the long,
idle days in the home garden; and Laura drank in health and vigour
with every breath.</p>

<p>She had need of it all when, the golden holidays over, she
returned to school; for the half-year that broke was, in many ways,
the most trying she had yet had to face. True, her dupes' first
virulence had waned&mdash;they no longer lashed her openly with
their tongues&mdash;but the quiet, covert insults, that were now
the rule, were every bit as hard to bear; and before a week had
passed Laura was telling herself that, had she been a Christian
Martyr, she would have preferred to be torn asunder with one jerk,
rather than submit to the thumbkin. Not an eye but looked askance
at her; on every face was painted a reminder of her moral
inferiority; and even newcomers among the boarders soon learnt,
without always knowing what her crime had been, that Laura
Rambotham was "not the thing".</p>

<p>This system of slight and disparagement was similar to what she
had had to endure in her first school term; but its effect upon her
was different. Then, in her raw timidity, she had bowed her head
beneath it; now, she could not be so lamb-like. In thought, she
never ceased to lay half the blame of what had happened on her
companions' shoulders; and she was embittered by their injustice in
making her alone responsible, when all she had done was to yield to
their craving for romance. She became a rebel, wrapping herself
round in the cloak of bitterness which the outcasts of fortune
wear, feeding on her hate of those within the pale. Very well then,
she said to herself: if her fellows chose to shut her out like
this, she would stop outside, and never see eye to eye with them
again. And it gave her an unholy pleasure to mock, in secret, at
all they set store by.</p>

<p>Her outward behaviour for many a day was, none the less, that of
a footlicker; and by no sign did she indicate what she really
was&mdash;a very unhappy girl. Like most rebels of her sex, she
ardently desired to re-enter the fold of law and order; and it was
to this end she worked, although, wherever she approached it, the
place seemed to bristle with spears. But she did not let herself be
daunted; she pocketed injuries, pretended not to hear them, played
the spaniel to people she despised; and it soon became open talk,
that no matter what you said to her, Laura Rambotham would not take
offence. You could also rely on her to do a dirty job for you. A
horrid little toady was the verdict; especially of those who had no
objection to be toadied to.</p>

<p>Torn thus, between mutinous sentiments on the one hand, a
longing for restitution on the other, Laura grew very sly&mdash;a
regular little tactician. In these days, she was for ever
considering what she ought to do, what to leave undone. She learnt
to weigh her words before uttering them, instead of blurting out
her thoughts in the childish fashion that had exposed her to
ridicule; she learnt, too, at last, to keep her real opinions to
herself, and to make those she expressed tally with her hearers'.
And she was quick to discover that this was a short-cut towards
regaining her lost place: to conceal what she truly
felt&mdash;particularly if her feelings ran counter to those of the
majority. For, the longer she was at school, the more insistently
the truth was driven home to her, that the majority is always in
the right.</p>

<p>In the shifting of classes that took place at the year's end,
she left the three chief witnesses of her disgrace&mdash;Tilly,
Maria, Kate&mdash;behind her. She was again among a new set of
girls. But this little piece of luck was outweighed by the fact
that, shortly after Christmas, her room was changed for the one
occupied by M. P., and M. P.'s best friend.</p>

<p>So far, Laura had hardly dared to lift her eyes in Mary
Pidwall's presence. For Mary knew not only the sum of her lies, but
also held&mdash;or so Laura believed&mdash;that she came of a
thoroughly degenerate family; thanks to Uncle Tom. And the early
weeks spent at close quarters with her bore out these fears. The
looks both M. P. and her friend bent on Laura said as plainly as
words: if we are forced to tolerate this obnoxious little insect
about us, we can at least show it just what a horrid little beast
it is. M. P. in particular was adamant, unrelenting; Laura quailed
at the sound of her step.</p>

<p>And yet she soon felt, rightly enough, it was just in the
winning over of this stern, rigid nature that her hope of salvation
lay. If she could once get M. P. on her side, all might yet be well
again.</p>

<p>So she began to lay siege to Mary's good-will&mdash;to Mary, who
took none but the barest notice of her, even in the bedroom
ignoring her as if she did not exist, and giving the necessary
orders, for she was the eldest of the three, in tones of ice. But
it needed a great wariness on Laura's part. And, in the beginning,
she made a mistake. She was a toadeater here, too, seeking to curry
favour with M. P. as with the rest, by fawning on her, in a way for
which she could afterwards have hit herself. For it did not answer;
M. P. had only a double disdain for the cringer, knowing nothing
herself of the pitfalls that lie in wait for a temperament like
Laura's. Mary's friendship was extended to none but those who had a
lofty moral standard; and truthfulness and honesty were naturally
the head virtues on her list. Laura was sharp enough to see that,
if she wished to gain ground with M. P. she must make a radical
change in her tactics. It was not enough, where Mary was in
question, to play the echo. Did she, Laura, state an opinion, she
must say what she meant, above all, mean what she said, and stick
manfully to it, instead of, at the least hint, being ready to fly
over to Mary's point of view: always though, of course, with the
disquieting proviso in the background that her own opinions were
such as she ought to have, and not heretical leanings that shocked
and dismayed. In which case, there was nothing for it but to go on
being mum.</p>

<p>She ventured, moreover, little unobtrusive services, to which
she thought neither of the girls could take exception; making their
beds for them in the morning, and staying up last at night to put
out the light. And once she overheard the friend, who was called
Cupid, say: "You know, M. P., she's not such a bad little stick
after all."&mdash;But then Cupid was easy-going, and inclined to be
original.</p>

<p>May answered: "She's no doubt beginning to see she can't lie to
<i>us</i>. But she's a very double-faced child."</p>

<p>It was also with an eye to M. P.'s approval that Laura threw
herself, with renewed zeal, upon her work. And in those classes
that called only for the exercise of her memory, she soon sat high.
The reason why she could not mount still higher was that M. P.
occupied the top place, and was not to be moved, even had Laura
dreamed of attempting it.</p>

<p>And at length, after three months of unremitting exertion in the
course of which, because she had little peeps of what looked like
success, the rebel in her went to sleep again&mdash;at length Laura
had her reward. One Sunday morning M. P. asked her to be her
partner on the walk to church. This was as if a great poet should
bend from his throne to take a younger brother-singer by the hand;
and, in her headlong fashion, Laura all but fell at the elder
girl's feet. From this day forward she out-heroded Herod, in her
efforts to make of herself exactly what Mary thought she ought to
be.</p>

<p>Deep within her, none the less, there lurked a feeling which
sometimes made as if to raise its head: a feeling that she did not
really like M. P., or admire her, or respect her; one which, had it
come quite to life, would have kicked against Mary's authority,
been contemptuous of her unimaginative way of seeing and saying
things, on the alert to remind its owner that <i>her</i> way, too,
had a right to existence. But is was not strong enough to make
itself heard, or rather Laura refused to hear it, and turned a deaf
ear whenever it tried to hint at its presence. For Mr.
Worldly-Wiseman was her model just now.</p>

<p>Whereas Cupid&mdash;there was something in Cupid that was
congenial to her. A plain girl, with irregular features&mdash;how
she had come by her nickname no one knew&mdash;Cupid was three
years older than Laura, and one of the few in the school who loved
reading for its own sake. In a manner, she was cleverer even than
M. P.; but it was not a school-booky way, and hence was not thought
much of. However, Laura felt drawn to her at once&mdash;even though
Cupid treated her as quite a little girl&mdash;and they sometimes
got as far as talking of books they had read. From this whiff of
her, Laura was sure that Cupid would have had more understanding
than M. P. for her want of veracity; for Cupid had a kind of a
dare-devil mind in a hidebound character, and was often very bold
of speech.</p>

<p>Yet it was not Cupid's good opinion she worked for, with might
and main.</p>

<p>The rate of her upward progress in Mary's estimation could be
gauged by the fact that the day came when the elder girl spoke
openly to her of her crime. At the first merciless words Laura
winced hotly, both at and for the tactlessness of which Mary was
guilty. But, the first shameful stab over, she felt the better of
it; yes, it was a relief to speak to some one of what she had borne
alone for so long. To speak of it, and even to argue round it a
little; for, like most wrongdoers, Laura soon acquired a taste for
dwelling on her misdeed. And Mary, being entirely without humour,
and also unversed in dealing with criminals, did not divine that
this was just a form of self-indulgence. It was Cupid who said:
"Look here, Infant, you'll be getting cocky about what you did, if
you don't look out."</p>

<p>Mary would not allow that a single one of Laura's excuses held
water.</p>

<p>"That's the sheerest nonsense. You don't seem to realise that
you tried to defame another person's moral character," she said, in
the assured, superior way that so impressed Laura. And this aspect
of the case, which had never once occurred to her, left Laura
open-mouthed; and yet a little doubtful: Mr. Shepherd was surely
too far above her, and too safely ensconced in holiness, to be
injured by anything she might say. But the idea gave her food for
thought; and she even tentatively developed her story along these
unfamiliar lines, just to see how it might have turned out.</p>

<p>One night as they were undressing for bed, Mary spoke, with the
same fireless depreciation, of the behaviour of a classmate which
had been brought to her notice that day. This girl was said to have
nefariously "copied" from another, in the course of a written
examination; and, as prefect of her class Mary was bound to track
the evil down. "I shall make them both show me their papers as soon
as they get them back; and then, if I find proof of what's being
said, I must tackle her. Just as I tackled you, Laura."</p>

<p>Laura flushed. "Oh, M. P., I've never 'copied' in my life!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"Probably not. But those things all belong in the same box:
lying, and 'copying', and stealing."</p>

<p>"You never <i>will</i> believe me when I say I didn't know
anything about that horrid Chinky. I only told a few
crams&mdash;that was quite different."</p>

<p>"I think it's most unfortunate, Laura, that you persist in
clinging to that idea."</p>

<p>Here M. P. was obliged to pause; for she had put a lock of hair
between her teeth while she did something to a plait at the back.
As soon as she could speak again, she went on: "You and your few
crams! Have you ever thought, pray, what a state of things it would
be, if we all went about telling false-hoods, and saying it didn't
matter, they were merely a few little fibs?&mdash;What are you
laughing at?"</p>

<p>"I'm not laughing. I mean...I just smiled. I was only thinking
how funny it would be&mdash;Sandy, and old Gurley, and Jim Chapman,
all going round making up things that had never happened."</p>

<p>"You've a queer notion of what's funny. Have you utterly no
respect for the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I have. But I say"&mdash;Laura, who always
slipped quickly out of her clothes, was sitting in her nightgown on
the edge of the bed, hugging her knees. "I say, M. P., if everybody
told stories, and everybody knew everybody else was telling them,
then truth wouldn't be any good any more at all, would it? If
nobody used it?"</p>

<p>"What rubbish you do talk!" said Mary serenely, as she shook her
toothbrush on to a towel and rubbed it dry.</p>

<p>"As if truth were a soap!" remarked Cupid who was already in
bed, reading <i>Nana</i>, and trying to smoke a cigarette under the
blankets.</p>

<p>"You can't do away with truth, child."</p>

<p>"But why not? Who says so? It isn't a law."</p>

<p>"Don't try to be so sharp, Laura."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to, M. P. But what <i>is</i> truth, anyhow?" asked
Laura.</p>

<p>"The Bible is truth. Can you do away with the Bible, pray?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. But M. P....The Bible isn't quite all truth, you
know. My father&mdash;" here she broke off in some confusion,
remembering Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, what about him? You don't want to say, I hope, that he
didn't believe in the Bible?"</p>

<p>Laura drove back the "Of course not!" that was all but over her
lips. "Well, not exactly," she said, and grew very red. "But you
<i>know</i>, M. P., whales don't have big enough throats ever to
have swallowed Jonah."</p>

<p>"Little girls shouldn't talk about what they don't understand.
The Bible is God's Word; and God is Truth."</p>

<p>"You're a silly infant," threw in Cupid, coughing as she spoke.
"Truth has got to be&mdash;and honesty, too. If it didn't exist,
there couldn't be any state, or laws, or any social life. It's one
of the things that makes men different from animals, and the people
who boss us know pretty well what they're about, you bet when they
punish the ruffians who don't practise it."</p>

<p>"Yes, now <i>that</i> I see," agreed Laura eagerly. "Then
truth's a useful thing. Oh, and that's probably what it means, too,
when you say: Honesty is the best Policy."</p>

<p>"I never heard such a child," said M. P., shocked. "Cupid, you
really shouldn't put such things into her head. You're down-right
immoral, Laura."</p>

<p>"Oh, how <i>can</i> you say such a horrid thing?"</p>

<p>"Well, your ideas are simply dreadful. You ought to try your
hardest to improve them."</p>

<p>"I do, M. P., really I do."</p>

<p>"You don't succeed. I think there must be a screw loose in you
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I vote we adjourn this meeting," said Cupid, recovering
from a fresh cough and splutter. "Or old Gurley'll be coming in to
put me on a mustard plaster. As for you, Infant, if you take the
advice of a chap who has seen life, you'll keep your ideas to
yourself: they're too crude for this elegant world."</p>

<p>"Right you are!" said Laura cheerfully.</p>

<p>She was waiting by the gas-jet till M.P. had folded her last
garment, and she shuffled her bare feet one over the other as she
stood; for it was a cold night. The light out, she hopped into bed
in the dark.</p>

<h2>XXI.</h2>

<p>But the true seal was set on her regeneration when she was
invited to join the boarders' Literary Society; of which Cupid and
Mary were the leading spirits. This carried her back, at one
stroke, into the swing of school life. For everybody who was
anybody belonged to the society. And, despite her friendship with
the head of her class, Laura still knew what it was to get the cold
shoulder.</p>

<p>But this was to some extent her own fault. At the present stage
of her career she was an extraordinarily prickly child, and even to
her two sponsors did not at times present a very amiable outside:
like a hedgehog, she was ever ready to shoot out her spines. With
regard, that is, to her veracity. She had been so badly grazed, in
her recent encounter, that she was now constantly seeing doubt
where no doubt was; and this wakeful attitude of suspicion towards
others did not make for brotherly love. The amenity of her manners
suffered, too: though she kept to her original programme of not
saying all she thought, yet what she was forced to say she blurted
out in such a precise and blunt fashion that it made a disagreeable
impression. At the same time, a growing pedantry in trifles warped
both her imagination and her sympathies: under the aegis of M. P.,
she rapidly learned to be the latter's rival in an adherence to
bald fact, and in her contumely for those who departed from it.
Indeed, before the year spent in Mary's company was out, Laura was
well on the way towards becoming one of those uncomfortable people
who, concerned only for their own salvation, fire the truth at you
on every occasion, without regard for your tender places. So she
remained but scantly popular.</p>

<p>Hence, her admission to the Literary Society augured well.</p>

<p>Her chief qualifications for membership were that she could make
verses, and was also very fond of reading. At school, however, this
taste had been quiescent; for books were few. Still, she had read
whatever she could lay hands on, and for the past half-year or more
she had fared like a little pig in a clover field. Since Christmas,
she was one of the few permitted to do morning practice on the
grand piano in Mrs. Strachey's drawing-room&mdash;an honour, it is
true, not overmuch valued by its recipients, for Mrs. Gurley's
bedroom lay just above, and that lady could swoop down on whoever
was weak enough to take a little rest. But Laura snapped her
fingers at such a flimsy objection; for this was the wonderful room
round the walls of which low, open bookshelves ran; and she was
soon bold enough, on entering, hastily to select a book to read
while she played, always on the alert to pop it behind her music,
should anyone come into the room.</p>

<p>For months, she browsed unchecked. As her choice had to be made
with extreme celerity, and from those shelves nearest the piano, it
was in the nature of things that it was not invariably a happy one.
For some time she had but moderate luck, and sampled queer foods.
To these must be reckoned a translation of <i>Faust</i>, which she
read through, to the end of the First Part at least, with a kind of
dreary wonder why such a dull thing should be called great. For her
next repast, she sought hard and it was in the course of this
rummage that she had the strangest find of all. Running a skilled
eye over the length of a shelf close at hand, she hit on a slim,
blue volume, the title of which at once arrested her attention.
For, notwithstanding her fourteen years, and her dabblings in
Richardson and Scott, Laura's liking for a real child's book was as
strong as it had ever been; and <i>A Doll's House</i> seemed to
promise good things. Deftly extracting the volume, she struck up
her scales and began to read.</p>

<p>This was the day on which, after breakfast, Mrs. Gurley
pulverised her with the remark: "A new, and, I must say, extremely
interesting, fashion of playing scales, Laura Rambotham! To hold,
the forte pedal down, from beginning to end!"</p>

<p>Laura was unconscious of having sinned in this way. But it might
quite well be so. For she had spent a topsy-turvy, though highly
engrossing hour. In place of the children's story she anticipated,
she had found herself, on opening the book, confronted by the
queerest stuff she had ever seen in print. From the opening
sentence on. To begin with, it was a play&mdash;and Laura had never
had a modern prose play in her hand before&mdash;and then it was
all about the oddest, yet the most commonplace people. It seemed to
her amazingly unreal&mdash;how these people spoke and
behaved&mdash;she had never known anyone like them; and yet again
so true, in the way it dragged in everyday happenings, so petty in
its rendering of petty things, that it bewildered and repelled her:
why, some one might just as well write a book about Mother or
Sarah! Her young, romantic soul rose in arms against this, its
first bluff contact with realism, against such a dispiriting
sobriety of outlook. Something within her wanted to cry out in
protest as she read&mdash;for read she did, on three successive
days, with an interest she could not explain. And that was not all.
It was worse that the people in this book&mdash;the extraordinary
person who was married, and had children, and yet ate biscuits out
of a bag and said she didn't; the man who called her his lark and
his squirrel&mdash;as if any man ever did call his wife such
names!&mdash;all these people seemed eternally to be meaning
something different from what they said; something that was for
ever eluding her. It was most irritating. There was, moreover, no
mention of a doll's house in the whole three acts.</p>

<p>The state of confusion this booklet left her in, she allayed
with a little old brown leather volume of Longfellow. And
<i>Hyperion</i> was so much more to her liking that she even
ventured to borrow it from its place on the shelf, in order to read
it at her leisure, braving the chance that her loan, were it
discovered, might be counted against her as a theft.</p>

<p>It hung together, no doubt, with the after-effects of her dip
into Ibsen that, on her sitting down to write the work that was to
form her passport to the Society, her mind should incline to the
most romantic of romantic themes. Not altogether, though: Laura's
taste, such as it was, for literature had, like all young people's,
a mighty bias towards those books which turned their backs on
reality: she sought not truth, but the miracle. However, though she
had thus taken sides, there was still a yawning gap to be bridged
between her ready acceptance of the honourable invitation, and the
composition of a masterpiece. Thanks to her wonted inability to
project her thoughts beyond the moment, she had been so unthinking
of possible failure that Cupid had found it necessary to interject:
"Here, I say, don't blow!" Whereas, when she came to write, she sat
with her pen poised over the paper for nearly half an hour, without
bringing forth a word. First, there was the question of form: she
considered, then abruptly dismissed, the idea of writing verses:
the rhymes with love and dove, and heart and part, which could have
been managed, were, she felt, too silly and sentimental to be laid
before her quizzical audience. Next, what to write about&mdash;a
simple theme, such as a fairy-tale, was not for a moment to be
contemplated. No, Laura had always flown her hawk high, and she was
now bent on making a splutter. It ended by being a toss-up between
a play in the Shakesperian manner and a novel after Scott. She
decided on the novel. It should be a romance of Venice, with
abundant murder and mystery in it, and a black, black villain, such
as her soul loved&mdash;no macaroon-nibblers or rompers with
children for her! And having thus attuned her mind to scarlet
deeds, she set to work. But she found it tremendously difficult to
pin her story to paper: she saw things clearly enough, and could
have related them by word of mouth; but did she try to write them
down they ran to mist; and though she toiled quite literally in the
sweat of her brow, yet when the eventful day came she had but three
niggardly pages to show for her pains.</p>

<p>About twenty girls formed the Society, which assembled one
Saturday evening in an empty music-room. All were not, of course,
equally productive: some had brought it no further than a riddle:
and it was just these drones who, knowing nothing of the pother
composition implied, criticised most stringently the efforts of the
rest. Several members had pretty enough talents, Laura's two
room-mates among the number: on the night Laura made her debut, the
weightiest achievement was, without doubt, M. P.'s essay on
"Magnanimity"; and Laura's eyes grew moist as she listened to its
stirring phrases. Next best&mdash;to her thinking, at
least&mdash;was a humorous episode by Cupid, who had a gift that
threw Laura into a fit of amaze; and this was the ability to expand
infinitely little into infinitely much; to rig out a trifle in many
words, so that in the end it seemed ever so much bigger than it
really was&mdash;just as a thrifty merchant boils his oranges, to
swell them to twice their size.</p>

<p>Laura being the youngest member, her affair came last on the
programme: she had to sit and listen to the others, her cheeks hot,
her hands very cold. Presently all were done, and then Cupid, who
was chairman, called on "a new author, Rambotham, who it is hoped
will prove a valuable acquisition to the Society, to read us his
maiden effort".</p>

<p>Laura rose to her feet and, trembling with nervousness,
stuttered forth her prose. The three little pages shot past like a
flash; she had barely stood up before she was obliged to sit down
again, leaving her hearers, who had only just re-adopted their
listening attitudes, agape with astonishment. She could have
endured, with phlegm, the ridicule this malheur earned her: what
was harder to stomach was that her paper heroics made utterly no
impression. She suffered all the humiliation of a flabby fiasco,
and, till bedtime, shrank out of her friends' way.</p>

<p>"You were warned not to be too cocky, you know," Mary said
judicially, on seeing her downcast air.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be, really. Then you don't think what I wrote
was up to much, M. P.?"</p>

<p>"Mm," said the elder girl, in a non-committal way.</p>

<p>Here Cupid chimed in. "Look here, Infant, I want to ask you
something. Have you ever been in Venice?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ever seen a gondola?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or the Doge's palace?&mdash;or a black-cloaked
assassin?&mdash;or a masked lady?"</p>

<p>"You know I haven't," murmured Laura, humbled to the dust.</p>

<p>"And probably never will. Well then, why on earth try to write
wooden, second-hand rubbish like that?"</p>

<p>"Second-hand?...But Cupid...think of Scott! He couldn't have
seen half he told about?"</p>

<p>"My gracious!" ejaculated Cupid, and sat down and fanned herself
with a hairbrush. "You don't imagine you're a Scott, do you? Here,
hold me, M. P., I'm going to faint!"&mdash;and at Laura's quick and
scarlet denial, she added: "Well, why the unmentionable not use the
eyes the Lord has given you, and write about what's before them
every day of your life?"</p>

<p>"Do you think that would be better?"</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;I know it would."</p>

<p>But Laura was not so easily convinced as all that.</p>

<p>Ever a talented imitator, she next tried her hand at an essay on
an abstract subject. This was a failure: you could not <i>see</i>
things, when you wrote about, say, "Beneficence"; and Laura's
thinking was done mainly in pictures. Matters were still worse when
she tinkered at Cupid's especial genre: her worthless little
incident stared at her, naked and scraggy, from the sheet; she had
no wealth of words at her disposal in which to deck it out. So,
with a sigh, she turned back to the advice Cupid had given her, and
prepared to make a faithful transcript of actuality. She called
what she now wrote: "A Day at School", and conscientiously set down
detail on detail; so fearful, this time, of over-brevity, that she
spun the account out to twenty pages; though the writing of it was
as distasteful to her as her reading of <i>A Doll's House</i> had
been.</p>

<p>At the subsequent meeting of the Society, expression of opinion
was not lacking.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jehoshaphat! How much more?"</p>

<p>"Here, let me get out. I've had enough."</p>

<p>"I say, you forgot to count how many steps it took you to come
downstairs."</p>

<p>Till the chairman had pity on the embarrassed author and said:
"Look here, Laura, I think you'd better keep the rest for another
time."</p>

<p>"It was just what you told me to do," Laura reproached Cupid
that night: she was on the brink of tears.</p>

<p>But Cupid was disinclined to shoulder the responsibility. "Told
you to be as dull and long-winded as that? Infant, it's a
whacker!"</p>

<p>"But it was <i>true</i> what I wrote&mdash;every word of
it."</p>

<p>Neither of the two elder girls was prepared to discuss this
vital point. Cupid shifted ground. "Good Lord, Laura, but it's hard
to drive a thing into <i>your</i> brain-pan. You don't need to be
<i>all</i> true on paper, silly child!"</p>

<p>"Last time you said I had to."</p>

<p>"Well, if you want it, my candid opinion is that you haven't any
talent for this kind of thing. Now turn off the gas."</p>

<p>As the light in the room went out, a kind of inner light seemed
to go up in Laura; and both then and on the following days she
thought hard. She was very ambitious, anxious to shine, not ready
to accept defeat; and to the next literary contest she brought the
description of an excursion to the hills and gullies that
surrounded Warrenega; into which she had worked an adventure with
some vagrant blacks. She and Pin and the boys had often picnicked
on these hills, with their lunches packed in billies; and she had
seen the caves and rocky holes where blackfellows were said to have
hidden themselves in early times; but neither this particular
excursion, nor the exciting incident which she described with all
the aplomb of an eyewitness, had ever taken place. That is to say:
not a word of her narration was true, but every word of it might
have been true.</p>

<p>And with this she had an unqualified success.</p>

<p>"I believe there's something in you after all," said Cupid to
her that night. "Anyhow, you know now what it is to be true, yet
not dull and prosy."</p>

<p>And Laura manfully choked back her desire to cry out that not a
word of her story was fact.</p>

<p>She was long in falling asleep. Naturally, she was elated and
excited by her success; but also a new and odd piece of knowledge
had niched itself in her brain. It was this. In your speech, your
talk with others, you must be exact to the point of pedantry, and
never romance or draw the long-bow; or you would be branded as an
abominable liar. Whereas, as soon as you put pen to paper, provided
you kept one foot planted on probability, you might lie as hard as
you liked: indeed, the more vigorously you lied, the louder would
be your hearers' applause.</p>

<p>And Laura fell asleep over a chuckle.</p>

<h2>XXII.</h2>

<blockquote>Und vergesst mir auch das gute Lachen nicht!<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>And then, alas! just as she rode high on this wave of
approbation, Laura suffered another of those drops in the esteem of
her fellows, another of those mental upsets, which from time to
time had thrown her young life out of gear.</p>

<p>True, what now came was not exactly her own fault; though it is
doubtful whether a single one of her companions would have made her
free of an excuse. They looked on, round-eyed, mouths a-stretch.
Once more, the lambkin called Laura saw fit to sunder itself from
the flock, and to cut mad capers in sight of them all. And their
delectation was as frank as their former wrath had been. As for
Laura, as usual she did not stop to think till it was too late; but
danced lightly away to her own undoing.</p>

<p>The affair began pleasantly enough. A member of the Literary
Society was the girl with the twinkly brown eyes&mdash;she who had
gone out of her way to give Laura a kindly word after the Shepherd
debacle. This girl, Evelyn Souttar by name, was also the only one
of the audience who had not joined in the laugh provoked by Laura's
first appearance as an author. Laura had never forgotten this; and
she would smile shyly at Evelyn when their looks met. But a dozen
reasons existed why there should have been no further rapport
between them. Although now in the fifth form, Laura had remained
childish for her age: whereas Evelyn was over eighteen, and only
needed to turn up her hair to be quite grown-up. She had
matriculated the previous Christmas, and was at present putting
away a rather desultory half-year, before leaving school for good.
In addition, she was rich, pampered and very pretty&mdash;the last
comrade in the world for drab little Laura.</p>

<p>One evening, as the latter was passing through the dining-hall,
she found Evelyn, who studied where she chose, disconsolately
running her fingers through her gold-brown hair.</p>

<p>"I say, Kiddy," she called to Laura. "You know Latin, don't you?
Just give us a hand with this."&mdash;Latin had not been one of
Evelyn's subjects, and she was now employing some of her spare time
in studying the language with Mr. Strachey, who taught it after a
fashion of his own. "How on earth would you say: 'We had not
however rid here so long, but should have tided it up the river'?
What's the old fool mean by that?" and she pushed an open volume of
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> towards Laura.</p>

<p>Laura helped to the best of her ability.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," said Evelyn. "You're a clever chickabiddy. But
you must let me help you with something in return. What's
hardest?"</p>

<p>"Filling baths and papering rooms," replied Laura candidly.</p>

<p>"Arithmetic, eh? Well, if ever you want a sum done, come to
me."</p>

<p>But Laura was temperamentally unable to accept so vague an
invitation; and here the matter closed.</p>

<p>When, consequently, Miss Chapman summoned her one evening to
tell her that she was to change her present bedroom for Evelyn's,
the news came as a great shock to her.</p>

<p>"Change my room?" she echoed, in slow disgust. "Oh, I can't,
Miss Chapman!"</p>

<p>"You've got to, Laura, if Mrs. Gurley says so," expostulated the
kindly governess.</p>

<p>"But I won't! There <i>must</i> be some mistake. Just when I'm
so comfortably settled, too. Very well, then, Miss Chapman, I'll
speak to Mrs. Gurley myself."</p>

<p>She carried out this threat, and, for daring to question orders,
received the soundest snubbing she had had for many a long day.</p>

<p>That night she was very bitter about it all, and the more so
because Mary and Cupid did not, to her thinking, show sufficient
sympathy.</p>

<p>"I believe you're both glad I'm going. It's a beastly shame. Why
must I always be odd man out?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Infant, don't adopt that tone, please," said Cupid
magisterially. "Or you'll make us glad in earnest. People who are
always up in arms about things are the greatest bores in the
world."</p>

<p>So the following afternoon Laura wryly took up armfuls of her
belongings, mounted a storey higher, and deposited them on the
second bed in Evelyn's room.</p>

<p>The elder girl had had this room to herself for over a year now,
and Laura felt sure would be chafing inwardly at her intrusion. For
days she stole mousily in and out, avoiding the hours when Evelyn
was there, getting up earlier in the morning, hurrying into bed at
night and feeling very sore indeed at the sufferance on which she
supposed herself to be.</p>

<p>But once Evelyn caught her and said: "Don't, for gracious' sake,
knock each time you want to come in, child. This is your room now
as well as mine."</p>

<p>Laura reddened, and blurted out something about knowing how she
must hate to have <i>her</i> stuck in there.</p>

<p>Evelyn wrinkled up her forehead and laughed. "What rot! Do you
think I'd have asked to have you, if I hated it so much?"</p>

<p>"You asked to have me?" gasped Laura.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;didn't you know? Old Gurley said I'd need to
have some one; so I chose you."</p>

<p>Laura was too dumbfounded, and too diffident, to ask the grounds
of such a choice. But the knowledge that it was so, worked an
instant change in her.</p>

<p>In all the three years she had been at school, she had not got
beyond a surface friendliness with any of her fellows. Even those
who had been her "chums" had wandered like shades through the
groves of her affection: rough, teasing Bertha; pretty, lazy Inez;
perky Tilly, slangily frank Maria and Kate, Mary and her moral
influence, clever, instructive Cupid: to none of them had she been
drawn by any deeper sense of affinity. And though she had come to
believe, in the course of the last, more peaceful year, that she
had grown used to being what you would call an unpopular
girl&mdash;one, that is, with whom no one ever shared a
confidence&mdash;yet seldom was there a child who longed more
ardently to be liked, or suffered more acutely under dislike. Apart
however from the brusque manner she had contracted, in her search
after truth, it must be admitted that Laura had but a small talent
for friendship; she did not grasp the constant give-and-take
intimacy implies; the liking of others had to be brought to her,
unsought, she, on the other hand, being free to stand back and
consider whether or no the feeling was worth returning. And friends
are not made in this fashion.</p>

<p>But Evelyn had stoutly, and without waiting for permission,
crossed the barrier; and each new incident in her approach was
pleasanter than the last. Laura was pleased, and flattered, and
round the place where her heart was, she felt a warm and
comfortable glow.</p>

<p>She began to return the liking, with interest, after the manner
of a lonely, bottled-up child. And everything about Evelyn made it
easy to grow fond of her. To begin with, Laura loved pretty things
and pretty people; and her new friend was out and away the
prettiest girl in the school. Then, too, she was clever, and that
counted; you did not make a friend of a fool. But her chief
characteristics were a certain sound common sense, and an
inexhaustible fund of good-nature&mdash;a careless, happy, laughing
sunniness, that was as grateful to those who came into touch with
it as a rare ointment is grateful to the skin. This kindliness
arose, it might be, in the first place from indolence: it was less
trouble to be merry and amiable than to put oneself out to be
selfish, which also meant standing a fire of disagreeable words and
looks; and then, too, it was really hard for one who had never had
a whim crossed to be out of humour. But, whatever its origin, the
good-nature was there, everlastingly; and Laura soon learnt that
she could cuddle in under it, and be screened by it, as a lamb is
screened by its mother's woolly coat.</p>

<p>Evelyn was the only person who did not either hector her, or
feel it a duty to clip and prune at her: she accepted Laura for
what she was&mdash;for herself. Indeed, she even seemed to lay
weight on Laura's bits of opinions, which the girl had grown so
chary of offering; and, under the sunshine of this treatment, Laura
shot up and flowered like a spring bulb. She began to speak out her
thoughts again; she unbosomed herself of dark little secrets; and
finally did what she would never have believed possible: sitting
one night in her nightgown, on the edge of Evelyn's bed, she made a
full confession of the pickle she had got herself into, over her
visit to the Shepherds.</p>

<p>To her astonishment, Evelyn, who was already in bed, laughed
till the tears ran down her cheeks. At Laura's solemn-faced
incredulity she said:</p>

<p>"I say, Kiddy, but that <i>was</i> rich. To think a chicken of
your size sold them like that. It's the best joke I've heard for an
age. Tell us again&mdash;from the beginning."</p>

<p>Nothing loath Laura started in afresh, and in this, the second
telling, embroidered the edge of her tale with a few fancy
stitches, in a way she had not ventured on for months past; so that
Evelyn was more tickled than before.</p>

<p>"No wonder they were mad about being had like that. You little
rascal!"</p>

<p>She was equally amused by Laura's description of the miserable
week she had spent, trying to make up her mind to confess.</p>

<p>"You ridiculous sprat! Why didn't you come to me? We'd have let
them down with a good old bump."</p>

<p>But Laura could not so easily forget the humiliations she had
been forced to suffer, and delicately hinted to her friend at M.
P.'s moral strictures. With her refreshing laugh, Evelyn brushed
these aside as well.</p>

<p>"Tommyrot! Never mind that old jumble-sale of all the virtues.
It was jolly clever of a mite like you to bamboozle them as you
did&mdash;take my word for that."</p>

<p>This jocose way of treating the matter seemed to put it in an
entirely new light; Laura could even smile at it herself. In the
days that followed, she learned, indeed, to laugh over it with
Evelyn, and to share the latter's view that she had been superior
in wit to those she had befooled. This meant a great and healthy
gain in self-assurance for Laura. It also led to her laying more
and more weight on what her friend said. For it was not as if
Evelyn had a low moral standard; far from that: she was honest and
straightforward, too proud, or, it might be, too lazy to tell a lie
herself&mdash;with all the complications lying involved&mdash;and
Laura never heard her say a harder thing of anyone than what she
had just said about Mary Pidwall.</p>

<p>The two talked late into every night after this, Laura perched,
monkey-fashion, on the side of her friend's bed. Evelyn had all the
accumulated wisdom of eighteen, and was able to clear her young
companion up on many points about which Laura had so far been in
the dark. But when, in time, she came to relate the mortifications
she had suffered&mdash;and was still called on to suffer&mdash;at
the hands of the other sex, Evelyn pooh-poohed the subject.</p>

<p>"Time enough in a couple of years for that. Don't bother your
head about it in the meantime."</p>

<p>"I don't now&mdash;not a bit. I only wanted to know why.
Sometimes, Evvy, do you know, they liked to talk to quite little
kids of seven and eight better than me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you talked too much yourself&mdash;and about
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I did. And if you don't talk something, they yawn
and go away."</p>

<p>"You've got to let them do the lion's share, child. Just you sit
still, and listen, and pretend you like it&mdash;even though you're
bored to extinction."</p>

<p>"And they never need to pretend anything, I suppose? No, I think
they're horrid. You don't like them either, Evvy, do you?...any
more than I do?"</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed.</p>

<p>"Say what you think they are," persisted Laura and waggled the
other's arm, to make her speak.</p>

<p>"Mostly fools," said Evelyn, and laughed again&mdash;laughed in
all the conscious power of lovely eighteen.</p>

<p>Overjoyed at this oneness of mind, Laura threw her arms round
her friend's neck and kissed her. "You dear!" she said.</p>

<p>And yet, a short time afterwards, it was on this very head that
she had to bear the shock of a rude awakening.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Evelyn's people came to Melbourne that year from the Riverina.
Evelyn was allowed considerable freedom, and one night, by special
permit, Laura also accepted an invitation to dinner and the
theatre. The two girls drove to a hotel, where they found Evelyn's
mother, elegant but a little stern, and a young lady-friend. Only
the four of them were present at dinner, and the meal passed off
smoothly; though the strangeness of dining in a big hotel had the
effect of tying Laura's tongue. Another thing that abashed her was
the dress of the young lady, who sat opposite. This
person&mdash;she must have been about the ripe age of
twenty-five&mdash;was nipped into a tight little pink satin bodice,
which, at the back, exposed the whole of two very bony
shoulder-blades. But it was the front of the dress that Laura
faced; and, having imbibed strict views of propriety from Mother,
she wriggled on her chair whenever she raised her eyes.</p>

<p>They drove to the theatre&mdash;though it was only a few doors
off. The seats were in the dress circle. The ladies sat in the
front row, the girls, who were in high frocks, behind.</p>

<p>Evelyn made a face of laughing discontent. "It's so ridiculous
the mater won't let me dress."</p>

<p>These words gave Laura a kind of stab. "Oh Evvy, I think you're
<i>ever</i> so much nicer as you are," she whispered, and squeezed
her friend's hand.</p>

<p>Evelyn could not answer, for the lady in pink had leant back and
tapped her with her fan. "It doesn't look as if Jim were coming, my
dear."</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed, in a peculiar way. "Oh, I guess he'll turn up
all right."</p>

<p>There had been some question of a person of this name at dinner;
but Laura had paid no great heed to what was said. Now, she sat up
sharply, for Evelyn exclaimed: "There he is!"</p>

<p>It was a man, a real man&mdash;not a boy&mdash;with a drooping,
fair moustache, a single eyeglass in one eye, and a camellia-bud in
his buttonhole. For the space of a breathless second Laura
connected him with the pink satin; then he dropped into a vacant
seat at Evelyn's side.</p>

<p>From this moment on, Laura's pleasure in her expensive seat, in
the pretty blue theatre and its movable roof, in the gay trickeries
of the <i>Mikado</i>, slowly fizzled out. Evelyn had no more
thought for her. Now and then, it is true, she would turn in her
affectionate way and ask Laura if she were all right just as one
satisfies oneself that a little child is happy&mdash;but her real
attention was for the man at her side. In the intervals, the two
kept up a perpetual buzz of chat, broken only by Evelyn's low
laughs. Laura sat neglected, sat stiff and cold with
disappointment, a great bitterness welling up within her. Before
the performance had dragged to an end, she would have liked to put
her head down and cry.</p>

<p>"Tired?" queried Evelyn noticing her pinched look, as they drove
home in the wagonette. But the mother was there, too, so Laura said
no.</p>

<p>Directly, however, the bedroom door shut behind them, she fell
into a tantrum, a fit of sullen rage, which she accentuated till
Evelyn could not but notice it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? Didn't you enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, I hated it," returned Laura passionately.</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed a little at this, but with an air of humorous
dismay. "I must take care, then, not to ask you out again."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go. Not for anything!"</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's the matter."</p>

<p>"Well, if that's all, make haste and get into bed. You're
overtired."</p>

<p>"Go to bed yourself!"</p>

<p>"I am, as fast as I can. I can hardly keep my eyes open;" and
Evelyn yawned heartily.</p>

<p>When Laura saw that she meant it, she burst out: "You're nothing
but a story-teller&mdash;that's what you are! You said you didn't
like them...that they were mostly fools...and then...then, to go on
as you did to-night." Her voice was shaky with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it? Come now, get to bed. We'll talk about it
in the morning."</p>

<p>"I never want to speak to you again."</p>

<p>"You're a silly child. But I'm really too sleepy to quarrel with
you to-night."</p>

<p>"I hate you&mdash;hate you!"</p>

<p>"I shall survive it."</p>

<p>She turned out the light as she spoke, settled herself on her
pillow, and composedly went to sleep.</p>

<p>Laura's rage redoubled. Throwing herself on the floor she burst
into angry tears, and cried as loudly as she dared, in the hope of
keeping her companion awake. But Evelyn was a magnificent sleeper;
and remained undisturbed. So after a time Laura rose, drew up the
blind, opened the window and sat down on the sill.</p>

<p>It was a bitterly cold night, of milky-white moonlight; each
bush and shrub carved its jet-black shadow on paths and grass.
Across Evelyn's bed fell a great patch of light: this, or the chill
air would, it was to be trusted, wake her. Meanwhile Laura sat in
her thin nightgown and shivered, feeling the cold intensely after
the great heat of the day. She hoped with all her heart that she
would be lucky enough to get an inflammation of the lungs. Then,
Evelyn would be sorry she had been so cruel to her.</p>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock, and she had several times found
herself nodding, when the sleeper suddenly opened her eyes and sat
bolt upright in bed.</p>

<p>"Laura, good heavens, what are you doing at the window? Oh, you
wicked child, you'll catch your death of cold! Get into bed at
once."</p>

<p>And, the culprit still maintaining an immovable silence, Evelyn
dragged her to bed by main force, and tucked her in as tightly as a
mummy.</p>

<h2>XXIII.</h2>

<blockquote>Gut und b&uuml;se und Lust und Leid und Ich und Du.<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>"Laura, you're a cipher!"</p>

<p>"I'm nothing of the sort!" threw back Laura indignantly. "You're
one yourself. What does she mean, Evvy?" she asked getting out of
earshot of the speaker.</p>

<p>"Goodness knows. Don't mind her, Poppet."</p>

<p>It was an oppressive evening: all day long a hot north wind had
scoured the streets, veiling things and people in clouds of gritty
dust; the sky was still like the prolonged reflection of a great
fire. The hoped-for change had not come, and the girls who strolled
the paths of the garden were white and listless. They walked in
couples, with interlaced arms; and members of the Matriculation
Class carried books with them, the present year being one of much
struggling and heartburning, and few leisured moments. Mary Pidwall
and Cupid were together under an acacia tree at the gate of the
tennis-court; and it was M. P. who had cast the above gibe at
Laura. At least Laura took it as a gibe, and scowled darkly; for
she could never grow hardened to ridicule.</p>

<p>As she and Evelyn re-passed this spot in their perambulation, a
merry little lump of a girl called Lolo, who darted her head from
side to side when she spoke, with the movements of a watchful
bird&mdash;this Lolo called: "Evelyn, come here, I want to tell you
something."</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?" asked Evelyn, but without obeying the
summons; for she felt Laura's grip of her arm tighten.</p>

<p>"It's a secret. You must come over here."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Poppet," said Evelyn persuasively, and
crossed the lawn with her characteristically lazy saunter. Minutes
went by; she did not return.</p>

<p>"Look at her Laura-ship!" said a saucebox to her partner. The
latter made "Hee-haw, hee-haw!" and both laughed derisively.</p>

<p>The object of their scorn stood at the farther end of the
wire-net fence: all five fingers of her right hand were thrust
through the holes of the netting, and held oddly and unconsciously
outspread; she stood on one leg, and with her other foot rubbed up
and down behind her ankle; mouth and brow were sullen, her black
eyes bent wrathfully on her faithless friend.</p>

<p>"A regular moon-calf!" said Cupid, looking up from <i>The
Tempest</i>, which was balanced breast-high on the narrow wooden
top of the fence.</p>

<p>"Mark my words, that child'll be plucked in her 'tests',"
observed M. P.</p>

<p>"Serve her right, say I, for playing the billy-ass," returned
Cupid, and killed a giant mosquito with such a whack that her wrist
was stained with its blood. "Ugh, you brute!...gorging yourself on
me. But I'm dashed if I know how Evelyn can be bothered to have her
always dangling round."</p>

<p>"She's a cipher," repeated Mary, in so judicial a tone that it
closed the conversation.</p>

<p>Laura, not altogether blind to externals, saw that her
companions made fun of her. But at the present pass, the strength
of her feelings quite out-ran her capacity for self-control; she
was unable to disguise what she felt, and though it made her the
laughing-stock of the school. What scheme was the birdlike Lolo
hatching against her? Why did Evelyn not come back?&mdash;these
were the thoughts that buzzed round inside her head, as the
mosquitoes buzzed outside. And meanwhile the familiar, foolish
noises of the garden at evening knocked at her ear. On the other
side of the hedge a batch of third-form girls were whispering, with
choked laughter, a doggerel rhyme which was hard to say, and which
meant something quite different did the tongue trip over a certain
letter. Of two girls who were playing tennis in half-hearted
fashion, the one next Laura said 'Oh, damn!' every time she missed
a ball. And over the parched, dusty grass the hot wind blew,
carrying with it, from the kitchens, a smell of cabbage, of fried
onions, of greasy dish-water.</p>

<p>Then Evelyn returned, and a part, a part only of the cloud
lifted from Laura's brow.</p>

<p>"What did she want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much."</p>

<p>"Then you're not going to tell me?"</p>

<p>I can't.</p>

<p>"What business has she to have secrets with you?" said Laura
furiously. And for a full round of the garden she did not open her
lips.</p>

<p>Her companions were not alone in eyeing this lopsided friendship
with an amused curiosity. The governesses also smiled at it, and
were surprised at Evelyn's endurance of the tyranny into which
Laura's liking had degenerated. On this particular evening, two who
were sitting on the verandah-bench came back to the subject.</p>

<p>"Just look at that Laura Rambotham again, will you?" said Miss
Snodgrass in her tart way. "Sulking for all she's worth. What a
little fool she is!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I wonder Mrs. Gurley hasn't noticed how badly she's
working just now," said Miss Chapman; and her face wore it
best-meaning, but most uncertain smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know very well if Mrs. Gurley doesn't want to see a
thing she doesn't," retorted Miss Snodgrass. "A regular talent for
going blind, I call it&mdash;especially where Evelyn Souttar's
concerned."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think you should talk like that," urged Miss
Chapman nervously.</p>

<p>"I say what I think," asserted Miss Snodgrass. "And if I had my
way, I'd give Laura Rambotham something she wouldn't forget. That
child'll come to a bad end yet. How do you like that colour, Miss
C.?" She had a nest of cloth-patterns in her lap, and held one up
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, you shouldn't say such things," remonstrated Miss Chapman.
"There's many a true word said in jest." She settled her glasses on
her nose. "It's very nice, but I think I like a bottle-green
better."</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't mean she'll end on the gallows, if that's
what troubles you. But she's frightfully unbalanced, and, to my
mind, ought to have some sense knocked into her before it's too
late. That's a better shade, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Poor little Laura," said Miss Chapman, and drew a sigh. "Yes, I
like that. Where did you say you were going to have the dress
made?"</p>

<p>Miss Snodgrass named, not without pride, one of the first
warehouses in the city. "I've been saving up my screw for it, and I
mean to have something decent this time. Besides, I know one of the
men in the shop, and I'm going to make them do it cheap." And here
they fell to discussing price and cut.</p>

<p>Thus the onlookers laughed and quizzed and wondered; no one was
bold enough to put an open question to Evelyn, and Evelyn did not
offer to take anyone into her confidence. She held even hints and
allusions at bay, with her honeyed laugh; which was <i>her</i>
shield against the world. Laura was the only person who ever got
behind this laugh, and what she discovered there, she did not tell.
As it was, varying motives were suggested for Evelyn's
long-suffering, nobody being ready to believe that it could really
be fondness, on her part, for the Byronic atom of humanity she had
attracted to her.</p>

<p>However that might be, the two girls, the big fair one and the
little dark one, were, outside class-hours, seldom apart. Evelyn
did not often, as in the case of the birdlike Lolo, give her young
tyrant cause for offence; if she sometimes sought another's
company, it was done in a roguish spirit&mdash;from a feminine
desire to tease. Perhaps, too, she was at heart not averse to
Laura's tantrums, or to testing her own power in quelling them. On
the whole, though, she was very careful of her little friend's
sensitive spots. She did not repeat the experiment of taking Laura
out with her; as her stay at school drew to a close she went out
less frequently herself; for the reason that, no matter how late it
was on her getting back, she would find Laura obstinately sitting
up in bed, wide-awake. And it went against the grain in her to keep
the pale-faced girl from sleep.</p>

<p>On such occasions, while she undid her pretty muslin dress,
unpinned the flowers she was never without, and loosened her
gold-brown hair, which she had put up for the evening: while she
undressed, Evelyn had to submit to a rigorous cross-examination.
Laura demanded to know where she had been, what she had done, whom
she had spoken to; and woe to her if she tried to shirk a question.
Laura was not only jealous, she was extraordinarily suspicious; and
the elder girl had need of all her laughing kindness to steer her
way through the shallows of distrust. For a great doubt of Evelyn's
sincerity had implanted itself in Laura's mind: she could not
forget the incident of the "mostly fools"; and, after an evening of
this kind, she never felt quite sure that Evelyn was not deceiving
her afresh out of sheer goodness of heart, of course&mdash;by
assuring her that she had had a "horrid time", been bored to death,
and would have much preferred to stay with her; when the truth was
that, in the company of some moustached idiot or other, she had
enjoyed herself to the top of her bent.</p>

<p>On the night Laura learned that her friend had again met the
loathly "Jim", there was a great to-do. In vain Evelyn laughed,
reasoned, expostulated. Laura was inconsolable.</p>

<p>"Look here, Poppet," said Evelyn at last, and was so much in
earnest that she laid her hairbrush down, and took Laura by both
her bony little shoulders. "Look here, you surely don't expect me
to be an old maid, do you?&mdash;<i>me</i>?" The pronoun signified
all she might not say: it meant wealth, youth, beauty, and an
unbounded capacity for pleasure.</p>

<p>"Evvy, you're not going to <i>marry</i> that horrid man?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, goosey. But that doesn't mean that I'm never
going to marry at all, does it?"</p>

<p>Laura supposed not&mdash;with a tremendous sniff.</p>

<p>"Well, then, what <i>is</i> all the fuss about?"</p>

<p>It was not so easy to say. She was of course reconciled, she
sobbed, to Evelyn marrying some day: only plain and stupid girls
were left to be old maids: but it must not happen for years and
years and years to come, and when it did, it must be to some one
much older than herself, some one she did not greatly care for: in
short, Evelyn was to marry only to escape the odium of the single
life.</p>

<p>Having drawn this sketch of her future word by word from the
weeping Laura, Evelyn fell into a fit of laughter which she could
not stifle. "Well, Poppet," she said when she could speak, "if
that's your idea of happiness for me, we'll postpone it just as
long as ever we can. I'm all there. For I mean to have a good time
first&mdash;a jolly good time&mdash;before I tie myself up for
ever, world without end, amen."</p>

<p>"That's just what I hate so&mdash;your good time, as you call
it," retorted Laura, smarting under the laughter.</p>

<p>"Everyone does, child. You'll be after it yourself when you're a
little older."</p>

<p>"Me?&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed you will."</p>

<p>"I won't. I hate men and I always shall. And oh, I
thought"&mdash;with an upward, sobbing breath&mdash;"I thought you
liked me best."</p>

<p>"Of course I like you, you silly child! But that's altogether
different. And I don't like you any less because I enjoy having
some fun with them, too."</p>

<p>"I don't want your old leavings!" said Laura savagely. It hurt,
almost as much as having a tooth pulled out, did this knowledge
that your friend's affection was wholly yours only as long as no
man was in question. And out of the sting, Laura added: "Wait till
I'm grown up, and I'll show them what I think of them&mdash;the
pigs!"</p>

<p>This time Evelyn had to hold her hand in front of her mouth.
"No, no, I don't mean to laugh at you. Come, be good now," she
petted. "And you really must go to bed, Laura. It's past twelve
o'clock, and that infernal machine'll be going off before you've
had any sleep at all."</p>

<p>The "machine" was Laura's alarum, which ran down every night
just now at two o'clock. For, if one thing was sure, it was that
affairs with Laura were in a sorry muddle. In this, the last and
most momentous year of her school life, at the close of which, like
a steep wall to be scaled, rose the university examination, she was
behindhand with her work, and occupied a mediocre place in her
class. So steadfastly was her attention pitched on Evelyn that she
could link it to nothing else: in the middle of an important task,
her thoughts would stray to contemplate her friend or wonder what
she was doing; while, if Evelyn were out for the evening, Laura
gave up her meagre pretence of study altogether, and moodily
propped her head in her hand. This was why she had hit on the small
hours for the necessary cramming; then, there were no distractions:
the great house was as still as an empty church; and Evelyn lay
safe and sound before her. So, punctually at two o'clock Laura was
startled, with a pounding heart, out of her first sleep; and
lighting the gas she sat up in bed and pored over her books. Evelyn
was not disturbed by the light, or at least she did not complain;
and it was certainly a famous time for committing things to memory:
the subsequent hours of sleep seemed rather to etch the facts into
your brain than to blur them.</p>

<p>You cannot however rob Peter to pay Paul, with impunity, and in
the weeks that followed, despite her nightly industry, Laura made
no headway.</p>

<p>As the term tapered to an end, things went from bad to worse
with her; and since, besides, the parting with Evelyn was at the
door, she was often to be seen with red-rimmed eyelids, which she
did not even try to conceal.</p>

<p>"As if she'd lost her nearest relation!" laughed her
school-fellows. And did they meet her privately, on the stairs or
in a house-corridor, they crossed their hands on their breasts and
turned up their eyes, in tragedy-fashion.</p>

<p>Laura hardly saw them; for once in her life ridicule could not
have her. The nearer the time drew, the more completely did the
coming loss of Evelyn push other considerations into the
background. It was bitter to reflect that her present dear
friendship had no more strength to endure than the thin pretences
of friendship she had hitherto played at. Evelyn and she would, no
doubt, from time to time meet and take pleasure in each other
again; but their homes lay hundreds of miles apart; and the
intimacy of the schooldays was passing away, never to return. And
no one could be held to blame for this. Evelyn's mother and father
thought, rightly enough, that it was time for their daughter to
leave school&mdash;but that was all. They did not really miss her,
or need her. No, it was just a stupid, crushing piece of ill-luck,
which happened one did not know why. The ready rebel in Laura
sprang into being again; and she fought hard against the lesson
that there are events in life&mdash;bitter, grim, and grotesque
events&mdash;beneath which one can only bow one's head. A further
effect of the approaching separation was to bring home to her a
sense of the fleetingness of things; she began to grasp that,
everywhere and always, even while you revelled in them, things were
perpetually rushing to a close; and the fact of them being things
you loved, or enjoyed, was powerless to diminish the speed at which
they escaped you.</p>

<p>Of course, though, these were sensations rather than thoughts;
and they did not hinder Laura from going on her knees to Evelyn, to
implore her to remain. Day after day Evelyn kindly and patiently
explained why this could not be; and if she sometimes drew a sigh
at the child's persistence, it was too faint to be audible. Now
Laura knew that it was possible to kill animal-pets by surfeiting
them; and, towards the end, a suspicion dawned on her that you
might perhaps damage feelings in the same way. It stood to reason:
no matter how fond two people were of each other, the one who was
about to emerge, like a butterfly from its sheath, could not be
asked to regret her release; and, at moments&mdash;when Laura lay
sobbing face downwards on her bed, or otherwise vented her
pertinacious and disruly grief&mdash;at these moments she thought
she scented a dash of relief in Evelyn, at the prospect of
deliverance.</p>

<p>But such delicate hints on the part of the hidden self are
rarely able to gain a hearing; and, as the days dropped off one by
one, like over-ripe fruit, Laura surrendered herself more and more
blindly to her emotions. The consequence was, M. P.'s prediction
came true: in the test-examinations which took place at midwinter,
Laura, together with the few dunces of her class, was ignominiously
plucked. And still staggering under this blow, she had to kiss
Evelyn good-bye, and to set her face for home.</p>

<h2>XXIV.</h2>

<blockquote>Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich st&auml;rker.<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>Mother did not know or understand anything about "tests"; and
Laura had no idea of enlightening her. She held her peace, and
throughout the holidays hugged her disgraceful secret to her,
untold. She had never before failed to pass an examination, having
always lightly skimmed the surface of them on the wings of her
parrot-like memory; hence, at home no one suspected that anything
was amiss with her. The knowledge weighed the more heavily on her
own mind. And, as if her other troubles were not enough, she was
now beset by nervous fears about the future. She saw chiefly rocks
ahead. If she did not succeed in getting through the final
examination in summer, she would not be allowed to present herself
for matriculation, and, did this happen, there would be the very
devil to pay. All her schooling would, in Mother's eyes, have been
for naught. For Mother was one of those people who laid tremendous
weight on prizes and examinations, as offering a tangible proof
that your time had not been wasted or misspent. Besides this, she
could not afford in the event of a failure, to pay the school-fees
for another year. The money which, by hook and by crook, had been
scraped together and hoarded up for Laura's education was now
coming to an end; as it was, the next six months would mean a
terrible pinching and screwing. The other children, too, were
growing day by day more costly; their little minds and bodies
clamoured for a larger share of attention. And Laura's eyes were
rudely opened to the struggle Mother had had to make both ends
meet, while her first-born was acquiring wisdom; for Mother spoke
of it herself, spoke openly of her means and resources, perhaps
with some idea of rousing in Laura a gratitude that had so far been
dormant.</p>

<p>If this was her intention she failed. Laura was much too fast
entangled in her own troubles, to have leisure for such a costly
feeling as gratitude; and Mother's outspokenness only added a fresh
weight to her pack. It seemed as if everybody and everything were
ranged against her; and guilty, careworn, lonely, she shrank into
her shell. About school affairs she again kept her lips shut,
enduring, like a stubborn martyr, the epithets "close" and
"deceitful" this reticence earned her. Her time was spent in
writing endless, scrawly letters to Evelyn, which covered days; in
sitting moodily at the top of the fir tree which she climbed in
defiance of her length of petticoat glaring at sunsets, and
brooding on dead delights; in taking long, solitary, evening walks,
by choice on the heel of a thunderstorm, when the red earth was
riddled by creeklets of running water; till Mother, haunted by a
lively fear of encounters with "swags" or Chinamen, put her foot
down and forbade them.</p>

<p>Sufferers are seldom sweet-tempered; and Laura formed no
exception. Pin, her most frequent companion, had to bear the brunt
of her acrimony: hence the two were soon at war again. For Pin was
tactless, and took small heed of her sister's grumpy moods, save to
cavil at them. Laura's buttoned-upness, for instance, and her love
of solitude, were perverse leanings to Pin's mind; and she spoke
out against them with the assurance of one who has public opinion
at his back. Laura retaliated by falling foul of little personal
traits in Pin: a nervous habit she had of clearing her
throat&mdash;her very walk. They quarrelled passionately, having
branched as far apart as the end-points of what is ultimately to be
a triangle, between which the connecting lines have not yet been
drawn.</p>

<p>Sometimes they even came to blows.</p>

<p>"I'll fetch your ma to you&mdash;that I will!" threatened Sarah,
called by the noise of the scuffle. "Great girls like
you&mdash;fightin' like bandicoots! You ought to be downright
ashamed o' yourselves."</p>

<p>"I don't know what's come over you two, I'm sure," scolded
Mother, when the combatants had been parted and brought before her
in the kitchen, where she was rolling pastry. "You never used to go
on like this. Pin, stop that noise. Do you want to deafen me?"</p>

<p>"She hit me first," sobbed Pin. "It's always Laura who
begins."</p>

<p>"I'll teach her to cheek me like that!"</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is," said Mother exasperated, and pushed a
lock of hair off her perspiring forehead with the back of her hand.
"All I say is, big girls as you are, you deserve to have the
nonsense whipped out of you. As for you, Laura, if this is your
only return for all the money I've spent on you, then I wish from
my heart you'd never seen the inside of that Melbourne school."</p>

<p>"How pretty your eyes look, mother, when your eyelashes get
floury!" said Laura, struck by the vivid contrast of black and
white. She merely stated the fact, without intent to flatter, her
anger being given to puffing out as suddenly as it kindled.</p>

<p>"Oh, get along with you!" said Mother, at the same time
skilfully lifting and turning a large, thin sheet of paste. "You
can't get round <i>me</i> like that."</p>

<p>"You used to have nice, ladylike manners," she said on another
occasion, when Laura, summoned to the drawingroom to see a visitor,
had in Mother's eyes disgraced them both. "Now, you've no more idea
how to behave than a country bumpkin. You sit there, like a stock
or a stone, as if you didn't know how to open your
mouth."&mdash;Mother was very cross.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to see that old frump anyhow," retorted Laura,
who inclined to charge the inhabitants of the township with an
extreme provinciality. "And what else was there to say, but yes or
no? She asked me all things I didn't know anything about. You don't
want me to tell stories, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, if a child of mine doesn't know the difference between
being polite and telling stories," said Mother, completely
outraged, "then, all I can say is, it's a...a great shame!" she
wound up lamely, after the fashion of hot-tempered people who begin
a sentence without being clear how they are going to end it. "You
were a nice enough child once. If only I'd never let you leave
home."</p>

<p>This jeremiad was repeated by Mother and chorused by the rest
till Laura grew incensed. She was roused to defend her present
self, at the cost of her past perfections; and this gave rise to
new dissensions.</p>

<p>So that in spite of what she had to face at school, she was not
altogether sorry, when the time came, to turn her back on her
unknowing and hence unsympathetic relations. She journeyed to
Melbourne on one of those pleasant winter days when the sun shines
from morning till night in a cloudless sky, and the chief mark of
the season is the extraordinary greenness of the grass; returned a
pale, determined, lanky girl, full of the grimmest resolutions.</p>

<p>The first few days were like a bad dream. The absence of Evelyn
came home to her in all its crushing force. A gap yawned drearily
where Evelyn had been&mdash;but then, she had been everywhere.
There was now a kind of emptiness about the great
school&mdash;except for memories, which cropped up at each turn.
Laura was in a strange room, with strange, indifferent girls; and
for a time she felt as lonely as she had done in those unthinkable
days when she was still the poor little green "new chum".</p>

<p>Her companions were not wilfully unkind to her&mdash;her last
extravagance had been foolish, not criminal&mdash;and two or three
were even sorry for the woebegone figure she cut. But her
idolatrous attachment to Evelyn had been the means of again drawing
round her one of those magic circles, which held her schoolfellows
at a distance. And the aroma of her eccentricity still clung to
her. The members of her class were deep in study, too; little was
now thought or spoken of but the approaching examinations. And her
first grief over, Laura set her teeth and flung herself on her
lessons like a dog on a bone, endeavouring to pack the
conscientious work of twelve months into less than six.</p>

<p>The days were feverish with energy. But at night the loneliness
returned, and was only the more intense because, for some hours on
end, she had been able to forget it.</p>

<p>On one such night when she lay wakeful, haunted by the prospect
of failure, she turned over the leaves of her Bible&mdash;she had
been memorising her weekly portion&mdash;and read, not as a
school-task, but for herself. By chance she lighted on the
Fourteenth Chapter of St John, and the familiar, honey-sweet words
fell on her heart like caresses. Her tears flowed; both at the
beauty of the language and out of pity for herself; and before she
closed the Book, she knew that she had found a well of comfort that
would never run dry.</p>

<p>In spite of a certain flabbiness in its outward expression, deep
down in Laura the supreme faith of childhood still dwelt intact:
she believed, with her whole heart, in the existence of an
all-knowing God, and just as implicitly in His perfect power to
succour His human children at will. But thus far on her way she had
not greatly needed Him: at the most, she had had recourse to Him
for forgiveness of sin. Now, however, the sudden withdrawal of a
warm, human sympathy seemed to open up a new use for Him. An aching
void was in her and about her; it was for Him to fill this void
with the riches of His love. And she comforted herself for her
previous lack of warmth, by the reminder that His need also was
chiefly of the heavy-laden and oppressed.</p>

<p>In the spurt of intense religious fervour that now set in for
her, it was to Christ she turned by preference, rather than to the
remoter God the Father. For of the latter she carried a kind of
Michelangelesque picture in her brain: that of an old, old man with
a flowing grey beard, who sat, Turk-fashion, one hand plucking at
this beard, the other lying negligently across His knees. Christ,
on the contrary, was a young man, kindly of face, and full of
tender invitation.</p>

<p>To this younger, tenderer God, she proffered long and glowing
prayers, which vied with one another in devoutness. Soon she felt
herself led by Him, felt herself a favourite lying on His breast;
and, as the days went by, her ardour so increased that she could
not longer consume the smoke of her own fire: it overspread her
daily life&mdash;to the renewed embarrassment of her schoolfellows.
Was it then impossible, they asked themselves, for Laura Rambotham
to do anything in a decorous and ladylike way. Must she at every
step put them out of countenance? It was not respectable to be so
fervent. Religion, felt they, should be practised with modesty; be
worn like an indispensable but private garment. Whereas she
committed the gross error in taste of, as it were, parading it
outside her other clothes.</p>

<p>Laura, her thoughts turned heavenwards, did not look low enough
to detect the distaste in her comrades' eyes. The farther she spun
herself into her intimacy with the Deity, the more indifferent did
she grow to the people and things of this world.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. Her feelings, in the beginning a mere blissful
certainty that God was Love and she was God's, ceased to be wholly
passive. Thus, her first satisfaction at her supposed election was
soon ousted by self-righteousness, did she contemplate her
unremitting devotion. And one night, when her own eloquence at
prayer had brought the moisture to her eyes&mdash;one night the
inspiration fell. Throughout these weeks, she had faithfully
worshipped God without asking so much as a pin's head from Him in
return; she had given freely; all she had, had been His. Now the
time had surely come when she might claim to be rewarded. Now it
was for Him to show that He had appreciated her homage. Oh, it was
so easy a thing for Him to help her, if He would...if He only
would!</p>

<p>Pressing her fingers to her eyeballs till the starry blindness
was effected that induces ecstasy, she prostrated herself before
the mercy-seat, not omitting, at this crisis, to conciliate the
Almighty by laying stress on her own exceeding unworthiness.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me, miserable sinner! Oh,
Christ, I ask Thy humble pardon! For I have been weak, Lord, and
have forgotten to serve Thy Holy Name. My thoughts have erred and
strayed like...like lost sheep. But loved Thee, Jesus, all the
time, my heart seemed full as it would hold...no, I didn't mean to
say that. But I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou shouldst
lead me on. But now, dear Jesus, if Thou wilt only grant me my
desire, I will never forget Thee or be false to Thee again. I will
love Thee and serve Thee, all the days of my life, till death us
do...I mean, only let me pass my examinations, Lord, and there is
nothing I will not do for Thee in return. Oh, dear Lord Jesus, Son
of Mary, hear my prayer, and I will worship Thee and adore Thee,
and never forget Thee, and that Thou hast died to save me! Grant me
this my prayer, Lord, for Christ's sake, Amen."</p>

<p>It came to this: Laura made a kind of pact with God, in which
His aid at the present juncture guaranteed her continued,
unswerving allegiance.</p>

<p>The idea once lodged in her mind, she wrestled with Him night
after night, filling His ears with her petitions, and remaining on
her knees for such an immoderate length of time that her
room-mates, who were sleepy, openly expressed their impatience.</p>

<p>"Oh, draw it mild, Laura!" said the girl in the neighbouring
bed, when it began to seem as if the supplicant would never rise to
her feet again. "Leave something to ask Him to-morrow."</p>

<p>But Laura, knowing very well that the Lord our God is a jealous
God, was mindful not to scrimp in lip-service, or to shirk the
minutest ceremony by means of which He might be propitiated and won
over. Her prayers of greeting and farewell, on entering and leaving
church, were drawn out beyond anyone else's; she did not doze or
dream over a single clause of the Litany, with its hypnotising
refrain; and she not only made the sign of the Cross at the
appropriate place in the Creed, but also privately at every mention
of Christ's name.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, she worked at her lessons with unflagging
zeal, for it was by no means her intention to throw the whole onus
of her success on the Divine shoulders. She overworked; and on one
occasion had a distressing lapse of memory.</p>

<p>And at length spring was gone and summer come, and the momentous
week arrived on which her future depended. Now, though, she was not
alone in her trepidation. The eyes of even the surest members of
the form had a steely glint in them, and mouths were hard. Dr.
Pughson's papers were said to be far more formidable than the
public examination: if you got happily through these, you were
safe.</p>

<p>Six subjects were compulsory; high-steppers took nine. Laura was
one of those with eight, and since her two obligatory mathematics
were not to be relied on, she could not afford to fail in a single
subject.</p>

<p>In the beginning, things, with the exception of numbers, went
pretty well with her. Then came the final day, and with it the
examination in history. Up to the present year Laura had cut a dash
in history; now her brain was muddled, her memory overtaxed, by her
having had to cram the whole of Green's <i>History of the English
People</i> in a few months, besides a large dose of <i>Greece</i>
and <i>Rome</i>. Reports ran of the exceptionally "catchy" nature
of Dr Pughson's questions; and Laura's prayer, the night before,
was more like a threat than a supplication. The class had only just
entered the Headmaster's room on the eventful morning, and begun to
choose desks, when there came a summons to Laura to take a
music-lesson. This was outside consideration, and Dr Pughson made
short work of the intruder&mdash;a red-haired little girl, who
blushed meekly and unbecomingly, and withdrew. Here, however, Laura
rose and declared that, under these circumstances, some explanation
was due to Monsieur Boehmer, the music-master, to-day's lesson
being in fact a rehearsal for the annual concert.</p>

<p>Dr Pughson raised his red-rimmed eyes from his desk and looked
very fierce.</p>

<p>"Tch, tch, tch!" he snapped, in the genial Irish fashion that
made him dreaded and adored. "How like a woman that is! Playing at
concerts when she can't add two and two together!&mdash;Your
arithmetic paper's fit for <i>Punch</i>, Miss Rambotham."</p>

<p>The smile he looked for went round.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the questions?&mdash;no? Well, give them here
then. You've got to go, I suppose, or we might deprive the concert
of your shining light. Hurry back, now. Stir your stumps!"</p>

<p>But this Laura had no intention of doing. In handling the
printed slip, her lagging eye had caught the last and most vital
question: "Give a full account of Oliver Cromwell's Foreign
Policy."&mdash;And she did not know it! She dragged out her
interview with the music-master, put questions wide of the point,
insisted on lingering till he had arranged another hour for the
postponed rehearsal; and, as she walked, as she talked, as she
listened to Monsieur Boehmer's ridiculous English, she strove in
vain to recall jot or tittle of Oliver's relations to foreign
powers. Oh, for just a peep at the particular page of Green! For,
if once she got her cue, she believed she could go on.</p>

<p>The dining-hall was empty when she went through it on her way
back to the classroom: her history looked lovingly at her from its
place on the shelf. But she did not dare to go over to it, take it
out, and turn up the passage: that was too risky. What she did do,
however, when she had almost reached the door, was to dash back,
pull out a synopsis&mdash;a slender, medium-sized volume&mdash;and
hastily and clumsily button this inside the bodice of her dress.
The square, board-like appearance it gave her figure, where it
projected beyond the sides of her apron, she concealed by hunching
her shoulders.</p>

<p>Her lightning plan was, to enter a cloakroom, snatch a hurried
peep at Oliver's confounded policy, then hide the book somewhere
till the examination was over. But on emerging from the dining-hall
she all but collided with the secretary, who had come noiselessly
across the verandah; and she was so overcome by the thought of the
danger she had run, and by Miss Blount's extreme surprise at Dr
Pughson's leniency, that she allowed herself to be driven back to
the examination-room without a word.</p>

<p>The girls were hard at it; they scarcely glanced up when she
opened the door. From her friends' looks, she could judge of the
success they were having. Cupid, for instance, was smirking to
herself in the peculiar fashion that meant satisfaction; M. P.'s
cheeks were the colour of monthly roses. And soon Laura, crouching
low to cover her deformity, was at work like the rest.</p>

<p>Had only Oliver Cromwell never been born!&mdash;thus she
reflected, when she had got the easier part of the paper behind
her. Why could it not have been a question about Bourke and Wills,
or the Eureka Stockade, or the voyages of Captain Cook?...something
about one's own country, that one had heard hundreds of times and
was really interested in. Or a big, arresting thing like the
Retreat of the Ten Thousand, or Hannibal's March over the Alps? Who
cared for old Oliver, and his shorn head, and his contempt for
baubles! What did it matter now to anyone what his attitude had
been, more than two hundred years ago, to all those far-away,
dream-like countries?...Desperately she pressed her hand to her
eyes. She knew the very page of Green on which Cromwell's foreign
relations were set forth; knew where the paragraph began, near the
foot of the page: what she could not get hold of was the opening
sentence that would have set her mechanical memory a-rolling.</p>

<p>The two hours drew steadily to a close. About half an hour
beforehand the weakest candidates began to rise, to hand in their
papers and leave the room; but it was not till ten minutes to
twelve that the "crack" girls stopped writing. Laura was to be
allowed an extra twenty minutes, and it was on this she relied. At
last, she was alone with the master. But though he was already
dipping into the examination-papers, he was not safe. She had
unbuttoned two buttons and was at a third, when he looked up so
unexpectedly that she was scared out of her senses, and fastened
her dress again with all the haste she could. Three or four of the
precious minutes were lost.</p>

<p>At this point, the door opened and Mr. Strachey strode into the
room. Dr Pughson blinked up from the stacks of papers, rose, and
the two spoke in low tones. Then, with a glance at Laura, they went
together to the door, which Dr Pughson held to behind him, and
stood just over the threshold. As they warmed to their talk, the
master let the door slip into the latch.</p>

<p>Laura could see them from where she sat, without being seen. A
moment later they moved stealthily away, going down the verandah in
the direction of the office.</p>

<p>Now for it! With palsied hands she undid her bodice, clutched at
the book, forced her blurred eyes to find the page, and ran them
over it. A brief survey: five or six heads to remember: a few
dates. Flapped to again; tucked under her apron; shoved into her
bosom.</p>

<p>And not a second too soon. There he came, hurrying back. And
three buttons were still undone. But Laura's head was bent over her
desk: though her heart was pummelling her ribs, her pen now ran
like lightning; and by the time the order to stop was given, she
had covered the requisite number of sheets. Afterwards she had
adroitly to rid herself of the book, then to take part&mdash;a
rather pale-eyed, distracted part&mdash;in the lively technical
discussions that ensued; when each candidate was as long-winded on
the theme of her success, or non-success, as a card-player on his
hand at the end of a round. Directly she could make good her
escape, she pleaded a headache, climbed to her bedroom and
stretched herself flat on her bed. She was through&mdash;but at
what a cost! She felt quite sore. Her very bones seemed to hurt
her.</p>

<p>Not till she was thoroughly rested, and till she had assured
herself that all risk attaching to the incident was over, did she
come to reflect on the part God had played in the business. And
then, it must be admitted, she found it a sorry one. Just at first,
indeed, her limpid faith was shocked into a reluctance to believe
that He had helped her at all: His manner of doing it would have
been so inexpressibly mean. But, little by little, she dug deeper,
and eventually she reached the conclusion that He had given her the
option of this way, throwing it open to her and then standing back
and watching to see what she would do, without so much as raising
an eyelid to influence her decision. In fact, the more she pondered
over it, the more inclined she grew to think that it had been a
kind of snare on the part of God, to trap her afresh into sin, and
thus to prolong her dependence on Him after her crying need was
past. But, if this were true, if He had done this, then He must
<i>like</i> people to remain miserable sinners, so that He might
have them always crawling to His feet. And from this view of the
case her ingenuous young mind shrank appalled. She could not go on
loving and worshipping a God who was capable of double dealing; who
could behave in such a "mean, Jewy fashion". Nor would she ever
forget His having forced her to endure the moments of torture she
had come through that day.</p>

<p>Lying on her bed, she grappled with these thoughts. A feeling of
deep resentment was their abiding result. Whatever His aim, it had
been past expression pitiless of Him, Him who had at His command
thousands of pleasanter ways in which to help her, thus to drive a
poor unhappy girl to extremities: one, too, whose petition had not
been prompted by selfish ends alone. What she had implored of Him
touched Mother even more nearly than herself: her part prayer to
Him had been to save Mother&mdash;whose happiness depended on
things like examinations&mdash;from a bitter disappointment. That
much at least He had done&mdash;she would give Him His
due&mdash;but at the expense of her entire self-respect. Oh, He
must have a cold, calculating heart...could one only see right down
into it. The tale of His clemency and compassion, which the Bible
told, was not to be interpreted literally: when one came to think
of it, had He ever&mdash;outside the Bible&mdash;been known to
stoop from His judgment-seat, and lovingly and kindly intervene? It
was her own absurd mistake: she had taken the promises made through
His Son, for gospel truth; had thought He really meant what He
said, about rewarding those who were faithful to Him. Her
companions&mdash;the companions on whom, from the heights of her
piety, she had looked pityingly down&mdash;were wiser than she.
They did not abase themselves before Him, and vow a lifelong
devotion; but neither did they make any but the most approved
demands on Him. They satisfied their consciences by paying Him
lip-homage, by confessing their sins, and by asking for a vague,
far-distant mercy, to which they attached no great importance.
Hence, they never came into fierce personal conflict with Him. Nor
would she, ever again; from this time forward, she would rival the
rest in lukewarmness. But, before she could put this resolve into
force, she had to let her first indignation subside: only then was
it possible for her to recover the shattering of her faith, and
settle down to practise religion after the glib and shallow mode of
her friends. She did not, however, say her prayers that night, or
for many a right to come; and when, at church, Christ's name
occurred in the Service, she held her head erect, and shut the ears
and eyes of her soul.</p>

<h2>XXV.</h2>

<blockquote>Ihr lerntet alle nicht tanzen, wie man Tanzen
muss&mdash;&uuml;ber euch hinweg tanzen!<br>
&mdash;Nietzsche</blockquote>

<p>The school year had ebbed; the ceremonies that attended its
conclusion were over. A few days beforehand, the fifth-form
boarders, under the tutelage of a couple of governesses, drove off
early in the morning to the distant university. On the outward
journey the candidates were thoughtful and subdued; but as they
returned home, in the late afternoon, their spirits were not to be
kept within seemly bounds. They laughed, sang, and rollicked about
inside the wagonette, Miss Zielinski weakly protesting
unheard&mdash;were so rowdy that the driver pushed his cigar-stump
to the corner of his mouth, to be able to smile at ease, and
flicked his old horse into a canter. For the public examination had
proved as anticipated, child's play, compared with what the class
had been through at Dr Pughson's hands; and its accompanying
details were of an agreeable nature: the weather was not too hot;
the examination-hall was light and airy; through the flung-back
windows trees and flowering shrubs looked in; the students were
watched over by a handsome Trinity man, who laid his straw hat on
the desk before him.</p>

<p>Then came the annual concert, at which none of the performers
broke down; Speech Day, when the body of a big hall was crowded
with relatives and friends, and when so many white, blue-beribboned
frocks were massed together on the platform, that this looked like
a great bed of blue and white flowers; and, finally, trunks were
brought out from boxrooms and strewn through the floors, and
upper-form girls emptied cupboards and drawers into them for the
last time.</p>

<p>On the evening before the general dispersion, Laura, Cupid, and
M. P. walked the well-known paths of the garden once again. While
the two elder girls were more loquacious than their wont, Laura was
quieter. She had never wholly recovered her humour since the day of
the history-examination; and she still could not look back, with
composure, on the jeopardy in which she had placed herself one
little turn of the wheel in the wrong direction, and the end of her
schooldays would have been shame and disgrace. And just as her
discovery of God's stratagem had damped her religious ardour, so
her antipathy to the means she had been obliged to employ had left
a feeling of enmity in her, towards the school and everything
connected with it: she had counted the hours till she could turn
her back on it altogether. None the less, now that the time had
come there was a kind of ache in her at having to say good-bye; for
it was in her nature to let go unwillingly of things, places and
people once known. Besides, glad as she felt to have done with
learning, she was unclear what was to come next. The idea of life
at home attracted her as little as ever&mdash;Mother had even begun
to hint as well that she would now be expected to instruct her
young brothers. Hence, her parting was effected with very mixed
feelings; she did not know in the least where she really belonged,
or under what conditions she would be happy; she was conscious only
of a mild sorrow at having to take leave of the shelter of
years.</p>

<p>Her two companions had no such doubts and regrets; for them the
past was already dead and gone; their talk was all of the future,
so soon to become the present. They forecast this, mapping it out
for themselves with the iron belief in their power to do so, which
is the hall-mark of youth.</p>

<p>Laura, walking at their side, listened to their words with the
deepest interest, and with the reverence she had learned to extend
to all opinions save her own.</p>

<p>M. P. proposed to return to Melbourne at the end of the
vacation; for she was going on to Trinity, where she intended to
take one degree after another. She hesitated only whether it was to
be in medicine or arts.</p>

<p>"Oogh!...to cut off people's legs!" ejaculated Laura. "M. P.,
how awful."</p>

<p>"Oh, one soon gets used to that, child. But I think, on the
whole, I should prefer to take up teaching. Then I shall probably
be able to have a school of my own some day."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you got Sandy's place here," said Laura,
who was assured that M. P.'s massy intellect would open all
doors.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" answered Mary, and set her lips in a determined
fashion of her own. "Stranger things have happened."</p>

<p>Cupid, less enamoured of continual discipline, intended to be a
writer. "My cousin says I've got the stuff in me. And he's a
journalist and ought to know."</p>

<p>"I should rather think he ought."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean to have a shot at it."</p>

<p>"And you, Laura?" M. P. asked suavely.</p>

<p>"Me?&mdash;Oh, goodness knows!"</p>

<p>"Close as usual, Infant."</p>

<p>"No, really not, Cupid."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll soon have to make up your mind to something now.
You're nearly sixteen. Why not go on working for your B.A.?"</p>

<p>"No thanks! I've had enough of that here." And Laura's thoughts
waved their hands, as it were, to the receding figure of Oliver
Cromwell.</p>

<p>"Be a teacher, then."</p>

<p>"M.P.! I never want to hear a date or add up a column of figures
again."</p>

<p>"Laura!"</p>

<p>"It's the solemn truth. I'm fed up with all those blessed
things."</p>

<p>"Fancy not having a single wish!"</p>

<p>"Wish?...oh, I've tons of wishes. First I want to be with Evvy
again. And then, I want to see things&mdash;yes, that most of all.
Hundreds and thousands of things. People, and places, and what they
eat, and how they dress, and China, and Japan...just tons."</p>

<p>"You'll have to hook a millionaire for that, my dear."</p>

<p>"And perhaps you'll write a book about your travels for us
stay-at-homes."</p>

<p>"Gracious! I shouldn't know how to begin. But you'll send me all
you write&mdash;all <i>your</i> books&mdash;won't you, Cupid? And,
M. P., you'll let me come and see you get your degrees&mdash;every
single one."</p>

<p>With these and similar promises the three girls parted. They
never met again. For a time they exchanged letters regularly,
many-sheeted letters, full of familiar, personal detail. Then the
detail ceased, the pages grew fewer in number, the time-gap longer.
Letters in turn gave place to mere notes and postcards, scribbled
in violent haste, at wide intervals. And ultimately even these
ceased; and the great silence of separation was unbroken. Nor were
the promises redeemed: there came to Laura neither gifts of books
nor calls to be present at academic robings. Within six months of
leaving school, M. P. married and settled down in her native
township; and thereafter she was forced to adjust the rate of her
progress to the steps of halting little feet. Cupid went
a-governessing, and spent the best years of her life in the
obscurity of the bush.</p>

<p>And Laura?...In Laura's case, no kindly Atropos snipped the
thread of her aspirations: these, large, vague, extemporary, one
and all achieved fulfilment; then withered off to make room for
more. But this, the future still securely hid from her. She went
out from school with the uncomfortable sense of being a square peg,
which fitted into none of the round holes of her world; the wisdom
she had got, the experience she was richer by, had, in the process
of equipping her for life, merely seemed to disclose her unfitness.
She could not then know that, even for the squarest peg, the right
hole may ultimately be found; seeming unfitness prove to be only
another aspect of a peculiar and special fitness. But, of the after
years, and what they brought her, it is not the purport of this
little book to tell. It is enough to say: many a day came and went
before she grasped that, oftentimes, just those mortals who feel
cramped and unsure in the conduct of everyday life, will find
themselves to rights, with astounding ease, in that freer, more
spacious world where no practical considerations hamper, and where
the creatures that inhabit dance to their tune: the world where are
stored up men's best thoughts, the hopes, and fancies; where the
shadow is the substance, and the multitude of business pales before
the dream.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the exodus of the fifty-five turned
the College upside-down.</p>

<p>Early the following morning Laura made her final preparations
for departure. This, alas! was not to be on so imposing a scale as
the departures of her schoolfellows. They, under special escort,
would have a cab apiece, and would drive off with flying
handkerchiefs and all their luggage piled high in front. Whereas
Laura's box had gone by van: for she and Pin, who was in Melbourne
on a visit, were to spend a couple of days at Godmother's before
starting up-country. Even her farewells, which she had often
rehearsed to herself with dramatic emphasis, went off without
eclat. Except for Miss Chapman, the governesses were absent when
the moment came, and Miss Chapman's mind was so full of other
things that she went on giving orders while she was shaking
hands.</p>

<p>But Laura was not destined to leave the walls, within the shadow
of which she had learned so much, as tamely as all this. There was
still a surprise in waiting for her. As she whisked about the
corridors in search of Mrs. Gurley, she met two girls, one of whom
said: "I say, Laura Rambotham, you're fetched. Your pretty sister's
come for you."</p>

<p>"My...who?" gaped Laura.</p>

<p>"Your sister. By gum, there's a nose for you&mdash;and those
whopping eyes! You'll have to play second fiddle to <i>that</i>,
all your days, my dear."</p>

<p>On entering the reception-room Laura tried hard to see Pin with
the eyes of a stranger. Pin rose from her chair&mdash;awkwardly, of
course, for there were other people present, and Laura's violent
stare was disconcerting in the extreme: it made Pin believe her hat
was crooked, or that she had a black speck on her nose. As for
Laura, she could see no great change in her sister; the freckles
were certainly paler, and the features were perhaps beginning to
emerge a little, from the cushiony fat in which they were bedded;
but that was all. Still, if outsiders, girls in particular, were
struck by it...</p>

<p>A keener stab than this&mdash;really, she did not grudge Pin
being pretty: it was only the newness of the thing that
hurt&mdash;a keener stab was it that, though she had ordered Pin
repeatedly, and with all the stress she was master of, to come in a
wagonette to fetch her, so that she might at least drive away like
the other girls; in spite of this, the little nincompoop had after
all arrived on foot. Godmother had said the idea of driving was
stuff and nonsense&mdash;a quite unnecessary expense. Pin, of
course, had meekly given in; and thus Laura's last brave attempt to
be comfortably like her companions came to naught. She went out of
the school in the same odd and undignified fashion in which she had
lived there.</p>

<p>The wrangle caused by Pin's chicken-heartedness lasted the
sisters down the garden-path, across the road, and over into the
precincts of a large, public park. Only when they were some
distance through this, did Laura wake to what was happening to her.
Then, it came over her with a rush: she was free, absolutely free;
she might do any mortal thing she chose.</p>

<p>As a beginning she stopped short.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Pin...take this," she said, giving her sister the
heavy leather bag they were carrying in turns to the tramway. Pin
obediently held out her hand, in its little white cotton glove.</p>

<p>"And my hat."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Laura?"</p>

<p>"You'll see."</p>

<p>"You'll get sunstroke!"</p>

<p>"Fiddles!&mdash;it's quite shady. Here're my gloves. Now, Pin,
you follow your nose and you'll find me&mdash;<i>where</i> you find
me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what <i>are</i> you going to do, Laura?" cried Pin, in
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a good run," said Laura; and tightened her
hair-ribbon.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can't run in the street! You're too big. People'll
see you."</p>

<p>"Think I care?&mdash;If you'd been years only doing what you
were allowed to, I guess you'd want to do something you weren't
allowed to, too. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She was off, had darted away into the leaden heat of the
December morning, like an arrow from its bow, her head bent, her
arms close to her sides, fleet-footed as a spaniel: Pin was faced
by the swift and rhythmic upturning of her heels. There were not
many people abroad at this early hour, but the few there were,
stood still and looked in amazement after the half-grown girl in
white, whose thick black plait of hair sawed up and down as she
ran; and a man with mop and bucket, who was washing statues,
stopped his work and whistled, and winked at Pin as she passed.</p>

<p>Cross and confused Pin trudged after her sister, Laura's hat and
gloves in one hand, the leather bag in the other.</p>

<p>Right down the central avenue ran Laura, growing smaller and
smaller in the distance, the area of her movements decreasing as
she ran, till she appeared to be almost motionless, and not much
larger than a figure in the background of a picture. Then came a
sudden bend in the long, straight path. She shot round it, and was
lost to sight.</p>
