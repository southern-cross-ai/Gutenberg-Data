  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;A PARROT-CRY</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol XLVIII, Jun 1918, pp
  44-50</h3>

  <p class="first">AS Manning fell headlong into the room, full of one single,
  determined purpose, he was conscious of the amazing contrast between the
  conditions inside and out. He was half aware of what he saw, like one who
  dreams uneasily and illogically. For there, all was peace and refinement and
  the little odds and ends of luxury that go to make up the thing we call
  home.</p>

  <p>To begin with, Edith Carson was sitting at the piano, playing some soft,
  elusive music to herself. There was just the suggestion of a smile on her
  face. The light from the subdued lamps reflected on the white blur of her
  dress and the diamonds in her dusky hair. Then she caught sight of Manning,
  and her expression changed to a sort of haughty amazement.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Manning," she said, "what does this mean?"</p>

  <p>Manning strode across the room and laid a heavy hand upon the girl's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come along!" he said. "There is not a moment to be lost! Come without a
  word!"</p>

  <p>Edith Carson rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Really!" she protested. "Really!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's not time for anything of that sort," Manning said bitterly.
  "I am not welcome, I know, but that's not the point. I will explain as we go
  along."</p>

  <p>"You'll explain now," the girl said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Very well then," Manning said between his teeth. "Those blackguards have
  risen at last. There's not a man on the estate who is loyal to Adair. I told
  you what they were&mdash;I warned you not to come here, in the disturbed
  state of the country. This isn't Europe; it's a little pocket-handkerchief
  State in No Man's Land. You ought to have stayed in the town. And now, to put
  it mildly, your life is in danger."</p>

  <p>Still the girl failed to comprehend. She elevated her eyebrows daintily
  and scornfully. "I stay here till the Adairs come back," she said.</p>

  <p>Manning lost no time in further argument. He slipped his arm round the
  girl's waist and fairly lifted her off her feet as he carried her on to the
  balcony. Then he switched off the electric lights.</p>

  <p>"Look," he said, " and listen!"</p>

  <p>It was all soft, velvety darkness outside, a tranquil summer night, fair
  as the stars powdering the sky overhead. But here and there lights glowed
  against the sky, and ever and again flashes of flame stabbed the darkness.
  And then there came in quick succession the sound of shots.</p>

  <p>"There are over five hundred of the devils there," Manning said hoarsely,
  "looting and burning&mdash;yes, and murdering! They call it a strike. And
  they are coming here! Now you are beginning to understand?"</p>

  <p>Edith Carson drew a deep breath. It was coming home to her now, right
  enough. But even then, in that moment of peril, she was conscious of the
  feeling of resentment in her heart against the man by her side. For he had
  warned her of this&mdash;warned her of the danger of coming so far from the
  town at a time of labour unrest&mdash;and he had been right. He had always
  been right in his simple, dogged way, even from the moment, two years ago,
  when he had asked her to marry him, and she had laughed him to scorn. And now
  here they were, side by side, face to face with a terror all the more
  alarming because neither of them knew in what form it had come.</p>

  <p>"Where are the Adairs?" Edith asked.</p>

  <p>"In Adigo by this time," Manning said. "I managed to warn them as they
  came along in the car, and they turned back. They could do nothing by coming
  on, and I promised to look after you. Even then we had to fight for it. But
  the car is outside, and I am waiting. If yoa have the slightest regard for
  your safety, come with me at once."</p>

  <p>Still the girl sat there hesitating.</p>

  <p>"Where is Señor del Sartes?" she asked. "He would be able to stop all
  this, I am sure."</p>

  <p>Manning smiled grimly under cover of the darkness. It was not for him to
  say just then that del Sartes lay out there in the garden with a bullet
  through that black heart of his, and that the hand that fired the shot was
  still half clasped about the waist of her who asked the question.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," Manning said simply. "except that he is dead. But I
  can tell you this&mdash;Miguel del Sartes was no friend of yours. Oh, I know
  what you think. You think I was jealous of him, and perhaps I was. And I know
  that he had fascinated you with those beautiful manners of his, to say
  nothing of his handsome face. If he had been here half an hour before me, we
  should never have met again!"</p>

  <p>"Señor del Sartes was a gentleman," Edith said.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't," Manning said doggedly. "He was a black-hearted scoundrel. I
  couldn't tell you this before, because I was not sure, and I don't think, you
  would have believed me, anyway. But this I can tell you&mdash;he had a wife
  up there in the mountains, in that lonely hacienda of his, a poor creature
  who had lost her reason because of his treatment of her. And now do you begin
  to understand? Now perhaps you will believe me when I tell you that this
  uprising was engineered by him&mdash;well, because he has a wife, and because
  he had dared to raise his eyes to you."</p>

  <p>No words came from Edith Carson's lips, though she tried to smile, but she
  knew very well, deep down in her heart, that this was a true thing. And she
  knew that Manning had come all this way, taking his life in his hands, for
  her sake. Another shot or two rang out, and somewhere in the garden the two
  standing on the balcony could hear the patter of stealthy feet. Manning
  waited for no more. He lifted the girl in his arms and staggered out into the
  night. He blundered down the path through the garden, and out into the road,
  where the car was waiting. He placed his burden inside and started the
  engine, after which he switched on the light. Then for a quarter of an hour
  or more the little car raced down the mountain road unmolested, save that
  every now and then a little flash of light from a rifle struck into the
  darkness. But they were through at length, and presently the car pulled up by
  the side of a deep ravine.</p>

  <p>"We are fairly safe now," Manning said; "at least, we shall be till
  morning; and, after that, it largely depends upon your coolness and courage.
  We can't go back&mdash; any attempt to reach Adigo would be madness. The
  whole country will be in a state of chaos for days, and any Englishman or
  woman caught by those madmen would&mdash;well, you ought to know by this
  time."</p>

  <p>They sat there, talking more or less fitfully, till the night began to
  fade, and then suddenly the sun shot up over the mountain peaks in a blaze of
  golden glory. It was wonderfully still and quiet there, with the snow-capped
  mountains behind them, and the deep river, cutting its way through the rocky
  gorge, lay at their feet. It was only a narrow gorge, not more than sixty or
  seventy feet at the outside, and the stream ran between with a steep
  precipice on either side. On the further bank the virgin forest began, a
  glorious tangle of tree and undergrowth, stretching back for a mile or two
  till the plains were reached, and it was for these plains that Manning was
  making.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better tell you what I am trying to do," he said. "We can't
  go back, because that is impossible. We should never get through to Adigo.
  And if we cross the river, we may reach that little station where Addison and
  his assistants have established themselves. You have met Addison?"</p>

  <p>Edith nodded. She had met the distinguished naturalist more than once at
  the Adairs' hacienda, and, indeed, she rather liked the somewhat eccentric
  individual who had come all those miles from home in the interests of
  science.</p>

  <p>"We shall be all right there," Manning said, "if we can only reach the
  place. There are half a dozen good men with Addison, and I know they have got
  at least one machine-gun there. But we haven't done with the danger yet. We
  have got to get through two miles of virgin forest, unless we go down the
  river's bank on the far side, and that might take at least a week. I have
  crossed that belt of forest only once before, and, if I lose my way, we can
  just sit down and starve."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am ready, if you are," Edith said. "And I am truly sorry, Tom. I
  have behaved very badly to you, and I want to tell you so. I suppose I was
  angry because you were right."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we can go into all that presently," Manning said almost roughly. "We
  have got something else to think about now besides apologies. Those people
  are sure to follow us, even if it is only for the sake of getting hold of the
  car. What we have got to do now is to get across the river and cut off our
  retreat."</p>

  <p>Across that rocky gorge, from one side to the other, with the river
  running two hundred feet below, was a slender steel rope, a kind of endless
  band running over wheels at either end. Suspended by this was a sort of
  basket arrangement by means of which the natives of those parts crossed the
  ravine. Edith looked at it and shuddered. She was plucky enough, as a rule,
  but the idea of crossing in that basket filled her with dismay.</p>

  <p>"Is that the only way?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Manning said. "It's quite safe. Now, I am going to put you
  in the basket, and I shall stand over you with my feet on either side. Now,
  then, screw your courage up. Think what would happen if any of those people
  were following us, and it's any money some of them are doing so. I think I
  had better blindfold you."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Edith cried. "that would be horrible. How brave you are,
  Tom!"</p>

  <p>Manning grunted. He was in no smiling mood. He loved the girl by his side,
  but he could not altogether smother a certain resentment against her because
  she had quite wilfully placed herself in this position. He lifted her without
  ceremony in his arms and dumped her down in the bottom of the basket. He
  stood with his feet on either side, swaying perilously, and then began to
  work the steel rope over the wheel. It was a long and arduous task with the
  double weight, and Manning's muscles felt as if they were on fire by the time
  he had reached the other side and placed the girl safely on the cliff.</p>

  <p>"You just sit there," he said, "and wait till I come back. Oh, yes, I must
  go. You are all right here. You see, I have got my rifle and cartridges to
  fetch, and I managed to get hold of a certain amount of food last night,
  which is in the car. I planned all this out as I came along. I knew, if I got
  to the hacienda before del Sartes, that we should have a good sporting
  chance. And, thank Heaven, I was not too late!"</p>

  <p>Manning came back presently with the basket loaded to the top, and then
  slowly and patiently proceeded to saw through the steel hawser with a file.
  It was tedious work, but presently the last strand snapped, and the wire rope
  disappeared in the bed of the river. With the snapping of the last strand
  something seemed to give way in Manning, too, for he wiped the heavy drops
  from his hot face, and for the first time since they started his features
  relaxed into a smile.</p>

  <p>"I think we are all right now," he said. "The wretches can't follow
  us&mdash;at least, not for a day or two, anyhow, and by that time we ought to
  reach our friends."</p>

  <p>"A day or two!" Edith exclaimed. "I thought it was only two or three
  miles. Surely we shan't be all that time getting through the forest?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we may or we may not," Manning said cheerfully. "If we take the
  wrong turning, it may be a week."</p>

  <p>He spoke easily enough, and with a certain indifference that he was far
  from feeling. He knew only too well, sportsman and wanderer as he was, what
  it meant to get off the track even in four or five square miles of that dense
  forest. He had heard of natives, men accustomed to the woodland life, who had
  lain down there and died of starvation within half a mile of their own huts.
  It was the time of the year, too, when the vegetation grew with almost savage
  luxuriance, so that Manning could see almost at a first glance how all trace
  of track and path had disappeared. They were only a mile or two from safety,
  but then he had heard and seen enough of that wild country on the other side
  of the ravine to know the danger in which they stood.</p>

  <p>But of this he said nothing. There would be time enough for that when the
  dread catastrophe stared them in the face. He had no guide or compass,
  nothing but his own instinct and the memory of one journey through that dense
  forest. Here and there was a patch of clear ground, and in one of these they
  camped presently and partook of a meal. It was late in the afternoon before
  Manning made his first attempt at progress, only to find himself driven back
  presently on to the clearing, with a cold sensation at his heart and the
  knowledge that he and his companion were in deadly peril. For there was no
  sign of a track to be seen anywhere, and though there were openings here and
  there, they were breast-high in a sea of grass and luxuriant foliage. To go
  back was impossible, to go forward something like madness. And as the day
  went on and night came, followed by another dawn, Edith Carson began to see
  that Manning was keeping something from her. Up to now she had undergone no
  hardship particularly, for the nights were mild enough, and her thin evening
  dress, together with Manning's coat, had been sufficient to protect her.</p>

  <p>She turned to him suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>"Not for myself," Manning replied. "At a pinch I could do the few miles
  down-stream and swim the ravine. I have matches and some cartridges, and I am
  used to this sort of life, as you know. But&mdash;yes, I might just as well
  tell you, we're in terrible danger, and I am to blame."</p>

  <p>"You are not!" the girl cried. "We may be in terrible danger, but nothing
  like the peril I should have had to face if you had not come to my
  assistance."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you understand that," Manning said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do! Del Sartes stirred up that strike. There would have been no
  trouble but for him. And he did it because&mdash; because&mdash;oh, I cannot
  say it!"</p>

  <p>"Because he wanted to get hold of you," Manning interrupted. "His idea was
  that no one on the estate should survive last night's work. And if I had not
  heard of this and hastened to the spot, he would have succeeded. At any rate,
  he has paid the price. I saw to that."</p>

  <p>"You killed him?" Edith cried.</p>

  <p>"I shot him, certainly. On my side, at any rate, it was a fair fight. But
  what does it matter? Why go into all that? It is the future we have to think
  of."</p>

  <p>Edith Carson bent her head in shame. She remembered now the warnings that
  Manning had given her, and how she had flouted them. The spoilt child of a
  rich American father, she had travelled the world us she pleased, making
  friends here and there, and living her own self-centred life until Manning
  had drifted across her horizon. Perhaps, if his admiration had been a little
  less manifest, if he had not wooed her quite so humbly, she might have given
  him her heart long ago. And because he had followed her half across the
  world, it had been her mood to treat him with a certain good-humoured
  contempt. But that was not her feeling now.</p>

  <p>She turned to him suddenly, with a look in her eyes that a little while
  before would have filled him with gladness.</p>

  <p>"I am responsible for all this," she said. "How foolish I have been, how
  blind! And yet I meant nothing. Now tell me the truth&mdash;tell me, are we
  standing here face to face with death? I am not without courage, Tom. I shall
  dread things a lot less if I really know."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, we are," Manning said. "We can't go back, and I don't know
  the way forward. It's only a mile or two, if I knew the right direction, but
  it might be a continent as far as we are concerned. And I am afraid to leave
  this clearing. There are all sorts of dangers round us&mdash;snakes and wild
  beasts, and all that kind of thing. We have enough food for a few days, with
  care, and I have my gun. Good Heavens, how helpless a man is at times like
  this!"</p>

  <p>They made more than one attempt to find an avenue of safety down those
  tangled green lanes, but each evening, before dusk fell, they were forced
  back again into the opening, where they sat, sharing the rapidly-decreasing
  stock of provisions, augmented from time to time by Manning with his gun.
  They kept up a good fire, there in the heart of the forest; and long after
  Edith had fallen asleep, to dream fitful dreams. Manning sat moodily looking
  into the gloom beyond the ring of the firelight, and catching the amber glow
  in more than one pair of restless, savage eyes. And so it went on, until
  there was barely enough food left for another day or so, and Manning was down
  to his last handful of cartridges. His clothes hung about him in rags, his
  face was grimy, and his chin black with a four days' growth of beard. And, in
  sooth, Edith Carson was in little better case. Manning had saved her as much
  as possible, but that filmy evening dress of hers was all in shreds, the
  diamonds&mdash;which she still wore in her dusky hair&mdash;looked
  grotesquely out of place. And so the fourth evening came, with Edith sleeping
  a few yards away, and Manning hunched up by the side of the fire, his empty
  pipe in his mouth and a look on his face that was not good to see. He was
  tired and worn out, and very near the breaking-point with fatigue and
  anxiety. Presently he began to nod, and was drifting off subconsciously into
  the realm of dreams, when a voice struck on his ear.</p>

  <p>It was a strange, hoarse voice, hardly human, a croaking, mocking sort of
  voice from somewhere overhead, so that Manning opened his eyes with a sudden
  feeling that he was either dreaming or that he was on the verge of madness.
  He took a pull at himself and wiped the cold moisture from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I am going dotty!" he murmured. "I mustn't do that&mdash;I mustn't do
  that!"</p>

  <p>Then the voice came again, clearly enough this time, and Manning knew
  beyond question that he was listening to it, cold and trembling, but with all
  his senses about him.</p>

  <p>"Have a drink! Have a drink!" the voice said from somewhere overhead.
  "Have a whisky and soda!"</p>

  <p>Manning laughed. A queer, hysterical feeling gripped him by the throat.
  Edith Carson sat up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" she whispered. "Was it real?"</p>

  <p>"It must be real if we both heard it," Manning said.</p>

  <p>"I heard it last night," Edith went on. "Just the same words, only I
  thought I was dreaming, and didn't like to say anything about it."</p>

  <p>The voice came no more, and daylight failed to afford any trace of a human
  footstep. And then, next day, towards evening, just as it was getting dark,
  the mysterious voice was heard once more in the dense mass of foliage
  overhead. At the repetition of the familiar suggestion Manning broke into a
  peal of unsteady laughter. He pointed upwards.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what it is?" he asked. "It's a parrot&mdash;a parrot
  evidently escaped from somewhere close by, and beyond question belonging to
  some Englishman. Now, I wonder if that bird belongs to Addison? He's got any
  amount of birds there&mdash;in fact, birds are his particular hobby. He can
  do anything he likes with them. It's any money this parrot belongs to
  him."</p>

  <p>"It must," Edith said. "But I don't see how this is going to help us."</p>

  <p>Manning sat there furiously thinking. He moved presently a little further
  into the open, then beckoned Edith to his side. Silently he pointed upwards.
  And there, on a branch a few feet above their heads, was a great grey parrot
  eyeing them with a sort of solemn friendliness, and a peculiar twinkle in
  that beady little black orb of his.</p>

  <p>"Whisky and soda!" he said. "Come and have a whisky and soda! Help
  yourself, my boy!"</p>

  <p>"If we could only get hold of him!" Edith whispered.</p>

  <p>"Ah, if we only could!" Manning said, with a deep breath. "Look at him!
  There isn't a feather out of place. He's too sleek and well fed to have
  escaped of his own accord. He's one of Addison's pets, and is probably
  allowed to fly about the forest as he likes. If we can only get hold of him,
  we are saved."</p>

  <p>"Are we?" Edith asked eagerly. "How?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the rest would be easy. We could write a little note to Addison and
  tie it round the bird's claw, telling our friend exactly where we are, and
  the rest is easy. Addison knows every inch of this ground, and he could reach
  us without the slightest trouble. It's any odds that bird goes back home some
  time or other, once a day, to be fed, certainly. Here, Polly! Pretty
  bird!"</p>

  <p>As the familiar tongue struck upon the bird's ear, he burst into a laugh
  and hopped down two or three branches till he was almost within grasp.</p>

  <p>"Addison's bird for a million!" Manning cried. "That's his laugh to a
  note. Come along, Polly!"</p>

  <p>But the parrot refused to come any closer. It was only when Manning
  produced a small portion of his precious food that the grey bird showed
  further signs of friendliness. It was maddening to have him just one yard out
  of reach, when the absolute salvation of two human lives lay, so to speak,
  across those glossy grey wings. Manning and his companion stood there silent
  and motionless and hardly breathing in the tension of the moment. Then the
  parrot fluttered to the ground, croaking and snapping his beak at the
  tempting food. Manning dropped on his hands and knees, and crawled cautiously
  forward, knowing that two lives depended upon the next moment. Then he took
  his coat from his back and, reaching forward, dropped it quietly over the
  shining mass of grey feathers. There was a little struggle, and a volley of
  oaths in the Spanish tongue, and then the bird was safe in Manning's
  grasp.</p>

    <img src="1301071h-images/AParrotCry.jpg"
         title="Manning crawled cautiously forward...">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Take my pocket-book out of my pocket," he said, with the sweat pouring
  down his face. "Just write a few lines to Addison, explaining where we are.
  It's our only chance."</p>

  <p>The note was written, shakily enough, and then wound round one of the
  bird's claws and carefully tied with some strands of silk taken from Edith
  Carson's dress. After that Manning pitched the parrot into the air, and he
  sailed away high over the tree-tops, screaming and chattering vehemently at
  the treatment to which he had been subjected.</p>

  <p>"I hope to Heaven he is going straight home," Manning said. "If so, we are
  saved, though I expect we shall have to wait till morning."</p>

  <p>They sat round the fire now, talking freely enough, for their hearts were
  full of hope, and, moreover, before they settled down to sleep, they had come
  to a perfect understanding. The sun was climbing high before Manning opened
  his eyes, and when he did so he saw the kindly face of his naturalist friend
  looking down upon him from behind his gold-rimmed spectacles. There were
  other men besides the famous naturalist gazing eagerly at the strange scene
  before them.</p>

  <p>"You can tell me all about it presently, old man," Addison said.
  "Meanwhile, come along and bring the lady with you, and get a bath and a
  change of clothing. You have had a close call, evidently. If it hadn't been
  for the parrot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whisky and soda! Whisky and soda!" croaked a voice overhead. "Help
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I could do with one, Polly!" Manning laughed unsteadily. "You are a
  wise bird."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">2.&mdash;THE ARMS OF CHANCE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 27 Jul
  1918</h3><br>

  <p class="first">OPPOSITE the window was a portrait of a young man; the lower
  part of the canvas was a red splash, and the girl shivered as she noticed
  it.</p>

  <p>For this was a portrait of Norman de Montfort, the author and playwright
  whose tragic death had caused such a sensation in literary circles a month or
  two ago. Why? He had written one or two one-act comedies, and was looking
  forward eagerly to the success of a big drama that he had just finished. When
  Cecile had seen him on the morning of his death he had been in the highest
  possible spirits. He was rejoicing in the fact that he had the cottage
  entirely to himself till midnight, at least; it was his intention to devote
  the whole of the day to the completion of the play, after which he was going
  to take an entire month's rest.</p>

  <p>The play he had refused to discuss with any one, except to tell his sister
  and his great friend, Philip Ayres, the artist and scene-painter, that it was
  a play within a play, and that no one was going to see it until it was
  actually finished. But from time to time Cecile had elicited certain details
  without really seeing any of the script.</p>

  <p>And then she had come down that spring evening with her brother's friend,
  and, incidentally, the man she was going to marry, thinking only of the
  pleasant Sunday they were going to spend together, and she had suddenly found
  herself face to face with stark tragedy.</p>

  <p>She had a task before her now, and that task she was going to see through
  with the aid of Philip Ayres, whom she was waiting for at that moment. He
  came presently, with an apology for the delay, but Cecile was not
  listening.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you will wonder why I asked you to come down here, Philip," she
  said. "But I am more than ever convinced that poor Norman was murdered."</p>

  <p>"Well," Ayres said, "you know I don't agree with you, though I never could
  see the reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what you are going to say. Poor old Norman hadn't an enemy in
  the world. You want to know what object the murderer had. Well, I'm going to
  tell you. He came down here to steal Norman's play."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Ayres exclaimed. "It was very strange that no trace of the
  manuscript should have been found, though we know that it was practically
  finished."</p>

  <p>"It has been found," Cecile said quietly.</p>

  <p>"What! You mean to say that you've got it?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I have a copy of it. You will ask if I know why it is a copy.
  Well, perhaps I had better explain. Now, I have been at the Thespian for over
  a year, not playing very big parts, but for the most part understudying
  Stella Marx. As you know, she has been on tour for the last month or so,
  playing repertory with Raynor Plunkett, previous to her going to take up an
  engagement in America. Now, about a month ago they produced a new drama in
  Liverpool called 'The Arms of Chance.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw that. From all accounts it seems to have been a magnificent
  success."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed it was. Now my manager at the Thespian intends to produce 'The
  Arms of Chance' in London in about a month's time, with Raynor Plunkett in
  the lead, and the repertory company which is now in the North. And as Stella
  Marx is going to America I have been asked to play her part in London. Oh,
  yes, I know it's a big thing tor me, but I'm not thinking about that. I am
  going to tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's rather a funny thing, Cecile," Ayres said, "but I have been engaged
  to paint the scenery for the new play. The scene plot reached me only this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know it did, Phil., and that is why I asked you to meet me here
  this morning. In fact, after I had read the manuscript of 'The Arms of
  Chance' it was I who suggested to Mr. Brentwood that he should give you the
  commission. I have got the play in my pocket at the present moment, and I
  want you to sit here for an hour or so and read it. And when you have done so
  you will probably have some idea of what is in my mind."</p>

  <p>Ayres sat down with the manuscript in his hand, and for an hour or so read
  steadily on. Then he looked up eagerly. "By Jove! that's a funny thing," he
  said. "Why, the two big scenes in the drama might have taken place in this
  cottage. The conversation centres round a portrait of the writer painted by
  Jean Sacks. And there is your brother looking down upon us now in the shape
  of one of Sack's masterpieces. By Jove! I notice the strange handles on that
  Jacobean sideboard which are mentioned in the play."</p>

  <p>"Raynor Plunkett, who himself appears in the leading character, is
  supposed to have written the play. He used to come here from time to time,
  and he would be well aware of the fact that Norman had discussed his play
  with no one. Why, there is one little scene that could be known only to
  Norman and myself."</p>

  <p>"That is a very serious thing to say, Cecile," Ayres murmured. "Now, what
  do you propose to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Phil., I am more concerned for my brother's reputation. Why should he be
  robbed of the fruits of his genius? Why should a man who is nothing but a
  mere picturesque actor cloak himself in a dead man's fame? I believe that
  that was the term that inspired Plunkett to murder. But never mind about that
  for the moment. What I want you to do is to make the scene of the two big
  acts an exact copy of this cottage. I even want you to take the furniture
  away and put it on the stage of the Thespian."</p>

  <p>"What, just as it is?" Ayres exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. And see that my brother's portrait by Sacks hangs in a
  prominent position. Now do you begin to understand, Phil.?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I do," Ayres murmured. "And so you are going to reconstruct
  the crime, Cecile?"</p>

  <p>"I want nothing else," she cried. "It is the best plan, Phil., and I am
  sure you are going to help me."</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," Ayres responded. "But there are many difficulties in
  the way. If I grasp your scheme, it is intensely dramatic, and a sudden
  surprise is at the bottom of it. When you come to rehearse with
  Plunkett&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I shan't," Cecile said, eagerly. "At least, not in the proper sense
  of the word. You see, I am the one new member of the company which has
  already made the reputation of the piece. Raynor Plunkett may pay me the
  compliment of giving me a couple of hours in his dressing-room or on the bare
  stage one morning but there will be no dress rehearsal&mdash;there will not
  be time. And if you do your part properly, then I have no fear of the
  result."</p>

  <p>There had been a great deal of talk, of course, about the play by that
  eminent actor, Raynor Plunkett, which had been so successful in the North,
  and which was to be produced within the next week or two at the Thespian
  Theatre. He had come down from the North with the rest of the company, and in
  his own large way had proclaimed to the manager, Brentwood, that he wanted
  nothing besides the assurance that Stella Marx's part would be adequately
  filled. Not that he attached much importance to the heroine&mdash;he was too
  assured of his own personal triumph for that.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he stared and frowned when he heard who had been cast for
  the part of the heroine. He would see her, of course, in the dressing-room
  for an hour or two for a couple of mornings before the production of the
  piece, and that, no doubt, would be quite sufficient. As to the rest of the
  company, he was perfectly satisfied.</p>

  <p>The house was packed from floor to ceiling, of course. The mere fact that
  Raynor Plunkett was appearing in a new play would have been enough in itself
  to fill any theatre in London. The story of the Northern triumph had gone
  abroad, so that that critical audience were looking for something out of the
  common. The curtain went up presently, and the opening act with its subtle
  developments proceeded smoothly enough to its close. It was more a brilliant
  analysis of character than anything else, closely reasoned and intimately
  written, and it held the audience in a close grip from the start. It was the
  story of a play within a play, the history of a perverted genius who, after
  many attempts, has at last found himself and his proper medium of expression.
  But he is poor and struggling, and cannot find an opening for his great work.
  Then on the scene comes the great popular actor in the shape of the leading
  character, who tempts the author to sell his work out and out and dissociate
  himself entirely from the authorship. This he indignantly refuses to do, and
  eventually, in the seclusion of the author's cottage the actor does him to
  death when they are roughly rehearsing one of the big scenes, and sets off
  with the only copy of the manuscript that exists.</p>

  <p>Then followed the second act, actually in the cottage where the main
  scenes of the play take place. The author is seated at work putting the final
  touches to the last page of his manuscript when the actor comes in. He came,
  of course, in the shape of Raynor Plunkett, easy and assured, and posing in a
  characteristic attitude for the applause to subside. Then, as he stood there,
  glancing easily about him, he suddenly stiffened and his whole expression
  changed. It was as if he had been snatched away from his surroundings and
  carried back to some scene that he was striving to forget. He stumbled
  forward and put his hand over his eyes. He was so palpably disturbed and so
  shaken that a thrill went through the house, and people in the stalls began
  to whisper together.</p>

  <p>What was the matter with Plunkett, they asked&mdash;was he going to faint
  or collapse altogether? It was only for a moment, then the man on the stage
  pulled himself together again, and began to go through his part. But it was
  plain enough to the most inexperienced of theatre-goers that all the life had
  gone out of the part, and that the colour and light and shade had vanished.
  It was not at Raynor Plunkett that those people were looking, but some
  amateur suffering from stage fright, who paused from time to time and glanced
  about him as if certain objects in that cottage interior fascinated and
  paralysed him. There was one portrait on the wall that seemed to freeze him
  and tie his tongue every time he glanced at it. Ever and again the voice of
  the prompter could be clearly heard.</p>

  <p>But still Plunkett struggled on, his long experience and perfect stage
  training keeping him from utter collapse. The lengthy scene came to an end
  presently with the author of the play lying dead on the floor with a bullet
  through his brain, and a woman in her night-clothing, with her hair hanging
  over her shoulders, standing in the doorway looking on, with an expression of
  one who walks in her sleep. Then, almost to the relief of everybody in the
  house, the curtain came down, and a thrill ran through the audience.</p>

  <p>They would have thrilled more, perhaps, could they have seen what was
  taking place behind those closed tapestries. For Plunkett stood there shaking
  like a leaf from head to foot, his face wet and ghastly as he looked into a
  pair of burning eyes that seemed to pierce through him as Cecile de Montfort
  came nearer to him with an accusing question on her face. She did not speak,
  she turned slowly presently, and faced the portrait of her dead brother on
  the wall. She was strung up to it now, cool and calm enough, and yet inwardly
  raging, but outwardly she was a white avenging spirit. He faced her quietly
  enough.</p>

  <p>But he could see that she was determined; he could see that he was up
  against something more than a crisis in his life. She was so cool and quiet,
  too, so obviously collected, so like an animal that has tracked its prey down
  and knows only too well that the victim is beyond the power of escape. It
  seemed strange to the man, fighting for his life, as he knew he was, that he
  should be baffled and bruised and beaten by a mere girl, just an ordinary
  actress that he tossed a smile or a nod to and expected her to be grateful
  for.</p>

  <p>And this little bit of a thing with her reputation still to make held him
  and his fortune in the hollow of her hands. Just for a moment he wondered
  whether or not it was possible to make some compromise with her, whether or
  not she might be disposed to put her future before the call of nature and her
  desire to be avenged. But this was only for a moment, and as he looked into
  the girl's eyes he could see no shadow of an escape that way. And, for the
  life of him, he could not speak, he could not shape those cool, insolent
  words that played about at the back of his brain and trembled at the tip of
  his tongue. The situation was fast becoming intolerable. It was Cecile who
  broke the silence at length.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said coldly. "It's for you to speak. Go on, I am waiting. What
  are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>The man broke way and headed off the stage in the direction of the
  dressing-room, past a dozen curious eyes, and past the manager, who would
  have detained him.</p>

  <p>"Don't stop me," he said hoarsely. "A sudden illness&mdash;a very old
  trouble of mine. A little brandy, perhaps, and I shall be all right
  again."</p>

  <p>He tumbled almost headlong into his dressing-room, and the uneasy
  Brentwood heard the key turn in the lock. There would be a long wait now, and
  perhaps by the time the next act began all would be well. Meanwhile, a
  half-frightened company stood huddled in the wings, shaken and uneasy, and
  wondering what was going to happen next. And then a call-boy came along and
  put a note in Cecile's hand. She recognised Plunkett's straggling scrawl,
  and, without opening the envelope, handed it to Brentwood, who was standing
  by her side.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better see this, Mr. Brentwood," she said. "I am very
  sorry for all this trouble, but there was no other way. I want you to read
  that letter."</p>

  <p>With unsteady fingers Brentwood opened it. He glanced down the shaky
  characters, then he burst out suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he cried. "In the name of Heaven what's happened?
  Apparently this is a confession from Plunkett that he murdered your brother
  for the sake of the play, and got away safely with it. Ah, I begin to
  understand. You are in this, Ayres, I suppose? Then the scene we have just
  witnessed is real? The crime has been reconstructed on the spot. I take it
  that we have been witnessing the crime over again in your brother's cottage,
  Miss de Montfort? But why, why all this elaboration? Why did you not come
  forward and make your accusation openly? And what&mdash;what are we going to
  do? What am I to tell the audience?"</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," Cecile said. "And, believe me, Mr. Brentwood, there
  was no other way, or assuredly I would have taken it. And as to your
  audience&mdash;"</p>

  <p>From somewhere in the back of the theatre there came a dull, sullen sound
  that drove the blood from the manager's cheeks and froze him for a moment as
  he stood there. Then he broke away and hurried headlong down the corridor in
  the direction of the dressing-rooms. There was a murmur of broken
  conversation in the distance, and presently the flutter of the curtain as
  Brentwood, white as the shirt on his breast, stood in front of his audience
  and made an announcement.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, in a voice that barely reached the
  gallery. "A most terrible thing has happened. The performance must come to an
  end. With deep regret I have to tell you that the body of Mr. Raynor Plunkett
  has just been found in his dressing-room. There is not the slightest doubt
  that the unfortunate gentleman committed suicide. There is a painful story
  attached to the rash act which I cannot go into now, but which you will
  probably learn all about in due course. I must therefore ask you to leave the
  theatre."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE usual placid smile was on Denny's face as he crossed the
  prison yard on his way to the cook house for the inevitable matutinal bread
  and butter and cocoa. Denny had come to Kingstown two years ago, and from the
  first had established himself as the prime favourite with his gaolers. He was
  always cheerful and always willing, and any man more unlike the fruit of the
  gallows it would have been hard to imagine. And yet Denny's escape from the
  supreme penalty had been a narrow one indeed. There was little doubt of the
  fact that it was his hand that had dealt the fatal blow in that wild poaching
  affray on the edge of Hoxton Moor, but there was just a doubt, and the
  sympathetic jury had given Denny the benefit of it. At that critical moment
  Denny's perennial smile had stood him in good stead. It was impossible to
  believe that a man looking so innocent and guileless could have been guilty
  of a cruel murder. So the jury had called it manslaughter&mdash;to the great
  annoyance of Mr. Justice Savory&mdash;and the latter had grimly complimented
  the prisoner on his escape, and had let him off with the comparatively light
  sentence of three years' penal servitude.</p>

  <p>Denny smiled as he heard the sentence, smiled as he left the Court, but
  his heart was full of tears and the misery of it bore him down and
  overwhelmed him. He had never meant to injure the keeper, he had been
  standing on the defence with his back to a dry ditch grimly resolved to see
  the thing through, and it was a pure misfortune that John Stokes had run in
  just in time to get the butt of the gun crashing down on his head. Up to that
  moment Denny had never been in trouble. He was a hard-working farmer doing
  his best to scratch a living from a few acres of sour moorland, and naturally
  enough a man must have his recreations; and poaching happened to be the
  outstanding passion of Denny's life. It was common knowledge that up to that
  dreadful night no keeper had ever laid Denny by the heels, and no successful
  charge had ever been made against him.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">ANOTHER three months now and there would be an end of it.
  When the order for release came, the leaves would be falling and the Autumn
  gold, burnished and shining, would be hanging in gleaming banners on the
  woodsides. Sometimes as Denny worked he could hear the cock pheasants
  challenging in the spinneys, and only yesterday he had found a covey of
  partridges in a ferny hollow. The smile died from his face for a moment and
  something caught him by the throat and filled his eyes with tears. At that
  moment the temptation to make a dash for liberty was strong upon him. He knew
  every inch of the country for miles around, knew where he could find food and
  shelter. All he needed was a box of matches and a loaf of bread, and for the
  rest nothing mattered. It would be glorious to have a few days' liberty, a
  few hours on the tors where the biggest trout lay, and where Denny had hidden
  his tackle ages ago ready for the next expedition on his lordship's preserved
  water. But this would only mean the freedom of the woods for an all too brief
  space, and the loss of the remission of sentence which good conduct and that
  perennial smile had won for the prisoner.</p>

  <p>So Denny put the temptation from mind and the next morning there came the
  letter which was the cause of all the mischief. It was a letter from a girl,
  of course, and as Denny read it in the seclusion of his cell his face grew
  hard, and there was on his brow a frown as black as night. He went about his
  appointed task for the rest of the day with the ghost of a smile, and before
  he slept that night he had made up his mind.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">IT was a misty morning, grey and gloomy, and the lights were
  still burning in the prison as he crossed to the cook house to draw his
  rations. He turned abruptly to the right and made for the high wall round the
  yard beyond which the misty moor and liberty lay. In an angle of the yard
  some repairs had been going on, and here and there a heap of stones ready to
  his hand. He whipped off his coat and unwound from his body a rope
  constructed from his torn sheets, one end of which he tied around one of the
  stones, and, exerting all his strength, threw it over the wall. With his
  light weight he was confident that the big stone would afford sufficient
  resistance for him to reach the coping. It was just touch and go for a
  moment, but the stone dangling over the top held firmly, and a few seconds
  later Denny was speeding across the moor in the direction of the tors.</p>

  <p>He ran on smoothly and easily, full of the joy of life, the keen air
  filling his lungs like champagne. He knew exactly where to go; the precise
  direction in which to turn, so that when the prison bell clanged harshly
  through the unbroken silence, he smiled with the air of one well
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>And Denny had no illusions. With the best of luck on his side he could not
  hope to be a free man more than a few days. Still, he could accomplish a good
  deal in that time. The first thing he had to do was to provide himself with
  suitable clothing, and here was the hut of Joe Braund, the shepherd, all
  ready for the purpose. He and old Joe had shot many a pheasant together, but
  when Joe heard the news and subsequently found an old coat and pair of
  trousers missing&mdash;well, Joe would know how to be silent.</p>

  <p>It was past 10 before Denny had finished his breakfast. He had borrowed
  some bread and a box of matches, and with the aid of his fishing tackle had
  caught a brace of his lordship's trout, and had cooked them over a dry wood
  fire. Then he lay down like a dog in the sweet-smelling bracken and slept for
  hours.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">THE light was failing in the western sky as he woke and
  turned his steps in the direction of a cluster of twinkling lights which he
  knew outlined the little hamlet of Weston. He skirted the village cautiously
  until he came to a cottage lying back in a garden, the door of which was
  open, so that he could see the cheap oil lamp burning smokily on the table.
  As he crept along the flagged pathway he saw that someone was moving inside.
  He saw a girl, tall and slim and dark, oval of face, and looking out through
  a cloud of dusky hair. She was young and straight and vigorous, with a
  suggestion about her that spoke more of the South than the pink and white
  robustness of the typical Devonshire lass. She was distinctly handsome, too,
  in her wild, hawk-like fashion, and Denny drew a long deep breath, as he saw
  her, like some portrait of Rembrandt flashing against the dingy background.
  Assured that there was no one else in the room, Denny stepped quietly inside
  and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The girl turned swiftly, the olive skin grew white, the dark eyes filled
  with the nameless fear.</p>

  <p>"You, you," she gasped. "Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I am," Denny said slowly. "There's no fool like a fool what's lost
  his heart over a woman."</p>

  <p>"If father happens to come back," the girl stammered.</p>

  <p>"Your father will come back when they closes the doors of the Three
  Bells," Denny went on in the same toneless voice. The smile was no longer on
  his face, his eyes were troubled. "Now hearken to me, Meg. When they sent me
  up yonder I was as good as a dead man. Seemed to me as if my life was
  finished. Three years! Three years behind prison bars!"</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">"I'm very sorry, Denny," the girl stammered.</p>

  <p>"Now that's a lie," Denny said stolidly. "You ain't a bit sorry. You've
  got the wrong blood in you, my lass. There never yet was a Vincent, man or
  woman, who cared for anybody but themselves. I suppose you can't help it. I
  knows as you comes from some of them that settled, 'ere back in the days when
  the Armady was wrecked. Your men's 'andsome and your women's beautiful
  enough, and never a heart amongst the lot o' ye. Yet I was fool enough to
  think you was different to the rest. It's nigh on three years now since I put
  my arm round you and kissed you, and you swore as 'ow you was the 'appiest
  girl in Devonshire. And I believed you. I wouldn't listen when they told me
  that behind my back you was carrying on with that lily-livered John Glass.
  Curse his pretty face and them taking ways of 'is. And when the trouble came,
  you swore that you would wait for me, and be my wife when I was free again.
  And now you are going to marry John Glass tomorrow. Is it really true, or
  have I been misinformed?"</p>

  <p>"Who told you?" the girl asked unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it matters," Denny said. "We get letters in prison
  sometimes, but you seem to have forgotten it. Anyway, not one line 'ave I 'ad
  from you all the time. 'Ere, what are ye goin' to do? I don't leave the
  cottage, nor you neither, till I've finished what I've got to say. A friend
  wrote and told me all about this thing. You're not worth a thought, you and
  this new man of yours, but because I've suffered and know what it
  is&mdash;well, you wouldn't understand that. Before they put me away I showed
  you where my money was. I showed you over a hundred pound, hard earned in
  sweat and toil, and that was to make a home for us when my time was up. Many
  a bitter night have I been cheered by the thought of that. Little did I think
  that you had taken my savings and bought yourself and that scamp Glass your
  outfits for Canada and your passages. Don't say a word to me. Where else did
  the money come from? Glass hasn't a penny, nor you. And you thought I should
  know nothing of this till I came out of prison. Do you know why I am here
  now? Can you guess?"</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">THE girl shook her head slowly. She stood there by the side
  of the table, breathing fiercely: her lips parted with a fear that was beyond
  all disguising. What was this man going to do to her, she wondered. He had
  altered strangely since she had last seen him; he was hard and haggard, and
  the prison taint was plainly to be seen. There was blood on his hands still;
  would there be blood on his hands again before he had finished with her? For
  all that he had said was true. In the days gone by she had been flattered by
  his attentions, she had flaunted Denny before the other girls in the village,
  she had succeeded where most of them had failed. And from the moment that the
  prison doors had closed upon him she had never given him another thought. She
  had never lacked admirers, and, in any case, there was always John Glass to
  fall back on. Then the temptation had come to her, and she had taken Denny's
  money from its hiding-place. She was going to marry Glass on the morrow, and
  long before Denny was free she and her husband would be thousands of miles
  away. Not in her wildest dreams had she anticipated such a crisis as this. It
  had not seemed possible for Denny to find out how he had been betrayed.</p>

  <p>"You've got no proof of this," she said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"What more proof do I want?" Denny demanded. "You couldn't marry Glass
  without money. Neither of you ever earned a penny in your lives. And when
  Ada&mdash;I mean my friend, wrote and told me the news, it didn't take much
  brains to see where the money came from."</p>

  <p>"So that's where you got it from?" she cried. "Ada Knott wrote and told
  you. The white-faced cat, the jealous little fool! So that's how the silly
  little doll took her revenge on me?"</p>

  <p>"She's a good girl, and always was," Denny said stolidly. "And so you are
  conceited enough to think that she is jealous of you. Why, she could have
  Glass a score of times if she had minded."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't talking about John," she cried. "It was you that Ada Knott was
  after. She used to cry her eyes out when first we took to walking together. I
  could see what was the matter when she came whining up to me and wished me
  'appiness. Couldn't keep her voice steady 'ardly. Everybody in the village
  knew it except you."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">A dull red rose to Denny's cheeks.</p>

  <p>All this was as if the girl had suddenly struck him a blow. It was very
  much like a flash of lightning in a dark place when a solitary wayfarer sees
  danger in his path. A score of forgotten incidents grew clear and luminous in
  Denny's mind. And there had been a time when he and Ada Knott&mdash;but he
  did not want to speak about that now. Nor could he believe for a moment that
  the letter he had received was dictated by any feeling of petty jealousy.</p>

  <p>"I ain't goin' to argue this with you," he said. "There are lots of things
  that you can't understand. And now let's have the truth. I want to know just
  what you've done with my money?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head sullenly.</p>

  <p>"You've got no money," she said. "Never 'ad none. Who's going to believe a
  story told by a gaol bird? Don't you come 'ere threatening me. Don't you dare
  to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The money was in notes," Denny went on quietly. "Bank of England notes,
  they was, and I took 'em out myself when there was all that talk about
  Luker's Bank down to Oakleigh. Manager said I was a fule for takin' 'em. Like
  as not they'd be stolen from the cottage. So e' takes the numbers of the
  notes and enters them in a little book. It ain't my word as you're up
  against, Meg. And now, what have you two done with my money?"</p>

  <p>The girl turned a little white about the lips. She was frightened now; the
  terror in her eyes leapt out, and Denny saw it. But there was no triumph in
  his face, nothing but a gentle melancholy bred of some vague intangible
  regret.</p>

  <p>"You'd never charge us, Denny?" the girl asked. "The money was no use to
  you; besides, I'm sick and tired of this place. And there's always a chance
  out there in Canady."</p>

  <p>"Not for the likes of John Glass," Denny said. "Seems to me as I'm getting
  my revenge later on all right. I suppose you spent it all? Not a penny of it
  left?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to take it," the girl said hoarsely. "After I told Glass he
  never let me rest. And I did want to get away so bad. Hark, there's somebody
  outside. I'll pull down the blind. You mustn't be seen here, Denny. I'll get
  you away."</p>

  <p>"You won't do nothing of the sort," Denny said doggedly. "I know that step
  anywhere. Many a night when we've been lying out in a dry ditch waiting for
  the moon to go down&mdash;Come in, John. You didn't expect to see me here
  tonight."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">A slim weed of a man came jauntily into the room, and Denny
  caught him by the shoulder. The easy smile died away from the newcomer's
  lips, the strength seemed to go from his limbs, he dropped into a chair as if
  he had been an empty sack. The red hair plastered in a horrible fringe upon
  his forehead grew damp, the little ferret eyes dilated like those of a cat in
  the dark.</p>

  <p>"My god, it's Denny," he faltered. "Denny come back to life again.
  What&mdash;what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I came here to kill you," he said slowly. "I knew as how I should find
  you here, you two together, and I promised myself&mdash;well, never mind what
  I promised myself. And now we are face to face I can't do it. It isn't as if
  you was a right and proper man, John Glass. You're just a miserable rat of a
  chap, just a boasting coward and no more. Funny thing to me that any woman
  can see anything in a bloke like you. Call yourself a poacher. Oh, yes, you
  used to come with us sometimes, but you always took good care to keep out of
  harm's way. And when there was a chance of trouble, you showed the white
  feather, and went whining to his lordship for mercy. It was you as put the
  keepers on us that night; but for you I should be a free man at this moment.
  Oh, I know all about it. I knew all about it at the time of the trial. And
  one of the luxuries I promised myself then was the leathering I was going to
  give you when I was a free man again. And now some'ow I can't do it. It would
  be almost as bad as 'itting a woman. Still, there be other ways. I could send
  you to jail if I 'ad a mind."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">"You've never gone and told 'im, Meg?" Glass gasped.</p>

  <p>"'Ere, be a man," Meg cried contemptuously. "I didn't tell 'im; 'e knew
  all about it when 'e came. And 'e says the bank manager over at Oakleigh 'as
  got the number of the notes. Might just as well own up. Besides, 'e can't do
  nothing. 'E'll be back in jail within a week."</p>

  <p>There was something almost fine in this hard, shameless taunt. Whatever
  the man might feel, the woman was utterly unconcerned. Denny looked at her
  with a certain contempt for his own past blindness.</p>

  <p>This creature was the woman he had wanted to marry! For the love of her he
  had seen red, in his desire for her, and his rage against the other man he
  had broken prison deliberately, full well knowing what the consequences might
  be. And now it suddenly dawned upon him that the beauty whom he had idealised
  was no more than a village slut, and a bold, black-eyed wench, too lazy to
  keep clean and too selfish to care for aught but herself. The anger and
  contempt and self-pity were fading from Denny's heart now as these truths
  dawned upon him.</p>

  <p>"I told you what I come 'ere tonight for," he said. "Leastwise, what I
  thought I 'ad come for. I said as 'ow I was sure of findin' Glass 'ere, and
  it were my intent to kill 'im. And now I knows as I was altogether wrong.
  Stand up, John Glass, and face me like a man if you can."</p>

  <p>Glass scrambled to his feet shamefacedly.</p>

  <p>"I b'aint afraid of you," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," Denny went on with the same even tone. "You'm in such a
  mortal fear that you can't stand upright. And yet there's no cause for
  nothing of the kind. You can say, if you like, as I come 'ere tonight to say
  good-bye to two old friends, and wish 'em 'appiness in the new sphere which
  it pleases Providence to call 'em. I learned that from a sermon what the
  chaplain preached in the chapel last Sunday, and I've learnt lots of things
  that you wouldn't understand. But that isn't what I meant to say. I come 'ere
  to wish you 'appiness and make you a little present. I've got a 'undred
  pounds 'idden away, and Meg knows where to find it. That's my wedding present
  to you, and if you give me a pen and a bit of paper, I'll put it down in
  writing. I don't want no gossip in the village, I don't want it said
  afterwards as 'ow you two went off with something that didn't belong to you.
  You can just show that paper to anyone you like. It won't matter nothing to
  me, because when my time's up I'm going to Canady too. I dare say when I sell
  up my few sticks I shall have enough to take me out yonder. Now then, what
  about that bit o' paper?"</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">A sullen flush rose to the girl's face, for Denny had
  penetrated her armour of callous selfishness at last. It was only just for a
  moment she was touched, only just for a moment she hesitated between
  admiration for Denny's generosity and an innate conviction that he was a born
  fool. There could be no gratitude either, seeing that the gift had already
  been spent. Without a word she produced a scrap of paper and a rusty pen. The
  suspicion of a smile flickered on her lips as she watched Denny's laborious
  attempt at composition. He placed his head on one side, and regarded his
  handiwork with pardonable pride.</p>

  <p>"I think that's all right," he said. "No; I don't want no thanks. There'll
  be children presently, and it's just as well as they shan't have a' couple of
  thieves for their parents. And now I'll be off."</p>

  <p>Without waiting for another word he turned and left the cottage and walked
  boldly out into the night. He no longer skirted along under cover of the
  darkness, no longer bore himself like a hunted creature flying from justice,
  for he had done his work, and was not afraid. As he reached the turn of the
  road a figure came out from the woodside and a hand was timidly laid on his
  arm. In the pallid moonlight he saw a pretty, anxious face and a pair of blue
  eyes all swimming with tears.</p>

  <p>"So it's you, Ada?" he said. "It's good of you to stop and speak to the
  likes of me. If I hadn't been a fool&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, for something seemed to catch him by the throat and choke him.
  He was standing in the centre of one of those blinding illuminating flashes
  again. And when the sear of the lightning had passed, it had fused upon his
  soul the lasting knowledge that this was the girl he had always loved, and
  that the other thing had been a mere obsession. He held out his hands
  unsteadily.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">"OH, my dear, my dear," he said. "If I'd only&mdash;but it's
  no use to talk of that now. It was good of you to send me that letter. But
  'ow did you 'appen to know as I was 'ere?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you creeping up to the cottage," the girl exclaimed. "And then I
  knew who the escaped convict was. And all this because I sent you that
  letter. I always knew as you cared for 'er, Denny, always felt as you would
  go through fire and water for 'er. And she's not worth the love of any man.
  And that's why I wrote you the letter. I knew your time was getting near, but
  I didn't want you to feel the cruel disappointment when you came out. And now
  you've learnt the truth from them two, and it does my 'eart good to see as
  'ow you've taken it like a man. If you will try in time to forget
  'er&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"It's done already," Denny said simply. "I come 'ere tonight to make them
  two a wedding present, and wish 'em good luck. And I don't want ever to see
  neither of them again. And I don't love Meg Vincent, and I never did. And the
  strange thing is that I didn't know it till an hour ago. You learns lots of
  things in prison, my dear, but I ain't got no time to tell you about them
  now. If you don't mind walking down the road a little way with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Down the road?" the girl gasped. "Why, there's two warders hiding in the
  plantation, Denny."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, lass," Denny said easily. "I don't mind 'em now. And
  you jest listen to me. I ain't blind any longer. Ada, tell me the truth.
  Could you love me and be my wife later on if so be as I could prove to
  you&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">"OH, you know, you know," the girl whispered. "All the
  village knew. And you're a good man, Denny, in spite of it all. Let us turn
  back. I dare say I could manage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Denny drew her to his side and kissed her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"It can't be done that way, dear," he said. "Now I tell you that many
  things are to be learnt in prison, and in my spare time I've read more books
  than I ever read in my life before. And the books I have studied most are
  those about Canady. And that's where we're going later on, my dear. When the
  time comes I'll sell everything, and we'll face the new world together."</p>

  <p>"I'd want no better happiness," the girl said. "And I've got a bit of
  money saved too. If you can only get away into some hiding place till they
  forget."</p>

  <p>"It can't be done that way," Denny said. "I'm going back again, girlie.
  I'm going to see it out; I'll not cross the water till I can go as a free
  man. Now dry your eyes, and kiss me, and let me go. And remember that by the
  time the swallows are here again&mdash;Goodbye."</p>

  <p>He gently drew her arms from about his neck, and then, without another
  word, with head erect and swinging step, strode off down the hill to the spot
  where he knew the warders were awaiting him.</p><br>

     name="story4">4.&mdash;THE BIG THING</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY A. GILBERT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XLIX, Dec 1918-May 1919,
  pp 237-243</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE rime on the bracken and heather, that a few minutes ago
  had been one sparkle of gems in the sunshine, was now no more than a dripping
  mist. The wind had suddenly swung round to the north-east, so that, with the
  cooling of the atmosphere, a thick blanket of fog came over Dartmoor with the
  suddenness of a dream. One moment brilliant sunshine and the vivid joy of a
  great September day, and the next blankness and desolation everywhere. Here
  and there a figure loomed gigantic out of the yellow atmosphere, and the
  armed guards of the convict gang moved uneasily from spot to spot, for this
  fog was a thing to be dreaded when it was impossible to see half a dozen
  yards ahead.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later two figures crept along a dry watercourse, with their
  faces turned towards the open moor. They moved not with hesitation nor the
  uncertainty of the future, but with bold yet cautious strides of men who knew
  every inch of the ground, as indeed they did. If the fog only held for a
  quarter of an hour, they might be beyond the reach of their guard for many a
  day to come. And it was for this that George Shenstone had been waiting all
  through those hot summer months.</p>

  <p>There came a time presently when the fog lifted a little, and down there
  in the valley they could hear the shrill sound of whistles and presently the
  dull report of a rifle. Shenstone smiled grimly to himself as he turned to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that, Dan?" he asked. "They've found out. But they haven't
  got us yet. It'll be our own fault if they see anything of us for the next
  week."</p>

  <p>This was no idle boast on Shenstone's part, for he had been born and bred
  on the edge of the moor, over there in the little market town of Helsmere,
  and there was not one yard of the moor that he did not know as well as be
  knew the palm of his own hand. In early boyhood he had bird's nested there,
  he had fished in the rivers, and, later on, had hunted with two packs of
  hounds from the sea right away to Tor Point. It had been his boast that he
  could find his way about Dartmoor blindfold, and that was really no figure of
  speech.</p>

  <p>He was a lover of the country and a sportsman to his finger-tips, an
  outdoor man, if ever there was one, with the joy of life tingling in his
  veins and a love of the deep-red Devonshire earth which was to him something
  like a religion&mdash;the sort of man who, despite his recklessness and
  strength of character, would have pined and died in the close confinement of
  a city street.</p>

  <p>And yet, with all this, with all the advantage of birth and money and the
  ownership of Shenstone's Bank, he had fallen, and now, by the irony of Fate,
  found himself a prisoner on the very ground that he had roamed a free man
  since boyhood.</p>

  <p>They came presently to what, in the winter, had been a waterfall up there
  on the top of the tors. The mist had cleared a little now in the fitful,
  shifty way of Dartmoor fog, so that from their hiding-place behind the bushes
  they could look down into the valley below, with the big convict settlement
  in the distance. It was possible for anyone who knew the way to climb up the
  almost perpendicular face of the cliff without being followed, or, indeed,
  without anybody dreaming that they had come that way. It was a hiding-place
  in a hundred, where, given food and clothing, they might lie secure for
  weeks. And Shenstone had found this himself many years ago, when he had come
  that way in search of the nest of some rare bird that dwelt there.</p>

  <p>Back in the hollow of the rocks was a packet of food, together with a
  bottle or two and some cigarettes. One of these latter Shenstone lighted, and
  lay back, inhaling the tobacco with a sense of luxury that he had not
  experienced since he stood face to face with the judge six months ago in the
  Assize Court at Exeter. The other man sat at his feet, smoking likewise.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's good!" Shenstone said, drawing a deep breath. "This first
  taste of luxury likes me well, Dan. Ah, what a thing it is to be free once
  more!"</p>

  <p>"I am glad for your sake, Mr. George," Dan Mavis said.</p>

  <p>"You always were a faithful creature, Dan. Did it ever occur to you that
  if I hadn't been a fool, or something worse, you would be a free man to-day?
  It was all wrong, Dan. You weren't any more to blame than a child. You only
  did what I told you to do, because the Mavises have always done what the
  Shenstones told them. You ought to hate me, Dan."</p>

  <p>"I don't feel like that, sir, somehow," the ex-bank clerk said. "Don't you
  trouble about me, Mr. George. What are you going to do? It doesn't much
  matter whether they get me again or not, but you'd die yonder. Either you'd
  die or you'd break out into one of those passions of yours and kill one of
  those warders. I know you would&mdash;it was always your way. You let me go
  and find Mr. Boyden. I'll manage it all right. I can get along after dark,
  and I dare say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's not the idea at all, Dan," Shenstone said. "I haven't been
  plotting and scheming all these months for that. I dare say you think you
  know all about it, but you don't. I have been thinking, Dan, which is a thing
  that my old father told me I never did. In that stuffy little cell of mine
  I've been thinking a lot lately. I am not going to say that I did wrong, and
  I am not going to say that I am sorry, but I am. It was a great big chance,
  and I took it because I could see my way out. I wasn't satisfied with being
  comfortably off, Dan; I wanted to be rich, not for my own sake, but for the
  sake of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mavis nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I know, sir," he said&mdash;"for the sake of a girl. We are all like that
  at times, sir, though I am sure that Miss Revel&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir.
  I ought not to have mentioned her name."</p>

  <p>"Well, why not?" Shenstone asked. "It's the truth. I wanted her to care
  for me. By Heavens, I believe she did at one time, before Ralph Pentyre came
  home. And because I wanted to show those two what I could do I went mad. I
  took my clients' money and my own, and I speculated with it. And when the
  crash came I ruined those who trusted me, and, what was worse, I ruined you
  and others in my employ who simply did what they were told because a
  Shenstone said it. And that wasn't the worst, Dan&mdash;I dragged Pentyre
  into it, too. I wanted to ruin him, I wanted to see him in the dock, I wanted
  him to suffer as I was suffering. I see how wrong it all was now; but the
  mischief's done, and when those officials from the Board of Trade come to
  investigate matters further, it's as sure as there is a sky above us that
  Ralph Pentyre will have to stand his trial, too. Of course, it wasn't his
  fault that he inherited from his father the post of trustee to Shenstone's
  Bank, but the fact remains that he is trustee, and that he signed every
  document I put before him without looking at it. He trusted me, Dan&mdash;he
  trusted me because I was a Shenstone, and because he had faith in my word,
  and I betrayed him deliberately, like the dog that I am."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, sir," Mavis cried, "it isn't as bad as all that! Why did you do
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, because I was mad," Shenstone said&mdash;"mad with love for a girl
  who would not look at me. No, that isn't true, Dan. She was always sweet and
  kind and gentle, but she didn't love me, and I ought to have faced my trouble
  like a man. I didn't. I speculated wildly with the money of the bank and the
  money of clients. I was going to be a millionaire and dazzle Maud Revel with
  my riches. Ah, I wonder how many fools have thought the same thing! But I
  wasn't content with that. When I saw how things were going, all that was bad
  in my nature came out, and, like a dog in the manger, I resolved that, as
  Maud Revel was beyond my reach, I would drag down Pentyre in the ruin and
  disgrace him too. Neither of them know what is hanging over his head yet, but
  it's coming, and before long Pentyre will wear a uniform with a number, like
  you and me. Ah, my faithful Dan, you never guessed this, did you? You sit
  there without a frown on your face, thinking about nothing but the honour of
  the Shenstones and the safety of the man who degraded it. You don't even
  blame me for bringing you to this pass. You don't even ask me why we are here
  and what is going to happen to us."</p>

  <p>"That's all in your hands, Mr. George," Mavis said easily. "I am trusting
  you. I suppose it was Mr. Boyden who brought these things here for us. He is
  coming to see us presently and arrange for our escape."</p>

  <p>Shenstone shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, Dan, nothing of the kind," he said. "I only brought
  you here for the sake of companionship and so that I might have a chance to
  explain to you exactly how things stood. I wanted you to know everything. Now
  listen. I have got something to do, a big thing, the really big thing that
  every man has to face once in his lifetime. It's the only chance I have of
  showing the world&mdash;or, at least, that portion of it that concerns
  me&mdash;that I am not utterly vile. I have been planning it for weeks, Dan.
  I knew that the fog must come some time, and I knew that when it did, with my
  knowledge of the moor, I could get away with the greatest of ease. And I
  wanted you to come along with me in case anything went wrong. But I am going
  back again."</p>

  <p>"Back there?" Mavis cried. "Back into the settlement? No, no, Mr. George,
  you mustn't do it! It was killing you. Ah, if you could only realise what six
  months there has done for you!"</p>

  <p>"I do," Shenstone said grimly; "I can feel it in my bones. Ah, only a man
  who has been brought up in the open air, the man who thrives on the smell of
  the good red earth, and knows the joy of the saddle, can tell what I have
  suffered. Three months ago it was all different. Three months ago I was
  planning my escape&mdash;aye, and I could have managed it, too&mdash;for my
  own sake alone. And because I realised what the torture and agony of it is, I
  can feel for others. Heavens, it's bad enough to suffer as I do, knowing
  myself to be guilty, but if I'd been an innocent man, I should have gone mad.
  I should have murdered one of those warders, as you suggest, for the sake of
  being hanged and thus get out of my misery. But I see things from a different
  angle now, Dan. I am going to stick it, my boy&mdash;I am going to stick it
  for the next two years&mdash;and then, when I have earned my freedom, I am
  going abroad to try and build up again what I have lost, and you are coming
  with me, old boy. I want you, Dan. For a hundred and fifty years the Mavises
  have served the Shenstones, and I can't break all the old links."</p>

  <p>Mavis shook his head gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I don't, like it, Mr. George, I don't like it a bit," he said. "Here we
  are, free, and Mr. Boyden will do anything for us. And why didn't you
  write?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't," Shenstone said thoughtfully. "Any letter of mine would have
  been read by the Governor, and my explanation would have implicated still
  more people who at present are quite free. No, I must do it myself, Dan, and
  I must do it to-night. I must face people who will regard me coldly and
  scornfully, but it must be done. Now, I want you to stay here&mdash;stay here
  till I come back. It may be in a couple of hours, and it may not be before
  morning. But rest assured that I shall come back, and then to-morrow we can
  join our gang as if nothing had happened. We can tell them that we lost our
  way in the fog, or something of that sort. So long as we give ourselves up,
  there is not much chance of punishment. Now, you just curl yourself up here
  and smoke these cigarettes while you have got a chance. Don't you worry about
  me."</p>

  <p>The fog had fallen again now, and lay in thick folds over the hillsides
  and valleys, as Shenstone climbed out of his hiding-place and made his way
  cautiously across the heather and the bracken, with his face turned towards
  the town of Helsmere, some seven miles away. There was no occasion for him to
  expose himself or to feel his way, for that was quite familiar to him. Here
  was a deep tussock of gorse and bracken where he had found his first
  night-jar's nest, and a little further on a threadlike stream where he had
  hunted down the home of a pair of ring-ousels, and yet a little further down
  the stream, under a shelving bank, the spot where he, together with two
  terriers of his, had killed an otter. Every bush and bramble seemed to hold
  some memory, the scent of the earth was in his nostrils now as he pressed
  eagerly forward with the air of a man who knows exactly where he is
  going.</p>

  <p>But there were open spots here and there on the higher ground, where the
  wide sheets of heather afforded no cover for anything bigger than a bird, and
  here he had to move cautiously, in case the fog should lift and he stood
  exposed against the hillside to those lynx eyes watching in the valley. It
  was nearly dusk before he reached the outskirts of the town. Then he made his
  way through a wood and thence past a thick shrubbery that opened on to a wide
  lawn in front of a long, low, white house that gleamed pale and ghostly
  through the mist of the falling night. On the edge of the lawn was the empty
  basin of a fountain, into which Shenstone crept, and there he lay hidden
  until the night fell at length and the windows in front of him turned to
  squares of yellow flame.</p>

  <p>Three of those windows were open to the lawn, and in one of them, by some
  oversight, probably, the blind had not been drawn. And presently from the
  open windows came the sound of music. Somebody was playing some soft and
  dreamy melody that carried familiarly to Shenstone's ears and brought a mist
  into his eyes. He dashed it away angrily, for it was not time for sentiment.
  He listened acutely for sign or sound or movement, then, feeling that all was
  safe, he crept out of his hiding-place and moved swiftly across the
  dew-drenched lawn until he stood under the shadow of the lighted windows.
  From his hiding-place he looked into a room that was as familiar to him as
  the moor and the trout stream outside.</p>

  <p>He noted the long low room with the old panelled walls and the old
  mezzotints, the pictures mellowed by the hand of Time, and, above all, the
  dainty suggestion of the feminine spirit there in the shape of the flowers in
  the vases, the music littered on the piano, and the thousand and one odds and
  ends that go to make up all the difference between a house and a home.</p>

  <p>As Shenstone stood there, the player rose from the piano and crossed the
  room, so that she was almost near enough for him to touch. He could see into
  the violet depths of her eyes could see the clear-cut pallor of her cheeks
  and the drooping expression of trouble on her lips. She moved, unconscious of
  his presence, towards a little alcove by one of the windows, as if seeking
  for something; then it seemed to Shenstone that he could hear the quick
  ripple of a telephone bell.</p>

  <p>But for the moment that was not troubling him. He was watching the slim
  figure in its simple evening-dress with all his heart in his eyes. He was
  trying to recall the last time he had looked into that room, not as a
  fugitive from justice, but as an honoured guest and a welcome companion. For
  he had been there more times than he could think. He could picture the
  ancient dining-room across the hall, where he had always been sure of a warm
  greeting from that genial host of his, and a meal at any time he cared to
  drop in. And there had been many meals there&mdash;hunting breakfasts in the
  early dawn, lunch after a morning's shoot, and cheery dinners where all the
  county was only too glad to see a Shenstone sitting amongst them.</p>

  <p>And all this he had lost&mdash;deliberately thrown away in that vain
  pursuit of wealth which had been the ruin of so many. Never more would he sit
  there amongst his peers, never more would he take those slim fingers in his
  and see the light of welcome in Maud Revel's shining eyes. Just for a moment
  he had half a mind to turn back and renounce all those aspirations of his. He
  stood there, afraid to meet the girl, or afraid of what she might say, and
  most of all afraid of the contempt and scorn that he was about to waken in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>Then the telephone in the alcove rang again, and the girl took down the
  receiver. Shenstone could plainly see the expression on her face as she
  listened to the voice at the other end of the wire. And he knew a moment
  later that she was talking to the very man whom at one time he had been
  pleased to regard as the source of all the mischief. He ought not to have
  listened, perhaps, but it seemed to him that he had a sufficiently good
  excuse, so he stood there, watching the girl at the telephone, noting every
  change in her face and the expressions that fleeted across it as shadows flit
  across an autumn moor.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she was saying. "You are talking to her. I am Maud. Is that
  you, Ralph? I am so glad. I have been waiting anxiously to hear from you for
  hours. What's that? Oh, you have just got back. Never mind about that.. .. Is
  that true?.. .. Oh, it can't be! I won't believe it.. .. Yes. What&mdash;you
  of all men? It's preposterous, Ralph.. .. Certainly. Of course I believe you.
  My dear boy, I should believe you if you stood in the dock and all the world
  gave evidence against you. I only heard this afternoon, and you can imagine
  the shock it was to me. What's that you say? The line is not very good. Yes,
  I think you'd better. At once. Yes, as soon as you like. I am quite alone
  here, because father is dining out. Oh, do come! A quarter of an hour. Come
  straight into the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>Shenstone stood listening out there, following this conversation easily
  enough. There was no reason for anyone to tell him that Maud Revel was
  talking to his rival, and that the blow had fallen like a bolt from the blue
  when it had been least expected. Evidently things had been moving rapidly
  lately. Those investigations had been made, and there was no time to be lost
  now if the big thing was to be done and Pentyre's reputation cleared. And as
  Shenstone looked into the eyes of the girl standing there, he knew well
  enough that, if anything happened to Pentyre, the light of happiness would
  never shine in them again. He took a step forward and walked through the
  window into the room.</p>

  <p>He stood there before the girl, a somewhat gaunt and haggard figure, with
  his prison clothes about him and a certain dogged recklessness on his
  face.</p>

    <img src="1301071h-images/TheBigThing.jpg"
         title="Then their eyes met, and the girl started back.">
  </div><br>

  <p>It was a vivid contrast indeed between the convict in his dingy suit and
  the slim figure in black, with not one single ornament to relieve it. Then
  their eyes met, and the girl started back as if she had seen a ghost.</p>

  <p>"George!" she cried. "George!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's I right enough," Shenstone said. "I wondered if you would
  recognise me."</p>

  <p>"You must go away," the girl said. "Go away at once! We heard an hour or
  two ago that there had been an escape, but we did not dream that it was you.
  They have been here already."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really," Shenstone said. "They haven't lost any time. I suppose they
  calculated that I should make for a familiar hiding-place, as the fox does
  when the hounds are after him. Well, for once they were right. But all the
  warders in Dartmoor would never guess what brings me here to-night."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come?" Maud asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, shall we call it pride? Honour, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Pride and honour!" the girl echoed.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? Even a convict may possess some of both. Now, listen to
  me, Maud. Perhaps I ought not to call you that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, call me what you like," the girl said. "You are in danger. Let me
  help you."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I expected to hear you talk like that," Shenstone said. "But no one
  can help me now except yourself. Were you talking to Pentyre on the telephone
  just now?"</p>

  <p>"I was," Maud said somewhat coldly.</p>

  <p>"I thought so. I listened to that conversation. So it is all out at last,
  and there is every chance of Pentyre standing where I stood six months ago.
  There is no escape for him unless&mdash;well, we'll come to that presently.
  His father trusted me and he trusted me, and I betrayed them both. And yet it
  is in my power to say the word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, I understand," Maud said swiftly. "It has all come to me in a flash.
  George, why did you do this thing?"</p>

  <p>"I think you know," Shenstone said quietly. "They say that every girl
  knows when a man is in love with her."</p>

  <p>The girl bowed her head and her face flushed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see you know," Shenstone went on. "And things might have been
  different if Ralph Pentyre had not come back from India. From the day he came
  I saw my hopes fade away, and, because of that, I did wrong. I was going to
  be rich&mdash;so rich that even you would be dazzled. And when I found that
  it was all the dream of a madman, then I resolved that, if I could not make
  you my wife, Pentyre never should. I could see clearly enough that, by
  suppressing certain facts and keeping back certain papers, I could involve
  Pentyre in my ruin, and I did so deliberately."</p>

  <p>Maud Revel started back as if he had struck her.</p>

  <p>"Is this thing really true?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Shenstone went on. "And I did it. And I wasn't sorry,
  either&mdash;at least, not at first. Then, when the horrors of that place
  yonder began to get a grip on me, and I realised what it was for a man who
  loves the open air to be shut up, my point of view changed. I saw what a
  terrible thing it was to drag another man down into the hell that I was
  suffering, and rightly suffering, mind you. So gradually I made up my mind
  that your happiness and Pentyre's honour meant as much to me as freedom
  itself. I would have written had I only dared, but I could not do that, as my
  letter would have involved other people, faithful tools of mine, who ought
  not to suffer for my crime. And so I made up my mind, when the first of the
  fogs came, to escape for a few hours, so that I could come here and, if
  fortune was on my side, tell you what I am telling you now. Tom Boyden is the
  man to go to. He is the one who stuck to me through thick and thin. And he
  has all the papers necessary to clear Pentyre entirely. They are locked up in
  a sealed box which was not to be opened without my consent. Go to Boyden and
  tell him of this interview, and give him my authority to break the seal. The
  documents I speak of are in a blue envelope on the top. All the other papers
  are to be burnt. And I think&mdash;yes, I really think that is about all I
  have to say, Maud. It was a vile thing for me to do, but I have done my best
  to make amends."</p>

  <p>Maud stood there with her hand on her heart, as if some pain was gnawing
  at it. Her face was white and her eyes shone like stars as she faced the man
  in the convict garb.</p>

  <p>"And you have done this for our sakes, George?" she whispered. "That is
  very fine of you."</p>

  <p>"Could I do anything else?" Shenstone asked. "And yet I don't think I
  could have brought myself to do so if they had not made a prisoner of me.
  Every time I looked out and saw the sun on the moor I felt as if I was being
  stifled. And, mind you, I deserved all I got. That was the one reflection
  that kept me sane. But if I had been innocent, as Pentyre is, then, by
  Heavens, I would not have been responsible for what I might have done. Every
  morning that I woke up this thought came back to me, till I could see nothing
  else. I could only picture Pentyre's feelings in my place, and try to imagine
  what you would say or think when you lost the man you loved. And&mdash;oh,
  here I am, a broken convict, trying to do the big thing. Ralph and I in our
  boyhood always used to talk about the big thing, and how we should do it when
  the time came. But we never expected anything like this. It isn't a big
  thing, after all, but in the circumstances the biggest thing that I will do.
  It isn't much, is it?"</p>

  <p>Maud was looking at him now with shining eyes and an unsteady smile about
  her lips.</p>

  <p>"You must leave others to judge that," she said. "I think it is a very big
  thing indeed, not because it affects me and my happiness, but because I know
  that very few men could have done it, and perhaps&mdash;But I won't go into
  that."</p>

  <p>As she spoke the door opened and another man came in. He stood there, in
  the lamp-light, gazing in astonishment at the drab figure in the shadow of
  the window.</p>

  <p>"George!" he cried. "George!"</p>

  <p>"Eh, lad, it's George right enough," Shenstone said quietly.</p>

  <p>"But I did not know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" Shenstone asked. "They are after me, and they may
  be here at any moment now. Sit down, Ralph, and let me tell you the story I
  have just been telling Maud."</p>

  <p>"No, no," Maud cried, "let me tell the story! I must. It's my story as
  much as yours, George, and I shall do it far more justice than you can.
  Listen, Ralph!"</p>

  <p>She told the sequence of events in her own glowing words until she had
  finished at length, so that even Shenstone could see in what light his
  conduct had presented itself to these old friends of his. It was a long time
  before anyone spoke. It was Pentyre who at length broke the silence. With a
  smile on his face and an outstretched hand he reached over to Shenstone.</p>

  <p>"That was a big thing, George," he said&mdash;"a very big thing. I always
  knew you would do it if the time came. And you were never its bad as you made
  yourself out to be. Reckless and headstrong and sanguine to a fault, but
  never really bad. And there's my hand on it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was very fine," Maud said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Shenstone said gruffly. "For Heaven's sake don't
  talk to me like that, you people, or else I shall do something foolish!
  You'll be making me out to be a hero presently. Now, look here, Ralph, get on
  the telephone and call up Devereux at the prison. I am only a number to him
  now, but there was a time, of course, when we dined and hunted and shot
  together, and I don't think he has altogether forgotten it. Tell him I am
  here. Tell him I wandered off a bit in the fog, and that the temptation to
  visit some dear friends of mine was too much for me. Say I am waiting for a
  guard here, and that I am ready to come back as soon as they fetch me. And if
  you want to do something for me, give me a cigarette and a chance to taste a
  decent whisky and soda again. Only, for Heaven's sake, don't be sentimental,
  because to a man in my position that sort of thing hurts like the devil.
  After all, it's only a couple of years I've got to serve, and when I come out
  I know I shall find some friends waiting for me."</p>

  <p>"You will that," Pentyre said heartily.</p>

  <p>Maud made no reply in words, but there was a look on her face and an
  expression in her eyes that was worth all the words in the world to the man
  standing there.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">5.&mdash;THE GREY RAIDER</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Chronicle</i>, Adelaide, Australia, 7 Jun
  1919</h3><br>

  <p class="first">LET it not be imagined by thoughtless readers that the
  Gentle Buccaneers were always splashing about in purple patches. There were
  intervals between lightning streaks of lurid adventure when they sat quietly
  down round their own fireside, so to speak, and occasionally indulged in the
  dubious pleasures of introspection. Now, introspection is not always a
  pleasant thing, even to an amateur pirate, especially if he be connected with
  some ancient family and still bears upon him the rags of tradition as taught
  in English schools and universities. Even if such a man has done something
  which parts him violently and secretly from this native land, he cannot
  altogether forget the playing fields and the covert side and the glamor of
  the river. And some such thoughts as these obsessed Jimmy Graydon, otherwise
  known as Truthful James, as he sat on the deck of the Gehenna with the
  Buccaneers around him. And, sooth to say, Wallace, known as the Brigadier,
  was in somewhat similar case. They were both suffering from what Peter
  Shacklock, otherwise the Prodigal Son, called hobnail conscience, or an
  enlargement of the moral spleen. Anyway, they were a moody crowd, conversing
  fitfully in the absence of Endellion the Skipper, who just then was down
  below in confab with the taciturn individual who was responsible for the
  Gehenna's wireless. This, by-the-way, was something of a new toy, and had
  been installed on the Gehenna after a furtive visit to a nameless port in
  North New Zealand, where Endellion had been in secret conclave for at least
  two days with the officer in command of an English destroyer. What it all
  meant Endellion had not said. There were certain things he kept to himself,
  which is one of the privileges of the commander all the world over.</p>

  <p>For some days now, they had been aimlessly drifting about amongst the
  little group of coral islands, two or three hundred miles away from the usual
  base, and perhaps the slowness of the proceedings had something to do with
  the gloom which had settled upon the Gentle Buccaneers. For a week they had
  enjoyed the inestimable privilege of a lady's company on board, until at
  length they had deported Audrey Lashford and her father in a place of
  comparative safety with a view to conveying them elsewhere as soon as
  circumstances would permit.</p>

  <p>So they were lounging on the deck under the lee of a little island and
  waiting on events. They had been talking in a desultory sort of way for some
  time, and, for the most part, listening to the lamentations of the Brigadier
  with regard to the cruel circumstances that prevented him offering his
  services to a distressed motherland in the hour of her need. For the
  Brigadier received papers from time to time, and, now that their wireless had
  been installed, was not entirely outside the ring of current events.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to be here," the Brigadier said moodily.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it comes to that," said Jimmy Graydon, "neither should any of
  us."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but my case is different," Wallace went on. "I was a gunner,
  remember, and a dashed good officer, too, though I say it as shouldn't. They
  could do with me out in France now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you'd better give yourself up," Shacklock drawled unkindly. "Throw
  yourself on the mercy of the court."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do it," the Brigadier groaned. "They'd know all about me in a
  week. I was wondering if we couldn't help in the great game out here."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure we can't," said Endellion as he came up on deck and
  joined the group. "If I'm right, sonny, you may be able to strike a blow for
  the flag yet."</p>

  <p>The Brigadier's face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Get on with it," he said. "You've got some deep scheme in your mind, I'm
  sure, else you'd never have shoved up that wireless. Now, then, cough it
  up."</p>

  <p>Endellion proceeded to unfold a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," he said. "Here is an old copy of the 'Times,'
  which contains an interesting account of the voyage of a huge German
  submarine called the Deutschland."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that the boat that went to America before we came in?" Shacklock
  asked. "Crossed the Atlantic under water and got back home with a cargo of
  rubber."</p>

  <p>"That's right," Endellion said. "She used to be a pioneer, they were going
  to build a fleet of 'em, and cheat the British blockade that way. Now, this
  Deutschland was never heard of after the return voyage, and when the British
  unofficially claimed to have sunk her the Huns didn't deny it. Because why? I
  think I can tell you. It was all bluff. Germany never expected to feed her
  population by U-boats, however big. Her game was to supply submarines
  thousands of miles from their base with lubricating oils and petrol."</p>

  <p>"I believe that's right," Shacklock said. "Don't you remember that soon
  after the first voyage of the Deutschland certain English vessels were
  torpedoed off the American coast? That was done to get the wind up Uncle Sam.
  But still they did it."</p>

  <p>"You are very bright this afternoon, my worthy prodigal," Endellion
  smiled. "Yes, you've got it. That was a brainy idea. But no one seemed to
  spot it, at least, I thought nobody had till I met that naval acquaintance of
  mine the other day. He told me that the Deutschland was never sunk at all.
  She's knocking about in these seas feeding the U-boats responsible for the
  sinking of shipping in the Bay of Bengal. And somewhere, on one of these
  coral islands here, is a vast store of 'juice' ready for the Deutschland when
  she wants it. And now you understand why I was closeted for two days with a
  certain naval officer and why we had that wireless installed. Boys, the
  Deutschland is not far off, and if we can down her then I reckon we shall
  have struck a blow for the old flag that we can be proud of. What says the
  Brigadier?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Brigadier's willing enough," Wallace replied grimly. "But where,
  precisely, do I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose you can still handle a four-inch gun," Endellion said.
  "Don't forget that we have got a couple on board."</p>

  <p>The Brigadier's eyes lighted up.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten nothing," he said. "I guess I'm as good a shot as ever I
  was. Give me a clear horizon, and the Deutschland, and I'll sink her at four
  miles in as many shots, or for ever hold my peace. Now, then, commodore,
  what's the little scheme?"</p>

  <p>They talked on for an hour or so as they lay in that little bay until
  presently round the headland appeared a rowing boat with four men aboard. It
  was clear that the Gehenna was their destination, for they pulled straight to
  the side and presently two men scrambled on her deck. At the sight of one of
  them Endellion stuck his glass in his eye and for once in his life appeared
  to be almost astonished.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, it's Billy Hutton," he said. "Now what does that infernal
  rascal want here?"</p>

  <p>The big man with the huge black beard came smilingly across the deck in
  Endellion's direction with the air of one who is sure of his welcome, and
  serene in the knowledge that there was no enmity between them.</p>

  <p>"Didn't expect to see me, eh?" he said. "Well, Billy Hutton never bore no
  malice. You downed me in fair fight right enough, and I'm too big a man not
  to admit it."</p>

  <p>"That's very nice of you," Endellion said sweetly. "Now what can I do for
  you, Mr. Hutton?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, we're both Englishmen," Hutton said. "And I thought there
  being a war on, as you might like to help me. That is, me and my friend here.
  Mr. Franks, the great naturalist. Let me introduce him."</p>

  <p>The man called Franks brought his heels together and bowed stiffly from
  the waist. He was of middle age, stiffly built, and looking every inch of him
  as hard as nails, as he removed his cap he disclosed a close-cropped head of
  grey hair that stood up right from a forehead absolutely square. He spoke
  pleasantly enough, his English refined and correct.</p>

  <p>"What my friend Mr. Hutton says is quite right," he said. "I am a
  naturalist connected with the Museum of South Kensington. Unfortunately, some
  of my specimen cases were capsized into a place where the water is too deep
  to recover them, that is, without injury to the tin cases. So I thought, we
  might be able to pump the little lagoon dry and recover them, without rough
  handling. Mr. Hutton has a high pressure pump, but no armored hose. I thought
  perhaps you might be able to supply the deficiency. We only want it for a day
  or two."</p>

  <p>"I dare say I could," Endellion drawled. "On second thoughts, I am quite
  sure I can. And I shall be happy to deliver the hose anywhere you want."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is very good of you," Franks said. "It is not very far away. On
  the north-west of the island there are three palm trees and there the coral
  reef sheers away into deep water. The lagoon is just behind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Endellion said. "I will see that you have the
  stuff tomorrow morning. In fact, I'll take it myself. Will forty fathoms be
  sufficient?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Franks was of the opinion that it would be more than ample. He was
  exceedingly sorry to trouble Mr. Endellion and was overwhelmed with the
  latter's kindness. He partook of the whisky and soda and cigars hospitably
  produced by Endellion, and after a further exchange of compliments left the
  deck of the Gehenna in the wake of the grinning Hutton.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of that?" Graydon asked. "What's the game,
  Skipper?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Endellion said thoughtfully. "Perhaps I shall be able to
  tell you more about it after I have delivered the goods to-morrow. But Billy
  Hutton is hardly the sort of man to go out of his way to help a harmless
  naturalist."</p>

  <p>"Naturalist, be damned," Shacklock exclaimed. "Why, that man's a German
  officer. He's got it written all over him. And see how he stood. Did you see
  how he brought his heels together and bowed from his waist? Why, another
  second and he would have given us a salute."</p>

  <p>"A regular man of the world, the Prodigal Son," Wallace laughed. "What
  makes you so sure, old chap?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have seen the tribe before," Shacklock grinned. "During my
  brief but brilliant career in the United States I put in a few months at West
  Point, and there we had a dozen or more retired German officers. They were
  quite a cult with us at one time. Oh, I am sure I am right."</p>

  <p>"And so am I," Endellion said curtly. "That chap's a German naval officer,
  and Billy Hutton's in his pay. Now, what I make of it is this. We are almost
  on the top of a big petrol store and unless I'm greatly mistaken the
  Deutschland is coming here before long to fill up. That's what they want the
  armored hose for. They have lost theirs, or they haven't got enough. The
  whole thing's plain as a pikestaff. The oil is hidden just round the headland
  yonder so that it can be pumped straight into the submarine. You heard what
  our quasi- naturalist said about the edge of the island where the reef sheers
  into deep water. Well, there you are, and within the next eight-and-forty
  hours the biggest submarine in the world will be here. Now, if we can down
  that boat I guess we can stop all these raids on shipping in the Indian
  Ocean. At least, that's my idea, and that was the idea of the Naval
  Lieutenant who shall be nameless. And there's no time to be lost. We'll just
  get out to sea as soon as the tide turns."</p>

  <p>"You've got a scheme?" the brigadier asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"More than one," Endellion said. "But with any luck one will be enough.
  Now then, lads, jump about a bit. Take a boat, two of you, and dump down that
  armored hose on the spot indicated by the gentle Mr. Franks. And, whatever
  you do, don't go prospecting around. Just chuck the stuff on shore and come
  away."</p>

  <p>Nightfall saw the Gehenna out at sea steering an erratic course till dawn,
  when she ran alongside a dirty, dilapidated tramp steamer that was at once a
  byword and a laughing-stock in the whole of those tropical seas. She was
  dirty and dingy and rusty and slow, a veritable mollusc of the ocean creeping
  from port to port and floating more by the grace of God than anything else. A
  grimy-looking individual behind a short pipe grunted something in response to
  Endellion's hail. As far as the eye could see there was no sign of a sail
  anywhere.</p>

  <p>"That you, Gunter?" Endellion asked.</p>

  <p>"Tain't nobody else," the man behind the black pipe grunted. "What will
  you be wantin' with me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, come on board and I'll tell you," Endellion replied. "We've still
  got a bottle or two of whisky left."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the skipper of the tramp Sardonyx lounged on the
  spotless deck of the Gehenna. After his fourth excursion in the direction of
  the whisky bottle he began to listen more complacently to the proposal that
  Endellion had to make. Briefly, it was this.</p>

  <p>For a valuable consideration Mr. Gunter contracted to hand over the
  Sardonyx to the crew of the Gehenna and take himself modestly away, with his
  men to one of the little islands in the neighborhood where they were to
  remain hidden for a week. And, meanwhile, the Gehenna would anchor up in one
  of the many tiny harbors, not only as a guarantee of good faith, but as an
  earnest that both tobacco and whisky would be plentiful so far as the
  voluntary prisoners were concerned. And if anything happened to the Sardonyx
  then Endellion contracted to make good the loss. And as he was known in those
  seas as a man of his word, and as he was recognised as a man of substance,
  Gunter raised no further objections.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," he said. "You can sink the confounded old hooker
  if you like. If I can get a new boat out of this business I shall be well
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>These high diplomatic arrangements having been completed, the two boats
  lay side by side in a little land-locked harbor far away from all prying
  eyes, and for the next few hours the two crews worked harder than they had
  ever worked in their lives before. By sunset the wireless installation of the
  Gehenna had been transferred to the Sardonyx, and so, also, had the two four-
  inch guns. And the crew of the Gehenna, who were crawling about the deck of
  the Sardonyx like so many lice, were transformed out of all recognition, too.
  Gone were their smart uniforms, gone all semblance of discipline and order,
  and in the place of a smart collection of sailormen appeared a lounging set
  of deck hands, sullen almost to the verge of mutiny. It was a fine piece of
  stage work, and Endellion was naturally proud of it. But there was a method
  behind all this, despite the grease and dirt, and the blackened, visages. And
  so the Sardonyx crept across the surface of the waters, a greasy dingy oily
  outrage on the face of the ocean. It was, in the language of Graydon, who had
  a pretty turn for metaphor, like a squashed blue-bottle flattened out on the
  surface of a marine landscape.</p>

  <p>The one individual who viewed the whole scene with an indifference born of
  familiarity was Gunter, the owner of the Sardonyx, who had been taken on
  board at the last moment, or so he thought, though this was part of
  Endellion's strategy. It had been no part of his scheme to let the grimy
  little Welshman into the secret until they were afloat. Not that Gunter
  minded, for the little man was quite a patriot in his way, especially when
  patriotism and pocket walked hand in hand, so to speak.</p>

  <p>"So that's the game, whatever, Mr. Endellion," he said. "Well you can
  count me in, look you. And if the old tub goes down, why you'll just make it
  good."</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," Endellion said.</p>

  <p>"And if there is any trouble with that man Hutton, then I'll ask you to
  see me through. For it is not likely that these parts will be healthy for me
  in future."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Endellion laughed. "You'll get well paid, and if
  this little stunt turns up trumps I don't think you will find the Admiralty
  likely to be stingy. Why you ought to be able to retire out of this
  business."</p>

  <p>Gunter responded that he wanted nothing better. He had done fairly well
  with that rusty old barge of his, and, if he could see a further thousand or
  two, had made up his mind to settle down somewhere in New Zealand and devote
  the balance of his existence to the intensive culture of vegetables. There
  was evidently a vein of poetry in the little man.</p>

  <p>And so for the next twelve hours the Sardonyx blundered along, whilst
  miracles were being wrought on her deck. The dingy, dirty-faced crew worked
  like heroes until at length the two 4-in. guns were in place and trained
  almost to Wallace's satisfaction. To a certain extent he had had to make
  bricks without straw. He had rigged up iron sheeting and steel plates and
  bolts until a couple of fairly efficient platforms had been made. These he
  eyed dubiously.</p>

  <p>"I hope they will be all right," he said. "Though I has ma doots. If those
  guns break loose they'll shake the guts out of this old barge. Well, we'll
  hope for the best."</p>

  <p>So they drifted on through the night, apparently without aim or direction,
  until at length they fetched up to the lee of the coral reef where
  Endellion's crew had dumped down the armored hose. They were lying some three
  miles away from a clump of palms that marked the spot, lying lazily in the
  trough of a silver sea with steam oozing out of every joint of the Sardonyx.
  It was as if something had gone wrong with the rotten engines, a complete
  breakdown leaving it at the mercy of any storm that came along. The Sardonyx
  lay there, a pathetic object, and, at the same time, an object of proper
  contempt for any craft worthy of the name. Any passing boat familiar with
  those seas would have known at once that here was the Sardonyx in trouble,
  again waiting pathetically for a tow, or, in the alternative, going down to
  the bottom, where she should have been long ago. She was flying a distress
  signal, and apparently her crew were resigned to despair. A more pathetic,
  lamentable spectacle had never blotted the South Pacific.</p>

  <p>All this to the outward eye, at least. But the grimy crew with their
  blackened faces and the temporary commander who might have just finished
  crawling up the funnel, were eagerly watching with keen eyes for the first
  sign of life on the edge of the coral reef. Endellion stood by the rail with
  a pair of powerful glasses to his eyes. And there he watched hour after hour
  until at length his patience was rewarded.</p>

  <p>He saw a boat beached on the sand from which two men emerged dragging a
  box after them. Then he made out clearly enough the big burly figure of Billy
  Hutton and the trim, square-built man who could have been none else than the
  pseudo-naturalist, who called himself Franks. For a little time the two
  busied themselves, until presently the Sardonyx dawned upon them. Apparently
  this vision of beauty was rather disturbing to Franks, for he pointed it out
  to his companion, and an earnest conversation apparently followed. Then the
  motor boat slid out to the sea again with Hutton upon it, and a little later
  swept round under the counter of the derelict. Hutton hailed her.</p>

  <p>At a sign from Endellion, Gunter lounged forward and stood with his elbows
  on the rail. The rest of the crew followed with a certain moody
  indifference.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" Hutton asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual, look you," Gunter said. "Engine trouble whatever."</p>

  <p>Then followed some jargon in the language of machinery to which Hutton
  listened with polite indifference.</p>

  <p>"I can't do anything for you yet, old man," he said. "I am rather busy
  over yonder for an hour or two, and if you can keep going till night I'll
  arrange a tow for you. The usual terms, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The Welshman indicated that it was all the same to him, and Hutton steamed
  off again, apparently quite easy in his mind and suspecting no mischief.
  There was no time to be lost, and, in any case, it did not matter. The crew
  of the Sardonyx were too far away to take in any details, and even if they
  knew what was going on it would be out of their power to do anything till the
  big grey raider was at sea again. And so another hour or two passed, until
  suddenly Endellion emitted a sound between a sigh and a gasp, and handed over
  his glasses to Wallace.</p>

  <p>"There you are, old man," he said. "She's come."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, you are right," Wallace exclaimed as he gazed steadily through
  the binoculars. "The father and mother of all submarines. Lord, she must be
  nearly six hundred feet long! And, what a mark!"</p>

  <p>The glasses were passed from hand to hand until there was not a man on
  board who had not had a good view of the big German U-boat. She lay there, on
  the edge of the coral reef, broadside on to the Sardonyx that yawed and
  dipped in a perfect bath of steam as if her last moment had come. Behind this
  camouflage five-and-twenty pair of eyes were watching the drama that was
  taking place on the edge of the reef.</p>

  <p>"I think she's our bird now, old man," Endellion said cheerfully. "She's
  not a bit suspicious of us."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope not," Wallace said. "It looks like a case of rock me to
  sleep, mother, all right. But you never know with those devils. They might
  take it into their heads at any moment to hand us a dozen shells out of mere
  mischief. And if I don't get her first shot or two, we're done."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had thought of that," Endellion said. "When the band begins to
  play, we'll get the boats out, leaving just you and me and one or two more on
  board. They'll never see the boats in this sea, and, if the worst comes to
  the worst, we can pull round the point and land in the bay beyond."</p>

  <p>To all of which the crew demurred as one man. But Endellion was firm
  enough, and a few moments later the deck was deserted save for the Gentle
  Buccaneers and the little Welshman who owned the Sardonyx.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a score of men had landed from the submarine and were busy on
  the reef, evidently opening the petrol tank and connecting it with the
  U-boat. Gradually the Sardonyx yawed round, still oozing steam at every pore
  until the guns were trained on the long grey hull that rose out of the sea
  like some gigantic whale.</p>

  <p>"Let her have it," Shacklock yelled excitedly. "Plug her under the fifth
  rib, brigadier. Show us what Daddy did in the Great War."</p>

  <p>But Wallace did not appear to be heeding. He was too engrossed on his task
  to hear anything that was going on around him. Presently there was a puff of
  smoke and a dull roar, and a shell from one of the guns pitched neatly into
  the centre of the group hovering around the petrol tanks. Then there was a
  sort of dissolving view, visible enough through the binoculars, and the trim
  figure of the man Franks crumpled up and lay like a brown speck on the
  burning sands.</p>

  <p>"That was a good 'un," Graydon said. "But not quite good enough, old
  man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not bad for a sighting shot," Wallace said coolly. "Let's hand 'em
  another pasteboard."</p>

  <p>The second shot was effective enough, for it struck the submarine forward,
  tearing a huge hole in her bows, and, exploding, seemed to fill the air with
  fragments of steel and fractured machinery. But apparently no vital spot had
  been struck, for the crew gathered to the attack, and almost before Wallace
  could get in another shot the submarine had fired in her turn, and with a
  crash down came most of the top hamper of the Sardonyx. Another and another
  shot followed, the third one sheering away part of the bows of the Sardonyx
  without apparently disturbing Wallace, who worked his guns grimly. It was
  touch and go even now, and it might have gone hard indeed with those on board
  but for the fact that Wallace's fifth and sixth shots were absolutely
  pictures. The fifth pitched plumb on the deck of the submarine, blowing the
  crew thereon into fragments, and the sixth got into the very vitals of the
  U-boat, for the explosion that followed shook the crazy old Sardonyx from
  stem to stern. Then the bows of the submarine rose until she stood on end in
  the grotesque likeness of a church steeple. Just for a moment she hung
  quivering there, then gradually went down in a cloud of steam and smoke into
  400 fathoms of water off the edge of the reef and was seen no more. All that
  remained of her consisted of Billy Hutton and two German sailors dancing
  frantically on the reef and shaking their fists in the direction of the
  Sardonyx, which was settling by the head.</p>

  <p>"So that's that," Wallace drawled.</p>

  <p>"Amen, not to say Prosit," Graydon cried. "But come on, lads, we haven't
  got a minute to spare."</p>

  <p>They swarmed down the side into the last boat and pulled away vigorously
  from the doomed Sardonyx. She went down presently like a stone, there was a
  ripple on the sea, and a dull explosion somewhere, and the old tram was
  finished.</p>

  <p>"Now what do you think of that for a day's work?" Endellion asked. "Well,
  we can't take any credit, boys. That will all go to Gunter. He'll have all
  the kudos, to say nothing of the Admiralty dollars. But I'm sorry about the
  old hooker."</p>

  <p>"Now, don't you go fretting your fat about that," Gunter grinned. "If you
  are satisfied and the Admiralty is satisfied, then there's no cause for me to
  grumble whatever. And if ever you want any really nice vegetables, you send
  to David Gunter and he will supply you with all you want."</p><br>

     name="story6">6.&mdash;CORALIE AND THE PEARLS</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 26 Jul
  1919</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE GIRL slipped out of her evening wrap, and stood before
  Blinn in all that strange seductive beauty of hers, which was at once so
  apparent and so elusive.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lionel Blinn, I think," she said. "It was very good of you to suggest
  that we should dine here, at the Ritz. Now, shall we sit down and get on
  simultaneously with the dinner and the business? My time is limited. I am due
  at a big function presently on behalf of my paper, the 'Herald.' You want me
  to smuggle the six finest pearls in the world across the Atlantic and hand
  them over to Mr. Rufus Steuveyant; is that not so?"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady!" Blinn expostulated.</p>

  <p>"Don't be nervous," the girl smiled. "I always believe in letting the
  enemy see apparently all that I am doing. You see, my position on the staff
  of the 'Daily Herald' enables me to run backwards and forwards to America
  frequently. I have always a good excuse for crossing the Atlantic; you know
  my reputation as a journalist. If I am found out on this occasion, all you
  have to do is to pay the duty, and take over the pearls, leaving me to get
  out of the mess as best I can. Now do you see what I am driving at? I want
  you to put all your cards on the table. I am perfectly aware that you want
  money very badly, and that you have an option on six unique pearls, which you
  have provisionally sold to Mr. Rufus Steuveyant. He is purchasing these
  stones to replace six pearls that were damaged some time ago, and which
  formed part of the famous Navarre necklace, at one time the property of
  Margaret of Anjou, and a rare historical gem. This, I understand, is to be a
  birthday present to Miss Steuveyant from her doting father. Is that about
  right?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely correct," Blinn murmured. "100,000 pounds is the price to be
  paid on delivery in New York."</p>

  <p>"And that is the subtle distinction," Coralie said. "The old man will pay
  100,000 pounds in New York, which means, of course, that if you can smuggle
  them across the water you can make an extra profit of 20,000 pounds,
  represented by the amount of duty saved. Now, where do I come in?
  Halves?"</p>

  <p>"Very well," Blinn said. "It shall be as you like, and I will hand over
  the pearls to you whenever you are ready. I wish you had not chosen this spot
  to discuss matters. If anybody overheard you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Coralie produced a newspaper cutting from the bosom of her dress.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," she said. "The more publicity the better. Now, I know a
  good deal about you and your affairs, and, being convinced that you would
  employ me, I wrote this paragraph, which appeared in the 'Herald' this
  morning. As you will see, it is to the effect that Mr. Steuveyant has
  purchased those pearls from you, and that they are intended to make good the
  missing ones in the Navarre necklace."</p>

  <p>"You are mad," Blinn gasped.</p>

  <p>"My very dear sir," Coralie drawled, "for a stockbroker you are
  exceedingly simple. Don't you understand that I want to have the limelight
  concentrated on me? Look across to the fourth table on the left, the table
  decorated with lilies-of-the-valley. Do you see a young man there, a
  beautifully-groomed youth, young and good-looking, with eyes like blue
  agates. That is Mr. Silas Flint, the astutest man in the American Customs
  to-day. He does little else but travel backwards and forwards on the big
  liners with an eye to Uncle Sam's revenue account. With Mr. Flint in my eye,
  I wrote the paragraph which seems to have disturbed you so strangely. And I
  took good care that Flint should see it. Up to now he cannot prove that I
  have ever smuggled a stone across the Atlantic, but he knows perfectly well
  that he has me to thank for one or two successful little ventures. I am quite
  glad he has seen us here this evening. I wanted him to, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Can you cross by the Campagnia on the 14th?" Blinn asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Coralie said. "But I can let you know in a minute or
  two. But I rather think it will be the Albania on the 19th. Ah, I see Mr.
  Flint is moving. He is pretty sure to come across and speak to me."</p>

  <p>The immaculately-groomed young man with the handsome face and steel-blue
  eyes lounged smilingly in the direction of the carnation-decked table.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Miss Rouget," he said. "Delighted to see you again. Do you happen to
  be coming our way on Saturday?"</p>

  <p>"Saturday week," Coralie corrected. "I suppose you couldn't put off your
  trip for another seven days, so that we might travel together, could
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I ought not to, but I will," Flint said grimly. "I could not refuse so
  flattering an invitation."</p>

  <p>It was with profound misgivings that Blinn parted with his precious pearls
  on the morning of the Friday week. At any rate, the die was cast now, and the
  Albania started from the Mersey with a full complement of passengers,
  including Flint and the lady with the pearls. That Coralie had the gems in
  her possession Flint did not entertain the slightest doubt. He knew, of
  course, that primarily her business was connected with her newspaper, but
  this was only an excuse to cover a far more remunerative transaction. And
  Coralie knew that he knew it.</p>

  <p>She also knew that Flint admired her tremendously, and that if she only
  said the word, she would have the pride of the American Customs at her
  feet.</p>

  <p>And so things drifted on to the night before the end of the voyage. That
  evening a special show took place in the big saloon. As usual, there was more
  than one theatrical company on board, including several stars of musical
  comedy and a group of Spanish dancers who attracted a good deal of attention
  in London during the past few months. It was a daring and audacious show,
  Michel Lopez did some astounding things in connection with a number of live
  cobras with which he appeared on the stage. This was rather trying to the
  nerves of the more timid passengers, for it was known that the snakes were in
  full possession of their fangs, and that the slightest accident would
  probably result in a horrible death to their owner.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad that's over," Coralie sighed. "Where does Senor Lopez keep those
  reptiles?"</p>

  <p>"In his cabin, I believe," Flint replied. "Nice sort of companions to pass
  the night with."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering what would happen if they got loose," Coralie said. "Just
  imagine the panic if they did. I'll get Senor Lopez to give me an interview.
  I guess I could make a fine column article for the 'New York Mail.' Would you
  mind getting hold of the Senor for me presently. We might go forward, and
  have a glass of champagne together."</p>

  <p>"Consider it done," Flint said. "When I come to think of it, doesn't old
  Steuveyant control the 'New York Mail?' You know who I mean?"</p>

  <p>Coralie shot a keen glance at her companion. It seemed to her that there
  might be something behind that innocent question.</p>

  <p>"I believe he does," she said. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing. Come along, and I'll fix you up in a comfortable corner of
  the saloon and bring the Senor round."</p>

  <p>The Spaniard was honestly impressed by Coralie's outspoken admiration of
  his performance, and promised, too, that hers should be an exclusive
  interview, but shook her head when the champagne bottle was pushed towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I dare not, madame. I loff the champagne, but he loff not me. One
  little glass, and for an hour I am almost intoxicated. I haf the weakest head
  in the world."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense," Coralie smiled. "You don't expect me to believe that a man
  with a nerve like yours is afraid of a glass of champagne. Your pets are safe
  enough."</p>

  <p>Lopez hesitated for a moment, then, as if hypnotised by the golden flecks
  in those wonderful brown eyes, lifted the glass to his lips, and drank to the
  last drop. Then followed five minutes loquacity, couched in the purest
  Spanish, and shortly afterwards, a precipitate retreat on the part of Lopez
  in the direction to his cabin.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing," Flint said. "Still, I have seem instances of the kind
  before. Yes, I'll look into Lopez's cabin as I go to bed, just to see that
  it's all safe. A man in his state shut up in the same cabin with half a dozen
  high velocity cobras&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>It was nearly midnight before Flint glanced into the Spaniard's cabin. The
  electrics were full on, and, in his berth, Lopez was lying outside the
  counterpane attired only in his pyjamas. His eyes were wide open and staring,
  and there was a green tinge on his cheeks, and a rigidity of the jaw, which
  could not have been produced by one glass of champagne. And then, as Flint
  looked again, he saw the cause of the frozen horror on the face of the
  Spaniard. For there, curled up on the pit of his stomach, with wicked head
  uplifted and forked tongue viciously displayed, was one of the cobras. In the
  far corner of the cabin was the glass case, containing the rest of them, and
  these, as far as Flint could judge, were safe.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, man," Flint whispered, hoarsely. "Do you understand your
  danger?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," the Spaniard said. "I understand. When I got back in the
  cabin, I was fool enough to feed those reptiles. It was a mad thing to do, as
  I could hardly see what I was up to. Jane managed to get out. Just see if the
  other five are there, will you? Everything depends on your coolness now."</p>

  <p>With his hair lifting on his scalp, and a pricking sensation playing up
  and down his spine, Flint tiptoed across the cabin and glanced into the glass
  tank containing the rest of the reptiles. Holding himself in hand he
  counted.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he said. "There are five of them."</p>

  <p>"Then there's a chance yet," Lopez said between his white lips. "This one
  here I have only had in my collection about a month. I have hardly dared to
  touch Jane, though I believe she is getting to know me. When I undressed, I
  lay down here, feeling hot and uncomfortable, and I suppose it was the warmth
  of my body that attracted her."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what do you want me to do?" Flint asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing will happen as long as I lie perfectly still. Now, go to the
  steward, and bring me a shallow bowl and a jug of milk. Put the bowl as near
  to the cot as you dare, and froth the milk into it slowly. My life is in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>In a sort of waking nightmare, Flint procured the milk, and returned with
  it to the cabin. Now that the first horror was over, he was as calm and
  collected as Lopez himself. He poured the milk into the bowl, and, almost
  immediately, the reptile began to move. Inch by inch, in leaden moments which
  seemed like hours, the coils were unloosened, and the long, lean head reached
  over the edge of the cot in the direction of the tempting liquid, then, with
  a flop, the sinuous body dropped to the floor, and the Spaniard promptly
  collapsed.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes a moment or two later, and sat up, staring wildly about
  him.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" he murmured. "Oh, I remember. In the corner of the cabin
  just opposite you is a forked stick. Throw it across to me. No hurry, the
  danger is over."</p>

  <p>"You are going to kill the brute?" Flint asked.</p>

  <p>"No. I am going to catch it. The fault is entirely mine, and it is not
  Jane who should suffer."</p>

  <p>A moment later, and the head of the cobra was dexterously pinned to the
  cabin floor, and held there in the cleft of the stick. Lopez smiled
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"One more little favour," he said. "Go to the steward and ask him for a
  small glass of brandy. I want it badly, my friend, and it will not hurt me
  now, I am sure."</p>

  <p>When Flint returned with the spirit, Lopez was in the act of restoring the
  recreant Jane to her prison house. He appeared to have her firmly gripped by
  the back of the neck, and then he slammed down the lid and turned the key in
  the lock.</p>

  <p>"I had to force myself to do that, or I should have found my nerve failing
  me the next time I came to handle my pets in public. And I owe you a debt of
  gratitude, Mr. Flint. Perhaps you will be seeing Miss Coralie Rouget
  to-morrow. Will you give her my compliments? Tell her that I think that I can
  add a chapter most remarkable to that interview of hers."</p>

  <p>"By jove, that's not a bad idea," Flint said. "I shall be seeing Miss
  Rouget in the morning."</p>

  <p>In saying this, he spoke no more than the truth, for so far he had been
  baffled and beaten, and it was his fixed intention not to lose sight of
  Coralie before he had seen her safely as far as her hotel. Moreover, if the
  pearls were to be intercepted, there was no time to be lost. He was getting
  anxious and restless, and the fear of failure loomed over him like a cloud.
  Was he going to be beaten?</p>

  <p>It was 12 o'clock the following day, the Custom's House examination was
  over, and Coralie had departed to her hotel with a promise to see Lopez later
  in the afternoon, while Flint made his way with a heavy heart in the
  direction of his chief's office to confess that 100,000 pounds of pearls had
  been smuggled into the United States, and that he had been powerless to
  prevent it. In other words, the pride of the Customs House had met his
  Waterloo. The chief was duly sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess the best of us get done by a woman sometime," he said. "And
  I calculate that Coralie Rouget is some woman, too. Why don't you fix up a
  contract? Why don't you marry her? Between you two Uncle Sam would have a
  good time."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Coralie was ostensibly on her way to see Lopez, and complete the
  story with which she hoped to make something of a sensation in that evening's
  edition of the 'New York Mail.' She found Lopez in his sitting room awaiting
  her. In the corner of the room was the glass and wire case covered with a
  blanket. Knowing what she knew even then Coralie shuddered slightly as the
  Spaniard opened the case, and, plunging his hand inside, produced the body of
  a snake.</p>

  <p>"You need not be alarmed," he said. "This is the lamented Jane, who died
  suddenly in my cabin last night. Only, of course, as our clever friend was
  not there at the time, he did not know it. Nor does he know that I bought
  Jane on purpose for the little expedition, and that she has had no fangs for
  years. She is dead, as you see, because it is necessary. And now, my dear
  madame, to business."</p>

  <p>Saying which, Lopez took the snake by the tail, and, drawing his hand
  towards the throat, dislodged six small packages wrapped in silver paper.</p>

  <p>"Behold your pearls," he said. "Which you will now take to the millionaire
  who bought them, and collect the promised cheque. Also, later in the day,
  perhaps you would send me your cheque, and, moreover, there is no reason why
  you should not draw a handsome sum of money for the story of what happened
  last night. I think it is what you newspaper people call a 'scoop,' and I am
  not blind to the advertisement. To tell the truth, few professionals are. I
  smile to myself when I think of Mr. Flint's face last night."</p>

  <p>It was about 6 o'clock the same evening when Coralie daintily tripped up
  the steps towards the editorial offices of the 'Mail' with her thrilling and
  exclusive story in her hand. She had killed two birds with one stone, and she
  evinced no astonishment in meeting Steuveyant himself at the top of the
  stairs. It might have been a coincidence, on the other hand, it might have
  been part of an elaborate arrangement. For Coralie said nothing, and merely
  handed over a small packet to the millionaire, who examined the contents.</p>

  <p>"I guess that was smart," he said, "How did you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's my secret," Coralie laughed. "I can only tell it to one man,
  and even he is not likely to know unless I make up my mind to marry him."</p>

  <p>"Come and dine with us," Steuveyant said, cordially enough. "Guess my
  daughter will be glad to meet you on her birthday."</p>

  <p>"I should love to," Coralie said sweetly.</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY MAURICE GREIFFENHAGEN</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. LI, Jan 1920, pp
  158-164</h3>

  <p class="first">THE master-miracle had exploded like a blinding bomb before
  Barwick's dazed vision, and he was gazing at it blindly still with eyes that
  saw not and a mind struggling dimly back to consciousness. Had Chance been
  superlatively good to him, or was it only another phase of the old hideous
  nightmare?</p>

  <p>If things were real, if the world had suddenly turned turtle, or
  Armageddon had gone up in an explosion that shook the universe, then he was
  free. On the wall opposite was a calendar, peeled to the bone almost by the
  daily shedding of a leaf, and the date staring him in the face was November
  11, 1918&mdash;a blazing scar on the heart of history, had he only known
  it.</p>

  <p>He knew&mdash;though, for the life of him, he could not have told
  why&mdash;that he was seated in a big resounding beer-hall in Dammer Strasse,
  which was just off the Wilhelmstrasse, and that the man by his side had been
  a prisoner of war, too. And now they were free. A few hours before the prison
  doors had been flung open, and a German gaoler, who actually smiled, had told
  them that they could go where they liked. Barwick had gathered that something
  or other had been signed, and that Berlin was in the hands of the mob. And so
  he had gone forth like a caged bird that seeks the light. He was a homing
  pigeon with a broken wing, and the prevailing instinct in him bade him to
  turn his face towards the sea, and perhaps in time he might taste the salt
  lick of the brine on his lips again.</p>

  <p>Now, this man had been a prisoner at Ruhleben for something like three
  years. He had been picked like a fly from an island in the Southern Seas,
  where his life lay and his work had held him, and he bad come thence by a
  U-boat to Zeebrugge, from which port he had been brought to Germany.</p>

  <p>For they had wanted him&mdash;wanted him badly. There was a secret that he
  could tell them&mdash;a secret that the Wilhelmstrasse had heard, fourteen
  thousand miles away, back in the early days of the century&mdash;in 1913, to
  be exact&mdash;a secret in connection with the extraction of heavy oils from
  marine refuse, and the Great General Staff had been interested in that. So
  that his name had been on the secret ledger of the Devil's lieutenants what
  time Barwick modestly regarded himself as a humble individual seeking a
  becoming fortune for his wife and child, waiting for him patiently enough in
  Eastbourne.</p>

  <p>So they had brought him back carefully in a fugitive U-boat that had
  survived the destruction of the <i>Emden</i>, and dropped him finally at
  Ruhleben, to be attended to in due course and his secret forced from him,
  only, unhappily, an obtuse sentry, not in the confidence of his superiors,
  had shown his patriotism and his sense of <i>Deutschland über Alles</i> by
  bashing Barwick over the head with a rifle&mdash;probably the one instance of
  brutality ever genuinely regretted by a German official, because from that
  moment Barwick ceased to take any interest in most mundane things, and the
  secret was safe.</p>

  <p>He was getting over it now. He didn't know how he had got into the café,
  he didn't understand the sullen, indifferent crowd and the red flags that had
  broken out like a rash. In a hazy way he missed the clicking of heels and the
  brutal commands of gold-laced authority; but he was beginning to comprehend
  that he had found a friend, and that the individual opposite him was an
  Australian sailor-man called Van Cutting, lately a resident at the Spandau
  prisoners' camp.</p>

  <p>So they sat there, drinking beer out of pewter-topped stone mugs&mdash;a
  queer couple, the one clad in fragments of sacking and boots bound up with
  ropes of hay, the other in khaki breeches, tattered sweater, and a poacher's
  cloth cap. There were Germans of all classes around them, officers without
  their badges or with badges roughly torn from their shoulders, who sat in
  moody groups with listless eyes, listening without astonishment to the two
  men freely talking English there without let or hindrance. Oh, yes, the
  super-miracle had come all right.</p>

  <p>A waiter, polite&mdash;indeed, almost courteous &mdash;refilled the mugs
  at a sign from Cutting, and gazed with something like awe upon a ten-shilling
  Treasury note that the Australian had put into his hand. Barwick regarded him
  with the dawn of a smile oh his face. Gradually, very gradually, he was
  coming back to the kingdom of his mind, till the dark curtain of the past
  black years rolled away, and his mental focus resolved itself into a cool and
  sane perspective.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to enjoy it; he was beginning to realise that Germany was
  beaten, and that the people around him were slowly coming to a realisation of
  the truth. It was almost incredible, all the same, to a man who had passed
  five years of his youth on the left bank of the Rhine. For Barwick had been a
  student at Bonn, and he knew what the soul of Germany had been in those days.
  It faintly amused him to see an infantryman, with a white band round his arm,
  swaying drunkenly on a table and singing the "Marseillaise" at the top of his
  voice. And this incredible thing was happening in Berlin!</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it?" Cutting asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm only just beginning to think," Barwick replied. "But never mind about
  that. The question is, what are we going to do? We can't stay here."</p>

  <p>"That'll be all right," the Australian said. "These chaps are down and
  out. We're safe enough, and, after all, it's only a matter of money."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" Barwick asked, with a smile&mdash;the first genuine smile
  on his face for two years. Cutting tapped the side of his coat and shed a
  wink.</p>

  <p>"I've got it," he whispered. "I've had it all the time&mdash;between the
  soles of my boots. When I went to the Front, I put a wad or two there, half
  expecting something of this sort; and when those swine got hold of me, I hid
  the boodle under a brick in my cell. I've got over fifty pounds here. It'll
  take us over the frontier all right&mdash;? plenty for both of us."</p>

  <p>"But you don't know me," Barwick protested.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I was in the Australian coasting trade before I joined up. You
  are the chap who was running that queer joint at Shinti amongst the
  cannibals. Had a German partner called Oppner. Some dodge for getting oil out
  of seaweed. Saw you once, though you never spotted me. But say, partner, was
  that stunt of yours a good egg?"</p>

  <p>Barwick nodded vaguely. The muttering roar of the restaurant was in his
  ears; from outside came the hum of a city that resembled the noise made by a
  hive of angry bees. Then he pulled himself together again.</p>

  <p>"It was all right," he said. "It was all right from the first. I tried it
  when I had finished my course at Bonn, eight years ago. I tried it in London.
  Heavens, I tried it till I hadn't a shilling of capital left! Mind you,
  Cutting, I didn't know they were watching me, but they must have been doing
  so before I left Germany. And I suppose that's why they followed me half
  across the world, after the War broke out, and got me at last. I couldn't get
  anybody in England to take it up; I couldn't get the stuff I wanted for my
  purpose. I knew where it was, I knew that there were millions of tons of it
  down there off the Solomon Isles&mdash; Shinti, to be exact. It's a big oily
  sort of weed that grows in the lagoons and up the rivers as far as the tides
  run. So I scraped together all I could, and went out there with Oppner. He
  believed in it&mdash;he couldn't help it. So we set out from the Fanto Group
  in a motor-boat we got hold of, and landed at Shinti with some scrap
  machinery and a case of Winchester rifles. It was a desperate venture,
  because we knew what we had to face; but we trusted to our rifles to put the
  fear of the Lord into the hearts of the niggers, and, by George, they did. We
  made friends with one of them&mdash;the only one who would come near
  us&mdash;and precious useful he was. You see, we fed him and gave him
  presents, and whenever there was any treachery on foot he always let us know,
  so that we were ready. And there, for two years before the War, we hammered
  out our primitive machinery and turned out the stuff. I tell you, Cutting,
  there's no better heavy oil in the world, and any amount, too, for the
  making."</p>

  <p>"Sounds good," Cutting murmured, "especially just now, when there's a
  world shortage of that sort of thing, and likely to be, for that matter."</p>

  <p>"There's a fortune in it," Barwick said. "And it's cheap to make. Why,
  Oppner and myself, with our comic machinery, made a couple of tons a day
  easily."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then he knew all about it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, he didn't." Barwick smiled. "He knew how to work the plant, but I
  never told him the formula. It's a mathematical formula, and if you don't get
  it exact, your stuff is worth little. It took me nearly two years to get
  those figures on a workable basis. I knew them by heart once, but now I am as
  ignorant of them as you are. I suppose I shall get over that clout over the
  head in time, but, you see, if I begin to think, my head gets stuffed with
  cotton-wool, and I'm good for nothing for days. And that's the trouble."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a hefty proposition."</p>

  <p>"Well, it might be, but it isn't. You see, the formula is in a safe place
  where I hid it when the trouble came, and if I were in Shinti I could put my
  hands on it in five minutes."</p>

  <p>"Better tell me the whole story," Cutting said.</p>

  <p>"All right. We'll go back to some three years ago&mdash;about that, more
  or less&mdash;at any rate, it wasn't long after the War began. Mind you, I
  didn't know there was a war on. I got no letters, and nothing came near us
  except some wandering tramp to fill its water-casks. But Oppner knew. Heaven
  only knows how, but he did, and the beastly swine never said a word to me
  about it. In his spare time he was mucking about with a primitive sort of
  wireless arrangement, though it never occurred to me at the time to ask him
  where he got his material from, but I found out afterwards that a U-boat,
  waiting on a cruiser, had landed the stuff on the island. I suppose by that
  time we had eight or ten tons of oil. Then one day off the island there comes
  a strange-looking craft, something between a big tramp and a cruiser, and
  lands a boat's crew. I was lying up at the time with a touch of malaria, and
  precious bad, too, so I suppose Oppner thought I didn't count. But the wind
  was right, and I heard what they were saying. And what do you think that boat
  was?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, give it up," Van Cutting said.</p>

  <p>"My friend, it was the <i>Emden</i>. And she was after our oil. She came
  on purpose, and Oppner had fetched her up with that comic wireless of his.
  You see, I know German almost as well as I know my own language, so I heard
  everything. I knew the War had been in progress for months, I knew that the
  Boche had been smashed on the Marne, and I knew that Germany looked like
  being in a tight place for petrol and heavy lubricants, and I knew that they
  wanted me over in Germany to work my invention on spent minerals, such as
  coal and slag. And I could have done it, too."</p>

  <p>Barwick took a long pull at his mug.</p>

  <p>"Well, that was the game. The <i>Emden</i> couldn't stop then&mdash;got
  wind of some big trouble, perhaps&mdash;and she was off in an hour, with a
  promise to come back later. If she couldn't manage that, she'd send a U-boat
  for me."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?" Cutting asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I just lay low. I saw my danger, and played the game of Brer
  Rabbit. I had some queer accidents, too. First of all, when I was out by
  myself one day, cutting seaweed, I lost the motor-launch&mdash;at least,
  that's what I told Oppner. But I ran her up into a creek and hid her under a
  heap of mango roots, where she is probably safe to this day. Then the oil
  caught fire and wrecked the whole of my plant. After that I took a little
  fireproof safe of mine and locked the formula away in it, and sank the thing
  in the middle of a deep lagoon, where I can find it if necessary. They were
  terrible misfortunes, but they seemed to worry Oppner a good deal more than
  they did me. And then, about a month later, the <i>Emden</i> came back."</p>

  <p>"The same old game, I suppose?" Cutting said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, there was no disguise this time. They were vastly polite to me,
  because von Müller is by way of being a gentleman, but they took me on board,
  and I was with them for the best part of six weeks. I knew that Germany was
  my destination, and what I was expected to do when I got there, but I said
  nothing till the real trouble began. I said nothing then because they put me
  on a U-boat, as I expected, and von Müller went off, hell for leather, for
  there was trouble sitting on his tail, and it wasn't very far off. And that's
  about all."</p>

  <p>Van Cutting turned the matter over slowly in his mind. He was no longer
  sitting in the heart of a great nation's tragedy, collecting
  nightmares&mdash;he was thinking of the practical side of things. He was
  thinking, for instance, of that old battered steamer of his, tied up to a
  wharf somewhere in an Australian port, in connection with the possibilities
  of what Barwick had been saying. And it seemed to him that it was good.</p>

  <p>"It's a big thing you've got, mate," he said. "Not that it means strolling
  along on a golden strand and filling our pockets with nuggets. But it's big
  because you've got what the world wants badly, and with a year or two's work
  it ought to be through. I've got the boat and I've got some machinery, and if
  you want a few hundred pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want nothing." Barwick said, "except your assistance, and there's half
  of the profits waiting for you."</p>

  <p>"Van Cutting rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"It's a bet," he said briefly."</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>They had worked their way out of Germany back, to the British lines, and
  from thence, in a few days, to London; and when Cutting had boasted that he
  and Barwick would be on the high seas, bound for the Southern Cross, within a
  fortnight, he had said a true thing. For he was known in the Port of London,
  where masters were eagerly awaiting crews, and they might have picked their
  own ship, half a dozen times over. They had come at length to Melbourne on a
  fast steamer through the Canal, and a few days later they were on their way
  across the Southern Seas, with a scratch crew, bound for Shinti. They had
  taken on board all that was needed, including a couple of machine-guns, which
  had been picked up at scrap price now that the War was over, and one fine
  morning they warped into a little bay, land-locked and palm-fringed, with an
  oily, oozy stream running back into the heart of the island. And here for two
  days they lay, talking over their plans until they were ready to push up the
  river in one of the ship's boats in the direction of a big lagoon fringed
  with trees, lying there like some sinister mirror, dark and mysterious,
  almost as if it were a scene that Dante had pictured. And here it was that
  they picked up the motor-boat Barwick spoken of, hidden and half buried in
  rotten vegetation, but heavy with oil, so that it only needed to be cleaned
  and the petrol taken on board for the voyage to the shallow waters where the
  precious seaweed lay, all ready for the work to come. They had gone up with
  only two of the crew besides themselves, for the rest were not to be trusted
  in that silent land, where danger lay behind every bush, and where the
  cannibals would be waiting for them at the first opportunity. So they sped
  on, a day or two later, the boat moving almost noiselessly in the oily
  waters, with the machine-gun grinning in her bows.</p>

  <p>They came at length to a shelving beach on the side of the big brackish
  waters, where a hut had been built, backed by a sheer cliff, so that, in case
  of an attack, the defenders could not be approached from the rear. It was
  here that Barwick and Oppner had worked for the best part of two years,
  taking watch, turn and turn about, with a Winchester rifle and a box of
  cartridges handy. It was in this way that they had kept the demon of fear
  alive in the hearts of the natives.</p>

  <p>Barwick lay back in the stern of the boat and wiped the blinding sweat
  from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said. "And there's the stuff, floating on the face of
  the lagoon, millions of tons of it. That's the hut we built, and there, away
  to the right, you can see what remains of our machinery."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look so derelict, either," Cutting said.</p>

  <p>"No, it doesn't," Barwick admitted. "And if that isn't smoke coming out of
  the hut, I'm greatly mistaken."</p>

  <p>Beyond question a thin spiral of smoke went up from the chimney of the
  hut. Barwick looked about him with alert suspicion. If his eyes did not
  decefve him, the machinery which he had carefully destroyed had been
  repaired, for he could see parts of it glistening in the sunshine, and
  noticed certain ancient receptacles standing in a row on the beach. He was
  conscious, too, that something was moving in the brush; it seemed to him that
  he could see the outline of more than one naked black figure. Then something
  whizzed over the bow of the boat, and a spear, flung by a muscular arm,
  plopped into the water. Immediately afterwards came the unmistakable crack of
  a rifle-shot from somewhere on the edge of the scrub, followed by one from
  the door of the hut, for Barwick could distinctly see the tiny wisp of smoke
  that hung there.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody in the shack," he whispered excitedly&mdash;"somebody
  who's working that machinery, and another somebody who is in trouble with the
  natives amongst the scrub. We've come just in time, Cutting. If our friends
  fall into jhe hands of those devils&mdash;cannibals to a man&mdash; well,
  I'll leave you to imagine it. Here, turn that machine-gun round and spray a
  belt along that bank of scrub."</p>

  <p>The machine-gun coughed its rapid message, spraying the scrub from end to
  end, followed here and there by howls of anguish and a quick stampede of
  ebony-black figures in the direction of the big wood behind the scrub. Then
  another figure emerged, a tall figure of a man, armed with what appeared to
  be a Winchester rifle, and clad only in a loin-cloth. He had been hit,
  probably with a spear, for he limped across the open painfully, glancing
  round from time to time, much like a man who is walking in his sleep.</p>

  <p>Barwick's eyes opened widely.</p>

  <p>"Memsambo!" he cried. "Memsambo!"</p>

  <p>The man, looking across the open, evidently heard, for he paused
  irresolutely as he looked in the direction of the boat.</p>

  <p>"And who might Memsambo be?" Cutting asked.</p>

  <p>"Our one friendly native," Barwick explained. "He came over to us the
  first week we were here. Did you ever see a lot of rooks pecking one of their
  colony to death&mdash;sort of court-martial arrangement?"</p>

  <p>"Saw it once," Cutting said. "They weren't rooks, but Australian crows.
  Funny sight."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was what was happening to Memsambo. Oppner and I came across
  the ceremony just at the right time. They were chipping pieces out of the
  poor wretch with their spears, preparatory to making a feast of him, no
  doubt. But a few rounds from the Winchester stopped that, and, as Memsambo
  daren't go back, he stayed with us ever after. But what the mystery was, I
  never could understand. Even when we had taught him some sort of English he
  wouldn't explain. Hi, Memsambo!"</p>

  <p>The big native hesitated in the direction of the boat, crawling on his
  hands and knees, touching the ground with his forehead over and over again.
  He knew something of white men and their ways, as the Winchester rifle which
  he dragged after him showed, but the machine-gun was clearly new magic to
  him, and the big man was sore afraid. Still, he came on till he grovelled
  almost at the feet of the two white men, and looked up at them with a dumb
  pleading in his eyes like that of a dog.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know me, Memsambo?" Barwick asked.</p>

  <p>"It is the white lord who makes fire out of the sea come back," Memsambo
  said reverently. "It is well that the great man who plays, with the fire
  returns to us, for there has been a great killing, and many feasts there in
  the woods, and they would have killed me, too, but for the magic that you
  make with that little thing that coughs like a sick monkey."</p>

  <p>They dragged Memsambo into the boat and bound up his wounds. There was
  nothing serious the matter&mdash;flesh wounds, for the most part, caused by
  the spears of the cannibals&mdash;and very soon the big native was sitting up
  again and examining the machine-gun with all the pleasure of a child with a
  new toy.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Memsambo," Barwick said, "and tell us all about it. Whom have
  you got over there in the hut? And who started my machinery again? Come,
  there's nothing to be afraid of. I don't think those black brethren of yours
  will trouble us any more, now they have learnt what a machine-gun can do.
  What have you been doing the last two years?"</p>

  <p>"I stayed with my friend," Memsambo said, not without dignity. "To those
  blinking black niggers who eat one another's flesh I could go back no more.
  The white man is my brother, and his ways are my ways. So I stay because he
  is good to me and because them other feller kill me an' eat me if I go back.
  And so, when my lord Barwick go away in the big ship, I stay a long time with
  my lord Oppner."</p>

  <p>"Oho!" Barwick said softly. "Oho!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, boss," Memsambo went on more confidently. "My lord Oppner tell me
  you go away to fight in a great war for your country, and he stay to look
  after your shop. Then we get the devil engine to go again, and we make the
  fire-water out of the sea. But they fight us, those black niggers, they fight
  us day and night, until the fire for our guns is all gone. For they know, the
  black niggers, they know. And in the hut yonder there are just three bullets,
  and two I have in my loin-cloth. If you not come with the other white lord,
  then to-morrow we die, and they make big feast here on the beach."</p>

  <p>"Come on, Cutting," Barwick said. "Let's get to the bottom of this
  business. You stay here, Memsambo, and if you see any more of your old
  friends prowling about, just turn that handle. We're going up to the
  hut."</p>

  <p>Barwick spoke quietly enough, but there was rage in his heart and a
  lambent flame in his eye as he strode across the beach in the direction of
  the hut, followed by Cutting. Inside, in the gloom, they could make out an
  emaciated figure lying on the mat in the entrance, with a Winchester rifle
  grasped in a hand as skinny as a bird's claw, and as Barwick looked down upon
  the human wreck prostrate there, he knew that he was face to face with Oppner
  again.</p>

         title="He knew that he was face to face with Oppner again.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I've got back, you see."</p>

  <p>"So I observe," the German said drily. "It doesn't matter. I'm a dying
  man, Barwick, and I can't last another week. I'm full of fever. My medicine
  and quinine are all gone, and the strain has taken all the life out of me.
  We're down to our last handful of cartridges, and those demons know it. You
  can kill me, if you like&mdash;I almost wish you would."</p>

  <p>"You served me a scurvy trick," Barwick said sternly. "I suppose you
  planned this from the first?"</p>

  <p>"It was for my country," Oppner said. "You should not have patented your
  invention in Germany. If you had known the War was going to break out, I
  don't suppose you would. But we knew, and we watched, so that nothing should
  escape us that was likely to be useful to my country."</p>

  <p>"And you are not ashamed of yourself?" Barwick asked.</p>

  <p>"Ashamed? Why should I be? Ah, you English are different from us&mdash;you
  will never understand our German mentality."</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind that!" Barwick said angrily. "I ought to know, for I have
  had over two years in that accursed country of yours; but they got nothing
  out of me."</p>

  <p>"So?" Oppner smiled. "Then why so bitter? Ah, I knew you would come back.
  That is why I managed to repair the machinery and reconstruct that formula of
  yours, which I did after a year's work on it. I knew you would come back and
  be my partner again, and forget what a patriot did for his country, because
  this is a big thing of ours, and there is a fortune for us yet. Then the War
  is over&mdash;it must be, or you would not be back here&mdash;the War is
  over, and Germany is mistress of the world!"</p>

  <p>"Say, where have you been sleeping?" Cutting drawled. "Mean to say that
  you've heard nothing, boss?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word for two years," Oppner said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, the War is over," Barwick laughed, "and I can afford to forgive
  you now, because Germany is beaten to the world. Her fleet is in an English
  port, the Mad Dog of Europe that you used to call the Kaiser is a fugitive in
  Holland, and a million of Allied troops are occupying German territory. Oh,
  yes, the War's over right enough, with a republic in Berlin, and your people
  thankful for the food we send them. And because of that, and because you have
  done me no real harm, after all, I am going to show you what an Englishman is
  capable of."</p>

  <p>But Oppner, lying there, said never a word. They fed him and tended him
  for the next few days, during which time he never spoke, and at the end of
  the week they buried him deep under a grove of mangoes, after which they went
  back to the hut in silence. It was Cutting who uttered Oppner's epitaph.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the poor beggar had a soul somewhere," he said, "but the
  beastly thing they used to call <i>Kultur</i> has stifled it. We're a
  forgiving lot, Barwick, and that's a fact. And now let's get back to business
  again."</p><br>

     name="story8">8.&mdash;THE WITNESS</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY FRANK GILLETT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. LI, Feb 1920, pp
  233-238</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MAINTREE sat on the balcony overlooking the compound, trying
  in vain to piece the puzzle together and evolve something logical and
  convincing out of the chaos. Out there in the compound the blistering sun, in
  a heaven of brass, shone down on the dry grass and withered vegetation, for
  it was the hot season of the year, and everything wilted under the merciless
  heat of the afternoon. There was no sign of life anywhere, except that now
  and again a tired sentry dragged himself across the grass and disappeared at
  intervals into the shadow.</p>

  <p>For Maintree was a prisoner, detained there in that barren compound on the
  frontier until such time as he could be committed for trial by the Resident
  Magistrate and sent down country to appear before the Superior Court.</p>

  <p>He had breakfasted more or less in solitary state, and for some hours had
  been sitting there, trying to see his way out of the maze of circumstantial
  evidence that the prosecution was weaving about his feet. And the more he
  thought of it, the less he liked contemplation of the future, for, indeed,
  everything was against him.</p>

  <p>The mere fact that he had not killed Stooke had nothing whatever to do
  with it. The prosecution said he had, and, what was more to the point, they
  appeared to have a good deal of evidence in proof of the charge. To begin
  with, Maintree was known to have been on exceedingly bad terms with the tea
  planter; they had had at least two violent quarrels, and on one occasion, in
  the presence of witnesses, they had come to blows. For the purposes of the
  case it mattered nothing that Stooke had treated Maintree exceedingly badly.
  It was quite immaterial that Stooke had had a sinister reputation in the
  neighbourhood, and that, putting the case at its very best, he had been an
  exceptionally sharp man of business. In point of fact, he had done Maintree
  out of his garden in an almost barefaced and cynical fashion. He had taken
  advantage of the fact that the latter was something of a visionary and a
  dreamer, given over to scientific and natural pursuits, to the great
  detriment of his prospects. But this was in itself a proof of malice against
  Maintree.</p>

  <p>He had parted with his garden under duress, and his prospects had been
  very bad indeed but for the fact that, just after the transaction was
  completed, a distant relative in England had left him a fortune. But this had
  come too late to prevent friction between the two men and an openly
  -expressed threat on Maintree's part to do Stooke a mischief if ever the
  opportunity should come his way.</p>

  <p>In the course of time Maintree had turned out of his holding and had found
  some sort of a habitation in a more or less dilapidated bungalow on the Delhi
  road. And here he busied himself, pending his return to England, with his
  collection of moths and butterflies, which was, by common consent, the best
  of its kind in India. The thing might have been forgotten altogether, when it
  suddenly loomed large in the gossip of the district again by reason of the
  finding of Stooke's body lying just off the roadway, the unfortunate man
  having evidently been killed by a shot fired at close quarters from an
  ordinary sporting weapon. Stooke had evidently been killed instantly; his
  left side was badly torn, and the watch he was wearing penetrated by a shot
  or two, which had caused the little timepiece to stop at twenty-five minutes
  past three. This was held, very properly, to fix the time of the crime, and
  though Stooke had many enemies, especially amongst his employees, the
  district made up its mind at once that this was the work of Maintree. He had
  been seen in argument with the dead man not long before, his shot-gun was
  missing, and, when inquiries were made, Maintree professed to have lost it.
  Nor could he satisfactorily account for the time between the hour when he was
  seen talking to Stooke and the moment when he returned to his own bungalow to
  tea. Investigations were set on foot, with the result that Maintree had been
  arrested and brought before a magistrate on two occasions. On the last of
  these he had been remanded for a week, and to-morrow would see him before the
  Bench again, probably for the last time before he was committed for trial. It
  appeared to be a hopeless case from the first, and gradually and surely
  Maintree was coming to the same conclusion.</p>

  <p>He was waiting now to see his lawyer with regard to one or two points
  which the latter wanted to place before the court on the morrow. Presently
  the gate of the compound opened and Maintree's advocate made his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you got any further?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Maintree shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I am just as mystified as you are. But I never touched
  Stooke."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we have got to convince the magistrate of it. Now, let's talk
  this matter over as if we were detached from it altogether. Somebody killed
  Stooke. You have no doubt whatever about that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," Maintree said; "that's admitted."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Stooke was killed with a shot-gun well within an hour of
  being seen in conversation with you. There was bad blood between you, and you
  threatened him with violence on more than one occasion."</p>

  <p>"I did, the swine!" Maintree muttered.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you don't see the significance of that admission. It's evidence
  of motive, and that counts for a good deal, let me tell you. Stooke was
  killed with a sporting gun using the same shot that you use yourself. You may
  contend that scores of men here use exactly the same shot, but that doesn't
  help you much. And when you are asked to produce your gun, you say you don't
  know where it is. That's a lot to ask a magistrate to believe."</p>

  <p>"But it's true, all the same," Maintree said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but, man alive, how did you lose it? Even an absent-minded beggar
  like yourself can't lose a valuable sporting gun without knowing anything
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was like this," Maintree said. "I had a few words with Stooke,
  mostly sarcastic, but we parted without any violence. He went along the main
  road, and I turned into the deep path between the cane brake and the water
  ponds, so that I was hidden from view. I was going round that way to the
  bungalow because I had heard a rumour from one of the natives to the effect
  that he had seen a laced-wing butterfly."</p>

  <p>"Oh, go on," Denton said wearily. "Can't you forget those wretched
  butterflies for the moment?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, perhaps it is more important than you think," Maintree said. "I
  didn't believe what the man said, because there hasn't been a laced-wing
  butterfly taken in these parts for over thirty years. I don't suppose there
  are half a dozen of them left in India. But you never can tell. I went that
  way because I knew that, if there was one of those moths to be seen, it would
  be somewhere near water. You may not know it, but the laced-wing is never
  seen except between two and four. And I found one&mdash; I found one. I
  dropped my gun, and I must have chased the insect for the best part of three
  miles before I caught him. And I can show him to you now, if you like."</p>

  <p>Denton waved the suggestion aside.</p>

  <p>"I took my prize home, and then I went back for my gun. I couldn't find
  it."</p>

  <p>"Of course you couldn't," Denton said. "Picked up by some thieving native,
  no doubt. Now, I believe all this, but you'll never get a magistrate to. Oh,
  come, Maintree, can't you see what a tight place you are in? If what you tell
  me can be proved by any independent witness, then we can establish the fact
  that you were some miles away from the scene of the crime at the moment
  Stooke died. We can establish that that took place about half-past three from
  the unshakable evidence of the damaged watch. Did you meet anybody on the
  way?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Maintree said.</p>

  <p>"Then why on earth didn't you tell me that before? Who was it you met?
  Some neighbour?"</p>

  <p>"No; a man I have never seen before. He came upon me quite suddenly just
  after I had secured the butterfly. I was spreading the insect out and
  mounting it on a sheet of cork, when somebody hailed me. I was so busy with
  the work that I never heard the man come up. It's a very lonely bit of road,
  you know, and as those pools are supposed to be haunted, no native ever
  willingly goes that way. I was squatting on the ground, pinning out my
  butterfly, when the stranger in question spoke to me. I looked up and saw a
  man seated on the back of a flea-bitten grey pony&mdash;a little man with a
  keen, clean-shaven face and a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles. He looked like
  a good-humoured, amusing sort of chap who, I should say, would be very good
  company. He was very friendly, and quite free and easy in his manner. A man
  of about sixty, more or less. He asked me what I had found, and I told him.
  He was very interested, because he told me he was a bit of a collector or
  something of that sort, and he had never seen a laced-wing before. He didn't
  believe they any longer existed. I gathered from what he said that he was a
  stranger in these parts, probably on a visit to some planter; but we didn't
  go into that, and he volunteered no further details. He asked me a great many
  questions connected with butterflies, and I suppose we must have been
  chatting together for a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"What time would that be?" Denton asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, after three, anyhow. I knew that by the position of the sun.
  And these are things that I do understand."</p>

  <p>"Then you didn't get the man's name?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't, worse luck. But of course I should know him again&mdash;I
  should know that keen, thin face anywhere."</p>

  <p>Denton paused in thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>"This is very important," he said, "very important. If what you say is
  correct, and you can find that man, then you can walk out of the court-house
  to-morrow free. You'll have to appear before a deputy magistrate, because
  Shelton is laid up and has gone up to the hills for a week, and another man
  is coming down from headquarters to take his place. He's a fine chap. Very
  different to the Resident Magistrate&mdash; a real fine lawyer with a mind of
  his own. But never mind about that. What we have got to do now is to find
  this chap we speak about. I get about a good deal, but I don't know a single
  planter within fifty miles who has any outsider staying with him just now.
  It's a very slim chance, Maintree. It looks to me as if your man was passing
  through, and if he doesn't happen to catch sight of the account of your
  trial&mdash;well "</p>

  <p>Denton shrugged his shoulders eloquently.</p>

  <p>"The funny thing is," Maintree went on, "that I do know his name, but, for
  the life of me, I can't think of it. He was showing me a fly he had captured,
  and in taking out his pocket-book he dropped it. I picked it up, and saw the
  name in gold letters on the outside. It was marked J.E. something or other. A
  strange thing that one cannot think of a name like that, and yet I can
  remember the initials perfectly. It was a peculiar name, too, and one I never
  heard before."</p>

  <p>Maintree rambled on in that quick, nervous fashion of his under the cold,
  scrutinising eye of his advocate. He knew perfectly well that Denton was
  listening to him with more than suspicion&mdash;in fact, though he did not
  say so, he was coming to the conclusion that his client was trying to deceive
  him. And Maintree could not feel angry about it. either. He knew that, had
  the positions been reversed, his point of view would have been much the same
  as Denton's.</p>

  <p>"Very strange indeed," Denton said drily. "Of course the thing's
  impossible. But it isn't myself you have to convince, but a magistrate, who
  will go entirely on evidence. He won't be prejudiced either way. It may be in
  your favour that you are appearing before one of the best men in India; on
  the other hand, it may not. My dear fellow, you must see how terribly
  appearances are against you. I should be lacking in my duty if I didn't point
  this out,</p>

  <p>I don't want to labour the point and go over the old ground again, but if
  we could only find that gun of yours, it would be something. However, I'll do
  the best I can."</p>

  <p>With this cold comfort Denton went his way, leaving Maintree to his own
  gloomy thoughts. He sat there on the verandah, looking out across the dreary
  compound, trying once more to find some suggestion of light in the darkness.
  And he was none the less unhappy because he had told Denton no more than the
  truth. Had the whole story been a fabrication of lies, he would have been far
  easier in his mind. The mere fact that he was telling the truth only served
  to weigh the more heavily upon him.</p>

  <p>He could see it all before him now quite plainly. He could see the sly
  malice in Stooke's eyes and the smile of triumph on his thin lips. He could
  remember every word that passed between them, and he could have written it
  down verbatim. He had turned his back upon the man who had robbed him, and
  then he had gone down the road between the brake and the chain of
  water-pools, boiling with rage and filled with the hatred of contempt for the
  man who had swindled him. He could remember that even then, distracted as he
  was, his thoughts had reverted to the story which the native had told him
  with regard to the laced-wing butterfly, and how even at that moment he had
  found himself wondering if he would be fortunate enough to come across one.
  Not that he had been in the least sanguine, because to his certain knowledge
  no specimen of that gorgeous purple-and-gold insect had been secured for the
  past thirty years. And just as he had come to this conclusion, behold, a
  brilliant object rose from the centre of the brake and fluttered in all its
  panoply of gorgeous colouring over his head.</p>

  <p>He remembered dropping his gun and starting in instant pursuit, but for
  the life of him, afterwards, he could not recollect the spot at which he had
  abandoned his weapon. And then the chase had begun. It had been a long and
  weary business, one moment in the brake, and the next knee-deep in one of the
  pools, a hot and sweating struggle which had ended, the best part of an hour
  later, in the capture of the prize. And this was the fateful hour that
  Maintree had to prove as one in which he had not been anywhere near the
  neighbourhood of his enemy. He had secured the butterfly at length at a point
  quite three miles from where, about that moment, Stooke had been lying dead,
  and a witness of the fact had appeared just at the psychological moment."</p>

  <p>Yes, it was the exact moment, as Maintree remembered now. The grey-haired,
  clean-shaven man in the gold-rimmed spectacles had asked him the time. He
  replied casually enough, without looking at his watch, that it wanted
  something to half-past three&mdash;a fact which seemed to surprise the
  stranger, who inquired how it was that Maintree was so certain. He replied
  that he had made a study of such things, and, indeed, this was a fact,
  because there was little in the way of Nature that Maintree did not
  understand. He had indicated the position of the sun, and the length of
  shadows falling from the thick brake, and apparently the stranger had been
  satisfied, for he smiled and casually remarked that that was one of the sort
  of things that everybody ought to know.</p>

  <p>Then they had fallen to chatting generally, and the man on the grey horse
  had produced his pocket-book, from which he extracted an insect which was
  unfamiliar to him, and which he asked Maintree to name. The latter had done
  so without the slightest hesitation, and it was at this point that the
  stranger dropped his pocket-book. In picking it up and returning it Maintree
  had noticed the neat gold lettering on the cover of the pigskin case. The
  initials " J.E." stood out in his mind now in symbols of flame. He was as
  sure of them as he was of his own identity, and yet, for the life of him, he
  could not remember what the rest was. And, indeed, it was in the interest of
  his own life that he was sitting there, with his head in his hands, trying to
  sweat it out.</p>

  <p>Now, what was that remarkable name? It was not particularly long or
  intricate in the way of spelling; on the contrary, it was the sort of name
  that tripped readily off the tongue when once the mind had grasped it&mdash;
  a compact, business-like sort of word, which seemed to Maintree at the time
  to fit the identity of the owner like a glove. And yet, though he sat there
  till darkness began to shut down and it was time to go back to his narrow
  quarters, no sign of illumination came to him.</p>

  <p>So far as Maintree could see, there was no getting out in that direction.
  Unless some blind luck came his way, he was never likely to look upon the
  face of that amiable stranger again. No doubt he was someone passing
  through&mdash;a travelling inspector, perhaps, a district superintendent, or
  maybe somebody doing the work of somebody else.</p>

  <p>No doubt by this time he was hundreds of miles away&mdash;perhaps in a
  different part of India altogether&mdash;and unless by chance he came across
  the account of the trial in one of the papers, he might never know that the
  life of a fellow-creature was in his hands. And even if he did see the
  report, it was long odds against his connecting it with the casual
  acquaintance on the roadside who had discovered a rare butterfly, unless,
  indeed, Denton could see his way to make the laced-wing butterfly a prominent
  feature of the case, on the desperate chance of the fact being brought before
  the eyes of the man with the gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>And so the hot and weary night dragged on, till morning came, and with it
  Denton once again.</p>

  <p>He was no more sanguine than he had been the night before. He listened to
  all that Maintree had to say, and, without enthusiasm, agreed to the latter's
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Well, it can't do any harm," he said, "and it may attract the attention
  of the man you speak about. But it will take time. You will probably be
  committed for trial this morning, and conveyed down country to a civilian
  gaol. The delay is all in your favour, but it's a mighty slim chance."</p>

  <p>"I know that," Maintree said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll do my best. Your case comes on at ten o'clock, and I'll be at
  court at that hour."</p>

  <p>Ten o'clock came, and with it a sergeant and his file, acting as civilian
  police for the time being. The sergeant was well enough known to
  Maintree&mdash;a sporting West of England man, who had had more than one
  day's shooting on Maintree's property. But he was no longer the civil
  individual he had been, but a gaoler now, who had evidently made up his mind
  as to how the case was going. Quite curtly and without prefix, he ordered his
  prisoner to follow him. This was the first indication to Maintree of how his
  own little world regarded the position in which he stood. It was something in
  the way of a shock, but Maintree smiled steadily as he followed.</p>

  <p>He found himself presently in a bare whitewashed room with a long
  ink-splashed - table, at which native and other advocates sat, and behind
  this a raised platform with a big chair in the centre, and over it the Royal
  monogram. It was a rude court of justice, after all, but it served the
  purpose.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the little knot of people round the table, the
  court-house was empty. As yet the legal luminary who was taking the place of
  the Resident Magistrate had not taken his seat, and Maintree had a little
  time to look about him. He stood in the dock now, with the stolid sergeant by
  his side. He was wondering what had become of Denton. He was wondering, too,
  why no curious neighbour or old acquaintance had put in an appearance. No one
  had seemed to rally round him, and, on the contrary, no one seemed to care to
  listen. Perhaps they had already made up their minds as to what was. going to
  happen, and thought it would be more decent to stay away.</p>

  <p>Then a little door behind the gallery opened, and a man dressed in
  spotless white bustled in. As he took his seat. Maintree's lower jaw dropped,
  and he stared at the newcomer as if he were looking at a ghost. In that
  instant, with something strangely familiar dancing about before his eyes, his
  mind, by some unconscious process, leapt with the word that had been haunting
  and eluding him all night.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Braddock " he said.</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, conscious of what he was saying, and perhaps
  conscious, too, of the incongruity of it. Who was Braddock, and why did he
  use that word? Just for a moment he was too confused to understand. And yet
  Braddock was the right word&mdash;he knew it in his bones.</p>

  <p>"'Ere, drop that," the sergeant said. "Remember where you are!"</p>

  <p>A jolt in Maintree's ribs brought him to himself.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," he stammered. "No disrespect to the court or Mr.
  Braddock."</p>

  <p>"Sir John Braddock," the sergeant said gruffly.</p>

  <p>Something of this seemed to catch the ears of the man on the bench, for he
  looked keenly in the direction of the dock. Then the eyes of judge and
  prisoner met, and a gleam of recognition passed between them.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul!" said the man on the bench. "Why, it's the man who caught
  the butterfly!. "</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9">9.&mdash;THE BROKEN TRAIL</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY MAURICE GREIFFENHAGEN</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. LI, Apr 1920, pp
  441-447</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE hideous nightmare was beginning to recede into a
  nebulous mist of sea and land and sky, all mixed up in a spelter of returning
  consciousness, and Denholm was just faintly aware that M'Bisi was speaking to
  him. He had been dreaming of cool rippling water and the gurgle of a brown
  trout stream, and the sudden jolt into life seemed to shock him with a
  physical pain.</p>

  <p>"The trail," M'Bisi whispered, "the trail, master!"</p>

  <p>Denholm roused himself at last. He opened his bloodshot eyes and saw that
  the gloom of the trackless forest was no longer there. They had emerged into
  a sort of clearing, thick enough under foot, but from which the trees had
  been removed, and from somewhere in the distance came the unmistakable sound
  of running water. Denholm could not see it&mdash;indeed, he was almost past
  seeing anything&mdash;but M'Bisi, the faithful Wamba chief, had been smelling
  this fresh water for the last hour past, and that was what had kept him
  going. Those big limbs of his bent beneath him now, and the deep wide chest
  was labouring painfully, for M'Bisi had been carrying his master on his back
  for two strenuous, sweating miles.</p>

  <p>They had come this way on the advice of M'Bisi, who knew the country like
  an open book, for he had been born here, and there had been a time when he
  had been a Wamba chief, commanding five hundred spears. But that was before
  the War came, and the Germans in the colony had led all his best young men
  into captivity, and had turned them into soldiers, to their great hurt and
  the glory of the Fatherland. But M'Bisi was wise in his generation; he knew
  the British and trusted them, and he was ever on their side. He had been on
  their side for more years than he could count. He knew their ways, and the
  slang of the British Tommy, so that his speech was a quaint mixture of
  dignified vernacular and English idiom picked up amongst the lads in
  khaki.</p>

  <p>But all that is by the way for the moment. The War was over, and the
  colony was at peace. And, once this had happened, Denholm got himself
  demobilised and went up country in search of Professor Sparling and his
  daughter Maud.</p>

  <p>It is, perhaps, necessary to explain at this point how the learned
  Professor and his only child found themselves, at the beginning of
  hostilities, behind the German lines; but the Professor, who was an
  enthusiast in his way, had gone up country as far as Aganda, where he had
  established Maud and himself at the French mission house. When the bolt had
  fallen from the blue, it was too late to get back across the border, and,
  incidentally, the Professor was too useful a man for the German command to
  part with. He was a master in the art of applied mechanics, and, as such, the
  foe kept him busy. News had come of the Professor and his daughter from time
  to time, from which it appeared that they were not at all badly treated, and
  that sooner or later they hoped to reach Cape Colony. And so things went on
  for the best part of two years.</p>

  <p>More than once Denholm had information through the medium of M'Bisi, one
  of the finest scouts in the employ of the South African Army. He had
  penetrated on two occasions three hundred miles through the scrub, and had
  brought back once, at any rate, a precious letter in Maud's handwriting. She
  had come out to Cape Town from an English school, just before the outbreak of
  war, a pretty, attractive girl of nineteen, and Denholm had fallen in love
  with her on the spot. There had been nothing said on his side, but there was
  a perfect understanding between the young people, and when Maud went up
  country for a holiday with her father, she wore round her neck a thin gold
  chain that Denholm had given her as a keepsake. He would see the Professor,
  he told himself, after the latter's holiday was over, and till
  then&mdash;</p>

  <p>Ah, well, much water had run under the bridges since then. The War had
  broken out, and for the next two years or more Denholm had plenty to occupy
  his attention. He hoped ever for the best, and, now that the conflict was
  over, another great adventure lay before him. For nothing had been heard of
  the Professor and Maud in the meantime. They seemed to have utterly vanished
  off the face of the earth, just before an almost decisive battle had been
  fought, somewhere near the French mission house at Aganda, and after that the
  German forces had fallen back over three hundred miles. They had fallen back
  so far that it was hardly worth while pursuing them.</p>

  <p>But had they taken the Professor and his daughter with them? Denholm asked
  himself. Certainly nothing had been heard of either of them since then. If
  they had gone along, something must have been heard of them by this time;
  but, on the other hand, they might have hung back, hoping to be picked up by
  the advance guard of the British colonists. And so the months went on, till
  Denholm made up his mind to set out and see for himself. It had been a hard
  time for both himself and the faithful M'Bisi, and more than once they had
  lost the trail. The coming of the War had made all the difference in the
  world to those forest paths, for there were no longer traders and tribesmen
  coming and going, and the tropical vegetation grows fast. Before they finally
  emerged within gunshot of the ruined French mission house, they had spent
  almost their last cartridge, and they had been reduced more than once to the
  killing of pigeons and the drinking of blood to slake their thirst. But now
  here they were, within sight of water, fresh and cool from a mountain stream,
  spent and exhausted to the last breath, and with yet another danger almost
  within grasp of their hand.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do, M'Bisi?" Denholm asked. "What about that
  precious cousin of yours&mdash;Lomboso? You know who I mean&mdash;the chap
  who claims sovereignty over all you people."</p>

  <p>M'Bisi spat with a gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>"A low-down nigger that," he said. "We come to him presently. He fight
  first on one side, and then on the other, and so save his black skin, but he
  tell us things. Bet you dollar he know all about Professor and the white
  lady."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's go and hunt him up," Denholm suggested. "No, stop, I must
  think this over. For the love of Mike, go and get me a drink. I shall go mad
  if I don't have something to drink, and I can hear it sort of mocking me, old
  son."</p>

  <p>M'Bisi came back in a moment with a rusty pan he had picked up, and
  Denholm buried his head in the cool, delicious water. It made a new man of
  him; it brought the sparkle to his eye, and the eager look to his face, and,
  better than that, it brought back that Irish humour of his that was one of
  his saving glories.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's better!" he gasped. "Say, where did you get that swell tin
  from?"</p>

  <p>M'Bisi proceeded to explain that they were on the scene of the decisive
  battlefield, and that the thick, luxurious undergrowth was full of the spoils
  of war. And, indeed, every turn of M'Bisi's foot brought up something, a cap,
  a broken rifle, an empty meat tin, everything that reeked of war.</p>

  <p>"It's like a sort of comic nightmare," Denholm went on. "But look here,
  M'Bisi, if we are to interview that swell cousin of yours, we must brush up a
  bit. Get out my safety razor and the soap, and I'll make myself fit to
  approach the throne. And hadn't we better wash and patch up these ragged old
  ducks of mine a bit? And what are you going to say to your relative when you
  meet?"</p>

  <p>"He thunderin' bad lot," M'Bisi said in that queer vernacular of his. "He
  not alone, either. Twenty spears, perhaps, follow him. He stay here, hoping
  to make Wamba a big people again, and if he catch us like this, he'll cut off
  our heads sure."</p>

  <p>"That's not on our programme," Denholm said drily. "But I see what you
  mean. What we've got to do is to put up a big bluff. Swank in on them, with a
  rifle on our shoulders and our bandoliers full of any old thing that looks
  like ammunition. I don't suppose, after all this long time, that Lomboso has
  a bean in the way of a cartridge. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, master," M'Bisi said. "For last night, when you slept, I made
  my way to the kraal, and, behold, there is not a rifle there that has been
  fired for months. I have them in my hand, and I know."</p>

  <p>"That's the game," said Denholm enthusiastically. "We swank in and offer
  your rotter of a cousin a few hundred rounds of cartridges for the
  information he can give us. Now, then, where is the palace of this
  potentate?"</p>

  <p>M'Bisi waved his hand comprehensively.</p>

  <p>"It is there," he said, " that Lomboso makes his camp. Behold the smoke
  above the trees, and it is there that the mission house stood where I last
  saw the white Professor and the lady who gave me that letter for you, many
  moons ago, quite twice as many moons as I have fingers on my hand. And
  Lomboso, who was friends with the Germans, so long as they give him money, he
  can tell us, perhaps, where the white Professor is to-day."</p>

  <p>"That's the game!" Denholm cried. "Now let's have a wash and brush up, and
  then we'll go and pay our respects to the mighty man who rules over
  Wamba."</p>

  <p>It was something of a job to get Denholm's rags patched and washed, and a
  somewhat painful process to cleanse his face by means of the butt-end of a
  stick of shaving soap and a safety razor that had grown grey in the service.
  But it was all finished at length, and, with a bold front and a certain fear
  at their hearts, Denholm and his companion marched up to the big kraal where
  they knew that Lomboso was in residence. There was something more than fear
  in their hearts&mdash;there was deadly exhaustion from want of food&mdash;but
  there was nothing of this to be seen as they faced Lomboso, who grinned
  unpleasantly at his relative, and at the same time flourished a rifle with
  some display of ostentation. Then followed a few words in the language of the
  tribe, that Denholm could not quite follow. It was M'Bisi who came presently
  to the subject that was nearest to Denholm's heart.</p>

  <p>"Behold, my brother," M'Bisi said, "we come here looking for that which is
  lost, and you shall help us, Lomboso, and we will reward you, for we have
  many things in the bush, and food for the guns-that-never-stop to last you
  through the hunting season, for we know that you have no food for the
  fire-sticks."</p>

  <p>This was more or less a bow drawn at a venture, but the shaft went home,
  as M'Bisi could see from the uneasy glitter in the eyes of Lomboso.</p>

  <p>"We come to look for the great white Professor and his daughter," he went
  on. "You will tell us where they are, because you know. Now, you give us food
  and a kraal wherein to sleep, and many presents we shall bring you."</p>

  <p>Lomboso grinned again, the grin of the wolf when he appeared to Red Riding
  Hood. He stood there, a huge, glittering ebony figure in the sunlight, naked
  as the day that he was born, save for a loin-cloth constructed from a suit of
  pyjamas looted from somewhere, his only ornament a thin gold chain from which
  dangled a glittering gold coin that Denholm's eyes recognised as an English
  sovereign. With a sudden idea in the back of his mind, he approached Lomboso
  almost timidly and touched the gold disc with his forefinger.</p>

  <p>"A great fetish?" he asked. "Where did you get him from, Lomboso?"</p>

  <p>Lomboso smiled with a suggestion of his superiority.</p>

  <p>"Behold, it comes to me from the hand of a white magician," he grinned.
  "With it I can make fire, and the water in the river to run up hill. Many
  moons ago, before the great War, and the squareheads took our men into
  captivity, the magician gave um to me It is the greatest magic in the world."
  "You are right there," Denholm said drily, as he regarded the sovereign. "It
  it the biggest magic in the world, if you have got enough of it."</p>

  <p>"And there is more in the great box," Lomboso went on&mdash;"the great box
  that the magician took out of the fireship. And he put in it all the Juju,
  and he took the firestick that runs red and turns to water when the flame
  touches it. And this he placed in certain holes in the box, and put on them
  the sign of his Juju, saying that he who touches the red sign of Juju
  dies."</p>

  <p>All this with a melancholy air and a longing look in Lomboso 's eyes. He
  was evidently quite sincere in what he said, and he was telling Denholm a
  great deal more than he intended. For the latter had almost forgotten the
  deadly peril in which he and M'Bisi stood in the illumination of that moment.
  He allowed the desultory talk to proceed on the subject of food and lodging,
  and the suggestion that, in return, Lomboso should be supplied with the
  ammunition that he so sorely lacked. So they parted presently, amiably enough
  outwardly, whilst Denholm and M'Bisi proceeded in the direction of the kraal
  which had been allotted to them, and where they fed almost ravenously on a
  bowl of seething kid's flesh. It was not till they had finished and their
  pipes were lighted that Denholm spoke again.</p>

  <p>"That's a good bluff," he said. "And it came of all right, too. Your
  relative is a pretty picturesque liar, M'Bisi. I suppose you happened to see
  what he had round his neck?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, master, a quid," M'Bisi said promptly.</p>

  <p>"That's right, my son," Denholm smiled. "And you heard what he said about
  it. Now, look here, M'Bisi, that coin was made the year war broke out,
  because there is a sign on it that tells me so. Now, why did he lie about the
  time he had had it?"</p>

  <p>"Because he no want you to know, master, and because he steal him from the
  white Professor."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a pretty shrewd guess. But tell me, did you notice the chain
  as well?"</p>

  <p>"Seen him before," M'Bisi grinned. "See him that time, long since, when I
  came and saw the white Professor and the beautiful lady. Then she was wearing
  it round her neck."</p>

  <p>"Correct, as usual," Denholm said. "You are quite right. That chain was
  stolen from Miss Sparling, and I have no doubt that the sovereign was stolen,
  too. But what's all this talk about a box? You heard what that rascally
  relative of yours said&mdash;a black box that the Professor sealed with
  sealing wax and stamped with his signet ring. Of course it was the Professor;
  it couldn't have been anybody else. And you might enlighten me as to what the
  dickens Lomboso meant by talking about a fireship. What fireship? You don't
  mean to say there is anything in that legend to the effect that the Germans
  got a Zeppelin here early in 1917? I thought nobody believed in that silly
  story."</p>

  <p>"It is a true tale, master," M'Bisi said solemnly, "because I saw him. He
  came down close here, the time when I came up to find the Professor for you,
  and, because there was a great storm, they could not float the fireship
  again. The big storm, he was swept by lightning, and I will show him to you
  presently."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the dickens you will," Denholm exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, even <i>I</i>," M'Bisi said, striking his mighty chest dramatically.
  "We will go there when the moon rises, and I will show you the body of the
  great fireship, like a whale that is stranded on a beach. And I will show you
  the black box that Lomboso spoke of, with the seals on him; but you not
  touch, because what Lomboso says is a true thing. I know, because it has come
  to me, down in the forest, and it is just what Lomboso say, Because Shini,
  who is one of Lomboso's boys, he try to get into the magic box, and
  lightnings come out, and, behold, he is no more than a cinder."</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" Denholm cried. "Amazing! And yet I don't know. Upon my word, it
  doesn't seem so complicated, after all. It's another bluff, M'Bisi, a bluff
  like this. The Professor is here, almost within our grasp, and when we find
  him, as we must, I am sure he will bear me out. Now, according to your story,
  soon after the fireship came, a big decisive battle was fought here, and the
  Germans were scattered. That was practically the end of the campaign. Lomboso
  and his boys guessed that, so they hung back here, and the Professor hung
  back, too. It was he who gave Lomboso the sovereign and placed the rest of
  his money in that ammunition box. It must be an ammunition box, because it
  sounds just like it. You see, the Professor is a pretty shrewd man, and he
  never lacked pluck. When he found himself left alone here with Lomboso, he
  recognised the fact that his life was in danger, so he put up a bluff. He
  locked the money away in that box and sealed it. Just sealing wax, but it was
  enough to impress Lomboso. Can't you see what's happening? Here is Lomboso
  just aching to get hold of the rest of those sovereigns that he calls Juju,
  and no doubt making the Professor all sorts of promises if he will take the
  spell off the box. And Professor Sparling knows perfectly well that, if he
  does anything so foolish, his life won't be worth an hour's purchase. Lomboso
  would have no mercy on him; but, so long as the magic works, then Lomboso is
  prepared to play a game of patience. It's a game of patience on both
  sides."</p>

  <p>"It is a true speech that you make, master," M'Bisi said. "And we have
  come just in time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all very well," said Denholm impatiently. "But there are only
  two of us, and we haven't got a cartridge between us. Now, unless I am
  greatly mistaken, that magic box is just bursting with them. What we've got
  to do is to break it open, because, if those boys of Lomboso's find out the
  truth, then we are done. And I should hate to fail at the very last moment,
  and when I come to think of the Professor and his daughter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Denholm broke off hastily. M'Bisi smiled.</p>

  <p>"You think those boys follow Lomboso?" he asked. "Yes, perhaps so long as
  they are afraid of him and the magic of the Juju. But if we break that, and I
  say the word, will they follow him long, long way to Tipperary? You put your
  shirt on it that they don't. They follow me, their natural chief."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's like that, is it?" Denholm asked. "Well, I'm in your hands,
  M'Bisi, but I hold the key, all the same."</p>

  <p>It was getting late, and the moon was rising over the woods when Denholm
  and his companion crept out of their kraal and across the opening till they
  came to a bare space in the trees where a mountain stream flowed into the
  lake. Here, beyond all doubt, a big fight had been fought, for the ground was
  littered with broken weapons, and machine-gun belts, to say nothing of
  articles of clothing. Almost at Denholm 's feet was a battered bugle, which
  he picked up and looked at longingly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I could play it," he muttered. "I used to be rather a dab on
  the bugle when I was at Charterhouse."</p>

  <p>"Better not, master," M'Bisi suggested. "They are in the woods now; I can
  hear them moving about. Behold!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, M'Bisi pointed to the wreck of a gigantic Zeppelin, the bare
  ribs of which were marked against the great moon like the timbers of some
  derelict ship. It was a most amazing and impressive sight, and Denholm
  regarded it with thrilling interest.</p>

  <p>"Then it was true, after all," he murmured. "We never believed it at
  headquarters. It's a thundering fine sight, M'Bisi. But never mind that. What
  I am really interested in is the black box. Now, how did you find it?"</p>

  <p>"It was last night, when you were asleep, master," M'Bisi explained. "I
  crept from our hiding-place, because I had heard the story, and I wanted to
  know. This way."</p>

  <p>A few yards off M'Bisi parted the bushes, and there, sure enough, lay a
  black steel-banded ammunition box, turned over on its side, and in the broad
  light of the moon Denholm could see a big splash of scarlet on the hasp of
  the lock, and one on each side where the hinges fell. It was light enough to
  see that the initials "J.S." were imprinted on the red wax. M'Bisi would have
  touched it with his hand, had not Denholm drawn him hastily back.</p>

  <p>"You are a dead man if you handle that!" he whispered hoarsely. "Listen!
  Can't you hear Juju calling?"</p>

  <p>There was a faint purring from a little way off, just like the noise that
  a lion makes over his food. It went on steadily enough for some moments, and
  M'Bisi started back. With all his proud boast that the effete superstitions
  of his tribe were nothing to one who knew the ways of the white man, he was
  frightened. But not for long, for almost from under his feet there rose the
  dark form of Lomboso, with anger in his eyes and a spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What you do here?" he cried. "What you want with the magic of the white
  man? You no fear his anger? You no hear his voice? He will come presently and
  kill you!"</p>

  <p>With that, the infuriated Wamba drew back his arm, and Denholm could see
  that he had a spear in his grasp. It was no moment to hesitate, because a
  second later that spear would have been through M'Bisi's heart. Like a flash
  Denholm darted forward and brought his right arm round with a hook to the big
  man's jaw. The blow landed fairly and squarely, so that the spear fell from
  Lomboso's hand and he staggered back. A twisted root caught him by the heels,
  so that he fell right across the black box, with his cruel, contorted face
  turned upwards.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301071h-images/TheBrokenTrail.jpg"
         title="He fell right across the black box.">
  </div><br>

  <p>It was only for an instant, and then the miracle happened. With a piercing
  scream that woke the echoes in the wood, Lomboso collapsed and fell from the
  box on to the ground, nothing more than a mere handful of incinerated flesh
  and bone. There was a sickening "nauseous odour in the air, and then a
  silence that was unbroken by Denholm and his companion. M'Bisi was frankly
  frightened out of his life. He had never seen the effect of electrocution
  before, and even Denholm turned away with a sense of physical nausea.</p>

  <p>But it was only for a moment before he pulled himself together and
  realised what had happened. He was prepared for it, too, because from the
  first instant that that purring noise had smote upon his ear he had
  recognised it as the sound of a dynamo. And therefore someone was in the
  immediate neighbourhood, someone who was hiding there, and who must have had
  a practical acquaintance with applied mechanics, and who else could it
  possibly be but Professor Sparling?</p>

  <p>A certain thrill of exultation and delight, in the knowledge of this
  discovery, impelled Denholm to raise the bugle to his lips and essay a call
  upon it. He had not forgotten his old skill apparently, because the echo of
  "The Last Post" floated back pleasantly to his ears, and, almost before he
  had finished, a figure came climbing down the water-course that led to the
  lake&mdash;a figure apparently in a German uniform, that stood there
  regarding the intruders steadily. Denholm could see a grey beard flowing over
  the grey tunic.</p>

  <p>"One moment!" he cried. "Turn off that dynamo."</p>

  <p>"It's already done," a cool and collected voice replied. "Is that you,
  Denholm? Thank Heaven!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, that's all right," Denholm said. "But how about Maud&mdash;Miss
  Sparling? Is she safe?"</p>

  <p>"Quite safe, Jim," another voice came out of the darkness. "I always knew
  you'd come. I told father so all along. I told him, if you weren't killed,
  you would be certain to search for us."</p>

  <p>She emerged and stood beside her father, two queer figures, dressed in the
  field-grey uniform of German infantry. Denholm turned hastily to M'Bisi.</p>

  <p>"Now, get busy, my lad," he said. "Burst that box open and fill up the
  bandoliers. We may have those chaps round upon us at any moment. I've got
  something else to do."</p>

  <p>M'Bisi needed no second bidding. With the aid of Lomboso's spear he forced
  open the top of the case, and plunged his arms into the cartridges which had
  been stored there. Meanwhile Denholm was shaking hands warmly with the
  Professor, before he turned and looked into the eyes of the girl who had
  awaited him with such splendid confidence.</p>

  <p>"It's been a near thing, Maud," he said&mdash; "a precious near thing.
  When we blundered through last night, we were on the verge of starvation, and
  we hadn't a shot left; but we managed to bluff that ruffian Lomboso and his
  boys, and here we are. We shall be all right now, thanks to my friend M'Bisi.
  But I'll introduce you to him presently. I should never have got through
  without him, and what would have happened then, Heaven only knows."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's been a weary time," the Professor said, "and a matter of
  patience on both sides. You see, I managed to get hold of all the small
  ammunition the Germans left behind, and sealed it up in that box. The intact
  engines of the Zeppelin were a godsend to me. I managed to wire the box. But
  I see you know all about that. I suppose you guessed it when you heard the
  engines going. I'd like to have a few words with M'Bisi. Don't forget that he
  is quite an old friend of ours."</p>

  <p>With that the Professor crossed to where M'Bisi was filling up the
  bandoliers, and Denholm was left alone with Maud.</p>

  <p>"It must have been a dreadful time for you," he said tenderly.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't mind much," she said. "Only I wasn't quite sure whether you
  were alive or dead, and that was dreadful, Jim."</p>

  <p>Denholm smiled as he took her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," he said, "so long as I'm still Jim to you, nothing much
  matters."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY C.M. PADDAY</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol LII, Jun 1920, pp
  88-94</h3>

  <p class="first">JUST at that particular stage in its interesting career,
  Andrew Nulty's ship was known as the <i>Bonny Lomond</i>, a name which was
  not only picturesque, but just as good for business purposes as any other.
  Not that Lloyd's knew anything about it, or cared, for that matter, because
  the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> was not insured or ever likely to be. That would be
  almost impossible in the case of a boat that changed its name almost as often
  as a politician changes his opinions. And she was cosmopolitan, too, in the
  matter of the flag she carried, chameleon-like as to her coat, and catholic
  as to her funnels. In other words, she was a freebooter of the seas, a shy
  and modest craft, keeping as far as possible out of the main ocean tracks,
  and picking up a handsome living by divers means which it is just as well not
  to look too closely into.</p>

  <p>She wasn't particularly pretty, either, but she was fast, and that was the
  great virtue in Andrew Nulty's eyes, because, you see, there were times when
  an extra knot or two an hour made all the difference between imprisonment and
  freedom. She was a blundering-looking craft, ugly and bull-nosed, but her
  engines were a dream. They were compound engines of the turbine type, and
  nothing finer had ever been turned out on the Clyde.</p>

  <p>Now, Andrew Nulty knew something about machinery, as all Scotsmen do, and
  he had picked up those engines dirt cheap from a small manufacturer who had
  gone hopelessly bankrupt in the making of them. With a little more capital
  the inventor might have been a pioneer and a millionaire; but "the little
  more" was lacking in his case, whisky was cheap on the Clyde, and he had gone
  under, as many a man of his type has done before. So the engines found their
  way into the <i>Bonny Lomond</i>&mdash;then called the <i>Robbie
  Burns</i>&mdash;and Nulty had set out for the North Pacific to gratify a
  dazzling predatory dream which had obsessed him for many a long day.</p>

  <p>To put it briefly, he meditated a dash on the most strictly preserved
  piece of water in the world. He wasn't going to fish for whales or tarpons,
  but for pearls in that favoured spot which, under the protection of the
  Japanese Government, had been leased, for some years before the War, to the
  inevitable German syndicate. And the mere fact that the Japanese had taken
  over the concession, and had closed the whole business down for the present,
  did not render the task any the less diflicult. These seas were patrolled by
  a Japanese gunboat, and, to add to the difficulty, Andrew Nulty was well
  enough known in those waters&mdash;known, indeed, a good deal more than he
  was respected.</p>

  <p>He was not particularly afraid of being sent incontinently to the bottom,
  because on more than one occasion he had been made use of by the Secret
  Services of both Japan and England. For Nulty was a real patriot, and was
  always ready to put his private interests on one side where the needs of his
  country were concerned. And so occasionally he had carried important papers
  between Japan and Hong Kong and other international ports. But the old Adam
  was strong in him, he was a born poacher, and the lure of the illicit was
  irresistible. So he completed his arrangements in England, after a short time
  in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, after which he put boldly out to sea, in
  defiance of U-boats, and in the course of time reached the vantage ground,
  where, without delay, he set to work.</p>

  <p>With the aid of a dozen or so of native divers, whom he paid extravagantly
  and treated handsomely, he found himself at the end of the month with
  something like eight hundred pearls of various sizes and values. And during
  the whole of this time he had never seen even the nose of a gunboat. But
  Nulty had counted on this; he knew perfectly well that the Japanese Navy had
  its hands full, and he knew, too, that the real danger would begin when the
  <i>Bonny Lomond</i> turned her bows to the open sea. For Nuity was no fool,
  he had no illusions, and he knew perfectly well that one or two of his
  divers, who had already left him with their pockets full, would be pretty
  certain to talk. But that was all in the day's work.</p>

  <p>And so he sat on the deck of his ship, giving directions, and indulging
  from time to time in those whisky orgies which were his one weakness and a
  charm that he could never resist for long. He would bewail his backsliding
  afterwards in choice jeremiads (culled from a rich Presbyterian vocabulary,
  reminiscent of the time when he had attended the Wee Free kirk at least twice
  on a Sunday&mdash;a kind of sackcloth and ashes business that did nobody any
  harm, and certainly was powerless to check the next outburst when it was due.
  So he sat and prayed and smoked and drank, while the gleaming booty was
  piling up in the safe in the cabin, and yearned piously that he might find
  himself, without mishap, well out into the Pacific.</p>

  <p>He lingered there as long as he dared, backing his luck for all it was
  worth till the end of the third week, when he paid off his divers and grubbed
  up the anchor. Then, with a fair wind behind him, and something like ten
  thousand pounds' worth of loot in the cabin, he turned his nose in the
  direction of Hong Kong, where he knew a dignified Chinaman of the mandarin
  class, who was prepared to take the pearls off his hands at a fair price.</p>

  <p>The engines were working well, the weather was fine, and the end of the
  week ought, with any luck, to see the successful termination of the
  adventure. Nulty's spirits rose accordingly, and the whisky correspondingly
  went down into the bulb of the barometer, so to speak. Nulty was on deck,
  dreaming those dreams of his, just pleasantly drunk and caring nothing what
  happened, when presently he noticed a smudge of black smoke on the horizon,
  and shook his head sapiently.</p>

  <p>He gave his orders quickly enough, too, and the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> went
  about on a wide tack as fast as those wonderful engines would carry her. But,
  in spite of everything, the black smudge on the horizon became more
  pronounced, and presently a couple of funnels lifted themselves ominously
  over the rim of the horizon.</p>

  <p>"Ah, weel, the Lord's will be done!" Nulty ejaculated piously, "It seems
  to me, Andrew, my man, that yon's a gunboat, and, if I'm no mistaken, it's
  the <i>Fan Tan</i>."</p>

  <p>Now, Andrew Nulty was not mistaken. It was the <i>Fan Tan</i>, picking him
  up hand over fist, and evidently meaning business. There were reasons, too,
  why Nulty would have preferred an interview with any other unit of the
  Japanese Imperial Navy. In the first place, the commander of the gunboat was
  personally acquainted with the wily Scotsman&mdash;indeed, they had
  transacted several pieces of business together, designed for the discomfiture
  of the wily Hun. Therefore it would be useless for Nulty to assume innocence,
  or to pretend that he was in those private seas entirely by accident. Indeed,
  the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> reeked of pearl-fishing; there were signs and
  portents everywhere which would be as so much open print to the commander of
  a gunboat stationed in those seas with the one object of keeping pearl
  poachers at a respectable distance. Also it would be futile to deny the fact
  that the spoil was on board. Any attempt in that direction would inevitably
  send the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> to the bottom without decent delay or benefit of
  clergy. And the fact that Nulty had been engaged more than once on Government
  service would not help him, either. As a Government official he simply did
  not exist. He was a number, a unit, anything that didn't count, and if he got
  into trouble now, he knew perfectly well that there would be no questions
  asked in the House of Commons in his interests.</p>

  <p>So there was only one thing for it&mdash;to trust to his good luck and the
  speed of his engines, and the amazing fortune that had stood him in good
  stead all his life. And so for the next two or three hours he ran for it,
  hoping against hope, and cursing himself with lurid quotations from the
  Pentateuch. But all in vain. Just at sundown there came a little puff and
  something like a ball of cotton-wool from the bows of the gunboat, and a
  second later the aft funnel lurched forward and fell overboard. Then there
  came a second shot that just skimmed the bows of the <i>Bonny Lomond</i>,
  and, so to speak, Nulty held up his hands. A quarter of an hour later a
  dapper little man, looking amazingly like an English naval officer, stepped
  on board and greeted Nulty pleasantly enough.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"Good evenin' to ye, Captain Shinto," Nulty said. "It's lookin' for me you
  perhaps may be."</p>

  <p>The little man grinned amiably.</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you again," he said in excellent English. "I have been
  looking for you a long time. Is it that you are particularly dull this
  evening, or is it perhaps that old enemy of yours?"</p>

  <p>Nulty shook his head dolefully. He knew perfectly well what the little Jap
  was alluding to.</p>

  <p>"Ah, weel," he said, "why is it that a man will put an enemy in his mouth
  to steal away his brains?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come off it," Shinto said. "That'll do. Now let's get on to business.
  I think you and I understand one another pretty well, Nulty."</p>

  <p>Nulty shook his head again. He knew only too well that this smiling
  antagonist understood him all right&mdash;indeed, they had been acquaintances
  for many years. He knew that Captain Shinto had been at school in England; he
  had met him ages ago, when he was working as an engineer on the Clyde, and
  there had been one encounter of not too friendly a nature during the three
  years that Shinto had been in the R.N.R. And then, again, they had met
  recently on business of national importance.</p>

  <p>"I am listening to you, Captain," he said, "and I'm not so far gone with
  whusky as all that. And I can't help it, ye ken. When I put that enemy in my
  mouth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not likely to make much difference to your brains, anyway,"
  Shinto said. "Now, where's the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"I'm no understanding you now," Nulty prevaricated. "What stuff might ye
  be askin' after?"</p>

  <p>"There, that'll do," the other smiled. "You've been up the Gulf yonder for
  nearly a month. Why, you've actually been employing some of my own divers! I
  couldn't make up my mind what mischief the blackguards were up to, but I knew
  they were after no good. So, when they came back, I made inquiries, and heard
  all about a boat called the <i>Bonny Lomond</i>. I hadn't heard of her
  before, but I had heard of Captain Nulty and the steamer called the <i>Robbie
  Burns</i>. So I put two and two together, and&mdash;well, here we are."</p>

  <p>"So I see," said Nulty guardedly.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, I've got no time to waste. As a matter of fact, I ought
  not to be here at all. Does it occur to you that I might have sunk you
  without warning?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you might," Nulty admitted.</p>

  <p>"Might? It was my plain duty to do so. You know perfectly well you'd no
  business in these waters without a permit, and if you can show me such a
  thing, I shall be extremely surprised. You and I are old friends, and I
  wanted to give you a chance. Done pretty well, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll no deceive you," Nulty said, with an engaging attempt at candour.
  "I've done very well indeed. I suppose I've got a matter of eight hundred
  pearls altogether. And why not? They don't belong to you, and they don't
  belong to your Government, either. It's spoiling the dirty Hun I've
  been."</p>

  <p>"Here, let's go down below and talk it over," Shinto said. "I'm not here
  to argue international politics with you. What I ought to do is to take your
  boat into the nearest harbour and confiscate her, and you know what that
  means."</p>

  <p>Nulty nodded. He knew only too well what that meant. It would mean the
  loss of his ship and those beloved engines, plus a few years' imprisonment in
  a Japanese gaol. But there was something in Shinto's manner that told him
  that the latter was not likely to proceed to this extreme.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you understand," the Japanese officer said. "Now, we'll just
  step down into the cabin, and you can hand over the keys of the safe to me.
  I'll take care of those pearls. And a precious fine get-out it is for you.
  But you've got to earn your liberty."</p>

  <p>With an air of pious resignation to the will of an inscrutable Providence,
  Nulty led the way down to his cabin and handed over the keys of the safe. He
  sighed dolefully enough as he saw the result of a month's labour and the
  outlay of five hundred pounds stowed away in the pockets of his companion.
  Then he quoted an appropriate text or two regarding the laying up of treasure
  upon earth, and hospitably produced the whisky, which Captain Shinto did not
  disdain.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all over," he said, "and a sorrowful day for Andrew Nulty
  it's been. Still, it might have been worse, Captain, it might have been
  worse."</p>

  <p>"You're right there," Shinto smiled. "I might have sent you to the bottom.
  But I've other uses for you. Now listen. I'll send some of my men along in
  about half an hour to rig up another funnel for you, and then you'll go as
  far as the south point of Balen Isles, and wait there till further orders.
  Take these papers. Put them somewhere where they'll be safe, and do exactly
  what I tell you. In a way, it's rather a godsend for me to meet you like
  this, because it's almost imperative that I should be in two places at once.
  As you say, I have other fish to fry, and I can fry them in a few hours now.
  That's why I didn't sink you. Even a Scotch pearl poacher has his uses."</p>

  <p>"Ah, sheer Providence," Nulty said.</p>

  <p>"Something like it, perhaps. But I've no time to waste talking. You know
  exactly what to do. About three days from this you will be spoken by another
  Japanese boat, and someone will come aboard you with another packet. And when
  you've got the two you'll put into Hong Kong and deliver those envelopes to
  an address which shall be given you. And I think, on the whole, you've got
  out of it very well."</p>

  <p>"It might be worse," Nulty said, "and it might be better. If I'd pulled up
  anchor last night, we might never have met at all, and that's no pleasant
  thought."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you never know your luck," Shinto said. "If you hadn't met me, you
  would have run smack into one of our flotillas before morning, and what would
  have become of the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> then? Don't forget the wireless."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't forgotten it," Nulty said. "It's been in my mind this many a day
  to have a little installation of that same wireless myself. And it's very
  hard for a poor man to get an honest living since yon mon Marconi came along.
  And I'm thinking that I understand ye."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later and this curious pair of associates parted with mutual
  expressions of good-will, and as soon as the repairs were finished, Nulty set
  the head of the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> due south, and proceeded on his errand in
  a frame of mind that was somewhat complicated. True, he had lost a fortune
  and was the poorer by five hundred pounds in hard cash, but then he had saved
  his ship and those beloved engines of his, and, at any rate, he would be well
  paid for the delivery of those dispatches. So, like the philosopher he was,
  he turned his back upon his regrets and the key resolutely on the cupboard
  where he kept his whisky. For he was a real patriot, and there would be no
  more of that, at any rate, till he had got rid of the envelope which Captain
  Shinto had entrusted to his care.</p>

  <p>The fourth day found him at his destination, where he lingered a few
  hours, until he was boarded by a nondescript sort of craft that brought him
  another batch of papers and a set of instructions in the shape of a
  typewritten letter. No word passed on either side, and the whole transaction
  occupied only a few minutes; and this being done, the <i>Bonny Lomond</i>
  went on her way again, and in the fulness of time put into Hong Kong. There
  Nulty delivered up his papers, after which he let himself go, and indulged in
  a prolonged orgy that lasted him for the best part of a week. Then he pulled
  himself together, had a bath, dressed himself all in his best, and proceeded
  to go ashore in a stern and chastened frame of mind&mdash;a thing to which he
  was accustomed after one of his periodical backslidings.</p>

  <p>He came at length to rather an imposing house at the back of Hong Kong,
  where he gave a fictitious name and demanded an audience with one Lo Ben. Mr.
  Lo Ben not only happened to be at home, but would be quite pleased to see his
  visitor, whom he welcomed cordially, not to say effusively. It was evident
  that these two were old acquaintances, and they sat down together presently
  over a cup of tea and a cigarette, and by easy stages led up to business.</p>

  <p>"Now, what can I do for you?" the Chinaman said in his quaint English. "Is
  it money you need?"</p>

  <p>"Who doesn't?" Nulty asked. "But. it's no the bawbees this time I'm after,
  my friend."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman elevated his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"No?" he asked politely. "Then I have been&mdash;what is the word you
  use?&mdash;misinformed."</p>

  <p>"Ah, there's little you don't know in these parts. But you're wrong for
  once, Lo Ben. I have something to sell."</p>

  <p>"The pearls? Pearls, do you mean? Why, my agents told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can guess what your agents told you," Nulty grinned. "They said I
  was boarded by a Japanese gunboat. So I was. You probably heard that I had to
  make a very heavy sacrifice to save my ship. And so I had. But there are more
  ways than one of throwing dust in the eyes of the heathen. Now, look here, Lo
  Ben, would you like to put a price on this lot?"</p>

  <p>With this, Nulty dived his hand in his pocket and produced a wash-leather
  bag, the contents of which he spread out before the admiring eyes of Lo Ben.
  They lay there on the table in all their gleaming beauty, whilst the
  Celestial fingered them with a reverent touch.</p>

    <img src="1301071h-images/MadeInEngland2.jpg"
         title="The contents of which he spread out...">
  </div><br>

  <p>"But how did you manage?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Nulty waved the question impatiently aside.</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind that," he said. "I did manage. And you know where those
  pearls come from. There's nothing like them in any other part of the world.
  They're the genuine article right enough, and I'm after asking nine thousand
  for them."</p>

  <p>It was a long and complicated deal, invoking protestations from one side
  and extracts from Holy Writ on the other, but it ended at length&mdash;that
  titanic contest between a Scotsman and a Chinaman&mdash; with the interchange
  of a piece of paper that represented something within a shade of what Nulty
  had asked.</p>

  <p>"And now," said the Chinaman,&mdash;tell me."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was like this," Nulty explained. "I knew the risk I was taking.
  Then, ye see, the <i>Bonny Lomond</i> is well known in these parts to the
  Japanese Navy, and there was a fine chance of my not gettin' sunk if I could
  only break away with the goods. And that's where the real trouble began. I
  did get away with the goods, but my old friend Captain Shinto, he overhauled
  me, and I had to throw up my hands. So he takes away all the pearls and gives
  me some dispatches to bring here, which I delivered all right, and that's to
  the good. But, ye see, Lo Ben, I was expecting some visitation of Providence
  of this lamentable kind, and I thinks to myself that Heaven helps those that
  helps themselves. Did ye ever hear tell of a town called Birmingham?"</p>

  <p>"I handle goods from there," Lo Ben said.</p>

  <p>"Ah, weel, in that city of wickedness they make all sorts of things, and
  all sorts of imitations&mdash;imitation pearls. And now, Lo Ben, ye know all
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, then, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Went to Birmingham and laid out a few pounds of good money on a lot of
  imitation pearls in the rough state that were manufactured on purpose for me.
  And that's the stuff that Captain Shinto took out of my cabin with him. Ay,
  it is very hard to get the best of a Scotsman when he's real bent on
  wickedness, Lo Ben, and don't you forget it."</p><br>
