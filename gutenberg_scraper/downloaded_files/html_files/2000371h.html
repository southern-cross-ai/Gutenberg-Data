<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>The present time is a most hazardous one. Good men and women, of
all stations in society, recognize that the existing social
conditions are most unjust and likely to suffer a serious crash in
the not far distant future. Naturally enough the thinkers of the
age, are trying, through the channels of pleasing fiction, to
present a solution of the knotty social problem which confronts us;
but, in the present writer's opinion, although their efforts have
been an inestimable boon to humanity, they have all, with perhaps
one exception, fallen short of the desired goal. "Looking Backward"
is too impracticable, and too authoritarian to be desirable even if
it were practicable; as the clever Writer of "Looking Further
Forward" has well shown; "Caesar's Column," although a masterpiece
of destructive reasoning, is unsatisfactory to those who would see
society build itself anew; "News from Nowhere" is too exclusively
sentimental; while the hosts of minor works are not characterized
by any ideas of special value in the solution of the problem.</p>

<p>Even "Freeland," the able work of Dr. Hertzka which towers above
all the others in profundity of thought and correct economic
insight, is based upon a scheme of such colossal magnitude as to
somewhat detract from its immediate utility, and furthermore it
relies for its execution upon the means of the wealthy. In the
present work the writer endeavors to show how the oppressed classes
can work out their own emancipation without reliance upon the
uncertain assistance of the wealthy.</p>

<p>The author gladly acknowledges the valuable assistance rendered
by Mr. Philip Kleinmann and Mr. David A. Crichton (late Government
Agricultural lecturer), who have supplied valuable information used
in working out some of the details; and also several other
gentlemen and ladies, who have kindly furnished some useful
particulars.</p>

<p>If the present work should be the means of stimulating the
workers to strive to emancipate themselves by rational methods, the
author's labors will not have been in vain.</p>

<p>D.A.A.<br></p>

<p>THE MELBOURNE RIOTS;</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>"Harry, if you take my advice you'll not go to that
meeting."</p>

<p>"But I don't intend to take your advice, John. I know what I'm
about. And I know that my presence will have an important effect in
deciding the fate of those unfortunate wretches, who are almost
driven mad with hunger and oppression. What with those crafty
capitalistic wire-pullers aggravating them to deeds of rashness and
riot on the one side, and the equally unprincipled tactics and
dangerous utterances of those favour-seeking demagogues on the
other, they are in the greatest danger that they could possibly be.
They might as well be at the mercy of wild beasts in a jungle. I
have strong misgivings that some serious calamity will befall them
to-night."</p>

<p>"A very good reason why you should stay at home, instead of
getting into trouble over other people."</p>

<p>But Harry Holdfast was determined. No argument or appeal could
possibly affect him&mdash;unless, indeed, to intensify his
determination&mdash;and without taking any notice of his brother's
retort, he immediately left the house, and made his way to town
where the "monster indignation labor meeting" was advertised to be
held.</p>

<p>Harry was a popular character amongst the working people of
Melbourne, because he was not only an eloquent labor agitator, but
he had a happy method of putting himself on friendly terms with his
hearers by appealing to the better natures of friend and foe alike.
Of course, he had his enemies, as every one has had who has tried
to make the world better than he found it; but they were not many,
and he gave them little opportunity of pointing the finger of
slander against him, the worst that they could say of him being
that he was an "agitator." But as he was proud of the title, that
did not trouble him.</p>

<p>But there were other things that <i>did</i> trouble Harry, and
troubled him deeply.</p>

<p>There was a terrible state of destitution amongst thousands of
the working classes, not only in Melbourne, but throughout the
whole colony of Victoria; in fact, the "depression," as it was
called, had become common throughout the whole civilized world. Men
were out of employment in all directions. Work had ceased to be
scarce, and had become totally unobtainable for great numbers of
them. The ranks of the unemployed were growing greater and greater
from week to week. Charitable societies were organizing in every
big centre of population, but they were powerless to effect any
material change in the state of affairs; all the wealth they
dispensed in six months could not keep those already out of
employment supplied with the necessaries of life for a single day.
The Government had been compelled to start various relief works,
but they only employed, a very few, and only succeeded in swelling
the already heavy burden of taxation.</p>

<p>Economy was sought by retrenchment in the civil service,
hundreds of public servants being dispensed with, but this only
helped to throw more men into the growing ranks of the unemployed
and left the solution of the difficulty as far off as ever. The
labor party who after many years of untiring struggle had got a
very numerous representation in the legislature, were powerless to
tear down the strong vested interests arrayed against them as they
had hoped to do, and were as ignorant of the ultimate causes of the
terrible depression which was threatening to break up society as
they were divided in opinion as to the wisest expedients to tide
over the present difficulties; as to a radical and permanent cure,
they did not dare to entertain the thought of it.</p>

<p>The streets of Melbourne were thronged with men in vain search
of employment; there were a few of the genuine <i>genus</i>
"loafer" amongst them, but the great mass were strong; steady,
worthy fellows, anxious and willing to work, but with no work that
they might put their hands to. It was estimated that they numbered
no less than 50,000 persons. And yet it was pointed out that, by
the statistics of Hayter's "Year Book," the Colony was wealthier
than it had ever been before; in fact, it had become in proportion
to its size, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. But
despite this fact, the very employers themselves were beginning to
share the fate of the wretched workers; bankruptcies were,
increasing daily, shop after shop was closing its shutters,
merchants were reducing their imports and farmers ceasing to send
their products to market for want of buyers. Some of the largest
firms in the city, which had always been felt to be as stable as
the Government itself, found themselves compelled to suspend
operations, and in many cases to give up their entire estate, thus
throwing thousands out to starve.</p>

<p>The climax was reached when, on the day before out story opens,
the gigantic firm of Goldschmidt, Beere and Co. had dismissed their
entire staff at the shortest notice, and men, women and children
were rendered workless, homeless and without prospect of food
before them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II.</h2>

<p>It was not long before Harry reached the spot where the Monster
Indignation Labor Meeting was being held. There were already a
large number present and fresh visitors continued to arrive until
the meeting had assumed larger dimensions than any other that had
ever been held in Melbourne, and it yet wanted several minutes to
the time when the proceedings were to commence. It was with some
difficulty that Harry managed to elbow his way through the crowd to
the lorry which was in readiness for the speakers of the evening to
"orate" from; but at last, amidst loud cheering, he-mounted the
"platform" along with the others. The sight was one calculated to
cheer the heart of any enthusiast who longed to see the workers
strive for a higher social level than the one they now occupied.
The lorry stood some fifty yards from the footpath, in the centre
of a large block of land where several immense stores had stood
only a few months before.</p>

<p>On both sides and behind, were thousands of working men, many of
whom had their wives and children with them; and away in front,
stretching right across Flinders Street, until traffic was
well-nigh impeded, the immense ocean of proletaires stretched forth
in its rugged grandeur. Harry felt strange sensation pass over him
as he beheld this extraordinary sight. Here and there were
policemen mixing up in the crowd and preserving "order," while down
the street were a few dozen mounted troopers. But these were; such
a mere handful, compared with the great mass of working people
present, that they attracted little attention. On the lorry were
about twenty other men besides Harry, and a remarkable assortment
of physiognomies they presented. One big fellow, with firm set
limbs, rather dark complexion and heavy frowning brow, was perhaps
the most noticeable of all; but alongside him was a remarkable
little fellow, fussing about and gesticulating to those about him,
and acting as though he fancied himself the host of those
present.</p>

<p>This strange personage caught one's eye at a glance&mdash;his
peculiar attire, somewhat resembling that of the French peasantry,
his small limbs, his big bullet head out of all proportion to the
rest of the body, and his bull-like neck, all showed him to be a
man of unusual characteristics, and did not favorably impress a
spectator upon first seeing him; but when one looked closer into
his face, and saw the cunning, piercing little eyes, the big,
sharply-cut and thin-lipped mouth, and the strained effort at a
permanent smile, which, like Harte's Heathen Chinee, was
"child-like and bland" to a degree, the interest in this little
individual became intense, and made one almost forget the presence
of the Herculean agitator beside him. On the precise moment that
the Post Office clock in Elizabeth Street chimed seven o'clock, the
big man arose to his feet to address the meeting. Loud applause and
ringing hurras greeted him from thousands of throats. When the
deafening noise had subsided he addressed them as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Comrades, in the war of labor against the tyranny of capital
(loud applause), it is with pleasure that I can't express that I
open this mighty meeting, a meeting which I hope and believe will
never be forgotten in the history of human progress (hear, hear,
and bravo), a meeting that is not summoned like its predecessors to
talk, and talk, and never do more than talking, but a meeting that
is resolved to strike the final blow at the monster of capitalism
which is devouring us (vociferous applause). We are here to-night,
friends, not to ask our rights&mdash;we have done that too long
already&mdash;we are here to take our stand as men and women, and
to enter into a fight to the death for a world which has been
stolen from us and which awaits us under our very feet" (tremendous
cheering and hooraying interrupted the speaker, who presently
proceeded), "We are here, I say, to fight the greatest fight in all
history, not to repeat the little petty contest between a few
thousand English and Russian warriors, or to lead the hired
butchers of Germany to cut the throats of the hired butchers of
France; we are not here to massacre Afghans, Egyptians, Zulus, or
Maories; we are not here to perpetuate the senseless feuds between
nations and nations, between creeds and castes, or between race and
color; but we are here to affirm the unity of all humanity, to
assert that in the future the world shall only know one race, one
people, one country, without creeds or colors to disunite them; and
we are here to assert the dominion of the people and the final
subjugation of the race of luxurious vampires who have held them in
bondage since the dawn of civilization (loud applause). We are here
to protest against the fiendish inhumanity of the Goldschmidt Beere
and Co's (hisses and groaning), and to avenge ourselves upon their
kind the whole world over. Permit me, comrades, to call upon the
first speaker, Samuel Sharples."</p>

<p>An intelligent-looking young fellow here arose, and after the
applause following the oration of the last speaker had subsided, he
spoke, with considerable emotion, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friends, you have heard what our worthy chairman, Tom Treadway,
has said, and I am afraid any words of mine will sound very dull
after his fiery eloquence (cries of 'No,' 'no'), but I should be
ashamed of myself if I did not do all in my power to help the cause
of labor in this awful period of distress and death. Why do we have
all these troubles year after year? Have we not a government to
protect us, and to look after our welfare? True, they don't do so;
but that, I am afraid, is our own fault (cries of 'No,' and
interruption). Well, friends, I think it is so.</p>

<p>We put bad men to rule over us, and then wonder why they rob us
and compel us to be idle; we should send men to represent us who
would know our interests and look after them. We want the land of
the people thrown open to the use of the people (hear, hear); we
want all the capital and machinery to be in the hands of the State
instead of in the hands of private parasites; we want to tax the
absentee and the land-grabber instead of taxing the poorly-paid
laborer; we want&mdash;" Here someone interjected "We're tired of
wanting," and a restless chain of interruption made itself
gradually felt over the meeting, entirely drowning the voice of the
speaker, who was compelled to resume his seat on the lorry.</p>

<p>Treadway then announced that Harry Holdfast would next address
the meeting.</p>

<p>Harry was up in a moment. His familiar face was greeted with the
most enthusiastic applause.</p>

<p>"Friends," said he, "and foes, if any are present, we are met as
the chairman has said, to open the greatest war the world has ever
seen (hear, hear), but are we to come out victors or vanquished?
('Victors' was echoed from some thousand throats). Let us hope so.
The great Shakespeare has said, 'Beware of entrance to a quarrel,
but being in't, bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee,' and
I feel that we are now in such a quarrel; long have we feared to
enter it&mdash;for centuries have we and our forefathers groaned
beneath injustice and oppression, but we can wait no longer; the
blight of capital is fast crushing us out of existence, our wives
and children are dying in front of us because we cannot, we <i>dare
not</i> win the bread with which to sustain their lives. We have
not courted the quarrel; we are in the thick of the fight; capital
has its knee upon our throat and is fast strangling the breath from
our bodies. Shall we longer endure it? (loud cries of 'No') No,
friends, let us bear our quarrel; and let us bear it like true men
and women, that those who oppose may admire our courage and
determination, and fear our strength, our numbers, and our undying
resolve to be free (enthusiastic applause). But how are we to be
free? Shall we wait for freedom with our arms folded? Shall we
follow the advice of friend Sharples and ask our wealthy oppressors
to tax themselves instead of us? (cries 'No') Shall we ask them to
free the land when they all exist by keeping it from us, and making
us work upon it for their profit because they call it theirs?</p>

<p>No, comrades, we are truly told that 'God helps those who help
themselves,' and we need never hope to be free while we wait for
others to set us free; <i>we must free ourselves</i> (applause).
The actions of Goldschmidt, Beere &amp; Co. (loud groans) I was
about to say that the action of that firm in dismissing their
hands, cruel as it is in its effects; upon us, was inevitable under
the conditions in which we all live. They dared not do otherwise.
You or I in their place must have done the same (cries of 'No, no,'
and interruption). You disbelieve me friends, but I can assure you
it is as I say. Had they not closed yesterday, in a few weeks at
most their creditors would have compelled them to close, for their
stores are glutted with the goods which we have made, and we, the
workers, who should be their principal customers, as we embrace the
greater part of the population, have no money to purchase our
requirements of them and thus to provide them the revenue with
which they pay their own debts (hear, hear). No, friends, we have
entered on the labor war, but let us fight to win. Let us get the
tools with which we work into the hands of us who use them, instead
of letting them bring the revenue to those who work not to create
it&mdash;I refer to the capitalists. We must learn&mdash;and learn
immediately&mdash;how to co-operate together so as to secure the
products of our labor for ourselves, to peacefully acquire
possession of the lands which legal robbery has despoiled us of,
and to become independent of the speculative individual who under
pretext of lending us the requisite machinery with which to work
for our own benefit, dips his hand deep into our pockets, depriving
us of nearly all we have produced, and makes us the wretched slave
of his accursed gold."</p>

<p>The chairman next called upon Felix Slymer, the remarkable
little bullet-headed agitator who sat next to him, and whom we have
already briefly described. The applause that greeted this
intimation was simply astounding. If the other speakers were
popular, Slymer was more than popular&mdash;he was their very
idol.</p>

<p>Gently rising to his feet, he softly stroked together his
delicate and flabby little hands, apparent strangers to toil from
their appearance, and slowly bowing before before them he delivered
himself deliberately and in a markedly simulating manner of the
following:&mdash;"Mr. Chairman, fellow Proletaires, Ladies and
Gentlemen,&mdash;It is with the greatest pleasure that I note the
unusual warm with which you greet my appearance. I feel it keenly.
It gives me confidence. It tells me that you repose in me the
confidence I have in you. I trust I shall be worthy of your esteem
(Hear, hear, and cries of 'You are worthy,' &amp;c.). Well friends,
I again thank you for your kind opinion of me; and I must now tell
you what I think, and what I feel, and what I intend to do in the
present desperate crisis. That it is desperate you all know as well
as I do.</p>

<p>Absolute slavery is not worse than it. This wage-slavery we are
suffering under our bourgeoisie system of cut-throat competition is
worse than death itself. But what are we to do? I agree with friend
Sharples that we want worthy men to represent us (a cry, 'We want
you there'). Thanks, friend, but I am afraid I am not so worthy: I
only wish I were. But when do we get proper representation? Never.
All we get is representation of the squatters, the bankers, the
swindling syndicates, the Jewish sweaters, the land sharks, and all
who represent the vested interests of the time. Our present
governments are rotten&mdash;rotten to the core; we need hope for
nothing from them. But can we hope for anything from those
co-operative 'castles in the air' that our individualistic friend,
Holdfast, is recommending us? No; they're the panacea of the
capitalist, a bone that the bourgeoisie throws out of his mansion
window to keep the starving dog of labor quiet. If it were not an
insult, I would almost think that Holdfast is in the hands of the
capitalists, and is employed by them to draw co-operation as a red
herring across our trail to take us off the scent. No, friends, we
mustn't be deceived by these bogus remedies.</p>

<p>We must strike the tree at its root. We must meet like with
like. The present government is in armed force against the people.
Soft words and co-operative stores can't resist jails and bullets.
We must meet force with force. (Here a group of gruff-voiced
followers of Slymer grunted assent, and the great part of the
meeting applauded). Yes, we must arm ourselves; we must train our
unemployed and drill them as soldiers that they may fight the hired
soldiers of the capitalists and defend the homes of the laborers
against the deadly fire of the paid murderers in the employ of our
bureaucratic government. We must teach them how to make explosives,
and <i>to use them</i>; (applause, dissent, and serious
interruptions now kept increasing and the speaker's voice was only
heard at intervals)&mdash;we must drive them into&mdash;&mdash;"
(rest of sentence lost in the uproar)&mdash;"capitalistic hounds
must be swept into&mdash;&mdash;," "dynamite and
other&mdash;&mdash;" "capture and hang or burn the&mdash;&mdash;,"
these, and a similar lot of detached phrases were heard above the
uproar, which had now become terrific; but nothing could be
distinctly understood that the speaker was uttering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the police moved forward, and ordered the lorry and its
occupants to disperse before further trouble was caused by their
inflammatory utterances. A great rush ensued. The din was terrific.
Large crowds of soldiers were seen hurriedly marching up St. Kilda
Road headed by torches, and mounted police were gathering in
immense numbers in all directions. The driver of the lorry, fearing
danger, instantly turned his horses heads, and endeavoured to make
for the street, which he gained after considerable delay and
difficulty. No sooner had he reached Russell Street than he turned
up to escape the crowd; but they followed him. The scene now became
one of wild confusion, and it was with difficulty that the powerful
horses managed to draw their burdens up the steep hill owing to the
surging mass pressing and swaying so heavily against it, many being
thrown down and trampled to death by one another, and numbers
falling under the wheels of the lorry. Upon arriving at the corner
of Collins Street further progress became absolutely impossible.
The crowd had now increased by thousands, and rumours were all over
the city bringing fresh throngs to the scene. No horse, or no body
of horses, could possibly force its way through the immense wall of
humanity that came surging up from Bourke Street. One would think
that all Victoria had come to witness the indescribable scene.</p>

<p>Seeing that they could make no further retreat the occupants of
the lorry held council together as to what they should do under the
extraordinary circumstances. The general feeling was to quietly
leave the wagon, one at a time, and silently disperse to their
homes; but Felix Slymer would not hear of such a thing. He charged
them with cowardice, and said that those who were so anxious to
fight capital were trying to flee at the first sniff of danger.
This rebuke was too much, and they decided to remain.</p>

<p>Taking in the state of affairs, and noticing the perplexity of
the labor leaders, Slymer instantly brought himself "in evidence"
before the crowd. Hastily rising to his legs, he once more
addressed the masses of people who thronged the streets, urging
them to resist this "unwarranted breach of discipline on the part
of the officials" as he called it, and inciting them to deeds of
violence to redress this wrong; he called, in the name of justice,
upon those who had been "spoliated" by the capitalists to take
their revenge and "loot the shops of the Collins Street
aristocracy." Instantly a rush was made down the street, shutters
were torn down, windows smashed with the broken shutters, and the
jewellers' and other shops were burst open. A cry was raised "To
the banks!" and large numbers rushed for these time-honored
representatives of vested interests, but they were too firmly
constructed to be burst open, and the crowds returned to the shops
of the "small-fry" capitalists. The police and the troopers were
powerless to stop the furious onslaught of the people, although
they mercilessly beat them with their batons and their swords until
wounded and dying rioters were lying about in all directions.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, the lorry remained in its old
place, and the great mass of the crowd stayed around it, and
hopelessly hemmed it in, while Slymer continued his oration calling
on the people to resist force with force. Suddenly Slymer
disappeared, and it was thought he had been violently kidnapped by
an agent of the capitalists. Harry, noticing his disappearance,
hastened to fill his place, and stepping forward on the lorry he
cried out "Friends, be calm. There is some treachery here. Let us
disperse." But he spoke too late.</p>

<p>All at once, the mayor of the city appeared, armed with a sheet
of paper which turned out to be the Riot Act, and he appeared to
read from it, although no one, not even himself, could hear a word
of it, and no sooner had he done than a general rush was made by
the police and a number of civilians upon the occupants of the
lorry. Men were fighting each other indiscriminately. Women and
children were screaming and fainting, and the horses plunging about
wildly and trampling many many poor wretches to death. All of a
sudden a series of terrific explosions occurred, shaking the earth
like an earthquake and causing the steeple of one of the
neighbouring churches to fall on the heads of a number of
unfortunate victims beneath.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a stoppage of the firing and fighting. All
seemed to think that the world had come to its long-expected end,
and gazed awe-stricken at each other in the sickly glare of the few
torches that still continued to be held aloft. Recovering their
presence of mind, and taking advantage of the temporary
astonishment of the crowd, the police rushed for the occupants of
the lorry, and after serious fighting, with the assistance of the
soldiery, they captured eleven of them and, with considerable
difficulty, marched them off in custody to the watchhouse where
they were securely lodged.</p>

<p>The effect was marvellous. All the fighting ceased instantly.
The crowd, having lost their leaders, seemed to have lost their
hopes. Their frantic fury gave place to anxious fear. Slowly the
streets commenced to assume their former appearance, the throng
dispersed, the torches ceased to lend their ghastly glare to the
ghastly scene; and although thousands continued to hang about the
streets during the whole of the night, the greater part wended
their way to their homes to brood in silence over the terrible
drama they had been the unexpected witnesses of.</p>

<p>"It's late now, and Harry not yet home, I fear my worst
suspicions are realized, mother," said John Holdfast that
night.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't fear," said the old lady, "Harry is certainly a rash
young fellow, and a foolish chap to bother about other people's
troubles when he always gets constant work himself, but he's not
likely to get into any serious trouble. He's too temperate and
cool-headed for that."</p>

<p>But Harry lay in the cell along with his comrades, waiting to be
tried on a charge of murder.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III.</h2>

<p>It was a beautiful spring morning that followed the events
depicted in the last chapter. The sky was clear, the air fresh and
bracing, the sun delightfully warm without being oppressive. In
fact, everything seemed cheerful and contented, except man. Even
he, poor wretched mortal, was more or less influenced by the
invigorating weather, and was in a better mood than he might
otherwise have been. For the worst man amongst us is not wholly
insensible to good surrounding influences, whatever theorists may
say to the contrary.</p>

<p>It was on this cheerful morning that a young man might be seen
walking, or rather slinking along some of the smaller streets of
the city, availing himself of the many little rights-of-way and
semi-private thoroughfares, as though to escape observation, until
he reached a certain little cottage in the western end of Little
Lonsdale Street, where he suddenly halted, and anxiously looked
round him, as though fearful of being observed. Evidently seeing no
one about, he pulled a little note book from his pocket, looked at
the number on the door, as though to make sure that it tallied with
the one in the book, and then gently stepped forward and knocked at
the door. Presently a somewhat elderly man opened it, and without a
word passing between them the visitor entered and the door was
instantly closed behind him.</p>

<p>"Well, Slymer," said the host, as soon as his visitor was
seated, "did you do as I instructed you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the curt reply.</p>

<p>Felix Slymer, without further ceremony, pulled out some papers
from his pocket and handed them to his friend, who very carefully
perused them, while the little eyes of his visitor were busily
employed in taking in a very exhaustive view of the apartment in
which he was waiting.</p>

<p>Presently the elderly man folded up the papers, placed them
carefully in his pocket, and turning to Slymer, said:</p>

<p>"That will do, Slymer; you have faithfully performed your
mission, and here is your reward."</p>

<p>Slymer's eyes glistened, as his flabby hands clutched the ten
bright sovereigns that were handed to him; but there was not that
expression of glee that one would expect to see exhibited by one of
so humble an appearance upon receipt of such a relatively large
sum. Having carefully deposited the money in a secret pocket in the
inner lining of his vest&mdash;he considered it unbecoming or
inexpedient for one in his position to be seen using a
purse&mdash;he was about to withdraw, when the other suddenly
called him over to him.</p>

<p>"Felix," said he, "I wish to ask you something before you
go."</p>

<p>"What's the matter now, Grindall," was the reply, "I am not
going to open my mouth for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't trouble yourself on that score, my friend, I am not
going to ask you for 'professional' information just now. But I am
a little uneasy about a paragraph I read in <i>The Daily
Weathercock</i> this morning, and I thought you might enlighten me
a little on the matter. Here, read it for yourself."</p>

<p>Taking up the newspaper as directed, Slymer instantly read the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">TERRIFIC RIOT IN THE CITY.<br>
<br>
Suspicious Agencies at Work.<br>
<br>
In another part of this issue we give full and startling
particulars of the extraordinary tumult which occurred in the city
last evening. The labor party, intoxicated with recent legislative
victories and eager for the plunder which they have so long
threatened in dark and mysterious hints, burst out in full fury
last night, upon the occasion of a "monster indignation meeting" as
they called it, which was held in Flinders Street and subsequently
shifted to the corner of Collins Street and Russell Street where
the tragic events narrated elsewhere took place. It appears that
several of the discontented loafers, who scorn to live except upon
"agitation" and charity, convened a meeting of similarly-disposed
ne'er-do-wells, presumably to "consider" the present grave
depression, which is sorely taxing the minds of our wisest
philanthropists and statesmen, though really to carry out the
nefarious designs which they had brutally conceived and prearranged
at a secret meeting held for the purpose some weeks before.
Sharples, Holdfast, and a number of other roughs, who are well
known to the police, are mainly instrumental for the disturbances
and the terrific loss of life which has accompanied them, but the
public will be glad to hear that they are all, or nearly all, in
safe custody, and ready to take their quietus at the proper
moment.</p>

<p>It will not be prudent, at the present moment, to say too much
on the subject, as the police have the matter in hand and are
diligently working to forge such of chain of evidence as shall rid
society of this terrible pest that has so long been allowed to
destroy all public confidence, to frighten capital out of the
colony, to absolutely stop all commercial enterprize, and to drive
tens of thousands of deserving men and women to poverty and
destitution. It is sufficient, for the present, to say, that one of
the miserable cowardly wretches has shown the white feather
already, and has exposed the whole of their nefarious designs,
their operations for the past four years, the names and whereabouts
of the ringleaders, and several other facts that we dare not
mention. We cannot disclose the name of the miserable traitor, as
he is still allowed to move among his old <i>confreres</i> in order
to report their further proceedings, he still being one of the most
trusted among them; and were we to name him they would set upon him
and ferociously murder him, as they murdered those poor innocent
men, women and children last night. We may, however, mention that
our old and esteemed fellow-citizen, Gregory Grindall, our late and
much-respected mayor of Melbourne, has munificently offered a
reward of £50 to anyone who will give such information as will lead
to the conviction of the thief or thieves, who during the riot
carried off £20,000 worth of jewellery from his magnificent
warehouses in Collins Street, and £25 to anyone who will expose the
secrets of the labor organizations.</p>

<p>When Slymer had finished reading the paragraph, Grindall looked
steadily at him, as though waiting some expression of feeling from
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of this matter?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" responded Slymer.</p>

<p>"Do you not see? You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but you underestimate the risk."</p>

<p>"You think £25 too little. Of course; I understand. What would
you have me make it?"</p>

<p>"One thousand."</p>

<p>"Great heavens! man, you seem to think I am made of money."</p>

<p>"I don't know what else you're made of."</p>

<p>"Slymer, you know I can't afford to resist your cruel
insinuation, now that I have reposed such confidence in you. But
really, the depression is so serious just now that one needs to
look at every £5 note to keep out of the Insolvency Court."</p>

<p>"My price is a thousand. If it don't suit you don't bargain. I
know very well you won't get anyone else to do your dirty work for
fifty times that sum, and you know it too."</p>

<p>"Agreed, then," said Grindall, "but give me time."</p>

<p>"I will wait one month, provided you give me £100 now."</p>

<p>"Right, then. But before you go, one word more. Were you present
at this meeting last night?"</p>

<p>"I was. Don't you see my name amongst the speakers?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but how is it you were not incarcerated with the
others?"</p>

<p>"In the <i>melee</i>, I feigned being shot, and was able to
crawl under the cart unobserved, where I waited until the
disturbances were over, and then escaped unnoticed."</p>

<p>"That will do. Good-bye. I wish you success."</p>

<p>"Yes, but only for the sake of your own banking account, you old
miser," muttered Felix to himself as the door closed behind him and
he was once again in the street.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV.</h2>

<p>Gregory Grindall was unhappy. Not that that was anything unusual
with him because he was never a happy individual at the best of
times. He had money certainly&mdash;abundance of it, in
fact&mdash;but what pleasure could he derive from it when he was in
constant danger of losing it? He had hosts of friends, too, amongst
the higher, as well as the lower classes of society, but what did
all their friendship benefit him when he mistrusted everyone of
them and believed that most of them mistrusted him? True, he had
the press extolling his innumerable virtues (real or imaginary) and
the principal daily organ, of which he was part proprietor, lauded
him to the skies; but as others in his own position understood the
worth of the eulogies lavished upon him by the press, and as the
pesky rabble were beginning to mistrust everything and everyone
recommended by the "bourgeoisie press," as they termed it, and as
moreover the other papers had now and then a mercenary interest in
supporting his rivals, what good, after all, would the press be to
him in time of adversity, and with all the anxieties it brought
upon him did it assist in his happiness? Certainly not. There is no
happiness in life, where one is in constant anxiety.</p>

<p>Although money rendered miserable all those poor wretches
without money, there was no concealing the fact that it didn't
succeed very well either in bringing happiness to those who had
lots of it. At least, so Grindall thought. He believed himself to
be worth considerably over a million pounds, but then his
liabilities were something enormous. As to his assets, he could not
possibly estimate them, because half his investments appeared to be
unsound now that the terrible depression was settling on
everything&mdash;mines were failing, banks bursting, creditors
failing without paying a shilling in the pound; and worse than all,
he could not immediately convert his assets into cash as he desired
to do, and the banks were so panic-stricken they feared to make
advances to anyone except upon the most ruinous terms.</p>

<p>Gregory Grindall had lived a life full of varied business
experience. Starting humbly, as many successful men have done
before him, he had terrible odds to fight against. Often would he
look back at the happy time when as a little errand boy he honestly
worked for the few shillings which every week he took home to his
anxious parents. Then he showed such intelligence and diligence
that he got a situation as a clerk in a position of trust; but
owing to the dishonesty of a fellow-worker, he was dismissed in
disgrace on a false charge of embezzlement. Then he skipped from
one thing to another until he chanced to form the acquaintance of
an influential local councillor, who got him a job working for the
corporation, and he gradually ingratiated himself into the favours
of the councillors by his willing ways and his friendly manner.
Then he saw the petty scheming, the selfish intrigues and the
unscrupulous overreaching that appear to constitute about
three-fourths of the <i>raison d' etre</i> of municipal governing
bodies; and he was at first disgusted. Then he got so accustomed to
seeing privileged intrigue trampling down meritorious effort that
he became quite used to it, and he began to look upon it as the
right thing after all&mdash;"the right of might" as he used to ease
his conscience by labelling it.</p>

<p>Then he watched his opportunity until he got in a few little
swindles himself, "made money" as the saying is; got a little
property somehow or other; began to be known publicly; got elected
to the council, and proceeded step by step until he became mayor of
the city of Melbourne, proprietor of one of the largest jewellery
establishments in the colony, newspaper proprietor, mining
share-broker, and a large shareholder in several of the largest
banking syndicates in Australia. But still he wasn't happy.</p>

<p>Gregory paced up and down the room like a caged lion, and it was
very evident some terrible weight was upon his mind. "I wish the
damned thing was all over," he muttered to himself; "what's the
good of a fellow worrying and worrying his short life out if its
all going to come to this? What's the good of wealth when you can't
realize upon it, and honors when only a lot of avaricious hounds
respect for them&mdash;and even their respect is only envy after
all. It's all very fine for Parson Wilkins to talk about 'the duty
of the rich towards the poor'&mdash;bah! why doesn't the fat old
beast, with his twenty pounds a week rolling in for doing nothing,
why doesn't he practise those duties to the poor that he talks
about?</p>

<p>The miserable old wretch, he growled at me the other day because
the interest on his shares in the International Chartered Bank had
fallen two-and-a-half per cent., and only the month before I had
cautioned him against leaving his ten thousand deposit in the
Perpetual Prosperity Bank just in time for him to withdraw before
it went smash. And that Slymer! the ungrateful little wretch!
snivelling about my not being able to get anyone else to do my
'dirty work.' Dirty work, indeed, the insolent wretch! but I'll be
even with him yet. If I don't get that thousand pounds back some
day, aye, and with interest added, my name's not Grindall, by
heavens it isn't!" The prospect of revenge seemed greatly to please
the irate old millionaire, and to banish the prospects of his
downfall from his mind; for he hastily put on his hat and gloves,
and marched out into the street, slamming the door after him, with
the air of one who had accomplished a decisive victory.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V.</h2>

<p>It was a red-letter day in the history of Victorian labor, when
Holdfast and his comrades were arraigned before the magistrates on
the charge of murdering their fellow citizens. Never had the walls
of the court held a more eager and expectant throng of men and
women. The excitement a few years before over the fiendish
murderer, Deeming, was nothing in comparison with it. And no
wonder, for all seemed to realize that the case before the bench
meant nothing less than the first decisive blow in the great
struggle for supremacy between the classes and the masses. Eager
speculations were indulged in as to the ultimate outcome of the
impending trial. Would the authorities be severe with the
prisoners, and if so what frightful revenge would the friends of
the prisoners take upon their adversaries? Would the poor man have
justice for the first time in civilisation's history, or had money
already decided the fatal verdict? Such were the questions
troubling the brains of the amazed spectators, and forming the
topic of conversation amongst the thousands who thronged the
streets for miles around. After the usual batch of drunks,
larcenies, and petty misdeameanors had been rapidly disposed of,
the great case of the Melbourne Rioters came on for hearing. After
the usual preliminaries, the Crown Prosecutor stated the case,
which was briefly as follows:&mdash;For a considerable time past,
the police had been diligently watching a secret society, which had
its headquarters in Melbourne, and had branches ramifying
throughout all the industrial centres of the colonies.</p>

<p>This society bore the ominous title of "The Knights of Revenge."
For a long time their purpose was unknown, and for a considerable
time even their very existence was unsuspected. But thanks to the
vigilance of the police and their practised agents the nefarious
operations of the villains had all been ascertained and their base
designs thwarted. The president of the society was one Thomas
Treadway who he was glad to say was in safe custody amongst the
accused. This monster had a scheme on hand to destroy every public
building in Melbourne, to take the life of every man whose wealth
was excessive and who attempted to resist his murderous
onslaught.</p>

<p>Harry Holdfast, the secretary to the gang, had written letters
which were now in possession of the authorities and which he was
certain would send every one of them to the gallows. It was the
Knights of Revenge who had convened the fatal meeting held on the
First day of May, a day celebrated everywhere as the festival of
labor, and it was at their instigation, and through their
organization, that the atrocious deeds of that day were committed,
when six hundred and five men, women and children were cruelly and
remorselessly massacred and many thousands seriously wounded, in
most cases beyond hopes of recovery. Many wealthy men had been
"marked" for destruction by the Society among whom was their most
worthy and respected citizen, Gregory Grindall; all the banks were
to be plundered; the establishments of certain tradesmen, who had
not supported the return of the labor party to parliamentary power,
were to be looted; and every special constable, or any other person
who endeavoured in any way to oppose their designs was to be
"removed." The official prosecutor said he would not occupy the
time of the court with full details of the ghastly plots; but would
produce witnesses who would furnish the fullest and most reliable
particulars.</p>

<p>Jonah Johnson, the first witness called, said he had known the
accused for several years past. He had been a member of the Knights
of Revenge for four years, having joined it when Treadway was
president, a few months after its formation, when a friend of his
in a state of semi-intoxication had divulged its existence.
Treadway, one of the defendants, had then told witness that he
meant to "destroy every wealthy loafer and every loafer's mansion
before another five years were over their heads," and he believed
the present riot was the first organized attempt to carry the
threat into execution. He could show them copies of a newspaper
called <i>Vengeance</i> [paper produced] in which the plans of
destruction were depicted exactly as Treadway had described them to
his sanguinary <i>confreres</i>.</p>

<p>Ralph Washington, the next witness called, said he knew several
of the defendants personally, being himself a member of the Knights
of Revenge, having joined when in poverty and despair. He had long
since ceased to be an actual member, having been for two years
established in business as a hair-pin manufacturer through the
charitable assistance of a wealthy gentleman, but he dared not
hitherto leave it formally under penalty of death. Now that the
miscreants were brought to justice and out of harm's way, he did
not fear to proclaim his secession from the secret body, although
he had long made known his true position to the police. He had
known Treadway very intimately, having come out with him in the
Royal Rover, from England, nearly three years ago, when he first
broached his wicked plan to organize the society now known as the
Knights of Revenge.</p>

<p>He had now at his factory in Elizabeth Street, a large quantity
of bombs and other explosives, which he had allowed another member
of the gang, Sharples, to deposit there immediately upon their
being manufactured; the whereabouts of the "plant" being well known
to police who had arranged with witness to allow the diabolical
fiends to deposit all their dangerous products there without
official detection. Besides the bombs, there were a large number of
rifles belonging to the members of the gang; but which were
fortunately called into requisition by the authorities in
suppressing the great riot.</p>

<p>A great number of other witnesses were called, all of whom
agreed in denouncing the accused as members of a secret gang of
assassins whose machinations had caused the wholesale human
slaughters on May Day. They also swore that Holdfast and the others
had used inflammatory language inciting the mob to use
violence.</p>

<p>Upon the prisoners being asked if they had any witnesses to
bring forward or anything they wished to say in their defence,
unless they wished to reserve it for their trial.</p>

<p>Tom Treadway boldly asserted his innocence of the crime laid to
his charge. He had not taken any life during the so-called riots,
for he had come there unarmed and had solely relied on his muscles
to help him fight his way out of the dreadful fray. He had even
taken his wife with him, so little had he anticipated the sad
events. He firmly believed the whole thing was a vile concoction of
the police or the capitalists. [Here the witness was sternly
reminded that he must confine himself to his own defence instead of
casting slurs on reputable citizens if he desired to he heard]. He
would say, then, that the charges were a tissue of lies.</p>

<p>The Knights of Revenge was a myth, as far as he knew, for he had
never heard of such an organization. He had only been in the colony
two years, and yet two of the witnesses had perjured themselves,
and furthermore perjured each other, one saying that he (Treadway)
had been president of the asserted society in Melbourne over four
years ago, and another pretended member of the pretended society
had stated that witness came out in the same ship with him two
years later. The paper called <i>Vengeance</i> witness had never
seen before its production in court, and he firmly believed some
capitalists had printed it to make certain of the legal murder of
the defendants.</p>

<p>[The magistrates here stopped the defendant's speech, and
threatened that the next one who dared to make such scandalous
imputations would be committed for contempt of court and deprived
of further opportunity to speak].</p>

<p>Holdfast stoutly denied he had used language inciting to
violence, and declared that the language put into his mouth by some
of the witnesses for the prosecution had actually been used by one
Felix Slymer, who had not been arrested for some reason but had
mysteriously disappeared. Although he himself believed that a
people suffering wrong at the hands of the authorities were fully
justified in resorting to force to resist that wrong, still he did
not think those violent measures would produce the desirable
results that the labor party anticipated, and therefore he had not
advised them. The witnesses were a crowd of unblushing perjurors;
and the documents produced in court and said to be written by him
were all deliberate forgeries and a very bad imitation of his own
handwriting as he would show by some letters he had sent to his
friends on several occasions. [Letters produced.]</p>

<p>The other seventeen prisoners asserted their innocence, and
supported the statements of Treadway; one of the number, Sharples,
almost foaming with rage when he contradicted the assertion that he
had manufactured, and secreted bombs and other explosives with
Washington, whom he denied ever having seen before any more than he
had ever seen a bomb until one had been introduced in court during
the examination of witnesses.</p>

<p>After the defendants had finished speaking, the magistrates held
consultation together for a few moments, when they ordered the
prisoners to be committed for trial. The nineteen miserable
wretches were hurried off to their cells, and the court cleared for
the day.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI.</h2>

<p>"Ah, yes, that is the question of all questions, after all.
Whatever will become of the poor working men and women if things go
on as they are doing? I sometimes think I am the most unfortunate
being in the world, lying here in this cold, dark cell, with no
face to cheer me&mdash;not even that of my worst enemy, much less
of my friends. And I am remanded for trial, eh? Oh, yes, of course,
the same old mockery to be repeated, lying perjurors to concoct
falsehoods and predetermined judges to pass unjust judgment upon
me. I suppose I'll be hung. But what of that. 'Good men must not
obey the laws too well,' said Emerson, which of course means that
good men must pay the penalty of their disobedience to those unjust
laws. But what's the penalty after all? The worst they can do is
take one's life. And what is the life of a proletariat? Only a life
of drudgery, anxiety, poverty, and anguish; a life of death, for
all life's noblest pleasure are denied us, and what we call our
life is but one ceaseless round of toiling bondage to our fellows
who whip and starve us to a welcome grave. Hallo! who's this?"</p>

<p>It was the turnkey who entered and announced that a visitor was
waiting an interview with the prisoner. Holdfast was removed to the
visiting place, a sort of bird-cage, with strong iron bars between
the prisoner and the visitor, and wire work all round it to prevent
friends from passing anything through to the unfortunate occupants.
Looking through the bars, Harry instantly recognised who it was,
and a sort of painful joy flitted across his troubled, though
sanguine, features. It was a pale young woman, trembling with
emotion, and striving hard to thrust back the bitter tears that
come to solace woman in despair.</p>

<p>"Hypatia," said Harry, "is it you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my poor friend, it is. What <i>can</i> I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Hypatia, nothing."</p>

<p>There was a silence&mdash;a painful silence such as one almost
fancies one can hear. These two brave spirits, male and female,
stood looking in each other's faces. Oh! that the foes of humanity
could have seen that look. Oh, that the cold heart of a Shylock
might have been there to have withered under the burning
intellectual glances.</p>

<p>"Harry, I must do something for you," said Hypatia at last. "I
cannot, dare not, stand idly by, and see these human tigers take
your life. I cannot part with you. To know and understand each
other as you and I have done for these long years is to be united
in a bond whose strength no earthly priest or lawyer could
conceive. I would not die for you, as lovers do in lackadaisy
tales. For one to live without the other would be death to that one
that remained. No, Harry rather than die to save your life, I'd
kill the fiend who took that life and kill off all his kind."</p>

<p>Here the turnkey rudely interrupted the conversation and said it
must be confined to family matters.</p>

<p>"Harry," continued Hypatia, "listen while I tell you something.
Since your committal, I have had a proposal of salvation offered
out to me. Ugh! how it infuriates me to think of it! That fiend,
that human and licentious monster, Grindall, has dared to promise
me your perfect freedom if I will sate his lust with holy
matrimony. As though Love's passion could he bought and sold! As
though a <i>woman</i> could become a prostitute in marriage e'en
though it save her lover's life. No, Harry, I resented the insult.
I struck him. He called the servants and ordered my arrest. But I
was a match for the tyrant, and he well knew it.</p>

<p>I told him that if he laid a hand upon me, the injury would cost
him his life. I told him, too, that scores, aye hundreds of victims
of his past wrong-doing were waiting at his gate to help me should
I call upon them. And I reminded him that not one single servant
could he depend upon when once I told them his unholy motives. It
was enough. It struck the cur, and smote his wretched semblance of
a conscience. Dismissing the servants, he ordered my departure
before further trouble ensued. But calling me aside, he guaranteed
your freedom if I would sojourn with him one brief day. Again I
struck him; and he fell. He glared at me just like some wretched
quadruped defeated in its carnal lust&mdash;a tyrant and a cur! I
left, and have not seen him since."</p>

<p>"Hypatia, noble girl, you have suffered more than I. Oh, that we
could brave the world together! But no, I must wait my captors'
pleasure I cannot help you yet, Hypatia, nor can you help me. But
let us wait our time. For years I have waited for a home that I
could take you to, there to call you wife and know you worthy to
accept that name; for years have I struggled against wrong and
injustice to get a little hold upon this poor brigand-captured
earth that you and I may dwell together on a spot that even greedy
tyrants would not drive us from. But our time has not yet come. We
can only wait, and nerve ourselves to endure the blows of our
oppressors. Some day we may strike the blow."</p>

<p>"And we shall. And now I must be gone; the turnkey objects to
our conversation. Good-bye, Harry."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII.</h2>

<p>At last the day for the hearing of the eventful trial arrived.
Throngs of people were assembled about the junction of Lonsdale and
William Streets long before the appointed hour, anxious to be among
the fortunate few to get into the courthouse or to learn the latest
scraps of information concerning the unfortunate prisoners. Large
numbers of troopers and militiamen were stationed amongst the crowd
to preserve order and to prevent any serious breach of the peace,
for a strong feeling had grown up amongst the people that the
prisoners were the victims of a vile persecution and that the
almost certain sentence of death would be an unearned martyrdom
that should be resisted at all hazards. No one had dared to openly
express sympathy with the accused, for the press had already
significantly hinted at the fate of any who should be so daring.
All labor meetings had been strictly forbidden; red flags were
confiscated wherever they could be found; revolutionary literature
was being seized in all directions; and open air meetings of any
kind absolutely forbidden.</p>

<p>In fact, the Legislature had taken special measures to meet the
emergency, and a special act of Parliament was passed making it a
penal offence for anyone at any meeting whatever to advocate any
unlawful course to accomplish a lawful object; and it furthermore
decreed that if anyone did so suggest, by speech or print, any
unlawful course to accomplish any lawful or unlawful object, that
he should be held guilty of conspiracy, and that if any life were
lost he should be guilty of murder, even if he had not heard the
speech or read the print; and it furthermore decreed that anyone
present at such a meeting, or assisting in the compilation,
printing, or distributing of such print, should be held equally
responsible with the speaker or writer thereof. And this astounding
outrage on the boasted liberty of the subject was allowed to become
law practically without protest or delay.</p>

<p>The workers had waited many scores of years for legislation to
ensure them steady employment and the fruits of their labor, and
they had witnessed governments go in and out, but the legislative
measure that was to bring justice to them had never come. And yet
this dastardly measure to gag and destroy them was passed through
both houses of the legislature, and had become law in three brief
hours! It was rumoured that the labor representatives, and others
who would in all probability have opposed the passage of the Bill,
were bribed by large grants of land in an estate through which a
proposed railway service was to be carried, and for which an
enormous sum of money was voted just after the infamous "Seditious
Conspiracy Bill" became law, and which promised enormous fortunes
to its lucky promoters.</p>

<p>It was during the excitement consequent upon these remarkable
legislative measures that the trial of the Melbourne Rioters took
place. The evidence at the Criminal Court was alike to that in the
lower court, and very little fresh matter was introduced, the
witnesses for the prosecution repeating their former evidence and
forging a complete network of damnatory evidence around the
prisoners, who on their part repeated their innocence, refused to
bring witnesses to what they asserted to be hatched up conspiracies
that never existed and which could therefore have no witnesses, and
asked the jury to honorably acquit them. The whole affair did not
take long, for none were anxious to prolong it. And then came the
judicial address to the bench. There was a fearful silence for a
few moments. Then the judge solemnly and quietly delivered his
charge. After the usual preliminary instructions regarding the
nature of the charges, the duties of the jury, and the heavy
responsibility that rested upon their shoulders, he proceeded as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury&mdash;It is now your solemn duty, after
considering the evidence and hearing the instructions I have given
you, to decide whether the prisoners are guilty or guiltless of the
charges laid against them. The charge is the worst that can
possibly be laid against any human being, for it is that of
violently and maliciously depriving another human being of that,
which is dearer than all else to him, his life. Do not be guided by
the sentiments that the learned counsel for both sides have
conjured before you; for it is not your place to be swayed by fine
sentiments, or any appeal to the sympathies; but it is your place
to now finally decide, from the evidence placed before you, whether
those unfortunate men now standing in the dock are guilty, or not
guilty, of the charges laid against them. Their lives hang by a
thread, and that thread is in your hands with all its grave
responsibilities. If you cut that thread, you take those human
lives.</p>

<p>Hence you must be discreet, you must be certain, you must be
true in your convictions, and courageous in your verdict. Society
now reposes its confidence for security in yourselves. If those men
are guilty of the ferocious deeds assigned to them, it looks to you
to preserve it from the ravages of them and others like them, by
deciding the one small word that shall launch them into eternity.
Do not be swayed by considerations concerning your own personal
security, or the threats of vengeance held out by the friends of
the accused, nor do you allow friendships or other ties of sympathy
to turn you from the strict execution of justice. But if on the
evidence you are satisfied they are deserving of the extreme
penalty of the law, find them 'Guilty'.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you do not think the evidence conclusive
against them; if there is doubt of guilt in your minds; if you
believe from the evidence they have not committed the crimes laid
to their charge, but that the guilt rests with others; or if you
think they were justified in such actions as they took, according
to the laws of the land, then hesitate ere you seal their
doom&mdash;acquit them. But whatever you decide, do not decide
rashly, but let justice and the law sway your deliberations and
determine your conclusions. Turning to the evidence, we find it
asserted the accused are members of a gang of conspirators,
belonging to an organization known as the Knights of Revenge. The
prisoners are unanimous in denying this, though unfortunately they
do not bring evidence to attempt to disprove it, and they have the
sworn evidence against them of different witnesses who assert that
such a body does exist and that the accused are members of it. This
society; according to the witnesses for the prosecution, publishes,
or published, an unlawful and seditious paper called
<i>Vengeance</i>, wherein the cruel massacre of May 1st was planned
and the lives and properties of certain worthy citizens, threatened
with destruction.</p>

<p>Explosives were secreted by one or more of the prisoners,
similar to those used during the riot and produced in court. The
accused used violent and seditious language at the meeting in
question and called on the populace to resort to the violence that
subsequently took place, when six hundred and five men, women and
children were massacred, the accused having caused and assisted in
that murder, according to the evidence of the prosecution. For the
defence, there was unfortunately no sworn evidence forthcoming, the
accused doggedly refusing to bring forward witnesses, or to give
sworn evidence themselves, declaring the verdict to be a
predetermined conspiracy against them.</p>

<p>All they had done had been to protest their innocence&mdash;a
thing nearly all criminal, as well as guiltless persons had done
before them; and therefore their protest had no value in the eyes
of the law. The manufacture and storage of the explosives had been
proven, and although the accused had denied complicity they had
failed to bring forward any evidence in support of their denial.
The letters from the secretary of the organization had had their
authenticity denied by the reputed writer of them, who had produced
other letters asserted to have been written by him and which
certainly did not appear to be from the same pen. He had, however,
failed to bring the reputed recipients of the letters into the
witness box, and it was for the jury to determine whether they were
genuine and of any value as evidence.</p>

<p>They had also attempted to show that the witnesses had
contradicted each other, thus destroying the reliability of the
evidence, one of the witnesses having stated that a member of the
accused had come out to the colony with him two years after the
time that another witness had asserted his presence in Melbourne in
complicity with the secret society...Such is the nature of the
evidence before you, Gentlemen of the Jury, and I charge you to
consider it well, that you may deal justly with the accused, not
convicting them if you think any uncertainty exists concerning the
guilt alleged against them, but giving them an impartial and
honorable acquittal by a verdict of 'Not Guilty;' and, on the other
hand, if the evidence seems to you conclusive proof of their guilt,
that you bring in the only verdict possible under the
circumstances,&mdash;the verdict which shall cause these wretched
men to suffer the extreme penalty of the law&mdash;the verdict of
'Guilty'!"</p>

<p>The jury retired for a few minutes, and a painful suspense was
felt all through the court while the fatal verdict was waited for.
After about fifteen minutes the jury reappeared; and the foreman,
his voice trembling with emotion, reported their decision as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We find the prisoners, Thomas Treadway, Harry Holdfast, Samuel
Sharples, Thomas Smith, Frederick Thompson, Thomas Harrison,
William Spencer, James Grace, Alfred Jackson, Michael O'Halloran,
Phillip Williams, Joseph Marks, William Wilson, Adolph Nortier,
Henry White, Rupert Blackman, Edwin Christopherson, Patrick Murphy,
and Phelim O'Dowd guilty of wilful murder; but we recommend Thomas
Treadway and Harry Holdfast to mercy on account of the inconclusive
nature of some of the evidence brought against them."</p>

<p>The judge was not long in passing the fatal sentences. With a
few well chosen words, warning them of the awful fate that awaited
them, he condemned Tom Treadway and Harry Holdfast to imprisonment
for life; the others he sentenced to death.</p>

<p>There was a sigh of relief, and all eyes were turned towards the
prisoners, some of whom broke down with grief at the awful
sentence; though most of them retained their composure and prepared
to meet their doom as only martyrs in a glorious cause can do.
There was, however, a feeling of dissatisfaction on the brows of
Treadway and Holdfast, who begged to be "murdered" along with their
comrades rather than rot to death in a prison cell. But their
request was unheeded. All the prisoners were hastily removed, and
the court cleared. Immediately on the sentence being made known
outside the court, loud groans were heard; the faces of the
multitude were sullen and angered. It was threatened that if the
men's lives were to be forfeited an attempt would he made to
liberate them and to destroy the judge and every juryman and
witness who had gone against them. And now the terrible hour had
arrived. Now the fatal blow was to be struck, and Melbourne was to
reek with blood, and a "Caesar's Column" to be played in grim
reality!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII.</h2>

<p>In the front room of a small brick cottage in Carlton, a number
of men and women were gathered together, talking earnestly over the
great trial of the Melbourne Rioters, with an earnestness and an
intimacy with the facts that showed them to be active participators
in the struggle just described. One of the men present had in his
hand a copy of the <i>Evening Echo</i>, from which he was reading
the latest particulars of the trial to his attentive listeners.</p>

<p>"There," said he at length, placing the paper on the table, "now
you see what it has come to. I told you these villains would have
their blood, as they had already taken the blood of the noble
martyrs of Chicago; and if we don't look out, mark my words,
they'll have the lives of everyone else of us too."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't much matter, Smythers; life isn't worth much to
us when we can't earn a pound a week, and it costs us more than
that to pay our rent and purchase our food and clothing," said one
of the younger members of the party.</p>

<p>"More fool you to pay your rent, Wilberforce, when the money you
earn belongs to your starving family and not to an overfed
landlord. If you had all refused to pay your rents and pointed a
revolver at the first chap who demanded it, these troubles would
never have overtaken us. What are you going to do now? I suppose
you are going to sit here like a lot of curs and let those poor
devils be murdered, when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not that we are curs," interjected another, "we'd as soon
put an end to this cursed business as you would yourself, Bill, but
we can't do what we like, and no more can you. I only wish I could
see some way of frustrating their schemes, and preventing more
bloodshed. But what can we do against the power of money? When it
comes to this, that hundreds of innocent working men and women can
be shot down at the secret instigation of the wealthy, and then
hang our leaders who are equally innocent with the other victims, I
think it's time we called a halt somewhere and began to talk sense
instead of violence."</p>

<p>"That's always you, Walton, showing the white feather just like
Holdfast does with his talk about peaceful co-operation," remarked
Felix Slymer, who occupied an arm chair in the corner of the room,
"you haven't the courage of Bill Smythers, so you want to stop him
because he shows some."</p>

<p>"Look here, Slymer," said Hypatia Stephens, who had hitherto
kept an attentive silence, "if you don't stop your shameful
allusions to Harry Holdfast, I'll make you regret it. Don't dare
charge him with cowardice in my presence, for I cannot endure it. I
know Harry too well to think him a coward. He is as brave and
honorable a fellow as ever breathed. Oh, that there were more like
him! Never slander him in my presence, or by the living God,
Slymer, you'll incur the wrath of an injured woman; and I think you
know what that means."</p>

<p>"I don't think we ought to quarrel now," said Walton, "and I
certainly think Slymer's remark uncalled for. We are met to fight
the common enemy, not each other."</p>

<p>This remark met with general approval, and the business of the
meeting was proceeded with.</p>

<p>"Well, comrades," said Smythers, "to test the feeling of the
meeting, I'll propose that we post spies in all directions to watch
the movements of our adversaries. Each spy shall carry a bomb to
protect his life in case of emergency, but not for purposes of
aggression. Near each spy we shall put a group of secret soldiers,
each of whom shall be well armed with bombs and other weapons of
destruction carefully concealed about their persons; their dress
shall also be disguised to make them resemble ordinary working men
carrying on their usual occupations, and as messengers of the
plutocracy carrying letters and messages; they shall also be sworn
in as Special Constables under fictitious names, and shall now and
then furnish secret reports of bogus plots to influential public
personages. We have full lists of all the jurymen and witnesses who
assisted the judge in ordering the murder of our comrades, and have
already a number of trustworthy men and women watching their every
movement and in many cases in close confidence with them. In fact,
since the trial first came on, we have been carefully working up an
organization similar to that hoax called the Knights of Revenge,
and have met with unexpected support and encouragement. Comrade
Slymer can corroborate my words."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Slymer, "Smythers is correct; and although it would
not be prudent for me to say much about it here, because 'walls
have ears,' I have no hesitation in saying that our success is
certain. I gladly support the proposition."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that these persons of whom you speak, the
spies and 'soldiers,' are under any organized direction from some
executive body or other recognized authority?" asked one.</p>

<p>"I can only answer Mr. Millar's question by stating that all who
have volunteered those duties, and are now performing them, have
hitherto done so solely under the supervision of myself and Slymer,
and two others who for certain reasons dare not be present. We are
mainly met here to consider what to do in the present crisis, and
to see if we can appoint such an executive out of the present
meeting."</p>

<p>After a considerable amount of talking, the proposed executive
was formed and the majority of those present swore in their
adherence to the new body; the remainder, among whom were Hypatia
Stephens, Harry Walton, and Fred Wilberforce, taking their
departure. Then the remainder proceeded to "business." The new
organization was named The Band of Justice; but they also adopted
another name by which to be known to the outside world&mdash;The
Excelsior Mutual Improvement Society. The adoption of this latter
name would enable them to stave off the curiosity of the public,
and to conduct private meetings without raising suspicion, even in
the ante-rooms of public halls.</p>

<p>Then the necessary arrangements were made to carry out the
objects of the Band by appointing each to his particular office,
having the necessary pass-words and grips, fixing the dates and
places of their future movements, and attending to many other
details that were necessary to deal with on the occasion. Special
pains were taken to avoid the finding of any documentary evidence
of any members of the Band by any of the authorities or spies; and
for that reason an easily remembered cypher was adopted to express
several important words that would be in frequent use by them, and
the secretary, Felix Slymer, was instructed to keep no minutes or
accounts of the Band's transactions. Having made all these
necessary arrangements, the members dispersed for the night, each
entrusted with a part in the fulfilment of their dangerous
mission.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX.</h2>

<p>When Hypatia and the others left the conspirators' meeting in
the Carlton cottage, they did not go each at once to their several
homes; but slowly walking down Lygon Street together, and keeping
on the road to avoid listeners as much as possible, they talked
quietly together over the meeting they had just left and the
general state of public affairs. They did not dare stand together
conversing, as it would be sure to excite suspicion, and they did
not know but that the first person they met might be some secret
detective.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Fred Wilberforce, after they had been
conversing for some time, "that nothing will come of all our
efforts after all. The more I think over it, the more satisfied I
am that the present state of affairs is as likely to endure as it
was to come. What can you do with the workers when they never
trouble about their condition until it is too late? They are
certainly very anxious just now, and seem as if they were fully
resolved on doing desperate deeds; but they won't do anything. Look
at Smythers and those fellows trying to organize a revolutionary
conspiracy amongst a lot of fools whose whole thoughts are occupied
with such childish absurdities as a football or cricket match, who
can tell you the names, weights and pedigrees of the winners of the
Melbourne Cup in past years or the probable winning horses of this,
and whose chief literary food is the perusal of penny comic papers
whose is on an intellectual level with that of a children's
nursery; while the preservation of their health or their liberty is
a thing they never think about, but only call you a 'crank' if you
mention it to them!"</p>

<p>"That is very true," replied Harry, "but it isn't everything.
You might have added that when they can't find food for themselves
and their families they always manage to poison themselves with
alcohol or tobacco. But on the other hand, you must remember that
nations in the past have had the same vices and yet have effected
mighty changes of one kind or another. The legislative charlatans
who now bamboozle the proletaire by granting land for football
grounds are only imitating the tyrants of mediaeval days who
blinded the people with gladiatorial combats while they forged the
chains of slavery tighter round their necks. But some day the slave
awakes, and the chains are broken; and who knows but what the
slaves of modern Melbourne capitalism may not someday do likewise?
I shall not be surprised to see them do so in the present struggle,
even before the fatal verdict of to-day is carried out; but I am
afraid they are not yet ripe for a victorious rebellion."</p>

<p>"Do you think the penalties will be carried out?" asked
Hypatia.</p>

<p>"I do not see why they should not," replied Walton. "The
machinery of the law is powerful; the execution of its decrees are
firmly established by custom, and are not likely to be generally
resisted; the people willingly permit their rulers to pass laws to
gag them; and even were they resolved on resistance they cannot
trust each other, for each does not know but what his dearest
friend may prove a traitor. The authorities, on the other hand,
have to deal with a people who are proverbially apathetic, stupid,
helpless, and loyal. For generations they have submitted to the
most outrageously unjust laws, and shamefully proclaimed their
allegiance to them by boasting that all their actions were
'constitutional'!"</p>

<p>"You spoke of traitors," responded Hypatia, "don't you think
that Felix Slymer is one?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't, Miss Stephens; and really I think you are wronging
a worthy fellow when you suggest that he is. I know there is a sort
of jealousy or dislike between Holdfast and him; but I see nothing
to warrant it. He is always to the front&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; not always."</p>

<p>"Well, as often as anyone. He is now working up this new secret
organization; he is a courageous and able advocate of revolutionary
principles; and he is one of the most popular and influential
members the labor party have. Although I cannot always agree with
him or work with him, I often wish we had more like him."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Walton," remarked Fred. "I think our
friend misjudges him. Although I believe him to be rather rash and
altogether too sanguine, we couldn't very readily dispense with
him."</p>

<p>"But he would very readily dispense with you," was Hypatia's
sarcastic reply.</p>

<p>The three had now reached Victoria Street, where Hypatia entered
a passing tram, and they all separated and sought their respective
homes, there to enjoy nature's kindest gift to the troubled brain
of man&mdash;that delightful state of mental annihilation that he
calls "sleep."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X.</h2>

<p>The day at length arrived for the execution of the now famous
"Rioters." Ever since the trial, the public had kept very quiet.
The dreaded attack on the jurymen and witnesses after the trial not
been made, and disappointed curiosity thirsted in vain for
sensation. Day after day, angry groups of men were to be seen
moving here and there as though eager for the moment to arrive when
the blow should be struck; but still that moment did not arrive.
Men were seen loitering mysteriously about different parts of the
city, and every now and then they would be rudely told to "move on"
by the police, which they generally did with alacrity, either
thinking discretion "the better part valor" or perhaps patiently
waiting for their time to come when they should do the moving on
and the authorities of to-day should be their supplicants.</p>

<p>Rumor had it that every man "loafing" about the streets was a
member of the Knights of Revenge, or some such daring body. A few
others said they were only hungry victims of the present grave
depression, which, by the way, had almost been forgotten now that
affairs had assumed such a militant aspect. But no one seemed very
clear about the matter; and but for the their fears they might have
tired of speculating about it at all. But when the day arrived for
the dread ceremony to be performed, the pent up feelings of the
populace could not be subdued any longer.</p>

<p>Men began to say what they were thinking, and to say it rather
noisily. Women vied with the men in threats of vengeance, and
showed by their demeanor that they were in desperate earnest. Even
the police seemed to feel as if they had been sitting on a
slumbering volcano quite long enough, for they began to be
unusually haughty and officious, and were not at all scrupulous
about maltreating the citizens who had deputed them to carefully
watch over the them. All along the walls of the jail, at every
possible point, armed men were stationed. Thousands of police in
uniform or plain clothes mixed up with the tens of thousands who
waited outside its grim walls. Large bodies of soldiers were
stationed in all directions, and others throughout the city, at the
request of the Victorian Government many of them having come from
the adjoining colonies.</p>

<p>The latter were carefully posted in the most dangerous
positions, the authorities rightly reasoning that as they were
necessarily ill-informed on Melbourne affairs they would be less in
sympathy with the people, and therefore more amenable to duty and
more likely to fire upon their unfortunate fellow-men when ordered
to do so by their commanding officers. All the available mounted
troopers had been brought to the scene; and in their case, too,
care had been taken to place those accustomed to country duty in
the thickest part of the crowds. At last the hour for the execution
drew near, and the favored few within the walls prepared to assist
in, or witness, the revolting details with a zeal worthy of a
cannibal feast. The attendants went about their accustomed work
with almost as little unconcern as a cook would show in preparing
her meals. And the spectators showed a zeal even more intense.
There they waited, like human vultures, thirsting for the blood of
the unfortunate victims, waiting to gloat over the sight of a
species destroying its kind, waiting to hear the last despairing
words of the tortured, or to note the quivering muscles of the
unfortunate victims of human brutality.</p>

<p>There they were, like so many tigers&mdash;no, not like tigers,
for tigers and other quadrupeds do not devour their own species: it
is only man, brutal man, the boasted "lord of creation" who stoops
to such base deeds as that&mdash;there they were, waiting anxiously
to feast their brutal eyes on their actions. And at last those
victims came. Manfully and did they eye their captors. Nobly did
they hold their heads erect, as only <i>men</i> can hold them. Then
there was a profound silence as the brave fellows prepared to say
their parting words to their earthly tormentors. But, alas, this
was denied them. Tyranny durst not let its victims speak.</p>

<p>The devourer of his kind dare not hear the voice of him he would
devour. The martyrs words might echo outside the walls, and
perchance that echo might never die, but might herald in the
victim's retribution. So the authorities had decided that the
victims, like the martyrs of Chicago should be gagged before being
murdered. A few stifled cries were all that was heard; and
seventeen more human beings had suffered the utmost penalty of
man's brutality. The spectators were delighted. Law was triumphant.
It's power was vindicated. Its institutions were assured. And its
foes were crushed like worms beneath its feet!</p>

<p>Immediately that the news reached outside that the dread penalty
had been fulfilled, fearful groans rent the air, bitter curses were
heard in all directions, and the indignant millions madly and
despairingly rushed against the foes before them. Then followed a
scene that baffles all description. Men and women were frantically
rushing at each other like starving wild beasts; the armed butchers
of the law shooting down all who failed to assist them; truncheons
of police breaking every available skull; troopers' horses
trampling down anyone, and lances and swords spilling blood like a
bursted reservoir; buildings were flaming and consuming their
inmates; while in all directions explosives were flying, hurling
master and slave together to destruction. The combat was sharp; but
it was short. Madmen act with frenzy; but frenzy does not last.
Ammunition destroys; but ammunition runs out. And before long this
frightful combat was nothing but a few skirmishes here and there;
presently the earth slept in murderous silence.</p>

<p>But the conflict between master and servant had not been
ended.</p>

<p>The proletaire had not triumphed.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>It was a sad day that followed on the events just described. No
rioters were prosecuted, for no rioters remained. Blood had been
spilt, but freedom had not been found. Comrades, relatives, were
all missing. All, or nearly all, of the labor leaders were dead.
Though hundreds of the authorities were no more, thousands of
others filled their places. Men commenced again to seek for bread,
and failed to get it. They sought employers as of yore, but few
found employment. Landlords commenced again to send their
collectors for the rents, and the starving proletaire again
attempted his vain task of paying it. The plutocracy offered their
accursed gold, and the poor once more bowed down before it and
pawned their lives to Mammon from whom they could never redeem.
Crime went on merrily as of yore, and legislative charlatans waxed
fat on its creation; while the proletaire and the parasite vied
with each other in the practice of vice to drown their cares. Jails
continued to be built, and laws made to fill them. Women sold their
purity to man for a crust; and men made themselves bestial to win
woman's flattery. Children continued to be educated without
learning sense. Vanity and pomp flourished as destructively as
ever, and self-respect continued to be the rarest virtue.</p>

<p>The Melbourne Riots were over.</p>

<p>The Workers yet awaited their emancipation.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI.</h2>

<p>Fifteen years had passed since the events narrated in the last
chapter. The Melbourne Riots had become a matter of past history,
and the actors in it were getting fewer as years rolled on.
Melbourne, with all its wickedness, had grown, as all other wicked
cities grow, and had become a modern wonder. Industrial
improvements of all kinds had built it into something scarcely
conceivable by those who had existed in the "riot days," as they
got to be called. The finest architects of the world had come there
to take up their abode, and wealthy men had employed them to build
some of the finest edifices in the world. The city was like a
magnificent palace, fit dwelling-place almost for a demigod. The
decorations of the houses, the dresses of the wealthy citizens, and
the wonderful advances made in locomotive, dietetic, and other
comforts, were amazing. Such was the appearance that it gave one on
first seeing it that the great international traveller, Sir
Hercules Crayon, could not help remarking that "If Paradise were to
be re-instituted on earth, this is where we would find it."</p>

<p>Certainly, that was but one side of the mighty city; and the
remarks of a critic were well chosen when he said that "Were
Paradise to visit us, unless she stopped her nose and stifled every
other sense, she'd soon turn up her toes." As a matter of fact,
things had gone on drifting in the one direction. Invention had
grown and had brought grand homes to the wealthy. But poverty had
grown just as rapidly and so had its accompanying vices. There was
no turning back from the order of social evolution; but a constant
extension of the old order of things. It may easily be surmised
that along with this growth of poverty, alongside of wealth, the
organizations of the discontented still continued to find a place.
One of the most important of those organizations was that of The
Brotherhood of the New Socialism which met weekly in a large room
in a house in Latrobe Street.</p>

<p>The meetings of the Brotherhood of the New Socialism were
usually not much out of the ordinary run of such gatherings. The
workers met there to declaim against the injustices of the existing
social order, the perfidy of the politicians, the increasing
disparity between rich and poor, and the hopes that the newest
schools of socialistic thought held out to the hungry and
oppressed. There were generally the usual stock speakers, armed
with the usual stock resolutions that signified nothing. Sometimes,
however, there was a more or less unexpected change of programme;
and at the particular meeting that is just going to be described
the proceedings were enlivened by affairs certainly very much out
of the common. It was the usual Thursday evening when the
Brotherhood were to meet, and various people were making their way
up the steps to the room where the proceedings were to be carried
on, when a rather elderly man, whom one might take to be close on
fifty years of age, but whose manner nevertheless was more like
that of a younger man, accosted one of the Brotherhood stationed at
the door.</p>

<p>"Is this where the Socialists are meeting, and if so, are
strangers permitted to attend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was the reply, "everybody is welcome. Go upstairs
after the others there."</p>

<p>The old gentleman followed as directed, and soon found himself
in a large comfortable room, capable of seating about two hundred
persons, although there were only about fifty present. It was now
time to commence, and the chairman called on the pianist to open
with a suitable piece, which he did by playing the "Marseillaise"
in first-rate style. Then a few songs were sung, mostly the
familiar songs of the day, and one gentleman recited Charles
Mackay's stirring poem "Eternal Justice," which elicited vigorous
applause. After which one of the Brotherhood recited the following
with some warmth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">A CALL TO THE WORKERS.<br>
<br>
Come lads, rouse yourselves, for the night is grown darker,<br>
The sad cry of anguish is louder than yore,<br>
The victims of labor--of <i>unwanted</i> labor--<br>
Are crying at your feet, and their numbers grow more.<br>
<br>
'Twas said, in the sweat of his brow, that the toiler<br>
Should eat his bread; but, alas, 'tie too true<br>
That he who toils hardest has least of earth's bounties,<br>
Whilst plenty rewards him who toil scorns to do.<br>
<br>
Oh, brothers, is this what our fathers have fought for?<br>
Is this but the outcome of thousands of years<br>
Of thinking, and trying, and doing for their fellows<br>
By lawgivers, scientists, thinkers and seers!<br>
<br>
Is man born to live and to die unrewarded?<br>
Are all his best efforts to be spent in vain?<br>
Shall idleness <i>always</i> enjoy of the good things?<br>
Is labor doomed always to toil and complain?<br>
<br>
'Tis said that the poor we have with us at all times;<br>
Alas for the world, that 'twas so in the past;<br>
But, brothers, because we have long suffered evil,<br>
Dost follow we should suffer evil to last?<br>
<br>
Oh, poor fellow creatures so long thy injustice--<br>
So long hast thou bent under tyranny's hand--<br>
So long bast thou crouched 'neath the whip of thy master,<br>
Thou durst not look upright, thou fearest to stand.<br>
<br>
Oh, brothers, cast off the dead load of oppression<br>
That Cunning has heaped upon Labor's strong form--<br>
So cunningly heaped that the victim who bears it<br>
Scarce knows of its presence, except when the storm<br>
<br>
Of righteous rebellion breaks out in its fury,<br>
And Slavery strikes in its blind frenzied might,<br>
And throws at proud Capital, bloated but helpless,<br>
The force of a True Thought, the bombshell of Right.<br>
<br>
Alas, ah ray brothers, so long used to serfdom,<br>
So ready to fawn, and to cringe, and to crawl<br>
Before the vile monster thy toil hath created,<br>
The Doer of Nothing, the Filcher of All!<br>
<br>
Then courage, my brothers, arise in your manhood,<br>
Stand firmly together and dare the whole world--<br>
A world in which thou hast no claim of possession,<br>
The Idler's domain, from which Labor is hurled.<br>
<br>
Rise up, and ask not your oppressors for favors,<br>
For loans, or for mercy, or justice, or gain;<br>
To Hell with Monopoly and its defenders<br>
<i>The world is your own when yes dare lay the claim.</i></p>

<p>The chairman then thanked the comrades for entertaining them,
and said William Treadway would introduce the principal business of
the evening with his promised address on "Labor's Hopes and
Prospects." An intelligent looking young man here arose, and
mounted the platform, the applause that greeted him showing that he
was a familiar favorite amongst them. Without any ceremony, he
commenced his address, the elderly stranger eyeing him with eager
attention.</p>

<p>"I shall not trouble you to-night," said he, "with a repetition
of the questions we are always discussing as to the sufferings of
the working classes. We are already too painfully familiar with
them. Nor will I weary you with the conventional platitudes that
must be as tiring to you as to myself. But I will endeavor to treat
the subject as thoroughly and clearly as I can in order that some
real good may come of it. It is now fifteen years since my poor
father lost his liberty in striving to do what we are still
striving for; and when I look back I ask myself, What has been
accomplished in that time? I think, comrades, you will agree with
me when I say 'nothing.'</p>

<p>Of course, I was but a lad at the time of the famous riots, and
have a very imperfect knowledge of the facts connected with it. I
lost my dear mother, as many of you may know, in the bloody
massacre that took place upon the execution of 'the Noble
Seventeen,' and my father was taken from me at the same time, never
to see my face again; for as you know, he died three years ago in
jail&mdash;died, so they say, from an hereditary and incurable
disease; though I firmly believe they foully murdered him because
they could not break his indomitable spirit. I have no relatives
surviving that unhappy day, so I can but glean my information from
the historical sources known to you all. I have principally taken
my facts from 'McCulloch's History of the Melbourne Riots,' of
which a valuable three-volume edition is in the Public Library.</p>

<p>What do I find from a carefully study of it? Why, that matters
are no better now than they were in the pre-Riot days; that poverty
is as keen as then, if not worse; that the apathy of the masses,
their ignorance, their scramble after recreation when they required
bread, and their treacherous actions towards their truest champions
were as common then as now. And I find too that they rested on the
same hopes as we do. They vainly waited, as we are waiting, for
honest legislators, just laws, a wide diffusion of humanitarian
sentiments, mutual sympathies, the disappearance of vicious habits,
and all those other elements that we contend are the essential
precursors of the glorious social life for which we are striving.
But I now see where they erred, and where you, friends, are erring
along with them. <i>They trusted to bad conditions to create good
human beings</i>. They tolerated the institutions of human slavery,
and hoped, poor fools, for the day when the slave should be noble
and the slave-master kind. They believed that the human race was
wicked, that it gloried in its wickedness, and that all the vices
and crimes it committed were but the natural manifestations of its
totally depraved nature.</p>

<p>They thought the individual character was superior to the
conditions environing it&mdash;that the human will was free, and
therefore responsible for the individual's wicked actions (although
inconsistently giving it small credit for his good
actions)&mdash;that man's nature was bad, bad, irretrievably bad,
and therefore that his fellows should treat him with the brutality
inherent in their own brutal natures and so richly deserved by the
brutal nature of himself. But, friends, I find this is a lie, a
fiendish falsehood, a slander on humanity. I find that the man is
what his circumstances make him. That great reformer, Robert Owen,
was right when he said that 'the character is not made <i>by</i>
but <i>for</i> the individual.' If you put me in bad circumstances,
you make me a bad man. If you enslave me, I learn in to rejoice in
slavery. If you treat me brutally, you encourage brutality in my
nature, and I act brutally to you. If in this land, which naturally
belongs to all you who live upon it, you give me a special
privilege to the ownership of this land, you make me a tyrant, and
I cannot help but act like a tyrant; and you make yourselves my
serfs and cowardly cringing curs willing to lick my feet in truly
slave-like fashion, that I may graciously afford you permit to toil
on the land I have deprived you of. Then you hate me, because I am
your master; and I hate you because you are my slave.</p>

<p>We pretend to love each other to win each other's favors, but in
our hearts we love each one himself and eye the other with
suspicion and mistrust. So it is throughout all society. All true
morality is forbidden by the very laws under which we are
associated. The landlord, despite his higher sentiments of love and
justice, must rack the rents from starving toilers lest he become a
toiler and wear out his life's blood for others. The remorseless
usurer must stifle his conscience, and forge the yoke of Mammon
round the neck of the proletaire that he may extort, by interest,
the product of their toil, lest he someday perform that endless,
fruitless toil himself. The legislator, offered bribes of wealth
and power, dare not be true to manhood and refuse those bribes,
lest he lose all his power and join the toiling proletaires who
waste their wretched lives in others' gain. No, friends, we have
fought on wrong lines. We have hoped to achieve fraternity by
creating bitter antipathy. Our preachers have called on men to be
honorable, while supporting all the institutions which compel us to
be dishonorable. Every so-called 'revolution' has been a failure,
because all the evil conditions were allowed to remain and new
tyrants were created out of old institutions. The cannibal, with
his chiefs and warriors, makes war upon his brother cannibal and
eats him.</p>

<p>The civilized man, with his rulers and their subordinates, makes
war also upon his civilized brother, and he too devours him, but he
devours him with the law instead of with his teeth. All those
men,&mdash;cannibal or civilized,&mdash;are the creatures of their
conditions, the victims of power and plunder. But, fortunately for
the human race, there are exceptions to the general rule of mutual
theft and destruction. The Doukhoborys, the Masinkers, the Veddahs,
and others who lack our civilized customs of law and disorder, have
shown us that man is moral when the conditions of his existence are
such as necessitate morality.</p>

<p>They have shown us that when man lives on his own efforts,
instead of on his neighbor, that he daily enjoys the noble virtues
of universal friendship, health and contentment that we only dream
of; and that they who have no laws over them are 'a law unto
themselves,' and that self-instructing law invariably teaches them
that as they do unto others so do others unto them; and they have
shown us that while dishonesty, lying and poverty are the general
lot of those who tolerate our institutions, such evils are utterly
unknown to them, and everyone is honest, truthful and as wealthy as
he chooses to be by his own efforts. What a world of wasted efforts
might have been spared had humanity but learned these lessons that
nature is everywhere teaching him! Generations after generations
have passed away, while poets, philosophers, and preachers were
calling on the people to live good lives in harmony with each
other; but the efforts of all those generations have been spent in
vain.</p>

<p>Had those noble minds but united their efforts in finding out
the social conditions that generate morality, and then worked
together to establish those conditions, in a few months or years
they could have achieved them; and you and I, friends, might now be
enjoying the glorious benefits of their wise actions, and the
Melbourne Riots need never have blotted the pages of earth's
history. If we tolerate bad conditions, we will preach in vain to
make good men and women. If we create good conditions, we would
preach in vain to make those men and women bad. For they are ever
the creatures of their circumstances&mdash;the moral product of
their surrounding.</p>

<p>In lands where monopolies and legal plunders flourish, there the
priesthoods preach morality, but they and their hearers continue
immoral. In lands of freedom and unrestricted opportunity, there no
preachers are found or needed to teach morality, because all are
moral. Our present society, therefore, cannot progress as we wish
it; and all our socialistic teaching is but labor thrown away,
because the conditions of life are opposed to our teachings, the
present order is not a social but an anti-social one, and even we
who aspire to lead society are corrupted by it. Socialistic
propaganda is like the cry of the shipwrecked mariner in mid-ocean,
and meets with no response. If we want to succeed, we must carry
our thoughts into practice.</p>

<p>The world has learned how to hate: we must teach it how to love.
It has learned how to oppress and steal: we must teach it how to
render mutual assistance and be honest. Can we do this? If not,
then Socialism is a failure, and Goodness is a word that deserves
no place in man's vocabulary. But I believe, friends, it is
possible for us to introduce here the elements of goodness that
others have found, and to find, even in barbarous Melbourne, a
congenial soil in which to transplant them. But how shall we do it?
What determined, united action shall we take? That, friends, I do
not pretend to be able yet to answer. I can only say that I have
determined to find the way from chaos into freedom, and when I have
found it to devote my whole life's efforts into carrying it out for
the mutual good of myself and my fellow men."</p>

<p>The applause that followed on young Treadway's speech was marked
with real enthusiasm, and the chairman took occasion to remark that
he felt it worth more than mere passing comment, and hoped that
something really tangible would come out of it. The platform was
declared open for other speakers; but no one seemed anxious to come
forward after the brilliant speech they had just listened to.</p>

<p>At last the elderly stranger stood up in the hall.</p>

<p>"Do you permit a visitor to speak?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the chairman, "come to the platform."</p>

<p>The elderly gentleman lost no time in doing as requested.</p>

<p>"Friends," said he, "for I feel I must address you thus,
although an utter stranger,&mdash;I have listened attentively to
the able and thoughtful speech of the young man who has just
spoken, and I must say he deserves more than credit for it&mdash;he
fully deserves to have his wish fulfilled (applause). I may tell
you that I have gone through the scenes he has spoken of, and
although I never before heard of McCulloch's work on the subject, I
can assure you the conditions of society in those days, and the
hopes and aspirations of the people, were just as he has described
them. Although I have been scarcely three weeks roaming in your
city, I can see that no change has occurred in the past fifteen
years for which you need be grateful.</p>

<p>Certainly the buildings have become more stupendous, and the
luxury of the few is more like that of an Eastern monarch than what
the plutocracy of Melbourne enjoyed before; but the conditions of
life are no better&mdash;in fact, they are actually worse than I
knew them. I told you I have been roaming through your streets for
the past few weeks, but do not think I come from any other city,
for I have been all these years an inmate of your jail, having been
incarcerated there for complicity in the riots.</p>

<p>"But you are not Holdfast?" asked the chairman.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, I used to be well known as Harry Holdfast, although I
don't suppose I have 'carried my years' quite so well in
confinement as I might have done with proper air and sunshine. The
authorities have released me, as my conduct appears to have
satisfied them; though I understand they did it as quietly as
possible to prevent any demonstration on the part of the public,
and that is why I have not found you before. However, here I am,
And now I wish to say that all the time I have been confined I have
brooded over this awful problem of the struggle between Labor and
Monopoly, and while coming to the same conclusions as the brilliant
son of my poor old friend, Treadway, I have found what I am sure is
the true solution. Therefore, if you will, grant me a little time,
I will be very glad to explain it to you, so that I can help you to
give the desired application to Treadway's principles, and assist
you by devoting my remaining days to the glorious cause of labor's
emancipation (applause). You all realize that the great trouble now
is that the few are very rich, and the many very poor; and you also
know that the wealthy are rich out of the legal robbery of the
others whom they thus impoverish. Of course, you know how this
comes about.</p>

<p>The world is monopolized in the hands of the few, and the
governments of the world exist to secure them in that monopoly. All
the great masses outside of that monopoly thus become the unwilling
slaves to the few favored monopolists. Of course they want to live;
but to do so they must work. They can't work in the air so they
turn to the land. But instantly the landlord catches them and tells
them it is his land, and if they want to use it they must give him
a part of their product from that land for the privilege of using
it. Of course, they can't do without it; so they give him what he
asks.</p>

<p>That is the first step in the plunder of the workers, and we
call it rent. Then when the worker wants to exchange the surplus
part of that product, over and above what he consumes and gives to
his landlord, for the surplus product of someone else, he has to do
so through a legal medium, which we call money. This of course he
has to borrow from the privileged monopolists who are 'chartered'
by the landlord government to issue it. But they demand that when
he pays it back, in a given time, he shall repay more than he
borrowed. This extortion is the next burden on the laborer, and
they call it <i>interest</i>, or usury. Of course, he can't pay
more then he borrows, though he agrees to; and so someday the
banker, who lent him the money, metaphorically gobbles him up, robs
him of all he has got and makes him a pauper, when he will perhaps
finish by imprisoning him for vagrancy. Then the officers, who run
this landlords' and bankers' government, want paying, as they are
not producers themselves, and that makes another big hole in the
worker's product, which we call <i>taxation</i>. But that is not
all. A man can't work on land unless he has tools. So if he is only
a worker, with nothing but his arms, he goes to one of the
fortunate possessors of the money (which alone buys the monopolized
lands and tools), and he asks him to let him use those tools.</p>

<p>This the employer agrees to do provided he gives him another
large slice out of his product, which of course the worker does,
and we call that slice the <i>profit</i>. The little slice that now
remains to the worker we call his <i>wages</i>; it is sometimes so
small that it takes a powerful economic microscope to find it
(laughter). Now, here is the way such an unjust system operates.
You go to work for a man, and in a given time produce an article,
say a suit of clothes, which he offers to sell you for £6. But he
only gives you £1 for your labor in producing it. So you produce
five more suits before you can afford to buy one, which you then
do. You have now a suit, and he has five, one of which he uses
himself. But you want to buy something else, so you ask him to let
you make more suits, as you want to earn more money. But he tells
you he can't till you buy the four that he has got by him. And so
you are thrown out of work. He calls that 'overproduction' and you
call yourself 'unemployed.'</p>

<p>All the workers under our present slave system are in exactly
the some position; and although there is a division of labor and a
distribution of products it doesn't alter the relations between
employer and employee a bit, but leaves them just as I have
described them. Now you see that if you got the full £6 for making
that suit, you could have bought it at once, and all this trouble
would have been avoided; you would have remained at work making
another to exchange with someone else; your employer would have had
to make his own instead of being idle; and everyone else would be
doing the same, and we would never have depressions or riots,
excessive wealth or poverty, but would all be happy and prosperous
mates like the Masinkers that Treadway told us about. Now, if you
will help me, I will show you how we can do it, and thereby earn
the gratitude of our fellow-men and better our own condition. If
you are agreeable I will fully explain the whole thing to you at
another meeting when you have more time, so that you can fully
understand it, and be prepared to help me in my efforts to
emancipate the workers of Melbourne and the whole civilized
world."</p>

<p>Immediately that Harry had done speaking, the meeting burst out
in furious applause; all the etiquette of public meetings was
forgotten, and nearly all rushed forward to greet the veteran
"agitator," with a warmth of handshaking that would have made one
think they had been intimate friends of years' standing instead of
a few minutes.</p>

<p>It was decided that the next week's meeting should be devoted to
Holdfast's lecture.</p>

<p>"One more thing before I go," said Holdfast. "Can you tell me
the present address of Miss Hypatia Stephens?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>No one could tell him, but some of them thought she had gone to
Benalla in a situation as general servant. She was rather well
known, although taking little part in public affairs, and had not
been heard of for over twelve months.</p>

<p>Harry went away, thanking them sincerely for their cordial
reception and their friendly intentions. But he thought of his poor
lost Hypatia; and he felt sad. Where could she be? Why was she not
near the jail when he was released; and now that he had been a free
(?) man for a fortnight why had he heard nothing from her in the
meantime? Perhaps, thought he, she is dead; she would not be silent
otherwise. And with this cruel thought racking his brains, he
sought the establishment wherein he lodged and tried to forget his
dear one in slumber. But sleep had forsaken him; and the poor
fellow laid in his bed in a mental agony more severe than any he
had experienced during his long imprisonment. He had faced the
world's torture all these years, only to find his life's hope
gone!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII.</h2>

<p>"I think I have seen your face before!"</p>

<p>"And I think I remember your's!"</p>

<p>The speakers were Harry Holdfast and a gentleman he had met in
the street a few days after the evening of Treadway's lecture. The
two had looked steadfastly into each other's face while passing,
and their eyes met and a mutual glance of recognition had prompted
the above remarks.</p>

<p>"Might I ask you your name?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. My name is Holdfast&mdash;Harry Holdfast. And
yours?"</p>

<p>"Frederick Wilberforce, your old friend and co-worker. Dear me,
to think I should meet you again! But how you have changed! It
can't be twenty years since I last saw you, and yet you look like
an old man. Where are you living?"</p>

<p>"Living? Well, I suppose it's living. I am trying to exist at
Fillemup's Restaurant, where I get a shilling a week, besides board
and lodging, such as it is, for doing all sorts of odd work and
helping in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Come along with me, then; I'll find something better for you
than that."</p>

<p>Harry, after a short conversation on the matter, willingly
agreed to go along with his old friend, being careful, however, to
deliver the letter with which he had been sent by his employer
before going to Wilberforce's. Arrived there, he wrote out a short
note to Mr. Fillemup, telling him he would not hold his situation
any longer, as he had found one more suitable, and he would forfeit
the week's wages due to him.</p>

<p>Wilberforce's place was a really comfortable one for Harry to be
in. It was a nice roomy house, with plenty of accommodation for a
few visitors, and adjoining it was a large hay and corn store, of
which Fred was the sole proprietor, and which was doing a very
large business indeed.</p>

<p>"And now, Harry, tell me a little of how you have been getting
on all these years. I have often thought of you, and wondered
whether I would ever see you again; and now that you are here, I
long to know all about you."</p>

<p>"All I can tell you is very little, Fred. A prisoner's life is
very much like that of any other prisoner, and the fact of his
being a political offender falsely charged with crime does not
cause him to he treated otherwise than as an actual criminal. One
thing, however, was in my favor, and of course distinguished me
from the exact treatment of a criminal: I commanded the respect of
the individuals in immediate authority over me, and was as kindly
treated by them as they dared let me be. I took every opportunity
to explain to them my true position, and I know they were really
sorry for me. One of them told me he often felt the falsity of his
own position, and realized that while he was there to assist in
keeping the criminal elements of society under subjection that he
knew many who were detained there were not really as bad as the
majority who still enjoyed their freedom, while the greatest
villains of all enjoyed their freedom.</p>

<p>He could not see how we could do without jails, but he thought
we might almost be as well without them when scores of legislators
and plutocrats were allowed to rob the struggling masses by
fraudulently conducting bogus building societies, banks, and other
financing institutions with impunity, and rarely paid the penalty
of their roguery, because they had a mutual understanding to
protect each other against legal prosecution when any of them were
detected by the public. But, Fred, I can tell you about all this
sort of thing any other time. I am longing to know how all my old
friends are getting on. Can you tell me anything about them?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course you know about your widowed mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I learned that she died of a broken heart shortly after my
sentence, and just before my final imprisonment. What became of my
brother John?"</p>

<p>"I believe he went to America about twelve years ago. He
couldn't make much of a living here, and he gave the place up in
disgust, and has settled I believe in San Francisco. He told me
just before his departure that he did not think the Melbourne
people deserved to have a decent person stopping in their midst:
they appeared to like being plundered, and therefore should have
what they liked. He wasn't going to waste his life for them as his
foolish brother had done."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just the way he used to rebuke me," responded
Harry, "he was always saying I should not meddle with the business
of other people, and that I would get into trouble over it. He
turned out right in his prophecy, unfortunately, though his stupid
idea of non-interference with wrong never improved him or anyone
else who held it."</p>

<p>"But surely, after your recent experiences, you agree with the
principle of not interfering with another's liberty, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. But can't you see that interfering with
another's liberty, and interfering with another's slavery, are two
very different things? The <i>laissez faire</i> doctrine is a very
good thing if rightly understood; it simply means that each
individual should be let alone to follow out his own natural
desires to satisfy his wants by his own efforts. And I like to see
a man exercising that right. But when he won't stop there, but
demands that he be let alone when oppressing or exploiting others,
it's time we interfered. That man's victim requires to be let alone
just as much as the other fellow, and it is to our mutual
self-interest to see that he is left alone. <i>Laissez faire</i>
isn't a one-sided virtue; but to become a living principle, it must
be universal in its application. When the authorities imprisoned me
they destroyed that principle, because I was not limiting the
liberty of others and wrongly lost my own. Had I limited others'
liberty, by legal or illegal means (it is immaterial which) I
should then have been a destroyer of that principle of
non-interference, and society to preserve itself would be justified
in removing me out of harm's way."</p>

<p>"But the capitalist and the legislator do not directly interfere
with the liberty of the proletaire, who are free to work for an
employer or not, as they choose."</p>

<p>"No, Fred, they are not free to do anything of the kind; they
are <i>compelled</i> by unjust conditions to do so&mdash;not by
their own free choice. The old Socialist cry of 'Freedom of
Contract,' which the plutocrats have tried to appropriate,
expresses the true idea of economic freedom. Your own success in
business is obscuring your sense of justice, as it does so many
others, and in endeavouring to vindicate your well-deserved efforts
at success under unjust conditions, you make the common mistake of
endeavoring to vindicate those conditions; instead of stopping
short after having vindicated your efforts to subsist, and then
honestly condemning the conditions through which you successfully
struggled.</p>

<p>Every landlord, every usurer (or banker, if you prefer the
word), and every other parasite on labor is justified in his
success under our present exploiting system; just as every
proletariat is equally justified with his poverty under that
system. But landlordism, usury, and all other forms of exploitation
and restriction, are unjustifiable. It is the system that is wrong,
not the men who suffer or succeed beneath that system. Society has
forbidden you to live in the full enjoyment of your own efforts and
has enacted in all its Statute Books a new commandment, 'THOU SHALT
ROB OR BE ROBBED,' and you have succeeded in leaving the robbed
classes and in joining the robbers. You have done your best, and
merit your success. Society has done its worst, and merits the
undying hatred of both you and me&mdash;the parasite and the
proletaire."</p>

<p>"I understand your vigorous, if not very polite, language,
Harry, and know how to appreciate it. You are quite right in
blaming the conditions, instead of the individuals who live under
those conditions. And with you, I would like to see better
conditions existing, but I have little hopes of them coming in my
day, and can only put them aside as out of the range of 'practical
politics.'"</p>

<p>"Well, Fred, I hope soon to take you out of this horrible
pessimistic mood of yours by showing you an object lesson in
justice. But about my old friends and, acquaintances. You haven't
told me about them yet."</p>

<p>"Your acquaintances! Of course, you know all about Felix Slymer,
your old time enemy?"</p>

<p>"No. Is he still living?"</p>

<p>"Living! I should think so. And likely to live, if he doesn't
die prematurely by gorging himself with too much luxury."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say he is wealthy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is the wealthiest man in the colony to-day; although,
when you and I first knew him together he was one of the poorest,
or at all events, believed to be such. After the Riots that
followed on the execution of your comrades the workers were in
desperate straits. They had no leaders, and no decided plan of
action. Slymer used to continue to address them on revolutionary
subjects and succeeded in retaining their favors, until he
succeeded in getting them to return him as their representative to
Parliament. He got in by an astounding majority, far exceeding that
ever polled by any previous candidate for the constituency which he
was contesting. Not only did the labor parties support him, but the
capitalists gave him their support also in the majority of
instances. This was inexplicable at the time, although rumor had it
that he was a secret agent of the latter and a spy in the labor
camp&mdash;a suspicion that was strengthened by his subsequent
career.</p>

<p>Having entered Parliament, he lost no opportunity to support all
the measures introduced in the interests of the wealthy classes.
This, of course, brought all sorts of opportunities to his feet,
and he became a little god amongst the capitalists and their
representatives. But the most astounding part of it was that he
continued to retain the good opinions of the labor parties in spite
of his persistent support of their foes. And this is how he did it.
Whenever he supported a capitalistic measure, he told his laboring
constituents (in an undertone, of course) that he was doing so only
as a matter of expediency; so that when he someday introduced his
own revolutionary measures he would have friends in the House who
would support him in them as he had supported them. Thus
hoodwinked, the workers let him and his party support the most vile
legislative enactments year after year; while of course the long
expected socialistic legislation never took place, and Slymer
always managed to get them put off by pressure of 'other business,'
and never failed to get his dupes to exonerate his actions.</p>

<p>After he had been in the Legislature a few years he succeeded,
by his excellent business tact and cunning, in forming several
large and influential trading Syndicates, mostly amongst the
members of the Legislature. This extended his popularity. The other
members of the House, having now an interest in common with his
own, supported him in any measure he brought forward, no matter how
daringly oppressive it might be. Even this did not cause him to
lose the confidence of the proletaire, for every time that a
depression occurred, as the inevitable results of his financial
undertaking, he would organize charitable societies to distribute
relief and handsomely contribute to their funds a few thousand
pounds out of the hundreds of thousands of pounds which he had
robbed from the workers by means of those undertakings.</p>

<p>Honors continued to shower upon him, and he got the title of Sir
Felix Slymer which he now holds. That mansion which you saw just
round the corner is his city office; but he has far more delightful
residences in different parts of the country, each of which is
connected with the city by a line of railway, constructed, in most
cases, specially for him. His wealth was greatly augmented by your
old friend (?) Gregory Grindall, who, on his demise about nine
years ago, bequeathed to him nearly all his possessions on account
of services performed."</p>

<p>"And is Slymer happy with all this luxury?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a funny question to ask, and one I really can't
answer. I know he has tremendous worry with it all, and is in
constant danger from the number of starving tramps who are always
threatening to take his life, and have made one or two attempts
already. But I think he's happier than he would have been in jail
as you have been."</p>

<p>"But not as happy as he might have been living in a state of
social justice and freedom."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"But, Fred, you have told me about the others, and yet I have
not heard you say anything about Hypatia Stephens. Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"Ah, poor fellow, I understand your anxiety. I think I can set
your mind at rest on that score."</p>

<p>"I hope she is all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so, and have every reason to think she is. As you
know, we have always been intimate friends, and although you did
unintentionally cross my path in our affections, I have never let
that interfere in the relations between us. Hypatia has often been
in my company and she generally spoke of you and longed for the day
when she should again behold you. Having no parents, or other
relations, and being boycotted by strangers owing to her confessed
sympathies with the workers, she was unable to get employment here,
and I assisted her in going to Sydney. I would have liked her to
stop with me and assist me in the business I was working up. But
she thought as I was a bachelor and she a spinster it would be
better for her to go elsewhere among strangers; not that she feared
the scandal of tittle-tattling society, as you know, but she
contended that 'human nature was human nature,' and that it would
require a too strong resolution on the part of both of us if she
were to remain true to the pledge she had given you.</p>

<p>I tried to dissuade her from going away at the time; but I think
it is as well that she did do so, for I confess that I still
cherish the old regard for her, and if our relations had become
more intimate it would certainly have caused unpleasant relations
between you and me, perhaps between her and yourself, and very
likely even between Hypatia and myself. Marriage is not a very
satisfactory institution. The evils it often occasions are easier
done than undone. Love has no difficulty in uniting us with our
eyes shut, but Reason can't always sever us when our eyes get
opened. Hypatia, as you know, holds very strict and somewhat
unpopular views on the marital relations, which she looks upon as
the necessary outcome of our present system of industrial slavery,
and totally incompatible with the dignity of a true woman who
should never enter into what she calls sexual slavery. So she had
her own way, as I have told you, and went to Sydney, where she got
a quiet situation as housekeeper. Here is her address. Shall I wire
her to return at once?"</p>

<p>"Do, Fred; and tell her to come immediately."</p>

<p>Fred wrote the following message:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Return immediately. Holdfast waiting here. I pay
all expenses. Call Bank of Australasia, Sydney, for money." Fred
sent a messenger to the telegraph office, and then went to the bank
and got them to telegraph twenty pounds to Sydney.</p>

<p>When Fred returned, he began to initiate Harry into the
mysteries of a hay and corn business, and the latter recounted his
past experiences while performing the light work set him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII.</h2>

<p>Thursday had arrived, and Harry was that evening to propound his
scheme of social salvation. But, although the day had far advanced
Hypatia had not arrived, nor had any word come from her. He had
hoped to see her before the meeting, but there would be no train in
till late at night, so he decided to lose no more time but prepared
for the meeting.</p>

<p>Fred had agreed to go with him that evening, although he had not
been in the habit of frequenting the socialists' meetings for
several years past; and after they had taken tea, the two went out
together to the rooms of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>On arriving at the hall, Harry found it yet wanted half an hour
to the time when they would commence the proceedings, so he filled
in the time looking around the place, and reading the numerous
labor newspapers from all parts of the world that were hung round
the walls. Taking down a copy of the London <i>Revolutionist</i>,
his eye caught the following;&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Our comrades in Manchester, finding the
co-operative schemes a failure, so far as the improvement of the
workers are concerned, are taking important measures to force on a
better state of affairs. They are now carrying on a vigorous
campaign against the payment of rent, and are calling on all the
workers to inaugurate a universal strike, when they will quietly
seize all the machinery and product in the factories and mines and
start to work it for themselves, offering to let the proprietors
join them in the undertaking provided they do their share of the
work and accept an equal share of the common product along with the
rest. There are already half the tenants of the houses in that town
positively refusing to pay their rents, which they have not the
means to pay even if they desired to do so; and they are readily
joining in the grand campaign. We wish our comrades every success.
If the other industrial centres imitate their example we will soon
accomplish the Social Revolution."</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" said Harry, showing the paragraph
to Fred.</p>

<p>"I think it disgraceful," replied Fred.</p>

<p>"I don't," said Harry, "I think it foolish."</p>

<p>It was now time to commence, and the chairman called the meeting
to order. He said he was glad to see the hall so packed; it showed
respect to a worthy veteran (applause), and also showed they
appreciated an earnest attempt to end the present social injustice
(renewed applause). He had to announce that, at the request of the
lecturer, a new departure would be made in the conduct of the
meeting: instead of the usual debate at the close, members of the
audience would be invited to interject pertinent questions
throughout the discourse, so as to clear up the subject and create
a thorough understanding of the lecturer's methods. Before
introducing the lecturer, he would ask the whole audience to join
in singing the "Anthem of Labor."</p>

<p class="poem">THE ANTHEM OF LABOR.<br>
<br>
In the good old days when the Roman power Held sway o'er the human
race, And the working millions like oxen toiled In sorrow and
disgrace, The wise men of that day did say Man should toil thus for
ever; But Slavery's day has since passed away To return amongst us
never.<br>
<br>
Chorus.&mdash;For Labor shall be free; yes, Labor shall be free; In
spite of Mammon's cruel theft&mdash; In spite of Law's
decree&mdash; We'll yet make Labor free&mdash;we'll yet make Labor
free, O'er all the world we'll brothers be, And Labor shall be
free!<br>
<br>
But, alas, from the ashes of slavery rose The lords in their Feudal
might, Reducing to serfdom the laboring throngs, And seizing the
land as their right. But the Feudal barons and their castles strong
Are relics of the past; And the worker's no longer sold with his
land&mdash; He strives to be free at last.<br>
<br>
Chorus&mdash;For Labor, etc.<br>
<br>
But alas for the day that saw Capital reign With Labor prostrate at
its feet; The indolent few overburdened with wealth, While labor
has nothing to eat. The worker is 'free'? yes, free to starve, Or
work at a tyrant's call! The gold of the idler has bought the whole
world: The worker has nothing at all.<br>
<br>
Chorus&mdash;For Labor, etc.<br>
<br>
Then hail to the day when the worker shall say: "The world 'neath
my feet is mine, "The wealth in your hands is the fruit of my toil;
"Restore it&mdash;it is not thine; "The coal and the metals I bring
from the mine, "The Engines I make with my brain, "The homes I have
built, and the clothing I weave "Are all part of Labor's
domain!"<br>
<br>
Chorus&mdash;For Labor, etc.<br>
<br>
And here's a health to all who toil In this and every land; Whoe'er
they be, where'er they roam, We stretch a friendly hand. We know no
race, nor creed, nor clan: We fear not Russ or Turk: The only one
whom Labor fears Are they who will not work.<br>
<br>
Chorus&mdash;For Labor, etc.</p>

<p>When the audience had finished singing, the chairman reminded
them of his previous announcements, and called on Harry Holdfast to
give his promised address on the all important question, "How You
and I Can Emancipate the Workers."</p>

<p>When the deafening applause, that followed on the chairman's
remarks had subsided, Harry proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I intend to-night, friends, to convey to you the thoughts that
I have evolved during fifteen years' confinement in your jail.
During the whole of that time I have never ceased to think of the
unhappy conditions of those outside it, and to work out some method
by which I could end those conditions if I ever became liberated.
At last I have matured my plans, and to-night I shall lay them
before you before I carry them out (applause). Understand, I am
going to ask you to help me, and I want every one of you here to
lend me a hand; but if you don't&mdash;if not one of you assist me,
I shall go on carrying it out all the same, and seeking the
assistance of more willing co-operators (applause). I will presume
that you have realized already that government will do nothing for
you, that philanthropy can't afford to do anything for you, and
that you need expect no wealth or power outside of your own selves
to emancipate you; but that you are resolved on working out your
own salvation (hear, hear).</p>

<p>I will also presume that you have seen through the fallacious
methods of your trades unions, which never alter the false
relations existing between employer and employee, but allow them to
continue&mdash;set the worker to fighting his master instead of
dispensing with his master; and which accomplish nothing but futile
strikes which always in the end succeed in striking the strikers
while the master waits his time and then puts on the screw tighter
when defeated labor comes begging for the right to toil. It is you,
deprived of all political or other privileged powers&mdash;you,
with nothing but a precarious starvation wage&mdash;who are to
create from yourselves both the power and the wealth necessary for
your emancipation. Now you know that every time you work under the
present system, you give your employer nearly the whole of your
product, simply because he is your employer. That great
philosopher, Adam Smith, tells you that the natural wages of labor
are the whole product of labor; but then you don't read his famous
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, so you haven't been trying to secure
those just wages that he shows you are yours, but have always
allowed the capitalists to rob you of nearly the whole of them.
Your fellow-workers in the United States of America realized from
their statistics a few years ago the awful fact that every time
they produce eight dollars, they only get one dollar returned them
as wages.</p>

<p>Now I want them to keep that other seven dollars, and to devote
it to building up their own capital and assisting to find wealth
and employment for their fellows. And I want you to show them how
to do it (applause). I am going to ask you to club together your
earnings to buy land and machinery and to employ each other. (A
voice: 'We never have any earnings.') Yes you do, or you would all
be dead long ago. If you got twenty shillings wages Iast week it
shows you earned six pounds in that time, although you don't
perhaps know where it went. At any rate you got the pound. And it
is very apparent you didn't do any good with it, because you never
get any better off with all your little earnings ('We get worse
off.') Just so and you will continue to do so while you waste your
money as you have been doing. Now, how many of you can raise ten
shillings to go towards freeing yourselves? You none seem to think
you can, and yet you squander that every week over your rent. How
many of you could afford to put a pound into the next Melbourne
Cup, six months before it is run, if you knew it would win you a
thousand pounds? ('Plenty of us.') Certainly you could. You have
but to realize the necessity of a thing, and you soon find a way of
doing it.</p>

<p>Now you all know that many attempts have been made, by
communists, co-operators and others, to find a better way of living
in society than we are now doing. You have heard of the experiments
of Icaria, Brook Farm, Harmony, Bethel, and hundreds of others that
have been made in different parts of the world; and you know they
have all failed. But why have they failed? Was it because those who
took part in them were unhappy under the new conditions? No; we
know very well that many of them deplored bitterly the failure of
many of those experiments, eagerly sought to take part in
subsequent ones very often, and testified to the fact that the
happiest days of their lives were those they spent in those
communities, notwithstanding the many difficulties they had to
contend against. Were they troubled with disputes over the use of
their land as we are, and did they find the common use of land
worse than our present system of buying, selling, and monopolizing
it? No; we know their system of using their land proved far
superior to our's, in most, if not in all, cases, and that it
taught us a lesson we cannot soon forget. Did they find themselves
inconvenienced for the want of money with which to transact the
mutual interchanges of commodity with each other? Certainly not;
for in many cases that interchange was entirely spontaneous and
unregulated, and in others it was successfully directed by a
labor-note system that gave results quite the reverse of the
pauperizing monetary system that we are suffering under.</p>

<p>Then what were the causes of their failure? Let us find them,
that we may not fail also, but may take advantage of their example
by imitating their successes but avoiding their stumbles. If we
study their history, we soon find that their successes were due to
the fact that they freed the lands, gave employment to the labor
upon it, worked with their own machinery instead of the machinery
of others, and rendered themselves dependent upon the product of
their own labor instead of upon the money belonging to the usurer.
And their failures we find were due to the fact that they
frequently made the products of the individual laborers the common
property of all, whether they assisted in the creation of those
products or not, and utterly regardless of the amount of exertion
each individual put forth in their creation; some failed because
the land they were throwing open to the free use of all their
members was not out of the monopolist's grip before they commenced
to use it, and they had to relinquished it to the cruel mortgagee,
with all the improvements they had placed upon it; others failed
because although they they had the land properly, but like many a
poor struggling farmer they lack sufficient means to 'hang out'
until the crops begin to ripen and the harvest comes to reward
their patient toil; or they have means too small to tide over
famines, droughts, fires, or other calamities; and others yet again
failed because they were overburdened with authority, hemmed in by
laws, and regulations, and restrictions imposed upon men who knew
little of the requirements of hard pioneering life by others who
knew still less of those requirements, and who unintentionally only
brought about the old order of things that existed in the old
exploitative society from which they had just fled.</p>

<p>Now, friends, I propose that you assist me to imitate their
successes, and avoid their failures, by the following means. Club
together a stated sum each, say ten shillings. If there are a
hundred of you that means fifty pounds; a thousand of you five
hundred pounds; and ten thousand of you five thousand pounds. Now
that five thousand pounds employed in securing you what I have
suggested would do more good than five hundred thousands of pounds
employed in charity or government relief works (hear, hear). After
that you can pay a small sum every week, say a shilling, until you
have paid up some five or ten pounds each. Now that isn't much to
pay to secure your emancipation, is it? You'd think nothing of
paying a hundred pounds through a building society for a house and
land, and a poor one at that. And yet that small ten pounds will
gain you not only a house and land free of all liabilities, but it
will find you capital to work it, and sufficient food and clothing
for you to carry on with until you become absolutely independent.
And here is how you go about it. You have clubbed together say the
five thousand pounds. With some of that you buy enough land
somewhere in the country, and decide amongst yourselves by ballot
who shall first go and live on it. You don't need to all go on it
once, as they did in the experiments I have told you of, because
you'd soon come back again as they did. You wouldn't have enough
means to live on. But suppose you sent a hundred of your
number.</p>

<p>Let them take plenty of tents, food, seed, live stock, and all
the other things they require with them. You can easily do this,
because you have plenty of means. Now there is already a hundred of
you on your own lands and out of the crowded city&mdash;a hundred
less proletaires to compete at the capitalist's feet for a
starvation wage. Well you continue to supply them with food, week
after week, while they are up there; it doesn't cost much to live
rent free in the country, and your united capital can easily do it
without diminishing much. While you are finding these comrades
food, they are doing their share towards sustaining you. They are
building little homes away up there, so that they can live in them
instead of the tents; and they are also building others for you;
they also dig and prepare the ground so that fruit and vegetables
may be planted in it to sustain you and them in the near future,
and they erect sheds for the cattle and poultry.</p>

<p>After a while, they begin to get 'the house' ready, as we would
say; and you ballot to select a few more pioneers to go and help
them. You might this time send their wives and sweethearts; because
you know no community will hold together long if there are no
sweethearts there (laughter), the men would soon return to the city
with all its sorrows, rather than suffer country bachelordom. Then
you gradually send more and more of your numbers up there,
according to your means, which are constantly being increased by
your own weekly contributions, and buy more and more land as you
require it. And now you will begin to see the advantage of securing
this surplus product that I was telling you about&mdash;the big
profit that the capitalist appropriates out of your labors. Some of
your crops begin to come up, your poultry begins to supply you with
eggs, your cows to give milk, and so on. And your friends in the
country send all these things, over and above what they require for
their own food, to you for you to sell in Melbourne. You
accordingly dispose of it, and the money realized goes to swell
your fund which had been somewhat decreased by the purchases of
land and the settlement of your members upon it.</p>

<p>As time goes on this surplus product gets more and more in
proportion; your few dozen head of poultry will have increased to
hundreds, and then to thousands; your few shillings' worth of seeds
will have grown to loads of grain and vegetables, and will also
have furnished you with thousands of times as many seeds as you
started with; your cattle will have multiplied from dozens to
hundreds; and your exports will be increasing every year. This
prolific increase of nature, which used to be the principle agency
by which you were impoverished because it did not belong to you,
becomes the means by which you all get wealthy now that it does
belong to you. You soon have realized so much by the sale of your
growing surplus product that you can easily buy more land than you
need; you can send your remaining members in larger batches to
colonize, and can buy them costlier and more efficient machinery.
And you can keep on doing this until one after another, member
after member has gone up to assist in the pioneering work, until at
last the whole of you have been absorbed in it, and not one of you
remains in Melbourne to struggle with each other for a bare crust
of bread."</p>

<p>"I would like to ask the lecturer what chance there is of a body
of men succeeding as he has so graphically described when we know
very well that individual farmers, with far greater means, are
always coming to grief. If these pioneers got fairly started, there
is no doubt they might succeed as he says. But the thing is for
them to start. Many a farmer might make a successful start; but
when the crops fail him, or a drought comes, or his goods do not
realise sufficient in the market to pay him, he is compelled to
mortgage his little farm to raise sufficient money to tide over his
difficulties with. But even then, he generally loses it. What would
these people in your scheme do under such circumstances?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," respond Harry, "there wouldn't be such
circumstances. It would be impossible. The individual farmer, who
has to struggle along unaided is in a very different position to
the co-operative pioneers I have been describing. If the farmer
comes to grief when his crop fails, it is because he is dependent
on those crops to pay his rent or the interest on his loans, or to
purchase the food he cannot produce; but these pioneers have no
rent to pay at all, no interest to meet, and no food to buy,
because those remaining behind are sending them a sufficient supply
from the city every week to keep them going. It doesn't matter to
them if not one of their crops came up for six months, or not one
cow gave milk, or not one hen laid a single egg; because their
supplies are guaranteed and forwarded to them regularly; and while
the farmer is starving because a drought has set in, and he cannot
afford to employ labor to irrigate his lands, or the markets are
not realizing a price sufficient to pay him properly, the pioneers
are irrigating their own lands, instead of racking their brains to
find out how to get others to do it, and the prices their
commodities are fetching in the market concerns them very little,
because they don't depend upon it for their living, and the
smallest fraction it brings them in is a fraction more towards the
accumulation of the mutual capital which is to free them from the
dependence on the capital belonging to the outside capitalist and
to ultimately employ every one of their members in the same
manner.</p>

<p>Now I have shown you briefly how the collected money of the
members will act in finding them employment, in providing them with
capital in the form of machinery, seed, live stock &amp;c., in
providing them with houses, and in drawing them out of the city of
exploitation and into a newer city or village of freedom. You see
they have no swindling building society to gobble them up, no rent
collector to worry them, no grinding lease to pay, because they
have paid for their lands in full already. But they have now to
guard against the evils of the present property system cropping up
again in their midst, and they do so by not permitting anyone to
monopolize land to another's detriment, nor to charge another for
the use of any lands they may be using or desirous of using, but
according to the constitution adopted by them all, and incorporated
in the registered deeds of their association, they are legally and
morally bound to recognize no other title but the <i>usufruct</i>.
That is to say, every individual has the right to certain land only
because he is using it; he is only entitled to the exact area that
he is using; and he has only a claim upon it while he is using it.
The instant he ceases to use any part of it, he ceases to have any
right to posses that part. That is the only just system of holding
and working land. It is the natural land law that existed before
the world was ever cursed with statute law; and it is the law which
will live and be recognised in society when all our statute laws
are forgotten."</p>

<p>"But won't some greedy fellows take more land than others, while
the rest will not have enough?" asked someone. "You can't expect to
have people taken out of the city, and possessing all the greedy
vices of city life&mdash;you can't expect to have these people
acting justly towards each other, and only taking a fair share of
the land. Now if everyone had a certain allotment given entirely to
him by the society, or leased to him by the society, or even
gratuitously allotted to him, it would prevent all the land
scrambling that would be bound to exist if all the place were a
sort of 'no-man's land.' If you didn't want to have the members
always going to the law courts to redress their grievances, and all
the old troubles would be repeated."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," replied Harry, "not so fast my friend. Do not
conjure up thoughts of legal warfare amongst the members, because
it would be one of the last things they would be likely to seek.
Nobody seeks anything thing unless he sees, or fancies he sees,
some advantage in it; and no sensible person appeals to the law
when he thinks he can settle a thing without it. Lord Bacon wisely
advised that 'everyone should know enough of the law to keep out of
it,' and most people soon learn from experience that Bacon's advice
is best. But still, under present conditions, it is sometimes wise
to have recourse to the law, because we are living in a world ruled
by robbers, and law is the only weapon which these robber rulers
will permit us to use to fight our battles. But with these pioneers
the case is entirely different. Their circumstances are just the
reverse to our's. The questioner and myself, for instance, are not
likely to quarrel over the use of the air in this hall which we
both require for the purpose of respiration. He doesn't say,
'Holdfast you're breathing too much air, there won't be enough for
me if you persist in breathing so hard and consuming some of my
share of oxygen' (laughter).</p>

<p>You laugh, friends, but the illustration I have made is no more
grotesque than the one of my questioner has put to me. Why don't
you object to my consuming so much of the air, which is equally
essential to all of you as is the land? ('Because there is plenty
for all.') Not at all; there is plenty of land for all, and
apparently more than enough for all the inhabitants that the world
is ever likely to contain (hear, hear). So you see there is some
other reason why you don't growl at the quantity of air I use. I'll
tell you what it is. It's because the air isn't monopolized as the
earth is. The capitalists haven't yet found out how to bottle it up
and charge us for the use of it; they don't know how to secure it,
or they'd have sold it to us at the rate of so much per cubic acre,
and leased it to us according to law, while those who had no money
would have to die for want of breath, just as they now do for want
of land. The unfortunate occupants of the Black Hole of Calcutta
would have given all their worldly possessions to have had good
pure air to breathe there, so that their lives could have been
spared; and it would be just so with us, were the air monopolized;
we would willingly pay the monopolists' own price for the use of
the air, just as we now pay his price for the use of the land. But
with our pioneers it is very different. The land with them is as
free as the air with us.</p>

<p>It costs nothing to use it, so no one has any incentive to
monopolize it from another who also requires to use it, because he
could get nothing from that other for the loan of it even if he
wanted to. It is only because the land has become monopolized and
transformed into a marketable commodity, that we try to secure more
of it than we need. When it ceases to have that market value, and
becomes valueless in a financial sense, we take good care not to
have more than we can just use ourselves. The Bethel community, who
owned their land in common, but used it individually, never had any
dispute about the area each one should occupy. Each member, or his
family, had their own little house, and there wasn't even a fence
round it. You couldn't tell where one man's ground ended, and
another man's commenced. If you did see a little enclosure here and
there, you found it was one to keep the fowls in so that they
wouldn't destroy the crops; or it was one to protect certain
vegetable growths from different animals who roamed about and might
destroy them; or for some similar reason. But there wasn't any
fence to say which was my land and which was your's. If ever we see
a fence round some land, we know it is a sort of public notice to
say 'This land's mine'; but you see the land of our pioneers, like
the land of the Bethel people, is nobody's, so they don't want any
fence round it to say whose it is. And they would not quarrel over
it, any more than they would need to fence it from each other.</p>

<p>The Bethel people were happy, contented and prosperous; and
although they had not the perfect social organization that might be
desired, their system of using the land gave every satisfaction
that could be desired, and showed to all who want to live a noble
life, where there are no such things as landed proprietors and
rack-rented tenants, that that life can only be attained when the
land is as free as the air, and no one has the right to own any of
it, but each one has the right to use just as much as he requires.
Now that is the grand lesson that Communism has taught
us&mdash;that the natural resources of nature should be absolutely
free to all. That is the lesson to be learned from its successes.
But we know that all experiments in communism have sooner or later
failed; and we have to learn the reason of its failure. Communism
did good when it secured the common use of natural wealth
<i>not</i> produced by the efforts of human labor; but it did harm
when it secured the common use of artificial wealth produced
<i>by</i> the efforts of human labor. That is the rock on which
communism has always foundered and which its unfortunate wrecked
crews have forsaken, preferring to struggle in the maelstrom of
capitalism. Many a good has been spoilt owing to this one serious
defect, many a brilliant enthusiast has been turned into a
disheartened pessimist through witnessing the failure that
inevitably follows such a rash denial of the right of the
worker&mdash;the right to the product of his own work.</p>

<p>If Labor is to rejoice in its labor, it must reap the full
rewards of its labor. It must have the whole of what it
produces&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. It must not share with
the with the capitalist, as in capitalism; it must not share with
the community, as in communism. Because in every community there
are apt to be some idlers; and the only way to create idlers is by
making it possible for an idler to live&mdash;a thing he can only
do at the expense of the worker. Thus it is that in the communist
experiments, the hard-worker has had to see the non-worker enjoying
the fruits of others' toil because he did not toil himself; and so
it has invariably come to pass that the most vigorous, the most
intelligent, and the most industrious members have one after
another forsaken these communities, and only the few enthusiasts
along with the laziest and most unprincipled have been left in
possession, until they eventually came to grief. Now it is very
easy to secure this private possession of product, simultaneously
with the free access to nature that necessarily precedes it. And
the doing of this is what is rightly called 'co-operation.' Of
course, we know that what is often called co-operation is only so
in name, but is in reality stock-jobbing, dividend hunting, or
respectable usury. True co-operation precludes dividends, profits,
or interest. True co-operation is that form of laboring where each
works with the other for mutual benefit, but not for mutual
plunder; where each gets the full equivalent of what he produces;
and where each sells his surplus product for its real
worth&mdash;that to say, that he sells it for just what it costs
him in labor, receiving in exchange the equivalent in what it cost
another in labor for his commodity.</p>

<p>That is the true individualism&mdash;it is that individualism
which exalts the individuality of the laborer to the highest
possible point, by making him a truly independent man, one living
entirely by his own labors and not living in any degree on the
labors of others; it is that individualism which makes him a real
sovereign over his own individuality, and a worthy being to
associate with others, equally elevated to the same social,
economical, and moral level. It is not the 'individualism' that the
capitalist talks and boasts about&mdash;the individualism of the
few only that rejoices in and lives upon the suppression of the
individualism of the many; that isn't individualism at
all&mdash;it's only domination. The present system isn't
individualistic; it's exploitative. We live on each other instead
of each one living on himself; and it's only those who succeed in
living on plenty of others who ever get wealthy; no man ever got
enormously wealthy out of his own efforts, but only by enslaving
others and living upon them. But these pioneers couldn't possibly
do this. Each one can only get what he makes by his own exertions,
so he can't become a millionaire or a pauper; but he would earn
about twelve pounds a week, when his city brethren would be earning
only two pounds for doing the same thing and the 'sweating'
capitalist who employs them would be getting two or three hundred
pounds a week out of his fifty or a hundred hands. And there's
another thing these pioneers can do when they get fairly
started&mdash;they can commence making their own money. I don't
mean lending gold out to others and robbing the borrowers of more
than they borrowed; that's called making money, but it isn't
anything of the kind: it's only a polite way of legally thieving
money.</p>

<p>I mean they can commence making labor money, not plutocrats'
money&mdash;money that represents product created by labor, not
money that represents the mines that the usurpers have stolen from
the laborers by their wicked schemes of law and disorder. I mean
the money that Robert Owen used to issue, that Josia Warren used to
issue, and that Proudhon and all the other great champions of the
working classes have tried to introduce as the laborers substitute
for the plutocrats' gold. These pioneers can easily make a paper
money to give to any member who raises a certain product and
deposits it with them for sale. It's a sort of I.O.U., that the
receiver gives to the producer to record his indebtedness to the
producer. This Labor I.O.U., or Labor-note as it is called, can
pass from one to another just as the plutocrat's money does to-day;
and, so far as the pioneers are concerned, it can take its place.
It's just the thing that Labor wants; it helps us to exchange our
product with each other, by giving equal value for equal value; it
dosn't cost anything to make, beyond the trifling cost of paper,
ink, and labor, of which it takes but very little to produce; it
can't rob us as gold does, because it doesn't bear interest.</p>

<p>'Bearing' interest, you know, is the polite name for filching
interest; because money hasn't the power to reproduce its species,
as animals and plants do, but it only gains for some that which
others have lost. Now I think I have shown you the nature of the
undertaking that I had resolved upon when I got released from your
jail; and I think I have said enough to show you that it is the
readiest, if not the only way, to secure justice, not alone for
ourselves, but for all our fellow-men, women and children. Before
concluding, I shall give you a number of facts and figures to show
how I have worked it all out; and to let you see that the scheme is
not at all utopian; but that, with your present means, it will
enable you to amass, step by step, all the wealth and advantages
that I have described to you, and a great deal more than I could
tell you in a single lecture."</p>

<p>Harry then went on to lay his facts and figures before them,
showing them every possible and likely transaction that the
pioneers could engage in, and showing them, week by week, and month
by month, how their little share capital would be spent and what
returns it would give. He vouched for the accuracy of the figures,
which everyone could test for themselves. He had consulted the
various technical and industrial works in the Melbourne Public
Library, besides gleaming valuable information from the current
newspapers and many practical men both in business and private
capacities; and therefore he could speak with authority on the
matter.</p>

<p>When Harry had ceased speaking, he was greeted with round upon
round of applause, nearly everyone present taking part in it,
although the audience was a very mixed one, and there were many
present, tempted thither by curiosity, who felt anything but
comfortable at the cutting thrusts they received every now and then
from Harry's remarks, especially when he trod too severely on their
corns of conscience and charged them with being thieves. But
somehow they seemed to recognize that his censures, though severe,
were well deserved; that his objections were against a system and
not against the individuals who were born into that system and had
hitherto been unable to change it; and they could not help admiring
his candor, his consistency, and his evident earnestness to better
the condition of every man, no matter what his present position in
society might be.</p>

<p>Then the chairman got up. He said he felt that the Brotherhood
had not been disappointed when they expected something really good
from the lecturer; but for himself, he found it so new a departure,
so wide in its possibilities, and so daringly radical, that he
scarcely felt himself competent to give it the minute criticism
that it undoubtedly deserved; and he thought most of the others
would be likely to receive it in the same way (hear, hear). It was
now too late to ask any criticisms upon the subject from anyone
present; but if they desired it, controversy could be carried on at
the next meeting. He would now, as promised, invite any present to
assist Holdfast in his laudable endeavor, and should formally
declare the meeting closed, any who desired to co-operate being
invited to remain behind.</p>

<p>Harry thanked the chairman and the rest of the society for their
kindness, and immediately stepped into the body of the hall where
most of the audience continued to loiter, and he was soon in the
midst of an earnest group of men, some congratulating him, others
arguing with him, and a few execrating him and telling him it was a
pity the authorities ever released him.</p>

<p>"I do not blame you," said Harry, smilingly, to the latter; "you
abuse me now because you are the creatures of the existing
conditions of society which will not let you do otherwise. Soon I
will create new conditions when you will regret what you are now
saying and will do all you can to help me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV.</h2>

<p>"Well, Harry, how are you getting on with your social salvation
scheme?" asked Wilberforce one day as the two were weighing out
some corn for an order that had just come in.</p>

<p>"Very well! all things considered," replied Harry, "I don't
expect to accomplish things all at once. I only got two members, as
you know, out of that enthusiastic meeting of the Brotherhood that
I addressed four weeks ago, but have now got ten members besides
yourself, and I am quite satisfied the others will follow."</p>

<p>"Yes, Harry, but if they come at that rate it'll take another
eight hundred years before you get the ten thousand members you
anticipate. I think you'll be rather too old by that time; and as
for me and the other members, we'll all be dead. I'm afraid you are
too sanguine."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Fred, I look at the past, and see how ideas
developed, and learn how they will develop in the future. When that
great social reformer Charles Fourier, brought out his new theories
of social reconstruction, his books were thought little of and
scarcely ever read, and he waited five years before he got a single
convert! And even that convert was one he wasn't at all proud of.
And yet, forty years after, hundreds of the leading minds of
America were enthusiastic converts to his ideas, thousands of
dollars were gladly clubbed together to give those ideas a
practical test, and experiment after experiment was conducted to
carry out Fourier's ideas as best they could; and now Fourier's
writings have influenced all sociological thought, and their author
has become one of the great classic writers of Socialism. Surely if
Fourier had reason for hope when he had only one convert in five
years, I have every good reason to be sanguine when I have ten
times that many converts in one month!"</p>

<p>"You certainly deserve to succeed, Harry."</p>

<p>"And I mean to, if it is only in my dying breath."</p>

<p>"That's the same old Harry."</p>

<p>Both speakers looked up to see who had interjected the last
remark.</p>

<p>"Hypatia!" exclaimed Harry after a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"I wonder you recognise me, Harry. Don't you think I have
changed&mdash;for the better of course?"</p>

<p>"You have changed, certainly; and at first I could scarcely
believe it was you. You look so very ill. Whatever is the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh nothing serious. Pardon me, Mr. Wilberforce, for my
discourtesy in not noticing you before. I am so much interested in
my fellow sufferer here that I almost forgot anyone else was
present. I know with your large heartedness you will make full
allowances for circumstances; but really I feel I am doing a gross
injustice in even temporarily forgetting the presence of one who,
in spite of my past coldness, has magnanimously acted as my
greatest benefactor in the hour of need."</p>

<p>"It's all right, Hypatia, no self-respecting person omits to
assist a suffering friend when he can do so without injury to
himself. It is the least I can do. But who is that young woman I
see waiting outside? Isn't she waiting for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my fellow traveller, Rose Wilson, who was working
at the same place as I was in Sydney. She is waiting till I go out,
when I have promised to go with her to a friend's place where she
intends stopping."</p>

<p>"Why not invite her in? There is no need for her to wait out
there."</p>

<p>Hypatia instantly did as requested; and after the usual
introductions the whole party adjourned into the adjoining drawing
room.</p>

<p>"Well," said Fred, when they were seated, "I think Miss Stephens
ought to tell us where she has been all this time, as there has
been more than one anxious to hear after her welfare, and now that
she's here we want our curiosity satisfied."</p>

<p>"I have not much to tell you, Mr. Wilberforce, unless I wish to
weary you with the dry details of a housekeeper's life. If you have
no objection, I would like to speak privately with Mr. Holdfast for
a few minutes in the next room. Perhaps Miss Wilson will give you
the information you seek and Harry can learn it some other
time."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Fred, "don't let me, or empty ceremony, stand
in the way of your conversation. If Miss Wilson can enlighten me I
shall be as pleased to hear it from her as anyone else."</p>

<p>The young lady cheerfully proceeded to impart to Fred the
desired information; and the re-united lovers withdrew.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV.</h2>

<p>It was a very cold wet day in June when Harry Holdfast sat in a
little office in Melbourne, busily writing and arranging an affair
of unusual importance. He was sitting at a simple deal table, with
a host of letters piled up in front of him and a few files of
papers hanging up here and there on the walls. Opposite him sat
Hypatia. And at a table a little further down the room were two
elderly gentlemen and a lady in busy conversation.</p>

<p>"There now, I think that is all," said Harry, looking up at
last, "it is now six o'clock, and the men start at seven o'clock
sharp. Have you nearly finished?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hypatia, "I have just completed the amounts.
After deducting all the preliminary expenses, and reserving
sufficient to pay all the office rent, advertising expenses, and
wages for the ensuing three months, I find the balance left from
the collective payments on application and allotment leave a clear
balance of over two thousand pounds. The total cost of the three
hundred and twenty acres of land, and the total expense incurred in
sending the hundred men with a full supply of food utensils,
implements, and their transit, all of which have been paid, leaves
a balance of £1040 in hand."</p>

<p>"That is correct. I make it come the same. And now I think we
had better close up the office and go down to the station. Are you
ready, Mr. Martin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're all waiting."</p>

<p>The whole party quickly took their departure for Spencer Street,
and Harry locked the door behind him.</p>

<p>When they reached Spencer Street Station, they found all the
members of the Social Pioneers who had been balloted for waiting to
take their departure. The day was not one to cheer the hearts of
any enthusiasts bent on seeking a happier life; for the elements
seemed to be striving to make them as uncomfortable as possible. It
was now raining hard, and the cold wind that was blowing made one
feel miserable and loth almost to quit the wicked city with all its
sins, but with its habitations so firmly secured against the gale.
However, once in the train, our pioneers seemed to partially forget
the wars of man or the elements, for most of them were busily
occupied in speculating on their prospects, and wondering whether
the Lake Boga settlement was likely to be the success they all
hoped.</p>

<p>Besides the private possessions that the pioneers were taking
with them, in the shape of clocks, clothing and many other little
domestic comforts, the directors of the Social Pioneers had sent up
fifty new tents, material to build houses, thousands of pounds of
provisions which would keep them well fed for a month, three good
colonial ovens, plenty of kitchen and other utensils, a good supply
of axes, spades and other implements, a careful assortment of
garden seed that could he planted as soon as the ground was
prepared, ten healthy-looking cows, and a few dogs. Such a
collection was itself enough to make the plucky band feel some
confidence in the undertaking, and the cheerful faces of the many
earnest women and men who had come to see them off was just the
best thing to increase that confidence.</p>

<p>It was night by the time the party reached their destination;
and if their departure was cheerless, their arrival was still more
so. But men used to 'roughing it', do not get appalled at trifles;
and they thought little of the inconvenience of stopping at the
station for the night, where they managed to keep off the cold by
the assistance of the tents they had with them, for although the
weather was bitterly sharp there had been no rain there, and they
did not find it so very uncomfortable as they might have done. At
daybreak, Mr. Martin conducted them to one of the adjacent farms,
where they found drays waiting in readiness for them to take their
luggage to their own farm.</p>

<p>The men were not long in reaching their destination; and as the
morning was a fine one they had a good opportunity to look around
them and inspect their future home. The place they had chosen was
very nicely situated only a short distance from the shore of the
lake, and the position was one admirably adapted for the object
they had in view. Certainly the place was not seen in its prettiest
aspects; the recent oppressive summer had made the place wear a
very desolate look, and there were not many evidences of vegetable
life about. There were a few farms here and there, looking a little
brighter than the great waste around them; but even they did not
seem to receive the careful attention they might have had bestowed
upon them, for they were not particularly well cultivated, but had
evidently suffered their share of the parching dryness of an
Australian summer, and looked even then as if they could
advantageously do with a goodly supply of the clear water that lay
at such a little distance from them. There was not even a decent
forest to relieve the dead monotony of the scene, but only here and
there a little timber struggling to survive the destructive attacks
of man and nature's hot blasts.</p>

<p>Now and then an aboriginal or two could be observed, the last
remnants of a dying race, fast hastening to obliteration together
with the crumbling civilization that had strangled it and was now
strangling itself. Hares and rabbits were there in abundance, as
many a farmer knew to his sorrow; and the wood ducks were so
plentiful that the settlers found them a constant source of
destruction to their crops. Wild fowl were there in immense numbers
forming easy sport for the settlers' rifles; and the black ducks,
teals and wild geese sported themselves over the quiet scene in
crowds quite astounding to city eyes. And every now and then the
settlers would catch sight of some of the bronze-winged pigeons
which are so plentiful in the district. But it was the soil itself,
the sandy chocolate soil beneath their feet, that appealed
strongest to the new visitors. It was the first little spot of land
that they&mdash;the rescued, expropriated proletaire&mdash;had ever
been able to own. No, not to own; but to use.</p>

<p>Ah, how that thought did delight them! How these novices did
talk over the merits of this wondrous soil, as though they had been
agricultural experts since their mothers weaned them. How fondly
their eyes looked at the good kind earth that was to bring forth
fruit for the starving wives and babies they had left behind them;
and all without paying perpetual tribute to another. Then they
would lift their eyes and turn them over towards the adjacent
farms, and think of the woes and troubles of the poor farmer yonder
who had nothing before him but the black prospect of striving
against adversity to pay his hard-earned rents for ever and ever,
until kind death came to relieve him of the cruel burden!</p>

<p>After enjoying a hearty meal from the simple but plentiful
stores of food that the directors had despatched along with them,
the pioneers set to work in real earnest to rig up the tents. Mr.
Martin was an old hand at this sort of thing, having in his young
days been mixed in every socialistic experiment that he ever could
possibly wriggle into; and he gave the little band some valuable
suggestions concerning the best sites to pitch their tents, and
other details of information that were very useful to them. They
were not long in unanimously and spontaneously recognizing him as
their leader; for men who work together will all find a leader, and
those they select of their own accord and mutual experience always
give more satisfaction and better results than the inexperienced
busybodies that external authority imposes upon men when it usurps
the right to meddle over them. The society had wisely arranged to
leave the men to co-operate as suited them best, giving them only
clear particulars of the performances it expected from them in
equitable return for the assistance it gave them.</p>

<p>After their canvas habitations were completed they busied
themselves storing away the different commodities they had brought
with them. All the food stuffs were carefully placed together, so
as to be easily guarded against the attacks of the various
quadrupeds and insects who would only have too readily appropriated
it had the opportunity occurred. Then each tent had a share
allotted of the little tin plates, pannikins, knives and forks,
cooking utensils, and other useful articles that had been sent up;
the colonial ovens were fitted up ready for the mid-day meal; and
all the tools and garden implements were carefully deposited in a
secure and dry place, except those they wanted for immediate use.
One of the party was deputed to watch after the cows which were
permitted to graze where they chose.</p>

<p>By the time night set in the little band were fairly tired out
with the excitement and toil of the day; and although some of them
lit their candles and tried to amuse themselves with reading and
conversation, the majority soon sought their slumbers.</p>

<p>Old Martin did not retire early with the others. He had too long
been accustomed to the foolish habit of tobacco smoking to wish to
break it off at his age, and so he stole into one of the tents
where two or three others were enjoying themselves conversing on
the only topic, of course, that was occupying all minds&mdash;that
of the new village settlement scheme upon which they had all
embarked.</p>

<p>"Well, Thompson," said he, addressing one of the men, "how do
you like your first day's experience?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll be time to talk about that when we have been here a
little longer. We haven't really started yet."</p>

<p>"Very true; it is rather soon to ask you. But I suppose you
already begin to feel as if you are breathing a very different air
and enjoying far pleasanter associations than you can find in the
hum and worry of city life?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think anything is preferable to city life, even city
death is better that it. But talking about the city, do you know
how our comrades we have just left behind have been getting on
lately?"</p>

<p>"We were just talking about Holdfast raising the necessary
funds. Is it true that Sir Felix Slymer has expressed an interest
in the undertaking, and thus caused the public to support it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is well known that Slymer did speak approvingly before
the Bankers' Institute; and although his statements were not
reported in the papers it got out somehow, and that seems to have
given it a bit of a lift. For a long while Holdfast got very little
encouragement, but when he had got several hundreds to join it, it
got to be looked upon with more favour by the public; and although
the papers tried to boycott it as much as possible, just as they
are doing now, he wasn't long getting the whole of the five
thousand shares taken up. Several other influential persons besides
Slymer, are believed to be interested in the matter, although they
are all keeping very quiet."</p>

<p>"Waiting to see which way the cat jumps, I suppose," remarked
one.</p>

<p>"No," replied Martin, "I don't think it is exactly that in all
cases. Holdfast thinks that Slymer is quietly encouraging it to
keep the discontented a bit quiet and to make it appear to the
working classes that he sympathizes with their efforts; and I think
he is not far out. I believe many others give it an occasional word
of half-hearted praise for a similar reason. Of course, there are
certain to be many standing out from a thing until they see it has
become a success."</p>

<p>"Has Holdfast had any definite communication from Slymer?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me too much. You will hear something to surprise you
shortly; but it would be a breach of confidence for me to tell you
everything. I suppose you know that Holdfast wrote to a number of
influential functionaries when he first tried to float his scheme,
but got little encouragement from them. One noble Supreme Court
judge, to whom he wrote, replied respectfully that he could not
have anything to do with it, because he couldn't see how it could
be successful as it didn't award dividends to the shareholders, and
if a man wanted to get any good out of it he would have to work in
it; another brilliant genius, with an 'M.A.' after his name, said
it couldn't succeed unless the whole capital were subscribed by one
or more wealthy philanthropists and bestowed on the society in the
form of a charity; then another gentleman, a clergyman, was so busy
thinking of going to England that he hadn't time to consider it,
but would simply say he approved of it if it was a good thing;
several others wrote in somewhat similar strains. But there was one
reply, however, that Harry treasured above all the others, and it
came from a clergyman who was well known as a hard worker in many
philanthropic schemes. As you might like to hear it, I will read it
to you from the copy I have with me:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">"Mr. Harry Holdfast,<br>
<br>
"Dear Sir,&mdash;I have received your interesting prospectus, and
beg to thank you for it, and for the honor which you do me in
asking me to become a promoter. I feel, however, that I cannot
accede to your request. The calls on my time and strength are about
as many as I can answer, and an important scheme such as that which
you are launching, should have, at its initiation, men who have the
time and the ability to go into it thoroughly and watch over it day
and night.<br>
<br>
"Wishing you every success in your effort to pioneer us out of
chaos,<br>
<br>
"Yours faithfully,<br>
"Charles Oakes."</p>

<p>"That was the only favorable reply that Harry received, out of a
community that pretended it wanted to assist in getting out of the
existing injustices. But fortunately he wasn't disheartened, with
the good result that we are here to-night as witnesses of the first
success of his determined endeavors."</p>

<p>"I hope we will help him to achieve that success. We might as
well die at once as go back to Melbourne."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk about going back already," said another, "we are
hardly here yet."</p>

<p>The party were now pretty well enveloped in the clouds of
tobacco smoke, and commenced to wander into dream-land, having
little to say after this. It is one of the peculiar privileges of
this habit to dull a man's mental activity. Your smoker will often
sit for hours in a state of silence that would drive a non-smoker
almost mad with impatient mental agony. It was not until their
pipes had exhausted their supply of tobacco that Martin and the
others lay down to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI.</h2>

<p>Early the next morning, some of the Pioneers went down to the
lake for a bathe, while others took down the lines they had brought
with them and tried to catch some fish for their breakfast. In this
they were not unsuccessful. The Lake Boga is an overflow from the
Murray, and the party had their labors well rewarded by capturing
some splendid Murray cod, besides a few bream and cat-fish and
several other fresh water fishes. These they took home with them
and shared them amongst the other members who desired them. After
breakfast the whole party turned to their day's labors. They had
managed to erect all the tents the day before, but they had yet to
erect the houses for their permanent dwellings as the lady folks
would be coming up in four weeks, and there was no time to lose;
besides that, the wintry weather was just upon them, and if they
did not hasten on with their work the rains might seriously hinder
their operations.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that the society had made a good selection
in the first 100 Pioneers they had sent up, they being well adapted
for their particular work. Although they had been selected by
ballot from all members of the society who had chosen to submit
their names for the purpose, the sound advice of the directors for
only practical men to apply at this stage was so well respected
that the names submitted were those of men in nearly every case
thoroughly fitted for the task. They were not long setting about
building the houses after completing all the necessary
preparations. These cottages were constructed of Egyptian bricks,
made of sun-dried clay; the roofs were of corrugated iron which
they had brought with them in the train along with the windows, the
doors, and the floorings. These habitations were excellent ones for
the settlers to live in and cost scarcely anything for
construction. If properly constructed they could stand for twenty
years and then be as good as ever. And yet their whole cost in hard
cash was no more than it would cost to rent a small cottage in the
city for only six months; for the material of each only cost them
fifteen pounds; and as they had nearly all their time to devote to
the purpose they could give all the necessary labor to their
construction without making any sacrifice.</p>

<p>The other members of the party devoted their time to sundry
other occupations, such as apportioning parts of the ground for
different industries, digging the ground and preparing it for the
garden seed they had with them, preparing the victuals, doing a
little fencing here and there, collecting fuel, and many other
little jobs that came to their hand.</p>

<p>Day after day the men proceeded with their work with a will that
did them credit, and they soon had the pleasure of seeing the
results of their toil in the altered appearance of the place. The
ground already began to look more cheerful than when they had first
seen it; and the cottages were fast approaching completion. It was
well they had hastened on with their building, for they had not
been at it more than a week before the weather began to get showery
and frequently hindered their work, and towards the close of the
month it became very stormy, and it was with great difficulty that
the work was carried on. However by the beginning of July they had
finished forty of these humble structures, and were ready to
receive their families into their new made homes.</p>

<p>Exactly a month after their arrival at the Lake Boga railway
station the settlers were back again at the same spot, not waiting
this time to penetrate a strange land but to welcome visitors to
that now familiar land. They were at the station long before the
needful hour&mdash;anxious people generally manage to get too early
in their efforts to appease their anxiety&mdash;and they had a full
two hours to wait. The two hours seemed like ten hours; and when
the train at last sped into the station one would almost think it
was the first sight of civilization they had had for years, so
eager were they to greet its occupants.</p>

<p>The the train stopped, and there was the usual meeting that need
not be described. It is hardly necessary to say that there was no
bowing and scraping, stiff introductions, and affected smiles that
makes one feel as if he is in an ice-bath. The manners of the
'upper crust' have fortunately not been adopted by the more solid
human pie beneath; and working men and women are more human and
emotional than the starched and painted consumptive marionettes
that society sticks up in high places for common people to laugh
at.</p>

<p>When the women had all got fairly out of the station, they lost
no time in assisting to pack their different treasures into the six
drays which had been sent up with them, while the men harnessed the
horses, and put all the crockery and utensils that they could into
the drays. There were about thirty children, all of whom they
managed to carefully stow away on the drays along with a few of the
women, most of whom preferred, however, to walk along in
conversation with their male relatives and friends, as the distance
they had to traverse was not very great. Forty more cows had been
sent up with them, and they helped form part of the procession.</p>

<p>On arriving at the houses, all the men who could be spared
instantly set to work to put the different things into them. They
had managed to bring a few bedsteads and bedding with them from the
station, and these were soon made ready, and the children, who were
worn out with fatigue after so long travelling, were very soon
soundly sleeping in them. As soon as the drays were emptied, they
returned to the station to bring up the remainder of the beds,
which were soon got in readiness for the women who were all
sleeping soundly in them before the night was much advanced, every
separate family occupying one house, while the single women slept
together in groups of six to each house, and the unmarried men
occupied the remaining houses and the tents.</p>

<p>Next day the men went down to the station and brought up the
household furniture, the forty colonial ovens, a single-furrow
plough, two harrows, two scarifiers, a steam plough, and the
balance of the live stock consisting of five hundred fowls, and
forty hives of bees. The steam plough had been purchased by the
society at a cost of £700 to save labor on the part of the
pioneers, a deposit having been paid on it, with the understanding
that it became their's if the balance with current interest were
paid within two years.</p>

<p>There were now two hundred men and women, besides the children,
on the land, and already the place commenced to wear a busy aspect.
They were not long setting to work. The men started sowing sixty
acres with wheat; another sixty acres they planted with vines,
peaches, apricots, figs, and other fruits, besides planting various
kinds of vegetables in between the fruit trees so as to utilize the
ground while waiting for the fruit to arrive at maturity; they also
planted twenty acres with tomatoes. The women attended to the
household duties, besides cultivating flower gardens around the
cottages, attending the poultry and the cattle and looking after
the bees, the men giving them occasional assistance. Although the
weather continued to be very boisterous and heavy rains were
falling most of the time, they managed to get on very well with
their work. Next month the directors sent them up a first-class
incubator, capable of hatching 200 eggs, and twenty-five superior
bee-hives; besides another month's provisions, which were regularly
forwarded to them so that they should not need to depend on the
product of their own land for some considerable time to come.</p>

<p>They, in their turn, managed to send a number of eggs to
Melbourne, where the directors disposed of them through their own
office, getting a fair price for them and yet selling them
considerably under current rates, as there were no middlemen to
come between them and the public, and thus increase the prices to
the consumers. A number of the remaining eggs, beyond what they
required for their own consumption, they reserved for setting or
incubation. By the beginning of October the society had a good sum
of money still in hand. The directors then sent up an excellent
cream separator and a large churn capable of being worked by steam;
they also sent up a number of pigs and material to build twenty
more houses similar to the ones they had already constructed. The
settlers were now enabled to send their butter to market as well as
their usual supply of eggs and the sixty acres of vegetable crop.
The society then bought another 320 acres of land, adjoining the
previous allotment, it having been arranged with the vendors on
purchasing the first allotment that any time within the next five
years they could purchase any part of the adjoining 10,000 acres at
the price already paid for the first lot, namely £3 per acre.</p>

<p>The men immediately set about shifting their tents into the new
tract of land, and erecting the twenty houses upon it for the
accommodation of the next batch of settlers. As soon as they were
ready, the directors sent up a hundred men and women, fully
provided as the others had been; and they also sent up a harvester
with them, as the grain was now ripe for preparing for market. The
weather was now delightful, and the Pioneers worked with a will,
some gathering in the harvest, others cutting channels for the
irrigation of their lands, a large area of which they intended to
devote to intense culture, and others attending to the area they
had reserved for grazing. Then the much detested rate collector
called round, demanding the shire rates and water rates, but that
didn't trouble them much. City slaves can't pay their rates without
great difficulty; but to free workers on a fruitful soil it becomes
a matter of little concern. The society paid the rates, which
amounted to some nine or ten pounds, out of the capital, and
debited it to all of the members, but as that averaged less than a
half-penny each for the six months nobody minded it.</p>

<p>With the New Year, the directors bought another 320 acres of
land and sent a hundred more persons, for whom cottages had already
been constructed, and who took up the usual supply of provisions,
&amp;c. By March the channels had been completed, and the directors
sent up a pumping plant for the irrigation works at a cost of £500.
They also constructed a large reservoir in one of the main
irrigation channels; this was used as a public bath as the waters
of the lake were used for drinking purposes and could not be
polluted. In the meantime the productivity from the various seeds
and live stocks had enormously increased. The young chickens that
had first come to bless the attentive care of the settlers were now
full grown fowls, and were sent to market in large numbers,
realizing a handsome sum; and the Pioneers could reserve as many as
ever they wanted for their own use without the directors requiring
to purchase any more for future batches of settlers. In the same
way the bees and other live stock, the grain, and even the flowers,
vied with each other in accumulating their numbers for the
settlers' benefit, as though they were intent on disproving the old
capitalistic Malthusian fiction that man's offspring tended to
increase faster than man's food; and they proved, to the
satisfaction of the pioneers, that man's food tended to outstrip
man in reproducing its species, and not only tended to do so, but
actually did so.</p>

<p>On the first day of June, exactly twelve months since the first
100 men had set foot on Lake Boga, there was great glee at the
settlement. They had just completed their public hall, which had
cost them £500 for building material alone. It was a large roomy
structure, built partly of wood and partly of the sun-dried bricks
like those employed in constructing the cottages. The main entrance
was into a wide-passage, on the walls of which were hung a number
of choice oleographs and some pictures the settlers had brought
with them in the shape of water and oil color paintings. This
passage was known as the picture gallery. The first door on the
right led into a large room fitted up with shelves all round the
walls and on the two uprights in the centre of the room. There were
a few large tables here and there and a number of chairs. On the
shelves were a variety of cheap books on all subjects, mostly
however those of an industrial or economic nature; these, too, were
partly lent by the settlers, but the majority were supplied by the
society.</p>

<p>Immediately behind the public library, as this room was called,
there was a room set apart for a printing office, where it was
intended to erect an extensive printing plant and to issue a
newspaper for the benefit of the settlers, as well as to educate
the outside public in the methods and progress of the society. On
the opposite side of the passage, the first door led into a
convenient office, which was known as the mutual bank. It was here
that the members were to receive their labor notes in exchange for
their commodities, when the members became independent of the
society's assistance and were able to produce entirely for
themselves; and it was here that all the financial affairs of the
society were regulated and the money stored, because several of
them had a little money with them which was now of no use, but they
wished to save it as it might be of service to them at some future
time in their dealings with the unfortunate outside world. Behind
the bank was a very large room, which was specially fitted up for
use as a general store, and was known as the co-operative store; it
was here that members could deposit their product for the society
to forward to Melbourne or elsewhere for disposal.</p>

<p>At the very extreme end of the passage was a large double door,
which led into the lecture hall. This lecture hall was the largest
room in the whole building, extending the whole length from side to
side and being fairly wide in proportion; there were doors at each
end and side to afford facility for egress in case of fire; and it
was well fitted up with forms, and a stage at one end where
theatricals could if necessary be carried on. This room was
intended chiefly as a meeting place where the members of the
community could meet together to discuss and arrange their affairs;
on Sundays it was set apart for those who desired to hold religious
services; on Wednesdays, for socialistic or free thought lectures
and debates; and on other days it was open to any members who
desired to hold meetings on any subject of interest to the
community. The inaugural ceremony was a very simple one and soon
performed. It was decided to name the little settlement, which up
to the present had done without one, by a word which all treasured
perhaps above any other&mdash;'Freedom'; and the hall was named The
Hall of Freedom.</p>

<p>There were now six hundred persons on the sixteen hundred acres
of land, with two hundred and twenty cottages and animal and
vegetable life in abundance, all of which had been fully paid for
except the steam plough upon which the balance of their payment was
not yet due. Even many of their foes admitted that was good work to
be accomplished in one year by people who had started together
comparatively penniless. But their brightest days were yet in
store.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII.</h2>

<p>Another year had passed over the settlers heads. During that
time their little community had enormously increased. Two thousand
of them were already settled on the land, of which they had over
4,000 acres, which was more than two acres to each individual,
being more than double the area that the people of Japan possess,
where 34 million people are supported in comparative comfort on 33
million acres; the directors considered that over two acres per
individual would be ample, as every acre was being used, and none
held in idleness for speculative purposes. They had erected 500
cottages; their live stock amounted to 500 head of cattle, 60
draught horses, a number of saddle horses that some of the
selectors had brought up on their private account, 30,000 fowls, a
quantity of turkeys, besides a few dogs, goats, and other domestic
animals, and a large number of bees.</p>

<p>Their productivity was already becoming somewhat important. They
were exporting monthly £600 worth of eggs, £350 worth of butter,
and vegetable products of all kinds to the extent of over £2,000.
And now the directors purchased 640 acres on the banks of the
Murray River, about nine miles from the former site. This they
settled in the same way as they had done at the Freedom community.
The new settlement, which was called Equity, was opened with a
batch of two hundred settlers, for whom fifty cottages had been
built, and who took with them the usual stock of implements,
utensils, seed, live stock, and provisions. This month they paid
the balance of £690 due on the steam plough and erected a large
steam factory at Freedom, at a cost of £1,000. In this factory was
a large churn capable of making 410 pounds of butter in about five
minutes, the various requirements for canning and preserving
fruits, besides different machinery that supplied power for many
industries of the settlers and saved their labor.</p>

<p>The directors continued to extend and develop both of the
settlements by constantly purchasing fresh land, and sending more
members upon it, until at last the number of Pioneers remaining in
Melbourne was very small indeed, and the day was fast approaching
when that unfortunate city would see them no more. It was now
thirty-five months since the first pioneers had arrived at Lake
Boga, leaving 4,900 comrades behind them. The directors had started
the month with £2,000 in hand, and the settlers had sent down their
usual monthly supply of 250,000 fowls, 30,000 pounds of butter,
1,000 tons of vegetables and fruits, besides a large supply of
preserves and sundry products from the two settlements.</p>

<p>These, after deducting all expenses, had realized £13,000; and
the monthly call from the 500 Pioneers had amounted to a modest
£62, making a grand total of £15,062 in the hands of the directors.
With this they sent up the remaining members, on the first day of
the following month of June at a total cost of £12,000. Thus the
Social Pioneers had, in exactly three years, settled the whole of
their 5,000 members on 10,600 acres of land, upon which they had
erected 1,250 cottages besides their public hall and factories;
they had cultivated and irrigated those lands by means of the best
labor saving machinery; and, besides their 1,200 head of cattle,
they had their pretty little colonies literally packed with live
stock and vegetation capable of sustaining in comfort every one of
them and thousands more besides. And yet the total capital paid up
by all the members was only 17,746!</p>

<p>Now that all the members were settled, the society held a
general meeting of its members at the Hall of Freedom, when the
whole wealth of the community was calculated and the members were
formally freed of their dependance upon its direction, and their
accumulated wealth individualized. This was very simple. The 10,600
acres of land, which under the property system of other towns,
would have been estimated at about £4,000,000 was utterly valueless
in a mercantile sense, owing to the society's Constitution making
it not a saleable commodity; so it was left entirely out of account
in their calculations. All the cottages, factories, machinery,
irrigating works, agricultural implements, live stock, fruit trees,
vegetable products, besides the steam plough, public hall, &amp;c.,
were carefully valued&mdash;everything movable, in fact, except the
personal belongings that the settlers had brought with them, with
the result that the aggregate wealth was estimated at 500,000. This
equalled £100 to each individual; and the society accordingly
issued labor notes to the full amount, giving each individual £100
worth of them, with which he could then, or at any other time,
purchase from the directors the equivalent from any of the wealth
in the possession of the society.</p>

<p>These notes were very simply arranged so as to fit in with the
prevailing outside system, and be easy of adoption by the Pioneers.
The £1 labor note was made the standard so as to fit in with the £1
in outside sterling currency which it equalled in purchasing power,
although it was not professedly redeemable in coin, but could
readily he exchanged for it when anyone desired it. On the basis of
this £1 the decimal system was adopted. The lowest denomination was
a <i>cent</i> (equal to about 1/4d), 10 cents made a <i>mark</i>
(equal to about 2 1/2d.), 10 marks made an <i>hour</i> (which was
the average hourly value of labor or product in the communities,
and which equalled 2s.), and ten hours made a <i>pound</i>. Each
one selected what he desired to purchase with his money, some
retaining the balance in their own possession and a number
depositing it in the mutual bank.</p>

<p>The subsequent proceedings were very brief. Most of the pioneers
formed themselves into a co-operative body, appointing several of
the original directors to some of the principle offices in it.
Others formed themselves into a communist group or two and "pooled"
their little possessions into one common fund. And a few chose to
"paddle their own canoe" alone, settling down to a private life
without enduring the worries and cares of any organization
whatever.</p>

<p>"And now," said old Martin, when these matters were all
definitely arranged, "I want to keep my faith with you, and tell
you something about Felix Slymer. He promised our friend Holdfast
before these communities were started, or the society fully formed,
that when he got the whole five thousand members settled on the
land he would give them a free grant of 10,000 acres of his
magnificent estate at Healesville."</p>

<p>This announcement was received with uproarious applause.</p>

<p>"That is what I promised to tell you," continued Martin, "but
now I have something better still to reveal. It is a letter that
Sir Felix has just sent to our veteran, and of which he has sent a
copy for me to read to you at this meeting:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Holdfast,<br>
<br>
I have long been a critic of your actions, and I am sorry to say an
opponent to them. But, although I hesitate to confess it, I now
proclaim myself one of your earnest disciples. I cannot help
feeling ashamed of myself when I think how I have injured you and
yours; but I know you are so large-hearted you will forgive me,
especially as I shall try to make amends. When I offered you the
10,000 acres of land at Healesville, I did not anticipate giving
it, because I did not think it possible for you to succeed in
carrying out your enterprise. Since then, I have seen you do so;
and I have now lived as a resident member for over twelve months at
your pretty village of Freedom, which I would not leave, with its
smiling farms and cheerful inhabitants, for all the wealth in the
world.<br>
<br>
I intend to stop here. You have made a changed man of me, and I
hasten to confess that change in a practical manner. I therefore
enclose deeds of all my valuable estates throughout the colony,
transferring them gratuitously to the Social Pioneers, to use for
the benefit of humanity in accordance with their system that has
worked here with such admirable results. And I only reserve to
myself £100,000 in cash, with which I shall erect a comfortable
house at Freedom and try to live in comfort for the remainder of my
days. I shall give you the balance of my possessions, except my
title, which I shall retain to please my ambition and also on the
grounds of expediency, and sign myself,<br>
<br>
Your earnest well wisher,<br>
Sir Felix Slymer."</p>

<p>When Martin had finished reading the letter, the whole meeting
gave Sir Felix Slymer three hearty cheers, and after a little
pleasant speechifying, the liberal donor, who was present in
person, suitably responded, and the happy people then returned to
their homes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII.</h2>

<p>The directors, on receiving Slymer's donation, instantly started
to operate with it. They erected factories of all kinds on the
various allotments, sent immense herds of sheep to some of the new
settlements, dispatched to the settlements all the people they
could induce to join, and soon made the colony of Victoria a real
hive of industry.</p>

<p>The effect of the new system on the settlers was beginning to be
observed in their healthy color, erect forms, and genial natures.
Their sympathy for each other was equally remarkable: when one of
the Pioneers had his little home burned down, hundreds of the
neighbors instantly assisted to gratuitously erect and furnish a
new one for him and his family. They scarcely ever drank spirits;
and one enterprising genius, who joined the society and opened a
hotel in Equity, was glad to turn it into a temperance boarding
house to make it pay. Their profusion of fruit, grain, nuts, and
vegetables, so weaned them from the eating of meat, that their
health got better and better; and a large number of them became
strict vegetarians, and soon enjoyed the superiority in body and
mind which that simple diet always bestows upon the fortunate
individuals who intelligently embrace it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>XIX.</h2>

<p>The Social Pioneers now increased their share capital
indefinitely, and hundreds of thousands joined them to enjoy their
many advantages. Mortgaged estates were bought up everywhere, thus
benefiting both the mortgagor and the Society. They bought tracts
of land in all parts of the colony&mdash;in country, suburb, and
city&mdash;and immediately employed their members upon it. Branches
were opened in the adjoining colonies, and the lands there treated
in a similar manner. The movement soon spread to England, Europe,
America, Africa, and even Asia; and the workers of all countries
soon began to forget they had ever been divided into nations, for
they were all becoming Social Pioneers, and realized they were all
common brothers in humanity. In Melbourne and Sydney, the Chinese,
and other unfortunate "sweated" foreigners, found it necessary to
join the new organization, against whose cheap production they were
unable to compete; and the Kanakas in Queensland gladly joined
hands with their white brethren, whom the cruel capitalists had
imported them to injure.</p>

<p>The effect on the outside community was now marvellous. The
unemployed disappeared from the city, as they became absorbed in
the new enterprize. Wages rose everywhere, because labor was
everyday becoming scarcer, and employers had increased difficulty
in getting men to work for them. Those who did get work demanded
better pay than hitherto, and it was readily granted; they worked
with renewed vigor, and pleased both the employers and themselves.
The increasing demand for labor saving machinery, by the different
groups of Social Pioneers, became so enormous, that the prices went
down considerably owing to the increased sales, and the purchasing
power of the workers' larger earnings were thus considerably
increased. The universal desire to remove the restrictive tariffs
on imports was met by a ready response, and such excellent labor
saving machinery was imported so cheaply that the Victorian people
soon began to almost monopolize the leading markets of the world by
the cheapening of their commodities, for which, too, the highest
wages on earth were paid.</p>

<p>Employer after employer joined the new organization as he
realized the advantages afforded him in abolished rents, decreased
cost of production, an exit from financial embarrassments, and a
steady market for his goods. Rents fell wherever the Social
Pioneers bought up lands, because everywhere the adjoining tenants
joined the Society and shifted on to the freed land alongside, and
the vacated dwellings could find no new tenants. Empty houses
became so common, and so few people wanted to buy them that the
Society got them for a trifling sum, even in the heart of the city.
Rents were getting equalized in city and country, and were fast
tending towards zero. The increasing reduction of rents and
cheapening of commodities so increased the purchasing power of the
laborers' wages that they commenced beautifying their homes and
enjoying the best of luxuries; while hotel-keeper after hotel
keeper had to close up his business, because the people were no
longer miserable and poverty-stricken enough to drown their sorrows
in beastly intoxicants; and even the tobacconists found a deal of
their income now seeking other channels. Everywhere the free
competition of the equitably dealing Social Pioneers was fast
driving out the plundering system of capitalism; and all classes of
the community were hastening to participate in the new
movement.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>XX.</h2>

<p>Harry Holdfast had intended to go to Freedom along with the last
batch of the first five thousand settlers, but his health had not
permitted him. The terrible strain, which the carrying out of his
scheme had been upon his strength, was more than he could endure;
and at last he broke down. During his fifteen year's confinement in
prison he had contracted a serious malady, which was now assuming
such alarming symptoms that his best friends were losing hopes of
his recovery. His affectionate lover was always by his side,
cheering him with her kind and intellectual remarks; but she, too,
was losing all hopes of seeing him restored to health and
friends.</p>

<p>"I am afraid my last day is nigh," said he one day, as he moaned
in agony on his bed and only brought out each word with difficulty
and considerable pain and exhaustion.</p>

<p>At his bedside were Wilberforce, Miss Wilson, and Hypatia, with
sorrowful looks that too well betrayed their fears for the
sufferer.</p>

<p>"I hope not," Harry, said Hypatia; "it seems sad that you should
be lost to the world just when you have accomplished your grand
work, and have not even seen with your own eyes the mighty results
of your endeavors. But I am afraid, Harry, you are right. I would
not deceive you by giving you false hopes."</p>

<p>"I know you would not, Hypatia. Honest men and women never
deceive each other."</p>

<p>The doctors who had been in attendance on the poor fellow had
told Hypatia that they did not think he could live many more hours,
as he had allowed the disease to get such a firm hold of him that
it had got totally beyond their power to cure. They had telegraphed
for a young Baunscheidtist healer, who was an intimate friend of
Harry's, but he had not arrived.</p>

<p>Presently the patient opened his wearied eyes and attempted to
speak again.</p>

<p>"Dear friends," said he, speaking with the greatest difficulty,
and pausing every now and then to regain his breath, "if I die,
take a last message from me to the poor emancipated proletaire of
Freedom and Equity. Tell them I hoped to see them and shake hands
with them. Aye, tell them if I could only see those happy lands of
their's, I would willingly meet my death afterwards. But, oh I
would like to see them first! Tell them, my pleasure at their
happiness is more than my weak brain can stand. The cruel tortures
of my persecutors did not affect me; but the thought of these poor
starving men and women being made happy fills me with emotions that
nearly choke me. I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;." Here the poor fellow
completely broke down, sobbing like a child.</p>

<p>After a little time, he regained his composure.</p>

<p>"Tell them all," he continued, "that if I die, I die with the
conviction that my life has not been useless; and that its end was
all happiness. Tell those who have maligned and injured me, that I
forgive them and love them; for I know they were poor fellow
mortals like myself and could not help what they did. Tell Slymer I
thank him for his kind donation, and I rejoice to see that one of
his intelligence has been rescued from the ferocious system that
had made him traitor to his fellow-men; and tell him I am proud to
think that through my small efforts he is now helping the Pioneers
in their glorious crusade against injustice. And, Hypatia, come
nearer a minute. Hypatia are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Fred, I am here," she answered softly, "what do you want
to tell me?"</p>

<p>The lips of the sick man were moving, as though he wanted to
speak; but he made no sound. They both strained their ears and
leaned over him to catch the last words of love to his devoted
girl. But still they heard nothing. Presently his lips ceased to
move, and a happy smile stole over his face.</p>

<p>Harry Holdfast was dead.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>A train reached Lake Boga station carrying a body of mourners
and a coffin. In that coffin was the corpse of Harry Holdfast,
whose friends had brought him to Freedom that the remains of the
veteran emancipator might be humbly interred in the spot he had
consecrated by his noble efforts. Amongst the mourners was Hypatia
Stephens. She got out with the others, and entered one of the
vehicles in the sad procession. But she did not seem to see
anything. When she reached Freedom, she was like a simple child,
and her friends had to lead her from the conveyance. She seemed
suddenly to have lost her reason. Then she asked if she could
retire into private communion with herself for a few moments. The
request of the afflicted woman was readily complied with; and the
funeral proceedings were suspended while she was escorted into one
of the cottages near by and her re-appearance waited for.
Half-an-hour elapsed, but still she did not appear. At last, two of
the women went into the room to see if any harm had befallen her.
She was not there; but a newly written letter was upon the table
beside the inkstand. They took it up and read it. It was addressed
to "Miss Wilson, care of F. Wilberforce, Melbourne," and ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Alice,<br>
<br>
I have no one to console with, no one to confide in. You are not
here. My best friend, Harry, is gone. I find myself in a strange
land amongst strange people. I cannot bear it any longer. I know
they are good people and would love me and be kind to me, but the
one I want is not amongst them. Poor sister, how often I have
thought of you, and recalled the troubles you had when we worked
together in Sydney trying to earn a crust of bread. And how often I
have thought of your struggle trying to earn that crust, and the
misery and suffering it caused you. I know society maligned you. I
know how, when it had degraded you and nearly maddened you, it
turned round and spat upon you and called you its prostitute. But,
Alice, I think you no prostitute.<br>
<br>
I think you a martyr. Oh, how I wish every woman were as noble and
independent as you, poor girl! I often wonder how it is that I did
not sell my pleasures to lascivious hypocrites as you have had to
do, my poor sister. Was it because I had not the courage? Or was it
that I loved Harry too well to let the pangs of hunger banish my
virtuous regard for him? Perhaps it was both causes combined.
However, he is dead now. My life's hope is no more. The cruel world
is black and cheerless. It has at last broken my poor weak heart;
and I feel the time has come when I must bid you all good-bye.
Remember me to your good friend and future husband, Fred
Wilberforce, and tell him I once again thank him for his many
kindnesses to Harry and me. Give my love to every Social Pioneer
and all who are working for the truer humanity. And tell them my
last hopes are with them and with their glorious cause. And take
the last farewell wishes from<br>
<br>
Your loving sister in misfortune,<br>
Hypatia.</p>

<p>When the women had read the letter, they hastened into the next
room. There they saw the poor broken-hearted girl lying on the
rough couch. They leaned over her, and felt her to make sure she
still lived. But they felt the cold clay.</p>

<p>Hypatia was dead!</p>

<p>Just as the gardener plucks the choicest flowers and leaves the
others to bloom without them, so Nature takes from us Her choicest
flowers and leaves us to mourn their loss. Our brightest hopes
leave us just as success seems sure. Our friends forsake us just as
we learn to love them. Our martyrs sacrifice their lives unto us;
and then, when it is too late, we regret them, and build our
prosperity on their misery.</p>

<p>Harry Holdfast and his friends had sacrificed themselves for
humanity.</p>

<p>They had consecrated their lives to the martyr's cause of
Freedom.</p>

<p>The Workers were at last emancipated!</p>
